        "text": "As both an alumna and past parent of two Stevenson students, I am humbled that my fellow trustees—people for whom I have great affection and respect—have chosen me to be their next chair. As a board, we understand that our duties are focused and limited, which include, hiring, nurturing, and evaluating the President; assuring Stevenson’s financial stability; maintaining and expanding the school’s physical assets; promoting fundraising efforts; and, supporting Stevenson’s mission, which includes preparing students for success in school and their lives beyond, fostering their passion and capacity for learning and achievement, and helping them learn to shape a joyful life. We have entrusted Dr. Griffiths, in whom we have placed great trust and respect, to ensure this mission is carried out through his and our exceptional faculty’s efforts.\n\nOn a more personal level, my intention has always been to give back to Stevenson, which along with the gift of financial aid that made my attendance possible, cared for me like a family should and showed me how to access my full potential as an uncertain teenager. The magic of Stevenson has always been grounded in generosity and acceptance, which explains why so many students have felt free to determine who they wanted to be—absent of unfair criticism and judgment. Without question, I am only one of many alumni who realize that I would not be where I am in the world today without Stevenson’s guidance and compassion.\n\nOn behalf of my fellow trustees, I welcome you to Stevenson’s remarkable community."
