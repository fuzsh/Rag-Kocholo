A number of milestone experiences in the classroom and extracurricular activities in sports provided him with the opportunity to build confidence and relationships. With the passing of his father in the summer before his Junior year, his coaches were especially powerful in providing him with strong role models and an outlet to grow as a young man.\n\nJensen describes his professional career as one of true blessings. In 2007, he went to Green Bay and started his career at Bellin Health as a personal trainer. That summer, Christian began training a woman to help improve her functioning which had been severely limited due to muscular dystrophy to slow the progression of disease. However, he discovered that she was training him with her positive attitude. As part of the therapy, he and his wife would take the client for runs on the Fox River Trail with the use of a specialized racing chair. They started participating in local endurance events which gave her the freedom her body no longer could. In 2009, they completed her first Marathon. Upon crossing the finish line, the client gave them the spark to start something that they believed would change the community when she said “I feel free when we run!” In 2010, they started myTEAM TRIUMPH, a non-profit athletic mentoring program for challenged athletes. They focus on enabling the spirit of challenged athletes through the teamwork environment of endurance athletics. His client, and the other “Captains” who lead myTEAM TRIUMPH have a gift of an enduring spirit.
