        "text": "Brother Michael Sullivan, S.M., D.M.A., enjoys sharing information, history and experiences with students that open their eyes to the bigger world around them. He wants students to learn to use their gift of music to make the world a better place, sharing their passion and talents with others. As a professed Marianist, he also takes pride in teaching students about the Marianist charism and spirit.\n\nSullivan teaches St. Mary’s Core courses, as well as music history and performance labs. Through each of these courses, he raises students’ awareness to globalization and how others around the world engage with one another in local, national and global settings. His students explore the impact of the creative process as revealed in the art of human expression. They are also exposed to a variety of practices and theories in both the visual and performing arts."
