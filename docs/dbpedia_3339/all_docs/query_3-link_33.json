        "text": "\"To have the chance to lead our best players is an honor and a challenge I'm very much looking forward to.\"\n\nMarshfield native Mike Sullivan will coach the United States at the 2025 4 Nations Face-Off and 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics.\n\nSullivan played for Boston College High School, Boston University, and the Bruins, among other teams. He then coached the Bruins before steering the Pittsburgh Penguins to two championships.\n\nHe was previously named Team USA’s coach four years prior, but COVID-19 altered the schedule and prevented him from fulfilling that role.\n\nSullivan made it clear it’s a responsibility he doesn’t take lightly.\n\n“I’m very thankful to have the opportunity to coach our team in these two very significant international events,” Sullivan said in a release. “It’s been amazing to see the progress we’ve made in hockey in our country over the course of my lifetime, and to have the chance to lead our best players is an honor and a challenge I’m very much looking forward to.”\n\nSullivan has spent five decades with USA Hockey, including a stint as an assistant coach at the 2006 Turin Olympics.\n\n“Mike Sullivan is not only a great coach, but someone who has a strong passion for American hockey,” said Pat Kelleher, executive director of USA Hockey. “He’s a world-class leader and been an important part of hockey in our country for a very long time.”\n\nThe 4 Nations Face-Off is a best-on-best tournament using only NHL players with the U.S., Canada, Finland, and Sweden, spanning from Feb. 12-20. The Olympics will be held from Feb. 6-22 in 2026."
