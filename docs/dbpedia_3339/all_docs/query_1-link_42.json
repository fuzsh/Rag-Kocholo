        "text": "We spend a lot of time in class working through assignments (depending on the particular course). I try to inject humor where appropriate, sometimes successfully, and sometimes not... I am always concerned with the students needs, and always fair.\n\nThe engagement needs to be mutual, just like with a spouse. If both parties don’t do their share, there is little hope of success. I come to class each day ready to roll!\n\nI have been at Carroll since the fall of 1976. I came to Carroll as a student because the baseball coach called and recruited me, found out I liked it so much and have since stayed for over 40 years. Students should always feel comfortable approaching me with any topic, related to the current course or not."
