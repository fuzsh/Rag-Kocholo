        "text": "Dan Boyd of the great Class of 2003 stood out on the football field in many aspects. At 6’3 and 280 pounds, Dan intimidated defensive linemen from his tackle position. But Dan was also technically sound and opened huge holes for the likes of Tony Temple and Marcus Perry who recorded monster rushing seasons. Dan earned himself All-District, All-Metro, and 1st team All-State honors both his junior and senior seasons. The offenses both years averaged 37 points per game, and Rockhurst won by an average margin of 27 points. Dan was a catalyst to The Rock’s success from 2000-02, when the team went 36-2 and had two undefeated championship seasons. Dan went on to play football at Northwest Missouri State University.\n\nMatt Darby of the great Class of 2000 was pivotal in Rock Soccer winning the first State Championships in program history. In 1998, Rockhurst did not lose a match, going 27-0-1 en route to its first-ever soccer title. As a midfielder, Matt played both sides of the ball and the defense allowed just 10 goals all year. Matt’s senior year squad recorded 15 shutouts in 29 matches while the team went 27-1-1. In that season, Rockhurst defeated #1 nationally ranked Marquette University High School. Matt and the Hawklet defense went on to blank SLUH in the State Championship and Rock capped its repeat title with a #10 national ranking. Matt was named 1st Team All-State and the Missouri Defensive Player of the Year and continued playing at Marquette University. He was named head coach of the program in 2019. Through five seasons under Coach Darby, Rockhurst is 103-14-3, winning State Championships in 2021, 2022, and 2023, as well as the program’s first National Championship in 2023 after going 24-0-0.\n\nZach Frisch of the great Class of 2005 is the first Rockhurst athlete to win a State Championship for the Hawklets as both a player and as a coach. Zach was the Tennis State Doubles Champion his junior and senior seasons, and placed 2nd as a sophomore while helping the Hawklets win State Titles all four years of his career - bringing the program’s streak at the time to 10 consecutive titles. Zach was named to the KC Star’s All-Metro Team three times and still ranks 3rd in MSHSAA history for most doubles wins in a season, going 28-0 in 2004. His career varsity doubles record was 64-2 before playing college tennis. Frisch returned to The Rock as head coach from 2012-2017, winning three State Championships, two 2nd Place finishes, and one 3rd Place finish, while holding a career coaching record of 85-8.\n\nVince Hodes of the great Class of 1990 helped Rockhurst football make its dominant run in the late-80s. Vince was a three-year member of the Football Hawklets, playing safety and doubling as the place kicker. In his three varsity seasons, Rockhurst went 32-5 and made the State Finals twice. As a sophomore in 1987, Vince was the hero by booting a 40-yard field goal in the waning seconds of the Semifinal game that ousted Jefferson City 18-16 on its home field, and Rockhurst went on to win the State Title. Vince was named 2nd Team All-State his senior year as a defensive back, and is second in program history with seven interceptions in a season. He went on to play at the University of San Diego.\n\nD.J. Hord of the great Class of 2005 is still revered as one of the best athletes in Rockhurst history, whose speed made him feared on both the football field and on the track. He was a four-year letterman in track, who by his sophomore season had broken the school records in both the 100-meter and 200-meter. He still holds both records, with blazing times of 10.35 and 21.17. D.J. placed in the top-4 at State in both the 100 and 200 in his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons. He was just as talented as a slotback and wide receiver. D.J. was a three-year starter and member of the 2002 undefeated State Championship team, scoring an 81-yard touchdown in the Finals, a state record at the time. He then led the team in receptions and receiving yards in 2003 and 2004, averaging 20 yards per catch for his career, and went on to be named a US Army All-American and the Gatorade Missouri Football Player of the Year in 2004 before playing at Notre Dame.\n\nTim Mauck of the great Class of 1990 sparked a Hawklet offense that averaged 34 points per game during a State Runner-Up finish in 1989. At tight end, Tim broke the Rockhurst single season receptions record with 43 catches, totaling 628 yards and seven touchdowns. That still stands as the most productive season for a tight end in program history. But Tim may best be remembered for recovering a fumble in the end zone in the fourth overtime to beat Jefferson City in the State Semifinals, in what Athletic Director Al Davis called “The Game of the Decade.” He was selected as 1st Team All-State tight end and was also named a 1st Team Jesuit All-American. Tim won the Bukaty Award as a senior, given to the team’s best leader on and off the field. Baseball returned to The Rock as a varsity sport in 1989, and Tim was a varsity letterman in his junior and senior seasons before playing football at New Mexico State University.\n\nMichael McGee of the great Class of 2009 stands out even in a storied program like Rockhurst golf. As a freshman, Michael made the varsity team on the defending State Champions. He placed 6th at Districts and 16th at State as the Hawklets were again the Missouri State Champs. That would be the first of three team titles Michael helped win. As a sophomore Michael was the top Rockhurst player at State with an 11th Place finish as the team took 3rd. He then accepted the leadership role as an upperclassman as The Rock won both the 2008 and 2009 team championships. Michael finished 14th as a junior, and was co-individual State Champ as a senior while the Hawklets won by an incredible 23 strokes. In his historic senior season, Michael averaged 73.7 strokes per 18 holes. He was the program’s third individual State Champ, but the first to ever pair it with a team title. Michael went on to play at Indiana University.\n\nEd was a multi-sport athlete, playing football, basketball, and baseball. He was a “cool, smooth working guard” according to the KC Times when the Hawklets won the 1932 State Basketball Championship. When the team showed up to play the game their uniforms did not make it, so Thomas McGee, his grandfather paid for them to scramble and get playing gear. This was the first State Title for Rockhurst in any sport. The team was coached by Ed Halpin when they beat Joplin 17-15.\n\nEd was captain of the football team his senior year, although an injury prevented him from playing.\n\nHis three sons went on to play for the Rock, all three (Kerry '67, Jerry '69, and Jay '76) are also in the Rockhurst Sports Hall of Fame. Many grandsons (including Matt Krull '94, another Hall of Famer) and now great-grandsons have attended Rockhurst, much to his joy from his heavenly perch.\n\nThomas Robinson of the great Class of 2006 is the first athlete from Rockhurst’s swim & dive program, the AquaHawks, to be inducted into the Sports Hall of Fame. As just a freshman, Thomas was a member of the 400 Free Relay Team that placed 3rd at State. As a sophomore he was on the AquaHawks’ first ever gold medal in the 200 Medley Relay, and also placed 2nd individually in both the 200 IM and 100 Backstroke. Thomas was pivotal in Rockhurst’s rise to dominance that began his junior year, winning the first of 11 consecutive State Titles. Thomas and his teammates broke the state record in the 200 Medley Relay, he again took 2nd in the 200 IM, and then he became the first AquaHawk to win an individual State Championship, with a gold medal in the 100 Backstroke. He then anchored the winning 400 Free Relay which was the deciding factor in The Rock’s first team title. As senior captain, Thomas was again a member of the State Champion 200 Medley Team. He finished his Rockhurst career as a nine-time All-American before swimming at Yale University.\n\nConner Teahan of the great Class of 2007 was at the core of Rockhurst Basketball’s run of three straight Final Four appearances. Conner is one of only three players in Missouri to win back-to-back Gatorade Basketball Player of the Year Awards. He burst on the scene as a sophomore after starting the season on JV, and by the end of the season was an All-District selection after scoring more than 17 per game in the playoffs as The Rock finished 4th at State. As a junior he was the go-to player for the 26-5 Hawklets, averaging 18.4 points per game and shooting better than 40% from deep with another 4th Place finish. His senior season was sensational; Conner averaged 25 points, 8 rebounds, and 3 assists per game en route to the Hawklets’ runner-up finish at State and was named Mr. Show-Me Basketball. Conner was also a standout quarterback, starting for two seasons and leading Rockhurst to a 16-5 combined record with 3,100 passing yards and 31 touchdowns. Conner went on to play basketball at Kansas and was a National Champion.\n\nJohn Teasdale of the great Class of 1997 was one of the most highly-recruited athletes in Rockhurst history, and for his incredible talent on both sides of the football was named a USA Today Honorable Mention All-American, 1st-Team All-State, All-Metro, and All-District following the 1996 season. Standing 6’6 and 255 pounds by his senior year, John was a three-year starter on the offensive and defensive lines, where he had the athleticism to play tackle, guard, tight end, and defensive end. His senior season he registered 33 tackles, 9 sacks, and 10 receptions for 143 yards. John was also a three-year starter on the basketball team, helping lead them to the State Quarterfinals his junior year. John went on to play football at Notre Dame.\n\nNick Vignatelli of the great Class of 2006 is the second AquaHawk swimmer to be inducted into the Rockhurst Sports Hall of Fame. Nick was a four-year letterman who helped The Rock win the 2005 swim & dive State Championship; the first of many for the program. As a junior, Nick was a member of the 200 Medley Relay team that won State in record-breaking time. He also placed 5th in the 50 Free, giving Rock valuable points to help beat Blue Springs by 12 and bring home the program’s first title. As a senior, Nick was 2nd in the 50 Free in 21.37 and earned All-American honors. Nick and his AquaHawk teammates also won the 200 Medley again as Rockhurst cruised to back-to-back State Titles. For his individual and relay career, Nick was All-State eight times and All-American five times."
