        "text": "The Board of Trustees has fiduciary responsibility and is the principal governance authority for Marquette University. The board is responsible for preserving and enhancing Marquette’s mission and ensuring that long-term planning and goals are defined and executed by the university community.\n\nMarquette’s bylaws stipulate that the Board of Trustees be comprised of no fewer than 25 and no more than 40 members, of whom no fewer than five and no more than eight must be members of the Society of Jesus. The university’s president serves ex-officio as a member of the board. The board is self-perpetuating, meaning that trustees are responsible for electing new members. Trustees serve for three-year terms and may be re-elected to serve for a maximum of 12 years. Trustees are volunteers and are not compensated for their service.\n\nThe board may elect any retired or retiring trustee to be a trustee emeritus or trustee emerita for life. Trustees emeriti do not attend meetings of the board.\n\nThe board holds in trust Marquette’s human, physical, and financial assets for future generations. The trustees are stewards of Marquette’s Catholic and Jesuit identity. They establish policies on university strategy, financial management, fundraising, investments, property and assets. The board is responsible for hiring and evaluating the university’s president. The day-to-day administration of Marquette is the responsibility of the university president and his leadership team."
