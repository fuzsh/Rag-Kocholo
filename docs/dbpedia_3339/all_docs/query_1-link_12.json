        "text": "MILWAUKEE -- The Roman Catholic Jesuit province serving much of the eastern United States on Monday released the names of Jesuit priests who face \"credible or established\" accusations of sexual abuse of minors dating to 1950. The list includes eight priests in Wisconsin -- four in Milwaukee.\n\nA letter from the Jesuits said the list was released in an effort to be transparent, but some survivors in southeast Wisconsin said this isn't enough.\n\nThe list includes three who worked at Marquette University High School, one at Marquette University and four others at another Jesuit school in southwestern Wisconsin. Two other priests from Chicago were once under the supervision of former Marquette University President Robert Wild. This fall, he pulled his name from a new residence hall, saying he mishandled allegations against three priests while working in Chicago -- before his time at Marquette University.\n\nMarquette University\n\n\"This has been a long time coming. The problem is that these lists are not complete. We have names of offenders and know of offenders who are not on this list,\" said Peter Isely, the founder of the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP.\n\nThe names from Midwest Jesuits include:\n\nPeter Isely\n\nAttorneys general are investigating in more than a dozen states. Isely and others have called on Wisconsin to join the investigation.\n\n\"We're hoping this is going to push, urge the new attorney general to investigate,\" said Isely.\n\nIsely said there's still a long road ahead for survivors in southeast Wisconsin.\n\n\"There are a lot of survivors that have taken their lives. There are an alarming number of victims over the course of their lives, that cannot live with what happened to them,\" said Isely.\n\nFOX6 News is awaiting a response from Marquette University officials.\n\nComplete statement from Marquette University High School:\n\n\"Marquette University High School fully supports the release of information of Jesuits of the Midwest Province with established allegations of sexual abuse of minors since 1955.The public release of these names is another reminder of a dark time in the Church's history. We join the Jesuit Midwest Province in offering our deepest apologies. It is time for transparency, reconciliation and healing. Our concern—first and foremost—are with the victim-survivors.\n\nMarquette High takes any report alleging abuse with the utmost attention and seriousness. We deplore such behavior and have zero tolerance for it. The protection and safety of our students is our number one priority. Today, if Marquette High receives an abuse allegation by a minor, the school is mandated to immediately report to the appropriate authorities, including law enforcement and child protective services. The individual in question would be immediately placed on administrative leave pending a full investigation.\"\n\nComplete statement from Peter Isely/SNAP:\n\n\"Today the Midwest Province of the Jesuit order released a list of names of known clerical child sex offenders, including those who were working in Wisconsin.\n\nThe release of names today comes after months of revelations throughout the United States related to the ongoing crisis of clergy sex abuse and cover up by the hierarchy of the Catholic Church – including its religious orders – who have remained for too long the hidden dimension of this still unfolding story.\n\nToday’s list is only a list of names. Those names were compiled by the organization that was responsible for both the abuse and the cover up of child sex crimes. This list does not supply even the most basic information such as the assignment history of the offender or the date the allegation was received.\n\nWith every new “name dump” that has been occurring throughout the United States, there has been evidence from justice officials and victims’ organizations that these lists are not complete. Now that this latest list has been released, the attorney general in each state where Jesuits have had offenders should vet these lists for the public. In states where attorneys general have already begun such investigations, such as Illinois, dozens of names have been determined to have been left off lists released by church officials.\n\nMore importantly, each name of an offender priest should be accompanied by its church file, which will reveal how that case was handled by church officials. Those names — the names of religious order provincials and bishops who covered up these crimes — are as essential to a full accounting of these crimes as is the name of the offender.\n\nAmong the worst evidence of abuse and cover up by the Wisconsin province concerns cases and files which were not released today related to Jesuit offenders in church run boarding schools in the Native American Pine and Rosebud reservations in South and North Dakota, the tribal lands of the Lakota Sioux.\n\nIt was a long-standing practice by the Jesuits to transfer or “dump” clerical sex offenders into “mission” territories inside of many of the major tribal communities throughout North America. In places where there has been the court ordered release of Jesuit files, such as in Alaska, this practice and clear pattern of human and civil rights violations, embody the most horrific and shameful episode of the entire sexual abuse crisis in the United States. Although several offenders working or transferred to these tribal territories are listed, there is no mention in today’s announcement or responsibility taken for this unconscionable practice, which remains today under a near complete veil of secrecy, neglect and darkness.\n\nNative American survivors, including of Jesuit run institutions in South Dakota, have attempted to bring their cases to court but have been barred by state law and a wholly archaic statute of limitations there. No federal investigation of these crimes has ever been commenced. There has simply been no justice for these survivors.\n\nGiven these facts, we believe that a full investigation by the Wisconsin Attorney General of the Wisconsin Province and the Federal US Attorney are especially urgent and required after today’s release. Such an investigation is the only path to justice.\"\n\nComplete list of USA Midwest Province Jesuits with \"established allegation(s) of sexual abuse of a minor:\n\n\"This list is comprised of the names of Jesuits against whom there is one or more established allegations of sexual abuse of a minor. These Jesuits are or were members of the USA Midwest Province of the Society of Jesus, or its predecessor entities, since 1955. This list also contains the names of Jesuits from other Jesuit provinces, who were in the Midwest Province at the time of the allegation.\n\nThe Midwest Province was formed in June 2017 from the former Chicago, Chicago-Detroit, Detroit, and Wisconsin provinces, and encompasses Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming. The Midwest Province currently has 510 Jesuit members; approximately 4,000 Jesuits have served in the province since 1955.\n\nAn established allegation is based on the facts and circumstances of each case wherein there is a reasonable certainty that the sexual abuse of a minor occurred. An established allegation leads to the Jesuit’s permanent removal from public ministry and possible criminal prosecution. The names on this list are based on a process of consultation and not a legal judgment.\n\nThis list is based on investigations that have been completed. Jesuits with allegations that are currently being investigated have not been included on this list. We have also retained an outside third-party investigation service, Hillard Heintze, to conduct an examination of our records to make sure that our disclosure of names is complete. When an allegation is deemed established, the list will be updated.\n\nThe list below is organized into three sections:\n\n1) Contains the names of Jesuits against whom an established allegation of sexual abuse of a minor was made and investigated while the Jesuit was living or against whom multiple established allegations were received after his death. While an allegation received after a Jesuit is deceased does not provide the opportunity for the Jesuit to respond, multiple allegations against a Jesuit may indicate a corroborative pattern of abuse which support the conclusion of established allegations.\n\n2) Contains the names of Jesuits against whom a single established allegation was received after his death. While any allegation received is investigated to the extent possible, an allegation received after a Jesuit is deceased does not provide the opportunity for the Jesuit to respond.\n\n3) Contains the names of Jesuits whose names have been published on a diocesan website, another Jesuit province website, named in a civil lawsuit, named within a bankruptcy court process, and/or named in a grand jury report.\n\nIt is important to note that inclusion on this list does not necessarily mean that these allegations are true or correct or that the accused Jesuit has been found guilty of a crime or liable for any civil claim. Many of these allegations arise from events that occurred decades after the alleged abuse would have taken place, making it difficult to conduct a complete investigation. In addition, some of these allegations were made after an accused Jesuit died and therefore, he did not have the opportunity to respond for himself.\n\nThe Midwest Province encourages anyone who has been abused by a Jesuit to contact the appropriate civil authorities and also Marjorie O’Dea, Director of the Office of Safe Environment at 773-975-6876 or via mail to: 1010 N Hooker St., Chicago, IL 60642.\"\n\nSection One\n\nMidwest Province Jesuits with an established allegation of sexual abuse of a minor.\n\nThis section contains the names of Jesuits against whom an established allegation of sexual abuse of a minor was made and investigated while the Jesuit was living or against whom multiple established allegations were received after his death. While an allegation received after a Jesuit is deceased does not provide the opportunity for the Jesuit to respond, multiple allegations against a Jesuit may indicate a corroborative pattern of abuse which support the conclusion of established allegations.
