        "text": "For the fourth consecutive session, Jesuit-educated alumni comprise ten percent of Congress. Among the 535 members (and six non-voting delegates) of the 118th United States Congress, 54 graduated from Jesuit colleges and universities: 14 in the Senate and 40 in the House of Representatives.\n\nJesuit-educated members are well-represented in leadership positions in both the Senate and the House. In the Senate, Senator John Barrasso (R-WY, Georgetown) serves as Chair of the Senate Republican Conference, while Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL, Georgetown) serves as Democratic Whip and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV, Gonzaga) serves as Vice Chair of the Democratic Outreach Committee. In the House, Representative Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY, Georgetown) serves as Democratic Leader; he is the first African-American to hold the role. Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA, Georgetown) serves as Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nFifteen of the nation’s Jesuit colleges and universities are currently represented by alumni in the 118th U.S. Congress. Georgetown University has the most with a total of 25, followed by Boston College with six alumni and Fordham University with five alumni (note: Representative Rosa DeLauro is an alumna of Marymount College, which was later incorporated by Fordham University). The College of the Holy Cross has three alumni; Loyola University Chicago, Marquette University, Santa Clara University and the University of Detroit Mercy have two alumni represented; and Creighton University, Gonzaga University, Loyola Marymount University, Regis University, Saint Louis University, Saint Peter’s University and the University of San Francisco each have one alum.\n\nIn addition to the 54 alumni from Jesuit colleges and universities who are serving in the 118th U.S. Congress, there are several who are graduates of Jesuit high schools.\n\nAJCU’s president, Rev. Michael J. Garanzini, S.J., said, “We are proud of the achievements of our alumni, but even more so of their commitment to public service. A Jesuit education is dedicated to serving the common good. We look forward to working with these alumni as they work across the aisle to address our nation’s challenges.”\n\nSee full list of Jesuit college and university alumni below; bold names indicate new members.\n\nUnited States Senate (14)\n\nUnited States House of Representatives (40)\n\n*Marymount College was later incorporated by Fordham University."
