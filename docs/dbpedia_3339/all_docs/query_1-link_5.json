Lovell said. \"Owen's commitment to thoughtful processes and transparent decision making will be beneficial to Marquette.\"\n\nLovell added, \"I am incredibly grateful to John Ferraro who chaired the board the past three years. John provided tremendous counsel and guidance to me in my first three years as Marquette's president.\"\n\nSullivan served in multiple roles at ManpowerGroup, including CEO of Jefferson Wells, Right Management and Experis, as well as leader of ManpowerGroup's global sales organization. Prior to that, he worked as a management consultant with several venture capital and private equity groups.
