Mike Sullivan worked in almost every aspect of radio broadcasting from DJ to Station Manager during his 44-year career, but he is best known for his deep commitment to local news and sports in the Eau Claire market. His enthusiastic work on the air and behind the scenes was instrumental in the growth of sports radio broadcasting in Wisconsin. He called more than 3,600 local games in 30-plus states and, in 1992, turned WBIZ Radio in Eau Claire into the stateâ€™s first all-sports station. He also mentored many young announcers who went on to successful careers in other markets.

Sullivan attended Swarthmore College and the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, and he graduated from Brown Institute in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He broke into broadcasting in 1971 as an overnight disc jockey at WMKC-FM in Oshkosh and, in 1974, joined the Eau Claire stations of what is now iHeartMedia. He worked as part of a Marconi Award-winning morning-show team at WBIZ-FM, where he was on-air for approximately 6,000 shows. As a reporter, he won several awards for documentaries and spot news coverage.

Hall of Fame

The Wisconsin Broadcasters Hall of Fame was created in 1989 to honor those broadcasters who have devoted their careers to broadcasting and its development in Wisconsin, to recognize their outstanding service to broadcasting, their communities, and their state, over at least a fifteen-year career in the industry, at least ten of which were served in Wisconsin.The first twelve members of the Hall of Fame were inducted during the 1989 WBA Summer Conference. Inductees are chosen each year from among nominations by WBA members. Broadcasters who have been inducted into the Hall of Fame include managers, personalities, engineers, reporters and those broadcasting pioneers who were at once all of the above.

In October, 1989, Alfred C. Sykes, then Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, came to Wisconsin to formally dedicate a Hall of Fame display, including plaques honoring the inductees, at the State Historical Society of Wisconsin Library in Madison. In 2010, due to remodeling of the SHSW facility, the display was removed. The Hall of Fame exhibit was relocated to the Hilton Milwaukee City Center in 2015 and enhanced with a touchscreen display featuring all inductee commemorative videos.
