        "text": "I’m still clearing my feet with reviews that kept hot on the griddle over the awards season logjam; I’m stoked about future blu-ray releases from Radiance films, including Fernando Di Leo’s The Boss and Jacques Rivette’s L’amour fou, regular readers will know these two film-makers are what I go to school for. Radiance have many of the old Raro Video movies on their books, and so I always pay attention to their schedule.\n\nSome off-the-beaten track experiences suggested that Mario Bava was all I needed to know about early 60’s Italian Gothic horror; Radiance did a good job disabusing me of such lazy notions, and a double-disk blu-ray of 1962’s melodrama The Horrible Dr. Hichcock certainly gave me a steer in the right direction. Directed by Riccardo Freda and written by Ernesto Hastaldi, it’s got the eye-candy colour-coding that makes Bava’s work such a delight to see in HD, but also had a different set of directorial quirks to make it worth seeking out in its own right.\n\nIt’s supposedly London circa 1885, although the exterior architecture is very clearly Italian Rome; that’s not much of a problem in such dreamy, nightmare narrative. Dr. Hitchcock, sorry, Dr. Hichcock (Robert Flemyng) is an esteemed and respected surgeon, with even the local law enforcement in thrall to him. But the good doctor is a bit of a fully qualified pervo in his private life, and seems to enjoy drugging his compliant wife Margaretha (Maria Teresa Vianello). Their sex-game goes tits up and she dies, but twelve years later, the doctor is up to his old tricks with new wife Cynthia (genre queen Barbara Steele). She takes her place as the second Mrs de Winter in his household, but begins to sense something is amiss. Is the doctor priming her for a fate worse than death, or is the spirit of Margaretha haunting the house, or could both scenarios be happening at once?\n\nThe authorities begin to suspect that Hichcock is ‘a little odd’; ‘No more than any other man of genius,’ we’re told. But although there’s no gore or sex here, it’s clear that the subject of this film is, look away now, yer actual necrophilia, and that’s something of a shock for a film made back in 1962. Yet while the atmosphere is dark and dank, the visuals are often sensational; look at the beams of light that fall on Margaretha’s rainy funeral, or the colour flashes which illuminate the action like lightning- films like this are pop-art sensations, and blu-ray brings out the best in them. The medical aspects are also lurid, like the licking flames via which the doctor sterilises his instruments, or the detail about his patented research into anaesthetics on which he stakes his reputation.\n\nItalian Gothic is a genre with style to burn, with black cats called Jezebel, floor to ceiling portraits of the dead that oppress the living, skulls on pillows and keyhole shots; with no bloodletting at all, there’s something to be said for the restraint of these genre entries, which forces the film-makers to greater heights of the imagination. The action might be a little slow, and the score a little frenzied, but if you came to scoff at the Hitchcock-ian borrowings here, you’ll converted; the horrible Dr. Hichcock isn’t horrible at all, in fact, it’s quite a hypnotic little minor gem.\n\nhttps://www.radiancefilms.co.uk/products/the-horrible-dr-hichcock-le\n\nLIMITED EDITION BLU-RAY SPECIAL FEATURES\n\nNew 2023 2K restoration of the film from the original negative presented in three versions across two Blu-rays:\n\nDisc 1: the original 87-minute Italian version The Horrible Dr. Hichcock [L’orrible segreto del Dr. Hichcock]; and the English dub of the complete 87-minute Italian cut Raptus: The Secret of Dr. Hichcock;\n\nDisc 2, exclusive to the limited edition: the re-ordered 76-minute North American version The Horrible Dr. Hichcock\n\nAudio commentary by critics Kat Ellinger and Annie Rose Malamet\n\nAudio commentary by Tim Lucas analysing the different versions and distribution history of the film\n\nNew interview with screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi (2023)\n\nVisual essay on Bluebeard in gothic film by Miranda Corcoran (2023)\n\nAn interview with Madeleine Le Despencer on necrophilia and taboo gothic (2023)\n\nTrailer\n\nGallery\n\nReversible sleeve featuring designs based on original posters\n\nLimited edition booklet featuring new writing by critic and author Chris Fujiwara on the film; an archival piece by Alan Y.
