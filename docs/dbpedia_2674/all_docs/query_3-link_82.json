        "text": "Upon its theatrical release in late 2008, David Fincher's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button drew comparisons — both favorable and unfavorable — to Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump. In addition to sharing the same screenwriter, Eric Roth, both movies are uncannily similar in their narrative structure.\n\nBoth tell the story of a disadvantaged young man underestimated by everyone he meets, who goes on to live an extraordinary life punctuated by a colorful cast of supporting characters and some of the most important historical events of the 20th century. Oh, and let's not forget the present-day narration framing device, as well as a main character pining after a close childhood friend who never really gives him the time of day until one of them becomes fabulously wealthy.\n\nFor More on David Fincher:\n\nFight Club Still Has One of the Best Movie Twists, But Don't Overthink It\n\nLouis Leterrier Explains How David Fincher’s Se7en Influenced Look of The Incredible Hulk\n\nIt’s a miracle that 'Alien 3' ever got out of development hell\n\nAre Forrest Gump and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Basically the Same Movie?\n\n\"I think people are reading a little more into that. I know they've made some things out of certain things that have unconsciously gone in, but they’re quite different movies,\" Roth said during an interview with Games Radar in 2009. \"The biggest thing that is similar is probably the picturesque, incidental things. In its own way, Benjamin is a much more mature movie. It deals with a man’s life. Forrest Gump deals with his times.\"\n\nTo say the scribe simply ripped off his own Oscar-winning screenplay for Gump and called it a day would be something of an inequitable claim, because, like Gump, Benjamin Button was adapted from pre-existing literary source material, specifically a 1922 short story by The Great Gatsby author, F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n\nNow, aside from the basic premise of a man who ages backwards, entering the world as an old man and leaving it as an infant, the short story and its feature-length translation are vastly different animals. The late Roger Ebert summed it up best in his review, writing: \"Fitzgerald wrote a comic farce, which Roth has made a forlorn elegy.\"\n\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing. In fact, the two compliment each other quite nicely. The short story, for example, reflects the carefree and whimsical attitude of the pre-Depression/Jazz Age period in which Fitzgerald penned his seminal works. The movie, on the other hand, offers up a sobering, postmodern view of the world, ruminating on the fragility of life and the tragic shattering of American naïveté in the wake of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina — the later of which features heavily in Benjamin Button's contemporary framing device.\n\nThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button: Main Differences Between F.
