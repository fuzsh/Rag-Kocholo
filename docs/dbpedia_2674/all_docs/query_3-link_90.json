Warning: there may be SPOILERS ahead…\n\nOn his character:\n\nHe's the badass, knife-throwing, sword-wielding member of the Hellfire Club and it means I get to slice up loads of CIA agents. I'm an old lefty and I wanted to turn him into a Comrade because it's the Cold War, I wanted to push the idea that he's a Russian baddie.\n\nOn the future for his character, it doesn't sound like we get to see him father Nightcrawler yet, but it might be in the next movie:\n\nHe's the father of the teleporting Nightcrawler. Mystique and Azazel have a ding-dong and their kid is Alan Cumming, which I'd be happy with. I can see a resemblance there. In the next film, hopefully I get to kiss Jennifer Lawrence.\n\nAnd on nearly being in X-Men: The Last Stand when Matthew Vaughn was attached to direct:\n\nI was all ramped up and ready to play Beast originally [before Kelsey Grammar got the role]. I went over and did my camera tests and stuff.\n\nThese are excerpts from an article at the Coventry Telegraph, which is apparently sourced from a fuller interview in Comic Heroes.\n\nX-Men: First Class is released on June 1 in the UK and June 3 in the USA.\n\nDISCLAIMER: ComicBookMovie.com is protected under the DMCA (Digital Millenium Copyright Act) and...
