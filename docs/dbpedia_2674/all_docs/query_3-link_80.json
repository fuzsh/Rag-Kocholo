        "text": "\"I know you think you found something out there. Or something found him...\" Vertical has revealed a full official trailer for an indie horror thriller titled Refuge, made by the acclaimed Finnish action filmmaker Renny Harlin - also of The Strangers; Chapter 1. Apparently he was already in Bulgaria shooting Ninja Fury when local producers contacted him about making Refuge next. After a mysterious attack from a malevolent demon during his tour of duty in Afghanistan, Sergeant Rick Pedroni returns home a changed man, and more dangerous than ever. This is similar to many other solider-returns-home-damaged films but with a supernatural PTSD twist. The film stars Aston McAuley as Rick, Sophie Simnet as his wife Kate, Raza Jaffrey, Johanna Harlin, Shervin Alenabi, Atanas Srebrev, Max Kraus, and Jason Flemyng. This mostly looks like generic horror mashed up with a soldier story, though it does have some scary scenes in it.\n\nHere's the full official trailer (+ poster) for Renny Harlin's film Refuge, direct from YouTube:"
