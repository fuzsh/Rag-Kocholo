        "text": "BY SARA REINEKE\n\nWhile navigating through the labyrinth of collectibles, comic books, and dealer tables at the New York Comic Con this past October, I came upon a vendor selling copies of old horror films. As is usual, I had to stop for a moment and thumb through the boxes of DVDs and Blu-rays labeled simply as â€œClassic Horror.â€ There were, of course, the standard bearers that you would expect to find; such black and white Universal classics as The Wolfman (1941) and Frankenstein (1931), as well as such latter-age British horror favorites as Vincent Priceâ€™s Theatre of Blood (1973).\n\nContinuing to flip through the boxes, I was surprised to see The Horrible Dr. Hichcock (1964), a mostly obscure Italian horror film that I had never had the opportunity to see. In truth, Iâ€™d never even heard of the film before â€“ and before you scold me for my ignorance, please keep in mind Iâ€™m only nineteen years old. Even Jason and Freddy Krueger are old-school to me. Still, I admit my immediate thought was that this copy of The Horrible Dr. Hichcock was likely misplaced. Was this little known film deserving of having been sandwiched between the revered classics of Universal and Hammer Studios?\n\nShortly afterwards, the Olive Films Blu-ray of The Horrible Dr. Hichcock dropped into my mailbox. Now that Iâ€™ve finally gotten the chance to watch the film, I realize the suspenseful and eerie tale is indeed a worthy addition to the canon of â€œClassic Horror.â€\n\nOlive Films new Blu-ray release of The Horrible Dr. Hichcock brings â€“ if you excuse the expression â€“ â€œnew lifeâ€ to this now half-century old and unsettling melodrama. Dr. Bernard Hichcock (Robert Flemyng) seems an OK guy. Heâ€™s a celebrated and much admired surgeon, but also a tortured soul hiding a perverse secret. Heâ€™s completely given to necrophilic fantasies, of which his wife Margaret (Teresa Fitzgerald) is strangely accepting and willing to indulge her husbandâ€™s strange desires. However, things take a tragic turn when the not-so-good Dr. unintentionally kills her with an accidental overdose of the anesthetic, emphasizing that there can in fact be too much of a good thing.\n\nThe film then flashes forward several years. Dr. Hichcock returns from a long absence from the village, returning to his old stately home with a new paramour: the understandably jittery Cynthia (played by Italian â€œScream Queenâ€ Barbara Steele of Black Sunday and Nightmare Castle fame). It isnâ€™t long before things again turn weird as Cynthia begins to see the apparition of Hichcockâ€™s former wife walking the estate grounds. She is tormented by the spirit.\n\nDespite the filmâ€™s somewhat confusing plotline, the movie possesses what I like to call â€œthe Universal Horror aesthetic.â€ The film is rife with the atmospheric elements I look forward to in every classic horror film: eerie fog, misty graveyards, a creaking near-abandoned manor, and a devilish doctor who, more likely than not, is up to something no good. As these elements are all welcomingly in place here, The Horrible Dr. Hichcock was deservedly slotted in the â€œClassic Horrorâ€ section at Comic Con. Or perhaps it was the moments of suspense and mystery that, when moodily combined with Roman Vladâ€™s ominously eerie score, left me guessing about who (or what) might be waiting behind every corner of the dreary house.\n\nThere are many such memorable moments of mystery and apprehension in The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. I found the film somewhat reminiscent of The House on Haunted Hill and The Haunting, as there are so many twists that the audience is constantly forced to change their minds about what might happen next. Whether due to a less than cohesive script or specific choices made by director Robert Hampton to keep things from being too formulaic, The Horrible Dr. Hichcock succeeds in keeping the audience engrossed and guessing. Though I found the ending to be slightly confusing â€“ some elements of the filmâ€™s story threads were not explained to my satisfaction â€“ this is a movie thatâ€™s worthy of a second viewing. Until then, I am content to say that The Horrible Dr. Hichcock has definitely earned a place of honor in my personal library of classic horror."
