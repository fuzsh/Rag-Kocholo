        "text": "CinéSalon: FUNNY FACE (Stanley Donen, 1957)\n\nMuseum of the Moving Image\n\n35th Ave. at 36th St., Astoria\n\nSaturday, February 23, 4:00, and Sunday, February 24, 6:30\n\nFestival runs through March 10\n\n718-777-6800\n\nwww.movingimage.us\n\nThe Museum of the Moving Image’s “See It Big! Costumes by Edith Head” series continues February 23-24 with the “’s wonderful, ’s marvelous” 1957 romantic musical comedy Funny Face. When Quality magazine editor and publisher Maggie Prescott (Kay Thompson) decides she’s after the next big thing, photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire playing a fictionalized version of Richard Avedon, who served as a consultant on the film and took the photos) asks, “Are there no models who can think as well as they look?” So they descend on a “sinister” bookstore in Greenwich Village, Embryo Concepts, to show the intellectual side of star model Marion (real-life model Dovima), but instead Dick believes that the bohemian bookstore’s mousy, idealistic sales clerk, Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn), might just be exactly what they’re looking for, a fresh face with “character, spirit, and intelligence.” Jo is steadfastly averse to the plan at first, until Dick convinces her that it would be a great opportunity for her to see Paris and go to a lecture by her favorite philosopher, professor Emile Flostre (Michel Auclair), the father of empathicalism. So Maggie, Dick, Jo, and their crew head over to France, where Jo will soon be strutting down the runway in a line specially created for her by superstar designer Paul Duval (Robert Flemyng). But once they get to the City of Lights, everything goes more than a bit haywire as haute couture battles counterculture chic.\n\nPartially based on an unproduced show by screenwriter Leonard Gershe called Wedding Bells — which was inspired by the real-life relationship between Avedon and model and actress Doe Nowell — and including four songs from George Gershwin’s 1927 musical, also called Funny Face (and starring Astaire and his sister, Adele), the film is an utter delight from start to finish. Despite an age difference of nearly thirty years, Hepburn and Astaire have genuine chemistry as their characters fall for each other. Unlike 1964’s My Fair Lady, in which Hepburn’s singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon, she does all of her own vocalizing in Funny Face, including a lovely solo on “How Long Has This Been Going On?,” and she uses her childhood dance training to fabulous effect in a stunning modern dance scene in a dark and smoky bohemian club. Astaire is a joy as Avery, particularly in the dazzling solo number “Let’s Kiss and Make Up,” performed with hat, raincoat, and umbrella. And Thompson, in her only major film role — she was already in the midst of her four-book children’s series about Eloise, the girl who lives in the Plaza Hotel in New York City — gets things going with the glorious opener “Think Pink!,” her character inspired by Harper’s Bazaar editors Carmel Snow and Diana Vreeland. Among the other songs by George and Ira Gershwin are “On How to Be Lovely,” “He Loves and She Loves,” “Clap Yo’ Hands,” and “Bonjour, Paris!” The costumes, of course, are spectacular, courtesy of Edith Head and Hubert de Givenchy, as are Eugene Loring’s choreography and Stanley Donen’s direction as the story roams around many of Paris’s iconic locations. Everything about the film, which was nominated for four Oscars but came up empty, is fun and fashionable, including cameos by model Suzy Parker; Carole Eastman, who would go on to write Five Easy Pieces and The Fortune; Hepburn’s mother; and a group of girls dressed up like French children’s book favorite Madeline.\n\nFunny Face is screening at MoMI on February 23 at 4:00 and February 24 at 6:30; “See It Big! Costumes by Edith Head” continues through March 10 with such other films as René Clair’s I Married a Witch, Bob Fosse’s Sweet Charity, and Alfred Hitchcock’s To Catch a Thief, The Birds, and Marnie. Head was nominated for thirty-five Academy Awards during her prestigious career, winning the Oscar eight times.\n\nTHE TOWERING INFERNO (John Guillermin, 1974)\n\nQuad Cinema\n\n34 West 13th St. between Fifth & Sixth Aves.\n\nSaturday, August 19, 8:15, and Wednesday, August 23, 3.30\n\nSeries runs August 18-24\n\nquadcinema.com\n\nwww.ifcfilms.com\n\nDisaster flicks were a big thing in the 1970s, and none was bigger than The Towering Inferno. The $14.3 million epic, the first coproduction between two major studios, Warner Bros. and 20th Century-Fox, was based on two novels, Richard Martin Stern’s The Tower and Thomas N. Scortia and Frank M. Robinson’s The Glass Inferno and stars a host of Hollywood greats, led by the dynamic duo of Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. Newman is recently retired architect Doug Roberts, who has come back to San Francisco for the opening-night party celebrating the final building he designed, the 138-story Glass Tower, owned by wealthy businessman James Duncan (William Holden). When a small electrical fire starts in a storage room on the eighty-first floor, Roberts becomes suspicious that Duncan’s son-in-law, smarmy electrical engineer Roger Simmons (Richard Chamberlain), did not follow the specs exactly and cut critical corners. As the fire grows, security chief Harry Jernigan (O. J. Simpson) calls in the fire department, anchored by battalion chief Mike O’Hallorhan (McQueen) and his right-hand man, Kappy (Don Gordon). O’Hallorhan insists that Duncan move the elegant party in the Promenade Room on the 135th floor to the lobby, but by the time Duncan agrees, the flames have spread and escape options become more and more limited — and dangerous. Among the others struggling to survive are con man Harlee Claiborne (Fred Astaire, earning his sole Oscar nomination), his potential target, Lisolette Mueller (Jennifer Jones, in her last performance), U.S. senator Gary Parker (Robert Vaughn), slick public relations man Dan Bigelow (Robert Wagner), his secretary and mistress, Lorrie (Susan Flannery), Duncan’s daughter, Patty Duncan Simmons (Susan Blakely), the deaf Mrs. Allbright (Carol McEvoy) and her two children, Angela (Carlena Gower) and Phillip (The Brady Bunch’s Mike Lookinland), and Roberts’s fiancée, Susan Franklin (Faye Dunaway). Meanwhile, throughout it all, bartender Carlos (Gregory Sierra) remains cool and calm.\n\nIn spectacular scene after spectacular scene, director John Guillermin (Waltz of the Toreadors, King Kong), screenwriter Stirling Silliphant (In the Heat of the Night, Village of the Damned), and action director, producer, and disaster-movie king Irwin Allen (The Lost World, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea) ups the ante as Roberts and O’Hallorhan play the heroes against corporate greed. “Jim, I think you suffer from an edifice complex,” Roberts tells Duncan. A huge hit when it was released in 1974, The Towering Inferno received eight Oscar nominations, winning for best song (“We May Never Love Like This Again,” sung by Maureen McGovern), Best Production Design, and Best Cinematography, by Fred J. Koenekamp and Joseph Biroc, who capture daring aerial shots and dazzling stunts. If the film resembles The Poseidon Adventure, that’s no, er, accident; the 1972 disaster film was also produced by Allen, with a score by John Williams and an Oscar-nominated theme song sung by McGovern (“The Morning After”). The Towering Inferno has taken on new meaning since 9/11, but it’s not as upsetting as you might think, although it is particularly difficult watching a few people jump or fall out of the building. It’s also impossible not to smirk when you see O.J. in a uniform, playing a heroic character. Newman and McQueen — the latter, as was his wont, insisted on equal billing and the same number of lines of dialogue as Newman — make a terrific duo, their stunning blue eyes fighting for equal screen time as well. And somehow the film avoids getting overly soapy and maudlin like so many of its brethren were. A true disasterpiece, The Towering Inferno is screening August 19 and 23 in the fab Quad series “Disasterpieces,” which runs August 18-24 and includes such other genre hits and duds as Airport and Airport ’75, Earthquake (but not in Sensurround), Black Sunday, The Poseidon Adventure, A Night to Remember, Two-Minute Warning, Airplane!, and the flop that ended the glut, 1980’s When Time Ran Out.\n\nStudio 54\n\n254 West 54th St. between Seventh & Eighth Aves.\n\nTuesday – Sunday through January 15, $47-$167\n\n212-719-1300\n\nwww.roundabouttheatre.org\n\nSitting in the lobby in any of several theater district Holiday Inn hotels, watching people come and go, is likely to be more pleasurable than sitting in Studio 54, watching the Roundabout production of the Goodspeed musical Holiday Inn. Mark Sandrich’s 1942 movie was nominated for Best Original Score and Best Original Story, but music director-conductor Andy Einhorn and orchestrator Larry Blank sap all of the charm and rhythm from Irving Berlin’s songs, while director Gordon Greenberg and Chad Hodge’s book makes all the wrong changes to the plot, aside from wisely dropping the infamous “Abraham” minstrel scene. Singer-composer Jim Hardy (Bryce Pinkham), dancer Ted Hanover (Corbin Bleu), and chanteuse Lila Dixon (Megan Sikora) are a moderately successful song-and-dance team seeking their big break. Immediately after Jim proposes to Linda, he proposes that they give up show business and move to the farm he just bought in Midville, Connecticut; their manager, Danny (Lee Wilkof), then scores the trio a major gig in Chicago. Jim is heartbroken when Lila says she’d rather go out on the road with Ted. “But Lila, we promised each other that when the gigs dried up we’d get out of show business and live a normal life,” Jim implores. “I’ve always wanted to be normal. After I’m famous,” Lila replies. Jim sticks to his guns, deciding to go to the farm, where he will wait for Lila to join him after she and Ted finish their shows. Arriving at his new home, Jim meets the downtrodden Linda Mason (Lora Lee Gayer), the previous owner of her family’s farm who had defaulted on the mortgage, allowing Jim to buy it.\n\nIt takes about three seconds to figure exactly where the story is going, and lo and behold, that is precisely where it ends up. The songs, which were taken from the film as well as other sources, are staged by Greenberg (Guys and Dolls, Working) and choreographer Denis Jones (Honeymoon in Vegas, Pieces of My Heart: The Bert Berns Story) in either overly silly or melodramatic ways, zapping the spirit from “White Christmas,” “Blue Skies,” “Steppin’ Out with My Baby,” “Heat Wave,” “Cheek to Cheek,” and “Easter Parade,” while the costumes, by Alejo Vietti (Beautiful: The Carol King Musical, Allegiance), are either too mundane or too over-the-top. Pinkham (A Gentleman’s Guide to Love & Murder, The Heidi Chronicles) and Gayer (Doctor Zhivago, Follies) are pleasant enough in the roles performed in the film by Bing Crosby and Marjorie Reynolds, respectively, but Bleu (High School Musical, Godspell) doesn’t have enough vocal range or pizzazz as Ted, played in the film by Fred Astaire, and Sikora (Under My Skin, Curtains) is miscast in the Virginia Dale part; it’s as if she is in a different show. And Megan Lawrence (The Pajama Game, Urinetown) just plain tries too hard in the thankless role of Louise, who has been added for comic relief but quickly grows tedious, as does Morgan Gao as Charlie Winslow, a ten-year-old Midville banker. (Don’t ask.) Aside from a couple of funny Connecticut jokes, this Holiday Inn is not a place where anyone should stay.\n\nThe Jewish Museum\n\n1109 Fifth Ave. at 92nd St.\n\nDaily through August 7, $15 (free admission Saturday, pay-what-you-wish Thursday 5:00 – 8:00)\n\n212-423-3200\n\nwww.thejewishmuseum.org\n\nwww.isaacmizrahi.com\n\n“I feel like a filmmaker/playwright trapped in the body of a fashion designer . . . seriously,” Isaac Mizrahi says on the audioguide accompanying the sensational exhibition “Isaac Mizrahi: An Unruly History,” continuing at the Jewish Museum through August 7. Exhibition organizers Chee Pearlman and Kelly Taxter have done a fabulous job of creating a compelling narrative arc to the show, brilliantly bathing visitors in Mizrahi’s intense love of color (“Color is the biggest luxury there is.”), wild sense of humor (“I think that the ability to laugh at myself sets me apart. I don’t understand people without humor, and I just don’t like certain things because they have no humor.”), and proud dedication to both high and low culture, from movies and television to opera, theater, and art, from Woody Allen, Fred Astaire, and Bette Davis to The Red Shoes, Lucille Ball, and Egyptian hieroglyphics. The show also explores the Brooklyn-born-and-raised Mizrahi’s creative expression in a number of different media. Splendid fashion drawings, which are works of art on their own, cover two walls; the designer works out ideas for potential outfits in these small sketches of tall, thin models, their bodies filling the paper from top to bottom. Another room is like a runway through his career as a costume designer for choreographers Mark Morris and Twyla Tharp and as designer and director for the Opera Theatre of St. Louis, for whom he created playful, fantastical costumes and a dazzling blue satin dress with one of the longest trains you’re ever likely to see, wrapping around a staircase and across the floor (for the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute). Another section sits the audience down for a montage of his numerous television and movie appearances, including hosting several programs of his own, competing on Celebrity Jeopardy!, guest judging on Project Runway, starring in his own one-man show (Les MIZrahi), selling his clothes at Target and on QVC, and making cameos galore. “Isaac is a polymath of many talents and does not take himself too seriously in that he doesn’t see himself as a grand fashion figure. What he is . . . is what you see,” Pearlman says on the audioguide. “There is an instant, infectious warmth to him. He channels a light, happy, joyous spirit which he unleashes in his clothing.”\n\nDozens of mannequins are adorned with Mizrahi’s unique designs, which reveal his personality, style, and endless ingenuity, which was first brought to the general public’s attention in the innovative 1995 documentary Unzipped. “Baby Bjorn Ballgown” is a striking red dress with a place for an infant in the front (“The birth of a child should be integrated into a woman’s social life.”). “The Real Thing” is a pailette dress made from flattened Coke cans, a sly riff on consumerism. “Desert Storm” celebrates camouflage in a new way. “Extreme Kilt” reimagines the Scottish traditional garb in cashmere flannel (“There’s a million rules about kilts, and about plaids, and I thought it was hilarious and I liked knowing everything about it and then being able to absolutely destroy this knowledge.”) “Kitchen Sink Pink Dress” was influenced by neon-light artist Dan Flavin, “Exploded Tulip” was based on an Irving Penn photograph, and “Grand Pupa” takes its name from its cocoonlike shape and the name of the leader of Fred Flintsone’s lodge. The exhibition also includes a series of photographs Nick Waplington took of Mizrahi at work from 1989 to 1993, clips from dance and theater performances that Mizrahi designed, directed, and/or appeared in, and a room of such accessories as “Lobster Epaulet,” “Cardboard Boater,” “Fox Piece,” “Spring Heeled Heels,” and “Campaign Box Clutch.” At the center of it all, Mizrahi’s love of life and fashion shine through, highlighting a fascinating rebel who has always insisted on doing things his own way. “I’m just going to be myself,” he says. To give as many people as possible a chance to see this superb midcareer retrospective, the Jewish Museum will be open on Wednesday (when it’s usually closed) and has extended viewing hours to 8:00 on Saturday (when it’s free) and Sunday.\n\nCinéSalon: FUNNY FACE (Stanley Donen, 1957)\n\nFrench Institute Alliance Française, Florence Gould Hall\n\n55 East 59th St. between Madison & Park Aves.\n\nTuesday, April 7, $13, 4:00 & 7:30\n\nFestival runs April 7 – May 26\n\n212-355-6100\n\nwww.fiaf.org\n\nThe French Institute Alliance Française’s third annual “Fashion at Fiaf” festival kicks off April 7 with the “’s wonderful, ’s marvelous” 1957 romantic musical comedy Funny Face.

The series continues through May 26 with such other films as Lisa Immordino Vreeland’s Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel, John Cassavetes’s Gloria, Jean Renoir’s The Rules of the Game, and Jean Negulesco’s How to Marry a Millionaire. “Fashion at Fiaf” also includes talks with Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez of Proenza Schouler, Kate Betts, and Garance Doré and a gallery show of the work of photographer Grégoire Alexandre."
