        "meta_description": "With the approach of war in the late 1930s, changes in censorship allowed industrial disputes to be portrayed on British screens for the first time. The working class community was portrayed in It Always Rains on Sunday to better effect as compared to Passport to Pímlíco. Another film was London Belongs to Me, which like the novel on which it is based, opens just before the Second World War. The characters' attempts to climb the social ladder always fail. Deference is another characteristic apparent in both the dialogue and the acting. As a snapshot of British industrial practices, Chance of a Lifetime makes Correlli Barnett seem restrained in his criticisms. The factory is outdated and ill kept, while the factory owner is autocratic and out of touch with his workforce.",
