Does it say in the script: “Now light a cigarette” or did directors just tell them to smoke when they wanted to? J Abnett, Fowey, Cornwall",

        "text": "It was far worse than either of the alternatives you suggest. According to a study 10 years ago of smoking in Hollywood films in the 1930s and 1940s, stars were often sponsored by cigarette companies to promote their products on screen.\n\nThe study revealed, among other examples, that in 1937-38 American Tobacco paid the likes of Gary Cooper, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable and Spencer Tracy $10,000 each (about £130,000 at today’s prices) to promote their Lucky Strike brand.\n\nMore than half the leading film stars were contracted to tobacco companies which spent in a single year well over £2million at today’s values to give their products a strong and healthy image in films.\n\nWith directors and film companies also being paid, smoking in films became highly profitable.\n\nA few weeks ago you mentioned Roger Moore’s claim to have invented the Magnum ice cream on a stick. Correct me if I’m wrong but in the 1950s wasn’t there an “ice cream lolly on a stick” named after the ventriloquist’s puppet Archie Andrews? If you joined the Archie Andrews Club you could collect the wrappers and redeem them for various items. And did Julie Andrews make her singing debut on the Archie Andrews Show?\n\nIan Sentence, British Columbia, Canada\n\nAs far as I can tell, the Archie Andrews Lolly On A Stick was just a normal ice lolly rather than having ice cream inside but you’re quite right about collecting the wrappers.\n\nArchie Andrews was the puppet of ventriloquist Peter Brough and was the star of Educating Archie, which was one of the first ventriloquist acts to perform the remarkable feat of succeeding on the radio.\n\nJulie Andrews (no relation) did indeed appear on the Archie Andrews show in 1951 at only 15 but her solo singing career had begun at the London Hippodrome just after her 12th birthday.\n\nAre atoms alive?\n\nJames Reisner (age six), Surbiton, Greater London\n\nGreat question, James! Every part of us is made of atoms and we are alive, so you could say that our atoms are alive too but that leads to the question of what we mean by life anyway.\n\nArguably, anything with an electric charge is alive until that charge fades away and dies. That applies to atoms but it’s rather an extreme view.\n\nThe feature we usually look for before saying that something is alive is the ability to reproduce.\n\nAnimals produce more animals; plants produce seeds which grow into more plants; but an atom cannot produce another atom.\n\nAll those creatures and plants however are made of atoms, so you could say the atoms get together to form organisms that can reproduce.\n\nTo adapt a line from the early Star Trek episodes, it’s a sort of life, but not as we know it.\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Is it a punnet of strawberries or a posy of flowers?\n\nJack Pottle, Barking, Essex\n\nA “pottle” in the late 18th and 19th centuries was a basket, usually conical, for strawberries.\n\nTobias Smollett, in his novel The Expedition Of Humphry Clinker, referred to “a pottle of fine strawberries”, while Benjamin Disraeli, in Endymion, sadly lamented “one never sees a pottle of strawberries now”.\n\nIn even earlier times a pottle was a word for a pot or tankard, especially one containing half a gallon of liquid, and that measure was also referred to as a pottle.\n\nI do not know how your ancestors acquired the name but in the 19th century, “pottlebodied” was a description applied to the overweight.\n\nThe House of Commons restaurant has recently been reported to have changed the name of Spotted Dick to Spotted Richard. When was this pudding first made and how did it get its name?\n\nDW Davenport, Congleton, Cheshire\n\nIt dates from the middle of the 19th century but there are various theories about its name. “Spotted” is a reference to the dried fruit on it but “Dick” is far less clear.\n\nSome dictionaries of the time give “Dick” as a general term for a pudding, possible through the word “pudding” itself becoming “puddink”, “puddick” and finally just “Dick”.\n\nAnother idea is that “Dick” was a variant of the word “dough”, possibly with a connection to the Dutch word “deeg” meaning “dough”.\n\nCalling it Richard is, in my opinion, an example of political correctness gone spotty.\n\nJulia Hartley-Brewer rants after Spotted Dick name change\n\nIs there anything you can’t answer?
