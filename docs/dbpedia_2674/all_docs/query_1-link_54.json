        "text": "Fast X\n\nDespite boasting a healthy 141-minute running time, Fast X is not a complete movie. It has a beginning and a middle but no end. Assured that audiences will return like lemmings for future installments of the Fast/Furious series, the filmmakers see...\n\nFate of the Furious, The\n\nWhat has been true for the past few Fast and Furious outings is even more true for this one: the films have devolved from street racing-centered action/crime thrillers into live action cartoons. Plot and character development are irrelevant. Ac...\n\nFurious Seven\n\nFurious Seven provides what viewers have come to expect from the long-running The Fast and the Furious series: a string of high-octane, physics-defying action scenes loosely connected by a narrative that occasionally makes rudimentary sense. This tim...\n\nHobbs & Shaw\n\nThe full title of Hobbs & Shaw is “Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw.” By referencing the “parent” franchise in the name, Universal Pictures reminds viewers that this is attached to the behemoth franchise that, over the course of e...\n\nHomefront\n\nThere's something almost refreshing about a movie that delivers exactly what's expected of it. With a script developed by Sylvester Stallone and a cast led by Jason Statham, it wouldn't be hard to put together a checklist of obligatory scenes/momen...\n\nIn the Name of the King: A Dungeon Seige Tale\n\nIn the Name of the King is a second-rate regurgitation of The Lord of the Rings. Everything about it, down to the set and costume design, apes Peter Jackson's epic trilogy. However, while The Lord of the Rings was a grand story of scope and power,...\n\nItalian Job, The\n\nThe 2003 version of The Italian Job is less of a straightforward remake of the 1969 picture than it is a complete re-interpretation. Enough has changed that it's possible to see the two films not as the same story separated by three decades, but a...\n\nKiller Elite\n\nDespite having a perfect cast for a title like Killer Elite, Gary McKendry's feature debut comes across as little more than a generic Jason Statham movie with two high-profile guest stars. However, while Clive Owen and Robert De Niro add some star ...\n\nLock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n\nThe tale of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is the most improbable of success stories. After having difficulty securing a financial backer, Guy Ritchie's debut feature became one of the biggest home-grown successes in the U.K. last year. Now...\n\nMechanic, The\n\nSimon West's The Mechanic is a loose remake of the 1972 film starring Charles Bronson. In addition to updating various aspects of the story, the filmmakers have changed elements (most notably the ending) in an attempt to make it more audience frien..."
