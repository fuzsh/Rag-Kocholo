        "text": "Can you remember the last time a movie made your heart race? Neither could I until I was sucked down the adrenalin-filled rabbit hole that is “Hanna.” It’s like an amusement park ride operating in the middle of a rave in which The Chemical Brothers provide a no-one-gets-out-alive thrust of unimpeded propulsion.\n\nThere were times I swear I forgot to breathe, as director Joe Wright engineers a wild, intercontinental chase from Lapland to Morocco and back to Europe via Spain and Germany before arriving at a mind-blowing terminus, all in pursuit of a sweet, but feral looking 16-year-old girl.\n\nHer name, if you haven’t already guessed, is Hanna (Saoirse Ronan), a wild child raised in complete and utter isolation in Finland by an ex-spook of a father (Eric Bana) intent on molding her into the most efficient killing machine the spy world has ever seen. The intrigue resides not in whether or not Pops will succeed, but in the reasons behind his need to turn child rearing into a sadistic form of basic training.\n\nWhat Bana’s Erik puts his daughter through each day would make special-ops soldiers cry out for their mommies. It’s intense, rigorous and, more often than not, brutal. Wright effectively uses the film’s first 15 minutes meritoriously shocking and mesmerizing the viewer by showing Hanna going through her paces: felling a reindeer with an arrow, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Erik and learning to sleep lightly and swing a heavy bamboo stick.\n\nThe natural question is: why? Why is he doing this to this naïve, innocent girl? Patience, Grasshopper, as the WHY soon becomes clear in disturbing detail. And at the heart of it is a maniacal witch of a CIA agent as wicked as her eerie Texas drawl. But as evil as Cate Blanchett’s Marissa Wiegler might seem on her pancake makeup exterior, she’s even more ruthless underneath – as Hanna is about to find out.\n\nIf you’re starting to sense a bit of Jason Bourne déjà vu, you’re not alone. I was, too, until Wright and screenwriters Seth Lochhead and David Farr commenced unveiling the many layers of a movie that’s as much about Hanna as it is about us as a consumer-driven, war-mongering society.\n\nIt’s also about opposites and contrasts, like the brilliant decision to immediately whisk Hanna from the frozen tundra of the Arctic Circle to the blazing-hot sands of Morocco once she feels she’s ready to carry out her life’s mission. It’s almost as wonderful as Wright’s decision to structure “Hanna” like an “Alice in Wonderland”-type fairy tale, complete with an array of heroes and villains, including a deliciously flamboyant scoundrel in Tom Hollander’s funny-scary, Isaacs.\n\nAnd like Alice, Hanna is confronted with danger at nearly every turn while acclimating herself to a strange new world and even stranger people, like the family of clueless tourists she hooks up with in Ouarzazate, Morocco. They are the first “normal” people she’s ever talked to and the first not expecting anything of her.\n\nIt’s exhilarating watching Hanna experience the world for the first time through their eyes – discovering music, fashion, television, friendship and, oh my God!, boys. Her tour guide is the delightfully mischievous and slightly narcissistic Sophie (a terrific Jessica Barden), a teenage drama queen, who shows Hanna the ropes while Hanna teaches her a thing or two about self-preservation. Their relationship is a riot. But it’s also strangely moving and profound, as is the bond Hanna forms with Sophie’s over-protective parents, well played by Olivia Williams and Jason Flemyng.\n\nAs heightened as the emotions are, they always place a distant second to “Hanna’s” chief goal of blowing your mind with imaginatively choreographed action scenes that throb with energy, as our pint-sized heroine tries to outrun Hollander and Blanchett long enough to avoid being forced to show them just how lethal she can be when provoked.\n\nThose scenes, all accompanied by a chest-pounding soundtrack featuring The Chemical Brothers, are just different enough from the Bourne standard to exert their own identity. And much of their success is due to Ronan’s ability to command the screen with an original fix of charming innocence and venomous spit.\n\nHer Hanna isn’t quite as entertaining as “Kick-Ass” dynamo, Hit-Girl, but Ronan makes the underlying emotions far more real and impactful. She’s so good in fact, a second Oscar nomination for the young star, who also dazzled in Wright’s “Atonement,” isn’t out of the question.\n\nDitto for Wright, making a welcome rebound after the poorly received “The Soloist,” which was so bad it actually made Robert Downey Jr. seem boring. But with “Hanna,” the director proves in pulse-quickening certainty that he still has the Wright stuff."
