        "text": "I caught the middle of this film in the wee hours of the morning in the last couple weeks or so! I had it on while I was writing a review and it looked great so I took note of the name of the film and tonight I finally tracked it down and watched it from start to finish!\n\nNormally true stories end up boring the tears out of me! But NOT this one! This one did anything and everything but that and then some!\n\nI'm shocked that I had never heard of this film before now! And YES it is THAT good! Extremely well crafted! It kept me enthralled and when it came to an end I felt I…\n\nI am not overly familiar with Operation Mincemeat but after watching The Man Who Never Was I want to know more. The Man Who Never Was tells an interesting story in a rather conventional way but still manages to make it exciting enough to be a satisfying experience. I don't think this film is perfect but I still had a good time watching it.\n\nThe film follows Ewan Montagu, a Royal Navy Lieutenant Commander, who is tasked with coming up with a cunning plan to deceive the Nazis about an impending invasion of Southern Europe. His solution is to have the dead body of a supposed British officer wash up on shore. In the dead body's possession will be plans…\n\nHandsomely made and nicely paced WW2 espionage film based on true events. The British Royal Navy use a body of a recently deceased man and some carefully manipulated phony documents in a ruse to throw the Nazis off their Sicilian invasion strategy. A rather gripping and detailed procedural film, more about strategy, events and things than people and their passions. Only Gloria Grahame imbues her character with any unique humanity. It’s telling that her character is the only American one, for the British characters are treated with such reverence that their stiff upper lips are on the verge of ossifying and crumbling into dust. Director Ronald Neame is up to the challenge of making inaction and omission compelling, even exciting.…\n\nA significantly more effective covering of Operation Mincemeat than the recent film of the same name.\n\nThat's far from the only reason why The Man Who Never Was works so well though. By skirting around the pointless love triangle that was inexplicably put at the front and centre of John Madden's version, Ronald Neame focuses completely on the procedural aspects to this story. Not just in its planning but also in its execution and aftermath.\n\nIt would be easy to turn this into a contrived mess in its final third but Neame plays it out more logically to the end they were trying to achieve. It's a possible risk because of what we have come to expect in these circumstances…\n\n'The Man Who Never Was' is one of those rather odd attempts to dramatise a minor true incident (subject to the usual disclaimers on changed names and situations) and add it to the huge number of features on the Second World War which were being released in the 1950s.\n\nThe cast is interestingly international - Clifton Webb, better known for appearances in the likes of 'Laura' and 'Cheaper by the Dozen', and Gloria Grahame (who had recently appeared in 'Oklahoma' and 'The Big Heat'), from the USA; Robert Flemyng, Josephine Griffin and Michael Hordern, from England; Stephen Boyd and Cyril Cusack from Ireland; and some memorable small parts from Joan Hickson (who would be Miss Marple on TV a couple…\n\nThe 1950s, Pt. II: 11/100\n\n1956 Ranked\n\nThe Man Who Never Was, directed by Ronald Neame, is based on a true story. It, as with quite a few 1950s and 1960s films, is an attempt to recreate a real mission from World War II. This one is Operation Mincemeat, a plot by the British to convince the Nazis that they were not going to attack Sicily. Having experienced a series of wins in North Africa, the Southern piece of Italy was the only answer. The Nazis knew it and the British knew that they knew. In a desperate ploy for a way to throw them off the obvious scent, the British searched for an answer and found one with Major…"
