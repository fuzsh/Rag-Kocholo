        "text": "Pauline Bonaparte, younger sister to Napoleon, was her brother’s favorite of their seven siblings. She was the only one who took no part in his political power plays. While her siblings were placed on thrones all over Europe, Pauline was quoted as saying: “I do not care for crowns. If I had wished for one, I should have had it; but I left that taste to my relations.”\n\n(Was Napoleon Bonaparte an enlightened leader or tyrant?)\n\nBorn in Ajaccio, Corsica, on October 20, 1780, she was the sixth of the eight children of lawyer Charles-Marie Bonaparte and Maria Letizia Ramolino. Pauline opted for a life of amorous adventure rather than reshaping the political map of Europe. She used her beauty and boldness to conquer a long train of lovers and, despite scandals, won the admiration of the European beau monde as an icon of style.\n\n“Few women have savored more the pleasure of being beautiful,” the French general Louis Stanislas de Girardin wrote of her. For Napoleon himself, she was “the best living creature” and “the only one who never asks for anything.” Though often frivolous and feckless, Pauline had a loyal and courageous side too. She was the only one of his siblings to visit Napoleon (and to help him financially) when he was exiled to the island of Elba in 1814 after his failed military campaign in Russia. During his second banishment, to St. Helena, after his defeat at Waterloo, Pauline even requested to spend time with him on the remote island in the southern Atlantic.\n\n(Napoleon lost the Battle of Waterloo—here’s what went wrong.)\n\nPauline ... was then in the full brilliance of her beauty ... Few women have savored more the pleasure of being beautiful.\n\nLouis Stanislas de Girardin\n\nFamily fortunes\n\nDespite the death of her father when she was five, Pauline grew up in the bosom of a comfortable family until her early teens. Then, in 1793, times got harder: Her brother Lucien became embroiled in a political controversy, forcing the family to flee Corsica for the French mainland. Once in Marseille, they lived in straitened circumstances. That same year, Napoleon first made his name militarily, starting an ascent that would vastly improve his family’s fortunes.\n\nPauline never had the formal education that women of high social standing were expected to have to secure a wealthy husband. At age 15, her beauty was enough to catch the eye of her brother’s military comrades. After a dalliance or two, she fell for the veteran French revolutionary Stanislas Fréron. Entangled with another mistress (and 26 years Pauline’s senior), he was rejected by her mother. No end of suitors appeared. Napoleon told one aspirant, “You have nothing. She has nothing. What does that total? Nothing.” In the end, her brother persuaded her to consider Charles Leclerc. They married in 1797, and a year later the couple’s only son, Dermide, was born.\n\nWife, widow, princess\n\nIn 1801, to quell an ongoing revolution in Saint-Domingue (in what is Haiti today) and protect France’s sugar income from its colony, Napoleon (now first consul) sent Pauline’s husband to the Caribbean to lead 23,000 French soldiers. Pauline and her son followed in 1802. Leclerc achieved initial victories against the rebels, led by Toussaint L’ouverture.\n\n(The Christmas Eve plot to blow up Napoleon.)\n\nLeclerc’s successes were short-lived. Renewed fighting coincided with an outbreak of yellow fever that began to decimate the French troops. Amid declining morale, Pauline provided social diversion, with herself at the center, by hosting balls and fetes. She also turned the family’s mansion into a field hospital. Leclerc urged his wife to return to France, but she refused. Leclerc wrote to Napoleon that she chose to follow her husband’s fortunes for “good or ill.” In November 1802, Leclerc died from yellow fever, and Pauline and her son returned to France.\n\nWhile genuinely grieving her husband’s death, Pauline soon took up romantic liaisons. Her love life would always generate gossip, but it was frequently seized on and exaggerated by Napoleon’s royalist enemies. \"Pauline was often singled out by Bourbon sympathizers as a nymphomaniac who cared not whether her partner or partners were men or women, or, when in Haiti with Leclerc, whether they were his officers or Haitians who opposed the French Army,” says Flora Fraser, author of Pauline Bonaparte: Venus of Empire. “The object was always to damage, by extension, her brother’s reputation.”\n\nNapoleon had his sights set on imperial power and knew that his reputation must be beyond reproach. His sister’s image was bound closely to his, and so, once again, he sought out a new husband for Pauline: The very rich, well-connected Prince Camillo Borghese, whose presence in the family would help Napoleon reinforce ties with French-occupied Italy. They married in June 1803.\n\n(Napoleon's military defeat in Egypt yielded a victory for history.)\n\nFit for a princess\n\nFounder of the French jewelry house Chaumet in 1780, Marie-Étienne Nitot was Napoleon’s official jeweler. This 1811 épis de blés, or ears of wheat, tiara belonged to Pauline. Made of gold and silver and set with diamonds, it sold at auction in 2021 for more than $850,000.\n\nInitially, Pauline approved of the 28-year-old prince’s Mediterranean good looks, not to mention the title of princess, a generous annuity, property, and the use of the celebrated Borghese jewels. But Pauline soon grew disillusioned, and the marriage deteriorated. Among other gibes, she took to calling him “His Serene Idiot.”\n\nPauline’s health had begun to trouble her. In 1804, Prince Borghese took Pauline to the baths of Pisa to recover, but he didn’t allow her to bring along her son. While she was away, the six-year-old contracted a fever and died. Pauline blamed the prince. Their ill-suited match now ruptured, she persuaded Napoleon to allow her to return to Paris, rather than to Rome with Prince Borghese. Despising her husband, she once again took refuge in love affairs."
