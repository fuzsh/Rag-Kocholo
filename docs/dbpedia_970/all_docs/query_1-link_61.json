Who are some of those who did so - or even better do so today?    Here is one  the Countess of Eglinton. The photo below was published in 1909. I initially thought that the Countess was dressed for a Court occasion  but she wasn't wearing feathers which were part of the British Court etiquette at the time.                         quote",
