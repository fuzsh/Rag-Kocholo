        "text": "When contemplating Napoleon, the battlefields of Austerlitz and Waterloo immediately emerge, or perhaps the Napoleonic Code and his educational reforms that introduced the secular lyceum. Bonaparte’s indelible mark on European history is so profound that some contend he could have foreshadowed the European Union in some form. Yet, Napoleon was a complex and sometimes contradictory figure, a confluence of vastly different forces from diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe Emperor of the French was fundamentally a soldier, which elucidates why he perennially sought to address political crises through force, even when such an approach had manifestly become untenable (as after 1814).\n\nHowever, he was also deeply imbued with the Enlightenment rationality that propelled the French Revolution, driving him to streamline and “optimize” decision-making processes, as would be said today. Beneath this veneer, however, lay the deep roots of Mediterranean and Corsican familism."
