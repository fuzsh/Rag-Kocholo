Born in Corsica in 1750, Letizia was the daughter of a minor Italian nobleman and a Corsican woman. In 1764, she married Charles Bonaparte, a Corsican officer, and together they had 13 children. Among them were Napoleon Bonaparte, who would go on to become the Emperor of the French, and Lucien, Jérôme, Elisa, and Pauline, who also held positions of power and influence in Europe. Letizia's influence on her children was profound. She instilled in them a strong sense of ambition, determination, and a deep love for their native Corsica. Despite her humble origins, Letizia was a woman of great intelligence and charm, and she played a crucial role in shaping the destinies of her famous offspring. This portrait, taken in the late 1820s or early 1830s, shows a mature Letizia with a regal bearing and an air of quiet dignity. Her dark eyes, set deep in her face, seem to hold a world of wisdom and experience. The intricate lace collar and elaborate hairstyle are typical of the fashion of the time, but it is Letizia's strong and commanding presence that truly sets her apart. Letizia's life was marked by tragedy as well as triumph. She outlived many of her children, and was widowed twice. But she remained a constant source of support and inspiration to Napoleon, who never forgot the lessons she had taught him as a child. This portrait serves as a poignant reminder of the indelible impact that a mother's love can have on history.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nMADE IN NETHERLANDS\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
