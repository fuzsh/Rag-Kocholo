        "text": "Four years after the marriage of Charles-Marie Bonaparte and the young Letizia Ramolino, Napoléon entered the world in their large yet simple home in the island's capital of Ajaccio, where he spent his formative years alongside his sisters and brothers.\n\nIn 1793 the family moved back to the continent to promote their allegiance with the French Republic, and, apart from a brief visit on returning from Egypt in 1799, Napoléon was destined to never set foot in Corsica again.\n\nThe house was passed between family members over the decades, where it was refurbished and enlarged to suit the current occupants, including Napoléon III and his wife Empress Eugénie.\n\nIn 1923, the house was eventually donated to the State before becoming a national museum in 1967, devoted to the Bonaparte family's time in Corsica. Today, visitors can wander through the rooms and see where the boy Napoléon was born, played and feasted.\n\nThe family's rooms are on the first floor, including the dining room, drawing room and Madame Mère's bedroom where Napoleon was born. Visitors will also get the chance to see with the “Chambre de l'Alcôve” which is thought to have been Napoléon's room on his return from Egypt, not long before he became the de-facto leader of the French Republic.\n\nIf you're interested in visiting Ajaccio and the Maison Bonaparte Museum and want to incorporate it into your charter itinerary, please speak with a recommended yacht charter broker.\n\nAlternatively, you can begin planning your next vacation by viewing the entire fleet of superyachts available for South of France yacht charters."
