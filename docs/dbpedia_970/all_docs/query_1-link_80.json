        "text": "RATING: VERY GOOD\n\nI really enjoyed the book, which also gave a great history lesson. It was a great read about a tumultuous time in history, and I enjoyed getting to know Betsy Bonaparte.\n\nIn the last part of the book Betsy finally managed to do what he had always wanted to leave Baltimore and live in Europe for long periods of time.\n\nBaltimore repelled the British attack, and the Americans also celebrated another victory when the British couldn’t win in Plattsburgh, New York. The Battle of Baltimore was a sea/land battle fought between British invaders and American defenders in the War of 1812. American forces repulsed sea and land invasions off the busy port city of Baltimore, Maryland. Though the Americans retreated, the battle was a successful delaying action that inflicted heavy casualties on the British, halting their advance consequently allowing the defenders at Baltimore to properly prepare for an attack.\n\nThe Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812.\n\nAnother two deaths happened in the family. Octavius died after falling off a horse when he was only twelve. Caroline died shortly afterwards of consumption. Betsy was also sad to read that her friend, Vice-President Gerry, had died of a heart attack.\n\nAt the time Betsy also learnt that Princess Catharine had given Jerome a son, who they named Jerome Bonaparte, the same name as Bo, which infuriated Betsy.\n\nThe Treaty of Ghent on December 24, 1819 put an end to the war between Britain and America. The Treaty of Ghent was the peace treaty that ended the War of 1812 between the United States of America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Both sides signed it on December 24, 1814, in the city of Ghent, United Netherlands. The treaty restored relations between the two nations to status quo ante bellum, restoring the borders of the two countries to the lines before the war started in June 1812.\n\nNapoleon escaped from Elba, gathered an army and marched on Paris. On 26 February 1815, when the British and French guard ships were absent, he slipped away from Portoferraio on board the French brig Inconstant with some 1,000 men and landed at Golfe-Juan, between Cannes and Antibes, on 1 March 1815. The Hundred Days marked the period between Napoleon’s return from exile on the island of Elba to Paris on 20 March 1815 and the second restoration of King Louis XVIII on 8 July 1815 (a period of 110 days)\n\nBetsy decided to travel to Europe to find a good school for her son. First, she goes to England. While in England she heard that the Duke of Wellington had defeated Napoleon in Waterloo. The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near Waterloo in present-day Belgium, then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands. A French army under the command of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by two of the armies of the Seventh Coalition: a British-led Allied army under the command of the Duke of Wellington, and a Prussian army under the command of Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, Prince of Wahlstatt. The battle marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nNapoleon announced his second abdication on 24 June 1815. Allegedly, Napoleon tried to escape to North America, but the Royal Navy was blockading French ports to forestall such a move. Louis XVIII was restored to the throne of France and Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena.\n\nIn England Betsy went to Cheltenham as her doctor advised her to take baths in a spa. There she made the acquaintance of Dr Arthur Brooke Falkener and his wife. Sir Arthur Brooke Faulkner, M.D. (1779–1845) was an Irish physician to the forces, and author. Having retired from the service in 1815, he settled as a physician at Cheltenham.\n\nThe Congress of Vienna redrew the boundaries of Europe and created a balance of power. The Congress of Vienna also called Vienna Congress, was a meeting of ambassadors of European states chaired by Austrian statesman Klemens von Metternich, and held in Vienna from November 1814 to June 1815, though the delegates had arrived and were already negotiating by late September 1814. The objective of the Congress was to provide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. The goal was not simply to restore old boundaries but to resize the main powers so they could balance each other and remain at peace.\n\nAfter Cheltenham Betsy travelled to Paris, and she first contacted the ambassador Albert Gallatin. Abraham Alfonse Albert Gallatin (January 29, 1761 – August 12, 1849) was a Swiss-American politician, diplomat, ethnologist and linguist. Gallatin served as Ambassador to France from 1816 to 1823, struggling with scant success to improve relations with the government during the Bourbon Restoration.\n\nIn Paris Betsy got to know many people. One was the writer David Bailie Warden. David Bailie Warden was a political philosopher, scientist, academic, and revolutionary.\n\nShe also made the acquaintance of several female writers: Madame Germaine de Stael and Reine Philiberte de Varicourt.\n\nAnne Louise Germaine de Staël-Holstein (22 April 1766 – 14 July 1817), commonly known as Madame de Staël, was a French woman of letters of Genevan origin whose lifetime overlapped with the events of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic era. For many years she lived as an exile under the Reign of Terror and under Napoleonic persecution.\n\nReine Philiberte Rouph de Varicourt (1757–1822) was a French lady of letters. The sister of Pierre-Marin Rouph de Varicourt, she was spotted by Voltaire during his stay at Ferney – he made her his adoptive daughter, married her off to the Marquis de Villette.\n\nSydney, Lady Morgan, was a writer whose novels Betsy had read. Sydney, Lady Morgan (25 December 1781? – 14 April 1859), was an Irish novelist, best known as the author of The Wild Irish Girl. She was one of the most vivid and hotly discussed literary figures of her generation. In 1814 she produced her best novel, O’Donnell.\n\nAnother writer Betsy whose acquaintance Betsy made was Francois-Rene de Chateaubriand. François-René (Auguste), vicomte de Chateaubriand (4 September 1768 – 4 July 1848), was a French writer, politician, diplomat and historian who founded Romanticism in French literature.\n\nAntonio Canova was a sculptor that Betsy also got to know. Antonio Canova (1 November 1757 – 13 October 1822) was an Italian Neoclassical sculptor, famous for his marble sculptures. Often regarded as the greatest of the Neoclassical artists, his artwork was inspired by the Baroque and the classical revival, but avoided the melodramatics of the former, and the cold artificiality of the latter. Betsy refers to him when she visits Pauline Bonaparte and sees the sculpture of a Venus, which the princess posed for.\n\nBetsy had promised to her son that she would only be away for one year, but she spent almost two years there. When she returned in 1817, Bo was already twelve and she found that her father had poisoned him against her, and she tried her best to set things right. She also discovered that the housekeeper Providence Summers had borne her father a daughter, called Matilda.\n\nAnother scandal is that her sister-in-law had gone to Europe on account of her asthma, and she heard that she had become a favourite of the Duke of Wellinton, and their circle believed them to be lovers.\n\nIn 1819 the United States was going through a depression. The Panic of 1819 was the first major peacetime financial crisis in the United States followed by a general collapse of the American economy persisting through 1821. The Panic announced the transition of the nation from its colonial commercial status with Europe toward an independent economy, increasingly characterized by the financial and industrial imperatives of central bank monetary policy, making it susceptible to boom and bust cycles.\n\nBetsy and Bo travelled to Europe and went to Geneva. There she enrolled Bo in the Academy of Geneva. While in Geneva Betsy met John Jacob Astor. John Jacob Astor (July 17, 1763 – March 29, 1848) (born Johann Jakob Astor) was a German–American businessman, merchant, real estate mogul and investor who mainly made his fortune in fur trade and by investing in real estate in or around New York City.\n\nShe also made friends with the Polish Princess Caroline Galitzin, Princess Potempkin and Prince Carl.\n\nNapoleon died in 1821. In February 1821, Napoleon’s health began to deteriorate rapidly, and he reconciled with the Catholic Church. He died on 5 May 1821, after confession, Extreme Unction and Viaticum in the presence of Father Ange Vignali.\n\nThrough John Jacob Astor Pauline Bonaparte contacted her as she wanted to meet her and Bo, and in the event of her death she would like to leave Bo a legacy. Pauline Bonaparte is living in Rome. They eventually got to meet. After Waterloo Pauline moved to Rome, where she enjoyed the protection of Pope Pius VII (who once was her brother’s prisoner), as did her mother, Letizia, (then at a palace on the Piazza Venezia) and other members of the Bonaparte family.\n\nThey also met Letizia Bonaparte. Nob. Maria Letizia Buonaparte née Ramolino[1] (Marie-Lætitia Ramolino, Madame Mère de l’Empereur) (24 August 1750 – 2 February 1836) was an Italian noblewoman, mother of Napoleon I of France.\n\nPauline and Letizia mentioned a possible engagement with Charlotte, Joseph Bonaparte’s daughter. Actually, Bo went to New Jersey where Joseph lived, but nothing came out of it.\n\nWhile in Italy, Betsy saw her ex-husband in the Pitti Palace, but they didn’t talk. After that she got a letter from him, saying that she would send her some allowance for Bo.\n\nRobert Patterson died shortly afterwards. Bo was admitted to Harvard in 1823. Betsy went back to Europe while her son was studying. In Florence she enjoyed the friendship of Ferdinand III. Ferdinand III (6 May 1769 – 18 June 1824) was Grand Duke of Tuscany from 1790 to 1801 and, after a period of disenfranchisement, again from 1814 to 1824.\n\nIn 1826 Bo graduated and planned to study law. Betsy was determined for her son to have career in diplomacy and marry someone in Europe. Yet, Bo didn’t share those ambitions and enjoyed his country. Bo also met his father and his family in Italy.\n\nBetsy stayed in Europe for three years, and then she learn through her father that Bo was possibly engaged to an American heiress, Susan May Williams, but in reality Bo was already married to her. Betsy never forgave her father for preventing her from staying with her son in her big day. He was also upset with Bo and they became estranged for a while because Bo hadn’t had the courage to tell her about his marriage. In November 1829, Susan married Jérôme Napoleon Bonaparte-Patterson. He had refused to wait for an arranged marriage to a European princess, instead opting for the $200,000 fortune that Susan brought to the marriage. In an attempt to match the railroad heiress’s dowry, the groom’s maternal grandfather, William Patterson — one of the wealthiest men in Maryland — gave the couple Montrose Mansion as a wedding gift.\n\nThis was not the only treason from her father. When he died, he divided his state between his children, except Betsy. He even gave instructions to publish a letter about Betsy and her insubordination in the newspaper. She tried to contest the will, but in the end she gave in. The only thing she got was the small properties where Betsy had been born.\n\nDuring this time Louis Napoleon of France restored the French Empire. Napoleon III (born Charles-Louis Napoléon Bonaparte; 20 April 1808 – 9 January 1873) was the Emperor of the French from 1852 to 1870 and, as Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, the President of France from 1848 to 1852. He was the only president of the French Second Republic and the founder of the Second French Empire.\n\nNapoleon III excluded Bo from the imperial line, and Bo and Betsy filed a lawsuit. In 1861, she filed an inheritance claim in the Tribunal of First Instance at Paris after her former husband, Prince Jérôme, died on June 24, 1860. On February 15, 1861, the Tribunal of the Seine ruled that “demands of Madame Elizabeth Patterson and her son, Jerome Bonaparte, are not admissible, and must be rejected.”\n\nBetsy also knew love as she fell in love with Prince Alexander Gorchakov. When she realised that his family wouldn’t accept her, she broke off the relationship because she wouldn’t become his mistress. Alexander Mikhailovich Gorchakov ( (15 July 1798 – 11 March 1883[1]) was a Russian diplomat and statesman from the Gorchakov princely family.\n\nThe end of the book shows us Bo and Betsy reconciling. Bo is lying in bed, dying of throat cancer.\n\nBetsy had two grandchildren: Jerome Jr and Charles.\n\nJerome Napoleon Bonaparte II (November 5, 1830 – September 3, 1893) was a French-American military officer who served in the United States Army and later in the French Army. He was the son of Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte and Susan May Williams.\n\nCharles Joseph Bonaparte (June 9, 1851 – June 28, 1921) was a French-American lawyer and political activist for progressive and liberal causes. Originally from Baltimore, Maryland, he served in the cabinet of the 26th U.S. President, Theodore Roosevelt."
