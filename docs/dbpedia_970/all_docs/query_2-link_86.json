        "text": "We highly recommend a visit to the Maison Bonaparte in Ajaccio, Corsica. It’s a must-see tourist attraction during your stay! Indeed, the town is deeply marked by its history with the emperor. Napoleon was born here on August 15, 1769, and lived here with his family.\n\nWhat’s more, the museum is beautiful. From a purely aesthetic point of view, you’ll succumb to the wealth of paintings, sculptures and decorative elements on display in the various rooms.\n\nYou’ll discover a side of Napoleon we didn’t know before, one that isn’t told in history textbooks!\n\nIn this article, you’ll find some useful tips to help you prepare for your visit to this house of unparalleled historical importance!\n\nWhy visit the Maison Bonaparte in Ajaccio?\n\nIs the Maison Bonaparte worth it? Our opinion:\n\nYes, we think this museum is worth a visit!\n\nHis visit gave us a better understanding of the history of Napoleon, France and Corsica. The house’s authentic architecture, furnishings and period objects took us back to the heart of the 18th century. We enjoyed imagining Napoleon Bonaparte’s childhood in the salons and corridors of this historic monument. Find out more here.\n\nWe enjoyed the exhibition, which traces Napoleon’s meteoric rise, from his military beginnings to his coronation as emperor. We were impressed by the wealth of exhibits and documents on display, giving us a better understanding of its major influence on France and Europe.\n\nIn fact, this museum features in our article on must-do activities in Ajaccio.\n\nWhy is this historic monument so famous?\n\nThe historic home of the Bonaparte family is famous for many reasons:\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte’s birthplace\n\nBorn on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio, Corsica, he is one of the most important figures in French history. He was Emperor of the French from 1804 to 1815, and left his mark on Europe.\n\nA witness to the history of the Bonaparte family\n\nThis family, originally from Corsica, played an important role in France and other European countries. The Maison Bonaparte is a witness to their daily lives in the 18th century.\n\nOne of Corsica’s most visited monuments\n\nThe house was converted into a national museum in 1967. The museum features Bonaparte family memorabilia, as well as period furniture, paintings and objets d’art.\n\nThe museum is located in a magnificent setting\n\nIn the historic center of Ajaccio, close to the sea. Ajaccio is a magnificent town with many tourist attractions to discover.\n\nOur favorite moments\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of our visit to the museum was the discovery of the dining room. The atmosphere of this play transported us into the daily life of the Bonaparte family. We enjoyed imagining the meals and lively conversations that once took place there.\n\nAnother highlight was the viewing of the book entitled “Voyage de Leurs Majestés Impériales”. It’s a travel diary from another time, in which stories mingle with lithographs. The scenes depicted allowed us to project ourselves back to the 19th century.\n\nHowever, what really amazed and fascinated us was the discovery of the Bonapartefamily tree, made from hair. This unique and surprising work of art left us speechless. In this creation, every branch of the tree and all its decorations are made from carefully gathered human hair.\n\nHistory in brief\n\nWe learned more about Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the most influential figures inEuropean history. Find out more here.\n\nHe was born on August 15, 1769 in Ajaccio, Corsica , to a family of Corsican nobility.\n\nHe received a military education, and his exceptional talents soon propelled him to the pinnacle of power.\n\nIn 1799, he overthrew the government and became France’s First Consul. He reorganized the country, introducing administrative and legal reforms.\n\nIn 1804, Napoleon became Emperor of France. He redrew the map of Europe and extended France’s influence across the continent.\n\nHowever, in 1814, following a series of setbacks, he was exiled to Elba and then to St. Helena, where he died in 1821.\n\nWe also learned more about the Maison Bonaparte, a witness to the family’s history.\n\nYou’ll discover that the history of this residence dates back to the end of the 15th century. Over the generations, the Bonaparte family settled here, enlarging and embellishing it.\n\nIn the 19th century, the property changed hands several times, finally coming into the hands of Napoleon III in 1852. It was finally transformed into a national museum in 1967.\n\nAccess: Maison Bonaparte, Ajaccio, Corsica\n\nWhere is the museum?\n\nRue Saint-Charles\n\nRight in downtown Ajaccio\n\nNear Place de Gaulle\n\nHow to get there?\n\nLocated in the pedestrian streets of downtown Ajaccio, you’ll need to walk to the museum entrance. The surrounding streets are narrow and cobbled. During busy periods, the lane quickly becomes congested and difficult to negotiate.\n\nMaison Bonaparte is a 6-minute walk from Port Tino Rossi, where you can catch the shuttle to Porticcio.\n\nBy bus: take lines 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 of the local bus network.\n\nTwo stops are possible on these lines:\n\n– Place De Gaulle – Piazza De Gaulle is a 6-minute walk away.\n\n– Cathedral, a 3-minute walk away.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nBy car: there are several parking lots in the vicinity of the museum.\n\nParking\n\nThe museum has no on-site parking.\n\nThe nearest parking lots are\n\nQ-Park Diamant parking lot, a 3-minute walk away (fee payable)\n\nChamber of Commerce parking lot, a 4-minute walk away (chargeable)\n\nUseful tips: duration, schedules, eating…\n\nBest time to visit\n\nTo avoid the summer crowds, it’s best to visit out of season. Otherwise, we advise you to come as soon as the museum opens, to avoid the queue that quickly forms in front of the entrance. It’s also a great way toescape the summer heat.\n\nLength of visit and main difficulties\n\nWe recommend you allow 1h30 to 2h for the visit to the Maison Bonaparte.\n\nIf you’re an avid reader, you’ll certainly need to allow 2 hours, as there are plenty of informative panels. If you’ve taken the audioguide, the visit is quicker, but you’ll still need to allow at least 1 hour.\n\nThe site has many staircases and the floor is somewhat raised, particularly in the cellar. Given the age of the building, the doors are sometimes a little narrow.\n\nPeople with reduced mobility do not have access to the entire museum.\n\nHowever, you can visit part of the second floor, the first floor and the temporary exhibition.\n\nAdvice on how to visit\n\nThe tour begins on the second floor, where paintings, sculptures and other works of art relating to Napoleon’s childhood and youth are on display. With the help of an audio guide, we retraced his youth and his last visit to Ajaccio in 1799.\n\nOn the second floor, the rooms are decorated according to the wishes of Letizia, his mother. Here you’ll see some of the finest furniture purchased in 1796. Madame Mère’s drawing room is particularly admirable. Following the direction of the tour, you’ll also pass through the study of Napoleon’s father, the birth room, the dining room, the gallery, etc. Several other rooms are dedicated to the Napoleonic legend, featuring historical objects such as paintings, books and sculptures.\n\nFinally, we ended our visit with a visit to the cellars, which contain a variety of agricultural artefacts linked to the Bonapartes’ past as landowners. Among other things, we discovered the reconstruction of an oil mill.\n\nThe garden can be visited at the beginning or end of your visit, as you wish.\n\nVisiting with children\n\nWe think the Maison Bonaparte is an interesting place for children to visit. In fact, it can be a fun, concrete introduction or echo to the concepts taught at school.\n\nA children’s audioguide is available in French and English to ensure a captivating visit for young visitors.\n\nIf you’re visiting the museum with your family, please note that strollers and metal-framed baby carriers are not allowed in the museum.\n\nSchedules and rates\n\nThe museum is open every day except Monday:\n\nOctober 1 to March 31: 10:30 am to 12:30 pm (last entry 12 pm) and 1:15 pm to 4:30 pm (last entry 4 pm),\n\nApril 1 to September 30: 10 am to 12:30 pm (last entry 12 pm) and 1:15 pm to 5:30 pm (last entry 5 pm).\n\nAs far as ticket prices are concerned, you have to count:\n\nFull price: €7,\n\nReduced rate: €5 (non-EU residents aged 18 to 25, members of large families on presentation of valid proof),\n\nFree admission for EU residents under 26.\n\nFind out more here.\n\nGuided tours\n\nGuided tours are organized by the Ajaccio Tourist Office.\n\nBefore discovering the Maison Bonaparte, the program includes a stroll through the town center. You’ll see the various points of interest in the historic district: the citadel ramparts, the colorful old streets and the cathedral. Allow around 1h45. Find out more here.\n\nAlternatively, an audioguide is included in the price of your ticket.\n\nCatering\n\nThe museum’s location in Ajaccio’s city center means you can take advantage of a wide choice of restaurants in the surrounding area.\n\nHere are a few restaurants we’ve really enjoyed:\n\nRestaurant Le Petit Restaurant\n\nOn the corner of a cobbled street in the old town, this address offers a cuisine that favors short circuits and highlights local producers. We were seduced by the chef’s fine, tasty dishes.\n\nRestaurant Marinette\n\nJust a few meters from Ajaccio’s Citadel, this establishment focuses on quality and fresh produce. The cuisine is refined and tasty. The quantities are just right and the cooking is light.\n\nRestaurant L’Écrin\n\nLocated close to Place d’Austerlitz, refinement is the watchword here. Fish, meat, vegetables and fruit are transformed into tasty dishes!\n\nFor more choice, see our article on the city’s best restaurants.\n\nStart of the tour: Corsica and Napoleon\n\nYou’ll discover that Napoleon is an important figure in Corsica. It is an essential symbol of the island’s identity. We learned more about his meteoric rise to power in France. And its central role in European history. His achievements have forged a special pride among the island’s inhabitants.\n\nBefore entering the house, we invite you to take a look at the façade. The 3-storey building is decorated with the Bonaparte coat of arms and bears a marble plaque commemorating the emperor’s birth.\n\nCorsica in the 18th century\n\nOur tour begins on the second floor. The exhibition presents elements that will give you a better understanding of the political and social context in which the Bonaparte family evolved.\n\nWe discover that the Genoese Republic ruled Corsica for almost 3 centuries. This led to periodic rebellions by the local population, which intensified from 1729 onwards. That same year, France supported the creation of a French party on the island, while encouraging aspirations for independence.\n\nThis part of the exhibition reveals portraits of important figures in Corsican history. For example, Pascal Paoli, nicknamed “General of the Corsicans”, was one of the campaigners for Corsican independence.\n\nThe Bonaparte family: the story of a rise\n\nDuring the rest of our visit, we learned that the Bonaparte family came from humble beginnings. During the Genoese period, they led a low-key existence as small landowners, generally trading wine and wheat with Genoa.\n\nWe meet Napoleon’s parents:\n\nCharles Bonaparte (1746-1785), lawyer and politician in Ajaccio. Although poor, he aspired to social distinction and mastered French, a rare asset at the time. He played an important role in the Corsican resistance against the French occupation.\n\nLetizia Ramolino (1750-1836) was the daughter of an Inspector General of Civil Engineering. Uneducated, she was nevertheless an intelligent, ambitious woman who instilled in her children a sense of duty and love of country.\n\nIn 1769, the family owned only the second floor of this house. We understand that despite their modest farm income, Charles has high social ambitions. As for Napoleon’s mother, she juggled a social life with raising their 8 children.\n\nYou’ll see that thanks to Napoleon’s exploits, which we’ll look at next, the Bonaparte family’srise to prominence was meteoric. In just a few years, an ordinary Corsican family has become one of the most powerful in Europe.\n\nNapoleon: training and early career\n\nWe were amazed to learn that Napoleon left Corsica in 1778 at just 9 years of age to begin his military studies on the mainland.\n\nYou’ll discover an illustration of the emperor’s childhood, helping us to better project his early years. “The snowball fight at Brienne”, the military school where he attended, is depicted in lithograph form.\n\nWe learned that at just 16, Napoleon was already a lieutenant! He learns the soldier’s trade and steadily rises in rank.\n\nIn the part of the exhibition dedicated to the young Bonaparte’s early career, you’ll find a wealth of objects and illustrations. In particular, one of his first swords.\n\nGradually, he turned away from the Corsican independentists and adopted the republican ideas of the Revolution.\n\nContinuation of the tour: decor and furniture of the First Empire\n\nIn 1796, Napoleon’s mother undertook a complete refurnishing of the house. The furniture, fabrics, decorations and wallpapers you can see in the museum date from this period. We’ve learned that Letizia ordered them in Italy and Marseille, with financial help from her children. The house became one of the most beautiful in Ajaccio! What do you think?\n\nDuring your visit, you’ll pass through many rooms filled with beautiful period furniture and objects. We’ve chosen to tell you about just 2 pieces, the ones that made the biggest impression on us.\n\nNapoleon’s birthplace\n\nVisit Napoleon’s birthplace! It is said that he was born in this room on August 15, 1769.\n\nYou’ll be able to admire some very fine period furniture. We loved the late 18th-century chest of drawers, adorned with stone and marble.\n\nDuring our stay in Ajaccio, we heard a story about this room. She recounts how, in the early 19th century, the nursery was one of the strongest places of memory in Europe. So much so that the soldiers of the great army would come and kiss the floor of this room, transformed into a veritable shrine to the Napoleonic cult.\n\nThe dining room\n\nWe really enjoyed discovering the dining room. This historic room has retained its original layout.\n\nThis authenticity allowed us to imagine the time when the Bonaparte family gathered around this table. A glimpse of the lively conversations that may have taken place there.\n\nThe wall decor and green fabric were redone identically:\n\nthe faux white marble wallpaper matches an original sample found in 1957 when some old mirrors were removed.\n\nthe green velvet decorated with pansies that covers the chairs and table was also reconstructed from old fragments found in the house.\n\nDiscovering the evolution of the Bonaparte family\n\nAfter the heyday of Napoleon’s reign, the Bonaparte family faced challenges and setbacks. Its members have been exiled, prosecuted or distanced from politics. However, you’ll see that the house has remained a tangible witness to their heritage, triumphs and trials.\n\nA few years after Napoleon’s death, in 1852, Napoleon III, son of Louis Bonaparte (Napoleon’s younger brother), acquired the house. At that time, the house was empty. However, we learned that he was determined to bring the birthplace of his ancestors back to life. You can admire the beautification work he has carried out. In particular, the ceiling decorations were refurbished by Corsican artist Jérôme Maglioli. Find out more here.\n\nToday, the Maison Bonaparte in Ajaccio remains an important historical site, having offered us a fascinating insight into the evolution and legacy of this family. It’s also a poignant testimony to his lasting influence on the course of history.\n\nThis part of the tour is dedicated to the Napoleonic legend. Here you’ll discover historic objects such as paintings, books and sculptures. Among them, 2 stood out for us.\n\nThe “Voyage of Their Imperial Majesties” book\n\nWe loved looking at the book “Voyage de Leurs Majestés Impériales dans le sud-est de la France en Corse et en Algérie”.\n\nIt’s a tourist reportage in images in the France and Algeria of the Second Empire. It retraces the journey of Napoleon III and Empress Eugénie.\n\nThe cartoonists followed them around like news reporters reporting the highlights of the leaders’ travels. They then recounted the receptions, visits, landscapes and crowds encountered at each stage.\n\nLooking through the book, you’ll discover cities, decorated cathedrals, town hall receptions, wild excursions and more. All depicted in lithographs.\n\nThis album takes us on a journey through a cheerful France, decked out to welcome its sovereigns.\n\nThe hair family tree\n\nWe were amazed when we discovered the Bonaparte family tree, made from hair. It’s a unique and fascinating work of art created by Dr. Polazzi’s daughter Élise in 1979.\n\nHere you’ll discover the Bonaparte lineage spanning several generations. This work was created using only human hair and cut and painted paper.\n\nThis type of meticulous work was very fashionable from the reign of Louis-Philippe onwards. They were made by amateurs or specialized craftsmen.\n\nWe really enjoyed this singular, delicate work. Flowery details, butterflies and birds are well represented. The finesse and precision of Elise’s work are admirable. In fact, it’s one of the museum’s most popular pieces.\n\nEnd of visit: heritage of a modest past and garden\n\nThe tour comes to an end. We discovered a side of Napoleon that we didn’t know, the one that isn’t told in books! We didn’t know, for example, that he came from modest parents. They lived on low incomes, derived in part from working the land.\n\nAgricultural objects\n\nWe ended our visit with a tour of the cellars, which contain farming implements linked to the Bonapartes’ past as landowners. Among the objects we discovered were millstones and jars. You’ll also see a reconstructed oil mill.\n\nAs well as evoking the agricultural past of the Bonaparte family, these tools will help you project yourself into the rural Corsica of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nWe also saw a model of the house in which the emperor lived on the island of St. Helena, from 1815 until his death in 1821.\n\nThe garden, L’Aiglon’s haven of peace\n\nWe end our visit to this place steeped in history with the garden. Nestled in the heart of the old town, you’ll discover this oasis of tranquility amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. Adorned with fruit trees and Mediterranean plants, it’s an invitation to stroll and contemplate.\n\nIt was created following a deed of 1805 which stipulated that the Ajaccio mansion was ceded to Letizia’s cousin, André Ramolino. Within 2 years, he was obliged to create, at his own expense, a square in front of the house. This is the origin of the garden."
