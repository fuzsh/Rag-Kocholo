Maria Letizia Ramolino Bonaparte (1750-1836): The Mother of Napoleon I and His Royal Family This evocative portrait captures Maria Letizia Ramolino Bonaparte, the mother of Napoleon I and several of his siblings, in the twilight of her life. Born in Corsica in 1750, Letizia was the daughter of a minor Italian nobleman and a Corsican woman. In 1764, she married Charles Bonaparte, a Corsican officer, and together they had 13 children. Among them were Napoleon Bonaparte, who would go on to become the Emperor of the French, and Lucien, Jérôme, Elisa, and Pauline, who also held positions of power and influence in Europe. Letizia's influence on her children was profound. She instilled in them a strong sense of ambition, determination, and a deep love for their native Corsica. Despite her humble origins, Letizia was a woman of great intelligence and charm, and she played a crucial role in shaping the destinies of her famous offspring. This portrait, taken in the late 1820s or early 1830s, shows a mature Letizia with a regal bearing and an air of quiet dignity. Her dark eyes, set deep in her face, seem to hold a world of wisdom and experience. The intricate lace collar and elaborate hairstyle are typical of the fashion of the time, but it is Letizia's strong and commanding presence that truly sets her apart. Letizia's life was marked by tragedy as well as triumph. She outlived many of her children, and was widowed twice. But she remained a constant source of support and inspiration to Napoleon, who never forgot the lessons she had taught him as a child. This portrait serves as a poignant reminder of the indelible impact that a mother's love can have on history.
