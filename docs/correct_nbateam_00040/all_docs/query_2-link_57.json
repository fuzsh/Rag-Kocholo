Saw him play on a game to game basis during his run with Lakers and he’s a solid athlete with a great body with great mobility but not a tremendous physical specimen so I was still confused on what scouts saw in this guy. Can some older users help me out\n\nI think the fact that he was so Mich bigger and athletic than everyone he played against in high school is made him so desireable to scouts. Also he came straight out of high school in an era where highly ranked recruits who came out of high school were were at that age that nba franchises love them at, fresh out of the 12th grade if a player chose that route. This era before one and done was great for guys like kwame and others who might have been even worse as they could capitalize on their high school dominance right away without having their defiencicies shown up in college against players just at fast, strong and athletic.\n\nRemember samardo Samuels? He was ranked the number 1 or 2 guy in his class coming out of high school, & after 2 decent not great years at Louisville he got drafted in the 2nd round and fizzled out of the nba for in I forget, it was a year or 2. Had the one & done rule not been implemented I think he would have been drafted in the 1st round.\n\nI think the fact that he was so Mich bigger and athletic than everyone he played against in high school is made him so desireable to scouts.

Had the one & done rule not been implemented I think he would have been drafted in the 1st round.\n\nThat was an era when the scouting wasn’t as advanced. I remember hearing all types of crazy comparisons thrown around, saying kwame brown was the next Garnett, that he had guard skills and 3 point range and all types of stuff. I had never actually seen him play prior to the draft. When I did I automatically realized he was way overhyped and a major project.\n\nThose early 2000s drafts that were filled with high school players and European players were kind of a crapshoot and players often got drafted more on hype than anything in a lot of cases. After the success of guys like Garnett, webber, etc gms were looking for the next big thing. Brown was someone who fit the physical dimensions and could be sold as the next big thing, but lacked the work ethic and skills. Same thing could be said for someone like darko, in comparison to nowitski or gasol. It only took a few games of watching him play to realize he wouldn’t be that type of player.\n\nThat was an era when the scouting wasn’t as advanced.

It only took a few games of watching him play to realize he wouldn’t be that type of player.\n\nOutside of his small hands he pretty much had the prototype body and athleticism for an NBA big. Quick feet, agile, ran the floor well, quick leaper, good explosion off of face ups, had a naturally strong build with good balance. Off the court he was supposedly a good kid with a good family. Appeared smart, well spoken.\n\nSkill-wise he was raw, he could face up and blow by and he actually had a pretty decent looking stroke, but the comparisons to guys like KG were unfounded. KG was supremely skilled compared to Kwame at the same stage, but KG coming out of prep school was just skin and bones. Kwame had the body to compete right away, at least physically. He just turned out to be a mentally fragile nervous ninny. His stroke not translating into anything hurt his face up potential. That was supposed to be a given in time bc he had a solid stroke, but that never came to be. He also never had a great feel for the post because he rushed his moves and got flustered by defensive pressure. That word \"flustered\" pretty much describes Kwame’s offensive game in a nutshell. He got nervous and because he was nervous he didn’t have the patience to read his defender or the team defense. It’s kinda like watching Andre Drummond now when he’s put in a position to make a scoring move as opposed to just finishing. What Drummond has that Kwame didn’t was big soft mitts. Kwame had relatively small hands and struggled with catching balls early (again, nervous and rushing his moves, moving before he caught the ball, etc) so that limited his offensive game even more as a roller and straight up finisher. Defensively he was solid, even plus later in his career, but the guy had zero confidence in his offensive game.\n\nOutside of his small hands he pretty much had the prototype body and athleticism for an NBA big.

He was scared to make mistakes and played stiff and without flow. He probably looked good in practice and against Tyson Chandler in workouts.\n\nMichael Olowokandi/Dangelo Russell are bigger busts in my opinion.\n\nI think Kwame browns biggest issue was confidence and basketball IQ.\n\nTheyre both pretty hard things to scout for, especially in that era.\n\nIf a guy has major confidence issues, they wont surface until playing against superior players…even at NCAA levels.\n\nHe could have been a 14/8 guy in my opinion.\n\nPeople hype up how he cant catch or shoot free throws etc.\n\nTruth is, he just didnt want the ball.

Nit just cause im a Duke fan but this kid faced double teams every play this year Towns was one on one allbyear cause of his stacked teams and with size and help even on the offensive glass he had an advantage along with the otgers, okafor is a solidified passer, strong in the double team great post moves will be more one on one in the league and i think he dominates, which is what the Lakers needed, first we pass up on hiring phil with dantoni which fucked us for years to come, then we give my all time favorite player a ridiculous contract which fucked us, then we draft russell over the most dominating big in basketvall cause of defensive scares, WTF the front office in LA has got to go. #firekutpchak and kwabe brown was good but had small hands very tiny hands and uts affected him tremedously in the league with fast handed gaurds and needing to control the ball with contact in the post.\n\nDAngelo Russell I think will be a bust based on where he was drafted, ithink he is a better passing JR Smith, hes got un hus gead he us replacing Kobe meabing he is shooting alot thats not his jon he needs to make plays, Okafor is whi we shoupdve taken.

Kinda like jermaine oneal in highschool. However once he got to the league he put on a lot of muscle and they wanted him to play on the block which wasnt his natural position and he wasnt comfortable with. His confidence went to crap, he had small hands began dropping all the passes, coudlnt handle the pressure on the lakers and sadly people argue he is one of the biggest busts. This is my opinion of his career.\n\nHis biggest hype was that he was a mobile 6’11 big man and could move well in transition. Kinda like jermaine oneal in highschool.

This is my opinion of his career.\n\nI actually saw Kwame at a bar in St. Simons Island a couple of years back when I lived there, which is were he is from. And although he wasn’t the best basketball player, he and his posse were beasts at drinking Hennesy lol. Very big guy from what I could see and definitely was a raw specimen the during his entire stint in the NBA, but obviously he never gave the dedication to the game to live up to his once hype of being the #1 pick.\n\nI actually saw Kwame at a bar in St. Simons Island a couple of years back when I lived there, which is were he is from.

He was Michael Jordan’s first draft pick I think, and Michael Jordan has demonstrated over and over that he was a better player, and owner than he was a scout/operations guy.\n\nBut Kwame just never developed any sort of game in spite of his physical tools. His hand size gets mentioned a lot but I don’t think that factored in much. The main problem was that he just never worked on his game. The fact that he hung around in the league and got paid for as long as he did is a testament to the belief of GMs that size matters.\n\nThough I think he was a colossal bust, I think his main problem was not developing, and not handling the pressure of a hypercritical media well (Stephen A Smith’s \"KWAH-MAY BROWN\" antics for example).\n\nKwame Brown was overhyped, but looking back I think that his biggest problem was a lack of maturity.
