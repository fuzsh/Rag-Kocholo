        "text": "Kwame Brown is demanding his baby mama be shut down in their custody battle and is accusing her of taking the money he put in the bank for their kids.\n\nThe former NBA star is responding to his baby mama Jocelyn Vaughn’s motion seeking for her legal bills to be paid by him. Vaughn argued he is a former basketball player with several businesses and investment properties and could afford to pay her lawyers.\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by The Blast, Brown says that is not the case and claims to be living off his savings at the moment. He claims to be trying to get businesses off the ground but is not making money from them.\n\nHe claims to have paid his ex over $52,000 in support and claims that “evidence will further show that Petitioner has withdrawn at least $22,000 for her own personal use in the past year from the minor children’s” bank accounts that he funded.\n\nBrown points out his ex is a licensed nurse and employed full time making $60,000 a year, saying she can pay her own legal bills.\n\nThe judge has yet to rule.\n\nAs The Blast first reported, Vaughn sued Kwame Brown in September to establish paternity and seeking child support for their daughters. She claimed he was not supporting them financially.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Vaughn claimed the former NBA star has admitted being the biological father and even signed their children’s birth certificates. But she alleged that he has not assisted her financially for the costs of raising the kids.\n\nShe argued that Brown has enough money to pay monthly child support — despite never living up to the hype, Brown did earn over $60 million in his career — and wants the court to determine the amount. Vaughn also wants him to pay her legal bills in the case.\n\nVaughn and Brown have not spoken much publicly about their long-term relationship but in 2002, articles reference him having recently moved his hometown girlfriend (aka Vaughn) into his house and talked about her providing him stability.\n\nBrown then sued Vaughn in a separate suit seeking joint custody of their three daughters. He said he has provided “literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in support” to his ex over the years to support their kids and claims they even “lived together over the course of many years.”\n\nBrown calls the allegations of not supporting his daughters “patently false.”\n\nThe case is ongoing."
