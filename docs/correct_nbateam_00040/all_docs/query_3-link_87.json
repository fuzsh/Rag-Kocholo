        "text": "After the new scandal caused by the new video where he appears with a gun, Ja Morant no longer counts his detractors. While he now seems to be the laughing stock of the entire NBA community, he recently saw a former player attack him head on...\n\nOnce again, Morant has disappointed. After the slip that had already removed him from the NBA courts a few weeks ago, the Grizzlies point guard has done it again. Without much surprise, he was quickly suspended by his franchise, and could see his career take a darker turn. In parallel, this new controversy has obviously made many followers react.\n\nKwame Brown's scathing exit on Ja Morant\n\nWhen a star goes off the rails, the backlash is even more violent than for an ordinary player. So Ja saw social media go wild, but not only that. Some of his counterparts also spoke out, like D'Angelo Russell and his categorical advice, or Kwame Brown. The latter did not go easy, and poured his heart out on this matter in a viral tirade:\n\n\"So, Ja Morant, you like playing with guns, huh? Instead of being at home buying all the guns you want, playing with all the guns you want off camera, you'd rather get in trouble, apologize, then show a gun on Instagram again. I've heard of NBA Youngboy, but you're NBA DumbBoy. You're the dumbest asshole in the league.\n\nYou got 231 million dollars coming to you and you want to be a f*cking thug? You have the right to own a gun. You have a 2nd amendment right, but why do you keep pulling it out wanting to be threatening? Is it because of all that music you listen to? Does that music put you in a trance, you fat fuck? Because this music could cost you your fucking career.\n\nThe only thing you do is look stupid. You lower yourself to the level of your fucking friends and by the way, they are not your friends. Real friends would have looked at you and taken that damn gun out of your hand, and you know why? At least the guys who pay you would have thought you had good company. Your f*cking buddy would have had to slap you with that gun so they couldn't take away your contract\".\n\nAs a reminder, Kwame Brown is considered a real bust for his failed NBA stint, and is used to scathing media outlets. While many observers seem to share his thoughts, being so virulent probably won't help the debate. The truth is, no one really knows how to make Ja Morant realize the magnitude of his actions, and that is bound to be a problem."
