        "text": "In the summer of 2008, I was asked to fill in for Krista Jahnke.\n\nAt the time, I was a general assignment reporter, mostly covering high schools and small colleges.\n\nJahnke, who took a temporary absence to have a child, covered the Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe team was easy to babysit. The Pistons were coming off six straight appearances in the Eastern Conference finals with the core of Chauncey Billups, Rasheed Wallace, Rip Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince and Antonio McDyess still firmly in place.\n\nThe only signings that summer?\n\nThe Pistons acquired free agents Will Bynum, Kwame Brown and Walter Hermann, which was light work for me while performing other responsibilities at the Free Press.\n\nJahnke returned, but decided to relinquish Pistons duties.\n\nWithout an interview, former sports editor Gene Myers decided I would cover the Pistons in late September.\n\nThe next day, a bus carrying first-year coach Michael Curry, promising guard Rodney Stuckey and media members left for a two-day trip to Michigan’s west side, an annual effort from the franchise to create interest around the state.\n\nI never aspired to cover the Pistons; it just happened.\n\nAnd after 11½ seasons as a fill-in, it’s time for the Free Press to find a permanent replacement.\n\nI can guess the immediate thoughts of those reading this:\n\n“You are the problem!”\n\nYeah, it has been a time of losing.\n\nI only covered three playoff appearances and never covered a playoff victory.\n\nThe franchise has an ongoing 14-game postseason losing streak (I covered the last 13 losses since I was there for the Game 6 loss to the Boston Celtics in the 2008 Eastern Conference finals).\n\nChange has been constant.\n\nAfter nearly 30 years in northern Oakland County, the Pistons moved from the Palace to newly built Little Caesars Arena in downtown Detroit in 2017.\n\nA state-of-the-art franchise headquarters, located a short distance away in the New Center area, quickly followed.\n\nThere were two ownership changes.\n\nI covered three front office leaders.\n\nSeven coaches ran the Pistons under my watch.\n\nYeah, it hasn’t been pretty.\n\nBut despite the losing, it has been a compelling period to chronicle.\n\nNo. 1 change\n\nOne of the most memorable days occurred early in my tenure.\n\nThe Pistons were 2-0 and were in Charlotte for the third game of the season in early November 2008.\n\nIn those days, media members arrived at arenas before the team, and I remember standing there with former MLive.com reporter A. Sherrod Blakely and Detroit News reporter Chris McCosky.\n\nAs the players walked by, my colleagues both realized something was amiss.\n\nBillups and McDyess were missing.\n\nWithin minutes, the word was out: The Pistons were trading Billups, McDyess and Cheikh Samb (remember him?) to the Denver Nuggets for superstar Allen Iverson.\n\nWhile McCosky and Blakely mobilized to report on the blockbuster, I was completely blind.\n\nNo sources to speak with; no bars inside Time Warner Cable Arena to call a source even if I had sources.\n\nLuckily, by the time I arrived back to my hotel room, the Free Press had ignored my worthless presence and had a story on our website courtesy of columnists Michael Rosenberg, who now writes for Sports Illustrated, and Drew Sharp, who died in 2016.\n\nI recall the moment for several reasons: The Iverson acquisition serves as the tipping point to usher in the current era of losing fortunes.\n\nIt was also one of the last stories that I didn’t hear first from Twitter.\n\nThe idea that a reporter would break news on a social media platform – and not on his/her publication website – was still in its infancy.\n\nBut obviously social media has become more than a news vehicle. It has become a way for fans to interact with media members and hold us accountable if we get something wrong.\n\nIt may come as a surprise to some who follow me on Twitter, but I enjoy the back and forth – as long as a follower isn’t insulting.\n\nFeel free to continue hitting me up on Twitter. I'll be around.\n\nWhat I will miss\n\nTraveling to 27 markets around the country is nice, but that cuts both ways. For every trip to Miami, there were trips into potential blizzard-like conditions in Milwaukee or Minneapolis.\n\nThe seasons are long, and the games tend to run together, which isn’t surprising since I’m a casual NBA fan.\n\nBut I will miss the relationships.\n\nReporters spend a lot of time waiting for players and coaches, and that leads to many jokes and fun times over the years with folks you see more often than family members.\n\nFirst it was Blakely and McCosky.\n\nFormer Detroit News reporter Vincent Goodwill, who now works for Yahoo! Sports, is still a good friend.\n\nAnd I will miss seeing The Athletic’s James Edwards, The Detroit News’ Rod Beard and Pistons.com’s Keith Langlois in the media room at the Pistons Performance Center.\n\nBut all things end.\n\nI plan to hang around Detroit. If you see me out, please say hello.\n\nTake care."
