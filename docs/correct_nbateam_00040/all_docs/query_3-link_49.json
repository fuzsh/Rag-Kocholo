        "text": "During his brief time with the Washington Wizards, former NBA big man Kwame Brown may not have had the best relationship with His Airness, Michael Jordan. However, he got to be with the former Chicago Bulls great enough to see a glimpse of the person that Jordan is—a side that most people rarely experience.\n\nNot what everybody thinks\n\nJordan is a larger-than-life figure that was and still is revered by people all over the world. His talent and determination to be the best basketball player that ever lived is inspirational, but Brown believes there’s much more to Jordan than meets the eye. Speaking on the Kwame Brown Bust Life, the South Carolina native said Jordan can be like any other man under the right circumstances.\n\n“Michael Jordan is not what everybody thinks. Michael Jordan only go to certain places, and if you approach him at certain places you’ll get a regular man answer,” said the former top overall pick.\n\nBrown went on to detail that Jordan was unlike other celebrities who had a huge entourage tagging along wherever they went. As a matter of fact, Brown shared that most times, His Airness only had his best friend, Charles Oakley, and his personal assistant, George Koehler, with him.\n\n“Michael is not gonna play with you. He didn’t act like a celebrity, he might not say he is not a celebrity, but in real life, he don’t act like a celebrity. He might be with Charles Oakley and this small little white guy named Georgie [George Koehler], and that’s it. He don’t have no armed bodyguards, no security, none of that,” Brown said.\n\nDidn’t live up to expectations\n\nDuring their time with the Wizards from 2001 to 2003, Brown and Jordan never had the best of relationships. Whether it was the age gap, the difference in approach, or just the pressure that Jordan heaped on Brown for being the first overall pick in 2001, it was something that would never really be resolved."
