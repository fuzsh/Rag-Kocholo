        "text": "TMZSports.com\n\nThe NBA's gonna have a real problem on its hands when LeBron James retires ... so says Kwame Brown, who tells TMZ Sports the league isn't putting enough focus on the next generation of athletes -- like that one guy on the OKC Thunder.\n\nWe spoke with the former 2001 No. 1 overall pick at LAX this week about the current state of the Association ... and he pointed out the top teams in the Western Conference aren't getting nearly as much coverage as the Lakers due to the LeBron effect.\n\n\"You got this young talent,\" Brown said. \"The only thing I see what's wrong with the NBA is that they hold on to the 'superstar' thing too long. We got OKC ... before, I didn't even know their starting 5. You don't even know their coach.\"\n\n\"You gotta start promoting this young talent that you have. Otherwise, they're going to be scrambling when LeBron's gone.\"\n\nOur camera guy pretty much proved Brown's point ... 'cause when he brought up MVP candidate Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, he asked how his name's pronounced -- and both dudes were stumped.\n\n\"I don't know either,\" Brown admitted. \"He's not on ESPN every day.\"\n\nFYI -- it's \"Shay.\"\n\nAs for SGA's season, the 25-year-old Canadian is averaging 31.1 points, 5.6 rebounds, 6.4 assists and 2.1 steals a game ... leading the Thunder to a 46-20 record, tied for the best in the Western Conference.\n\nHe's one of the most exciting players on the court today ... and it's safe to say Brown wants the league to treat him like it."
