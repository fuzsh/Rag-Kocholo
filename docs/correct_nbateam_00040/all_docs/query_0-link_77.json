        "text": "The NBA free agency frenzy has died down and with the summer league complete, and the league has reached a quiet point. However, there are a few trade rumblings and free agents available that are still creating buzz. Here are the latest NBA rumors you need to know:\n\nKwame Brown eyeing NBA comeback\n\nFormer No. 1 overall pick Kwame Brown hasn't played in the NBA since he was with the Philadelphia 76ers for the 2012-13 season, but he is now trying to make a comeback, according to Interperformances:\n\nInterperformances is proud to announce that the NBA star Kwame Brown decided to sign with our agency. The #1 overall pick of the 2001 draft is ready for a new life. His comeback can be the road to glory for a team that believes in him. Kwame is back, physically healthy and ready to be the outstanding player he was on several NBA teams.\n\nA great intimidator that can block shots, rebound consistently and explode in devastating dunks. No longer the young man that entered the NBA, Kwame is now an experienced and mature player and man. And he’s back, for the love of the game.\n\nBrown is just the latest former NBA player to attempt a comeback, joining Ray Allen, Derek Fisher and Baron Davis. He averaged 1.9 points and 3.4 rebounds in 22 games with the Sixers, including 11 starts.\n\nNets to acquire Gay?\n\nRudy Gay has let the Sacramento Kings now that he would like to be traded, and while he has been linked to the Rockets and to the Timberwolves, the Brooklyn Nets have emerged as a possible destination, according to Fansided's Tyler Dencker\n\nWhile age is concern with Rudy Gay, as he is approaching the age of 30, he’s still playing solid basketball. He averaged 17 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season, all while shooting 46.3% from the field. The year before, he averaged a career best 21.1 points per game. While he may be approaching the back nine of his career, he could definitely have a positive impact on the Nets. Last season, Brooklyn was 23rd in the league in scoring and efficiency from the small-forward position, according to hoopsstats.com. Gay would provide immediate help.\n\nAgain, the most important thing is that Rudy Gay would certainly provide the talent that the Nets are lacking.\n\nPlus, the Nets could use a guy to take some pressure off of Lopez. Although Lopez has been pretty consistent for the Nets over the course of his career despite the change in surrounding players, the Nets have statistically had success when they had other stars surrounding him.\n\nOf course though, to acquire Gay, the Nets need to give something up in return. It would make the most sense for the Nets to only offer Bojan Bogdanović and a second-round pick. The salary cap will continue to rise, and Gay has a player option for $14.2 million in 2017-18. If the deal doesn’t work out, the Nets will still have salary cap flexibility in free agency. If they deal does turn out well for Brooklyn, then Gay could re-sign with the team and they would still have cap space.\n\nIf the Nets were to trade Bogdanović and a second-round pick for Gay, it would give the Kings a young small-forward to potentially replace Gay’s position in the long run. Bogdanovic was selected 31st overall in the 2011 draft and has potential, which would intrigue the Kings. In the meantime, though, the Kings could have veterans Omri Casspi and Matt Barnes (the team’s two remaining small-forwards). Sacramento added the veteran Barnes this offseason, which could be a sign the team has prepared to get rid of Rudy Gay.\n\nGay averaged 17.2 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season.\n\nPistons to let Baynes walk in free agency?\n\nThe Detroit Pistons are expected to sign guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope to a contract extension this year, the cost of which is expected to put them over the salary cap. That means they likely won't be able to keep backup big man Aron Baynes after this season, reports Perry A. Ferrell of the Detroit Free Press.\n\nBaynes will go back to his normal position in the post when he comes to training camp this month. It could be his last season with the Pistons. He’s under contract to make $6.5 million this year and has an early termination option on his contract for 2017-18.\n\nBecause the Pistons might not have enough money to keep the veteran center if he were to exercise his option and become a free agent, the team went out and signed 7-foot-3 Boban Marjanovic as insurance.\n\nBaynes averaged 6.3 points and 4.7 rebounds per game last season.\n\nBack to the NBA Newsfeed"
