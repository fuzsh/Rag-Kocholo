        "text": "Free agent Kwame Brown worked out for the Charlotte Bobcats, and one can only hope that Michael Jordan was in the gym fighting hard to bite his tongue. From the Observer: “Brown, an unrestricted free agent, finished last season as the Bobcats’ starting center. As of now, Gana Diop, coming off a ruptured Achilles tendon, is the only true center under contract to the Bobcats. Brown expressed gratitude at the end of last season to Bobcats owner Michael Jordan, player-personnel chief Rod Higgins and coach Paul Silas for re-igniting his career. Bartelstein said it’s still uncertain where Brown will sign, but acknowledged what a good experience Brown in Charlotte. ‘No question he is tremendously appreciative of the opportunity Michael and Rod gave him,’ said Bartelstein. ‘And also the opportunity Paul gave him’ when Silas took over as coach in December. ‘All those things, that’s not lip-service. But by the same token, it’s a business.'”"
