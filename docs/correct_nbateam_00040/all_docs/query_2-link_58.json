        "text": "Former No. 1 draft pick Kwame Brown has been waived by the Philadelphia 76ers, league sources told Yahoo Sports.\n\nA 6-foot-11 center, Brown had been taken first overall in the 2001 NBA draft by then-Washington Wizards president Michael Jordan, ahead of players like Tyson Chandler, Pau Gasol, Joe Johnson, Zach Randolph and Tony Parker. Brown was in a two-year, $6 million contract with the Sixers and has made approximately $64 million in his 13 NBA seasons, despite career averages of 6.6 points and 5.5 rebounds.\n\nBrown, 31, had been sidelined by a right hamstring injury and has yet to play this season.\n\nThe Sixers also released guard Darius Morris."
