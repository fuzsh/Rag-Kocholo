        "text": "[jwplayer M3ktKhl2-z6KDnl0B]\n\nOn this day in 2001, Kwame Brown, of Glynn Academy in Brunswick, Georgia, was selected by Washington Wizards with the No. 1 overall pick in the NBA Draft.\n\nWith the selection, Brown became the first high school player chosen No. 1 overall in the NBA Draft. Since Brown, there were only two other players selected with the top pick straight out of high school prior to the rule change: LeBron James (2003) and Dwight Howard (2004).\n\nBrown entered the NBA with astronomical expectations as the top pick of team president Michael Jordan and eventually never lived up to the hype. He averaged just 4.5 points and 3.5 rebounds as a rookie and only lasted with the Wizards for four seasons.\n\nAfter leaving the Wizards in 2005, Brown bounced around the NBA, splitting time with six other teams. He ultimately retired from the NBA in 2013 after a one-year stint with the Philadelphia 76ers. Unfortunately, Brown is regarded as one of the biggest busts in NBA history."
