        "text": "Kwame Brown hasn’t been seen on the NBA hardwood since early 2013, but the first overall pick in the 2001 draft has resurfaced in recent days, responding to criticism from podcasters, media members, and ex-teammates.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of who — and why — the NBA flameout is feuding with.\n\nWho is Kwame Brown?\n\nBrown, who’s kept a low profile since retiring from the NBA, is widely remembered by analysts and fans as one of the league’s biggest busts. When he was drafted with the No. 1-overall pick by Michael Jordan’s Wizards in 2001, Brown struggled to live up to the hype around his potential. The same outcome occurred when the Lakers took a chance on him in 2005, hoping he’d shine alongside Kobe Bryant in a post-Shaquille O’Neal era.\n\nFans may recall Stephen A. Smith’s famous rant about Brown, after the Lakers traded Brown to Memphis for Pau Gasol during the 2007-08 season. Smith called Brown a scrub” with “small hands” who “can’t play basketball.” The ESPN “First Take” host would continue to be a presence in Brown’s latest round of social media rants.\n\nBrown spent 12 years in the NBA, where he bounced around teams including the Pistons, Charlotte Bobcats, Warriors and Sixers. He was waived by Philadelphia before he could appear in a game in the 2013–14 season. His last appearance in the NBA came on Feb. 20, 2013, playing 6:23 in a loss to Minnesota.\n\nWhat set Brown off?\n\nBrown’s social media resurgence was sparked by recent episodes of the “All the Smoke” podcast, hosted by retired NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson. Jackson and Brown were teammates on the Bobcats’ 2010-11 roster.\n\nIn a recent episode with Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, Jackson made a comment shading Brown’s “basketball skills” while discussing the Gasol trade. A few weeks later, former NBA star Gilbert Arenas appeared on the podcast and called Brown a “show pony” whose confidence was crushed by Michael Jordan’s tough treatment while he played for the Wizards from 2001-05.\n\nArenas also noted that when he got to the Wizards in 2003, he didn’t have time to “f–k with” Brown, because he was making more money than Brown and the Wizards were “technically my team” at the time.\n\nBrown fires back\n\nTwo days after the Arenas episode aired, Brown took to social media to “set the record straight” about his career and Arenas’ comments.\n\nHe first shared a number of Instagram videos warning his followers that he was crafting a response to Barnes and Jackson. Brown followed up with an hour-long YouTube video, in which he addressed Barnes, Jackson, Smith, and more critics who’ve spoken negatively about him through the years.\n\nBrown went on to slam Barnes and Jackson in various social media posts — repeatedly calling Barnes “Becky with the good hair” and Jackson a “fake Black Lives Matter activist,” among other things.\n\nMost of Brown’s responses were filled with cusses, insults and an accusation that Arenas took “millions” from him, via their contracts, while they played together in Washington.\n\n“Stephen A. you bald forehead,” Brown said at one point, addressing the longtime sports commentator’s past comments about his NBA career. “Thinking you tough talking about ‘Oh, they can come see me.’ … Well meet me in Seattle where you can have mutual combat. … It’ll look like you had a toupee on the front of your head.”\n\nIn additional videos, Brown also addressed criticism from “Undisputed” co-host Skip Bayless. Brown’s most recent target in his war of words with critics includes journalist Jemele Hill.\n\n“And Skip Bayless, thanks for the pass I guess,” Brown said in a separate Instagram Live video. “I ain’t get no pass from your co-host when you was letting this punk motherf–ker talk about a teenager. … I had to endure you talking about my momma’s son like that, b–ch.”\n\nBarnes and Jackson’s respond:\n\nJackson was first to respond and took a lighter approach to the situation, explaining that Brown is simply looking for attention after years of ridicule about his NBA career.\n\n“Everybody in the world has joked on your basketball skills bro… so be mad at yourself… don’t make it personal,” Jackson said, later adding, “But, we not gon’ put you on. You had your opportunity when you was the No. 1 draft pick and laid an egg.”\n\nJackson, in part, added, “When I see you, I don’t got no hard feelings, I don’t got no problem with you… let’s just keep the respect there as men…”\n\nBarnes took to Instagram to address Brown in a since-deleted video.\n\n“Bro, you’ve been getting made fun of since you got in the league for not living up to expectations,” Barnes said, calling Brown’s social media actions a “cry for help” and attention.\n\n“I tapped Jack’s knee when something was said. So, if that’s what got you mad — me tapping somebody’s knee — you need a hug, bro. … If you want to be mad at anyone be mad at MJ for believing you and picking you No. 1.”\n\nBarnes later invited Brown to come on the “All the Smoke” podcast to “talk your sh-t face-to-face” and even offered to travel to Atlanta to accommodate Brown.\n\nBrown responded to Barnes in a video turning down his podcast invitation. Though, he proposed stepping into the ring with Barnes.\n\n“I’ma let your show fizzle out, because I’m not gon’ help you get no rating,” Brown said on Instagram, later confirming he has no plans to fight Barnes.\n\nKwame Brown Bust Life\n\nHe has since changed his YouTube display name to “Kwame Brown Bust Life.”\n\nBrown has been sharing multiple videos a day since the the feud with Barnes and Jackson began, discussing the ongoing squabble. Recent videos show Brown responding to comments made by “The Breakfast Club” hosts Charlamagne Tha God and DJ Envy about Brown’s situation.\n\nCharlamagne said on-air to “leave Kwame Brown alone,” before he spoke about Brown’s family in-depth, alluding that he’s had a hard life.\n\nBrown is actively posting on social media, including Instagram and YouTube, about the situation and continues to call out critics from his past and present day."
