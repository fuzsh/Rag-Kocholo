        "text": "After being involved in one scandal after the other, Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant got into yet another incident on Sunday.\n\nMorant was once again seen flashing a gun on an Instagram Live video, a feat that got him suspended once again.\n\nAfter the scandal broke out, a video surfaced where former NBA player Kwame Brown passionately talks about the subject, calling Morant stupid.\n\n\"So, Ja Morant, you like to play with guns, huh? You like to play with guns, huh boy? You like to play with guns... Instead of you just being at your house buying all the guns you want, playing with all the guns you want off camera, you want to get in trouble for having a gun at a club, give a bull**it apology and show a gun on Instagram Live. I've heard of NBA Youngboy but you NBA dumb boy. You gotta be the dumbest mother****er in the league,\" Kwame began.\n\n\"You got 231 million dollars promised to you and you want to be a fu**ing thug? It's ok for you to have a gun,\" Brown continued. \"You have a right, you have a 2nd Amendment right to have a gun, but what the f**k do you keep pulling it out menacing for? What is up with all this music you keep listening to? Is this music putting you in a trans, dumbass boy? Because that music is gonna cost you your fu**ing career.\"\n\nFurther on, the former player argued that a real friend would have stopped Morant from appearing in a situation that could harm him career-wise.\n\n\"You're gonna be bouncing around with ni**as all day long just listening to music in the backyard of a goddamn shack if you keep on being a jackass. You're an NBA dumb boy and your friends ain't your goddamn friends. I've done dumb shit before. You know when I notice a real friend? A real friend, they're gonna tell you when you're wrong and they ain't gonna argue with you but they just not gonna participate and go with you in the bull**it,\" Brown explained. \"See, a real friend don't keep telling a man what's right and what's wrong. You just tell him and you let them make their own decision.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't be a friend in the car next with you recording you doing something stupid. That ni**a that got that cellphone and knew you got a gun and you were dumb enough to pull it out on camera, he should've never been recording your dumbass 'cause you're an NBA dumb boy,\" Kwame said. \"Thank god you can shoot a goddamn basketball and you can jump, because that's about all you can do.\"\n\nAccording to Brown, Morant is trying to portray a person he is not, a remark that is often heard among NBA fans. Notably, Morant grew up in a stable family and didn't have to deal with being poor or having to live with a single parent.\n\n\"Your brain is fucked up. You got 231 million dollars and you trying to be a street n**ga? What kind of dumbass shit is that? Real ni**as don't think you no street ni**a, dumbass boy. Real ni**as can't wait for you to come to the chain gang, they gonna see how high your ass jump,\" Brown said about Morant ending up in prison. \"Your ass gonna be playing ball at goddamn the Pelican Bay, jumping over ni**as in the chain gang, they gonna knock your ass out of the air. They ain't gonna let you just dunk on them like that.\"\n\n\"You wanna be the new Gilbert Arenas. You wanna be the new motherfucking Gilbert Arenas. It's just fu**ed up-ass culture where a black man just can't be a fu**ing black man. He gotta be a dumb ni**a, pulling out guns and shit just because he's listening to a goddamn song,\" Kwame continued. \"Since when music and a gun go together, you dumb motherfu**er? Why all you ni**as gotta have a gun, menacing in the air the goddamn gun like that mean anything?\"\n\nBrown said that Morant is only harming himself trying to be the person he is not. At the same time, he's putting himself at the level of his friends when instead he should be showing an example.\n\n\"All you're doing is making yourself look stupid. You're allowing yourself to the level of your motherfu**ing friends, and they're not your friends. Your friends should've looked at you with your motherfu**ing gun in your hand, slapped that motherfu**er out your hand, and fought you on camera. You know why? At least the white folks that paying you could say 'Well, at least he got somebody around that cares about him'. That ni**a should've been whooping your ass with that gun on camera so no white folks can void your goddamn contract,\" Kwame shared his view.\n\n\"Somebody needs to tell just like it is - you a dumb stupid n**a. If that's the point that you wanted to get across, that you a dumb stupid ni**a, I believe you. All this goddamn money these white folks are giving out, 231 million dollars, and you ni**a just trying to give it back? 'I don't want no 231 million dollars, the fuck you give this money for? Get some of that shit back.' You're stupid for no goddamn reason,\" Brown concluded.\n\nThank you for being with us! Subscribe to BN+ and browse ad-free."
