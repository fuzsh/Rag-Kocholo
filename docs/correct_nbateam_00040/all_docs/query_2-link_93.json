        "text": "Measurables\n\n: Brown is a 6-11 center heading into his ninth season. He'll be 28 in March.\n\nWhat he brings\n\n: Brown is the Pistons' best rebounder and a decent defensive player in the post. Per-36 minutes last season, Brown averaged more than 10 rebounds per game. If he played in enough games to qualify, his 17.2 rebound percentage would have put him among the top 10 in the league.\n\nBut let's be real: Brown is going to be nothing more than a situational player, used when the Pistons play teams like Boston, Cleveland or Orlando, with big bruising centers. Brown is strong, can give six fouls in those situations and can keep the team competitive on the boards. That's it.\n\nHis greatest asset might be his expiring contract. No one quite knows what to expect from this new-look Pistons team. If they turn out to be pretty good, there's a chance that Joe Dumars could look for help at the trading deadline. Kwame is his biggest trade chip because of that contract, and he's already been traded for All-Stars twice in his career, to the\n\nand to the\n\n. Maybe, let's say, I don't know, the New Orleans Hornets decide they need to save $4 million next year by\n\n... it wouldn't be the first time they\n\n.\n\nIs it unlikely? Sure, but many NBA teams aren't in good financial shape, so competitive teams with expiring contracts are always in a good position to add a decent player on the cheap.\n\nWhat you won't see\n\n: Athleticism, any semblance of a post game, good free throw shooting ... offense has never been Kwame's thing. His\n\n, and have contributed to his struggles on offense. For a guy whose offensive game is pretty much exclusively put-backs and finishing on catches close to the basket, he's been through\n\n.\n\nHe also turns it over a ridiculous amount for a guy who touches the ball so infrequently. His turnover percentage (average number of turnovers per 100 plays) was 18.3 last year. Conversely, Rasheed Wallace, top five in the league in turnover percentage, was at\n\n.\n\nHow he fits\n\n: While I wrote yesterday\n\n, Kwame Brown is about the worst fit possible. The lack of athleticism is known, but even guys like Sheed, who was not the most athletic big in the league, can excel in an up-tempo offense if they are good rebounders, good outlet passers and have shooting range so they can catch the ball trailing on a fast break and be in a position to shoot.\n\nKwame, obviously, can do none of those things, making it hard to believe he wouldn't dramatically slow down a lineup featuring some combination of Bynum, Stuckey, Gordon, Rip and Villanueva.\n\nBrown has a role when the team plays opponents with size, but when they don't, even Ben Wallace and his extremely limited offense is a better fit with the more up-tempo personnel.\n\nFun Factor\n\n: There is something infinitely likable about Brown. He faced ridiculous pressure as the first high-schooler picked No. 1 overall, he was\n\n, he was set up for failure twice by being traded for All-Stars who obviously out-performed him, he had the\n\n... and yet, despite it all, he seems to be a\n\nby his teammates.\n\nHe's also funny, as evidenced by\n\n:\n\nBrown certainly isn't the worst situational big a team could have on it's bench, and if his contract helps bring about a one-sided trade in favor of the Pistons, his signing will go down as one of Joe Dumars' big successes.\n\nPreviously\n\n:"
