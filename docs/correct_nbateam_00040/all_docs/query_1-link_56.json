        "text": "Everyone is dunking on Ja Morant.\n\nKwame Brown went on a scathing, expletive-filled rant against Morant after it appeared the Grizzlies star flashed a gun again on Instagram Live over the weekend.\n\n“I’ve heard of NBA YoungBoy, but you are NBA Dumb Boy,” Brown said in a nine-minute video posted to his YouTube page. “You got to be the dumbest motherf–ker in the league. You’ve got $231 million promised to you and you want to be a f–king thug.”\n\nIt is the second time in recent months that Morant was seen with a firearm on an Instagram Live video.\n\nThe first incident, which occurred at a Denver-area strip club on March 4, led to an eight-game suspension and an apology.\n\nThe 23-year-old has apparently not learned his lesson and could face a much stiffer punishment this time.\n\nThe Grizzlies, who as the No. 2 seed lost to the Lakers in the first round of the NBA playoffs, suspended Morant from all team activities for the time being.\n\n“Yeah, it’s OK for you to have a gun,” Brown said in the video as he paced around a house. “You have a Second Amendment right to have a gun. But what the f–k you keep pulling it out menacing for?\n\n“What is all this music you keep listening to? Is this music keep putting you in a trance? Because this music is about to cost you your f–king career.”\n\nBrown, whose YouTube page is titled “Kwame Brown Bust Life,” is considered one of the more disappointing No. 1 picks in NBA history.\n\nBrown, taken No. 1 by the Wizards in the 2001 NBA Draft, finished his NBA career averaging six points and five rebounds per game.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Brown earned over $63 million in a career that spanned 12 seasons and seven franchises.\n\nThe idea of Morant potentially risking an NBA fortune is too much for the 41-year-old Brown to take, as he hurled insults at the embattled Grizzlies star throughout the speech.\n\n“Your friends ain’t your goddamn friends because I’ve done dumb s–t before and you know when I noticed a real friend, they are going to tell you when you’re wrong and they ain’t going to argue with you but they just ain’t going to go with you and participate with the bulls–t,” said Brown, who was arrested for a DUI and a disorderly conduct in two separate incidents during his playing career."
