        "text": "In his day, Michael Jordan lived for vengeance, whether the\n\naffront to him was real or imagined. So, too, does 19-year-old\n\nKwame Brown, who was certain he was not the Washington Wizards'\n\nfirst choice--\"a scrub\" is how he thought they viewed him--as they\n\nconsidered their options for the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft.\n\nWhen Brown arrived in Washington 12 days before the draft for his\n\nsecond meeting with team president Jordan and his staff, no one\n\nwas at the airport to meet him. The driver who finally showed up\n\nwasn't sure where he was supposed to deliver Brown, and when\n\nBrown reached his hotel, he was told there was no reservation for\n\nhim. It turned out that his last name had been misspelled. \"How\n\ncan you not get that right?\" Brown says.\n\nThe slipups, however, didn't bring out the worst in Brown; he's\n\nnot the type to be petulant. No, Brown used the Wizards' apparent\n\nindifference to build some Jordanesque animosity toward his chief\n\nrival in the draft, 7-foot high school star Tyson Chandler. When\n\nBrown arrived at Washington's practice facility, he ran into\n\nChandler, who let him know that he'd been meeting with Jordan's\n\npeople for two days. Kwame-come-lately was then told to wait on\n\nthe sideline as the Wizards put Chandler through an individual\n\nworkout. \"It was like they were coaching him--'Come on,\n\nTyson!'--like he was their player already,\" says Brown. With a\n\nshrug he adds, \"So then I went out and killed him. Killed him.\"\n\nIf Jordan was looking for a competitor reminiscent of himself, he\n\nsaw glimpses of one that June day as the 6'11\", 250-pound Brown\n\nrepeatedly lowered his thick shoulders and dismantled the\n\n235-pound Chandler one-on-one. When the Wizards said they had\n\nseen enough, Brown walked over to Jordan, his hero, and vowed,\n\n\"If you draft me first, I'll never disappoint you.\" Before\n\nturning away, the teenager offered a prediction for a one-on-one\n\nshowdown in the not-so-distant future: \"And I'll beat you.\"\n\nThe Wizards, who on June 27 made Brown the first high school\n\nplayer to be chosen No. 1, maintain that he was wrong to think\n\nthey had their hearts set on Chandler. Nonetheless, assistant\n\ngeneral manager Rod Higgins likes hearing that Brown reacted to\n\nthe perceived slight as Jordan would have. \"If that's the\n\ncompetitive nature Kwame has,\" Higgins says, \"then he's off to a\n\ngood start.\"\n\nGrowing up in the shrimping town of Brunswick, Ga. (pop. 16,433),\n\nBrown would watch Jordan on TV whenever he could, learning from\n\nhis example and drawing strength from whatever similarities to\n\nHis Airness he found. His competitiveness and poise may change\n\nthe perceptions of those opposed to high school players\n\nleapfrogging college and going directly to the NBA. Though Brown\n\ndeclared for the draft the night before his senior prom at Glynn\n\nAcademy, he appears to be as centered, mature and reasonable as\n\nany draftee this side of Shane Battier.\n\nBrown turns stereotypes on their heads, beginning with the one\n\nabout young men in households where the father is absent: His\n\ncircumstances actually improved significantly when his father\n\nleft. Kwame was six or seven years old when the police came to\n\nhis Charleston, S.C., home and arrested Willie James Brown on a\n\ncriminal charge that Kwame cannot recall. What he does remember\n\nis that it was the last time they saw each other. Kwame's mother,\n\nJoyce Brown, who has said she was beaten by her husband, soon\n\nmoved with her eight children out of Charleston, eventually\n\nending up in her hometown of Brunswick. In 1990 Willie was\n\nsentenced to life without parole for murdering his 22-year-old\n\ngirlfriend with an ax handle and burying her in a shallow grave\n\nalong a suburban Charleston road.\n\n\"He's pretty much dead to me,\" Kwame says of his 59-year-old\n\nfather. He has heard that Willie would like to renew their\n\nrelationship, now that his son is guaranteed more than $9.9\n\nmillion over the next three years. While the Reverend John\n\nWilliams, Kwame's pastor, predicts that Kwame will someday visit\n\nEvans Correctional Institution in Bennettsville, S.C., and\n\nconfront his father, it is not high on his list of priorities.\n\n\"He used to beat all of us,\" says Kwame, the second youngest of\n\nthe eight children. \"He would tell us, 'I gave my life to the\n\ndevil.' We couldn't say anything about God, about church--nothing.\n\nHe would pick up whatever he could find and beat you or spank\n\nyou. The next day he would come home from work with a gift for\n\nyou. I don't know why. I guess that was how he would try to buy\n\nyour friendship.\"\n\nThe relief the family felt when Willie was arrested was tempered\n\nby the realities of life without the regular paycheck he earned\n\nas a truck driver. Joyce did the best she could by finding work\n\nas a maid at the Brunswick Days Inn. While raising her children,\n\nshe suffered from high blood pressure, lost a kidney to disease\n\nand eventually went on disability with a bad back. After living\n\nhand-to-mouth for so many years, Kwame has a hard time imagining\n\nhimself wasting money, no matter how much he is paid. \"Invest it\n\nright and don't spend money on all those stupid little chains\n\neverybody wears, and you'll be all right,\" he says.\n\nYet as recently as three years ago, admits the apparently\n\nlevelheaded Brown, he was following the path of his father. \"I\n\ncould be in prison right now,\" he says. \"I grew up around a bunch\n\nof violent people, and if anybody did something wrong to me, I\n\nwould hit the person. The payback for anything was physical\n\nabuse.\"\n\nOne symptom of Brown's lack of direction was his poor performance\n\nin school, which led him to Williams during his sophomore year.\n\nThe associate director of The Gathering Place, a ministry for\n\nteenagers in Brunswick, Williams filled the role of the father\n\nBrown never had. \"He was just a lazy guy,\" says the 37-year-old\n\nWilliams, who impressed on Brown the need to hit the books. Brown\n\nmade honor roll in his last four semesters and qualified to play\n\nfor Florida, whose scholarship offer he accepted last summer\n\nbefore deciding to enter the draft. Brown also joined the church,\n\nsang in the choir and two years ago was baptized by Williams. Mr.\n\nJohn, as Brown refers to him, even cuts his hair.\n\nIn the last of his four years as a starter at Glynn, Brown\n\naveraged 20.1 points, 13.3 rebounds and 5.8 blocked shots. Beyond\n\nhis physical skills, he impressed NBA scouts by demonstrating a\n\ngood rapport with his less gifted teammates. Brown says he never\n\nrealized he might be the best high school player in the country\n\nuntil last summer, when he began to meet the bigger national\n\nnames. Against fellow lottery selections Chandler (the No. 2\n\npick), Eddy Curry (No. 4) and DeSagana Diop (No. 8), he more than\n\nheld his own.\n\nUnlike most other high school draft choices of recent years,\n\nBrown has the muscle to play inside as a rookie, and his strength\n\nwill increase as he begins lifting weights regularly for the\n\nfirst time. He didn't fill out until this year--\"I wasn't 200\n\npounds until I was a junior,\" he says--by which point he was\n\nalready a deft ball handler with a reliable midrange jumper.\n\n\"Everybody in the NBA has to have a great jump shot,\" he says.\n\n\"If I develop mine more, I could even play some small forward.\"\n\nAgain, he uses Jordan as his model, noting that he perfected the\n\nturnaround shot that made him unstoppable. \"What Mike did, he\n\nfound out what his weaknesses were, and he kept working on them\n\nuntil he didn't have any,\" Brown says. \"That's what I need to\n\ndo.\"\n\nJordan has already invited his new protege to his estate in\n\nsuburban Chicago for 10 days of well-heeled boot camp in August.\n\n\"The guy took probably the biggest risk of his life, picking a\n\nhigh school player Number 1,\" Brown says. \"I'm conscious that if\n\nI screw up, I'm messing with Michael's reputation. I know he's\n\ngoing to work me to death.\"\n\nWhen they sat together during a press conference in Washington\n\nafter the draft, Brown playfully repeated his vow to beat his\n\nboss. \"That is a dream,\" responded Jordan. This is a relationship\n\nunlike any Jordan has experienced in basketball. After spending a\n\ncareer making sure he was the preeminent player in the game,\n\nJordan now finds it in his own best interests to make Kwame Brown\n\nthe league's best. Little did young Kwame imagine, as he was\n\nwatching his idol on TV all those years ago, that he would be the\n\none chosen by Jordan to extend his legacy.\n\nSays Williams, who knows a bit about the big picture, \"I really\n\ndon't think it's an accident it's turned out this way.\"\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: PHOTOGRAPH BY BILL FRAKES\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: JOAN PARKER/THE BRUNSWICK NEWS \"I'm conscious that if I screw up,\" says Brown (left), \"I'm messing with Michael's reputation.\""
