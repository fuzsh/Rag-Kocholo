Marc Riboud is a master of composition with a keen eye for the ideal placement of content and the effects of lines and planes. The French Magnum photographer, born in 1923, owes his fame primarily to his series of photographs of China. The Leica Gallery at PHOTOFAIRS | Shanghai presents a comprehensive cross-section of his works shot between 1957 and 2002. Earlier and even more exceptional rarities are the aerial pictures of China, captured by aviation pioneer Count of Castell-Rüdenhausen, a pilot who explored and photographed China from the air with his Leica in the 1930s. The exhibition gives visitors the opportunity to rediscover the extraordinary colour photographs he brought back from his travels. In addition to these highlights of photographic history, contemporary images show another facet of photography in China: two young Asian photographers surprise viewers by showing China in an entirely different light – sometimes peaceful and poetic, sometimes bright and unconventional – their photographs as diverse as China itself.\n\nNET-A-PORTER, Vernissage Partner, presents an exhibition featuring fashion images of iconic celebrities from Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore and fashion icons Kate Moss and Miranda Kerr, to shining Chinese stars like Li Bingbing and He Sui. The exhibition includes the work of world-renowned fashion photographers including David Bellemere, Yin Chao, Steven Pan, Chris Colls, Yelena Yemchuk and Sebastian Kim, to name a few.

It will include the public debut of the artists’ new work, No Name. Wang Ningde has continually used his works to expand the boundaries of image art, and the No Name series once again reflects his keen insight and experimental vision. In the work the artists has photographically collected numerous markings left by the brushstrokes of nameless people in urban spaces as creative elements.
