And contrary to popular belief, the impact of Internet of Things and Wearable Technology will be much greater than a smart light bulb or a fitness tracker. Connecting everything will dramatically reshape our world in ways we can barely imagine. Locating a wandering Alzheimer’s patient by sensors embedded within lighting poles in a smart city, or detecting if a driver is having a heart attack by analyzing vital signs and facial expressions by a system integrated within a vehicle’s ­dashboard, are just a couple of scenarios these technologies will be capable of doing. We will also witness the fantasy of fully automated smart cities and driverless vehicles work in coordination with one another fairly soon. Today, IoT and Wearable Technology are recognized as two of the fastest-­ growing technologies and hottest research topics in academia and research and development centers. Wearable devices, which are characterized by being lightweight, energy-efficient, ergonomic, and potentially reconfigurable are expected to substantially expand the applications of modern consumer electronics. Similarly, there has been a massive interest in smart objects that can be connected to the Internet allowing remote access, processing, and control, which enable innovative services and applications. Such objects are utilized in smart homes, healthcare, power grids, transportation, and numerous other industrial applications. Although IoT and wearable devices are electronic systems by definition, the study of these interrelated technologies is multidisciplinary and borrows concepts from electrical, mechanical, biomedical, computer, and industrial engineering, in addition to computational sciences. Having worked in this field for almost 12 years in both academic and industrial capacities, I feel the need to compile a comprehensive technical resource that academically tackles the various design aspects of these technologies. The aim of this book is to provide an extensive guide to the design and proto­ typing of IoT and Wearable Technology devices, in addition to introducing their\n\nxviii\n\nPreface\n\ndetailed architecture and practical design considerations. The book also offers a detailed and systematic design and prototyping processes of typical use cases, ­covering all practical features. It should be noted that this book attempts to address the design and prototyping aspects of these technologies from an engineering/ technical perspective rather than from a maker/hobbyist perspective. The intended audience of the book encompasses both undergraduate and graduate students working on projects related to IoT and Wearable Technology. The book also serves as an extensive resource for research and development scientists, university professors, industry professionals, and practicing technologists. It is worth noting that familiarity with fundamental computer programming, mathematics, electricity laws and properties, digital and information theories, and basic networking and computer architecture is required to understand the topics covered in this book. Chapter 1 of this book helps the reader understand what IoT and wearables exactly are and examine their characteristics. The chapter also provides an overview of the history and beginnings of IoT and Wearable Technology and aims at demystifying the differences between the two. Chapter 2 covers the applications of IoT and wearables in various fields. It also provides an insight on the roles these applications could play in practice and discusses the challenges and key success factors for their adoption. Various architectures used in IoT and wearable devices along with important architecture concepts will be discussed in Chapter 3. Further, simplified and versatile architectures are proposed to help the reader articulate the key functions and elements of IoT and wearable devices. Chapter 4 highlights the capabilities, characteristics, and functionality of sensors and actuators with an understanding of their limitations and their role in IoT and wearable systems. Criteria for selecting microprocessors and communication modules will be discussed next. Additionally, deciding on a suitable energy source with a matching application-specific power management design is discussed. Finally, the reader will gain an understanding on how to bring these foundational elements together to realize a smart devices that makes most IoT and wearable use cases possible. Chapter 5 takes a look at the characteristics and basics of the communication protocols that IoT and wearables employ for their data exchange, along with a dive into some of the most common technologies being deployed today. Chapter 6 discusses the development process and design considerations that developers must follow to guarantee a successful launch of IoT and wearable products. Chapter 7 provides an overview of cloud topologies and platforms, and an architectural synopsis of OpenStack cloud. Next, Edge topologies and computing technologies will be presented. It will be shown that the maximum value from an IoT\n\nPreface\n\nor wearable technology project can only be gained from an optimal combination of cloud and edge computing, and not by a cloud-only architecture. Chapter 8 examines security goals that every designer should aim to achieve. Next, an overview of the most important security challenges, threats, attacks, and vulnerabilities faced by IoT and wearable devices is provided. Finally, a list of security design consideration and best practices and ideas that have historically worked are discussed. Chapter 9 first addresses the privacy issues and concerns arising from IoT and Wearable Technology, including those related to health data and data collected from children. The chapter next turns to safety and health issues then discusses the social and psychological impacts of these technologies. Finally, this chapter examines regulatory actions in the United States performed by the federal ­government, including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA), as well as the ones performed by the private sector practicing self-regulation within the industry. As a means of comparison, this chapter next discusses the regulatory actions taken by the European Union. Finally, the aim of Chapter 10 is to apply the knowledge learned in previous chapters to design two complete IoT and Wearable Technology products from scratch.

In the midst of this, the topics of Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable technology have begun to enjoy tremendous popularity thanks to the rapid advancements in digital systems, communication and information technologies, and innovative manufacturing and packaging techniques. IoT and wearable devices have managed to swiftly gain a notable position in the consumer electronics market and are now making their way to become the new go-to technologies to address the needs of many industries. For instance, the retail industry has begun to use innovative inventory tracking and theft prevention devices based on IoT. The smart tag system enables self-checkout and allows business owners to track and manage their inventory in real time. The construction and mining sectors are increasingly investing in the use of wearable devices for hazard and health management by monitoring the environmental quality, detecing of approaching hazards, and assessing the physiological parameters of workers. IoTbased solutions are already being utilized in agriculture. Such systems are used to evaluate field variables such as soil condition, atmospheric parameters, and biological signals from plants and animals. They are also used to analyze and control variables such as temperature, PH levels, humidity, and vibrations, while being transported. Moreover, wearables are emerging as a solution to make healthcare accessible in remote areas (i.e. telemedicine). A plethora of wearable devices is already being used by medical professionals to aggregate physiological, behavioral, and biochemical data for diagnosing, treating, and managing chronic diseases.\n\nFundamentals of IoT and Wearable Technology Design, First Edition.

Their potential benefits are virtually limitless, and their applications are radically changing the way we live and are opening new opportunities for growth and innovation. This is just the tip of a massive iceberg. This chapter presents a general overview and characteristics of IoT and wearable technology followed by a historical background; and finally, challenges that face these technologies are discussed.\n\n1.1.1 IoT and Wearables Market Size With around 18 billion devices connected to the Internet as of 2018, Cisco Systems predicts that this number will reach 50 billion by 2020. A recent report by the United Kingdom government speculates that this number could be even higher, in the range of 100 billion “things” connected. A recent market analysis reports that the combined markets of IoT and wearables will grow to about $520 billion in 2021, compared to $235 billion spent in 2017. Another report indicated that the global shipments of wearables reached 49.6 million units in 2019, 55.2% up from 2018, with smart watches and wristbands continuing to dominate the wearables landscape, accounting for 63.2% of all devices shipped in that year. It is anticipated that the global wearables market share will exceed $51.50 billion by 2022. What these numbers mean is that IoT and wearables will primarily shift the way people and businesses interact with their surroundings. Management and monitoring smart objects and systems using real-time connectivity will enable an entirely new level of data-driven decision making. This in turn will yield to ­optimized processes and deliver new services that save time and money for both people and enterprises.\n\n1.1.2 The World of IoT and Wearables The capability of IoT and wearable devices to communicate, process, and exchange information is the basis of their operation dynamics. These devices encompass a wide range of electronic components, sensors, actuators, computing technologies, in addition to communication and information protocols. Such technologies and protocols include but are not limited to wireless sensor networks, edge and cloud computing, big data analytics, embedded systems, security architectures, web services, and semantic search engines. However, this is also true for several other existing devices and technologies, so what makes them different?\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\n1.1.2.1 What Is an IoT Device?\n\nWe have been connecting devices and “things” to the Internet and other networks for decades. Technologies such as automated teller machine (ATM), wireless sensor networks (WSN), machine to machine (M2M), and other connected devices are not new at all. However, this does not mean by definition that all these systems and devices are part of what we know today as the IoT. In other words, not all connected devices are IoT devices; however, all IoT devices are connected devices. Furthermore, in IoT we use the Internet Protocol (IP), IPv6,1 in particular. Hence, we only pronounce the word Internet of Things when “things” are uniquely addressable. There are many IoT definitions, and there isn’t a universal one. It depends from which angle it is being looked at: Technology angle, application angle, or the industry angle. However, from a general perspective IoT could be defined as the interconnection of devices with embedded sensing, actuating, and communication capabilities. Data in IoT are collected, processed, coordinated, and communicated through embedded electronics, firmware, and communication technologies, protocols, and platforms. 1.1.2.2 Characteristics of IoT Systems\n\nWe can also define the IoT as a network of connected devices, which have embedded and/or equipped with technologies that enable them to perceive, aggregate, and communicate meaningful information about the environment in which they are placed in, and/or themselves. The key characteristics of IoT from a broad-view perspective are as follows: Unique Identity: As mentioned above, IoT is a network of connected devices with unique identifiers. It should be noted, however, that not all IoT devices are directly connected to the Internet. It is not always possible or even desirable to do so. In fact, a good number of IoT devices in a smart home or a factory setting communicate via a non-IP link such as ZigBee or low-power wide-area network (LoRaWAN), which enables these devices to communicate over distances with gateways that interface to standard IP networks. It should also be noted that when such devices use IP, it does not by default mean they are using the public Internet. There could be home and enterprise networks that use IP with data traffic that may never touch the public Internet. Also, even if there is a cluster 1 IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is a network protocol launched in 2012 that enables data communications over a packet-switched network. The explosive growth in connected devices has driven a need for additional unique IP addresses. The previous standard IPv4 supported a maximum of approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses, while IPv6 supports a theoretical maximum of 3.4 × 1038 addresses.\n\n3\n\n4\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\nof non-IP devices communicating with an aggregation gateway, beyond that gateway, the expectation is that the traffic will be IP-based. Hence, all the “nodes” of the IoT are expected to create some sort of IP traffic, whether directly, or through some gateway. Sensing and Actuating: Sensors and actuators are two crucial elements in IoT ­systems. Sensors are used to perceive and gather information about some dynamic activity (pressure, temperature, altitude, etc.). The collected information is resulted from the interaction of the sensor with the environment. A more general expression for a sensor is a transducer. A transducer is any device that converts one form of energy into another. A microphone, for instance, is a transducer that takes sound energy and converts it to electrical energy in a ­useful manner for other components in the system to correlate with. An actuator is another type of transducer that is found in the majority of IoT ­systems. Actuators operate in the reverse manner as sensors. They typically take a form of energy and convert it into a physical action. For example, a speaker takes an electrical signal and converts it into a diaphragm vibration which replicates an audio signal. Connectivity, Communication, and Data Distribution: IoT devices are connected to the Internet either directly or through another device (gateway) where network connections are used for transporting data and interacting with users. Also, these devices allow users to access information and/or control devices remotely using a variety of communication protocols and technologies. Automation: Regardless of the application, most IoT devices are about automation, such as in industrial automation, business process automation, or home automation. Thus, such devices can generate, exchange, and produce data with minimal or no human intervention. Intelligence: Intelligence in IoT lies in the knowledge extraction from the generated data and the smart utilization of this knowledge to solve a challenge, automate a process, or improve a situation. There is no real IoT benefit without artificial intelligence, machine learning, Big Data2 analytics, and cognitive algorithms. Figure 1.1 depicts the abovementioned IoT characteristics. 1.1.2.3 What Exactly Is a Wearable Device?\n\nThe term “wearable devices” generally refers to electronic and computing technologies that are incorporated into accessories or garments which can comfortably be 2 Big Data is a term that describes the diverse and large volumes of data that grow at an increasing rate. It encompasses the volume of information, the speed at which it is created, aggregated, and collected, and the variety of points being covered. Typically, Big Data comes from multiple sources and takes multiple formats.\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\nUnique identity\n\nSensing & actuating\n\nConnectivity\n\nIoT\n\nAutomation Intelligence\n\nCommunication & data distribution\n\nFigure 1.1 Characteristics of the Internet of Things.\n\nworn on the user’s body. These devices are capable of performing several of the tasks and functions as smartphones, laptops, and tablets. However, in some cases, wearable devices can perform tasks more conveniently and more efficiently than portable and hand-held devices. They also tend to be more sophisticated in terms of sensory feedback and actuating capabilities as compared to hand-held and portable technologies. The ultimate purpose of wearable technology is to deliver reliable, consistent, convenient, seamless, and hands-free digital services. Typically, wearable devices provide feedback communications of some sort to allow the user to view/access information in real time. A friendly user interface is also an essential feature of such devices, so is an ergonomic design. Examples of wearable devices include smart watches, bracelets, eyewear (i.e.: glasses, contact lenses), headgears (i.e.: helmets), and smart clothing. Figure 1.2 depicts the most important possible forms of wearable devices. While typical wearable devices tend to refer to items which can be placed external to the body surface or clothing, there are more invasive forms as in the case of implantable electronics and sensors. In the author’s opinion, invasive implantables, i.e. ingestible sensors, under the skin microchips, and smart tattoos, which are generally used for medical and tracking purposes, should not be categorized as wearables since they have different mechanisms and operation requirements. The reader should seek other resources which are dedicated to the design and prototyping of such devices.\n\n5\n\nForms of wearable technology\n\nHeadwear\n\nEyewear\n\nEarwear\n\nBodywear\n\nArm, Wrist, & Hand-wear\n\nFootwear\n\nHelmets & Headsets\n\nGlasses\n\nEarrings\n\nClothing and Smart Textile\n\nWatches, Wristbands, & Jewelry\n\nShoes and Insoles\n\nHats & Headbands\n\nContact lenses\n\nEar inserts\n\nAccessories & skin patches\n\nGloves & armbands\n\nSocks\n\nFigure 1.2 Forms of wearable technology.\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\n1.1.2.4 Characteristics of Wearable Devices\n\nThe uses of wearables are far reaching and have exciting potentials in the fields of medicine, well-being, sports, aging, disabilities, education, transportation, enterprise, and entertainment. The main objective of wearable technology in each of these fields is to smoothly incorporate functional and portable electronics into the users’ daily routines. Prior to their existence in the consumer market, wearables were primarily employed in the fields of military technology and health sector. Generally speaking, wearables share many aspects of the sensing, connectivity, automation, and intelligence characteristics with IoT devices. However, there are a few major differences worth highlighting which will be discussed in the following sections. Form factor is a hardware design aspect in electronics packaging which specifies the physical dimensions, shape, weight, and other components specifications of the printed circuit board (PCB) or the device itself. Although wearable devices have a small form factor in general, it is practically dependent on the type and the way they are worn (rings and wristbands, as opposed to glasses and clothing). Smaller form factors may offer reduced usage of material, easy handling, and simpler logistics; however, they typically give rise to higher design and manufacturing costs in addition to signal integrity issues and maintenance constraints. Moreover, durability, comfort, aesthetics, and ergonomic factors are important when it comes to designing a wearable device. Weight, shape, color, and texture must be carefully considered. The general characteristics of wearable technology are presented in Figure 1.3. 1.1.2.5 IoT vs. M2M\n\nM2M describes the technology that enables the communication between two or more machines. With M2M, one could connect machines, devices, and appliances in a wired or wireless fashion via a variety of communications techniques to deliver services with limited human intervention. The difference between machine to machine (M2M) and IoT can be confusing to many. In fact, the misconception that M2M and IoT are the same has been a continuing subject of debate in the realm of tech industry. Both M2M and IoT are connectivity solutions that provide remote access to machine data. They both have the capability of exchanging information among machines without human intervention. Thus, the two terms have been mistakenly interchanged often. However, M2M is a predecessor to IoT and had revolutionized enterprise operations by enabling them to monitor and manage their machines and hardware components remotely. M2M set the underlying basis of machine connectivity on which IoT built upon. Nevertheless, IoT is the ultimate manifestation when it comes to connectivity.\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\nSensing Low power\n\nConnectivity\n\nWearable technology\n\nComfort & ergonomics\n\nFashionability Intelligence\n\nFigure 1.3 Characteristics of wearable technology.\n\nThe main objective of M2M is to connect a machine/device to another machine (typically in an industrial setting) via cellular or wired network so that its status can be monitored and its data can be collected, remotely. IoT is more of a universal market technology that aims at serving consumers, industries, and enterprises. Consumer IoT connects users to their devices and enables remote access. On the other hand, enterprise and industrial IoT take it further by allowing tracking, control, and management. IoT and M2M diverge immensely when it comes to the way they access devices remotely. M2M relies on point-to-point communications enabled by dedicated hardware components integrated within the machine. The communication among these connected machines is made possible via wired or conventional ­cellular network and dedicated software. IoT, on the other hand, typically uses IP networks and integrates web applications to interface device/machine data to a middleware, and in the majority of cases, to cloud. It is worth noting that IoT is intrinsically more scalable than M2M since cloudbased architectures do not need additional hard-wired connections and subscriber identification modules (SIM) which are required in M2M. 1.1.2.6 IoT vs. Wearables\n\nDespite the commonalities, it is clear that there are substantial differences when we speak about wearable technology in the context of fitness trackers as opposed\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\nto when IoT is used in the context of manufacturing processes or smart cities. In fact, many experts in the field argue that wearables fall under the umbrella of IoT. One key difference worth highlighting here is that most wearables rely on a gateway device, such as a smartphone, for configuration and connectivity, and in most cases to enable features and process data. It is this M2M aspect that makes wearables a separate class of devices, and that’s why we prefer to treat these as two technologies with two sets of characteristics. It is also worth noting that not all wearable devices require connectivity, for example, a simple pedometer and an ultraviolet monitor could operate offline. Other wearables require minimal connectivity only. Although IoT and wearable devices have a lot in common in terms of design aspects, components, and technologies and protocols used, there are still some real differences that architects and designers need to be aware of. Figure 1.4 shows a table summarizing the main differences between M2M, IoT, and Wearable Technology.\n\nM2M\n\nIoT\n\nWearable tech.\n\nA concept where two or more machines communicate and perform functions without human intervention\n\nAn ecosystem of internet connected devices with the ability to collect and transfer information over a network to provide automated decision making\n\nElectronic devices that can be worn or incorporated with clothing to collect, process and conveniently deliver data and services to the user\n\nMainly industrial: ATM Smart utility meters Vending machines\n\nIndustrial and consumer: Smart appliances Samart thermostat Smart home assistant\n\nMainly consumer: Fitness tracking Smart watches VR and AR headsets\n\nMainly point to point Non IP based could use cloud but not necessarily\n\nThrough IP network\n\nNot necessarily connected if connected, usually requires a gateway device Typically non-IP based Could use cloud if connected\n\nDefinition\n\nTypical applications\n\nConnectivity & communication\n\nMobility & Scalability\n\nIP based Typically cloud based\n\nMainly stationary\n\nCould be stationary, mobile, and portable\n\nTypically mobile\n\nTypically not scalable or less scalable than IoT\n\nMore scalable due to its cloud based architecture\n\nCould be scalable if based on cloud\n\nFigure 1.4 A summary of the main differences between M2M, IoT, and Wearable Technology.\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\n1.1.3 IoT: Historical Background The term “IoT” has not been around for so long. However, the idea of machines communicating with one another has been brewing since the telegraph was developed in early 1800s. The first wireless transmission over a radio took place in 1900, bringing about endless innovations. This crucial ingredient of the future IoT was complemented by the inception of computers in the 1950s. An essential component of the IoT is the Internet itself which was initiated as part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in 1962 and then progressed into ARPANET in 1969. In the 1980s service providers started promoting the commercial use of ARPANET, which matured into today’s Internet. The term IoT was not officially coined until 1999 when Kevin Ashton, the executive director of Auto-ID Labs at MIT, was the first to describe the Internet of Things in a presentation for Procter & Gamble. During his speech, Ashton stated: Today computers, and, therefore, the Internet, are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the roughly 50 petabytes of data available on the Internet were first captured and created by human beings by typing, pressing a record button, taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code. The problem is, people have limited time, attention, and accuracy. All of which means they are not very good at capturing data about things in the real world. If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things, using data they gathered without any help from us, we would be able to track and count everything and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost. We would know when things needed replacing, repairing or recalling and whether they were fresh or past their best. Kevin Ashton also pioneered the radio-frequency identification (RFID) use in supply chain management and believed that it was essential for the deployment of the IoT. He concluded if all devices were uniquely identified, computers could then manage, track, and inventory them. A foundational element in realizing the IoT concept was the creation of IPV6. Steve Leibson of Intel Corporation once stated: “The address space expansion means that we could assign an IPV6 address to every atom on the surface of the earth, and still have enough addresses left to do another 100+ earths.” In other words, we have enough IP addresses to uniquely identify all the objects in the world, for hundreds of years to come. One of the early examples of an Internet of Things is from 1982, when four students from the School of Computer Science department installed switches in a Coca Cola machine at the Carnegie Melon University. The students would\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\nconnect by ARPANET to the appliance and remotely check the availability of the drink, and if it was cold, before making the trip to the machine. This experiment had inspired numerous inventors around the world to devise their own connected appliances. After the invention of the World Wide Web by the British scientist Tim BernersLee in 1989 and the launching of commercial Global Positioning System, inventors had been able to develop interconnected devices way more efficiently. One of the first examples was an Internet-connected toaster introduced by John Romkey in 1990, which is considered by many as the first “real” IoT device. In 1991, two academicians who worked at the computer laboratory in the University of Cambridge set up a camera to provide live picture of a coffee pot (known as the Trojan Room coffee pot) to all desktop computers on the office network to save people working in the building time and from getting disappointed of finding the coffee pot empty after making the trip. This invention was a true inspiration for the world’s first webcam. A few years later, the coffee pot was connected to the Internet and gained international fame until it was retired in 2001. In the year 2000, LG announces Internet Digital DIOS, the world’s first Internetenabled refrigerator. The refrigerator became a buzzword despite its commercial failure. In 2004, Walmart Inc. required its top suppliers to assign RFID tags to cases and pallets in place of barcodes by 2005 to enhance their supply chain operations. The suppliers were unhappy with the new requirements as Electronic Product Code (EPC) tags were pricey and seemed unnecessary. Walmart, subsequently, offered the suppliers to disclose point of sales information which led to a decreased merchandise thefts and labor requirements. Currently, EPC is one of the international standards, connecting billions of “things” worldwide. The year 2005 witnessed the first Internet-connected robot, the Nabaztag rabbit. The bunny-shaped robot is capable of gathering weather reports, news, and stock market updates through Wi-Fi connectivity and reading them to the consumer. Despite its retirement in 2015 due to technological impediments, Nabaztag proved that IoT can be integrated into everyday lives. The First International Conference on the Internet of Things took place in Zurich, Switzerland, in 2008. The event was the first conference of its kind with participants from 23 countries. The same year marked the first time where more “things” are connected to the Internet than people. A year later, Google started the first testing of self-driving cars while St. Jude Medical officially became an adopter of IoT for healthcare. The year 2010 marks the first time IoT was recognized on a governmental level where China’s head of government Wen Jiabao decided to pay special attention to IoT as one of the remedies to his country’s financial crisis and adopting it across top strategic industries. The same year also marks the first implementation of\n\n11\n\n12\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\nmachine learning techniques in IoT devices. Nest smart thermostat was the first IoT product to adapt to the user’s habit and thus optimizing the air conditioning schedule. By the year 2013, IoT had evolved into a system that utilizes multiple technologies, ranging from embedded systems and wireless communication to electromechanical sensors and control systems. In 2014, Google Inc. acquires Nest after spotting the potential behind IoT and smart home devices in particular. Moreover, Google’s self-driving car prototype was ready for testing on public roads but would not perform the official test drive until the following year. On the 6th November of the same year, Amazon releases Echo, the first ­commercially successful voice-controlled ambient device and IoT hub. It is also anticipated that Amazon’s device will be one of the most disruptive technologies in the next generation of enterprise IoT solutions. The Global Standards Initiative on IoT takes place in 2015. The event’s main objective was to establish a unified approach to the development of IoT technical standards and to support the adoption of the technology, globally. In 2016, the automotive giant General Motors invests $500 million in Lyft aiming at developing a network of self-driving cars. In the same year, Apple showcases HomeKit products at the Consumer Electronics show. HomeKit is a platform that allows developers to utilize a comprehensive list of software tools for smart home application. In the meantime Google releases Google Home, another smart ambient device competing with Amazon’s Echo. This year also witnessed the emergence of the first IoT malware. In 2017, Microsoft launches Azure IoT edge that allows IoT devices to deploy complex processing and analytics locally, while Amazon offers advanced security features, Google releases Cloud IoT Core which allows an easier connectivity to the cloud. Witnessing such initiatives from giant technology leaders, one can realize that IoT is here to stay.\n\n1.1.4 Wearable Technology: Historical Background The beginning of this decade has surely witnessed the increasing number of wearable devices where one can spot numerous variations of smart watches, health assistive gadgets, fitness trackers, and smart clothes on the shelves. The growing number of these sleek devices since then along with their expanding applications clearly indicates that wearables are thriving. But one may ask: When and how did it all begin? Here, we are not discussing the first ubiquitous wearable technology: the eyeglasses, which dates back to the thirteenth century, nor the abacus ring which dates back to the early days of China’s Qing dynasty in the seventeenth\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\ncentury. We are specifically addressing smart wearables that have digital ­computational power! One may be surprised to learn that much of the history of wearables is found in a “smart” shoe used to cheat at roulette tables in casinos! In 1961, Edward Thorp and Claude Shannon3 built computing devices that could predict where the ball would land on a roulette wheel which could improve the chances of winning a bet by up to 44%. Obviously, Thorp and Shannon’s apparatus was not illegal at the time of invention. One of devices was concealed in a shoe, while the other in a pack of cigarettes. It is worth mentioning that Edward Thorp credits himself as the inventor of the first wearable computing device. Other variations of such apparatus were designed and built in the 1960s and 1970s targeting the casino business, perhaps the most widely known is “George,” a shoe-based wearable device designed by Keith Taft who used his toes to operate it. The smart shoe was used to gain an advantage at Blackjack tables. Previously, in 1938, Aurex Corp., a Chicago-based electronics firm, developed the first electronic hearing aid device, marking one of the first innovations in the biomedical wearables industry. In 1958, the world’s first pacemaker was invented by Earl Bakken. One might argue that these are not “smart technologies” since they are not based on a digital computing system; however, they gave rise to their smart counterparts we know today. On the other hand, the first “smart watch” was first launched in 1975 holding the brand name “Pulsar.” The smart watch was primarily a wearable calculator that also tells time in a digital format. The Pulsar became a widely adopted gadget by electronics enthusiasts and math geeks all over the world! Despite their drastic popularity decline, these watches are still being produced by many manufacturers to this day (Figure 1.5). Some might argue that the iconic Walkman music player was the first ever wearable technology that truly went mainstream. The Japanese brand SONY launched the Walkman in 1979 and was followed by a triumphant commercial success as it significantly transformed the music listening routines for millions of consumers around the world. SONY’s Walkman production line was discontinued indefinitely in 2010 with over 220 million machines sold worldwide.\n\n3 Claude Shannon is also known as the father of information theory with his legendary paper “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” published in 1948. He is also well known for founding the digital circuit design and cryptanalysis theories in 1930s when he was in his early twenties as a master’s student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Edward Oakley “Ed” Thorp was an American mathematics professor at the University of California, Irvine between 1965 and 1977, author of the books (Beat the Dealer and Beat the Market), and blackjack player. He is best known as the “father of the wearable computer.”\n\n13\n\n14\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\nFigure 1.5 The pulsar calculator LED watch released in 1975.

It is also worth mentioning that Steve Mann is also known for creating the first wearable wireless webcam in 1994 and as the first lifelogger.4 He has also pioneered many innovations in the fields of wearable technology and digital photography (Figure 1.6). In the realm of health care, the first practical and fully digital hearing aid device was invented by Engebretson, Morley, and Popelka. Their patent, “Hearing aids, signal supplying apparatus, systems for compensating hearing deficiencies, and methods” filed in 1984 served as the basis of all subsequent digital hearing aid devices, including those produced today. The mid-1990s marked the brainstorming period for wearable technology where conferences and expos on wearables and smart textiles began to see a rise in popularity. The DARPA held its forward-thinking workshop in 1996 entitled “Wearables in 2005.” One of DARPA’s galvanizing predictions included computerized gloves that could read RFID tags. However, wearables were overshadowed by the smartphone revolution between the late 1990s and mid-2000s, smartphones were simply the consumer’s gadget of choice, due to obvious reasons.\n\n4 A lifelogger is a person who uses/wears a recording apparatus or a computer in order to capture a substantial portion of his/her life.\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\nFigure 1.6 Steve Mann wearing one of his wireless wearable webcam.

Licensed Under CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\nIn 2003, the Garmin Forerunner, a watch that tracks the user’s performance, emerged which was immediately followed by popular fitness trackers we all know today such as the Nike+, Jawbone, and Fitbit. Toward the end of 2000s, several Chinese companies started producing Global System for Mobile (GSM) phones integrated within wristbands and equipped with mini displays. On the other hand, the first smart watch, Pebble, came to the scene in 2012, followed by the much-hyped Apple Watch in 2014. Future wearables may enable new functions and services that one could barely imagine, but it is clear to see how early wearables evolved into the fascinating devices we enjoy today. 1.1.4.1 The Wearables We Know Today\n\nOne of the most publicized wearables today is the Apple Watch. The watch incorporates activity and health tracking capabilities with other Apple applications. The primary goal of the Apple Watch was to improve the way users interact with their iPhones and introduce extra convenience (Figure 1.7). The birth of the Watch began when Kevin Lynch was recruited by Apple to create a wearable technology for the wrist. He said: “People are carrying their phones with them and looking at the screen so much. People want that level of engagement. But how do we provide it in a way that’s a little more human, a little more in the moment when you’re with somebody?”. Resonating with today’s technological advancement, modern consumers take an active role in utilizing wearables to track and record data of their active lifestyles. Nowadays, wearable fitness and health trackers are capable of monitoring\n\n15\n\n16\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\nFigure 1.7 The Apple watch.

Another hot wearable, Fitbit, is capable of measuring personal fitness metrics such as the number of steps walked or climbed, heart rate, sleep patterns, and even stress levels (Figure 1.8). On the other hand, many argue that the most innovative wearable device of the decade is the Google Glass, which is fundamentally a pair of glasses equipped with a built-in microprocessor and a bundle of peripherals such as a mini display embodies by a 640 × 360 pixels prism projector that beams out a viewing screen into the user’s right eye, a gesture control pad, a camera, and a microphone. The Glass runs a specially designed operating system (Glass OS) and has 2 GB of RAM and 16 GB of flash storage, in addition to a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and a light sensor. Through such peripherals, the user could connect to his/her smartphone, access mobile Internet browser, camera, maps, and other apps by voice commands. It accesses the phone through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth which are enabled by the wireless service of the user’s mobile phone.\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\nFigure 1.8 Fitbit Surge smart watch fitness tracker.

The Glass also faced serious criticism due to concerns that its use could violate current privacy laws. In 2017, Google launched the Glass Enterprise Edition after deciding that the Glass was better suited to workers who need hands-free access to information, such as in health care, manufacturing, and logistics. In 2019, Google has announced a new version of its Enterprise Edition which has an improved processor, camera, charging unit, and various other updates. One can imagine a considerable number of applications this technology is capable of creating. In fact, the Glass is already being utilized in a number of areas once considered “futuristic.” For example, Augmedix, a San Francisco based company, developed a Glass app that allows physicians to livestream the patient visit. The company claims that electronic health record problems will be eliminated, and their system would possibly save doctors up to 15 hours a week. In 2013, Rafael Grossmann was the first surgeon to demonstrate the use of Google Glass during a live surgical procedure. In the same year, the Glass was used by an Ohio State University surgeon to consult with another colleague, remotely. Obviously, such technology could have a positive impact on the lives of people with disabilities. For example, one application is designed to enable parents to swiftly access sign language dictionary through voice commands in order to ­communicate effectively with their deaf children.\n\n17\n\n18\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\nFigure 1.9 Explorer edition of Google Glass©.

Attractions and museum tours can be immensely enhanced by displaying text or providing audible information when recognizable buildings, sculptures, and artwork are detected. Users will also be able to capture photographs and videos more conveniently, i.e. via voice command or a wink of an eye. Another helpful application dedicated to break the language barriers when traveling provides instantaneous translation. Any text visible to the Glass field of view can be translated via voice commands (Figure 1.9). Boeing is using the Glass to help their assembly crew in the connecting aircraft wire harnesses, which is a very lengthy process that requires a high volume of paperwork. The crew now could have a hands-free access to the needed information using voice commands. Stanford University is conducting a breakthrough research dedicated to help autism patients read the emotions of others using the Glass by utilizing facial recognition software to determine the emotions expressed on the people’s faces projected within the display. In 2014, Novartis and Google X (now X)5 started the testing of a smart contact lens in the field of telehealth.6 The lens is equipped with a miniaturized glucose sensor that continuously tracks blood sugar levels through the diabetic patient’s tears and communicates the data to a smartphone through a wireless module. In 2018, Verily 5 X is an American semi-secret R&D center founded by Google in 2010 with the name Google X. The company’s first project was Google’s self-driving car. It is located about 0.5 mile from Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. 6 Telehealth, also known as Telemedicine, is providing healthcare services from a distance through the use of telecommunication and information technologies. It came as a solution to improve access to healthcare services that would not be readily available, especially in remote regions.\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\nSoft contact lens\n\nencapsulates electronics\n\nSensor detects glucose in tears\n\nChip and antenna receives power and sends info\n\nFigure 1.10 Infographic photo of the Google Smart Lens©. Source: Photo courtesy of Google Inc.\n\n(a former division of Google X) announced that the lens project has been dismissed due to the lack of correlation between blood glucose and tears (Figure 1.10). However, competitors started to take advantage of Google’s lens failures to work on developing their own smart eye wearables. For example, EPGLMed is working with Apple, to develop a smart lens that corrects vision on-demand by changing the ­curvature of the lenses through a smartphone app. In summary, the applications of wearable technology are extremely powerful and they are evolving rapidly. It is crystal clear that this technology is here to stay.\n\n1.1.5 Challenges While the IoT and wearable technology continue to transform our lives in the twenty-first century, significant challenges that could stand in the way of realizing its full potential are coming to light. Below are the major challenges that require full attention: 1.1.5.1 Security\n\nSecurity is one of the cornerstones of the Internet and is the most significant challenge for IoT and wearable devices. The hacking of fitness trackers, security cameras, baby monitors, and other abuses has drawn the attention and serious concerns of major tech firms and government agencies across the world. While security considerations are not new in the realm of information technology, the characteristics of many IoT and wearable technology deployments introduce new and unprecedented security challenges. Addressing these challenges and ensuring secure IoT and wearable products and services must be a top\n\n19\n\n20\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\npriority. As these technologies are becoming more pervasive and integrated into our daily lives, users need to be assured that these devices and associated data are secure from vulnerabilities such as cyber-attacks and data exposure. The more consequential shift in security will come from the fact that IoT and wearable technology will become more integrated into our daily activities. Concerns will no longer be limited to protecting our sensitive data and assets. Our own lives and health can become the target of malicious attacks. This challenge is further amplified by other considerations such as the mass-scale production of identical devices, the ability of some devices to be automatically paired with other devices, and the potential deployment of these devices in unsecure environments. 1.1.5.2 Privacy\n\nWhile many of the emerging IoT and wearable technologies are giving rise to a spectrum of new applications and innovative uses, as well as promising and attractive benefits, they also pose privacy concerns that are largely unexplored. In fact, a new research area concerning the security and privacy of these technologies has recently emerged. Additionally, the need for the majority of wearable devices and a good number of IoT systems to interact and share data with an access point (i.e. a smart watch to smartphone, medical monitoring device to a home server, smart bulb to an ambient home assistant) along with other sensors and peripherals would certainly create a new class of privacy and security hazards. Some IoT and wearable devices deploy various sensors to collect a wide spectrum of biological, environmental, behavioral, and social information from and for their users. Clearly, the more these devices are incorporated into our daily lives, the greater the amount of sensitive information will be transported, stored, and processed by these devices, which also elevate privacy concerns. Moreover, integrated voice recognition or monitoring features are continuously listening to conversations or video record activities and selectively transmit such potentially sensitive data to a cloud service for processing, which sometimes involves a third party. Handling and interacting with such information unveil legal and regulatory challenges facing data protection and privacy laws. One specific privacy concern associated with the emerging smart glasses is that they allow users to simultaneously record and share images and videos of people and their activities in their range of vision, in real time. This problem will soon be intensified when such devices are integrated with facial recognition programs which will allow users to see the person’s name in the field of view, personal information, and even visit their social media accounts.\n\n1.1 ­Introductio\n\n1.1.5.3 Standards and Regulations\n\nThe lack of standards and best practices documentations poses a major limitation to the potential of IoT and wearable devices. Without standards to guide manufacturers and developers, these products that often operate in a disruptive manner would lead to interoperability issues and might have negative impacts if poorly designed and configured. Such devices can have adverse consequences on the network resources they connect to and the broader Internet. Unfortunately, most of this comes down to cost constraints and the pressuring need to release a product to the market quicker than competitors. Moreover, there is a wide range of regulatory and legal questions surrounding the IoT and wearable technology, which require thoughtful consideration. Legal issues with IoT and wearable devices may include conflicts between governmental surveillance and civil rights; policies of data retention and destruction; legal liability/penalty for unintended uses; and security breaches or privacy abuses. Furthermore, technology is advancing much faster than the associated policy and regulatory environments which might render policies and regulations to be inappropriate. Big data presents another serious challenge. The analysis, extraction, manipulation, storage, and processing of substantial amounts of data may pose other legal problems as in profiling, behavior analysis, and monitoring. Big data may require new protection policies, international coordination, and infrastructure management, among others. Furthermore, the cloud and even the Internet itself are not tied to one specific geographic location. Moreover, the sheer amount of IoT and wearable devices originate from a number of different sources, including international partners and vendors, which makes it impossible for a localized regulatory authority to enforce quality control or standardized tests. As yet, these challenges have been minimally acted upon by policy makers. However, they reflect a pressing necessity to seek government solutions to both pronounce the strengths of these technologies and deploy policies to minimize their risks. 1.1.5.4 Energy and Power Issues\n\nThe increase in data rates and the number of Internet-enabled services and the exponential growth of IoT and wearable devices are leading to a substantial increase in network energy consumption. Moreover, the push toward smaller size and lower power is creating more signal and power integrity problems in IoT and wearable devices. Common issues include mutual coupling, distortion, excessive losses, impedance mismatch, and generator noise. Failure to deal with these issues can have detrimental effects on these devices.\n\n21\n\n22\n\n1 Introduction and Historical Background\n\n1.1.5.5 Connectivity\n\nAccording to recent research reports, around 22 billion IoT and wearable devices will be connected to the Internet by 2020. Thus, it is just a matter of time before users begin to experience substantial bottlenecks in IoT connectivity, proficiency, and overall performance. Currently, a big percentage of connected devices rely on centralized and server/ client platforms to authenticate, authorize, and connect additional nodes in a given network. This model is sufficient for now, but as additional billions of devices join the network, such platforms will turn into a bottleneck. Such systems will require improved cloud servers that can handle such large amounts of information traffic. This is already being addressed by the academic and industrial community which is pushing toward decentralized networks. With such networks, some of the tasks are moved to the edge, such as using fog computing, which takes charge of time-sensitive operations (this will be discussed in detail in chapter 7), whereas cloud servers take on data assembly and analytical responsibilities.\n\n1.2 ­Conclusion IoT and wearable devices are enabled by the latest developments in smart sensors, embedded systems, and communication technologies and protocols. The fundamental premise is to have sensors and actuators work autonomously without human involvement to deliver a new class of applications. The recent technological revolution gave rise to the first phase of the IoT and wearable devices, and in the next few years, these devices are expected to bridge diverse technologies to enable novel applications by connecting physical objects together in favor of intelligent decision making. Benefits are substantial, but so are the challenges. This will require businesses, governments, standards bodies, and academia to work together toward a common goal. In short, IoT and wearable technology are representative icons of the most recent industrial revolution. Given that we advance and evolve by transforming data into information, knowledge, then into wisdom, these technologies have the potential to change the world as we know it today, in new and exciting ways.\n\nProblems 1 What are the main differences between IoT and wearable technology? 2 What is it meant by “things” in Internet of Things? 3 What are the main differences between IoT and M2M?\n\nInterview Questions\n\n4 Can you think of other potential challenges found in IoT and wearable technology other than the ones mentioned in this chapter? 5 Give examples of wearable devices/applications that do not require Internet connectivity. 6 List five real-world examples of smart clothing. 7 List five real-world examples of the headwear form in wearable technology. 8 List four components common between IoT and wearable devices (an application of your choice). 9 Are wearable devices a form of M2M?

Not too long ago, such technology integrations were considered science fiction. This chapter covers the applications of IoT and wearables in various fields. It also provides an insight on the roles these applications could play in practice and discusses the challenges and key success factors for their adoption.\n\n2.2 ­IoT and Wearable Technology Enabled Applications 2.2.1 Health care IoT is indisputably transforming the healthcare sector by redefining the capacity of devices and people interactivity in delivering healthcare solutions. IoT has substantial applications in this sector that benefit patients, guardians, physicians, hospitals, and insurance firms. In 2018, data from clinical trials of 357 head and neck cancer patients were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting. The trials utilized a Bluetooth-based weight scale and blood pressure cuff, along with a smartphone app for symptom tracking which sends updates on symptoms and responses to treatment to their physicians every weekday. The patients who used this monitoring system experienced less illness and treatment side effects severity compared to the control group who maintained routine weekly physician visits with no additional monitoring at home. ASCO’s president, Bruce E. Johnson, said that this technology “helped simplify care for both patients and their care Fundamentals of IoT and Wearable Technology Design, First Edition. Haider Raad. © 2021 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. Published 2021 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.\n\n28\n\n2 Applications\n\nproviders by enabling emerging side effects to be identified and addressed quickly and efficiently to ease the burden of treatment.” Thanks to their partnership with General Electric (GE) Healthcare and IoTbased software, known as AutoBed, Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York City was able to effectively reduce the wait time by 50% for their emergency room patients. The system tracks occupancy among 1200 units and factors in 15 different metrics to assess the needs of individual patients. Apart from monitoring patients’ health, there are many other innovative uses where IoT devices are proven very useful in hospitals. IoT devices are used for tracking real-time locations of medical equipment such as wheelchairs, defibrillators, oxygen pumps, and other monitoring systems, in addition to asset management like pharmacy inventory control. Medical staff deployment at different locations can also be monitored and coordinated in real time. IoT-driven hygiene monitoring equipment is also used to help in preventing infections in patients. In the health insurance sector, IoT can play a vital role in the underwriting and claims operations. Data gathered by health monitoring devices will enable the insurance companies to detect fraud claims and could bring transparency between the companies and customers in the processes of underwriting, pricing, claim handling, and risk management. The first wearable hearing aid device was developed in 1938, which is considered as one of the early milestones in modern biomedical engineering. Nowadays, healthcare firms are realizing the potentials of wearable technology and IoT in treating some of the most common chronic diseases, such as, diabetes, congestive heart failure, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary ­disease (COPD), and pain management. For example, a California-based ­medical tech company has developed a biosensor that monitors the patient’s heart and respiratory rates and temperature, in addition to body posture. The device is also equipped with a fall detection capability and could be used in a home or a hospital setting. A wearable device developed by another healthcare firm is capable of continuously monitoring the glucose level in diabetic users. On the other hand, the FDA-approved Medtronic hybrid closed-loop system is capable of monitoring and adjusting glucose levels by automatically dispensing basal insulin, mimicking an actual function of a pancreas. Another device, developed by iRhythm technologies Inc., is capable of detecting abnormal heart activity. The device is based on water-proof electrocardiogram patches which continuously collect heart data for two weeks. The collected data are then forwarded to the company’s clinical app for processing and diagnosis. In the pain management area, Quell is an FDA-approved wearable device aimed at reducing pain. The device utilizes an accelerometer which computes and assesses the user’s activity level, and fires its pain reduction stimulation with a relevant intensities.\n\n2.2 ­IoT and Wearable Technology Enabled Application\n\nAnother device available in the market is a pulse oximeter1 which is developed for patients with asthma and COPD. The device can be used in either a hospital or home setting which allows remote and extended monitoring of the patient’s oxygen level and heart rate. There is also a wearable device that enables fetal monitoring for users with high body mass index (BMI). Another pregnancy device is designed to assist women in determining when they are ovulating and most fertile time for conception. The wearable device is inserted into the vagina where the biosensor monitors the basal body temperature. Telemedicine is broadly defined as providing medical and healthcare services through telecommunication technologies. The first use of telemedicine dates back to the telephone invention in 1876, with medical consultations conveyed over the phone. Clearly, the recent breakthroughs in wearable technology and IoT have delivered medical care to virtually all corners of the world. With telemedicine, patients can access medical services that may not be available locally. Thus, transportation and geographic barriers are minimized. Moreover, it is widely acknowledged that cultural and social barriers may also prevent patients from seeking necessary mental health services in many cultures. Recent research findings have confirmed that telemedicine is very effective in diminishing such barriers. This area of telemedicine is known as tele-psychiatry. Remote health care is now also available for pets. For example, the PetPace collar, an activity and wellness tracker designed for dogs and cats, can be linked to a network service where the pet’s health parameters such as heart and respiration rates, temperature, and activity levels can be accessed by veterinary clinics.\n\n2.2.2 Fitness and Well-being The demand for fitness trackers that come packed with different types of sensing and wireless capabilities is growing at a rapid rate. Fitbit, Apple, Samsung, Jawbone, and Garmin are just a few brand names in today’s market. These trackers measure fitness and well-being-related metrics such as the number of steps walked or climbed, heart rate, and sleep and stress patterns. Most trackers now also have the capability to determine the user’s location. A new trend started by many firms and organizations is the use of wearable devices to track the health and activity parameters of their employees as part of a well-being program. The aggregated data are then forwarded to their health insurance providers which, as an incentive, offer a reduced policy premium in return. According to one technology research and advisory firm, around 10 000 companies across the world offered the use of fitness trackers to their employees in 2014. 1 An oximeter is a noninvasive device for monitoring a user’s oxygen saturation levels.\n\n29\n\n30\n\n2 Applications\n\nIt is worth noting that several studies agree that placing fitness trackers on the user’s hip or foot rather than the wrist would result in more accurate readings. Even the most accurate fitness trackers in the market could overestimate step count in some scenarios and misinterpret exaggerated gestures as steps. This fact has motivated some wearable tech companies to design smart socks, bras, and undergarments. For example, one smart health tracking socks is capable of tracking the user’s personal health metrics and offering higher accuracy in measuring steps, velocity, altitude, and burnt calories through their unique foot-landing and weight distribution techniques. The device consists of a cuff-shaped fitness tracker which magnetically connects to the product’s running-friendly fabric. The product can also communicate with a smart phone app, keep logs of the user’s activities, and guide them via audio cues during an activity. Another wearable product in the area of well-being is a wristwatch that utilizes ultraviolet sensors to track the levels of sunlight exposure received by the body. The data are then visualized via LED lights that start to flicker when the user’s ultra violet exposure is within the dangerous level. Such device would be very practical in countries with high skin cancer rates (i.e., Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Denmark, and parts of USA) due to excessive exposure to ultraviolet energy. One of the main reasons IoT technology has had such an impact on the fitness industry is the visibility it offers. Regardless of the user’s exercise goals, their primary objective is to improve in some area and be able to quantify such improvements. Through continuous data collection, analysis, and visualization, IoT provides the users with unprecedented visibility to track personal growth. For example, IoT-driven smart home bikes and elliptical workout machines that feature streaming workouts, cycling classes, and other digitally connected features are on the rise. Such equipment offers flexibility for people with no time to go to a gym and the sense of participating in real classes. Such demand has also triggered software enterprises, such as Kaa, to develop IoT platforms that deliver production-ready capabilities into smart sport and fitness products. Such platforms allow manufacturers to automatically aggregate and analyze data from virtually any sensors, fitness trackers, and smart sports equipment, and then visualize it on equipment displays and/or mobile devices.\n\n2.2.3 Sports Today, IoT and wearable technology play a vital role in sports through athlete development and safety, and fan engagement and experience. Organizations are investing billions of dollars on smart stadiums where IoT is used to improve digital engagement and in-arena experience. Fans can have an immersive experience with their favorite teams and athletes like never before.\n\n2.2 ­IoT and Wearable Technology Enabled Application\n\nIn the area of player development, IoT is transforming the way coaches coordinate training, manage players, and address essential situations in every game. Integrating advanced game analytics with sensors, coaches can easily access vast amounts of processed data to obtain players’ efficiency and performance metrics, in addition to opponent shortcomings to develop a more educated in-game strategy. Moreover, embedded sensors and microchips offer sport physicians and therapists real-time health tracking which provides a holistic view of the athlete’s state, allowing them to make a more informed decision for the athlete’s longevity and health status. For example, Adidas is working with professional soccer teams in parts of the United States to monitor the heart rate and other metrics of players using its miCoach wearable technology. The aggregated data are analyzed by coaches to track the athletes’ performance and have the best decision on scheduling breaks to minimize the risk of injury. Other sensing devices are worn underneath the athletes’ garments and used to monitor other key parameters including velocity, orientation, acceleration, blood pressure, and heart rate, which then sent to the coach’s console. Another sports wearable device is designed for alpine sports with onboard processing power, sensory, and networking capabilities comparable to that of a smartphone. The wearable gear is intended for skiers and snowboarders to stay connected. It is capable of displaying the user’s speed and altitude, route maps, and social network profiles and locations of other skiers in the resort. It simply gives the user the power of a smartphone integrated into their field of vision, hands-free. There are other wearable products available for hobbyists which are capable of tracking heart rate, muscle tension, and breathing patterns, and alert the users via text or push notification. Other products include smart sport apparatus such as a baseball that can detect and display the speed, spin rate, and pitching trajectory when thrown.\n\n2.2.4 Entertainment and Gaming Technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and haptics2 are redefining the way we experience and make movies, music, and video games. For example, Oculus Rift, a virtual reality gadget, is being used to create immersive movies that are unparalleled to what we have experienced before.\n\n2 Haptics, also known as kinesthetic communication, is aimed at reconstructing the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user through motors and other actuators for the purpose of interacting with computer applications.\n\n31\n\n32\n\n2 Applications\n\nWearable devices with haptic feedback and gesture control are now used to make innovative forms of music. For instance, Imogen Heap, an English singer and composer, introduced smart gloves which utilize gestures and motions to create digital music. Some theme parks around the world started to employ wearable technology to enhance the entertainment experience of tourists. For example, Disney introduced a smart wristband to help tourists navigate their theme parks. The tourist information is linked to a database by the smart band which also serves as an admission ticket, hotel key, and credit card. Tourists are able to schedule their visits to each theme park and preorder food without the need to wait in the extremely long lines. Market research reports that the global market for the wearable interfaces of virtual reality is estimated to reach 1 billion US dollar by 2020. It is also expected that the use of wearables such as wristbands, earbuds, and eyewear will increase exponentially in gaming platforms as control devices for the virtual reality and biometric gaming market due to their potential to accurately track the gamer’s movements. According to one company that develops biometric technology for wearables, an exciting potential application in immersive gaming may include action games that require gamers to hold their breath while the character is under water. Another application would be for the user’s heart rate to directly affect their accuracy in a shooting-based game.\n\n2.2.5 Pets In 2017, American Humane organization reported that around 10 million cats and dogs are either stolen or lost in the United States every year. It is also estimated that about 60% of cats and 56% of dogs in the United States are either obese or overweight. Such statistics have driven innovators to find IoT and wearable solutions dedicated to pets. According to a recent market report, the global revenue of pet wearables market was $1.4 billion in 2018, and is expected to reach 2.36 billion US dollar by 2022. The growth in pet ownership and expenditure is expected to push product demand over the forecast period. Moreover, the increased awareness toward pet health is driving substantial investment for research and development of even more advanced wearable products for pets. One example of a pet wearable is an oncollar tracker that is able of collecting data of the pet’s physical activity through a smartphone app and keeping records of its behavior. Such behavioral data allow pet owners to determine whether the pet is potentially ill or has some condition; it also allows owners to track the location of their pets. While most IoT products emphasize on the health and security for pets, there are other areas in which IoT can be helpful for pet owners, such as pet toys and\n\n2.2 ­IoT and Wearable Technology Enabled Application\n\nfeeders. Feeders can help automate the precise portion that a pet should have while also dispensing food when the owner is away. Some apps even have the capability to remotely unlock and lock home doors to allow access for dog walkers and pet sitters.\n\n2.2.6 Military and Public Safety Internet of Battlefield Things (IoBT) or Internet of Military Things (IoMT) uses sensing, communication, and computing devices embedded within the soldiers’ combat suits, helmets, weapons, and other equipment to provide them with additional sensory perception, situational understanding, and a better response time. Wearable technology has become a fundamental component of the connected soldier system that offers a tactical edge, tracking, and improved safety. The research and development arena is dedicating greater efforts in this field to advance lightweight electronics and miniaturized antennas, and to produce more effective radio communication systems with an eye toward improving soldier mobility and system scalability. Such systems involve a variety of physiological sensors that monitor heart rate, breathing patterns, body temperature, and blast effects. The data would be available for real-time wireless transmission to headquarters or for immediate analysis. In addition to worn devices, the US Army Research Laboratory (ARL), academia, and industry are collaborating to investigate how other stationary and mobile devices’ connectivity and infrastructure can be utilized to improve military operations. ARL has been testing various protocols and technologies to bring devices and sensors together in a cohesive network. In addition to soldiers, ships, planes, tanks, drones, and weapons are all entities of such network. On the other hand, many law enforcement departments are already using wearable headsets which include a camera, an ear phone, and a microphone, used when on duty. For instance, London Metropolitan Police had deployed wearable systems aiming at regaining the public trust after the department’s involvement in controversial cases following the killing incidents that led to the London riots in 2011. In spite of the escalated privacy concerns, the plan seems to have exhibited success in documenting offense evidences which resulted in a sped up justice process. The author predicts that virtually every police officer in the United States will be equipped with a wearable system which could include a camera and recording unit by 2025. They will most likely be equipped with a wrist or eyewear for accessing information, hands-free. Recent studies report that wearable technology can be crucial in field communications and would enhance situational awareness in civil defense and public safety applications. This would promote multitasking and ultimately results in an\n\n33\n\n34\n\n2 Applications\n\nimproved decision making process. One example is represented by a wearable device developed by Vienna University of Technology which was designed to aggregate data captured by firefighters. The device is capable of mapping the firefighters’ surroundings on a given site by a color-coded representation. The temperature mapping is then used to identify the location of people through smoke and help in deciding whether specific rooms are safe to gain access to. This is accomplished by wearable cameras and sensors integrated within the firefighter’s helmet.\n\n2.2.7 Travel and Tourism The travel and tourism industry has not been shy about investing in IoT and wearable technology. The sector spent about $128.9 million on these technologies in 2015. IoT is now being used to streamline the end operations and maximize operational efficiency of hotels, airlines, and travel agencies by interconnecting smart devices, systems, and processes. For example, hotels and airlines can track supply chains more effectively through sensor-enabled cargos, which enables them to account for any contingencies and prevent service disruptions to travelers. Many studies report that wearable and mobile technologies are starting to play a vital role in many aspects of the travel and tourism field. For examples, several deployments of Google Glass in the airline business have been recently reported. Also, in 2014, Virgin Atlantic staff at Heathrow Airport has used the Google Glass to provide an enhanced customer service. The Glass enabled the airlines’ employees to offer weather information and language translations to their customers. The hospitality industry is another sector adopting wearable technology. For instance, Starwood Hotels developed a technology that enables their preferred guests to use virtual room keys instead of physical ones. It also offers directions to the hotel and allows access to their reservations and star point balances.\n\n2.2.8 Aerospace Until recent times, astronauts relied on printed instruction manuals in case of emergency or system error. Such issues force the crew to call the ground station for guidance. However, telecommunication becomes impractical the farther a spacecraft is away from earth. For example, it could take up to 25 minutes for a message to travel from Mars to Earth. To overcome such problems, the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration is developing smart glasses for astronauts that can guide them through a repair process or conducting an experiment in outer space, hands-free. IoT is revolutionizing the aerospace industry, both on the ground and in the air. Real-time analytics via IoT are already pushing improvements in quality and\n\n2.2 ­IoT and Wearable Technology Enabled Application\n\nmanufacturing efficiency in this sector. For example, IoT-enabled power meters can provide information on energy usage in aircraft production, which could lead to significant cost reductions and a more sustainable operation. According to Airbus, advanced analytics algorithms analyze the energy usage and suggest energy-saving measures which could result in 20% cost saving. IoT can also offer a more in-depth insight into how an entire assembly line is operating. In one aircraft factory, data from machines and conveyors are fed into a live visual hub to enable supervisors to track operations in real time, as well as implement highly accurate simulations to obtain the most optimized ways of improving operations.\n\n2.2.9 Education Many educators are starting to realize that the emerging digital technologies could offer an opportunity to enhance the learning experience instead of being a distraction. In fact, many studies are confirming the advantageous potential of using IoT and wearable technology as pedagogical tools. For more than three decades, Microsoft’s PowerPoint has served educators in almost every discipline as an indispensable illustrative tool. However, postmillennial generations will most likely enjoy a more immersive classroom and learning experience that go beyond a simple slideshow. In response to this, hundreds of classrooms across the world have already started to deploy wearable and IoT platforms to transform the learning experience of students. For example, Google Expeditions, an educational initiative introduced by Google, uses folded cardboard with a pair of specially designed lenses to turn a smartphone into a virtual reality headset. This gadget lets students have an immersive visual learning experience. The gadget serves as a great tool for active and hands-on learning where a user can virtually explore places such as the Great Wall of China, the Grand Canyon in the United States, or Rome in Italy. “The creativity we have seen from teachers, and the engagement from students, has been incredible.”, as reported by Google’s product manager for Expeditions. This is one example where technology in education, if used properly, can enhance the student’s creativity and learning experience without distractions. IoT could also help schools improve the safety of their campuses, keep tr"
