        "text": "The new Fuji X interchageable mirrorless X system has been leaked at Xitek. As you can see from the pictures it is the final prof that it will not have a m43 mount. Too bad, it really looks nice! it has almost the same [shoplink 19929]Fuji X100[/shoplink] design. This is probably a camera Olympus and Panasonic should have made long time ago. It also has the Optical/Electronic viewfinder switch!\n\nA curiosity: Can you guess the possible size of the sensor? Click on pictures to enlarge the images!\n\nUPDATE: There should be a 18mm/2.0 pancake, 35mm/1.4 and a 60mm lens. In APS-C terms this means that Fuji will offer a 27mm f/2.0, 52mm f/1.4 and 90mm lens.\n\nAnd here is a poll. I already know your answer but I know Olympus and Panasonic are reading us and do need a bit of pressure to get the message:\n\nShould Panasonic/Olympus do a camera like the FUji X you see here?\n\nYes of course!\n\nNo, don't care\n\nView Results\n\nLoading ...\n\nP.S.: Fuji X100 links: [shopcountry 19929].\n\nDisclaimer: 43Rumors has no affiliation with any of the equipment manufacturers mentioned on this site.
