        "text": "No dubious blurry-cams here. In fact, this leaked shot of the Olympus E-P1 is so pristine and tallies so well with both other leaks and actual prototypes that it's certainly the real deal. Coming in three colors (the leather patch is either orangey-brown, pinky-brown or black) and with a choice of at least two lenses and an accessory viewfinder, this is likely to be the modern Olympus \"Pen\" that will be officially unveiled tomorrow.\n\nHere we see both the previously-leaked 17mm ƒ2.8 prime lens and a new 14-42 (28-84 equivalent) ƒ3.5-5.6 zoom and a huge and bright looking optical 'finder. That finder alone has got us all hot, as compacts usually skimp on this part of the optics in favor of the LCD screen. Speaking of LCDs, this is the one part none of the leaks has shown us.\n\nLike we said, only one more day to wait for the official line. If Olympus has gotten this camera right, it could be huge. Lovely styling, a big sensor (Micro Four Thirds sensors are half the size of a 35mm frame) and what looks like a well laid-out set of controls. If the shutter response is good and low-light performance up to modern standards, it will be almost impossible to stop me buying one. Fingers crossed.\n\nNew Olympus [Xitek via Engadget]\n\nSee Also:"
