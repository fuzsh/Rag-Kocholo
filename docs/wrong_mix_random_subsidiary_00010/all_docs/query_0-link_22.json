So much for young men. For the rest of us, our concerns these days are slightly more prosaic. Take taxes, for example. Paying taxes is a national duty; not pay¬ ing them is a national pastime. Who among us, when confronted with — if not confounded by — a hieroglyphic of tax forms and schedules and a cornuco¬ pia of receipts, bank records, balky calcu¬ lators and broken No. 2 pencil stubs, has not wondered just how much one can get away with and still escape the wrath of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) auditors? There is some confusion among taxpay¬ ers about how the IRS decides which re¬ turns to audit. The IRS, for its part. would like to keep it that way. In fact, government attorneys at this very mo¬ ment are fighting a federal court deci¬ sion directing the IRS to turn over tax computer tapes to a pair of disgruntled taxpayers in Seattle who were audited — unfairly, they claim — back in 1969. According to the government, the tapes should not be released lest “persons (Continued on Page 6) THE NEWSWEEKLY FOR THE COMPUTER COMMUNITY Weekly Newspaper Second-class postage paid at Framingham, Mass., and additional mailing offices ‘1981 by CW Communications, Inc.

New Communications Act Rewrite Would Lift Restrictions on AT&T By Brad Schultz CW Staff WALTHAM, Mass. — In¬ formation systems managers should report to a top execu¬ tive charged with ensuring that flows of data through systems truly benefit the or¬ ganization, management ex¬ perts told a business ethics conference here recently. Application of information is a matter too important to be decided by technical ex¬ perts primarily interested in “squeezing the last nanosec¬ ond out pf their computers,\" observed Dr. Elizabeth Byrne Adams, a George Washing¬ ton University associate pro¬ fessor of management and the president of Manage¬ ment/Technology Interface, Inc. Other management experts joined Adams at Bentley Col¬ lege's Fourth National Busi¬ ness Ethics Conference in calling for the creation of a new kind of corporate ad¬ ministrator who, by regular¬ ly evaluating the organiza¬ tional impacts of DP, would determine the merit of im¬ plementation strategies and DP operational policies. Authority Challenged This information resources management (IRM) perspec¬ tive challenges the view that a DP or management infor¬ mation systems (MIS) execu¬ tive should be the organiza¬ tion's ultimate authority for storage, processing and movement of data.

The legislation emerged a few days before a federal dis¬ trict court in Newark, N.J., was scheduled to begin con¬ sidering whether the decree should be reinterpreted (see story on Page 4). AT&T has asked the court to rule that on-line computer-based ser¬ vices and other enhanced of¬ ferings can be marketed by the phone company through a separate subsidiary without To Protect Operators Niosh Issues CRT Use Guidelines By Ann Dooley CW Staff CINCINNATI — The Na¬ tional Institute for Occupa¬ tional Safety and Health (Niosh) has just completed its long-awaited series of rec¬ ommendations to protect CRT terminal operators in the work place. Unions that called for the measures say thev are fine — as far as they g° The proposed recommen¬ dations are based on a Niosh study conducted last year at several California sites at the request of union groups con¬ cerned about both radiation and ergonomic hazards to employees working on CRT terminals [CW, Feb. 25, 1980], The Newspaper Guild In¬ ternational and other unions which requested the initial study feel that the recom¬ mendations are satisfactory as far as they go, but feel that stronger action is warranted. Even as the Niosh study is being wrapped up, employ¬ ees at Blue Shield of Califor¬ nia — one of the sites stud¬ ied — are currently on strike over pay and computer safe¬ ty issues [CW, Feb. 16]. Niosh Claims Niosh, the federal watch¬ dog agency, has repeatedly claimed that there is no dan¬ ger to operators from any ra¬ diation hazards. This most recent study backs up its as¬ sertion.

State Dept. Says Reagan Giving Priority To International Communications Issues By Jake Kirchner GW Washington Bureau WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Rea¬ gan administration is giving high priority to international communica¬ tions and information issues, the State Department said recently. \"The problems and opportunities confronting us internationally in this field are crucial to our political, economic and defense interests,\" James L. Bucklev, undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and technology, told a House sub¬ committee hearing April 2. \"The Executive Office of the Presi¬ dent is now undertaking a compre¬ hensive study of the issues involved and the mechanisms appropriate to dealing with these issues,\" he said. Bucklev asserted the preeminence of the State Department in U.S. gov¬ ernment response to transborder data flow restrictions and other prob¬ lems arising in this international field and said proposed legislation to set up a central office for internation¬ al communications and information is unnecessary. Buckley said department activity has brought these problems under better management and resulted in \"far less complaints\" from the pri¬ vate sector that the government is not doing enough to fight unfair tar¬ iffs and information flow barriers. Skeptical Reception Buckley's statement, however, was skeptically received by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), whose Govern¬ ment Information and Individual Rights Subcommittee is considering his bill to establish a White House Council on International Communi¬ cations and Information to be the lead agency for these matters. \"I have difficulty with all these promises,\" English told Buckley, maintaining the issues are too impor¬ tant to wait until the administration comes to grips with them. \"1 think this thing's getting rather desperate,\" English said. \"We have some folks, some American business¬ es out there, who are getting hurt.\" Unless there is more positive action soon, English said, \"the message that [will be] conveyed around the world is the U.S. policy is to do nothing.\" Buckley assured the subcommittee that the State Department has the sit¬ uation under control, and he out¬ lined actions taken since the subcom¬ mittee first held hearings on international communications issues last spring. Buckley said his office or another high-level State Department office will soon assume the role of \"princi¬ pal officer\" in determining U.S. re¬ sponse to these issues, the exact of¬ fice to be determined after the administration's study is completed. \"Within the Department of State, as well as within the executive branch as a whole, we are moving to achieve more effective coordination,\" Buck- ley said. \"I am aware that proposals have been advanced from time to time calling for the centralization of responsibility within a bureau of the department.\" However, he said, \"given the very diversity of the geographic and sub¬ stantive issues involved in this field, establishment of a new bureau would not, in the final analysis, re¬ place the requirement for effective internal coordination.\" The department's staff, with the aid of structure interagency advisory groups and private sector input, will ensure the State official finally vest¬ ed with the responsibility in this area can effectively direct policy develop¬ ment. Group's Focus Addressing international commu¬ nications and information policy, Buckley said \"we do not intend that broad United States policy in this field should be only an accretion of separate policy decisions on specific issues. Nor can policy be successfully divorced from strategy. \"Therefore,\" he said, \"broad as well as specific policv questions should be addressed by the principal inter¬ agency group, and this group should consider developing an overall strat¬ egy to advance the interests of the United States in the international communications and information field.\" The approach Buckley advocated would, he said, encompass three ma¬ jor elements: • \"A clear statement, of United States interests and objectives. • \"The identification of courses of action to be pursued bilaterally and multilaterally, taking into account the obstacles that confront us in our relations with other countries and in the several international organiza¬ tions concerned. • \"The designation of specific agen¬ cies as having the responsibility for implementing the course of action.\" This Week IN DEPTH Local-Area Nets: Systems in Search of Standard . . 47 NEWS Bell Attempt to Lift Consent Decree to Hit Court .... 4 Hanover Fair Makes NCC Look Lilliputian . 5 Urbis: Computers Letting Politicians Snow Public. . . 6 Formulate Privacy Policy Now, Lawyer Warns . 7 Horton: IRM Could Get Monkey Off MIS Back . 8 Device Lets Users Stimulate Bell Satellite Links . 9 IBM 3380 Delay Fueling Demand for 3350s . 10 Illinois Court Strikes Down Software Tax Policy. ... 1 1 Telpak Rates Predicted to Jump 30% to 50% . 12 Communications to Rule Business Structures . 13 UK Consultant Advises U.S. on Info Policy . 14 Industry Gears Up for Switch to Nine-Digit Zip . 15 Boston Council Stymied in Mayor White Probe .... 16 Pressure on IBM Seen Necessary for X.25 Link .... 17 CA DDP System Doubles Syfa 2000 Memory . 18 Rep.

THE FACTS: Back in 1971, SyncSort had no users, except for a handful of beta-test sites. Today, according to the 1980 independent sort survey conducted by the International Data Corporation, SyncSort is the most widely used sort program in America on large IBM computers. Just how rapid and pervasive this growth has been can be seen in the following illustration: Today, 69% use SyncSort ! Call (201) 568-9700.

Virtually every advance in sorting has appeared first in a long line of SyncSort releases. As a result a “sort gap” has been created. IBM sorts can no longer compete successfully with SyncSort in any of the following critical areas: 1. PERFORMANCE. In terms of resource usage, sorting has become one of the advanced areas of data processing. Compared to IBM sorts, SyncSort will save you an average of 20 % in CPU Time, 25% in EXCPs, and 30% in Elapsed Time. 2. PRODUCTIVITY. One of the prime reasons for SyncSort’s rapid growth is its popularity with programmers and managers. We’ve built in a host of labor-saving features - INCLUDE/OMIT, SUM, INREC/OUTREC and sophisticated copying facilities - to reduce coding, compiling and debugging. In typical selection-report applications or modifications, a job that would take five days using a programming language can be accomplished by SyncSort in one day. 3. CUSTOMER SERVICE. It's always been good, but now we’ve reduced it to a science. A sophisticated TSR (Technical Service Report) System permits us to follow up service requests quickly and accurately. As a result, 85% of all requests for sorting assistance or advice are resolved within 24 hours. InC. 560 Sylvan Ave., Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 07632 Page 4 ES3 COMPUTERWORLD April 13, 1981 Justice , 11 Others in Opposition Bell Attempt to Lift Consent Decree to Hit Court Bv Phil Hirsch ON Washington Bureau MEW ARK. N.J. — Whether AT&T should be allowed to offer enhanced services and terminal equipment on a deregulated basis through separate subsidiaries — a battle that has raged for years at the Federal Communica¬ tions Commission (FCC) and in Con¬ gress — is scheduled to be consid¬ ered here beginning this week in U.S. District Court. Under the Consent Decree AT&T signed in 195b, the phone company is limited, generally, to providing regulated communication services and facilities. The FCC, however, in its Second Computer Inquiry Deci¬ sion issued last December, concluded that the phone company could mar¬ ket computer-based on-line informa¬ tion services, smart terminals and other \"enhanced\" offerings through separate subsidiaries on a deregulat¬ ed basis without violating the 1956 Consent Decree. According to the commission, this is because such of¬ ferings are \"incidental to\" communi¬ cations and, even though deregulat¬ ed, will remain \"subject to\" regulatory oversight. Early last month, AT&T asked the U.S. District Court here — which has jurisdiction over the 1956 Consent Decree — to agree with the commis¬ sion's reasoning. Eleven companies and trade associations — including several from the computer industry — filed opposing petitions shortly afterward, and early this month the Department of justice entered the battle. Basically, the government and the industry groups agree that the Con¬ sent Decree \"enjoins [AT&T] from engaging in any business other than common carrier communication ser¬ vices, the charges for which are regu¬ lated bv tariff,\" as the justice Depart¬ ment's petition put it. Mortal Blow The case is significant because if AT&T prevails, it will win a legally sanctioned right to enter the bur¬ geoning on-line information busi¬ ness, and to offer computer-based terminals plus intelligent network services. Efforts of the computer in¬ dustry to prevent this invasion — at the FCC and in Congress — would probably suffer a mortal blow, and the justice Department's chances of \"breaking up the Bell System\" — the major goal of its pending antitrust suit — would decline considerably. Consideration of AT&T's petition, and the objections, is scheduled to begin here this week before U.S. Dis¬ trict Court Judge Vincent P. Biuno. A key question is whether the court will allow the industry groups to be¬ come parties to the proceeding; that would allow them to introduce evi¬ dence, question AT&T witnesses, de¬ mand relevant phone company doc¬ HP 3000 HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE • HP HARDWARE AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE installed and fully supported by Hewlett-Packard • SUCCESS-PROVEN APPLICATION PACKAGES installed and fully supported by their developers.

Both AT&T and the Justice Depart¬ ment oppose these petitions for \"par¬ ty\" standing, and the previous histo¬ ry of similar efforts suggests that the petitions will be turned down. An¬ ticipating that result, several of the petitioners have asked to participate as \"friends of the court,\" which would limit their role considerably. This argument over \"standing\" is really a debate over the extent to which the court should immerse it¬ self in the Computer Inquiry Deci¬ sion. According to AT&T, the only is¬ sue before the court is whether the growth of competition since 1956 has obsoleted the restrictions imposed by the Consent Decree. The opposite view is that the court must consider whether the FCC deci¬ sion provides adequate protection against abuse of AT&T's monopoly in today's market environment. As the Association for Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. put it: \"The separate subsidiary prescribed by the commission .... is not an ade¬ quate safeguard 4, Senate Rewrite Bill Aims To Lift AT&T Restrictions (Continued from Page 1) water Sr., New Mexico's Harrison Schmitt and Alaska's Ted Stevens. Democrats were \"consulted,\" accord¬ ing to a committee spokesman, but have a number of reservations about the provisions. In a statement accompanying his introduction of the Telecommunica¬ tions Competition and Deregulation Act of 1981, Packwood referred to the New Jersey court proceedings as one reason \"we believe it is impor¬ tant to proceed with comprehensive domestic telecommunications legis¬ lation.\" Packwood also said, \"It has been our view that Congress, not the courts or the Federal Communica¬ tions Commission, should establish national telecommunications policy . . . This bill represents our best judgment on the appropriate role for competition and deregulation.\" Hearings on the new bill are likely toward the end of next month, the committee spokesman said. He ex¬ pects them to last \"three or four days.\" Divestiture of AT&T has been a ma¬ jor goal of the Computer & Commu¬ nications Industry Association, as well as other computer industry companies and groups participating in earlier stages of the great telecom¬ munications debate on Capitol Hill. Bill's Major Provisions WASHINGTON, D.C. - Here the FCC and could not be dis- are the major provisions of the Telecommunications Competi¬ tion and Deregulation Act of 1981, introduced into the Senate last week: • Long-distance and local tele¬ phone service would remain reg¬ ulated; all other communication services, unless they involve fa¬ cilities for which there is no rea¬ sonably available alternative, would be deregulated pursuant to a transition period. • Manufacturing and research and development activities relat¬ ed to deregulated products and services would be required to be fully separated from Bell Labora¬ tories and Western Electric in stages, and the process would have to be completed eight years after the bill is enacted. “\"Behav¬ ioral requirements\" would be im¬ posed during this period to mini¬ mize potential anticompetitive behavior by Bell Labs and West¬ ern Electric. Also, any transfer of assets from AT&T to a deregulat¬ ed subsidiary would be evaluated by a three-member board — one member chosen by the phone company, one by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the third by both. • Interface specifications and other technical information needed by competitors to inter¬ connect with the regulated net¬ work would have to be filed with closed by AT&T to its deregulat¬ ed subsidiary beforehand. Be¬ sides interface space, this provision would also apply to the phone company's plans for in¬ stalling additional circuits. • FCC proceedings would be greatly simplified. Under certain circumstances, a carrier could put a new service into effect without waiting for FCC approval of the. tariff provided the revenues were separately accounted for until the commission acted. New trans¬ mission facilities could also be built without prior commission approval. • AT&T would be prohibited from offering \"mass media\" ser¬ vices, but could market electronic Yellow Pages provided it did so through a subsidiary that did not offer transmission or any other service. \"Mass media\" services are comprised of radio, TV and \"printed or electronic publica¬ tions.\" The bill is unclear, how¬ ever, about whether the phone company would be free to offer an electronic Yellow Pages ser¬ vice that allows the customer to place an order and/or pay for it on-line. • Presently regulated transmis¬ sion services and terminal equip¬ ment offerings would remain regulated for two years. This pe¬ riod could be extended two more years by the FCC. April 13, 1981 IE! COMPUTERWORLD Page 5 Hanover Fair Makes NCC Look Lilliputian By Ann Dooley CW Staff HANOVER, West Germany — If you like the National Computer Conference, you'll love the Hanover Fair. What NCC provides for American computer aficiona¬ dos — the noise, crowds and vast display of exhibits and equipment — is magnified several times over in the Hanover Fair, billed as the largest trade show in the world, offering not only automated technology of all kinds, but also exhibits from eight other industries. Hands-On Exhibit Selling is what the Hanover Fair is all about — so much so that at end of the eight- day fair when the completed sales and orders are tallied, German government offi¬ cials contend they will be able to predict the state of the economy through 1981. Few new products were. in¬ troduced at the show, how¬ ever. One industry notable maintained that the scarcity of new products indicated that vendors intended to pre¬ sent established products with which fair attendees were familiar in order to in¬ crease immediate sales deci¬ sions. Moreover, many ven¬ dors — in particular the U.S. firms — may have been holding off for the upcoming NCC, because the U.S. is still the biggest market. As many as 600,000 visitors attended this year's fair, which ended last Wednes¬ day. Of the total visitors, nearly one-third attended Cebit, the computer supplies and office equipment exhibit areas. The fair was a tribute to German organization. The exhibits were spread throughout 24 halls covering approximately 250 acres and were tended by a permanent staff of 500 employees. To assist visitors, 66 termi¬ nals were set up at electronic visitor information centers. A visitor could receive a printout listing all the exhib¬ itors in selected categories. The data included hall and booth location as well as the address and ’phone number of specific firms, their top ex¬ ecutives and products and services. The information retrieval was instantaneous, and the lines waiting to reach the centers were proof of their popularity. This year, more than 1,100 vendors — mostly represent¬ ing small and medium-sized companies — from 28 coun¬ tries exhibited equipment at Cebit. U.S. vendors appeared in force, usually represented bv their German sales divi¬ sions. Among the U.S. vendors at the fair were Control Data Corp., Xerox Corp., Sperry Univac, McDonnell Douglas Automation Co., Hewlett- Packard Co. and, of course, IBM. Even microcomputer vendors like Radio Shack, Apple Computer, Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp., as well as a large number of word processing vendors, were on hand. In addition to the Cebit ex¬ hibition, the fair included exhibits in electrical engi¬ neering and electronics, power machinery, plant en¬ gineering, factory equip¬ ment, transportation vehi¬ cles, construction, subcon¬ tracting and research and technology. Throughout the exhibit floors, German, English, French and a variety of other languages could be heard as visitors made and closed sales deals. In keeping with this multilingual environ¬ ment, few if any learning seminars were held. The city of Hanover itself geared up for the annual fair. Because of a distinct shortage of hotel space, the citizens opened their homes to visi¬ tors allowing a glimpse of German home life. Some of those preferring hotels traveled as far as 100 miles each day just to get to the fair. Signs announcing and directing visitors to t!,e fair (\"Messe\") were every¬ where, and extra buses and streetcars were provided for the large crowds that thronged to the fair daily. Officials of the fair, which has been in existence since 1947, believe its success lies in part in its multibranch concept. Fair officials main¬ tain that most professional visitors are interested in more than three industry cat¬ egories. CW Photos by A.

Knowing this, pol¬ iticians have used \"unfathomable\" s 'cial analyses cranked out by com- I ters as the pretext for government policies, researchers have concluded here. Finding computerized analyses more credible than arguments logged manually in a report, the public has often passively accepted local government policies, according to the Urban Information Systems (Urbis) Research Group of the Uni¬ versity of California at Irvine's Pub¬ lic Policy Research Organization (PPRO). But the manual reports many peo¬ ple find less credible sometimes re¬ fute the claims of politicians, whose erudite computer analyses may ob¬ scure ulterior motives for policies more beneficial to them than the public, Urbis indicated in a forth¬ coming book.

As the rank and file see it, comput¬ ers issue \"hard facts\" that are unde¬ niable while manual reports feature mere \"opinions\" that are challengea¬ ble, PPRO's multidisciplinary re¬ search group explained. diagrams and formalisms, may credi¬ bly convex such messages as: • \"The government is concerned.\" • \"Calm down, something is being done.\" • \"The government makes rational policy decisions.\" • \"This particular policy decision is This is the third article in a sev¬ en-part series on how computing affects local government.

They as¬ sume that policy will be more ratio¬ nal if the data used to justify policy is accumulated in greater volumes, moved more rapidly, made easier to access and subjected to more exten¬ sive \"massaging,\" Urbis said. All this may be done by MIS, Urbis agreed, but in practice, whatever benefits computing has given the na¬ tion's cities and counties have pri¬ marily come from automation of the most routine information processing functions, leading to raised efficien¬ cy and cost-effectiveness of opera¬ tions. Thus, computing has allowed local government operations to run smoother and do more with their budgets in many cases, without mak¬ ing those operations more beneficial to the public that pays for them. \"The mere availability of a richer in¬ formation environment,\" Urbis pointed out, \"does not ensure that the data will be used 'rationally' or even that the data will be used at all.\" Nevertheless, computing has al¬ lowed many politicians to either con¬ vince the public that government agencies have improved social condi¬ tions, or that conditions could not be made better than they are.

Rites of Spring: Love, Baseball — Taxes Manipulated Data A coauthor of the second book based on the Urbis investigation of DP at 42 U.S. local governments re¬ portedly found a \"large Western county\" where the \"most powerful politician\" repeatedly ordered policy analysts to \"readjust the parameters in their estimates for county popula¬ tion growth\" until the computer model agreed with figures the politi¬ cian wished the public to believe. Local government management in¬ formation systems (MIS) send \"mes¬ sages\" to the public that allay suspi¬ cions about what politicians do in office, Urbis emphasized. When a policy issue becomes hot, politicians can present a computer-based report that, while incomprehensible to most citizens, manipulates their faith in the intrinsic good of technology and rationalism. Such reports, replete with arcane (Continued from Page 1) knowledgeable in statistical proce¬ dures and methods use the informa¬ tion to reduce the likelihood that their returns would be audited by shifting income or deductions to dif¬ ferent categories.\" This is explosive information, in¬ deed, and the IRS is understandably reluctant to share it. It is also reticent about discussing what formulas its computers use to tag returns for pos¬ sible examination. Leroy James, chief of the manage¬ ment staff of the IRS National Com¬ puter Center, Martinsburg, W. Va., said IRS officials \"keep those formu¬ las so secretive that I don't even know if anybody up here even knows what they are.\" Although the formulas are closely guarded, James did provide the fol¬ lowing explanation of how the audit¬ ing procedure works: All returns are initially processed by 10 regional IRS service centers and forwarded on magnetic tape to the national center for entry against the master tax files. The Martinsburg facility updates the files using some $27 million worth of IBM and IBM- compatible computer systems. \"Selected items\" on the returns — James would not say which items — are weighted according to national averages. The averages are deter¬ mined by special studies of carefully audited returns from past years \"to identify which factors on the return are the ones which have indicated the most potential for change if it is audited.\" All returns are ranked in numeric order according to those averages. Those with the highest scores are generally the first chosen for audit. But all the national center does is hold the ranking information; the ac¬ tual audit decisions are made by the IRS's 49 district offices, which per¬ form the audits. Depending on its work load, each district office periodically .requests a certain number of files to check for audit possibilities. James pointed out the offices can also request records on a random basis, so there is no sure-fire way to tailor a return to evade the threat of an audit. Also, taxpayers should not be de¬ luded into thinking the IRS takes tax return information on faith. Every item is run through the system and matched against employer-supplied data and other information, such as interest income reported by banks. In 1980 the IRS received slightly more than 93 million tax returns from individuals. Of those, James said, almost 2.2 million were selected for examination and most of that group resulted in in-person audits conducted at taxpayers' residences or places of work. Or course, not all audits result in in¬ creased tax Liability for the taxpayer, but they probably should not be con¬ sidered a pleasant way to spend an afternoon. Because the American tax system is an honor system — the taxpayer is expected to supply accurate and hon¬ est information — the audit threat is one of the few clubs the government can hold over the taxpayers' heads. Hefty fines and lengthy jail terms are others, but why dwell on them? Also, the IRS is in the planning stages of a $218 million, eight-year program- to upgrade operational ca¬ pabilities at the 10 regional offices and the national computer center. Agency officials protest they do not want the IRS to take on the guise of \"Big Brother\"; but then again, they are sticklers for efficiency. This is not to suggest, however, that if one wants to cheat on one's taxes now is the time to do it — before the big upgrade. But those of the feloni¬ ous bent are not likely to heed any warning here. The IRS, for its part, is pretty smug about the whole thing. April 15 — just two days off, if you're not paying attention — does not mean much to the IRS because the IRS never sleeps. Somewhere, 24 hours a day, every day of the vear, some agency person¬ nel are hard at work checking your tax returns. In the long run, the subject of taxes is probable not worth ruining a per¬ fectly good spring day. After all, amid the toil and tumult of the annu¬ al taxpaying marathon, there is still love to capture the fancy. And for those not so inclined, there is always baseball.

An effective information policy re¬ quires a solid \"concept of what per¬ sonal privacy really is,\" the John Marshall Law School professor said. Without such a doctrinal foundation, the task of framing an information policy and of deciding how much protection is enough becomes diffi¬ cult if not impossible to achieve. No provisions for safeguarding per¬ sonal privacy are ever explicitly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, and people from different industry vantage points often have strikingly different ideas about what form and content a sound information policy should take. So, ideally, the initiative for imposing some much-needed or¬ der in the U.S.' current information- policy chaos should come from the people who probably understand data privacy issues better than any¬ one else — the computing profes¬ sionals themselves, Trubow said. Trubow urged U.S. computing tech- Computers Tied To Boondoggles (Continued from Page 6) if, by implementing computer sys¬ tems, government has acted rational¬ ly? An alternative approach would necessarily be irrational according to the perspective on technology Urbis found dominant among local gov¬ ernment managers. In examining the role computing professionals play as the nation's lo¬ cal governments extend levels of automation, Urbis found the techni¬ cal experts far more interested in providing effective technical support for regnant policies than in what the policies were or how that was im¬ pacting society. While computing professionals in local government agencies are rela¬ tively apolitical, others in the agen¬ cies who have some technical exper¬ tise manipulate the former to serve various \"political agendas,\" Urbis charged. These politicized profes¬ sionals — typically analysts and planners — form an \"information elite\" with a vested interest in mak¬ ing computing and analysis as so¬ phisticated as possible, the PPRO team suggested. The Urbis survey of local govern¬ ments found DPers critical to the for¬ mulation and promulgation of poli¬ cy, but not heavily involved or even interested in defining what that poli¬ cy might be. nologists to become \"personal-priva¬ cy advocates\" because \"if you don't, no one else will.\" Actually, the formulation of a co¬ herent national privacy and informa¬ tion policy is in the computing field's own best interests, Trubow ex¬ plained. DP managers who stand on the sidelines of the personal-privacy debate today could someday find themselves shackled with informa¬ tion systems and policies that seri¬ ously endanger the confidentiality of their own companies' data bases. Protection of personal privacy de¬ pends to a large extent on govern¬ ment, Trubow said, because \"al¬ though many people are concerned about maintaining the integrity of information flow, data security has no formal constituency.\" Government appears to be a more likely source of support for privacy protection than private industry, which in the absence of some exter¬ nal motivation has historically shown more concern for its own data-security interests than for the needs of the ' larger population. \"Without impetus from govern¬ ment,\" Trubow said, \"privacy protec¬ tion simply doesn't get done.\" In other remarks, Trubow turned his attention to the subject of com¬ puter crime, which he described as \"much more of a problem than most people realize,\" and which he fore¬ sees as becoming even more of a headache in the future. \"Computers are greatly expanding the opportunities for illegal activity and are creating tests of personal strength and integrity that have nev¬ er existed before,\" Trubow said. The powerful and growing tempta¬ tion to use computers for illegal pur¬ poses has caught the U.S.' criminal justice system \"completely unpre¬ pared\" and is forcing police and prosecutors to \"try to make a modern technological concept fit into com¬ mon laws that have been on the stat¬ ute books for 300 to 400 years,\" Tru¬ bow said.

Page 8 II3 COMPUTERWORLD April 13, 1981 Horton: IRM Could Get Monkey Off MIS Back By Brad Schultz CW Staff WALTHAM, Mass. — Information resources management (IRM) would “take a monkey off the backs of DP managers” bv placing over them a new kind of executive, according to one of the top experts on federal gov¬ ernment DP. Dr. Forest “Woody\" Horton Jr., who directed the Federal Paperwork Commission's Information Manage¬ ment Study, told a recent business ethics conference at Bentley College here that IRM “was a long time in coming,\" but is necessary for com¬ puting to consistently benefit large organizations. Horton has directed management information systems (MIS) in the Ex¬ ecutive Office of the President, the Office of Management and Budget, the Environmental Protection Agen¬ cy and the Department of State. He worked with Werner von Braun's computer group in the late 1950s, was the first operations research ana¬ lyst hired bv the General Services Administration and later supervised transfer of computer systems to South Vietnam during the war there. With all that experience, Horton has concluded that \"the federal gov¬ ernment does not consider informa¬ tion a valuable resource.\" The Paper¬ work Reduction Act, drafted to implement some 600 recommenda¬ tions from the study Horton direct¬ ed, has just taken effect, he told the Bentley conference, and may result in sweeping changes to the storage and handling of information by fed¬ eral systems professionals. The information resources manager — a new kind of high echelon ad¬ ministrator — ■ would play a \"devil's advocate\" role on MIS operations, Horton remarked. This person would weigh systems procurement proposals from the organization's MIS staff in terms of impact on quali¬ ty of information available to policy¬ makers. IRM is a \"macro approach\" to man¬ aging a vital asset, Horton empha¬ sized. It works best with large orga¬ nizations, having sizable capital equipment investments, and aids pursuit of organizationwide objec¬ tives. Under IRM, the MIS manager would optimize systems efficiency, while the information resources manager over him would optimize effectiveness of data. In the federal government, infor¬ mation resource managers would en- Should MIS Manager Report to IRM Exec?

Regarding the ethics of computing, the latter executive, who need not have extensive technical expertise, would be better disposed than the DP/MIS manager to answer ques¬ tions about responsibility for what computing eventually does to the or¬ ganization and the world the organi zation impacts. A survey has found local government systems profes¬ sionals little concerned about the propriety of decision making their systems support (see articles on Pages 8). Adams said the information re¬ sources manager belongs at corpo¬ rate headquarters, regardless of how decentralized the organization's DP operations become. The core assump¬ tion of IRM advocates is that infor¬ mation should be treated as a critical resource with its own administrative problems. Companies should have someone signing off on how information is used, just as they generally have someone signing off on use of ener¬ gy resources (the plant manager) or money (the financial controller), Ad¬ ams told the conference. A plan for applying information re¬ sources should be drafted to fit the organization's long-term objectives, she said. The information resources manager should provide other managers with \"meta-data,\" Adams continued. This is data about data that suggests what fallacies might arise from reckless ex¬ trapolations and inferences made without questioning the informa¬ tion's timeliness and relevance. Training for aspiring information resources managers might be provid¬ ed by business and management schools, Adams indicated, rather than through the technical curricula of academic programs in DP, com¬ puter science and engineering. sure availability of \"good, sound, re¬ liable, timely information in order to implement [government] programs,\" he said. Since 1942, when the Federal Report Act ordered federal agencies to report on the nature of their data collection activities, there have gen¬ erally been 5,000 to 10,000 informa¬ tion flows among the agencies. As computer technology is applied to these flows and integrated with the technologies of telecommunica¬ tions and office automation, the fed¬ eral government needs a high rank¬ ing information resources official, Horton maintained. From a position in the G5A, this top federal manager of information re¬ sources would keep agency MIS staffs from \"getting a bum rap\" when the data provided by their sys¬ tems fails to serve the public interest, Horton asserted. The official should obtain pertinent advice from the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Informa¬ tion Agency, which Horton claimed has concentrated too heavily on tele¬ communications regulation .issues and neglected important concerns of IRM. \"The IRM manager will have to be groomed and grown,\" he observed, explaining that no academic disci¬ pline is presently sufficient to train people for that role. Niosh Issues CRT Use Recommendations (Continued from Page 1) routine surveys of CRTs are unwar¬ ranted. Niosh did, however, propose a number of recommendations affect¬ ing the health of employees based on ergonomic considerations. The most controversial recomendation — and the one probably least acceptable to employers — deals with work rest breaks. Based on the potential chronic ef¬ fects on vision, muscles and \"pro¬ longed psychological distress,\" Niosh recommended that a 15-min- ute work rest break should be taken after two hours of continuous CRT work for operators under moderate visual demands and/or moderate ° o<° ^cpT;,.T .vD ,\\v> Vy>%> «yvv\", work load. In a stronger move, Niosh suggest¬ ed a 15-minute work break after one hour for operators working continu¬ ously at their CRT terminals under high visual demand, high work load and/or repetitive work tasks. Although these work break sched¬ ules were designed to minimize the visual and muscular problems of CRT terminal operators, many em- plovers will undoubtedly argue their merit compared to the disruption which they claim will be caused by the continued work breaks. Since Niosh has no regulatory powers, the recommendations are strictly volun¬ tary on the part of employers, al¬ though the issue will undoubtedly continue to be a sore point among union groups and will probably be included in their bargaining posi¬ tions. Physical Ills Niosh based its work rest breaks on accumulated data which indicates that data entry CRT terminal opera¬ tors exhibit more muscular and visu¬ al complaints than other employees. The vision of CRT terminal operators has also been showm to undergo \"mi¬ nor\" and \"transient\" changes which could indicate \"the potential for chronic effects given long-term CRT use.\" The visual fatigue and/or eyestrain complaints usually include heavy, burning, itching, tearing eyes or eye soreness. While the reasons are diffi¬ cult to pinpoint, according to Niosh, they do indicate that the vision sys¬ tem is being affected. Further re¬ search is needed, but a potential problem may exist, according -to Niosh, and, \"given the repeated use of the CRT over manv vears, mav produce a cumulative trauma.\" As a further recommendation, Niosh also suggested that operators receive a comprehensive preplace¬ ment vision examination, which should be repeated periodically. Office Design In relation to office design features, Niosh noted that careful consider¬ ation should be given to task de¬ mands and workstations and that maximum flexibility for each indi¬ vidual operator should be the key. The recommendations include: • Workstations: Flexibility in key¬ board and screen height, screen brightness and contrast, leg room and viewing distance. Chair adjust¬ ment to accommodate back-rest height and tension to provide ade¬ quate support at the operator's op¬ tion. • Viewing Distance: Detachable keyboards and furniture should be used, maintaining a viewing distance between 450mm and 500mm de¬ pending on operator needs. The viewing angle should be in the range of 10 to 20 degrees, Nash said, and the top edge of the screen should be no higher than operator eye level and the bottom edge of the screen no lower than 40 degrees below eye lev¬ el. • Illumination: Lighting levels should be between 500 and 700 lux, which is reportedly lower than found in most offices. • Glare Control: Direct and reflect¬ ed glare should be limited through drapes or blinds over windows, posi¬ tioning of CRTs in relation to win¬ dows and overhead lighting, instal¬ lation of screen hoods, antiglare filters, and recessed or indirect light¬ ing. April 13, 1981 COMPUTERWORLD Page 9 To Combat Time Delay , Echo Device Lets Users Simulate Bell Satellite Links By Brad Schultz CVV Staff GAITHERSBURG, Md. — Data communications users can simulate performance problems caused by Bell's cutover to satellite links with equipment sold here by an indepen¬ dent vendor. The largest common carrier has told customers to expect time delay and echo problems in links with certain popular modems as it starts piping domestic Message Telecommunica¬ tions and Wide Area Telecommuni¬ cations Services (Wats) off the planet. According to \"Dear Customer\" let¬ ters issued over the past year, these problems may afflict sites with Bell 201 and 202 or equivalent modems as well as Bell 208B or equivalent mo¬ dems lacking attached echo control, devices [CW, March 23]. Telecommunications Techniques Corp. (TTC) offers users in this plight devices that can show what problems to expect, given present fa¬ cilities and software. As users at¬ tempt retooling installations to avert the problems, they can use the Dyna- tech Data Systems, Inc. subsidiary's products to see where they stand, since the simulation can apply time delays and echos from the user's pre¬ mises, rather than outer space. Reverse Channel Modems endowed with a reverse channel feature — Bell 202s and equivalents, for example — may pass delayed echos to the user's terminals as legitimate data, one Bell spokes¬ man warned in a \"Dear Customer\" letter issued last August. Reverse channels free a small portion of com¬ munications links for transmission of acknowledgment signals. These sig¬ nals, assuring senders that data ar¬ rived in valid condition, flow oppo¬ site to the direction of the data in half-duplex lines. \"When used with data communica¬ tions systems which are designed to abort on a failure at first attempt,\" the letter from a Bell staff manager read, \"it is recommended that you modify your system to make multi¬ ple attempts within an established connection (call) to avoid difficulty with 'first transmission' echo.\" The letter maintained that Bell 201C-L modems with \"an installed satellite option\" should not have this prob¬ lem. The cutover to satellite links should not disturb full-duplex modems, the staff manager added. TTC's TCS-600B voiceband’satellite simulator allows users to see for themselves what the cutover will do to present or anticipated configura¬ tions. It handles voice and voiceband data at up to 9,600 bit /sec and costs about $10,000, a spokesman said. TTC also offers its Model 1010B dig¬ ital delay simulator and 1020B digital bit error generator for data rates be¬ tween 2.4K- and 6.312M bit/sec. As with the TCS-600B, users would sim¬ ply plug modems and other gear into the appropriate TTC unit, switch it on and face the music. Operators need no technical proficiency, the spokesman asserted. Integrated as a single product, the 1010B and 1020B costs between $25,000 and about $32,000, depending on needs of a particular user. AT&T has warned customers to ex¬ pect time delays as long as 750 msec in long-haul data traffic. This reflects the inescapable fact that data takes a significant while to travel, at the speed of light, 23,000 miles from an earth station to a communications satellite in geosynchronous orbit and then rebound another 23,000 miles to a receiver earth station. SPCDU Devices Communications experts have un¬ derstood this aspect of extraterrestri¬ al microwave broadcasting for de¬ cades, but few vendors offer so-called satellite propagation com¬ pensation delay units (SPCDU) that keep the phenomenon from being a problem for data communications systems. Problems arise, in the absence of SPCDU, as acknowledgment signals proceed through reverse channels, the TTC spokesman pointed out. The space-going signals take so long to reach their destination that systems can confuse them with actual data; incoming acknowledgements can wind up mixed with outgoing data, padding transmission loads and therefore reducing throughput. According to the ominous \"Dear Customer\" letters, users must com¬ plete necessary alterations to hard¬ ware and software by Dec. 31. Al¬ though observers expect Bell to switch Message Telecommunications and Wats users over the satellite cir¬ cuit gradually and selectively, the Bell letters emphasize that New Year's Eve is the latest they can ex¬ pect to smoothly continue data com¬ munications with existing facilities. In the remaining eight months, us¬ ers can try adjusting software and configurations, applying the TTC products to check whether the ad¬ justments do any good, the spokes¬ man explained. TTC is located at 7 Dalamar St., Gaithersburg, Md. 20760.

Double-Density Unit Memorex is concentrating its production primarily on its 3652 double-density unit. The double-density unit, which IBM does not pro¬ duce, approaches the capaci¬ ty of the 3380 and is a good alternative for users running out of storage, Land said. Users' need for storage is growing at greater than 507c per year, noted Eric Ringk- job, general manager of Stor¬ age Technology Corp.'s (STC) Disk System Division. STC has already put its 8650 double-density disk drive on allocation for the near term, he reported. Like Memorex, STC is putting most of its production effort on its dou¬ ble-density drives. The firm has already increased pro¬ duction levels several times this year. Although STC's delivery schedule is a bit vague at pre¬ sent, users can expect to wait at least six months for most high-demand units, Ringk- job said. Prior to the current squeeze, the company was delivering most disk units in 60 days. IBM is also responding to the demand for 3350 disks. Ringkjob claimed IBM has reassigned 3350s to new pro¬ duction status from limited new production, with deliv¬ ery time for these units set at 24 months, up from four- months delivery a little more than a year ago. Despite IBM's claim that it will ship the 3380s in the fourth quarter, Ringkjob wondered whether IBM can gain control over its techni¬ cal problems by that date. STC's already-announced 8380, the firm's alternative to the 3380, is set for delivery between mid-1982 and early 1983. Plug-compatible vendors are not the only ones feeling the heat of user demand. Third-party vendors' phones have been ringing off the hooks, and 3350s are priced at about 130% of IBM's cur¬ rent list. \" Report Says GSD-DPD Rivalry Means Sales Put Above Users By Tom Henkel CVV Staff ALBANY, N.Y. — Competi¬ tion between IBM's General Systems Division (GSD) and Data Processing Division (DPD) is often severe, and salesmen from both divi¬ sions often put the sale above the customer's best in¬ terests, according to a former GSD service engineer. The competition seems to be keenest between GSD's System / 38 and DPD's 4300, which appear to compete for the same niche in the hierar¬ chy of processors. IBM reportedly has a rtile that if a given client is an ex¬ isting GSD client, the GSD salesman has first dibs on selling a System/38. The op¬ posite applies to current DPD customers, according to former GSD Systems Engi¬ neer Peter Perry. Perry now runs his own consulting firm. Advanced Management Research, Inc. (AMR), which recently is¬ sued a report entitled \"IBM System/38 In-Depth Evalua¬ tion.\" Difficult Choice The choice between the System/38 and the 4300 is a difficult one for the customer to make. Perry noted. In many ways the two systems look alike. Both processors use large-scale integration (LSI) technology, both em¬ ploy 64K-bvte memory chips with 704 circuits per chip, and both lines of processors can use IBM's 3262 and 3203 printers. In addition, . the larger models in both lines can support IBM's 3370 disk drives. However, that is where the similarity ends. System/ 38 tends to be less expensive than the 4300, but there are some trade-offs. The 4300 is mired in 370-era technology, but it can also take advantage of the volu¬ minous amounts of software designed for the 370 series. System / 38, on the other hand, is all new hardware, but it is somewhat at a disad¬ vantage in that some soft¬ ware that IBM announced with the processor still has not been delivered. And many specialized packages, available in 370 versions, have not been developed for System/38, Perry said. According to AMR's Sys¬ tem/38 analysis, people and training costs are another key divider between Sys¬ tem/38 and the 4300. The 4300 will probably require additional, more sophisticat¬ ed personnel to develop and maintain IBM packages like CICS/IMS and DL/1. In ad¬ dition, 4300-trained person¬ nel tend to cost more than System/ 38 people, who are basically retrained System/ 3 operators. Assuming the customer's current installation is a Sys¬ tem/3 shop, AMR said it would cost approximately $2,600 and take 5 to 6 weeks to train an experienced RPG- II user, given the added com¬ plexities of System/38's RPG-III. However, it will cost approximately the same amount to train a DP manag¬ er or lead programmer how to operate a 4300, AMR said. To migrate from a System/ 3 to a System/ 38 or 4300 — one of the more popular mi¬ grations — will require pro¬ gram, operating system and data file conversions. Users should plan on running du¬ plicate systems in-house dur¬ ing the conversion period to handle parallel operation and conversion in either case, the report said. RPG-II is supported on the 4300, but the System/ 3 ver¬ sion is not wholly compati¬ ble with the 4300 version. The user will have to make some minor changes to the HEADER and FILE specifica¬ tions, but those changes are relatively simple compared to the operating system con¬ versions necessary from Sys¬ tem/3 to the 4300. Switching from RPG-II to RPG-III involves some file changes and conversion to System /38's data base man¬ agement system support. Necessary changes include a standardization of file names and a definition of access paths, the report said. CPF Framework In terms of operating soft¬ ware, System/ 38 was de¬ signed for the interactive workstation environment. The Control Program Facility provides a work-manage¬ ment framework, which al¬ lows the user to control sys¬ tem resources. System/ 38 is a virtual machine that uses the qoncept of single-level stor¬ age incorporating main stor¬ age and auxiliary storage into one address space. The 4300,,, on the other hand, offers native DOS/ VSE, OS/VS1 and VM/370. The larger 4341 also offers IBM's biggest op¬ erating system, MVS-SP. In short, AMR is pro-Sys- tem/38 in most cases. How¬ ever, the firm favors the 4300 in environments that have to deal with a medium to large¬ sized processor. The System / 38 Report costs $65.

April 13, 1981 H^COMPUTERWORLD Page 11 Illinois Court Strikes Down Software Tax Policy By Bruce Hoard CVV Staff SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Ruling that software is intangible personal prop¬ erty and thus nontaxable, the Illinois Supreme Court last week struck down a state software tax “policy\" that foe years had assessed prewrit¬ ten software as a product. In its April 2 action, the court up- #held an earlier county circuit court ruling in favor of the First National Bank of Springfield, which mounted the first legal challenge to the State Department of Revenue policy. Representing the court's 6-0 ruling. Justice William G. Clark wrote, “In short, it is not the tapes which are the substance of the transaction, it is the information. We therefore hold that the sale of computer software ... is, in substance, the transfer of intangi¬ ble property and, as such, is not tax¬ able under the [sales tax].\" The Revenue Department had claimed the software-bearing tapes were taxable as tangible personal property because they are similar to books, films and photograph records. The case originated when the de¬ partment's 1978 audit of the bank re¬ vealed it had purchased both appli¬ cation and system software from «*■ three sources between January 1974 and June 1977: Pansophic Systems, Florida Software Services and Na¬ tional City Bank of Cleveland. Under the strictures of a policy that has evidently been in effect “since the beginning of the industry,” ac¬ cording to a Revenue Department of¬ ficial, the department assessed a $24,385.88 tax to the bank in the form of a notice of deficiency. The sum was based on a 4% sales tax and a 1% user tax designed to promote intra¬ state commerce. Bank Balks The bank balked at paying. “We weren't trying to hide it at all,\" said Mark H. Ferguson, an attorney repre¬ senting the bank about the software purchases. “We just believed from the beginning it was intangible.\" Although a subsequent hearing be¬ fore the department resulted in a lesser ($8,634.24) assessment, the bank was not satisfied and pressed its case further, this time to the county circuit court, where it won its first victory. Now it was the state's turn to appeal, and Illinois Assistant Attor¬ ney General Patricia Rosen peti¬ tioned the state Supreme Court on Feb. 14 of last year. Magnuson Hikes Lease, Rent Cost SAN JOSE, Calif. — Magnuson Computer Systems, Inc. has raised rental and lease charges on its M80 line of IBM-compatible processors by 67E Purchase prices on the M80 line were not changed, Magnuson said. Like IBM, which raised its prices in December, Magnuson said the in¬ creases reflect the higher cost of do¬ ing business. The M80 line is com¬ patible mainly with IBM's 4300 line and some 370 series models. M80s are also compatible with IBM's older 360 series, the firm said. Why? \"Because they purchased prewritten software, which we con¬ sider to be a product and not a ser¬ vice,\" Rosen said. There are two categories of soft¬ ware in the state's eyes, she added: custom, which is considered to be a service and therefore not taxable; and prewritten, which is considered to be a product and therefore taxable. Asked if he felt the department's decision to tax the bank was arbi¬ trary, Ferguson, who claimed he knew of no other banks who had been similarly .taxed, replied, \"Look¬ ing at it from our point of view, I think it is.\" Rosen disagreed, saying \"Every¬ one's been taxed like this for years; this is just the first case involving the validity of it.\" Just how many years and how much money the state has taken into its coffers from the policy is seem¬ ingly not determinable, according to Revenue Department officials. The problem is that revenues from the tax are diffused throughout a mvriad of categories, making it impossible to determine an exact, or even approxi¬ mate number The state Iras two options if it wish¬ es tii reverse the Supreme Court rul¬ ing, Rosen said. It can petition the court for a rehearing or \"lobby the legislature.\" Neither she nor Fergu¬ son would hazard a guess on the probable outcome of such actions. Complicating the situation is the state's undefined policy on what software is taxable. The Revenue De¬ partment has indicated it feels mem- orvless computer games may also fall under its taxable jurisdiction. It will decide on that matter \"pretty quick¬ ly/' according to a department offi¬ cial. There is also some question as to who is the proper authority to lew a software tax. \"It certainly shouldn't be the Department of Revenue,\" Fer¬ guson declared. An official from the Revenue Department rebutted bv saving, \"All laws emanate from the state legislature. The department's job is to implement what is written into law.\" Approximately 20 states are cur¬ rently' taxing software in one form or another, while 14 have exempted it.

DC. — Private-line rates will in¬ crease 50% for Telpak users and 30% for others as a result of a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decision last week raising AT&T's al¬ lowable rate of return to 12.75% from its previous 10.50 , a knowledgeable source here predicted. The commission's decision followed a two-year investi¬ gation bv an FCC trial exam¬ iner who last January recom¬ mended a 10.87% rate of return. Last month, the FCC trial staff, which represents the public in tariff proceed¬ ings, recommended an 11.5% rate of return for AT&T. AT&T Board Chairman Charles Brown made a rare personal appearance before the commission prior to last week's ruling, which was de¬ cided upon at a closed meet¬ ing. At the moment, AT&T has a 16.4% increase in private¬ line rates pending before the FCC. That tariff is supposed to become effective May 14. According to the source quoted above — an attorney for one of the user groups in¬ volved in the private-line proceeding — the phone company is now likely to ask for immediate imposition of the 16.4% increase. \"I will be very surprised if they don't file this week or next for an additional pri¬ vate-line increase, as well as for higher MTS [dial-up] charges,\" he added. There is little that users can do to prevent these increases from being implemented, he added. Requests for recon¬ sideration of last week's deci¬ sion are inevitable, he added, but the chances that the com¬ mission will defer its higher rate of return authorization are \"nil.\" Going to court is also point- NTIA Slams Bell's 'Flash Cut' By Phil Hirsch CW Washington Bureau WASHINGTON, D.C. — \"The arguments presented in AT&T's petition do not con¬ vince us that the particular 'flash cut' transition pro¬ posed [by the phone compa¬ ny] will better serve the pub¬ lic interest than some form of bifurcated transition,\" the National Telecommunica¬ tions and Information Ad¬ ministration (NTIA) told the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) early this month. The agency was responding to a phone company propos¬ al that would amend a key provision of the FCC's Sec¬ ond Computer Inquiry deci¬ sion. The decision allows AT&T terminal equipment in¬ stalled after March 1, 1982 to be offered on a detariffed ba¬ sis by a separate subsidiary, but it requires previously in¬ stalled equipment to remain regulated until various tran¬ sition issues are resolved. Under the \"flash cut\" detar- iffing scheme recommended by AT&T, all terminal equip¬ ment — newly installed and already installed — would be deregulated next March. The company said the FCC's \"bi¬ furcated\" approach would be unworkable and would also impose excessive costs on customers. NTIA and several industry less at this moment, he said; the court will not act until the commission has disposed of reconsideration petitions. About all users can do is ask the FCC for an accounting order. It would require the phone company to place in escrow the added revenue earned from its newly authorized rate of return until petitions for reconsideration and sub¬ sequent court appeals were groups have filed petitions opposing the flash cut scheme. One. concern is that if all terminal equipment is detariffed next March, many of the transitional issues will not be resolved. Such questions as the price to be paid by the separate subsidiary for AT&T's termi¬ nal inventories and related assets have not yet been set¬ tled, the critics pointed out. AT&T's EIS Test Halted in Austin AUSTIN, Texas — Prepara¬ tions for testing a videotex- based Electronic Information System (EIS) here next June have been halted by South¬ western Bell Teleplaone Co. after an adverse court ruling. The test is considered na¬ tionally significant because EIS is on the leading edge of AT&T's thrust into the on¬ line services business. EIS, utilizing dial-up tele¬ phone circuits, would pro¬ vide interactive information services to the home through standard TV sets and/or low- cost telephone/CRT termi¬ nals. Telephone directory service is one application, but the system being developed by Southwestern Bell in col¬ laboration with AT&T also would support teleshopping and permit users to store per¬ sonal information in an on¬ line central base. Texas newspaper publish¬ ers, together with Datapoint Corp., persuaded the state Public Utilities Commission (PUC) several weeks ago to bar the phone company from proceeding with the test un¬ til their objections have been considered. Essentially, the opponents argued that the test cannot legally begin until and un¬ less Bell obtains permission from the Federal Communi¬ cations Commission. Southwestern Bell took the PUC to a state district court, which ruled in the PUC's fa¬ vor. The phone company then asked the Texas appeals court here to consider the lower court's ruling. That pe¬ tition is currently pending. disposed of. But users would still have to pay the higher charges allowed by last week's ruling. The estimate that private¬ line rates for Telpak users will rise 50% and that rates for others leasing private lines will increase 30% is our source's best guess regarding the impact of the pending and prospective tariff changes. It assumes that Telpak ser¬ vice will be discontinued, forcing present users to mi¬ grate to other AT&T private¬ line offerings. The only bright spot in this picture, he added, is that the specialized carriers might not hike their charges as well. \"On the other hand, the specialized carrier networks aren't nearly as extensive as AT&T's facilities, and some specialized carriers — such as MCI [Communications Corp.] — appear to be more interested in selling dial-up long-distance telephone ser¬ vice — so some users who want to migrate may have trouble doing so.\" Reportedly, the FCC's trial staff was extremely angered by last week's commission decision. One staffer said, \"The question almost seemed to be whether they [the commissioners] would give AT&T more than they actually wanted. Some peo¬ ple here are very upset.\" During an open hearing immediately before last week's decision to raise AT&T's rate of return, Charles Brown, chairman of the phone company, said \"it is my belief that no issue cur¬ rently confronting our busi¬ ness — and there are more than a few — has more im¬ portance than the commis¬ sion's decision in this matter. \"It has serious bearing on the Bell System's ability to continue to render good, ef¬ ficient service to its custom¬ ers. At stake here [in addition to] the financial health of the Bell System is the long-term capability of a vital part of the nation's social and eco¬ nomic nerve system.\" After the decision was an¬ nounced, AT&T Vice-Presi¬ dent James R. Billingsley is¬ sued an additional statement. \"The FCC's deci¬ sion, after an exhaustive two- year proceeding, clearly rec¬ ognizes the importance of adequate earnings to our ser¬ vice capabilities,\" he said. \"This is a good-faith effort on the part of the commis¬ sion to accommodate our needs to the galloping infla¬ tion with which we all have to contend. We hope it will be sufficient to enable us to hold our own in the fiercely competitive capital market¬ place.\" AGENTS WANTED FOR MANUFACTURING SOFTWARE.

Consultant Practical Training Since 1965 By Bruce Hoard CW Staff RICHMOND, Va. — Telecommuni¬ cations is about to emerge from its infancy and dominate the design of business structures, Peter G.VV. Keen, associate professor of management science at MIT's Sloan School of Management, said here recently. Like other evolving technologies, telecommunications needed an in¬ frastructure before it could realize its potential. Keen said. The growing number of communi¬ cations satelites, improved terrestrial links and more sophisticated hard¬ ware have now provided that infra¬ structure. \"We're really at a massive takeoff point for telecommunications in or¬ ganizations,\" the professor told a gathering of about 400 people at the Communications in the 21st Century conference. The time is right for telecommuni¬ cations because business is under pressure to drive revenues up and costs down. Keen commented. Break-Even Point With hardware costs decreasing at an annual rate of 20% and labor costs increasing at a 10% clip, the \"break¬ even point\" where the former will no longer nullify the latter, will ar¬ rive within four years, putting more pressure on managers to realize eco¬ nomic efficiency. Keen claimed. Besides acting as an economic hedge, telecommunications will be a necessary strategic element in busi¬ ness plans, he added at the confer¬ ence, which was funded by Philip Morris, Inc. and sponsored by the Annenberg schools of communica¬ tion at the University of Virginia and the University of Southern Califor¬ nia. Adjustments will have to be made. A letter of credit will no longer be a tangible, tactile entity. \"Where is the letter of credit or funds transfer when it's created on a CRT?\" he asked. \"Now money is a tiny little blip on a 9,600 bit/sec line.\" The most ominous implications for change are those faced by first-line managers, he noted. That belea¬ guered group is \"responsible to workers for the old system and man¬ agement for the new one,\" the pro¬ fessor said. Managers will not only have to learn new methods of evaluating and instructing; they will have to face the stark spectre of unemployment. Lower levels of management are be¬ ing \"significantly eroded,\" Keen de¬ clared. Even top executives will not escape unscathed, he said. In the past, they have been quick to favor change for their subordinates. In the future, they, too, will have to adapt. Com¬ munications is no longer a \"nice lit¬ tle link,\" but an essential ingredient, he observed. New Discipline Essential enough that Keen favored creating an entire new academic dis¬ cipline around it. He called for a field entitled \"Telecommunications and Business Policy,\" to be backed by academic research and investigations into the business, behavioral and technical factors involved. Calling the explosion of telecom¬ munications \"a revolution that has happened,\" he added, \"Communica¬ tions doesn't just link components, it transmutes them.\" Louis H. Mertes, vice-president and general manager of systems at Conti¬ nental Bank in Chicago, won notori¬ ety for himself and his organization when he went to a paperless, desk¬ less office. Tired of \"telephone tag,\" \"the pa¬ per chase\" and other wastes of time, he reached out for some new — and some old — communications tech¬ nologies. Mertes can read his electronic mail (new technology) on the CRT termi¬ nal mounted on the coffee table that, along with three chairs, is the only furniture in his office. He uses dicta¬ tion (old technology) to beat the tele¬ phone tag blues. Telephone tag results when one telephone call after another is re¬ turned in vain as busy people move in and out of meetings while they at¬ tempt to contact each other. In order to receive what he called a \"full mes¬ sage,\" Mertes encourages his callers P!«a»e Print: Name/Title Company _ Address City/State/Zip Louis H. Mertes Association of Computer Users Post Office Box 9003, Boulder, Colorado 80301 to call once and dictate their message to his tape recorder. \"It's an extraordinary, interesting process,\" the vice-president said, adding it takes callers a few times to become comfortable with the con¬ cept. The-vice president is using telecon¬ ferencing to eliminate the time for¬ merly wasted by co-workers who would take up to an hour to reach his office from nearby buildings. And the elimination of paper has caught on with Continental customers and even suppliers, who have all ex¬ pressed an interest in going paper¬ less, he claimed. CW Photos by B. Hoard Peter G.W.

The House subcommittee was interested in the British \"vacuum.\" Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Govern¬ ment Information and Indi¬ vidual Rights, English said the present fragmentation of responsibility for these inter¬ national issues \"is unbeliev¬ able\" and said he hopes the legislation will spur the ad¬ ministration to act soon. The reorganization bill, in¬ troduced by English Feb. 19, is a revision of similar legis¬ lation proposed last year by the previous subcommittee chairman, former Rep. Rich¬ ardson Prever (D-N.C.) [CW, Dec. 1 5], The legislation grew out of activities because they are asking to those suggested in legislation proposed here re¬ cently to centralize federal responsibilities for interna¬ tional communications and information issues in a new White House entity (see sto¬ ry this page). Acard Report According to Morgan, the appointment of Kenneth Baker, a former British min¬ ister and head of that gov¬ ernment's Computer Adviso¬ ry Council as well as consultant to the software firm, Logica, Ltd., followed publication last September of a special report by the British Advisory Council for Ap¬ plied Research and Develop¬ ment (Acard). Acard was established in last year's hearings by the subcommittee that heard a stream of private-sector rep¬ resentatives complain about a lack of a centralized gov¬ ernment approach to the in¬ creasingly numerous and complex issues of trans- border data flow [CW, March 17, March 31]. A report prepared by the subcommittee late last year said \"the U.S. government has no coordinated policy re¬ garding barriers to interna¬ tional data flow. The author¬ ity and responsibility to develop policy is divided among several agencies on a conflicting and often confus¬ ing basis.\" Council Proposed To rectify that situation, the English bill would establish in the Executive Office of the President a Council on Inter¬ national Communications and Information, represent¬ ing the main players in the area, including the State De¬ partment, the National Tele¬ communications and Infor¬ mation administration, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the U.S. Trade Representative. The mandate of the council would be to \"develop and implement a uniform, con¬ sistent and comprehensive U.S. policy on international communications and infor¬ mation and advise the Presi¬ dent with respect to interna¬ tional communications and information.\" The council, backed by a private-sector advisory com¬ mittee and a government in¬ teragency committee, would coordinate policies and activ¬ ities of all federal agencies concerning these issues and review all federal agency policv determinations reiat- 1976 to advise the British government on applied re¬ search and development in the UK, the role of that coun¬ try in international collabo¬ ration in the field and the fu¬ ture development and application of technology. The Acard report, \"Infor¬ mation Technology,\" con¬ cluded — in terms remark¬ ably similar to those of a recent report by the U.S. House subcommittee — that \"British activities . . . are fragmented and organized in traditional sectors which do not correspond to the new technological possibilities.\" Echoing U.S. private-sector complaints about American government organization, the Acard report said respon¬ sibilities for information technology policies are ing to them. English said he is not wed¬ ded to the policymaking mechanisms called for in the legislation and said the two days of hearings called last week were to get input on how the government can best be restructured to deal with these international is¬ sues. The subcommittee chair¬ man noted the State Depart¬ ment has the authority, but has not exercised it in the past to be the central policy¬ making body. Looking at the department under the new administra¬ tion, English added, \"We haven't seen any indication they intend to do so or are going to do it.\" He said, \"It would just tick¬ le me to death\" if State would asserts its authority in these areas, \"but it just ain't goint to happen.\" No. 1 Priority The No. 1 priority, he con¬ tinued, is to develop policies immediately. The issue is too important to the national economy to \"just let it slide\" until some¬ one in the executive branch decides to act. \"We've got one heck of a vacuum and somebody's go¬ ing to have to fill it,\" English maintained, and said if the administration does get around to"
