For purposes of this Agreement, the use of any such material on any other Web, Internet, intranet, extranet or other site or computer environment is prohibited.

Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions, or materials other than those that we have specifically requested. We employ staff and consultants who may be working on the same or similar ideas. We hope you will understand that it is the intent of this policy to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects developed by our professional staff and/or consultants might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Please do not send us any unsolicited original creative materials of any kind. While we do value your feedback on your experience using the Site and the services and products offered in connection with the Site, we request that you be specific in your comments with respect to the same, and not submit any creative ideas, suggestions, or materials (unless specifically requested by us).\n\nIf, at our request, you send certain specific submissions or, despite our request, you send us creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts, or other information (collectively, the “Submissions”), the Submissions shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property. None of the Submissions shall be subject to any obligation of confidentiality on our part and we shall not be liable for any use or disclosure of any Submissions. Without limitation of the foregoing, we shall exclusively own all now known or hereafter existing rights to the Submissions of every kind and nature throughout the world and shall be entitled to unrestricted use of the Submissions for any purpose whatsoever, commercial or otherwise, without compensation or notice to, or approval by, the provider of the Submissions. Xytex does not waive any rights it may have to ideas previously known to it or developed by its employees and representatives, or obtained from sources other than you, which ideas are similar or related to Submissions.\n\nFORUMS AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATION\n\n“Forum” means a chat area, message board, or interactive function or feature offered as part of the Site. If you participate in a Forum within the Site, if applicable, you must not: (i) defame, abuse, harass or threaten others; (ii) make any bigoted, hateful or racially offensive statements; (iii) advocate illegal activity or discuss illegal activities with the intent to commit them; (iv) post or distribute any material that infringes, misappropriates and/or violates any right of a third party or any law; (v) post or distribute any vulgar, obscene, discourteous or indecent language or images; (vi) advertise or sell to, or solicit others; (vii) use the Forum for commercial purposes of any kind other than to facilitate a transaction on the Site; (viii) post or distribute any software or other materials which contain a virus or other harmful component; (ix) post material or make statements that do not generally pertain to the designated topic or theme of any Forum; or (x) submit any content that negatively reflects on the Site or the Xytex brand and its goodwill, or is otherwise objectionable as determined in Xytex’s sole discretion. Nor may you submit any content to a Forum that advertises or links to other sites for your commercial purposes, include viruses, corrupted data or other harmful, disruptive or destructive files, or may expose the Site or its users to any harm. You shall remain solely responsible for the content of your messages and shall indemnify and hold the Indemnified Parties (described in Part VIII below) harmless for the content of such messages. We reserve the right to remove or edit content from any Forum at any time and for any reason. While we may review content posted to or through a Forum, we are under no obligation to do so.\n\nBy uploading materials or posting any content to any Forum or otherwise submitting any materials to us, you (1) represent and warrant that such material or content is original to you, no other party has any rights in it, and it complies with this Agreement, and (2) automatically grant us a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive, fully transferable, assignable, sub-licensable right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, publicly perform and display, create derivative works from and distribute such materials or incorporate such materials or content, including all data, images, creative works, sounds, text, and other things embodied in it, into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the world. In addition, you waive any rights to compensation, attribution or any other “moral rights” in such materials and content.\n\nWhen participating in a Forum, proceed with caution and never assume that people are who they say they are, know what they say they know, or are affiliated with whom they say they are affiliated with in any chat room, message board, or other user generated content area. In the event that you connect with us outside of the Site through any third party social media or sharing platform such as Facebook®, Twitter Inc., your use of such platform is subject to that platform’s separate terms and conditions.\n\nCONTENT LINKED TO THE SITE\n\nLinks to other sites we think may be of interest to you are provided for your convenience. By providing these links, we are not endorsing, sponsoring or recommending such sites or the materials disseminated by or content or services provided by them (“Third Party Content”), and are not responsible for the Third Party Content. We reserve the right to disable links from any third party sites to the Site. We make no representations concerning Third Party Content that may be referenced on the Site, and are not responsible for the accuracy, relevancy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of Third-Party Content. Nor do we have any control over the privacy practices of any third party sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy and terms of use for any site to which you link to from this Site.\n\nVII.

WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE OR THE SERVICES, CONTENT, MATERIALS OR FUNCTIONS ACCESSIBLE ON, OR THROUGH THE SITE WILL BE CONTINUOUSLY AVAILABLE, UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THE SITE, SERVICES, CONTENT, MATERIALS OR THE SERVERS THAT MAKE THE SITE OR SUCH SERVICES, CONTENT AND MATERIALS AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS OR ARE ACCURATE OR COMPLETE.

YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION AS A RESULT OF USING THE SITE AND OUR SERVICES. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\nIn the event we are held liable for any damages related to such matters, your sole and exclusive remedy will be limited to reimbursement for actual out-of-pocket expenses for services or products paid by you to us. You hereby waive any and all rights to bring any claim or action related to such matters in any forum beyond one (1) year after the first occurrence of the kind of act, event, condition or omission upon which the claim or action is based.\n\nThe Indemnified Parties (described in Part VIII below) are not responsible for telephone, electric, electronic, network, Internet, computer, hardware or software program malfunctions, failures, delays or difficulties, or late, lost, stolen, illegible, incomplete, garbled, misdirected, mutilated or postage due mail, e-mail, form postings, connections, messages or entries, or the security of any and all such matters.\n\nFurther, such Indemnified Parties are not responsible for incorrect or inaccurate entry information, whether caused by Internet users or by any of the equipment or programming associated with or utilized in the Site or by any technical or human error which may occur in the processing of any information related to the Site.\n\nWe may prohibit you from participating in or utilizing the Site if in our sole and absolute discretion you show a disregard for the terms of this Agreement or act with the intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any other user, or in any other disruptive manner. We also reserve the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content or cancel orders in our sole and absolute discretion.\n\nWe reserve the right to suspend access or discontinue the Site, in whole or in part, at any time, for any reason, including infection by computer virus, bugs, tampering, unauthorized intervention, fraud, technical failures, or any other causes beyond the reasonable control of Xytex, without prior notice.\n\nYou also agree that the Indemnified Parties (described in Part VIII below) are not responsible or liable in any way for injury, loss or damage to your computer or interception or use of credit card or payment information, related to or resulting from use of the Site or any sites, services or materials linked or related thereto or there from and also are not responsible or liable in any way for any injury, loss, claim or damage relating to or resulting from any part of the Site operating or not operating on computers or networks used by you or communicating with such computers or networks.\n\nAlthough we intend that product descriptions contained in the Site be current and accurate, we make no warranty or representation that descriptions of products in the Site are accurate, complete, current, or reliable in any or all respects.\n\nWE MAKE NO GUARANTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY OR PRIVACY OF ANY COMMUNICATION OR INFORMATION TRANSMITTED ON THE SITE OR ANY WEB SITE LINKED TO THE SITE.

NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING FROM YOUR RELIANCE UPON THE INFORMATION PROVIDED ON THE SITE.\n\nSearch and Directory are free services which may be offered in connection with the Site.
