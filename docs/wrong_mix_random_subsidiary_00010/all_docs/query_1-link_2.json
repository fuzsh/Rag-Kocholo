        "text": "Cryptography and Hardware Security Expert, NCSC\n\nPaul has worked in cryptography and hardware security since graduating with a degree in mathematics in 2001. He has represented the NCSC and its predecessor organisation in various standards bodies, including the Trusted Computing Group, Global Platform and FIDO. His current role in NCSC allows him to spend time with academic and industry partners learning what the future holds for security technology, and also to help user communities take advantage of new features. Outside of work Paul likes to cycle up small hills in summer, and ski down bigger ones in winter.\n\nPresentation: Securing our digital foundations\n\nProducing products and systems that are ‘secure by default’ requires us to address fundamental security issues at root cause. As well as engineering complexity this also requires us to understand and work alongside the commercial and regulatory environment in which our complex technology ecosystems develop. We have to ensure the right incentive models exist to improve resilience to cyber attack right through the technology stack.\n\nVP, Security Solutions, Keysight\n\nScott Register has more than 15 years of experience leading product management and go-to-market activities for global technology companies and is currently Vice President for Security Solutions for Keysight where he is tasked with bringing new security solutions to market across Keysight’s broad solution portfolio.\n\nPrior his current role, Scott was vice president of product management leading the development of products in the areas of Security, Virtualization and Cloud. Earlier, Scott spearheaded the company’s visibility product line.\n\nScott brings Keysight broad experience in managing enviable growth across a diverse range of environments, from embryonic to VC-backed startup to multi-hundred-million-dollar product lines. He has previously led product lines for security vendors such as Blue Coat and CheckPoint Software.\n\nHe holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science from Georgia Institute of Technology, where he also served as a member of research faculty.\n\nPresentation: IoT Security – What You Don’t Know Can Kill You\n\nIf you’re responsible for securing a network with traditional IT devices, you’ve got the benefit of established best practices for security. You know to keep your desktop OS and antivirus up to date, which solves over 90% of your problems. You have access to threat intel feeds which talk about the latest threat campaigns and zero-days against Windows and Linux systems, and popular apps. That’s great.\n\nBut… most of the new devices you’re rolling out on your network aren’t these traditional IT devices. They’re printers, badge scanners, smart building thermostats and lighting systems, badge scanners, and webcams, plus all the wearables and personal devices your employees are cluttering your WLAN with. So what about those? How do you know if all of these new devices are expanding your attack surface? How can you conduct a meaningful bake-off to select the most secure vendor, or know what to bug your vendors about, or even how to deploy meaningful mitigation for vulnerabilities you can’t directly address? Because if you’re just hoping your IoT vendor is on top of things and testing all of this for you, you may be in for a rude awakening. You might remember that the Mirai botnet, the largest to swamp the Internet to date, was based on vulnerable IoT devices – and there are plenty of other examples out there.\n\nBut these vulnerabilities aren’t always introduced by the manufacturer with their logo on the box. In many cases, there are inherent vulnerabilities in the integrated communication controller (System on Chip, or SOC) which handles the Ethernet, WiFi, Bluetooth, and even cellular communication (such as the Sweyntooth and Braktooth series of Bluetooth vulnerabilities). Whether you’re the device manufacturer or the deployer, if you’re on the hook for the security of these indispensable gadgets, you should really understand what kinds of vulnerabilities may be baked in that can enable crashes, reboots, data leakage, or even escalation of privilege.\n\nIn this discussion, we’ll present two significant testing regimes you can add to your arsenal with reasonable effort:\n\n1. Protocol fuzzing – to discover previously unknown flaws in L2/3 protocol stack implementations\n\n2. Vulnerability assessment – to search for known CVEs and uncover issues such as weak encryption, susceptibility to brute-force attacks, and exposure of unnecessary services.\n\nWe’ll also present a brief summary of a few relevant standards for securing various types of connected devices including consumer and industrial IoT and connected vehicles.\n\nAnd, because no one likes Death by PowerPoint, I’ll show a few brief yet cool demos of IoT hacking.\n\nAssistant Professor, UCL\n\nAnna Maria Mandalari works as Assistant Professor at University College London (UCL).

Along with their benefits come potential privacy and security threats. To limit these threats a number of commercial services have become available (IoT safeguards). The safeguards claim to provide protection against IoT privacy risks and security threats.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness and the associated privacy risks of these safeguards remains a key open question. In this presentation, we investigate the threat detection capabilities of IoT safeguards.\n\nWe develop and release an approach for automated safeguards experimentation to reveal their response to common security threats and privacy risks.\n\nWe perform thousands of automated experiments using popular commercial IoT safeguards when deployed in a large IoT testbed.\n\nOur results indicate not only that these devices may be ineffective in preventing risks, but also their cloud interactions and data collection operations may introduce privacy risks for the households that adopt them.\n\nCEO, NquiringMinds\n\nNick is CEO of NquiringMinds, an AI analytics company founded on robust cyber security principles.

How do we practically monitor and mange connected systems, using a dynamic, multi factor notion of trustworthiness.\n\nWhat does it mean to say a device is trusted? Can we measure it? Can we tell if its changed?\n\nWe will delve into the practical details, that determine trustworthiness: Device identities, manufacturer certificates, trusted boot, software components, vulnerability analysis, vulnerability resilient techniques, device behaviours, device owners all the way though to purchase records. We will look at the technologies that underpin these notions: iDevID , SBOM, CVE analysis, MUD descriptors through to new CHERI instructions sets. We will review the recent NIST work on Trusted Onboarding and Lifecyle management and explore the role this could play going forward.\n\nWe will look at the continuum from simple IOT systems with monolithic hardware, to complex enterprise software to fully distributed trained AI systems.\n\nChief Product Officer, Radix IoT, LLC\n\nAs Chief Product Officer of Radix IoT––Michael Skurla (LEED AP O+M & BD+C, MIES, ASHRAE, IoTSF) has over 25 years of experience in control automation and building technology product design with Fortune 500 companies. He is a contributing member of CABA, ASHRAE, IES Education, and USGBC and a frequent lecturer on the developing use of analytics and emerging IT technologies to foster efficiency within commercial facility design focusing on the intersection of software and hardware that emphasizes data aggregation and analytics for mission-critical industries. As a well-recognized thought leader, Skurla’s contributed articles and interviews have appeared in such top industry publications as Smart Buildings Magazine, Energies Magazine, IoT Evolution, Network World, RTInsights, RFID Journal, LEDs Magazine, Critical Facilities, Oilman Magazine, IoT Playbook, IoT News, Digitalisation World (UK), LD+A, among others.\n\nPresentation: The Risks and Rewards of the Emerging Synergistic Building Portfolio\n\nAccording to MarketsandMarkets, the building automation market is projected to reach a staggering $148.6 billion in revenue by 2027, growing at a notable CAGR of 11.4% from 2022 to 2027. This growth is driven by the rise of IoT-enabled building automation, which has introduced new products and technologies. Building technologies have not always followed the most secure path, leaving security until recently as an afterthought in both product and industry standards within the building automation space. Given this, it is crucial to understand both the risks and rewards associated with this emerging technology as it pertains to the expectations of building owners and operations to both meet the system objectives as well as meet fast-moving I.T. security requirements.\n\nWhile IoT devices hold the promise of data, products used in buildings have often overlooked the critical aspect of security, leaving the burden on the network to deal with finding a solution to the products’ shortcomings. It is essential to shift the focus to building system designs that foster a “secure by design” philosophy, which is complex as the average expected lifespan of building technologies far exceeds that of I.T. equipment (Often 20+ years).\n\nBuildings typically are comprised of a several dozen subsystems that have historically dealt with vast amounts of siloed data, primarily used for diagnostics and fault detection. This siloed approach however has in recent years moved to more of a synergistic approach where subsystems have joined I.T. networks to both exchange information but allow for the use of the information in more beneficial ways such as preventative and predictive maintenance, and asset life cycle management (to name just a few).\n\nIn general, IoT platforms and next-generation BMS platforms have taken on addressing the security challenges on these mixed networks to allow for seamlessly unifying systems for actionable business intelligence while ensuring interoperability and full data exchange with existing systems. These unified platforms (born traditionally out of I.T., not building systems) have the additional benefit of integration through APIs to help connect to third-party microservice analytics, data lakes, work order management, and other integrated solutions. All of this contributes to what is a network of networks and consequently typically a solution with a fairly large surface area of attack.\n\nHowever, the building market has embraced IoT-enabled building portfolios and the associated advantages. It is essential to understand the facets required to best design these projects and prioritize security throughout the engineering process. The presentation: The Risks and Rewards of the Emerging Synergistic Building Portfolio will delve into the critical aspects of securing IoT systems used in the built world of facility management for building portfolios, through industry insights, practical examples, and best practices to help you implement secure engineering principles\n\nProduct Security Expert, Bosch Security Systems\n\nDr. Carolina Adaros is an electronics engineer, MSc in analytics and risk management, and PhD in cybersecurity. Previous to becoming a Cybersecurity professional, she accumulated experience in industrial automation, software quality management, process improvement, and technological solutions. This experience was successfully transferred to her current role in the field of Product Security.\n\nIn 2017 she started her PhD, in Birmingham, UK, with focus on cyber-risk management on Industrial Control Systems and Industrial IoT (IIoT). In 2019, while still undertaking PhD studies, she joined the Bosch Group in Germany as part of the Bosch PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team) and since 2022 she works in Bosch Building Technologies as product security expert.\n\nHer current role includes being the proxy of the Product Security Officer, maintain the product security processes and policies, do internal consultancy and trainings, and coordinate the vulnerability management and incident response processes at Bosch Building Technologies.\n\nPresentation: Product Security – challenges, successes, and learnings\n\nBosch Building Technologies and Security Systems (Bosch BT, for short) is a division of the Bosch Group whose portfolio includes access control and intrusion detection, video surveillance, fire detection, audio, and communications systems and also integration and operation of such systems. To handle cybersecurity assurance within its product lines, Bosch BT adheres to the Bosch Security Engineering Process, which indicates that products should be developed with a level of security that is equal or greater to the state-of-the-art. The Security Engineering Process (SEP) is integrated in our product engineering and covers the entire product lifecycle until decommission.\n\nSince its introduction on 2015, the Bosch SEP has evolved and matured, becoming eventually the “central mandatory process for cyber security (CS) engineering for Bosch products”. Bosch Building Technologies has also tailored this process to the needs of the different product lines and services. However, while we are well-aligned with security industry best practices, we still have pending challenges to make sure that processes are followed adequately, in every instance, for each product and by all the involved stakeholders.\n\nIt is also worth to mention that our journey on improving cybersecurity in products is part of the overall challenge of being traditionally a hardware company, which had to adapt to a software-oriented world. One of our main challenges is to get all relevant stakeholders to develop a good understanding of security risks. We also face several difficulties on dealing with legacy products, which are still in the field, many of which have long-time reached their end-of-life period and are not currently supported, but are still used by customers. This means that, if not connected in a secure environment, they can constitute a security risk, since they use older technologies and were not designed taking into consideration the current cyber-threat landscape. Supply chain security is also a big topic since our systems can be only as secure as their components are. For this reason, we have controls in place that enable us to select suppliers that can fulfil our security requirements. In this topic, we also have successes, thanks to our ongoing engagement with the purchasing department and the integration of our security processes within the purchasing processes.\n\nAnother success that we can name is having an internal Pentesting team. Not only have they reported findings that outsourced pentesters previously missed, but they also help providing recommendations to the development teams on the implementation of fixes and identifying needs for further support on security related activities. Last to mention but not less important is our product security community that helps us promoting security best practices and identifies opportunities of improvement. We have regular meetings, a yearly workshop that involves a strongly motivated group of people that continuously share knowledge, identify potential solutions to different pain points and engages in security-related initiatives.\n\nWe are aware that the market demands for more agility, technological innovation and integration, and the intelligent use of data to improve the quality of our lives. That is the purpose of our business. However, it is an essential part of the Bosch Quality Promise that we provide product security and protect our customers’ privacy throughout the entire product life cycle. Hence, as security professionals, our purpose is to procure that business goals and security risks are properly balanced.\n\nSecurity Engineer and Cryptographer, ANGOKA\n\nDr. Zia is Security Engineer and Cryptographer at ANGOKA. He is a certified cyber security analyst and cybersecurity professional with more than five years of experience in industry, academia and knowledge transfer partnerships.

He holds a PhD from Ulster University with specialization in developing cryptographic solutions for the Internet of Things. His fields of expertise include information security management, data privacy and protection, cryptography, zero knowledge proofs, threat analysis and risk assessment.\n\nPresentation: Device Private Networks – Zero Trust is the way forward!\n\nThe evolution of new technologies has revolutionised the cybersecurity world. Back in the day, traditional perimeter-based approaches worked well. However, in the present day world the way information is handled has drastically changed and cyber threat actors have grown smarter. Traditional schemes based on walled garden concepts can not provide sufficient security for data flowing across the Internet of Things (IoT) connected world. To cope with the changing needs of the smart world, a global scale transition towards Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) can be seen. Despite plenty of guidance and recommendations available, adoption of ZTA is not a straightforward task for complex network architectures.\n\nIn this talk, we introduce the concept of Device Private Networks (DPNs), proposed to ease ZTA adoption for IoT and Industrial IoT use cases. DPN is a security principle based on ZTA core concepts, that could allow users to achieve cybersecurity resilience as per the global security standards. Moreover, a threat landscape and comparison of DPNs with existing secure communication protocols (like VPN and TLS) will also be presented.\n\nDirector Product Security, Royal Philips\n\nXander Heemskerk is the Director Product Security – Personal Health, Digital Pathology & Brand Licensing in the Product and Services Security Office (PSSO) at Philips.

He is currently a member of CENELEC’s JTC13 WG8 RED and JTC13/WG9 CRA harmonised standards cyber-security working groups.\n\nPresentation: Radio Equipment Directive Cyber regulation and what you need to know\n\nWith the European Commission adopting the RED Delegated Act activating Article 3.3 (d), 3.3 (e) and 3.3 (f) for both consumer and professional/industrial products (C(2021) 7672 1), significant changes are coming to RED compliance. The delegated act activates these three articles and originally compliance was to become mandatory on 1st August 2024 but is expected to be formally announced shortly that the deadline will be extended to August 2025. Article 3 of the RED mandates that radio equipment shall not harm network function, incorporates personal data and privacy protection safeguards and certain functions to protect from financial fraud. In this talk Richard will provide an update for manufacturers on routes to compliance for Article 3.3, the development of the related Harmonised Standard and the relevance of the IoTSF Assurance Framework.\n\nDistinguished Engineer and Global head of security research, BT Group\n\nBen leads the global cyber security research programme in BT.

Richard is an Arm fellow, has a BA in Electrical and Information Sciences from the University\n\nPresentation: Iot Security Foundations for an AI world\n\nArm believes that security is the greatest challenge computing needs to address to meet its full potential, and the growth of the importance for AI reemphasizes this point. As is common with new technologies, AI offers both opportunities and threats to the computing world, and its security – we anticipate more autonomy in our computing systems with ever more sensitive data being held and interpreted. This will provide tremendous opportunities for interconnecting computing systems and really delivering increasing benefits for humanity, but also will bring in even greater opportunities for cyber-criminals and other bad actors. This talk will look at the various tools available to help secure computing systems. It will consider how AI can help both the creator of future systems and also the attackers, and what can be done to better defend against the impact of AI in the hands of the attackers of computer systems"
