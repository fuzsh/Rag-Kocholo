This highly-curated offering will present collectors with classic masterpieces, contemporary photography, large-scale installations, moving image and the latest innovations in technology from more than 150 Chinese and international artists.\n\nGeorgia Griffiths, PHOTOFAIRS Group Fair Director, comments: “I am really looking forward to the 5th edition of PHOTOFAIRS | Shanghai. A fair is made by its galleries and the list this year is stronger than ever – from galleries who have been with the fair since its launch in 2014 through to today’s most exciting new programmes in China and across the world. PHOTOFAIRS is proud to provide a genuine international platform for photography in Asia Pacific, and to give greater visibility to Chinese artists working across the photographic medium.”\n\nStellar Chinese galleries and artists\n\nGenerations of Chinese galleries are featured across the Fair, demonstrating PHOTOFAIRS’ dedication to the regional art scene.
