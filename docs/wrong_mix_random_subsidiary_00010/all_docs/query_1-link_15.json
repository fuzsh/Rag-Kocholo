        "text": "A round up from our 20th event\n\nA few weeks back, we reached a couple of major milestones when we hosted our recent LPWAN London Meetup event. Not only was it our 20th event, it also represented the three year anniversary of when we kicked off this vibrant gathering with interesting discussions all about the UK LPWAN ecosystem.\n\nAs usual after some networking, drinks and pizza, the evening kicked off with three interesting talks. We learned more about Vodafone’s consumer IoT business and how the NHS is experimenting with LoRaWAN. We launched our guide for IoT hardware startups to bring products from prototype into production\n\nEarlier in the year we had a chance to hear from Vodafone about their NB-IoT roll out across the west half of the country. This time we had the honour of Jonas Borgel, the Director of Consumer IoT at Vodafone, sharing the story of their rapidly growing consumer IoT business. After presenting us with market size of the billion $ cake, he showed us the initial consumer IoT products Vodafone is engaging under their V brand including wearable safety alarms, trackers, watches and cameras. In his talk he highlighted the openness of Vodafone to engage with upcoming IoT consumer device / service startups.\n\nThe second talk of the night took us into the first NHS Digital Testbed inside a hospital. Daiana Bassi, Technical Lead at DRIVE at Great Ormond Street Hospital, shared with us their vision for the use of IoT in healthcare. Two major use cases focus on Telehealth for remote patient care and the Smart Hospital. The latter includes use cases such as tracking of assets and people across the hospital and what goes on in the built environment. The first use case that Daiana discussed was the monitoring of gel dispenser use across different hospital wards with LoRaWAN to better understand the hygiene regime. An automatic dispenser was used that would send a LoRaWAN message whenever the dispenser was activated by a person. The project was carried out in collaboration with ARM, obviously in search for some interesting PR. A funny anecdote represented the initial design used a battery powered automatic dispenser which ran out of battery very shortly. This was not due to the low power LoRaWAN module, but due to the engine used for the gel extraction from the gel pouch (which reminds me a bit of the Juicero fiasco). After attending the TTN conference this week in Reading, I actually learnt who the ARM engineer was who implemented the solution! Switching to a manual dispenser solved the problem later. The second trial looked at monitoring temperature and door activities across the ward. Early experiences proved the potential of the solutions but highlighted connectivity issues which can be solved by adequate deployment of gateways (keeping just one at the main reception is not enough to cover a hospital!).\n\nThe third and final talk was provided by Richard Marshall from Xitex Ltd, who was one of the co-authors of Digital Catapult’s guide “IoT hardware from prototype to production” for IoT hardware startups. You can download it here if you are interested.\n\nHis talk gave an overview of the guide, while sharing pitfalls and difficulties that he came across in his long years of experience in the hardware industry. Richard shared many of his favourite IoT hardware blunders and continued to do so even on the panel."
