High levels of trust and confidence in these data are a pre-requisite for successful new services, which have both huge economic and social potential. • The Personal Data and Trust Network, building on world-class research and business insight, will help organisations to develop the next-generation of personal data management, giving the UK clear advantages for consumers and citizens.\n\n3. www.pdtn.org #PDT Personal Data and Trust Network: The Community SME’s Universities Corporates\n\n4. www.pdtn.org #PDT Benefits of membership…. Corporate benefits: • Access to potential innovation partners • Supports corporate open innovation programmes • Gain insight to evolving market trends, capabilities and opportunities • Visibility of academic research & innovation SME benefits: • Opportunity to meet and work with potential customers • Opportunities to meet other innovation partners to further differentiate your product • Visibility of and contribution to, cutting edge thinking • Identification of commercially important problems Academic benefits: • Problem definition of commercially important problems • Build research roadmap • Partners to commercialise capabilities 4\n\n5. www.pdtn.org #PDT Membership of the network is free. So that we can best organize events, could you register @: http://www.PDTN.org or http://www.digitalcatapultcentre.org.uk (in the “Get involved” section) Personal Data and Trust Innovators Network: Registering\n\n6. www.pdtn.org #PDT 6 www.pdtn.org #PDT The future of the network Dr Matt Stroud Head of Personal Data & Trust, Digital Catapult\n\n7. www.pdtn.org #PDT Where next? 7 • Future regular meetings • Build digital presence • Form community interest groups • Create research roadmap • Grow membership base\n\n8. www.pdtn.org #PDT Future regular meetings 8 • We intend to hold regular (quarterly?) meetings, physically bring together practitioners and researchers in Personal Data & Trust • In addition there will be thematic meetings around the country • We may use the “National Virtual Incubator” teleconferencing system to make the London accessible from around the country • Would your institution like to host a physical or virtual gathering?\n\n9. www.pdtn.org #PDT Build digital presence 9 • Our new website: PDTN.org • Will be complimented by a quarterly PDTN Review journal • Covering the Networks activities • Features on members activities • Expert articles\n\n10. www.pdtn.org #PDT Form community interest groups 10 Some will be sector specific “verticals” such as banking and others will be “horizontal” such as security or psychology. By way of illustration, two early groups are: • Privacy Working Group Working to define a “best practice” privacy standard that companies can be certified against • PIMS provider forum Collective challenges and opportunities faced by providers of personal information management services These are the first of many. If there’s a personal data and trust related topic which you feel would benefit from an open working group and would like to establish, please let us know.\n\n11. www.pdtn.org #PDT Create research roadmap 11 • Bring together Industry and the Research Councils to create a research roadmap which drives economic and social growth • Spearheaded by a number of events run by the KTN and the Digital Economy Hubs around the country • SME’s and Corporates will be invited to contribute views and work to identify key challenges • Output will be fed into the Research Councils and IUK to guide future research and calls.\n\n12. www.pdtn.org #PDT Grow membership base 12 • We will grow the network by reaching out to our networks & social media and working with media brands: • We are writing white papers and working with the media to drive interest • We are informing the organisations who have worked with us, IUK, Catapult, KTN, Research Councils and Digital Economy Hubs • We are Posting, Blogging & Tweeting • Your colleagues, customers and collaborators will derive value too... …let them know!\n\n13. www.pdtn.org #PDT Your community, be part of it! 13 • Want to do a blog for the web site • Want to write an article for the PDTN review journal • Got an idea for a “community interest group” • Want to join or lead a group • Want to host an event • Got an idea for the research roadmap Then e-mail us: Matt.Stroud@cde.catapult.org.uk jon.kingsbury@ktn-uk.org"
