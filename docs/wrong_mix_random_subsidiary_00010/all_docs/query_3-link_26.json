Ukrainian Outsourcing Forum 2006, ORGANIZERS 26-27 October, Kyiv, Ukraine ОРГАНИЗАТОРЫ Уважаемые коллеги, От имени оргкомитета форума и Украинской Hi-Tech Инициативы я рад приветствовать участников и гостей Ukrainian Outsourcing Forum `2006. Основной задачей Форума является презентация возможностей украинского рынка аутсорсинговых и оффшорных сервисов, создание площадки для организации B2B встреч между украинскими и зарубежными компаниями и широком обсуждении вопросов развития украинской аутсорсинговой ИТ-индустрии в целом. Отрасль аутсорсинговых ИТ сервисов, разработки программного обеспечения на экспорт и BPO услуг развиваются в Украине высокими темпами. За последние 5 лет рост рынка составлял 25-40% в год, что свидетельствует о большом потенциале отрасли и больших перспективах Украины занять достойное место на мировом рынке интеллектуальных сервисов. Надеюсь, наша совместная работа на Форуме, а также сотрудничество в течение следующего года будет способствовать развитию бизнеса всех компаний и отрасли в целом. Виктор Мазнюк. Президент Украинской Hi-Tech Инициативы Dear Colleagues, On behalf of the organizing committee of the Forum and Ukrainian Hi-Tech Initiative I am happy to welcome the participants and guests of the Ukrainian Outsourcing Forum ‘2006. The main Forum objectives are presentation of Ukrainian outsourcing and offshore services market potential, creation of the platform for B2B meetings between Ukrainian and foreign companies and discussion of development is- sues of Ukrainian outsourcing and IT industry. The Ukrainian industry of IT outsourcing, software development for export and BPO services is rapidly growing. During five recent years the industry growth rate averaged 25-40% annually and this is the evidence of strong potential of Ukraine to occupy a fitting place on the global market of intellectual services. I am full of hopes that our joint work at the Forum as well as collaboration during the next year will contribute to the growth of each separate company and the industry as a whole.
