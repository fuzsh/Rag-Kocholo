Thessaloniki’s urban area spans approximately 30 kilometres (19 miles) from Oraiokastro in the north to Thermi in the south, extending toward Chalkidiki. Mount Chortiatis borders Thessaloniki to the southeast, and its location near mountain ranges, hills, and fault lines has historically made it susceptible to seismic activity.
