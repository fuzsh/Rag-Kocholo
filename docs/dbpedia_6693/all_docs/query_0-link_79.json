        "text": "Our Greek tax professionals are qualified and registered tax experts with over 25 years’ experience advising and assisting non-Greek residents looking to become Greek-residents with their transition and the tax implications and obligations that follow.\n\nAmerican citizens, and citizens from Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom looking to relocate to Greece, or that have been living in Greece and are reaching the 183 non-tax resident deadline are encouraged to speak to a Greek tax professional for non-Greek residents.\n\nBecoming a foreign resident in Greece\n\nOur Greek accounting professionals are experienced at assisting non-Greeks living internationally or in Greece, looking to become residents, or are getting closer to the 183 tax resident deadline.\n\nAccording to Greek legislation, there are several factors involved to be considered a tax resident of Greece, including:\n\nYour permanent home is inside Greece\n\nIf you have lived in Greece for a period longer than 183 days within a twelve-month period (the fiscal year). The 183-day period is tallied in total days residing in Greece during the fiscal year, and not consecutively\n\nFor cases where a client is also considered a tax resident of Greece as well as another country, such instances become highly complex and must be dealt with by an experienced international tax professional to determine the differing double tax treaties Greece has with 56 other countries.\n\nApplying for Greek tax number (AFM or TIN)\n\nGetting a tax number in Greece is necessary for any individual residing in Greece, or persons owning property in Greece. The Greek tax number, or AFN (sometimes called TIN) is obtained through the Greek tax office or Internal Revenue Services in the jurisdiction they live or are purchasing property. The application must be made by an authorised person, including an accountant or lawyer.\n\nOur Greek tax accountants have offices in Athens, Thessaloniki, Crete and every major city, including every local jurisdiction in Greece. Considering the AFN application must be obtained in the local jurisdiction where you will reside or are purchasing property, our expertise and reach across Greece will benefit you wherever you may be situated.\n\nInstances that will require a Greek tax number\n\nThe nine-digit AFN will be required to deal with Greek authorities and completing paperwork, such as:\n\nOpening a new bank account in Greece\n\nStarting employment in Greece\n\nObtaining a Greek driver’s license\n\nPaying tax\n\nUtilities for your home\n\nPurchasing a property or car\n\nObtaining a fishing license\n\nRequired documentation for a Greek AFN\n\nOur expert international tax accountants can assist you to gather the documents needed to apply for a Greek tax number.\n\nAlong with the required application form (M1), the following documents will be required:\n\nA valid passport and photocopy\n\nIf your passport is unavailable, you must provide a birth certificate\n\nDepending on your circumstances, alongside your passport, the following documents may be required:\n\nA valid marriage certificate\n\nBirth certificate\n\nA visa, for applicants from non-EU countries\n\nOnce the appropriate documentation and completed application have been registered, the AFM number will be given immediately.\n\nRegistering for your AMKA number\n\nIn addition to your tax number, it is also often a requirement to register for your AMKA number. Your AMKA is your Greek Social Security Registration Number – and it is for those who work or are insured in Greece. It is issued by KEP (Citizens Service Centres) or through e-EFKA.\n\nOur team can guide you on the requirements and documentation required to get your AMKA number and it’s generally the next item on the list after attaining your AFM. It is also important to note, if you are a Foreign Director of a Greek company you need an AMKA even if you are living overseas.\n\nBeing aware of your residence status in Greece\n\nFor non-Greek citizens living inside Greece or abroad that are planning on relocating to Greece, it is important that you understand the scenarios which determine you a Greek resident or non-Greek resident. Our professional tax accountants can advise you in any major city in Greece, including Athens, Thessaloniki, and Crete. Also, throughout Greece in regional jurisdictions. If you are currently abroad, we can assist you from any country worldwide and have assisting Americans, Britons, Australians, and Canadians with their Greek residence status."
