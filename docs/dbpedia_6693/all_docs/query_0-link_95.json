        "text": "​Are you considering relocating to Greece? We can certainly understand that. Who wouldn't want to have an expat experience in a country like Greece, with its rich history, status as the birthplace of Western democracy, Olympic Games, and theatre? You're not alone if Greece has already captured your heart. Around 1.2 million migrants currently reside and work in Greece, embracing the local culture, taking in the breathtaking coastline, and savoring some regional specialties. However, it would be a good idea to learn how to get your AFM before you pack your bags and head to the airport! Sounds boring, but you get all the help you need here. If you want to live in Greece, obtaining an AFM tax number is the first and most crucial step you must take. We want to explain how to obtain one to you so that nothing can stand in the way of your fresh start.\n\n​\n\nWhat is the AFM and why do you need it?\n\nThe AFM number is the Greek personal Tax Identification Number (TIN). It consists of nine digits and is required for many daily procedures in Greece such as:\n\nBefore beginning employment\n\nEstablishing utility connections\n\nSetting up a bank account\n\nPurchasing a fishing permit.\n\nPurchasing a vehicle, a home, or a boat\n\nEstablishing utility connections\n\nFiling taxes\n\nGetting a new driver's license\n\n​\n\nWho needs to apply for an AFM number?\n\nIf you are a resident in Greece or you own property or want to own property in Greece will need to apply for an AFM (TIN) number\n\nWhere do you need to apply for an AFM number?\n\nA person must physically visit the closest tax office, Eforia, to apply for and obtain a Greek tax number. There is typically no requirement to schedule an appointment, but we advise that you review the list of Greek tax offices and their policies.\n\nTypically, tax offices in Greece are open from 7:30 am to 2:30 pm. But because employees are only required to work for 5.5 hours per day, many tax offices don't open until after 7:30 a.m. and stay open until 1:30 p.m.\n\nYou can Click Here in order to find your local tax office.\n\n​\n\nWhat are the required documents?\n\nTo be able to apply for an AFM number you will need the following documents:\n\nIdentity document, valid passport\n\nProof of address\n\nResidence permit if a non-EU citizen\n\nIn Greece, you can demonstrate your residency in one of the following two ways: by producing a water or electricity bill in your name, or by showing a lease. Alternately, you could complete the declaration form (Ypeuthini Dilosi in Greek) that is available here:\n\nGreek Version\n\nEnglish Version\n\nHow long do you need to wait for your AFM and why?\n\nGetting your AFM Greek tax ID might take longer than a month. Before issuing an AFM, a tax officer must confirm the legitimacy of the supporting documentation.\n\nThe authenticity of the proof of address and the veracity of the information provided will both be verified. This procedure can take some time because it is difficult.\n\nNo tax office in Greece can issue an AFM tax number before confirming the validity of the submitted documents, and this authentication process can take up to a month.\n\n​\n\nHow to access TAXISnet and why?\n\nOnce you have your Greek AFM tax identification number, you also need to get a key number to sign up for and use the TAXISnet online platform. It is important to sign up on TAXISnet because through this platform you can do the following:\n\n• Submit your yearly tax return.\n\n• Print a certificate for your AFM tax number.\n\n• Generate a tax certificate.\n\n• Apply for social benefits (if eligible)\n\nOn your first visit to the TAXISnet platform, you can create a special login and password by entering this key number. In order to connect to the platform, they will be required.\n\nYour TAXISnet username and password should be kept safe because they are required for almost every procedure involving the Greek tax authorities.\n\nThis public platform's main flaw is that it is only available in Greek, making it very challenging to use. Ask for assistance at a KEP location close to you. Both your TAXISnet username and password must be on hand.\n\nOn its website, KEP lists all of its locations.\n\n​\n\nNow that we've cleared up this crucial issue for you, there's really nothing stopping you from living the expat lifestyle of your dreams in the incredible nation of Greece. It is indeed time for you to grab your belongings and take advantage of everything Greece has to offer.\n\n​"
