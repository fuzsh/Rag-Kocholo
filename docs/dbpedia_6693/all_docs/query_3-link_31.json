        "text": "Why transfer my plates?\n\nIf the plates have a special meaning to you and wish to keep them, (e.g., vanity plates)\n\nTransferring your plates will provide you with a full registration period before your next renewal expiration date. This will change your expiration date relative to date of transfer.\n\nTime remaining from your old registration will be used. If your old registration has not expired, you have equity left on that registration that you may use. Equity will depend on how many months you have left. Each month left is equity you may use.\n\nFor example:\n\nRequirements\n\nYou must meet all requirements of a new registration when transferring your plates.\n\nThese plates have been in your family, or you have had these plates for a long time and wish to keep them, or the plate characters have special meaning to you.\n\nThis will provide you with a full registration period before your next renewal expiration date. This will change your expiration date relative to date of transfer.\n\nTime remaining from your old registration will be used. If your old registration has not expired, you have equity left on that registration that you may use. Equity will depend on how many months you have left. Each month left is equity you may use.\n\nImportant notice on passport to the parks fee\n\nConnecticut offers all residents with Connecticut license plates on their vehicles free parking at all state parks and beaches. Connecticut wants to make state parks, forests, trails, historic sites, and beaches more available to our residents so they can enjoy the many attractions and beauty they offer.\n\nA $15 fee, which amounts to $5 per year, will be included in all three-year non-commercial vehicles with new registrations, renewals and plate transfers. These are passenger cars and vehicles with combination plates as well as motorcycles, campers/motor homes and vehicles with antique car plates.\n\nIn addition, seniors 65 years old and older with a one-year registration renewal will have only an additional $5 fee each year.\n\nThe new program allows the state of Connecticut to give more to the public that has now invested in our park system: Increased lifeguards, improved park maintenance, shoulder season camping for opening day of fishing and into the fall foliage, and longer hours at our museums and nature centers. When people visit our state parks and other sites they visit local restaurants, shops, and local farms. This program brings many economic benefits for our state.\n\nLearn more about Connecticut state parks."
