All those letters have, of course, a meaning. Not only we will cover all the European number plate codes and letters. But also, find out about the visual aspect of all those car plates. With this resource, identifying all European number plates will be as easy as 1, 2,3 when driving in France!\n\nHow to read European number plate codes?\n\nOn some car plates, flags can help us identify the country of origin of a vehicle. But it’s far from always being the case! Indeed, EU license plates display the EC stars. In that case, we must rely on European number plate letters to understand where a car is registered. Here is the full list of the car plates codes in the European union:\n\nA: Austria\n\nB: Belgium\n\nBG : Bulgaria\n\nCY : Cyprus\n\nCZ: Czech Republic\n\nD: Germany (Deutschland)\n\nDK: Denmark number plate\n\nE: Spain\n\nEST: Estonia\n\nF: France\n\nFIN: Finland\n\nGB: Great Britain (prior Brexit, now UK)\n\nGR: Greece\n\nH: Hungary\n\nHR: Croatia (Hrvatska)\n\nI: Italy\n\nIRL: Ireland\n\nL: Luxembourg\n\nLT: Lithuania\n\nLV: Latvia\n\nM : Malta\n\nNL: Netherlands ou Nederland\n\nP : Portugal\n\nPL: Poland\n\nRO: Romania\n\nS: Sweden\n\nSK: Slovakia\n\nSLO: Slovenia\n\nEuropean car number plate country codes (outside UE)\n\nHere are now all the missing European car license plate codes related to non EU countries that are part of the geographical Europe:\n\nAL: Albania\n\nAM: Armenia\n\nAZ: Azerbaijan\n\nAND: Andorra\n\nBIH: Bosnia and Herzegovina\n\nBY: Belarus\n\nFO: Faroe Islands\n\nGEO: Georgia\n\nFL: Liechtenstein\n\nMC: Monaco\n\nMD: Moldova\n\nMNE: Montenegro\n\nN: Norway\n\nNMK: North Macedonia\n\nTR: Turkey\n\nIS: Iceland\n\nCH: Switzerland\n\nRKS: Kosovo\n\nRSM: San Marino\n\nRUS: Russia\n\nSRB : Serbia\n\nUA: Ukraine\n\nUK: license plate from the United Kingdom\n\nCharacteristics of European license plates, how do they look like?\n\nFrom the Portugal plate to Kazakhstan via Andorra, Iceland, Lithuania or Hungary, we can see how they look like thanks to the map above. This particularly concise overview allows to draw lessons regarding the appearance of number plates in Europe. As we can see, white backgrounds largely predominate. Some countries and territories use yellow plates, including Great Britain, Luxembourg or Gibraltar. Black is rare, it is used by the Channel Islands and Liechtenstein (white characters).\n\nEuropean Union plates largely follow the French model, if we ignore the French right stripe that is shared with Italy:\n\nLeft stripe: blue with the EU stars + European number plate country code (see liste above)\n\nPlate number\n\nA territorial identifier sometimes separates the registration number (Croatia, Austria…), sometimes it is placed on the far right, as for the registration plate of France or Italy. It is noteworthy to mention that the blue “euroband” is compulsory on the left for the countries of the European Union. Some countries, apparently eager to join the Union, have already added it, for example Serbia.\n\nHow much is petrol in France?\n\nNumber plates for motorcycles\n\nAmong the atypical plates, we note the Belgian license plate, which sports a red edge and red characters. The country is the only one to use red in Europe. Blue is used by 3 territories: Aland (autonomous Finnish archipelago), Monaco and San Marino.\n\nThe design of those plates can be altered in case of special series. For example, official number plates or personalised license plate.\n\nThe shortest and longest license plates in Europe\n\nAs far as the number plate with the shortest number is concerned, Monaco wins the competition with a 4-character code. This is better than the Vatican, whose plates are made up of at least 7 characters (CV + 5 digits for individuals). The longest car number plates are from Ireland (9 characters).\n\nFAQ European number plate codes\n\nWhat is an MK European number plate?\n\nMK was the Makedonia code. Since the renaming of the country to North Makedonia, the code is now NMK.\n\nWhat European number plate is E?\n\nSpain.\n\nHow to perform a European number plate check?\n\nThere is no integrated system to check a number plate at European level at this point. One should check the available tools and resources in the country of origin to check a car by number plate.\n\nWhat European country has yellow license plates?\n\nUK, Luxembourg, Netherlands and small British Overseas Territories, such as Gibraltar have yellow number plates as standard colour.\n\nHow do European license plates work?\n\nThere is no European license plates as such. Each country has its own system. They just shared some layout similarities, such as the size and the presence of a blue strip on the left side.\n\nWhat is B on a European number plate?\n\nIt means the vehicle is registered in Belgium.\n\nCY European number plate?\n\nIt means Cyprus.\n\nD on European number plate?\n\nIt is a German license plate.\n\nHR European number plate?\n\nThe country related to HR is Croatia.\n\nS European license plate?\n\nS is for Sweden.\n\nTR European number plate\n\nTR is Turkey or Türkiye.\n\nA European license plate?\n\nA is for Austria.\n\nSommaire\n\nHow to read European number plate codes?\n\nEuropean car number plate country codes (outside UE)\n\nCharacteristics of European license plates, how do they look like?\n\nThe shortest and longest license plates in Europe\n\nFAQ European number plate codes"
