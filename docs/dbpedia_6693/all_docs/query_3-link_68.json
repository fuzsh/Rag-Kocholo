        "text": "If you are registered or should have been registered in the Dutch Personal Records Database (BRP) you must not drive a car with foreign registration plates in the Netherlands. You must make sure you are registered in the BRP if you will be staying in the Netherlands for longer than 4 months.\n\nThe fact that you cannot drive a car with foreign registration plates in the Netherlands has to do with the Dutch Road Traffic Act. This law regulates, among other things, road safety and which vehicles are and are not allowed to drive on public roads.\n\nTo use your car with foreign registration plates in the Netherlands, you must register it in the Netherlands’ vehicle registration database. You must also pay the relevant Dutch taxes. This is known as ‘importing’ your vehicle. You should arrange this through the Netherlands Vehicle Authority (RDW). Your car will be issued with Dutch registration plates.\n\nSee the step-by-step plan for importing a car\n\nExceptions\n\nYou can drive a car with foreign registration plates on Dutch roads in the following circumstances:\n\nYou have been granted a short-term use exemption from car and motorcycle tax (BPM) and motor vehicle tax (MRB). This allows you to drive a car with foreign registration plates for no more than 2 weeks on Dutch roads. For example because you rented a car abroad due to a breakdown with your own car.\n\nYou have been granted an employee exemption to drive a car belonging to your employer, who is based abroad.\n\nYou have been granted an employer's exemption to drive a car belonging to your own business, which is based abroad.\n\nIn these situations, you do not need to pay car and motorcycle tax (BPM) and motor vehicle tax (MRB). MRB is also known as road tax. You must apply to the Tax Administration for an exemption, however.\n\nRead more about applying for exemptions from vehicle taxes (Tax Administration)\n\nIf you are not registered in the Dutch Personal Records Database (BRP), you can drive a car with foreign registration plates on Dutch roads for a maximum of 6 months. This is because you are entitled to an exemption under international law (information in Dutch). You do not need to apply for this exemption.\n\nIf you use your car to transport goods or people for payment, the time period is reduced to 3 months. The 3 months do not need to be consecutive.\n\nDriving your car for more than 6 months\n\nIf you wish to drive your vehicle in the Netherlands for more than 6 months, you will need to pay taxes. You can arrange this by submitting a car and motorcycle tax (BPM) return. If you are coming from outside the European Union (EU) you will also need to submit a Customs declaration.\n\nRead more about submitting a BPM return (Tax Administration) (information in Dutch)\n\nFind out how to submit a Customs declaration\n\nIf you are coming to study or take up an internship in the Netherlands and bringing your car with you, you can drive it on Dutch roads straight away. This is due to an exemption under international law (information in Dutch). You do not need to apply for this exemption. You can use your car for the duration of your course. You do not need to pay any Dutch taxes to use your car. You must be enrolled on a recognised course. If you are unsure, ask your school or university whether your course is recognised.\n\nIf you will be working while studying, you must register your car in the Netherlands’ vehicle registration database. You must also pay the relevant Dutch taxes. This is known as ‘importing’ your car. You should arrange this through the Netherlands Vehicle Authority (RDW). Your car will be issued with Dutch registration plates.\n\nSee the step-by-step plan for importing a car\n\nIf you are being seconded to the Netherlands temporarily by your employer, and want to use your car here to travel to and from work, you can. You can do this even though your car has foreign registration plates. This is due to an exemption under international law (information in Dutch). You do not need to apply for this exemption. You can use your car for the entire duration of your secondment. You do not need to pay any related Dutch taxes."
