This strict decision was taken because of many people taking advantage of the low cost of such number plates and using them for their every day and not so ‘classic’ vehicles. Owners were waiting for ages for a new more fair decision till a new one was published some weeks ago.\n\nThe new ministerial decision pauses all classic car events for cars made after 1969 (the majority of classics taking part in events) in order to reinspect them. Now, classics with special classic car number plates or even the ones with standard registration plates can’t participate, with the first ones not being able to move till they get checked. This inspection will probably take months to finish since such procedures in Greece take too long. We all hope that this decision is going to change soon.\n\nThe good news is that some clubs already organise events and I came across a classic car convoy the other day. They might have found a loophole since such a decision goes against international ones."
