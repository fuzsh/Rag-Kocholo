        "text": "A lot of different rumors and legends about driving in Greece have been in the air for a long time, and the Greek drivers have acquired a reputation as inveterate road slobs. Of course, rumors do not appear from nowhere. But, in fact, not everything is worth believing, and some car myths need to be refuted. If you decided to rent a car in Greece, you'll find a lot of useful information in our article.\n\nDriving in Greece Requirements\n\nAge\n\nTo legally drive in Greece, the driver must be at least 18 years old. However, it’s worth noting that many car rental companies impose their own age restrictions, typically requiring drivers to be at least 21, and often charging an additional fee for drivers under 25.\n\nLicences\n\nA valid driving licence is mandatory for anyone operating a vehicle in Greece. Greek authorities accept driving licences issued by EU member states. For drivers from non-EU countries, an International Driving Permit (IDP) is required in addition to their national driving licence.\n\nDriving Side\n\nIn Greece, traffic operates on the right-hand side of the road, which is standard across continental Europe. This means that the driver's seat and controls are on the left side of the vehicle. Drivers should be particularly vigilant when overtaking and at intersections, ensuring they stay on the correct side of the road.\n\nRoundabouts\n\nAt roundabouts in Greece, drivers should give way to traffic already on the roundabout, which is coming from their left. The vehicles inside the roundabout have the right of way, contrasting with some countries where entering traffic has priority. It’s crucial to indicate your intended exit from the roundabout to inform other drivers.\n\nDriving in Greece for Foreigners\n\nDriving in Greece with UK Licence\n\nUK drivers can use their driving licence in Greece for short visits or holidays without requiring an IDP. For longer stays or residency, it’s advisable to check the latest requirements due to changes in regulations post-Brexit.\n\nDriving in Greece as an American\n\nAmerican drivers are required to have an International Driving Permit along with their valid US driving licence to drive legally in Greece. The IDP serves as a translation of your national licence and is a requirement enforced by car rental companies and traffic authorities alike. It is essential to obtain your IDP before leaving the US as they are not issued outside the country.\n\nThe State of Greek Roads\n\nGreek roads are generally in good condition, making driving in Greece safe and pleasurable.\n\nDrivers tend to be courteous, though there might be occasional exceptions.\n\nIn quaint mountain towns, be prepared for one-way streets and congested, narrow roads.\n\nMountainous areas feature long, winding roads; it’s advisable to use engine braking rather than relying solely on brakes.\n\nMotorway rest areas are signposted with a \"P\" for parking.\n\nIn rural regions, signs might be placed directly at turns or sometimes not present at all.\n\nBe cautious: road signs might be small, unclear, or vandalised.\n\nOftentimes, the road shoulder becomes an additional lane for overtaking or slow-moving traffic.\n\nMany petrol stations shut between 7-10 p.m.\n\nIn cities, keep an eye out for unpredictable motorcycles, mopeds, and bicycles.\n\nBrief double-parking is generally tolerated, provided you don't obstruct traffic.\n\nTraffic Rules Unique to Greece\n\nGreece observes European traffic regulations, but with some local nuances.\n\nSpeed limits: 50 km/h in cities, 90 km/h outside city bounds, 130 km/h on highways, and 110 km/h on designated motorways.\n\nSpeed cameras are accurate and do not allow for overspeeding. Stay within limits!\n\nLocal drivers might seem to disregard numerous speed limit signs, but hefty fines are imposed on those caught speeding.\n\nSignage might not always be in English, but it is generally intuitive.\n\nRoundabouts: Typically, vehicles entering have the right of way, but always check for priority signs.\n\nSome traffic lights feature yellow arrows, indicating a right turn even when the main light is red. Yield to those with a green signal.\n\nFlashing headlights by oncoming cars could indicate a road hazard. If a car behind you flashes, they're requesting to overtake.\n\nEnsure no one's jumping a red light before you move on to green.\n\nPenalties for Traffic Violations\n\nDriving in Greece demands adherence to rules. Fines have been on the rise:\n\nViolation Penalties\n\nDrink & Driving in Greece\n\nGreece enforces stringent drink-driving laws. Permitted alcohol limit is up to 0.5 ppm:\n\nAlcohol limit Penalties 0.5 to 0.8 ppm €200 0.8 to 1.1 ppm €700 Above 1.1 ppm €1,200, potential driving disqualification, and possible 2-month arrest\n\nSettling Fines\n\nNever try to bribe! Pay fines at banks or post offices using the issued ticket. Previously, early payments had discounts, but as of 2018, full fines are imposed.\n\nInteracting with Greek Traffic Police\n\nGenerally, police are helpful to tourists. Rural officers might be more lenient, while city officers are stricter due to heavier workloads.\n\nHelpful Resources for drivers in Greece\n\nEmergency numbers to remember:\n\nEmergency Phone Number Emergency services 112 Rescue service 171 Tourist police 100 General police 166 Ambulance 199 Fire brigade\n\nFor driving in Greece, these apps can be beneficial:\n\nWaze: Features real-time traffic updates and police patrol alerts.\n\nGoogle Maps: Comprehensive and detailed maps of Greece.\n\nMapsMe: Offline maps for those venturing to remote areas.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the right information and a cautious approach, driving in Greece is a pleasant experience. The Greek hospitality makes it even more memorable, cementing Greece's reputation as one of Europe’s top destinations.\n\nFAQ for Driving in Greece\n\n1.
