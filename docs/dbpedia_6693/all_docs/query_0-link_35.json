        "text": "Guide to driving in Greece\n\nThe basic rules to keep in mind when driving in Greece are vital for personal and public safety. In Greece you drive on the right hand side of the road with the vehicles steering wheel on the left side of the car or van rental.\n\nFollow the Speed Limit in Greece\n\nFollowing speed limits and basic traffic regulations is important while travelling throughout Greece. The speed limit in Greece is approximately 50 km/h (31 mph) inside the Athens city and residential areas, 80 - 90 km/h (50 - 56 mph) outside of Athens, towns and on small Highway and open roads and 100-120 kilometers (62 to 75 mph) on the major Highways throughout Greece. This is just a guide line as you should be aware of the speed limit from the signs located on the road you are travelling on. The speed limit varies so be aware while driving. The Greek Traffic Police monitor the speed limit at various undisclosed areas with laser technology, while in other areas of Greece cameras monitor the speed. The city of Athens is monitored by all means. If you are pulled over for exceeding the Greek speed limit the fines are as follows. Up to 20 km/h above the speed limit the fine is 40 Euro, 20 to 30 km/h above the speed limit the fines is 100 Euro, 30+ km/h above the speed limit the fine is 350 Euro and the driver’s license revoked for 60 days, 150+ km/h on motorways the fines is 350 Euro and the driver’s license revoked for 60 days, 130+ km/h on high speed roads the fine is 350 Euro and the driver’s license revoked for 60 days and last 120+ km/h on other roads the fine is 350 Euro and the driver’s license revoked for 60 days. And for those wondering if it is a good idea to use a speed camera detector the fines is 2,000 Euro, the driver’s license is revoked for 30 days and the vehicles number plate license confiscated by the Greek Traffic police for 60 days.\n\nSafety Seat belts and baby seats\n\nThe use of seatbelts for the driver and all passengers including babies and children is compulsory. We strongly advise all passengers travelling in a vehicle to wear a seat belt. Children and babies need to be properly restrained in baby seats, booster seats and seatbelts to insure their safety. Children aged 10 or under may not sit in the front seat. With today’s safety technology in modern cars, the safety features of an airbag are effective only when the driver and the passengers use their seatbelts. The Greek Traffic Police closely monitor the use of seatbelts. Don't be your own worst enemy... buckle up! The fine for the driver and passengers not wearing the car or van seat belt is 350 Euro and the driver’s license revoked for 10 days.\n\nDon't Drink & Drive\n\nBe careful not to drive while intoxicated or under the influence of a controlled substance. The legal blood alcohol limit in Greece is 0.5 percent. For drivers who have their driver’s license for less than 24 months the limit is 0.2 percent. If you are above this you will pay a fine. If your blood alcohol content is over 0.08 percent it is a criminal offence and in most cases the driver will be detained. The alcohol level is monitored with breath tests carried out at random road stops. The fine for drinking and driving while under the influence of alcohol is (0.25 to 0.40 mg/l tested by means of a breathalyzer or 0.50 to 0.80 g/l by means of a blood test) is 200 Euro, for (0.40 to 0.60 mg/l with breathalyzer test or 0.80 to 1.10 g/l with blood test) is 700 Euro and 90 days revocation of the drivers licensee and last for (above 0.60 mg/l with breathalyzer test or above 1.10 g/l with blood test) the fine is 1,200 Euro, 180 days revocation of the drivers licensee and a minimum two months imprisonment.\n\nPark Only where it's Permitted\n\nPark only in designated parking areas and where it is permitted. Valet parking is available in several Athens locations. Flashing the vehicles hazard lights indicates your intent to park. Parking in a prohibited area will result in the Greek Traffic Police parking fine and possible license plate confiscation or even towing of the car rental to the impound. Also park where the rent a car is safe and does not block the traffic. Parking the car rental is not allowed within 3 meters of a fire hydrant, 5 meters of an intersection, or 15 meters of a bus stop. The fine for parking illegally is 80 Euro and the vehicles number plate license confiscated by the Greek Traffic police for 20 days. If you incur a parking violation and the car rentals license number plates are removed you must contact ACE Rent a Car Athens Greece. Driving without number plates is a serious offence and a high fine. Simple fines may be paid at the local Post Office and if you decide to pay the fine within 10 days of issue, the due amount will be half.\n\nParking in downtown central Athens\n\nThe downtown city of Athens has a specific parking system in place. Spaces marked in blue are for short-term visitors and spaces marked in yellow are for commercial use only. Short-term visitors can use the blue spaces from 09:00 to 21:00 on weekdays, and from 09:00 to 16:00 on the weekends. The pay-and-display parking system in central Athens requires you to purchase a scratch card allowing you to park in specially designed spots in the city center. Parking tickets are necessary for the use of blue short-stay spaces, and can be bought at newsstands, Kiosk and other small shops. Tickets are valid for up to three hours, and any fines incurred will be halved if paid within ten days. Central Athens area restricts car access via the odd-even license plate rule to reduce congestion, but these restrictions do not apply to rental cars.\n\nDo not store luggage or valuables in your vehicle\n\nIf you must leave your valuables in the rental car or van make sure they are out of sight and not visible when you leave the car unattended. It is best to plan ahead and place the valuables in the trunk or glove box compartment before you start your travels. Also store power cords, GPS navigation unit or mobile phone chargers, mounting accessories, devices and valuables. If your GPS charger is visible to a petty thief, he will assume the GPS unit itself is also in the car rental. It is not uncommon, in any major city, to have your visible valuables stolen while the car rental is parked or at a traffic light\n\nChoosing the right rental for your travels\n\nWhen selecting a car or van rental category determine with the help of vehicle pictures and description if the overall space you will need is ample to travel safely and with comfort. Also check to see if there is adequate luggage space.
