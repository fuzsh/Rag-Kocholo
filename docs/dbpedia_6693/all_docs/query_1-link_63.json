        "text": "Health insurance\n\nLast updated: 5/13/2024\n\n*The following process also applies to Ukrainian nationals that have been rejected and haven’t obtained the Temporary Protection status.\n\nHealth care is generally free for people who live legally in Greece. For people who are undocumented and they don't have Social Security numbers in case of a medical emergency, they can address hospitals that are on duty to receive medical care and treatment.\n\nYou need a Social Security number (PAAYPA or ΑΜΚΑ) in order:\n\nto have access to healthcare\n\nto work\n\nto get insurance for yourself and your family\n\nto have access to pension and any kind of benefits\n\nImportant! If AMKA is inactive, you can access social insurance, payment of contributions, and electronic prescription of medicines, but you will not have free access to public health care facilities. For more information, please check below the new procedure for issuing and activating your AMKA,\n\nBenefits that you have as a result of the National Insurance:\n\nAccess to private doctors who are associated with the National Insurance System (EOPYY). There is an online list of medical specialities in detail on the EOPY webpage.\n\n75% coverage of medical check-ups at private diagnostics centres.\n\nPartial coverage at medical pair of eyeglasses.\n\nPartial coverage at Physiotherapy Sessions, at Occupational Therapy Sessions and Speech Therapy Sessions.\n\nIn Greece, asylum seekers obtain a specific number named PAAYPA (Provisional Social Security and Health Care Number) indicated on their asylum card that provides access at Hospitals, Primary Medical Care (P.E.D.Y.), Health Centers, Local Health Units (T.O.M.Y.), at free medical check-ups and medicine.\n\nOnce an asylum seeker has been officially recognized as a refugee or granted subsidiary protection, he/she can acquire a permanent Social Security Number (A.M.K.A.) from the administrative services of E.F.K.A (Ε.Φ.Κ.Α), that gives him/her access to the same above-mentioned medical provisions.\n\nDifferences between PAAYPA and ΑΜΚA\n\nSince January 2020, asylum seekers can only get a “Provisional Social Security and Health Care Number” (in Greek, «Προσωρινός Αριθμός Ασφάλισης και Υγειονομικής Περίθαλψης Αλλοδαπού/ Prosorinos arithmos Asfalisis kai Igionomikis Perithalpsis / ΠΑΑΥΠΑ»), while refugees are entitled to get a permanent social security number (still called “AMKA”»).\n\nUkranian Nationals who have obtained the Temporary Protection status can use the AMKA number noted on the Temporary Protection card.\n\nWhen and how can you get a PAAYPA\n\nIf you apply for international protection in Greece now, the Asylum Service will provide you with a Full Registration Card, on which PAAYPA is indicated. As long as you remain a full registration card holder, PAAYPA remains valid, giving you free access to health care.\n\nIf you have applied for international protection before January 2020 and are still an asylum seeker, you will get a PAAYPA number next time you renew your full registration card.\n\nIf you already have an AMKA and are still an asylum seeker, AMKA will automatically turn into PAAYPA. This will be indicated on your registration card the next time you renew it.\n\nYou can access the electronic platform of IDIKA and check if you have PAAYPA (Provisional Social Security and Health Care Number -PAAYPA), without the need to visit the offices.\n\nWhen and how can you get an ΑΜΚΑ?\n\nIf you are granted refugee status or subsidiary protection, PAAYPA will be deactivated and turned to AMKA one month after obtaining your residence permit. For that reason, you must apply to the competent AMKA service (e-EFKA office or KEP) within one (1) month from reception of your residence permit to change your Temporary Insurance and Health Care Number (PAAYPA) to AMKA (a permanent social security number).\n\nFor Ukrainian Nationals who have obtained Temporary Protection status, the process is as follows: You will receive the AMKA immediately once you get your Temporary Protection card. Your AMKA will normally be activated with no action needed from your side, but in case you face any difficulties and your AMKA has not been activated, you will need to visit a KEP office (Citizen Service Center).\n\nIssuing and activation of AMKA (New procedure)\n\nStarting from April 1st 2024, a significant change has been implemented in the process of issuing and activating AMKA. With this new system, there are two different procedures for issuing and activating AMKA.\n\nThis means that AMKA is issued deactivated and subsequently activated from now on, provided that the beneficiary submits the required documents to the competent AMKA service. So, after its issuance, AMKA can be active, inactive or dormant (only in case of death), depending on the actual legal status of its holder, whether the holder has access to labor market and can prove the actual residence in Greece.\n\nMore specifically, legal residence in Greece and access to labor market are necessary for the issuance of AMKA, and in addition, proof of actual residence (e.g. house contract, studies, work etc) in Greece is necessary for its activation and for one person to enjoy the full rights deriving from it.\n\nAMKA is issued when a person can prove that they reside legally in the country and have access to the labor market.\n\nAMKA is subsequently activated when the holder submits the required documents proving their actual residence in the country.\n\nAMKA is deactivated if any of the following requirements are no longer met: a. legal residence, b. access to labor market, c. actual residence in the country. Once deactivated, AMKA can be reactivated when the necessary documents are submitted. When a person applies for the reactivation of AMKA, they must submit the required documents to any branch of EFKA or KEP within one month of lodging the application.\n\nAMKA is permanently deactivated (dormant) if its holder dies.\n\nWhen AMKA is inactive, it allows its holders to have access to social insurance, contribution payment, and electronic medicine prescriptions, but it does not give them the right to free access to public healthcare facilities.\n\nDocuments required\n\nIssuance\n\nValid passport or travel document\n\nValid residence permit (ADET, temporary protection residence permit)\n\nActivation\n\nYou will need proof of\n\nactual residence in Greece\n\na proof of work or studies\n\nParticularly, for the proof of actual residence, you must submit one of the following documents\n\nProof of tax residence in Greece (AADE)\n\nHouse contract (AADE)\n\nDeclaration of a hosting person (AADE)\n\nProof of ownership of a house (AADE)\n\nCertificate of employment issued by your employer (solemn declaration, officially certified online or at any KEP)\n\nEmployment contract (ERGANI)\n\nBusiness commencement certificate (AADE)\n\nCertificate of residence in a student’s residence\n\nCertificate of studies\n\nCertificate from the dormitory or social service of the municipality or the Community Centre, in case you are homeless\n\nCertificate of detention if you are in prison\n\nCertificate of residence under the housing programme for asylum applicants\n\nWhile for the proof of work or studies, you can provide one of the following:\n\nCertificate of employment issued by your employer (solemn declaration, officially certified online or at any KEP)\n\nEmployment contract (ERGANI)\n\nBusiness commencement certificate (AADE)\n\nCertificate of studies in Greece\n\nWhat if I already have an active AMKA?\n\nRI contacted the Ministry of Labour and Social Insurance, and we were informed that controls will be performed at a later stage to verify whether AMKA beneficiaries meet the requirements to have an active AMKA. For that purpose, a deadline will be set for them to submit the abovementioned documents. We will keep you updated as soon as there are official guidelines on the matter.\n\nCan I get an AMKA for my children and other family members?\n\nYes. To get an AMKA for your children, bring:\n\nTheir Residence Permit\n\nAll other documents they have\n\nYou can get an adult relative an AMKA, bringing with you:\n\nHis or her Residence Permit\n\nAll the other documents he or she may have\n\nFamily status certificate or other document proving the family tie\n\nAn official letter in Greek, signed by your adult relative and officially stamped in a KEP office, authorizing you to represent him or her at a KEP office, specifically to get him or her an AMKA. Find an editable sample of this letter here. Find an English translation of the letter here.\n\nI am under 18, without a parent in Greece. Can I get an AMKA?\n\nYes, you can go to a KEP office and get an AMKA. Bring with you either:\n\nYour Residence Permit\n\nYou are not obliged to submit proof of your residence, unless you live in a shelter or accommodation facility. In that case, you can issue AMKA even if you do not have a residence permit, provided that you do not have PAYPPA already or you will not get a PAYPPA soon with the full registration of your asylum application. You will need to bring a Certificate of residence in the shelter or accommodation facility and\n\nCertificate of registration with the National Registry of unaccompanied minors\n\nAsk your guardian or a social worker to accompany you. An adult who is responsible for you should be with you at a KEP office, but his or her AMKA won't be linked with yours.\n\nGetting a National Insurance Νumber (ΑΜΑ Number) by EFKA\n\nAll people who live legally in Greece and have the right to work in Greece, after they get a job offer, they need to get AMA Number (National Insurance Number). Your employer needs AMA Number to complete the hiring. After that, you will be able to have a work contract, and your employer will be able to make National Insurance contributions for you.\n\nTo get an AMA Number, you need to go in person to the EFKA office closest to where you live, depending on your address Visit the Registry Department (“Μητρώο Ασφαλισμένων”). You do not need an appointment. You can find a list of EFKA offices (in Greek) here.\n\nYou should have with you:\n\nYour Registration card or your residence permit (and passport, if you have one)\n\nA copy of your AMKA document\n\nYour AFM (tax number)\n\nYour employer’s letter for a job offer («βεβαίωση πρόσληψης»)\n\nProof of address (this is needed for the EFKA officer to check if you have gone to the competent EFKA office)\n\nYour IBAN (optional)\n\nTell the officer that you have a job offer and want to register.\n\nAfter 5 months of employment, you can have access to the National Insurance System, which enables you to have even more benefits in Health Care.\n\nMental health services in Greece\n\nSome organisations in Greece want to help you if you are experiencing stress, worry, sadness, loneliness, anger, or depression, all feelings of being upset or annoyed due to being unable to change or achieve something.\n\nIf you need psychiatric medication, try to get PAAYPA or a Greek social security number (AMKA), then visit a doctor. If you can’t get a PAAYPA or an AMKA number, under current Greek policy, you can still get psychiatric medication for free. In Greece, psychiatric medications are a special category called “psychiatric and neurological medications.” This category has special rules. If you need psychiatric and neurological medications, you need a prescription signed by a psychiatrist or neurologist working at Hospitals, Primary Medical Care (P.E.D.Y.) or Local Health Units (T.O.M.Y.).\n\nYou can use the prescription at pharmacies inside a Greek public hospital.\n\nLearn how to get your children's school vaccinations\n\nFind here health services in your area on the map"
