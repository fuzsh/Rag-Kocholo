        "text": "Kim - Port Republic, New Jersey\n\nJust a quick note to thank you for the BEAUTIFUL license plate frame. It is extremely well made and far surpassed my expectations. You have an exceptional product! I have already realized a gain in my business (LaPalmaDance.com) and have new dance students coming each week!Thank you!SincerelyKim A.\n\nMichael G - Clifton, New Jersey\n\nJust wanted to write to say that my plate frame was delivered last week and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. The product is EXACTLY what I was hoping for. The quality is excellent and I couldn't have picked a better type for the letters. I am very happy I stumbled across your site and I thank you for quickly answering my questions. I will gladly recommend your site and products in the future.\n\nDavid -\n\nI ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY LOVE THIS PLATE. IT LOOKS FANTASTIC ON MY CAR. MANY THANKS FOR A GREAT JOB.\n\nTom - Kalamazoo. Michigan\n\nAfter the purchase of my Alpina, I noticed that the car was different from all her BMW E38 siblings in North America by having the European trunk lid on it, preventing me from using a US format license plate.I decided, upon reviewing Licenseplates.tv's reputation to use their product on my car and it is absolutely gorgeous. Very clear print on the blue bar, great reflective pain and nicely done lettering.I am definitely most satisfied with my purchase and recommend Licenseplates.tv to anyone wanting a authentically reproduced quality product!\n\nElaine - HOLLAND, Ohio\n\nI LUV IT!!- Elaine N.\n\nCharles Tupper\n\nI just got my 4th plate from you today and I continue to be amazed by the quality of the product. Right down to the proper size and no-hole orientation of the 55 NY plate (I only learned that by going back and visiting the site). Thanks so much. You've helped to make several old cars of mine, my brother's and my best friend even more period-authentic. Great product and well worth the expense for something done with such a high level of quality! I guess that might be silly, since the originals were made by state prisoners ... but that's another story!!!\n\nJohn - North Canton, Ohio\n\nI just wanted to take a moment to thank you for the extra effort in duplicating my original Italian license plate for my 1957 Abarth 750 GT Corsa. I thought I would send along a couple of pictures so you could see the end result. I am a very happy repeat customer and have referred many of my colleagues to your company.John\n\nMax B - St. Pete, FL\n\nMy wife ordered this plate for me for Xmas. Just wanted to say \"thanks\" for a great product. Happy New Year\n\nNelson - Palm City, Florida\n\nThis is my 4th order from your company. I appreciate the quality and the efficient service. Thanks!\n\nJason - Columbus, Ohio\n\nI got your plates today. Wow, they are fantastic! They look very professionally done and the color matches perfectly. I couldn't ask for any better. It was done exactly as I had drawn it up. Hats off to you.If you twisted my arm and forced me to say anything less than \"perfection\" I'd say I wouldn't mind if the metal were twice () as thick. It does seem a bit thinner than what I had expected.These custom plates rock! Thanks a bunch. :)Jason"
