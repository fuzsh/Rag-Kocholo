It is one of the most northerly islands in the Dodecanese and lies just off the west coast of Turkey. Patmos' capital is the town of Chora and its port is in the town of Skala. The island, which is also known as the \"island of the Apocalypse\" is popular with tourists from around the world. However, there is more to the island than this. It is a pretty island with traditional whitewashed houses, crystal clear waters, excellent food and a thriving nightlife.\n\nThe Cave of the Apocalypse, a major visitor attraction, is reputedly to have been the cave where Saint Ioannis heard the voice of God and wrote the Apocalypse. In the cave, visitors can see the cross engraved by Saint Ioannis along with three small cracks on the rock through which the voice of God came, symbolising the Holy Trinity.\n\nPatmos is connected by ferry to Piraeus, the other islands of the Dodecanese, and also with other islands of the Aegean Sea, like Samos and Ikaria. The ferry from Piraeus takes about 7 hours to reach the port of Patmos. The journey to the nearby islands of the Dodecanese take about 1-1.5 hours, while the trips from Ikaria or Samos take a little longer.\n\nChios Guide\n\nThe Greek island of Chios lies in the north east Aegean Sea and is located close to the coast of Turkey and is opposite the Erithrea Peninsular, from which it is separated by the Chios Strait. The island has a land area of around 840 sq. km and a population of roughly 54,000 people. The island's capital city is also called Chios and is home to approximately half of the island's population. Popular visitor attractions on the island include the Byzantine Museum which is located in a former Ottoman mosque and is where you can see a perfect copy of the famous painting \"Massacre at Chios\" by Delacroix. Also on the island is the famous library named after Adamantios Korais and contains his personal collection of 1,300 historical volumes and the Naval Museum where you can see replicas of sailing ships and steam boats.\n\nAlternatively, take a stroll through the pretty and narrow streets of Kaloplitis and take in the splendour of the former ship owners' mansions that stretch all the way to Tampakika. Here you will find Ioustiniani Palace and the mills that once belonged to the old tanneries.\n\nFrom Chios, ferry services operate to Piraeus, Thessaloniki, Kavala, Rhodes, Samos, Lemnos, Mytilene, Oinousses, Psara, and Cesme."
