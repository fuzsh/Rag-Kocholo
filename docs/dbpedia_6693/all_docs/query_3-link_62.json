        "text": "Number plates identify where a vehicle is registered and who the registered operator is.\n\nNew number plates are issued when you register your vehicle for the first time. Number plate fees depend on the type of vehicle and registration.\n\nFor heavy vehicles, check national heavy vehicle number plate fees.\n\nNumber plates remain the property of Transport for NSW. We have the authority to issue, decline to issue, renew or withdraw number plates.\n\nIf your registration has been cancelled for any reason, it is an offence to keep the number plates.\n\nWhen selling a vehicle\n\nIf you're selling your vehicle and you want to keep your personal plates, you can reserve your plates and replace them with general number plates, or, you can exchange them with another vehicle registered in your name.\n\nYou need to:\n\ntake your number plates and proof of your identity to a service centre\n\npay the annual reserve fee, or, pay the exchange fee plus any yearly fees that apply.\n\nWhen registration expires\n\nIf your registration has expired and it's been less than 3 months since the expiry date, you can reserve your number plates. You need to:\n\ntake your number plates and proof of identity to a service centre\n\npay the annual reserve fee, or, pay the exchange fee plus any yearly fees that apply.\n\nExpired for more than 3 months\n\nIf it's been more than 3 months since the expiry date or if your registration is cancelled for any reason, it is an offence to keep the number plates.\n\nYou must hand in them in at a service centre.\n\nYou can apply for the same content as your old number plates, but there's no guarantee it will be available as your 'right to display' has expired.\n\nReplacing number plates\n\nYou can choose to replace your existing number plates if you want a different style, through myPlates\n\nDamaged number plates\n\nIf your existing NSW-issued number plates are damaged or worn, you can replace them with the same content and style (if still available), through myPlates.\n\nLost or destroyed number plates\n\nIf one or both of your number plates have been lost or destroyed (a plate/s that cannot be affixed to your vehicle), you need to visit a service centre and report it. When you visit the service centre, bring any damaged plates if you have them. The service centre will issue new plates. Please be aware that these plates will not be exact copies of your previous plates.\n\nStolen number plates\n\nIf one or both of your number plates have been stolen, report the matter to the NSW Police and obtain a COPS Event Number. Then visit a service centre to report the stolen plates and receive new ones. You will need to provide the COPS Event Number, as well as any plate you still have. The service centre will issue new plates. Please be aware that these plates will not be exact copies of the stolen plates.\n\nYou can exchange number plates between two currently registered vehicles. There may be some instances where plates are not eligible. Contact us on 13 77 88 to see if the two sets of plates are eligible for exchange.\n\nYou can reserve or order personalised number plates online at myPlates. Personalised number plate content can be reserved until you're ready to use the number plates.\n\nReservations last 1 year and are paid for in advance with an annual fee. When you're ready for the number plates to be manufactured, the order fee is charged.\n\nOrder or renew personalised number plates online at myPlates.\n\nBuying a vehicle with personalised plates\n\nIf you buy a vehicle with personalised plates, you'll be charged a transfer fee and an annual fee unless you choose to replace them.\n\nIf you choose to replace them, you need to take these items with you to the service centre when you transfer the registration:\n\ncompleted Number Plates and/or Cancellation of Registration\n\ndocuments needed to transfer registration\n\nnumber plates\n\nproof of identity."
