        "text": "Many have already become accustomed to buying vignettes online when passing through Bulgaria on their way to the sea, especially towards Thassos and Kavala. However, if you are traveling this route for the first time, we will describe in detail how to purchase and register a vignette for passing through Bulgaria.\n\nThe process is not complicated and the vignette purchasing website has an option in Serbian, which greatly facilitates the buying and registration process.\n\nThe website for purchasing vignettes is the following: https://web.bgtoll.bg/\n\nThe first step is to choose a vignette for toll roads through Bulgaria\n\nIndicate whether you need a vignette for a car or a trailer.\n\nThen, you need to select the desired validity period. It is important to emphasize that the vignette is valid from the moment you receive the registration confirmation, so if you are ordering it in advance, be careful to enter the date when you will pass through Bulgaria, not the date of ordering.\n\nThe prices of vignettes for cars are as follows:\n\nA vignette for 1 weekend costs 9 leva = about 5 € (valid from Friday at 12:00 to Sunday at 23:59)\n\nA vignette for 7 days costs BGN 13 = about €7\n\nA vignette for 1 month costs BGN 27 = about €14\n\nA vignette for 90 days costs BGN 48 = about €25\n\nThe second step is entering vehicle information\n\nAfter choosing the appropriate vehicle category and duration, you need to enter your vehicle details.\n\nSelect the country where your car is registered (Serbia) and then enter the vehicle registration number.\n\nImportant: write the registration plate number without special characters, dots, dashes, or spaces.\n\nThe registration plate number should match the data in the vehicle registration certificate.\n\nDouble-check multiple times just in case because once the vignette is activated for that registration plate number, it is not possible to change it, and you must buy a new one.\n\nThe vignette is tied to the vehicle registration number. If, by any chance, you make a mistake in the plate number but receive the registration confirmation for the vignette, or change the vehicle during your journey, you must purchase a new vignette.\n\nThe third step is confirming the data and paying for the vignette\n\nThe final step is to review your data, accept the terms of use, and pay for your order. Double-check that you have entered all the data correctly.\n\nYou can pay by credit card, and through services such as PayPal, Apple Pay, and other online payment systems (all offered on the website).\n\nIf you are purchasing during working hours (06:00-22:00 CET), you will receive the confirmation that you have purchased and registered the vignette (activated) via email within a few minutes. If you do not have constant access to email, you can choose the SMS option when ordering, and you will receive confirmation that the vignette has been purchased and registered via a message on your phone.\n\nIt is not necessary to have a printed copy with you when traveling, but you should have proof of registration (vignette) in PDF format or at least as a photo showing all the main data.\n\nCan I buy a vignette on the spot as soon as I cross the border?\n\nIf you were not successful online, if you are still not sure, then buy the vignette immediately upon entry, after the customs control, at a kiosk on the left side. You will need the vignette immediately upon entering Bulgaria and do not look for it further from the border because it is no longer possible to buy it at gas stations.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nCan a vignette be purchased for a past date?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer to this question is no. You will always need the vignette before entering Bulgaria, specifically at the first toll booth.\n\nCan I cancel my order?\n\nYou can, but only if the vignette has not been confirmed (registered). If you have received an email confirming the purchase of your vignette, you can no longer cancel it, you can only buy a new one. Therefore, we advise everyone to double-check the dates and registration plate numbers before purchasing. Below each data entry field, until the very end, there is a “back” button, and before the final step of purchase, you can go back and check all the entered data.\n\nCan I change the registration plate on the vignette I purchased?\n\nYou cannot change the registration plate after the vignette has been activated. If you made a mistake, you will need to buy a new one.\n\nIf you drove through Bulgaria without a vignette?\n\nThis explanation is on their website: “If the local police did not stop you, you will receive a fine by mail. We advise you to pay the fine within the specified period.”\n\nIs there a contact center where I can ask questions related to the vignette in Bulgaria?\n\nIf you bought more vignettes or have any other question or problem, you can write to info@bgtoll.bg or support@vignettebulgaria.com or by phone: 0700 10876\n\nYou need to specify your order ID and license plate number in the email.\n\nTolls and travel expenses to summer resorts in Greece ypu can see HERE.\n\nYou can read detailed information about roads and routes through Bulgaria in our articles:\n\nDriving to Greece through Bulgaria\n\nThassos Via Bulgaria\n\nTravel to Thassos and Kavala through Bansko and Drama\n\nThe route to Thassos via Bulgaria - border crossings Novo Selo/Zlatarevo and Kulata/Promahonas\n\nRoad to Greece via Vlasina Lake and Bulgaria\n\nDriving to Kavala\n\nWe offer over 2,500 accommodations.
