        "text": "Driving a rental car in Greece is not complicated, but be aware that some of the roads are narrow and winding and you should be careful not to go down dirt or unpaved roads.\n\n◾ Getting on a ferry with the rental car\n\nBetween some of the islands there are ferry crossings. Take into account that some of the rental companies forbid boarding with the rented vehicle on a ferry, while other companies approve boarding on a ferry, but with an additional insurance fee. In any case, if there is an intention to board a ferry during the trip, this must be indicated by you at the booking stage.\n\n◾ Toll roads\n\nThere are several toll roads in Greece, mainly in the Athens and Thessaloniki areas. The cost of traveling on them is relatively low and varies between 3 and 20 euros, depending on the section of the road. Also, a toll is charged in some of the tunnels and bridges. Most of the tolls are collected in cash. The use of electronic toll cards known from other European countries is more complex here, because the companies that build and manage the toll roads are private.\n\n◾ Prohibition of leaving the country with the rented vehicle\n\nFor your attention - all the car rental suppliers in Greece forbid leaving the country your rented car.\n\n◾ Restricted driving zone\n\nAthens implements a restricted driving zone in its downtown area, called the \"Daktylios\".\n\nIt limits the entrance to the city center depending on the day by odd and even number ending plates and also if your car if low in co2 emission.\n\nThe limitation usually apply from October to July.\n\nOn weekends, official holidays or if there is a strike in public transportation - there is no limitation.\n\nWe suggest you will check this with the car rental company upon pickup if you plan to enter Athens city center with the rented car.\n\nFor more important tips regarding renting a car abroad click here\n\nOfran wishes you a safe and pleasant trip with your rental car in Greece\n\nIt is very common in Greece to almost always start in Athens, the capital. If it's a trip to the Peloponnese, Pelion region, or northern Greece to Thessaloniki and Ioannina, car rental in Greece will start in Athens.\n\nHowever, car rental is also possible and recommended on many islands that are very popular, such as Crete, Rhodes, Corfu, Mykonos and more, where a rental car will allow you to explore the island's surroundings and reach nearby cities, spectacular beaches, and in many cases also fascinating archaeological sites that will spice up your vacation with thousands of years of history.\n\nCar trip on the mainland\n\nAlthough our initial association with Greece is always coastal, there is much more to it than the sea and a trip to the \"mainland\" can allow for an unforgettable family experience even outside the islands.\n\nThe distances are not great, so you can see a large number of places by car in Greece.\n\nSome of the recommended places for such a trip are: Thessaloniki and its impressive Byzantine churches, Mount Olympus, Meteora, Delphi and the Corinth Canal.\n\nLefkada\n\nLefkada in western Greece is connected to the main mainland of Greece by a bridge. It is a mountainous island with perfect beaches, which you have probably already come across in photos due to their beauty.\n\nThe famous Porto Katsiki beach is even more spectacular than in its pictures, it sits at the foot of a half-moon shaped cliff and offers flawless white sand and turquoise water.\n\nBesides lying on the beach or observing the landscape, the island offers many water-related activities, starting with a leisurely cruise along the coast, or a wide variety of water sports.\n\nGreece with children\n\nGreece is a perfect destination for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation for the whole family.\n\nThe most popular vacation in Greece is of course family time on the beaches and in the pampering resorts of the Greek islands. But renting a car in Greece will also allow you to go out and explore the surroundings with children, the authentic cities with colorful markets and taverns, and the archaeological and historical sites scattered there and on the islands.\n\nPeloponnese\n\nPeloponnese is a peninsula in southern Greece, it is a center of attraction for families. It looks like an island taken from a fairy tale or a fantasy series, due to the walled towns or castles left over from the Byzantine era. Most of them also provide a wonderful view of the sea.\n\nChildren will enjoy feeling like knights among the castles. You can enjoy the wonderful beaches of the peninsula, nature walks, bicycle tours and even a close encounter with the agricultural culture of the place, including a visit to one of the many farms.\n\nWaterland Thessaloniki\n\nNear Thessaloniki, there is the village of Tagarades, where you'll find a water park. It is the oldest in Europe, and is visited by over 100,000 visitors every day. It is full of facilities and special attractions, along with restaurants, cafes, tennis courts, basketball and even a zoo. To make sure all family members can enjoy the visit, it is recommended to devote at least a whole day for spending time in the park.\n\nShopping in Greece\n\nEven in Greece, you can't give up on the thrill of shopping and there is a variety of options for affordable and high-quality shopping.\n\nErmou Street, Athens\n\nThis is the perfect place to go if you are interested in a significant wardrobe refresh. Luxury brands at really affordable prices, alongside international brands such as Zara, Sephora, Marks & Spencer and more. The beautiful street also contains local shops with special collections.\n\nMediterranean Cosmos, Thessaloniki\n\nThe largest mall in northern Greece, designed for shopping and entertainment. It is an extremely popular destination, not only for locals and tourists, but also for residents of neighboring cities. The mall has over 200 stores, 30 restaurants and cafes, playgrounds and more.\n\nJumbo (department store chain)\n\nFans of the Jumbo department store will be able to find several branches in Greece - two in Crete (one in Heraklion, and one in Chania), and one in Thessaloniki. In this store you can find almost everything, from toys, to children's clothes, gifts and decorative items for the home, all at an affordable price."
