        "text": "For non-residents:\n\nFor those not physically present in Greece, they can grant a Greek Lawyer Power of Attorney to represent them at the tax office and complete the procedure on their behalf. This saves the non-resident the time and cost of traveling to Greece for bureaucracy reasons.\n\nAlternatively, non-residents can travel to Greece and arrange to visit the tax authority and submit their application. All non-residents must appoint a tax representative in Greece, so often it’s easier, quicker and more affordable to work with a lawyer.\n\nFor residents:\n\nIf the applicant is already in the country, he can visit the local tax office and submit the application in-person.\n\nThe team of Tax and Immigration lawyers at Lexidy Law Boutique Greece can help you by collecting the proper documentation on your behalf, reviewing the submission papers, tracking the progress of the application and even acting as a translator.\n\nThose already in Greece only need a valid Identity Card and proof of their address.\n\nFor companies:\n\nThe process for companies is more complex and follows the steps the below:\n\nObtain a Certificate of Incorporation from the Business registry of companies, which contains the following information:\n\nThe type of legal entity\n\nLegal name of the company\n\nThe company’s legal address\n\nDate of formation and registration\n\nBusiness Registry Number\n\nCompany’s activities codes\n\nThe Company’s representatives:\n\nName and TIN of the representatives abroad,\n\nName, TIN, address and citizenship of the representatives in Greece.\n\nApply for the tax ID number, or AFM, online using the General Commercial Register. The person who’s acting as the company’s representative must sign the paperwork.\n\nThe tax ID number can be obtained during the process of incorporating the company via the General Commercial Register’s electronic system. Sometimes, a lawyer will need to visit the tax office when incorporating a Greek company if there are foreign shareholders in order to obtain the tax ID number.\n\nThis process must always be executed before any purchase of goods or services, hiring of personnel and collection or payment of invoices.\n\nWhen a foreign company or subsidiary in Greece obtains a tax ID number, it’s mandatory to provide additional information and documents, so working with a Greek corporate lawyer who specializes with foreign companies makes the process simpler and faster.\n\nOnce the request has been made and all the required documents have been uploaded to the Business Registry, the Tax ID Number is issued directly. In some special cases, the data that’s been provided by relevant parties needs to be verified in person at the tax Office and they will issue the corresponding tax identification number directly after the meeting."
