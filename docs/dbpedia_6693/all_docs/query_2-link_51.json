        "text": "Please take valid travel and medical documents with you. However, you should be able to enter the EU even without these.\n\nAll EU countries bordering Ukraine are allowing those fleeing the war, including children, to enter on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIf you have Ukrainian nationality or are a beneficiary of international protection residing Ukraine and have a biometric passport, you can enter the EU by presenting your passport at the border. For all other cases, EU Member States will admit you on humanitarian grounds.\n\nIf you have another nationality, subject to visa requirements to enter the EU, you should present your short-stay visa if you have one. If you do not have a short-stay visa, EU Member States should still allow you to enter, with a view to facilitate your repatriation to your country of origin.\n\nIn view of the current situation in Ukraine, EU Member States may carry out border checks at the borders but also at a different, safe locations away from the border. The checks can be carried out during or after your transport to that safe location. You may be required to remain available to the authorities in that safe location while they conduct the checks.\n\nIrrespective of your nationality, you are entitled to immediate assistance and immediate information about your rights. This includes temporary shelter and the fulfilment of your basic needs such as food and medicine. Further rights may vary, depending on the status you will receive in the EU.\n\nPolice and other administrative checks are possible at any moment including within the territories of the Member States for security and migration purposes. It is important to cooperate and provide the required documents and information to police, border guards or other competent authorities. In certain circumstances, you may be required to remain available to the authorities during these checks in designated facilities.\n\nSince the beginning of the war, several European transport companies have been offering free transport, including rail, bus, ferry, and air travel. A list of the carriers involved is available here.\n\nAs far as Greece is concerned, from May 18th, transportation to Athens and Thessaloniki is free of charge for 90 days with the following procedures:\n\nAthens:\n\nThe OASA Group from the 18th of May 2022, announced that war refugees from Ukraine residing in the Region of Attica, acquire the right of full exemption from the payment of a fare in public transport under the responsibility of the Group with a validity of 90 days.\n\nBeneficiaries can issue personalized ATH.ENA card electronic mobility cards from the OASA Group ticket offices that have a special device for issuing personalized cards.\n\nIn order to to get the right to a free fare you will need:\n\nTaxisNet codes for accreditation /entry into the application\n\nthe personalized ATH.ENA card\n\nthe 8-digit Pin code of ATH.ENA card\n\nIf you have not purchased a personalized card, you must do so beforehand, otherwise you will not be able to continue the procedure.\n\nThe 8-digit Pin code won’t be saved, but will simply only be used to verify your card.\n\nAfter entering the app with your TaxisNet credentials, the free fare request process is summarized in the following 4 simple steps:\n\nregister your card\n\nverify your card\n\nchoose the free fare category you apply for from the available ones: Unemployed OAED or Unemployed GEN or Disabled or Refugees from Ukraine\n\nactivate the free fare by stating your consent\n\nRegarding minors up to 6 years old transportation is free of charge. For children from 7 years old you can also issue a card in the same way as yours. The ‘issuance/possession of a VAT number’ has nothing to do with it.\n\nThessaloniki: OASTH provides free quarterly travel passes for travel for Ukrainian war refugees, for transportation by bus.\n\nA stand was installed at Pavilion 2 at the TIF (Thessaloniki International Fair), where basic necessities are collected and then applications for the granting of the cards are made available to the displaced Ukrainian refugees, as well as their issue.\n\nIn order to submit the application and then receive the card, Ukrainian refugees must have with them the Temporary Protection Residence Permit or, alternatively, the passport with which they entered Greece after 24 February.\n\nFrom June 1st, the relevant procedure will take place at the offices of OASTH, at 90 Alexandrou Papanastasiou Street, on the ground floor.\n\nIn addition, OASTH gives the opportunity for the electronic submission of the application, at the address cards.oasth.gr.\n\nAs a supporting document you will need to have with you your Temporary Protection Residence Permit or, alternatively, the passport with which you entered Greece after February 24th of 2022.\n\nWithin the 90-day period, you will be granted a one (1)-year temporary protection by the Asylum Service of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum. This gives you the right of access to residence, labour market and to medical care, in accordance with Directive 2001/55 of the Council of the European Union and Presidential Decree 80/2006 (Greek National Legislation). https://migration.gov.gr/en/ukraine/.\n\nAttention! Residence Permits of Temporary Protection that expire by March 4, 2023 are automatically renewed for an additional period of six (6) months- that is, until September 4, 2023. If during the above period the European Commission does not decide to terminate temporary protection as a residence status, temporary protection residence permits will be further renewed for an additional six (6) months (until March 4, 2024).Given the above extension, residence permits will not be further renewed and permit holders do not need to proceed to any additional actions. New Residence Permits of Temporary Protection will continue to be issued to displaced people from Ukraine who enter Greece for the first time (and within the above time framework). Temporary Protection Residence Permits act as proof of Temporary Protection Status, provide Ukrainian refugees with the right to work and protect their rights as specified in Articles 128 and 131 of Law 4939/2022.\n\nAbout the procedure for granting temporary protection, please contact us via email at tp-support@migration.gov.gr\n\nImportant: The procedure for granting temporary protection is provided free of charge by the Ministry of Migration and Asylum. In particular, free interpretation assistance is provided in the helpdesk and during the full registration, in order to assign the Temporary Protection Residence Permit [ADPP] to the beneficiary, who simultaneously lists / provides a VAT number and an AMKA.\n\nTemporary Protection is designed to provide immediate protection to refugees, including those who have fled areas of armed conflict. While temporary protection doesn’t obstruct the right to apply for international protection, it may reduce the need to apply immediately as you will receive a residence permit as well as associated rights. The duration of temporary protection is defined by EU law.\n\nAsylum is an individual right, granted following a specific administrative and legal process that will determine whether you have a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion. Once granted, asylum can be withdrawn whenever new elements or findings arise indicating that there are reasons to reconsider its validity.\n\nThe right to temporary protection is in addition to the right to apply for international protection (asylum status).\n\nYou should enquire at the national authorities of the Member State where you are present for more details regarding specific rights, such as access to medical care, housing and the labour market, education for children and detention, under each regime. For general information about fundamental rights during the asylum procedure, please see here.\n\nIf the children enter the country as unaccompanied minors, then the National Mechanism for Identification and Protection of Unaccompanied Minors of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum is activated to transfer them to special emergency accommodation facilities. Thereafter, the prescribed procedure of identification (if necessary) and guardianship is followed.\n\nAll Ukrainian citizens residing in Greece who are going to receive and provide care for their minor relatives from Ukraine arriving in Greece, are kindly requested to receive them from the entry points. Specifically, the adult relatives should be present at the entry points (e.g., Promachonas Border Station) during the minors’ arrival holding the necessary legal documents that prove their family relationship. Additionally, they should also hold the documents that prove the consent of the minor’s parents concerning the assignment of the custody to the adult relative in Greece. Upon assessment by the Greek authorities and the Implementing Partners of the National Emergency Response Mechanism for Unaccompanied Minors in precarious living conditions, the adult relatives will be able to undertake the care/ custody of their minor relative.\n\nTelephone: Monday to Friday 08:00-22:00, Saturday 11:00 – 19:00 : +302132128888, +306942773030\n\nEmail: ssuam.tracing@migration.gov.gr\n\nSource : https://migration.gov.gr/en/ukraine/\n\nOn March 28th 2022 the temporary protecton application was activated through the official site of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum (available in English, Greek and Ukrainian (https://apps.migration.gov.gr/temporary-protection/?lang=gr). To submit the application you will need to register first through a personal email in which you will receive a one time password (OTP) each time you log in. After that you should dill in the application including:\n\nComplete demographic data\n\nType and number of identification document\n\nEducational level and the field in which you are professionally active\n\nIf you are facing a housing problem, and if you have a support network in Greece (friends, family)\n\nThe location where you wish to be registered and receive the card for the Beneficiary of Temporary Protection. The locations are:\n\nATTICA (Regional Asylum Service Office of Attica, 2 PANAGIOTI KANELOPOULOU AVE., 11527 ATHENS)\n\nAlimos (next to Athens), Regional Asylum Service Office, Alimos, Dodekanisou 6, 17456\n\nTHESSALONIKI (Regional Asylum Service Office of Thessaloniki, 5 PONTOU STR., 54628 THESSALONIKI)\n\nPATRA (Regional Asylum Service Office of Western Greece, 92 PANACHAIKOU & KAPODISTRIOU ST., 26224 PATRA)\n\nCRETE (Regional Asylum Service Office of Crete, 1 ELEFTHERNIS & IFAISTOU ST., 71303 HERAKLION)\n\nOnce you have finalized your application, you will be given an appointment (Date & Time) for your attendance at the location that you chose for your registration, and you will receive a receipt to the e-mail address you have provided. The appointment is the same for all members of the application.\n\nAs part of the policy of facilitating Ukrainian refugees, a free return bus ticket will be available in many cases, to and from the registration centers in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patra and Crete from April 4th and for a period of two months for the identification process.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nby phone at: +302131629600 or by e-mail at: ukraine@migration.gov.gr\n\nDuring April, the issuance of a 12-month residence and work permit begins for Ukrainian Nationals residing in Ukraine before 24/2/2022.\n\nAttention: Ukrainians who arrived in Greece three months before the date of invasion in Ukraine are also entitled to get the temporary protection status.\n\nThere will be centers in Athens, Thessaloniki, Patra, and Iraklion, in which after an electronic pre-registration, the displaced will get a 12-month residence permit (with expiration date the 4th of March 2023) as well as Social Security Number (AMKA) and Tax Registration Number (AFM), so that they can join the labour market and access health care. The Ministry stated that the AMKA and AFM will be included on your Temporary Protection Status card. The procedure is carried out exclusively by employees of the Asylum Service, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum, in extended hours, and with the assistance of the European Union Agency for Asylum.\n\nTemporary Protection gives you the right to access the labour market, health care system, education, issuing an AFM (including TAXISnet) and AMKA.\n\nAttention: Until the status is activated you can access hospitals through the Emergency Healthcare without the AMKA.\n\nTaxisNet codes, tax registration numbers (AFM) and AMKA/ P.A.A.Y.P.A. (Provisional Insurance and Health Care Number) are necessary to access state services. TaxisNet codes are the key to accessing the platforms as everything is done online. The initial request to issue TaxisNet codes is made electronically through this site (only available in Greek). Once AMKA /P.A.A.Y.P.A. are issued, there is automatic access to public health care.\n\nRegarding the issuance of the criminal record, responsible are the Greek KEP (Citizen Service Centers) to which the pesron should contact. The issuance could be in person (even if there are no TaxisNet codes) or through the website (https://www.gov.gr/ipiresies/dikaiosune/poiniko-metroo/antigrapho-poinikou-metroou) using the ΤaxisΝet codes. In both cases there is a possibility an update of the contact details for the National Contact Register (EMEP) to be requested that can be done independently through the website (https://www.gov.gr/ipiresies/polites-kai-kathemerinoteta/stoikheia-polite-kai-tautopoietika-eggrapha/ethniko-metroo-epikoinonias-emep) with the TaxisNet codes. The duration of the copy of the criminal record is 3 months from the date of issue.\n\nAll Ukrainians on the humanitarian ‘visa’ having entered Greece after February 24th, 2022, can access hospitals/ medical healthcare services without insurance until their temporary protection status is issued. (Essentially, they can access the National Health System free of charge, including hospitalization and medical care, like uninsured vulnerable social groups.)\n\nAccess to public healthcare is free and accessed by appointment. Healthcare is provided through public hospitals and medical centers (including mental health units) as well as municipal clinics and other structures, by the doctors, who can prescribe medication and carry out required therapeutic procedures and diagnostic tests. Appointments can be booked by phone or in some cases online. The patient must always present their insurance number (AMKA / P.A.A.Y.P.A.), which must be issued as soon as possible.\n\nFor emergencies that need urgent medical attention, citizens can visit the on-duty hospitals. The on-call hours change daily, and information is available online including the type of doctors available in each hospital. The hospital emergency department is obliged to accept patients, regardless of the possession of legal or other documentation. Those who don’t have relevant documentation should be recorded in the books of the outpatient clinics and the Traffic Office, and the expenses should be recorded in the categories “Refugees – Series Z”.\n\nIf you do not speak Greek or English, you should arrange to have an interpreter, otherwise it is quite possible that you will not be able to be served. The NGO Metadrasi has extended interpretations services (24/7) to help with Ukrainian interpretation for public/social services.\n\nIf you get a prescription for medication, it will be available in all pharmacies (that belong to the EOPYY (National Organization for Health Care Services), usually with small to zero cost.\n\nIn addition, if there is no way of physical transportation of the patient who needs immediate medical care, there is the emergency number of the National Emergency Center (EKAV) 166, which is free and can be called even without access to a mobile network. In case of emergency, an ambulance is provided to transport the patient to the nearest hospital on duty.\n\nTo contact 166, you should have the following information:\n\nYour exact location (address, floor, apartment)\n\nPatient’s name and surname\n\nIf there is fever\n\nSocial Security Number – AMKA\n\nThere is also the emergency number 112 for all emergencies, accessible without a mobile network, providing 24hour interpretation in various languages. In Greece, 112 is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and can connect the caller with:\n\nPolice\n\nFire Brigade\n\nEmergency Medical Services\n\nCoast Guard\n\nthe European hotline for missing children 116000\n\nthe National Helpline for children SOS 1056\n\nHealthcare and Labour market access will be granted with the Temporary Protection Status. Other benefits have not yet been announced. SolidarityNow also provides Employability and Work Counseling Services in the Athens’ and Thessaloniki’s centers, supporting unemployed people to connect with the labour market.\n\nMoreover, the telephone helpline 10306 (select 4) offers free of charge mental health support and care to refugees from Ukraine. The service is provided by Ukrainian mental health professionals with special training.\n\nThe helpline operates from Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.and it is free of charge and anonymous. Dial 10306 and select 4.\n\nThe service is an initiative of the Deputy Minister for Health who oversees mental health issues, and is funded by the Ministry of Health, with the participation of:\n\n-The Federation of Bodies for Psychological Recovery and Mental Health “Argo”\n\n-The Research University Institute for Mental Health, and\n\n-The Smile of the Child\n\nIn addition, SolidarityNow offers mental health support and psychosocial support to refugees from Ukraine through individual counseling, family or group sessions and group empowerment activities, addressed to women and minor children, at the Blue Refugee Center in Thessaloniki.\n\nThe mental health interventions and psychosocial support that take place at the Blue Refugee Center, aim to help the individual:\n\nTo adapt to the new reality and plan its next steps\n\nGet in touch with peers and offer/receive mutual support\n\nTo strengthen their parental role and effectively address challenges with children\n\nTo empower children through play and creative activities\n\nImprove the social skills of children and adolescents and encourage them to express themselves through interactive games.\n\nThe project is part of the ‘Unicef Ukraine Response CP Programme – Northern Greece’, implemented by Solidarity Now.\n\nFor more information contact us at the following telephone numbers (Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm)\n\nAthens Solidarity Center: +3021 0822 0883 |Blue Refugee Center (Thessaloniki): +30 231055 5266\n\nYes, you can open a bank account in Greece.\n\nThe salary/ pension accounts (payroll accounts) are untaxed. However, each bank, depending on its pricing policy, may charge for the creation of this account. Beyond that there is taxation only on income from paid employment, business, or real estate leasing. Social Allowances are tax-free. There are no specific guidelines for Ukrainian refugees, so the procedure is the same as for others.\n\nThe documents required to open a bank account vary, depending on the bank. A list of commonly asked documents is included below.\n\nIdentification Document (valid passport and/or residence permit, valid international protection applicants’ card)\n\nConfirmation of the main residence address (Certified public document by a public authority or consulate of the residence location, from which the main residence address occurs)\n\nIncome Certification and Tax Registration Number (AFM)\n\nTax Residence Certificate\n\nLast Tax Clearance and Tax Return Certificate\n\nConfirmation of profession/ business address and telephone number (Employer’s certificate or document from a public authority, embassy, or consulate from which the professional status arises.\n\nConfirmation of contact telephone number (mobile/ landline number)\n\nIn case an interpreter is needed during the procedure of opening the account, the interpreter must provide a solemn declaration including the following text “I have a thorough knowledge of the Greek Language as well as the … language, so that I can accurately translate the terms of the documents in which I will co-sign.”\n\nCars with Ukrainian plates should have the so called “green card” (insurance for the car outside the country of registration) when they are used outside Ukraine. The green card is based on the Ukrainian insurance of the car. While the green card (insurance) is paid before the exit of the car from the country of registration, Ukraine legislated that cars with Ukrainian plates can leave the country without it.\n\nCars with Ukrainian plates used outside Ukraine are covered exceptionally by the Ukrainian Bureau of International Insurance for a period of 30 days without charge. After the expiration of the above 30 days period, the cars with Ukrainian plates should be insured. The Ukrainian Bureau of International Insurance operates and has shared the attached information for owners of cars with Ukrainian plates that are used outside Ukraine (http://www.mtsbu.ua/ua/presscenter/news/168164/ ). The cost of insurance in that case is appx. 180 euros per month.\n\nThe entry of cars with Ukrainian plates into Greece is documented with a stamp of the Customs Office in Promahona or border checkpoints. The stamp documents when the start of the six-month period for the use of the car in Greece begins.\n\nThe cars with Ukrainian plates cannot be insured by Greek Insurance Companies unless they get provisional Greek plates. Only the green card is available as a means of insurance.\n\nAfter entering Greece with your vehicle, you must state your address at the customs office of his place of residence to get Greek provisional plates. To do this, you need to have a hosting address (friends, hotel, etc.), and you will need to visit the city’s custom office. The declaration must be made within 30 days from the date of entry into Greece, otherwise a fine will be imposed.\n\nIn this case the cost for using the car is analyzed as follows:\n\n100 euros for the provisional plates\n\nroad taxes (possibility to pay per month – the cost depends on the cubics of the car)\n\ninsurance that is bought in Greece – Greek insurance purchased\n\nFor Attika/Piraeus region, the Customs Office that provides provisional plates is the one located in the port of Piraeus.\n\nFor the area of Thessaloniki you can contact the A Customs Office of Thessaloniki at the port located at the intersection of Karatasos and October 28th. For more information you can call the +30 2313 334320.\n\nRegarding the driving license, a valid driving license issued in Ukraine is accepted for driving in Greece when:\n\nEither it is held by a person enjoying temporary protection in accordance with Article 1 of the 3d relevant decision.\n\nEither it is held by a person who does not have his habitual residence in Greece, because of the fact that both Greece and Ukraine are parties to the Vienna Convention (1968) on Road Traffic.\n\nIn case the license is not in Latin characters, it is required to be accompanied either by an official translation into Greek or English or by a valid international license.\n\nIn case the owner does not want to use the car there is the possibility to declare at the Customs office of his/her place of residence that the car is immobilized. The cost of the procedure is 10 – 20 euros and an officer of the Customs Office visits the place where the car is parked to lock the wheel. The immobilization of the car means that the six months period freezes.\n\nImportant useful information: in case the entry of the car in Greece is not proved by the relevant document issued at the borders, the car owners should have with them their passports that prove when they have entered Greece to facilitate the procedure at the Customs, which enters in the system the date of entry of the car in Greece.\n\nIn any case, please contact the customs service in your area.\n\nFor now, any type of identification document (e.g., passport) will be enough and your child can be enrolled even without having all the official documents. The person in charge – based on the address – SEP (Refugee Education Coordinators) indicates in which school unit the child will be enrolled. After contacting and making an appointment with the school principal, you visit the school to complete enrolment. You will be asked to complete additional documents there, which will be given to us by the principal. These documents include:\n\nA registration form\n\nProof of address in Greece (you can get it from the Site Manager if you reside in an open accommodation center, from the social worker responsible at the accommodation scheme, or with a declaration in KEP)\n\nLegal documents of the child and parents\n\nSolemn Declaration of the parent in relevance with the previous years of studying in the country of origin\n\nSolemn Declaration of previous participation in Reception Classes (ZEP) (in case of attending)\n\nSolemn Declaration of participating in school’s meals program and healthy diet promotion. This way the child receives meals at school\n\nSolemn Declaration of the person/people that will accompany the child to and from school\n\nAlso, another document that will be requested during the first period of the child attending school is the Individual Student Health Card (ADYM), which is issued by a pediatrician, after examination. The child will also be asked by the school for a vaccination book listing the vaccines he has already received."
