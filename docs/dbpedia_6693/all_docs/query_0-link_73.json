You can now register here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/annual-meeting-and-edi.\n\nIn conjunction with the Annual Meeting, we are organising our first ever Equality, Diversity and Inclusion seminar on 26 November.

Read more about the EDI seminar.\n\nDates: 27-28 November 2024.\n\nLocation: Grand Hotel Palace, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nTheme: The theme of the meeting is SAR Everywhere and at All Times. As we celebrate the IMRF centenary, we will be discussing our past, present and future. After assessing our collective achievements, we shift focus to our current priorities. As we work together to map out the future of our industry, including future challenges and opportunities, this year’s meeting’s main objective will be on SAR organisations’ sustainability, including our #FutureSAR project, and the use of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS). We will also focus on our key advocacy role in influencing policy and regulation for our sector.\n\nCost: There is no registration fee for this event, as it’s a members' benefit. However, for this year only and due to the high anticipated number of attendees, there will be a charge for those attending the celebration dinner on 27 November. The evening will bring us together to celebrate our achievements over the past 100 years of advancing maritime SAR around the globe.\n\nProgramme Outline\n\nThe annual meeting will celebrate IMRF's 100-year history, reflecting on global achievements in search and rescue (SAR) and providing updates on IMRF programmes. Key topics include sustainability in maritime SAR, innovative uses of rescue equipment, discussions on Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS), and the benefits of IMRF membership. The IMRF Awards 2024 and future plans for 2025 will also be highlighted. The second day will focus on the Hellenic Rescue Team, covering their history, future plans, and technological advancements, culminating in a live demonstration in Thessaloniki's port, in collaboration with the Greek Coast Guard.
