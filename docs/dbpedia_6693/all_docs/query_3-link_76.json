        "text": "Title & Registration Costs\n\nWhen applying for a Colorado title and/or registration, you are required to pay all applicable fees and taxes. The following is a brief explanation of these.\n\nRegistration Fee Estimator Online\n\nVehicle Registration Fees\n\nRegistration fees (license fee plus an ownership tax) are based upon the year, weight, taxable value, and month of registration. Since these figures are not the same for all vehicles, this site cannot provide you with exact fees. The license fee is based upon the weight of your vehicle, while the other factors determine your ownership tax. The formula below can be used to calculate the ownership tax portion of your fees.\n\nLight truck: 75% of MSRP (sticker price)\n\nPassenger vehicle: 85% of MSRP (sticker price)\n\nYear of service (manufacturer year counts as the first year of service):\n\nFirst year: 2.1% of tax value\n\nSecond year: 1.5% of tax value\n\nThird year: 1.2% of tax value\n\nFourth year: 0.9% of tax value\n\nFifth - ninth year: 0.45% of tax value\n\n10th year and above: Minimum of $3 per year\n\nOwnership & Prior Ownership Tax\n\nThis fee is a personal property tax. This tax is based on the year of the vehicle, original taxable value and date of purchase (on newly acquired vehicles) or previous expiration date of the license plates (on expired renewals).\n\nAdditional Fees\n\nThere are additional fees collected on vehicles. These fees are due because of legislative mandates. For further explanation please contact the Motor Vehicle Office at 720.523.6010.\n\nTitle Application Fees\n\nTitle Fee: $7.20\n\nLien Filing Fee: $5 per page, per side up to legal size; $10 per page, per side for documents over 14 inches in length or over 8.5 inches in width\n\nSales Tax Rates\n\nSales taxes are due one time after a new or used vehicle purchase at the time your vehicle is titles. Sales taxes are based on the vehicle purchase price. Because of the different cities and taxing jurisdictions within Adams County, the sales tax rates will vary.\n\nColorado state sales/use tax: 2.9%\n\nRTD sales/use tax: 1.1%\n\nAdams County sales tax (due only if purchased from another Adams County resident or a dealer located in Adams County): 0.75%\n\nCity sales/use tax is based on your place of residency and is in addition to the above taxes. Tax rates for cities located in Adams County are as follows:\n\nPurchased from a Dealer\n\nEither a portion or all applicable sales taxes are collected by your dealer. The percentage collected by your dealer is based on location. Any unpaid sales taxes are collected by Adams County Motor Vehicles. Any outstanding sales tax must be collected before your vehicle is titles.\n\nSales tax is calculated on the net purchase price (which is the total purchase price less the amount allowed by a dealer for any trade-in).\n\nPurchased from a Private Party\n\nWhen a vehicle is purchased from a private party, Adams County Motor Vehicles collects all sales taxes."
