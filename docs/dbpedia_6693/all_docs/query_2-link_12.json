        "text": "The history of Jews in Greece may date back thousands of years to the Babylonian exile, around 585 to 549 B.C.E. When the Persian king Cyrus the Great allowed the captive Judeans to return home, some reportedly settled in Greece instead. Until around the third century B.C.E., there were only scattered, isolated Jews living in Greek cities. Alexander the Great's conquest of the ancient Kingdom of Judah and the incorporation of the region into his empire coincided with the founding of a long-term Jewish community in Greece. Under his rule, the Jewish communities flourished and many lived a largely Hellenized lifestyle, speaking Greek and not Hebrew. Many Jewish immigrants began settling in Hellenist cities along the Aegean Coast and Greek mainland during this time, and they too became part of a growing class of assimilated, pro-Greek Jews.\n\nDespite such developments, a majority of Jews in Greece retained monotheism. From 167 to 164 B.C.E., the famed Maccabean Revolt, led by Judah Maccabee, led to the defeat of the Greeks and the restoration of Jewish worship at the Second Temple. After the revolt, many Hellenized Jews left Judea for more Hellenistic destinations, such as Alexandria and Antioch. The people in these communities were called “Romaniote” and translated Jewish prayers into Greek. Romaniote communities developed throughout the Byzantine era and became linchpins in various industries throughout Greece.\n\nMany Jews completely assimilated into Greek culture while others attempted to maintain Jewish traditions, such as Hebrew. As a result of violence due to the Crusades, many Ashkenazi Jews from Central Europe arrived in North Greece and found refuge in the city of Thessaloniki. Jewish community life in Greece changed after the Ottomans captured Constantinople, the Byzantine capital, in 1453. The Ottomans ruled under Islamic law, which gave Jews religious and sometimes even legal authority over their communities. As a result of such practices, Greece became a haven for persecuted Jews fleeing the Inquisition. They found that Ottoman Greece was religiously tolerant and extremely welcoming (Ottoman authorities encouraged Jewish immigration because it improved the economy). This signaled the beginning of a Sephardic Jewish presence in Greece.\n\nGreek Jews in the Ottoman Empire were extremely successful, occupying administrative posts and actively developing intellectual and commercial life throughout the region. The arrival of these Jewish refugees also changed the nature of the communities as many of the refugees were leading intellectuals, academics, and scientists. By the end of the 16th century, the community in Thessaloniki (Salonika) attained 30,000 members, equal to half the city's population. At first, there was friction between these new Sephardic arrivals and the already established Romaniot Jews; eventually, as the groups came to accept one another, the Sephardi \"Ladino\" language became the official language of Greek Jews.\n\nOver successive centuries, Jews from many other countries also moved to Thessaloniki, introducing German, French, Dutch, Egyptian, and Italian Jewish traditions. The Jewish population in Greece continued to live in relative comfort, with sporadic disruptions occurring from time to time, such as when the Ottomans imposed a special tax on the Jewish residents of Greece. More profoundly, the general support of the Ottoman Empire espoused by Greek Jews was seen with disapproval by the Christian Orthodox Greeks. During the Greek War of Independence, thousands of Greek Jews were massacred alongside the Ottoman Turks, with the Jewish communities of Tripoli, Kalamata, and Patras destroyed. Some survivors moved north to lands still ruled by the Ottomans after Greece gained independence in 1832.\n\nTrade routes shifted following the creation of an independent Greek state, and the port of Thessaloniki, formerly a hub for trade and commerce, started to lose significance. This, along with a movement towards the “Hellenization,” acceptance of Greek culture and language, of Jews and other ethnic groups in the late 19th century, saw fortunes negatively change for the Jews of Greece. Dismal trade and forced assimilation saw many Jews begin to leave Greece. Moreover, the establishment of the British Mandate of Palestine after World War I saw many Jews emigrate.\n\nNonetheless, the Jewish population continued to make up a sizable share of Greek society. There were approximately 50 synagogues spread out across the city of Thessaloniki, where Jews made up more than half of the population. When Greek economic and political life became centered around Athens, many Jews moved there. In 1936, Léon Recanati, a member of the Consistoire Israelite de Grece, represented the Greek Jewish communities at the WJC founding plenary in Geneva. On the eve of the Shoah, over 70,000 Jews lived in Greece and were part of the country’s everyday life and culture.\n\nThe Holocaust devastated the Greek Jewish community, and after the war, more than half of the 10,000 Jews who were in Greece when the Axis occupation ended, including the remnants of Macedonian and Thracian communities, made their way to Israel and other countries. Those who remained found themselves engulfed in violence as Greece plunged into civil war from 1946 to 1949. Jews fought on both sides of the conflict, with the British and U.S.-backed Greek government army and the Communist-backed Democratic Army of Greece. When the Greek government army emerged victorious, the supporters of the Communists, including members of the Jewish community, were hard hit by the repression exerted by the government after it had regained control.\n\nGreece was the first European country to return the property confiscated during the Holocaust to its Jewish community, with a 1949 royal decree establishing a foundation for Jewish survivors and their heirs to present claims in court for restitution or compensation. The property of murdered victims was placed into a common fund to aid Greek Jews impoverished by the war.\n\nIn recent years, the rise of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn Party, which is represented in the Greek Parliament, has been especially worrying to Greek Jews. Golden Dawn has links to other European parties of the extreme right, espouses an openly antisemitic policy, and engages in Holocaust denial. Holocaust denial is legally prohibited in Greece and can incur jail time. The debt crisis in the late 2000s saw a small number of Greek Jews emigrate, but overall the Jewish community in Greece has remained stable.\n\nToday, Greek Jews are well integrated into Greek society, working in various professional occupations and industries. relations between the Jewish community and the state are good, and Judaism is an officially recognized religion.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II, Greece tried to maintain neutrality but found itself drawn into the conflict after refusing to consent sovereignty to fascist Italy. Jewish soldiers and officers fought in the Greek forces that resisted the Italian and later German invasions of the country, and many of them fell in battle. However, once the Axis powers (Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria) divided up control of the country, the fate of the Jews was sealed. Those living in the German-controlled zone were subject to the most immediate and terrible threat. The 49,000 members of the community of Thessaloniki fell under German administration, and the community was almost destroyed in the first few months of the occupation.\n\nBy the end of 1945, 96.5% of the Jewish community had been murdered in the Nazi death camps in Poland. Less than 2,000 of the 50,000 Jews of pre-war Thessaloniki survived. After Germany took direct control of Athens, the community there was initially shielded by the Italian authorities' reluctance to enact anti-Jewish laws. However, thanks to Chief Rabbi Elijah Barzilai's leadership, who urged Christians to protect Jews by calling on Archbishop Damaskinos, a sizable number of Jews were able to escape or were hidden. The regions of Macedonia and Thrace were placed under Bulgarian administration, however, in stark contrast to the protection that was provided to the Jews in Bulgaria, largely thanks to Bulgarian civil society, the Bulgarian authorities deported the 11,000 Jews in the Greek zone under their control to the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.\n\nSimilar deportations were experienced by the Jews of the small communities in the Greek islands, including Rhodes, which were initially under Italian control. In the summer of 1944, after the Germans had replaced the Italians, all the Jews were rounded up and deported to Auschwitz, where nearly all of them perished; many did not even survive the 13-day journey from Piraeus to Auschwitz in sealed cattle wagons. In Rhodes, some 40 Turkish Jews were saved thanks to the heroism of the Turkish Consul Selahettin Ulkumen. In all, some 65,000 Greek Jews were murdered."
