        "text": "Vehicle registration plates of Daidieu generally take the form XX-#### for vehicles, with XX being two Bopomofo characters, and #### being a random 4-digit number. Standard license plates have black characters on white background. Plates measure 285 x 210 mm.\n\nHistory[]\n\nPre-1975[]\n\nPrior to the recognized independence of Daidieu in 1954, plates followed the French Indochina format. Plates were white-on-black with the XXX#### format. XXX was the location code. while #### was the serial number. After 1954, the format was changed to resemble Taiwan's, with 2 digits for the numeric code standing for one of the 44 provinces of Daidieu, followed by 4 digits. At first, the plates were white on black, but were changed to be white on blue in 1959 and white on red in 1968, after Ńwien King passed 22-9999 and was allocated a second code (45). The use of the format continued even under the People's Republic of Daidieu.\n\nSchematic representation (1954-1959)\n\n10-1275\n\nSchematic representation (1959-1968)\n\n43-0966\n\nSchematic representation (1968-1976)\n\n42-2508\n\n1976-1979[]\n\nIn 1976, Daidieuese license plates were harmonized with Vietnamese ones, which were black on white. However, with the need to distinguish Daidieuese vehicles from Vietnamese ones, there was to be no overlap between Vietnamese and Daidieuese codes. The format consisted of a 2-digit numerical code starting with 0, followed by a letter from A-Z, excluding I, J, O, Q, or W, and 4 digits. It was the shortest-used format, being used for only 3 years before the Republic of Daidieu was established, so in the end only series starting with 01-03 were allocated.\n\nThe size could either be 190 by 140 mm, or 520 by 110 mm. On 190x140 plates, the code with a letter was on top while the 4-digit number with a dash between the 2nd and 3rd digit was at the bottom.\n\nSchematic representation (190x140)\n\n01D\n\n11-32\n\nSchematic representation (190x140)\n\n02E-79-19\n\n1979-1989[]\n\nA new format was introduced in 1979. The format was overhauled and the plate size was now 400 by 140 mm. It now consisted of 2 digits representing the vehicle type, an abbreviation of the province name, and 4 digits. The vehicle type numbers were:\n\n00-54: Passenger cars\n\n55-79: Trucks\n\n80-89: Vans and station wagons\n\n90-94: Taxis, buses, and other public service vehicles (non-government)\n\n95-99: Trailers, construction equipment, and agricultural vehicles\n\nMotorcycles used 5 digits, without any indication of the vehicle type. Some types of license plates used a non-province symbol, with no vehicle classification type:\n\n賃: Rental cars\n\n外: Diplomatic vehicles\n\n際: International organizations\n\n軍: Military\n\n政: Government\n\n警: Police\n\n1989-present[]\n\nA new format was introduced on January 1, 1989 due to the shortage of combinations in Ńwien King. Plates now consisted of the PL##### format, where:\n\nP is the same province abbreviation as before\n\nL is a letter excluding I or O, indicating the vehicle clasification type\n\n# is a digit\n\nThee vehicle classification letters are:\n\nA, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N: Passenger vehicles\n\nP, Q, R, S, T, U: Trucks\n\nV, W, X: Vans and station wagons\n\nY: Taxis, buses, and other public service vehicles (non-government)\n\nZ: Trailers, construction equipment, and agricultural vehicles\n\nMotorcycles have the digits before the letter, which does not indicate the vehicle classification type (e.g. 原12345A). After it reaches 99999Z, it moves on to 0000AA, and and when it reaches 9999ZZ, it starts at 999AAA.\n\nIn November 2003, Ńwien King became the first province to run out of series, so license plates now have 2 letters and 4 digits (e.g. 原AB1234). It exhausted the series in February 2015, and now uses the ABC123 format.\n\nSchematic representation (A12345)\n\n吉B35999\n\nSchematic representation (AB1234)\n\n𨷯LK3681\n\nSchematic representation (ABC123)\n\n原DKR832\n\nSchematic representation (motorcycles)\n\n西7141BW\n\nOther plates[]\n\nCars owned by the government, governmental organizations, or diplomatic plates (excluding military) - White on blue with 政府X-#### (e.g. 政府ㄌ-80517)\n\nPrivate vehicles - Black on white with ####-XX format (e.g. 4858ㄘㄜ)\n\nConstruction vehicles - Black on yellow with ####-XX format (e.g. 2510ㄠㄥ)\n\nMilitary cars - White on red with X-####X format (e.g. ㄖ-5178ㄚ)\n\nForeigner-owned cars - Black on white with XX-#### format (X could be a letter) (e.g. PH-8162 or BJ-2850)\n\nDiplomatic plates - Black on white with 外交-XXXL### format, with XXX being the country code (e.g. 166 for Vietnam), and L being a letter.
