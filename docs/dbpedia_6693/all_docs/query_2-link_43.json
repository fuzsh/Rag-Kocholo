In this guide, you will find out more about:\n\nRules and regulations for getting a digital nomad visa for Greece,\n\nAdvantages and disadvantages of living in Greece,\n\nBest cities and towns for digital nomads in Greece, and\n\nUseful tips about living in Greece.\n\n“Knowledge creates happiness”, Plato said — and we want our readers to be happy, so let us waste no more time. Let’s learn more about the Greece digital nomad visa.\n\nQuick digital nomad visa facts for Greece\n\nBefore we start explaining the details of Greece’s digital nomad visa, let’s check some quick facts.\n\nWhat to expect as a digital nomad in Greece?\n\nHere are some things you should know before going to live as a digital nomad in Greece.\n\nGreece digital nomad visa\n\nGreece’s digital nomad visa is the perfect solution for freelancers, digital nomads, and other expats who want to live and work remotely in this Balkan country.\n\nThe visa was introduced in 2021, and, for now, it is the only type of digital nomad visa available in Greece.\n\nWe will cover a few alternatives later, but this type of visa is unparalleled because it offers a variety of important benefits to digital nomads.\n\nGreece digital nomad visa is valid for 1 year and it comes with perks such as:\n\nYou get a residence permit,\n\nYou can extend the visa for up to 2 years,\n\nYour income taxes are lowered, and\n\nThe processing time for the visa application is just 10 days.\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the details of Greece’s digital nomad visa.\n\nWhat documents do you need to apply for the Greece digital nomad visa?\n\nTo apply for the Greece digital nomad visa, you have to prepare the so-called general supporting documents and some particular documents stated in the Greece Immigration Code from 2022.\n\nTo save you some time, we’ve made a list of all the documents you need to apply for a Greece digital nomad visa:\n\nA valid passport,\n\nThe filled-out visa application form,\n\nProof that you have paid visa and administrative fees,\n\nA recent color ID photograph,\n\nA criminal record certificate,\n\nProof of travel/health insurance that is valid for as long as your issued visa,\n\nA medical certificate proving you do not suffer from a contagious illness that might endanger public health in Greece,\n\nA solemn written declaration where you state that you will not work for companies or employers based in Greece,\n\nAn open-ended contract with a company/client based outside of Greece or a fixed-term contract with a company/client based outside of Greece that is valid for the duration of the issued visa,\n\nInformation about your status and position in the company you work for or — if you are self-employed — your company’s trade name and information about its corporate purpose, field of activity, and registered office, and\n\nA contract of employment or bank statement that proves you have a net income of at least €3,500 (~$3,816.08) per month.\n\nIf you don’t want to experience Greece all on your own, you’ll need to prove you have a slightly higher income:\n\nIf you want your partner to come with you, you’ll need at least 20% higher net income per month — €4,200 (~$4,581.21), and\n\nIf you want your child to join you, you’ll need to earn at least 15% more than that — €4,025 (~$4,390.33).\n\nTherefore, if you have a family of 4 members, you must have a net income of at least €5,250 (~$5,724.13) per month.\n\nAlso, if you have lived in another country — one that is not your country of origin, for more than a year — Greek authorities might ask you to provide an additional criminal record certificate from that country.\n\nIf you don’t have a clean criminal record, that does not mean that Greek authorities will automatically decline your application. They will review your record and, if they find you’re not a threat to national security, they might accept your application.\n\nWho is eligible to apply for Greece’s digital nomad visa?\n\nTo be eligible to apply for a Greece digital nomad visa you have to meet the following criteria:\n\nBe a citizen of a non-EU and non-EEA country,\n\nWork for a company or client registered outside Greece,\n\nHave a net income of at least €3,500 (~$3,816.08) per month, and\n\nHave all of the necessary documentation mentioned above.\n\nAre you eligible if you are a United States citizen?\n\nYes, since the United States is not an EU or EEA country, you are eligible to apply for a Greek digital nomad visa.\n\nHowever, if you have another citizenship of the EU/EEA country, you won’t be eligible for the Greece digital nomad visa.\n\nAre you eligible if you are a US green card holder?\n\nYes, as long as you are not a citizen of an EU or EEA country you are eligible to apply for a Greece digital nomad visa.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that if you stay outside the United States for more than 1 year, you will automatically lose your Green Card, so think carefully before applying for other visas. Waiving your rights to your US Green Card might not be the best move, as getting another one afterward might be tricky.\n\nAre you eligible if you are an EU citizen?\n\nNo, as an EU citizen, you are not eligible to apply for a Greece digital nomad visa.\n\nThe Greek remote work visa is intended only for non-EU and non-EEA citizens.\n\nHowever, digital nomads from EU and EEA countries still have the right to live and work in Greece, provided they register at local police offices.\n\nTo be able to register in Greece and get a temporary residence permit — which is necessary if you stay in Greece for more than 90 days — you need:\n\nTo be employed or self-employed in Greece, or\n\nHave at least €5,000 in your bank account — Greek or foreign.\n\nAre you eligible if you reside in any other country?\n\nYes, provided you are not an EU or EEA country citizen.\n\nBear in mind that you might lose your residence permit in another country if you obtain a Greece digital nomad visa and residence.\n\nHow do I get a digital nomad visa for Greece?\n\nThe process of getting a digital nomad visa for Greece is transparent and simple and it can be broken down into 3 steps:\n\nGather all the necessary documents mentioned above and submit them online (website is currently only available in Greek) or in person to the Greek Diplomatic or Consular Authorities in your country.\n\nWait for a response — the Greek authorities will probably send it to your address within 10 working days of your request.\n\nWhen you receive a positive response from the authorities and obtain a Greek digital nomad visa, go to Greece and register in the city where you want to settle down.\n\nTo register in Greece and get the temporary residence permit, you’d need to visit or arrange a meeting with someone from the local Aliens and Migration Directorate of the Decentralised Administration as soon as you move there.\n\nIf you cannot find the directorate, go to a local police station — the officers there will probably have useful advice or they might even issue you a residence permit on the spot (if they are authorized to do so).\n\nWhat other types of visas suitable for digital nomads does Greece offer?\n\nFor now, there are 3 alternative types of visas for digital nomads who want to come to Greece:\n\nD-Type Visa,\n\nEU Blue Card, and\n\nGreek Golden Visa.\n\nLet’s see what these types of visas have to offer.\n\nType #1: D-type visa\n\nThe D-type visa is a solid alternative for digital nomads who want to stay in Greece for up to 6 months or 1 year.\n\nAccording to the Immigration Code, you can apply for the Greek D-type visa in the following cases:\n\nIf you are a third-country national who needs to provide particular services according to obligations from the contract signed by an undertaking registered in the EU/EEA and a Greek company (Article B.4), or\n\nIf you are a third-country national who needs to install, test, and/or maintain a particular product according to obligations from the supply contract signed by an undertaking registered in the third country and a Greek company (Article B.5).\n\nIf you go to Greece on the basis of Article B.4, you can stay there until you finish the contractual obligations, but that time must not exceed 1 year.\n\nOn the other hand, if you go to Greece for the reasons stated in Article B.5, you can stay for up to 6 months.\n\nIn both cases, you do not get a residence permit.\n\nAs you can see, the D-type visa is for digital nomads who are employed in an undertaking and need to, for example, install/test/maintain a particular software, program, or application.\n\nNaturally, if you are in a dilemma about whether you fulfill the requirements for the D-type visa or not, you or your company should contact the Greek embassy or consular authorities and check if your case is strong enough to obtain the visa.\n\nWhat documents do I need for a Greece D-type visa?\n\nTo get a D-type visa, you’ll have to submit the following general documents:\n\nA valid passport,\n\nThe filled-out visa application form,\n\nProof that you have paid visa and administrative fees — €70 (~$76.35) for the visa fee and €150 (~$163.61) for the administrative fee,\n\nA recent color ID photograph,\n\nA criminal record certificate,\n\nProof of travel/health insurance that is valid for as long as your issued visa is valid for, and\n\nA medical certificate proving you do not suffer from a contagious illness that might endanger public health in Greece.\n\nIf you apply following Article B.4, aside from the documents mentioned above, you’ll also need some specific documentation:\n\nA certified and translated document stating information and contact details of the company for which you, a third-country national, work.\n\nA certified and translated document or contract confirming the arrangement between the company registered in the EU/EEA/third country and a Greek-registered company.\n\nThe contract needs to state:\n\nThe estimated time of your travel to Greece,\n\nWhat you’ll do there,\n\nThe length of your stay,\n\nYour return date, and\n\nProof you have enough funds for subsistence and health insurance.\n\nA health book, a European health insurance card, or some other, equivalent document.\n\nOn the other hand, if you apply in accordance with Article B.5, besides the aforementioned general documents, you need to submit the following documents as well:\n\nA certified and translated document stating information and contact details of the company for which you, the third-country national, work, and\n\nA copy of a supply contract between the undertaking and the company registered in Greece (recipient of the service).\n\nThe supply contract should provide information about:\n\nThe installation, tests, and/or maintenance of the product,\n\nThe length of your stay in the country,\n\nThe number of people assigned to the project,\n\nThe cost of accommodation, and\n\nHealth insurance.\n\nType #2: EU blue card\n\nThe EU Blue Card allows professionals from the countries outside EU and EEA to get a national visa and live and work in EU countries, including Greece.\n\nTherefore, if you don’t want to apply for a Greek digital nomad visa and you often change your place of residence, the EU Blue Card might be a very good choice.\n\nYou can apply for the EU Blue Card if you meet the following conditions:\n\nYou are a citizen of a country that does not belong to the Schengen area.\n\nYou are an expert in the field in which Greece lacks workers, and\n\nYou submitted all of the documents we’ll mention below.\n\nTo get the EU Blue Card, you have to come to Greece and contact the local police office. They will probably direct you to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.\n\nThe EU Blue Card is valid for 2 years, and you can renew it if you submit the same documents mentioned below before your current “card” expires.\n\nWhat documents do I need for the EU blue card?\n\nHere is the list of documents you need to submit for the EU Blue Card:\n\nYour passport,\n\nA recent color ID photograph,\n\nThe filled-out visa application form,\n\nProof that you have paid the visa fee of €180 (~$196.34),\n\nA criminal record certificate,\n\nHigher education certificate or certified proof you have at least 5 years of relevant working experience in your field,\n\nYour work contract with a company that lasts for at least 1 year,\n\nProof that your gross salary will be 1,5 times higher than the average gross salary in Greece — meaning you’ll need to have an annual salary of at least €31,918 (~$34,815.04),\n\nProof of health insurance,\n\nAn authorization issued by the Director-General of Decentralized Administration stating you are a highly qualified professional,\n\nMedical certificate proving you do not suffer from a contagious illness that might endanger public health in Greece, and\n\nIf needed — visas for citizens of the countries that have visa regimes with Greece.\n\nType #3: Greek Golden Visa\n\nThe Greek Golden Visa is for digital nomads who have deeper pockets, but — compared with some other countries’ Golden Visa programs — not so deep.\n\nTo get the Greek Golden visa you’ll need to:\n\nPurchase a property in Greece worth at least €250,000 (~$271,302.5), €400,000 (~$434,084), or €800,000 (~$868,168) depending on the zone in which the property is located in (as of August 31, 2024),\n\nBe a citizen of a non-EU/EEA country,\n\nBe over the age of 18,\n\nHave a clean criminal record, and\n\nHave all of the documents listed below.\n\nAlso, Greek authorities have ensured that owners of its Golden Visa enjoy benefits such as:\n\nResidency valid for 5 years for you and (if you want) your spouse and children,\n\nNo minimum stay requirement,\n\nAbility to rent a purchased property and invest further, and\n\nAccess to Greek healthcare and education systems.\n\nHowever, the huge drawback of this type of visa is that you won’t be able to work, because the Golden Visa isn’t considered a work permit. The only way to work in Greece with this visa is by receiving a CEO or shareholder salary from a Greek company you invest in.\n\nWhat documents do I need for the Greek golden visa?\n\nDocuments you need for the Greek Golden visa depend on whether you have already acquired the property or not.\n\nHowever, for both cases, you’ll need a set of the so-called general documents:\n\nA valid passport,\n\nThe filled-out visa application form,\n\nProof that you have paid visa and administrative fees,\n\nA recent color ID photograph,\n\nA criminal record certificate,\n\nProof of travel/health insurance that is valid for as long as your issued visa is valid for, and\n\nA medical certificate proving you do not suffer from a contagious illness that might endanger public health in Greece.\n\nRegarding the actual property in Greece, you should submit the general documents together with these documents:\n\nA purchase agreement and proof of contract validity from the Greek mortgage/land registry.\n\nA proof of payment of the agreed price — you can pay via crossed cheque or direct money transfer. If you pay by cheque issued by a bank branch in another country, Greek authorities will need some time to verify the payment.\n\nIf you have paid less than €250,000 but the property is worth at least that much or more, you’ll need a notary certificate that confirms that.\n\nA document issued by the Greek mortgage/land registry or real estate agency proving there are no ongoing disputes or impediments between contracting parties.\n\nWhich Greece visa type is best for digital nomads?\n\nThe Greece digital nomad visa is the best option for digital nomads.\n\nThanks to this remote work visa, digital nomads working in Greece can get residence permits and tax reductions. Eventually, they can even become permanent residents of this charming coastal country that has around 6,000 islands.\n\nUnfortunately, the Greek digital nomad visa has slightly higher income requirements than some other countries, so not everyone is eligible to apply for it.\n\nTherefore, the only alternatives would be the D-type visa or the EU Blue Card, due to their lower income requirements.\n\nHowever, the D-type visa that a digital nomad can obtain is only a short-term visa, valid only for 6–12 months, while the EU Blue Card is valid for 2 years, but you cannot get it unless there is an economic need for people of your profession.\n\nAlas, both of the main alternatives have limitations that many digital nomads might not like.\n\nFinally, the fourth type of visa mentioned above — the Greek Golden visa — is for digital nomads who want to make a change, pause their careers, or even retire.\n\nAfter obtaining this type of visa, you cannot work as a digital nomad until you get a permanent residency (after 7 years).\n\nOf course, you can waive the rights to this type of visa at any time by:\n\nCanceling the visa, or\n\nSelling the property thanks to which you have acquired the Greek Golden visa.\n\nCosts you need to consider as a digital nomad in Greece\n\nGreek authorities have introduced a pretty high minimum income requirement for getting a digital nomad visa — €3,500 (~$3,817.68) per month.\n\nWhen you earn that much money, you can live pretty comfortably in almost any European country, especially in Southern and Eastern Europe.\n\nFurthermore, the costs of living in Greece are not so high, which means you might manage to put some money away, as well.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of the most common expenses so that you can calculate your costs of living in Greece.\n\nExpense #1: Accommodation\n\nNaturally, accommodation prices in Greece will vary depending on the location as well as the number of luxury amenities.\n\nIn addition, in bigger cities such as Athens and Thessaloniki and popular tourist destinations like Mykonos, there are far more luxury options available.\n\nIn most cities, you can find an apartment for around €500 (~$545.38) per month, which is not too much if we take into account that the minimum income requirement for Greece is €3,500 (~$3,817.68).\n\nTo give you a clearer picture of the accommodation prices, we have made a list of the average monthly prices of standard 1-bedroom apartments in the most popular Greek cities.\n\nExpense #2: Groceries\n\nPrices of groceries in Greece are moderate, and they are expected to stay like that.\n\nNamely, it seems that Greece’s economy is on the right track after turbulent decades of crisis, and, as a result, the inflation rate in Greece will probably become even lower in the years to come.\n\nConsidering the correlation between inflation and prices, we hope that a lower inflation rate would mean lower prices, as well.\n\nHowever, according to Loukas Lazic, a tour guide who used to live in Greece and still spends a few months a year there, the prices of groceries are not the same in big and small cities:\n\nIn any case, here are the average prices of some of the most commonly bought groceries.\n\nExpense #3: Utilities\n\nUtility prices in Greece are moderate by European standards.\n\nAccording to Eurostat, the official statistical office of the EU, the price of electricity for 2023 in Greece is €0,23 (~$0.25) per 1 kWh. In other words, if you spend 100 kWh monthly, you’ll pay €23 (~$25.09).\n\nHowever, you may spend much more electricity than that, especially if you live with your spouse and children. According to EIA (US Energy Information Administration), an average US household spends around 886 kWh per month.\n\nUnfortunately, there are no official statistics regarding electricity consumption by an average European household, but we believe the results would be more or less similar to those in the US.\n\nThe situation regarding heating depends on how long you’ll have your heating on. Residential heating in Greece starts in October and lasts until April, while in some southern provinces, it might end earlier.\n\nIf you use natural gas for heating, expect to spend between 5000 kWh and 7000 kWh per year for an apartment of 50㎡.\n\nAccording to current prices for natural gas in Greece, it means you’ll have to pay at least €400 (~$436.36) in total for heating during the coldest winter months (November, December, January, and February).\n\nWater bills also vary depending on how much water you use per month.\n\nAccording to statistics, an average person spends 145 liters of water per day, or around 4㎥ per month. Keep in mind that, along with paying for the water you spend, you’ll also have the charges for sewerage and VAT included in your monthly water bill.\n\nFinally, depending on where you live, you might also have to pay taxes for cleaning services or other bills that you should ask about before purchasing or renting the apartment.\n\nExpense #4: Gas and public transportation\n\nHaving a car is a must for all digital nomads who are working in Greece and want to visit all those beautiful cities, beaches, and historical sights during their free time.\n\nHere are the petrol prices in Greece you need to take into account before planning your trip.\n\nOn the other hand, if you live in bigger cities such as Athens or Thessaloniki, you will most likely use public transport.\n\nThe Athens public transport is well-organized and it consists of:\n\nCity buses,\n\nTrolley-buses,\n\nTrams,\n\nMetro, and\n\nSuburban railway.\n\nIf you want to get a monthly or yearly ticket for all means of Athens public transport, you can purchase the ATH.ENA personalized card and its price is €27 (~$29.45) per month or €300 (~$327.27) per year.\n\nThen again, if you need a short-term ticket, the best option would be a single ticket that costs €1.40 (~$1.53) and is valid for 90 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, you can purchase different types of tickets for public transport in any Athens ticket office, ticket machines, or kiosks.\n\nThere are also “non personalized” or anonymous ATH.ENA cards, for which you can check the prices here.\n\nThere are also some other types of tickets you can purchase, and you can get more information about them by visiting the Athens public transport tickets page.\n\nThe Thessaloniki public transport is an effective solution for transport in the second-largest Greek city.\n\nThe public transportation in Thessaloniki currently only has a bus network, but it is expected that the Thessaloniki metro system will be soon introduced.\n\nFor now, the price of a short-term ticket (up to 3 trips within 90 minutes) is €1,30 (~$1.42), while a monthly ticket costs the same as in Athens — €30 (~$32.73) per month.\n\nIf you often travel by bus and prefer an annual ticket, then be prepared to pay €350 (~$381.81).\n\nExpense #5: Bars and restaurants\n\nHomer once said that “wine gives a person fresh strength when they are wearied”.\n\nIf you agree with Homer, you’d probably be interested to see the prices of drinks in Greek bars.\n\nNaturally, prices depend on whether you are having a drink in a bar in Mykonos surrounded by Hollywood stars or a small village near Thessaloniki, but generally, the prices in bars are as you will see below.\n\nIf you like to eat out often, you’ll be happy to hear that Greece has a lot to offer.\n\nCoastal cities in Greece have a long tradition of fishing, so every day fresh fish and seafood are delivered to various restaurants all around the country, so it would be a pity for you to miss out on local fish and seafood specialties.\n\nThe prices of such dishes go from around €35 to even €80 (~$38.18–$87.27) and more per meal if you opt for a fine dining experience.\n\nTraditional food is a huge thing in the whole of Europe, including Greece. The most popular traditional dishes in Greece are gyros, souvlaki (skewers), soutzoukakia, various salads, and soups.\n\nYou can have these specialties in little taverns or street food restaurants (as takeaway) for between €8 and €25 (~$8.73–$27.27).\n\nOf course, you should know that prices in popular tourist spots such as Mykonos and Santorini are slightly higher than the prices we mentioned above.\n\nTherefore, if you want to go to restaurants or bars there, be prepared to break open the piggy bank.\n\nExpense #6: Coworking spaces\n\nAccording to the 2022 Hot Desk Price Index, the average monthly desk price in Greek coworking spaces is around €147 (~$156). In 2024, the prices are mostly similar, and more options are available than in 2022.\n\nNaturally, most coworking spaces are located in Athens because it is the biggest city, and most digital nomads opt to live there.\n\nAthens is followed by Thessaloniki, which currently has around 20 coworking spaces.\n\nUnfortunately, other cities do not have so many coworking spaces, so there’s room for improvement on these fronts.\n\nExpense #7: Internet\n\nThe internet price varies depending on the type of Internet you purchase, and whether you take the double or triple play service (telephone + cable network).\n\nAccording to the latest study about mobile and fixed broadband prices in Europe conducted by the European Commission, the average monthly prices of fixed broadband Internet in Greece are the following.\n\nDo digital nomads pay taxes in Greece?\n\nYes, digital nomads pay taxes in Greece.\n\nHowever, your tax residency status depends on how long you stay in Greece. Tax residency typically involves someone staying in Greece for more than 183 days in a calendar year.\n\nAlso, Greece has double taxation treaties with many countries. This way, you can avoid being taxed for the same income in Greece and your home country. Check with local tax authorities or tax advisors so you don’t have to pay more than you need to.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual amount you’ll be paying, it’s important to mention that the tax system in Greece is progressive — the more you earn, the bigger the tax rate is.\n\nHere is how the tax system in Greece works.\n\nHowever, as a digital nomad in Greece, you have the benefit of paying 50% of the tax rate. In other words, if your annual salary is 50,000€, you will have to pay a 22,5% income tax rate instead of 45%.\n\nIn any case, we strongly recommend you visit a law office or financial advisor specialized in the Greek taxation system to be up to date on the latest tax regulations.\n\nDocuments required for paying taxes in Greece\n\nFirst of all, to pay taxes in Greece, you must have a residence permit.\n\nIf you have a residence permit, the next step is to obtain a Tax Identification Number (in Greek — AFM).\n\nAlthough it is stated that you can get an AFM in the local Internal Revenue Service or Tax Office, it might be easier to get it through a local tax representative.\n\nWhen you eventually acquire your AFM, you need to go to the nearest tax administration office and submit the following documents:\n\nResidency card,\n\nTax Identification Number (AFM),\n\nE1 form (the employees from the tax office will give you this form to fill in), and\n\nIf needed, E2 (for real estate rent) and E3 (for business activity) forms.\n\nThe deadline for submitting your tax return forms is June 30 of the next tax year.\n\nAgain, we strongly recommend getting in touch with tax consultants from Greece, who specialize in the taxation system, so that you can pay your taxes more easily and get information about possible changes in regulations.\n\nWhat are the benefits of being a digital nomad in Greece?\n\nDue to the great quality of life in Greece and the various benefits the country has to offer, a lot of digital nomads opt to move to Greece from all over the world.\n\nWhat are the main reasons that motivate them to choose Greece instead of other countries that also have digital nomad visas?\n\nLet’s see below!\n\nBenefit #1: Great social life\n\nHave you watched the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding? If not, we recommend doing so before moving to Greece.\n\nAlthough the movie is a bit stereotypical, it nicely describes how close-knit the Greek community is.\n\nOur expert Loukas Lazic confirms this statement:\n\nWhen you meet your new Greek friends, you can go to various beaches all around the coast of Greece and enjoy the turquoise clean sea.\n\nGreece is well-known for its amazing nightlife, so you’ll find plenty of great bars and clubs if you enjoy this type of entertainment.\n\nAlso, we recommend supporting the local economy and family-owned restaurants and eating in some of the cozy tavernas you can find in almost every Greek city.\n\nFinally, when your Greek friends cannot hang out with you because they are busy working (Greeks work longer hours than any other Europeans), it is time for sightseeing.\n\nIf we start to name all of the areas and monuments you should visit, we would need to write at least 3 new blog posts, hence, we will mention only a few of them:\n\nAcropolis,\n\nOlympia Archeological Site,\n\nMeteora,\n\nDelphi, and\n\nMykaena.\n\nAll in all, thanks to friendly locals and a lot of historical landmarks, there are a variety of things you can do while living in Greece.\n\nBenefit #2: Moderate cost of living\n\nThe cost of living in Greece is moderate.\n\nIf you live in a 1-bedroom apartment in a bigger city, such as Athens, you can pay your monthly rent and bills and buy groceries for a whole month for around €1,500 (~$1,608).\n\nNaturally, if your spouse and children come with you to Greece, you will need to spend more. A household of 4 members in a bigger city would spend around €2,800 (~$3,054.49) (without rent).\n\nOn the other hand, if you live in smaller cities like Chania, Rethymno, or even Larissa, your expenses will be even lower.\n\nIn any case, wherever you live, with a salary that meets the minimum income requirement for coming to Greece, you’ll have enough money to cover the cost of living.\n\nBenefit #3: Good healthcare system\n\nGreece’s healthcare system is one of the most reputable health systems in the world.\n\nHospitals in bigger cities are good and well-equipped. In rural areas, there are small clinics that are mostly attached to bigger hospitals from nearby cities. Furthermore, every island in Greece has its own clinic and a doctor on call.\n\nThe main advantage of smaller clinics is that you can get your treatment faster, however, if a patient is in a serious condition, it is probable they would send them to the hospital in a larger, nearby city.\n\nIf you need any medicines, you’ll pay 25% of the actual price if you have a prescription.\n\nAs in every European state, there are private and public hospitals.\n\nIf you want to use public hospitals, you need to get a social security card called AMKA, which is available if you pay for a social security program called IKA.\n\nYou can find more information about this on the website of the Social Security Organization of Greece.\n\nOftentimes, private hospitals are organized better and you do not have to wait to get treatment, but of course, it is up to you to choose.\n\nIn any case, we hope you’ll never have a need to go to clinics or hospitals, but in case you need to, you should be safe and sound in Greece.\n\nBenefit #4: Great weather and air quality\n\nGreece has around 2769 sunny hours per year, meaning around 250 sunny days annually.\n\nTherefore, if you love to spend time outside, you’ll love the Greek weather.\n\nJuly and August are the warmest months, and those are also the months when sea temperatures are highest.\n\nThe air quality in Greece is moderate.\n\nIn bigger cities, air quality can deteriorate from time to time and become unhealthy for people sensitive to air pollution.\n\nOn the other hand, according to the available data, in southern Greece, the air quality is almost constantly good.\n\nThe biggest contributors to the occasional deterioration of air quality in Greece are common wildfires caused by climate change and high temperatures.\n\nThe biggest problem with the air quality in Greece is the concentration of particle pollution. The current concentration of PM2,5 in Greece is 3,5 times higher than what the WHO values as good.\n\nTherefore, further improvements are needed in that aspect.\n\nWhat are the drawbacks of being a digital nomad in Greece?\n\nUnfortunately, Greece is not a land flowing with milk and honey. On the contrary, there are some drawbacks we would like to pinpoint.\n\nHere are the main drawbacks of being a digital nomad in Greece.\n\nDrawback #1: Slow internet speed\n\nThe low average internet speed is one of the biggest drawbacks of being a digital nomad in Greece.\n\nLoukas Lazic, who lived in Athens for 19 years, says:\n\nAccording to the report about fixed broadband internet speed, the average upload speed in Greece is just 9.39 Mbps. In comparison, in Spain, for example, the average upload speed is 152.16 Mbps.\n\nAlso, some other reports claim that internet services and digital quality of life in Greece are, in fact, the worst in the EU. Namely, Greece took 28th place in Europe in the Digital Quality of Life Index created by Surfshark. Globally, Greece ranked at 39th place (out of 121).\n\nThe creators of the study ranked the countries according to the following categories:\n\nInternet affordability,\n\nInternet quality,\n\nE-infrastructure,\n\nE-safety, and\n\nE-government.\n\nDue to all of the aforementioned data, we recommend purchasing as fast internet as you can, in order to:\n\nAvoid any potential problems with your internet connection and\n\nEnsure a good speed that matches your needs.\n\nDrawback #2: Bureaucracy and corruption\n\nOne of the biggest problems in Greece is its bureaucracy. That is also one of the main impediments to the more stable economic growth of the country.\n\nUntil the new plan for combating bureaucracy is implemented, digital nomads who live in Greece will have to get used to the effects of cumbersome bureaucracy.\n\nIn researching the materials for this guide, we noticed that, for example, many government e-service websites aren’t yet translated well enough to be fully comprehensible to people who don’t speak Greek. Namely, some pages are in Greek, while some are in English.\n\nThis complicates things for people who want clear and reliable information.\n\nSecondly, we haven’t noticed that you can do many things via e-government services, meaning that in most cases, you’ll have to go in person to get the documents you need or pay the bills.\n\nOne of the main reasons for bad bureaucracy is corruption.\n\nAccording to the Transparency Corruption Perception Index, Greece is in 59th place when it comes to coping with corruption, meaning there is a lot of room for improvement.\n\nHowever, the good news is that Greece has shown signs of improvement, so we are hoping that some future reports will show that the country is corruption-free.\n\n5 best destinations for digital nomads in Greece\n\nHere are the 5 destinations in Greece we believe would be the best choice for the Greece digital nomad visa holders.\n\nAthens — The biggest city in Greece\n\nPopulation: 3,041,131\n\nCity area: 159 mi² (412 km²)\n\nTime zone: UTC+2 (EET); Summer (DST): UTC+3 (EEST)\n\nAverage internet speed: Median download speed 51.94 Mbps/median upload speed 9.78 Mbps\n\nAverage cost of living: Around €1,600 (~$1,737.86) per month (utilities, groceries, and public transport fee without rent)\n\nAverage cost of rent: €450–€800 (~$490.90–$872.71) per month – for one-bedroom apartment\n\nBiggest advantage: A variety of attractions\n\nBiggest drawback: Overtourism\n\nAthens is a city that has started its development in around 1400 BC, and it seems it does not intend to stop.\n\nFor almost 3,500 years, Athenians built many monuments, churches, and temples, and other architectural landmarks that nowadays represent the world’s cultural heritage.\n\nAthens authorities claim that up to 23,000 tourists visit Acropolis every day.\n\nFurthermore, with some innovative cultural projects worth visiting, the city authorities prove their intention to further improve the quality of life in the city and make Athens even more beautiful.\n\nTo live in the city that once was home to Socrates and Plato, you’ll need at least around €1,600 (~$1,617) per month per person.\n\nFor that amount, you’ll be able to rent a 1-bedroom apartment, pay your utility bills, buy enough groceries for the whole month, and even purchase your monthly public transport ticket.\n\nIf you prefer a more social lifestyle, Athens’ bars, clubs, and restaurants are the proper places to go.\n\nYou can start your bar-hopping tour in the streets around the famous Syntagma Square, while during summer, a district called Monastiraki seems to be the best choice.\n\nIf you choose to drive in Athens, prepare for huge traffic jams.\n\nHowever, as we have shown above, public transportation in Athens is well-organized, so you can save yourself some time if you use the metro, bus, or tram.\n\nWhere to work in Athens\n\nAthens has the most coworking spaces in Greece.\n\nHowever, according to Google ratings and the number of reviews, the coworking space called Stone Soup leaves others in the shade (4.9 stars from 204 ratings).\n\nThessaloniki — The best destination for digital nomads in Greece\n\nPopulation: 1,091,424\n\nCity area: 43.12 mi² (111.7 km²)\n\nTime zone: UTC+2 (EET); Summer (DST): UTC+3 (EEST)\n\nAverage internet speed: Median download speed 62.96 Mbps/median upload speed 10.09 Mbps\n\nAverage cost of living: Around €1,350 (~$1472.70) per month (with rent, utilities, groceries, and public transport fee)\n\nAverage cost of rent: €400–€600 (~$440,46–$660,69) per month – for one-bedroom apartments\n\nBiggest advantage: Relatively low cost of living\n\nBiggest drawback: Public transport\n\nThessaloniki is the capital of the geographical region of Macedonia and the second-largest city in Greece.\n\nAlthough it was the important center of Greek culture and industry throughout history, in recent decades, it has been in the shadow of the more popular Athens.\n\nHowever, latter-day initiatives, such as the one for the new innovation park, might turn Thessaloniki into the Greek Silicon Valley.\n\nThere are a lot of things you can see and do in Thessaloniki.\n\nThroughout 2,5 millenniums since the city’s establishment, its rulers and citizens have left various treasures to their descendants — from architectural gems to immaterial cultural heritage.\n\nAs a result, Thessalonians are hospitable and open towards foreigners. You can notice that whenever you go out and visit some of the many local restaurants, bars, and clubs.\n\nThe cost of living is lower than in Athens. If you live alone, around €1,350 (~$1472.70) will cover the basic expenses for a month.\n\nFor example, you can find a beautiful 1-bedroom apartment in Thessaloniki for as much as €600 (~$654.53) and lower. Also, the amount you spend on groceries should be around €64.04 (~$69.97) per week.\n\nThe main problem with Thessaloniki is its public transport because there are only buses currently. However, we hope the metro will be finished within the stipulated deadline by the end of 2024.\n\nAll things considered, Thessaloniki might be the best destination for digital nomads in Greece.\n\nWhere to work in Thessaloniki\n\nAccording to Google ratings and reviews, Coho–the coworking home is a coworking space worth visiting.\n\nIt has a rating of 4.7 out of 5 stars after 90 reviews.\n\nPatras — The coolest city in Greece\n\nPopulation: 314,567\n\nCity area: 48.4 mi² (125.4 km²)\n\nTime zone: UTC+2 (EET); Summer (DST): UTC+3 (EEST)\n\nAverage internet speed: Median download speed 41.27 Mbps/median upload speed 7.25 Mbps\n\nAverage cost of living: Around €900 (~$953) per month (with rent, utilities, groceries, and public transport fee)\n\nAverage cost of rent: €350–€500 (~$327.27–$545.44) per month\n\nBiggest advantage: City’s energy\n\nBiggest drawback: Lack of coworking spaces\n\nPatras is not known for its beauty as much as for the energy you can feel whenever you visit this city.\n\nNamely, Patras University has around 40,000 students, so the city is bustling with youthful energy — it never sleeps.\n\nHowever, that does not mean you cannot rest or sleep peacefully, on the contrary, the city itself is quite peaceful because the nightlife hotspots are mostly on Gerokostopoulou Street.\n\nAlong with the cool city vibe, the cost of living in Greece’s third-largest town is one of the factors that might attract more and more digital nomads in the years to come.\n\nNamely, a new and well-equipped 1-bedroom apartment can be found for around €450 (~$490.90).\n\nIn Patras, you can go everywhere on foot, or you can use their well-organized public transport system.\n\nFurthermore, there are bus lines to nearby villages and settlements that might be good destinations for weekend excursions.\n\nThe bus tickets for one ride are €1,2 (~$1.31) and €1,5 (~$1.64), depending on the city zones you want to go to. On the other hand, monthly tickets are €55 (~$60) and €72 (~$78.54).\n\nAs with almost every Greek town, Patras is full of small family-owned taverns where you can try local specialties for moderate prices.\n\nWhere to work in Patras\n\nUnfortunately, Patras does not have a lot of coworking spaces. In fact, it seems that only 3 coworking spaces are working at the moment, so future improvement in that area is a must.\n\nBe that as it may, POS coworking seems to be the best choice in Patras for now (Google rating of 4.7 after 46 reviews).\n\nRethymno — One of the most beautiful cities in Greece\n\nPopulation: 37,462\n\nMunicipal area: 48.8 mi² (126.5 km²)\n\nTime zone: UTC+2 (EET); Summer (DST): UTC+3 (EEST)\n\nAverage internet speed: Median download speed 46.37 Mbps/median upload speed 7.98 Mbps\n\nAverage cost of living: Around €950 (~$1,005) per month (with rent, utilities, groceries, and public transport fee)\n\nAverage cost of rent: €350–€800 (~$381–$872.71) per month – for one-bedroom apartments\n\nBiggest advantage: One of the most beautiful cities in Greece\n\nBiggest drawback: Only one coworking space\n\nRethymno is one of the biggest and most beautiful cities on the island of Crete.\n\nThe city’s architecture is a mixture of Ancient Greek, Venetian, and Ottoman influences.\n\nIts narrow streets are perfect for digital nomads who like to take strolls after a long workday.\n\nThere are also a lot of small tavernas and fine-dining restaurants where you can try some local specialties for moderate prices (around €12 (~$13.09) per meal).\n\nSince Rethymno has one of the most beautiful ports and citadels in Greece, the authorities see its artistic potential and often organize exhibitions and performances there during summer.\n\nFurthermore, the city has many museums open throughout the year, so we can say that Rethymno is the perfect place for digital nomads who love art.\n\nAccommodation prices in Rethymno are moderate. The average price of a 1-bedroom apartment is around €425 (~$463.63).\n\nBut, why would you spend too much time inside if there is a beautiful 18 km-long sand beach? It’s ideal for families with children because it is well-organized and, most of the time, not crowded with tourists.\n\nFor the city itself, you won’t need any kind of public transport. You can get anywhere you want on foot. However, if you want to visit some nearby Cretean towns or places, you’ll need to go either by car or intercity bus.\n\nAlso, there are 3 airports in Crete, and they, along with ferries, make Rethymno (and the whole of Crete) well-connected to other parts of Greece.\n\nWhere to work in Rethymno\n\nIf you’re looking for coworking space options in Rethymno, your options are limited to only one.\n\nThe one coworking space in Rethymno is called Arlstea Coworking Lounge, which can be found on coworker.com and offers different plans for different needs, and a custom price on request.\n\nThere is also a coworking space called Workhub in the nearest city — Chania (Google rating of 5.0 from 177 reviews). You can go there by car from Rethymno or by regular ferry/intercity bus, however, it’s around 60 km away.\n\nMykonos — One of the most popular destinations in the world\n\nPopulation: 10,134\n\nMunicipal area: 33 mi² (85.5 km²)\n\nTime zone: UTC+2 (EET); Summer (DST): UTC+3 (EEST)\n\nAverage internet speed: Median download speed 47.40 Mbps/median upload speed 8.56 Mbps\n\nAverage cost of living: Around €4,500 (~$4,944) and more per month (with rent, utilities, groceries, and public transport fee)\n\nAverage cost of rent: €2,000 (~$2,181.78) per month\n\nBiggest advantage: One of the most beautiful cities in Greece\n\nBiggest drawback: No coworking spaces\n\nMykonos is one of the most popular and also one of the most expensive destinations in the world. However, taking into account how beautiful Mykonos is, it is understandable why the prices there are so high.\n\nTo enjoy the sunset over the famous white-painted houses in Mykonos from your own rented 1-bedroom apartment, you need to spend on average around €2,000 (~$2181.78) per month. Furthermore, do not be surprised if you see that some near-the-sea apartments in Mykonos are rented for €20,000 (~$21,817.8) or €30,000 (~$32,726.70) per month.\n\nIf you want to go out, be prepared to pay at least around €25 (~$27.27) per meal. On the other hand, prices of a portion of seafood specialties, for example, can be even around €150 (~$163.63).\n\nThe prices in shops are also higher, so you’ll need around €50–€60 (~$54.54–$65.45) for groceries per week if you live alone.\n\nMykonos is well-known for its crazy nightlife, and its clubs and bars aimed at particularly wealthy customers.\n\nMykonos has its own ports and airport, so it is well-connected with other parts of Greece.\n\nOverall, we would recommend Mykonos to digital nomads who earn a good living and plan to work from their own accommodation.\n\nWhere to work in Mykonos\n\nUnfortunately, Mykonos doesn’t have any coworking spaces. Therefore, the only option is to work from your accommodation or cafe.\n\nTips for digital nomads in Greece\n\nLiving in Greece should be a nice experience for everyone who decides to go through the Greece digital nomad visa application process.\n\nNow that you know how to move to Greece, it is important to learn a few tips for living in Greece.\n\nHere are the 4 tips for digital nomads in Greece.\n\nTip #1: Prepare for a direct approach\n\nMost Greeks are used to a direct approach, meaning they will tell you what they think without any hesitation. If you come from a cultural background where it isn’t common to be so direct, this Greek trait might come as a surprise.\n\nNaturally, expect that direct approach only after you become friends with them.\n\nTip #2: Always have some cash in your wallet\n\nIn Greece, cash is still the most dominant payment method. This might be surprising if you come from some of the Western countries where credit cards have been dominant for years now.\n\nBig supermarkets, hotels, and restaurants accept credit cards, but you’ll need cash in some smaller tavernas, markets, or cafes.\n\nIf you get into a situation where you don’t have enough cash, do not worry, there are plenty of ATMs in every Greek city and town.\n\nTip #3: Check the working hours of local shops\n\nGreek shops are usually open in two shifts:\n\nFrom 9:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., and\n\nFrom 5:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m.\n\nThere is a break between the two periods.\n\nHowever, this is just one of the patterns that some Greek shops use. There are some shops that work regularly from 8 a.m. until 5 p.m. It is up to shop owners to decide what their working hours will be.\n\nKiosks and smaller shops in bigger cities often work 24/7.\n\nTip #4: Travel often\n\nWhat do you think about living in one Greek city for a few months and then moving to another?\n\nWell, if you ask Loukas Lazic, our expert, he likes the idea:\n\nAlso, if you have met all of the Greece digital nomad visa requirements and come to Greece to live, it would be a shame not to see at least some of the historical landmarks the country is best known for.\n\nAbove, we have mentioned only a few of them, but literally wherever you go, you’ll find some monuments of great value for Greece and the whole world.\n\nTherefore, conduct your own research, learn about Greek history, and start exploring this amazing country!\n\nFurther reading for digital nomads in Greece\n\nOn the website of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum, you can find more information about local decentralized administration offices. Also, there is contact information, so feel free to address them if you have any questions.\n\nEYDAP — the website of the biggest water supply company in Greece. Check if the building where you live is a part of their system, and if it is, feel free to contact them if you have any questions or problems.\n\nIf you are looking for more information about the Athens public transport tickets, visit the Athens public transport website.\n\nFor all additional information about ticket types and prices in Thessaloniki, we recommend visiting the Thessaloniki Urban Transport website — OASTH.\n\nCoworker is a website where you can find the best coworking spaces near you.\n\nTo get more information about tax regulations, visit the website of the Independent Public Revenue Authority.\n\nIf you are a US citizen, check out the list of tax consultants with favorable reputations created by the US Embassy in Greece.\n\nCrete Bus is one of the biggest intercity bus transportation companies in Crete.\n\nAce your digital nomad Greece workation with Pumble\n\nDeciding to work for several months at a time completely remotely can pose many potential communication challenges for you and your team.
