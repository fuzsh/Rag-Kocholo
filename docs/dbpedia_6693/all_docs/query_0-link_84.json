        "text": "Security level:\n\nIn recent years, street thefts and home robberies are not uncommon. In view of their personal safety, it is advisable for Bulgarian citizens residing in Greece to exercise increased caution and caution when driving in criminogenic areas — usually the central parts of cities, where they can become victims of robbery of personal belongings and documents.\n\nHealthcare:\n\nProviding free medical care in emergencies that threaten the life of the injured person.\n\nSpecifics of the local legislation\n\nCompulsory replacement of Bulgarian vehicle registration plates with Greek registration for all foreign nationals residing in Greece on a long-term basis (more than 3 months in every 6 months).\n\nAfter six months from the initial entry into the country, cars with Bulgarian registration plates must be registered and taxed at the territorial customs office.\n\nThe Greek authorities qualify as permanent residents all Bulgarian citizens who have a tax number or have paid contributions to a local social security institution.\n\nMore information can be found HERE and HERE.\n\nCustoms requirements:\n\nIn view of the increasing cases of sanctioning Bulgarian citizens for violations of the Greek customs code, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends Bulgarian citizens travelling to Greece to respect the strictly allowed quotas for importing excise goods to Greece per person — 4 stacks of cigarettes, 10 litres of hard alcohol, 110 litres of beer and 90 litres of wine. The import of alcohol without a label is not allowed, regardless of the quantity. When the vehicle is checked, it must be clearly stated which of the excise goods is owned by which of the passengers.\n\nCustoms requirements for Greece can be downloaded from HERE.\n\nRoad traffic:\n\nImportant!\n\nA new traffic system is in force in the centre of Athens, which provides for the alternation of cars with even and odd numbers. The Daktylios system, a ring encircling the central part of the city where the measures will apply, stipulates that cars with number plates ending in an even number will be allowed to drive only on even days of the month, while those ending in odd numbers will only be allowed access to the city centre on odd dates. The restrictions are in force until August 2022.\n\nThe measure applies from 07:00 to 20:00 on Monday to Thursday and from 07:00 to 15:00 on Friday.\n\nA fine of EUR 100 will be imposed for infringements.\n\nThe traffic measure in the centre of Athens applies to all vehicles, including those with foreign registration.\n\nThe following vehicles are excluded from the measure: electric and hybrid, gas or propane-butane, but only factory-built, and with Euro 6 emissions below 120 grams of carbon dioxide. Owners of the above can issue a special digital card — a permit for free movement in the city center.\n\nThere are exceptions for trucks and lorries up to 2.2 tonnes, vehicles of doctors and medical staff, disabled people, public organisations and diplomatic missions.\n\nThe country's roads are very well built and maintained.\n\nOver the last year, a number of amendments have been made to the Greek Road Traffic Act, introducing extremely severe penalties for traffic offenders, such as:\n\nAttention!\n\nIf paid within 10 days, the amount of the fine due is reduced by 50% of the amount stated on the receipt.\n\nThe new changes to the Road Traffic Act, which the Greek Parliament is currently debating, foresee even higher penalties, for example for driving without a licence, the penalty could be up to 1 year imprisonment.\n\nAttiki Odos SA, the operator of the eponymous highway in Greece (a 70 km long high-speed bypass of Athens), has announced the introduction of new toll prices for all vehicles operating on the highway (https://en.aodos.gr/).\n\nThe price increase will take place in two phases, with the first price increase taking place from 1 July 2019 and the next from 1 January 2020, according to the following table:\n\nAs of 1 July 2019, the amendments to the Criminal Code (CC) of the Hellenic Republic (4619/2019), voted by the Greek Parliament on 6 June 2019 and promulgated in the Official Gazette on 11 June 2019, enter into force. These changes are the first comprehensive amendments since the codification of the Criminal Code in 1951 and provide for a number of amendments, with a separate chapter on traffic offences. Provisions affecting drivers are set out in Article 290A ‘Dangerous Driving’, which sets out the following penalties:\n\nWhen driving on streets and squares:\n\n(a) a person who drives, failing to do so safely, because of the use of alcohol or drugs or because of physical or mental fatigue, or (b) drives on a national or local road in the oncoming lane, or in pedestrian areas, or on the pavement, or drives a vehicle which is mechanically defective or unsafely overloaded, or drives dangerously or participates in impromptu chases, shall be liable to (unless other provisions provide for more severe penalties):\n\n(aa) imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years or a fine if his actions have caused a public danger to the property of others;\n\n(bb) imprisonment for a term of at least one year if, as a result of his act, danger to a person has resulted;\n\n(cc) by imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years if, in the cases of (a) and (b), his/her act has resulted in serious bodily injury or damage to public facilities;\n\n(dd) by imprisonment in rigorous imprisonment for a term of at least ten years if, in the case of (b), the act results in the death of another person. In the case of causing the death of a large number of people, the court may impose life imprisonment under strict regime.\n\nWhoever drives, under the above conditions, dangerously, recklessly and as a result of his acts a public danger is caused to another's property or person, shall be punished by imprisonment for up to two years or a monetary fine.\n\nIt should be noted that the new provisions of the Criminal Code in question differ from the previous ones by being more specific in defining a greater number of acts qualified as offences under the law and by providing in some cases for imprisonment for a specific maximum term.\n\nThe full text of the new Criminal Code can be found in Greek in the State Gazette No Α΄ 95 of 11 June 2019 (http://www.et.gr/index.php/anazitisi-fek).\n\nFrom 25 October 2021, a new traffic system is in force in the centre of Athens, which provides for the alternation of cars with even and odd numbers. The Daktylios system, a ring encircling the central part of the city where the measures will apply, stipulates that cars with number plates ending in an even number will be allowed to drive only on even days of the month, while those ending in odd numbers will only be allowed access to the city centre on odd dates. The restrictions will be in place until next August.\n\nThe measure applies from 07:00 to 20:00 on Mondays to Thursdays and from 07:00 to 15:00 on Fridays. A fine of EUR 100 will be imposed for infringements.\n\nThe traffic measure in the centre of Athens applies to all vehicles, including those with foreign registration.\n\nThe following vehicles are excluded from the measure: electric and hybrid, gas or propane-butane, but only factory-built, and with Euro 6 emissions below 120 grams of carbon dioxide. Owners of the above can issue a special digital card — a permit for free movement in the city center.\n\nThere are exceptions for cargo vehicles and trucks of up to 2.2 tonnes, cars of doctors and medical staff and disabled people.\n\nPractical advice:\n\nImportant!\n\nA new traffic system is in force in the centre of Athens, which provides for the alternation of cars with even and odd numbers.

Bulgarian citizens should avoid carrying luggage of strangers and transporting strangers in their cars. In this respect, Bulgarian heavy truck drivers are advised to be particularly careful at the ports of exit in Patras and Igoumenitsa.\n\nIn the Hellenic Republic it is prohibited to carry firearms and cold weapons, including carrying them in a car. This rule also includes common use knives with longer blade lengths.\n\nWhen travelling to Greece, Bulgarian citizens should inform themselves in advance about possible strike actions on the territory of the country, as well as about expected difficulties when crossing the border.\n\nAdditional medical insurance is also recommended.\n\nIn the event of an accident, it is mandatory to call the traffic police. In the case of a minor accident, the police may not issue a report but ask the two parties to exchange insurance details. Switching on lights during the day is optional;\n\nThe traffic police impose high fines and compulsory administrative measures for violation of the Road Traffic Act, therefore Bulgarian citizens should very strictly observe the traffic rules and the restrictions.\n\nPermitted quantities of goods per person for personal use when importing into Greece:\n\n— 20 millilitres of e-cigarette liquid\n\n— 13 grams of tobacco blend used in tobacco heating devices /sticks for smokeless devices/\n\n— 3 kg. coffee\n\n— cigarettes — 800 pieces\n\n— cigarillos /no more than 3 grams per cigarillo / — 400 pieces.\n\n— cigars-200 pieces\n\n— loose tobacco — 1 kg\n\n— 10 litres of spirits\n\n— 20 litres of alcohol-enriched wine\n\n— 90 litres of wine, of which up to 60 litres is sparkling.\n\n— 110 litres of beer\n\nHELPFUL TIPS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nFOR A SAFE AND EMERGENCY-FREE HALKIDIKI DISTRICT IN THE SUMMER OF 2023.\n\nА. TIPS FOR VISITING OR STAYING OUT OF YOUR PLACE OF VISITATION (HOTEL, RENTED ROOMS)\n\n• For your safety, always carry your personal documents with you to show to the proper authorities when and if they ask for them and to avoid any unnecessary embarrassment during your vacation. Under no circumstances agree to leave your documents at the reception or with the owner of the tourist establishment where you are staying on the condition that they will be returned to you on departure, as this is not a legal procedure.\n\n• Always make sure you close all doors and windows properly before leaving the place you are staying at. Do not leave only the mesh on the windows, because it can easily be torn. If you notice that any of the windows or doors are not closing or locking due to a technical fault, ask the owner to move you to another room or to fix the fault immediately.\n\n• Attention! Do not leave windows or balcony doors open at night, no matter which floor you are on.\n\n• If you intend to leave the hotel at night, it is a good idea not to leave the lights on outside the door. It's better to leave the TV, radio or indoor light with a switch on if your hotel has one.\n\n• For safety, do not leave your keys hidden under carpets, in pots or on windowsills, but rather carry them with you or hand them in at reception.\n\n• For greater security of your personal property, it is a good idea not to leave money, valuables, electronic devices (laptop, i-pad, digital cameras and cameras, mobile phones, etc.), car keys and personal documents in prominent places in the room. It is advisable to carry them with you. In case the rooms or the reception have a safe, it is better to leave them there.\n\n• For your personal safety, it would be nice if someone close to you knew your schedule and movements.\n\n• In the event that you discover a person or persons entering the place where you are staying in your absence, do not touch any object or enter the room. Call the Halkidiki Police Department (phone number 100) IMMEDIATELY and wait for the police to arrive.\n\n• For the safety of your valuables, it's a good idea not to leave your car doors unlocked and not to leave electronic devices, bags, clothing and other items that could be stolen in conspicuous places inside (on the dashboard, seats, etc.). Better carry them with you or hide them in the trunk.\n\n• During your travel, it's a good idea to avoid the more desolate areas, as well as those with low light, especially during the dark part of the day. If you have to go through such places, make sure you have more people with you.\n\n• To avoid possible theft, it is advisable not to put money, mobile phones and personal documents in your trouser pockets or in the outer pockets of your clothes when you are in a busy place or on public transport. It's a good idea to keep them in a bag that is in front of you and well closed.\n\n• When in restaurants, cafes or bars, do not place mobile phones, wallets, bags or other valuable items on the table. Watch out when you are approached by people selling different things.\n\n• It is preferable to make payments by debit/credit card or by frequently withdrawing small amounts from ATMs. Before making any transaction, it is a good idea to check ATMs for ‘traps’. Also, remember the pin code by heart and never write it down on the card.\n\n• During your stay at the beach, try to keep an eye on your personal belongings at all times and do not park your vehicle in remote or secluded areas.\n\n• If you are subject to verbal or physical aggression from one or more people, do not, under any circumstances, engage in conflict with them. Try to keep a cool head, remember the characteristics of the perpetrators and describe them to the police IMMEDIATELY after you file a complaint. Remember that your life and bodily integrity are your most valuable possessions and you have a duty to protect them.\n\n• For quick resolution of any problem, it is good to have the phones handy to call in case of need (police, fire, hospital, loved ones, etc.).\n\n• If you are the victim of an accident or crime, or if you witness one, do not hesitate to call the Halkidiki Police Emergency Centre (telephone number 100). The Greek police are always close to you, watching out for your safety and for the resolution of any problem or issue that concerns you.\n\nLocal currency:\n\nEuro (EUR)\n\nOthers:\n\nAdvice to Bulgarian citizens who are to visit the Hellenic Republic as tourists\n\nWhen travelling to Greece for tourism purposes, Bulgarian citizens should familiarize themselves in advance with the specifics of visiting Northern Greece and the rest of the country. Specific information and recommendations are contained on the websites of the Embassy of the Republic of Bulgaria in Athens www.mfa.bg/embassies/greece and the Consulate General in Thessaloniki www.mfa.bg/embassies/greecegk.\n\nAdvice to Bulgarian citizens travelling and staying in Greece\n\nThe administrative and organisational structure of the Athens Tourist Police includes a telephone information centre with the telephone number ‘1571’. The call centre provides information — mainly in English, French, Italian and Spanish — and it is possible to transfer the caller to the relevant embassy, travel agency, tour guide or staff in the translation department of the Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be served in their native language.\n\nThe Information Centre provides assistance in the following cases:\n\n— presentation of all forms of tourism in Greece (conference, rural, sports, sea, therapeutic/medical, ecotourism, etc.), by providing all kinds of information related to the travel and stay of tourists (hotels, accommodation, transport, tours, archaeological sites, museums, beaches, ski centres, travel agencies, car rental, relaxation, etc.);\n\n— providing general information on taxis, fares, 24-hour pharmacies, hospitals, gas stations, small and large road junctions, ferry schedules, public transportation, currency exchange, etc.;\n\n— providing instructions or solutions to various complaints and problems encountered by foreign and domestic tourists, usually related to poor quality services, inappropriate behaviour of the staff of tourist organizations, violations of the agreed price, refusal to schedule a room, missing items and belongings from a hotel room, etc.;\n\n— services and event recommendations to the National Greek Tourism Organisation (social tourism, festivals, etc.);\n\n— promotion of the tasks of the Greek Police and other public organizations and structures (port and fire agencies, health services, local authorities, Chamber of Hoteliers, Athens and Attica Region Hotel Owners Association, O.S.E., O.A.S., etc.);\n\n— reporting complaints or information about drugs, wanted persons and other crimes to the relevant security services to take up the cases;\n\n— providing legal information on tourism legislation and general issues.\n\nIn view of the increased sanctions against Bulgarian citizens travelling or residing in Greece for illegal possession of weapons, mainly knives and self-defence aids (guns, spray cans, etc.), our citizens should bear in mind the differences in the legislation of the two countries in the field of acquisition, storage, carrying and use of weapons in Greece.\n\nGreek law (Act 2168/1993), unlike Bulgarian law, defines as a weapon any object and any device suitable for attack and defence, which may cause injury and/or damage to health or property, including fire.\n\nIt is prohibited in Greece to import and possess, except with the appropriate authorisation of the Ministry of Public Order and Citizen Protection /ΥΠΟΥΡΓΕΙΟ ΔΗΜΟΣΙΑΣ ΤΑΞΗΣ ΚΑΙ ΠΡΟΣΤΑΣΙΑΣ ΤΟΥ ΠΟΛΙΤΗ/:\n\nshort-barrel weapons /guns/ firearms and non-firearms, regardless of the type of projectile, which may be gunpowder, chemical substances, rays, gases, etc.;\n\nhunting weapons;\n\nair weapons;\n\nmechanisms and devices for launching any agent, chemical /spray/ or energy release;\n\nknives of any kind, except those whose use is justified in the home and office, for educational purposes, in art, hunting and fishing or other similar uses. In the long-standing practice of the Greek police authorities, it has been accepted that knives with a blade length of more than 7—10 cm are considered as weapons within the meaning of Act 2168/1993 and the carrying and possession of such weapons without a proper permit is subject to the penalties provided for in the law. However, there is no language in the law that explicitly ties the length of the blade to the designation or non-designation of a knife as a weapon. In practice, any knife that is not intended for the uses allowed by law (household, office, hunting and fishing), even if its blade is less than 7 cm, could be defined as a weapon. What matters in this case is the specific use of the knife. Proving this specific use, however, often involves appealing the sanction already imposed by the police authorities in court, which takes time and funds for Bulgarian citizens. In the case of a declaration of use for hunting or fishing, this shall be evidenced by an appropriate authorisation issued by a competent authority in Greece.\n\nmetal maces, clubs, nunjako with chain or rope;\n\nspears, swords, daggers, bayonets, bows, crossbows and police batons;\n\nobjects or devices used to launch substances that are self-igniting or contain irritant chemical agents intended for offensive and defensive use;\n\nweapons for fishing, harpoons, etc. that shoot a sharp metal object;\n\nsilencers, viewfinders, sights, shooting simulators, spare parts and accessories for weapons;\n\nimitation firearms, if they can be converted into functioning ones.\n\nThe following do not fall under the restrictive regime of Act 2168/1993:\n\nfirearms manufactured before 01 January 1870, provided that they cannot fire ammunition intended for weapons for the possession of which a permit is required.\n\ncollector's arms which were manufactured before 01 January 1922 and which are kept in special shops or commercial collections.\n\nNo import permit is required under Act 2168/1993 on:\n\nchemical spraying mechanisms for domestic or professional use;\n\nknives used in the home and office, for educational purposes, in art, hunting and fishing or other similar uses.\n\nExceptionally, the Minister of Public Order and Citizen Protection may authorize the import, distribution, possession and use of devices mechanisms and devices for the launching of any means, chemicals /sprays/ or release of energy."
