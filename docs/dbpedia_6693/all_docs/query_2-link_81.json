        "text": "Altair’s example answers why Greece has never manufactured cars. What was it that the Americans saw and… landed in Thessaloniki.\n\nIf someone was looking for answers and was constantly expressing his discontent over Greece’s failure to develop heavy industry and manufacture cars, a company based in both Thessaloniki and 49 other countries in the world is the most convincing answer. The reason is that this company proves that when a country does not have a heavy industry, it can develop research and staff to become indispensable in heavy industry on a global scale.\n\nThe arrival of Altair, which is of American interests, a few years ago in Thessaloniki and the Balkan Center, was accompanied by a number of critical remarks, which, among other things, were questioning this choice. Typical is the example of one of the company executives from America, who was afraid that he was in danger of being kidnapped upon his arrival in Thessaloniki. The reality, however, was completely different to his first impression for the city of Thessaloniki as well as for Greece more broadly.\n\n‘‘We decided to choose a specialist to come to Greece for a year and train our staff. Once he arrived in Greece, he believed that he was in danger of being kidnapped or mugged.The defamation that Greece was receiving was similar to Cambodia or Mexico according to him. He had a change of mind when he saw that everything was rumours told by people that had never visited our country. Within six months he decided to settle permanently in Greece, selling his house in America. He now intends to invest in real estate as well as in other sectors’’\n\n‘‘Everyone thought we were mad when we said that we would settle in Thessaloniki’’\n\nAs the Altair’s Chief of Technology, Lazaros Tsioraklidis, has told Voria.gr, ‘‘when Altair announced that it was investing in Thessaloniki six years ago, the US businesses considered us to be crazy for investing in this particular city. Today, US companies with a turnover of more than $ 1 billion annually have directed their attention here, realising that they have lost six years of opportunities and investment in Greece’’.\n\n‘‘As executives of Altair, we have been noticing for many years that a number of Greek engineers and computer programmers are employed by our customers in key positions. We have visited automotive industries and seen many Greek employees. When you see highly skilled people coming from a non-industrial country like Greece, it means that not only do the Greeks emigrate but also have a way to become indispensable in the countries where they are settled. They are well-trained because of Greece’s system. A Greek is examined in all classes of high school to obtain his diploma, thus is constantly tested. Altair has observed that Greece’s workforce had considerable specialization. Given that I also had business experience in the country by already having another company in Thessaloniki, we made the decision to start a business here. All the advisers that we turned to, were arguing that we are heading towards destruction for sure. However, amid the financial crisis, in 2011, we chose to take the first step and disprove everyone’’.\n\nThe decision to settle in Thessaloniki, which has shown significant activity in recent years, was a right choice. It is the city where the Alexander Innovation Zone is being developed, hosting innovative businesses, each in its field.\n\nSpecial software production for large industries\n\nIts scope is related to the production of special software. What the executives of the parent company perceived and chose to come to Greece was the fact that our country has scientific personnel of recognized value and training so that it can expand its research activity. Altair found in Greece the cradle of scientists who take the decision to go abroad to work having completed their studies."
