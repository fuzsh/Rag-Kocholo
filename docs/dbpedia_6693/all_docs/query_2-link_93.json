        "text": "Thessaloniki is a lively city in northern Greece on the eastern coast of the Thermaic Gulf. As Greece’s second-largest city, it has a rich history, iconic landmarks, and a busy urban centre. Its position makes it a significant hub in the region, connecting the mainland and the neighbouring countries. Parking in Thessaloniki operates under specific rules and regulations. The city is divided into various parking zones marked with colour-coded lines or signs. Blue zones are designated for short-term parking, while yellow zones offer medium-term parking options. Visitors and residents must adhere to these guidelines to avoid violations and fines.\n\nWhen it comes to finding parking spots in Thessaloniki, there are several options available. Popular areas, including the city centre, offer street parking, although limited due to high demand. Additionally, dedicated parking garages and lots are scattered throughout the city, providing more secure and long-term parking solutions. Parking spaces are available for those visiting the city’s beaches but might come with their own rules or fees depending on the specific location. Various tools can prove useful for individuals seeking assistance in locating available parking spaces. Mobile parking applications are popular tools for finding real-time parking availability, costs, and restrictions. These apps often allow users to pay directly, offering a convenient solution for drivers. Additionally, asking locals or visiting tourist information centres can provide valuable insights into less-known parking spots or areas where parking is easier during specific times.\n\nAs for the cost of parking in Thessaloniki, parking spaces are not universally free. The city has implemented paid parking systems in several zones to manage traffic and ensure the smooth flow of vehicles. The average hourly fee for street parking typically falls between €1 to €2, though prices can vary based on the specific area and time. It’s always recommended for drivers to check local signage and apps for accurate pricing before parking.\n\nWhere is Thessaloniki?\n\nThessaloniki is 502 kilometres (312 miles) to the north of Athens, the capital of Greece. It is a major city in northern Greece, located on the eastern coast of the Thermaic Gulf. Thessaloniki’s urban area spans approximately 30 kilometres (19 miles) from Oraiokastro in the north to Thermi in the south, extending toward Chalkidiki. Mount Chortiatis borders Thessaloniki to the southeast, and its location near mountain ranges, hills, and fault lines has historically made it susceptible to seismic activity.\n\nTo the west of Thessaloniki lies the city of Katerini, approximately 68 kilometres (42 miles) away. Katerini is a popular destination known for its beautiful beaches along the Thermaic Gulf and as a gateway to Mount Olympus, Greece’s highest mountain. In the north, Thessaloniki is relatively close to Veria, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) away. Veria is known for its well-preserved Byzantine and Ottoman-era architecture. It’s also culturally important due to its connection to early Christianity. To the east of Thessaloniki is the region of Chalkidiki, known for its stunning beaches, clear waters, and villages. The closest part of Chalkidiki, the Kassandra Peninsula, is just around 70 kilometres (43 miles) from Thessaloniki. This area is a popular summer destination for both locals and tourists.\n\nThessaloniki is served by Thessaloniki Airport (SKG), which is located 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of the city centre. This airport, also known as “Macedonia International Airport,” is the primary gateway for air travellers to and from the region. It offers domestic and international flights, making it convenient for travellers coming to Thessaloniki from various destinations. Another option for travellers is the Kavala International Airport (KVA), located further east, 170 kilometres (106 miles) from Thessaloniki. While this airport is farther away from the city, it can be considered an alternative for those exploring eastern parts of northern Greece or nearby locations like Kavala. Additionally, Sofia in Bulgaria has an international airport, Sofia Airport (SOF), about 300 kilometres (186 miles) north of Thessaloniki. Although it’s more distant, it could be a choice for travellers looking for alternative routes into the region. However, Thessaloniki Airport remains the primary and most convenient airport for accessing the city and its surroundings.\n\nHow Far is the Airport to Thessaloniki?\n\nThessaloniki’s primary airport is Thessaloniki Airport (SKG), also known as “Macedonia International Airport.” The airport is approximately 15 kilometres (9 miles) southwest of the city centre. For travellers in Heraklion who wish to reach Thessaloniki Airport, one of the most straightforward ways is to take a flight from Heraklion International Airport (HER), also known as “Nikos Kazantzakis Airport.” Numerous direct flights connect these two cities, and the flight duration is typically over an hour. Booking in advance often results in more choices and potentially lower fares.\n\nUpon landing at Thessaloniki Airport, multiple transportation options exist to reach the city centre. Buses are a popular and economical choice. The city’s bus service, OASTH, operates the No. X1 route, which connects the airport with the central railway station. The bus journey takes around 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. For those who prefer a more private mode of transport, taxis are readily available at the airport. The trip by taxi to the city centre usually takes about 20 to 30 minutes, depending on traffic. There’s a designated taxi queue outside the arrivals hall, and rates are standardised, although it’s still a good practice to ask for an estimated fare before starting the journey. Additionally, Thessaloniki car rentals are available at the airport for travellers who prefer to drive themselves. It provides flexibility and might suit those planning to explore more than just the city. The drive to the city centre is straightforward, mainly along the A25 and A2 highways.\n\nWhat are the Rules for Parking in Thessaloniki?\n\nListed below are the rules for parking in Thessaloniki:\n\nParking Zones: Thessaloniki has designated parking zones, each with different time limits and tariffs.
