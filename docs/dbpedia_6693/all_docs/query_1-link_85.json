        "text": "Rules for the registration and lodging of applications\n\nArticle 69 of the Asylum Code transposes Article 6 of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive on access to the procedure.\n\nAs outlined below, Greek law refers to simple registration (απλή καταγραφή) to describe the notion of “registration” and full registration (πλήρης καταγραφή) to describe the notion of “lodging” of an application for international protection under the Directive.\n\nRegistration of applications for international protection (“Καταγραφή”)\n\nArticle 69(1) of the Asylum Code provides that any foreigner or stateless person has the right to “make” an application for international protection. The application is submitted before the competent receiving authorities, i.e., the Regional Asylum Offices (RAO), the Autonomous Asylum Units (AAU) or the Mobile Asylum Units of the Asylum Service or the Regional Reception and Identification Services,[1] depending on their local jurisdiction, which shall immediately proceed with the “full registration” (πλήρης καταγραφή) of the application.\n\nFollowing the “full registration” of the asylum claim,[2] the application for international protection is considered to be lodged (κατατεθειμένη).[3]\n\nThe Asylum Code provides that such full registration shall take place no more than 15 working days from the time of simple registration. More precisely, according to the Asylum Code, where “for whatever reason” full registration is not possible, following a decision of the Director of the Asylum Service, the Receiving Authorities may conduct a “simple registration” (απλή καταγραφή) of the asylum seeker’s necessary details within 3 working days, and then proceed to the full registration by way of priority within a period of not exceeding 15 working days from “simple registration”.[4] In such a case, upon “basic registration”, the applicant receives a document indicating his or her personal details and a photograph, to be replaced by the International Protection Applicant Card when their full registration is eventually carried out, i.e., upon the lodging of the full application.[5]\n\nAccording to the Asylum Code, if the application is submitted before a non-competent authority, that authority is obliged to promptly notify the competent receiving authority and refer the applicant thereto.[6] An asylum application will not be considered properly lodged until it is fully registered by the Asylum Service, as the competent authority.\n\nFor third-country nationals willing to apply for asylum while in detention, the competent Detention Authorities shall ensure the immediate preparation and submission of a written declaration to that effect, following which the detention authority must register (simple registration) the application on an electronic network connected to the Asylum Service within three working days.[7]\n\nMoreover, according to the Asylum Code, the lodging of the application with the Receiving Authorities must be carried out within seven working days after the “basic registration” by the detention authority or the RIS.[8] In order for the application to be fully registered, the detainee is transferred to the competent RAO or AAU.[9]\n\nLodging of applications (“Κατάθεση”)\n\nNo time limit is set by law for lodging an asylum application. However, Article 83 of the Asylum Code transposes Article 13 of the recast Asylum Procedures Directive that refers to applicants’ obligations and foresees that applicants are required to appear before competent authorities in person, without delay, in order to submit their application for international protection.\n\nApplications must be lodged in person,[10] except under force majeure conditions.[11] According to the Asylum Code, the lodging of the application must contain inter alia the personal details of the applicant and the full reasons for seeking international protection.[12]\n\nAs a general rule, the Asylum Code provides that the asylum seeker’s card, which is provided to all persons who have been fully registered, i.e., lodged their application, is valid for 1 year, which can be renewed as long as the examination is pending.[13] However, the Asylum Code provides for a number of cases where the asylum seeker’s card can be valid for shorter periods. Thus, the validity of an asylum seeker’s card can be set for a period:\n\nNo longer than 3 months, where the applicant belongs to a nationality with a recognition rate lower than 35% in accordance with the official EU statistics and by taking into consideration the period for the issuance of a first instance decision expected;[14]\n\nNo longer than 30 days, where the communication of a decision or a transfer on the basis of the Dublin Regulation is imminent;[15]\n\nNo longer than 30 days, where the application is examined “under absolute priority” or “under priority”, under the accelerated procedure, under Art. 84 (inadmissible) or under the border procedure.[16]\n\nIn 2022, the Asylum Service registered 37,362 applications for international protection, mainly lodged by Afghans (5.624) and Syrians (5.050).[17] In 2023, the Asylum Service registered 64,212 applications for international protection, mainly lodged by Syrian (21.8%), Afghan (14.8%), Palestinian (10.5%) and Iraqi (10.1%) nationals.[18]\n\nRole of EUAA (previously EASO) in registration[19]\n\nEUAA (previously EASO) deploys Registration Assistants to support the Greek Asylum Service in charge of registration across the territory. Registration Assistants are almost exclusively locally recruited interim staff, notably because citizenship is required for access to the database managed by the police (Αλκυόνη) which is used by the Asylum Service.\n\nIn 2023, the number of registrations carried out by the EUAA in Greece increased to 35,723 applications for international protection. Of these, 83% related to the top 10 citizenships of applicants and in particular Syrians (8,802), Afghans (5,202), Iraqis (4,380), Palestinians (4,377), Pakistanis (1,847), Somalis (1,705), and Egyptians (1,199).[20]\n\nAccess to the procedure on the mainland\n\nAccess to the asylum procedure remained a structural and endemic problem in Greece for many years. Difficulties with regard to access to the asylum procedure have been observed since the very start of the operation of the Asylum Service in 2013, in particular due to Asylum Service staff shortages and the non-operation of all RAO provided by law. A previous system for granting appointments for registration of asylum applications existed since 2014 through Skype, but proved inefficient to adequately allow access of persons applying for asylum to the procedure. Deficiencies in the Skype appointment system stemmed from limited capacity and availability of interpretation, and barriers to applicants’ access to the internet. Consequently, prospective asylum seekers frequently had to try multiple times (often over a period of several months) before they managed to get through to the Skype line to obtain an appointment for the full registration of their application, while they remained undocumented and, therefore, were facing the danger of a potential arrest and detention by the police. They were deprived of the assistance to which they are entitled as asylum seekers, including reception conditions and in particular, access to housing.[21]\n\nOn 13 July 2022, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum operationalised a new online platform for the booking of appointments for lodging an initial asylum application in person for asylum seekers in Greece, which, as noted in several national Court decisions in cases represented by GCR,[22] is tantamount to confirming a person’s will to apply for asylum. The procedure applies to all third country nationals arriving in Greece and wishing to claim asylum, as well as for those already residing in Greece and who have not been through reception and identification procedures. The platform is available in twelve languages (Greek, Kurmanji, Albanian, Georgian, Arabic, Bengali, Dari, English, Farsi, Pashto, Turkish and Urdu), and after applicants have provided their personal information, they are asked to choose one of two registration facilities: in Diavata (Thessaloniki) or Malakasa (Attica). Once the electronic form is completed, a registration appointment would be assigned to the applicant and communicated via email. The first appointments took place on 1 September 2022, and it is understood that the facilities reached full capacity on the same day.[23] Between December 2023 and 23 June 2023, a total of 10,756 pre-registrations took place via the platform.[24] Data from 23 June onwards are not available, as noted,[25] on account of “the upgrade of the computer system carried out by the Services of the Ministry of Immigration and Asylum”.\n\nThe appointment process mandates a de facto detention period of maximum 25 days in order for the procedure to be completed, restricting the freedom of movement of those who have registered for asylum. Pursuant to Article 8 of the EU Reception Conditions Directive (RCD), Member States ‘shall not hold a person in detention for the sole reason that he or she is an applicant for international protection’.[26] Despite this, the new platform uses de facto detention as the status quo for the registration of an asylum application, violating the RCD’s conditions of exceptional implementation. During this de facto detention period, asylum seekers complete their asylum interview and wait for the first instance decision on their case.\n\nIn addition, there have been reports of an irregular distribution of appointments and extensive delays of appointment dates, with several appointments being assigned over twelve months after the initial pre-registration application was submitted.[27] In many cases, appointments were not available at all, further highlighting the lack of capacity of the facilities and resources available, forcing people to remain undocumented for extensive periods of time, without basic medical care, accommodation or essential services.\n\nConsequently, the issues that existed during the previous Skype pre-registration system persist, where people are forced into a legal limbo without any official documentation or legal status and remain unsupported by appropriate structures to provide for their essential needs.\n\nAccess to the procedure from administrative detention\n\nAccess to the asylum procedure for individuals detained for the purpose of removal is highly problematic. The application of a detained person having expressed his or her wish to apply for asylum is registered with delay. The person remains detained between the expression of the intention to seek asylum and the registration of the application, by virtue of a removal order. He is deprived of any of the procedural guarantees provided to asylum seekers,[28] despite the fact that according to Greek law, any individual who expresses the intention to lodge an application for international protection is an asylum seeker. Since the waiting period between expression of intention and registration is not counted in the Duration of Detention, asylum seekers may be detained for a total period exceeding the maximum detention time limit for asylum seekers.[29]\n\nThe findings of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in 2019 are still valid:[30]\n\n‘many detainees did not understand their right to apply for asylum and the corresponding procedure, with some individuals incorrectly believing that the process was initiated when they were fingerprinted. There was no established scheme for providing legal aid during the first-instance asylum application, and interpretation was not consistently provided, with asylum seekers relying on second-hand information from fellow applicants. The Working Group was informed that no information was provided by the police to detainees on their right to apply for international protection or on the procedural stages, and that such information was provided by non-governmental actors only.”\n\nThe time period between the expression of intention to apply for asylum and the registration varies depending on the circumstances of each case, and in particular, the capacity of the competent authority, the availability of interpretation, and the number of people wishing to apply for asylum from detention.\n\n[1] Article of Asylum Code.\n\n[2] Article 69(1) of Asylum Code.\n\n[3] Article 69(3) of Asylum Code.\n\n[4] Article 69(2) of Asylum Code.\n\n[5] Ibid.\n\n[6] Article 69(9) of Asylum Code.\n\n[7] Article 69(7) (b) of Asylum Code.\n\n[8] Ibid.\n\n[9] Ibid.\n\n[10] Article 83(3) of Asylum Code.\n\n[11] Article 83(4) of Asylum Code.\n\n[12] Article 69(1) of Asylum Code.\n\n[13] Article 75 (1) of Asylum Code.\n\n[14] Article 75 (2) of Asylum Code.\n\n[15] Article 75 (3) of Asylum Code.\n\n[16] Article 75 (4) of Asylum Code.\n\n[17] Information published by the Asylum Service 31 December 2022, available in Greek at: https://bit.ly/41W5ZsN.\n\n[18] MoMA, Statistics, Consolidated Reports – Overview: December 2023 – International Protection | Appendix A, available at: https://tinyurl.com/yc2stzh7, table 8a.\n\n[19] It should be noted that Regulation 2021/2023 entered into force on 19 January 2022, transforming EASO into the EU Agency for Asylum (EUAA).\n\n[20] Information provided by the EUAA, 26 February 2024.\n\n[21] For more, inter alia, see AIDA, Country Report Greece: 2020 Update, June 2021, available at: https://bit.ly/3BWlPJ3.\n\n[22] Indicatively, ΔΠρΚαβ. 164/2023, ΜΠρΑθ 1524/2023 and ΔΠρΚομ ΑΠ163/2023.\n\n[23] Statement published by Mobile Info Team, New asylum seeker registration procedure begins today and is already at capacity: People will be forced to remain undocumented for 14 months as they wait for an appointment in Diavata or Malakasa, 1 September 2022, available at: https://bit.ly/3NzpMKj.\n\n[24] MoMA, Statistics, Consolidated Reports – Overview: December 2023 – International Protection | Appendix A, available at: https://tinyurl.com/yc2stzh7, table 7a.\n\n[25] Ibid.\n\n[26] Article 8 (1) RCD\n\n[27] GCR, Oxfam, Save the Children, Greece // Bimonthly Bulletin on Refugees and Migrants, October 2022, available at: https://bit.ly/3BQxgSE.\n\n[28] Global Detention Project & Greek Council for Refugees, Joint Submission to the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention in Preparation for its Mission to Greece in December 2019, Submitted in October 2019, available at: https://bit.ly/2TRYmna.\n\n[29] Communication from the UNHCR in the M.S.S. and Rahimi groups v.
