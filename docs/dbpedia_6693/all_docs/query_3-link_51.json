        "text": "Kalispera!\n\nIf you have had the car more than 6 months when you arrive it is duty free, otherwise you have to pay import tax\n\nYou can then use the car for up to a year on Greek plates, but you have to get Swiss plates and have your vehicle checked by the authorities before the 12 months is up.\n\nI have just been through the process with a UK registered car.\n\nGiasou....\n\nI did the same with my car, I had it for a year and then took it back to Greece in order to sell it.\n\nIf I were you I would bring it for convinience for the first few months but then send it back toi Greece and sell it. You will alo need to change your Greek licence to a Swiss after 1 year but this is quite easy.\n\nCars are a lot cheaper here than in Greece, when you sell up you can buy a better car here.\n\nAnd what better way todo so then with a Swiss car\n\nDo yourself a favor and buy a car here , no problem with \" ow we can't get the parts \" and all the trouble.\n\nSome car dealers ( bigger ones) speak English too , if there is money to be earned they try\n\nAnd as a bonus,you can try your brand new German on them.\n\nLearning while doing is the best..thats how i improved my German in the last months\n\nHave a safe trip, and welcome soon to Switzerland.\n\nBut you didn't go out to buy a car then did you\n\nI found(depending on the area of course) that if you ask them friendly, they will try their very best to speak english, certainly when money is involved.\n\nI'm just lucky to have a German Girlfriend then again if i need something during the day, i have to try and speak German myself and so far so good.\n\nNothing works better then throwing you in the deep end.\n\nWhere do you want to live in Switzerland? check out the local lingo, French,Italian or German and start a language course,it will help you.\n\nGood luck again and if we don't speak again before the new year, have a good one"
