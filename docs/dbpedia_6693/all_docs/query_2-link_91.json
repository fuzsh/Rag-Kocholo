        "text": "14 December 2016\n\nHits: 32824\n\nUseful Information\n\nMoving Arround - Local Transportation\n\nThe ideal way of discovering Thessaloniki is on foot, as it is an absolutely walkable city. Visit the Old Town, the center of the town, the port and of course the Waterfront and Nea Paralia with the great sunset views. These are only a few of the many places in Thessaloniki one can discover on foot and a really great way to spend your day.\n\nBus Public Transport (OASTH): Taking a bus is the best way to move inside the city except when visiting the Upper Town (\"Ano Poli\") and the Castles area. You can buy a ticket for a single route (1,00€ /0.50€ for students), a 70 minute two-ride ticket (1.20€/ 0.60€ for students), a 90 minute three-ride ticket (1,50€ / 0,80€) or a 120 minute 4-ride ticket (2,00€/1,00€).\n\nTickets can be bought at the outlets of OASTH (Organization of Urban Transportation of Thessaloniki city) and the kiosks scattered all around the city (“períptera\" in greek). You can also buy a ticket from an automatic vendor inside the bus, with slightly higher fares – be sure to keep in mind that the automatic vendor doesn't give back change.\n\nFor a more complete experience, we recommend you using the Cultural Transfer Line of OASTH, which will enable you to visit some of the major tourist attractions of Thessaloniki (2,00€/1,00€).\n\nTaxi: Taxi service in Thessaloniki is plentiful and economic. Taxis can easily be found everywhere in the city, the city airport, port and railway station. Taxis are available at most hotels or can easily be ordered by hotel reception staff. Taxi companies operate 24-hour call centers, ready to receive your order or make an advance booking for you.\n\nMinimum taxi fare is 3,10 € [ A double fare is applicable at night (24:00 – 05:00)]. Most taxis currently use satellite navigator systems that facilitate a fast and easy transfer to any destination in the city.\n\nBicycle: Discover Thessaloniki by means of riding a bicycle! City touring becomes even more enjoyable through a network of bicycle lanes bearing the special marking! The bike sharing system in the Municipality of Thessaloniki, named I-BIKE, of THESSBIKE company, holds eight stations and a fleet of 200 bicycles, including two seat, four seat, electric bikes and vehicles for the handicapped. Another company in the field of renting bikes is BikeIT, based in Nea Paralia of Thessaloniki, where you can select from a wide range of bicycle types.\n\nTime and Currency\n\nGreece belongs to the Eastern-European time zone and it is two hours (+2) ahead of Greenwich Time.\n\nGreece is a Member-State of the European Union and uses its uniform currency – the Euro.\n\nCurrency exchange rates are clearly displayed in every bank that accepts currency exchange, while credit card holders may acquire money from the ATMs of the collaborating banks. Greek banks are open for the public from 8:00 to 14:30 Mondays to Thursdays and from 8:00 to 13:30 on Fridays. They are closed on Public Holidays.\n\nEuros can also be exchanged for notes of other foreign currencies at exchange offices that are situated at the airport and certain main ports, in the larger cities, as well as at many tourist destinations. A passport is required when exchanging currencies.\n\nLanguage\n\nThe national official language is Greek. However most of the people speak and understand other languages like English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.\n\nWeather & Climate\n\nThessaloniki enjoys a typical Mediterranean climate, with its location in northern Greece resulting in the region receiving more rain than other areas of the country, and seeing lower temperatures during the winter. Summers in Thessaloniki are generally hot and dry, and the area receives an abundance of sunshine even during the low season. July and August are the hottest months, with temperatures reaching an average of 27C, and the sun shining for over 10 hours a day. The summer frequently sees highs of 30C, however these very hot days are cooled by the strong winds that blow from the north, which begin in June and start to die down in September.\n\nShopping\n\nYou should definitely visit Tsimiski Avenue in the city center. It is by far the most popular commercial street of Thessaloniki with hundreds of fashion stores and boutiques. Many famous brands have their local outlets there. A good alternative would be \"Mitropoleos\" st. located on the south of Tsimiski Avenue.\n\nThe shops’ opening hours are not pre-determined.\n\nIn general terms, the regular shopping hours on weekdays are 09:00 – 21:00 and Saturdays 09:00 – 15:00.\n\nMalls and big stores operate:\n\nMonday-Friday: 09:00 – 21:00\n\nSaturday: 09:00 – 18:00 or 20:00\n\nShops, boutiques and other commercial markets, operate:\n\nMonday/ Wednesday/ Saturday: 09:00 – 15:00\n\nTuesday/ Thursday/Friday: 09:00 – 14:30 and 17:30 – 21:00\n\nHealth & Safety\n\nIn order to have access to necessary health care, tourists from member states of the European Union (EU) wishing to visit Greece must be holders of the European Health Card (EHIC) or any other legal Community document issued by their competent social security agency. You can find more information about the EHIC here.\n\nIn these cases, the necessary treatment in Greece is provided by:\n\nthe IKA (Social Security Institute) Health Units (polyclinics) or doctor's offices in the region;\n\nRegional clinics (former rural clinics) or the Health Centres of the National Health System; and\n\nthe outpatients' departments of the hospitals on contract\n\nIn order to have access to necessary health care, tourists from countries other than the member states of the European Union wishing to visit Greece must consult their social security agency for information before travelling.\n\nUseful Phone Numbers\n\nThessaloniki area code (30) 2310\n\nEuropean Emergency Number 112\n\nPolice 100\n\nTourist Police (+30) 2310554874\n\nFire Department 199\n\nAmbulance 166\n\nSOS Doctors : 1016\n\nDuty Hospitals and Clinics: 1434\n\nPharmacies: 1434\n\nRailway Customer Service Centre 14511\n\nUrban Transportation 11085\n\nIntercity coaches (+30) 2310595400\n\nTAXI 18300, 18180, 18288\n\nAirport (+30) 2310985000\n\nTelephone directory enquiries - Local 11888\n\nTime 14844\n\nTheatres & cinemas 1422\n\nInternet Access and free WiFi spots\n\nThere is a big number of Internet cafes which provide Internet access at reasonable prices.\n\nFree WiFi spots: http://free-wifi.gr/en/find-free-hotspots/thessalonikis\n\nElectrical Plug/Outlet and Voltage\n\nVoltage: 220-240 Volts (U.S./Canada are 110-120 Volts)\n\nPrimary Socket Type: Europlug, Schuko\n\nMulti-voltage appliances (laptops, etc.): Plug adapter\n\nClick socket type links to view adapter for that type\n\n110-120V electronics: Plug adapter + step-down transformer\n\nHair dryers, curling irons, etc.: Plug adapter + voltage converter\n\nabout thessaloniki\n\n14 December 2016\n\nHits: 28655\n\nArround Thessaloniki\n\nThessaloniki is surrounded by extraordinary landscapes and locations that can inspire every visitor with their natural beauty.\n\nThe north part of the city is covered by woods on the hill slopes, while in the district of Polichni in the North-East, there are six watermills still standing since Byzantine times, reflecting pre-industrial technology. Further on in the same direction, Mount Chortiatis is a wonderful destination for a day outdoors. In the southern part of the city, there is the organized marina of Aretsou, a convenient and pleasant mooring spot for recreational craft, an ideal starting point for a trip to Halkidiki or the quaint islands of the Vories Sporades. Thermaikos Gulf and the picturesque beaches of Perea, Nei Epivates and Agia Triada, are the traditional privileged resorts for holiday- makers from Greece and abroad, as they are easily accessible by road along the gulf coastline, forming indeed two green zones for the city.\n\nIn the South-East, along the gulf, stands Mt. Olympus in its divine grandeur, home of the ancient deities, with its unique flora. According to Homer, on the peak of Mt. Olympus stood Zeus’ palace, the roof of which (the sky dome) was made of copper and stretched over the whole of the earth. At the feet of Mt. Olympus, in the city of Dion, the Macedonians erected their temples to worship their gods.Archaeological excavations unearthed Zeus’ temple, part of the old city, the baths, its theatres, etc. A visit to the site can be combinedwith a relaxing excursion to the white, sandy beaches of Pieria or to other beautiful destinations nearby.\n\nPella, the ancient capital of the Macedonian state, where Alexander the Great was born and reigned, is another archaeological – and not only – site. The ruins of Alexander the Great’s palace are there, within whichone can admire exquisite mosaics of greathistorical significance.\n\nVergina, an ancient city of world acclaim due to its famous royal tombs of the 4th century B.C. and its model archaeological museum,is a site where one can admire, next to the remains of King Philip II, precious exhibits reflecting the wealth, grandeur and glory of the Macedonian Kingdom.\n\nTo the South-East of Thessaloniki lies Halkidiki, a charming peninsula ending in three fingers, famous for its wonderful beaches, tiny islands and small bays. Visitors can find almost everything they desire there. Of specialinterest is the prehistoric cave of Petralona, replete with stalagmites and stalactites, where the fossilized skull of Archanthropus,dating to 200,000 B.C., was found. Furthermore,one can visit archaeological sites at Olynthos, Potidea, Stagira and Toroni, or any of the local villages. Nightlife in the big resorts is particularly inviting.\n\nAn opportunity open only to male visitors is an excursion to the third finger of Halkidiki Peninsula, which for more than a thousand years, has been the territory of the Greek Monastic State of “Mt. Athos”, the residence of monks of various orders. This is a unique land containing invaluable items and treasures of incalculable historical value. There is no doubt that despite its cosmopolitan atmosphere, Halkidiki can well provide moments ofincomparable relaxation.\n\nabout thessaloniki\n\n14 December 2016\n\nHits: 38271\n\nGetting to Thessaloniki and away\n\nTransport Options by Air\n\nThessaloniki’s airport, Macedonia (SKG), accommodates frequent flights from national and international destinations. From there you can reach the city by bus, taxi, or using Private transportation directly to your hotel. If you prefer using public transportation, there are two bus routes available that connect the airport to the city center; Buses No 78 and 78N. Bus 78 runs half-hourly from the airport, heading west through the city to the main bus station (KTEL Makedonia) via the train station. Tickets cost €2 from the airport to the bus station; €1.10 for short journeys. Taxis to the airport cost €15 to €20, even more from midnight until 5am.\n\nLand Transport options\n\nDomestic Buses\n\nThessaloniki’s main bus station, KTEL Makedonia, is 3km west of the centre. Each destination has its own specific ticket counter, signposted in Greek and English.\n\nFor Athens only, avoid the trip by going instead to Monastiriou bus station – an easy-to-miss office opposite the train station – where Athens-bound buses start before calling in at KTEL Makedonia. Additional discounts to regular fares apply for kids, students, special-needs travellers, retirees and soldiers (well, Greek ones, anyway). Travellers can leave luggage at KTEL Makedonia (€1 to €7 for 24 hours).\n\nBuses leave for Halkidiki from the eastern Thessaloniki Halkidiki bus terminal. The terminal is out towards the airport, reached via city buses 45A or 45B. From the main bus station, buses stop en route at the train station and Plateia Aristotelous. With waiting time and traffic, this 'express' service to the bus terminal can take more than an hour. Then there's the trip to Halkidiki itself. The whole production can take three to six hours. It's wiser to rent a car for your entire Halkidiki trip or at least take a taxi (€10 to €15) to Halkidiki bus terminal.\n\nDomestic Trains\n\nDirect trains serve Athens (€55.40, 5¼ hours, seven daily), Litohoro (€9, one hour, 10 daily) and Larisa (€14 to €21, two hours, 15 daily). Several daily trains serve Veria, Edessa and Florina (mostly via Platy). Only two daily trains currently serve Xanthi, Komotini and Alexandroupoli in Thrace.\n\nThessaloniki’s train station has ill-kept downstairs toilets, ATMs, a post office, card phones and small modern eateries, plus an Orthodox chapel. Self-serve luggage storage lockers start from €3. Additionally, a staffed luggage storage room (€3 per item per day) operates until 10pm daily – show your train ticket when depositing luggage.\n\nabout thessaloniki\n\n14 December 2016\n\nHits: 28301\n\nScents, Flavors & Nightlife\n\nThessaloniki is a famous destination for every food lover because of the wide variety of options available. After a flavor trip throughout the city you will realize that this is the point where West meets East! Traditional Greek cuisine along with many Balkan and Eastern influences will offer you a unique dining experience. These wonderful mix of so many recipes and flavors along with the traditional cuisines is what makes this city unique when you are hungry!\n\nMany traditional taverns can be found all over the city, especially in places like Upper Town or Athonos Sq,. Some more sophisticated restaurants can be found at the well known Ladadika, while in certain areas like Kalamaria you'll have the chance to enjoy fresh fish and seafood as well as famous Greek dishes and international cuisine.\n\nIf you are interested in exploring the Greek fast food culture you will discover that it is incredibly rich and delicious! Apart from the traditional Bagels, you should definitely try Mpougatsa for breakfast. Mpougatsa is a delicious sweet pie filled with cream and served with flour sugar and cinnamon. It's the perfect way to start your day (along with coffee of course...) . You can continue your gastronomic journey later by trying the traditional Gyros or Souvlaki which can be found in every corner of the city!\n\nLast but not least, the city has some of the most famous bakeries and patisseries in Greece! Be sure to check the triangular cream filled pastry called Trigona Panoramatos and of course the beloved Tsoureki which is a sweet, egg enriched bread offered in countless variations like filled with chestnut cream and covered in white chocolate! Of course this is just the beginning. There are way too many sweet creations available inspired from Ottoman, refugee or traditional Greek recipes!\n\nIf you think that everyone in Thessaloniki is rushing somewhere all day, just wait until nightfall. It seems like everyone in town tops at a favorite cafe on the way home from work and then heads out to dinner -- this, before or after taking in a play or concert at one of the city's many theaters, concert halls, and nightclubs and ars with live entertainment. Though many publications list events and posters splattered everywhere announce them, almost all will all be Greek to you.\n\nAsk for information at your hotel. Thessaloniki boasts great nightlife during those long months when more famous Greek destinations are deep in hibernation.\n\nMeanwhile, the city seems festooned with enough bars and clubs to serve a population twice its size, yet all of them are crowded to the bursting point -- and more open every year. For some of the liveliest nightlife in town, try one of the cafes in the waterfront Ladidika district, or along the harbour and the shoreline on Nikis Street, or head inland to Athoonos Square, or sample the cafes on pedestrianised Zefxidos and Iktinos streets. Mitropoleos street and the narrow streets around as well as the area around White tower has a lot to offer to night fun lovers.\n\nPlenty of night spots that best embodies this special entertainment vibe that only Thessaloniki got, cafes, bars, music spaces and galleries all in one, home to quirky experimental acts, from ambient pop to electronica. Many go-to spots for Thessaloniki's hard-partying artistic set.\n\nDemetria Festival -- October 26, St. Dimitrios's day is celebrated all over Greece, but in Thessaloniki, the celebration lasts for weeks. The festival, which gets bigger every year, now includes many theatrical and musical events.\n\nThe International Film Festival draws hoards of film buffs to the city every November. Thessaloniki hosted twice the Biennale of the young artists of the Mediterranean countries and 2011 WOMEX (World Music Expo) left a mark Best of all, get a local with similar tastes to give you some tips."
