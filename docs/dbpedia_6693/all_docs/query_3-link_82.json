The new plates carry the EU flag and the country designator on the left.\n\nThese markings are printed to order in any scale required and specific registration numbers may be specified so that modellers may recreate in scale any vehicle they wish. The relevant MOT stickers may also be specified for each plate.\n\nThe table below shows the minimum charge for the most popular scales. For other scale please enquire via email. Also shown in the table are the number of registration plate pairs that can be ordered for the minimum charge."
