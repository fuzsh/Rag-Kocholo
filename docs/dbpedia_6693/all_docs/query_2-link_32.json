        "text": "History\n\nPre-20th Century History\n\nThe Republic of North Macedonia occupies one part (so called Vardar Macedonia) of the historical and geographical region of Macedonia (nowadays split between Macedonia, Greece and Bulgaria). For the last 10,000 years the entire region has been the cradle of many ancient civilizations, including the first European Neolithic farmers, Ancient Macedonians, Paeonians, Illyrians, and Thracians. In 357 BC Philip II of Macedon conquered the entire region and it remained part of the Macedonian Kingdom until the Roman conquest in 145 BC, when Macedonia was turned to Roman province. After the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD the region became part of the Eastern Roman Empire. Between 4th and 6th AD the countryside and many wealthy cities of Roman Macedonia suffered from Gothic, Hun, and Avar invasions.\n\nIn the 7th century AD, Slav tribes settled here and through their dominance changed the area culturally and ethnically. In the 9th century, the region was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire. Later, in the 970s, Ohrid became the capital of the First Bulgarian Empire after the Byzantines and Russians devastated the eastern regions of the country and plundered the former Bulgarian capital of Preslav. Even today Ohrid has special significance as an ecclesiastical and cultural centre for the entire Slavic World. The Byzantine Empire managed to take control over the area again in 1018. A long period followed in which Macedonia was passed back and forth between Byzantium, Bulgaria and Serbia. In the late fourteenth century, Macedonia became part of the Ottoman Empire, and the cultural identity of the region changed once again.\n\nModern History\n\nAs a result of the Russian victory over the Ottoman Empire and the establishment of an independent Bulgarian state, in 1878 North Macedonia was ceded to Bulgaria by the Treaty of San Stefano. The Great Powers, fearing the creation of a powerful Russian satellite in the heart of the Balkans, forced Bulgaria to return North Macedonia to the Ottoman Empire. In the subsequent period, the Macedonian struggle for independence began, which culminated with the Ilinden uprising on August 2, 1903. The uprising was brutally suppressed by Ottoman troops. The First Balkan War in 1912 brought Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia and Montenegro together for the liberation of those areas of the Balkans which still remained under Ottoman control. They managed to defeat the Ottomans, but disagreements among the allies led to the Second Balkan War in 1913, when Greece and Serbia ousted the Bulgarians and split the greater part of North Macedonia between them. In hopes of liberating North Macedonia, Bulgaria fought on the losing sides in World War One (1915-1918) and World War Two (1940-1945). As a defeated power, Bulgaria had to return the region twice (after each war) to the winners, Greece and Yugoslavia and was not able to defend its diasporic population from assimilation policies.\n\nIn 1944, North Macedonia was constituted as are public in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The Macedonian language was codified in 1944 based on the Prilep-Bitola dialect. The modern Macedonian language still remains closely related to and shares a high degree of mutual intelligibility with the Bulgarian language, although this tie is rejected by the political concept of Macedonism (created in the first half of 20th century by Comintern). Macedonian is also related to a certain extent to the Serbo-Croatian language (due to Serbian and Yugoslav political supremacy over Vardar Macedonia between 1912and 1992). The first Macedonian grammar was published in 1952. On September 8, 1991, a referendum on independence was held in North Macedonia and 74% voted in favour. Thus, in January of 1992, the country declared its full independence from the Former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe processes of democratization and economic transition, though successful, were long and hard, and now the country is on its way to membership in NATO and the European Union.\n\nThe Name Dispute With Greece\n\nGreece has delayed diplomatic recognition of Macedonia by demanding that the country find another name, alleging that the term “Macedonia” implies territorial claims on northern Greece. Greece is worried that if the Macedonians use the term “Macedonia,” they may aspire to lay claim to all of ancient Macedonia, which included (and still includes) parts of Greece. At the insistence of Greek officials, Macedonia was forced to use the “temporary” title of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) for the purpose of being admitted to the United Nations in April of 1993.\n\nAfter vacillating for two years, six of the EU countries established diplomatic relations with Macedonia in December of 1993, despite strong objections from Greece, and in February of 1994 the United States also recognized Macedonia.\n\nIn response, Greece declared an economic embargo against Macedonia and closed the port of Thessaloniki to the country’s trade. The embargo was lifted in November of 1995 after Macedonia changed its flag and agreed to enter into discussions with Greece about the name of the country. Shortly after these discussions were made, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov was almost assassinated in a car bombing. To date, a final resolution of this thorny issue has been reached by the adoption of the name \"North Macedonia\".\n\nTravel Basics\n\nWeather\n\nModerate continental climate influenced by surrounding mountains dominates in Stobi and the area, making springtime refreshingly cool and rainy (15-25 C, 60-77 F). Occasionally lower temperatures may occur, but August could also be surprisingly hot (up to 40-45 C; 100 – 110 F).\n\nFood & Drinks\n\nMacedonian cuisine tends to be oriented toward meat and potatoes, but vegetarians needn’t worry as several of the more popular dishes are dairy-based and in general Macedonians consume a lot of salads (the most popular is shopska salad, a tasty mix of tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and occasionally roasted peppers, topped by white brined sheep cheese). Another distinctive salad is taratur, consisting of dense yogurt, cucumbers and garlic. Among the most flavorful meat and vegetable dishes are those baked in covered clay pots, such as Turlitava. A popular snack and breakfast item is burek, baked pastry filled with cheese (and sometimes leeks or spinach), washed down by boza, a non-alcoholic malted beverage that dates back several centuries. Macedonian wines are internationally renowned and one of the country’s prime exports. Macedonian beer is also noteworthy, such as Skopsko, Zlaten Dab. The national spirit, rakia, is a fiery brandy ritually consumed with a variety of appetizers (meze). Most popular drinks among young people when go out are beer, vodka, wine and cocktails.\n\nTravel\n\nBy Plane:\n\nNorth Macedonia has two international airports, so if you come by plane you should arrive in Skopje (90 km from Stobi) or Ohrid (169 km from Stobi). So you can take a bus or taxi to the bus - or railway station but it is recommended to request a Balkan Heritage organized pick-up due to unreasonable taxi prices from the airports to the downtowns (50 EUR or more for a single ride, app. 15 km).\n\nAirports in North Macedonia:\n\nwww.airports.com.mk\n\nOhrid Airport\n\nAddress: Ohrid “St. Paul The Apostle” Airport P.O.Box 134 Ohrid 6000, North Macedonia\n\nTelephone: +389 (46) 25 28 30\n\nFax: +389 (46) 25 28 40\n\nE-mail: [email protected]; [email protected]\n\nSkopje Airport\n\nAddress: Skopje Alexander the Great Airport 1043, Petrovec - North Macedonia\n\nTelephone: +389 (2) 3148 333\n\nFax: +389 (2) 3148 777\n\nE-mail: [email protected]\n\nYou can also choose to fly to the Thessaloniki International Airport “Makedonia”,in Greece.
