The seminar will be followed by the IMRF’s Annual Meeting on 27-28 November at the same venue. The EDI Seminar is open to both members and non-members, with a registration fee applicable for attendance. You can now register at: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/annual-meeting-and-edi. You can register for the IMRF Annual Meeting using the same registration form as for the EDI Seminar. Please scroll down for the EDI Seminar agenda and the speakers.\n\nFollowing the success of the #WomenInSAR conference in Finland in 2022 and drawing from the insights gained at the World Maritime Rescue Congress, the IMRF’s next focused objective is promoting EDI. EDI in maritime SAR is vital for ensuring the safety and well-being of all individuals at sea. Incorporating EDI principles into SAR operations contributes to a more effective and responsive system.\n\nPurpose: The purpose of the IMRF's Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Seminar is to foster a more inclusive and equitable approach to maritime SAR.\n\nWhy? Like any organisation, it is essential that SAR organisations are representative of the communities they serve and aim to reach. Many SAR organisations also find that recruiting and retaining staff and volunteers can be challenging. As a sector, there are a number of ways we can work together to address this and ensure our sector is open to all.\n\nAim of this EDI Seminar: Our first EDI seminar aims to explore the importance of EDI in the context of maritime SAR and promote best practices to ensure safety, fairness, and respect for every member of the SAR community. By bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders, including SAR professionals and EDI advocates, the seminar marks the beginning of a sector-wide dialogue by creating a platform for meaningful discussions and knowledge-sharing on this topic. The event is designed to inspire and empower SAR organisations to integrate EDI principles into their operations, ultimately creating a more effective, responsive, and safer SAR service.\n\nAim of the IMRF's EDI Project: The seminar is part of the broader IMRF EDI project, with ongoing activities planned for 2025 to continue the momentum and deepen the engagement with EDI topics. The goal is to build a network of organisations committed to EDI, promoting safety and facilitating collaborative and innovative solutions that drive positive change in the maritime SAR community. The IMRF aims to create a lasting impact, helping SAR organisations evolve into more inclusive, respectful, and diverse environments that better serve the needs of their communities and those in need of assistance in the world’s waters.\n\nHelp us create an understanding of the current state of EDI in the SAR organisations by taking our survey here: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/imrf-edi2024. Survey results will be discussed at the seminar and will help shape our agenda. We encourage your active participation as we work together to make our sector inclusive to all!\n\nDates:26 November 2024.\n\nLocation:Grand Hotel Palace, Thessaloniki, Greece\n\nCost: Members £175, Non-Members £250.\n\nAgenda\n\nTuesday 26 November\n\n08:00 Registration Opens\n\n09:00 Opening Remarks\n\nCaroline Jupe, CEO, IMRF\n\nPhil Bostock, Head of International Liaison, HM Coastguard\n\nCia Sjöstedt, Trustee, IMRF (Chair of the Seminar)\n\nPersonal Experience of EDI and Why EDI Should be Promoted in Maritime SAR (Caroline Jupe)\n\n09:30 Equality, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EEDI), a Global Challenge (David Mosimabale, Senior Transformation Change Manager)\n\n09:50 Where Are We Now – Reflections from the IMRF EDI Survey (Jaakko Heikkilä)\n\n10:10 Pre-Networking Session\n\n10:20 Networking Break\n\n10:40 EDI Global SAR Community Case Studies\n\nEDI in HM Coastguard, UK (Phil Bostock, Head of International Liaison, HM Coastguard)\n\nEDI in Africa (Captain Mohammed Drissi, Head of Moroccan SAR Service)\n\nEDI in Marine Rescue NSW (Alex Barrell, Commissioner, Marine Rescue NSW & Darren Schott, Deputy Commissioner, Marine Rescue NSW)\n\nPanel Discussion\n\n11:50 Workshop 1: EDI in SAR Organisations (Phil Bostock & Jaakko Heikkilä)\n\nThis workshop will explore the practices of EDI in SAR Organisations.\n\n12:30 Lunch\n\n13:30 Summary of Workshop 1\n\n14:10 Highlights and Learnings from the Indigenous and Remote Communities SAR Workshop (Caroline Jupe)\n\n14:20 Workshop 2: Dismantling Barriers to Inclusion (David Mosimabale, Senior Transformation Change Manager)\n\nThis workshop will explore practical ways to overcome obstacles to inclusion.\n\n15:00 Networking Break\n\n15:30 Summary of Workshop 2\n\n16:00 Reflections on the Seminar (Jaakko Heikkilä)\n\n16:15 IMRF Plans for EDI 2025- (Jaakko Heikkilä)\n\n16:30 Concluding Remarks (Cia Sjöstedt)\n\n16:45 Close of Seminar\n\nSpeakers\n\nAccommodation\n\nYou are free to choose any of the local hotels.
