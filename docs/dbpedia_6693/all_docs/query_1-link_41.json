        "text": "National taxes\n\nTax is a complex topic. Your own tax obligations can vary based on your particular circumstances, so we recommend that you research your obligations or consult a tax professional to get more specific information.\n\nIn general, the money you earn as a Host on Airbnb is considered taxable income which may be subject to different taxes like rental tax, income tax, or VAT.\n\nTax forms for Greece are due by 30 June each tax year. Check with the Directorate General for Taxation of the Hellenic Ministry of Finance to find out if you need to declare the amount you earn from hosting, which you can find in your host earnings summary. It’s also a good idea to find out if you’re eligible for other credits like tax reliefs and allowances.\n\nDAC7 - EU Data Sharing\n\nDAC7 references the EU Council Directive 2021/514, which requires online companies such as Airbnb to collect and report taxpayer information on certain platform users who earn income on the Airbnb platform. If you have a listing for a property located within one of the 27 EU Member States or you are resident in an EU Member State, DAC7 impacts you.\n\nA person is “resident” for DAC7 purposes in a country in which the person has their primary address and, in addition, any other country in which the person has been issued with a tax identification number (TIN).\n\nCheck out our FAQ page for more information about how Airbnb shares tax data.\n\nFree tax guide\n\nWe want to make it easy for you to understand your tax responsibilities as a Host on Airbnb, so we’ve partnered with an independent third-party accounting firm to provide a free tax guide (available in Greek and English) that covers general tax information in Greece.\n\nData sharing for tax purposes\n\nAccording to Article 29 of the Law 4646/2019, approved on December 6, 2019, the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (IAPR) can request online platforms to provide information concerning individuals who use the platforms to sell goods or provide services, for which tax obligations arise in Greece.\n\nWhat specific personal information is Airbnb required to be shared with the IAPR pursuant to Article 29?\n\nAirbnb will share the following data, to the extent available:\n\nProperty registration number\n\nTaxpayer ID number\n\nIdentification of the Host: first and last name, passport number, date of birth\n\nE-mail address\n\nPhone number\n\nProperty identification: URL, complete address, type of property\n\nIncome data: gross income generated during the previous year for each listing, means of payment, payment account and payment provider.\n\nHow will my information be used by the IAPR?\n\nEU & EEA Tax authorities are subject to strict privacy laws, and usually will only be entitled to use and share that data for the purposes of fulfilling their responsibilities set out in local laws. Those responsibilities typically include assessment and enforcement of taxes, recovery of unpaid taxes, enforcing anti money laundering laws, and ensuring the State social security system is aware of a tax payers' earnings.\n\nHow often will my information be reported to the tax authorities?\n\nThe report is due by the end of February every year.\n\nI am not the owner of the listing. Is this applicable to me?\n\nYes. The obligation to share data refers to both property owners and property managers of the relevant listing.\n\nWhat if I do not have a personal Tax ID or VAT ID number?\n\nReceiving rental income from properties located in Greece means you have an obligation to pay tax in Greece. As a result, you are entitled to receive such tax ID from the IAPR. Your tax ID number can be found on tax documents such as “Tax Completeness Status” or “Tax Refund Status”.\n\nFurther information on Greek tax ID can be found on the website of the General Secretariat of Information Systems (GSIS).\n\nIf I didn’t confirm my tax details in my listing and profile, will Airbnb share my data? What personal data will Airbnb share?\n\nWe will share the current information that we have about you and your listing such as your name, start date of reservation, etc., with the IAPR, except in cases where you have reported an exemption from Greek Law applicable to your listing(s).\n\nIf you don’t confirm your tax details or add any additional information in your profile or listing, Airbnb will share the information included in your profile and listing as is.\n\nIf I make a request to delete my Airbnb account now, will my information be shared?\n\nYes. You can make a deletion request, but it’s important to note that we will not delete the personal data we are required to report to the Greek tax authorities until after we have complied with our legal obligations under Article 29.\n\nDAC7 references the EU Council Directive 2021/514, which requires online companies such as Airbnb to collect and report taxpayer information on certain platform users who earn income on the Airbnb platform. If you have a listing for a property located within one of the 27 EU Member States or you are resident in an EU Member State, DAC7 impacts you.\n\nA person is “resident” for DAC7 purposes in a country in which the person has their primary address and, in addition, any other country in which the person has been issued with a tax identification number (TIN).\n\nCheck out our FAQ page for more information about how Airbnb shares tax data.\n\nBack to top\n\nRegulations and permissions\n\nIt’s important to make sure you’re allowed to host on your property. Some examples of restrictions include contracts, laws, and community rules. Check with a lawyer or local authority to learn more about regulations, restrictions, and obligations specific to your circumstances.\n\nThe information below is not legal advice, but you can use it as a starting point around hosting regulations and permissions.\n\nWhat is the current law in Greece around short-term rentals?\n\nGreece implemented regulations for short term rentals leased in the context of a sharing economy platform through Article 111 of Law 4446/2016 and its implementing acts. Greek law defines a short term rental as the lease of a real estate property concluded ra rental of property completed through digital platforms for a specified period of less than one year, where no other services are offered except for furnished lodging and bed sheets.\n\nAccording to Greek law, a real estate property is defined as an apartment, a house, or any other form of building with structural and functional autonomy, as well as rooms in apartments or detached houses.\n\nAny person, whether a citizen or a company, who manages a property used for short term rental purposes is defined by law as a short term leasehold property manager, who may be the owner of the property, the sub-lessor, the usufructuary, or even a third party.\n\nRegistration for short-term rental properties\n\nBefore you can rent out your home to paying guests, you must register your property on the Short-Term Residence Register held by the IAPR and obtain a registration number (“AMA”) to be disclosed in a prominent and clear manner in the relevant listing. Remember also to submit the Short-Term Residence Declaration by the 20th of each month following the check-out of the guest. You can access the application to register your property and submit your declaration here.\n\nIn the case of co-hosting or co-ownership, which are subject to additional rules and obligations, we suggest that you contact your local councilor or tax consultant for further guidance.\n\nWhat if I'm listing a licensed hotel, bed & breakfast, or other tourist accommodation?\n\nTourist accommodations have their own legal regime (Articles 1 to 74 of Law 4276/2014, and Article 46 of Law 4179/2013 and Law 4442/2016) and are not subject to the provisions of Greek law on short term rentals within the framework of the sharing economy. If you have a tourist accommodation, you are not required to register in the Short-Term Residence Register but you will need to obtain a special operating license (ESL / MAG number), which will need to be displayed in a clear and prominent manner in the relevant listing.\n\nWhere should I include my property registration number (AMA, ESL or MAG)?\n\nAirbnb signed an agreement with IAPR aiming at establishing a simple, transparent and effective compliance procedure for the registration system in Greece. Commencing June 1st, 2021, any new listing posted on Airbnb will be required to include their property registration number (AMA, ESL or MAG) in Airbnb’s mandatory dedicated field or alternatively confirm they are exempted.\n\nHow do I know if my listing is exempt?\n\nYour listing might be exempt for two reasons:\n\nYou are exempt from the obligation to obtain a property registration number (AMA) under the Greek short-term rental law, for example because you're a public entity or your listing is a Mount Athos monastery.\n\nYour listing does not qualify as a real estate property, for example because it’s a boat, a tent, RV, or another temporary construction.\n\nIn case of any doubt, we suggest that you contact your local councilor or tax consultant for further guidance.\n\nContractual agreements and permits\n\nSometimes leases, contracts, building regulations, and community rules have restrictions against subletting or hosting. Review any contracts you’ve signed or contact your landlord, community council, or other authority.\n\nYou might be able to add an addendum to your lease or contract that can provide clarity about concerns, responsibilities, and liabilities for all parties.\n\nMortgage restrictions\n\nIf your property has a mortgage (or any form of loan), check with the lender to make sure that there aren’t restrictions against subletting or hosting.\n\nSubsidized housing restrictions\n\nSubsidized housing usually has rules that prohibit subletting without permission. Check with your housing authority or housing association if you live in a subsidized housing community and are interested in becoming a host.\n\nHousemates\n\nIf you share your home with others, consider making a formal agreement with your housemates in order to outline expectations. Housemate agreements can include how often you plan to host, guest etiquette, whether you'll share revenue, and more.\n\nEU consumer protection law\n\nAccording to EU consumer protection law, when you commercially offer goods or services online, you’re required to provide your customers with specific information. When you host through Airbnb, it’s considered a service. We have information and tools to help you decide whether you should identify as a hospitality expert and understand your responsibility to protect consumers in the EU.\n\nMisuse\n\nWe’ll take appropriate action if anyone notifies us of potential misuse. We have guidelines to help local authorities report housing misuse.\n\nBack to top\n\nSafety\n\nWe care about the safety of Hosts and their guests. You can improve your guests’ peace of mind by providing a few simple preparations like emergency instructions and noting any potential hazards.\n\nEmergency contact information\n\nInclude a contact list with the following phone numbers:\n\nLocal emergency numbers\n\nThe number for the nearest hospital\n\nYour contact number\n\nA number for a backup contact (in case guests can’t reach you)\n\nIt’s also a good idea to make sure guests know the best way to contact you in case of an emergency. You can also communicate with guests using messages on Airbnb as a safe alternative.\n\nMedical supplies\n\nKeep a first aid kit and tell your guests where it is. Check it regularly so you can restock supplies if they run out.\n\nFire prevention\n\nIf you have gas appliances, follow any applicable gas safety regulations and make sure you have a working carbon monoxide detector. Provide a fire extinguisher and remember to maintain it regularly.\n\nExits\n\nEnsure you have a clearly marked fire escape route. Post a map of the route so it’s easy for guests to see.\n\nHazard prevention\n\nHere are some ways you can help prevent potential hazards:\n\nInspect your home to identify any areas where guests might trip or fall\n\nRemove the hazards you identify or mark them clearly\n\nFix any exposed wires\n\nMake sure your stairs are safe and have railings\n\nRemove or lock up any objects that may be dangerous to your guests\n\nChild safety\n\nSome guests travel with young family members and need to understand if your home is right for them. You can use the Additional notes section of Listing details in your Airbnb account to indicate potential hazards or indicate that your home isn’t suitable for children and infants.\n\nClimate control\n\nWorking appliances, like furnaces and air conditioners, can greatly affect your guests’ comfort during their stay. There are lots of ways you can make sure your guests stay comfortable:\n\nMake sure your home is properly ventilated\n\nProvide instructions on how to safely use the heater and air conditioning\n\nCheck that the thermostat is working correctly and make sure that guests know where to find it\n\nService the appliances regularly\n\nOccupancy limits\n\nEstablish safe occupancy limits. Your local government may have guidelines.\n\nBack to top"
