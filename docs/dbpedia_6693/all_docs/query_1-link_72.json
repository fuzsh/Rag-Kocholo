The procedure will be handled by the Greek Customs Authority. The number is necessary for all entities which are issued with a VAT number and it will be issued based on application form provided by the said institution.\n\nAll interested entities will have to provide information on all the elements of the application (the form is written in Greek and English, so, as a general rule, it should be easily completed, but in the case in which applicants have difficulty in dealing with this document, our team of lawyers in Greece can help). In the list below, you can find out information that is required when preparing the application for EORI registration in Greece:\n\nthe name of the person filling the form, the residential address of the person or of the company;\n\nthe date of birth of the applicant or the incorporation date of the company;\n\nthe legal status of the applicant – natural person, legal entity, association of companies, etc.;\n\ninformation of the contact person – name, address, e-mail, phone number;\n\nthe VAT number and the code associated with the business operations of the applicant.\n\nThis type of form can be found in all European countries, and the procedure to register will be the same. However, it is necessary to know that each country can impose specific rules, within the limits of the European EORI framework, which means that certain procedures that may apply in a country will not be imposed by the customs of other EU states.\n\nPlease know that 2024 brings an important change for those who need to register for EORI. The change is also addressed to those who are already registered for EORI. Thus, starting with 1 February 2024, all registered entities and those who request to register must provide a postal code, that will be linked to their EORI.\n\nEconomic operators who are already registered must address the national authority where they have registered initially (Greece, in this case), or the online platform of the European Commission to see if their data is accurate. If they didn’t provide a postal code in the initial registration form, they must add it, so that their future customs procedures will not be negatively impacted by this new formality.\n\nBelow, you can watch a short presentation on the EORI number in Greece:\n\nThis is also the case of Greece, which has certain particularities, along with other few EU member states.

Our Greek law firm can offer more details regarding the following:\n\nfrom all the 27 EU member states, 4 require consumers to apply for an EORI number – this is the case of Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece and Lithuania;\n\nthe EORI number in Greece in this case is necessary provided that the value of the shipment is above EUR 1,000;\n\nif the shipment is below EUR 1,000, the consumer will not need the EORI in Greece, but has to provide a tax ID for custom clearance;\n\nthe EORI system has been introduced in 2009 and it is applied to both EU businesses and businesses outside the EU, but the obligation to have an EORI number will vary based on the activities developed by the economic operator;\n\nplease mind that the United Kingdom (UK), which used to be a part of the EU, still applies the EORI system, even though the UK finished its exit formalities at the end of 2020.\n\nWhat are the formalities for applying for EORI in Greece in 2024?\n\nThe formalities for an EORI number in Greece are similar for both Greek tax residents as well as for non-EU economic operators. Greek tax residents must apply for an EORI number in Greece, while other EU economic operators will apply for it with the customs authorities of the countries where they are tax residents.\n\nIn Greece, after the application form is completed, the applicant must present along with the form specific supporting documents. All these will then be analyzed by the representatives of the Greek Customs and if the data is correct, the entity will be assigned with an EORI number in Greece.\n\nFor non-EU entities, the same procedure will apply; please mind that the EORI number is issued only for entities that fall under the definition of an economic operator. You can find out more details regarding this mater from our Greek law firm. If you need legal assistance for the EORI registration in Greece, our team of Greek lawyers can always help you and can inform you about other customs obligations that can apply to your business.\n\nIf you need assistance in other legal matters, such as if you are interested in the procedure applicable to foreigners who want to buy land in Greece, you can also refer to our Greek lawyers.\n\nOur team can present the formalities you have to comply with based on your nationality (while EU citizens benefit from simple rules, available for Greek nationals, third party nationals must complete immigration requirements).\n\nIf you are interested in knowing if you need an EORI number in Greece in 2024, you must know that the Independent Authority for Public Revenue of Greece stipulates that you have to verify the main requirements with the Customs Authorities of Greece.\n\nThis is necessary if you are an economic operator established in Greece (all Greek economic operators have to obtain their EORI number in 2024 from the Greek Customs).
