        "text": "Driving in Greece is a fantastic way to explore the country’s beautiful islands, white-washed villages, and ancient ruins.\n\nIf you are planning to rent a car in or take your own vehicle, it’s important to be prepared as driving in Greece is very different to the UK.\n\nTo make your trip to the Continent as safe and effortless as possible, we’ve put together a guide to everything you need to know before you go, from required documents to rules of the road.\n\nDriving a rented vehicle? Jump to the advice for driving a hire car in Greece section.\n\nRAC European Breakdown Cover (Basic and Comprehensive) provides a wide range of benefits should you breakdown to ensure you stay safe.\n\nTo supplement this, RAC also offers travel insurance. Cover will include medical expenses, baggage, personal money and belongings, among many other benefits.\n\nNeed insurance for your road trip? Our temporary car insurance product is perfect if you're looking for flexible and comprehensive cover for between 1 hour and 30 days.\n\nNeed single trip European Breakdown Cover? Get a quote from just £6\n\nIn an emergency\n\nThe following telephone numbers can be used to call the emergency services should you be involved in an accident or breakdown on the motorways indicated below:\n\nAttiki: 1024\n\nAegean: 1075\n\nMoreas: 1025\n\nNea Odos: 1075\n\nOlympia: 1025\n\nEgnatia: 1077\n\nRion-Antirrion, bridge: 26340 - 39010\n\n112 - Here's a really important bit of knowledge; you can dial 112 from anywhere in Europe and an operator will connect you to an emergency service in the country you're visiting.\n\nOperators can answer your call in their native language, English or French.\n\nDriving licence laws\n\nVisitors must be aged 18 or over and hold a full, valid driving licence to legally drive in Greece. Riders of motorcycles up to 125cc must be aged 18 or over, while moped (not exceeding 50cc) riders must be aged 16 or over.\n\nDriving licences issued in EU and EEA countries are accepted. International driving permits are recognised, but not required.\n\nVehicles from the UK can be temporarily imported into Greece for up to 6 months without customs documents. In order to stay on the right side of the law, the following documents should always be carried:\n\nFull, valid UK driving licence\n\nProof of ID (passport)\n\nMotor insurance certificate\n\nV5 registration document\n\nDo I need a GB or UK sticker for driving in Greece?\n\nSince 28th September 2021, the distinguishing mark (or national identifier) displayed on vehicles registered in the United Kingdom that are driven abroad changed from GB to UK.\n\nThis means that vehicles registered in the UK must display the letters “UK” when driven in Greece.\n\nThe identifier can be incorporated in vehicle number plates (along with the Union Flag) or as a separate sticker. Note that vehicles featuring the letters GB together with the Council of Europe golden stars are no longer valid for driving abroad.\n\nIf your vehicle does not have the UK identifier within the number plate, you will require a UK sticker when driving in Greece. GB stickers will no longer be valid from the end of September.\n\nDo I need an insurance green card?\n\nSince 2nd August 2021, drivers no longer require an insurance green card for taking their vehicles to Greece.\n\nETIAS – 2025\n\nETIAS stands for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System. It is a visa program for visitors who don’t need a Schengen visa, who want to travel to the European Union and a few other European countries.\n\nVisitors who purchase an ETIAS will be able to enter the 26 member states of the Schengen Zone as well as Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, and Romania.\n\nThis will be launching in 2025. Learn more about ETIAS here.\n\nOvertaking and passing\n\nIn Greece, motorists drive on the right and overtake on the left.\n\nOvertaking is forbidden on and approaching level crossings, or if the vehicle ahead has stopped for safety reasons.\n\nWho has priority?\n\nAs a general rule, priority must be given to vehicles coming from the right unless indicated.\n\nOutside of main urban areas, traffic moving along a main road has priority at an intersection.\n\nWarning of approach\n\nIn urban areas, sounding the horn is not allowed at any time, except in an emergency. Multi-toned sirens, hooters and whistles are strictly prohibited.\n\nTowing\n\nCars with caravans or trailers are not allowed to exceed 18 metres in length, 4 metres in height and 2.55 metres in width.\n\nSeat belts\n\nIt’s compulsory to wear seat belts in the front and rear seats of cars equipped with belts.\n\nThe fine for failing to wear a seat belt is €350.\n\nTraffic lights\n\nThe international three-colour traffic light system is used in Greece.\n\nRoad signs\n\nAll major and secondary roads and motorways have road signs in both Greek and English\n\nOn-the-spot fines\n\nGreek police are unable to collect on-the-spot fines from offending motorists.\n\nMinimum and maximum fines\n\nFines range from €40 for a minor speeding offence to €1,200 for driving under the influence of alcohol.\n\nSome motoring offences are considered criminal offences and can also lead to licence revocation, vehicle confiscation and a possible prison sentence.\n\nConfiscation of vehicles\n\nA vehicle can only be confiscated in very serious circumstances and only after a court has issued such a decision.\n\nThe Cross-Border Enforcement Directive\n\nAn EU cross-border directive came into effect in the UK in May 2017. This is aimed at tracking down people who commit traffic offences in cars that are registered in an EU member state different to where the offence was committed.\n\nIf you commit a driving offence in Greece or any other EU country, the crime will effectively follow you back home to the UK where you can still be prosecuted.\n\nLike many other European countries, Greece has motorways with tolls. Tolls are based on the vehicle and distance travelled, with the toll charge usually a few Euros.\n\nGreek service areas\n\nThere are service areas along the Greek motorways, although these are not as common as in other European countries so motorists are advised to stock up on fuel and supplies in towns.\n\nAvailability of fuel\n\nLPG may not be used in private cars, although it is available for use by taxis. Some fuel stations will accept credit cards but others will not. There are no automatic petrol pumps that accept card payments in Greece.\n\nFuel prices in Greece can be found in our up-to-date European fuel prices page.\n\nCamper vans and cars with caravans are not allowed to exceed 18 metres in length, 4 metres in height and 2.55 metres in width.\n\nLoads mustn’t exceed 13 tonnes at the driving axle and 7 tonnes at a single axle.\n\nPlease note: The Department for Transport advises that A-frames are not legal for use by UK campers and caravanners abroad. In practice, this could mean towing your car while it’s fixed to a trailer.*"
