        "text": "If you are moving to another EU country with your car, specific rules apply to car registration depending on whether or not you want to move there temporarily or permanently, on the length of your stay and on the country you are moving to.\n\nMoving on a permanent basis\n\nIf you move permanently to another EU country and take your car with you, you should register your car and pay car-related taxes in your new country.\n\nThere are no common EU rules on vehicle registration and related taxes. Some countries have tax-exemption rules for vehicle registration when moving with the car from one country to another permanently.\n\nTo benefit from a tax exemption, you must check the applicable deadlines and conditions in the country you wish to move to.\n\nCheck the exact rules and deadlines with the national authorities:\n\nMoving on a temporary basis (not changing normal residence)\n\nIf you move temporarily to another EU country without changing your normal residence you do not have to register your car or pay any registration taxes there. You can keep your car registered in your country of normal residence.\n\nYour normal residence is the place where you usually live, work or have family (for more than 185 days in a calendar year).\n\nIf you do not work, the normal residence is considered the place where you have personal ties which show close links between you and the place where you are living.\n\nIf you work in a place but your personal ties are in another EU country, you are usually considered having your normal residence in the EU country of your personal ties, provided that you return there regularly.\n\nIf you are stopped by the police in the country where you're temporary staying, you will need to demonstrate that you are not living there permanently. This can sometimes be difficult. When driving, it is a good habit to have with you your car registration certificate, the certificate of ownership and a proof of your normal residence (generally an ID card or document showing that you are registered as a resident in another EU country).\n\nIf you are temporarily driving around in your new EU country, you should not lend or rent your car (still registered in another EU country) to a resident of that EU country. This is because the person could become subject to a fine. You may, however, lend your car to visiting friends or family members as long as they do not have their residence in that EU country.\n\nPenalty points and fines\n\nYou may be fined:\n\nif you have to register your car but you fail to do so on time\n\nif you don't pay the relevant taxes\n\nif you drive with a number plate from another EU country without a proof of normal residence in another EU country and a valid roadworthiness test.\n\nYou can check the exact rules that apply to car registration in the country you are moving to on the websites of the national authorities:\n\nSpecific rules for students and cross-border workers\n\nStudents that reside in another Member State for the sole purpose of pursuing their studies and cross-border workers don't usually have to pay car registration and circulation taxes.\n\nCheck the exact rules on car taxes in another EU country Open as an external link that apply to students and cross-border workers.\n\nStudents\n\nIf you are a student and you move to another EU country with the sole of pursuing your studies, you can drive your car registered in your home country without having to register it or pay taxes in your new country. As a student, you must be enrolled in an educational establishment in that country and be able to provide a valid enrolment certificate. If you start working during your studies, however, you will have to register your car in that country.\n\nBefore leaving your home country, you should check the applicable rules in the country where you are going to study. You may need to fulfil some administrative formalities or meet certain conditions in order to avoid problems during police checks.\n\nSample story\n\nMathieu from France moved to Belgium where he is doing a 2-year post-graduate course. Mathieu's car was damaged, so he went to the police to get a report for his insurer. When the police discovered that Mathieu had been living in Belgium for over a year without registering his car there, they told him that his situation was irregular and would be fined.\n\nMathieu could prove, however, that he was registered at Antwerp University and that as a student from another EU country, he didn't have to pay car or road taxes in Belgium.\n\nCross-border workers\n\nAs a cross-border worker (work in one country and live in another one), you may need to drive a car that is registered in only one of the two countries.\n\nIf you drive a company car registered in the country where you work, you may also use it in the country where you live without having to register it there. Check the different conditions that apply to the use of company cars in the EU as the rules may vary considerably.\n\nIf you use your own car to commute regularly from the country where you live to the country where you work, you have to register it and pay the relevant taxes in the country where you live - but not in the country where you work.\n\nFor more information on car registration and relevant taxes as well as for links to national authorities' websites see:"
