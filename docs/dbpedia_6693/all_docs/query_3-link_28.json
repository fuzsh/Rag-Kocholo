We will remit the $10 mandatory contribution to you on an annual basis at the start of the next calendar year as soon as we receive your audit attestation. We do require five hundred (500) yearly registrations to keep the plate in active production.\n\nThere will be one probationary year if the number of registrations falls below 500. If you should have questions concerning any of this, please do not hesitate to contact KYTC.SpecialLicensePlate@ky.g​ov."
