When a symbol, flag or emblem is also displayed, the distinguishing sign shall be placed on the far left of the plate.\n\nIn the European Economic Area, vehicles from one member state do not need to display the oval while within another state, provided the number plate is in the common EU standard format introduced in the 1990s, which includes the international vehicle registration code on the plate.\n\nIn Switzerland, many cars have a oval sticker, because the license plate do not include the international vehicle registration code.\n\nData in the table can be sorted in ascending/descending order by clicking on the column header.\n\nVehicle registration codes of the Europe\n\n* - unofficial code\n\nVehicle registration codes of the America\n\n* - unofficial code\n\nVehicle registration codes of the Asia\n\n* - unofficial code\n\nVehicle registration codes of the Africa\n\n* - unofficial code\n\nVehicle registration codes of Australia and Oceania\n\n* - unofficial code\n\nCodes no longer in use\n\n* - unofficial code"
