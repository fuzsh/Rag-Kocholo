        "text": "This guide sets out essential information for British citizens moving to or living in Greece. Read about how the consulate in Athens, our vice consulates in Corfu, Crete, Rhodes and honorary vice consulate in Zakynthos can help.\n\nThis information is provided as a guide only. You should get definitive information from the Greek authorities. The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) is not liable for any inaccuracies in this information.\n\nRead general guidance on moving or retiring abroad.\n\nTo stay up to date:\n\nsign up for email alerts\n\nfollow the British Embassy Athens on Facebook and Twitter\n\njoin the Facebook page for Brits in Greece\n\nIf you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021\n\nSome parts of this guide only apply if you have been living in Greece since before 1 January 2021. You should read these in addition to the rest of the guidance in each section.\n\nYou should also read our Living in Europe page for detailed guidance about citizens’ rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nVisas and residency\n\nYou must tell the UK government offices that deal with your benefits, pension and tax if you are moving or retiring abroad.\n\nCheck the entry requirements for Greece.\n\nYou should also read:\n\nthe Greek Embassy in London’s guidance on national visas\n\nthe Greek government’s guidance on residence permits for real estate owners in Greece\n\nVisas and residency if you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021\n\nIf you have lived in Greece since before 1 January 2021, you and your family members have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement.\n\nAll UK nationals resident in Greece before 1 January 2021 should get the new biometric residence document (Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4) ΣΑ Έγγραφο Διαμονής). It shows that you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement. The Greek government has not yet set a deadline for getting the document, but confirmed that it will be indicative. This means that your rights under the Withdrawal Agreement will not be affected if you do not meet the deadline. However, we strongly recommend that you request the Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4). It also shows your right to enter Greece and exempts you from the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS) and visa requirements.\n\nEU Entry/Exit System\n\nIn Autumn 2024, the EU will introduce a new digital border – called the Entry/Exit System (EES).\n\nThis will require non-EU nationals, including UK nationals, visiting the EU to create a digital record and provide their biometric data (fingerprints and facial image) at the border when they enter the EU’s Schengen Zone.\n\nUK nationals resident in the EU will be exempt from registration if they hold the correct documentation.\n\nFor UK nationals who are beneficiaries of the Withdrawal Agreement (those who were lawfully resident in the EU before 1 January 2021), the correct documentation that allows exemption is the new biometric residence document (Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4) ΣΑ Έγγραφο Διαμονής). If you have this document, you will not need to register in the EES when travelling.\n\nFor further details on how to apply for this document please read the “Visas and residency if you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021” section of this document (Living in Greece).\n\nWe strongly urge all UK nationals, lawfully resident in the EU before 1 January 2021, to apply for the new biometric residence document (Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4) ΣΑ Έγγραφο Διαμονής) to avoid difficulties at the border.\n\nWe also strongly urge all UK nationals, lawfully resident in the EU before 1 January 2021, to make sure their biometric residence document (Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4) ΣΑ Έγγραφο Διαμονής) remains valid, to replace it if lost or stolen and to keep it with them when travelling.\n\nThere are certain additional temporary documents issued under the WA which will also allow exemption from registration in the EES. For Greece, these documents are the special certificate of legal residence stating that the holder has the rights of Part Two of the WA (Ειδική Βεβαίωση Νόμιμης Διαμονής της υπ’αριθ. 4000/1/113-α’ Κ.Υ.Α. (ΥΠΟΔΕΙΓΜΑ ΚΑ-158) and the certificate of submission of the supporting documents (Βεβαίωση (κατάθεσης δικαιολογητικών). If you hold these documents when travelling, you will also be exempt from registration in the EES.\n\nFree movement residence documents, previously issued to UK nationals and their family members do not allow exemption from the EES. As such, in Greece, registration certificate ‘Veveosi Engrafis - Βεβαίωση Εγγραφής’ or permanent residence certificate ‘Engrafo Monimis Diamonis - Έγγραφο Μόνιμης Διαμονής’ if you registered before 1 January 2021, do not allow exemption from registration in EES.\n\nFor UK nationals who are otherwise resident in Greece, the documentation that allows exemption from EES includes other residence permits issued to third country nationals as long as it is listed in Annex 22 of the Schengen Practical Handbook for Border Guards.\n\nRead the Greek Ministerial Decision on residence documents (in Greek) and the related announcement from the Hellenic Police (including a series of Q&As).\n\nTo request the document:\n\nif you live in Attica and Thessaloniki regions, visit your nearest Hellenic Police station that has an Aliens Department\n\nif you live elsewhere, visit your nearest General Regional Police Directorate that has an Aliens Department\n\nnon-EU family members should visit their nearest Directorate for Aliens and Migration of the Decentralized Administrations\n\nIf you have been legally resident in Greece for:\n\nover 5 years: you will be eligible for permanent residency and a 10-year residence document which you should renew when it expires\n\nless than 5 years: you will be eligible for a document valid for 5 years. After 5 years, when you renew it, you will get a 10-year residence document\n\nRead the Hellenic police’s guidance on how to renew your residence document.\n\nThe Greek authorities will only accept your application if you include all the documents that they request. When your application is accepted, you will be given a temporary certificate. You can use this until you receive your biometric residence document.\n\nYou should also read the Greek government’s website for UK nationals living in Greece and submit any questions using the contact form.\n\nIf your mobility is impaired, for example you are bedridden, hospitalised, in a nursing home or care facility, you do not need to request the biometric residence document in person. You can authorise a family member or lawyer to apply on your behalf. You can also ask a police officer to collect your application and supporting documents, and take your biometric data (fingerprints). You will need a medical certificate to confirm that your mobility is impaired. If you lack mental capacity, your representative will need to provide a medical certificate confirming your condition.\n\nIf you have problems with your request for a biometric residence document, contact the Department of Citizenship, Homogeneous and European Union Citizens of Aliens Division of the Hellenic Police Headquarters.\n\nIf you need further information on how to secure your residency, you may find useful the EuroBrits Greece guidance on residency.\n\nAppeals process\n\nIf your biometric residence document application is refused, the refusal letter will explain how you can appeal. You must appeal within 20 days of the refusal decision. You will be given a Certificate of Legal Residence (Ειδική Βεβαίωση Νόμιμης Διαμονής). This shows that you continue to have full Withdrawal Agreement rights until there is a final decision on your appeal.\n\nThe Director of the relevant Aliens Division will make a decision within 30 days. If your appeal is refused, you can make a further appeal to the Administrative courts. You can continue to stay in Greece until you get a decision on this appeal.\n\nIf your appeals are refused, you may be able to apply for the relevant permit under the rules for third country nationals. A third country national is someone who does not have EU, EEA or Swiss nationality.\n\nFamily members\n\nYour close family members continue to be able to join you and settle in Greece at any time in the future. Read more information on who this applies to in the Living in Europe guidance.\n\nNationals of certain non-EU countries may need a visa before travel. The Greek authorities should issue family reunion visas free of charge.\n\nPassports and travel\n\nYou can apply for or renew your British passport from Greece.\n\nCheck the Greece travel advice for passport validity requirements.\n\nAlways carry your passport when travelling within the Schengen area. If you have citizenship of an EU or European Free Trade Association (EFTA) country, in addition to your British citizenship, you should enter and leave Greece using your EU or EFTA country passport.\n\nIf you stay in Greece with a Greek residence document or long stay visa, this time does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.\n\nIf you visit other Schengen area countries outside Greece, make sure you do not exceed the visa-free 90 days in any 180-day period. You are responsible for counting how long you stay under the Schengen visa waiver, and you must comply with its conditions.\n\nDifferent rules apply if you are travelling to other EU and Schengen countries as a resident of Greece. Check each country’s travel advice page for information on entry requirements.\n\nIf you were living in Greece before 1 January 2021\n\nWhen you travel, in addition to your valid passport, carry your residence document:\n\nregistration certificate ‘Veveosi Engrafis - Βεβαίωση Εγγραφής’ or\n\npermanent residence certificate ‘Engrafo Monimis Diamonis - Έγγραφο Μόνιμης Διαμονής’ if you registered before 1 January 2021 or\n\nresidence document ‘Engrafo Diamonis 18 (4) WA - Έγγραφο διαμονής 18 (4) ΣΑ’, issued under the Withdrawal Agreement\n\nYou must proactively show your residence document, or other evidence of residence status, if you are asked to show your passport at border control. Other evidence may be your tenancy agreement or a utility bill in your name, dating from 2020. If you have applied for, but not yet received, your residence document, show your certificate of registration.\n\nIf you cannot prove that you are resident in Greece, you may be asked additional questions at the border to enter the EU. Your passport may be stamped on entry and exit. This will not affect your rights in the country or countries where you live or work. If a passport is stamped, the stamp is considered null and void when you can show evidence of lawful residence. Read EU guidance for UK nationals on entering and leaving the Schengen area.\n\nIf you have rights under the Withdrawal Agreement, you can enter and exit Greece with your valid UK passport. You do not need any additional validity on the passport beyond the dates on which you are travelling.\n\nHealthcare\n\nRead our guidance on healthcare in Greece and make sure you are correctly registered for your circumstances.\n\nRead the Greek government guidance on EHICs and S1s:.\n\nTravel insurance is not intended to cover healthcare costs if you live overseas.\n\nIf you do not have any healthcare insurance, you can get medical treatments or diagnostic tests from public hospitals and primary healthcare centres.
