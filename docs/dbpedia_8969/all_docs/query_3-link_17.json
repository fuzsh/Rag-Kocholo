        "text": "Principal Findings\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented global research activity. To the best of our knowledge, our bibliometric analysis is the first to quantify the published literature on COVID-19 research that has been conducted by countries in the EMR up until early 2022. We provided a descriptive evidence-based analysis of the published research, identifying leading countries and organizational affiliations, with visualizations of collaborations and evolution of COVID-19 research output. Research on COVID-19 in the region has been led by authors and institutions from Iran and KSA. There were multiple regional collaborative efforts; however, international collaboration is limited. Output focuses on COVID-19 epidemiology, mortality, and anxiety and depression. Recently, interest has been shifting more toward topics related to vaccination, machine learning, and online learning.\n\nOur results show that KSA and Iran are leading COVID-19 research in the EMR in terms of the number of publications. These results are not surprising, as KSA also leads the COVID-19 publications in the Arab world, with a 35.65% share of research production [33], and Iran has been the largest contributor to biomedical and health research in the EMR, with a 39% share during 2004-2013 [34].\n\nThe high number of COVID-19 research publications in both countries, especially by their leading universities (Tehran University of Medical Sciences in Iran and King Saud University in KSA), is due to many factors. First, both countries have relatively large populations, 35 million and 84 million in 2020, respectively [35], and both were among the countries most affected by the pandemic in the region, especially Iran [8]. Since the beginning of the pandemic and until April 1, 2022, more than 7 million confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in Iran [8], which is the highest number in the region. The rapid spread of the disease in Iran in several waves was associated with many unique political, social, cultural, economic, and religious dimensions [36], providing a stimulating environment for research activities. For example, religious tourism in Qom, a pilgrimage site in Iran, which continued during the pandemic, was a major source of spread to other Iranian cities, Pakistan, and KSA in the early stages of the pandemic [37-39]. In KSA, mass gathering events, such as Umrah and Hajj, which were put on hold during the pandemic, may have also contributed to the high number of publications, not because of the high risk of transmission, but because of the successful measures that KSA took to prevent the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic locally and globally [39-41].\n\nSecond, both countries have invested extensively in the needed resources for medical and scientific research along the years. Iran has built a large human resource capacity with its unique Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education and its mandatory and credit-based continuing education programs for physicians for relicensing, along with the increasing number of Iranian journals indexed in international databases [42-44]. KSA has also rapidly become a major player in scientific research in the EMR, as research and development (R&D) is 1 of the main pillars of the Saudi Vision 2030, with the specific goal of having at least 5 Saudi universities among the top 200 in the world by 2030 [45,46]. These reasons may also explain why countries with fragile health systems, war torn, or with limited resources, such as Afghanistan, Djibouti, Somalia, Libya, and Syria, were less research-productive, although the number of cases in these countries may be higher than that officially reported and mandates further investigations.\n\nNevertheless, neither Iran nor KSA was reported to be at the top of the global COVID-19 literature in a recent global bibliometric analysis [47]. This adds to previous findings showing that the EMR share in global health research publications is low [34]. It is worth noting that Iran and KSA, like many other countries, faced various economic challenges during the pandemic that may have affected their research capacities. KSA was severely affected economically due to the radical decline in the global demand for oil, in parallel with the global economic recession, which was reflected in the sharp decline in oil prices during the first and second waves of the pandemic [48]. COVID-19 has also severely affected the Iranian economy, exacerbated by the concomitant international sanctions [49]. Generally, evidence shows that more support is needed for biomedical and health research in many of the EMR countries and institutions, especially those identified in our analysis as least productive.\n\nInternational collaboration in COVID-19 research appears to be low in the EMR, as only 5.92% of the publications were associated with universities outside the EMR. The pandemic has shown that gaps in global cooperation, whether in research and information sharing, vaccine development and deployment, or travel policy, have affected the speed and equity of the global recovery [50]. In our study, the United States and the United Kingdom were at the center of collaboration and had the most extensive collaboration with EMR countries in COVID-19 research, similar to their role in COVID-19 research in the Arab world [33]. This could be due to the fact that both countries are among the top countries in scientific research [51] and specifically in global COVID-19 research [47]. The cross-border international flow of knowledge in the form cross-affiliation among researchers in the EMR with different international entities can be explained in several ways. First, the United States and the United Kingdom were by far the largest health donors to global health in 2019, with US $8.1 billion and US $2.9 billion, respectively [52], and when it comes to a donor-funded research project, most research funders require publication as a condition of a grant [53], triggering a cascade of cross-border research publications. Second, the United Kingdom and the United States have a network of research-intensive universities and scholarships, and both countries are hubs for international students, including those from the EMR, which could encourage cross-border collaboration. For example, the number of KSA students in the United Kingdom ranked eighth among international students from nonâ€“European Union countries, according to Higher Education Statistics Agency statistics for 2020/2021 [54]. In the United States, the number of KSA students ranked fourth among international students for the 2019-2020 academic year [55].\n\nMost of the identified publications did not report a funding source, which could be due to limited funding opportunities or simply the likely dominance of cross-sectional studies and reviews, which are relatively less expensive, take less time to conduct, and require less infrastructure than, for example, clinical trials or prospective cohort studies [56]. The limited funding opportunities in the EMR may be related to the chronic underinvestment in research and development systems in the region, both financially and politically [57], exacerbated by the economic damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the overreliance of some regional countries on external funding [58], although some major donors, such as the United Kingdom, have recently reduced their external funding [59]. Studies have also shown that research in the health care sector is not a top funding priority for governments, the private sector, or organizations in the EMR [57] and that R&D spending as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the region is among the lowest in the world, despite significant differences in the GDP among member countries [58,60,61]. In EMR countries, R&D spending as a percentage of the GDP ranged from as low as 0.02% in Syria and Sudan in 2015 and 2019, respectively, to 1.3% in the UAE in 2018 compared to the global average of 2.27% in 2018 [58,61].\n\nIn our analysis of institutions funding COVID-19 research in the EMR, we found that 3 of the top 4 funders are from KSA, which is not surprising, given that KSAâ€™s spending on R&D as a percentage of the GDP was 0.82 in 2013 [61] and is likely to increase, given that KSAâ€™s GDP is still high [60], and the 2030 vision for R&D to increase universitiesâ€™ competitiveness and ranking will continue to create a more favorable environment for research [45].\n\nNetwork analysis of coauthorship showed that the COVID-19 flow of information between EMR authors comes from a large and highly interconnected network with few isolated and small clusters. This indicates a high level of regional collaboration, either because of prepandemic collaboration and networking or because of governments and organizationsâ€™ role in fostering collaboration since the onset of the pandemic. Regarding linkages, Iran had the most connections, consistent with another study showing that Iranian researchers have well-established international collaborations with leading countries in COVID-19 research [49].\n\nCultural differences could possibly have shaped COVID-19 research collaboration in EMR countries, which can be explained by Hofstede's theory of cultural dimensions [62]. A recent study analyzing research collaboration in the area of business and economics by 11 countries, including Iran from the EMR, before and after the onset of the pandemic, showed that Hofstede's uncertainty avoidance domain significantly influences the characteristics of research collaboration networks [63]. Uncertainty avoidance explains how cultures adjust to change and cope with uncertainty [62], and the pandemic has caused major changes and uncertainties at all levels of society worldwide [64]. However, using cross-national data from different EMR countries and interpreting them in the context of Hofstedeâ€™s model of cultural dimensions will provide more accurate results and explore more details of the impact of culture on COVID-19 research collaboration in the EMR."
