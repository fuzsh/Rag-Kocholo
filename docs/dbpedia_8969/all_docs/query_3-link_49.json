        "text": "Rival factions clashed in a Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon for a third straight day on Monday in an eruption of violence that has left at least 11 people dead since it began.\n\nThe fighting in Ein al-Hilweh, the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, was set off by the killing on Saturday of a leader of the Fatah faction and four of his bodyguards by another Palestinian group, according to Lebanese state media and a Fatah commander. Fatah is the political party that controls the Palestinian Authority — the administration over parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\nThe Fatah commander, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said his faction was trying to surround the group behind the attack on Saturday, which he identified as Jund al-Sham. Fatah has previously clashed with Jund al-Sham, an Islamist group, in Ein al-Hilweh.\n\n“The clashes are expanding,” said Dr. Riad Abo Elaynein, an administrator at a private hospital near the camp. “The sounds of shelling are still being heard from inside the camp.”"
