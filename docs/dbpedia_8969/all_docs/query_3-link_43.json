        "text": "Ever had a lost in translation moment? Here's a travel tale that takes the scenic route! Meet Michael Lewis, 22, who turned a 400-mile flight into a 12,000-mile adventure. Michael, intending to fly from Los Angeles to Oakland. He had just arrived from London aboard an Air New Zealand flight and just followed the crowd, many of whom were traveling on to Auckland. He was asked where he was going, he said ‚ÄòOakland,‚Äô and received a boarding pass and got back on the same aircraft. It wasn't until they mentioned Tahiti mid-flight that he realized the mix-up. Imagine Michael's surprise when he landed in Auckland, not Oakland. He admitted the blunder and Air New Zealand officials gave Michael a return ticket to LA, and he eventually arrived at his intended destination. This story is kindly shared by colleague Chris Huet and is perfect for communications training. Key learnings for communications training: - Clarity is king: Be crystal clear in communication to avoid unexpected detours. - Listen actively: Pay attention to the details, especially in travel plans or instructions. - Speak up: If something seems off, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. What's your favourite training story?

And did you know your stairway lies on the whispering wind?\" NO STAIRWAY üé∏ ! If you quote Stairway to Heaven in your petition you will automatically get a NOID (Notice of Intent to Deny) ü§£ . #facts This was a beautiful scene this morning from my office. Clear, cold winter day for South Florida. Wind out of the NW, so the planes were taking off to the West (not the usually Easterly direction). When planes take off to the east we rarely can see them from our office. When planes instead take off to the west, we get some great views. * BTW, I saw the Jet Blue NY Jets plane take off but I wasn't quick enough on the draw. No, this is not a Spirit Airlines üõ© plane. Why not? 1) Spirit Airlines only uses the South Runway of Ft. Lauderdale Airport (FLL) 2) My offices faces North and you can only see parts of the North Runway from my window. #immigration #globalmobility #pilots #aviation #eb2niw #greencard\n\n#bahnlife ep. 22 International transit. I sometimes work on international trains, mainly to Switzerland/Basel. And it is still a pain, to cross borders with the trains. The connections are few and far between, which means that connecting trains are a problem. Some Train companies don't accept tickets from other companies (you missed your ice to Bruxelles ? you can't take the Thalys just like that, you need a HOTNAT [Hop On The Next Available Train] certificate...) then some countries like France or Italy have mandatory reservations and their trains are normally at over 80% capacity (so you can imagine what peak time looks like). it's getting better (after it got way worse in the last 20 years with the disappearance of most of the InterCities, EuroCities, and nighttrains). Anyway, dear EU, there is work to do here to reduce flying within Europe\n\nThe ranking of shame of those who travel the most by private jet in Spain and in the world It is a shame for several reasons. In the case of politicians, they are the ones who have the responsibility of taking actions to clean the air of polluting gases, and yet they are the ones who pollute the most through their private jet trips. In the case of the elites, there is everything, there are those who use the plane for flights even of 5 minutes, because they only get into their Lincoln or Rolls Royce to cross the street. The truth is that legislation should be legislated to prevent abuse, but the opposite is done. In Europe there is strong political opposition to the regulation of private flights, why is that?\n\nüåç Driving change in Norway and Ireland: Collaboration across borders!ü´±üèªü´≤üèΩ Breaking barriers and forging international alliances ‚Äì that's the pulse of one of my missions! I'm proud to stand ¬´shoulder-to-shoulder¬ª with Irish Aviation Authority, forming an relentless front against unruly passengers. Our success will come from the collaborative approach from our stakeholders and our unwavering commitment to fostering a secure environment for everyone. In our pursuit to reduce these unruly passengers events, I believe in the power of new ideas and innovative approaches. Learning from best practices is crucial. Evolving, and adapting to new ideas and procedures is where we all can make a difference. This is exactly what I have been part of today in Dublin. A heartfelt thank you to Lorraine Gibney and Alec Elliott for giving me time during the IAA‚Äôs stakeholder meeting, to showcase our progress in Norway. Your invitation reinforces the importance of our collective efforts. Together, we're not just confronting challenges; we're sharing and creating innovative solutions that hopefully will echo globally! I hope that more of you will be a part of this journey. Reach out, engage, and let's craft a safer future together. My inbox is open, my ears are attentive, and my resolve is unshakeable. If you want more information about the unruly passenger project in Norway, please feel free to contact me directly or share your insights, your experiences, and your best practices in the comments below. Together, we can try to create ripples of change that resonate across borders. So, let's keep the fires of collaboration burning brightly. Let's fuel the engine of innovation with our shared passion. Together we can be a movement for a positive change. üí™üåü #Safetyfirst #Collaboration #Innovation #Positivechange #Unitingnations #unrulypassengers #GlobalImpact #IrishAiviationAuthority #Luftfartstilsynet #together4safety #easa #samarbeid\n\nI‚Äôve been part of the Canadian aviation community for more than a decade, and it astounds me how many of my respected industry colleagues are eager to criticize Flair Airlines. At times, it feels like some even resent their very existence and their ‚Äúunsustainable‚Äù business model. Yet they gush over WestJet‚Äôs brilliant and very successful introduction of a new no frills fare option like UltraBasic. Well, colleagues, it‚Äôs time to move on. Flair has been around for quite a while now, and though I may eat my words one day (I hope not), it seems the ULC operator is here to stay, even in this most difficult air travel environment that is Canada. Instead of constantly praising WestJet perhaps these industry pundits could fairly scrutinize their on-time performance or completion rate as well? Disclaimer: Yes, I am a bit grumpy after arriving at Pearson after a long overseas flight to be greeted with a 2.5-hour delay for my connection to Edmonton. And while in this instance I‚Äôd prefer to be travelling Flair‚Äôs on-time 22:15 flight as opposed to the delayed WS one, nonetheless, I am truly grateful for the colossal economic impact both of these airlines continue to have in Alberta and the country. #Aviation #AviationIndustry #AlbertaAviation #AAC #AlbertaAviationCouncil #CanadianAviation"
