I’m moving with my girlfriend, who is also training at Baystate in the OB/GYN department. I’ve been told I have ‘diarrhea of the mouth’; it just keeps running, which is why my favorite thing to do at work is chit-chat with my patients. I am an old soul to my core, which is how I earned the nickname, “Gramps.” My hobbies include golfing, bird watching, reading non-fiction, and watching CBS’ 60 Minutes. My ideal day is waking up in a countryside house in France, watching birds, eating a croissant, and then gardening. Since I don’t own property in France, this dream will have to wait!

I really enjoy trying out new restaurants and cuisines wherever I have the chance, and I’ll always be ready to grab a quick bite after a long day! The toughest part about leaving home would have to be leaving my parents and my overly attached cat (who doesn’t sleep anywhere but on my bed) behind. Have I mentioned my love for coffee?\n\nLeen Al-Faris, MD\n\nUniversity of Jordan\n\nHi there! You can call me Lynn if it’s easier. I’m a (you guessed it) doctor by day, and a gym rat by night. Big fan of all animals, food, and anything related to fitness. For a very small person, I lift a lot of weight.\n\nMedicine is a natural fit for me, not just because I’m a good listener, but also because I work well under pressure (you bet I’ll be saying the exact opposite once I start residency).\n\nI’m also very family oriented and all about spending some quality time with my friends.

Upon graduating, I moved back home to pursue my medical degree at the University of Puerto Rico School of Medicine.

I also enjoy weightlifting, watching movies and shows, cooking, trying out new restaurants, technology, and pretending to be a mechanic.\n\nI am beyond excited to begin my training at Baystate, my top choice! Good, dedicated, and friendly people always make a great program shine brighter, and that was the reason I chose Baystate over the rest.\n\nSyifa Djunaedi, DO\n\nNew York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHello everyone!

After graduating from the University of Connecticut, I pursued my medical degree at NYITCOM on Long Island.\n\nI am a huge Boston sports fan. My biggest regret is never seeing Tom Brady play in person at Gillette in a Pats jersey, but I did go to the same college as Ray Allen and met him one time when I was at the Student Union. I have 4 fluffy cats that are my heart and soul. If I am not watching football whilst cuddling my kittens, I am baking desserts in my kitchen or practicing the newest makeup trend in front of my ring light. I am a total foodie; my favorite cuisine is Thai. I cannot wait to explore western MA and am very excited to be part of the Baystate family!\n\nJulia Fischer, DO\n\nWestern University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific\n\nHello all!

And I get to do some of that on a podcast show that I host – themedicinementors.com! Outside of medicine, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, playing tennis, tabla (Indian classical instrument), and trying new hobbies. I am excited to move to New England region and explore the great outdoors!\n\nBrian Hurley, DO\n\nUniversity of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHi everyone! I was born and raised in New Hampshire and I’ve lived on the seacoast there for most of my life. I attended the University of New Hampshire for undergrad and worked as an EMT before attending the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine for medical school.\n\nI couldn’t be more excited to continue my training as a resident at Baystate Medical Center! I chose Baystate because each and every interaction with the residents and faculty have been wonderful experiences, and they exuded such a positive and welcoming atmosphere. Life is about the journey, and I am so thrilled to continue mine as part of the Baystate family.\n\nIn my free time, swimming, biking, and running are my go-to activities. A perfect day for me involves a good morning bike ride followed by a slow-sipped espresso, and since I grew up near the ocean, I love to spend time relaxing at the beach, or surfing if the waves are good. Rounding out the day with a summertime barbeque and bonfire, surrounded by friends and family, that sounds great to me.\n\nYamna Jadoon, MD\n\nAga Khan University Medical College\n\nHello! My name is Yamna. My hometown is Peshawar, Pakistan. I’ve moved around a little over the years but it's always been a focal point. I spent a part of my childhood in Karachi and returned there for medical school which was an experience I greatly cherish.\n\nBesides medicine, I’m passionate about art and I love trying to combine the two when possible. I enjoy learning new skills and over the past year I’ve picked up a little chess, which may have been fueled by watching the Queen’s Gambit, and origami. I write sometimes and read often.\n\nI was drawn to Baystate because of the warmth the entire program, from the admin to the residents, was able to convey despite the fact that in-person communication was not possible. I look forward to joining the Baystate family!\n\nAizaz Khan, MD\n\nShifa College of Medicine\n\nHi everyone! My name is Aizaz Khan.

I also love playing video games of which my favorites are Call of Duty, DOTA, and FIFA. I am also a huge soccer fan and very passionately support The Arsenal. Let’s go Gunners!\n\nI gravitated towards Baystate because of the sense of family and togetherness displayed by both the administration and the residents. It was a feeling that I did not feel anywhere else and immediately knew I wanted to be a part of it. I cannot wait to begin my life in Springfield and am looking forward to being part of the team at Baystate.\n\nAnusha Kothapalli, MD\n\nWest Virginia University School of Medicine Morgantown\n\nHi everyone!

Hope my “Salam” gave you some insight into my background. I am Maryam from Bahrain. Besides being home, Bahrain is a beautiful island in the Arabian Gulf that is renowned for its seas, pearl fisheries, and diverse community.\n\nI completed my medical education in RCSI-Bahrain in 2019. Studying medicine was one of the best things I have chosen to do.

I am sure the sky will be the limit.\n\nVictoria Nguyen, DO\n\nUniversity of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHello! My name is Victoria Nguyen. I have lived in New England my entire life– I was raised in Randolph, MA, completed my undergrad/masters at Boston University, attended medical school at UNE COM in Maine, and also served as a New England Patriots Cheerleader! I grew up cheerleading/dancing, but love anything related to fitness. From aerial dance, to CrossFit, to parkour… I’ll try a class at least once.\n\nOne of the many things I love about Baystate is its emphasis on community health and advocacy. Growing up in a diverse town, as a daughter of Vietnamese refugees, I had the privilege of experiencing the richness of multiple cultures. It fueled my passion to travel (about 17 countries and 25 states so far) and opened my eyes to the attention needed on the social determinants of health. I’m excited to be part of the Baystate team, working with a diverse community.\n\nSherin Samuel, DO\n\nNew York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine\n\nHello everyone! My name is Sherin Samuel and I was born in Queens, New York. I moved to Long Island in the 2nd grade and have lived there ever since. And yes, I say it as “lawn-guy-land”.\n\nI have always been interested in the sciences, and volunteering at the local hospital during high school helped me realize that medicine was the path for me. I was accepted into the accelerated seven year combined Bachelor of Sciences/Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (BS/DO) program at New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) and NYIT College of Osteopathic Medicine (NYITCOM). During my college and medical school years, I was able to nurture my passion of fundraising for underserved communities with innovative events.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy: spending time with my friends and family, trying out new restaurants, and baking for others. The collaborative teamwork that takes place on the medical floors as well as the myriad of opportunities one can pursue is the reason Internal Medicine is the specialty for me. I look forward to my time at Baystate Medical Center and Massachussetts as the stepping stone for the rest of my career.\n\nLogan Striplin, MD\n\nRoss University School of Medicine\n\nHey everyone! My name is Logan Striplin, and I was born and raised in rural Northeast Texas.

However, my passion for medicine continued through volunteering throughout. I took the plunge and graduated from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine with my M.D. and minor in Global Health.\n\nI am excited to join a wonderful and unique internal medicine residency program here at Baystate Health. Besides the excellent training environment and world class facilities, I was particularly drawn by the small cohort size, excellent mentorship and family like atmosphere.

I was born and raised in South Korea, but spent most of my time in Massachusetts and Maryland. I received my undergraduate and master's degree from Johns Hopkins University. I spent few years working in research labs before starting medical school.\n\nI chose Baystate because it had everything I was looking for in a residency program.
