        "text": "On November 18, PA President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attack on the Jerusalem synagogue. Various Palestinian politicians reacted to the attack on the Lebanese Al-Quds TV and Mayadeen TV channels. PFLP Deputy Secretary-General Abu Ahmad Fouad said that the synagogue was a command center, not a synagogue of prayer. Hamas Political Bureau member Osama Hamdan said: \"The settlers are not civilians,\" and Palestinian political scientist Abd Al-Sattar Qassem said: \"Synagogues represent Israeli settlements and extremism.\"\n\nFollowing are excerpts:\n\nAl-Quds TV [Lebanon]\n\nPA Chairman Mahmoud Abbas: We strongly condemn events of this kind. Under no circumstances will we accept attacks on civilians. At this point, I would like to say that while we condemn this act, we also condemn the attacks on the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy places.\n\n[…]\n\nAl-Mayadeen TV [Lebanon]\n\nTawfiq Tirawi of the Fatah Central Committee: The responsibility for the Israelis killed today lies with Netanyahu, his government, and his settlers. The responsibility also lies with America, which helps Israel, and tries to deceive the Palestinian leadership with false promises.\n\n[…]\n\nPFLP Deputy Secretary-General Abu Ahmad Fouad: That synagogue is a kind of command center for the planning of acts of aggression against our people and our holy places. This is no prayer synagogue. Otherwise, how can we account for the presence of American and British citizens there?\n\n[…]\n\nAl-Quds TV [Lebanon]\n\nHamas Political Bureau member Osama Hamdan: According to all the international laws the settlers are not civilians. International law defines them as armed militias.\n\n[…]\n\nThis is the kind of act that defends the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and condemns the Israeli crimes.\n\n[…]\n\nAl-Quds TV [Lebanon]\n\nIsmail Aal Radhwan of Hamas, Gaza: Blood will be met with blood, killing will be met with killing, and the defiling of the holy places will be met by resistance, and by the heads of the Zionist rabbis, who are the greatest terrorists in that racist state. They represent the greatest terrorism against our Palestinian people and our holy places. Therefore, we say: These are no civilians. They are terrorists. They are terrorists because they are occupiers, because they are extremists, and because they are oppressors, who came from all corners of the earth to occupy our land.\n\n[…]\n\nAl-Quds TV [Lebanon]\n\nPFLP Central Committee member Samir Lubani: We salute our brothers in Jerusalem and throughout the West Bank. We send a great salute to the two martyrs, Ghassan and Uday, and to all the martyrs who preceded them on this path. These operations stem from the oppression of the occupation against our people.\n\n[…]\n\nThis is the real revolution. Therefore, instead of commemorating President Arafat with words and speeches, we should mark this day with more military and popular activity.\n\n[…]\n\nAl-Quds TV [Lebanon]\n\nPalestinian political scientist Abd Al-Sattar Qassem: This operation is symbolic because it was carried out in a synagogue. For the Palestinian people, synagogues represent Israeli settlements and extremism.\n\n[…]"
