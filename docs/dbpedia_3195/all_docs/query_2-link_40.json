Ahem.\n\nUnfortunately, he’s used Pinnacle Studio 16 Ultimate. Is there any way to convert his project file into something usable by either FCP7 or Premiere CS6? I know it’s a long shot, but I thought I would check before I tell him that his months of struggling with this on his own have been in vain, and starting from scratch."
