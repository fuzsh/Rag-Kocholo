        "text": "I'm just getting started with a new Phantom 4 Pro V2.0 on order...\n\nI'm trying to determine what software to purchase for real estate drone video editing. I have experience with an older version of Pinnacle software for home use, so I am already familiar with how to create a finished video using Pinnacle. I have also been looking at Adobe Premiere Pro, but the tutorials seem a bit complicated for a beginner. Pinnacle Studio 22 Ultimate supports 4k and 360 videos. Thoughts on using this software??? Can anyone offer any suggestions as to which product I should get started with? I'm open to suggestions, but also want to keep the cost under control, but I want a quality finished video product.\n\nThank you in advance for your help and suggestions.\n\nRFW1953\n\nI purchased the Pinnacle upgrade to Pinnacle Studio 22 Ultimate. I was able to produce my first video as a test with two issues. At first, I mixed clips that were shot at different settings. When exporting, I found that once the export function reached a clip that was at a different speed setting, the software froze. After editing out the clips shot at different speeds, the export function completed. The second issue I experienced was in play back. I first exported at the highest best quality settings, and playback didn't work at all. I was only able to view the below image in play back.\n\nI spent a day and a half experimenting with different export settings with no success. I also looked online at the Pinnacle forum and couldn't find a solution, so I contacted Pinnacle technical support. In a day and a half I received an email response suggesting that I go into the Pinnacle control panel settings, and change the hardware setting from advanced hardware acceleration to none. Then I restarted my computer and the Pinnacle software. This one simple step totally resoled the issue. I could then export the project video to any format and size I wanted, and successfully view my completed video project. Ugh! Lots of wasted time experimenting and researching, but I learned a good bit in the process. It took all of maybe 15 seconds to resolve once I changed the setting in this one control panel field.\n\nSeeing that I had past experience with an older version of Pinnacle Studio, making the transition to the newest product version became an easy learning curve experience with the exception of the two issues I experienced when making my first drone project video. We'll see how pleased I am with this product in time as I use it more. I'll keep you posted on my progress.\n\nI should mention that I'm using Windows 10 on a fairly new PC with ample storage capacity. My first test project video was 8 minutes at 4.9G Below is a screen shot showing the best quality Pinnacle export settings I used.\n\nSadly, I'm still having issues with Pinnacle Studio 22 Ultimate. After getting past the hardware acceleration setting change from accelerated to none, everything seemed to work fine. At least I could see the playback of my video clips.\n\nNow, when in the edit mode, and then I select change color from none to bright, the programs works fine, but when I attempt to change the color setting back to none, the program freezes. I'm currently working with Technical support for a resolution, but after resetting the program, and then creating a new admin user account in Windows 10 64bit, the program still freezes. Ugh! Lots of early challenges with this software. Beginning to get frustrated, but I will keep working on it for a while longer.
