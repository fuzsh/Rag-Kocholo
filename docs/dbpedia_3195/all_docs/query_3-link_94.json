It's look like my computer is Unable to read the software. can anyone help?\n\nMac OS X Lion 10.7.5\n\n4 GB 1333 MHz DDR3\n\nDownload it from where? The current version is 18.5.\n\nIf you're having problems with it, you should probably contact Pinnacle support. http://corel.force.com/pinnacle?lang=en\n\nThe only listing I see for Pinnacle Studio is for v18 and it is not compatible with Macs; it is Windows-only. To run it on Macs, you would have to install Windows via the BootCamp utility ( http://www.apple.com/support/bootcamp/ ) or use a virtual machine software like VM FusionWare fo Parallels."
