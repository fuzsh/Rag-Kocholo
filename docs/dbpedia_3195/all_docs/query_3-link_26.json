        "text": "Selecting the best video editor for PC can seem like a daunting task. There are so many options to choose from, and the entire research process can seem overwhelming. Luckily for you, we've boiled it down to the best options based on price, features, tools, templates, etc.\n\nWhat is a video editor for PC?\n\nIn the old days, video editors would literally cut film and clamp different clips together. With the digital age, things have changed, and probably for the better. Instead of having to lug around heavy film canisters in an editing bay, the entire editing process can be done on a computer. With just a few clicks, you can cut raw footage into a rough cut and start rearranging clips as you see fit. Unless you are doing serious graphic effects, newer PCs can handle basic video editing. Not all video editors are the same, and some will configure differently between Macs and PCs.\n\nThe best editing software for PCs\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro may not be the best editing software, but it is by far the most used. If you plan on becoming a professional editor or collaborating with other editors, Adobe Premiere Pro is probably the best option.\n\nThe biggest downside with Premiere Pro is that it is a subscription-based software. Instead of paying once for the software, you have to pay every single month. Different plans are available, but at a minimum, you can expect to fork over $20 a month. Additionally, if you want to use other features for audio editing (Adobe Audition) or motion graphics (Adobe After Effects), you have to pay extra. The only value to Premiere Pro is its popularity. If you are making videos as a hobby or plan to work independently, you should skip Adobe Premiere Pro.\n\nDaVinci Resolve\n\nIn contrast, DaVinci Resolve has a free version that is pretty powerful. It includes free plugins for audio editing (Fairlight) and motion graphics (Fusion). In the past, DaVinci Resolve was a software that could only be used for color grading. Today, it is a full suite editor, its color grading features are still the best on the market. Sure, you can do some color grading on Premiere Pro, but DaVinci Resolve is far superior as it has vectorscopes, histograms, and waveform analytics. Nearly all major Hollywood movies use DaVinci Resolve for color grading.\n\nThe most common complaint about DaVinci Resolve is its complexity. With so many features, it can take quite a while to learn the entire software. Most users can spend a year or two on the free version before mastering it. If needed, the premium version, called DaVinci Resolve Studio, is available for $295 and comes with a speed editor.\n\nPinnacle Studio\n\nUnlike Premiere Pro, the Pinnacle Studio software is a one-time expense. No sneaky subscription fees here. And unlike DaVinci Resolve, we wanted things to be more simple and beginner-friendly. Included in all software options are multicamera editing, enhanced keyframe controls, and color correction tools. Pinnacle Studio retails for $59.95, or if you want to get more serious with your craft, Studio Ultimate retails for $129.99.\n\nConclusion"
