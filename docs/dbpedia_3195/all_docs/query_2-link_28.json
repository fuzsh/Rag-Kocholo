        "text": "I am having problems with Color Banding in the sky when processing footage captured with my Mini 3 Pro using Pinnacle Studio 26. If I process the same footage with Davinci Resolve, there is little to no color banding. I normally capture in D-Cine, H.265, 4K30. It also has the banding if I capture using the Normal color profile.\n\nIs anyone else using Pinnacle Studio to process your drone footage? Do you have significant color banding? Any workarounds?\n\nExample Screenshots\n\nHello there RGBellCSI. Good day and thank you for reaching out. Since this is a 3rd party editing software ( Pinnacle Studio ) that you are using to edit your work . I hope that our fellow DJI Co Pilots who are using this editing software can give out the best information and recommendation with regards to this matter and also share what editing software they are using to edit there captured videos as well. Thank you.\n\nCloudVisual Posted at 9-2 09:40\n\nMost likely answer is that Davinci can handle 10bit footage and Pinnacle Studio only deals in 8bit colour depth. The banding you see is when there aren't enough colours in 8bit to give a nice gradual change.\n\nI haven't been able to find any information about Pinnacle Studio's ability to process 10 bit color.\n\nPinnacle Studio has the ability to generate free music and has a greater selection of transitions, other FX and Title generation that Davinci Resolve (free version) doesn't have. As a workaround, I can edit and color grade in Resolve and output video that doesn't have the banding. I can then import the video into Pinnacle and add whatever I want. I also have downloaded free music files for use with Resolve. The final output from Pinnacle does not have banding.\n\nRGBellCSI Posted at 9-2 12:19\n\nI haven't been able to find any information about Pinnacle Studio's ability to process 10 bit color.\n\nPinnacle Studio has the ability to generate free music and has a greater selection of transitions, other FX and Title generation that Davinci Resolve (free version) doesn't have.
