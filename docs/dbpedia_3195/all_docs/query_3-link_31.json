        "text": "Pinnacle Studio is a video editing software application developed by Pinnacle Systems for Windows computers. An iOS version came out in 2012. It was originally released in 1999, and in 2004 a more upscale version was introduced, Pinnacle Studio Plus, with a second video track (for picture-in-picture and chromakey video effects) and pan-and-zoom effects (for still images) and keyframeable video and audio effects. In 2005, Avid purchased Pinnacle Systems, and in 2007 came out with an even more upscale variation, Pinnacle Studio Ultimate, which came packaged with some advanced third-party plugins. In 2011, Avid spun off Pinnacle Studio into a prosumer-aimed video editing application, Avid Studio, featuring far more advanced features than the regular Pinnacle Studio line (such as unlimited video and audio tracks). In 2012, Avid sold Pinnacle Systems to Corel, along with the Avid Studio product, and Corel continues to make the Pinnacle Studio line of products to this day, based on the Avid Studio tooling (the current versions of Pinnacle Studio Ultimate since the Corel buyout are completely identical to the initial Avid Studio in terms of features).\n\nSound Effects Used[]\n\nH-B BOING, CARTOON - CYMBAL CRASH AND BOING 01 / Hollywoodedge, Cymbal Crash BoingQ CRT016402 (very low-pitched) (Bedspring on Windows only.)\n\nPinnacle, BoingBoing.wav (BoingBoing on Windows only.)\n\nPinnacle, BoinkHi.wav (BoinkHi on Windows only.)\n\nHollywoodedge, Bounce Boing Drum CRT016901 / Sound Ideas, BOINK, CARTOON - TIMP DOINK (BoinkLo on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, AUTO, SKID - TIRE SKID 01 (Skid on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, BOING, CARTOON - BOINK AND WIGGLE (very low-pitched) (Sproing on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, BOINK, CARTOON - PIXIE AND DIXIE BOINKS (very low-pitched) (BongCrash on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, HARP - HARP GLISSANDO, MUSIC 01 (Scales on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, HIT, CARTOON - FLBONK (very low-pitched) (Bonk on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, SKID, CARTOON - BROKEN SKID (slightly higher-pitched and reversed) (Skidding on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, WATER, SPLASH - LIGHT SPLASH, CARTOON 01 (Splash on Windows only.)\n\nSound Ideas, XYLOPHONE - COMEDY: MYSTERY WALK, MUSIC, PERCUSSION (Mystery on Windows only.)\n\nAudio Samples[]\n\n[]"
