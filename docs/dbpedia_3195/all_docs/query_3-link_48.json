Pinnacle Studio 26 is our most reliable and stable version to date. Enjoy smooth and streamlined video editing from the moment you install it!\n\nImproved Product Performance\n\nIncredible performance improvements have been implemented in user-identified areas such as software launch time, resource utilization, interface and project preview responsiveness, as well as import and export speed. Main performance improvements include:\n\nImplementing Apple ProRes* as a smart proxy format for improved preview, playback, timeline rendering, and overall editing responsiveness\n\nChanging behavioral logic to avoid unnecessary refreshes and reduce rendering delays\n\nA new dropdown to choose from project preview quality options to optimize performance\n\nTargeted speed improvements on importing clips into the library and exporting final projects\n\n*Pinnacle Studio Smart Proxy supports the Apple ProRes format, but quality is limited to 4:2:2 8-bit.\n\nOther Enhancements\n\nENHANCED! Keyframe Editing\n\nWith newly added keyframe management options, it’s easy to manipulate groups of keyframes for quick replication of your customizations, such as looping animations, light flashes, custom pan and zoom animations, complex sequences of changes to color or brightness, and more.\n\nCreate, copy, paste, and delete groups of keyframes across parameters (brightness, transparency, saturation, etc.) to another clip, or another parameter on the same clip.\n\nIMPROVED! User Interface\n\nEnjoy streamlined editing with enhanced usability across the product, thanks to improvements on the installation process, control panel options, in-product help, and more. Refreshed control panel sections provide more control over your editing experience, including options to reduce the demand on your computer; revised tooltips and interface strings deliver improved clarity and interpretability.\n\nIMPROVED! Tools and features performance across the product\n\nEnjoy improved title editing responsiveness and see changes applied to titles in the title preview much faster. Plus, manage your customized titles more effectively with updates to the accessibility of your saved presets.\n\nExtend the power of video masking with reduced mask editing response time for shape creation and editing, object tracking, and applying functions to the mask or matte for better playback performance."
