        "text": "Editing video is easier than ever, but as your experience with timelines and effects grows, you’re probably chaffing at the bit to do more. This is where Pinnacle Studio comes in, combining features used by professionals with a price tag that remains affordable.\n\nDespite its powerful feature set, Pinnacle Studio will still look familiar to anyone who’s edited video in modern software. Its workspace is both intuitive and familiar, with a timeline, elements you drag and drop into place, and preview window exactly where you expect them to be.\n\nThe program prides itself on making its pro-level tools accessible, encouraging users to discover through experimentation. This way you can quickly start using tools like Stop Motion Animation, MultiCam Editing, Split Screen Video and more.\n\nPinnacle Studio also offers a wide range of colour tools, including colour correction, selective colour and the ability to apply instant colour grading effects for mood. In addition, users can apply a range of motion graphics and effects with tools like Time Remapping, Pan and Zoom and motion blur.\n\nIn addition, users have access to a wide range of storytelling tools, from creative filters and smooth transitions to custom titles. The app’s six-track timeline supports ultra-precise editing with support for keyframes, and users can even use the app to capture video with its Screen Recording feature, which supports simultaneous recording from multiple cameras.\n\nOther tools include video stabilisation, lens correction, green screen post-production effects and support for importing up to 8K video.\n\nTwo editions of the software are available – all core functions are found in Pinnacle Studio Standard, while Pinnacle Studio Ultimate offers even more professional-level tools as well as support for exporting at 4K and unlimited video and audio tracks.\n\nIncludes a 2-Device perpetual license for Windows computers."
