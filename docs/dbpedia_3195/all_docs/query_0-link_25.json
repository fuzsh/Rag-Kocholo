        "text": "Terrible mess\n\nI got Pinnacle Studio 24 very cheap in a software bundle, being tempted by all the additional content packs that came with it. It isn't worth what I paid. Skirting around the built-in 'buy upgrade now!' welcome screen I tried some very simple tasks and found it to be sluggish, buggy, and falling very short of delivering what it promises.\n\nWhen I tried to uninstall it, \"The setup encountered a problem\", and it failed to uninstall. There's a knowledge-base article about how to uninstall when the uninstaller fails, which instructs you to download a RegDelete utility, but without providing a download link.\n\nIt goes on to advise that you search your hard disk for files and folders with 'studio' in the name, and to maybe delete them, unless you're not sure, in which case you shouldn't..\n\nThanks for that, Corel.\n\nThere's much (much) better video-editing software available for free.\n\nDate of experience : August 01, 2024\n\nHigh End machines ONLY\n\nI HAD been a Pinnacle Studio user for years... since version 9, I am at wits end. Will not purchase this software again. The software freezes upon opening. If the software manages to open... it freezes and exits on the timeline. It stopped creating thumbnails for everything in the library, Pinnacle customer service is unwilling to help with any problem. Their answer is re-install. You can only do this so many times without getting absolutely boiled. I suggest unless you have an extremely high end machine... stay away. Corel has NO IDEA what the problem is. My machine is a 3200mhz quad core, 16 gig ram, high end AMD vid card. Windows 10. This is the ONLY program I have that gives me trouble. This is one of 5 programs loaded on this machine. Dedicated to video/audio/image editing. It's a sin, because IF the program worked properly, it could not be beat.\n\nDate of experience : July 19, 2024\n\nVerry buggy software\n\nI purchased the latest version of Pinnacle Studio 26 because I liked the interface in the trial version. Although I noticed some artifacts during the trial, the support team assured me that the full version had a more recent build and significant improvements. Encouraged by their recommendation, I made the purchase.\n\nHowever, after installing the full version, I encountered persistent issues with image artifacts. Despite weeks of communication with their support team, the problems remained unresolved. Frustrated, I decided to request a refund, but to my great disappointment, they stopped responding altogether.\n\nMy advice? Steer clear of this software—it’s a drain on your money, time, and nerves.\n\nDate of experience : June 30, 2024\n\nHorrible\n\nHorrible. Worked fine for me until a newer version came out and all of a sudden the software won't function and there a no help pages or forums for it. It seems as if it was bricked as all my other programs still work perfectly.\n\nDate of experience : June 05, 2024\n\nExpensive Frustration for Beginners\n\nNot worth the money. Their software is unstable and troubleshooting is next to impossible. I'm using Studio 26 Ultimate and have nothing but crashes, random files not rendering, and clunky tools. Even though I paid for it, I'm going to cut my losses and start looking for another editor.\n\nDate of experience : February 05, 2024\n\nI've been using their products for …\n\nI've been using their products for about 15 years and on the whole I've been very satisfied.\n\nOccasionally the latest version hasn't been all it's cracked up to be but Avid from Pinnacle & Studio 20 are great examples if recent upgrades or versions. Just wish they would reward product or brand loyalty customers a bit more with reductions in upgrades.\n\nDate of experience : June 09, 2017\n\nOnly giving 1 star because 0 isnt an…\n\nOnly giving 1 star because 0 isnt an option. AVOID AVOID AVOID\n\nTheir customer service is reprehensible. Rather than giving any useful help, their help was to buy a newer product.\n\nThere are better products that are cheaper and actually provide customer assistance.\n\nThis abject contempt for customers deserves to see them go bankrupt.\n\nDate of experience : January 24, 2024\n\nI am glad i read these reviews.\n\nI am glad i read these reviews before I wasted my money on Pinnacle Studio. I have tried the trial version on my HP Z800 workstation with 72gb of memory, and it wouldn't even import any video files or even play the demo media.\n\nI installed the trial on my laptop with slightly better results, but it would not import some avi or mpeg files.\n\nI am trying out Corel VideoStudio 2022, and that is far better.\n\nDate of experience : March 31, 2022\n\nThis program gave me ptsd\n\nThis program gave me friking ptsd.It cant handel any friking project,it crashes at the eazyest things,and they dont even update theyr pinacle so that is useble until they release the next version.Worst money spend.If you are a masoqist i recomand,anything that can go wrong will go wrong.The only upside of this program is that it has an excelent safe function that automaticlu restors your last crash.Otherwize buy filmora pro or sonyvegas or premier,even videopad is beter\n\nDate of experience : November 30, 2020\n\nWorst video editing app I have ever used.\n\nWorst video editing app I have ever used in my life. it's so buggy it's unusable, it crashes frequently, and the user interface is completely unreliable. It will also bog down your PC for no reason whatsoever and does not utilise more than 4 cpu cores. Free video editors are much much better than this one.\n\nDate of experience : December 18, 2022\n\nPinnacle Studio 23\n\nI bought this software Pinnacle Studio 23 because they offered a full refund if i was unsatisfied.\n\nThe software is buggy, many of the tools and features did not function and this caused me great misery.\n\nI asked for my money back as clearly the product was faulty, perhaps rushed to market unfinished.\n\nAt any rate DO NOT BUY. They refused to refund my purchase:\n\n\"Thank you for contacting Corel Customer Support.\n\nWe've forwarded your issue to the concern team and there is no fix as of now. Please await for an update. Thanks for your time and patience..\n\nThank you,\n\nNishanth\n\nCorel Customer Support\"\n\nDate of experience : July 25, 2020\n\nThis software is love or hate\n\nThis software is love or hate, it is so buggy. I bought pinnacle 26 as I don't have that much spare income and what to edit.\n\nConstant crashes, exports fail to finish, telly slow when editing.\n\nAnd then on another occasion all fine not a problem\n\nMy computer is more than upto the task of editing by far I just do not understand the issues, and support is terrible, so bad infact I stopped trying.\n\nDate of experience : February 22, 2023\n\nCorel Pinnacle Ultimate 23 - another review\n\nI find myself writing another review about Pinnacle Studio 23 and this time I’m reducing my star rating.\n\nHaving contacted the ‘so called customer services’ I just get cut and pasted platitudes and it’s obvious the advisor hasn’t read my email.\n\nMy latest frustration was :-\n\nYou haven’t answered my question!\n\nWHAT WAS THE LATEST VERSION TO SUPPORT 3D?\n\nPlease escalate this to a manager or director.\n\nYou are not able to deal with this yourself.\n\nI will go to Facebook and trustpilot to escalate myself if you don’t offer me a satisfactory result.\n\nI am now getting frustrated and cross with you.\n\nI have suggested you swap Ultimate 23 for the latest working 3D version which I think is more than reasonable on my behalf. I will let forums know of your intransigence.\n\nMichael McKee\n\nDate of experience : November 13, 2019\n\nUtterly garbage\n\nIt's incredibly slow, hard to navigate, and it constantly screws up commands. Often when you enter one command, it will perform a different and sometimes completely unrelated action. For example, I've noticed that it will sometimes arbitrarily cut the file at a random spot; and nothing will undo that action. You will be forced to exit the project completely and re-import the original video file if this happens. This program is absolutely infuriating to use, and it's a total waste of money. DO NOT BUY.\n\nDate of experience : November 23, 2021\n\nGlad to see I'm not going insane\n\nGlad to see I'm not going insane. I started with Pinnacle 17. Had absolutely no issues, loved it. Tons of features and decently simple to use. HOWEVER! knowing my love for this software, my hubby got me version 22 and yes, it crashes. All. The. Time. I have to save constantly and it got so frustrating that i stopped making videos. Literally thought it was me but obviously everyone else has this problem and it's a shame because it has soooo much potential. If i could return it i would.\n\nDate of experience : September 24, 2021\n\nHorrible support on faulty software. read below.\n\nfrom Corel:\n\nYour case is escalated for further troubleshooting, there have been reports from other users that after installing the latest Studio 19.5.1 update, Studio crashes/freezes when apply reverse/speed effect on a clip. Similar issue is reported to engineering and they are looking into it.\n\nIn the mean time you can downgrade to Studio 19.5.0 and continue your work.\n\nwhat????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI will take a refund. They finally told me the truth after mailing back and forth 20 times where they NEVER read my mail to the end OR looked at the screenshots.\n\nUPDATE: They refunded me. I think they were just unlucky with outsourced support. Pinnacle, please get proper English writing support people. I communicated with \"Noel\" but he always only read the first 5 words of my mails..I did not get even ONE proper answer.\n\nDate of experience : February 01, 2017\n\nPinnacle Studio 24 has to be the worst…\n\nPinnacle Studio 24 has to be the worst video application ever launched. It is not possible to trust this program at all. Crashes and templates disappear and do not return even if you reinstall the program. You risk losing all the work you have done. Once I had Studio 18 which worked ok. After updating to version 24, this program is now useless. Pinnaccle 24 is a complete nightmare. Stay away.\n\nDate of experience : October 10, 2021\n\nPinnacle Studio23 issues and support sucks\n\nBought Pinnacle 23 and installed it to find out the Import Previous projects does not work. Talked to a few support people and all they said is to rebuild the project from scratch in the new version.\n\nThis feature always worked in previous versions. Also the installation has not installed all features and it's been three days and still waiting for support to get back with a solution.\n\nSupport sucks!\n\nDate of experience : November 23, 2019"
