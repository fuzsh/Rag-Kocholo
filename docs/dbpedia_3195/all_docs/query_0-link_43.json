At the start everything was fine but when PS freezed due to some error (e.g. mkv file playback) the PS losts its sound in Windows 10, so no audio at all in PS.\n\nI tried to reinstall, reset, remove, but nothing helped. The audio mixer in Windows is working correctly. I also have Pinnacle Studio v20 and installed it, but no sound either.\n\nThe Corel support couldn't help, I am struggling with this already for over a month already.\n\nIn Pinnacle Studio there is no setting to change the output audio device, no option for factory reset in this regard...\n\nDo you have any idea?\n\nKind regards, Ferenc"
