Avid Studio Pro was comprised of sophisticated editing tools, powerful media management, unlimited timeline tracks and a lot more which made it a professional video editing software. Avid studio retained its place after Avid acquired Pinnacle Studio, a competitor software because it was meant for more professional use. In 2012 Corel bought Avid studio and Pinnacle studio together and merged them as Pinnacle Studio. The name is lost but Avid Studioâ€™s powerful features are still present in the latest Pinnacle Studio."
