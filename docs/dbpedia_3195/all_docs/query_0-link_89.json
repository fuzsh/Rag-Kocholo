        "text": "Released - September 2009\n\nOperating Systems - XP, Vista and Windows 7\n\nVersions - Studio 14 HD, Studio 14 Ultimate, Studio 14 Ultimate Collection\n\nLatest Build - 14.0\n\nStandard Definition Hardware Requirements\n\nIf you want to edit Standard Definition video on any version of Pinnacle Studio 14, the hardware requirement are listed by Pinnacle as:\n\nWindows® 7, Windows Vista® (SP2),Windows XP (SP3)\n\nIntel® Pentium® or AMD Athlon™ 1.8 GHz (2.4 GHz or higher recommended)\n\n1 GB system memory recommended\n\nDirectX® 9 or 10 compatible graphics card with 64 MB (128 MB or higher recommended)\n\nDirectX 9 or higher compatible sound card\n\n3.2 GB of disk space\n\nDVD-ROM drive to install software\n\nYou will also need a CD burner to create Video CDs and Super Video CDs, a DVD burner to create DVD and AVCHD discs, and a bluray burner if you want to create Blu-Ray discs.\n\nTo preview surround sound you will need a suitable sound card.\n\nThe Magic Bullet Looks plug-in that is included in Ultimate Collection requires a graphics card with 128 MB of memory (for SD) with Pixelshader. Intel GMA integrated graphics aren't supported for this plug-in.\n\nHigh Definition Hardware Requirements\n\nThe processor requirements for HD editing are a little confusing. To edit HDV or 1080 Mpeg2 video, the requirements are the same as SD, but performance will be more sluggish. 720i/p AVCHD video requires a Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 GHz or higher. The i7 is also mentioned, but it seems the i3 and i5 weren't around when the program was tested.\n\nIf you want to edit 1920x1080 AVCHD video, the CPU minimum speed goes up to 2.66 GHz and a four core CPU is specified.\n\nPinnacle don't even mention AMD CPUs. Experience shows that a Phenom X4 with a clock speed of 3.2 GHz gives reasonable editing performance for 1920*1080 AVCHD.\n\n2 GB of system memory are recommended for AVCHD.\n\nGraphics memory requirements for the Magic Bullet Looks plug-in goes up to 256 MB for HD and AVCHD.\n\nIf you want to take advantage of the Ultimate and Ultimate collection's ability to burn Blu-Ray discs you will need a Blu-Ray burner.\n\nNew features\n\nThe Importer section of the program has been completely rewritten, bringing together the Capture, Import from media and Import from DVD sections of the program. Import from AVCHD/BD disc and stop motion capture from a live source have been added.\n\nA totally new Title creation tool, the Motion Title Editor, has been added. It is capable of adding Entry, Emphasis and Exit motions to titles, but cannot produce rolling or crawling titles, nor can it edit menus, so the old title editor, Title Deko, is retained.\n\nA Project bin feature.\n\nThe album now has a scroll bar rather than pages, and a drop down favourites folder selection tool.\n\nThe ability to copy and paste effects between clips.\n\nRight-click option to open in Windows Explorer.\n\nAlbum check marks for AVCHD, TOD.\n\nRotate still images directly in the album - photos that have been shot in portrait mode can be rotated before you add them to the timeline.\n\nAvid Media Composer Fluid Stabiliser plug-in.\n\nNew titles, menus and effects.\n\nSoundstage structure allows for third party music generation software similar to Scorefitter.\n\nImprovement to Montages. 7 new Themes - Album 2, Antique Journal, Downtown Lights, Extreme, Sliding Tiles, Tribute 2, Video Ball. Improved trimming, font adjustment and background options.\n\nExport between markers allows sections of projects to be exported to file.\n\nExport presets for MP3 audio, PS3, Wii and Xbox. Export to AVCHD is improved.\n\nExport to YouTube now works in Widescreen. You now need to apply a patch for this to work - see Studio 14.0 YouTube patch\n\nCapture Hardware support\n\nWith the introduction of the new importer, the ability to capture from many capture hardware devices has been removed. The Canopus range of firewire attached capture devices still work, but 3rd party USB connected devices and the use of the All-In-Wonder video cards are no longer supported.\n\nIn addition, many of the older Pinnacle devices cannot be used. Pinnacle list the following devices as no longer supported.\n\nDC10\n\nDC10 Plus\n\nMovieBox DV\n\nDazzle DVC 80, 85\n\nLinx\n\nMP 10\n\nS400\n\nDazzle DVC-150\n\nMovieBox USB\n\nMP 20\n\nDVC 150\n\nDSC 200\n\nPinnacle list the following devices as working with all versions of Studio 14 and a 32-bit operating system\n\n710-USB\n\n510-USB\n\n700-USB\n\n500-USB\n\nMovieBox Deluxe\n\nDVC-90\n\nDVC-100\n\nDVC-101\n\nDVC-103\n\nDVC-107\n\nDVC-130\n\nDVC-170\n\n700-PCI\n\nPinnacle Studio Deluxe 2\n\n500-PCI\n\nPinnacle AV/DV\n\nAny 1394 cards.\n\n64-bit limitations\n\nThe majority of the above list can be used with 64-bit operating systems. The exceptions are the DVC-130 and DVC 170, where no 64-bit drivers exist. In addition, the 64-bit drivers of the PCI interface cards have a serious bug, causing a BSOD when used on systems with more that 2Gb of RAM. As one of the main reasons for installing a 64-bit OS is to enable the use of more that 4Gb of RAM, this makes the drivers effectively useless.\n\nDifferences between versions\n\nThe three version available differ in the features they have, but fundamental design of all the versions is the same.\n\nThe basic version is Studio 14 HD. As it's name implies, it can edit in High Definition. File import from HD cameras is supported but there are no High Definition analogue capture devices available for Studio 14.\n\nStudio 14 Ultimate upgrades the editing features and adds two Red Giant plug-ins - Knoll Light Factory and ToonIt\n\nStudio 14 Ultimate Collection has all the features of Ultimate and adds four more Red Giant plug-ins - Magic Bullet - Looks, Trapcode 3D Stroke, Trapcode Particular, Shine.\n\nAll version of Studio 14 are activated with the following formats:\n\nPAL\n\nNTSC\n\nMPEG2\n\nDivX*\n\nMPEG4*\n\nMP3\n\nDolby 2 Channel\n\nAAC*\n\nAMR Audio*\n\nThose marked with an asterisk require free activation using the internet.\n\nDolby 5.1 channel audio is included with Studio Ultimate and Ultimate Collection\n\nImport\n\nAll versions can import the following formats:\n\n3 GPP\n\nAVI\n\nDivX\n\nDVD Title Import\n\nHDV\n\nMPEG1\n\nMPEG2\n\nMPEG4\n\nProgressive scan MPEG2\n\nWMV\n\nAVCHD/BD\n\n.tod\n\nAC3\n\nPCTV MPEG PS: ATSC, DVB-T, DVB-S\n\nPCLE Video Transfer files\n\nQT mov (DV/MPEG4)\n\nStudio 14 HD Limitations\n\nS14 HD has fewer restriction than previous entry level versions of Pinnacle Studio. You can edit HD, and you also get the extra video/audio track for overlay and picture-in-picture. However, there are still limitations:"
