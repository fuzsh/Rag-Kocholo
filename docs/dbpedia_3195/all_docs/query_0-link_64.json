        "text": "Best settings for Pinnacle Studio\n\nAVI: Bandicam settings for Pinnacle Studio (Recommended for most users)\n\nTo edit the recorded video with Pinnacle Studio with the AVI file type, choose the \"Motion JPEG\" and \"PCM\" codecs.\n\nMotion JPEG (M-JPEG or MJPEG) is a video format in which each video frame is a JPEG image. In other words, each frame is a keyframe, allowing you to edit the recorded video easily.\n\nIf you want to keep the original video quality, try using the \"Lagarith lossless codec\" instead of \"Motion JPEG.\"\n\nIf you have an audio sync issue with the \"Motion JPEG\" and \"PCM\" codecs, reduce the video resolution of the recording target and reduce the video size, FPS, and video quality of Bandicam.\n\nMP4: Bandicam settings for Pinnacle Studio (Recommended for advanced users)\n\nTo edit the recorded video with the MP4 file type, choose the \"H264\" and \"AAC\" codecs and change the value of the Keyframe Interval to 1. If you change \"Keyframe Interval\" from \"150\" to \"1,\" all frames will become keyframes, allowing you to edit a video more precisely.\n\nNote 1: If the Keyframe Interval is set to 1, the file size will increase.\n\nNote 2: If Bandicam is set to 30 FPS, 30 frames will be created per second (60 frames per 2 seconds, 90 frames per 3 seconds, 120 frames per 4 seconds, 150 frames per 5 seconds, etc.). If the Keyframe Interval is set to 150, one keyframe will be created every 5 seconds (= 150 frames).\n\nOther advanced user tipsÂ»\n\nHow to start Recording Automatically - Scheduled Recording\n\nHow to record 24 hours & 365 days - Computer Blackbox\n\nHow to record dual/multiple monitors\n\nHow to record webcam view and microphone\n\nHow to record capture card video and audio\n\nHow to edit the recorded video with editing programs\n\nHow to add your face on your gameplay or video tutorial\n\nHow to upload videos to YouTube from Bandicam\n\nHow to upload videos to Vimeo from Bandicam\n\nHow to use Chroma Key - Green Screen Recorder\n\nHow to choose the best video codec for recording software\n\nHow to record \"computer sound\" and \"your voice\"\n\nHow to Draw on Your PC Screen\n\nHow to record Windows Games/Apps (UWP) in MS Store\n\nHow to Use Command-Line Parameters with Bandicam\n\nHow to Record Remote Desktop Computer\n\nHow To Record a Video with Better Quality\n\nHow to use Nvidia NVENC encoder - HEVC vs H264\n\nHow to use Intel Quick Sync Video encoder - HEVC vs H264\n\nHow to use AMD VCE(APP) encoder - HEVC vs H264"
