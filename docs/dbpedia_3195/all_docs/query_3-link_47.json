        "text": "Create professional movies with many effects.\n\nPinnacle Studio is a top-notch video editing program built to produce the absolutely most professional videos you can at home or in a small studio. This video editor includes some of the newest technology in video editing and has also made some improvements in performance in terms of memory usage and speed. A simple 3-step process can be used by importing, editing and then creating your final video.\n\nWith Pinnacle Studio, you can import your video or photo files (AVI, MOV, 3GP, JPG and more) and create stunning end-product videos which you are free to publish on DVDs, Blu-rays (complete with menus) or even to popular video sharing web sites like YouTube, Dailymotion or Vimeo.\n\nThe software comes fully packed with around 1800 different video effects, titles and other content related to video and audio editing for within Pinnacle Studio HD. The effects included with Pinnacle Studio HD include various themes and can range from Sports, Space, Weddings, Comics, Topical Climate and a bunch more. Custom effects can also be created using the included HFX editor utility.\n\nIn addition, a recent change Avid has made to their Pinnacle product line in a new archiving function which can redo and undo edits you've made to your projects.\n\nEditing videos and applying effects\n\nEditing videos is a snap. Along with the many cool effects and transitions you can apply, working with new image and video sources is easy thanks to their drag-and-drop interface. You can grab your media files from a range of different sources, not limited to things like personal video cameras, digital cameras, mobile phones and from DVD discs.\n\nWhen dealing with video clips, Pinnacle Studio does a great job at applying animations, transitions and other effects. Color corrections allow you to fix video files that appear dull while stabilization filters are a good way to fix shaky and unstable footage; vibrations are easily fixed with this program.\n\nAlong with editing for 2D video files, this video editing application also offers impressive effects and editing capabilities for 3D files. They can be played back on televisions and monitors that support 3D content and in some cases, a set of glasses are required to be able to really enjoy the effects.\n\nWhile you're making your movies, you're also able to preview your work in real-time using a built-in media player which can be viewed in either a window or in full screen.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, Pinnacle Studio has made some excellent improvements to their editing suite over the years and using the application is pretty simple after overcoming a slight learning curve. It's also one of the few video editors on the market that support the creation and manipulation of 3D content.\n\nFeatures of Pinnacle Studio\n\nIntegrates with DailyMotion, Facebook, Vimeo and YouTube.\n\n3D Video Editing: Convert 2D footage into 3D and create 3D titles and effects.\n\n360-Degree Video Editing: Create immersive projects with video captured in 360 degrees.\n\nAudio Ducking: Automatically lower the volume of background music when dialogue is detected.\n\nChroma Key: Remove backgrounds from your footage and replace with custom backgrounds.\n\nColor Grading: Adjust the color and lighting of your footage for a professional look.\n\nCreative Effects: Choose from over 1,500 creative effects, transitions and templates.\n\nDisc Authoring: Burn your projects to DVD and Blu-ray Disc, or export to the web.\n\nMotion Graphics: Add titles, graphics and animations to your projects.\n\nMotion Tracking: Track moving objects in your video and apply effects to them.\n\nMulti-Camera Editing: Create split-screen effects and edit footage from multiple cameras.\n\nScreen Recording: Record from your computer screen with audio.\n\nStop Motion Animation: Capture photos, arrange frames and animate them to create a movie.\n\nTimeline Editing: Easily arrange clips, audio and photos in the timeline, adjust the speed and create overlays.\n\nVideo Stabilization: Remove camera shake and jitter from your footage.\n\nCompatibility and License\n\nThis download is licensed as shareware for the Windows operating system from audio and video editors and can be used as a free trial until the trial period ends (after an unspecified number of days).
