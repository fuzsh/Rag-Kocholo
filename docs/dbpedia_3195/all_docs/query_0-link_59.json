        "text": "Both options will achieve most of what you need (possibly not PSDs, but you can use transparent TGAs exported from Photoshop), however Premiere Pro is a far more powerful and professional option. If you don't like the idea of subscribing, I believe Premiere Pro CS6 is still available for one time purchase.\n\nAlternately, Sony's Vegas Pro is also a highly capable professional level software NLE if you want to really maintain the feel and level of functionality of Premiere Pro without buying in to a platform that has moved to the rental model.\n\nPersonally, I work with Adobe Premiere CS6 and plan to move to Vegas when it gets too old unless Adobe comes to their senses and allows me to buy software again."
