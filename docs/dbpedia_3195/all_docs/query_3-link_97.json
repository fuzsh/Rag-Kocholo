I am willing to pay more for a program that works all the time than less for a program that does work reliably. I have turned out several excellent DVD's with Studio, but I do not like what I have to go through to get this result. I am very tired of \"work arounds.\"\n\nWhile I am pretty proficient with Studio, I have a couple questions with regard to Vegas 4.0 and DVD Architect:\n\n(I am using all analog capture via Pinnacle hardware and Scenalyzer. I have capture down fine and that is that. I am considering upgrading to a Canopus product, but not for now. I have a (homebuilt) AMD XP2400, 1 GB or RAM, 6 hard drives (600 GB total), etc. I am \"ready to go,\" but need good software to do it.)\n\n1.) It appears that for scene selection/breakdown, that in my case I would have to do it manually. Is this correct?\n\n2.) It looks like I need to split up the scenes to add transitions between events on the video. Then, and only then, can I add the desired transitions between these seperate video segments. Is this correct? This kind of goes back to question #1.\n\n3.) Could you please tell me, how could I for example, take sections of one video and switch them around? In Studio this is very easy, but I'm just not gettin' it on Vegas. For example, how could I take minute 3 of a video and place it between minute 1 and 2 of the same video. Whenever I start selecting things at the top of the timeline, I get more items selected than I want. I know this is from my lack of experience with Vegas. Is there a simple explanation of reordering sections within the same video?\n\n4.) What sort of integration, if any, is there with SmartSound? I really like Smartsound and want to continue using it. Is there any integration with Vegas 4.0? Or would I need to add the sound track as a seperate evolution with SmartSound software?\n\n5.) (Last question) Is there the ability to do motion backgrounds/menus with DVD Architect? Again, Studio made this very easy, but I am not seeing it in DVD Architect. Can one buy/purchase more motion backgrounds?\n\nThank you very much for your help in answering these questions.\n\nComments\n\nReport as questionable\n\nAre you sure you want to report this postuser as questionable?\n\nYou may be blocked if you misuse this feature!"
