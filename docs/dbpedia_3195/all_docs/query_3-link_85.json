        "text": "COMPLETE REVIEW\n\nPinnacle Studio 20 Plus comes with all the basic video editing tools we looked for in similar software when we were writing our review. It allows you to create unique projects by importing and manipulating media content. Because of its very simple and intuitive design, the app is suitable for users of all video editing abilities. Since the software has a very small learning curve, anyone in your family can fully master the product with minimal effort. Pinnacle’s editing option will give you the opportunity to turn any amateur video into a fine-tuned film.\n\nPerformance and Features\n\nLike most other video editors in our review, the Pinnacle Studio 20 Plus has two general operating modes: timeline and storyboard. This software is among the few that has both video editing modules in the same window. This allows for greater flexibility since you can easily go from the timeline to storyboard and vice-versa. The timeline module is actually a linear overview of all the video clips and media you wish to include in you project, while the storyboard is more complex showing you each media item individually allowing higher editing possibilities.\n\nAlthough it’s not the most we’ve encountered during our review process, Pinnacle Studio 20 Plus comes with 24 media editing tracks which should be enough even for more complicated projects. Each of the 24 tracks comes with its own mixer so you can edit each audio file to your liking. You also have the option of doing deep edits on both video and audio, meaning you’re getting a very high level of personalization. In addition, Pinnacle Studio 20 Plus has one of the largest objects libraries on the market. With over 1,800 effects, transitions and templates you’re getting the opportunity to further modify and perfect your final project.\n\nPinnacle Studio 20 Plus comes with a rather modern interface that can be somewhat intimidating to novice users, but after you’ve spent some time in the app you’ll realize that all functions are very simple and easy to use. To help you overcome the small learning curve you might come upon when first using the software, this video editor comes with a short video tutorial that shows how a media file is should look on the timeline. If you’re still struggling, you can access Pinnacle’s online community and exchange experiences with other users.\n\nLike most other video editors in our review, this video editing software comes with a multi-cam module. Since most amateur videos today are taken by smartphones, you might get into a situation where you’ll have several different videos of the same event, just from different angles. This is where the multi-cam mode comes in by allowing you to upload up to four clips of the same event, you can then merge and further polish it so it finally looks as if it were shot by a single camera. This particular feature has a small learning curve, but it’s not anything you won’t be able to overcome.\n\nAlthough Pinnacle Studio 20 Plus has many useful video editing tools, it’s missing some essentials in the advanced editing section. If you’ve used this type of app before, you’ll probably notice that the Pinnacle doesn’t have a motion stabilizer nor does it have a tool that would allow you to create and modify 360-degree video. This software also doesn’t support ultra-high definition 4K video.\n\nWhen you’ve finished your project, Pinnacle Studio 20 Plus gives you several options for exporting and sharing it with a wider audience. In case you want to simply save your finished product on your hard drive, the app lets you do so in all major file formats (MP4, AVI and MOV). To share it more publicly online, you can upload your video to YouTube, Facebook and Vimeo directly from the program which saves you a lot of time from doing it individually on each website. This video editor also lets you optimize your video for smoother playback on specific devices like smartphones, consoles or tablets.\n\nFeatures:"
