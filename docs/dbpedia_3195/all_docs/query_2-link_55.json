        "text": "Solved by\n\nI am considering buying Power Directory and have downloaded a trial version. A good deal of my video material consists of one-hour long AVI files that were imported from tapes using Pinnacle Studio 7. When importing tapes, Studio creates a very useful scenes file that contains the precise scene structure of the AVI.\n\nIt would seem that Power Director is unable to use the scenes file and needs to plough through 13GB of AVI data per hour to detect scenes. My PC is not that slow, but it still takes several minutes per file to do that.\n\nIs there a way to make Power Director aware of Studio scene files?\n\nBy the way, I would be happy to continue using Studio 7, but I don't get it to work on Windows 10 (not even Windows 7). I am not interested in buying newer Studio products either.\n\nQuote It would seem that Power Director is unable to use the scenes file and needs to plough through 13GB of AVI data per hour to detect scenes.

You may want to find an app to read that scn file. I remember that that there were 5 different files created with each capture and they work together and cannot be separated from the Pinnacle Studio old versions to use separately with any other software.\n\nThis answered my question"
