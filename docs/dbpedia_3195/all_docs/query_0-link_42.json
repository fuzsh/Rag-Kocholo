        "text": "Smartsound/Avid/Pinnacle Partnership\n\nWhat is the \"Studio\" series from Pinnacle?\n\nPinnacle’s Studio video editing software is software that allows people to create and edit movies. It comes in a variety of configurations depending on your needs and these various configurations all support Smartsound Quicktracks music scoring software. If you have version 10 or earlier, Smartsound Quicktracks should already be on your computer.\n\nSmartsound Quicktracks opens up a new world of musical choice and style available only from Smartsound.
