        "text": "Terrible mess\n\nI got Pinnacle Studio 24 very cheap in a software bundle, being tempted by all the additional content packs that came with it. It isn't worth what I paid. Skirting around the built-in 'buy upgrade now!' welcome screen I tried some very simple tasks and found it to be sluggish, buggy, and falling very short of delivering what it promises.\n\nWhen I tried to uninstall it, \"The setup encountered a problem\", and it failed to uninstall. There's a knowledge-base article about how to uninstall when the uninstaller fails, which instructs you to download a RegDelete utility, but without providing a download link.\n\nIt goes on to advise that you search your hard disk for files and folders with 'studio' in the name, and to maybe delete them, unless you're not sure, in which case you shouldn't..\n\nThanks for that, Corel.\n\nThere's much (much) better video-editing software available for free.\n\nDate of experience : August 01, 2024\n\nHigh End machines ONLY\n\nI HAD been a Pinnacle Studio user for years... since version 9, I am at wits end. Will not purchase this software again. The software freezes upon opening. If the software manages to open... it freezes and exits on the timeline. It stopped creating thumbnails for everything in the library, Pinnacle customer service is unwilling to help with any problem. Their answer is re-install. You can only do this so many times without getting absolutely boiled. I suggest unless you have an extremely high end machine... stay away. Corel has NO IDEA what the problem is. My machine is a 3200mhz quad core, 16 gig ram, high end AMD vid card. Windows 10. This is the ONLY program I have that gives me trouble. This is one of 5 programs loaded on this machine. Dedicated to video/audio/image editing. It's a sin, because IF the program worked properly, it could not be beat.\n\nDate of experience : July 19, 2024\n\nVerry buggy software\n\nI purchased the latest version of Pinnacle Studio 26 because I liked the interface in the trial version. Although I noticed some artifacts during the trial, the support team assured me that the full version had a more recent build and significant improvements. Encouraged by their recommendation, I made the purchase.\n\nHowever, after installing the full version, I encountered persistent issues with image artifacts. Despite weeks of communication with their support team, the problems remained unresolved. Frustrated, I decided to request a refund, but to my great disappointment, they stopped responding altogether.\n\nMy advice? Steer clear of this software—it’s a drain on your money, time, and nerves.\n\nDate of experience : June 30, 2024\n\nHorrible\n\nHorrible. Worked fine for me until a newer version came out and all of a sudden the software won't function and there a no help pages or forums for it. It seems as if it was bricked as all my other programs still work perfectly.\n\nDate of experience : June 05, 2024\n\nExpensive Frustration for Beginners\n\nNot worth the money. Their software is unstable and troubleshooting is next to impossible. I'm using Studio 26 Ultimate and have nothing but crashes, random files not rendering, and clunky tools. Even though I paid for it, I'm going to cut my losses and start looking for another editor.\n\nDate of experience : February 05, 2024\n\nOnly giving 1 star because 0 isnt an…\n\nOnly giving 1 star because 0 isnt an option. AVOID AVOID AVOID\n\nTheir customer service is reprehensible. Rather than giving any useful help, their help was to buy a newer product.\n\nThere are better products that are cheaper and actually provide customer assistance.\n\nThis abject contempt for customers deserves to see them go bankrupt.\n\nDate of experience : January 24, 2024\n\nI am glad i read these reviews.\n\nI am glad i read these reviews before I wasted my money on Pinnacle Studio. I have tried the trial version on my HP Z800 workstation with 72gb of memory, and it wouldn't even import any video files or even play the demo media.\n\nI installed the trial on my laptop with slightly better results, but it would not import some avi or mpeg files.\n\nI am trying out Corel VideoStudio 2022, and that is far better.\n\nDate of experience : March 31, 2022\n\nThis program gave me ptsd\n\nThis program gave me friking ptsd.It cant handel any friking project,it crashes at the eazyest things,and they dont even update theyr pinacle so that is useble until they release the next version.Worst money spend.If you are a masoqist i recomand,anything that can go wrong will go wrong.The only upside of this program is that it has an excelent safe function that automaticlu restors your last crash.Otherwize buy filmora pro or sonyvegas or premier,even videopad is beter\n\nDate of experience : November 30, 2020\n\nI've been using their products for …\n\nI've been using their products for about 15 years and on the whole I've been very satisfied.\n\nOccasionally the latest version hasn't been all it's cracked up to be but Avid from Pinnacle & Studio 20 are great examples if recent upgrades or versions. Just wish they would reward product or brand loyalty customers a bit more with reductions in upgrades.\n\nDate of experience : June 09, 2017\n\nWorst video editing app I have ever used.\n\nWorst video editing app I have ever used in my life. it's so buggy it's unusable, it crashes frequently, and the user interface is completely unreliable. It will also bog down your PC for no reason whatsoever and does not utilise more than 4 cpu cores. Free video editors are much much better than this one.\n\nDate of experience : December 18, 2022\n\nThis software is love or hate\n\nThis software is love or hate, it is so buggy. I bought pinnacle 26 as I don't have that much spare income and what to edit.\n\nConstant crashes, exports fail to finish, telly slow when editing.\n\nAnd then on another occasion all fine not a problem\n\nMy computer is more than upto the task of editing by far I just do not understand the issues, and support is terrible, so bad infact I stopped trying.\n\nDate of experience : February 22, 2023\n\nUtterly garbage\n\nIt's incredibly slow, hard to navigate, and it constantly screws up commands. Often when you enter one command, it will perform a different and sometimes completely unrelated action. For example, I've noticed that it will sometimes arbitrarily cut the file at a random spot; and nothing will undo that action. You will be forced to exit the project completely and re-import the original video file if this happens. This program is absolutely infuriating to use, and it's a total waste of money. DO NOT BUY.\n\nDate of experience : November 23, 2021\n\nPinnacle Studio 24 has to be the worst…\n\nPinnacle Studio 24 has to be the worst video application ever launched. It is not possible to trust this program at all. Crashes and templates disappear and do not return even if you reinstall the program. You risk losing all the work you have done. Once I had Studio 18 which worked ok. After updating to version 24, this program is now useless. Pinnaccle 24 is a complete nightmare. Stay away.\n\nDate of experience : October 10, 2021\n\nPinnacle Studio23 issues and support sucks\n\nBought Pinnacle 23 and installed it to find out the Import Previous projects does not work. Talked to a few support people and all they said is to rebuild the project from scratch in the new version.\n\nThis feature always worked in previous versions. Also the installation has not installed all features and it's been three days and still waiting for support to get back with a solution.\n\nSupport sucks!\n\nDate of experience : November 23, 2019\n\nIt may be called Pinnacle but it is NOT…\n\nIt may be called Pinnacle but it is NOT the pinnacle of video editing. The software is fully featured and offers many options for the casual and expert video editor. But it has remained unstable throughout many iterations and Studio 24 is no exception. To put it simply, it crashes A LOT. Within one hour I had 5 crashes just navigating between menus. No even rendering or importing files. I am bewildered why Pinnacle allow this as they have failed to create a stable platform for video editing.\n\nI even reinstalled Windows 10 but I still crashes. I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with this latest release. It simply isn't fit for purpose.\n\nDate of experience : September 15, 2020\n\nPinnacle Studio 23\n\nI bought this software Pinnacle Studio 23 because they offered a full refund if i was unsatisfied.\n\nThe software is buggy, many of the tools and features did not function and this caused me great misery.\n\nI asked for my money back as clearly the product was faulty, perhaps rushed to market unfinished.\n\nAt any rate DO NOT BUY. They refused to refund my purchase:\n\n\"Thank you for contacting Corel Customer Support.\n\nWe've forwarded your issue to the concern team and there is no fix as of now. Please await for an update. Thanks for your time and patience..\n\nThank you,\n\nNishanth\n\nCorel Customer Support\"\n\nDate of experience : July 25, 2020\n\nCan't activate Product anymore\n\nI had to reinstall my PC a few times and now I can't activate Pinnacle Studio anymore because of message that Serial Number was used to many times. I tried to contact Customer Support, but never get an answer. I can throw away this Software now... Would never buy this trash again...\n\nDate of experience : January 12, 2022\n\nNothing good here\n\nNothing good here. Pinnacle studio 21 ultimate cannot open basic AVI contained files. I have tried mp4, h264/5. I am sure there is a combination that pennicle will open, just don't have the time for that crap. Really frustrated, having paid for this software and having a deadline to work towards with this software not behaving.\n\nDate of experience : December 02, 2019\n\nPinnacle 25 is utterly crap\n\nPinnacle 25 is utterly crap! Its full of so many bugs, crashes all the time. Even the playback stops working. Why did I both, should have stuck to Adobe Premier!\n\nI hope other poeple who are considering purchasing Pinnacle 25 read this review and steer clear, it not worth spend anything on the totally crap software.\n\nDate of experience : February 10, 2022"
