Pinnacle Studio

Software Overview

Corel Pinnacle Studio is a video editing application available for Windows. The video editor supports various formats and provides many editing capabilities for helping amateurs create polished-looking videos. The program is available in Standard and Ultimate editions.

Pinnacle Studio supports various video formats, including .MP4, .AVI, .WMV, .3GP, .MOV, and .MKV. Users can "edit like a pro" using the program's standard drag-and-drop editing interface, which lets editors drag media elements from their library into their project's timeline. From there, users can layer and edit audio tracks, videos, and visual effects to create their perfect movie.

The program's basic visual effects and editing tools include the ability to crop and zoom in on video clips, rotate and flip videos, and add titles, transitions, and other graphic design elements. Pinnacle Studio also provides keyframe controls, fast- and slow-motion effects, stop-motion animation capabilities, screen capture, and multi-camera editing. Those using the Ultimate edition of Pinnacle Studio also gain access to color grading, 360 video editing, dynamic split-screen video, motion tracking, and audio ducking.

Summary

Corel Pinnacle Studio is an excellent choice if you are looking for a capable video editing program for a great price. While it doesn't quite hold a candle to professional video editing software, it also doesn't carry nearly as hefty a price tag. Those who want a closer-to-pro editing experience can opt for the program's Ultimate version, which is a little more expensive but includes additional advanced features.
