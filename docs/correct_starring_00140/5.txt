Where to Watch

Homage to 1950s schlock director Edward D. Wood Jr., focusing on his friendship with Bela Lugosi. Wood was a surreal character: self-deluded, eternally optimisticâ€”and a heterosexual who enjoyed wearing women's clothing. He's become a cult icon thanks to the unintended humor of his schlock classics "Glen or Glenda?" (1952) and "Plan 9 from Outer Space" (1959).
