        "text": "Dr. Robbins selected Des Moines because, at the core of this community, he found a mirror image of his own personal values. Values like honesty, integrity, respect, loyalty, friendship, and being down to earth. “These characteristics are very important when choosing a plastic surgeon,” says Dr. Robbins, “and they are the foundation of my practice that the people of Des Moines and greater Iowa deserve and have come to expect.”\n\nDr. Robbins is Iowa’s ONLY quadruple board-certified plastic surgeon and has been practicing exclusively in cosmetic surgery for over 20 years. Dr. Robbins is Iowa’s ONLY quadruple board certified plastic surgeon. Dr. Robbins believes not only experience but also education is important for a successful medical practice. He is board-certified by:\n\nWhy Board Certification Is Important\n\nWhen selecting a plastic surgeon, it is essential that you confirm your surgeon is certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery (ABPS) under the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Dr. Robbins holds the distinction of being board-certified with the American Board of Plastic Surgery.\n\nIn many states, a licensed physician may perform cosmetic procedures without being board-certified in plastic surgery. And just because a doctor is board-certified does not necessarily mean they are certified by the ABPS.\n\nThe ABPS is the only one of the 24 boards approved by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) that certifies physicians in plastic surgery of the face and all areas of the body. The ABMS was established to protect patients by monitoring and regulating the quality of medical education\n\nBoard Certifications\n\nThe American Board of Plastic Surgery\n\nThe American Board of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery\n\nThe American Board of Cosmetic Surgery\n\nThe American Board of Laser Surgery\n\nGo to www.plasticsurgery.org or www.abfprs.org to learn more about board certification and to see if your surgeon is board-certified by the ABPS. It is important to understand what each board certification means and the validity of each of them. Not all plastic surgeons are board certified and not all plastic surgeons are board certified by the necessary boards that are relevant to their specialty or overall medical practice.\n\nDr. Robbins graduated magna cum laude from the Virginia Military Institute with a degree in chemistry. He served four years in the U.S. Army Reserves. He graduated with distinction from the Virginia Commonwealth University College of Dentistry. Dr. Robbins then attended medical school receiving his Medical Degree at The University of Nebraska. He completed three years of surgical training followed by a two-year plastic surgery fellowship at the University of Kentucky. Dr. Robbins has been practicing plastic surgery exclusively since 2002.\n\nDes Moines Plastic Surgery™ specializes exclusively in cosmetic surgery of the face, breast, and body. Dr. Robbins offers all of the latest procedures in cosmetic surgery and leads an aesthetic team for many non-surgical options. Dr. Robbins is also the Medical Director of Coachlight, the non-surgical aesthetic medspa that offers services including laser treatments to reduce signs of aging, wrinkles, pigmentation, acne scars, facial veins, as well as nonsurgical fat reduction, and skin tightening treatments like CoolSculpting, Exilis, and EMSCULPT. Coachlight also offers Botox, Dysport, lip & wrinkle fillers, HydraFacials, miraDry underarm sweat reduction, microdermabrasion, chemical peels, facials and many more aesthetic services.\n\nFor over a decade, Des Moines Plastic Surgery has been voted as Cityview Des Moines #1 Best Local Place for Aesthetic/Cosmetic Surgery. We value our customers and their experience at our facility. We also have been voted #1 Best Local Place for Non-Surgical Cosmetic Treatments in 2016 through 2024 with Coachlight, our non-surgical aesthetic center. Des Moines Plastic Surgery has also been given the 2017 Aesthetic Everything Diamond Award of Best Mid America Plastic Surgeon and Best Skin Care in America.\n\nDes Moines Plastic Surgery is also a member of the elite Allergan Black Diamond Partnership Program. The members are among the top 1% of plastic surgeons in the United States. Dr. Robbins is a leader in this Allergan community through his time serving as a national speaker on multiple platforms. This program honors distinguished physicians in cosmetic surgery for demonstrating expertise and excellence through a high volume of aesthetic product procedures such as breast implants, Botox® Cosmetic, Juvederm® wrinkle and lip fillers, SkinMedica® and Latisse®. Dr. Robbins has also served on the Medical Aesthetics Advisory Board for Allergan Medical Aesthetics. The board provides leadership in partnering for the future of aesthetics and focuses on future innovations in products, programs, and resources.\n\nHe also was among 175 surgeons across the U.S. selected as a consultant for Allergan (manufacturer of breast implants, Botox, fillers, and Coolsculpting) to attend the Plastic and Regenerative Medicine Advisory Board held in Denver, CO on June 3, 2017. The meeting was designed to bring together the busiest plastic surgeons in the US to discuss future growth of the industry, new products and procedures, and marketing strategies in collaboration with Allergan."
