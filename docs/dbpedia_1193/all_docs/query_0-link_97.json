        "text": "Shoes.\n\nThe length of her polka dot dress leaves her ankles and the upper part of her feet exposed. As she walks, her hips move from right to left, following the rapid pace of her steps. A strip of light starts from her feet, while her heels click on the ‘asphalt jungle’. She is carrying an orange shopping bag. On her right, another spot, slightly darker, shines. It illuminates a building belonging to the Bata chain (‘shoemakers to the world’). To which store this woman is taking her feet next is uncertain. Part of a collage of photographs composed in 1957 by David Collins for ARK 20, she is the cover image of ‘Shoes hair and coffee’, an article by Toni del Renzio.\n\nDel Renzio’s essay captures both a new mood in ARK and the developing interest in pop in British art during the late 1950s. Under Roger Coleman’s editorship, the magazine embraced the economic and social changes underway in Britain to kick back against the traditional views of ‘good taste’. ARK staked its place in contemporary society by publishing commentaries on mass-consumption, advertising and television (alongside serious-minded commentaries on the fine arts).[1] This was not simply a matter of a critical investigation of what one American commentator in the same year called ‘the Hidden Persuaders’.[2] The hierarchies which divided high and low were rocked by enthusiasm for mass and commercial culture by a new generation of artists, writers and taste-makers. ARK editor Coleman and the students working on the magazine shared, together with the Independent Group, the view that pop culture would revivify modernism.[3] And in his article, del Renzio warns against the “neurotic fear triggered by the sense of inadequacy that overtakes any intellectual who attempts to isolate himself and his activities from the society in which he finds himself”.\n\nDel Renzio issued an irreverent challenge to the architects of the day, celebrating the often “anonymous and spontaneous” cityscape of Italian cafés and fashion shops as evidence of “genuine urban folk art”.[4] This he contrasted with the design clichés which had been promoted by the Festival of Britain in 1951 (in his allusions to “spiky with knobs”), an event in which the Royal College of Art and its faculty had played an important part. In fact, del Renziocalls this major event the ‘Royal College Festival’ in the magazine.[5] He was by no means alone in his critique of the sentimental modernism which prevailed in Britain in the first half of the 1950s. Independent Group members Alison and Peter Smithson – the central figures in the development of New Brutalism – stand out (and in fact, their essay ‘But Today We Collect Ads’ appeared in the magazine).[6] What seems remarkable today is that women were identified by del Renzio as agents of innovation.\n\nHair.\n\nPerfectly brushed and fluttering in the air, flat or teased, alluring or discreet, women’s coiffure can be an incredible source of power, and del Renzio’s article gives a new brightness to it. During the post-war period, women’s access to the world of production and consumption was restricted, yet they were increasingly addressed as consumers by advertisers or by a new wave of hairdressing salons, shoe shops and boutiques."
