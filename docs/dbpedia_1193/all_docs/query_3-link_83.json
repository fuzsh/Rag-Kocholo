        "text": "On June 5, NRB member Campus Crusade for Christ International (Cru), named David Robbins as their fourth president, beginning July 2024.\n\nPrior to this role, Robbins served since 2017 as CEO of FamilyLife, also an NRB member organization and ministry of Cru which provides a plethora of resources for families in all areas—marriage, parenting, faith, blended and stepfamilies, and more.\n\nAs president, Robbins will help further Cru’s purpose of “helping to fulfill the Great Commission in the power of the Holy Spirit by winning people to faith in Jesus Christ, building them in their faith and sending them to win and build others.”\n\nRobbins has more than two decades of experience working with Cru, serving in various leadership roles and capacities over the years, including leading many student ministries across the nation and overseas.\n\n“Robbins has consistently demonstrated a passion for evangelism and discipleship, and a heart to reach the world,” the news release from Cru said.\n\nSteve Sellers, who has served in leadership at Cru since 1976, preceded Robbins as president and in January stepped into a new role with Cru.\n\n“I’ve spent nearly five decades dedicated to this ministry, and I believe the best years of our ministry are still ahead,” Sellers said. “It was a joy to serve for a season as president, and I feel absolutely confident that God has His hand on David Robbins to lead us into the future, focused on our unchanging mission of evangelism and discipleship.”\n\nAccording to the statement, Cru’s board of directors carefully and prayerfully considered a diverse list of candidates for the role, concluding with a unanimous decision to select Robbins as president.\n\n“I am deeply humbled to get to serve the Lord in this new role alongside faithful and faith-filled staff, volunteers and partners around the world,” Robbins said in the news release. “Together, we will continue to trust God to pursue our mission so that people in every tongue, tribe and nation can come to know and follow Jesus.”\n\nRobbins holds a bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Mississippi. He and his wife Meg and their four children live in Orlando.\n\nCru has been an NRB member since 1968."
