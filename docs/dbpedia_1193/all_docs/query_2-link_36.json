        "text": "Dave Robbins (b. Greensburg, August 24, 1923 - d. Sechelt, British Columbia, September 23, 2005) -- Trombonist, composer, arranger, conductor, and teacher. Robbins studied music at Sam Houston Teachers' College and the University of Southern California. As a trombonist, he had an extensive performance career in jazz and symphonic playing. From 1948 to 1955, he played with the Harry James Band, which recorded prolifically at that time on Columbia. In the early '70s, Robbins was again with Harry James and was a featured soloist. In 1965, he became a Canadian citizen and led his own groups (big band and sextet) in Vancouver. From 1965 to 1970, he led three albums on CBC Radio Canada. His move to Canada actually predated his citizenship by about ten years, as he was the principal trombonist with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra from 1955 to 1970."
