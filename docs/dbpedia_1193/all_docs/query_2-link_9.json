Though well known as a sideman for his exciting big band work and sensitive trio playing, he also leads his own bands.\n\nRobbins grew up in Victoria and was educated at McGill University in Montreal where he received his Masters in Jazz Studies. While in Montreal, he toured and recorded in bands with Vic Vogel, Joe Sullivan, Altsys and the Streetnix among others. In 1996, he could no longer resist the pull of the westcoast, and was thrilled to have moved back. He keeps busy playing with Mike Allen, Bill Coon, Hugh Fraser, Oliver Gannon, John Korsrud and Jennifer Scott to name a few.\n\nRobbins has played music all over the world, in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Cuba, Finland, France and Ireland. Musicians he has performed with include Gary Bartz, Maynard Ferguson, Slide Hampton, Buddy Montgomery, Bob Minzer, PJ Perry and Don Thompson.\n\nHe is also very involved as an educator. After teaching at McGill's Conservatory of Music while in Montreal, he is now on the music faculty at Capilano University where he instructs arranging, drums, piano and large ensembles. As well as institutional educating, he does clinics and private instructing."
