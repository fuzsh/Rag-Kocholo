Mr. Robbins is an experienced litigator and investigations lawyer with a broad skillset focused on ethics, compliance, counseling, claims, investigations and enforcement defense. Based in the firm's Washington, DC office, he will lead the Government Contracts Practice with Partner Marc Van Allen.\n\n\"I'm delighted to see Jenner & Block building up its already premier Government Contracts Practice by adding top talent like David,\" said Greg Gallopoulos, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of General Dynamics.\n\nMr. Robbins advises clients on a range of litigation matters, including civil False Claims Act defense, claims, requests for equitable adjustment, whistleblower reprisal defense and prime/sub disputes. He also handles matters involving high-stakes, complex internal investigations, strategic transactions, mandatory disclosures, trade secrets litigation, ethics/compliance, conflicts of interest, fraud and public corruption defense, bid protests, General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule contracting, Procurement Integrity Act, Anti-Kickback Act, and suspension and debarment.\n\n\"David is an accomplished lawyer with deep government and private practice experience who augments our nationally recognized Government Contracts Practice,\" said Jenner & Block Co-Managing Partner Randy Mehrberg. \"He is a highly sought-after practitioner and his knowledge will be a great benefit to clients on their most complex matters, and to the Government Contracts Practice he leads with Marc.\"\n\nKatya Jestin, co-managing partner with Mr. Mehrberg, added: \"David is an authority in the ever-changing government contracts and regulatory landscape.

We are very pleased to welcome him back to the firm.\"\n\nMr. Robbins is a former Air Force General Counsel's office senior lawyer where he ran the global Air Force's Procurement Fraud Remedies Office and served as acting Suspending and Debarring Official and Deputy General Counsel (Contractor Responsibility).

These two committees coordinated the operations of the government's procurement and grant fraud organization, setting practices that remain in use today.\n\nMr. Robbins joins Jenner & Block's long tradition of lawyers moving between public service and private practice.*\n\n\"David is a highly respected member of the government contracts bar,\" said Mr. Van Allen. \"Through his background and experience, he is extremely well versed in government contract and grant law, as well as policy, and brings that experience to work for his clients. I am excited to be leading the practice with him.\"\n\n\"I am thrilled to be returning to Jenner & Block, where I began my legal career as an associate, and lead the Government Contracts Practice with Marc,\" said Mr. Robbins. \"It's a great opportunity to provide strategic counsel to clients on a range of their most pressing issues.\"\n\nMr. Robbins frequently speaks and publishes on government contracts topics, including in Thomson Reuters Government Contracts Year in Review.
