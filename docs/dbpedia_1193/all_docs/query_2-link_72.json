        "text": "Obituary of David H. Robbins\n\nDAVID HARRY ROBBINS Son of the late Donald and Alma Robbins of 58 Seaview Avenue Northport New York David is survived by his three older sisters, Caryle Bethel, Lillian &amp; William Bruu, Lorrie &amp; Tomas Sullivan, 5 nieces and 1 nephew, 15 grand nieces and nephews. ... The one and only bowling ball artist of Northport. His creative mind had no boundries &amp; his art was once displayed at our own Northport Museum, David's creative mind always took him outside of the box bewildering all who knew him. His choice of friends often misfits of music, the quirky world of breaking the rules just a little bit for the pleasure of it, that alone helped him thru some of his toughest battles and I thank them all so much for their loyalty and great passion they shared with my uncle, their friend. None of us today could have imagined the swift right hand of God and the power that he revealed to us and to my uncle, he passionatly took him, embracing him, allowed us all to say good bye in not so many words but sometimes through a hug, a get well card or a phone call. Those of you out there who have purchased David Robbins Bowling Ball Art, cherish it, for it is one of a kind, not another like it!!!! We have lost our one of a kind whom we cherished and can never replace our beloved brother, uncle and best friend. God be with you David Harry Robbins B: 1-24-57 D: 5-24-13"
