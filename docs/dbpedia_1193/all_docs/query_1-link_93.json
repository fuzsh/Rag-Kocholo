        "text": "Floyd David Robbins III, \"Dave\", was born on October 31, 1950, in Seattle, Washington. He was raised in the Burien area, with his sister, and 4 brothers, and lived a time in the small town of Tahuya, a place that produced many fond childhood memories. He attended Highline High School in Burien, and then Highline Community College in Des Moines, WA. While there, he ran on the track team and held the state record for the hurdles. He transferred to Central Washington State College, graduating with a BA in Geography.\n\nFor a time, Dave lived at “the Pad” – a house next to the church that he attended. He had roommates with whom he became life-long friends. It was during that time that he enjoyed a time of spiritual growth, and met his future wife. Dave and his wife Lynn Kuch were married on August 28, 1982. They were married for 26 years, and had two children, Danielle and David. Dave was delighted to be a Dad, and was proud of his kids. Many activities, such as softball, little league, Tae-Kwon Do, camping and traveling were part of their young lives.\n\nDave joined with his college and home-town friends playing on softball teams for many years, and then later played baseball. Baseball was one of the great loves of his life, and he was a Mariner fan from day one. Dave loved all kinds of sports. He was a Nascar fan, a hydro racing fan, a Seahawk fan, and enjoyed watching games on Sundays, especially with the “Potluck Group”, a group of his former softball team members and families who still gather every month for potlucks. The potluck group combined the things he loved best – good friends, sports and food. He enjoyed collecting sports memorabilia, and had a remarkable collection.\n\nDave is predeceased by his Father, Floyd David Robbins Jr., his mother, Dorothy Robbins, and his brother Thomas . He is survived by his two children, Danielle Elizabeth Robbins and Floyd David Robbins IV. He is also survived by siblings, Barbara Wilson, Rick Robbins, Jon Robbins and Erik Robbins. He grew up in a family of love. He was named Floyd David Robbins III, after his father and grandfather, and passed that name along to his son.\n\nThe last 10 years of his life, he spent battling Alzheimer’s, and after a final bout with respiratory distress, slipped into the presence of God on August 30, 2018, at the young age of 67.\n\nShare Memories on the guestbook for Dave at www.emmickfunerals.com"
