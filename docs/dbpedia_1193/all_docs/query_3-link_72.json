        "text": "Cash in on interest in ESP and mind power with this 15 minute lecture and 30 minute demonstration that you can give.\n\nThe author has presented this lecture many times with great success. It is both educational and entertaining and will be enjoyed by most any audience from teens to active seniors. At the conclusion of the lecture, a demonstration of ESP (or is it?) follows. Audience participation is encouraged. Any magician or mentalist can perform the lecture. It can be read straight from a printed copy, performed from memory, or better yet, given as a PowerPoint presentation.\n\nUse this...\n\nIf you encounter something called the Magic Omnibook, then these are simply repackaged issues of Magic is Fun. I have found one where issues #1 and #2, without their covers, were stapled into one new bluish-violet cover with the title \"Magic Omnibook\" and a price of 25c.\n\nThe tricks in this ebook represent a selection of the best tricks from each issue of Magic Is Fun, a magazine now out of print. Wherever possible, credit has been given to the originator of each trick or its presentation.\n\nOver 100 tricks that anyone can perform with simple inexpensive props. Including instructions in showmanship, sleight of hand and ventriloquism.\n\nTricks taught are:\n\nThe Vanishing Inch\n\nBalancing a Glass on a Card\n\nBoy or Girl\n\nBlowing a Card\n\nThe Liquefied Block\n\nFace-up Card\n\nHindu Thumb Penetration\n\nA Strong Dollar\n\nThe Screwy Match\n\nMultiplying Coins\n\nMagic Light\n\nCard and Ribbon..."
