        "text": "3/22/1999 – 11/30/2017\n\nDavid Robbins passed away peacefully at his Rockville home on November 30, 2017. He is survived by his loving mother Christiane; his devoted sister Gabrielle ; as well as the love of his life Alicia O’Neil, his best friend Alex Le, and a caring circle of family and friends. David is preceded in death by his loving father, Craig Robbins, who nicknamed David “buddy-boy.”\n\nDavid was born on March 22, 1999 in Bethesda, Maryland. From an early age, David loved to play outside, shined as a student at school, and was an avid Beatles fan. He and Gabrielle memorized songs on every album to sing together. David was recipient of one of the Boy Scout’s highest accolades, Scouting’s National Honor Society Order of the Arrow. Only scouts who best exemplify the Scout Oath are admitted into this brotherhood.\n\nDavid also showed a love of basketball and spent free time in the front yard shooting hoops for hours on end. David played basketball at Rockville High School where his coach observed that he was an example of the true meaning of “team” as both a player and as a captain.\n\nDavid graduated with an International Baccalaureate Diploma in June of 2017 from Rockville High School, never allowing the diagnosis of osteosarcoma to stop his rigorous schooling. Skyping into class from the hospital, and meeting with teachers after school or at his home, David politely insisted on maintaining excellence in his learning. The way David stretched his understanding in spite of his illness helped to remind his instructors that students like David make teaching worthwhile. His hard work paid off, as David received numerous college scholarships, and was admitted to St. Mary’s College of Maryland for the freshman class of 2017.\n\nAbove all, those who knew David best described him as unwaveringly loyal to those he loved. Whether David as “dog uncle” was taking Gabrielle’s sick puppy to the veterinarian, motivating his basketball team at the end of the fourth quarter, or as an Eagle Scout, crafting care bags for sick children, David never faltered and strove to exceed the expectations of his family, friends, teachers, and coaches. Faithful, and forever flying over us, David will always be an Eagle —someone to look up to."
