        "text": "Therapy & coaching for adults that want to level up their lives, relationships, and businesses.\n\nWorking with me üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nHi! My name is David. Whether you are working on your mindset, motivation, or mental health, I‚Äôm here to help you.\n\nI offer virtual therapy for Missouri residents and virtual coaching for clients across the nation.\n\nI‚Äôm currently accepting new clients (just a few spots left).\n\nIf we‚Äôve never met before, I offer a free 15-minute consultation to help us determine if we are a good fit.\n\nIf you have questions or want to book a session, you can email me david@davidprobbins.com or text me (816) 396-0181 and I‚Äôll reply within 1-2 business days.\n\nMore about me üëã\n\nI‚Äôm a musician by trade, former EMT and hobby engineer.\n\nI‚Äôm also an Addictions Specialist, and an Autism Spectrum Disorder Clinical Specialist.\n\nI bring all of my personal passions into my work to help you build a fulfilling life, find inner harmony, and connect with yourself and the world around you.\n\nWhen not working as a therapist or coach, I love spending time outdoors and with my wife and 3 children.\n\nI also host a podcast where I talk with guests about all things human behavior, mindset, motivation, and more.\n\nWant to try out therapy or coaching for yourself?\n\nTherapy, also known as psychotherapy or counseling, is a professional process that aims to improve mental health and well-being. It involves talking to a trained therapist in a safe and confidential environment to explore and address various emotional, behavioral, or psychological issues.\n\nTherapy typically involves a collaborative relationship between the therapist and the client. The therapist provides a supportive and non-judgmental space for the client to express their thoughts, feelings, and concerns. Through various therapeutic techniques and approaches, the therapist helps the client gain insight, develop coping skills, and make positive changes in their lives.\n\nThe duration of therapy varies depending on individual needs and goals. Some individuals may find resolution in a few sessions, while others may require longer-term therapy. Short-term therapy can range from a few weeks to a few months, while long-term therapy may continue for several months or even years. In my practice, each session is 45-60 minutes long.\n\nYes, therapy is confidential. Therapists are bound by legal and ethical guidelines to maintain client confidentiality. This means that the information shared during therapy sessions remains private and cannot be disclosed to anyone without the client‚Äôs consent, except in situations where there is a risk of harm to self or others.\n\nSimilar to therapy, coaching sessions may be significantly shorter, or longer, depending on what we‚Äôre working on. Coaching allows many more options for working on your issues, but doesn‚Äôt technically address mental health issues.\n\nI offer Life Coaching, Business Coaching, and Mindset Coaching.\n\nI accept most major insurances, including but not limited to Blue Cross Blue Shield, BCBS, United Health Care, United behavioral Health, Aetna, New Directions, GEHA, and Cigna. If you want to know if I‚Äôm in network with your insurance, check with your insurance company or ask me directly.\n\nOtherwise my fee per hour is $150. All fees, copays and coinsurance are due and payable at the time of services. I accept cash, check, and all card payments including most HSA.\n\nIf you have a deductible(the amount you pay out of pocket before the insurance pays me, your provider anything), you will have to pay the maximum allowed amount according to that insurance plan."
