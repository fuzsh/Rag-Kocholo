David lived his life with no regrets, and we will remember him as being full of life and sharing that enthusiasm with us.\n\nDavid was preceded in death by his parents, his wife, Kimberly Money and a sister, Penny Robbins.\n\nSurvivors include his three daughters, Samantha Robbins (Casey), Jeanette Howard (Blake) and Desiree Robbins (David Johnson); a sister, Virginia Eldridge (Doug); brother, John Robbins (Renee); two precious grandchildren, Addison Johnson and Elizabeth Howard; several other family members and friends."
