        "text": "David Lester Robbins passed away December 18, 2023, although in some ways, we lost our dad years earlier, through Lewy body dementia. We are grateful that he is no longer suffering, but we miss him dearly.\n\nFriends and family are invited to celebrate and remember our dad -our hero- and from the perspective of his grandchildren, their partner in crime:\n\nSaturday, December 30, 2023\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\n\n1002 Burkholder Boulevard, Henderson, NV\n\nViewing from 9:00AM to 10:30 AM, with the service beginning at 11 AM.\n\nWe want to share a little bit about him, so you will understand how a teenager, without much formal education, could master life, cherishing his sweetheart for sixty-two short years and raising a family with faith and love.\n\nDavid was born on May 5, 1942, to Lester Robbins and Ella Bona in Payson, UT. His parents divorced when he was just a toddler, and he and his big sister, Tamra, were raised by his mother and step-father, David McNeill, in West Valley City, Utah, joined by siblings Irene, Glenna, DonRay and Forrest.\n\nHis father and stepmother, Elaine, shared years ago that they never missed a night praying for David and Tamra, even though they did not spend as much time with them as they wanted.\n\nDavid developed attributes of hard work and honesty, but he rarely shared stories of his youth, preferring to keep some tender and painful memories in the past.\n\nHis life trajectory changed the summer of 1960, while he was living with his sister, Tamra, and her husband, Dale Jones, in Lynndyl, Utah. A teenage girl named Sarah LaJune Crowther was visiting her aunt for several weeks. It wasn't David's black leather jacket or affinity for motorcycles that caught her attention. She admits she might have noticed the tall, muscular, dark-haired young man walking down the street, tired and hot after spending the day lifting bales of hay, because he was walking \"bare chested.\"\n\nTheir paths crossed that summer as they enjoyed church activities, like walking up the canyon with friends who \"borrowed\" a watermelon from a farmer's field for a watermelon bust.\n\nA friend asked LaJune if she had her eyes on David Robbins. \"Who is that?\" she asked her friend.\n\n\"Oh, you know him as David McNeill, but he had to change to his real name when he registered for the draft.\"\n\nShe responded, \"Why would I want to date a guy who doesn't even know his own name?\"\n\nBut that all changed after a double date to a drive-in movie, when David spent more time glancing at the rearview mirror to look at the pretty green-eyed blonde in the back seat (even though she was sitting next to her date), than he spent watching the movie or his own date.\n\nWithin a few months of becoming sweethearts, they couldn't imagine their lives without one another. They were married, at the tender ages of 18 and 16, in Nephi, Utah on February 14, 1961.\n\nDavid's brother-in-law, Dale, offered him advice and counsel about the importance of prioritizing faith in God and family as the purpose in life.\n\nDavid committed to raising a family in a home that reflected those values.\n\nOut of all the life lessons learned from Dad, his example of changing his life through repentance to become the person God sees is the most cherished.\n\nIt didn't matter that they began life together with few possessions. What mattered is that David wanted to build a life-and a family-with LaJune. They welcomed their first son, Scott, just nine months and twenty-two days following their wedding. Their second son, Wayne, was born the next year.\n\nDavid continued his commitment to his family by taking LaJune, Wayne, and Scott, wearing little white suits, to the Manti temple on February 19, 1964, to seal their marriage and commit to living and loving LaJune now and through eternity.\n\nThey welcomed four more children-Brenda, Rob, Lonney, and Danny-while living in several towns in Utah as David worked to support his young family. If you are counting, they added six children to their family within the first six years of their wedding.\n\nHe settled down with his family in Milford, Utah, after a transfer and promotion with Union Pacific. They were living in Milford when their son Joe was born. Their hearts were broken at the loss of their second daughter, Rebecca, who passed away days before her birth. Their daughter Merridee brought joy back into their lives, and their son Randy completed their family as the perfect youngest child.\n\nDavid's career moved them to Utah to Apple Valley, California, and finally to Henderson, Nevada, in December 1986. At the time of his retirement, David managed Union Pacific equipment service and repair departments, covering an area that stretched from southern California, southern Nevada, Utah, and parts of Idaho.\n\nDad was a gifted mechanic who could fix anything. And we mean anything.\n\nHe supported his family with his hard work, but his passion was to cheer for them at games.\n\nHe elbowed his way through many basketball wins in backyard games.\n\nHe looked forward to yearly deer hunts.\n\nDad prioritized faith, love, and family-and Aggravation, which was a lesson in life as well as a game.\n\nHe spent available evenings, especially Sundays, playing games, insisting we follow his own \"Robbins rules,\" and winning the hearts of grandchildren who stayed up way past their bedtimes to play with Grandpa, because the game was never over until grandpa won.\n\nAggravation taught us that there will be setbacks in life, but once one person reached home and starts helping the others, winning comes when you play as a team.\n\nIt is fitting that he is one of the first to make it home.\n\nDavid showed his family how to live and love like the Savior.\n\nHe faithfully served others as a friend, a neighbor, and through callings and service as a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day-Saints.\n\nHe supported multiple sons who served missions, never complaining about the financial sacrifice.\n\nIt is because of dad's faith that we were encouraged to develop testimonies of Christ, and it is because of our testimonies in Christ that we know our family will continue, as we grow, learn, love, repent, and progress together, looking forward to the day we see him again.\n\nDavid is survived by his wife, LaJune, who served faithfully as his primary caregiver, and his sons, daughters, and in-laws who love him dearly-\n\nScott (Finis), Wayne(Dina), Brenda, Rob (Liz), Lonney (Julie), Danny (Melanie), Joe (Tracey), Merridee Turner (Randy), and Randy (Lindsey).\n\nDavid taught, teased, entertained, and inspired thirty-nine grandchildren and forty-eight great-grandchildren, with another due Christmas day and two more in 2024.\n\nDavid was joyfully welcomed in heaven by his big sister and protector, Tamra, who passed away just six days earlier than David. He was also welcomed by his parents; his in-laws, Loren and Della Crowther; his daughter, Rebecca, his brothers, DonRay McNeill, Forrest McNeill, and Carl Robbins; his siblings-in-law, John Nethercott, Jay Crowther, and Joy Crowther; and beloved grandsons Jeffrey and Quinton.\n\nHe is survived by his sisters, Irene (Ted) May and Glenna Molyneux, and Tamra's husband, Dale Jones.\n\nHe is also survived by LaJune's siblings-Renee Nethercott, Margie (John) Lomax, Gayle(Elaine) Crowther, Bevin (Sharon) Crowther, Carl (Alice) Crowther, Paul (Diane) Crowther, and Allan (Shellie) Crowther.\n\nFamily wouldn't be family without the many nieces, nephews, and other loved ones who loved dad.\n\nWe are grateful for your love and support.\n\nDad is not far from us.\n\nWe know he is aware of us and that he will continue to serve and influence us. And because Bethlehem cannot be separated from Gethsemane, we know we will receive comfort and hope from our Savior, Jesus Christ, whom we celebrate this beautiful Christmas season."
