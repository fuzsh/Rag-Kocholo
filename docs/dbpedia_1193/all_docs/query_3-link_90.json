        "text": "A presidential commissioning ceremony took place July 18, 2024 in Orlando and was livestreamed on Cru.org. Robbins concluded his role at FamilyLife before his commissioning, which began a search process for the ministry’s new CEO.\n\nCampus Crusade for Christ International/Cru, one of the world’s largest evangelism and discipleship ministries, announced today that David Robbins will serve as its new president starting in July.\n\nRobbins brings more than two decades of experience with Cru, most recently serving as CEO of FamilyLife, a ministry of Cru dedicated to helping families grow closer to God and each other, and impacting their corner of the world.\n\nBefore becoming FamilyLife’s CEO in 2017, Robbins served in various capacities and leadership roles with Cru. This includes launching a ministry to 20-somethings in New York City, leading a student ministry team in Italy and serving as a regional director for the U.S. Campus Ministries in the Southeast Region. Robbins has consistently demonstrated a passion for evangelism and discipleship, and a heart to reach the world.\n\nRobbins, 46, will be the fourth president of Campus Crusade for Christ International/Cru, succeeding Steve Sellers, who prayerfully announced his decision to step into a new role with Cru in January.\n\n“I’ve spent nearly five decades dedicated to this ministry, and I believe the best years of our ministry are still ahead,” Sellers said. “It was a joy to serve for a season as president, and I feel absolutely confident that God has His hand on David Robbins to lead us into the future, focused on our unchanging mission of evangelism and discipleship.”\n\nThe board of directors led an extensive selection process to identify the new president considering a broad and diverse list of candidates. After much prayer, discussion and consideration, the board of directors unanimously chose Robbins as president.\n\n“We extend our heartfelt thanks to the thousands of staff members, volunteers and donors worldwide who prayed for us as we sought the Lord’s guidance for the next president. Throughout the rigorous search process, it was a privilege to witness the quality and calling of Campus Crusade for Christ International/Cru’s faithful leaders across the globe,” said Barry Cannada, chairman of the board of directors. “On behalf of the board of directors, I am pleased to announce David Robbins as the next president of Campus Crusade for Christ International/Cru.”\n\nAs president, Robbins is committed to upholding and advancing the ministry’s calling to help fulfill the Great Commission by winning, building and sending in the power of the Holy Spirit and helping the body of Christ do evangelism and discipleship.\n\n“I am deeply humbled to get to serve the Lord in this new role alongside faithful and faith-filled staff, volunteers and partners around the world,” Robbins said. “Together, we will continue to trust God to pursue our mission so that people in every tongue, tribe and nation can come to know and follow Jesus.”\n\nRobbins received his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Mississippi. He and his wife, Meg, live in Orlando, Florida, with their four children.\n\nAbout Campus Crusade for Christ International/Cru\n\nCampus Crusade for Christ International (known as Cru in the U.S.) is an interdenominational Christian evangelism and discipleship ministry committed to giving people everywhere the opportunity to know and experience God's love and plan for their lives.
