        "text": "Christopher Nolan‘s Oppenheimer capped a big night at the Golden Globes on Sunday by taking the Best Motion Picture – Drama award, giving it five trophies on the night and solidifying it as a frontrunner for the Oscars.\n\nOppenheimer also scored wins tonight for Best Actor – Drama Cillian Murphy, Best Director Christopher Nolan, Supporting Actor for Robert Downey Jr and Best Original Score for Ludwig Göransson. It had come into the night with eight noms, one behind leader Barbie on the film side.\n\n“This was just an incredible experience making this film,” producer Emma Thomas said in the acceptance speech with her team behind her. “This is just the smallest portion of the many people that made the film what it is. … What’s so clear is that what we do is a collaboration — that’s amazing and it’s exciting.”\n\nThe Universal film was part of a winning summer at the box office, teaming with Warner Bros’ Barbie to storm cinemas and get them back on their feet after a slow post-pandemic restart. Nolan’s story of J Robert Oppenheimer’s pursuit to make the atom bomb, and change the course of human history, grossed $952 million — not bad for a three-hour historical drama.\n\nBarbie, which grossed $1.44 billion to lead all movies in 2023, won two Globes tonight on the Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy side, for Billie Eilish’s original song as well as the new Cinematic and Box Office Achievement trophy.\n\nOppenheimer‘s big night tonight came against a couple of other major contenders in the Drama category, especially Apple’s Martin Scorsese epic Killers of the Flower Moon and Netflix’s Maestro. Both were in the Best Picture race along with Neon’s Anatomy of a Fall and A24’s duo Past Lives and The Zone of Interest."
