        "text": "Jo Koy received backlash from netizens at the 81st Golden Globes for his 'big boobie' joke on Barbie and trolling Taylor Swift over her relationship with Travis Kelce. The event aimed to reclaim its status as the third most significant awards show of the year, but Koy's jokes fell flat and irked viewers. Koy's remark about Barbie being a plastic doll with big boobs earned him awkward reactions from the Barbie cast and Taylor Swift. Fans took to social media to slam the host for his distasteful remarks.\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards celebrated with surprises, including the success of Christopher Nolan's drama 'Oppenheimer', which won Best Drama, Best Director for Nolan, Best Score, and acting honors for Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. However, 'Barbie' missed out on the Best Comedy Film award, losing to 'Poor Things'. Greta Gerwig, the director of 'Barbie', expressed gratitude to the fans and dedicated the awards to them. The unexpected turn of events sparked a wave of fan reactions on social media. Taylor Swift, although losing her award, cheered for Margot Robbie's 'Barbie' and led a standing ovation.\n\n\"Succession,\" which broke the record for most Golden Globe TV award nominations for its fourth and final season, took home the best drama award, along with three wins for cast members.Also leading the Golden Globe television race, FX's \"The Bear\" won the best television comedy award, gaining three Golden Globes for its second season.\"The Bear\" follows a formally trained chef, played by White, who returns to his hometown in Chicago to take over his family's sandwich shop after the death of his brother.Other noteworthy winners include the hot-headed Netflix comedy-drama \"Beef,\" which won best television limited series, with leads Ali Wong and Steven Yeun bringing home best female and male actor. They were the first Globe wins for both actors and a nod to an Asian-led series.\n\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards unfolded with 'Oppenheimer' and 'Poor Things' emerging as the big winners of the night. Cillian Murphy took home the Globe for Best Actor in a Drama Film for 'Oppenheimer', while Emma Stone clinched the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Motion Picture, Musical, or Comedy for 'Poor Things'. 'Killers of the Flower Moon' secured its sole award of the night as Lily Gladstone triumphed in the category of Best Actress - Drama.\n\nKylie Jenner and Timothée Chalamet attended the 2024 Golden Globes as a power couple. They were seen holding hands and sharing a kiss at their table. Chalamet, known for his role as the ‘Wonka’ star, was nominated for his portrayal of Willy Wonka. The couple made their public debut in September and have since attended various events together. Jenner refers to Chalamet as her boyfriend, and they support each other's careers.\n\nMargot Robbie stunned at the 2024 Golden Globes, channeling the iconic Superstar Barbie of 1977 with her show-stopping outfit. The actress turned heads on the red carpet, bringing the beloved doll's signature look to life. Her mesmerizing pink dress and net ruffle stole received praise and went viral on the internet. Robbie, nominated for her role in the highly acclaimed film 'Barbie,' expressed the significance of its success, as it became the highest-grossing film of 2023 and Warner Bros.' all-time highest-grossing film.\n\nHollywood stars are preparing to dance the night away as box office smash \"Barbie\" leads nominees for Sunday's Golden Globes, the kickoff to the industry's glitzy awards season. The first big party in Tinseltown since contentious labour disputes last year, the Globes will honour the best of film and television according to roughly 300 entertainment journalists from around the world.That is a change from the past, when about 80 people chose the winners. \"Barbie,\" the female-empowering doll adventure, tops the field with nine nominations. The movie directed by Greta Gerwig and starring Margot Robbie is expected to claim the trophy for best film musical or comedy over \"The Holdovers,\" \"Poor Things\" and others, according to experts polled by the Gold Derby website. The historical drama \"Oppenheimer,\" with eight nominations, is the favourite for best movie drama. The story about the man behind the atomic bomb had competed with \"Barbie\" over the summer in a box office clash dubbed \"Barbenheimer.\"\n\nThe Golden Globes are preparing for a remarkable reboot as the Hollywood Foreign Press Association gives way to a more diverse group of international journalists. The nominations for the upcoming awards reveal a surprising frontrunner: Barbie, who secures nine nominations. However, the Globes' predictive power for the Oscars has waned in recent years, suggesting a highly competitive race ahead. The Globes have a history of recognizing talent overlooked by the Oscars, such as Barbra Streisand's victory for best director in 1984 for \"Yentl.\" This year's ceremony will be hosted by Jo Koy, and the television awards promise an exhilarating contest between established series and rising stars.\n\n“Barbie” is the top nominee this year, followed closely by “Oppenheimer.”The films reflect one unique aspect of the Globes — they split the top film winners into two categories. With Greta Gerwig's “Barbie” and Christopher Nolan's “Oppenheimer” leading the way, it gives the show a chance to capitalize on the Barbenheimer craze that boosted theaters.Films nominated for best motion picture drama include “Oppenheimer,” Martin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon,” Bradley Cooper’s “Maestro,” Celine Song’s “Past Lives,” Justine Triet’s “Anatomy of a Fall” and Jonathan Glazer’s “The Zone of Interest.”In the best motion picture musical or comedy category, “Barbie” was joined by Ben Affleck's “Air,” Cord Jefferson's “American Fiction,” Alexander Payne's “The Holdovers,” Todd Haynes' “May December” and Yorgos Lanthimos' “Poor Things.”"
