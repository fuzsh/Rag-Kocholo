        "text": "The 2024 Golden Globes aired on Sunday (Jan. 7) at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, Calif. Comedian Jo Koy hosted the ceremony, which was heavily dominated by nominations for Barbie and Succession. The special night also highlighted the industry’s slate of modern stars.\n\nSome of entertainment’s latest gems, such as Steven Yuen, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, and Ayo Edebiri took home accolades for their show-stopping performances. Edebiri even went viral on social media for her Sydney-esque acceptance speech.\n\n“There’s so many people who I probably forgot to thank—oh my God! Oh my God! All of my agents and managers’ assistants! The people who answer my emails!” she exclaimed. “Y’all are real ones!
