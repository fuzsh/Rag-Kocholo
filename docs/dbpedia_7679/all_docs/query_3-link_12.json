The album’s eight original songs that Downey wrote and his two musical numbers debuting as cover songs revealed his sultry singing voice and his musical talents.\n\nIn 2001, Downey made his primetime television debut when he joined the cast of the Fox-TV series “Ally McBeal,” as attorney Larry Paul. For this role, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male in a Comedy Series.
