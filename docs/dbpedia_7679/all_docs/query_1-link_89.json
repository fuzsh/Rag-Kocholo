If it were up to me, Coolidge and Aubrey Plaza would tie for the Globe based on the Twitter content their performances inspired alone.\n\nMatt Lavietes, NBC Out reporter: I’m most excited to see if gay icon Coolidge finally gets the chance to finish the iconic winning speech she attempted to give at the Emmys. I’m also very curious to see how Emma D’Arcy — who uses they/them pronouns — would react if they win the globe for best performance by an actress in a television series, given they do not identify as female.\n\nClaretta Bellamy, NBCBLK News Fellow: I’m rooting for the “Woman King” herself Viola Davis for best performance by an actress in a motion picture — drama, partly because I just read her inspiring book and also because the movie left me in happy tears. I’m also a Black Panther fangirl, so, Wakanda Forever!\n\nDoha Madani, senior breaking news reporter/resident Taylor Swift expert: I’m looking to see whether Swift takes home the globe for best song for “Carolina,” a sign that would place her as a potential front-runner for an Oscar in the coming months. I am also a world-class hater and am rooting for an “Avatar” loss.\n\nKalhan Rosenblatt, culture & trends reporter/Gaga stan: There are pop stars vying for the best original song award, and there is a pop rivalry in the NBC News newsroom. While Doha is rooting for Swift, I’ll be rooting for Lady Gaga to take home the award for her “Top Gun: Maverick” song “Hold My Hand.” Fun fact: Gaga previously won the award for “Shallow” in 2019 and Swift presented her with the award that year.\n\nAnahita Pardiwalla, social storytelling editor: I'm hoping Rihanna's Golden Globes nomination in the best original song category will inspire her to release new music we’ve all so (im)patiently been waiting for.\n\nUwa Ede-Osifo, news associate: As a Quinta Brunson stan from her early Buzzfeed days, I’m watching to see if “Abbott Elementary” will continue earning earn more well-deserved accolades.\n\nDaysia Tolentino, culture & trends reporter: I wouldn’t be surprised if fan-favorite “Abbott Elementary” won in the best television series, musical or comedy. But I think the hype for “The Bear” or even “Wednesday” could make it a tough decision.\n\nCrystal Minaya, editorial assistant: I am rooting for Austin Butler who is nominated best actor for his role in “Elvis.\" Let’s face it: We all fell in love with his glamorous and stunning take on the late singer in the Baz Luhrmann-directed film.\n\nBrahmjot Kaur, NBC Asian America reporter, NBCU Academy Embed: I’m crossing my fingers tight for “Everything Everywhere All at Once” taking home the award for best picture in a musical/comedy! Hot dog fingers, the multiverse and a star-studded cast — what more can you ask for?\n\nSaba Hamedy, culture & trends editor: Awards ceremonies often have their fair share of political moments — sometimes via people’s fashion choices, other times in winners’ speeches. I'm wondering whether we'll see any public support for the people of Iran tonight. The country has been gripped by protests since the Sept. 16 death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who died after she was detained by the government’s morality police.\n\nIt's Brendan Fraser's first nomination, but he swore off the Golden Globes\n\nBrendan Fraser is up for his very first Golden Globe tonight, a best actor nomination for his role in Darren Aronofsky’s “The Whale.\" But his dark history with the HFPA will keep him from attending tonight.\n\nFraser alleges that he was assaulted by HFPA’s former president Philip Berk in the summer of 2003. He detailed the incident in a 2018 GQ interview, saying it made him feel \"ill.\" Berk denied the allegation.\n\nIn a subsequent GQ interview last year, Fraser vowed that if he would not attend this year's ceremony even if he was nominated for a Golden Globe.\n\n“I have more history with the Hollywood Foreign Press Association than I have respect for the Hollywood Foreign Press Association,” he said.\n\n\"The Whale\" has been lauded as a tremendous return to film for Fraser, whose portrayal of a 600-pound gay man confined to a wheelchair earned him a six-minute standing ovation the Venice Film Festival in September. The actor was seen crying as he received accolades from his industry peers.\n\nThere are once again zero female director nominees\n\nThe HFPA voting body didn't nominate any women for the best director category, a move which generated backlash online.\n\nSome of the talented female directors who were snubbed: Sarah Polley (\"Women Talking\"); Gina Prince-Bythewood (\"The Woman King\"); Charlotte Wells (\"Aftersun\"); and Chinonye Chukwu (\"Till\").\n\nIt's not the first time the Globes have been called out for this. Back in 2018, when actor Natalie Portman was presenting the award for best director alongside Ron Howard, she highlighted a similar lack of representation in the list of nominees. Before announcing their names, she said, “And here are the all male nominees.\"\n\nThat same year, Barbra Streisand, who was also presenting, lamented on the the lack of women honored in the category.\n\n“We need more women directors and more women to be nominated for best director,\" she said. \"There are so many films out there that are so good directed by women.”\n\nSpeaking of 'Tar' ...\n\nWhile many in the LGBTQ world may be rooting for Cate Blanchett to win best actress for her performance as an abrasive conductor in “Tár,” not everyone is happy with it.\n\nMarin Alsop, who was name-checked in “Tár,” said the critically acclaimed film offended her “as a woman ... as a conductor ... as a lesbian.”\n\nNBC Out recently wrote about why Alsop, the world’s best-known female conductor, is displeased with the film.\n\nLGBTQ fans are rooting for \"Tár\"\n\nMany queer eyes are on “Tár” tonight, nominated for best motion picture, best screenplay and best actress.\n\nIn particular Cate Blanchett, a lesbian icon, has received critical acclaim for her explosive performance as the fictional conductor Lydia Tár. The unlikeable Tár spends much of the film humiliating students, flirting with younger women and hiding evidence of her wrongdoings.\n\nICYMI: A long list of nominees\n\nIn case you're in need of a refresher, here's a look at the nominees this year.\n\nOn the movies side, Martin McDonagh’s “The Banshees of Inisherin,\" leads the pack of nominees with eight nods. On the TV side, ABC’s breakout sitcom “Abbott Elementary” leads with five nods.\n\nAs NBC recently reported, LGBTQ people, both real and fictional, will be front and center at the awards show. And Latinos are represented in about half the award categories in this year’s Golden Globes. Nominees include Selena Gomez, Jenna Ortega, Aubrey Plaza, Diego Calva and others.\n\nA sneak peak at the seating chart\n\nThe Golden Globes official Twitter account on Monday shared a look at tonight's seating chart.\n\n\"Can you spot all the names?\" the account wrote in its tweet. Billy Porter, Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie were among the printed names in the video.\n\nWelp, it's raining in L.A.\n\nTurns out it's not always sunny in Los Angeles. Today's forecast is a high of 60 degrees and some rain.\n\nThat means you'll see tents covering the red carpet at the The Beverly Hilton, where the Golden Globes ceremony takes place.\n\n“This weather dealt us a hand,” the Globes executive producer and showrunner Dionne Harmon told Variety. “You’ll be enclosed in a big tent, so no one should be worried. They will get out of their car to a dry, warm place.”\n\nStay dry out there!\n\nHow to watch this year's show\n\nFor those of you interested in red carpet looks, E! kicks off its coverage at 6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT on Peacock and E! News channel on YouTube.\n\nThe show itself kicks off at 8 p.m. ET/ 5 p.m. PT on NBC and will stream simultaneously on Peacock.\n\nOf course, you can also follow along on our live blog as we provide updates on the winners and other big moments.\n\nOh my God they're (celebrities) back again\n\nIt seems the Golden Globes will be a star-studded affair once again.\n\nAhead of Tuesday's ceremony, the HFPA announced a slew of celebs who will attend this year's awards. The list of presenters is almost too long to share in a blog post.\n\nTLDR: You can expect to see some of your favorites on stage presenting and on the red carpet showing off their fabulous attire.\n\nHost Jerrod Carmichael is ready for the big night\n\nJerrod Carmichael, who won an Emmy Award last year for his HBO stand-up special “Rothaniel,\" is taking on the role as this year's host.\n\nLast year, he generated praise for his special, in which he came out. He also created the sitcom “The Carmichael Show,” which ran for three seasons on NBC.\n\nHe'll be the first to host since Tina Fey and Amy Poehler took the stage in 2021. Last year’s Globes were not shown live.\n\nHere’s one of the promo clips.\n\nThe Golden Globes controversy, explained\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization that puts on the Golden Globes, has been intensely criticized in recent years for the lack of racial diversity among its voting members and various ethical concerns.\n\nThe organization had no Black voting members, the Los Angeles Times reported last February. The allegations of ethical lapses within the HFPA were detailed by the L.A. Times in its exposé, which got widespread attention in the entertainment industry.\n\nSo ... last year, NBC, which has been the longtime TV home of the ceremony, decided not to televise it. The show went on, quietly and without much fanfare. (There wasn't even a red carpet!) Variety described it as \"the strangest Golden Globes Ceremony ever,\" where \"not one famous face, top executive or notable publicity rep could be spotted.\" There was just a small audience in-person, and winners were announced on social media.\n\nIn September, HFPA announced it has added 103 new voters to the group that oversees the Globes. Now, according to Variety, \"the voting body overall is made up of 200 members that are 52% female and 51.5% “racially and ethnically diverse” with 19.5% Latinx, 12% Asian, 10% Black and 10% Middle Eastern members. The statement says that the voting body also includes individuals who self-identify as LGBTQIA+.\"\n\nThat same month, NBC confirmed the 2023 show will air once again. But the question remains: Will Hollywood embrace it again? It's unclear, but the list of stars set to attend tonight's ceremony is seemingly long. Perhaps longer than initially expected, given that many actors didn't really acknowledge their nominations."
