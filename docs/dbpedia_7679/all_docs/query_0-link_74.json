On the television side, “Succession” saw nine nominations while “The Bear” and “Only Murders in the Building” had five each.\n\n“Oppenheimer” and “Succession” took big wins as predicted, with the father of the atomic bomb taking home five wins and the latter taking four. “Barbie” came away with two awards, while “The Bear” and “Beef” each took three.\n\nBelow is a complete list of the 2024 Golden Globe Award winners.\n\nBest Film – Drama\n\n“Oppenheimer”\n\nBest Actress – Drama\n\nLily Gladstone, “Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\nBest Film – Musical or Comedy\n\n“Poor Things”\n\nBest Actor – Musical or Comedy\n\nPaul Giamatti, “The Holdovers”\n\nBest TV series – Drama\n\n“Succession”\n\nBest actress in a TV series – Drama\n\nSarah Snook, “Succession”\n\nBest TV series – Musical or Comedy\n\n“The Bear”\n\nBest Limited Series, Anthology Series or TV Movie\n\n“Beef”\n\nCinematic and Box Office Achievement\n\n“Barbie”\n\nBest Original Song\n\n“What Was I Made For?” by Billie Eilish and Finneas (“Barbie”)\n\nBest Original Score\n\nLudwig Göransson, “Oppenheimer”\n\nBest actor – Drama\n\nCillian Murphy, “Oppenheimer”\n\nBest actress – Musical or Comedy\n\nEmma Stone, “Poor Things”\n\nBest Director\n\nChristopher Nolan, “Oppenheimer”\n\nBest Animated Film\n\n“The Boy and the Heron”\n\nBest Actor in a TV Series – Drama\n\nKieran Culkin, “Succession”\n\nBest Actress in a TV Series – Musical or Comedy\n\nAyo Edebiri, “The Bear”\n\nBest Non-English Language Film\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nBest Performance in Stand-up Comedy on TV\n\nRicky Gervais, “Ricky Gervais Armageddon”\n\nBest Actor in a TV Series – Musical or Comedy\n\nJeremy Allen White, “The Bear”\n\nBest Screenplay\n\nJustine Triet and Arthur Harari, “Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a TV Series\n\nMatthew Macfadyen, “Succession”\n\nBest Supporting Actress in a TV Series\n\nElizabeth Debicki, “The Crown”\n\nBest Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series or TV Movie\n\nSteven Yeun, “Beef”\n\nBest Actress in a Limited Series, Anthology Series or TV movie\n\nAli Wong, “Beef”\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nRobert Downey Jr, “Oppenheimer”\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph, “The Holdovers”"
