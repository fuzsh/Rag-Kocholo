The second season of Lasso is darker but the characters are evolving. That season finale you could see coming but that ending...wow. Hacks on the other hand is lighter but more biting. And the writing. Take the Falling episode. Listen to what the two characters are saying while on their cocaine high. Then that totalling out of left field ending. The contrast in writing between lousy network tv and these two shows, and shows like Succession, is extraordinary. You definitely get what you pay for with the really good shows.\n\nmacdisciple\n\nmacrumors 6502\n\nFeb 27, 2016\n\n276\n\n412\n\nUSA\n\nJan 10, 2022\n\n#23\n\nAm I not allowed to comment on a public forum?

Production values for both were excellent even if the stories don't grab you. I dislike both Anniston and the small lady troll - forgot her name in TMS, but the acting was very good and disliked neither in their roles. For All Mankind is very very underrated, IMO. Watched Swan Song last week and loved it. Looking forward to MacBeth.\n\nmacdisciple\n\nmacrumors 6502\n\nFeb 27, 2016\n\n276\n\n412\n\nUSA\n\nJan 10, 2022\n\n#24\n\nthat episode was terrible...that isn't the reason people watch Ted Lasso.
