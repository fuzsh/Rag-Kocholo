        "text": "The 2024 Golden Globes were handed out Sunday night, with Oppenheimer, Barbie, Poor Things and Anatomy of a Fall among the films winning multiple awards.\n\nOppenheimer was named best motion picture, drama, with Christopher Nolan taking home the directing award for his work on the movie. Poor Things won the Globe for best motion picture, musical or comedy. Anatomy of a Fall won the film for best non-English-language motion picture, while The Boy and the Heron was named best animated film.\n\nOn the TV side, Succession was named best drama series, while The Bear was named best TV series, musical or comedy.\n\nLily Gladstone, Paul Giamatti, Emma Stone, Robert Downey Jr., Jeremy Allen White, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Ayo Edebiri, Kieran Cullkin, Ali Wong, Steven Yeun and Matthew Macfadyen were among the winners in the acting categories. Billie Eilish O’Connell and Finneas O’Connell won the award for best song. (See the snubs and surprises.)\n\nThis year, Globes were handed out in new categories recognizing stand-up comedy and cinematic and box office achievement. Barbie won the award for best cinematic and box office achievement, whose category included eight nominees chosen from films that achieved “a box office receipt total/gross of $150 million, of which $100 million must come from the U.S. domestic box office, and/or obtain commensurate digital streaming viewership recognized by trusted industry sources,” the Globes said in announcing the category.\n\nThe award for best performance in stand-up comedy on television featured six nominated comedians who gave “traditional stand-up comedy performances of at least 30 minutes, other than roles in television series, limited series, anthology series or motion pictures made for television” on “a recognized media platform (individual social media accounts do not qualify).” Past Globes host Gervais took that award for Ricky Gervais: Armageddon (though he was a no-show).\n\nJo Koy hosted the ceremony, which aired live on CBS from the Beverly Hilton and streamed on Paramount+. Heading into the ceremony, Barbie and Succession led the nominations for the 2024 Golden Globes, with nine apiece.\n\nThis year’s Golden Globes mark the first since the Golden Globes’ longtime backer, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, was replaced following the acquisition of all the HFPA’s assets, rights and properties by Dick Clark Productions and Eldridge. Dick Clark Productions now owns and produces the Golden Globe Awards. DCP is owned by Penske Media Eldridge, a joint venture between Penske Media Corporation and Eldridge that also owns The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWith the Globes no longer being overseen by the HFPA, a new, racially and ethnically diverse group of voters — made up of 300 journalists from around the world, representing 76 countries — selected this year’s nominees and winners.\n\nIn November, the Globes inked a new broadcast deal with CBS after the awards group ended its longtime relationship with NBC, which aired the 2023 Golden Globes, earlier this year.\n\nA full list of winners follows.\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\nAnatomy of a Fall (Neon)\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon (Apple Original Films)\n\nMaestro (Netflix)\n\nOppenheimer (Universal Pictures) (WINNER)\n\nPast Lives (A24)\n\nThe Zone of Interest (A24)\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nAir (Amazon MGM Studios)\n\nAmerican Fiction (Orion Pictures/Amazon MGM Studios)\n\nBarbie (Warner Bros.
