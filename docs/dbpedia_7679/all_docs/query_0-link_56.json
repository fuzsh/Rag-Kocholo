I am hopeful and inspired by the way most people are coming together and rallying around it.\"\n\nThe Globe for best actress in a made-for-TV miniseries or movie went to Drew Barrymore for HBO's \"Gray Gardens.\" It was her first Globe win after three nominations.\n\nChloe Sevigny, who plays the second wife in HBO's \"Big Love,\" took the best supporting actress Globe for a made-for-TV miniseries or movie.\n\n\"Up in the Air,\" which was up for Globes in six categories, won the best screenplay award.\n\nShowtime's \"Dexter\" grabbed Golden Globes for best actor -- Michael C.
