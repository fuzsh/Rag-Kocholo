        "text": "In their first year since dissolving the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the Golden Globe Awards are back and eager to assert their position as the first major televised trophy show of awards season, or at least the first televised trophy show hosted by Jo Koy, reportedly one of the only comedians willing to take the gig.\n\nYeah, the Globes are still in a rebuilding phase, as illustrated by the fact that they will be broadcast on CBS for the first time this year. (NBC, their former home, has opted to show Sunday Night Football instead because more viewers actually watch that.) But awards season obsessives still look to the annual boozy affair for portents of what may (or may not) be ahead at the Oscars. Barbie, Oppenheimer, Killers of the Flower Moon, and Poor Things — all potential contenders for big prizes at the Academy Awards — lead the nominations on the film side. And with the strike pushing this year’s Emmy ceremony to January 15, roughly a week after the Globes, the television categories will also feel like foreshadowing, even though voting for the Emmys closed months ago.\n\nWhich movies, shows, performers, and filmmakers will win during Sunday’s ceremony? It’s anybody’s best guess, and by anybody’s we mean ours.\n\nMovies\n\nBest Motion Picture — Drama\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer\n\nPast Lives\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nConventional wisdom holds that Oppenheimer and Killers of the Flower Moon are this year’s Oscar heavyweights, and the Globes nominated both everywhere they could. Critics’ groups have been tilting toward Killers, but I suspect that could rebound to Oppenheimer’s benefit with the Globes, which now get the chance to do their two favorite things: put their own stamp on the race while handing their biggest trophy to the presumptive Best Picture frontrunner.\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture — Drama\n\nBradley Cooper – Maestro\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio – Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nColman Domingo – Rustin\n\nBarry Keoghan – Saltburn\n\nCillian Murphy – Oppenheimer\n\nAndrew Scott – All of Us Strangers\n\nFive years ago, Bradley Cooper lost this award to Bohemian Rhapsody’s Rami Malek, who had transformed himself into an iconic musical figure of the 20th century. Now Cooper has his own music biopic, his own transformation, and soon, I suspect, his own Globe. If you can’t beat ’em …\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture — Drama\n\nAnnette Bening, Nyad\n\nLily Gladstone, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nSandra Hüller, Anatomy of a Fall\n\nGreta Lee, Past Lives\n\nCarey Mulligan, Maestro\n\nCailee Spaeny, Priscilla\n\nAfter a string of critics’-group wins, Lily Gladstone has all the momentum, and with Emma Stone safely tucked away in the other acting category, I don’t think the Globes will pass up the opportunity to offer the Blackfeet actress her podium moment.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy\n\nAir\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nMay December\n\nPoor Things\n\nJust like the Drama race, this field seems likely to boil down to two major Oscar contenders: Barbie and Poor Things. Both received Picture, Director, and Screenplay love from the Globes, so it could go either way. However, since voters’ taste in this category tends to skew more highbrow than wacky — last year, they rewarded The Banshees of Inisherin over Everything Everywhere All at Once — I predict Poor Things will go home with the trophy.\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy\n\nNicolas Cage, Dream Scenario\n\nTimothée Chalamet, Wonka\n\nMatt Damon, Air\n\nPaul Giamatti, The Holdovers\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, Beau Is Afraid\n\nJeffrey Wright, American Fiction\n\nA real choose-your-own-adventure of a category. Paul Giamatti and Jeffrey Wright are the only names that would plausibly crack the Oscar lineup, but as the actors are both repping films the Globes liked but didn’t love, it’s hard to tell who’s got the edge. Of the pair, Giamatti is my pick: He’s a former HFPA fave who previously won this trophy for the little-seen Barney’s Version. But watch out for a surprise here.\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy\n\nFantasia Barrino, The Color Purple\n\nJennifer Lawrence, No Hard Feelings\n\nNatalie Portman, May December\n\nAlma Pöysti, Fallen Leaves\n\nMargot Robbie, Barbie\n\nEmma Stone, Poor Things\n\nI suspect the Globes will decide to cement Emma Stone as the other Best Actress front-runner here. However, I wouldn’t count out a Barbie party for Margot Robbie or a left-field win for J. Law, who was once such an HFPA darling that she was able to take this prize for the decidedly non-comedic Joy.\n\nBest Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture\n\nWillem Dafoe, Poor Things\n\nRobert De Niro, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nRobert Downey Jr., Oppenheimer\n\nRyan Gosling, Barbie\n\nCharles Melton, May December\n\nMark Ruffalo, Poor Things\n\nIf this were the Golden Globes of yore, they’d go with hot new face Charles Melton and send Film Twitter into a tailspin of thirst. A larger voting body means fewer unconventional picks, which should lead instead to the first stage of Robert Downey Jr.’s Oscar coronation.\n\nBest Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture\n\nEmily Blunt, Oppenheimer\n\nDanielle Brooks, The Color Purple\n\nJodie Foster, Nyad\n\nJulianne Moore, May December\n\nRosamund Pike, Saltburn\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph, The Holdovers\n\nAgain, the old HFPA might have gotten freaky with it and named Rosamund Pike. (Who, lest we forget, was the Best Actress in a Comedy winner at 2021’s Zoom ceremony.) But Da’Vine Joy Randolph has barely missed during the tastemaker phase of the season, and since the Globes snubbed The Color Purple in a few key categories, I don’t see Danielle Brooks pulling off the upset.\n\nBest Director — Motion Picture\n\nBradley Cooper, Maestro\n\nYorgos Lanthimos, Poor Things\n\nGreta Gerwig, Barbie\n\nChristopher Nolan, Oppenheimer\n\nMartin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nCeline Song, Past Lives\n\nUnless Alfonso Cuarón’s in the race, the Globes don’t tend to split Picture and Director. So we’re down to Christopher Nolan or Yorgos Lanthimos here, and of the two technically impressive European auteurs, it feels more like Nolan’s year.\n\nBest Screenplay — Motion Picture\n\nGreta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, Barbie\n\nTony McNamara, Poor Things\n\nChristopher Nolan, Oppenheimer\n\nEric Roth and Martin Scorsese, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nCeline Song, Past Lives\n\nJustine Triet and Arthur Harari, Anatomy of a Fall\n\nFive films received the Holy Trinity of Picture, Director, and Screenplay noms at the Globes. Four of them were our top tier of Best Picture players: Barbie, Killers of the Flower Moon, Oppenheimer, and Poor Things. The fifth was Past Lives. Such exalted company makes me think the Globes will find a place to reward Celine Song’s film, and a Screenplay win for the quiet indie romance feels like the move.\n\nBest Original Song — Motion Picture\n\n“Addicted to Romance,” She Came to Me\n\n“Dance the Night,” Barbie\n\n“I’m Just Ken,” Barbie\n\n“Peaches,” The Super Mario Bros. Movie\n\n“Road to Freedom,” Rustin\n\n“What Was I Made For,” Barbie\n\nSunday night should provide an answer to this race’s lingering question: Do the multiple Barbie songs split the vote and allow something else to sneak through? All three nominated numbers are so irresistible that I’m inclined to say no, and since the Globes often reward something uplifting here, I think “What Was I Made For” is the pick. (Though last year’s “Naatu Naatu” win suggests there may be a path to victory for “I’m Just Ken” as well.)\n\nBest Score for a Motion Picture\n\nJerskin Fendrix, Poor Things\n\nLudwig Göransson, Oppenheimer\n\nJoe Hisaishi, The Boy and the Heron\n\nMica Levi, The Zone of Interest\n\nDaniel Pemberton, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nRobbie Robertson, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nThe Globes are not afraid to march to their own drum in this category, and there are no bad options this year. But Ludwig Göransson’s Oppenheimer score feels like the most totemic of the bunch. BUM-BAMMM.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Animated\n\nThe Boy and the Heron\n\nElemental\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n\nSuzume\n\nWish\n\nAcross the Spider-Verse and The Boy and the Heron have been splitting the critics’ prizes, and if there were only one of them, we might be talking about a potential dark-horse Best Picture bid. The Globes loved both enough to nominate them in Score, too, so this is as close to a toss-up as you’ll find. Usually, though, this prize goes to a film from a Hollywood studio, which tips it to Across the Spider-Verse for me.\n\nBest Motion Picture — Non–English Language\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nFallen Leaves\n\nIo Capitano\n\nPast Lives\n\nSociety of the Snow\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nThe Globes recently eliminated the rule that prevented foreign-language films from being nominated in Drama or Comedy/Musical, and this year three films notched the double-up: Anatomy of a Fall, Past Lives, and Zone of Interest. Even though the Globes loved Past Lives, it would feel like an awkward winner in this category, so we’re probably looking at one of the two Cannes prize winners. Anatomy of a Fall, which also earned a Screenplay nom, seems to be outpacing the more polarizing Zone of Interest, and the fact that the courtroom drama is ineligible for the Oscar should only increase voters’ drive to reward it here.\n\nCinematic and Box Office Achievement in Motion Pictures\n\nBarbie\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3\n\nJohn Wick, Chapter 4\n\nMission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part 1\n\nOppenheimer\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n\nTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour\n\nI confess I’m not quite sure what this category is supposed to recognize, but it seems like an award designed to ensure that Barbie will get to take home a major trophy.\n\nTelevision\n\nBest Television Series — Drama\n\n1923\n\nThe Crown\n\nThe Diplomat\n\nThe Last of Us\n\nThe Morning Show\n\nSuccession\n\nThis is only the second year since the Globes voting body expanded and the first since the HFPA was dissolved entirely, so it’s challenging to gauge this new and (maybe?) improved body’s voting tendencies, especially on the TV side, where the Globes have tended to be a little less predictable. That said, every time Succession has been nominated in this category, it has won, and it’s hard to imagine its exceptional final season disproving that rule. If any series can pull off an upset, it would be The Last of Us or maaaaybe The Crown? But I don’t see that happening.\n\nBest Television Series — Musical or Comedy\n\nAbbott Elementary\n\nBarry\n\nThe Bear\n\nJury Duty\n\nOnly Murders in the Building\n\nTed Lasso\n\nThe Golden Globe for best TV comedy has not gone to the same show two years in a row since Glee’s back-to-back wins in 2010 and 2011. Given that, I’m inclined to believe that Abbott Elementary, last year’s victor, won’t triumph a second time. That leaves four shows that have been nominated in this category before without scoring a statuette and one newcomer: Jury Duty. There is a real chance that Jury Duty could win since the Globes often champion newer series. But I am inclined to think voters will opt for the second season of The Bear, a near-perfect piece of television.\n\nBest Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film\n\nAll the Light We Cannot See\n\nBeef\n\nDaisy Jones and the Six\n\nFargo\n\nFellow Travelers\n\nLessons in Chemistry\n\nGenerally speaking, when it comes to limited series, Globe voters gravitate toward the shiniest object, with winners tending to be the most-talked-about entries in the category. (See The White Lotus, The Queen’s Gambit, Big Little Lies, or The People vs. O.J. Simpson for previous examples.) There are exceptions — two years ago, for instance, Barry Jenkins’s The Underground Railroad deservedly took the top prize even as the series was not discussed enough in the broader culture. But I’m betting the shiny-object theory will hold this year and that the award will go to Netflix’s Beef.\n\nBest Actor in a Television Series – Drama\n\nBrian Cox, Succession\n\nKieran Culkin, Succession\n\nGary Oldman, Slow Horses\n\nPedro Pascal, The Last of Us\n\nJeremy Strong, Succession\n\nDominic West, The Crown\n\nBrian Cox has already won a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Logan “Fuck off” Roy on Succession. Jeremy Strong also has one for his work as Kendall “I am the eldest boy” Roy on the HBO drama. Which leaves Kieran Culkin poised to take home his first trophy for bringing Roman “Are you a cunt? Give me a buzz” Roy to life. Sure, it’s possible that Gary Oldman, Dominic West, or, more likely, Pedro Pascal could win this. But after being nominated three times in the Supporting Actor category, then upgrading to lead after delivering an emotionally massive performance in the show’s final season, it seems like good ol’ Romulus, a.k.a. Culkin, will finally win Daddy’s* approval.\n\n(*Daddy in this case means Golden Globe voters.)\n\nBest Actress in a Television Series – Drama\n\nHelen Mirren, 1923\n\nBella Ramsey, The Last of Us\n\nKerri Russell, The Diplomat\n\nSarah Snook, Succession\n\nImelda Staunton, The Crown\n\nEmma Stone, The Curse\n\nIf the voters wind up going full Succession, Sarah Snook could, and may, win here. If they want to recognize a young up-and-comer in a breakthrough lead role, it could go to Bella Ramsey. But it’s worth noting that the two other actresses who played Queen Elizabeth II on The Crown — Claire Foy and Olivia Colman — won Globes for their efforts, which is why I think this one’s going to go to Imelda Staunton for her portrait of the royal in her waning days. Remember, a number of Globe voters are journalists who hail from countries that are part of the British Commonwealth and may appreciate Staunton’s accurate performance even if they didn’t love the final episodes.\n\nBest Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy\n\nBill Hader, Barry\n\nSteve Martin, Only Murders in the Building\n\nJason Segel, Shrinking\n\nMartin Short, Only Murders in the Building\n\nJason Sudeikis, Ted Lasso\n\nJeremy Allen White, The Bear\n\nI’m going to rule out Jason Segel, Jason Sudeikis (he already has two Globes for Ted Lasso), and Steve Martin and Martin Short, who never seem to win these things, perhaps because they keep canceling each other out. (Wouldn’t it be fun to watch Short give an acceptance speech, though?) That leaves Bill Hader, who has been nominated four times for his performance as sorta-reforming hitman Barry Berkman on Barry but has never won, and Jeremy Allen White, who won last year for his work as Carmy on The Bear. I truly have no idea how this will shake out, but I’m going with Hader since he’s struck out so far and also because the second season of The Bear felt like more of a chance for the supporting actors to shine.\n\nBest Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy\n\nRachel Brosnahan, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\n\nQuinta Brunson, Abbott Elementary\n\nAyo Edebiri, The Bear\n\nElle Fanning, The Great\n\nSelena Gomez, Only Murders in the Building\n\nNatasha Lyonne, Poker Face\n\nAs I mentioned above, the second season of The Bear was (slightly) less about Carmy and more about his co-workers, including Sydney, played by Ayo Edebiri. Not only is Edebiri both natural and committed in that performance, she’s also had a breakout year thanks to Bottoms and Theater Camp on the film side. I think she’s got the best shot at winning, and when she does, I will be sprinkling sour-cream-and-onion potato chips on an omelet in her honor.\n\nBest Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film\n\nMatt Bomer, Fellow Travelers\n\nSam Claflin, Daisy Jones and the Six\n\nJon Hamm, Fargo\n\nWoody Harrelson, White House Plumbers\n\nDavid Oyelowo, Lawmen: Bass Reeves\n\nSteven Yeun, Beef\n\nThe most obvious potential winner here is Steven Yeun, who digs deep and goes darker than usual in Beef. I am 98 percent sure he will win, based on gut feeling and also what everyone else on the internet seems to be predicting. (What, you think there’s science involved in this?) However, I feel compelled to point out that last year, Kevin Costner won a Golden Globe for Yellowstone, which suggests that some voters have warm feelings toward Taylor Sheridan projects (and also, possibly, projects spearheaded by Paramount, which owns CBS, the new home of the Golden Globes). If there’s a surprise upset, this one could go to David Oyelowo.\n\nBest Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Television Film\n\nRiley Keough, Daisy Jones and the Six\n\nBrie Larson, Lessons in Chemistry\n\nElizabeth Olsen, Love and Death\n\nJuno Temple, Fargo\n\nRachel Weisz, Dead Ringers\n\nAli Wong, Beef\n\nRachel Weisz was absolutely dazzling in Dead Ringers. Ali Wong, like Steven Yeun, demonstrated depths that we have not fully seen from her before. Either seems like a very probable winner. But at least once in the TV categories, the Globes usually does something unexpected. Last year, that meant giving a Globe to Paul Walter Hauser for his performance in Black Bird. In 2020 it was Josh O’Connor’s Globe for The Crown, and the year before that, it was Russell Crowe’s for The Loudest Voice, a Showtime drama that I am still convinced no one actually watched in full. Which is why my eyes keep gravitating toward Riley Keough in Daisy Jones and the Six. Her performance is strong and charismatic, though not as elastic as Wong’s or Weisz’s. But one has to consider context here as well. If Keough wins, she’ll deliver an acceptance speech about playing a musician almost exactly a year after losing her mother, Lisa Marie Presley, also a musician and the daughter of Elvis Presley. In theory, voters should only be thinking about the caliber of these performances when they vote. But it’s naïve to believe that at least some are not also considering what will play best on the Globes broadcast. Elvis’s granddaughter winning an award a year after Austin Butler won one for playing her grandfather? That would be a great awards-show moment.\n\nBest Supporting Actor in a Television Series — Musical-Comedy or Drama\n\nBilly Crudup, The Morning Show\n\nMatthew MacFadyen, Succession\n\nJames Marsden, Jury Duty\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach, The Bear\n\nAlan Ruck, Succession\n\nAlexander Skarsgård, Succession\n\nIn case you’re wondering, the separate supporting categories in the limited-series genre were eliminated this year and rolled into the overall “supporting performance on television” races, a move that resulted in … no supporting actors from any limited series being nominated. (Apologies to the ensembles of Fargo, Beef, and Daisy Jones, I guess!) The Supporting Actor group is loaded with first-time nominees, specifically Matthew MacFadyen, James Marsden, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and Alan Ruck. There is definitely a world where I can see Marsden winning, especially since he gives the most purely comedic (and meta) performance in the bunch. But how can you not give it to MacFadyen, the man who won Succession? You can’t, which is why the voters will (I think) reward Tommy Wambsgans.\n\nBest Supporting Actress in a Television Series — Musical-Comedy or Drama\n\nJ. Smith Cameron, Succession\n\nElizabeth Debicki, The Crown\n\nAbby Elliott, The Bear\n\nChristina Ricci, Yellowjackets\n\nMeryl Streep, Only Murders in the Building\n\nHannah Waddingham, Ted Lasso\n\nMeryl Streep has been nominated for 34 Golden Globes and won nine times, mostly on the film side. There are many ways to interpret that data, and one of them is this: Streep has lost 25 times. I mean, technically she has! I kinda don’t see her adding to her victory pile with Only Murders, as good as she was in the role. This category most likely comes down to three actresses who have never won and were appearing in the final seasons of their respective series: J. Smith Cameron, Elizabeth Debicki, and Hannah Waddingham. The outcome is going to depend significantly on how much love the voters opt to shower on Succession or The Crown and whether or not they want to toss at least one award to Ted Lasso. I am betting they lean toward Waddingham, because her performance was one of the best parts of that series and I also just touched a “Believe” sign or some shit.\n\nBest Performance in Stand-up Comedy on Television\n\nRicky Gervais: Armageddon\n\nTrevor Noah: Where Was I\n\nChris Rock: Selective Outrage\n\nAmy Schumer: Emergency Contact\n\nSarah Silverman: Someone You Love\n\nWanda Sykes: I’m an Entertainer"
