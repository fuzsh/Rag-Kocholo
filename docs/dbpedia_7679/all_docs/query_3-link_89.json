        "text": "Oppenheimer was the big winner at the Golden Globe Awards, taking home five awards including the top prize.\n\nCillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr were both recognised for their acting performances, while Christopher Nolan won best director.\n\nSuccession scored the most wins in the TV categories following its acclaimed fourth and final season.\n\nMeanwhile, Barbie won the inaugural box office achievement award, after grossing $1.4bn (£1.13bn) worldwide.\n\nThere were two wins each for Anatomy of a Fall, The Holdovers and Poor Things, and one for Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nThe latter film's star Lily Gladstone was named best drama actress, making her the first indigenous person to win the award, something she described as \"historic\".\n\nOppenheimer star Murphy paid tribute to Nolan's \"rigour, focus and dedication\" in making the film, which grossed $954m (£750m) at the box office and won best drama film at the ceremony.\n\nThe biopic also won awards for best score and best supporting actor for Downey Jr, who portrayed US government official Lewis Strauss.\n\nDowney Jr acknowledged the film's unlikely box office success in his acceptance speech, joking: \"A sweeping story about the ethical dilemma of nuclear weapons grosses $1bn?\"\n\nThe actor continued: \"Dozens of folks have come up to me since the summer time saying I was unrecognisably subtle as Lewis Strauss. To my fellow nominees, let's not pretend this is a compliment.\"\n\nHe also referred to the changes made to the Golden Globes membership following a scandal over corruption and a lack of diversity. \"Thanks for changing your game,\" he told the voting body.\n\nMurphy, who also starred in Peaky Blinders, played J Robert Oppenheimer in the film - the theoretical physicist described as the father of the atomic bomb.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Murphy said: \"I knew the first time I walked on Christopher Nolan's set that it was different.\n\n\"I could tell by the level of rigour, focus, dedication, and the complete lack of seating options for actors,\" he joked, \"that I was in the hands of a visionary director.\"\n\nMurphy also joked about the number of Irish actors being recognised in awards season this year - his fellow nominees in the category included Saltburn's Barry Keoghan and All of us Strangers star Andrew Scott.\n\n\"To all my fellow nominees, whether you're Irish or not, you're all legends, I salute you,\" Murphy said.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon star Lily Gladstone began her acceptance speech by speaking Algonquian language Blackfoot. The actress comes from a Blackfeet Indian Reservation in northern Montana.\n\n\"I just spoke a bit of Blackfeet language, the beautiful community nation that raised me, encouraged me to keep doing this,\" she told the audience.\n\n\"I'm here with my mum, who, even though she's not Blackfeet, worked tirelessly to get Blackfeet into our classroom.\n\n\"This award is a historic one. I'm so grateful I can speak even a little bit of my language, because in this business, Native actors used to speak their lines in English, and then their sound mixers would run them backwards to accomplish Native languages on camera.\"\n\nIn Killers of the Flower Moon, Gladstone plays Mollie Burkhart, an Osage woman whose family members are brutally murdered as part of a plot by white settlers to move in on their land and take their fortune, fuelled by greed over oil.\n\nSuccess for Succession\n\nSuccession was the big winner in the TV categories - following the fourth and final season of the drama about a media mogul and his children who battle for control of his company.\n\nKieran Culkin, who played Roman Roy in the series, was named best leading TV actor - an award previously won by his co-stars Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong.\n\n\"I was nominated for a Golden Globe like 20 years ago,\" he recalled, \"and when that moment passed, I thought, 'I'll never be in this room again'.\n\n\"I accepted I was never going to be on this stage.
