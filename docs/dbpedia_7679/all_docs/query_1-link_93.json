        "text": "On Jan. 5, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association honored its picks for the top movies, TV shows and performances of the previous year at the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards. Among the top Golden Globe nominees on the movie side were Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman and Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood. On the TV side, HBO’s Chernobyl and the Netflix series Unbelievable and The Crown led the pack.\n\nThe night’s big winners included Tarantino, who won Best Screenplay, and whose film took home the Best Supporting Actor trophy for Brad Pitt and Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical, as well as Best Picture – Drama winner 1917, which also won Best Director for Sam Mendes. On the TV side, Succession won Best TV Drama and an acting award for Brian Cox, while Phoebe Waller-Bridge won Best TV Performance by an Actress in a Comedy for Fleabag, which also won Best TV Comedy Series.\n\nThe 2020 Golden Globes, hosted by Ricky Gervais, kicked off this year’s awards season, which will culminate with the Oscars on Feb. 9.
