        "text": "Robert Downey Jr. has taken the Golden Globe for best supporting actor in a motion picture drama for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in Universal’s Oppenheimer. This was Downey Jr.’s fifth Golden Globe nomination and third win.\n\n“Yeah, yeah, I took a Beta blocker so this is going to be a breeze,” a clearly exhuberant Downey Jr. began his acceptance speech tonight.” A sweeping story about the ethical dilemma of nuclear weapons grosses 1 billion dollars, does that track? No, unless and but because Universal went all in on Christopher Nolan, to direct Cillian Murphy with Emma Thomas producing with Emily [Blunt] and Florence [Pugh] and this cast and crew and helped them render a goddamn masterpiece.”\n\nDowney Jr. also gave a shout-out to his agents, whom he referred to as his dueling career counsels. “They had the gall to say I needed to re-start my career, it’s so fun proving agents right.”\n\nThe Nolan-directed Oppenheimer revolves around J. Robert Oppenheimer, played by Murphy, the scientist who ran the Manhattan Project that led to the invention of the atomic bomb.\n\nFlorence Pugh, Emily Blunt, Matt Damon co-star in the film directed and written by Nolan.\n\nNolan produced along with Emma Thomas and Atlas Entertainment’s Charles Roven. The film is based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning book American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer by Kai Bird and the late Martin J. Sherwin.\n\nDowney Jr.’s fellow nominees in the category included Willem Dafaoe (Poor Things), Robert De Niro (Killers of the Flower Moon), Ryan Gosling (Barbie), Charles Melton (May December) and Mark Ruffalo (Poor Things)."
