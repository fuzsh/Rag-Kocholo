        "text": "Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy\n\nNominees:\n\nDonald Glover (Atlanta)\n\nBill Hader (Barry)\n\nSteve Martin (Only Murders in the Building)\n\nMartin Short (Only Murders in the Building)\n\nJeremy Allen White (The Bear)\n\nDonald Glover – Atlanta\n\nFive years after winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his performance in Atlanta, Donald Glover has been nominated for the Award for the third time for the same role in the series’ latest season. Glover is a multi-talented artist, who has starred in many successful movies and TV series. He is the creator and writer of, and actor in, the popular series, Atlanta, in which he plays the role of Earn, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, and is trying to achieve his ambitions in the world of rap music with his cousin Alfred.\n\nDespite the success of the series and the desire of its audience to see more seasons of it, Glover has decided that the fourth season will be the last one. He said in an interview with the Television Critics Association: “Death is natural. I feel like when the conditions are right for something, they happen, and when the conditions aren’t right, they don’t happen. I don’t feel any longevity. Because then things start to get weird.” And so, the end chapter of Atlanta was written.\n\nBill Hader – Barry\n\nBill Hader, a multi-talented comedian, is nominated for the third time for the Golden Globe Award for his role in the TV comedy, Barry, which he co-wrote and co-directed. The series is about Barry Berkman, an ex-marine who has become a professional assassin. On his way to a job, he meets a group of actors: after he discovers his own passion for acting, he changes from a killer into an actor. Although the latest season of the show is gloomier than earlier seasons, it has retained its fans.\n\nHader said in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter: “Here’s what the characters would do, but it’s a comedy so it has to be funny. I wanted to stay true to the characters.”\n\nThe audience is eagerly awaiting the fourth season of the series, which has not yet been announced.\n\nSteve Martin – Only Murders in the Building\n\nSeasoned actor Steve Martin wins his seventh nomination for the Award, for his role in Only Murders in the Building, in which he plays Charles Haden-Savage, a semi-retired actor who became famous playing a detective on TV; when he stumbles upon a murder in real life, he uses his acting experiences to investigate the crime and try to discover the murderer.\n\nMartin won his first Golden Globe nomination 40 years ago, for his role in the 1982 movie Pennies from Heaven. He has not yet won either a Golden Globes or an Oscar award for any one role: however, the Academy gave him an honorary award in 2014, in recognition of his extraordinary talent and unique inspiration in the art of motion pictures.\n\nHe co-stars in the series with two other talented actors: Martin Short, who is in competition with him in the same category, and Selena Gomez, who has received her first nomination for a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy for her work on the same show.\n\nMartin Short – Only Murders in the Building\n\nMulti-talented TV star Martin Short receives a nomination for the Award for the second consecutive year for his role in Only Murders in the Building in which he plays Broadway director Oliver Putnam.\n\nThe on-screen chemistry between Short and Martin is palpable. Short said of this chemistry in an interview with TIME magazine: “We are very, very close friends so that makes it fun on stage. But what’s also great about working with Steve is you’re working with someone with literally perfect timing.”\n\nJeremy Allen White – The Bear\n\nYoung star Jeremy Allen White is the only first-time Golden Globe nominee in this category, which he receives for his role in The Bear. In it, he plays Carmen Berzatto, a talented cook, who on his brother’s death is required to go back to Chicago to manage the family-owned sandwich shop there. There he faces many changes moving from his original job in a fancy restaurant, to facing the daily struggles of running a small sandwich store.\n\nIn order to prepare for the role, White took an intensive cooking course to teach him to act as if he were a professional cook."
