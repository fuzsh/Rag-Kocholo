        "text": "Most of our favorite singers have also debuted in acting and almost got the same appraisal they used to get in singing. Here we have 18 singers who became standout actors.\n\nJanelle Monae\n\nMonae has been impressing people with their singing talent since they were a child. But it wasn’t until 2016, when they had key roles in two highly praised dramas, that we realized they could also act. Monae made their live-action cinematic debut as Teresa in the Oscar-winning film Moonlight.\n\nWhitney Houston\n\nShe has had the best vocals of her day, and is considered to be a great singer. So it’s not surprising that when she made her feature film debut in The Bodyguard as a renowned singer and actress, she slipped right into the character. Houston and Kevin Costner had such compelling chemistry that it almost felt real.\n\nIce Cube\n\nCube, or O’Shea Jackson Sr., began rapping in high school. Not long after, he co-starred in his debut film as Darrin “Doughboy” Baker, opposite Cuba Gooding Jr. This role demonstrated his acting abilities in addition to his musical skills, launching a long and successful cinema career.\n\nMark Wahlberg\n\nWahlberg is now so well known as an actor that many young people may be unaware that his career began in music. The Funky Bunch, a band of which Mark was a part, split in 1993, and Wahlberg made a few brief film and television appearances. However, it was not until his big role as adult film star Eddie Adams, a.k.a. Dirk Diggler, in Boogie Nights that he truly got to prove himself on screen.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nBeing born into great poverty in Tennessee, Parton established herself as a country music singer and composer at an early age. She had already been on a number of discussion and variety shows before her debut in a feature film in 1980. Parton immediately showed her ability to hold her own character alongside two silver screen superstars with whom she was working in 9 to 5.\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nShe began her career as a nightclub singer before moving on to Broadway musicals, where she immediately became well known. When Funny Girl was adapted for cinemas in 1968, with Streisand reprising her major role, everyone had the opportunity to appreciate both her singing and acting abilities.\n\nCher\n\nIn films such as Silkwood, Cher, the renowned singer, was able to demonstrate her dramatic acting abilities. Her performance in 1985’s Mask is often regarded as the pinnacle of her acting abilities in these more serious roles. The biographical drama is full of emotional highs and lows, allowing Cher to express a range of emotions.\n\nDiana Ross\n\nJennifer Hudson\n\nFans of American Idol thought Hudson was going to be a successful singer from the moment she came into the audition session because her voice was absolutely beautiful. Just a few years later, she had an equally spectacular acting debut as Effie White, the lead singer of the Dreamettes.\n\nLady Gaga\n\nWhen people think of this legendary singer’s acting, they may remember her stunning lead performance in A Star is Born.
