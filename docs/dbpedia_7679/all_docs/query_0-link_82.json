        "text": "Fey, Pohler return for encore performance Sunday at Golden Globe Awards\n\nIf Woody Allen attends the Golden Globe Awards, he'd rival Bill Clinton as its biggest surprise guest.\n\nAllen will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award at Sunday's ceremony. The writer-director famously avoids awards shows, though, and skipped those for his previous 12 Golden Globe nominations.\n\n\"We've read that Woody's not going to be here,\" said executive producer Barry Adelman, who kept Clinton's appearance under wraps until airtime last year. \"We've heard rumors there may be some surprises.\"\n\nThough the 71st annual Golden Globes are just days away, the show is still coming together.\n\nSounds of buzzing drills and beeping scissor lifts fill the Beverly Hilton's International Ballroom, where workers are busy hanging chandeliers, assembling a stage and installing some of the 18 cameras that will capture the starry action on show night.\n\nApart from Allen, most of the stars supplying that action are confirmed: Emma Stone, the lead of Allen's latest film, will present his DeMille award, and Diane Keaton \"is going to join in,\" Adelman said. Chris Hemsworth and Formula One driver Niki Lauda will introduce best picture nominee \"Rush.\" Laura Dern will present best picture nominee \"Nebraska,\" which stars her dad, best actor candidate Bruce Dern. Kyra Sedgwick and Kevin Bacon will introduce their daughter, Sosie Bacon, who's serving as this year's Miss Golden Globe.\n\nOther presenters announced this week include Tom Hanks, Melissa McCarthy, Channing Tatum, Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Downey, Jr., Mark Ruffalo and Emma Watson.\n\nWith such a high celebrity quotient, there's a great image in every lens, said Globes director Louis J. Horvitz.\n\nTina Fey and Amy Poehler return as hosts for a second time after winning raves and ratings last year. They work without restriction with their own writing teams, Adelman said. His first look at their material will be Friday. They also write and improvise throughout the show.\n\nWhen Clinton left the stage last year, Poehler quipped: \"Wasn't that Hilary Clinton's husband?\"\n\n\"That was a total ad-lib,\" Adelman said.\n\nLeading nominees this year are the con-artist caper \"American Hustle\" and historical drama \"12 Years A Slave.\" Each has seven bids, including best picture, director and actor.\n\nBesides \"12 Years A Slave,\" directed by Steve McQueen, other contenders in the best dramatic film category include \"Captain Phillips,\" \"Rush,\" \"Gravity\" and \"Philomena.\"\n\nDavid O. Russell's \"American Hustle\" is joined in the best musical or comedy film category by the computer love story \"Her,\" road movie \"Nebraska,\" folk-musician story \"Inside Llewyn Davis\" and Martin Scorsese's \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"\n\nFor best TV series, the dramatic nominees are \"Breaking Bad,\" ''Downton Abbey,\" ''The Good Wife,\" ''House of Cards\" and \"Masters of Sex.\" Comedy contenders are \"The Big Bang Theory,\" ''Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" ''Girls,\" ''Modern Family\" and Poehler's \"Parks and Recreation.\"\n\nOn TV\n\nThe Golden Globe Awards will air 7-10 p.m. Sunday on NBC.\n\nGolden Globes: Picking the winners\n\nUSA Today movie critic Claudia Puig predicts who will and should win Golden Globe awards from among the nominees in film.\n\nMotion picture,\n\ndrama\n\nNominees: \"12 Years a Slave,\" \"Captain Phillips,\" \"Gravity,\" \"Philomena,\" \"Rush\"\n\nWill win/should win: \"12 Years a Slave\"\n\nGiven how profoundly moving and impeccably acted this film is — and the gravity of its subject matter — it will likely edge out its toughest competition, \"Gravity.\" It's a beautifully rendered film about the ugliest period in American history. With its blend of uncompromising authenticity and tempered sense of uplift, \"12 Years\" is the clear-cut choice for best drama.\n\nMotion picture,\n\nmusical or comedy\n\nNominees: \"American Hustle,\" \"Her,\" \"Inside Llewyn Davis,\" \"Nebraska,\" \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"\n\nWill win: \"American Hustle\"\n\nShould win: \"Nebraska\"\n\nNeither of these movies is a comedy in any traditional sense, but both have darkly comic elements. While \"Hustle\" is an entertaining tale with engaging performances, \"Nebraska\" is a masterful blend of wit and drama with superb performances, gorgeous cinematography and a pitch-perfect screenplay.\n\nActress in a motion picture, drama\n\nNominees: Cate Blanchett, \"Blue Jasmine\"; Sandra Bullock, \"Gravity\"; Judi Dench, \"Philomena\"; Emma Thompson, \"Saving Mr. Banks\"; Kate Winslet, \"Labor Day\"\n\nWill win/should win: Blanchett\n\nThe early momentum has been with Blanchett and her latter-day Blanche DuBois in Woody Allen's latest film. The groundswell remains intact, though \"Saving Mr. Banks'\" Thompson is a formidable competitor. But the deluded, tragic and shockingly self-absorbed \"Jasmine\" is the juiciest of roles, and Blanchett plays it fabulously.\n\nActor in a motion picture, drama\n\nNominees: Chiwetel Ejiofor, \"12 Years a Slave\"; Idris Elba, \"Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom\"; Tom Hanks, \"Captain Phillips\"; Matthew McConaughey, \"Dallas Buyers Club\"; Robert Redford \"All is Lost\"\n\nWill win/should win: Redford\n\nRedford's essentially silent performance as a solo sailor is his best in decades and the most captivating in a very competitive category. What the veteran actor is able to convey about his beleaguered character with gestures, facial expressions and physicality is staggering. He's an iconic movie star, which is something the Hollywood Foreign Press Association likes to honor. This will likely be the most closely contested category.\n\nActress in a motion picture, musical or comedy\n\nNominees: Amy Adams, \"American Hustle\"; Julie Delpy, \"Before Midnight\"; Greta Gerwig, \"Frances Ha\"; Julia Louis-Dreyfus, \"Enough Said\"; Meryl Streep, \"August: Osage County\"\n\nWill win: Streep\n\nShould win: Louis-Dreyfus\n\nStreep is a perennial awards winner and the most admired actress in America, so she's almost always at the head of the pack of nominees. But hers is a scenery-chewing role that, while riveting, lacks subtlety. Louis-Dreyfus' believable, multi-layered performance in \"Enough Said\" digs deeper and conveys humor, wistfulness, charm, awkwardness and regret.\n\nActor in a motion picture, musical or comedy\n\nNominees: Christian Bale, \"American Hustle\"; Bruce Dern, \"Nebraska\"; Leonardo DiCaprio, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\"; Oscar Isaac, \"Inside Llewyn Davis\"; Joaquin Phoenix, \"Her\"\n\nWill win: DiCaprio\n\nShould win: Dern\n\nThe HFPA is notorious for choosing razzle-dazzle over substance and movie star turns over character studies, so DiCaprio is the obvious choice for his entertaining and occasionally clownish portrayal of a Wall Street weasel defined by excess and entitled lawlessness. DiCaprio's character quickly fades from memory, however. Dern's grizzled curmudgeon is haunting, complex and raw, never caricatured or predictable — and leaves an indelible impression.\n\nDirector, motion picture\n\nNominees: Alfonso Cuaron, \"Gravity\"; Paul Greengrass, \"Captain Phillips\"; Steve McQueen, \"12 Years a Slave\"; Alexander Payne, \"Nebraska\"; David O. Russell, \"American Hustle\"\n\nWill win/should win: Cuaron\n\nThe breathtaking technical achievements of Cuarón in his dazzling 3-D space adventure make him the clear-cut favorite. Helming a film where a pair of astronauts look so convincingly, dizzyingly adrift in outer space is a spectacular feat. A visionary filmmaker, Cuarón probably deserves the award for the 12-minute opening action sequence alone. But everything that comes after induces a sense of wonderment rarely experienced in films.\n\nAnimated feature film\n\nNominees: \"The Croods,\" \"Despicable Me 2,\" \"Frozen\"\n\nWill win/Should win: \"Frozen\"\n\nIn addition to its spectacular box office success, Frozen, a tale of princess sisters in an icy world, has gorgeous visuals, charming humor and remarkably catchy songs to recommend it. It wasn't a great year for animation until Frozen swirled into theaters in November, and It will win the trophy, mittened hands down."
