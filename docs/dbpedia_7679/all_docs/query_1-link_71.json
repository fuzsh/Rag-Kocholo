        "text": "The 2024 Golden Globe Awards are back and on a new network after yet more drama. They were booted from longtime home NBC, and are now under the ownership of Dick Clark Productions.\n\nBut, even with all the changes, the ceremony — hosted by Jo Koy — should still see A-listers boozing it up and duking it out for Hollywood’s second biggest prize.\n\nHere are The Post’s critics’ picks for which movies and TV shows will win on Sunday, Jan. 7 on CBS and Paramount+ at 8 p.m.\n\nFILM PREDICTIONS from JOHNNY OLEKSINSKI\n\nMotion Picture – Drama\n\nPredicted winner: “Oppenheimer” Christopher Nolan’s epic film about the father of the atomic bomb surprisingly lifted last year’s struggling box office. But “Oppenheimer” was not only a major event — its quality matched the excitement around it.\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\n“Maestro”\n\n“Past Lives”\n\n“The Zone of Interest”\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nMotion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nPredicted winner: “Barbie” There are more worthy films in this category. But the Globes will fall over themselves for Greta Gerwig’s doll movie starring Margot Robbie.\n\n“Poor Things”\n\n“American Fiction”\n\n“The Holdovers”\n\n“May December”\n\n“Air”\n\nActor in a Motion Picture – Drama\n\nPredicted winner: Cillian Murphy (“Oppenheimer”) Cooper could pull it off for his hammy performance as Leonard Bernstein, but the Globes, which are still voted on by international journalists, are a good place for an Irish actor like the excellent Murphy to shine.\n\nBradley Cooper (“Maestro”)\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (“Killers of the Flower Moon”)\n\nColman Domingo (“Rustin”)\n\nAndrew Scott (“All of Us Strangers”)\n\nBarry Keoghan (“Saltburn”)\n\nActress in a Motion Picture – Drama\n\nPredicted winner: Lily Gladstone (“Killers of the Flower Moon”) Martin Scorsese’s film could pull off some upsets, but its safest bet for a win is the terrific and vulnerable Gladstone.\n\nCarey Mulligan (“Maestro”)\n\nSandra Hüller (“Anatomy of a Fall”)\n\nAnnette Bening (“Nyad”)\n\nGreta Lee (“Past Lives”)\n\nCailee Spaeny (“Priscilla”)\n\nActor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nPredicted winner: Paul Giamatti (“The Holdovers”) Wright is well-liked and very good in “American Fiction,” but Giamatti’s cranky turn as a 1970s teacher will be comforting and familiar for voters.\n\nNicolas Cage (“Dream Scenario”)\n\nTimothée Chalamet (“Wonka”)\n\nMatt Damon (“Air”)\n\nJoaquin Phoenix (“Beau Is Afraid”)\n\nJeffrey Wright (“American Fiction”)\n\nActress in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy\n\nPredicted winner: Emma Stone (“Poor Things”) If there’s any voting body that will embrace Yorgos Lanthimos’ crazy movie and Emma Stone’s out-there performance as a nympho science experiment, it’s the Globes.\n\nFantasia Barrino (“The Color Purple”)\n\nJennifer Lawrence (“No Hard Feelings”)\n\nNatalie Portman (“May December”)\n\nAlma Pöysti (“Fallen Leaves”)\n\nMargot Robbie (“Barbie”)\n\nActor in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture\n\nPredicted winner: Robert Downey Jr. (“Oppenheimer”) In another stacked category, Downey Jr. is doing some of the best work of his career — and thankfully without a cumbersome flying metal suit.\n\nWillem Dafoe (“Poor Things”)\n\nRobert DeNiro (“Killers of the Flower Moon”)\n\nRyan Gosling (“Barbie”)\n\nCharles Melton (“May December”)\n\nMark Ruffalo (“Poor Things”)\n\nActress in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture\n\nPredicted winner: Danielle Brooks (“The Color Purple”) Brooks’ defiant, thrilling Sofia is one of the easiest boxes to check on the entire ballot.\n\nEmily Blunt (“Oppenheimer”)\n\nJodie Foster (“Nyad”)\n\nJulianne Moore (“May December”)\n\nRosamund Pike (“Saltburn”)\n\nDa’Vine Joy Randolph (“The Holdovers”)\n\nDirector\n\nPredicted winner: Christopher Nolan (“Oppenheimer”) He’s one of the best directors working today, and he’s never won a Globe. Right this wrong.\n\nBradley Cooper (“Maestro”)\n\nGreta Gerwig (“Barbie”)\n\nYorgos Lanthimos (“Poor Things”)\n\nMartin Scorsese (“Killers of the Flower Moon”)\n\nCeline Song (“Past Lives”)\n\nScreenplay\n\nPredicted winner: “Past Lives” (Celine Song) The Globes clearly admire the sublime “Past Lives” — it got more nods than expected — and a screenplay win will be a good way to show the A24 indie some love.\n\n“Barbie” (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach)\n\n“Poor Things” (Tony McNamara)\n\n“Oppenheimer” (Christopher Nolan)\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon” (Eric Roth and Martin Scorsese)\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall” (Justine Triet and Arthur Harari)\n\nOriginal Score\n\nLudwig Göransson (“Oppenheimer”) In a year absent big, memorable marches and themes, “Oppenheimer” should win for simply having the most score.\n\nJerskin Fendrix (“Poor Things”)\n\nRobbie Robertson (“Killers of the Flower Moon”)\n\nMica Levi (“The Zone of Interest”)\n\nDaniel Pemberton (“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”)\n\nJoe Hisaishi (“The Boy and the Heron”)\n\nOriginal Song\n\nPredicted winner: “What Was I Made For?” from “Barbie” (Billie Eilish and Finneas) No contest.\n\n“Dance the Night” from “Barbie” (Caroline Ailin, Dua Lipa, Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt)\n\n“Addicted to Romance” from “She Came To Me” (Bruce Springsteen and Patti Scialfa)\n\n“Peaces” from “The Super Mario Bros. Movie” (Jack Black, Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic, Eric Osmond and John Spiker)\n\n““I’m Just Ken” from “Barbie” (Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt)\n\n“Road to Freedom” from “Rustin” (Lenny Kravitz)\n\nBest Animated Film\n\nPredicted winner: “The Boy and the Heron” While most people’s money is on “Spider-Verse,” it’s a sequel and legendary “Heron” director Hayao Miyazaki is admired all over the world.\n\n“Elemental”\n\n“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”\n\n“The Super Mario Bros. Movie”\n\n“Suzume”\n\n“Wish”\n\nMotion Picture – Non-English Language\n\nPredicted winner: “Anatomy of a Fall” (France) In a fabulous year for international films, the Globes will probably side with the Cannes Palme d’Or winner.\n\n“The Zone of Interest” (United Kingdom)\n\n“Fallen Leaves” (Finland)\n\n“Io Capitano” (Italy)\n\n“Past Lives” (United States)\n\n“Society of the Snow” (Spain)\n\nCinematic and Box Office Achievement in Motion Pictures\n\nPredicted winner: “Barbie” This is a stupid category. It doesn’t take J. Robert Oppenheimer to tell us that “Barbie” made the most money. Maybe they’ll give it to Taylor Swift to thank her for making the trip.\n\n“Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3”\n\n“John Wick: Chapter 4”\n\n“Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One”\n\n“Oppenheimer”\n\n“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”\n\n“The Super Mario Bros. Movie”\n\n“Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour”\n\nTELEVISION PREDICTIONS from MICHAEL STARR\n\nSeries – Drama\n\nPredicted Winner: “Succession” This one’s a no-brainer. One of the most critically acclaimed, buzzy series of recent years — with riveting acting all-around — called it quits after four seasons with a take-no-prisoners finale.\n\n“1923” (Paramount+)\n\n“The Crown” (Netflix)\n\n“The Diplomat” (Netflix)\n\n“The Last of Us” (HBO)\n\nSeries – Musical or Comedy\n\nPredicted Winner: “Barry” This year belongs to Bill Hader’s dark HBO comedy. There was not a wasted moment in its fourth and final season, which went out with a literal bang and will be remembered as one of the best series of the decade with a stellar supporting cast — including Henry Winkler, Stephen Root and, especially, Anthony Carrigan (NoHo Hank).\n\n“The Bear” (FX)\n\n“Ted Lasso” (Apple TV+)\n\n“Abbott Elementary” (ABC)\n\n“Jury Duty” (Freevee)\n\n“Only Murders in the Building” (Hulu)\n\nActor – Drama\n\nPredicted Winner: Jeremy Strong (“Succession”) Strong’s riveting performance as the assertive, anxious, doubt-ridden paradox Kendall Roy was, as they say, “a thing to behold.” My initial thought was that Strong would be canceled out in this category by his “Succession” stablemates Kieran Culkin and Brian Cox, but he was that good and will withstand the competition … life imitating art?\n\nPedro Pascal (“The Last of Us”)\n\nKieran Culkin (“Succession”)\n\nBrian Cox (“Succession”)\n\nGary Oldman (“Slow Horses”)\n\nDominic West (“The Crown”)\n\nActress – Drama\n\nPredicted Winner: Bella Ramsey (“The Last of Us”) Ramsey’s Ellie humanized the dystopian terror of “The Last of Us” to create a character at turns compassionate, fierce, loyal, funny and sensitive. And that gallows sense of humor helps.\n\nHelen Mirren (“1923”)\n\nKeri Russell (“The Diplomat”)\n\nSarah Snook (“Succession”)\n\nImelda Staunton (“The Crown”)\n\nEmma Stone (“The Curse”)\n\nActress – Musical or Comedy\n\nPredicted Winner: Natasha Lyonne (“Poker Face”) She lit up the screen as Charlie Cale, whose flaky, brusque sense of humor and (literal) built-in BS detector drives this hard-charging dramedy episode after episode. Can’t wait for Season 2.\n\nAyo Edebiri (“The Bear”)\n\nQuinta Brunson (“Abbott Elementary”)\n\nRachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”)\n\nSelena Gomez (“Only Murders in the Building”)\n\nElle Fanning (“The Great”)\n\nActor – Musical or Comedy\n\nPredicted Winner: Jeremy Allen White (“The Bear”) Season 1 of “The Bear” was terrific … Season 2 not so much … but there’s no doubting that White’s intensity and nuanced performance as Carmy — right down to his breakdown in the Season 2 finale — is one of the best character turns on television right now."
