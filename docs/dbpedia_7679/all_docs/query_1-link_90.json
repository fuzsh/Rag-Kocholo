        "meta_description": "The 76th annual Golden Globe Awards were held in honour of the best films and television of 2018. The yearly ceremony is considered a lighter and less solemn precursor to the Oscars, and was held in Beverly Hills on Monday morning.This year’s event was hosted by actors Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh, who took over from 2018 host, comedian Seth Meyers. Oh joined a small group of actors who have won awards in the same ceremony which they hosted.The Globes this year pulled a twist at the end of the ceremony, with Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody staging upset wins. Green Book finished with three awards - the most for the evening - and was followed by the Queen biopic and Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma, with two each. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, considered by many as the favourites to win, went home empty handed. The Christian Bale-starrer political drama, Vice, directed by Adam McKay, led with six nominations, followed by Bradley Cooper’s directorial debut, A Star is Born, Yorgos Lanthimos’ period dark comedy, The Favourite, and the road trip drama, Green Book, with five nods each. Marvel’s Black Panther is the first superhero movie to be nominated for best picture, in addition to scoring two other nominations.Bale won the Best Actor (Musical or Comedy) award for Vice, while Rami Malek won the Best Actor (Drama) award for Bohemian Rhapsody.The television category was lead by FX and Ryan Murphy’s The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, with four nominations. Seven shows follow on the heels of ACS, with three nods each. These include Barry, Homecoming, The Marvellous Mrs Maisel and Sharp Objects. Crucially, The Handmaid’s Tale, last year’s winner of the top TV prize - best drama series - has been largely snubbed. This year’s ceremony will also be missing older heavyweights such as Stranger Things and Game of Thrones.Versace won the TV drama award, while Mrs Maisel took home the comedy Globe.Here are the highlights from the Golden Globes Awards | Hollywood",
