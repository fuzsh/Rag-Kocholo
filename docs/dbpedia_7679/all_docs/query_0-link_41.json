        "text": "Well, at least one half of Barbenheimer had a big Golden Globes night.\n\nThe race to March's Academy Awards kicked into a new gear Sunday with the 81st annual Golden Globe Awards, and Christopher Nolan's atomic bomb biopic \"Oppenheimer\" nabbing five honors including best drama, director, lead drama actor (Cillian Murphy) and supporting actor (Robert Downey Jr.). But Greta Gerwig's cultural phenomenon \"Barbie,\" the other half of everyone's favorite summer double feature, was upended by \"Poor Things,\" which took home best comedy and lead comedy actress for Emma Stone, though the pink-spattered flick did win for best song as well as cinematic and box-office achievement.\n\n\"The Holdovers\" was the other big Globes victor, getting lead comedy actor for Paul Giamatti and supporting actress for Da'Vine Joy Randolph. And in the TV categories, \"Beef\" won best limited series, \"The Bear\" garnered top comedy and \"Succession\" nabbed best drama.\n\nHere are all the Globes winners and highlights:\n\n\"I love everyone in this room right now,\" Gladstone says, after speaking in her Blackfeet language when she won her first Globe for best actress in a drama for \"Killers of the Flower Moon.\" \"This is a historic win − it doesn't just belong to me. ... This is for every Native kid out there with a dream.\"\n\nBut \"Oppenheimer\" beats out \"Flower Moon\" and others for best drama. \"They weren't kidding, this is a really intimidating room,\" says producer Emma Thomas. She shouts out her husband, director Christopher Nolan: \"What he does is unlike anyone else. Chris brings out the best in people just by being the best himself.\"\n\nKristen Wiig and Will Ferrell dance funny before introducing the winner for best actor in a comedy or musical. Giamatti gets the trophy for \"The Holdovers,\" his third Globe victory. \"Too many stairs. My knees are shot, I'm telling you. I'm never going to be in 'John Wick 5' at this rate,\" Giamatti jokes when reaching the stage. \"This has to be the first time this award has been given to a character who smells like fish. Thank you, Golden Globes.\"\n\nIt’s “Poor Things,” though, that surprises as best comedy, beating “Barbie,” “Holdovers” and a stacked category. “Whoa,” star Emma Stone says. Director Yorgos Lanthimos is quick to point out Bruce Springsteen, who shares a birthday with the filmmaker. “He’s been my hero since I grew up.”\n\nSnook nabs her second Globe for best actress in a drama. \"I was kind of hoping I wouldn't have to get up,\" she quips. \"This show has changed my life.\" Then \"Succession\" grabs the big prize: best drama. (It's the HBO show's third win in the category.) \"We decided it was the right time to end the show and it was bittersweet,\" creator Jesse Armstrong says. \"But things like this make it sweeter.\"\n\nNetflix's \"Beef\" wins for best limited series, adding a third Globe to its total. Creator Lee Sung Jin reveals that a real road-rage incident led to the show. \"I'd be remiss not to thank that driver,\" he deadpans. \"I hope you honk and yell and inspire others for years to come.\" \"The Bear\" (inspired by an eatery called Mr. Beef, incidentally) also picks up its third win of the night, for best TV comedy. Actor Lionel Boyce shouts out actual restaurant workers: \"We plays these characters for a couple of hours of a day but this is your reality.\"\n\n\"Star Wars\" icon Mark Hamill takes the stage as the perfect choice to introduce the first Golden Globe ever for cinematic and box-office achievement. Taylor Swift is the first to stand and clap happily when \"Barbie\" is named the winner. Margot Robbie hugs Hamill and gives thanks \"to every single person on the planet who dressed up and went to the greatest place on Earth: movie theaters.\" (Fun fact: Robbie is dressed up as Superstar Barbie from 1977.)\n\nIt's getting ridiculous out here now, with the atomic bomb biopic cleaning up with a fourth Globe. \"Oppenheimer\" composer Ludwig Göransson shouts out fellow Globe winners, director Christopher Nolan (\"The way you use music in your films has inspired a lot of people\") and star Cillian Murphy (\"I enjoyed watching your face over and over again\").\n\nOriginal song, though, goes to \"What Was I Made For,\" Billie Eilish's popular \"Barbie\" track with brother Finneas O'Connell. \"I was not expecting this in this moment,\" Eilish says, saying \"the movie saved me a little bit\" when she first saw it a year ago.\n\nFellow nominee Jennifer Lawrence jumps out of her seat for Stone's win for best actress in a comedy for \"Poor Things.\" \"This is amazing,\" Stone says. \"Playing Bella was unbelievable − I see it as a rom-com. Bella falls in love with life itself. (The movie) made me look at life differently and she has stayed with me.\"\n\nNext up is best actor in a drama, which Murphy conquers as the title role of \"Oppenheimer.\" \"My first question: Do I have lipstick all over my nose? I'm just going to leave it,\" Murphy quips when he hits the stage. He thanks director Christopher Nolan \"for carrying me and holding me through this movie.\"\n\nFirst big shock of the night: Hayao Miyazaki's latest takes down \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" for best animated movie. But it's no surprise Nolan takes the directing prize for \"Oppenheimer.\" He remembers his only time being on the Globes stage accepting an award for the late Heath Ledger. And now, \"I can only accept this on the behalf of people,\" Nolan says, shouting out cast members Robert Downey Jr., Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh and others.\n\nYour latest Swift update from the ballroom: The pop superstar's aisle seat is blocking traffic, as famous fans ask for selfies or take not-so-subtle photos. She jumps up to give Bill Hader a hug, and they chat before Hader goes for the selfie. \"Sure!\" she says, giving him a final hug before he walks on.\n\n\"Oh, a nightmare,\" Culkin deadpans after winning best actor in a TV drama – and beating castmates Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong. He remembers being nominated 20 years ago and resigned himself to never winning. \"Suck it, Pedro. Mine,\" he quips, playfully referring to fellow nominee Pedro Pascal.\n\n\"Anatomy of a Fall\" strikes again! Justine Triet returns to pick up the trophy for non-English language film. \"This movie is about the truth,\" she says, shouting out teenage star Milo Machado Graner, lead actress Sandra Hüller and canine Snoop \"for just being a dog.\"\n\nAmerica Ferrera and Kevin Costner shout out favorite scenes of theirs – Costner's a big fan of her \"Barbie\" monologue – and present \"The Bear\" star Ayo Edebiri the Globe for best actress in a TV comedy. \"I'm so very grateful for this,\" she says, out of breath, and thanks her show \"family,\" her actual one and \"the people who answer my crazy, crazy emails.\"\n\nIt's time for a new award: best performance for stand-up comedy in television. \"And thanks to Netflix, we get overpaid for it,\" quips presenter (and comedian) Jim Gaffigan. Gervais, a former Globes host, wins but isn't here so Gaffigan accepts for him: \"Gimme it.\"\n\nNext up is best screenplay. \"Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\" stars and presenters Daniel Kaluuya, Hailee Steinfeld and Shameik Moore have a hilarious time reading a script as it would be done by studio executives. \"Anatomy of a Fall\" takes the honor. \"No one is going to see this movie,\" French director and co-writer Justine Triet says but thanks those around her for \"encouraging me to do what I love.\"\n\nThen \"The Bear\" roars! White wins best actor in a comedy for the acclaimed FX restaurant show. \"I can't believe I'm in the room with people I've loved for so long. It's unreal,\" he says. Backstage, White fields three questions that all reference his new Calvin Klein underwear ad. Asked which was the prouder moment, his underwear ad or winning a Globe, he takes a dumbfounded pause before saying: \"This is definitely a prouder moment for me.\"\n\nPlaying Princess Diana, Debicki wins supporting actress in a TV show for \"The Crown\" and is pretty gobsmacked by the whole thing. \"This is just astonishing to me,\" she says in her speech. Presenters Ray Romano and Keri Russell banter before the next award – he mistakes her show \"The Diplomat\" for \"The Laundromat\" – which goes to Matthew Macfadyen, supporting TV actor honoree for \"Succession.\" \"I just adored every second playing the weird and wonderful human grease stain that is Tom Wambsgans,\" he says.\n\nHere's something you didn't see on the TV telecast: “Succession” star Kieran Culkin and his wife, Jazz Charton, swan to their seats, cocktails in hand, not noticing that they passed Timothee Chalamet and Kylie Jenner waiting to get their seats. Taylor Swift, carrying rose champagne, had a moment with bestie Selena Gomez, as the two hugged and chatted near the “Only Murders in the Building” table as photographers rushed over to capture the moment. All eyes are on Swift, who has an aisle seat at the “Poor Things” table with Mark Ruffalo and Emma Stone. She finishes her champagne, giggling as she looks at a friend’s iPhone.\n\nEarlier, a security phalanx cleared stars to \"move aside, move aside\" as Swift arrived with a big entourage. As the lights went down, she got the Hollywood push to her seat. \"Special circumstances,\" security guards said, shrugging.\n\nBrie Larson helps direct fellow nominee Wong to stage to pick up her honor for best actress in a limited series for Netflix's \"Beef\": She thanks ex-husband Justin Hakuta \"for all your love and support\" that helps her be \"a working mother.\" Her co-star Yeun then takes a victory lap winning his Globe as well. He jokes that getting an award is like the plot to \"Frozen,\" going from \"isolation\" to applause from his peers.\n\nAsked in the press room where she’ll keep her trophy, Wong says she doesn’t know yet, but notes the heavy object needs to be out of reach of her two children: \"It's like a medieval weapon!\" she exclaims, holding up the prize.\n\nYeun was getting asked if he drives differently since \"Beef\": “I’m a respectful but skillful and at times aggressive driver,\" he says smiling, pausing as if choosing his words carefully, trophy in hand. \"I live in LA. So I drive the same.”\n\nAngela Bassett and Jared Leto come out to present the first award. \"I've been in presenter mode for weeks now,\" Leto says, poking up at his acting method. And the Globe for supporting actress goes to Randolph for \"The Holdovers,\" as expected. She thanks director Alexander Payne for letting her \"playing this beautiful and flawed woman\" and also her character, Mary: \"You've made me feel seen.\"\n\nNext up is supporting actor, which goes to another favorite: Downey for \"Oppenheimer.\" \"Yeah, yeah, I took a beta blocker so this will be a breeze,\" he says. Downey says he's glad Universal \"went all in\" for Nolan and crew to \"render a goddamn masterpiece.\" He calls it a \"most improved\" award and thanks his wife Susan, who's \"made an art out of extracting me from my comfort zone.\"\n\n\"Look, I'm just taking this all in. We all dreamt of this moment,\" the comedian says as he begins his hosting duties. \"I've got the best seat in the house.\" He loved \"Oppenheimer\" but jokingly complains that \"it needed another hour,\" and also takes note of the celebrities: \"Kevin Costner's never here. He's in a mountain with a cow but today he's here.\" He also watched \"Barbie\" and loved it. \"I don't want you to think I'm a creep\" but Koy says he was attracted to a doll: Ryan Gosling. \"It's your eyes, Ryan.\"\n\nKoy's awestruck by Robert De Niro's \"latest performance\" and quips, \"How did you get (your girlfriend) pregnant at 80?\" The comedian takes some shots at \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" – \"White people stole everything!\" – and also \"Saltburn.\" \"I learned that even satanic families have feelings, too.\" He calls out \"The Color Purple\" and quips that purple is also the color \"your butt turns when you take Ozempic.\"\n\nThe host also jabs at Swift: \"The big difference between the Golden Globes and the NFL? On the Golden Globes, we have fewer camera shots of Taylor Swift.\"\n\nEmily Blunt, holding hands with husband John Krasinski, moseys into the ballroom with \"Oppenheimer\" co-star Cillian Murphy. \"Barbie\" nominee Ryan Gosling is in the house and Oldman's animated chatting with him and Murphy. The announcer breaks up the festivities, ordering folks to sit down as showtime draws near. Meryl Streep takes her seat at the \"Only Murders in the Building\" table just under deadline and kisses Short full on the lips before holding hands and talking, while \"Oppenheimer\" castmates Robert Downey and Florence Pugh are two more late arrivals just before lights go down amid a cheery, happy atmosphere.\n\nThe last person to arrive? Taylor Swift, of course.\n\nLarson hustled down the red carpet but we overheard that she had a starry moment with Jennifer Lopez: “I’m sorry, I just met J.Lo and I’m really having a hard time,\" Larson says. And in the ballroom, Short is working overtime networking with everyone he can find: The \"Only Murders in the Building\" star has chatted up and/or hugged Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner and Jennifer Aniston. Ford also shared a moment with old pals Steven Spielberg and his wife – and Ford's \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" love interest – Kate Capshaw.\n\n\"The Boss\" and his wife Patti Scialfa chat up Damon and Barroso near the Globe stage. (If Springsteen has a hungry heart, we hear the sushi is to die for.) Meanwhile Bateman is catching up with \"Ozark\" co-star Julia Garner and runs into fellow beard lover Gary Oldman, currently growing out his facial hair for a new season of the Apple TV+ spy show \"Old Horses.\" “I love 'Immortal Beloved,' that soundtrack is all I listen to,\" Bateman gushes to Oldman. \" 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy,' I could go on.\"\n\nUSA TODAY's KiMi Robinson is on the Globes red carpet and she reports that it's a \"brisk\" 53 degrees in Beverly Hills. As \"Succession\" star Alan Ruck stepped foot on the red carpet and walked past reporters using a cane, Amanda Seyfried − one of the few stars who took Moet up on their free champagne bottle − stopped him for a hug and a nice arm rub as everyone struggles to stay warm on the carpet.\n\nOur man Bryan Alexander is roaming the International Ballroom at the Beverly Hilton − ground zero for all the Globes news – and he reports that Matt Damon and his wife Luciana Barroso entered and immediately ran into Damon's \"Air\" co-star Jason Bateman. “What’s up, Jason, I love that beard. Let me take a look at that in the light. Looking good,” Damon said.\n\nThe Globes menu for attendees includes salmon tartare with caviar, yellowtail jalapeno, sashimi salad with Matsuhisa dressing, and tai nigiri Matsuhisa style. Everybody's raving about the sushi, because this is not typical awards fare.\n\nAlexander Payne's acclaimed 1970s-set holiday film isn't expected to win best comedy at tonight's Globes ceremony – blockbuster hit \"Barbie\" is the one to beat in that category – but two \"Holdovers\" castmates are faves in their respected categories: Paul Giamatti in lead comedy actor and Da'Vine Joy Randolph for supporting actress. See more of our predictions here.\n\nDowney is a Hollywood superstar, a Gen X movie icon, a box-office superhero ... but somehow not an Oscar winner. Yet. That might change this year: The two-time nominee (lastly in 2009 for \"Tropic Thunder\") is a favorite in the Golden Globe supporting actor race for his role as the antagonistic Lewis Strauss in \"Oppenheimer.\" For five of the past six years, the Globe supporting actor winner has run the table all the way to an Academy Award, which bodes well for Downey or one of his competitors: Ryan Gosling (\"Barbie\"), Charles Melton (\"May December\"), Robert De Niro (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\") and \"Poor Things\" duo Willem Dafoe and Mark Ruffalo.\n\nMaybe it's because boyfriend Travis Kelce isn't playing today, but Swift skipped the Chiefs/Chargers game. Or maybe she just wanted extra time to get gussied up for the Globes red carpet? The pop superstar is speculated to appear at the awards show, where her \"Eras Tour\" concert film is in the running for best cinematic and box-office achievement against the likes of \"Barbie,\" \"Oppenheimer\" and other theatrical hit movies. (Swift has been nominated four times in past Globes shows, all in the original song category.)\n\nEven after the Globe trophies are handed out tonight, it's just the beginning for both winners and losers on the road to Oscar night. On Wednesday, nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Awards will be announced to keep the ball rolling. Here are the important upcoming events and dates for the awards watchers:\n\nJan. 14: Critics Choice Awards\n\nJan. 15: Primetime Emmy Awards\n\nJan 18: British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominations announced\n\nJan. 23: Academy Awards nominations\n\nFeb. 4: Grammy Awards\n\nFeb. 18: BAFTA Film Awards\n\nFeb. 24: SAG Awards\n\nMarch 10: 96th Academy Awards\n\nRather than a televised red-carpet special, \"Entertainment Tonight\" and Variety are co-hosting a digital pre-show (6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 PT) that will stream on their sites and social platforms as well as on GoldenGlobes.com. For fashionistas who need to prep for the first major event of 2024, check out our Globes galleries of the best gowns ever as well as the wildest looks through the years.\n\n\"The Color Purple\" was shockingly left out of the Globes comedy/musical category, but producer Oprah Winfrey will be on hand as one of many celebrities handing out statues. The A-list group includes recent Oscar and Globe winners Daniel Kaluuya and Michelle Yeoh alongside Angela Bassett, America Ferrera, Florence Pugh, Will Ferrell, Issa Rae, Kevin Costner, Kristen Wiig, Mark Hamill, Amanda Seyfried, George Lopez, Hailee Steinfeld, Shameik Moore and many more. Plus, a bonus for anyone who's been binging \"Suits\" since the pandemic: a reunion of stars Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams.\n\nThose who haven't watched any of his Netflix specials may not recognize the 52-year-old stand-up comedian but Koy told USA TODAY in a recent interview that the Globes hosting gig is \"my childhood dream. I'm now living something that I would watch as a kid, something that indirectly inspired me to do what I do, seeing everyone from Bob Hope to Billy Crystal to Whoopi Goldberg do the Oscars, and Ricky (Gervais) and Tina (Fey) doing the Globes. Now, I’m in the captain's seat and I’m loving it.\"\n\nKoy, who's part Filipino on his mother's side and grew up in Seattle, also brings a fresh face to an awards show that weathered a diversity scandal and now finds itself at a pivotal point. \"I am just planning to be me, and I'm in the mood to celebrate,\" he said.\n\nSince 1961, the Globes have been held in the International Ballroom of LA's Beverly Hilton Hotel, which also plays home to the Oscar nominees luncheon as well as other red-carpet events. It's also the same hotel where Sen. John Edwards was caught having an affair with a presidential campaign staffer and where Whitney Houston was found dead in 2012.\n\nThe Golden Globes are available for the cord-cutting crew live on Sunday with a Paramount+ subscription that includes Showtime. Those with the cheaper Paramount+ Essential plan will have to wait until Monday to stream the show. (If you want to spring for six extra bucks a month, you get live Globes plus no ads and Showtime series like \"Billions,\" \"The Curse\" and \"Yellowjackets.\" Heck, catch up on \"The Tudors\" while you're at it!)\n\nThe show will air live on CBS (8 p.m. ET/5 PT) as well as on the CBS app and Paramount+. Show producers will likely be hoping for no overtimes in the late afternoon football games, though depending on where you live, you can check out Taylor Swift's favorite team, the Kansas City Chiefs, who are in LA to take on the Chargers. Globes organizers – as well as movie-loving Swifties – also might be hoping that Swift swings by the Globes, where her concert film is up for a trophy, if she also attends the game.\n\nContributing: Bryan Alexander; Charles Trepany; Kim Willis; KiMi Robinson; Marco Della Cava; Bryan West"
