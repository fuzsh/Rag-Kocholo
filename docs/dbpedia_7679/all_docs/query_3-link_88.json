        "text": "There is a whole other show that happens offscreen at the Oscars that the home audience doesn’t see on television.\n\nIt's been a stellar year in film, and not just because of the convergence of “Barbie” and “Oppenheimer” and their release dates.\n\nInside the ballroom at the 30th Screen Actors Guild Awards, “Oppenheimer” was front and center — literally and figuratively — snagging the night’s top prize along with awards for Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Ahead of this year’s Academy Awards, Christopher Nolan’s summer blockbuster increasingly looks like the run-away favorite.\n\nHarvard University’s Hasty Pudding Theatricals roasted Barry Keoghan, best known for his roles in “Dunkirk,” “The Killing of a Sacred Deer,” and “The Banshees of Inisherin,” as its 2024 Man of the Year Friday.\n\nThe Golden Globes had a bit of everything: Silliness, seriousness, history, a few good jokes and many bad ones, loads of stars — and Taylor Swift, who didn’t ascend the podium but still made her presence known as perhaps only Swift can.\n\nNanci Ryder, a powerful Hollywood publicist and co-founder of BWR Public Relations who became close to such stars as Rene Zellweger and Courteney Cox, died Thursday of Lou Gehrigs disease in Los Angeles. Zellweger thanked Ryder in her best actress acceptance speech when she won the Academy Award for Judy earlier this year. Stints at Goldberg-Ehrlich Public Relations and Management and Michael Levine Public Relations followed, before she formed Nanci Ryder Public Relations in 1984, with Fox as her first client. In 1987, she co-founded the firm BWR Public Relations with Paul Baker and Larry Winokur. This spring, the firm's parent company, Burson Cohn & Wolfe, shut down BWR Public Relations, moving staffers or laying them off."
