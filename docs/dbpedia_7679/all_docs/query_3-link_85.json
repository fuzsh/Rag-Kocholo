        "text": "The 81st Golden Globes was meant to be a comeback for the problematic awards ceremony, given the years of controversy and the uphill battle the ceremony has faced. With new voting members, major shifts (like Dick Clark Productions taking over from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association), and a promise to best represent the film and television industries, we got what we expected. No. Not what was promised. The usually messy Golden Globes that we expect. Everyone is drunk, high, or on something (Robert Downey Jr. actually admitted to being on beta blockers while accepting his Best Supporting Actor win for Oppenheimer, and he is likely one of the most sober people here). The in-between chinwagging is as forced as can be. This is a kick off for the major awards season and nothing more, and almost everyone knows this. With that in mind, I cannot emphasize how much I care about the wins more than anything, so let’s just do what we do when we watch these awards and just get through the ceremony, shall we?\n\nHost Jo Koy’s intro monologue was full of awkward pauses, and jokes that were either painfully on-the-nose (like his brutal impression of Robert De Niro, down to the “You talkin’ to me?” from Taxi Driver) to the intentionally uncomfortable (asking De Niro about his best “performance” of last year: impregnating someone at the age of eighty). He made a joke about Oppenheimer being impossible to finish because it is so long, and yet the low-hanging fruit was there with the nearly four-hour Killers of the Flower Moon. Other jokes include Barry Kheogan’s penis in Saltburn (and how Bradley Cooper’s prosthetic nose in Maestro is basically another flopping penis, I guess?). Throughout the evening, his material continued to land wonkily, including a Taylor Swift sleight that left her looking beyond unimpressed (that NFL games show her on camera more than this award ceremony will). Needless to say Jo Koy’s intentions were good, but his jokes were indicative of everything that people mock these kinds of award shows for. At least last year’s host, Jerrod Carmichael, went against the grain on purpose and the pain in his monologues and jokes was due to the discomfort he forced us to face (mainly the toxic nature of the entertainment industry and these award shows). You can’t proclaim the same rationale here with Jo Koy’s work which was strenuous despite his enthusiasm and charm, to say the least. This may be due to the fact that he only had a week and a half to prepare (which isn’t a lot of time for anyone), but I have to state how the ceremony was at this current state, and it was rough.\n\nThe ceremony shined, as usual, when the winners tried their best to keep their composures out of nerves, excitement, or drunkenness. A particularly great back-to-back was Ayo Edebiri (for The Bear) wanting to thank her family, as in the cast and crew of the show (before stating she wanted to obviously thank “her real family”, too, and virtually everyone “unless they were mean” to her), and Kieran Culkin becoming the Best Actor Waystar CEO over Brian Cox and Jeremy Strong for Succession (and telling fellow nominee Pedro Pascal, of The Last of Us, to “suck it” after his peculiar belch, in which he remarked that he should have just said “thanks” and moved on). The comedy and electricity came mainly from these winners and their on-the-spot rambling.\n\nEarly enough in the evening was a more bittersweet and touching acceptance speech by Christopher Nolan: his win for directing Oppenheimer felt like an instant pivot of the awards season race, with the floodgates opening and channelling the race towards a potential Oscars takeover. Here, Nolan reminisced on the last time he was on stage: accepting the posthumous award on behalf of Heath Ledger for his role as The Joker in The Dark Knight. He then stated that this evening felt no differently, because directors accept awards on behalf of others as well (this time, he acts as the face of the entire cast and crew that made Oppenheimer possible). It was a lovely and tender moment in a night that chose chaos when it woke up. Oppenheimer started off its tidal wave of wins early with Robert Downey Jr. winning for Best Supporting Actor with Cillian Murphy (Best Actor, Drama) and Ludwig Göransson (Best Original Score) following; the film would wind up with the final award of the night (Best Picture). Other sweeps included Beef (winning all of its limited series nominations, including for actors Ali Wong and Steven Yuen) and The Bear (same situation here, with Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri winning alongside the series’ Best Television Series, Musical or Comedy win). And then came Succession, which triumphed with its stellar final season, winning for both acting leads (Kieran Culkin and Sarah Snook), Matthew Macfadyen in a supporting role, and Best Television Series, Drama. Rounding out the major wins was Yorgos Lanthimos’ Poor Things, which pulled off the Best Picture, Musical or Comedy title with star Emma Stone winning for Best Actress in the same category.\n\nJust when I was feeling a bit more hopeful about this night overall, then came the stupidest decision of them all: the newest award titled Cinematic and Box Office Achievement. Basically, “Popular Movie: The Award”. It’s a category that honours the highest-earning box office titles of 2023. It’s as awful as it sounds in a ceremony that is meant to be honouring artistic achievements. Nonetheless, Barbie was the first winner of said award which brings the Barbenheimer phenomenon into full effect this evening (with all of the Oppenheimer wins, a couple of Barbie wins felt inevitable; the film previously won for the Billie Eilish number “What Was I Made For?” right before this subsequent win took place). I have no hope for this God-awful category from here on out, but at least the first winner is a strong comedy that brought people back to the box office and is actually worth cherishing outside of its popularity.\n\nOccasional moments brought a smile to my face. One such example was Lily Gladstone’s powerful speech when she won Best Actress for Killers of the Flower Moon, including the importance that her win means at this very moment and the usage of Blackfoot language in her acceptance (she also brought up how Native American actors had their English dialogue reversed to create an “indigenous” language in films of yesteryear, so we know how far we’ve come today). Justine Triet’s two wins for Anatomy of a Fall were the biggest surprises of the evening (mainly the win for screenwriting), and she used the moment to bring up how the script was concocted while she and co-writer and partner Arthur Harari were isolating during COVID-19. Da’Vine Joy Randolph was the first moment of glee of the evening, mind you, with an ecstatic and raw win for The Holdovers (this is the first of more, I assure you).\n\nThe speeches were mostly short and not political (and the few that were felt tasteful and impactful). We actually were only a few minutes over once the ceremony ended, and it was at this point that I took note of what was removed as an effort to make the Golden Globes better for audiences. No speech from Dick Clark Productions. No Cecil B. DeMille or Carol Burnett awards (these were shocking omissions). Even the acting nominations didn’t have clips for us to see why these actors were selected. I also noticed a lack of an in-memorium section, which I’m now questioning if the Golden Globes ever had one (it certainly wouldn’t hurt to honour the many who have passed). We saved many minutes of time, sure, but we lost a bit of the heart that the Golden Globes occasionally had. Outside of the winners and their moments to shine, the Golden Globes themselves felt like their infamous selves, only without the moments of warmth and effort that would bring these zany awards back to reality (at least for a little while). The heart came solely from the winners themselves, and once the 81st Golden Globes prioritized these moments above all else, the ceremony felt a lot more bearable. Otherwise, the Golden Globes are back, for better or for worse. Did they do enough to save themselves from obscurity? Maybe not, but at least the times, when the winners stole the show, reminded us of what these ceremonies should always be about: celebrating masters of their craft."
