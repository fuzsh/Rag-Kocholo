        "text": "There is seemingly a plethora of award shows like the Grammys, the Oscars, the Golden Globes, etc., that exist across the film and music industry to award people (primarily celebrities) for their hard-work and efforts within their field of work.\n\nThough to the average person, it may seem like a popularity contest and some even go as far as to claim that they are “rigged,” awards shows are important because they intend to honor those who have worked incredibly hard to create something that has a major impact across the world, like a film. This is why shows like the Golden Globe Awards exist.\n\nThe 81st Golden Globe Awards took place on Jan. 7, 2024, in Los Angeles, California, and honored the film and television productions of 2023. The show notably kicked off the 2024 awards show season.\n\nCelebrities like Taylor Swift, Timothee Chalamet, Selena Gomez, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were in attendance at the annual awards ceremony, in hopes of receiving one of the renowned Golden Globe trophies.\n\nThe show was hosted by American actor and stand-up comedian Jo Koy, who ruffled some feathers with his comments about Taylor Swift and the Barbie movie during his monologue, with many saying that he completely missed the point of the Barbie movie. `\n\nMovies like “Oppenheimer,” “Barbie,” “The Bear,” “Beef,” “Poor Things” and more were in the running for a Golden Globe this year, with “Oppenheimer” being the most awarded film of the night.\n\n“Oppenheimer” took home a handful of Golden Globes, with the movie itself winning the “Best Motion Picture Drama” award. Director Christopher Nolan received “Best Director of a Motion Picture.” Composer Ludwig Goransson was awarded “Best Original Score for a Motion Picture” for his efforts on the movie’s score. Lastly, cast members Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey, Jr. brought home “Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture” and “Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture,” respectively.\n\nThe well-loved summer movie “Barbie” brought home the “Cinematic and Box Office Achievement” award, as well as “Best Original Song for a Motion Picture” for Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell’s “What Was I Made For?”\n\nThe comedy-drama television series “The Bear” brought home “Best Musical or Comedy Television Series,” “Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Musical or Comedy Television series” (Jeremy White) and “Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Musical or Comedy Television series” (Ayo Edebiri).\n\nEmma Stone took home the award for “Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Musical or Comedy Motion Picture” for her performance in “Poor Things,” which was awarded the Golden Globe for “Best Musical or Comedy Motion Picture.”\n\nA handful of other Golden Globes were received throughout the night, but perhaps the most historical moment of the show occurred when Lily Gladstone received the Golden Globe for “Best Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture (Drama)” for her performance in “Killers of the Flower Moon,” making her the first Indigenous person to win a Golden Globe for best actress.\n\nDespite a few hiccups, the 81st Golden Globe Awards was successful in rewarding the work of those who deserved it the most."
