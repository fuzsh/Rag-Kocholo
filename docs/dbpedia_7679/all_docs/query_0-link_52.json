        "text": "The 81st Golden Globe Awards shook the film industry Sunday night with a reinvented show. Stand-up comedian Mr. Jo Koy hosted the program, implementing his trademark humor into the ceremony’s commentary. With two new awards, hilarious comedy, and high nomination counts for top films, the ceremony made film history.\n\nFollowing the Golden Globes controversy of previous years concerning the lack of diversity in the voters behind the ceremony, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA) tried expanding the awards categories, allowing for different types of media to receive awards. As of 2024, there are two additional categories: Cinematic and Box Office Achievement in Motion Pictures and Best Stand-Up Comedian on Television, according to goldenglobes.com. These changes are likely also a call for more attention and viewership, according to The New York Times. Senior Julia Randolph, Creative Filmmaking student, explained her enthusiasm about the new categories and how she feels they will transform the future of the Golden Globes and other award shows.\n\n“It excites me to see a glimpse into what the future of the Golden Globes might be,” Julia said. “Through adding these two new categories, more people’s work is celebrated for their vast contributions to the film and media industry. It brings attention to different types of media, trying to create more variety in what work is recognized.”\n\nFor the new category of Best Stand-Up Comedian on Television, Amy Schumer: Emergency Contact, Chris Rock: Selective Outrage, Ricky Gervais: Armageddon, Sarah Silverman: Someone You Love, Trevor Noah: Where Was I, and Wanda Sykes: I’m an Entertainer received nominations. In the end, Mr. Ricky Gervais won the first Golden Globe for Best Stand-Up Comedian on Television for his production Ricky Gervais: Armageddon, according to cnn.com. While he was unable to accept his award in person, this win marks the beginning of a new and reinvented Golden Globes.\n\nThe monumental movie Barbie left an impression on Hollywood. Receiving ten nominations, Ms. Greta Gerwig’s production has the second-highest number of nominations in Golden Globe history, according to variety.com. Closely following Barbie was Mr. Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, which generated eight nominations.\n\nOne of Barbie’s nominations was for the new category of Cinematic and Box Office Achievement in Motion Pictures. It is safe to say that Barbie was in competition with highly-acclaimed films in this section as other nominees were Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, John Wick: Chapter 4, Mission Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part 1, Oppenheimer, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie, according to goldenglobes.com. Barbie ended up winning the Golden Globe. While receiving the Golden Globe, lead actress Mrs. Margot Robbie expressed her gratitude for the new category.\n\n“Thank you so much to the Golden Globes for creating an award that celebrates movie fans,” Mrs. Robbie said, according to goldenglobes.com. “This is a movie about Barbie, but it is also a movie about humans. It is about you. It is for you, and we made it with love, so thank you for loving it back.”\n\nBarbie also won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song Motion Picture with Ms. Billie Eilish and her brother Mr. Finneas O’Connell’s song, “What Was I Made For?” This song bested five additional nominated works, including other Barbie favorites “I’m Just Ken” and “Dance the Night.”\n\nDespite its two wins, Barbie did not have as successful of a night as predicted. The film did not receive the Golden Globe for Supporting Male Actor in a Motion Picture, as Mr. Robert Downey Jr. beat Mr. Ryan Gosling for his role in Oppenheimer, according to The New York Times. Oppenheimer defeated Barbie again when Mr. Christopher Nolan received the Golden Globe for Best Director – Motion Picture. In his acceptance speech, Mr. Nolan expressed his objective as a director.\n\n“I thought it would be simpler to accept for myself. But, as a director, I realize I can only accept this on behalf of people,” Mr. Nolan said, according to variety.com. “As directors, we bring people together and we try to get them to give their best.”\n\nOppenheimer won again with Mr. Cillian Murphy taking home the Golden Globe for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture Drama for his lead role as physicist Mr. J. Robert Oppenheimer. Shortly after, Mr. Ludwig Göransson acquired the award for Best Original Score Motion Picture for his music in Oppenheimer. At the end of the night, Oppenheimer won five different categories, according to cnn.com. Mr. Göransson’s credited Mr. Nolan in his acceptance speech.\n\n“Thank you to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and thank you to Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas for inviting me on this journey and creating this masterpiece,” Mr. Göransson said, according to billboard.com. “Working with Christopher Nolan has been an incredible experience. The way you use music in your films and storytelling has inspired a lot of people.”\n\nAs a film student and fan of Oppenheimer, Julia felt that the movie was captivating and realistic. She shared her appreciation for the rightful recognition the film received.\n\n“As someone who watched Oppenheimer, I feel that the awards it received were well-deserved,” Julia said. “The music was moving, and the actors, especially Cillian Murphy, did a really great job of embodying their character and purpose. It definitely kept my attention throughout the entirety of the long film.”\n\nFeatured Image by Giada Coviello ’24"
