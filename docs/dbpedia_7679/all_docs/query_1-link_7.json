        "text": "The 2024 Golden Globe Awards have wrapped up, honoring the standouts in television and film. This year's ceremony was hosted by comedian Jo Koy and broadcast live from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, following a star-studded red carpet pre-show.\n\n\"Barbie\" and \"Succession\" both came into the night with nine nominations, tied for the most of any other movie or TV show. \"Barbie\" was competing for the best musical or comedy motion picture award, but lost out to \"Poor Things,\" while \"Succession\" was nominated for and won best television drama. \"Succession\" stars Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook and Matthew MacFadyen also took home acting awards for their roles in the acclaimed HBO series.\n\nBut the team behind \"Barbie\" didn't go home empty-handed. The box office smash took home a new award, cinematic and box office achievement — beating out Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" concert film, among others — and Billie Eilish's \"What Was I Made For?\" won best original song.\n\n\"Oppenheimer,\" the other half of the box office phenomenon dubbed Barbenheimer, scored eight nominations, the second most of any movie or TV show. \"Oppenheimer\" won best drama motion picture, beating out five other films, including Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" and Bradley Cooper's Leonard Bernstein biopic \"Maestro.\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" director Christopher Nolan also took home a Golden Globe, as did actors Robert Downey Jr. and Cillian Murphy and the film's composer, Ludwig Göransson.\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\" star Lily Gladstone made history with her win, delivering part of her acceptance speech in the Blackfeet language to honor her Native American heritage.\n\nIn the TV categories, \"The Bear\" and \"Beef\" both won multiple Golden Globes.\n\nThis was the first Golden Globes being held since the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which used to run the award ceremony, disbanded following a series of scandals. The Golden Globes assets were sold to Dick Clark Productions, which had long co-produced the show with the HFPA.\n\nThe ceremony was broadcast live on CBS and streamed live on Paramount+ and the CBS app, and scored the Globes' best ratings in years, with Nielsen estimating viewership of 9.4 million. CBS and Paramount+ are part of Paramount Global, which also owns CBS News.\n\nBelow is the full list of nominees and winners.\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\" — Winner\n\nEmily Blunt, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nDanielle Brooks, \"The Color Purple\"\n\nJulianne Moore, \"May December\"\n\nJodie Foster, \"Nyad\"\n\nRosamund Pike, \"Saltburn\"\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in any Motion Picture\n\nRobert Downey Jr., \"Oppenheimer\" — Winner\n\nRyan Gosling, \"Barbie\"\n\nRobert DeNiro, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nCharles Melton, \"May December\"\n\nWilliam Dafoe, \"Poor Things\"\n\nMark Ruffalo, \"Poor Things\"\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Limited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture Made for Television\n\nAli Wong, \"Beef\" — Winner\n\nBrie Larson, \"Lessons in Chemistry\"\n\nRiley Keough, \"Daisy Jones & the Six\"\n\nElizabeth Olsen, \"Love and Death\"\n\nJuno Temple, \"Fargo\"\n\nRachel Weisz, \"Dead Ringers\"\n\nBest Performance by an Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture Made for Television\n\nSteven Yeun, \"Beef\" — Winner\n\nMatt Bomer, \"Fellow Travelers\"\n\nSam Claflin, \"Daisy Jones & the Six\"\n\nDavid Oyelowo, \"Lawmen: Bass Reeves\"\n\nJon Hamm, \"Fargo\"\n\nWoody Harrelson, \"White House Plumbers\"\n\nBest Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Television Series\n\nElizabeth Debicki, \"The Crown\" — Winner\n\nMeryl Streep, \"Only Murders in the Building\"\n\nHannah Waddingham, \"Ted Lasso\"\n\nChristina Ricci, \"Yellowjackets\"\n\nAbby Elliott, \"The Bear\"\n\nJ.
