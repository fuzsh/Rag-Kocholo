They recognize several different recipients, have runners-up, and have third place. Since this is a specific recognition and is different from losing an award, runner-up mentions are considered wins in this award tally. For simplification and to avoid errors, each award in this list has been presumed to have had a prior nomination.\n\nAmerican actor and producer Robert Downey Jr. has received numerous accolades throughout his career including an Academy Award, two BAFTA Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards. He has also received two nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award.\n\nFor his role as Charlie Chaplin in the Richard Attenborough-directed biographical epic Chaplin (1991) he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama. For his comedic role in Ben Stiller's satirical war comedy Tropic Thunder (2008) he received his second Academy Award nomination, this time for the Best Supporting Actor as well as nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nDowney Jr. portrayed Larry Paul in the Fox legal drama Ally McBeal from 2000 to 2002.
