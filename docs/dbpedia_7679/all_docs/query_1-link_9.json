        "text": "Tuning into the Golden Globes this year meant more than catching a glimpse of the stars or getting an idea of what the Oscars might have in store.\n\nAfter the ethics, finance and diversity scandal within the Hollywood Foreign Press Association led to the cancellation of the 2022 broadcast, the Golden Globes were sold in 2023 and the Hollywood Foreign Press dissolved. So the looming question seemed to be: What impact would the show have this year under new ownership?\n\nIn the end, some things went exactly as expected, others not so much.\n\n“Succession,” which was up for the most awards on the television side, tied a record (with “Mad Men” and “The X-Files”) for the most wins in the best drama category — the series won for its second and third season in 2020 and 2022. And three of the show’s actors, Kieran Culkin, Sarah Snook and Matthew Macfadyen, took home awards.\n\n“The Bear” and “Only Murders in the Building” were each nominated for five awards — “The Bear” received three and “Only Murders” was left empty-handed.\n\nOn the movies side, “Oppenheimer,” which received eight nominations, ended up with five awards, including for the top prize in drama. Additionally, Cillian Murphy won best actor in a drama, while Christopher Nolan won best director.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
