        "text": "Yes, chef. The 2024 Golden Globes thought season two of The Bear was absolutely delicious, with the FX series taking home three statues over the course of the night, including for best comedy series.\n\nLionel Boyce, who plays pastry chef Marcus, accepted the award for best comedy series. “[I] also just want to say, most importantly, thank you to the entire restaurant community,” said Boyce. “We play these characters for a couple of hours a day for a couple of months out of the year. But this is y’all’s reality, the highs and the lows. So thank you for embracing us while we tell this story.”\n\nThe Bear was nominated for five Golden Globes going into the night, including best actor in a comedy series for Jeremy Allen White, best supporting actor in a television series for Ebon Moss-Bachrach, and best actress in a comedy series for Ayo Edebiri. VF had a feeling that the show would be a hit with the newly revamped Golden Globes after it gained more critical and commercial success in its second season, which followed White’s Carmen “Carmy” Berzatto and his struggle to open up a new restaurant.\n\nAfter burning up the internet with his steamy Calvin Klein ad campaign earlier this week, White kept his hot streak alive—emerging victorious in the best-actor-in-a-comedy-series category for the second year running, honored for playing the head chef on the series. This year he triumphed over worthy comedy foes including Bill Hader for Barry, Jason Sudeikis for Ted Lasso, Jason Segel for Shrinking, and Steve Martin and Martin Short for Only Murders in the Building. “I can’t believe I’m in this room with all these people I’ve loved so much, admired so much, for so long,” said White. “It’s unreal.”\n\nWhite went on to thank the ensemble cast of The Bear—all by first name. “I must have done something right in this life to be in your company,” he said. White ended his speech by shouting out his young children. “Ezer and [Dolores], you are my heart,” he said. “I love you, I love you, I love you.” White is also nominated for best lead actor in a comedy series at the upcoming Emmys.\n\nEdebiri, a rising star who also charmed viewers in Bottoms last year, took home her first Golden Globe, winning best actress in a comedy series for playing Sydney Adamu, sous chef to White's Carmy. The comedian, who got her big break replacing Jenny Slate as the voice of Missy on Netflix’s animated comedy series Big Mouth, took home the trophy over heavyweights like Natasha Lyonne for Poker Face, Selena Gomez for Only Murders in the Building, Rachel Brosnahan for the last season of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Elle Fanning for The Great, and her onscreen sister Quinta Brunson for Abbott Elementary.\n\n“I’m so very grateful for this—I’m in a room full of so many people who I admire and whose work has lifted me up,” Edebiri said. “I’m an artist, and I’m very lucky to be an artist, and I know we all feel that way, and so I just really want to acknowledge that.” She went on to thank her family—although it was adorably unclear which family she was thanking at first. “My family, my family, my family—everybody at The Bear,” she said. “That’s my family. I love you guys so much. It’s an honor to work with you and grow alongside you.” Don’t worry, Edebiri thanked her blood relatives as well: “My real family also—I love you guys too.”\n\nIn perhaps the most surprising moment of the evening, Edebiri shouted out not her agent and manager, but her agent’s and manager’s assistants, prompting Taylor Swift to nod in approval and mouth “okay” from the audience. Edebiri ended her speech by thanking everyone she forgot, “unless you were mean or something.” She’s also nominated for best supporting actress at this year’s Emmys, although she’ll be switching to the lead-actress category when being submitted for next year’s awards for season two of The Bear.\n\nAccording to White, season three of The Bear will find the gang headed back into the kitchen now that the restaurant is up and running. Who gets Carmy out of the freezer, however, is still anyone’s guess.\n\nAward Season\n\nFor Lessons in Chemistry, Brie Larson Learned How to Experiment\n\nShe couldn’t quite crack brilliant scientist Elizabeth Zott for the Emmy-nominated show until she had her own epiphany.\n\nTelevision\n\nIn The Day of the Jackal, Eddie Redmayne’s Shape-Shifting Assassin Meets His Match\n\nLashana Lynch faces off against Redmayne in Peacock’s bold reimagining of the classic cat-and-mouse novel, a thrilling escape with unsettling political parallels.\n\nTelevision\n\nThe Morning Show Season 4: Everything We Know\n\nTwo Oscar winners are joining the already starry cast for season four, which must answer a lot of major questions: “Everybody keeps asking me if Bradley’s in jail,” Reese Witherspoon says.\n\nHollywood\n\nDan Stevens Is Down to Get Weird\n\nMore than a decade after leaving Downton Abbey, the Cuckoo star reflects on what he’s learned—and passed on to costar Hunter Schafer: “I think it was refreshing and delightful for her to realize that not every job needs to be like Euphoria.”\n\nHollywood\n\nSay Ciao to the New Cast of My Brilliant Friend Season 4\n\nAn exclusive look at the final season of HBO’s Elena Ferrante series, which will finally premiere in September.\n\nAward Season\n\nHow Will the Presidential Election Affect This Year’s Oscar Race?\n\nThe outcome of the 2016 election was ever present at the Academy Awards that followed four months later. Could this year be the same?\n\nTelevision\n\nHouse of the Dragon's Army of Bastards Takes Flight\n\nOn the seventh episode of House of the Dragon season two, Rhaenyra looks to the lowborn to test their mettle as dragon riders. Director Loni Peristere drops by Still Watching to talk about crafting the season’s penultimate episode.\n\nTelevision\n\nCate Blanchett Faces Public Shaming in Disclaimer, Alfonso Cuarón’s Revenge Thriller\n\nThe Roma and Gravity Oscar-winner unveils his unsettling new series, which taps into the ancient human desire for schadenfreude.\n\nMovies\n\nReintroducing Humphrey Bogart: The Untold Stories of a Hollywood Icon’s Volatile Private Life\n\nThe Casablanca star’s career was shaped by his relationships with women, from his distant mother to the love of his life, Lauren Bacall. Those stories come to the forefront in a new documentary, Bogart: Life Comes in Flashes.\n\nStyle\n\nRadhika Jones on Jenna Ortega’s Rise to Stardom\n\nThe VF editor in chief charts the September cover star’s trajectory from nine-year-old working actor to global name—and now a producer on Wednesday."
