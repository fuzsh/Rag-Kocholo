        "text": "Acceptance speeches at the Golden Globes tend to go one of two ways. There’s the straight option, whereby the recipient graciously lists the cast and crew, before raising the Globe and saying something like, “Thank you so much.” Then there are the overwhelmed, usually first-timers, which involve a lot of stuttering and bewilderment, and “I can’t believe I’m here” etc etc. Robert Downey Jr naturally has too much rizz for either option. When he accepted his award for Best Supporting Male Actor in a Motion Picture Drama for his portrayal of Lewis Strauss in Oppenheimer, he began by waving the crowd off. “Yeah… yeah…” he said, hair askew, “I took a beta blocker so this is going to be a breeze.”\n\nHe then went on to chat to the audience in the a tone of someone's sarcastic yet oddly sexy dad holding fort at your local bar – very Tony Stark-coded. “Dozens of folks have come up to me since the summertime saying that I was – quote – unrecognisably subtle as Leonard Strauss… to my fellow nominees, let’s not pretend this is a compliment, this is a first time, this is more of a most-improved player thing.” After which he thanked his wife, Susan Downey: “Speaking of motivators, my primary caregiver right there, Susan Downey. She has literally made an art out of extracting me from my comfort zones… that I need to feel safe! But she's easy on the eyes, so whatevs.”\n\nThis isn’t Robert Downey Jr’s first rodeo at the Golden Globes. In 2010, he won Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his turn as Sherlock Holmes and delivered a similarly caustic yet breezy speech whereby he thanked his wife for telling him “that Matt Damon was going to win so don’t bother to prepare a speech. That was at about 10am. I don’t have anybody to thank.” And lest we forget the year that the Iron Man actor delivered a speech in which he described the vibes as “mildly sinister” before claiming that he'd slept with most of the women nominees (actually, let's not revisit that).\n\nHow does this man remain so laidback, at all times? No amount of beta blockers can explain how Robert Downey Jr can tackle any awards speech, no matter how prestigious, with the air of a guy who just woke up 15 minutes ago, found a perfectly cut suit and delivered a few lines he made up on the spot all the while barely breaking a sweat?\n\nPlease Lord, may I approach every day of 2024 with the easygoing energy of Robert Downey Jr winning a huge award? Or even just one?"
