        "text": "The $950M blockbuster Oppenheimer from Universal was the big winner at the 81st Golden Globe Awards, winning five: Motion Picture – Drama, Director for Christopher Nolan, Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama for Cillian Murphy, Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture for Robert Downey Jr. and Original Score.\n\nNolan’s R-rated, three and a half hour opus on Robert J. Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, was his first film after breaking off from Warner Bros and was a big, $100M risk for Universal that paid off.\n\nWarner Bros’ $1.5B-grossing Barbie entered the Globes with eight nominations: Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy, Best Actress – Musical or Comedy (Margot Robbie), Supporting Actor (Ryan Gosling), Director for Greta Gerwig, Screenplay and three spots in the song category, but came away with a single win in song for Billie Eilish’s “What Was I Made For?” Searchlight’s Poor Things bested the doll epic with wins for Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress – Musical or Comedy for Emma Stone. Both Oppenheimer and Barbie were nominated in the newly created Cinematic and Box Office Achievement category, which Barbie won.\n\nHistory was made in two categories at tonight’s Globes. Anatomy of a Fall was a surprise winner in the screenplay category, becoming the first primarily non-English language film to ever win there. Justine Triet accepted on behalf of herself and co-writer and life partner Arthur Harari. In her speech Triet explains that she and Harari wrote the film during COVID, locked in their apartment. “Strangely, nobody died,” she joked, referring to the subject of her film’s central story about a woman on trial for the murder of her husband. She also, possibly inadvertently, revealed that the film contains a “suicide.” The film also won for Best Non-English Language Film representing France but is ineligible for the Oscars in that category since the country chose The Taste of Things instead. Unlike the Oscars, a country can have more than one film represented and nominated at the Golden Globes.\n\nLily Gladstone won Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama for her performance as Mollie Burkhart in Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon. The only Indigenous and Native American winner in Golden Globe history in this category, she began her speech in Blackfeet, continuing in English, “I love everyone in this room right now. I don’t have words. I just spoke a bit in Blackfeet language – a beautiful community and nation that raised me and encouraged me to keep going and doing this,” she said. “My mom — who even though she’s not Blackfeet – worked tirelessly to get our language into our classrooms.”\n\n“This is for every little rez kid, every little urban kid, every little native kid out there who has a dream and is seeing themselves represented,” said Gladstone, closing her speech to a full standing ovation.\n\nThe Holdovers was a double winner tonight, first for Da’Vine Joy Randolph in supporting actress (who made history this week by being one of only five women to win that category with the four major critics’ groups – NBR, NYFCC, LAFCA and NSFC) then Paul Giamatti, his third win in eight nominations, for Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy.\n\nSeveral films went home empty-handed tonight including Maestro, May December, Past Lives and American Fiction.\n\nThe television side saw history as well with only four shows winning among all categories and single shows dominating their respective drama, comedy and limited series categories in near sweeps. Succession was the top winner with four (from nine nominations but multiple in the same categories) including drama series, lead actor for Kieran Culkin and lead actress for Sarah Snook. The Bear took home comedy series, lead actor for Jeremy Allen White and lead actress for Ayo Edebiri. Beef was a triple sweep winning limited series, lead actor for Steven Yeun and lead actress for Ali Wong. Only Elizabeth Debicki’s supporting actress win for The Crown broke the mold.\n\nHosted by comedian Jo Koy for the first time, his opening monologue was met with groans and derision from the audience and viewers online. Between defensiveness over bad jokes landing flatly (“Some I wrote, some other people wrote,” he said. “Yes, I got the gig 10 days ago! You want a perfect monologue? Yo, shut up. You’re kidding me right? Slow down, I wrote some of these and they are the ones you are laughing at.”) and cheap shots at Barbie and Taylor Swift, Koy doesn’t seem likely to return to the Golden Globes stage anytime soon.\n\nMulti-Emmy Award-winning producing duo Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner of White Cherry Entertainment (WCE) served as executive-producing showrunners with Weiss directing.\n\nHere is the complete list of winners.\n\nBEST MOTION PICTURE – DRAMA\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer – WINNER\n\nPast Lives\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nBEST MOTION PICTURE – MUSICAL OR COMEDY\n\nAir\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nMay December\n\nPoor Things – WINNER\n\nBEST MOTION PICTURE – ANIMATED\n\nThe Boy and the Heron – WINNER\n\nElemental\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nThe Super Mario Bros.
