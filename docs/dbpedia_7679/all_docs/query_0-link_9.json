        "text": "The 81st Golden Globes were dominated by “Oppenheimer” and “Succession,” which won the bulk of the major awards on the film and TV side respectively on Sunday. Universal’s epic took Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director for Christopher Nolan and acting awards for Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. HBO’s “Succession” won Best TV Drama and acting awards for Matthew Macfadyen, Kieran Culkin and Sarah Snook.\n\n“Beef” reigned supreme in the Limited Series category with awards for stars Ali Wong and Steven Yeun, while “The Bear” was the favorite in the TV Comedy category with wins for Best Comedy Series and actors Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri.\n\nThe CBS telecast began with a thud on Sunday when host Jo Koy delivered a monologue that was widely considered one of the worst in memory. Instead of the bold take on the Golden Globes and HFPA controversy that Jerrod Carmichael delivered last year, Koy focused on lowest common denominator material like Barbie’s “big boobies” and how Robert De Niro impregnated his wife at age 80. Carmichael might have scorched the HFPA, but on Sunday, it was Koy who got scorched. “Is this the worst award show host monologue of all time?” wrote an X user.\n\nOnce he got off the stage, the groans kept coming as the stars did their best with the typically corny scripts provided to them as presenters. High points were Michelle Yeoh reminding people she can kick anyone’s butt; Jon Batiste and Andra Day livening up the room with their loose, funny presentation of best movie score and song; and Issa Rae and Simu Liu joking about getting to play all the alcoholics that white people have portrayed — and been rewarded for — over the years. (Lookin’ at you, Andrea Riseborough.)\n\nOne of the best moments of the show came late in the evening, when “Killers of the Flower Moon” star Lily Gladstone made history as the first Indigenous woman to win best actress. She delivered part of her speech in the language of the Blackfeet nation, and as she walked off the stage, she got a deserved standing ovation.\n\nThe night was low on surprises, with “Oppenheimer” emerging strong early on and wrapping up the night with Best Motion Picture — Drama. By then, it was a fait accompli, given that it had already walked away with best director for Nolan, best actor for Murphy (who accepted his award with lipstick on his nose) and score for Ludwig Göransson. It did, however, lose Best Cinematic and Box Office Achievement (one of two new categories introduced this year) to its summer movie season partner, “Barbie.” (The other was Best Stand-Up Performance, which previous Globes host Rick Gervais won for “Ricky Gervais Armageddon.”)\n\nThe ceremony was the first since Todd Boehly, chairman of private equity firm Eldridge Industries, announced in June 2023 that his company and Dick Clark Productions had bought all rights to the Golden Globes from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the now defunct group that was the subject of a Los Angeles Time exposé in April 2021. A new, 300-person voting body for the Globes was announced in October.\n\nCheck out the full list of winners below.\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nMaestro\n\nOppenheimer *WINNER\n\nPast Lives\n\nThe Zone of Interest\n\nBest Motion Picture — Musical or Comedy\n\nAir\n\nAmerican Fiction\n\nBarbie\n\nThe Holdovers\n\nMay December\n\nPoor Things *WINNER\n\nBest Motion Picture – Animated\n\nThe Boy and the Heron *WINNER\n\nElemental\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nSuzume\n\nThe Super Mario Bros.
