        "text": "In a typically self-deprecating speech, Murphy paid tribute to Oppenheimer director Christopher Nolan and his fellow cast-members and crew.\n\n\"To all my fellow nominees, whether you're Irish or not, you're all legends,\" he added, and also thanked his family.\n\nDespite an impressive career, the 47-year-old Ballintemple man had only one previous Globe nomination — for Breakfast on Pluto in 2006 — and the award likely makes him the favourite for an equivalent Oscar in March.\n\nIt was a huge night for Oppenheimer which also won the Best Film – Drama category, while Robert Downey Jr got Best Supporting Actor, and Nolan received the Best Director award.\n\nElsewhere, Poor Things edged out Barbie for the Best Film – Musical or Comedy, and its star Emma Stone won the Globe for Best Actress – Musical or Comedy. The surreal tale, which opens in this country on Friday, has strong Irish connections via its producers, Dublin-based Element Pictures, and cinematographer Robbie Ryan.\n\nIn the TV awards, The Bear won several major categories, including Best TV Series – Musical or Comedy, while Succession won Best TV Series – Drama.\n\nIt was also a big night for the Golden Globes themselves, which had been reeling since an investigation by the Los Angeles Times in 2021 shredded the credibility of the approximately 100-strong voting body, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, revealing major issues with diversity and voting practices.\n\nRecent reforms have seen voting switch to 300 entertainment journalists from around the world, and Sunday’s awards were seen as a first major test for the Globes.\n\nWhether the Golden Globes succeeded in dealing with their various issues will be debated in the coming days, but in Ireland at least they’ll get a thumbs-up for crowning a Corkman named Murphy.\n\nGolden Globes winners in full\n\nBest Motion Picture – Drama – Oppenheimer\n\nBest Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy – Poor Things\n\nBest Motion Picture – Animated – The Boy and the Heron\n\nCinematic and Box Office Achievement – Barbie\n\nBest Motion Picture – Non-English Language – Anatomy of a Fall\n\nBest Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama – Cillian Murphy, Oppenheimer\n\nBest Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama – Lily Gladstone, Killers of the Flower Moon\n\nBest Performance by a Female Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy – Emma Stone, Poor Things\n\nBest Performance by a Male Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy – Paul Giamatti, The Holdovers\n\nBest Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture – Robert Downey Jr, Oppenheimer\n\nBest Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture – Da’Vine Joy Randolph, The Holdovers\n\nBest Director — Motion Picture – Christopher Nolan, Oppenheimer\n\nBest Screenplay – Motion Picture - Anatomy of a Fall\n\nBest Original Song – Motion Picture – 'What Was I Made For?' from Barbie, by Billie Eilish O’Connell, Finneas O’Connell\n\nBest Original Score – Oppenheimer\n\nBest Television Series – Drama - Succession\n\nBest Television Series – Musical or Comedy – The Bear\n\nBest Television Limited Series, Anthology Series or Motion Picture Made for Television – Beef\n\nBest Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Series – Drama – Sarah Snook, Succession\n\nBest Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Series – Drama – Kieran Culkin, Succession\n\nBest Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy – Ayo Edebiri, The Bear\n\nBest Performance by a Male Actor in a Television Series – Musical or Comedy – Jeremy Allen White, The Bear\n\nBest Performance by a Female Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television – Ali Wong, Beef\n\nBest Performance by a Male Actor in a Limited Series, Anthology Series or a Motion Picture Made for Television – Steven Yeun, Beef\n\nBest Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role on Television - Elizabeth Debicki, The Crown\n\nBest Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role on Television – Matthew Macfadyen, Succession\n\nBest Performance in Stand-Up Comedy on Television – Ricky Gervais, Ricky Gervais: Armageddon"
