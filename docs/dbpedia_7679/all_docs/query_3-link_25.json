        "text": "'Iron Man' actor Robert Downey Jr. has made history as he finally won his very first Oscar at the 96th Academy Awards on Sunday, March 10.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. was nominated alongside Ryan Gosling, Mark Ruffalo, Robert De Niro, and Sterling K. Brown in the Best Supporting Actor category. Many were rooting for Downey Jr. to take home the gold statue as, believe it or not, he had never won an Oscar before.\n\nSunday night, that all changed!\n\nRobert Downey Jr. Takes Home The Oscar\n\nRobert Downey Jr. has starred in several films as a leading actor, which have grossed over $14 billion worldwide, making him one of the highest-grossing actors of all time. Despite this, he had never won an Oscar -- until now.\n\nAfter his name was read from the card, RDJ stood up and took center stage to accept the gold statue.\n\nIn his speech, Downey Jr thanked his “terrible childhood and the Academy, in that order” as well as his “veterinarian … sorry … wife, Susan Downey. She found me a snarling refuge pet and loved me back to life. That’s why I’m here.”\n\nThe actor then let everyone in on a “little secret”, as he said, “I needed this job more than it needed me … I stand here before you a better man because of it.”\n\nIn the past, the actor has opened up about the struggles he has faced in the past, including when was imprisoned as inmate P50522 in 1999, after he was sentenced to three years behind bars amid his struggle with illicit substances.\n\nRDJ Makes Oscars History\n\nRobert Downey Jr. was previously nominated for best actor in 1993 for \"Chaplin,\" and for best supporting actor in 2009 for \"Tropic Thunder.\" But it wasn't until this year, 2024, that he took home the golden statue for his role in \"Oppenheimer.\"\n\nBefore his name was read off the card, RDJ's name began to trend thanks to Jimmy Kimmel's \"distasteful\" joke about his drug history.\n\nDuring the opening monologue, Kimmel made a joke referencing the actor’s history of substance abuse, saying, “This is the highest point of Robert Downey Jr’s career… well, one of the highest points.”\n\nThe Oscar nominee then tapped his nose in recognition, to which Kimmel asked, “Was that too on the nose or a drug motion you made?” The actor then gestured for Kimmel to move on from the joke and continue with his monologue.\n\nDowney Jr. previously said he lived through “30 years of dependency, depravity, and despair” before he made his comeback as Iron Man in the MCU in 2008.\n\nRobert Downey Jr. Addresses 'Barbie' Oscars Snub\n\nA few weeks ago, Downey Jr. spoke out about his recent nomination at the upcoming 2024 SAG Awards, where he also addressed the infamous \"Barbie\" Oscars snub.\n\n“This is a weird non-sequitur, but Margot Robbie’s not getting enough credit — in my opinion — because America [Ferrera] has this amazing speech, and she nails it,” Downey Jr. said of America Ferrera’s iconic speech, which is more than likely what got her nominated for Best Supporting Actress.\n\n“But it’s the cut away to Robbie so actively listening. It’s when I realize, oh, okay, now I see Greta’s really on to something here, but it was Robbie who had to trust [her],” he added.\n\nRobert Downey Jr.'s Past Awards\n\nRDJ has previously won two British Academy Film (BAFTA) Awards, two Critics’ Choice Movie Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. He can now add the Academy Award to the list thanks to his role in \"Oppenheimer,\" which has been called Robert Downey Jr.’s best performance in years, if not his entire career!\n\nIn addition to the recent Oscar, RDJ also took home a Golden Globe and BAFTA for his performance in the film.\n\nCongratulations Robert Downey, Jr. on taking home the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor."
