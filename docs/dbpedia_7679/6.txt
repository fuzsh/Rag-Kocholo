Robert Downey Jr. won the best supporting actor in a movie award at the 2024 Screen Actors Guild Awards on Saturday night. Following an awards season full of comedic acceptance speeches by the actor, he took a moment to list off actors (and his wife) that inspired him throughout the years.

“This is actually incredibly meaningful to me, thank you very much,” Downey Jr. said. “Why me? Why now? Why do things seem to be going my way? Unlike my fellow nominees, I will never grow tired from the sound of my own voice.”

Downey Jr., who won for his role as Lewis Strauss in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer, continued: “I’m going to do a name check. I have Chris Nolan in my ear. Basically the only note he gave me, ‘maybe just one with nothing on it.’ Teri Garr, James Spader, Anthony Michael Hall, Mel Gibson, Whoopi Goldberg, Alfre Woodard, Woody Harrelson, Holly Hunter, Kenneth Branagh, Jodie Foster, Annette Bening, Val Kilmer, Jamie Foxx, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Alden Ehrenreich, Susan Downey… Now why have I added my wife’s name to this list of otherwise super talented artists that I’ve learned so much from up close over these last 40 years? It’s because for 22 years she has flawlessly portrayed a sane and rational individual who is happily married to an actor.”

Downey Jr. was nominated alongside Sterling K. Brown (American Fiction), Willem Dafoe (Poor Things), Robert De Niro (Killers of the Flower Moon) and Ryan Gosling (Barbie).

Downey Jr. has swept the awards circuit this season, having won previous accolades that include a Golden Globe, a BAFTA and a Critics Choice award. He is also nominated for an Academy Award. If he wins, it would be his first Oscar win — he was previously nominated for 1993’s Chaplin and 2009’s Tropic Thunder.
