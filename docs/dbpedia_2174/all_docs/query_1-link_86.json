        "text": "MATERIALS AND METHODS\n\nSampling.\n\nTwo locations on two different islands in the Baltic Sea in southeast Sweden were sampled: the Ottenby Bird Observatory (56°12′N, 16°24′E) on the southernmost point of Öland Island (15 March to 15 November 2000) and the coastal shore of the southern tip of Gotland Island (April 2000). Passerine birds were trapped with mistnets and Helgoland traps (5), and shorebirds were trapped with Ottenby funnel traps (5). Captured birds were banded, weighed, and measured, and their ages were determined according to differences in feather shapes and extents of wear (3, 28, 33). Three different approaches were used to obtain fecal samples, depending on the sizes of the trapped birds. Smaller birds were put one by one into a dark box with a clean sheet of paper at the bottom. Large birds, i.e., those with a body mass exceeding 250 g, were sampled by insertion of a sterile swab 1 to 2 cm into the cloaca. Samples from barnacle geese were taken by collecting fresh droppings from geese flocks grazing at the coastal meadows on Gotland Island. Sterile cotton swabs were used to collect fecal material from fresh goose droppings. Care was taken not to touch the surrounding grass. Samples were placed individually into a charcoal transport medium (Transwab; BioDisc, Solna, Sweden) and stored at 4 to 8°C for 2 to 7 days until cultivation.\n\nIsolation and identification.\n\nSamples were cultivated at the laboratory of the Department of Food and Environmental Hygiene at the University of Helsinki, Finland. Before direct plating, 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (supplemented with 1% mannitol and 0.15% bile salts according to International Organization for Standardization protocol ISO/DIS 10273) enrichment broth was added to each tube containing fecal samples. For cold enrichment, the tubes with the supplemented saline were incubated at 4°C and studied after 7, 14, and 21 days. For alkali treatment, 0.5 ml of the sample was mixed with 4.5 ml of 0.25% KOH solution for 20 s before being streaked onto CIN agar (Yersinia-selective agar base; Oxoid, Basingstoke, United Kingdom). This method was used after 7, 14, and 21 days of cold enrichment. CIN agar plates were used to isolate Yersinia, and these plates were incubated at 30°C for 18 to 20 h. To recover Y. pseudotuberculosis, a further incubation of the agar plates at 22°C for 24 h was used. Up to five whole small (diameter, <1 mm) colonies with typical a bull's eye appearance (deep red centers surrounded by outer transparent zones) on each CIN agar plate were taken and streaked onto blood agar plates for pure culture. One colony from the blood agar was inoculated onto a urea agar slant (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) and incubated for 24 h at 30°C. Isolates showing urea hydrolysis were further identified by using the Api 20E test (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).\n\nPutative Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were further biotyped according to results of reactions with raffinose, melibiose, and citrate (35). Y. enterocolitica isolates were biotyped based on assessment of the following criteria: pyrazinamidase (PYZ) and Tween-esterase activity; esculin hydrolysis; salicin, xylose, and trehalose acidification; and indole production (37). Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica isolates were serotyped with slide agglutination by using a commercial serum agglutination test with O:1 to O:6 and O:3, O:5, and O:9 antisera (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan), respectively.\n\nVirulence-associated tests.\n\nThe virulence plasmids of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica isolates were studied with a PCR targeting the virF gene on the plasmids by following the modified protocol of Nakajima et al. (25). Briefly, five colonies from blood agar were suspended in 100 μl of water in one tube. DNA was extracted by boiling of the suspension for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at full speed (16,000 × g) for 3 min. Two microliters of the supernatant was used as a template in the PCR. The PCR mixture volume was 50 μl, and the mixture contained 1 U of Dynazyme DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 200 μM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates (Finnzymes), and 0.3 μM (each) primers (Pharmacia Biotech, Vantaa, Finland). PCR was performed in a 16-well PTC-150 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, Mass.). The thermal profile procedure consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 60 s followed by 29 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 60 s, and extension at 72°C for 2 min. After completion of the cyclic reactions, a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min was added. The sizes of the amplified PCR products were determined in a 0.8% agarose gel (size, 19.5 by 20 cm; 80 V for 120 min) by comparison with DNA molecular weight marker VI (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany). Virulence characteristics of Y. enterocolitica—i.e., reactions of PYZ, esculin, salicin (37), and calcium dependence and Congo red absorption on Congo red-magnesium oxalate agar (CR-MOX) (30)—were also tested. On CR-MOX agar, the pYV-positive Yersinia isolates produced small orange colonies (CR-MOX positive) and negative isolates produced large colorless colonies (CR-MOX negative) when incubated at 37°C for 24 h.\n\nPFGE.\n\nDNA extraction was performed according to the method of Niskanen et al. (27). Briefly, a single colony grown on blood agar was inoculated into 5 ml of tryptic soy broth and incubated for 18 h at room temperature. The cells from 2 ml of tryptic soy broth were washed once in 5 ml of cold PIV (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 M NaCl) and then resuspended in 750 μl of cold PIV. Next, 0.5 ml of cell suspension was mixed with 0.5 ml of 2% (wt/vol) low-melting-temperature agarose (InCert agarose; BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, Maine) and cast in GelSyringe dispensers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, Mass.). The plugs were lysed at 37°C with shaking for 3 h in 2.5 ml of lysis solution (6 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 1 M NaCl, 100 mM EDTA [pH 7.5], 0.5% Brij-58, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% sodium lauroyl sarcosine, 20 μg of RNase/ml, 1 mg of lysozyme/ml) and completed with a 1-h ESP (0.5 M EDTA [pH 8.0], 10% sodium lauroyl sarcosine, 100 μg of pronase/ml) wash at 50°C. The plugs were stored at 4°C in fresh ESP solution. Before digestion, pronase was inactivated with Pefablock SC (AEBSF; Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Restriction endonuclease digestion was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA of Y. enterocolitica was digested with NotI enzyme (New England Biolabs). In addition, 10 isolates of Y. enterocolitica bioserotype 3/O:3 were also digested with SpeI enzyme (New England Biolabs). The Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were digested both with NotI and with SpeI separately, and up to five different colonies from each positive bird were taken as replicates. The samples were electrophoresed at 12°C through a 1% (wt/vol) agarose gel (SeaKem Gold; FMC Bioproducts) in a 0.5× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (Amresco, Solon, Ohio) at 200 V by using a Gene Navigator system (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) with a hexagonal electrode. Interpolation protocols with ranges from 1 to 18 s for 20 h for NotI and from 1 to 15 s for 18 h for SpeI were used. A midrange PFGE marker (New England Biolabs) was used for fragment size determination. The gels were stained for 30 min in 1 liter of running buffer containing 50 μl of ethidium bromide (10 mg/ml) and photographed under UV light with an Alpha Imager 2000 documentation system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, Calif.) by following standard procedures. For determination of NotI and SpeI profiles, the banding patterns were interpreted visually. Profiles were considered to be different when a one-band difference was observed.\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe analyzed the occurrence of Yersinia spp. in 468 samples representing 57 different species of birds. In total, Yersinia spp. were isolated from 12.8% of all samples collected (Table ). The most frequently encountered species was Y. enterocolitica (isolated from 5.6% of all collected fecal samples), followed by Y. intermedia (3.8%), Y. frederiksenii (3.0%), Y. kristensenii (0.9%), Y. pseudotuberculosis (0.6%), and Y. rohdei (0.4%). Most isolated strains appeared in the spring migration sample set; only five Yersinia isolates were obtained during the autumn sampling. Further, the autumn samples consisted of only nonpathogenic strains: two strains of apathogenic Y. enterocolitica biotype 1A, two strains of Y. frederiksenii, and one Y. intermedia strain.\n\nTABLE 1.\n\nSpeciesLatin nameNo. testedNo. witha: YersiniaYPYEYIYFYKYRBarnacle gooseBranta leucopsis10542−19151211RobinErithacus rubecula51−−−−−−−BlackbirdTurdus merula434−2112−RedshankTringa totanus303−12−−−Song thrushTurdus philomelos2721−−−−1DunlinCalidris alpina251−1−−−−RedstartPhoenicurus phoenicurus222−1−1−−GoldcrestRegulus regulus13−−−−−−−Pied flycatcherFicedula hypoleuca10−−−−−−−Spotted flycatcherMuscicapa striata101−−−−1−Willow warblerPhylloscopus trochilus10−−−−−−−RedwingTurdus iliacus1022−−−−−RedpollCarduelis flammea9−−−−−−−Blue titParus caeruleus9−−−−−−−Brent gooseBranta bernicla7−−−−−−−Pied wagtailMotacilla alba6−−−−−−−Lesser whitethroatSylvia curruca6−−−−−−−BlackcapSylvia atricapilla51−1−−−−Red-backed shrikeLanius collurio4−−−−−−−Garden warblerSylvia borin4−−−−−−−Common whitethroatSylvia communis4−−−−−−−Reed warblerAcrocephalus scirpaceus31−−−−−1Rough-legged buzzardButeo lagopus31−1−−−−JackdawCorvus monedula3−−−−−−−ChiffchaffPhylloscopus collybita3−−−−−−−BullfinchPyrrhula pyrrhula3−−−−−−−WrenTroglodytes troglodytes3−−−−−−−Sparrow hawkAccipiter nisus2−−−−−−−Sedge warblerAcrocephalus schoenobaenus2−−−−−−−Tree pipitAnthus trivialis2−−−−−−−SiskinCarduelis spinus2−−−−−−−CuckooCuculus canorus2−−−−−−−BluethroatLuscinia svecica2−−−−−−−Great titParus major2−−−−−−−StarlingSturnus vulgaris2−−−−−−−Barred warblerSylvia nisoria2−−−−−−−FieldfareTurdus pilaris2−−−−−−−Marsh warblerAcrocephalus palustris1−−−−−−−Common sandpiperActites hypoleucos1−−−−−−−MallardAnas platyrhynchos1−−−−−−−Greylag gooseAnser anser1−−−−−−−Short-eared owlAsio flammeus1−−−−−−−Long-eared owlAsio otus1−−−−−−−Canada gooseBranta canadensis1−−−−−−−Scarlet rosefinchCarpodacus erythrinus1−−−−−−−Tree-creeperCerthia familiaris1−−−−−−−Mute swanCygnus olor1−−−−−−−House martinDelichon urbica1−−−−−−−Great spotted woodpeckerDendrocopus major1−−−−−−−Ortolan buntingEmberiza hortulana1−−−−−−−Reed buntingEmberiza schoeniclus1−−−−−−−CraneGrus grus1−−−−−−−Icterine warblerHippolais icterina1−−−−−−−Herring gullLarus argentatus1−−−−−−−Yellow wagtailMotacilla flava1−−−−−−−Grey ploverPluvialis squatarola1−−−−−−−ShelduckTadorna tadorna1−−−−−−−Total57 species46860326181443\n\nThe three Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were obtained from three birds belonging to two species of thrushes, song thrush (Turdus philomelos) and redwing (Turdus iliacus), sampled during the spring migration in April. Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were of bioserotype 1/O:2, and no variation in their biochemical characteristics was present (Table ). When virulence-associated properties of the strains were examined on CR-MOX agar plates, all of the strains showed calcium dependence and Congo red absorption. Moreover, all strains were virF-positive on PCR. The isolates of Y. pseudotuberculosis from the two bird species yielded two different PFGE profiles with both the NotI and the SpeI enzymes (Fig. ), and this difference was consistent also when multiple Y. pseudotuberculosis colonies from the same bird were studied, meaning that the redwing and the song thrush isolates belonged to different Y. pseudotuberculosis genotypes.\n\nTABLE 2.\n\nBiotype/serotypeaNo. of positive birdsSalicinEsculinPYZCR-MOXbvirFY. pseudotuberculosis 1/O:23++−++Y. enterocolitica 3/O:32−−−++ 3/O:38−−−−− 3/NT9−−−−− 1A/O:31+++−− 1A/NT3+++−− 1A/O:53+++−− NT/NT3−−+−−\n\nIn bird species of which more than 10 individuals were sampled, the carriage of Y. enterocolitica varied from 0 to 18%, with the highest frequency observed in barnacle geese (Branta leucopsis) (Table ). Of the 29 Y. enterocolitica isolates, 10 belonged to bioserotype 3/O:3, three belonged to 1A/O:5, and one belonged to 1A/O:3. The rest of the isolates did not belong to any known bioserotype combination (Table ). Ten of the Y. enterocolitica isolates, all isolated from barnacle geese, belonged to bioserotype 3/O:3, a bioserotype associated with human disease. Two of these bioserotype 3/O:3 strains were found to be virF positive; thus, they carried the virulence plasmid. Furthermore, these isolates were PYZ negative and CR-MOX positive (Table ). The virF-negative isolates of Y. enterocolitica bioserotype 3/O:3 were recovered from nine birds, all of which were barnacle geese. NotI enzyme digestion differentiated the 29 Y. enterocolitica isolates by producing 21 restriction patterns. The 10 isolates of bioserotype 3/O:3 corresponded to four NotI profiles (Fig. ) and four SpeI profiles.\n\nA total of 17 Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were recovered after cold enrichment for 7, 14, or 21 days. However, when cold enrichment was combined with alkali treatment, 34 isolates were recovered. Four indistinguishable isolates of Y. pseudotuberculosis from one bird sample were found after direct plating. The virF-positive strains of Y. enterocolitica were isolated after a 1-week cold enrichment, followed by KOH treatment. Of the bioserotype 3/O:3 isolates, 1 and 11 were recovered after direct plating and cold enrichment, respectively.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe occurrence of Yersinia spp. among birds in this study was comparatively high, nearly 13%, and there can be no doubt that these bacteria are present in wild birds migrating through Sweden. As most of the sampled individuals were caught during active migration, the occurrence of Yersinia in samples from Öland and Gotland does not necessarily reflect the local situation in southeast Sweden. Depending on the time elapsed between colonization and excretion of the bacteria in feces and on the speed of migration of the birds, the samples may mirror the occurrence some distance away along the migratory route. As the birds sampled during the spring migration (at least all passerine birds caught at Ottenby Bird Observatory) were often caught just hours after reaching Sweden, colonized birds likely acquired the bacteria while on their wintering grounds or during the migratory journey. In our data set, there was a skewed ratio, with far more isolates obtained during spring migration than during autumn migration, and all strains of pathogenic Yersinia spp. were gathered during the spring. In interpreting results, however, one should note that the distributions of host species from which material was sampled differed between the two seasons, with some species, such as the barnacle goose, being sampled only during spring migration and others being sampled only during autumn migration, and that the number of sampled individuals was low for many species.\n\nMost isolated Yersinia strains belonged to nonpathogenic species, namely Y. intermedia, Y. frederiksenii, Y. kristensenii, Y. rohdei, and nonpathogenic strains of Y. enterocolitica. These species have never been associated with human disease, they do not carry pYV, and the public health risk stemming from these bacteria is considered to be low. Nonpathogenic Yersinia have previously been isolated from birds, other animals, and the environment in various numbers (4, 6, 22), and differences in isolation rates can be found among different bird species in different areas (11, 23). In our study, the only frequently colonized species was the barnacle goose, of which 38% of the sampled individuals were Yersinia positive (Table ).\n\nApart from the nonpathogenic strains, we also managed to isolate a few pathogenic Yersinia—three virF-positive Y. pseudotuberculosis strains and two virF-positive Y. enterocolitica strains. The strains of Y. pseudotuberculosis came from thrushes, two from song thrushes and one from a redwing, and all were retrieved during spring migration in April. Individuals of these bird species, as reflected by recoveries of banded birds trapped at Ottenby Bird Observatory, spend the nonbreeding season in Western Europe, in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Holland, and Belgium. All Y. pseudotuberculosis strains were of bioserotype 1/O:2. Serotype O:2 is one of the two serotypes, the other being serotype O:1, most commonly isolated from birds in Europe, the United States, and Canada. These serotypes are typically found in healthy birds but have also been reported to cause disease in both birds and humans (6, 14, 18, 34). Though serotype O:1 has been regarded as one of the most important causes of sporadic human infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis in Europe and has been associated with several outbreaks of yersiniosis, serotype O:2 also has been reported to be associated with human yersiniosis in different countries in Europe (1, 29, 34). The Y. pseudotuberculosis strains showed similar biochemical characteristics, and they all carried the virF gene on their plasmids. PFGE analysis with the NotI and SpeI enzymes divided the strains on the basis of two restriction patterns (Fig. ). Both strains from the song thrushes clustered together and were different from the strain found in the redwing, indicating different origins of colonizing Y. pseudotuberculosis strains.\n\nSeven different bird species, representing five different bird families (Table ), were found to carry Y. enterocolitica. In previous studies, differences in the rates of detection of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica depending on host species have been observed, with the former more frequently isolated from passerine birds and psittaciformes while the latter has typically been isolated from birds with larger body masses (7, 14, 32). Our data were consistent with this pattern; Y. enterocolitica was most frequently isolated from barnacle geese (Table ). Ten of the Y. enterocolitica isolates, all isolated from barnacle geese, belonged to bioserotype 3/O:3, which is associated with human disease. Two of these strains were found to be virF positive; thus, they carried the virulence plasmid. While the other eight isolates were virF negative, they should still be considered to be potentially pathogenic to humans, since accidental loss of the plasmid during isolation procedures is possible. To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of the isolation of this bioserotype from birds. Bioserotype 3/O:3 is prevalent among humans in the Far East and has been recovered from pork and chicken meat samples in Japan (12). Four of the remaining isolates of Y. enterocolitica belonged to the nonpathogenic bioserotypes 1A/O:3 and 1A/O:5, which have never been associated with human infections. The rest of the 15 Y. enterocolitica isolates did not belong to any known bioserotype combination (Table ). Pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains are negative for PYZ activity, esculin hydrolysis, and salicin acidification (37). The virulence characteristics differentiated virF-positive Y. enterocolitica strains from nonpathogenic Y. enterocolitica 1A strains (Table ). Twenty-one different NotI restriction patterns were observed with Y. enterocolitica isolates. The most common NotI profile was N9, detected in samples from seven individuals—all barnacle geese. Three birds were found to carry more than one strain of Y. enterocolitica.\n\nAll samples from which Yersinia spp. were isolated in this study came from apparently healthy individuals, which has also been the case in several other studies (6, 10, 13). Y. pseudotuberculosis is a pathogen frequently observed among zoo birds and domestic fowl in connection with both outbreaks and sporadic cases of infection and is recognized to cause severe clinical symptoms and sudden death in different bird species (36, 38; Harcourt-Brown, Vet. Rec. 102:315, 1978). Perhaps wild birds are less affected by Y. pseudotuberculosis or maintain the infection at a low but latent level, developing acute clinical illness only under stressful conditions, e.g., starvation, cold temperatures, and migration.\n\nConventional isolation methods used in recovery of Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica seem to be rather insensitive, and recovery rates are low (7, 9). Isolation of Y. pseudotuberculosis appears to be more efficient when sampling is from necropsy material instead of fecal material (7). Y. pseudotuberculosis isolates were best found after cold enrichment that was followed by KOH treatment. This has previously been shown to be the most successful method for the isolation of Y. pseudotuberculosis from clinical and environment samples with low levels of bacteria (27). The small amount of Y. pseudotuberculosis in samples makes it difficult to isolate the bacterium without enrichment since it is easily overgrown by other bacteria, including Pseudomonas, Citrobacter, Serratia, and other Yersinia spp. This could explain why Y. pseudotuberculosis was isolated only from samples in which no other Yersinia species was present. In addition, cold enrichment has been found to increase the recovery of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains compared with direct plating, but it also selects for nonpathogenic Y. enterocolitica strains in stool cultures (24). Our figures should thus be seen as the minimum occurrence of pathogenic Yersinia spp. in these wild birds.\n\nHuman infection with Y. pseudotuberculosis is suspected to be primarily associated with consumption of food or unchlorinated water contaminated by wild animal wastes (10). In this investigation, we show that birds caught during migration in Sweden may be infected with virF-positive Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica. Birds are also commonly colonized by nonpathogenic Yersinia spp. The finding of virF-positive Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica in bird feces indicates that wild birds cannot be excluded from the epidemiological discussion of human yersiniosis. However, the low isolation rate of virF-positive Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica suggests that birds are unlikely to be a direct source of Yersinia infections in humans. These results provide the first knowledge on the occurrence of these largely unknown human pathogens in migratory birds in Europe and may be regarded as one step toward unraveling their epidemiology."
