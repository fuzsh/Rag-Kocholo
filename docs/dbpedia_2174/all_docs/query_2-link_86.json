We have seen nesting birds and new chicks making the most of the gorgeous sunny days.\n\nBarnacle geese and their babies.\n\nOne parent on the nest and the other keeping guard.\n\nBeside the nesting seagull is a ball of fluff.\n\nI have never seen a baby seagull before.\n\nThere were 2 slightly older ones nearby.\n\nA Barnacle goose had her nest in the middle of a public beach.\n\nThis bird was just resting I think.\n\nLearning to swim.\n\nProud parents.\n\nThis couple was not bothered by people at all, but when a dog came to close it was a different story.\n\nProtecting their babies.\n\nThe ducks have babies too.\n\nAsleep in the shade.\n\nThe white duck is still here.\n\nIt is great to see new life everywhere. The birds are quite comfortable near people and go about their daily lives in peace."
