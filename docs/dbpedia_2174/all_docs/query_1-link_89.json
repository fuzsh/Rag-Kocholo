        "text": "Helsinki\n\nThe Singing Seagulls is rock'n'roll group by a bunch of friends who practice and perform good old rhythm music to make your feet tap. We mostly play covers and follow the musical footsteps of the likes of The Beatles, Rolling Stones, Dire Straits, Hurriganes and Elvis. With our first track \"Emmalle lauantaimakkara\" we are taking our first steps in writing original music too. We're open for gigging, especially in the metropolitan area of Helsinki. #lokkirokki\n\nThe Singing Seagullsâs tracks\n\nEmmalle lauantaimakkara by The Singing Seagulls\n\npublished on 2018-06-24T18:52:45Z"
