        "text": "Damn Seagulls\n\nDamn Seagulls, the rock band from Helsinki, has come back to life. And what a cracking revival this has been! Out of the blue, the band published the magnificent single Hold Your Head Up High that is quite possibly the greatest composition of their entire career. The fourth album Let It Shine will be published in May and in the summer, Damn Seagulls will tour in Finland spreading the joy of soul rock.\n\nHold Your Head Up High presents a band that sounds ever so ageless. The beat of the songs and their brass background resonate the vehemence of Stax-soul, and the pleasant melodies bear a resemblance to the mellow sound of the Swedish band The Solution. The walloping line-up work in unison and support the intensely deep voice of the singer Eloranta. Damn Seagulls have calmed down since the boisterous years of their debut album, but they still are no choirboys. This band will surely provide its audience with fierce energy and rock'n'roll!\n\nwww.damnseagulls.com\n\nfacebook.com/damnseagulls"
