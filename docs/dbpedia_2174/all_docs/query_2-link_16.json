It was cold and raining, but in a brief gap between showers I headed off on my walk and was rewarded with several beautiful bird sightings, including these gorgeous barnacle geese with their babies.\n\nI don’t know what the other birds are but they are very cute.\n\nThis one decided to take a little nap.\n\nThere was a lone duckling out for a swim.\n\nThis one was tired too.\n\nThere were a couple of swans on the water for the afternoon.\n\nIt is great to see so much wildlife so close to a big city. The birds are quite tame and don’t seem at all bothered by people.\n\nThe next day the weather was better so I went back. There were no babies, I hope they were asleep in their nests. The adult birds were practising standing on one leg.\n\nOthers were resting.\n\nAnd this one was preening."
