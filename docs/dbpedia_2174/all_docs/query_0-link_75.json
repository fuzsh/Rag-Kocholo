        "text": "Finland is a member of the Schengen Agreement, so check schengenvisainfo.com for details on various types of visas you may need. To enter and travel around Finland, U.S. citizens are required to have an approved ETIAS visa waiver. In addition, you may enter for up to 90 days for tourist purposes without a visa. For more details on travel into and within Schengen countries, please see the Schengen fact sheet.\n\nLapland is well serviced by train. Travelers can choose to ride overnight from Helsinki, where they have the option to stay in coach or sleeping-car compartments. For a complete list of schedules, check VR Railway.\n\nTwo of the main bus services include Matkahuolto and Onnibus which will deliver you in maximum comfort. Additionally, many of the major airports have minibuses meet arriving flights in order to transport passengers to their hotels in town centers.\n\nWe highly recommend hiring a driver or renting a car to better explore the region. Check this article for more information on driving in Finland. These four rental companies are most common: Scancar , Hertz , Sixt , & Europcar. Check Viator Private Tours to compare the best private drivers in the area.\n\nIn addition, taxis are available in most towns, especially in the Lapland capital of Rovaniemi.\n\nLapland is extremely safe for travelers, especially for female solo travelers. It remains part of the least dangerous country on Earth, which was also recently rated the happiest worldwide. However, you should always follow normal travel rules, and guard your bags, wallets and other personal effects. The Finns are extremely friendly, so anytime you feel like you‚Äôre in danger or need help, locals will be more than willing to assist.\n\nFinland also ranks one of the first in reliable police services. The average pickup time for emergency calls is 5 seconds. To get a hold of police, fire and ambulance services while visiting Lapland, be sure to be sure to contact the emergency number 112.\n\nThe weather in Lapland ranges from subarctic to continental, with mild summer days and icy, snow-filled winters.\n\nThe peak travel season is between December and February, where the temperature ranges from about ‚Äì 16 ¬∞C (3 ¬∞F) to 3 ¬∞C (37 ¬∞F) on average.\n\nSnow cover comprises around 175 ‚Äì 225 days in a given year, and usually falls between mid-October and mid-May.\n\nDuring the winter season, daylight lasts on average between 10 and 2 PM.\n\nShort daylight hours in the winter months create ideal conditions for viewing the northern lights, which are best seen between November and March.\n\nFor more information on what to expect in terms of weather, as well as what to pack, check Nordic Visitor.\n\nThere are two official languages of Finland. Finnish is the first, spoken by 93% of the country‚Äôs 5 million inhabitants.\n\nThe second official language, Swedish, is spoken by around 6% of the population, most of whom live in the southwest.\n\nS√°mi is a minority language in the Nordic countries which is spoken by around 2,000 people in the north of Finland, making up about 0.03% of the population.\n\nHere are a few basic words and phrases to learn:\n\nHello = Hei (pronounced ‚Äúhey‚Äù)\n\nGoodbye = Hei Hei(‚Äúhey hey‚Äù)\n\nYes = Kyll√§(ku‚Äìyu-la)\n\nNo = Ei (pronounced like the letter ‚Äúa‚Äù)\n\nThank you = Kiitos\n\nYou are welcome = Ei kest√§\n\nExcuse me = Anteeksi(sounds like ‚Äúaun-taxi‚Äù)\n\nMy name is ‚Ä¶ = Nimeni on ‚Ä¶ (‚Äúknee-many on‚Äù)\n\nNice to meet you = Hauska tavata\n\nHotel = Hotelli\n\nAirport = Lentokentt√§\n\nTrain = Juna\n\nBus = Bussi\n\nSubway = Metro\n\nTicket = Lippu(‚Äúleap-o‚Äù)\n\nLapland is easy to visit. Customs and manners are clearly European, with only a few national variations, and attitudes are liberal.\n\nThere is a greater sense of equality between the sexes, as can be seen in the relatively high number of women holding advanced positions in politics and other areas of society. Chauvinistic attitudes towards women are generally considered unacceptable.\n\nWhen greeting one another, Finns shake hands and make eye contact. Handshakes are brief and firm, and involve no supporting gestures. Embracing people when greeting them is rare.\n\nBoth men and women bathe in the sauna, but never together except within the family. There are no mixed public saunas in Finland. A visitor hesitant to try a sauna should remember that if it has been heated specially for him or her, it is a matter of pride for the hosts, and only medical constraints are an acceptable reason for not trying it.\n\nThere are plenty of ATMs‚Äîespecially in cities‚Äîand most machines will accept cards issued by major international banks.\n\nUS, UK and Australian cards are widely accepted in Finnish hotels, restaurants, stores and markets.\n\nVisa, Mastercard and Maestro are most common, and American Express is accepted in most places as well.\n\nAs a rule, service is included in restaurant bills. Therefore, tipping has never fitted very comfortably into the Finnish way of life. You can feel safe that while nobody will object, very few will mind not being tipped.\n\nIn addition to being optimally safe and happy, Lapland happens to be one of the most gay-friendly places on the map.\n\nHomosexuality has been decriminalized in Finland since 1971, and gay marriage has been legal since 2017, so most of the locals are accepting of the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nFor added assurance, though, you can look for Gay Travel Finland‚Äôs We Speak Gay certification, which is granted only to companies that have proven to be inclusive to LGBTQ+ customers."
