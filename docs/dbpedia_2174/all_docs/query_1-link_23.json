Genre picture. Antti Hämäläinen/Lehtikuva\n\nDan Pettersson\n\n07.07.2023 09:42 UPDATED 07.07.2023 10:14\n\nEarlier this week, the Åland regional government issued a warning to the islands' residents: Do not touch dead birds. The reason was that bird flu was found in dead eiders.\n\nIn June, for the first time, mass death among birds was confirmed in Finland. That after a shock of dead seagulls was found in Salo. Down on the continent, similar cases of mass death have been confirmed in the spring.\n\nAnother 100 or so laughing gulls and terns were found dead near Tavastehus on 25 June. The bird carcasses, both young and adult individuals, have been collected, tested and destroyed.\n\nAccording to the Swedish Food Agency, the cause of death is highly pathogenic, i.e. very disease-causing, bird flu of the H5N1 type. At the same time, the authority reminds of the importance of infection protection. The disease spreads easily between birds and caution must be observed, reads the order.​..\n\nTranslation Google\n\nBird flu detected in a wild bird in Mikkeli\n\n21/08/2023\n\nA laughing gull that died of bird flu has been found in Mikkeli. The bird was found on the roof of the main library in the city of Mikkeli, and the samples were sent to the Food Agency for examination on August 10, 2023. On Monday afternoon, August 21, 2023, it was confirmed that it is a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus.\n\nThis is the first case in Eastern Finland. So far, bird flu has been detected primarily in Western Finland in the Ostrobothnia region, in Päijät-Hämee in Lahti and Hämeenlinna, and in the north at the height of Rovaniemi. About a thousand laughing seagulls have died in Lahti, and there have been individual seagulls that have died of avian flu elsewhere as well. In addition, bird flu has been found in, among other things, sea eagles, gray gulls, Canada geese and eiders, as well as occasional terns in Finland.\n\nThere were four dead laughing gulls on the roof of Mikkeli's main library, but only one of them could be examined.\n\nSince avian influenza has been found in wild birds, no restriction zones are imposed in the area, and the outdoor keeping of poultry is not prohibited.\n\nThe type of virus found does not easily infect humans.\n\nThe Food Agency recommends that waterfowl should not be hunted in the vicinity where bird flu has occurred. Since the dead laughing seagull was found on the roof of Mikkeli's main library, according to the regional veterinarian of the Eastern Finland Regional Administration, the discovery does not cause recommendations for restrictions on waterfowl hunting, because there is no hunting in the Urban Area.\n\nMikkeli region's environmental services hopes that birds found dead will be reported to control veterinarians or city veterinarians. Dead birds should not be touched without protection.\n\nThe management team for disruption situations monitors the situation and the management team gives instructions if necessary.\n\n​https://mikkeli.fi/2023/08/21/lintui...sa-mikkelissa/"
