        "text": "Finally, I have time to write about out trip to Helsinki. I believe that everybody thah have been there, loved something about it. The only thing that is not for me is the weather. I'm a child of the sun! Can't stand the cold, my theory is that it should be cold only for a month, you know, for the winter celebrations.\n\nAnyways, everything happened 2 months ago. I had given my boyfriend tickets for his favorite band's concert in Helsinki for our anniversary. This ment we have to plan our trip. We decided to go by train. And bus. And the ferry. Yeah, a long, long 96-hour journey. Going there, we didn't have enough time to take photos but I promise, the way back is way more developed.\n\nMy mom and her boyfriend drove us to Budapest. The only thing we saw there was the train station. But that was actually enough for me because the building was beautiful. It was so hot. So we decided to waste our 2 hours in front of it, drinking local beer.\n\nAround 20:00 we took the train to Warsaw. We ate cherries with two polish guys and slept most of the time. We should have arrived in Warsaw at 07:30 am but the train had 3 hours delay. Now I'm waiting for my refund. Well, if I had to be honest, one of my least favorite cities I have ever been was Warsaw. I guess we didn't managed to see the best parts of it. We walked around because our bus to Tallin was at 11:30 p.m. Yeeeah, we had a lot of time on our hands. We wandered around the city, the weather was pretty bad so we didn't have a lot to do. We visited some parks and ended on the bus station. We got on the bus which was the longest ride of my life. 12 hours to Villnius, 2 hours there and 10 hours to Tallin. Oh my...did my feet get swollen. You don't want to know. My right ankle looked like it was broken.\n\nWe didn't have much time in Tallin because we had to catch the ferry. This is my favorite part of the trips to Helsinki when I'm not flying. We were on the port at 10 p.m. It's like it was noon. The sun was shining. Nothing strange there.\n\nAfter 2 hours in the ferry we finally arrived in Helsinki at sunset. It was 11 p.m. Yes, 11 in the evening. You got it right. Anyways, we were dirty, tired and with swollen ankles. We went to the apartment and fell asleep immediately. That was the trip to Helsinki. Wait for the rest."
