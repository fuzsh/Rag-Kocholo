        "text": "When we first started planning our trip to Helsinki we had about a week’s worth of things to see. Then time being what it is, i.e. precious, we had to cut that down, so that we could see all the other amazing places on our Nordic Road Trip, and so we ended up with 2 days in Helsinki, and we had to plan around that. However, we did manage to visit during the long summer days of June, so seemingly endless daylight means that you can see way more, and stay out for longer. Here’s an epic Helsinki 2 day itinerary.\n\nTHIS POST MAY CONTAIN COMPENSATED AND AFFILIATE LINKS MORE INFORMATION IN OUR DISCLAIMER\n\nPractical Considerations for Visiting Helsinki\n\nOur Helsinki 2 day itinerary is packed, but also easy to do if you have a weekend in Helsinki, or even better if you come mid-week, as there will be fewer people visiting the places that you’ll be going to. This is also designed as a 2 day in Helsinki in summer itinerary. Winter here is a very different proposition. However, that said, you’ll need to plan to make the most of your time in Helsinki. where you’re here for one day, two, or longer. Here’s what you’ll need to organize before you arrive.\n\nArriving in Helsinki\n\nYou’ll arrive in Helsinki in one of three ways. Most people will arrive here by plane at the airport, but there’s also a ferry that comes here from both Stockholm, Sweden, and also from Tallinn, Estonia. I’ll cover those options too. And then finally, you could arrive by car from elsewhere in the country, like we did (we came from Turku, Finland’s oldest city, and my guide to Turku is here)\n\nHelsinki Airport to Helsinki\n\nIt’s about 32 kilometers (20 miles) from Helsinki Airport (HEL) to the center of Helsinki. It takes about 30-45 minutes to travel by car, which is the quickest way to get to the center. You can rent cars from Helsinki Airport, but I recommend taking a transfer, and if you need a car later in your trip, then rent it later. You won’t need a car to get around Helsinki, it will be more of a hindrance than a help. Book an airport transfer from Helsinki Airport to Helsinki here.\n\nYou can also take the train from Helsinki Airport to the center of Helsinki. You can buy your train tickets on the HSL website here and you’ll want either the I or the P trains and they take about 30 minutes. You can also buy tickets from the machine at the train platform. You’ll need a ticket for zones ABC and a single ticket will cost 4,10 €\n\nIf you prefer to take the bus, then you’ll want bus number 600, and it takes about 40 minutes. Again buy tickets on HSL’s website or at the ticket machine at the bus station.\n\nHelsinki Ferry Port to Helsinki\n\nFerries from Tallinn and Stockholm arrive in Helsinki at different terminals, however, both are relatively close to the city center. If you’re coming on the ferry from Tallinn to Helsinki, then you’ll arrive at the Länsisatama (West Harbour), Terminal 2 in Helsinki. It’s connected by trams and buses, or you can take a taxi to where you’re staying in Helsinki.\n\nIf you’re coming from Stockholm on the ferry, then you’ll arrive at the Olympia Terminal (I’ve marked it on the map for you). You can take a tram or a bus from here, or a taxi.\n\nArriving in Helsinki by Car\n\nThere are no toll roads in Finland – unlike Norway and Sweden – but you’ll need to ensure that if you’re staying in Helsinki with a car that you have parking arranged. This site details all the parking areas and parking prices for parking in Helsinki.\n\nWhere to stay in Helsinki for 2 days\n\nWith just two days in Helsinki, you’ll want to stay somewhere central to maximize your time in the city. I recommend the Scandic Helsinki Hub – it is in a great location for exploring the city, has private parking if you are driving, but is also close to transit links. A note on accommodation in Finland – decent quality, well-priced places to stay book REALLY quickly, so please, get the best price by booking early. We booked all our Finnish accommodation about 2 months before our trip.\n\nIf you struggle to find somewhere central, then Helsinki has a great public transit system, so you can even stay a distance further out, but remember you’ll be taking public transport for perhaps 30 minutes each way. The Forenom Aparthotel or the Noli both at Herttoniemi are good value, with self-catering kitchens, and are very close to the Herttoniemi train line, which is an easy commute into central Helsinki\n\nGetting around Helsinki\n\nIf you’re driving, then the best thing that you can do when you arrive in Helsinki is to park up and leave the car. Helsinki’s public transit system is EXCELLENT. It’s called the HSL and comprises buses, trams, metros, trains and ferries. Single tickets are valid for a set period of time and you can even transfer between transport modes so long as your time period is still valid. Day tickets are great value and you can also buy multi-day tickets for up to 13 days. Read the HSL site here for more details.\n\nHowever, that doesn’t mean you’re going to spend all your time in Helsinki on a bus or metro, far from it. The attractions in the center are very, very walkable, and if the weather for you is as glorious as it was for us, then it’s an absolute delight to be out and wandering around.\n\nHow to spend 2 days in Helsinki\n\nRight, now that we’ve sorted out the details of getting here and getting around, let’s get down to it, shall we? How we’re going to spend 2 days in Helsinki and what there is to see here.\n\nDay 1 Itinerary for Helsinki\n\n2 days in Helsinki is a great amount of time to see the highlights of Finland’s capital city, in a relaxed fashion, and long enough to decide if you want to return. I’d love to come back in the winter and see the ice-breaking boats in action. But let’s not digress any longer.\n\nHave Breakfast at Story in the Old Market Hall in Helsinki\n\nIf your hotel (or aparthotel) doesn’t provide breakfast, then head to the Old Market Hall in Helsinki for a great breakfast to get you started on your Helsinki itinerary. Oatmeal might be the traditional breakfast here in Finland, but the Story café in the Old Market Hall has a huge variety of breakfast options. The Old Market Hall is open from 08:00.\n\nTake a Walking Tour of Helsinki\n\nThis is hands down the best way to explore Helsinki – taking a walking tour with a knowledgeable local guide. Like many other cities, Helsinki offers “free walking tours” – which are essentially tip-based. You can reserve a place here for a nominal amount. You’ll want to get the 10:30 am timeslot. And don’t worry about cash for a tip. Finland is one of the most cash-free places ever. You can tip with a card or via Paypal.\n\nIf that timeframe doesn’t suit you, and you’d prefer to have a tour that’s tailored specifically to your group, then book a private tour, and tailor it to your interests, and in the order that you’d prefer. Book this private tour, it gets superb ratings.\n\nWhether you take a walking tour or not, then you’re going to want to explore the highlights of Helsinki.\n\nExplore Helsinki’s Senate Square\n\nStarting your exploration of Helsinki in Senate Square is a great place to understand a little of the history of Finland and the city of Helsinki. The vast square is (almost) centered around a statute of Alexander II – known as Alexander the Liberator for his emancipation of Russia’s serfs in 1861, he was the Emperor of Russia, King of Congress Poland, and Grand Duke of Finland until his assassination in 1881. (he was assassinated in the hope that it would cause a revolution). Right, so there you are starting Finland’s history, with a statue of a Russian Emperor. A reminder, Finland wasn’t actually an independent country until 1917. (Go on, book that walking tour and you’ll learn about all this).\n\nThe square is built on what was originally a graveyard but was envisaged as the main square of the city in 1812 when Helsinki became the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland.\n\nThe square’s architecture comes from Carl Ludvig Engel (1778 – 1840) and is an example of Neoclassical architecture. There are four primary buildings that surround the square, the most distinctive of which is Helsinki Cathedral, which I’ll come to in a moment. The three other buildings that surround the square are the main building of the University of Helsinki, the National Library of Finland, and the Government Palace. You’ll also find Helsinki’s oldest stone building, the Sederholm House which contains the Helsinki City Museum.\n\nHelsinki Cathedral\n\nOriginally the Church of St Nicholas, (as a tribute to the Russian Tsar, Nicholas I), the Cathedral was finished in 1852, 12 years after its architect (Engels) died. The cathedral’s design is that of a Greek cross when looked at from above, it has a primary green dome and four smaller ones. It’s the most photographed place in Helsinki. The Cathedral is Lutheran, the primary religion in Finland. If there are no special events on you can enter the Cathedral.\n\nThe National Library of Finland\n\nFinland’s National Library is part of the University of Finland and this library is responsible for storing Finnish Cultural Heritage. It receives copies of all printed materials and AV materials, outside of films, that are either produced or distributed in Finland. They also collect and preserve digital materials in the Finnish Web Archive. Most of the collection of materials here are stored in an enormous solid rock Kirjaluola (Book Cave), which is 18 meters (59 feet) below the library. The interior of the library is a delight, with the booktower rotunda being the most spectacular part of this building which contains more than 109 kilometers (67 miles) of shelf space.\n\nThe Presidential Palace of Helsinki\n\nYou’ll just have to look at this building from the outside as Helsinki’s Government Palace is where the Finnish Prime Minister’s Office, the Chancellor of Justice, and the Ministry of Finance are found. It’s rarely open to the public.\n\nThese are the main buildings of Helsinki’s Senate Square and you can see where they are on our map of things to do in Helsinki, for our next stop, we’re going to take a slightly circuitous route to the Old Market Square in Helsinki, as we have a couple more stops yet.\n\nSee Helsinki’s Wise Mouse aka Viisas hiiri\n\nYou’ll find the Viisas hiiri, Helsinki’s Wise Mouse making notes on the stairs outside the National Archives of Helsinki. This sculpture, of a tiny mouse with a pencil comes from a series of art projects celebrating Helsinki as the European City of Culture in 2000. Now cut across on Snellmaninkatu pass a couple more Government buildings, and onto Kirkkokatu (Church Street), and walk towards the waterfront, taking a right when you get there.\n\nCheck out Helsinki’s Ice Breakers\n\nIn the distance you’ll likely see the large boats, these are Helsinki’s icebreaker boats. There are six icebreakers, which make their home on the Katajanokka peninsula near the Old Market Square. If you want to see them up close you can walk by on Merikasarmi Quay. Since the 1970’s these boats have moored up here, but in the winter they’re busy keeping the shipping lanes open along Finland’s coastline. You can read more about Finland’s fleet of icebreakers, including the Polaris, the newest (and most environmentally friendly) here.\n\nSee the Uspenski Cathedral\n\nBuilt to a completely different design to the Helsinki Cathedral is the red brick Uspenski Cathedral. This is Helsinki’s Eastern Orthodox Cathedral. It was built between 1862 and 1868 with funds from salt import taxes. It was Alexander I who required that 15% of these taxes would be set aside for the building of two churches, the Lutheran Helsinki Cathedral, and one for the Orthodox community. This is the Orthodox, Uspenski Cathedral. The bricks – and there are 700,000 of them – came from the Bomarsund Fortress, which had been demolished in the Crimean War of 1853-1856. The design and interior are significantly different from that of the Helsinki Cathedral.\n\nThe name Uspenski comes from the word “uspenie”, which is Old Church Slavonic and means “Dormition” (the celebration of the “falling asleep (aka death) of Mary, Mother of God, and her being taken up to heaven).\n\nKauppatori Old Market Square\n\nHelsinki’s Old Market Square, or Kauppatori is a delight. In the summer months, there are stalls for buying local goods, fruits, and vegetables. And there are food stalls to sit and have your lunch, either in the sun or the shade. Take a while to explore. If you eat beware of the seagulls, they’re an absolute menace. There’s a drinking fountain here if you need to fill your reusable water bottles. (and yes, it’s potable water).\n\nWhile you’ll find the square busy during the summer months it’s actually at its most popular in October, when the Helsinki herring market starts, it’s run here since 1743!\n\nThis is where many of Helsinki’s ferries leave from, including those to the fortress island of Suomenlinna, and in summer it’s here you can catch the M/S J. L. Runeberg, for a day trip to Porvoo – boat trips usually start in Mid-May.\n\nIf you didn’t have breakfast inside the Old Market Hall, then I recommend taking a look now.\n\nHave Lunch at the Old Market Hall in Helsinki\n\nThe market hall was established in 1889, it was fully renovated between 2012 and 2014 and today hosts food vendors, both for sit-down and takeaway. And there are some great options here. Grab some lunch. There are several dishes that you should try here – and whether you get them now for lunch, or dinner later, or for tomorrow’s picnic, be sure to try them.\n\nKarjalanpiirakka (rice pies)\n\nOriginally from the Karelia region of Finland (in the northeast), these rye crust pastries are filled with rice porridge and topped with egg butter. Karjalanpiirakka are popular for breakfast, but also as snacks.\n\nLeipajuusto (bread cheese)\n\nThis fresh cheese is to a certain extent similar to halloumi – it’s known as squeaky cheese. It’s made from the rich milk – or beestings – of a cow that’s just calved. Eat with cloudberry jam and drink coffee with it.\n\nMuikku (fried vendance)\n\nVendace is a small freshwater fish found in lakes in northern Europe. It’s very common in Finland and you’ll find several vendors selling it here. You eat the fish whole (they’re small), even the bones and the tail and the head if you want to. They’re cooked by breading it and frying it in butter. If you get some of this, watch out for those menace seagulls.\n\nGraavilohi (cured salmon)\n\nThere’s a lot of salmon in Finnish dishes, and this is one of the best ways of eating it. The raw salmon is cured in sugar, salt, and dill. Eat it thinly sliced with dill sauce on bread.\n\nLohikeitto (salmon chowder)\n\nThis is a fabulous and filling dish. You’ll easily find it here in the Old Market Hall, on the stalls in the square, and also in a variety of places in supermarkets (in tins, in fresh tubs in the chiller departments). Salmon filters, boiled potatoes, and leeks are seasoned with fresh dill, allspice, salt, and pepper. It is delicious.\n\nAfter you’ve eaten your fill, we’re going for a ride, high up in the sky. That’s right, the Ferris wheel that you can see is our next destination.\n\nSkywheel Helsinki\n\nHelsinki’s Ferris wheel or Observation Wheel gets you the best views in Helsinki. It reaches a maximum height of 40 meters (131 feet), while slowly turning. But that’s not the best bit. Want a champagne experience – you’ve got it. Want something truly, truly Finnish? Go for the sauna experience on the Skywheel.\n\nThe special sauna gondola takes up to 5 people at a time, but the experience is available for up to 15 people – when you’re not in the sauna you can relax in a hot tub, on the terrace, or in a private lounge. There’s more information here.\n\nTake a Wander around Helsinki’s Esplanade\n\nHead on now to Helsinki’s Esplanade, known as “Espa” to locals, this green space is the most famous park in Finland and the design was by Engel who designed Senate Square. The leafy, tree-lined walks here are a delight. There are a variety of sculptures throughout the park, the most famous of which is of JL Runeberg, Finland’s National Poet. The summer months bring musical theatre here – bands play, and picnics happen under the trees. It’s really rather lovely, but don’t linger long we still have much to do.\n\nNext, you’re going to head up towards Helsinki’s Central Station for a brief stop.\n\nSee the Lantern Bearers of Helsinki’s Central Station\n\nThe four Granite lantern bearers of the central station have been here guarding the entrance since 1914. The muscular torsos of the figures hold globes that are lit up at night. The lower part of the figures are columns.\n\nThe Lyhdynkantajat (Lantern Bearers) are one of the symbols of Helsinki and they’re often “dressed” in garb of the moment – like masks for Covid-19 precautions, or the Finnish National Football Team clothing.\n\nNow you can hop on the number 7 tram from here for 15 minutes to the Länsiterm. T1 stop.\n\nSee the Bad, Bad Boy in Helsinki\n\nThe 8.5 meters (28 feet) Bad, Bad Boy has been here, outside the Verkkokauppa electronic store since 2016, although he previously spent 2 years located at Helsinki’s East Harbour. He’s the work of artist, Tommi Toija is made of concrete and is, well a naked, urinating boy. The water that flows through the statue is heated, so that he can urinate year round, even in the deepest of Finnish winters.\n\nAnd now that you’re here, outside the Verkkokauppa store you’re going to want to go inside, for another fabulous view of Helsinki – and something rather spectacular on the roof.\n\nSee the MiG-21BIS on the Observation Deck of the Verkkokauppa store\n\nIf you’re visiting Helsinki between the 1st of April and the 22nd of November then there’s a treat waiting for you. The roof of this flagship store of Finland’s Verkkokauppa electronics store is not only an observation deck with fabulous views of Helsinki, but it’s also home to a retired fighter jet.\n\nThe MiG-21 BIS, or MiG-1300 interceptor jet fighter came from the Soviet Union. It was during the Cold War that Finland, a neutral country sitting between two opposing forces, began buying MiG-21 planes. The planes were in service until they were replaced by F-18 Hornets in 1998. It’s free to come up to the terrace during store opening hours (Monday to Saturday 09:00-21:00 and Sunday 11:00 until 19:00) between April and November. Take the middle lift to the terrace.\n\nYou’ll want to get back on the number 7 tram for your next stop, the Kampi Chapel\n\nVisit the Kamppi Chapel in Helsinki\n\nHelsinki’s “Chapel of Silence” is found in the busy Narrinkkatori Square and it’s not what you’d call a traditional chapel in any way whatsoever. While there are prayer meetings held here, there are no weddings or baptisms. This is simply a place for silence.\n\nIt’s something of a bizarre shape, looking a bit like an egg, but it’s designed to be calming and somewhat womblike. It’s been open since 2012 and attracts around 250,000 visitors a year, who all pay the €5 per person entrance fee.\n\nTake a Tour in a Mobile Bar in Helsinki – this is SpåraKOFF\n\nNow, I said earlier that Helsinki’s public transit system was brilliant. And this next stop in Helsinki is on a tram. But it’s no ordinary tram. This is the SparaKOFF tram, and it has been converted into a mobile bar that takes you on tours of the city. There’s beer, wine, cider, and soft drinks available on the tours that last 45 minutes. You can buy crisps and peanuts too. You’ll notice that it looks different to the other trams in the city, so you can’t miss it. It’s bright red.\n\nThe name comes from a combination of “Spara” (tram) and the beer brand KOFF, which comes from the largest brewery in Finland (and the oldest in Scandinavian) Sinebrychoff Brewery. The tram operates with departures on the hour from 14:00 until 20:00 from17 Mikonkatu.\n\nMay 17 – June 1: Fri-Sat\n\nJune 3 – August 31: Mon-Sat (no service on June 20-22)\n\nSeptember 6-14: Fri-Sat\n\nThe tram takes 30 passengers, and you can sit, or stand. There are no guides on the tram, but usually, the bartender is a wealth of information. There are no reservations, simply board at 17 Mikonkatu. Tickets are €12 for adults and €5 for children.\n\nDinner in Helsinki\n\nAll that remains for the end of your first day in Helsinki is to find dinner. There are several outdoor and sea view restaurants – try Meripaviljonki on the floating platform in the center of Helsinki or Lappi Ravintola for Lappish reindeer or seafood dishes.\n\nDay 2 of 2 days in Helsinki\n\nWe’re going to start the day with breakfast at a Helsinki staple.\n\nBreakfast at the Fazer Café\n\nStop by the famous Fazer Café for breakfast. This cafe has been delighting Helsinki families since 1891 and is usually a great option for the sweeter side of life (their chocolate – Finland’s favorite since 1922 is fabulous), but do try a Helsinki favorite of a Korvapuusti (cinnamon bun). Their breakfast buffet is great value.\n\nAfter breakfast stock up on picnic items, as we’re heading out on the Finferries boat to the fortress island of Suolominena for the day.\n\nTake a trip to Suomenlinna\n\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Suomenlinna Fortress is an enormous site accessible only by ferry from Helsinki (the ferry leaves from Old Market Square) and takes about 25 minutes to thread through some of the islands of the archipelago and arrive at the fortress, which actually comprises 6 islands, connected by bridges. There is a heck of a lot to see here – and centuries of history – this guided tour takes you around the island with a local knowledgeable guide.\n\nThe Suomenlinna site has restaurants, cafes, a theatre, six museums, parks and walking trails. It’s big. You’re going to want to plan to be here for the rest of the day to explore it properly. This site is unique. Following its construction in 1748, it has defenced three different countries – the Kingdom of Sweden, the Russian Empire, and the Republic of Finland.\n\nThe fortress was initially built by Sweden for protection after a war between Sweden and Russia. In 1808 the fortress was ceded to the Russians, and they expanded the fortress, adding an Orthodox church and barracks. It was heavily bombarded during the Crimean War, but repaired and then defended Russia in World War I. After Finnish independence in 1917, the fortress was taken over by the Finnish government in 1918 and duly defended Finland during World War II. It’s been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1991 and currently houses 800 residents.\n\nYou’ll want to ensure that you’re back in Helsinki by around 17:30 as we’ve got a treat for you at the end of your second day in Helsinki.\n\nTake an evening Archipelago Cruise\n\nThere’s no better way to wrap up your 2 days in Helsinki than by hopping on another boat. This time, there’s a bar and you can also book a table and enjoy the onboard buffet of local delicacies. This cruise operates from the beginning of June and the light nights mean that you’ll get to see the stunning scenery for 2.5 hours as the boat winds through the archipelago.\n\nIf you decide not to dine on the cruise, then head over to Mattolaituri for dinner. This unique and popular with locals place to eat is also a popular carpet-washing pier! It’s the perfect ending to a glorious 2 days in Helsinki. Reserve a table here\n\nMap of Things to See and Do in Helsinki\n\nYou can see the full map of Helsinki’s things to do here.\n\nWhere to go after Helsinki\n\nThis is a glorious part of the world to explore, so you’ll likely want to spend more time in the Nordic region. If you’re staying in Helsinki, then I recommend the gorgeous old town of Porvoo – it’s one of the best day trips from Helsinki, but heading there for longer is also a delight. If you want to spend more time in the south of Finland, then head on over to Finland’s oldest city, Turku. Get out into the islands on the Archipelago Trail.\n\nHeading north, then there’s the glorious Koli National Park, which has some of the most stunning hikes, and even further north, the Brown Bear Center, where you can spend the bright nights of summer watching for bears.\n\nOr head west to Sweden, Stockholm is just glorious, and I have another 2 day itinerary here for you. Or take the ferry from Helsinki into the capital of Estonia, Tallinn, which we first visited 10 years ago, but it’s well worth a second or even third visit, it’s just so lovely.\n\nTravel Tips for Finland\n\nConsidering travel insurance for your trip?

We parked the car for the entire time we were here and used ferries, the metro, trains, trams, and buses. Our 2 days in Helsinki were in June, with long glorious light nights and superb weather.\n\nWe receive a fee when you get a quote from World Nomads using our affiliate links.
