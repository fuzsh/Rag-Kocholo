        "text": "Helsinki is a northern city surrounded by hundreds of lakes and impenetrable forests; a city where cold winds blow, and birds fly far away. Here, there are more Finnish saunas than cars, and Finns only need to see the sun to smile. However, the feeling of tranquility and measuredness permeates stern Helsinki everywhere.\n\nDuring my journey through the Finnish capital, I encountered a wonderful warm day. The autumn weather was favorable to me, delighting me with the warm rays of sunlight. In mid-October, everything here rapidly turns into gold, and in my opinion, this is the best time to visit the northern capital of Finland. The city seemed cozy, with its northern charisma.\n\nUnfortunately, at other times, the sun is not a frequent guest here; the sky covers the city with leaden clouds for 170 days a year, and annoying rain constantly drizzles. Could you live without the sun for almost half a year?\n\nHelsinki is considered one of the gloomiest cities on the planet. Grayness and dampness induce melancholy, and many residents complain of chronic depressions.\n\nBut people have found a solution to this plague – they started wearing bright clothes, building colorful houses, and organizing festivals for any reason or without any. Reading this post, you can see how truly welcoming and friendly Helsinki can be regardless of the weather conditions outside.\n\nKamppi Chapel.\n\nTo help the locals somehow, the local government built the unusual Kamppi Chapel, which outwardly resembles a ship. This chapel is simple and straightforward. There are no icons here, and the entire building is covered in wood. There is no pathos that is often found in churches. All this was created with a single thought – visitors should feel tranquility and silence here. Inside, the temple resembles an egg – psychologists say that in such conditions, a person can feel safe, distract from bad thoughts, and find inner harmony and confidence. It’s like a cocoon that can protect from the outside world. Strange as this chapel may seem, it works. Address: Simonkatu 7, Narinkkatori. Admission is free.\n\nTemppeliaukio Church – tranquility and measuredness of stern Helsinki.\n\nIn addition to this chapel, there is another unusual structure – the Temppeliaukio Church in the rock. Here, a speaker serves as bells, and instead of singing prayers, rock hits are performed. They say it fills with magic at Christmas. Such a serene place.\n\nHelsinki Cathedral.\n\nOn the steps of the Helsinki Cathedral, you can sit and briefly imagine what the square will look like at different times of the year. This is one of the most beautiful places in Helsinki, where behind it stands the white cathedral, and in front of it will be the main arena of the city – Senate Square.\n\nJust around the corner, at the Market Square, they will be selling donuts and seasonal berries. Then there’s the Esplanade Boulevard – the city’s main artery, one of the greenest and most peaceful places in the Helsinki.\n\nTranquil and measured Helsinki.\n\nArriving in Helsinki, you get the feeling that you’re not quite in the European Union, but rather in St. Petersburg. Many gray-brown buildings, stone pavements, and the city is surrounded by cold blue sea.\n\nThere are almost no tall buildings in Helsinki, and the houses are like matchboxes, squeezed into a single style. They don’t build buildings with balconies here, and the city looks modest but neat because of it.\n\nBut what’s surprising here is not the architecture, but the people. Helsinki is a wealthy city with high salaries. And despite this, money couldn’t spoil the people. They are modest, polite, and courteous; they don’t flaunt their wealth, don’t buy expensive cars, jewelry, or build luxurious mansions. Here, the most affluent people live in ordinary apartments and drive simple cars.\n\nThis is a low city, drowning in greenery along the shores of the Gulf of Finland. There are few people living here, so Helsinki’s life is leisurely and measured. The cry of seagulls, the noise of the surf, the smells of the salty sea – there is a northern, cold beauty in this. It has its charm; it captivates, especially when you’re not accustomed to it.\n\nHeading into nature, you can find lingonberries, blueberries, and cranberries. The city is surrounded by a magical forest where berries grow absolutely free. Take a basket and off you go!\n\nFinland can surprise with its ability to skilfully combine the beauty of nature with technological progress. The locals are simply turned on nature and ecology. Even their subways are stylisations of caves where water trickles down.\n\nThe famous Finnish design, 19th-century classicism, steel, concrete, and glass, shopping streets, greenery, the sea, and pristine granite are visible everywhere – all this combines so organically, giving the 450-year-old Helsinki an aura that you won’t feel anywhere else.\n\nFinns and the sea.\n\nFinns love the sea passionately. As soon as a fine day comes, they gather picnic supplies, take a boat, and head to the islands. The city’s coastline is so extensive that walking along it is a journey in itself. And the best place to watch the seagulls is the Suomenlinna fortress. You can go kayaking or canoeing, for example, from Teel or Vuosaari. If you are interested in the Suomenlinna fortress, then more information about it is here.\n\nHelsinki has made an impression as the most balanced city in the world, where tranquility and order rule the ball. The Finnish capital is one of the wealthiest cities in the world, but the main values here are not money, but modesty and care for loved ones.\n\nHow you can save a lot of money in Helsinki.\n\nBuy a Helsinki Card. This card will give you access to more than 80 museums, discounts to the zoo, oceanarium and the Finnish Science Centre. This card will allow you to use public transport within the city for free, including a trip to Suomenlinna Island. Well, plus many other bonuses and a lot of discounts. More information can be found at www.helsinkicard.com.\n\nTo better prepare for your trip I will give some useful links:\n\nHelsinkiexpert.com – site about HelsinkiCard\n\nHs.fi – public transport website\n\nReittiopas.fi – a great trip planner for travelling around the city and the surrounding area.\n\nHow to get to Helsinki.\n\nIn this guide, we’ll explore various transportation options and provide tips to ensure a smooth journey to this Nordic gem.\n\nBy Air: For international travelers, flying into Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (HEL) is the most common and convenient option.
