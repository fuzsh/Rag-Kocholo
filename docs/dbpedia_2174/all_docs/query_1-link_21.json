        "text": "1. They keep rats at bay\n\nIf it weren’t for gulls eating our waste, we’d probably have a lot more rats and rodents.\n\n2. They provide a soundtrack to our memories\n\nEven if their bolshiness isn’t appreciated, many people still love the sound of gulls at the seaside. Think of the herring gulls calling over the crashing waves in the Desert Island Discs signature tune.\n\n3. They are highly adaptable\n\nGulls are masters of adaptability: that is why they have colonised our cities so successfully while struggling at the coast.\n\nWhere their natural habitat has declined and food has diminished, seagulls are suffering. However those gulls which have migrated to cities, which provide safety as well as an abundance of food, have managed to thrive.\n\nGulls are the kickass entrepreneurs of the avian world.\n\n4. They have admirable traits\n\nEven though gulls display many emotions which we would see as positives in a person (competitive spirit, willing to seize an opportunity), we disparage them for these traits. While it’s never a pleasant experience to have your lunch dive-bombed, maybe we should look at it from their point of view.\n\n5. Spot the difference\n\nGull species are extremely complicated to tell apart and mastering it is the bird-watching equivalent of being able to distinguish fine wines.\n\n6. They are more sinned against than sinning\n\nIn a study of human/gull interactions, it was found that a human was far less likely to be \"attacked\" – ie chip stealing – by a gull than a gull was to be attacked by a human. One man in Bath was regularly seen standing naked on his balcony swinging a samurai sword to deter gulls from nesting near his flat – a technique researchers said would probably work in the short term but is legally dubious having in mind the indecent exposure; and, of course, the fact that nesting gulls are protected by law. Not many people know that...\n\n7. Yes, they can actually be cuddly\n\nGull imagery is also commonly used in sports: teams such as Torquay United and Brighton & Hove Albion have them as mascots (Gilbert the Gull and Gully the Seagull, respectively). Others including Blackpool Seagulls and the Helsinki Seagulls name entire teams after them."
