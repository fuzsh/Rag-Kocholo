        "text": "Helsinki might not be on every traveller’s bucket list, and it wouldn’t have been on mine either if it hadn’t been for a great flight connection from Amsterdam, which I was visiting for work. This connection, which I discovered by accident, allowed me to visit not only Helsinki but also take a ferry ride to Tallinn and return to Amsterdam within a short period of four days without needing a wasteful layover anywhere. In any case, I’ve long abandoned the idea of travelling based on bucket lists, as I’ve been pleasantly surprised by seemingly mundane places. I now believe every place has something fresh and awesome to offer.\n\nBest of all, Helsinki is an introvert’s dream. People keep a respectful distance; polite and quiet; but will help when needed. You can escape to a sauna or a library if the world outside gets too busy and noisy. Everyone, and indeed the city itself, is quiet, calm, and sedate. It’s also super safe, any time of the day.\n\nWant to make the most of your two days in the city without breaking the bank? Read on for the perfect two-day Helsinki itinerary, ideal for solo travellers or families.\n\nEssentials\n\nAbout Helsinki\n\nHelsinki, the capital city of Finland, is located in the southern part of the country, which itself is in northernmost Europe. The city was founded by King Gustav I of Sweden in 1550 and was part of Sweden until 1809. This was followed by a period of Russian control when the city prospered. In fact, Helsinki was created to look like a twin of Saint Petersburg in Russia, which is not far from Helsinki. But soon a nationalist fervour took over, “Swedes we are no more, Russians we cannot become, therefore Finns we must be,” leading to the country gaining independence in 1917 and self-governing since then.\n\nFinland today functions as a social democracy. You might have heard of Sanna Marin, Finland’s prime minister from 2019 to 2023, whose viral video of her dancing in a pub drew international attention and criticism. She was much beloved, and everyone I spoke with in Helsinki was sad to see her lose the subsequent election. In Finland, government servants live and operate normally alongside citizens, and her actions were not seen as unusual by many, including me. However, the attention did her no favours, as she lost the election, and Petteri Orpo replaced her as prime minister.\n\nWinters in Helsinki are cold and snowy, with temperatures often below freezing. Summers are mild and sometimes warm, with temperatures ranging from 15°C to 25°C. It rained 70-80% of the two days in July when I was there.\n\nYou can sometimes see the Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, in Helsinki during winter, but better sightings are in Lapland, which is further north.\n\nFun fact: Helsinki has a single official Santa Claus who resides in Lapland and can be visited! Santa Claus Village is located in Rovaniemi, Lapland, on the Arctic Circle. This popular tourist destination allows visitors to meet Santa Claus year-round, send postcards from Santa’s official post office, and learn about Finnish Christmas traditions.\n\nAround 6 million people live in Helsinki; the majority are Lutheran Christians.\n\nThe Finnish language is Finno-Ugric and is considered among the hardest to learn for speakers of Indo-European languages due to its unique grammar and vocabulary. The only word I learned was kalsarikännit, the Finnish word for drinking at home in your underwear (Pantsdrunk). Oh, yes! I am not making this up.\n\nAll the Nordic countries have flags featuring a cross, known as the Nordic cross. However, each flag has a distinct design and colour scheme. Finland’s flag has a blue cross on a white background.\n\nAnd now for some fun facts about the city and the country. Nokia (telecommunications) and Rovio (creator of Angry Birds) are headquartered here. Helsinki is also considered a mecca for design and architecture lovers; the buildings are a mixture of Nordic, art nouveau, and neoclassical design; Alvar Aalto is one of their most famous architects and many of the buildings in the city are designed by him. The word sauna is Finnish and the practice is thought to have originated here. There are about 2 million saunas in Finland for 6 million people, so, you can see how important it is for local life. Every place has a sauna. Government buildings, universities, hotels, private homes, Airbnbs, Ferris wheels, and even prisons! Finland has around 188,000 lakes, which is why it’s called the “Land of a Thousand Lakes.” The tap water here is super clean and often thought better than bottled water. 78% of the country is green and there are 4,500 trees per Finn. And despite having the second highest taxes in the world (after Belgium), almost everything (such as education, healthcare, and childcare) is subsidized or free. I learned that traffic fines in Finland were based on the offender’s income, leading to some hefty penalties for the wealthy. In one notable case, in 2015, Reima Kuisla, a Finnish businessman, was fined €54,000 for speeding in Helsinki; his fine was calculated based on his annual income of €6.5 million.\n\nHelsinki is quiet, comfortable, and almost…. boring. This, folks, might just be the key to happiness. It’s a quiet country where people avoid eye contact, but boy, do they love heavy metal music! When I visited, the summer parks were full of buskers playing heavy metal, and even the older generation swayed along. I guess you’ve got to express the dark bits of your soul somehow. A fun nugget: In Finland, there’s a unique trend called “heavy metal knitting,” where participants knit to the rhythm of live heavy metal music. This quirky subculture even has a World Heavy Metal Knitting Championship, held annually in Finland. Crazy. Crazy.\n\nFinland has topped the World Happiness Report for several consecutive years and is considered the home of happy people. But no one was more surprised than the Finns themselves when their country was rated so. With most of the year bitterly cold and dark, and with among the highest suicide rates in the world, they wondered how. The sombre joke is that those who were unhappy were probably no longer around to answer the survey…\n\nOverall, Helsinki is an easy, laid-back city. No one will talk to you unless you want them to, and their noses are buried in either a book or a phone. Works for me!\n\nTransport\n\nGetting to the City from the Airport\n\nThere are two airports in Helsinki. One is Helsinki-Vantaa Airport (HEL), the main international airport, located in Vantaa, approximately 17 kilometres north of Helsinki city centre, and Helsinki-Malmi Airport, a smaller airport primarily used for general aviation and pilot training, but some flights do land here.\n\nBelow are some ways to go to the city if you land in Helsinki-Vantaa Airport. Check connections in the HSL App. This app is a must-download; more on it later.\n\nPublic Transport: The Finnair City Bus operates between the airport and Helsinki Central Railway Station, even during late hours. Check the schedule for availability.\n\nAirport Train: The Airport Train (I or P train) runs from the airport to Helsinki Central Railway Station.\n\nLate at night: Bus number 600 operates through the night and takes you from the airport to Central Railway station. Frequency varies with season.\n\nGetting Around in The City\n\nPublic transitin Helsinki is combined into a single ticket program that covers buses, trains, trams, metro, and the Suomenlinna ferry. Download the HSL app to buy day passes or single journey tickets. A single journey ticket covers the entire distance end to end for the fare which is valid for 90-120 minutes. For the AB zone, a day pass (preferable option) costs €9; the two-day pass costs €13.50; and a single ticket costs €2.95. For the ABC zone (C zone = Vaanta, the airport), a day pass (preferable option) costs €13; the two-day pass costs €16; and a single ticket costs €4.10. You cannot buy tickets on board.\n\nMore information here.\n\nRemember the following:\n\nWhen boarding buses, show your ticket on the HSL app to the driver as you board from the front. For trains, either scan your ticket at a reader or wait for a ticket checker to scan it on her rounds. On trams, I didn’t do anything. I had the day ticket anyway, and the trams were quite crowded as they usually ply between major city centre stops.\n\nAt some lesser-used bus stops, you must signal the bus with your hand to make it stop. I didn’t know this, and, as a result, missed a critical connection one time, causing me to wait late into the night for the next bus to arrive (damn you 623). As the night progresses, connections grow scarce, so keep that hand ready.\n\nAdditionally, be careful to board the tram or bus in the correct direction. I got this wrong several times, which added confusion to my journey. But perhaps, that’s just me. That’s why I always prefer a Day Pass. It allows for mistakes.\n\nTaking the Ferry from Helsinki to Tallinn\n\nUse Directferries to discover the best connections, and then purchase from the operator’s website. I used Tallink’s MyStar and Megastar to travel to Tallinn from Helsinki and was blown away, especially by MyStar. It seemed like a five-star hotel slash casino slash glitzy pub-cafe-mall on a ship. So much luxury for a mere two hours? Worth every cent of the €35 I paid.\n\nThe Tallink Ferries leave from West Terminal 2 in Helsinki. Helsinki has many ports and it’s possible that a journey starts from one port and returns to another, so check your ticket carefully. Tallinn has only one port; so easy, peasy.\n\nBoarding opens 40 minutes before departure and closes 20 minutes prior. Boarding times are strictly enforced. You can scan the barcode on your phone to board. Passports are not checked between Helsinki and Tallinn. Overall, the process is efficient and pleasant.\n\nIn Tallinn, the port is close to the city centre and is a 15-minute walk away. In Helsinki, however, the closest tram stop to West Terminal 2 is Länsiterminaali. It takes about 15 minutes by tram from the city centre to this stop, plus an additional 5 minutes to reach the departure point. Therefore, in Helsinki, if you plan to use public transport and want to board on time, start your journey an hour earlier from wherever you are to reach the ferry terminal.\n\nOthers Basics\n\nHelsinki is in the European Union and uses the Euro as its currency. It is also part of the Schengen Area, which is important for travellers needing a Schengen Visa, such as those from India.\n\nYou may consider getting the Helsinki Card which provides access to the majority of the city’s top attractions and includes transportation (Cost for an adult: 24h/48h/72h: €48 / €58 / €68). I didn’t take it as I wasn’t going to do much museum hopping and found the HSL app good enough to cover transport costs.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nPublic transport is decent in Helsinki, and it’s also quite safe to travel around late in the night. You can stay anywhere in the AB zone and reach the city centre in under an hour. I recommend Eurohostel for its affordability, good location, and suitability for solo travellers. It’s also close to the Katajanokka Sea Terminal, convenient for ferry trips to Tallinn. Note that the Katajanokka terminal is 30 minutes from West Terminal 2.\n\nAnother excellent accommodation option is the Yard Hostel.\n\nNow let’s go to what I did in my two days in Helsinki. It was July, so the days were long and most places were open, but it rained almost through the day, affecting my mood and limiting what I could do.\n\nDay 1: City Tour\n\nWalking Tour\n\nHop-on-Hop-off Bus\n\n(The following is based on research and conversations with tourists in the city.)\n\nBasics\n\nNote that there are two hop-on-hop-off bus services in Helsinki. City Sightseeing Helsinki is better rated and starts from Senate Square. The 24 hours ticket costs €29.34 for an adult and 48 hours costs €39.69 which includes a cruise. The hop-on-hop-off by Stromma starts from Senate Square but farther down, has a slightly different route, and is free if you have the Helsinki Card.\n\nThe first bus starts at 10 AM and the last bus starts at 4 PM from stop 1 i.e. Senate Square, every 30 minutes (although, it’s more often 45 min – 50 min). The whole loop takes about 90 minutes if you don’t get off. Market Square is the point for cruises and operates from 10:30 AM to 3:30 PM – a 90-minute loop every 60 minutes.\n\nThe Sightseeing buses more or less halt at the following places along the way.\n\nThe Route\n\nSenate Square / Helsinki City Museum (covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nOld Market Hall (covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nOlympia Terminal (Silja Line) / Mannerheim Museum\n\nCafé Ursula / Kaivopuisto Park\n\nCompass Square\n\nEira\n\nHernesaari Cruise Terminal\n\nLöyly (Not covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nFlea Market / Bulevardi / Sinebrychoff Art Museum\n\nSwedish Theatre / Design Museum / Museum of Finnish Architecture\n\nMarket Square (departure point for Canal Cruise) (covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nAmos Rex / Kiasma / Helsinki Art Museum / Central Railway Station (Not covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nTemppeliaukio Church (Rock Church) (Not covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nSibelius monument (Not covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nOlympic Stadium (Not covered by the walking tour. Worth a stop)\n\nLinnanmaki Amusement Park / Sea Life Helsinki\n\nLinnunlaulu / Helsinki City Theatre\n\nHakaniemi Market Square and Market Hall\n\nI initially considered using the hop-on-hop-off as I had just come from Seven Days in South Africa where the hop-on-hop-off buses rocked. But I later abandoned the idea as online reviews mentioned subpar commentary, frequent crowding due to cruise-ship traffic, and delays in arrival at the stops, 30 minutes often turning into an hour. Also, I found that their working hours were quite limited (10 AM to 4 PM) and I realized I wouldn’t be making full use of the price, which was not cheap.\n\nI also recommend that you visit the Tourist Information Centre close to Market Square at Lyypekinlaituri at the start of your visit. Open from the end of May until the end of August | Mon-Sun 9 AM – 4 PM. The centre had loads of good information regarding ongoing summer events, discounts and offers, and info on museum timings. See more here.\n\nDay 2: Soumenlinna and a Sauna\n\nSoumenlinna\n\nAbout\n\nSuomenlinna, a UNESCO World Heritage site, is an 18th-century sea fortress spread across six islands near Helsinki, Finland. Originally named Sveaborg, it was constructed by the Swedish to protect against Russian expansion. The fortress played a significant role during various conflicts, including the Russo-Swedish War and the Crimean War.\n\nAfter Finland gained independence in 1917, Suomenlinna became part of the Finnish defence system. Today, it is a popular tourist destination and a vibrant community with around 800 residents. Visitors can explore its well-preserved fortifications, historical museums, and art galleries. Highlights include the Suomenlinna Museum, which offers insights into the fortress’s history, and the Vesikko submarine, used by the Finnish Navy during World War II. Accessible by a short ferry ride from Helsinki’s Market Square, Suomenlinna offers picturesque views, charming cafes, and scenic walking trails. It also hosts events throughout the year, such as concerts and theatre performances.\n\n(From the website) To navigate the island easily, follow the Blue Route which runs from north to south and covers all the main sights. The route starts at the main quay in front of the Jetty Barracksand terminates at theKing’s Gate. The length of the route is about 1.5 km (1 mile). It is marked with blue direction signs and is shown on the information maps as a solid blue line. Information boards along the route provide information about the sights and their history. There are five such information boards along the main route, providing information about the Russian merchants’ quarter, Church Park, Great Courtyard, Piper’s Park and the fortifications of Kustaanmiekka. Watch avideoof the Blue route.\n\nHow to Go\n\nThe ferry service to Suomenlinna is operated by the Helsinki Region Transport Authority (HSL) and is covered in the day pass. You can buy a ticket using the HSL app. Suomenlinna is in the HSL ticket zone A. Tickets must be purchased before boarding as they are not sold on board.\n\nDepending on the season and the time of day, ferries run 1 to 4 times per hour from the morning until the night throughout the year. The journey to Suomenlinna takes approximately 15 minutes. The ferry departs from the east side of the Market Square, opposite the Presidential Palace.\n\nSeason and Opening Hours\n\nSuomenlinna is open all year round however not all of the museums, cafes and restaurants are open during the winter. Opening hours.\n\nGuided tours\n\nJoining a guided tour is a good way to explore Suomenlinna. These tours cover the fortress islands, highlighting main sights and key historical events, and offering insights into Finnish and Northern European history. The tours take you through the historic Susisaari and Kustaanmiekka areas, featuring landmarks like the Great Courtyard and the former world’s largest dry dock. Guided by authorized Suomenlinna guides from the Ehrensvärd Society, the tours start at the Suomenlinna Museum and last about an hour.\n\nGuided tours are offered June 1st – August 31st: every day at 10:30 AM and 2 PM in English. The tours start from the Suomenlinna Museum. The price for an adult is €14. The guided tour is free with a Helsinki Card. Entrance to Ehrensvärd Museum is included in the price. Buy tickets here.\n\nSauna\n\nAbout\n\nI researched this and decided to create a section for beginners like me.\n\nThe word “sauna” is Finnish, and boy, do they love it. Instead of saying, “Meet me for coffee or a drink,” they say, “Meet me for a sauna.” There are more saunas here than cars! I can get on board with that.\n\nTraditionally, Saturday was sauna day because Sunday was for being clean and purified. But now, there’s no strict rule. Some people hit the sauna almost every day, usually in the evening, to unwind before bed. It’s a great way to chill with friends and family. This is one of the places, like the library, where the introverted locals connect and engage.\n\nSaunas are common in Finland and found in homes, hotels, apartment buildings, and even offices. In ancient times, saunas were used to stay warm in winter inside heated caves or pits. Finland is also home to the world’s deepest sauna, in the Pyhäsalmi Mine, 1,410 meters below the surface.\n\nTherefore, I am convinced now that the sauna has no health benefits. But hey, it was fun!\n\nSome tips\n\nHydrate yourself beforehand by drinking 1-2 glasses of water\n\nShower before entering the sauna\n\nYou can sit in the sauna wearing a towel, naked, or in a swimsuit. In a private sauna, sitting in a towel is common\n\nSaunas have benches along the walls: top benches are the hottest, and lower benches are the coolest. Start on a middle bench\n\nLadle water onto the hot stones to create steam and raise the temperature. The sauna should be moist, not dry. In a public sauna, the person on the hottest bench decides when to add more water\n\nSit in the sauna for about 10-15 minutes. You can come out to cool off and then go back in. Repeat this cycle for about an hour\n\nIn traditional saunas, you may be offered a bunch of birch leaves (vihta). Use it to pat yourself over the shoulders to improve circulation\n\nSaunas can be wood-fired, smoke-based, or electric. They usually cost about €15-25 for two hours.\n\nSome popular ones are the Löyly public sauna, Sauna Hermanni, Sompasauna (Helsinki’s public sauna and free to use), and Allas Sea Pool.\n\nOptional: Seurasaari\n\nAbout\n\nImagine stepping off a bridge and into another era. That’s exactly what awaits you at Seurasaari, a charming island transformed into an open-air museum, just a short distance from the heart of Helsinki. Here, amidst the tranquil beauty of a Finnish forest, you’ll find a remarkable collection of over 80 wooden buildings, meticulously transported from all corners of the country. The island is home to structures dating to the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. Wander through an 18th-century food storage building and marvel at its ingenious design for keeping provisions fresh. Step inside a water sawmill powered by a rushing stream and envision the spirit of bygone eras. Immerse yourself in the grandeur of a stately Manor House or a more modest vicar’s dwelling, each showcasing the lives and customs of different social classes.\n\nHowever, if you want to delve deeper into the stories these buildings hold, consider going on a guided tour. For those seeking a dose of exercise along with their history lesson, Seurasaari offers routes for a stroll or a more energetic hike along a scenic wooden trail that winds through the island’s shoreline forest. Just outside the museum grounds, you can also visit the house of Urho Kaleva Kekkonen, one of Finland’s most influential and long-serving presidents.\n\nSeason and Opening Hours\n\nSeurasaari Island Park is open all year around but the open-air museum and the guided tours inside buildings are usually only available during summer, typically from May 15th to September 15th and Monday – Sunday 11 AM – 5 PM. Check the official website for more. Admission Fees to the park itself is free. A museum ticket (€12) includes a guided tour and is covered by the Helsinki Card. The tours depart from the ticket kiosk of the museum. The duration of the tours is around 45–60 min. Tours in English take place at 3 PM daily.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nMarket Hall for Lunch: This is a foodie paradise, although it can get very crowded during lunchtime. It offers a wide range of Finnish delicacies, including “Karjalanpiirakka” (Karelian pie), “Kalakukko” (fish pie), “Lohikeitto” (salmon soup), “Poronkäristys” (sautéed reindeer), and “Mustikkapiirakka” (blueberry pie). Market Hall is a quick walk from Market Square and Senate Square, so do not miss it.\n\nEkberg 1852: Start your day with a delicious pastry and coffee at the oldest and most popular bakery in the city.\n\nFazer Café: There are several branches in Helsinki but there is one right next to Ekberg in Bulevardi. This café offers a variety of delectable chocolates, pastries, and light meals.\n\nHerkku Market Bistro in Stockmann: Enjoy a variety of fresh and high-quality dishes in this bistro located within the famous Stockmann department store in the city centre.\n\nCafé Regatta: A charming café near the Sibelius Monument, perfect for enjoying coffee and traditional Finnish pastries.\n\nGo to Kamppi or Stockmann for shopping and Alepa or K-Market for your grocery needs.\n\nA visit to Porvoo can be taken as a side trip from Helsinki. It’s a historic old town, 50 kilometres east of Helsinki. Regular buses run from Helsinki’s Kamppi bus station to Porvoo. The journey takes about 1 hour.\n\nPowered by GetYourGuide"
