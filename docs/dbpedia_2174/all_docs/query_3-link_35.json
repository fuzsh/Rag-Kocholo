        "text": "Helsinki is the capital of Finland, a country in northern Europe. It is Finland’s largest city. Helsinki is located on land that sticks out into a gulf of the Baltic Sea. The city is surrounded by good natural harbors.\n\nHelsinki is Finland’s leading port and center of industry. The city’s main industries include shipbuilding and printing. Factories in the city make electronics, clothing, and metal products. Most people in Helsinki work in industries that provide services. Businesses related to computers, telephones, and other kinds of technology are important to the city’s economy.\n\nThe king of Sweden founded Helsinki in 1550. Finland was part of Sweden for hundreds of years.\n\nIn the early 1700s Helsinki suffered from disease, fire, and attacks by Russian forces. Russia invaded the city again in 1808. Helsinki was burned to the ground. Soon all of Finland became part of Russia.\n\nThe Russian ruler moved the capital of Finland to Helsinki in 1812. Helsinki grew rapidly as the new capital. The city center was completely rebuilt.\n\nIn 1917 Finland declared its independence from Russia. A brief but bloody war followed in Helsinki. Conditions soon became more stable. Helsinki developed into an important center of trade, industry, and culture. Population (2016 estimate), city, 635,181; (2015 estimate), urban area, 1,231,595."
