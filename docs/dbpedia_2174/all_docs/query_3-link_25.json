Nowadays the bay consists of large areas of shallow water and reedbeds, making it the most popular birding site around Helsinki, often known by the simpler name of Viikki. It is particularly good\n\nfor waterbirds and warblers and 2 recent colonists, Bearded Tit and Citrine Wagtail.\n\nHowever, you should also try scanning for Citrine Wagtails on these fenceposts, visible from a gate en route to the tower. The wagtails have large territories and have a nasty habit of disappearing for ages at a time - except perhaps when they are feeding young."
