        "text": "Like it? Feel free to share!\n\nHelsinki has held a place in our heart ever since our first visit. We spent 2 days in Helsinki way back in 2009 as we relocated from Australia to the UK. Our first ever European country, Finland also has some sentimental value for Jeff with given his maternal Great-Grandfather was Finnish!\n\nHelsinki often misses the itinerary of many European travellers. And to be fair, aside from the aforementioned nostalgia, that is where the memorability of that visit remains. That visit was filled with a bitterly cold few days of ‘spring’. Activities that were best saved for a warmer day. And our backpacking budget then made it feel like we walked into Monte Carlo with a handful of coins. It never made our list of recommendations after that visit. Even those visiting close to the region.\n\nOur Passion For Travel contains affiliate links which may provide a commission. Our reviews and commentary remain independent and commission comes at no cost to you. Income derived help us create more content to help travellers like you make the most of your travel experiences. Read more here.\n\nHelsinki – different this time around\n\nA return visit to the Finnish capital in 2019 however changed all that on a massive scale. We had lined up a trip on the visa-free ferry to St Petersburg, and Helsinki was fortuitously the best place for us to board this ferry. Our nostalgic first visit, is now amplified by a brilliant few summer days in Helsinki.\n\nAn altogether different prospect this time around, we were greeted with a Finnish heatwave. Even for these two Australians, it was warm. The city had an enormous buzz about it.\n\nAdd to this that there are a range of new, eclectic museums (with air conditioning mind you) to explore. We also discovered the amazement of sauna. Admittedly saunas are not a new thing in Helsinki but our early travel naivety and budget back in the day didn’t lead us there.\n\nContrast brings the ability to see both sides. And opened our eyes to giving cities and destinations a second chance. Let us share with you our favourite things to do with 2 days in Helsinki. We hope you walk away feeling more like we did in 2019 rather than 2009.\n\nYour best value purchase: the Helsinki Card\n\nBefore we get started I want to introduce you to the best value purchase of your trip: the Helsinki Card. For your 2 days in Helsinki itinerary it makes sense to buy the 2 day version. There are 1 and 3 day options however.\n\nThe Helsinki Card provides access to the majority of the city’s top attractions and places we recommend you visit in this 2 day itinerary.\n\nFor only €49 you can get a 2 day pass which covers all your public transport, the majority of our recommended things to do, and more.\n\nThe pass activates on your first use. So if you want to make the most of it, simply take note of when you activate and slip into your final attraction just before your 48 hours cuts off. You can buy your Helsinki card here.\n\nHow to get around Helsinki\n\nHelsinki has a very efficient and easy to use public transport system. We relied on this network on each of our visits to this city.\n\nTrams, buses and an underground metro all operate within Helsinki. With this 2 days in Helsinki itinerary, you’ll mostly need to use trams and some buses. The metro is generally only needed if you’re headed further afield.\n\nGoogle Maps was our app of choice to work out how to get around the city on public transport. It would always show us the quickest way to get around.\n\nIn addition to public transport, the centre of the city is very walkable. Most of this itinerary can be done with you walking between points of interest. Usually never more than 15 minutes at a time.\n\nFinally, like many cities around the world, Helsinki has public electronic scooters. So if you’re looking to get from A to B, these are always great fun and convenient.\n\n2 days in Helsinki\n\nAt a glance\n\nDay 1 || Visit Helsinki’s most famous landmarks || Check out a few of the city’s best museums || Dine on some local seafood\n\nDay 2 || Visit a UNESCO World Heritage site || Check out the city’s design scene || Relax at a sauna\n\nDay 1 – Morning\n\nGrab your breakfast and set off for an early start, because you’re in for a jam packed day!\n\nIf you’ve purchased your Helsinki card online and need to redeem your voucher, head to Hotel Seurahuone Helsinki. It is across the road from Helsinki Central Railway Station. If you’ve arrived the evening before, you can always grab it beforehand too.\n\nThe first stop on your itinerary is the Temppeliaukio Church, also known as the Rock Church. Get there right on opening, which in the peak periods is 9:30am. This is a stunning church that has been carved out of the natural bedrock. Have a seat and look up at the massive copper dome above you. It’s a serene and unique experience, and a great way to kick off your stay in Helsinki.\n\nFrom the church, make the 15 minute walk across to Kiasma. You could also walk to the nearby tram stop and catch the tram (either number 1 or 2).\n\nKiasma is the Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki. It will be the first of many museums we recommend in this 2 day itinerary. Kiasma puts on some impressive exhibits from Finnish and international artists. When we visited, it was most famous for its Nervescape installation by Shoplifter. Colourful hair, both real and fake are shaped in the air in a free flowing rainbow. It was a colourful, delightful and happy installation. Take a seat on a cushion or wander around at your own pace.\n\nFrom Kiasma, make your way across to Amos Rex. Only opened in August 2018, this is a newly minted museum on Helsinki’s museum scene. Wandering inside and into the exhibitions, it feels quintessentially Scandinavian. High ceilings, natural light creeping in through the skylights, and large open spaces. Amos Rex positions itself as installing exhibits which are “technically experimental contemporary art”, which is exactly what we experienced when we visited. We took about 30 minutes to see the highlights and enjoy the space. Once you’ve finished inside, walk around the back to the open square. The skylights form a unique outdoor playground, where children and big kids alike can climb atop the domes that rise up from the ground.\n\nFrom Amos Rex, it’s a 5 minute walk across to the HAM (Helsinki Art Museum).\n\nThe HAM Helsinki Art Museum is another museum which concentrates on fresh exhibitions. These generally have a modern and contemporary context. When we visited, there were some eclectic installations here, best described as ‘future forward’. In one exhibit, we dressed in white overalls and shoes covers to enter a white room. A very unique and interesting interactive exhibit.\n\nWith some serious museum viewing behind you, it’s time for lunch.\n\nDay 1 – Lunch\n\nFor lunch, we recommend heading to the Herkku Market Bistro in Stockmann, the leading department store in Finland. It is reminiscent of a Macy’s, Mark’s & Spencer’s or a David Jones. The bistro below the 8 floors of food and shopping though is unlike no other. For our Australian readers think another level of the David Jones Food Hall but with a Finnish twist and focus on seafood.\n\nNow eating in Finland is usually quite expensive. But if you want to try some Finnish cuisine which is high quality and a good price, head here. We enjoyed the catch of the day, gos, a white fish with broccolini, crayfish and dill for €9.95. Pound for pound, you’re unlikely to find a better value meal in Helsinki than that!\n\nThe chefs will cook it in front of you and serve it to your table or your seat at the benches. Enjoy a wine or beer as well if you’re feeling jovial.\n\nDay 1 – Afternoon\n\nOnce you’ve finished up at lunch, make the short walk to the Ateneum Art Museum. The Ateneum is a modern art museum, depicting artistic developments in Finnish culture since the early 1800s. There are a couple of lead exhibitions focusing on the 20th century. This in some respects was the coming of age of Finland. During this time, they fought in a number of wars in and around World War 2. A lot of the pieces from this era depict bright, vibrant paintings reflecting the hope the people of the time had for a better future. This was one of our favourite museums to learn about the history of Finland.\n\nOnce you’ve finished, walk a few minutes down to Senate Square. This impressive square houses a few of Helsinki’s finest buildings.\n\nIt is impossible to miss Helsinki’s most famous landmark, the Helsinki Cathedral. The brilliant white building with the green dome dominates the Helsinki skyline. You can enter the cathedral, but the real highlight is admiring its beauty from the outside.\n\nAcross the road, head into the National Library of Finland for a quick look inside. We’re always impressed with the beauty of the libraries around the world, some have been simply mesmerising. The National Library of Finland is no different. This library is a beauty, and we didn’t even read any books!\n\nThe centre room here is a rectangular room, with books around the outside and some magnificent frescoes. We visited in the height of summer and had the room to admire to ourselves. The reading rooms at either end of the centre room are for readers only. I don’t know how anyone does any research or reading in here when the surrounds are so stunning. You can still check them out, but have the courtesy of turning your phone off, not using your camera and be considerate of those working.\n\nFrom the National Library of Finland you’ll be making your way up to a different part of town. Walk across to Aleksanterinkatu to catch the tram (number 2 or 4). The next stop is the Sibelius Monument.\n\nThe Sibelius Monument is a dedication to one of Finland’s finest composers, Jean Sibelius. The monument is located in a park outside the centre of town. Shaped almost like an organ, walking underneath you can look up and sing, yell and have the pipes carry your voice. It’s a wonderful spot for photography too.\n\nA 2 minute walk from Sibileius, Cafe Regatta sits on the water, in a cute red hut. It’s a wonderful spot for an afternoon pick me up. An intimate place, you’ll need to duck your head on the way in. Serving coffee, hot chocolates, tea and a range of sweets, there are a few seats inside. But do as the locals do and sit outside, warmed by a fire, even on a cooler summer evening.\n\nIt’s a stunning place to enjoy a break as the sun rides lower over the horizon. If you’re feeling active, jump on a kayak which are available for hire.\n\nDay 1 – Dinner\n\nFor dinner this evening, we have two recommendations for you.\n\nWant a casual dinner with some beer? Head to Putte’s Bar and Pizzeria. This grungy establishment specialises in pizzas and is a hit with the locals. You might cringe at the price of €15 for a pizza, but this is Finland after all and nothing is cheap. This includes the beers which are in the €8-10 price range for a 500ml glass. Putte’s is also open late in the evening, so a great option if you’d prefer a break at your accommodation following the afternoon activities.\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick bite, head to Friends and Brgrs. This super popular burger joint is always busy, and with good reason. With burger rolls baked on site (enjoy watching those get cooked whilst you eat) these are burgers made with love. The patties are as tasty as they come. Be patient when in line. The freshness and quality takes time to produce, but I promise it will be worth it!\n\nDay 2 – Morning\n\nFor the second of your 2 days in Helsinki, grab your coffee and pastry fix at Ekberg 1852. Helsinki’s oldest (and arguably most famous) bakery has a take away section and a plush looking seating area. We grabbed a hot chocolate to go, but if we had room to eat, Jeff would have grabbed one of the delectable blueberry pies.\n\nWhen you’re ready, head down to Market Square. This is the spot to board the ferry across to Helsinki’s famous fortress, Suomenlinna.\n\nToday, Suomenlinna Sea Fortress is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most popular things to do in Helsinki (as the lines for the ferry might suggest). We’ve been across to this island in both winter and summer with contrasting experiences. On our first visit in winter, this very naïve Aussie almost froze to death with my unpreparedness for the cold. Nevertheless, I would only recommend a visit if you’re visiting in summer (or monitor the ferry schedule closely)!\n\nThe best thing to do here is wander around the former fortress. If you’ve purchased the Helsinki Card, you can also take advantage of a free walking tour and enter the museums on the island too. If you’d prefer to take things slow, there are many cafes on the island too. If you’re in need of supplies, there’s even a K Market just near the ferry terminal.\n\nGet the ferry back to Market Square in time for lunch.\n\nDay 2 – Lunch\n\nVisiting Market Square in summer compared to winter is a very different proposition. We first visited at the beginning of a very cold April. There were a few stalls, but not a lot, and certainly a lot less people.\n\nIn summer, this square comes to life. They almost don’t have enough room for every stall. There are stalls of fresh fruit and vegetables, seafood and arts and crafts. It’s a hive of activity, and a wonderful place to sample some Finnish delights, including Moose Pie.\n\nFor lunch, we’d recommend one of the BBQ seafood stalls. We enjoyed some fresh salmon accompanied by grilled vegetables and garlic sauce. It’s good value for Helsinki too at €13 for a massive plate. There are numerous vendors selling much the same, so I’d say it’s hard to go wrong with options here.\n\nDay 2 – Afternoon\n\nAfter lunch, stroll past the Allas Sea Pool. This open sea pool sits opposite the Suomenlinna ferry. If the weather is nice, it’s a great spot to go for a paddle. If you’d prefer to just soak up the sun, there are some deck chairs around to have a break.\n\nWalk across to the Uspenski Cathedral. This red brick Orthodox Church sits proudly upon its own hill. On a clear day, its gold tips shine in the light. The interior is relatively basic, but the exterior offers a lovely view back to Helsinki Cathedral.\n\nMake your way back down through the Market Square to go on a walk down the Esplanadi. It’s a wonderful green space with numerous statues to ponder. Take a left on Korkeavuorenkatu, as you’re about to explore the design district.\n\nNow, you can’t come to Scandinavia and not get to grips with their approach to design, it’s world famous! The Design Museum is a wonderful spot to get acquainted with Finnish design. There are numerous exhibitions detailing Finland’s world-leading designs. From the ball chair, Nokia mobile phones, glassware, and mobile games including Snake and Angry Birds, this country is powerhouse of innovative product design. Not all designs are equal however. The bike chair they designed to use a computer is a hilarious concept!\n\nNow it’s time to pop back to your accommodation to get ready for experiencing a Finnish tradition, the sauna. Finland, and Scandanavia have a love affair with the sauna. Don’t believe us? According to Finland’s tourism board, there are about 2 million saunas in Finland for a population just over 5 million. Sound crazy? Well, to us Aussies who have visited Finland at the end of winter, we can totally understand why!\n\nThere are numerous public saunas in Helsinki, but for your first experience we’d recommend the Löyly. Located right on the Baltic Sea, the first thing that will impress is the architecture of the building. It’s typical Scandinavian. The sauna here is mixed gender, so swimsuits are mandatory. There are 2 saunas which you can use, a smoke and a wood-burning sauna. Once you’re well and truly heated up, there’s the option to run outside and jump in the freezing cold Baltic Sea. Whilst I chickened out, Jeff did this multiple times and said it was totally refreshing.\n\nA visit to Löyly requires you to book in advance via their website. This ensures you have access to a locker for your belongings too. I recommend booking a 6pm – 8pm session, so you can go out to dinner afterwards. If you’re totally relaxed and don’t want to move, you can grab dinner at Löyly too.\n\nIf you’re not sure on Loyly, but want a great insight into Finnish sauna culture, check out our article on a Finnish sauna experience here.\n\nDay 2 – Dinner\n\nFor your last evening in Helsinki, we recommend spoiling yourself to a dinner out at Yes, Yes, Yes.\n\nIs it worthwhile trying this one out? Hint, it’s in the name- yes, yes, yes.\n\nThis is a vegetarian establishment with a creative menu. If you’re a traditional meat eater and typically steer clear of places like this, let us encourage you to make a visit.\n\nWe grabbed a seat at the bar and had the pleasure of watching every dish (ours and the rest of the restaurant) get churned out. This served us as a helpful way of choosing from the menu which had a wide selection of dishes.\n\nWe had 4 sharing plates between the two of us. The haloumi fries were perfect with a yoghurt topping and pomegranate. The zucchini and feta nuggets were a fried delight with the right mix of both ingredients. A flat bread with one of the dips (we had the tomato and almond) will add some flavour and carbs. If you still need some more carbs, you can’t go past the sweet potato. The crisp skin and sweet, moist interior are the perfect combination.\n\nWe wondered upon ordering if this would be enough, and for us, it hit the spot perfectly.\n\nNot the cheapest venue in town, but the produce is fresh and beyond tasty. To top it off, the service is attentive and friendly.\n\nWhen to visit Helsinki\n\nWe’ve visited Helsinki in 2 different seasons, and by far and away our favourite time of year was in summer. 2 days in Helsinki in the summer compared to the winter is an altogether different proposition.\n\nDuring July and August you’ll be blessed with long days of sunlight and fairly comfortable temperatures. The locals are out enjoying the weather, and it’s not uncommon to see people sunbathing in the local parks. The downside to this is that it’s the busiest time of year and prices are likely to be a little higher. Nevertheless, it’s still my favourite time to visit.\n\nWinter in Helsinki is very long. Most of the locals we spoke to would tell us how difficult this season can be for them. As a visitor, you’ll need to be very prepared, with suitable clothing. We struggled with the temperatures at the end of winter on our first visit, but only because we weren’t prepared. If you make sure you have your thermals, winter coat and proper boots, you’ll probably be fine.\n\nLike most of Europe, if you’re looking for the balance of okay weather, lower tourist numbers and better prices, consider spring or autumn.\n\nWhere to stay in Helsinki\n\nOne of the wonderful aspects about Helsinki is that it’s possible to stay in so many areas, given the ease of the public transport network. Where ever you choose to stay, just ensure it is near a tram or metro station.\n\nOn our most recent trip to Helsinki, we chose to stay close to the cruise terminal for the St Peter Line ferry. This was because we were catching a return ferry from Helsinki to St Petersburg. We stayed in two hotels near this terminal, and would highly recommend both.\n\nRadisson Blu Seaside Hotel\n\nOur stay at the Radisson Blu Seaside hotel was one of our most memorable ever. We were only staying here one night and were super lucky to be upgraded to a suite with a private sauna. Yes that’s right, our room came with its own sauna!\n\nOn top of this highly unique feature, our suite was fitted out with plush furnishings and a super comfy bed. The afternoon light streamed into our apartment making it that extra bit special.\n\nIf you’re looking to spoil yourself, consider booking a suite here.\n\nClarion Helsinki\n\nThe hotel closest to the West Ferry Terminal, the Clarion Helsinki has some spectacular high rise views back over the city. Helsinki Cathedral, Uspenski and Suomenlinna are all visible from up top.\n\nOn the 16th floor you’ve got the showpiece of this hotel- the pool which has a glass bottom. Not for the faint hearted, it’s an amazing place to take in the Helsinki skyline.\n\nRooms are spacious enough and designed in classic Scandic style.\n\nThe foyer is an enjoyable place to relax if you need to chill out. Good tunes, wifi and high glass windows that offer views of the harbour.\n\nOther things to consider on your stay in Helsinki\n\nThis 2 day itinerary is museum heavy. However, that’s because some museums will need longer than others. The length of time needed will also depend on your interest in the exhibition showing during your visit. Look up the museums before you depart to see which ones take your interest. On some days, the museums open until late too. So if you don’t fit it all in as per our itinerary, you may be able to go after dinner too.\n\nMaximise your Helsinki card\n\nMost of the activities we have included in this 2 day itinerary above are included in the Helsinki Card. The only activities that require payment and aren’t included are the Löyly sauna and your meals. However, there are so many more attractions that are included in the Helsinki Card that aren’t in our 2 day itinerary (purely due to time constraints!). For instance, if you’re travelling with kids, you might consider a visit to Sea Life. Check out all the attractions included to see if there is something else you’d love to do.\n\nIf you’re interested in local culture, see if you can fit in a visit to Oodi library during your 2 days in Helsinki. This library has a classic Scandanavian exterior with curved wood panelling. Unfortunately there was a stage set up on our visit, so we ventured inside to check out what a Finnish public library looks like. Now it’s been some time since we’ve been inside a public library, but this is like no public library we’ve ever been to. Video games, rows and rows of publicly available computers, sewing lessons , a music studio complete with instruments, VR rooms, meeting rooms and half a dozen 3D printers. The Finns pay high taxes to participate in their society, but there is no question that it appears to be invested quite well.\n\nCheck out pretty Huvilakutu Street\n\nIf you’d like some cute shots to add to your Instagram gallery, head to Huvilakutu Street. This street has a row of buildings in muted pastel colours. It’s an easy wander to take in some Finnish architecture. You’ll see the different ways the Finns try to bring colour to their everyday lives (particularly amongst the depths of winter). A visit here would work best prior to visiting Löyly sauna.\n\nFinally, if you’re looking for a funny picture, head to the Bad, bad boy statue. This statue is located opposite the West Terminal ferry. There’s a shopping centre here too. It’s easy to spot because if this is not the ugliest monument you’ve ever seen, I’d like to know what is. All that aside, it’s still worth checking out, but it’s, you know, a weird boy almost Frodo like, taking a wizz. A wicked sense of humour the Finns have!\n\nWe hope you have an amazing 2 days in Helsinki. If you have any questions or comments, we’d love to hear from you below.\n\nLike our 2 days in Helsinki itinerary? Pin it for later!"
