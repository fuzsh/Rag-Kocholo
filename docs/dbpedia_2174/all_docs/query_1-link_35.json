        "text": "Connor Harr\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n4 min read\n\n·\n\nOct 3, 2020\n\n--\n\nThe Helsinki Seagulls finished with one of the top PPP ratings on Synergy last season. The main reason for this was their Ball Screen Flow Offense. Euro Ball Screen Flows or continuity can come in various forms tweaked to your personnel, but I really took to this one personally because of the diversity within the offense. Here I will be diving into their offense and what makes it so hard to guard.\n\nSpacing\n\nFloor Should be spaced as follows\n\nSingle Side Deep corner\n\nBall Hander Elects a side from deep slot\n\nDouble Side Corner: Top Man- HIGH & WIDE, Low Man- Deep Corner\n\nBig: Set Ball Screen behind three point line if possible. Usually trailing. If not sprint into initial ball screen after rim run\n\nThe Drag\n\nDrag is the most common initiating action into the Seagulls Ball Screen Offense\n\nAlways set by Big Preferably on the trail, almost always set to the double side in an effort to get to next action\n\nScreening angles are very important in any ball screen, here the defender wants to go over the top on ball handler. Big screens upper half of the defender allowing an early advantage\n\nGoal: Create your early advantage as soon as possible & play in space.\n\nDrag to Double Side 2 Man Game\n\nSecond action in the Offense is the Empty Side Ball Screen\n\nCan be Ghosted, Flip , or a pass & chase. Will be initiated from top double side man.\n\nReason for his high and wide spacing will be so he can sprint into the 2 man game.\n\nWith big lifting after initial drag roll you are able to do two key things that are very hard to guard. 1. Make 5X the low man (Uncomfortable position for them) 2. Change the low man on big lift (similar to what you would see in the ball screen continuity ran by almost every collegiate program)\n\nDrag-Empty Side-Step Up\n\nEnding Action within the Offense is the step up ball screen from your big that set the drag\n\nIf no advantage is created on empty side ball screen you will swing back up to lead guard at the top of the key\n\nLead guard spacing on this catch is crucial, want to be at least 3 steps behind the three point line.\n\nLead guard wants to “stampede” the catch any chance he gets (catch with already building up downhill momentum on the drive)\n\nThe timing and angle of step up is important as well. If your guard stampede’s the catch you will want to set the screen at a low angle on the outside leg of the defender.\n\nSprinting into this step up makes it hard for big defender to be in the right position for any coverage. This will make it much more difficult to contain the downhill ball handler off the ending action.\n\nIverson Entry\n\nLike I mentioned previously, one of the great elements of this offense is how diverse it is. Here the Seagulls skip the drag and move into their flow offense from an Iverson Series instead, getting the same empty side-step up actions.\n\nDiamond Entry\n\nThe second entry the Seagulls like to run their offense out of is a diamond alignment. In the second video as well you can see what they go to when the lead guard is denied for the ending step up, their toss game or get action with the big. These different entries go extremely well with the Seagulls offense because many of their sets come from the same Iverson and Diamond alignments as well.\n\nStep Up Denial Option\n\nIf ball handler is denied for step up you will hit big looking to set step up screen.\n\nThe big will look to get into the “toss game” with the lead guard. If this isn’t open big will reverse back for an empty side ball screen.\n\nThe toss game is very hard to guard because it makes it difficult for a teams rim protector to guard. If the advantage is not created off the toss, the big can look to rescreen for a middle pick and roll.\n\nPotential Tweaks to Think about\n\nI love this offense, and it’s proven with a great track record last season it is wildly successful. If I was a coach in charge of an offense and not sure what I wanted to run, I would definitely consider this. However, this offense may not fit your personnel to a tee. Here are some potential ideas for adjustments you could make.\n\nNo second big: Flip or Ghost Screen into action instead of empty side. This will set up more opportunities for penetration. Hopefully, in an effort to receive a larger offensive advantage.\n\nAllowing your bigs to Pop- This may be my biggest gripe especially with the drop coverage you are faced with. By allowing your bigs to pop off the initial drag or step up, you may want to consider having some 5 out actions, concepts, or rules to go to.\n\nElbow Actions off Step up denial: If you do not have a ton of ball handlers that can successfully get into the lane and create advantages off the bonce, create them with play movement instead. Maybe add some Princeton elements to the big elbow throw in, when the guard is denied on the step up screen."
