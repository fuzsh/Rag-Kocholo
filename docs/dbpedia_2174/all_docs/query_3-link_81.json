        "text": "TRY\n\nWhat can you try in Helsinki, that you won’t find anywhere else?\n\nTRY SAUNA\n\nIn case you read it, you are likely to be a foreigner. Most likely, the only Finnish word you have ever heard then is “sauna”. Shockingly, it sort of means the same thing here as you would imagine. With the only difference that people usually go in naked and are allowed/read as expected/ to throw water on the hot stones. They are as close to everyday Finnish life as 6–15 euros can get you. In fact, every house in the country is usually having at least one sauna used by the residents. Here is a short list of alternative saunas you can visit.\n\nKultuurisauna\n\nKultuurisauna is a place owned by a Finnish-Japanese couple. A traditional sauna combined with Japanese minimalism in architecture. Mix-gender resting area. A chance to dip into the bay in between sauna turns. If you pick your own towel it gets a bit cheaper. This place is an artwork. So much so, that even the trivial interior elements are made custom.\n\nIf you want to pay for something special in Helsinki — I recommend you to stop here for the whole evening.\n\nLöyly\n\nLöyly is a new hip place on the shore. Visit it just to have a nice view from its double-deck terrasse. This place you visit to experience new architecture and have a great view when you run out to the bay to have a dip. The building is certainly a looker and the view to the bay is one of the most beautiful skylines within the city center. Yet, if you prefer to stay away from unreasonably pricy bars and the crowds dressed in “brands” — maybe skip the drink here. The atmosphere in Löyly is stiff. In Russian, we say: The air inside is so thick, you can hang an ax on it.\n\nSwimming Pools\n\nMäkelänrinne Swimming Pool is one of the most visited swimming pools in Europe. A basic pool ticket gives you 2.5 hours visit. You are free to spend all this time in between three saunas that they have in the shower area. The saunas are great even though they are not the core purpose of the place. This is probably the cheapest and the most laid-back way to get in touch with a tradition.\n\nPublic Saunas\n\nPublic Saunas in Kallio (e.g. Harju Sauna) are the washrooms of the old proletarian district. Back in the days when factory workers didn’t have showers in their small flats, they would have plenty of public saunas. Some of them are working until today. Prices are a bit too high, but the experience is still very low key. If you want to seat barechested and red-faced on the street and watch trams pass by while having a sip of a beer — that’s your place.\n\nSompa sauna\n\nSompa Sauna is an ultimately hippy experience. The place is run by the enthusiasm of random stranger which keeps it free of charge and full of unexpected audience. One has to have balls to try it out, but hey — we only live once.\n\nTRY STAYING ZEN\n\nHelsinki is the best when you simply chill. There are plenty of places where you can aim to spend time without a certain aim.\n\nWinter Garden Greenhouse\n\nWinter Garden Greenhouse is an old school promenade in the center. Free of charge. Very nice light during the noon hours.\n\nEAT\n\nWhat can you eat in Helsinki?\n\nEAT ON UNDER 10€\n\nWell, cheap food is virtually non-existent in Helsinki (unless you are come from Copenhagen or Dubai). But there are a few places with below 10€ tags for a meal.\n\nBarbarossa\n\nThis is a pizza-kebab place hidden in the very centre of the city. 5€ will get you vegetarian falafel or a large pizza with all the standard toppings. You will find it in Kamppi shopping center next to Lidl. It is terrible. But it is 5€.\n\nSoma\n\nSoma is a small chain serving sushi-burrito rolls for under 10€. Those are great if you are looking for something moderately healthy and strictly vegan.\n\nSoiSoi\n\nSoiSoi vegetarian/vegan place (with a few meat options too). Sandwiches are good, perhaps, not the best (you can ask for various bun options if you are allergic or just want a rye bun). The greatest thing here is sweet potato fries. Ask for mango souce along with them.\n\nKipsari\n\nKipsari a vegetarian student place in Arabia. They serve the best tofu sandwiches you can find. Also, two hot meal for you to choose from and a salad bar are served as an alternative. It has moved to Aalto University new campus in Espoo. If you wanted to check the uni out — grab a bite in Kipsari. They also have their own cookbook on sale, if you’d like what you taste.\n\nUnicafe\n\nUnicafe Ylioppilasaukio the largest student diner in town owned by the student union of Helsinki University. Several hot dishes or a salad bar to choose from. Just ask any of the students how the line works. It’s a self-service place with a check-out.\n\nRupla\n\nhas nice offers on lunches several times a week. Also offers “all you can eat“ cake buffet for 8–10e on Saturdays (highly recommended).\n\nEAT A PROPER DINNER\n\nHarju 8\n\nis one of the recent additions to the gentrifications scene of Kallio. It is pretty relaxed and serene in the daytime. At the same time, at night (it is open till 2am) it becomes very vibrant collecting some of the very hip people. It is January 2019, so if you are reading it way later — it might be the old boring thing then. The price tag is not the most satisfactory. But the mood worths it, if you want to have a good evening and a thoughtfully made main course.\n\nNew Bamboo Centre\n\nis one of the loudest and the most cheerful places in the city. They have one of these extremely long menus of Chinese dishes that you never wanna read through when you are hungry. Very large portions that can be easily split in two (in this case you pay for an extra rice). Check the menu of the day, it is always much cheaper than ordering a few dishes. However, if you are only taking the main course, go for something new to you.\n\nSandro & Kok\n\nare both the fusion kitchen restaurants with a few spots in town. They serve interesting menus as well as very personal and laid-back service. At the same time, the places are leaning towards a refined experience, so they are suitable for getting your partner’s fancy parents out. During the weekend it makes sense to make a booking — these places are popular.\n\nMei Lin\n\nThis is yet another Chinese. Claimed to be the most authentic by all the Chinese friends of mine. It has a large off-menu selection, so if you know what you want or if the menu is not enough — ask a waiter for a bit of advice.\n\nGandhi\n\nis an Indian restaurant. Very laid back and very friendly. The price tag is not exactly the lightest to lift if you travel on the budget, but the portions are generous. Garlic naan is very well recommended.\n\nBurgher’s House. Pay attention to the bread dry-stored on the stick under the roof. This way if very typical in the North. You can visit dry bread in any Helsinki supermarket and find these traditional loaves on the shelf until this very day. Photo CC BY-NC sasha is sasha, 2018\n\nCAFE\n\nWell, these places are plenty around town. There are few I can name just for a start, but suit yourself on this matter.\n\nCasa Italia\n\nis, probably, the only place I truly like these days. The stuff there cares to remain human. The coffee tastes like coffee. Hot chocolate is more than just cacao powder fused with hot water. It is extremely small, though, so if you like grand spaces it isn’t for you.\n\nLa Torrefazione\n\nis a coffee place in the very centre. Here you can look at the Russian tourists shopping cheap H&M and Zara clothes one floor above one of the busiest streets. This place is most often crowded, but if you let a waiter know how many you are, most often you get a place soon. These guys always have nice tea, thick hot chocolate and reasonable coffee.\n\nRegatta\n\nis a super home-like cafe on a sea side. Have cash with you. Get a bun and grill some food on the open fire outside. Great for a sunny day or just as a break on your walk along the western shore.\n\nStory\n\nat the old Kauppahalli (Close to the Market square), mostly nice due to the old market hall itself. Otherwise a typical chain cafe. Overpriced for what is served.\n\nIpi Kulmakuppila\n\nKarhupuisto (Finnish for “a Bear Park”), is a place with plenty of cafes and bars around. Ipi cafe stands out with its great design, nice offering, and friendly staff. The concept of the place is generally interesting, you can find out more about it online. You also can enjoy a great view onto the1912 Kallio Library (to which you may pay a visit before or after).\n\nSEE\n\nWhat is there to see in Helsinki?\n\nSEE THE MUSEUMS\n\nHelsinki City Museum\n\nHelsinki Museum offers a free-entrance small show in the very center on the Senate Square. An interactive display telling about the city history. Your chance for some good selfies in a replica of a 1960s old lady flat. On the first floor, perhaps, the best souvenir store you will find in town. On the last floor — temporary shows connected to Helsinki. Drop by for about an hour. It’s good for groups too. There is a very fixed list of the museums within the city area.\n\nIf you are a frequent visitor of contemporary art venues — I would not recommend any of the art museums here. What you get does not match the price. However if the whole scene is new to you, it may worth taking a look.\n\nKansallismuseo, The National Museum\n\noffers a mildly interactive permanent exhibition with all too familiar subjects: medieval times of colonization (by Swedes and Russian) and early written culture. Exiled not so rich nobles. Industrialization. Politics, politics, politics. Consumer era. Climate change. But if you choose to go — you are up for a good time and some nice Instagram shots.\n\nA ProTip: If you do not want to pay a crazy lot, but still want to seem like you’ve touched the Finnish culture, you can visit the main foyer of Kansalismuseo. It is for free and it has an epic dome painting by Akseli Gallen-Kallela. He was a super-duper stereotypical National Romanticist. Very Finland, much fairytale.\n\nTake a picture and move on. You can also pass through the Foyer of Finlandia-talo (a huge white concert hall across the road from the museum). Finlandia-talo is one of the “postcard” staples of the Helsinki tours. What remains little known to the tourists is that everything up to the smaller details of the houses built by Alvar Aalto’s project have been thought through by him. For example, pay attention to the purposely bendy door handles on the main doors. These were actually designed by Aalto himself. They are also used on Kirjatalo (main book store) house designed by him. If you are bored, you can have a game. Go take photographs of the smallest interior details in Finlandia-talo and then try to find the same ones in Kirjatalo. You will. And yes, “talo” means “a house” in Finnish.\n\nHAM, Helsinki Art Museum.\n\nAt times has interesting works on display. Some big names like Ai Wei Wei, for example. If you want to visit “an art show” (without much preference) during the time in Helsinki — it is a good place to do so.\n\nThink Corner\n\nThink Corner or Tiedekulma is a recent addition to the family of the Helsinki University campus buildings in the city center. You will find it right near the main cathedral. While cathedral is nothing special and copies hundreds of the churches around central Europe — Think Corner is a unique project. The main atrium is cast in concrete and has a fantastic space open for public. Other areas open into one another and are filled with students and guests of the campus minding their own business. It is not a corridor you pass on your way to the class. It is a modern place to live, a place to spend your time while you are trying to master a new skill. University hosts plenty of open lectures in here, just check their website if you want to attend one.\n\nWest Metro Line\n\nIn 2018 Helsinki has finally gotten its West-wards metro line extension. It has a long story of bureaucratic stupidity behind, that has thrown the delivery deadlines several times and made this extension equally terrible for those who live in the West of the municipality as it is good for those who live right next to the new line.\n\nShould you take a tour through the new stations (everything to the west of Ruoholahti station), pay attention to the length of the platforms. Originally Helsinki was supposed to have a fully automated self-driving metro. This would have allowed carrying more passengers at shorter intervals. The plan was great, and for this plan to become reality we needed automatic doors on the platforms (the safety measure). The doors were tested and passed the test. The tender was in action and cost Helsinki a lot of money (just like the whole project). But then the bureaucracy has caused delays and the provider of the doors has asked for the additional work to be paid. Suddenly the administration of the city went mad and declined the plans of having automatic doors altogether. The expensive project was tossed to the bin and human-driven trains confirmed for the line."
