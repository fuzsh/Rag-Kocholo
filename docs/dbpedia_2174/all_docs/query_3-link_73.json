        "text": "Welcome to Finland!\n\nHelsinki is often dubbed one of the world’s most liveable cities due to its vibrant nature and delicate balance of historic architecture and contemporary living. Make your own way to the hotel and spend the afternoon on your own exploring the city and discovering the many hidden gems, cafes and restaurants dotted around the city centre.\n\nIn the evening, you will have the opportunity to meet your fellow travellers and tour escort for an included welcome dinner as you prepare to follow the Northern Lights through Finland and Norway.\n\nOn our first full day, we'll embark on a coach tour of the city and learn more about Helsinki’s past and present from our English-speaking guide.\n\nHighlights include the City Hall, the Parliament buildings, Finlandia Hall, the Opera House and, weather permitting, the popular Sibelius monument.\n\nAnother iconic stop on the tour is a visit to the Tempeliaukio Church, built into the bedrock of the city it has also become known as the ‘Church of Rock’ and a nod to the city's modern culture.\n\nIn the morning we set out from Helsinki and start our journey towards Finnish Lapland and the arctic wilderness. Jump on board the train from Helsinki to Rovaniemi - the reputed home of Santa Claus. As the train winds north gaze upon snow-capped forests and a true winter wonderland.\n\nArriving in Rovaniemi, we are now in the capital of Finnish Lapland, where you will have the afternoon to explore this quaint town at your leisure. At night, keep your eyes on the skies as we are above the arctic circle, the chances of spotting the Northern Lights increase.\n\nWake up in the heart of Lapland and prepare for our first authentic experience, a meeting with the cute furry locals at a husky kennel. Learn about how huskies are reared to become as fit and as hardy as the local Sami people who have worked with these iconic arctic heroes for many years. After getting to know these animals we will enjoy lunch before joining a thrilling husky-drawn cart or sled ride through the Lapland wilderness with your new furry friends.\n\nAfter spending the day living like a local, warm up with a hot drink at Lappish Kota, a traditional wooden hut dawned with reindeer hides and a roaring fire.\n\nFeel like a child again as we spend the morning exploring the wonderous Santa Claus Village, and even get to meet the man himself!\n\nIn the afternoon we continue our journey north making a short stop to see the Sodankylä Old Church before continuing to the Northern Lights Village of Saariselkä. Upon arrival, be wowed at your accommodation for the night – your very own Aurora Cabin or Glass Igloo where you can watch the Northern Lights from your bed whenever they appear.\n\nFollowing the included dinner at the hotel, we’ll be welcomed into the traditional tent of a local Sámi family who’ll talk enthusiastically about their unique culture and lifestyle. Feed the family’s reindeer in the nearby paddock or practise your lasso skills under your host’s expert tutelage. Weather permitting, we will also enjoy a reindeer sleigh ride. If you are really lucky, you can even catch a glimpse of the Northern Lights on this authentic Arctic experience.\n\nAs we continue North through the Finnish Lapland we arrive in the small township of Inari, the Sami capital (traditional nomads of Scandinavia, reindeer herders). On our stop in Inari, we will visit the newly renovated SIIDA museum - which is home to a collection featuring the spiritual and material culture of the Finnish Sami presented to the public through exhibitions and publications.\n\nIn the afternoon we cross into Norway and arrive at the iconic Snowhotel in Kirkenes, where you have the opportunity to join an optional excursion, choosing from activities such as king crab or Northern Lights safaris. Spend the night inside a traditional Gamme cabin, inspired by the traditional hunting and fishing hut known as ‘gamme’ which are typically found in the Lapland wilderness. Tonight’s included dinner is in the unique farmhouse restaurant, Låven.\n\nYour voyage onboard the Coastal Express begins in the Arctic in the town of Kirkenes. Our first port of call is Vardø and its iconic star-shaped Vardøhus Fortress, built-in 1737. The northernmost fortification of any kind, it remains a part of the military to this day. Weather permitting, brave swimmers may want to take a dip in the icy Arctic Ocean (strictly optional of course!).\n\nWe cruise Norway’s coastline to arrive in the small port of Båtsfjord in the evening and then on to Berlevåg. You might be able to make out Mount Tanahorn to the west, or see Kjølnes Lighthouse blinking atop a cliff overlooking the Barents Sea. These two idyllic ports are home to Norway’s most famous male choir, comprising local fishermen.\n\nWe make a late-night stop at Mehamn, where there is the option to join snowmobile trip through the vast Arctic wilderness. A great opportunity to experience snowy plains and valleys, crisp winter air under the Northern Lights in the starry sky above.\n\nDuring the day we pass through various ports including Honningsvåg and Hammerfest where you can visit the UNESCO-listed Meridian Column, erected in 1854 to honour the first precise geographic measurement of the globe.\n\nLate in the evening, we arrive at Tromsø, in time to enjoy a magical Northern Lights concert at the Arctic Cathedral in winter (optional).\n\nThis morning, we arrive at Harstad, where you can join one of our optional classic excursions - A Taste of Vesterålen. Discover the history, beautiful scenery, and cultural heritage sites of this iconic and breathtaking landscape. Those who stay on the ship experience our passage through the Risøyrenna, a shallow channel built for Hurtigruten in the 1920s.\n\nPrepare for some amazing scenery as we sail through the world-famous islands of Lofoten and Vesterålen. Lofoten is known for its natural beauty, steep mountains, wilderness and picturesque fishing villages. After a short stop at the tiny village of Risøyhamn, we continue to Stokmarknes, where Hurtigruten began in 1893.\n\nContinuing south, it will look like we’re headed straight into a mountain, but don’t worry, we are in fact sailing through a passage into the narrow Raftsund, flanked by peaks rising 1000m out of the sea. If that wasn't enough, we arrive at amazing Trollfjord. If conditions allow, we will sail between sheer cliffs that seem close enough to reach out and touch. It’s an unforgettable experience!\n\nWe then cross over the Arctic Circle just after breakfast. Commemorate the moment with a tradition of tasting a spoonful of good ol’ cod liver oil!\n\nSailing along the Helgeland coast, you see the strange mountain, Torghatten, famous for the distinctive hole through its centre. There is a local legend as to why and how this mountain came to have such a hole. Make sure you ask your Coastal Expert about it!\n\nAnother highlight is sailing past the Seven Sisters mountain range. It is easy to see how the peaks influenced ancient legends. The story goes that seven beautiful troll sisters were caught out at sunrise and turned to stone, thus creating the seven beautiful mountaintops.\n\nEven though we’re south of the Arctic Circle, there may still be good opportunities to see the Northern Lights.\n\nToday you have a chance to explore the wooden city of history: Trondheim. Be sure to visit the majestic Nidaros Cathedral, built over the burial site of King Olav II who reigned from 1015 to 1028. Treat yourself to quality coffee and a Nordic patisserie in one of the Bakklandet district’s many chic cafés then walk up to Kristiansten Fort for great views of Norway’s third-largest city.\n\nAs we sail along the coast, you will realise the importance of fishing to Norway’s coastal communities. Kristiansund is regarded as Norway’s ‘dried cod capital’ because of its long-time export of salted dry fish. An interesting excursion is to the Bergtatt marble mine, which takes you inside a mountain and across an illuminated subterranean lake before serving you a meal in the mine´s ‘Grand Hall’.\n\nDuring the night, the ship calls at Ålesund, Torvik and Måløy, as our voyage draws to a close. Before docking in Bergen, there is fascinating scenery to experience, including picturesque Nordfjord beneath Jostedal Glacier.\n\nA few nautical miles south of Florø, we cross the mouth of the mighty Sognefjord, taking in superb views of the magnificent island-studded coastline en route. In the early afternoon, we arrive in the Hanseatic city of Bergen where our time on the Coastal Express comes to an end. After disembarkation we join our private coach for a city tour including a walking tour of the UNESCO World Heritage listed Bryggen, St Mary’s Church, and Håkon’s Hall, before heading to Troldhaugen, the home of Norway’s most famous composer, Edvard Grieg.\n\nAfter arrival at the hotel the evening is yours to enjoy and explore this vibrant city. One recommendation is to take the Fløibanen funicular to the top of nearby Mount Fløyen to enjoy views of Bergen and the surrounding mountains.\n\nToday enjoy an amazing journey by rail, coach and ferry on the famous ‘Norway in a Nutshell’ route between Bergen and Oslo. We start with a rail journey from Bergen to Voss, from here we travel by coach to Gudvangen - where waterfalls line the road as we weave our way through the valley.\n\nIn Gudvangen board a ferry and enjoy a fjord cruise along the narrow and dramatic UNESCO protected Nærøyfjord, ending in the quaint village of Flåm. As we climb three thousand feet to the mountain train station of Myrdal, you will understand why this is considered one of the world’s most scenic rail journeys. From here we continue south to our final stop in Oslo.\n\nEnjoy breakfast in the hotel and prepare for our final full day on tour.\n\nOn our coach tour learn more about this vibrant European city, as we journey through the history of Oslo, from the world's largest sculpture park by a single artist - Vigeland Sculpture Park to the site of the 1952 Winter Olympics and the Holmenkollen Ski Jump.\n\nThe afternoon is your to continue exploring before joining your fellow travellers and tour escort for our final farewell dinner in a local restaurant."
