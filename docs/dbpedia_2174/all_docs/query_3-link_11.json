In the easternmost region of Europe, Finland sits at the western edge of the vast Siberian boreal forest and offers a variety of northern forest birds rarely found in other parts of Europe. Owl, grouse, woodpeckers and waders abound here along with a selection of eastern passerines offering birding rewards like nowhere else in Europe.\n\nOur tour is designed for the best chances to see Europe’s famed owls: Great Gray Owl, Ural Owl, Tawny Owl, Tengmalm’s (Boreal) Owl and Pygmy Owl. Our local guides monitor these species throughout the winter and early spring and have the best knowledge on where to find these magnificent birds. In addition to owls, we’ll search out Hazel Grouse, Willow Grouse and Capercaillie in the forests around Kuusamo as well as Three-toed Woodpecker, Siberian Jay, Siberian Tit, Pine Grosbeak, Red-flanked Bluetail, Arctic Warbler, and Little and Rustic Buntings to name a few.\n\nFor more adventure, this tour joins our Norway tour to explore north of the Arctic Circle in Lapland and the great wilderness of the Varanger peninsula. Here, spectacular mountain peaks, steep fjords and glaciers offer opportunities to see White-tailed Eagle, Rock Ptarmigan, Dotterel, Red-necked Phalarope and thousands of ducks and seabirds. The towering sea cliffs of Hornoya, the “bird island” are home to breeding Thick-billed Murre, Shag, Atlantic Puffin, and Black-legged Kittiwake creating an awesome spectacle. The rocky coast and Barent’s Sea offer Yellow-billed Loon, King and Steller’s Eider, Long-tailed Jaeger and more.\n\nJoin us for an arctic birding adventure that features stunning landscapes and fantastic photo opps for birders!\n\nDay 1\n\nOur tour starts in the city of Oulu in northern Finland. Oulu is serviced by Finnair and Norwegian air via connecting flights from Helsinki, Finland. There are plenty of flight options as Oulu is Finland's second busiest airport. The city is located on the shores of the Bay of Bothnia in the Oulunjoki River delta. Oulu is the largest city in Northern Finland and the capital of northern Scandinavia. A thriving city, Oulu is the gateway to the nature of the region. Today is purely an arrival day but if we have enough time, we will make an excursion to see some local species. Three nights Oulu.\n\nDays 2-3\n\nThe Oulu Region is best known for its breeding owls, which include Eagle, Ural, Great Gray, Tengmalm’s, Short-eared and Pygmy Owl, and in most years Hawk and Long-eared Owl. A good vole year will offer our best chances for seeing these birds and our local guides know where to find them.\n\nThe huge Great Gray Owl is one of the most sought after of this family and we’ll hope to experience those piercing yellow eyes looking at us from the branches of a dead tree. At the other end of the scale is Europe’s smallest owl, Eurasian Pygmy Owl, which can often be whistled out of the tree canopy. With Ural, Tengmalm’s, Eagle, Long and Short-eared and stunning Hawk Owls possible, our time here is sure to be unforgettable. We shall spend these two days in the forest and have an excellent chance of seeing the birds at close range. As we search, we’ll hope to encounter the other forest species here including Black Grouse, Capercaillie, Black Woodpecker, and Three-toed Woodpecker.\n\nWhile in Oulu, we will also visit Finland's most important wetland, the Bay of Liminka, a globally important waterfowl habitat. Here we will scan for Curlew, Greenshank, Spotted Redshank, Ruff, Little Ringed Plover, Caspian Tern, Black-tailed Godwit, Shoveler and Garganey. Bitterns can be heard booming and Red-backed Shrike breeds here. Numerous migratory birds come here to rest and Terek Sandpiper and Citrine Wagtail are rare breeding birds in the area. In the Bay of Liminka there are seven observation towers providing ideal vantage points. There are also vast areas of peat lands that serve as important nesting sites for Common Crane, Taiga Bean Goose, Wood and Broad-billed Sandpipers and Jack Snipe.\n\nDay 4\n\nToday, we will drive eastward to the small city of Kuusamo near the Russian border. Our journey will take us through the beautiful northern landscape of forests, bog lands, lakes and rivers. We’ll make some birding and scenery stops along the way arriving in late afternoon. Kuusamo is known for its natural beauty. The city lies on an elevated plateau where 90% of the land area is forested with pine and spruce as well as some deciduous trees. Fells and forests stretch as far as the eye can see with lakes, rivers and rapids adding a sparkling component to the spectacular countryside. Forestry, reindeer husbandry, winter sports, and tourism are the main activities here and we will explore the area in its spring finery. Three nights Kuusamo.\n\nDays 5-6\n\nFor the next two days, we can expect to encounter a real feast for the eye in the expansive taiga forests. Eastern specialties are on tap here including Red-flanked Bluetail, Rustic Bunting, Red, Parrot, Two-barred (White-winged) Crossbill, Siberian Jay, Black and Three-toed Woodpecker, Black Grouse, Willow Grouse, Hazel Grouse, Capercaillie, Red-necked Grebe and Little Gull, all of which breed here. This is the only European nesting area for a number of eastern specialties such as Gray-headed Chickadee (Siberian Tit), Greenish and Arctic Warbler, Red-flanked Bluetail, Little and Rustic Buntings which will be given high priority. The terrain is mostly easy to walk but will involve one or two uphill climbs particularly for Red-flanked Bluetail.\n\nThis is the western-most extreme of this boreal Siberian forest type and it holds many rare plants and birds. During our stay we should find breeding Red-necked Grebe, Arctic Loon, wildfowl including Smew and White-winged (Velvet) Scoter. Shorebirds such as European Golden Plover, Common Greenshank, Green Sandpiper and Spotted Redshank are here as are Fieldfare, Willow and Crested Tits, and White-throated Dipper. In the bogs, we have more chances to find Jack Snipe and Broad-billed Sandpiper.\n\nDay 7 – End of FINLAND: OWLS, GROUSE & MORE!\n\nFly home from Kuussamo Airport or continue to Lapland & Varanger>\n\nPhotos, top to bottom: Capercaillie,Great Gray Owl, Oulu landscape, Great Gray Owl, Northern Hawk Owl with chick by Gina Nichol; Common Cranes, Willow Grouse by Steve Bird; Siberian Jay and Whooper Swan by Gina Nichol; Below: Black Woodpecker by Steve Bird."
