        "text": "Suomenlinna (Sveaborg in Swedish) is a sea fortress located in Helsinki harbour and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Suomenlinna has a long history and was originally built by the Swedes in 1748 as a defence against a Russian attack. Over the years it has been controlled by Sweden, Russia and Finland and it is now one of the main attractions in Helsinki and one of the most popular places to visit when in Finland.\n\nA trip to Suomenlinna is an ideal half day or even full day trip when in Helsinki and it was definitely high on the list of places we wanted to visit when we visited Finland last year. In this blog post and travel guide I have written as much information, tips and advice as I can to help you when planning your own visit to Suomenlinna.\n\nTo get to Suomenlinna you will need to take the ferry from the Market Square (Kauppatori) and the dock is located opposite the Presidential Palace. As the ferry is part of the regular Helsinki transportation system and Suomenlinna is located in Zone A, you will need to purchase an AB ticket using either the ticket machines located at the dock or the very easy and simple to use HSL app. As of October 2021 the current AB single ticket fares are:\n\nAdult €2.80\n\nChild (7-17) €1.40\n\nChild (Aged 0-6) Free of Charge\n\nThe 4km ferry journey from the Market Square to the main ferry dock on Suomenlinna takes a very quick fifteen minutes and you can enjoy some great views of Helsinki along the way – we had blue skies when we left the city however they did not last long. There is both indoor and outdoor seating on the ferry in case you need to shelter from any weather or the hoards of seagulls which follow the ferry across the harbour.\n\nThere is no entrance fee to visit Suomenlinna itself however you will need to pay for the return ferry crossing as well as any of the six museums which each have their own separate entrance charge. But if like us you just want to walk around and explore, this makes for a very cheap and affordable day out – it was fun just to wander around and see what we could find.\n\nSuomenlinna is open all year round however not all of the museums, cafes and restaurants are open during the winter. You can check in advance what is open and the hours by checking the Suomenlinna website before you go.\n\nIf you want to visit when everything is open, make sure to visit in the summer months however the downside is that it will be very busy so getting to Suomenlinna as early as possible in the day to beat the crowds is recommended. As we visited in October 2021, it was very quiet during our trip so we could have a lay in and head to the ferry dock after a lazy breakfast at our hotel. You can check the ferry schedules here. The ferries run throughout the day from morning until evening although they operate more frequently in the summer at peak times.\n\nAlthough there was plenty of other people on the ferry with us, it was still very quiet the day we visited and once we arrived on Suomenlinna, the other people quickly disappeared in different directions and it immediately felt like you had the islands almost to yourself. There is a small K-Market supermarket close to the dock where you can buy drinks and snacks (or you can bring something with you) so you can have a small picnic whilst you are there if the weather is good. You will also find the information office where you can collect a map of Suomenlinna.\n\nOnce on Suomenlinna, it is small enough to explore on foot however there are a lot of cobblestone paths so make sure to wear decent and supportive shoes as your feet will be hurting otherwise. There are no cars on Suomenlinna (and only eight hundred residents) but you will see a few service vehicles whilst you are there.\n\nTo start exploring we followed the signs for the Blue Route which runs from the ferry dock to King’s Gate and passes all of the main sights such as Suomenlinna Church, the Suomenlinna Museum (the only museum open all year round), the Great Courtyard, the Dry Dock, Piper’s Park and Kustaanmiekka. The Blue Route is one mile long and is clearly marked with blue signposts (in Finnish, Swedish and English) and a blue line on the map and it is impossible to get lost.\n\nWhen on Suomenlinna in the cold winter months remember to wrap up warm and wear plenty of layers as well as a hat, scarf and gloves. The weather got progressively worse during our visit (it had been bright blue skies when we left Helsinki) but it did not bother us as we went prepared for bad weather. If you do need to take shelter for a few minutes, stop in one of the cafes to warm up – I had an oat latte there that was to die for.\n\nAs it was so quiet during our visit, it was very easy to get photos without anyone in them especially at King’s Gate – something which is probably close to impossible in the busy summer months.\n\nAs the weather got worse that day, a mist descended over Suomenlinna making the Kustaanmiekka area seem very dreamlike – It was like a fairytale and something out of a movie and it did not look real. Bad weather is not always bad when you get to see scenes like this. It really was a beautiful place that was very easy to explore and where you can relax and take your time and enjoy your surroundings and the peace and quiet without the need to do anything.\n\nAfter we had finished exploring Suomenlinna we made our way back to the ferry dock past the small beach and via the Vesikko submarine to travel back to Helsinki and the real world. We spent three hours on the islands but could easily have spent longer if the weather had been better. If leaving Suomenlinna late in the day, remember to check what time the last ferry leaves for Helsinki so you do not miss it."
