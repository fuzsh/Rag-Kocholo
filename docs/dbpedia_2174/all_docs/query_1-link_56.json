        "text": "Finland\n\nSummer in Finland.\n\nIf cities had human characteristics, Helsinki would be a very decent, cultured, politically correct, orderly city, a bit stiff at first, but you know he’s hiding something. The type of city that you address with respect, in whose company you feel special. I almost had the honour of being here.\n\nHelsinki is surrounded by an archipelago of hundreds of tiny islands and the sound of seagulls is constantly present yet it’s so polished that street musicians perform classical pieces on the streets. Since the first impression is often deceiving, Helsinki also has a vibrant and laid-back seaside atmosphere, very long summer days and beautiful sunsets.\n\nIt is so much easier to focus on details when everything around me is arranged and organised according to some logic. I really enjoyed discovering inspiring architecture and public spaces, I came to my senses. And each day after the exploring, I would do what all Finns do, drink glass of wine first, then relax in the sauna. When in Rome…\n\nI hope you like this little photo diary I put together to share my time adventuring through Helsinki. Let me know if you have visited Finland and how did you like it. If anyone has any feedback I’d be so appreciative to receive your comments and questions below. ♥︎ Unta\n\nExplore more:"
