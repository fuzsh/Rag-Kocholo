        "text": "Helsinki, Finland has always been a place that I did not expect to visit, and I have no idea why. Perhaps because I have always imagined the mountainous and remote areas of Norway (which I have yet to visit). Finland’s capital city, Helsinki, is in many ways like any other city you may visit. However, its history and architecture are enough to draw in any adventurous or knowledge-seeking traveler.\n\nHelsinki’s laid-back vibe and quiet yet welcoming people had me feeling like this is a place that a quiet person like myself fits in. The city sits at the southernmost point of Finland and is a port city with ships that set out to places such as St. Petersburg, Estonia and Sweden. The public transportation is simple, yet the city is walkable with plenty of green spaces to explore. While the city itself is fun to explore, you can also venture out to one of Helsinki’s 300 islands for a day or a half-day trip.\n\nWith any number of possibilities, Helsinki will keep you entertained no matter what you seek. These are some of the best things to do and see in and around Helsinki, Finland.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links. If you make a purchase though one of these links I will make a small commission at no extra cost to you. I appreciate any purchases made!\n\nHelsinki Cathedral\n\nPerhaps the most notable work of architecture in Helsinki, The Helsinki Cathedral sits in Senate Square where you will also find the main building of Helsinki University (which holds a museum) and the Government Palace (or Prime Minister’s Office).\n\nThis symmetrical cathedral with its green domes was originally built in honor of Nicholas I, Tsar of Russia in 1852. Finland used to be a part of Russia (The Great Duchy of Finland), and the design is based on the Saint Isaac Cathedral of Saint Petersburg.\n\nIt is free to enter if you are interested. They hold regular church services and special events. You can also visit the crypt in the Summer when Café Krypta opens. They also hold concerts and exhibits in this space.\n\nUspenski Cathedral\n\nHelsinki is host to many cathedrals and churches that I consider to be architectural marvels. It is impossible for this red brick structure with green roofs and golden cupolas to not catch your eye. Russian design is obvious.\n\nUspenski is the largest Orthodox church in Western Europe and it sits atop a hill overlooking both the city and the water.\n\nThis cathedral is also free to enter. I very much enjoyed walking around the outside, across a bridge covered in locks, and along the water where boats were docked.\n\nHelsinki Market Square\n\nIf a city has a market, I will find it. Markets are the best places to experience a new culture in an unfamiliar place.\n\nFrom giant frying pans full of small fish (Finnish minnows, I learned), to stalls with amazing rye bread with butter, there is so much good food to be found in the market. You can also find locally made souvenirs to take home with you. Snag a sample of the fried fish, just watch out for eager seagulls.\n\nI recommend visiting early before the crowds come in. You can also visit the Old Market Hall, Kauppahalli, for more food and Finnish fare.\n\nThe Esplanadi in Downtown Helsinki\n\nThis iconic park in downtown Helsinki is just across from the Market Square. Take a stroll and discover the statue of Johan Ludvig Runeberg, a renowned Swedish-Finnish poet and the National poet of Finland, at its center.\n\nOn one end of the park is the Engels Teater, the first theatre building in Helsinki. On the other, you will find the Kappeli restaurant, which holds live music regularly.\n\nIn the Fall, the park is filled with orange and yellow leaves, fall flowers, and beautiful greenery. To step out of the park is to find yourself back in the city, with fancy restaurants and upscale stores.\n\nIt is an urban park that you will love to see if you enjoy the greenery and unique calm amidst a large city.\n\nTake a Ferry to Suomenlinna\n\nThey had me at Sea Fortress. Suomenlinna fortress can be found on a cluster of islands, just a quick 15-minute ferry ride away from Helsinki. The ferry leaves from the docks by Market Square every 40 minutes.\n\nSuomenlinna is a fortress that was constructed in the mid-18th century. It went through eras of Swedish, Russian and finally Finnish rule.\n\nThis fortress is one of my favorite parts of Finland. You can freely roam the island and choose to explore the tunnels and caverns of the fortress if you don’t mind the dark.\n\nThe ferry costs about 2.50 euros, and the water is very calm. Those of you who get motion sickness like me can rejoice.\n\nThe National Library of Finland\n\nRight next to Helsinki Cathedral you will find the National Library of Finland. This is a library worth visiting. The old architecture, the smell, everything will set your book-loving senses tingling.\n\nWhen you enter, you will have to check your coat and bags. It is free and they have lockers where you can lock up your valuables.\n\nAs the National Library, it is responsible for storing the Finnish cultural heritage, meaning that it receives copies of all printed materials produced or for distribution in Finland. It also receives all audiovisual materials except for films.\n\nYou will also find one of the most comprehensive collections of books published in the Russian Empire of any library in the world.\n\nI cannot begin to explain how cool I think libraries are. They are basically free museums. Visit them all over the world!\n\nTake a Day Trip to Tallinn, Estonia\n\nIf you are wanting to expand your horizons even more while you are in Helsinki, you can take an easy day trip to Tallin, Estonia. The ferry ride takes about 2.5 hours. The waters are less calm, so take your Dramamine, my friends. I felt terrible for the first hour of the trip until mine kicked in.\n\nI would compare the ferry to a cruise ship, but I imagine it is smaller (I have never taken a cruise). There are restaurants and bars, also Starbucks for basic people like me. There was even live music in the bar on our return journey.\n\nTallinn is an amazing city. Wander through its medieval old town and eat something awesome while you are there. Just be sure to take the earliest ferry there. The tourists really start to pack in around midday. It is much easier to see everything when you are not dodging tour groups.\n\nEnjoy the Capital of Finland\n\nWhile Helsinki is not my favorite city in Europe, I did find it to be an enjoyable place to visit. I would love to spend more time there roaming through museums and learning more about its history.\n\nI visited Helsinki in the Fall and would highly recommend that time of year. If you enjoy cool weather and trees wearing bright yellows and oranges and reds, then a Helsinki autumn is just what you need.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post and found it useful, please take a moment to share it on Pinterest!"
