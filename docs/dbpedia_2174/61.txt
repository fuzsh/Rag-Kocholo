Helsinki Seagulls is a professional basketball team based in Helsinki, Finland. The club is playing in the Korisliiga, which is the highest tier of basketball in Finland. They have cooperated with Forenom since the previous league season. Before that, the fixed-term or even temporary living arrangements caused a lot of trouble and hassle to the team, because of the housing shortage in the capital city.

”I must say that Forenom has offered us wonderful solutions to these challenges. They are able to offer an excellent selection of neat, fully-furnished apartments, with all services included and in great locations. Their offering is also flexible and adjusts easily to our changing situations and needs, and we can always count on getting an apartment ready for our players even on a very short notice”, says CEO of the Seagulls, Sauli Silvonen.

The team often needs apartments for both their national and international players as well as the staff, and usually for about nine months at a time instead of an entire year. That’s why getting apartments from the traditional rental market isn’t a viable option for their needs, not to mention how much more expensive and time-consuming it would be.

”In a city like Helsinki, it would make no sense for us to pay for apartments that would just sit empty at times. Forenom’s services work like in a hotel but the level of accommodation is more like a home”, Silvonen praises.

Possible changes in team line-up and bringing in new players mid-season also cause challenges when it comes to the team’s accommodation. The on-going Korisliiga season has brought along plenty of challenges in this region, as the Seagulls have suffered several injuries and have had to make changes in their line-up. This is when Forenom’s flexible accommodation solutions have proved again to be the best fit for the team.
