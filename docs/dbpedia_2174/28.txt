Damn Seagulls

Damn those seagulls in Helsinki that steal your ice cream and poo on your head and laugh all the way back to the nest and their beautiful seagull wife! Damn those Damn Seagulls, too, not for being as intrusive as their cackling counterparts, but for playing such catchy songs with such catching enthusiasm that seeing them live once leaves you forever branded. It only took them one album (One Night at Sirdie's, 2004) to sweep the Finnish rock/pop scene off their feet, but the live experience with these dirty birds is on another level altogether. What with six musicians, more soul and rock and punk screwballs served at once than you ever imagined the air could contain, and all this played intensely like a wall of sound that almost hits you to the ground â€“ well, compared to the crimes that this band does to your heart, having your ice cream stolen suddenly seems like a very petty one.
