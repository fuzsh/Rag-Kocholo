        "text": "Agnes Irwin was born December 30, 1841, in Washington, D.C., to Sophia Arabella (Bache) Irwin (1815-1904) and William Wallace Irwin (1803-1856). She spent the early part of her childhood in Denmark, as Irwin's father received an appointment as United States Minister to Denmark in 1841. In 1862, following the family's move from Washington, D.C., to New York City, Irwin began teaching at the school of Mrs. Ogden Hoffman. Subsequently, she was offered the position of principal at the West Penn Square Seminary for Young Ladies (later renamed the Agnes Irwin School). She taught and served as headmistress alongside her sister Sophy Dallas Irwin (1845-1915), before accepting the inaugural role of dean at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1894. Following her resignation from Harvard, Irwin served as a member of the Head Mistresses' Association of Private Schools (1911-1914). She received honorary degrees from Western University of Pennsylvania, the University of Pennsylvania, and St. Andrew's University (Scotland). She died of pneumonia on December 5, 1914, in Philadelphia, and is buried at St. James the Less Episcopal Churchyard. In 2019, the Agnes Irwin School continues to operate as a private all-girls pre-K-12 school in Rosemont, Pennsylvania.\n\nRichard Biddle Irwin was born December 28, 1839, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the oldest child of William Wallace Irwin and Sophia Arabella (Bache) Irwin. During the Civil War, Irwin served as an aide-de-camp to Major General George B. McClellan before receiving a Lieutenant Colonelcy in the Army of the Potomac and Assistant Adjutant General for the 19th Army Corps in Major General Nathaniel Banks' Department of the Gulf. On December 20, 1865, he married Charlotte Martin (1840-1884), with whom he had two children: Frank Irwin (1868-1948) and Agnes Irwin (1871-1897). Over the course of his career, Irwin worked for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, the government of Japan, The New York Tribune, and a Wyoming cattle ranch. He authored several works including History of the Nineteenth Army Corps and Sherman and His Campaigns. He died of kidney disease on April 26, 1892, in New York, New York, and is buried in St. James the Less Episcopal Churchyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nSophia Arabella (Bache) Irwin, born November 14, 1815, was the daughter of Richard Bache, Jr. (1784-1848) and Sophia Burrell (Dallas) Bache (1785-1860). Irwin married William Wallace Irwin (1803-1856) and they had several children, including: Richard Biddle Irwin (1839-1892), Agnes Irwin (1841-1914), Robert Walker Irwin (1844-1925), Sophy Dallas Irwin (1845-1915), and Mary Bache Irwin (1849-1927). She was the great-granddaughter of Benjamin Franklin through her Bache family ancestry. Sophia Irwin died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 25, 1904, and is buried in St. James the Less Episcopal Churchyard.\n\nThe \"Cousin Lizzie\" referred to in the collection is possibly Elizabeth (Duane) Gillespie (1821-1901), cousin of Sophia Arabella (Bache) Irwin. Gillespie's mother was Deborah (Bache) Duane (1781-1863), sister of Irwin's father, Richard Bache, Jr. One of Deborah's letters to her mother is included in this collection. Gillespie married Archibald Hamilton Gillespie (1812-1873), with whom she had several children including daughter Ellen Duane Gillespie (1854-1924), who may be the \"Nelly\" mentioned in several of Agnes Irwin's letters."
