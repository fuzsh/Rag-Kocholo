        "text": "Tsumoru Fukuzawa was born in Akaho-mura, Kamiina-gun, Nagano-ken, Japan on January 1, 1886. He was the son of Hamashiro and Sai Fukuzawa of Nagano-ken, Japan, and he had a brother, Atsumi Fukuzawa of Hokkaido-ken, Japan. Tsumoru had completed eight years of grade school and another eight years of agricultural school in Nagano-ken, Japan.\n\nHe first arrived in the United Stated in 1904 in San Francisco, where he lived from 1904-1906 and worked as a janitor for the Union Drug Company. From 1906-1910, he worked at various jobs as a laborer in Los Angeles. Then, in 1910, he moved to Santa Barbara and worked there as a gardener and served in an officer position at the Japanese Congregational Church, which also operated a Japanese language school.\n\nQuoting an interview with daughter, Barbara Fukuzawa (September 20, 2018):\n\nI’m Barbara Fukuzawa, and I’m 93-years-old. Born and raised here in Santa Barbara. Dad came over when he was 18-years-old. Finished agriculture college in Japan. Being that he was not the oldest [son] in Japan, he came here because he heard the streets were paved with gold. He didn’t talk too much about it but being a young man. I know he was a young man up in Seattle and San Francisco, Los Angeles, and somehow, he came to Santa Barbara.\n\nMichito Frank Fukuzawa, 93, of Gardena, California, passed away on June 24, 2017. Frank was born on October 5, 1923 in Santa Barbara. In April 1942, Frank was just two months away from his Santa Barbara High School graduation. Instead of having the opportunity to participate in his high school graduation, he served in the US Army’s 442nd Regiment, 2nd Battalion, Company F. For his service, Frank received three battle stars for action, a Bronze Star for bravery, a Presidential Citation with Oak Leaf Clusters, and a Combat Infantry Badge.\n\nSixty-six years after his internment, Frank joined his fellow graduates from the Santa Barbara High School Class of 2008 as they marched together into Peabody Stadium to receive their high school diplomas. That day he not only realized a dream but also embodied the school’s motto: “Once a Don, Always a Don.”\n\nFrances (Fukuzawa) Kozaki was born on September 2, 1930 in Santa Barbara, CA at St. Francis Hospital. She was the youngest among her five other siblings. Her parents named her Frances after the hospital that she was born in. Frances died on April 6, 2019 at the age of 88.\n\nBarbara Fukuzawa was born on January 25, 1925, and her parents named her Barbara after her birthplace, Santa Barbara. Today, at age 98, she is the last surviving family member of her generation and is also one of two remaining Bethany Congregational Church members who were part of the original Japanese Congregational Church in Santa Barbara’s Nihonmachi, with the other person being 100-year-old Roke Fukumura."
