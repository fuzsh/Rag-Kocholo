Heiken (heikenj@wustl.edu)\n\nMallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, USA\n\nLI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System) is a comprehensive system for standardise interpretation and reporting of CT, MR and US examinations performed on patients at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). LI-RADS was developed by a large committee with international and multidisciplinary input and is supported by the American College of Radiology (ACR). The aims of LI-RADS are to:\n\n• Establish minimum technical parameters for CT, MR, and US HCC surveillance\n\n• Standardise: terminology, interpretation, reporting and imaging management\n\n• Enhance communication among radiologists, hepatologists, surgeons and pathologists\n\nLI-RADS (version2017) was released at the end of June 2017. Different from the previous versions, which were PowerPoint based, the new version is a downloadable pdf. New content in v.2017 includes modules on ultrasound surveillance, contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), reporting, management and tumour response. In addition, the CT/MR algorithm has been modified. The details of these changes will be discussed.\n\nReferences\n\n1. https://www.acr.org/quality-safety/resources/LIRADS\n\n09:00 – 10:30 Head and Neck\n\nO3 MRI in nasopharyngeal carcinoma\n\nAnn D King (King2015@cuhk.edu.hk)\n\nDepartment of imaging and interventional radiology, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong\n\nAbstract\n\nNasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is most commonly an undifferentiated carcinoma with a strong association with the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and familial tendency. MRI is the modality of choice for NPC staging of the primary tumour and nodal metastases. The primary tumour spreads to the nasal cavity and infrequently to the oropharynx (T1); parapharyngeal space, medial and lateral pterygoid, and prevertebral muscles (T2); skull base, cervical vertebrae, pterygoid structures and paranasal sinuses (T3); intracranial structures, cranial nerves, orbit, parotid gland, beyond the lateral margin of the lateral pterygoid muscle, and hypopharynx (T4). NPC has a propensity to spread to nodes, the first echelon being nodes in the retropharyngeal region or upper internal jugular chain from where nodes spread in orderly fashion down the neck. Nodal staging differs from that squamous cell carcinoma in that bilateral nodes are down staged to NI when they are retropharyngeal, 6cm is the only criterion for size, and lower neck nodes are designated as N3. The first part of the lecture will focus on MRI staging of primary tumour and nodal metastases using a structured approach and report. The lecture will illustrate the staging process including assessment of the complex anatomy at the skull base, highlight areas important for NPC management, and review the changes in the latest 8th edition of the UICC/AJJC classification.\n\nMore recently MRI is also being used for the early detection of NPC. MRI has a high diagnostic accuracy of NPC detection, 10% of MRI detected NPCs are endoscopically occult, and MRI identifies slow growing tumours up to three years before they can be found endoscopically. In the second part of the lecture this new role of MRI for early detection of NPC in symptomatic patients and subjects in EBV population screening studies will be discussed.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

These cancers spread along the mucosal surface, but also submucosally, typically preferring the paths of least resistance. As there are many nerves present in the head and neck region, these structures may provide tumours the opportunity to spread over a considerable distance from their point of origin.\n\nPerineural tumour spread occurs in all head and neck malignancies; adenoid cystic carcinoma, a tumour of salivary gland origin, is notorious for its tendency to spread along nerves. Perineural tumour spread is associated with a decreased survival rate. Symptoms include pain, paraesthesias and muscle weakness, but about 40% of patients do not show particular symptoms. Imaging diagnosis is important to map the full tumour extent, and to avoid tumour progression from unrecognised perineural spread.\n\nPerineural tumour spread occurs most frequently along the maxillary nerve, mandibular nerve and facial nerve. Imaging findings in perineural tumour spread include thickening and/or enhancement of one or more nerve branches; widening, destruction or enhancement of a skull base neural foramen or canal (e.g. foramen ovale, vidian canal); small tumoural lesions at some distance from the primary site, in a neural 'crossroad' such as the pterygopalatine fossa or Meckel's cave; denervation atrophy of muscles supplied by the affected nerve.\n\nO5 Molecular imaging in head and neck cancer\n\nWim J.G. Oyen (Wim.Oyen@icr.ac.uk)\n\nThe Institute of Cancer Research / Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK\n\nNext to MRI and CT, in recent years, the role of molecular imaging with FDG-PET/CT has significantly increased in staging, monitoring the response to therapy and detection of relapse.\n\nFDG-PET/CT plays an important role at diagnosis in patients with metastatic lymph nodes in the neck from an unknown primary tumour, guiding the choice of biopsy sites at subsequent endoscopy. Furthermore, FDG-PET/CT provides pivotal additional information in patients with equivocal or contradictory findings on other diagnostic modalities to provide clinical decision making on radical or palliative treatment. This is particularly important in patients who have a high risk of metastatic disease such as advanced loco-regional disease and primary sites which are more likely to result in distant metastases such as nasopharyngeal cancer. [1]\n\nAlthough not yet widely adopted as the standard of care, the role of FDG-PET/CT in radiation treatment planning, monitoring response to (chemo) radiotherapy and adaptation of treatment based on early interim FDG-PET/CT (iPET) scanning is expanding. In a recent systematic review, it was observed that most studies confirm the value of iPET to predict response to chemoradiotherapy. [2] A few studies did highlight that predictive value of iPET was lower as compared to FDG-PET/CT acquired 2 to 4 months after completion of chemoradiotherapy, which correlated well with local and regional control and survival. [2]. The best timing for iPET to assess response during radiation therapy remains to be established, although 1-2 weeks seems the best choice as it leaves the opportunity to adapt the treatment regimen.\n\nIt is accepted that in patients with advanced nodal disease (stage N2 or N3) and who have received primary chemoradiotherapy, PET-CT-guided surveillance after completion of chemoradiotherapy results in similar survival with considerably fewer operations as compared to patients who underwent routine neck dissection. [3] This PET/CT-based strategy proved to be high cost-effective. [4] In patients suspected of recurrent laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy, FDG-PET/CT is also effective a first-line diagnostic investigation, prior to performing a direct laryngoscopy with biopsy under general anaesthesia, reducing the need for direct laryngoscopy by more than 50% without jeopardizing quality of treatment. [5]\n\nIn conclusion, FDG-PET/CT plays an increasingly important role in the assessment of disease activity in patients with head and neck cancer in all stages of the patients’ journey.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

A huge number of drugs are underway to improve patient outcomes and several recent drug developments have already significantly changed the fate of oncology patients. Different classes of drugs need to be reviewed to allow an understanding of therapeutic interventions.\n\nThe oldest targeted drug treatments available are monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies all target structures on the cell surface and are being used in hematology, solid oncology, as well as in rheumatology and neurology. Binding of the antibody to its target structure is specific and leads to complement-induced cell lysis, recognition by the immune system or direct, antibody-dependent cell lysis. One level below, within the cell cytoplasm, the tyrosine kinases that are members of the signal transduction chain, can also be targeted. This disruption can lead to long lasting responses in patients who failed several other lines of therapy. In some instances, tyrosine kinase inhibitors have led to cure in hitherto incurable diseases. Unravelling the immune system to enable it to recognise tumour cells has led to the invention of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. These were first used in malignant melanoma but have now expanded to a wide variety of solid tumours and have led to impressive results especially in cells with high mutation rate, as these tend to display a lot of PD-L1 proteins on their surface. The most exciting news, however, comes from chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T)- cells, one of which has recently been approved for the treatment of juvenile acute leukemia. Here, cytotoxic T-cells from a patient are isolated and genetically modified by implanting into the cell surface a recognition molecule for a tumour antigen. Because T-cells can replicate in vivo, these cells not only recognise and destroy a target cell but will prevail as a long-term memory within the body of the recipient. This development is poised to transform oncology as we know it and may become the most important advance in the treatment of tumours for years to come.\n\nO7 Tumour heterogeneity: what does it mean?\n\nDow-Mu Koh (Mu.Koh@icr.ac.uk)\n\nRoyal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, SM2 5PT, UK\n\nCancers arise from unregulated cellular growth and exhibits a range of pathophysiological characteristics and behaviour. The term “tumour heterogeneity” refers to differences in tumour features that have arisen as a result of mechanistic processes including stem-cell origin, tumour evolution (linked to genetic mutations and adverse tumour microenvironment) and clonal resistance (as a consequence of treatment). Tumour heterogeneity may be inter-cellular, intra-tumoural (i.e. within the same tumour), inter-tumoural (i.e. between lesions in the same patient) and inter-individual (i.e. between patients).\n\nThe understanding of tumour heterogeneity is important because it is a barrier cancer cures. Tumour heterogeneity is linked to treatment resistance and the emergence of aggressive tumour phenotypes. The ability to identify, describe and communicate heterogeneity of tumours on imaging may provide a basis for adaptive treatments to improve patient outcomes.\n\nCurrent approaches used to enhance the understanding of tumour heterogeneity include genomics/ molecular analysis of multi-tumoural region tissue sampling and/or longitudinal tumour tissue sampling. However, non-invasive imaging using CT, MRI and PET enables the characteristics of multiple disease sites to be evaluated in a single study, thereby providing information about intra- and inter-tumour heterogeneity.\n\nUsing functional and molecular imaging techniques, imaging can be used to quantitatively measure different aspects of tumour biology; thus identifying imaging phenotypes linked to different stem-cell origins, gene expression, tumour evolution, treatment efficacy (including differential treatment response) and the emergence of clonal resistance.\n\nThe emerging evidence for the use of imaging to explore and understand tumour heterogeneity will be presented and discussed.\n\n11.00 - 12.30 Joint with DEGRO: Delineation of Tumour and Normal Tissue\n\nO8 Image interpretation in the post treatment pelvis\n\nAndrea Rockall (a.rockall@imperial.ac.uk)\n\nDepartment of Radiology, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Fulham Rd, London SW3 6JJ, UK\n\nFollow-up imaging is a significant part of the daily routine practice in cancer imaging. The work-load has increased due to improved outcomes with longer patient survival rates, as well as due to the development of the increasing range of salvage therapy options in the case of disease relapse. It is important that the radiologist is familiar with the post therapy appearances of the pelvis in order to recognise the typical changes following surgery or radiotherapy. In addition, the radiologist needs to recognise complications of treatment and disease relapse.\n\nPost surgical pelvis\n\nThe typical appearance of the pelvis following gynaecologic cancer surgery depends on the procedure. The most common procedure includes hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy and in many cases, the pelvic side-wall lymph nodes may be sampled or removed. The vaginal vault and pelvic side-wall nodes should be carefully inspected as these are frequent sites of pelvic recurrence (1). The use of imaging for follow-up surveillance is variable (2). However, follow-up imaging in the case of fertility-preserving surgery requires special attention (3). Regular surveillance imaging is typically performed in order to detect any early signs of relapse following procedures including trachelectomy for early stage cervix cancer, unilateral salpingo-oopherectomy for borderline ovarian neoplasm or conservative management of endometrial cancer.\n\nPost-operative lymphocysts along the pelvic side-walls may be seen following nodal dissection and these usually decrease over time and are rarely of clinical significance; occasionally a lymphocyst may become infected. Significant post-operative complications, such as abscess or haemorrhage, are usually clinically recognised and imaging is used to clarify the extent and direct further management, such as percutaneous drainage.\n\nPost radiotherapy pelvis\n\nImaging is regularly used to evaluate response to treatment in cases of non-surgical management, such as radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. The evaluation of response to radiotherapy is highly important and will be covered in as a separate topic. Following completion of radiotherapy, there are several recognizable appearances that are frequently seen and are not usually of clinical concern (4). These include thickening and oedema of the bladder and rectum and thickening of the small bowel loops. Chronic signs of radiotherapy toxicity should also be recognised and reported, including cervical stenosis, bowel stricture, insufficiency fractures in the pelvis and the development of fistula, all of which may be associated with significant symptoms.\n\nRelapse and salvage therapy\n\nIt is essential to know the typical sites of pelvic relapse and the appearances on imaging in order to ensure early detection. The success of salvage treatment is best when there is limited central pelvic recurrent disease amenable to exenterative surgery or focussed salvage radiotherapy. FDG-PET/CT is used to determine whether relapse is restricted to a single pelvic site or whether this is more widespread (5) and may also be helpful, in combination with MRI, in providing a surgical road-map (6). In the case of planning exenterative surgery or stereotactic radiotherapy, accurate description of the anatomical relationships between disease and pelvic structures is very important. This information can not only assist the surgeon but also help to inform the patient as to the likely treatment outcomes.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Van den Abbeele (abbeele@dfci.harvard.edu)\n\nChair, Department of Imaging, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Founding Director, Center for Biomedical Imaging in Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02215, USA\n\nCo-Director, Tumour Imaging Metrics Core, Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, Boston, MA 02215, USA; Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, 02115, USA; Co-Editor-In-Chief, Cancer Imaging, International Cancer Imaging Society\n\nPrecision medicine and precision oncology aim to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right dose through the right route of administration. The precision medicine initiative has led to major paradigm shifts in precision oncology, first with the implementation of molecularly-targeted therapies [1, 2], then with immune therapy [3, 4]. We are now at a point where we can deliver cancer treatment with great precision, and the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer are becoming proactive disciplines using evidence-based individualised medicine to meet the goals of precision medicine/oncology.\n\nThese advances have not come without challenges for the cancer imaging community. We have had to readjust our evaluation of therapeutic response from traditional anatomic-based criteria based on tumour shrinkage to a new context where knowledge of novel therapies and their biologic effects are paramount as to not misinterpret response. Molecularly targeted therapies may, indeed, be effective despite the absence of tumour shrinkage, while the appearance of new lesions or an increase in tumour size following immune therapy may represent pseudoprogression rather than progressive disease [5, 6].\n\nCancer Imaging is, however, uniquely placed to validate and deliver precision imaging to the precision medicine/oncology initiative. Advances in the functional capabilities of various imaging modalities including CT, MRI, ultrasound, nuclear medicine and PET and hybrid technologies (SPECT/CT, PET/CT and PET/MRI) are providing anatomic and functional whole body imaging noninvasively in one setting that can define the entire tumour burden, characterise tumour heterogeneity, guide biopsy to the relevant site, evaluate the tumour and its microenvironment simultaneously, help enrich patient populations, add prognostic value, and be clinically actionable. Molecular imaging, in particular, has the potential of exploring all the hallmarks of cancer biology, providing specificity that is relevant to the biology of the tumour and its microenvironment, and guiding pre-clinical and clinical trial design with timely and effective translation of cancer discovery. Molecular imaging can also detect primary and secondary resistance, provide tumour response assessment early after initiation of therapy (which may add predictive value), offer pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information, help define biologic effectiveness prior to MTD, and assess and monitor toxicity. These capabilities may result in shorter trials and improve the timeline for drug or imaging probe development.\n\nAchieving these goals requires standardization of imaging protocols and consistent, accurate and reproducible longitudinal tumour assessments in oncologic clinical trials and clinical practice [7]. It also requires a collaborative approach between basic and translational scientists, imagers, academia and industry. A “wall-less” disease-centric infrastructure structured as a multitalented and multidisciplinary team focused on facilitating bi-directional exchanges and communication can help achieve this goal [8].\n\nAchieving precision cancer imaging will also require changes in the training of cancer imaging specialists at the residency and fellowship levels to produce cancer imaging specialists who are literate in more than one specialty and imaging modality. The training of the next generation of “Precision Imagers” needs a new disease-based curriculum that teaches the language of oncology, navigates through the various “-omics” and highlights the biology behind cancer and drug development [9, 10].\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Fütterer (Jurgen.Futterer@radboudumc.nl)\n\nDepartment of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, Radboudumc, Nijmegen, The Netherlands\n\nAt present, treatment choice for prostate cancer patients at low or intermediate risk of disease progression lies between active surveillance and radical therapies, such as radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. For these patients, radical treatments have a comparable effectiveness, with a risk of specific death of less than 1% in 15 years. However, none is divided of consequences on the quality of life and can induce significant morbidities such as incontinence and impotence (1-3). On the other hand, active surveillance has established limitations. It is a source of anxiety and imposes, according to the current terms of use, clinical (rectal examination), biological (PSA) and yearly repeat biopsies reassessments that represent a burden for the patient and increase the risk of infection (4). Lastly, the presumed low risk of progression defined by systematic biopsies is underestimated in about 30% of cases, particularly when the tumour originates in the anterior part of the prostate. Thus, more than one third of men exit the protocol at mid-term and ask for a radical treatment.\n\nThe role of imaging has been increased in patients who choose for active surveillance. Multi-parametric MRI is applied to identify patients with clinically-significant cancer and larger disease burden who would most likely benefit from intervention. Thus, imaging is used as a selection tool. Multi-parametric MRI in the surveillance of low-grade and low-volume disease is rising. In case of disease progression on imaging, MRI targeted biopsy is a viable option to proof this stage migration. At present, multi-parametric MRI is not in the current international guidelines for active surveillance. However, evidence is growing in favor for the implementation of multi-parametric MRI in the active surveillance setting.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

In thermal ablation tumour cells are locally in situ heated up and destroyed. For in situ thermal destruction radiofrequency (RFA), microwave (MWA), laser (LITT) or high-focused ultrasound (HiFU) are established (1). In addition to heating thermal ablation cooling cancer cells to ice, so called cyotherapy, is another form of thermal ablation technique. On the other side also non-thermal local tumour ablations, e.g. local irradiation (SBRT, Cyberknife, brachytherapy) or irreversible electroporation (IRE) are possible (2, 3).\n\nThermal tumour ablations are established in primary or secondary liver and lung tumours, but are also used in kidney tumours, bone tumours, adrenal tumours, prostate cancer, breast cancer and others. The most accepted indications are radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or microwave ablation (MWA) of hepatocellular cancer (HCC) in the liver and localised renal cell cancer (RCC).\n\nIn HCCs the accepted size of a single nodule is 3 cm in diameter for thermal ablation (4, 5). In larger tumours local tumour recurrence rates after ablation are increasing because of heat sink effect. HCCs nodules are hypervascularised and this hyperperfusion is transporting the necessary heat for cancer cell ablation away. Pre-ablative embolisation like TACE is an accepted method to prevent this heat sink effect in tumours up to 4-4.5 cm in diameter (6). In comparison of MWA and RFA it is unclear which method generates a higher local control rate after thermal ablation, but it is clear that MWA is much faster and creates larger ablation zones (7-9).\n\nIn renal cell cancers RFA and cyoablation are the preferred methods of local thermal ablation. Usually localised RCCs (T1a) are an indication for local ablation and current studies did show that thermal ablation is equally oncological effective as partial nephrectomy, but with a better preservation of renal function (10-12).\n\nAnother very well accepted indication of thermal ablation is RFA of symptomatic osteoid osteomas. Osteoid osteoma is not a malignant tumour, but is very painful. Localized thermal ablation of this prostaglandin producing quickly resolves pain in these young patients (13).\n\nReferences\n\n1.

IRE utilises a series of short, high-voltage pulses conducted via needle-electrodes. The induced microporation of the cell membranes lead to irreversible defects causing cell death. Since IRE is a non-thermal ablation technique it does not have the side-effects of those methods such as the heat sink effect or thermal damage of vulnerable nearby structures. IRE can thus also be used close to blood vessels. Therefore IRE is a suitable method for treatment of locally advanced pancreatic cancer.\n\nOnly up to 20% of all patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are eligible for a surgical oncological resection (Whipple’s procedure, pancreatectomy or resection of the pancreatic tail) which – to date - is the only available cure [1]. Even with a complete surgical resection (R0) patients have a poor prognosis with a 5-year survival rate of 20-25% [2]. The main reason for unresectability is a tumour encasement of vital arteries such as the coeliac trunc or the superior mesenteric artery. In this case the only therapeutic option according to guidelines is a palliative chemotherapy or combined radiochemotherapy. Martin et al. could show that IRE is a safe method with a potentially improved overall survival in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer smaller 4cm in diameter when compared with palliative chemotherapy alone [3].\n\nIn our clinic we started IRE treatment in February 2015 and have up to date treated more than 150 patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer who were not suitable for a surgical resection. We use an open surgical approach via transverse upper abdominal laparotomy under general anaesthesia. After opening of the omental bursa up to six needle-electrodes are directly inserted into the tumour guided by high-resolution ultrasound.\n\nDuring the procedure the patient requires deep neuromuscular blockade to prevent muscular excitation. After adjusting the system for optimal energy delivery we apply 90 cycles of ultra-short (90ms) high-voltage (up to 3000V) pulses under cardiac synchronization aiming at approximately 30 amperes. After removing the needle-electrodes from the tissue, the puncture holes are sutured to prevent pancreatic fistulas. A drain is placed and checked for pancreatic enzymatic activity regularly on pod 1 and 3. On pod 6 a contrast enhanced CT-scan is performed to check for potential complications. This scan defines the baseline for further follow-up. Patients are usually dismissed 6-8 days post IRE.\n\nMain potential complications are bleeding, chronic pain, delayed gastric emptying and pancreatic fistula [4]. Exclusion criteria for IRE treatment are metastatic disease, duodenal infiltration or infiltration of other surrounding organs and the presence of a bare metal stent in the common bile duct. Since long-term results are lacking IRE should only be used as palliative treatment option in unresectable pancreatic cancer and randomised, prospective studies are needed.\n\nWe will give an introduction of the IRE procedure in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer and give an insight in our 2,5 years of experience with the method.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

McLoud (Mcloud.theresa@mgh.harvard.edu)\n\nProfessor of Radiology, Harvard Medical School, Vice Chair for Education, Department of Radiology , Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA\n\nThe 8th Edition of the TNM classification for lung cancer became effective in January 2017. It is based on retrospective and prospective data which included over 94,708 cases from 35 sources in 16 countries.\n\nIn regard to the T factor of tumour staging there has been a change in the categorization of tumour size. T1 now includes 3 categories of a, b, and c. T1a is ≤ 1 cm, T1b > 1 cm but ≤ 2 cm, and T1 c > 2 but ≤ 3 cm. The tumour must be surrounded by lung or visceral pleura with no invasion more proximal than the lobar bronchus. T2 tumours are > 3 cm but ≤ 5 cm. This category is further divided into categories 2a and 2b. Other features include involvement of a main bronchus at any distance from the carina or invasion of the visceral pleura and association with partial or complete lung atelectasis or pneumonitis. T3 tumours are considered > 5 cm but ≤ 7 cm. Other criteria include direct invasion of any of the following: parietal pleura, chest wall / superior sulcus, phrenic nerve, or parietal pericardium. The final criterion is separate tumour nodules in the same lobe. The criteria for T4 tumours are a size > 7 cm or invasion of any of the following: mediastinum, diaphragm, heart, great vessels, trachea, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, carina or separate tumour nodules in a different lobe but in the same lung.\n\nIn regard to the nodal (N designation of regional lymph node metastasis) the existing nomenclature is maintained. N0 indicates no regional lymph node involvement, and N1 ipsilateral peribronchial, hilar, intrapulmonary, nodal involvement N2 ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal nodal involvement, and N3 contralateral mediastinal, contralateral hilar, ipsilateral or contralateral scalene or supraclavicular nodal involvement.\n\nThe M indicator for metastatic disease contains a minor change. In the TNM 7 classification M1b represented all distant metastases. Now there are two categories for distant metastases, M1b is a single distant metastasis in a single organ and M1c indicates multiple distant metastases in a single or multiple organs. The M designation also includes separate tumour nodules in the contralateral lung as well as malignant pleural or pericardial involvement.\n\nThe current classification represents the continued improvement of previous modifications and reflects an evolving understanding of tumour behavior. It enables optimal treatment decisions.\n\nReferences\n\nCarter BW, Godoy MCB, Wu CC, Erasmus JJ, Truong MT. Current controversies in lung cancer staging.

However, there is a wide spectrum of unusual focal abnormalities that can be early presentations of lung cancer. These abnormalities include, for example, cancers associated with ‘cystic airspaces’ [1,2], or ‘non-nodular’ cancers presenting, for example, as fibrotic changes or scar-like lesions [3]. Such focal abnormalities are initial signs of lung cancer which usually develop over time in a lung nodule or suspicious pulmonary opacities and, therefore, should be checked at follow-up or annual repeat LDCT.\n\nThe detection of lung cancer with low-dose CT can be affected by the absence of intravenous contrast medium. As a consequence, endobronchial and central lesions can be difficult to recognise, raising the potential for missed cancers. Focal lesions arising within pre-existing lung disease, such as lung fibrosis or apical scars, can also be early lung cancer manifestations and deserve particular consideration as recognition of these lesions may be hindered by the underlying disease. Furthermore, the unpredictable growth rate of lung cancer, which ranges from indolent to aggressive cancers, necessitates attention to the wide spectrum of progression in lung cancer appearance on serial low dose CT scans.\n\nThere is a wide spectrum of low-dose CT findings in lung cancer screenings. Awareness of the various radiological features of early lung cancers and the familiarity with the low dose CT technique can improve the CT screening effectiveness and avoid missed diagnosis.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Maki D, Takahashi M, Murata K et al Computed tomography appearances of bronchogenic carcinoma associated with bullous lung disease.

Nevertheless, the available data regarding pulmonary nodules released by lung cancer screening studies could improve future screening guidelines, as well as the clinical practice of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules on routine CT scans. Most lung cancer screening trials present results for baseline and incidence screening rounds separately, clustering pulmonary nodules initially found at baseline screening and newly detected pulmonary nodules after baseline screening together. This approach does not appreciate possible differences among pulmonary nodules detected at baseline and firstly detected at incidence screening rounds and is heavily influenced by methodological differences of the respective screening trials. This presentation intends to create a basis for assessing non-calcified pulmonary nodules detected during LDCT lung cancer screening in a more clinical relevant manner. The aim is to present data of non-calcified pulmonary baseline nodules and new non-calcified pulmonary incident nodules without clustering them together, thereby also simplifying translation to the clinical practice of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules. Small pulmonary nodules newly detected at incidence screening rounds of LDCT lung cancer screening may possess a greater lung cancer probability than pulmonary baseline nodules at a smaller size, which is essential for the development of new guidelines.\n\n16:00 - 17:30 Joint with DEGRO: Side Effects of Radiation Therapy\n\nO17 Thoracic complications of radiation therapy\n\nStefan Diederich (stefan.diederich@vkkd-kliniken.de)\n\nDepartment of Diagnostic and Interventional Radiology, Marien Hospital, Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nRadiation therapy of malignancy in the chest may expose normal pulmonary parenchyma to radiation.\n\nThis may lead to radiation pneumonitis which may be clinically occult or present with symptoms such as dyspnoea, fever and dry cough depending on the proportion of lung parenchyma involved and individual susceptibility of the patient [1, 2, 3].\n\nRadiation pneumonitis usually does not occur at lung doses below 30 Gray (Gy) whereas it develops almost always with doses above 40 Gy. In doses between 30 and 40 Gy individual features such as pre-existing lung disease, simultaneous chemotherapy or other medical therapy increase the likelihood of radiation pneumonitis.\n\nRadiological abnormalities in radiation pneumonitis follow a typical time course: After the threshold dose has been reached there is a delay of 4 to 6 weeks with no radiological abnormalities. Subsequently ground glass opacities develop which increase in density to form consolidation within another 4 to 6 weeks. Consolidation persists for some months and resolves incompletely with residual fibrotic changes within the next weeks and months.\n\nFollowing radiation therapy that did not lead to radiation pneumonitis initially, additional medical therapy with pneumotoxic drugs at a later stage may then cause manifest radiation pneumonitis (rebound/recall pneumonitis).\n\nA pathognomonic feature of radiation pneumonitis is the fact that the location of ground glass opacities and consolidation precisely mirrors the radiation port, i.e. the area of pulmonary parenchyma exposed to radiation above the threshold dose while completely ignoring any anatomical borders such as segmental or lobar borders.\n\nThis is easily recognised with simple radiation ports such as anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP-PA) radiation fields but is more difficult to recognise in modern complex radiation ports such as intensity-modulated radiation therapy (iMRT), stereotactic radiation therapy, cyber knife or gamma knife therapy etc. [4, 5].\n\nFurthermore, radiation therapy of the chest is a recognised cause of organizing pneumonia (OP) [6]. In contrast to radiation pneumonitis consolidation or ground glass opacities in radiation-induced OP does not mirror the radiation port and may include pulmonary parenchyma outside the radiation field and has a very heterogeneous time course with OP developing only days but also moths after radiation therapy.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Jackson\n\nDepartment of Radiology, North Shore University Health System-University of Chicago, Evanston, IL, USA\n\nCorrespondence: Richard M. Gore (rgore@uchicago.edu)\n\nINTRODUCTION: Radiation therapy can damage any portion of the gastrointestinal tract and solid abdominal organs. The risk of injury is multifactorial: method of radiation delivery; size, number and frequency of radiation fractions; volume of irradiated tissue; and duration of therapy. In this presentation the protean manifestations of radiation therapy in the abdomen and pelvis are discussed\n\nLIVER: Portions of the liver may be included in patients receiving external beam radiation therapy for gastric, biliary, pancreatic, and thoracolumbar spine malignancies. Those portions of the liver which receive more than 45 Gy may develop radiation hepatitis as a result of venooclusive disease with a clinical syndrome of anicteric ascites and hepatomegaly. On CT, the irradiated liver is hypodense with linear, well-defined margins that conform to the radiation port. On MR, the irradiated liver is oedematous causing T1-weighted hypointensity and T2-weighted hyperintensity.\n\nPANCREAS: The pancreas is relatively radioresistant but stromal oedema and fibrosis have been reported. Chronic pancreatitis can be seen years after radiation therapy\n\nSPLEEN: The spleen may be irradiated to treat lymphoma, leukemia, splenomegaly, and hypersplenism. Like lymph nodes, the spleen is very radiosensitive and doses of 4-8 Gy destroy lymphoid tissue within hours. Splenic atrophy and fibrosis can develop associated with functional hyposplenism and fulminant pneumococcal pneumonia.\n\nKIDNEYS AND URETERS: The kidneys are radiosensitive and the risk of renal impairment increases with prior or concurrent chemotherapy. Renal morphology remains normal on imaging studies in the acute setting but ultimately poorly functioning atrophic renal parenchyma results. Compensatory hypertrophy of the nonirradiated kidney can develop. The ureters are radioresistant and strictures induced by radiation therapy are infrequent\n\nSTOMACH AND DUODENUM: Gastroduodenal radiation injury typically occurs with doses of 45-60 Gy administered over 5 weeks. In the acute phase, prepyloric or pyloric channel ulcers indistinguishable from peptic ulcer disease may develop. These ulcers, however, are typically refractory to therapy. In the chronic phase fixed narrowing, deformity, and an aperistaltic antropyloric region without ulceration can develop. Mural thickening and perigastric stranding may be seen on CT.\n\nSMALL BOWEL: The small bowel is radiosenitive and three stages of radiation enteropathy corresponding to different gross and histopathologic changes have been reported. Acutely, during and immediately after therapy, hyperemia, ulcers and mucosal sloughing may occur producing mural thickening, submucosal edema and hemorrhage. In the subacute phase, 2-12 months after radiation therapy, crypt abscesses and ulcers may be seen. In the late phase, strictures, fistulas, and adhesive disease, which may lead to bowel obstruction can develop.\n\nCOLON AND RECTUM: The sigmoid colon and rectum are included in the radiation therapy portals for external beam therapy for gynecologic (particularly cervical carcinoma) as well as cancer of the prostate gland and bladder. Acutely, spasm, mucosal irregularity or nodular submucosal thickening may develop producing a sawtooth or cobblestone pattern on barium studies. Chronic radiation colitis causes structures and shortening of the colon, fistulae, sinus tracts, obstruction, or perforation. An increase in the presacral fat and submucosal edema or fat deposition can be seen on CT and MR.\n\nCONCLUSION: An understanding of the spectrum of radiation induced injuries in the abdomen and pelvis is important in their differentiation from neoplastic, infectious and inflammatory disorders.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Advanced imaging modalities such as, Diffusion Weighted Imaging, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Perfusion Weighted Imaging, as well as Positron Emission Tomography with amino-acid tracers, may be of help in differentiating pseudoprogression and radiation necrosis from true disease progression.\n\nEvaluation and depiction of the main manifestations of brain injury induced by radiation therapy is the focus of the present work.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The RECIST Working Group has updated RECIST to version 1.1 [2]. The revision addressed issues that had arisen related to the use of the criteria in practice. The revised version has maintained assessment of tumour burden using sum of the diameters and continues uses uni-dimensional measurements. The response categories are still those of complete response, partial response (30% decrease in sum from baseline), stable disease and progressive disease (20% increase in sum from nadir).\n\nThough the RECIST criteria are intended for use in the clinical trial setting, onocologist increasingly rely on RECIST based measurements to make clinical management and therapeutic decisions in daily clinical practice. The reasons for this include clinician’s application of trial data into routine clinical practice but most importantly RECIST offers a simple way of measuring and communicating response assessment. The terms such as measureable disease, tumour burden, target lesions, and response categories are now used and understood universally. RECIST criteria also provide guidance on technique as well as measuring lesions and application to assessing sites of disease eg lymph node and bones. This allows for a more robust and reproducible way of gauging response.\n\nRECIST guidelines are therefore widely employed, however, they have well recognised limitations and pitfalls. Tumours that are irregular, or show diffuse infiltration or poorly visualised eg with fatty liver, can all be difficult to measure in a reliable and reproducible way. Tumour with non-spherical growth pattern can be difficult to serially follow up and assess response. The categories for the response criteria are arbitrarily defined and may not correlate with clinical outcome. Morphological characteristics and tumour heterogeneity are not taken into consideration. Functional or physiological change with response is not assessed or measured in RECIST. Reliance of response is based exclusively on tumour size and clinical beneficial chemotherapeutic effects may occur without reduction in tumour size eg many new targeted therapies have anti-angiogenic effects and result in symptomatic improvement. Similarly immune mediated response may artificially result in short term increase in tumour size or small new lesions. Treatment effects such as necrosis, cystic change and haemorrhage can result in artificial change in tumour size. Mixed and differential response is simplified in the response assessment in RECIST. Bone disease without significant soft tissue and cystic tumour it can be difficult to assess change with the tumour.\n\nThe limitations in RECIST guidelines have led to the publications and developments in modified RECIST and other response criteria to overcome these shortfalls.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Change in tumour size, which is an indicator of change in the number of neoplastic cells, evolved into the radiologic biomarker of treatment response. Over the last decade, dramatic advances in understanding the genetics and molecular biology of tumours have revolutionised therapy for many neoplasms.\n\nMolecular targeted therapy and immunotherapy have led to new, individualise tumour therapies. These interfere with signalling pathways and thereby inhibit cell grown but do not necessarily lead to cell death, unlike cytotoxic drugs. With targeted agents, lack of progression may be associated with a positive improvement in outcome, even in the absence of major shrinkage of tumours. Oncologists have become interested in the length of time that a cancer does not grow or metastasise. Progression free survival has become the preferred end point for many cancer therapy trials. In this presentation, new criteria for imaging tumour response in the era of personalised medicine are presented and guidelines for learning when it is appropriate to resist using RECIST are presented.\n\nCONVENTIONAL ANATOMIC CRITERIA\n\nWHO\n\nRECIST\n\nRECIST 1.1\n\nFUNCTIONAL CRITERIA\n\nChoi\n\nModified Choi\n\nMAST\n\nEASL\n\nmRECIST\n\nRECICL\n\nirRC\n\nSACT\n\nMETABOLIC CRITERIA\n\nPERSIST\n\nPET-CT\n\nPET-MR\n\nEVOLVING IMAGING BIOMARKERS\n\nPerfusion\n\nDWI\n\nMRE\n\nMRS\n\nVolumetry\n\nGrowth kinetics\n\nCONCLUSION: RECIST 1.1 is the mainstay of evaluating tumour response to therapy for most cancers\n\nThese criteria depend primarily in assessing changes in tumour dimensions but they do not reflect other morphologic, functional, or metabolic changes that may occur with novel chemotherapy, targeted or immunotherapy. It is important for radiologists to integrate new concepts in the evaluation of tumour response in this era of personalised medicine and to learn when it is necessary to resist using RECIST criteria.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

The state-of-the-art in IGRT is using integrated (on-board) cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) devices to verify the correct positioning of the patient on the linac treatment table with respect to the treatment plan created before RT treatment. This method is limited by low soft tissue contrast in CT images, slow acquisition and additional radiation exposure of the patient. Although MR images from diagnostic scanners are routinely used during RT treatment planning to define tumour volumes, it is currently not standard of care to acquire MR images in the treatment room for patient positioning or on-line treatment plan adaptation.\n\nThe acquisition of MR images in treatment positioning of the patient in close temporal proximity or even during RT treatment has many potential advantages: 1) Soft tissue contrast is superior to CBCT images. This may allow a more precise localization of tumours and organs at risk before each treatment fraction and consequently lead to reduced safety margins, which are routinely added to the clinical tumour volume in the treatment planning process to account for positioning uncertainties. Therefore, less healthy tissue would have to be irradiated. 2) On-board MR imaging offers functional MR imaging techniques, such as diffusion weighted (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE). The potential benefits of these modalities in RT include early response assessment and focal dose escalation/de-escalation according to the heterogeneous biological properties of tumours. Ultimately, the promise of using on-board MR imaging in RT is that treatments become less toxic, more effective and can be delivered in less fractions.\n\nFrom the physical and technological point of view the MR-Linac is challenging, because the devices interfere in many ways: 1) The RT treatment beam is generated by acceleration of electrons in the linac, which is affected by the MR B0 magnetic field as well as the radiofrequency excitation electromagnetic waves. 2) In some devices, the output photon beam of the linac has to cross the MR cryostat, which can cause scattering of the beam and create additional out-of-field radiation dose to the patient. Apart from this, photons are largely unaffected by the MR device. 3) When photons enter the patient, secondary electrons are created, which interact with the B0 field via the Lorentz force resulting in shifted beam profiles and electron return dose effects. These effects have to be taken into account in the treatment planning system and in dosimetric quality assurance. 4) For each RT treatment fraction a new treatment plan has to be created on-line, i.e. while the patient is in treatment position, due to the limited degrees of freedom to re-position the patient in the MR-Linac. 5) The geometric accuracy of MR images used for RT has to be very high, which is an RT specific requirement. Images must be undistorted, with a maximum error of 1-2 mm in the centre of the field of view.\n\nO23 Opportunities for diagnostic radiology\n\nSergios Gatidis1, Mike Notohamiprodjo1,2\n\n1Department of Radiology, University Hospital Tuebingen, 72074, Tuebingen, Germany; 2The Radiology, 80331, Munich, Germany\n\nCorrespondence: Sergios Gatidis (sergios.gatidis@med.uni-tuebingen.de)\n\nRadiation therapy has become an effective treatment option for a series of oncologic and non-oncologic disorders. A prerequisite for the optimal therapeutic outcome is the precise and complete definition of the target area while sparing radiation-sensitive adjacent anatomic structures. Medical imaging, mostly Computed tomography, is used for this purpose. The potential advantages of MRI, especially high soft-tissue contrast and thus better lesion delineation, have resulted in increased use of this imaging modality in the context of radiation treatment planning. Furthermore, MRI offers unique possibilities for further functional characterization of pathologies using numerous available techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging or perfusion-weighted imaging. This allows for a biologic tumour characterization in vivo before, during and after radiation therapy offering information about therapeutic response and prognostic outcome.\n\nThis talk will give an overview of the use of medical imaging in radiation oncology with a focus on MRI and an outlook on PET/MR. Topics discussed will be planning of radiation therapy, pre-therapeutic tumour characterization and assessment of therapy response.\n\n11:00 – 11:30 Keynote Lecture 2\n\nO24 Immunotherapy: Imaging Redefined\n\nBernhard Gebauer (bernhard.gebauer@charite.de)\n\nCharité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany\n\nTraditional chemotherapy is directly introducing tumour cell death and later shrinkage of tumour masses throughout the body. So response evaluation criteria, like WHO, RECIST or Lugano criteria, used for evaluation of response to chemotherapy rely on tumour shrinkage as a sign of efficacy (1-4). Additionally in these criteria the appearance of new lesions or progressing non-target lesions is indicating progress of disease independent of the changes in the target lesions.\n\nIpilimumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA 4), was the first immunotherapeutic agent that showed in clinical phase II trials survival benefits and successful tumour therapy in patients with advanced malignant melanoma (5). In the study treating malignant melanoma it was shown that superficial and organ metastasis in some patients even increase in size or new lesions appear, whereas these patients later show very good response and survival benefit in the following course of the study. Following traditional response criteria these patients would have been assessed as progressive disease (PD) and excluded from the study (or dropped out from the progression free survival (PFS) group). This increase of size and appearance of the lesions is thought to be a result of lymphocyte and macrophage invasion into the tumour and is called “pseudoprogression”.\n\nUsing the results from the mentioned study new criteria, immune-related response criteria (irRC), were defined by Wolchok et. al. (5). These criteria base on bi-dimensional target lesion measurements analogue to WHO criteria. In contrast to other criteria new tumour lesions not directly trigger progressive disease (PD). The bi-dimentional measurements of new appearing lesions will be included into the sum of product tumour diameters (SPD) of the defined target lesions at baseline. Additionally every progressive disease (PD) must be confirmed by a repeated imaging with minimum 4 weeks interval. Both new rules should reduce the pseudoprogression in the tumour response assessment in immunotherapy.\n\nIn the last years these new rules have been integrated into the mono-dimensional RECIST criteria to evaluate response after immunotherapy. For these new mono-dimensional criteria no commonly accepted term exists and different abbreviations like immune-related RECIST (irRECIST), immune-modified RECIST or modified RECIST (mRECIST) are oublished.\n\nIn 2017 the RECIST author team published a modification for the RECIST system in immunotherapy called iRECIST with the main difference to differentiate between immune unconfirmed progressive disease (iUPD) and immune confirmed progressive disease (iCPD) (6).\n\nAdditionally immune response criteria for lymphomas have been integrated into the established response evaluation criteria, called LyRIC (7).\n\nIn the last years many new immunotherapeutic agents have been investigated in clinical studies, like pembrolizumab, nivolumab (anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD1) antibodies), atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1 (programmed cell death-ligand 1)), ipilimumab (anti-CTLA 4), alemtuzumab (anti CD52), ofatumumab and rituximab (anti-CD20).\n\nCurrent studies are investigating these checkpoint inhibitors of the immune system in colorectal cancer, malignant melanoma, breast cancer, non-small-cell lung carcinoma, bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma, lymphoma and leukaemia.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

More recently, the term has come to denote correlation of the imaging characteristics of a given cancer with its gene expression profile (genomics). The concept of radiology-pathology correlation is not new to cancer imagers, who routinely use imaging features to make specific radiological diagnoses, for example of a certain cancer subtype. However, radiogenomics can be thought of as the correlation of advanced, quantitative imaging features (that are not necessarily appreciable to the naked eye) with gene expression profiles, enabling radiology-pathology correlation at the microscopic or subcellular level. Hence another commonly used term for this discipline, ‘imaging genomics’. It is not uncommon to see the term ‘radiomics’ used interchangeably with radiogenomics in the literature, but the former better reflects the methodology of feature extraction from radiological images.\n\nGene expression profiling is now an essential prerequisite for molecular stratification and precision medicine in oncology and the notion that imaging could act as a biomarker for genotype is a very attractive one. Genome-based cancer characterisation necessitates tissue sampling, and a small sample from a large heterogeneous lesion may not be representative of a given tumour, whereas systematic feature extraction from routinely acquired images enables lesions to be interrogated in their entirety, thus circumventing in part the problem of tumoural heterogeneity.\n\nIn their seminal paper from 2001, Sørlie et al. demonstrated that there are distinct molecular phenotypes of breast cancer that can be identified through gene expression profiling, and which dictate treatment strategy [2]. Through various exploratory and hypothesis-driven approaches, mostly using magnetic resonance imaging, it is becoming apparent that a radiogenomic approach, may enable imaging to capture the genomic diversity of breast cancer [3,4,5]. For example, textural analysis of contrast enhanced MR images can differentiate between ductal and lobular cancers [6]. It has also been shown that there is a relationship between dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) breast MRI kinetics and the various molecular subtypes of breast cancer [4,7]. The ability to differentiate between differing subtypes of oestrogen-receptor positive breast cancers without recourse to gene expression profiling has clear implications for therapy.\n\nAs well as acting as an imaging surrogate for genomic analysis, radiogenomics may be able to predict the likelihood of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy [8]. If validated, this would have a profound impact on patient management. Radiogenomic research may also yield important prognostic information; for example, certain DCE features at preoperative breast MRI are associated with an increased recurrence score, as measured with the 21-gene Oncotype-DX assay [9].\n\nThis lecture will discuss the potential applications as well as limitations of radiogenomic research in the management of breast cancer.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Radiation affects living things on an atomic level, by ionizing molecules inside the microscopic cells. The main target to kill tumour cells with radiation is the DNA [1]. A biological damage results as a consequence of radiation interactions between atoms and the DNA as target of the cells. When ionizing radiation comes in contact with a cell there are two mechanisms how radiation ultimately damage cells. These two mechanisms are called direct and indirect (by producing free radicals) effects [2]. But not all living cells are equally sensitive to radiation. Those cells which are reproducing actively are more sensitive than those which are not. The biological effectiveness of radiation depends on the linear energy transfer, total dose, number of fractions and the radiosensitivity of the targeted cells or tissues. Approximately 50% of all cancer patients receive radiotherapy during their course of illness, either as a curative or palliative treatment to relieve the patients from symptoms such as pain caused by the cancer [3]. Understanding of tumour radiation biology, particularly the mechanisms of radiation sensitivity and resistance in tumour lesions and toxicity in normal tissues is a basis for effective clinical application of radiotherapy [4,5]\n\nReferences\n\n[1] Jorgensen TJ.

Bone marrow involvement is also typical in patients with multiple myeloma. Conventional CT and radionuclide bone scans are frequently used to detect and follow-up malignant bone disease. However, these techniques do not directly visualise the disease, but rely on identifying the reaction or destruction of the bone associated with the disease infiltration. Not surprisingly, these techniques have limited diagnostic sensitivity for detecting disease, and are also suboptimal for assessing treatment response.\n\nThe response of bone disease associated with significant soft tissue can be measured before and after treatment using standard size measurement criteria to determine treatment efficacy. Using radionuclide bone scan, subjective reduction of tracer uptake has been used to assess treatment response. The MD Anderson Criteria combines both size reduction on CT and reduction in tracer uptake on radionuclide bone scan as criteria for treatment response.\n\nHowever, there are significant issues with using CT and radionuclide bone scan for response assessment. On CT, an increase in bone sclerosis may occur in both disease response and progression, making it difficult to assess disease status, especially in multiply treated patients. By comparison, radionuclide bone scans may not visualise disease confined to the bone marrow, thus resulting in erroneous disease assessment. Furthermore, post treatment “flare” response can occur in responding patients, thus confounding image interpretation. More recently, semi-quantitative bone scan index has been applied to measure disease response but the clinical utility of this remains limited.\n\nMore recently, diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) has been shown to be an emerging technique to assess the treatment efficacy of bone disease. The technique detects cellular disease and quantifies the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the disease. Using whole body DWI, responders to treatment show reduction in diffusion tumour volume and an increase in the tumour ADC. The increase in tumour ADC values in responders is also associated with a decrease in histogram skewness and decrease in kurtosis. However, the magnitude of such changes varies with the types of treatment administered and their relative effects on cellular integrity. With successful treatment, an increase in marrow fat fraction may also be observed on chemical shift imaging.\n\nTuesday 3rd October – Afternoon Session\n\n14:00 - 15:00 Update Contrast Media\n\nO28 Gd deposition in the brain: so what?\n\nHarriet C. Thoeny (Harriet.thoeny@insel.ch)\n\nDeparment of Radiology, Neuroradiology and Nuclear Medicine, Institute of Diagnosti, Pedatric and Interventional Radiology Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland\n\nGd-based contrast agents are widely used in clinical practice since their initial approval by the FDA in 1988. These contrast agents were considered safe for all patients until 2006 when an association between gadolinium and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with end stage renal disease has been detected (1,2). Nearly all patients who developed NSF underwent contrast-enhanced MRI with a linear (Omniscan, Magnevist, OptiMARK) and therefore less stable contrast agent. Thereafter, the contrast media safety committee of the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) released new guidelines suggesting avoidance of these less stable agents in patients with impaired renal function (3). Thanks to the restricted use of lineal agents in this patient population no new cases of NSF were reported in the literature since 2009.\n\nIn 2014 T1-hyperintensities in the dentate nucleus and in the globus pallidus were observed after repetitive administration of linear gadolinium based contrast agents (Omniscan and Magnevist) in patients with normal renal function and it has been proven shortly thereafter that these T1-hyperintensities correspond to gadolinium deposition (4,5). In recent years many retrospective studies confirmed these findings and most of these T1-hyperintensitites were observed after administration of linear Gd-based agents (Omniscan, Magnevist,Multihance, Promovist). There are four different types of GD-based contrast agents differentiated by their chelate ligand, either macrocyclic or linear and ionic or non-ionic.\n\nIt is known that gadolinium is also deposited in the bone and even to a substantially higher extent (23 times) and that there is a direct correlation between the T1-hyperintensities in the brain (6,7). Studies have shown that all gadolinium based contrast agents deposit in the bone and brain however there is a big difference between agents with a significantly higher deposition of linear agents compared to macrocyclic contrast media.\n\nAlthough up to date no symptoms in patients with T1-hyperintensities have been observed the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently suggested and confirmed restrictions in the use of linear gadolinium agents. Primovist and Multihance should only be used for liver scans and Magnevist only in a special formulation for intraarticular use as the concentration is very low. All other linear agents (Omniscan, OptiMARK and Magnevist) should be suspended. The macrocyclic gadolinium agents (Dotarem, ProHance and Gadovist) are more stable and have a lower propensity to release gadolinium than linear agents and can therefore continuously being used in their current indications but at the lowest doses to provide the necessary clinical information.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

Thereafter, a fraction of the injected dose (4% for Gd-BOPTA, 50% for Gd-EOB-DTPA) is taken up into the hepatocytes causing an increase of the signal intensity of the hepatic tissue and eliminated via the biliary ducts (1).\n\nBoth contrasts give advantages in the diagnostic management of focal liver lesions (FLL): in the dynamic phase they give the same information of conventional CM, with higher signal for Gd-BOPTA (2), but a significant difference can be observed between the two LSCM, as with Gd-EOB-DTPA extraction by hepatocites starts few minutes after the injection, and a real late distribution phase cannot be observed, impairing the characterization of FLL with a significant desmoplastic or fibrotic component, such as cholangiocarcinoma or fibrous hemangiomas, which after this CM appear rapidly hypointense (3). On the contrary in the hepatobiliary phase (HBP), obtained at 20’ (Gd-EOB-DTPA) or 2-3 hours after the injection (Gd-BOPTA), the larger extracted fraction of Gd-EOB-DTPA (50%) give a higher enhancement of the liver in comparison to Gd-BOPTA (2), especially in cirrhotic patients, where the uptake of LSCM is inversely related to the amount of fibrotic changes (4).\n\nIn the HBP liver-specific properties add a great capacity to better identify small non-hepatocellular lesions (which appear markedly hypointense in the HBP) or to better characterise benign hepatocellular lesions (which usually appear iso- to hyperintense in the HBP) from malignant ones (usually not able to uptake the LSCM).\n\nThe behaviour in the HBP after LSCM differs among different FLL:\n\n- Benign hepatocellular FLL, such as FNH, NRH, usually show uptake of LSCM (5, 6);\n\n- Border-line hepatocellular FLL, such as Hepatic adenoma, usually do not show uptake of LSCM (5, 6);\n\n- Non hepatocellular FLL, either benign (eg. Hemangioma) or malignant (cholangiocarcinoma, metastases), do not show uptake of LSCM (3, 7);\n\n- In the cirrhotic liver, regenerative or low grade dysplastic nodules (LGDN) usually show uptake of LSCM, while HGDN or HCC do not show uptake of LSCM (8).\n\nIn these patients, LSCM are especially helpful in case of nodules with atypical appearance in the dynamic phase (hypovascular; lack of washout), as the hypointensity in the HBP is suspicious for malignancy (9).\n\n- Finally, the elimination of the LSCM via the biliary pathway gives the possibility to further explore biliary diseases by using T1w images instead of MRCP, using functional information.\n\nIn conclusion, LSCM are an important tool to better identify and characterise FLL. In case of atypical imaging appearance of FLL at US or CT, their use is necessary. Moreover, in oncological patients as well as in cirrhotic patients their use improves the accuracy of MRI in the detection and characterization of FLL. Finally, some biliary diseases are better evaluated using the biliary elimination of LSCM.\n\nReferences\n\n1. Thian YL, Riddell AM, Koh D-M.

Chronic kidney disease is the most important risk factor for CA-AKI [1]. The poorer the renal function, the higher the risk of CA-AKI [2, 3]. The patient"
