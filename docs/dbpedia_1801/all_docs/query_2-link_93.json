        "meta_description": "In the late summer of 1894, Ottoman soldiers murdered thousands of Armenians in the Sasun mountains. This extreme state violence must be understood as part of a much broader phenomenon: the efforts of the Ottoman Empire to control its upland spaces during the nineteenth century. Ottoman state efforts to conquer and control the mountains throughout the empire were accompanied by its attempt to control legitimate narrative. Making use of a variety of sources, from the accounts of locals (including missionaries) to those of outsiders (such as Ottoman military officers, foreign consuls, and investigative journalists), this article will examine and explain why the violence in Sasun took place, how it happened, as well as how it was remembered.",

        "text": "4 [F. Scudamore], Daily News, March 29, 1895; FO 424/182, p. 2-4.\n\nOut[side] the village the slope was covered with people running in every direction. Some were carrying goods, some had children in their arms, others were helping each other along. [...] The officers shouted [...] Don’t fire, don’t fire. Kill with the bayonet.\n\nWhy did the violence happen?\n\n32 J. Hurewitz, 1956, p. 189-191.\n\nThe Sublime Porte engages to carry out without further delay the ameliorations and reforms which are called for by local needs in the provinces inhabited by Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and the Kurds. It will give information periodically of the measures taken for this purpose to the Powers, who will watch over the execution of them.\n\nHow did it happen?\n\nHow was it remembered?\n\n30There is very little evidence that the violence in the Sasun mountains in the summer of 1894 stemmed primarily from an attempt by villagers to rebel against the Ottoman state. Nearly all of the non-Ottoman documentation about Sasun presents a different story. These accounts are similar in broad strokes, yet possess distinct variations, which suggest multiple viewpoints. All the missionary accounts, published and confidential consul documents, investigative journalist reporting and Armenian language memoir accounts stress that the Ottoman military committed indiscriminate killings of unarmed mountaineers in Sasun based on faulty – and likely intentionally faulty – information from the vali of Bitlis, Tahsin Paşa. While there is a lot of variation in the details – on how people were killed, and how many – there is very little variation on the basic underlying story."
