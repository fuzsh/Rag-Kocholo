        "text": "In Vienna, Karl Landsteiner, MD (1868-1943), and Erwin Popper, MD (1879-1955), announced that the infectious agent in polio was a virus.\n\nPopper and Landsteiner deduced the viral nature of polio by carefully filtering preparations of spinal cord fluid from a person who had died of polio. The filters were known to trap bacteria. When Popper and Landsteiner injected the filtered preparations into monkeys, the monkeys developed polio. The researchers then concluded that an infectious particle smaller than bacteria caused the disease.\n\nPoliovirus itself would not be visible to researchers until the 1950s, when the electron microscope was available.\n\nIn a press conference at the University of Michigan, Thomas Francis Jr., MD (a scientist with extensive experience with influenza vaccines), and colleagues announced the results of the Salk poliovirus vaccine trial. The vaccine, they said, was 80-90% effective against paralytic polio.\n\nThe U.S. government licensed Salk’s vaccine later this same day. The press conference and licensure paved the way for widespread distribution and use of the vaccine.\n\nOn August 20, 1994, the Pan American Health Organization had reported that three years had passed since the last case of wild polio in the Americas. A three-year-old Peruvian boy, Luis Fermín, had the last registered case there.\n\nThe International Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication in the Americas examined this report as well as extensively reviewing lab and surveillance data. Based on the results of these analyses, wild poliovirus was declared eliminated from the Americas in September 1994, making the Americas the first World Health Organization Region to meet the goal of polio elimination.\n\nFourteen years after the launch of the global eradication program, the World Health Organization declared polio eliminated in Europe on June 6, 2002.\n\nThe last case of wild polio in Europe occurred in a young boy. Melik Minas, who lived in Turkey, contracted polio in November 1998. Minas, who had not been vaccinated, was paralyzed as a result of the infection—although he did partially recover."
