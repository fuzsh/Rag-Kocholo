        "meta_description": "Germline aryl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP) gene mutations confer a predisposition to pituitary adenoma (PA), predominantly GH-secreting (GH-PA). As recent data suggest a role for AIP in the pathogenesis of sporadic GH-PA and their response to somatostatin analogues (SSA), the expression of AIP and its partner, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), was determined by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry scoring in 62 sporadic GH-PA (37 treated with SSA preoperatively). The influence of Gsp status was studied in a subset of tumours (n=39, 14 Gsp+) and six GH-PA were available for primary cultures. AIP and AHR were detected in most cases, with a positive correlation between AIP and cytoplasmic AHR (P=0.012). Low AIP expression was significantly more frequent in untreated vs SSA-treated tumours (44.0 vs 20.5%, P=0.016). AHR expression or localisation did not differ between the two groups. Similarly, in vitro octreotide induced a median twofold increase in AIP expression (range 1.2–13.9, P=0.027) in GH-PA. In SSA-treated tumours, the AIP score was significantly higher in the presence of preoperative IGF1 decrease or tumour shrinkage (P=0.008 and P=0.014 respectively). In untreated tumours, low AIP expression was significantly associated with invasiveness (P=0.028) and suprasellar extension (P=0.019). The only effect of Gsp status was a significantly lower nuclear AHR score in Gsp+ vs Gsp− tumours (P=0.025), irrespective of SSA. In conclusion, AIP is involved in the aggressiveness of sporadic GH-PA, regardless of Gsp status, and AIP up-regulation in SSA-treated tumours is associated with a better preoperative response, with no clear role for AHR.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nThis extensive series of tumours from patients with sporadic acromegaly provides substantial new information on the effects of SSA on the expression of AIP and its best characterised molecular partner, AHR. In addition, it evaluates for the first time the influence of somatic Gsp mutations on such parameters.\n\nData obtained across the whole series are consistent with previous reports showing AIP down-regulation in aggressive somatotropinomas (Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2009, Kasuki Jomori de Pinho et al. 2011). However, tumour volume and proliferative activity were found to have a stronger impact on AIP expression than invasive features. AIP loss was significantly associated with suprasellar extension and higher Ki67 values regardless of preoperative SSA treatment, but it was significantly associated with invasiveness in untreated cases only. This indicates that preoperative pharmacological treatment introduces an important limitation in the use of AIP immunostaining as a marker of invasiveness in somatotropinomas. This is similar to the effect of SSA pretreatment on the Ki67 index, which can be significantly reduced by the anti-proliferative effects of SSA in GH-PA (Losa et al. 2001, Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2002, this study). Overall, low AIP expression was also associated with higher preoperative GH/IGF1 levels. Although this could, in part, be due to the lower proportion of low AIP–IHC tumours treated by SSA preoperatively, a trend towards higher preoperative GH levels in low AIP–IHC tumours was seen after correction for preoperative treatment on the whole series and in untreated tumours. Taken together, these findings indicate that low AIP–IHC tumours share common characteristics with AIPmut GH-PA (Daly et al. 2010). Notably, the higher percentage of GH/PRL adenomas reported in AIPmut PA has not been observed among low AIP–IHC somatotropinomas (Kasuki et al. 2012, this study). The mechanisms of AIP down-regulation in non-AIPmut somatotropinomas have been poorly investigated, but overexpression of the miR-107 has been recently proposed (Trivellin et al. 2012).\n\nDysregulation of AHR expression has been reported in a number of tumours (Harper et al. 2006, Dietrich & Kaina 2010) and reduced AHR (Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2009) and ARNT (Heliövaara et al. 2009, Raitila et al. 2010) expression have been observed in AIPmut PA. In this study, only 32% of sporadic GH-PA displayed a high AHR content. We found these tumours to be smaller and to include a higher proportion of pure GH-secreting PA than those displaying a low AHR content, suggesting that AHR down-regulation may also occur during the evolution of sporadic GH-PA. A significant correlation was found between AIP and AHRc, further supporting a role for AIP in the stabilisation of AHR in PA (Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2009). This may be attenuated by preoperative SSA treatment, potentially suggesting that the stability of the AIP/AHR complex may be influenced by SSA or that SSA differentially affect AIP and AHR expression in GH-PA. By contrast, despite AHR signalling being potentially enhanced by AIP (Petrulis & Perdrew 2002), AHRn was unrelated to AIP, irrespective of SSA treatment. Thus, the potential influence of AIP on AHR signalling in sporadic GH-PA remains unclear.\n\nData from a large series of sporadic GH-PA with proven normal AIP sequences in the majority of cases support recent evidence that AIP expression is increased by preoperative SSA treatment (Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2010, Chahal et al. 2012). Notably, similar results were obtained whether lanreotide (Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2010, Chahal et al. 2012, this study) or octreotide (Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2010, this study) was used for the preoperative treatment of acromegalic patients. In contrast, no change in AIP expression was observed in two AIPmut cases operated before and after treatment (Jaffrain-Rea et al. 2010). Supporting recent findings in GH3 cells (Chahal et al. 2012), this study provides the first evidence for a variable but significant up-regulation of AIP expression by octreotide in human GH-PA in vitro, with a median twofold increase. A significant relationship was also found between AIP immunostaining and the outcome of pre-surgical SSA treatment, both in terms of hormonal control and tumour shrinkage, further indicating AIP to be an important mediator of SSA in GH-PA. Indeed, the AIP score was significantly lower in uncontrolled tumours when compared with partially and fully controlled tumours and significantly higher in the presence of preoperative shrinkage. In particular, none of the tumours showing preoperative shrinkage had low AIP immunostaining, contrasting with 30% of those showing no effect of SSA on tumour volume. These results echo those obtained in a large series of AIPmut acromegalic patients, in which the median shrinkage with SSA was highly statistically significantly lower than in control acromegalic patients (0 vs 41%, P<0.000001; Daly et al. 2010). In this study, no difference was found according to the degree of disease control obtained at the time of surgery (IGF1 normalisation or reduction by ≥30% compared with baseline values). Owing to the retrospective and multicentre characteristics of our study, we might have been unable to distinguish between these two groups. Preoperative SSA treatment was not standardised, so that differences in the degree of response obtained before surgery did not necessarily reflect differences in SSA sensitivity. Additional factors may also be involved in the modulation of AIP by SSA. Chahal et al. (2012) found a positive correlation between AIP expression and IGF1 changes in female acromegalics only. A similar non-significant trend was present in our series (data not shown), but the higher proportion of female cases could have introduced some bias and no gender specificity could be shown. However, the unusual male predominance in AIPmut somatotropinomas (Daly et al. 2010) and reported interactions between AIP, AHR and steroid receptors (Beischlag et al. 2008), in particular oestrogen receptor α (Matthews & Gustafsson 2006, Cai et al. 2011), suggest potential variations in AIP expression or function according to patient's gender and the steroid milieu, which deserve further investigation.\n\nBecause the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 can be induced by SSA (Ferrante et al. 2006) and by AHR signalling (Marlowe & Puga 2005), we proposed the hypothesis that AHR itself could be a target of SSA in GH-PA. However, no significant difference in AHR content or in its nuclear localisation was observed between SSA-treated vs -untreated tumours, or according to the effect of treatment. Although there was some evidence that AHRc immunostaining could be higher in SSA-treated tumours, this was also unrelated to the effect of treatment and might be due to the higher AIP expression observed in treated GH-PA. Unexpectedly, a strong correlation was found between AHRn and AHRc in treated tumours. This may reflect the complex regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of AHR, which involves several exogenous and endogenous activators (Beischlag et al. 2008, Nguyen & Bradfield 2008). Overall, these data argue against a significant role for AHR in the pharmacological response to SSA in GH-PA.\n\nMost of the pharmacological effects of octreotide and lanreotide on GH-PA are mediated by somatostatin receptor (SSTR) subtypes 2 and 5 (Ben-Shlomo & Melmed 2010). AIP immunostaining was identified as a predictive factor of post-operative SSA sensitivity independent of SSTR2 (Kasuki et al. 2012) and a slightly higher SSTR5 expression was observed in AIPmut tumours (Chahal et al. 2012), suggesting that AIP-related differences in SSA sensitivity are not due to important changes in SSTRs. Potential variations in the expression of receptors reported to negatively affect the pharmacological response to SSA, such as truncated variants of SSTR5 (Durán-Prado et al. 2010, 2012) or the dopamine receptor D2R (Zatelli et al. 2005), have not been reported yet. An alternative molecular link between AIP expression and SSA signalling is ZAC1, a tumour suppressor gene involved in the anti-proliferative action of octreotide (Theodoropoulou et al. 2006), whose expression correlates with tumour shrinkage and IGF1 changes in treated GH-PA (Theodoropoulou et al. 2009). ZAC1 has been recently proposed to act downstream of AIP in GH3 cells (Chahal et al. 2012). However, potential correlations between AIP and ZAC1 expression in human GH-PA remain to be further explored.\n\nA relationship between AIP, AHR and cAMP signalling, the best characterised pathway in GH-PA and an important target of SSA, is suggested by experimental evidence indicating that i) cAMP is a non-ligand activator of AHR able to induce transcriptional responses different from exogenous ligands (Oesch-Bartlomowicz et al. 2005), ii) nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of AHR induced by cAMP is inhibited by PDE2, which is stabilised by AIP (de Oliveira et al. 2007) and iii) AIP interactions with PDE4A5 can be disrupted by AIP mutations (Leontiou et al. 2008). There is also very recent evidence that AIP reduces forskolin-induced cAMP signalling in GH3 cells, although forskolin did not influence AIP expression (Formosa et al. 2013). However, intracellular cAMP concentrations have not been reported in the presence of AIP abnormalities in GH-PA and the potential effect of cAMP signalling on AIP expression in these tumours is unknown. Because Gsp mutations induce a constitutive activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway, we studied AIP and AHR expression according to Gsp status. In agreement with most reports, no specific phenotype was observed in Gsp+ tumours, although they tended to respond better than Gsp− tumours to preoperative SSA treatment (Barlier et al. 1998, Lania et al. 2003). Accordingly, treated Gsp+ tumours had significantly lower Ki67 than their Gsp− counterpart. AIP expression was similar in Gsp+ and Gsp− tumours. Because only large Gsp+ tumours had a low AIP expression, down-regulation of AIP appears as a late event in Gsp+-related tumorigenesis. Notably, no Gsp mutations were found in a small series of AIPmut GH-PA, further suggesting that these are independent pathogenetic events (Angelini et al. 2010). Preoperative SSA treatment had no differential effect on AIP expression in Gsp+ and Gsp− tumours, and the effect of octreotide on AIP expression was unremarkable in the Gsp+ tumour studied in vitro. In contrast, some effect of Gsp status could be found on AHR expression and localisation. In Gsp− tumours, preoperative SSA was associated with a significantly higher AHR content and AHR was increased by octreotide in one of three Gsp− tumours studied in vitro. Therefore, SSA may induce AHR in a subset of Gsp− GH-PA. Unexpectedly, AHRn expression was lower in Gsp+ vs Gsp− GH-PA, regardless of AHR content, suggesting cytoplasmic retention of AHR in Gsp+ tumours. A potential explanation is that Gsp+ tumours activate regulatory mechanisms that operate to counteract the increase in cAMP concentration (Lania et al. 2003, Pertuit et al. 2009), among which is an increased PDE activity, which might in turn inhibit AHRn shuttling. In addition, cAMP signalling involves different subcellular compartments, which may differentially regulate endocrine functions and AHR activation in somatototroph cells. Indeed, cytoplasmic retention of AHR was also observed in treated Gsp+ tumours. The biological implications of these findings remain to be further investigated."
