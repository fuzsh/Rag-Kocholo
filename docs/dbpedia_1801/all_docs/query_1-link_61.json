I would like to thank the members of the examining board Prof Maria Antonietta Visceglia, from the Università di Roma La Sapienza, Prof Mario Biagioli, UC Davis School of Law, and my second reader Prof Bartolomé Yun-Casalilla, EUI and now Universidad Pablo de Olavide of Seville. Special thanks go to my patient supervisor Prof Antonella Romano, now director of the prestigious Centre Alexandre Koyré. The research for my thesis and postdoctoral investigation was mainly carried out at the library of the EUI, at the Galileo Museum in Florence, the Na­tional Library of Florence, the Biblioteca di Stato di Cremona, the Library of the Fundación Juanelo Turriano in Madrid, the Saxo Institute of the University of Copenhagen, the Veneranda Biblioteca Ambrosiana of Milan, The Medici Archive Project in Florence, the Max-Planck-Institut fürWissenschaftsgeschichte in Berlin, and the Centre Alexandre Koyré in Paris. I have also visited different archives in Italy, Spain, Germany and France. I want to thank all the passionate librarians and archivists that have helped me in my study. I am especially indebted to Almudena Pérez de Tudela (Patrimonio Nacional de España) who shared with me important documents about Janello. I would like to thank my friend Bjørn Okholm Skaarup, who first directed me to work on this topic and who gave me the very laptop with which I am writing this book, and Theo Pronk and Gojko Barjamovic for encouraging me. A special thank you goes also to Daniel Crespo Delgado of the Fundación Juanelo Turriano, for his constant and ready help and to the president Bernardo Revuelta Pol and to all the other friendly members of this institution. I have also to thank the Spanish committee that decided to award me with the 7th Garcia-Diego International Prise for the History of Technology. I need likewise to mention Prof Sven Dupré Director at the Max-Planck-Institut of the research group Art and Knowledge in Premodern Europe, Prof Luca Molà (EUI) and Dr Alessio Assonitis, Director of The Medici Archive Project, for their precious help. I cannot forget the walks and conversations held with the archaeologist and anthropologist Juanma Rojas and his lovely wife Teresa while exploring the ancient buildings of Toledo. I also want to thank Tommaso Munari, Joanna Milstein, Agnete Lassen, Marius Buning and many other colleagues who have provided me with their precious knowledge, passion and support. I appreciate the valuable help of Gary “Omobono” Kissick, for correcting my English and\n\nviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nsuggesting improvements to the draft, and the Department of History and Civili­­sation of the EUI, which has generously provided the necessary resources to fund his job. I also thank Mino Boiocchi, Andrea Bossola and Mario Liguigli and all the other photographers and institutions who allowed me to make use of the images present in this book. From September 2016 to January 2017, the City of Cremona and Unomedia gave me the opportunity to create an exhibition about Janello. Beside the organisers and sponsors, I would like to thank every single one of the 21,768 visitors that came to see it. Without the help of Cinzia Galli, Alessandro Maianti and Hora (Associazione Italiana Cultori Orologeria Antica) and its generous president Antonio Lenner, it would have not been possible to create this exhibition. A special credit goes also to the scholars that have participated in the conference connected to the exhibit: Alberto Lualdi, Anthony Turner, Günther Oestmann, Dietrich Matthes, Rocío Sánchez-Barrios, Tiemen Cocquyt, Michael Korey, Marisa Addomine, Daniele Pons, Hanoch Ben-Yami, Federica Favino and Giancarlo Truffa. I would like to thank the people who have been closer to me all these years: my mom Daria, my dad Annibale, my sister Greta, and my uncles Alberto and Gianni, my aunts Giuli and Nene, my lovely cousin Andrea, and my friends Marco, Anne, Alberto and Roberto. Finally, I owe a large debt of gratitude to my beloved Marta, marvellous partner and personal librarian. I apologise for the people I forgot to mention and that are entitled to be listed here: please consider it just a lapsus memoriae. Not to mention, all the errors remain mine.\n\nList of Illustrations List of Illustrations\n\nix\n\nList of Illustrations 1 2\n\nSouth view of Cremona 23 Giovanni Antonio de Sacchis, called Pordenone, Golgotha, fresco, 1520-1521, Cathedral of Cremona 26 3 Portrait of Niccolò Fontana, called Tartaglia.

It will show the central role that artisans formed in the Vitruvian tradition played in demonstrating through practical mathematics (also called mixed or applied) such as mechanics, perspective, practical astronomy, navigation, surveying, construction and the use of scientific instruments, etc., an increasing and positive control over Nature, a step rooted in humanist culture and foundational for the understanding of those historical processes known as the Scientific and the Industrial Revolutions. The educational and professional trajectories of these artisans, and their nobilitation thanks to humanist models, are key tools to reconsider the vexata quaestio introduced by Zilsel and Needham: why did “modern science” develop in Western Europe?1 Moreover, it is an ambition of this work to unveil the contextual cultural reasons behind the development of certain technologies, setting them free from the anachronistic clichés that tend to explain the construction of human science and technology within a narrative of alleged natural evolution. On the contrary, this work will show how now irrelevant and unexpected factors of techno-scientific development, such as astrology, medieval medicine, aristocratic prestige and princely authority, could act as paramount driving forces in the progress of early modern technology. The protagonist of this book is Janello Torriani, known in the Spanishspeaking world as Juanelo Turriano (Cremona, Italy ca. 1500 – Toledo, Spain 1585), the greatest among Renaissance inventors and constructors of machines. No one, until the end of his life, had ever designed and built more complex and bigger machines than him. From the four corners of the Habsburg Empire, and beyond, contemporary literates and mathematicians celebrated Janello Torriani and his creations in their writings. Those who have bestowed upon us 1 The Austrian Marxist philosopher of science Edgar Zilsel (1891-1944) saw in the growth of capitalism the necessary condition for the development of what he calls the “superior craftsman”, a concept that Janello Torriani’s story will help to reconsider. Zilsel built his thesis explaining why “Modern Science” originated in the West on the relation between economy, technological education and competition. The famous British sinologist and historian of science Joseph Needham’s question owes much to Zilsel’s thesis: Needham wondered why Modern Science developed in the West, and not in India or China, where scientific knowledge had been superior to that of the Western between the first and the fifteenth centuries of the Christian era.

Even the first book from China on European technology, published in the seventeenth century, was inspired by the amazement that news of the giant waterworks machine of Toledo by Torriani had provoked in that distant land.2 It is striking how such fame turned into nearly complete oblivion, leaving only a few clues of a blurred and distorted memory dispersed here and there. Oblivion and Rediscovery Janello Torriani was very famous in his own time, but he is rather obscure today.3 There are several reasons that explain why. First of all, one has to consider that Torriani was the court clockmaker, engineer, mathematician and inventor of Charles of Habsburg (fifth emperor, and first king of Spain of this name) and of Philip II of Spain. Political agendas originated in countries that since the sixteenth century desired to damage the image of Spain, and even political programs within Spain itself, especially in the last two centuries, have produced a harsh debate on the contribution of the Spanish monarchy to the development of modern science and technology. Janello, as the highest representative of the excellence of technology produced under Spanish royal patronage, was therefore a target for these biased and deceptive narratives. The so-called Leyenda Negra, or Black Legend, depicted Spain as a retrograde force of history, isolated and obsessed with religion, downplaying and ignoring its role in the development of science and technology during the early modern 2 Albert König, “Giulio Aleni SJ (1582- 1649) and the Introduction of Western Water Supply Methods in 17th Century China,” in Proceedings of WWAC2016 (4th IWA International Symposium on Water and Wastewater Technologies in Ancient Civilisations, Coimbra, 2016). 3 “Giannello Torriano da Cremona – il più popolare orologiaio che si conosca […] Tanto più strano e doloroso è constatare che una figura di primo piano come il Torriano, non abbia invogliato qualche storico del nostro tempo a intensificare le ricerche d’archivio”: Enrico Morpurgo, ed., Dizionario degli orologiai italiani: 1300-1800 (Milano: Nicola De Toma, 1974).Here the historian of clocks Enrico Morpurgo lamented the fact that during his time, despite Janello Torriani’s fame, no historian had yet conducted intense archival research on him.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nperiod. On the other hand, Spanish nationalists tried to represent an exaggerated portrait of the Spain of the Siglo de Oro, or Golden Age, as the precursor of all scientific and technological novelties.4 In both cases, Janello Torriani was marginalised: the Black Legend could not take into account a man that demonstrated the technological superiority of the Spanish Crown, whereas Spanish nationalists could not accept that a foreigner came to Spain to bring knowledge that was not yet there.5 Moreover, the grand narratives in the history of science did not usually take craftsmen as Janello Torriani into account. Starting in the 1930s, Alexandre Koyré inaugurated a new stage in the historiography of science and was the first to coin the phrase “Scientific Revolution”.6 Koyré’s view has been for a long time mainstream: it assumed that philosophers were responsible for the Scientific Revolution, and that they adopted the practical knowledge of the craftsmen, who were viewed merely as passive innovators. This historiographical tradition focused on those intellectual “contributors” who provided the bricks with which to build the idea of a progressive science based on a teleological and absolute truth.

Already at the beginning of the 1940s the Jewish Austrian philosopher of science Edgar Zilsel had singled out a certain type of Renaissance artisan, whom he labelled as “artistengineer” or “superior craftsman”, whom he considered a precursor of the Scientific Revolution: Beneath both the university scholars and the humanist literati there were some groups of superior craftsmen who needed more knowledge for their work than their colleagues did. The most important of them may be called artist-engineers, for not only did they paint their pictures, cast their statues, and build their cathedrals, but [they] also constructed lifting-gears, earthworks, canals and sluices, guns and fortresses, found new pigments, detected the geometrical laws of perspective, and invented new measuring tools for engineering and gunnery … They are the immediate predecessors of science. The two components of scientific method were still separated: methodical training of intellect was preserved for upper-class learned people, for university-scholars and humanist literati; experiment and observation were left, more or less, to plebeian workers. Real science is born when, with the progress of technology, the experimental method of the craftsmen overcomes the prejudice against manual work and is adopted by rationally trained university-scholars. This is accomplished with Galileo (1564-1642).7 Within the scholar-craftsman debate generated by Zilsel, several historians have tried to demonstrate the importance of artisans in the processes that led to the Scientific Revolution. Thanks to empirical and scholarly observation, the appreciation of technology and its practitioners is now well established in historiography.8 We shall soon go back to this problem, reconsidering Zilsel’s categories, and anticipating his chronology. 7 Edgar Zilsel and Joseph Needham, The Social Origins of Modern Science, ed. Diederick Raven, Wolfgang Krohn, and R. S Cohen, 1942 as The Sociological Roots of Science (Dordrecht; Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2000), 4-5. 8 Besides Marxist figures such as Boris Hessen, Henryk Grossmann, and other scholars endorsed the idea that there had been an artisanal influence in the making of the Scientific Revolution: among them we can remember Leonardo Olschki and Robert Merton. For an overview on this issue, see chapter I of Pamela Long’s Artisan/practitioners and the Rise of the New Sciences, 1400-1600 (Corvallis, OR: Oregon State University Press, 2011); and the introduction by Antonella Romano of the catalogue of the 2016-17 exhibition on Torriani held in Cremona: Janello Torriani, a Renaissance genius. Cristiano Zanetti, ed., Janello Torriani, a Renaissance Genius\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nThe marginalization of Torriani is also based upon a lack of physical evidence of what once made him universally famous. It has been said of Brunelleschi that “the contemplation of his creations alone says enough about him”.9 The opposite may be true of Janello Torriani: nothing of his great creations is left, despite the fact that during his lifetime, as seen before, in and beyond Europe the machines he built for the Emperor and his son the King of Spain, the first two “global rulers”, were beyond comparison. As in an archaeological layer, only the negative imprint left by the great volume these lost technological wonders once occupied points to the role Torriani’s inventions have in the history of technology. Under Habsburg patronage, Torriani had created a number of technological devices that were hailed by his contemporaries as mechanical marvels. These included the first known machine-tool to cut gears, something he used to create the most complex and compact machine ever seen up to his days: the Microcosm. This was a planetary automaton, enriched by almost two thousand mechanical components; moreover, he built the Crystalline, another planetary clock enclosed in a rock-crystal case so that the eye could see the intricate clockwork in motion; and, above all, he created the first giant machine of history, the Toledo Device, a 300 meters-long complex structure that could elevate water over a slope of about 100 meters. Besides these amazing achievements, Torriani also participated in the Gregorian reform of the calendar, contributing a tract and mathematical instruments for calculus, and he served the Crown of Spain, and other minor patrons, with waterworks surveying, bell designing and casting, celestial observations, and the production of automata and other curious creations, such as a combination lock, ingenious applications of gimbals, hydraulic pumps, portable mills, and scientific instruments. Janello Torriani’s story is at the same time exceptional and exemplary. On the one hand, it represents the distinctive path of the most impressive constructor of machines of the Renaissance. On the other, we can also consider Torriani as a paradigmatic figure: he perfectly represents the traditional categories of the (Cremona: Comune di Cremona, 2016), 10-12. See also A.

This book wants to retrieve from oblivion one of the most important and forgotten actors of Renaissance technology, and at the same time, by following his trajectory, this inquiry attempts to partially deconstruct the above-mentioned categories, rethinking them, and to explore how innovative knowledge was created, and how technological invention and innovation were practiced and how they circulated in sixteenth-century Europe. My research is informed by the work of that group of historians who, since the time of Edgar Zilsel, and even more intensively in the last decades, have attempted to address the concerns raised by social and cultural issues in the history of science and technology. This book aspires to be a contextualised biography, in which unfold the education, social rise, transnational mobility, and multifaceted activities of an amazingly skilled artisan, located between theoretical knowledge and practice, between urban space – where he had his guild-controlled workshop, and where he was invested with mathematical public offices – and the court.10 In this latter context, since the appearance 10\n\nIn so doing, I have been particularly inspired by the new biographical genre that aims to use an individual life to describe and analyse social and cultural changes. In recent years scholars have shown an increasing interest in the problem of biography as a historiographical genre. Although French and German sociologists and social historians traditionally attributed scientific value only to macro-analysis of structures through quantitative examination, and rejected biography as anecdotal and event-based, the rise of microhistory in Italy during the 1970s showed a way of integrating the level of daily life into social history. Some historians have even talked of a “biographical turn”. See for example Jacques Revel, Giochi di scala: la microstoria alla prova dell’esperienza (Roma: Viella, 2006); Hans Erich Bödeker, ed., Biographie schreiben (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2003); Volker R Berghahn and Simone Lässig, Biography between Structure and Agency: Central European Lives in International Historiography (New York: Berghahn Books, 2008); and recent monographs such as: Nigel Hamilton, Biography: A Brief History (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007); Barbara Caine, Biography and History (Basingstoke; New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010); Michael Rustin, “Reflections on the Biographical Turn in Social Science,” in The Turn to Biographical Methods in Social Science: Comparative Issues and Examples, ed.

Moran,12 have shifted the focus of their analysis in the history of science and technology to courtly structures. Within this perspective, the problem of “patronage” has become a central issue and a necessary field of analysis for those who desire to understand ancien regime society, its economy, its dynamics and its rules; in a word, its culture.13 This book aims to demonstrate how the career of a successful Renaissance engineer offers an extremely effective means of analysing these patronage structures, and to understand how princely patronage influenced technological evolution: the problem of technological innovation and of the professions involved with it, especially within the fields of micro- and macro-mechanics, has been explored in relation to “power”. Another structural analytical tool that informs my inquiry is “network” and the 11 12\n\n13\n\nNorbert Elias, The Court Society (New York: Pantheon Books, 1983).

Anthony Molho, in an essay on Cosimo de Medici the Elder, has given a forceful example of such a structure in the fifteenth-century Italian context, highlighting the complexity and the brokerage function of patronage: Anthony Molho, “Cosimo de Medici: ‘Pater patriae’ or ‘Padrino?,’” Stanford Italian Review I/I (1979). In defining “patronage”, I borrow the definition R. Weissman attempted to standardise in 1987 for the Mediterranean world. Regarding Weissman’s geographical distinction, I could not find a diversified patronage system in the Habsburg Empire stretching from the Netherlands down to Sicily passing through Burgundy, Germany, Italy and Spain. This Mediterranean geographical definition may have more to do with Weissman’s perception of continuity between Ciceronian ancient Roman models of networks of power and a more recent view of the Mediterranean as being more corrupt than central and northern European countries. According to Weisseman, Mediterranean patron-client relationships share the following attributes: first, there exists an inequality of power or resources between patron and client; second, patronage is a long-term relationship, with a moral or social rather than a legal basis; third, a patronage relationship is not restricted to a single kind of transaction, it is multi-standard and multipurpose; fourth, patronage is a relationship in which the patron provides more than simple protection. He provides brokerage, mediation, favours, and access to networks of friends of friends; and, fifth, Mediterranean patronage has a distinctive ethos, standing outside the officially proclaimed social morality.

These concepts allowed me to investigate how and why this man from the periphery of the empire could become one of the closest companions of Emperor Charles V. Other processes highly relevant for the narrative of this book are “education” and “ennoblement”. The success of people like Janello Torriani, with his late but remarkable professional blossoming, did not spring from mere chance, but from educated talent. This book will illustrate how Torriani’s education was strictly dependent on humanist culture. Humanist pedagogy, the rise of mathematical public offices in the medieval Italian city republics and in nu Renaissance courts, allowed artisans to draw from different disciplines in order to perform invention – or, to put it better, innovation Paradoxically, despite this book seeking to avoid adopting the panegyric agenda of celebrative biography, the myth of Janello Torriani was the starting point of my investigation: following the clockmaker’s entrance into the Habsburg sphere, a series of acclamatory materials, both visual and literary, was created, giving the historian a generous quantity of evidence to analyse. These abundant documentary traces – administrative, narrative, poetic and visual – have enabled me to raise questions about sixteenth-century technological innovation, its practitioners and their relation to power. I have looked at sculptures, medals, poems, paintings and literature celebrating Janello not simply as tokens of success, as they were “natural” reactions to his outstanding creations; my view is that they were part of a language spoken mainly at court, a language which was articulated for specific reasons: as such, those signs should be read according to a syntax of power in which the artisan negotiated a higher social status and his patrons exploited his ingenuity to increase their prestige, or glory, as Jacob Burckhardt and Edgar Zilsel would have it.14 Janello Torriani and his powerful brokers and patrons made use of his successful creation of mechanical devices, as they were “instruments of credit”15 to build and strengthen, together with the craftsman’s reputation as a unique creator, “the prince among the architects of clocks” – as Charles V called him – their prestigious humanist role as protectors of a new Archimedes. As previously seen, Janello Torriani’s marvelous creations had a relevant impact on early modern Spanish literature, and one can find still today a revival\n\n14\n\n15\n\nPaul Zanker, The Power of Images in the Age of Augustus (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2002); and David Freedberg, The Power of Images: Studies in the History and Theory of Response (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1989).

The story which inspired the latter saying was that of Filippo Brunelleschi and his refusal to show his model for the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence; fearing the idea might be stolen, the architect devised a stratagem to challenge his competitors: “he who could make an egg stand firmly on the smooth marble, would by doing show his skill and construct the dome. And an egg being brought, all the masters tried to make it stand upright, but none found the way. When the egg was given to Filippo, he picked it up gracefully and hitting it on its base upon the marble floor … made it stand upright. Rumbling the architects that similarly they would have been able to do that, Filippo answered them, laughing, that would they have still been able to curve the dome, seeing previously his model and drawing. And so it was resolved that he should be charged with conducting\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\ntravel across Castile and Extremadura and find people attributing without basis hydraulic systems and sundials to Janello. Even the monumental monolithic columns put up in Franco’s time at the sides of the street leading to the controversial monument of El Valle de los Caídos, columns that had been lying in the countryside for centuries and whose origin remains a mystery, are commonly believed to have been creations of Janello, and are indeed called “los Juanelos”. This image of Janello Torriani as an ingenious inventor, sometimes distorted into a necromancer, is especially rooted in Toledo, where his waterworks with their imposing physical presence in the metropolitan space revealed Torriani’s rare skills to the admiration of a wide section of society. From the time he built these machines, and in the decades that followed his death, the Toledo Device became what today we would define as a “tourist attraction”. Literary production targeting an audience that went far beyond the court repeatedly mentioned this machine, inviting visitors to Toledo to admire it. Once it had disappeared, the memory of this incredible machine was turned into a phantasmal legend of a wooden automaton that used to collect food at the Archbishop’s palace for his old and poor master Janello.20 In our own days, landscapes in Madrid, Toledo and Cremona carry the blurred and mysterious memory of Janello Torriani,21 and his appearance in local historiographies (Spanish and Lombard) as a genius worthy of celebration, reflecting the excellence of the genius loci, bringing honor and prestige to both his ancestral and adoptive countries, calls out for a trans-national investigation, which points to two different and largely independent traditions. For the first time, the two historiographies and already published and unpublished archival documents from both Italy and Spain are integrated into an organic narrative, which represents one of the most interesting technical and scientific careers of the early modern period.\n\n20 21\n\nthis work”.

These two historiographical ideas, that Westerners traditionally consider as crucial momenti in the making of our present world, have a common conceptual ancestry: more than simple chronological markers, these concepts are tools that historians had used to highlight problems of origins, continuity and ruptures in knowledge, often having searched for the mirage of the dawn of Modernity. The very concept of Modernity is a projection cast upon something in the past whose quality or shape resembles structures or institutions that we may recognise as specifically belonging to us. Perhaps paraphrasing Benedetto Croce, who stated that history is always contemporary, in his famous book on The Scientific Revolution, Steven Shapin observed: “the people, the thoughts, and the practices we tell stories about as ‘ancestors,’ or as the beginning of our lineage, always reflect some present-day interest”.23 In 1940 Ferguson referred to the Renaissance as “the most intractable problem child of historiography”.24 The child has now grown old, but shows no sign of recovery. The concept of the Renaissance has changed over time in terms of its function within the intellectual milieu, bias and agendas of historians, giving birth to one of the most problematic fields of historiography. Torriani embodies the elements that Burckhardt observed and described as the foundations 22\n\n23 24\n\nWith the concept of “Vitruvian artisan” I try here to identify a most distinctive group within what Edgar Zilsel had called “superior craftsmen” and “artist-engineers”. See the last paragraphs of this introduction. Steven Shapin, The Scientific Revolution (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 7. Wallace K Ferguson, The Renaissance (New York: H. Holt and Co., 1940), 7. Ferguson’s comment was a play on Burckhardt’s earlier formulation: “In the character of these States, whether republics or despotisms, lies, not the only, but the chief reason for the early development of the Italian. To this it is due that he was the firstborn among the sons of modern Europe”. See Jacob Burckhardt, “The Development of the Individual,” in The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (Mineola, NY: Dover Publlications, 2010), 82-103.In recent years, there has been a vigorous debate as to whether to consider the Renaissance as a period, as a cultural movement, or as a style. Each of these three conceptualizations of the Renaissance has complex chronological limits: historians have adopted various different boundaries according to their analytical foci. Recently, Marguerite L. King has suggested a lattice in order to embrace all different conceptions of the Renaissance. She has gathered all different mainstream positions in three categories: small, medium, and largesized Renaissance: Margaret L. King, The Renaissance in Europe (London: Laurence King Publishing, 2003), viii-xii..\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nof what he theorised as modern man: the manifestation of the individual, his desire for glory, the power of will, and the expression of a remarkable wit. The contemporary array of representations of Janello Torriani as an individual with unique skills and personality overlaps with the problem of Renaissance individualism or selfdom.25 Beside the written material in which the clockmaker’s personality emerges, Torriani appears to be the first artisan coming from the populace to be celebrated during his lifetime – and therefore to have been bestowed upon us – with the full humanist linguistic armory: medals, paintings, sculpture, assimilation to Classical icons, eulogy and poetry. As we shall see, another focal point in Torriani’s story that belongs with the problem of the Renaissance is the role played by humanist culture in creating the necessary conditions for a constant specular game played with the myth of Classical Antiquity. It is a statement of this book to consider as an essential step to the transition to a new science the role played by artisans like Janello, who were formed in humanist classical culture. However, the concept of Humanism, for me so essential to understand Janello Torriani’s education and career, has also been the object of intense debate in historiography. Some historians see in Humanism a philosophical movement (for instance Eugenio Garin and Hans Baron), while others, such as Paul Oskar Kristeller, consider it a rhetorical style. However, Kristeller’s authoritative view seems not to be able to confute completely the philosophical essence of what Hans Baron has conceptualised as “Civic Humanism”, i.e., a moral philosophy fashioned in Florentine society (and especially in the chancery of Coluccio Salutati and Leonardo Bruni) consequent to the dramatic siege of the city by the despot of Milan at the beginning of the fifteenth century. I here consider Humanism as a moral philosophy that goes beyond Florence, rooted in medieval Italian city republics’ administration and in Italian medieval universities, and that aims to readapt ancient Roman values (real, rhetorical or mythical) to Christian modernity. The power of Humanism was, in my eyes, the capability of empowering any discourse (even politically opposite ones, such as republicanism and despotism) with the prestige of Antiquity. The power of its rhetoric was able to influence a society highly receptive to ancient Roman 25\n\nThe concept of individualism has been widely criticised and reformulated by scholarship.

Humanist values are not just here considered as causes of Janello’s formation, but also as rhetorical filters we need to be aware of: this confrontation with classical culture emerges constantly in Janello’s life, from his education to his professional objectives and to the way he self-fashioned his public image. This book aims to move beyond the myth of the categories of “Renaissance genius” and “Renaissance polymath”, deconstructing them.27 Katharine Park and Lorraine Daston have written that: “The multifaceted ‘Renaissance man’ is to some extent a trick of historical perspective, which creates polymathesis out of what was simply a different classification of knowledge and a different ­professional division of labor.” For this reason, “early modern career trajectories can often appear to modern eyes at once dazzlingly diverse and oddly\n\n26\n\n27\n\nHans Baron, The Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance : Civic Humanism and Republican Liberty in an Age of Classicism and Tyranny, 2 vols. (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1955); Eugenio Garin, Medioevo e rinascimento: studi e ricerche, 2a ed, Biblioteca di cultura moderna 506 (Bari: Laterza, 1961). On the 29th of January 2017 the exhibition Janello Torriani, genio del Rinascimento (i.e. in English: Janello Torriani, a Renaissance Genius) closed its doors with the unexpected success of almost 22,000 sold tickets. Together with Professor Cinzia Galli, I had curated this exhibition, basing it on my PhD thesis defended in 2012 at the European University Institute. My idea was to name the exhibition “Genius ex Machina”, a play on words on the popular Latin expression Deus ex machina. In my eyes, this title was able to convey the idea of somebody capable as Torriani to solve mechanical problems that nobody else was able to overcome succesfully, and at the same time to transmit an idea of artificiality to the role played by Janello as a genius. My PhD thesis, like the named exhibition and the present book, aims to reject the idea of “genius” as an inborn phenomenon and tries instead to unfold the educational processes that shaped his skills. However, the press office of the exhibition decided to change the title with the excuse that “Janello Torriani, a Renaissance Genius” was going to be better understood by a general audience. Despite my useless protests that such a title had an assertive tone, proposing a reading of the term that was opposite to my intent, this story demonstrates how the idea of the inborn genius is still strongly embedded in society to explain successful careers. The controversial use of the term “genius” has recently attracted new attention in academia: for instance, since 2014, at CRASSH – University of Cambridge – Dr Alexander Marr is directing an ERCfunded research project named Genius Before Romanticism: Ingenuity in Early Modern Art and Science.\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\ncircumscribed”.28 In order to accomplish this task, I have focused on the problem of the education received by an individual such as Torriani whom a general audience may acknowledge as a typical “Renaissance genius”. However, superior craftsmen, or more appropriately “Vitruvian artisans”, such as Torriani overcame the epistemic boundaries of their time, embodying to a certain extent a contextualised case of polymathesis. In our case, Classical models provided Janello with an innovative curriculum and a mythical aura. Mario Biagioli’s book on Galileo’s instruments of credit opens an innovative analysis of “the aura of greatness, genius, and perhaps even sacredness” of scientific characters. Biagioli argues that the historian can consider this “aura as a mappable effect of negotiations … The aura, therefore, is not just a result (the a posteriori recognition of one’s work), but a resource for producing that work in the first place, as well as for securing its acceptance from patrons and fellowpractitioners (the way the financial backing of a project is a necessary step toward its possible, but by no means necessary, success).”29 In this perspective, I will consider Janello Torriani’s aura of a new Archimedes not just as the result of “a posteriori recognition”, but also as a possible effect of a strategy to obtain re­­sources and credit to realise innovative technologies and win a better social and economic position. For instance, nearly nothing is known about the first thirty years of his life, and such an obscure background has enabled not just later panegyrists, but also Torriani’s coeval ones to manipulate it according to humanist models, representing him as a natural born genius. For this reason, I have attempted to shed light on the “prehistory of the Renaissance genius” – or as we may call it more appropriately today, of the Vitruvian artisan – when Janello had put together the toolkit that made him desired and employable at the Mount Olympus of the talented: the imperial court. Before proceeding on the concept of Vitruvian artisan, we should introduce another of the problem-siblings of the Renaissance, the “Scientific Revolution”.30 28\n\n29 30\n\nLorraine Daston and Katharine Park, “Introduction: The Age of the New,” in The Cambridge History of Science, ed.

Biagioli, Galileo’s Instruments of Credit., See chapter 1: “Financing the Aura: Distance and the Construction of Scientific Authority”. In this book Janello’s career will enable us to take a brief look at another “problem child” of historiography: the Reformation. It seems that Emperor Charles V and his son Philip II were to use Toriani’s inventions to boast of a Catholic scientific superiority over the Protestant princes. We cannot at present say whether this was the result of a conscious policy. But, for certain, the flaunting of Janello Torriani’s mechanical marvels, whose inner mysteries were kept secret, triggered a vibrant competition among the Protestant courts as well, whose princes started to patronise similar projects.\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nThe Scientific Revolution is usually described as pertaining to the moment around 1600 when in Europe a new knowledge about the natural world and the growth of technological crafts surpassed the ones of the ancient Greco-Roman world, setting out an allegedly new scientific method and confuting the previous authorities. These changes were wrought mainly thanks to new discoveries in the fields of technology, geography, astronomy and anatomy. Historians and philosophers of Science have interpreted this moment as a radical and dramatic break from the medieval past, coining the phrase Scientific Revolution to define it. Though this presumed revolution has no clear chronology, the importance attributed by Galileo and Kepler to Copernicus’ De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium (1543) and Vesalius’ contemporary printing of the De Humani Corporis Fabrica made these two works an ideal point of reference for the narrative of the Scientific Revolution. Like the Renaissance, the chronology attributed to the Scientific Revolution depends much on the focus of individual scholars, and reflects a long-standing problem relating to continuity and ruptures in the conquest of “modernity”. It has been observed that the narrative of the Scientific Revolution “will last as long as the myth of modernity, of which it is part and parcel”.31 As Shapin also wrote: “The past is not transformed into the ‘modern world’ at any single moment: we should never be surprised to find that seventeenth-century scientific practitioners often had about them as much of the ancient as the modern”.32 Western historians consider the ­dynamics reflected by the definitions of Renaissance and Scientific Revolution (together with the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution) to be critical in the history of the world. Koyré approached the problem of science from a philosophical angle, as an intellectual history of ideas. He identified the works of those philosophers who reshaped the perception of the structure of the Cosmos as the most significant representatives of this drastic turn. In his seminal book From the Closed World to the Infinite Universe, published in 1957, he claimed that the so-called seventeenth century Scientific Revolution reflected a radical shift in the very basis of European philosophy. Refusing simplified contrapositions between old spiritual approaches and modern pragmatic ones (for instance, the substitution of an alleged medieval vita contemplativa with a modern vita activa), Koyré described this turn, or crisis of European consciousness, as a dramatic change in the very foundations of Western philosophy, namely, in its very vision of the Whole. This was the reason why he considered this change as the most important moment in the history of science, which he saw as the birth of the “Modern World”. Thomas Kuhn’s analysis of the 31 32\n\nDaston and Park, “Introduction: The Age of the New,” 16. Shapin, Scientific Revolution, 7.\n\n16\n\nIntroduction\n\nstructure of scientific revolutions helps us today to view this shift in European epistemology as a long and complex phenomenon, and not as a sudden revolution.33 While the idea of a Scientific Revolution has been challenged and deconstructed, it still stands because of the magnitude of changes that it describes: changes that occurred in European culture during that period and gave birth to a different science based on a new epistemology built upon the experimental method and mathematics. It has been noted that since the sixteenth century, mathematicians and philosophers have demonstrated an awareness of the innovative character of their contributions to the understanding of Nature. Writers associated with the natural sciences included with increasing boldness the adjective “new” in the titles of their works. And so, we see this adjective used in the Nova Scientia by Nicolò Tartaglia (1537), in the New Attractive by Robert Norman (1581), in the Machinae Novae by Fausto Veranzio (1595), in the Nova horologiorum inventio by Cherubino Sandolino (1599), in the Nuovo Teatro di Machine et Edificii by Vittorio Zonca (1607), in the Astronomia Nova by Johannes Kepler (1609), in the Novum Organon (1620) and in the New Atlantis (1627) by Francis Bacon, in the Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche intorno a due nuove scienze by Galileo Galilei (1638) and in the De Mundo Nostro Sublunari Philosophia Nova by William Gilbert (1651), and this is citing but a few of only the most famous titles. These thinkers were aware that their work stood in opposition to something, which they perceived, or wanted to represent, as traditional. Such claims to novelty have challenged the minds of philosophers and historians, who have speculated about the existence and consistency of such a turn. Recent historiography has named this period, roughly covering the Cinque­ cento, “The Age of the New”.34 Though even Kuhn endorsed Koyré and Hall’s mainstream idea that it was the literati and not the craftsmen who were the agents of this shift of paradigm towards “modern science”, the increasing relevance technology has gained in our world, plus the crisis of ideologies and the social changes in Western society – now less dismissive of manual labour – has stimulated new investigation of the technical people during the Scientific Revolution, and once marginalised theses such as Zilsel’s are now attracting new interest. From geographical discoveries to the invention of new machines and techniques that proliferated in sixteenth century Latin Christendom, we can see that it was the field of technology and practical mathematics that was 33 34\n\nThomas S Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970). Daston and Park, “Introduction: The Age of the New,” 1-5.\n\nIntroduction\n\n17\n\nfirst giving strength to this mental revolution in consciousness for western Europeans, who believed for the first time that they could surpass the knowledge of their ancient models, acquiring a new self-confidence to advance ars and scientia. Thanks to the mechanical clock, to Filippo Brunelleshi’s revolutionary mathematical techniques in dome construction and in mathematical perspective, to Aristotle of Bologna’s incredible engineering performances, to Leonardo’s visionary projects, to naval architecture, to new geographical and natural discoveries, and to Torriani’s unbelievable mechanical creations, the intellectuals of the Renaissance understood that their society had overcome the giants of Antiquity.35 And this had happened through sensible experience and practical mathematics. The famous quote attributed to Bernard of Chartres during the twelfth century – “sumus nanos super homeros gigantium” – that is to say, if we see far, it is not of our own merit, but because we are like dwarves standing upon the shoulders of giants, turned now towards a paritarian relationship with classical Greco-Roman science. The present book wants to contribute to the scholar-craftsman debate showing how unexpected technical achievemnets could influence the consciousness of Renaissance society, and demonstrating how the application of mathematics to practical problems could efficiently empower humanity over Nature, overcoming limits previously considered insurmountable. As late as 1991 Jim Bennet wrote: “There were many different sorts of mathematics in the early modern world … and the branch most neglected by historians – practical mathematics – in many ways proved the most progressive, thanks to urgent new contexts of use, such as navigation”. Practical or applied mathematics, also described in the Aristotleian tradition as scientiae mediae or µηχανη, are here to be intended as mechanics, perspective, and speculative astronomy.36 A couple of decades after Bennet, we can say that the role of technology and of its practitioners in the scientific development of theories has occupied a paramount position in historiography. Indeed, it has been argued that the “new” scientific knowledge of the Early Modern Period was rooted in the practical one of the sixteenth century. With the end of the Cold War, which often led to the marginalization of Marxist theories such as 35\n\n36\n\nAlex Keller, “A Byzantine Admirer of ‘Western’ Progress: Cardinal Bessarion,” Cambridge Historical Journal 11, no. 3 (1955): 343-48.

Smith argues for full epistemological dignity for the artisanal world in its reading of Nature through the senses of its practitioners. Nonetheless, it seems that she, like Zilsel more than half a century earlier, accepts a dichotomy between a “high culture” and a technical one as a faithful representation of Renaissance epistemology.38 In order to emphasise the scientific dignity of craftsmen’s sensibly justified understanding of Nature, Smith coined the phrase “artisanal epistemology”. This book calls for a less sharply separated representation of Renaissance artisanal and university knowledge, as for a less Manichean contraposition between humanists and 37\n\n38\n\nIn the last decades there have been many seminal works published in this field: Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer, Leviathan and the Air-Pump : Hobbes, Boyle, and the Experimental Life (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1985); Antonio Sánchez, “La voz de los artesanos en el Renacimiento científico: cosmógrafos y cartógrafos en el preludio de la ‘nueva filosofía natural,’” Arbor 186 (2010): 449-60; Harold J.

Walton, and John Andrew Schuster, eds., Mathematical Practitioners and the Transformation of Natural Knowledge in Early Modern Europe, (Cham: Springer, 2017). Unfortunately, I was not able to use this new work that testifies for a revival of this kind of interest in the philosophy of science. I was particularly inspired by the work of the American scholars Pamela O. Long and Pamela Smith, who have shaken the debate by taking more cogent material to testify for an artisanal influence in the Scientific Revolution. Long, Artisan/practitioners; Smith, Body of the Artisan. Zilsel’s view of the importance of technical but learned men in the shift towards what we call “modern science” was still biased by his belief in a strict dichotomy between scholars and craftsmen in the Renaissance, a dichotomy that, according to him, came to an end in the seventeenth century, when scientists endorsed the knowledge of the artist-engineer. Despite the contributions of Keller and Rossi, who pointed to the presence of the belief in scientific and technological progress in both university and artisanal contexts, even recent historiography has tended to endorse a narrative of two parallel dimensions of knowledge: the province of learned higher education and the mechanical and illiterate sphere of the workshop.\n\nIntroduction\n\n19\n\nAristotelians:39 the case study of Janello Torriani, together with some other well known examples, shows how this artisanal scientia was to be found only in certain workshops – those of Zilsel’s “superior craftsmen” which hosted literati who transferred the categories of Latin and Greek theoretical knowledge to these curious and talented artisans. The latter, in turn, brought the power of their fresh imagination, their curiosity, and their refined practical experience – the long-trained skills of their hands – to interpret scientific texts. Pamela O. Long, another influential American scholar, has shown how artisans interacted with scholars during the Renaissance in specific “trading zones”, to be understood as common areas of interest where both scholars and craftsmen could cooperate, such as antiquarianism, water-supply projects, and the text by Vitruvius itself.40 In our story the “trading zones” that allowed Janello to overcome epistemological boundaries by interacting with scholars are also medicine, urban mathematical public offices, and courtly-related practical mathematical projects. The necessary role played by these “learned practitioners” in the construction of a new consciousness of scientific dignity calls now for a more precise definition which can describe the specific European cultural context that produced them. Zilsel’s concepts of “superior craftsman” and “artist engineer” are here substituted by the one of the “Vitruvian artisan”. This figure developed during the Quattrocento, when Vitruvius was most celebrated and influential, and his famous statement about knowledge being the offspring of theory and practice was held in great esteem, something that Pamela O. Long has shown in detail in the chapter Artisans, Humanists and De Architectura of Vitruvius.41 39\n\n40 41\n\nMany influential scholars of the history of philosophy and of the Renaissance have noticed that it is impossible to speak of a single Aristotelianism in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, in light of the different interpretations (often contradictory) that were in circulation, or even by Aristotelianism seen as a school, given the mobility of professors in the universities of the era. Kristeller has also shown that the contraposition between humanism-scholasticism should be treated with great caution: in the Renaissance this dichotomy was not absolute, but it was more a part of a discourse made up by some influential humanists. For an introduction to the theme, well accompanied by examples, see the essay: Eugenio Garin, “Aristotelismo veneto e scienza moderna,” in Umanisti, artisti, scienziati: studi sul rinascimento italiano (Roma: Riuniti, 1989), 205-28; and Paul Oskar Kristeller, “Humanism and Scholasticism in the Italian Renaissance,” in Humanism and Scholasticism in the Italian Renaissance, ed.

See Long, Artisan/practitioners.\n\n20\n\nIntroduction\n\nThough Vitruvius’s De Architectura had been known during the Middle Ages,42 being mainly studied in monasteries and Cathedral schools, it was in a booming urban society obsessed with Classical culture and shaken by a thriving social mobility, like the one of the late Middle Ages, that such books could meet the interests of ambitious craftsmen. The pervasion of urban culture with humanist ideology transformed Vitruvius and other classical literature into a “prestige-maker”: the craftsman could use it as a powerful tool for social climbing, whereas the wealthy patron (both as an individual or as an institution) interested in civil or military constructions could dress himself with a Vitruvian garment woven by the scholar and the superior craftsman, adopting the charisma of a new Augustus. I consider the phrase “superior craftsman” too general a definition that does not acknowledge the specific humanist background of careers such as the ones of Lorenzo Ghiberti, Filippo Brunelleschi, Aristotle of Bologna, Filarete, Bramante, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo and Janello Torriani, to name a few. Their educational background and social aspirations were strictly dependent on Vitruvius’ idea of “architectura”. The concept of “artist-engineer” is instead too specific, and has to do with the Vasarian idea of fine arts (painting, sculpture and architecture intended mainly as building design), excluding many practitioners such as Torriani who did not paint, sculpt or draw the beautiful facades, but who were able to design machines and construct them inspired by classical texts and aspiring to an intellectual dignity. 42\n\nThere are around 80 extant medieval copies of Vitruvius.

The historical origins of Cremona go back to the time Hanni­ bal was crossing the Alps with his elephants: it was founded in Celtic land by the Romans in 218 B.C. together with the twin colony of Placentia (the modern Piacenza, around 30 km away on the southern bank of the river) in order to control Cisalpine Gaul. The city grew rich and prosperous. Despite two major destructions, suffered in ad 69 and at the time of the Germanic Langobardic invasion at the beginning of the seventh century, the city flourished once again in the Middle Ages, becoming one of the most important City Republics or Communes of Northern Italy. By the fourteenth century the city had lost its ancient freedom and had become a part of the Visconti dominion that had its capital in Milan, some 80 km away. By 1535, at the time of Janello Torriani’s adulthood, the duchy of Milan had lost its last autochthonous ducal family, the Sforza, and the state was now ruled by imperial governors under the direct control of Charles V, and later by Spanish ones. Milan was the metropolis of\n\nfigure 1\n\nSouth view of Cremona.

Its wealth came from different factors, the most important being probably its grasp on the commercial routes that ran along the lakes of Como and Maggiore to the Swiss passes that led to Northern Europe. Cremona, on the other hand, had some 40,000 residents at its peak during the sixteenth century, and provided a 250,000 scudi revenue during the second half of the century, 1/4 of the taxes of the whole duchy and 1/2 of what Milan paid. Cremona, beside agriculture, was mainly involved in textile manufacture: it has been calculated that by 1580, 92% of its export consisted of fustian – a cloth with a cotton weft and a linen warp.1 Cremona stood at the centre of a neuralgic network of cities, which belonged to different states: on the West one could easily reach Lodi (49 km) and Pavia (72 km), both part of the same duchy; on the East stood Mantua (65 km) and the small universe of tiny states ruled by the many branches of the Gonzaga family, some of them just a few kilometers outside of the city-walls; southwards lay Parma (54 km), together with Piacenza once part of the duchy of Milan and latter both dominion of the dusky dynasty of the Farnese; and on the northern side were Brescia (50 km), Bergamo (74 km) and Crema (40 km), all of them parts of the dominions of the Republic of Venice. Still today, approaching Cremona from each of these directions, the cityscape appears dominated by the Torrazzo, the medieval brickwork tower where Janello Torriani appears in 1529 for the first time mentioned in a document while he was taking care of the public clock, a tower that at that time was the oldest among the three tallest of the world, and the pride of the community (Figs 24-25). Just aside emerges the spire-crowned bulk of the Romanesque Cathedral. Upon entering the Cathedral of Cremona, despite the Romanesque and Gothic style of the structure, the observer’s attention is captured by the high quality cycle of frescos running all around the principal nave and painted between 1514 and 1521. This long sequence of religious scenes depicts the stories of the Virgin Mary and Christ, and it is famous among art historians for its encyclopedic range of Renaissance styles influencing the five great masters who were charged with this endeavor, drawing on local, Northern, Roman, Florentine, Venetian and Emilian elements. The frescoes painted on the last two spans on the southern side and on the counter-façade leave the quiet and equilibrate composition of the mature Renaissance style of the older part of the painted register for a grandiose and expressive representation of Jesus’ last hours. Livid stormy colors dominate the background and a crowding of 1 Giovanni Vigo, “Il volto economico della città,” in Storia di Cremona, ed.

These characteristics of Pordenone’s frescos, painted around 1520-1521, can be seen as exemplary visual articulations of their own time. The first decades of the sixteenth century in Lombardy2 were not just a time of cultural influences from the four cardinal points, but equally a time when real armed tides were smashing the country from all sides. The soldiers populating Pordenone’s frescos are dressed like the very French, Swiss, German, Venetian, North Italian, Papal, Tuscan, Neapolitan and Spanish contemporary soldiers that were constantly ravaging the country, dreadful, powerful and violent, bringing diseases to the body and, in the authorities’ eyes, even heretic poison to souls. Such was the image of war that faced the people of these districts, and this was the traumatic political context in which Janello Torriani came to life, grew up, got educated, learned a profession, got married and had his children. Local chronicles remind us that just before the beginning of the new century, alarming signs were observed in the sky preluding, for the astrologers, sorrowful times to come: a 60 years-long conflict, known later as the Italian Wars, was going to bring traumatic changes to the history of Italy.3 Torriani was born under Venetian dominion (1499- 1509). In 1509, as a consequence of the Cambrai League and the initial victory of the latter over the Serenissima, Cremona was returned to the duchy of Milan, now the possession of the Valois King of France Luis XII. A few years later, in 1512, the Swiss Confederation drove out the French from the State of Milan and put Massimiliano Sforza, first son of Ludovico il Moro, on the ducal throne. The Venetians, now allied with the French, managed to retake the city for a couple of months (1513), before the Swiss and Sforza were back again. The Battle of the Giants, at Marignano (1515), returned once more the reins of government of the duchy to another French monarch: Francis I, who kept it until 1522 when he was defeated at the Battle of Biccoca. Prospero Colonna, general captain of the Pontifical Army, seized the city in the name of the last Sforza, Francesco II, the younger son of Ludovico il Moro. Having lost the duchy, King Francis lost even his personal freedom at the 2 Lombardy should not be mistaken with the present administrative region, but it has to be understood as the historical area that roughly covers the whole of Northern Italy. 3 “Cronaca di Cremona dall’anno 1494 al 1525,” Bibliotheca historica Italica, 1876, 189-276.\n\n26\n\nfigure 2\n\nChapter 1\n\nGiovanni Antonio de Sacchis, called Pordenone, Golgotha, fresco, 1520-1521, Cathedral of Cremona.

But once again the fragile political balance was soon tipped, and in the same year Emperor Charles V fell into bad terms with his former ally Duke Francesco II, and Spanish soldiers together with the German imperial mercenaries took Cremona away from the Sforza. Only in the following year, after a siege, did the Sforza, now members of the League of Cognac, recapture the city and eventually, at the end of the decade, the Emperor even recognised him as the legitimate Duke of Milan bequeathing upon him as a\n\nJanello Torriani’s First Education\n\n27\n\nbride his niece Christina, Princess of Denmark. However, the star of the House of Sforza was destined to an irrevocable decline: the last Sforza died in 1535 without an heir. From this moment Emperor Charles V became de facto ruler of the duchy, conveying it later into the hands of his son Philip. Janello thus witnessed 11 changes of lordship in Cremona during his first 35 years of life, which he lived against the background of an almost constant state of war.4 These were not easy times. The numerous clashes between Italian, Swiss, Spanish, German and French armies were not restricted to the battlefield: the country was constantly ravaged, towns sacked, people abused, agriculture ruined and trade and production weakened. The numbers of these armies were increasing: combat was constantly breaking out and the evolution of artillery meant that a few minutes’ bombardment could cause casualties by the hundreds as the battles of Ravenna (1512), Novara (1513), Marignano (1515), Bicocca (1522) and Pavia (1525) had shown, signaling an increase in the massive use of efficient cannons and portable artillery. This was one of the reasons why the number of soldiers in the ranks of the armies was rising to unprecedented levels. This had a tremendous impact on the populations and regions that had to feed, shelter and host undisciplined hoards of professional assassins, together with their horses, trains of carriages, beasts and accompanying villains, adventurers, suppliers and prostitutes following behind them. Violence and plague were all too familiar to Janello’s countrymen, and personal security was more often than not a short-lived illusion. Since the time of Archimedes, it was well-known that war, while a deadly threat, was also an opportunity for the practitioners of practical mathematics to display their skills. Leonardo da Vinci, who had worked for about 20 years for the Sforza in Milan, fashioning himself as a new Archimedes able to invent new dreadful war-machines, decided to leave the duchy as soon as fortune turned her back to his Sforza lord Ludovico il Moro, and the French had taken over, showing a quite destructive attention towards his works, demolishing his equestrian clay model for a cyclopean bronze sculpture. Leonardo was leaving Lombardy when a new generation of local Renaissance mathematicians that would be indebted to his legacy -such as Girolamo Cardano, Niccoló Tartaglia 4 Antonio Campi, Cremona, fedelissima città et nobilissima colonia deRomani: rappresentata in disegno col suo contato, et illustrata d’una breve historia delle cose più notabili appartenenti ad essa, et dei ritratti naturali deduchi et duchesse di Milano, e compendio delle lor vite (Milano: Bidelli, 1645), 137-50; Letizia Arcangeli, “La città nelle guerre d’Italia (1494-1535),” in Storia di Cremona, ed.

Leonardo would come back to Milan in the following years before moving eventually to France and in Milan he would join a cultural milieu which remained a fertile land for practical mathematics. The Italian Wars had caused certain changes that were influential in Janello’s formation. The constant warfare provoked the reduction and for long periods the shutting of many universities such as the Studium of Pavia, where one Giorgio Fondulo of Cremona, a physician, had been studying and later teaching. According to Antonio Campi’s account of Janello’s youth, contained in his Cremona fedelissima (1585), Fondulo was charmed by the brilliant intellect of Janello Torriani when the latter was still a child, and he taught him what he knew in the field of mathematics, with special regard to astrology.5 We do not know whether Giorgio Fondulo returned to his native Cremona to practice his medical profession of his own accord or because war pushed him to do so during the long-periods of extraordinary closure and reduced activities of the University of Pavia. What we do know is that Fondulo provided youngsters with special tutorials in Cremona. Besides Giorgio Fondulo, the military operations had brought to Cremona people of different origins, with their tech­· nological culture and their networks. In Cremona Janello could witness the revolution of the fortification-system of his town (especially in the years 15161526) that transformed the huge castle and the proud medieval tall city-walls coroneted by castellated battlements into a modern system of low ramparts protected by a wide fosse and bastions. Practitioners of applied mathematics were employed in the defensive tasks, from the casting of cannons to the construction of long bridges over the river, to the strengthening of fortifications, and sometimes their capabilities provoked common admiration, as was re­· corded during the siege of 1526 when Spanish engineers led the general applause.6 A young man like Janello, with his interest in mechanics, had certainly plenty of opportunities to observe, and perhaps even cooperate with, military engineers. After all, the first records about his employment in Milan in the central administration of the duchy, as we shall see, describe him as an engineer. It is possible to imagine that, in the year 1526, right after Spanish and German troops left the city, when Duke Francesco II Sforza had to reside in Cremona for several months, Milan being still in the hands of the enemy, Janello Torriani took the chance to make himself known by the political and 5 Campi, Cremona fedelissima città, 137-50. 6 “Cronaca di Cremona dall’anno 1494 1525”; Bonetti, “L’assedio di Cremona (Agosto-Settembre 1526).”.\n\n30\n\nChapter 1\n\nmilitary hierarchies of the duchy, something that may have had important consequences in the development of his future career. However, the suffering and constant danger provoked by war must had a unforgettable impact on Janello, though not as evident as in the case of the unfortunate Niccolò Tartaglia, another paramount protagonist of the devel­ opment of Renaissance mathematics (Fig. 3). The latter was born in the neighboring town of Brescia, and he is in many senses an exemplary victim of these ruthless conflicts. Since Brescia, like Cremona, was a possession of the Venetian Republic, after the attack of the Cambrai Legue, it fell into French hands. However, in 1512, the population of Brescia participated in a riot and managed to take control of the city for two weeks until fresh French troops arrived to reinforce the expelled ones, crushing the rebels without mercy. Brescia was sacked and its population was brutally slaughtered, violated and robbed. Tartaglia was a 12 year-old boy at the time. He would later describe how he escaped together with his mother and his sister into the Cathedral when enemy troops broke into the city-walls, believing this holy building to be a safe shelter for them. It was not: a French soldier struck the young boy’s head with a sword at least fives times in front of his mother. One of these violent blows penetrated Niccolò’s jaw and palate, breaking through his teeth. He survived only because, covered by the blood and by the arms of his mother, and after so many blows in the head, he was believed to be dead. Niccolò could neither talk nor eat for a long time, and after his recovery, he would suffer a lifetime’s speech impediment. He became a stutterer, and for this reason he was given the nickname “Tartaglia”, meaning in Italian exactly this disability.7 Niccolò chose to keep this name even when he became a renowned mathematician, in order to remember this traumatic event. In the neighboring city of Cremona the situation was slightly better but still fraught with danger. In the same year of the sacking of Brescia, Cremona avoided by the skin of its teeth the same destiny that Ravenna, Novara, Prato, Pavia, Pordenone, Treviso, Rome itself, and many other villages and cities had suffered during the Italian Wars. The community managed to escape being sacked by paying a huge ransom, and providing food and lodging for the Swiss forces of the Holy League. Similar situations occurred in 1521 and 1526, when the city came really close to being stormed by enemy armies. Even if Torriani’s 7 Niccolò Tartaglia, Quesiti et inuentioni diuerse de Nicolo Tartaglia: di nouo restampati con una gionta al sesto libro, nella quale si mostra duoi modi di redur una città inespugnabile.

On two occasions Cremona had been captured by the Swiss and Sforza side (1512) and by the Holy League and the Sforza (1522). On both occasions, for more than a year, French troops continued to hold the castle of S. Croce, within the very city. The effects of the French artillery’s bombardment are still visible today on the northern walls of the Cathedral and on the Torrazzo. Besides the blasts falling on the city from the castle, and the desperate forays by the hungry troops inside to pillage anything edible, Cremona had to pay for half of the costs of maintenance of the troops constantly sieging the castle in order to prevent these very attacks. Moreover, waves of dreadful diseases cyclically hit the town: since 1495 syphilis, known as the French disease, appeared in Cremona frequently, killing many and horribly disfiguring the unfortunate survivors. Since the same time contagions of petechial fever and plague killed large numbers of people in 1503, 1504, 1505, 1511, 1512, 1513 and 1524. In the year 1523 the local administration considered it to be necessary to build a Lazzareto (a hospital for infective disease) outside the city-walls to host the numerous victims of the plague. The incessant work of destruction of the\n\n32\n\nChapter 1\n\narmies in the countryside, together with unfortunate climatic conjunctions, brought terrible famines that raged in Cremona, especially in the years 1501, 1505, and 1518. During the famine of 1501 artisans armed themselves and tried to sack the deposits of food in the palaces of the gentry, but they were captured and hanged. In 1505 some people even died of hunger, and in the winter of 1511, because of the great cold, the river froze, blocking the mills and leaving the city without bread for several days. Occupying armies had to be fed by the locals− whom they treated with disdain−, and it happened that even noble citizens were killed. It was not rare to see wealthy members of the local gentry kidnapped on the specious accusation of high treason and tortured in order to extort their golden ducats, and during the siege of 1526 the local nobility was even obliged to work manually together with people from the lower classes in the reinforcement of the town’s defenses. When the foreign troops were not responsible for atrocities, it was the bitter grudge of the local factions that precipitated despair: Guelphs and Ghibellines, allied with one or the other Transalpine power, were as ruthless as devils in oppressing the peasants and in taking the most cruel vendettas on each other. Janello had to witness murders and terrible executions during his youth, as when in 1521 the French authorities slowly burned alive two Ghibellines and quartered another two, after having tormented them with red-hot pincers. No surprise that the populace, exhausted by the unbearable situation, began to run after Franciscan preachers calling for peace as if they were the messiah himself, or to denounce several apparitions of the Virgin Mary, On two occasions, even the Church itself urged caution because these apparitions were to be read as misinterpretations of signs produced by Nature itself and not by God.8 Looking closer to Janello we know that even his father, one Gherardo, suffered economic consequences from this condition of constant warfare: having rented a mill from the “lord” Cornelio Meli, “magnificent knight” of Cremona (magnificus eques dominus), Gherardo was sued by Meli for failing to pay his rent. At law court Janello’s father advanced the reasonable excuse that he could not use the mill for the reason that the canal in which it was situated had run dry because of the war between French and Imperial forces. Despite this, he was ordered to pay the rent!9 Even if it was the entire population that suffered the effects of this neverending war, a commoner like Janello’s father still had to endure the unjust 8 “Cronaca di Cremona dall’anno 1494 al 1525.” 9 Rita Barbisotti, “Janello ‘Torresani’, alcuni documenti cremonesi e il ‘baptismum’ del Battistero,” Bollettino Storico Cremonese, Nuova Serie, 7 (2001): 255-68.\n\nJanello Torriani’s First Education\n\nFigure 5\n\n33\n\nGiovanni Antonio de Sacchis, called Pordenone, Pilate judging Christ, fresco, 1520, Cathedral of Cremona.
