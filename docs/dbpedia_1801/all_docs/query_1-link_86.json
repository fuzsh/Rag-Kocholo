Eating disorder-related health visits — which include hospital stays, #pediatrician visits, #telehealth #psychotherapy, and everything in between — more than doubled among people younger than 17 in the past five years. From 2018 through mid-2022, visits among this age group jumped 107.4% across all eating disorders, from around 50,000 visits at the beginning of 2018 to more than 100,000 in 2022. Read more! Act NOW, children and teens need us! https://lnkd.in/e2rcpSDS\n\nDementia is not a single illness but a group of symptoms caused by disorders affecting the brain. It's not just about losing memories – it can affect the way people think, feel, and behave. As a psychiatrist, I see firsthand the impact dementia has on individuals and their families. It's crucial to understand that dementia goes beyond forgetfulness; it can lead to changes in personality, impaired reasoning, and even difficulty with daily tasks. Awareness is key to support and early diagnosis. Research shows that early intervention can significantly improve quality of life. Let's dispel myths and understand that dementia is a medical condition, not a normal part of aging. #drsheroze #geriatricpsychiatry #geriatrics #dementia #oldage #disorientation #amnesia #personality #aggression #delusion\n\nI am excited to share that I will be speaking at the “Applied Integrative Strategies for Pediatric Anxiety” on Jan 11-13th, 2024.

These symptoms can be associated with an autoimmune disorder called PANDAS. These symptoms can appear seemingly overnight with a dramatic onset. Symptoms may include anxiety, motor and vocal tics, obsessions, compulsions, and a variety of other issues including somatic symptoms like abrupt onset of bedwetting or severe and disruptive restless sleep. When something like this happens to your child, it's frightening. It's normal to have many questions as a concerned parent. What Causes PANDAS? How Do I Know If My Child Has PANDAS? How Is PANDAS Treated?
