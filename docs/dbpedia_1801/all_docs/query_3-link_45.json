        "text": "Spain. He was especially famous for his amazing planetary clocks, which he both designed and physically crafted (thanks to the invention of the first known machine-tool to cut gears), and for his hydraulic device of Toledo, the first giant machine in history that elevated water over a slope of ninety metres a distance of three hundred meters. Given this multifaceted professional profile, Torriani has been considered a Renaissance polymath and a genius. This article goes beyond the anachronistic understanding of these two categories, which it deconstructs, by analyzing Torriani's education and the context of the mathematical professions during the sixteenth century. Janello Torriani, aussi connu sous le nom espagnol de Juanelo Turriano (Crémone c. 1500-Tolède 1585) fut d'abord au service de l'empereur Charles Quint comme forgeron, serrurier, facteur d'ins-truments scientifiques, inventeur célèbre pour ses dispositifs mécaniques, constructeur d'automates et horloger ; au service du roi Philippe II d'Espagne, il fut ingénieur hydraulique, mathématicien, astronome, concepteur de cloches, arpenteur géomètre et auteur de traités de mathématiques. Il est surtout connu pour ses étonnantes horloges astronomiques qu'il a à la fois conçues et construites (grâce à l'invention des premières machines à couper les engrenages), et pour ses dispositifs hydrau-liques de Tolède, dont la toute première machine permettant d'amener de l'eau vers le haut d'une pente sur une distance de 300 mètres. Pour ses multiples compétences professionnelles, Torriani est considéré comme un véritable polymathe et un génie de la Renaissance. Cet article cherche à dépasser une compréhension anachronique de ces deux catégories, qu'il pour déconstruit, en analysant la formation de Torriani et le contexte de la profession de mathématicien au XVI e siècle.\n\nGiuseppe Torti (active between 1752 and 1770) is one of many Italian 18th century artists who went abroad to seek their professional fortune. Together with his wife, a singer, he travelled a long way from Milan via Vicenza, Graz and Vienna to the other end of Europe – Lithuania. For a few years (1756-59), he was active in Lithuania at the court of Hieronim Florian Radziwiłł in Biała Podlaska and Słuck as an operatic and chamber music composer. In 1760, he returned to Milan together with his family and probably never left Italy any more. For Hieronim Florian Radziwiłł he composed at least one opera, in 1756, to the libretto of Agostino Piovene based on Michel Ducas’ Historia byzantina (1629) – Tamerlain’s Story (the music has not survived). In 1763, in Palermo, the Real Palazzo staged “azione drammatica” Tancredi in Tessalonica to the libretto by Giovanni Baldanza and music by D. Giuseppe Torti (only the libretto has survived) to mark the birthday of King of Sicily Ferdynand Borbone. Giuseppe Torti is the author of works which we have only a fragmentary knowledge of today. His works have been preserved in the archives of Austria, Germany, Italy and Sweden and include a tenor aria Attenda il core dal caro bene (1755), religious cantata: Armata sum in campo, Concerto in G major for three flutes and b.c., Trio sonata in G for two flutes and b.c. as well as another version of that work: Trio in G major for two violins and basso, or Concerto for oboe from about 1770. Giuseppe Torti’s artistic outcome was undoubtedly much more extensive, but the fact that he is at all known and talked about today is more due to his patron, H. F. Radziwiłł, than the musician himself, as he was one of a thousand of Italian artists scattered all over Europe and one of those who helped bring the tradition of Italian baroque also to Lithuania.\n\nThis article aims to analyze the reports written by Italian workers during their visits to the World Expositions of the Nineteenth century. The stories of the workers express at the same time the astonishment and the enthusiasm face to face with the latest \"wonders\" of progress. The relationship with technology and with the machines is one of the most recurrent topics in the accounts of workers. The new machines and new technologies are described with metaphors that range from the mysterious to the fantastic, as “fairies” or as “monstrous devices”. On the one hand, technology has a spectacular value in itself and it summarises the essential values - of the idea of progress. It is the pivotal subject of the message conveyed by the exhibitions, and the workers are very interested to this subject. In their writings, they express, in an naive and innocent way, their amazement at the phantasmagoric demiurgic strength of technology, especially when it appears as a direct expression of science. Electrical energy may be considered as an emblematic case in this regard, as it only becomes visible through technological applications. Through the spectacular play of lights arranged for the Exhibition, electricity comes to represent the triumph of science and takes on a metaphorical value. Indeed, it personifiees the deepest values and the most typical ideas of progress itself. On the other hand, the Exhibition is the place where workers’ professional profile is greatly undermined. The reactions, as we have seen, are numerous and varied, but rarely take the form of an uncritical acceptance or a radical opposition. By far the most common reaction is a cautious and critical approval, accepting the dominant message of positivity and strength of the technology and the inevitability of scientific and technical progress, but at the same time strongly suggesting the theme of the preservation and protection of workers’ prerogatives.\n\nThe essay explores the relationship between architectural theory, architectural history and architectural design, focusing on the relationship between Manfredo Tafuri’s work on the “historical project” and Aldo Rossi’s projects and his writings on the critical nature of architectural design. The essay highlights the difficulties of writing a “history of the present’”, showing that the task of the architectural historian is even more difficult when the subject of its history is the design process, and an architecture still in the making which claims autonomy and criticality in itself. The polemical dialogue between Tafuri and Rossi in the 1970s embodied different and complementary voices of criticism in architecture. On one hand, Tafuri claimed that the critic could only be a historian, i.e. know the history and the context of the discipline, in order to formulate his critique. On the other hand, Rossi promoted a form of architectural design - typological, rational, but also highly personal and evocative – that always enacted a form of self-criticism, through drawings, buildings and words. Tafuri’s writings continue to instigate a dialogue between architectural theory and practice, developing a redefinition of architectural history as a critical “project” – thus appropriating the active and propositional role traditionally assigned to architectural design."
