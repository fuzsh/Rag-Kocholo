        "text": "Early and Recent History and Genealogical Records\n\nof Many of the Representative Citizens\n\nWALTER BENNETT ROBBERSON. As a man of twentieth century industry, Walter Bennett Robberson, vice-president of the Springfield Grocery Company, is well worthy of representation in a work of the nature of the one in hand, as a representative of that class of alert, far-seeing men of affairs who are giving an enduring character to the industrial and civic make up of the Queen City of the Ozarks and vicinity. He has shown both the power of initiative and that of concentration, and has made for himself a secure place as one of the leaders of his day and generation in Greene county.\n\nMr. Robberson, who is a scion of one of the prominent and honored old families of this locality, was born in Rolla, Phelps county, Missouri, February 11, 1864. He is a son of Dr. Edwin T. and Elizabeth Jane (Sproul) Robberson, a complete sketch of whom appears on other pages of this volume, hence the chronicle of their interesting lives will not be repeated here. Suffice it to say however, that for many years Dr. Robberson was one of the leading physicians and business men of this section of the state, and did as much as any other one man for the material development of Springfield a generation ago.\n\nWalter B. Robberson was but a child when his parents removed to Springfield and here he grew to manhood. He had excellent educational advantages. After passing through the public and high schools he took the regular course in Drury College, making an excellent record, and was graduated from that institution with the class of 1885, receiving the degree of Bachelor of Arts. Soon thereafter he entered upon his business career, obtaining a position as receiving clerk in the Springfield Grocery Company. He was ambitious and soon proved to be a faithful, painstaking and trustworthy employee and his promotion was rapid. He has remained with this large and widely known concern to the present time and has done much to increase its present great volume of business and its prestige. He has long been a stockholder in the same. He was manager for a period of six years, and is now vice-president of the company. A wholesale business is carried on exclusively and no grocery house in the great Southwest is better or more favorably known. Prompt and honest service is the motto of the firm, and in view of the fact that many of its thousands of customers have remained with it for a quarter of a century or more would indicate that this high code of modern business ethics had been strictly adhered to. The firm's modern, mammoth and substantial place of business is conveniently located in the heart of the wholesale district of Springfield, with excellent railroad facilities, and a large and carefully selected stock is carried at all seasons, everything being handled that is found in an up-to-date grocery store, in the way of staple and fancy groceries.\n\nMr. Robberson was married on November 3, 1887 to Emma Hardin, who was born in Illinois in i863. She received a good education, is a lady of culture and refinement, and is an active worker in the local clubs and especially in the work of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.\n\nThree children have blessed the home of Mr. and Mrs. Robberson, namely: Edwin T., born June 1, 1889, died September 24, 1894; Susie Belle, born December 15, 1891 is studying for a trained nurse in the Burge Deaconess hospital, Springfield; Edwina, born September 29, 1894, is attending Kindergarten Training School in Chicago. They are both young ladies of much promise.\n\nMr. Robberson has long been an active and influential worker in Democratic politics, but has never sought or held public office. Fraternally, he belongs to the Masonic order, including Gate of the Temple Lodge No. 422, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons; Vincil Chapter No. 110, Royal Arch Masons; Zabud Council, Royal and Select Masters; St. John's Commandery No. 20, Knights Templar; and Abou Ben Adhem Temple, Ancient Arabic Order of Nobles of the Mystic Shrine. He is also a member of Florence Lodge No. 409, Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks and Red Men. He and his wife belong to the First Congregational church.\n\nPersonally Mr. Robberson is a plain, unassuming gentleman, uniformly courteous and pleasant, and is one of Springfield's most representative men of affairs.\n\n[713-714]\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | Y"
