        "text": "September – The North American Review published the final segment of Sam’s essay, “In Defense of Harriet Shelley” (July–Sept.).\n\nSometime during the month in Etretat, France, Sam wrote to Joseph E. Hinds and/or Samuel Sothey Hinds (1875-1948), probably brothers, born in Brooklyn. Joseph was vice president of U.S. Printing Co. in Brooklyn. Samuel became a millionaire lawyer who went broke in the Wall Street crash of 1929, then turned to playing bit parts in movies, and ultimately acted in 214 films, including It’s a Wonderful Life. In films he played the distinguished man of wealth he’d been before the crash. Evidently, one or both of the brothers had solicited a word of wisdom from Sam:\n\nFriend Hinds —\n\nIf I may, I will suggest this sentiment from the philosophy of Pudd’nhead Wilson:\n\nLet us endeavor to so live, that when we come to die even the undertaker will be sorry [MTP; MTPO]."
