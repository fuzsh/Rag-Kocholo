        "text": "Elder was very fortunate in his mining ventures. Early in the sixties he had large interests in the Moonta and Wallaroo copper-mines which brought him in a huge fortune. He entered political life as a member of the South Australian Legislative Council in 1863 but retired in 1869. He was again elected in 1871, but resigned in 1878 and took no further part in politics.[1][4]\n\nHe attended the Paris Exhibition of 1878 as honorary commissioner for South Australia, and during this time he received his knighthood ( ).[17]\n\nElder was much interested in horses and made the breeding of blood stock a hobby at his stud in Morphettville.[17] He was a leading racing man between 1875 and 1884 and had the highest reputation. It was well known that any horse bearing his colours was in the race to win. He sold his race-horses in 1884 but continued his stud.\n\nHe was an enthusiastic yachtsman and for many years commodore of the Glenelg Sailing Club.[17]\n\nElder also had interests in the wine industry and was quite successful in exhibitions in Adelaide and London.[18] He was also a founder of the Tintara Vineyard company in 1862.\n\nElder encouraged exploration, contributed largely to Warburton's 1873 expedition and Giles's in 1875, supplying camels in each case, which proved to be of the greatest value. He also contributed liberally to the cost of other explorations such as those by John Ross and the 1891 Elder Scientific Exploring Expedition led by David Lindsay,[19] and in no case sought or obtained any return for himself. On one occasion he offered £5,000 on condition that a like sum was subscribed by the public to finance an expedition to the Antarctic,[4] but the condition was not fulfilled.\n\nHe supported every kind of manly sport and his benefactions both private and public were widespread and almost without limit.\n\nThe Art Gallery of South Australia received a bequest of £25,000, and many of the finest pictures of the gallery were purchased from this fund. He contributed substantially to the Library's acquisition program. He himself published a small booklet in 1893: Notes from a Pocket Journal of a Trip up the River Murray in 1856, recounting a voyage in the steamer Gundagai.[4][20]\n\nThe University of Adelaide\n\nedit\n\nIn 1874 he gave £20,000 towards an endowment fund for the newly established University of Adelaide, and on his death in 1897 bequeathed a further £65,000 to the university, £20,000 of which was for a School of Music.[21] The Elder Conservatorium of Music perpetuates his name. Elder's combined gifts and bequests to the university amount to nearly £100,000.\n\nElder Professor of Mathematics\n\nedit\n\nOne of Elder's bequests established and funded the first professorships at the fledgling University; the Elder Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy; and the Elder Professor of Natural Sciences. The first incumbent, Sir Horace Lamb, an applied mathematician, lectured in pure and applied mathematics as well as giving instruction in practical physics. After Lamb's resignation in 1885 to take up a post at Owens College, Manchester, separate Chairs in Mathematics and Physics were established. The Elder Chair of Mathematics at the University of Adelaide has been held by many eminent mathematicians, including Nobel Prize winner Sir William Henry Bragg.\n\n1. Sir Horace Lamb M.A. Sc.D. 1875–1885[22] (Elder Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy)\n\n2. Sir William Henry Bragg M.A. OM KBE PRS 1886–1908[23]\n\n3. Sir Robert William Chapman M.A. B.E.

KCB 1911–1948\n\n3. Sir Leonard George Holden Huxley M.A. D.Phil. KBE 1949–1959\n\n4. John Henry Carver M.Sc. Ph.D. Sc.D. 1961–1978[33][34]\n\n5. John Russell Prescott B.Sc.(Hons.) Ph.D. D.Phil. 1982–1990[35]\n\n6. Anthony William (Tony) Thomas B.Sc.(Hons.) Ph.D. D.Sc.1990- [36][37]\n\nElder Professor of Music\n\nedit\n\nAs well as later funding the Elder Conservatorium, Sir Thomas helped to establish the Elder Professorship of Music in 1883, with the first incumbent taking up the post in 1884. At the same time, Sir Thomas established endowment funds in parallel for the Royal College of Music in London and the Music Board of the University of Adelaide to support the Elder Overseas Scholarship (in Music).\n\nAll of the Elder Professors of Music have also served as Director/Dean of the Elder Conservatorium, providing artistic and academic leadership both in the Conservatorium and in the Faculties/Schools of Music/Performing Arts of which it has been part.\n\n1. Joshua Ives Mus.Bac.(Cantab.) 1884–1901[38]\n\n2. J. Matthew Ennis D.Mus.(Adel.) 1902–1918\n\n3. E. Harold Davies Mus.Bac. D.Mus.(Adel.)1918–1948[39]\n\n4.

It became the Elder Professor of Anatomy and Histology on the appointment of Professor Herbert Woollard in 1928.\n\nArchibald Watson M.D. F.R.C.S. 1885–1919[42]\n\nFrederic Wood Jones B.Sc. M.B.B.S.

M.D. D.Sc. 1945-1970[44]\n\nJanis Priedkalns B.V.Sc. M.A. Ph.D. 1972–1996\n\nIn 1996 the Wood Jones Professor of Biological Anthropological and Comparative Anatomy, named for the second Elder Professor of Anatomy, was established from an endowment by Professor Ray Last (1903–1993), who studied under Wood Jones in the 1920s before embarking on a successful career as a surgeon and teacher in Australia and the United Kingdom. The foundation Wood Jones Chair (1996-) is Professor Maciej Henneberg Ph.D. D.Sc.\n\nOther chairs\n\nedit\n\nRalph Tate, Elder Professor of Natural Sciences 1875–1901[45]\n\nEdward Rennie M.A. D.Sc., Elder Professor of Chemistry 1886–1927\n\nOther philanthropy and bequests\n\nedit\n\nIn 1882, Elder donated the rotunda to Elder Park, which was renamed in his honour in 1907.[46]\n\nIn 1884, as president of the South Australian Zoological and Acclimatisation Society, Elder donated the Sir Thomas Elder Rotunda to the society's zoological garden, now the Adelaide Zoo.[47][48]\n\nOn his death in 1897, Elder left a bequest of £25,000[21] for the construction of affordable homes for 'industrious and deserving' workmen, which led to the foundation of the not-for-profit Adelaide Workers’ Homes Inc.[49] Of the original 48 homes built from 1899 on a site in the Adelaide city centre bounded by Wakefield, Angas and Elder Streets, 13 still remain.[50] Another set of semi-detached cottages in Arts and Crafts style were built in 1901–2, at 36-50A & 39-45A Rose Street, Mile End,[51] and are now state heritage-listed.\n\nDuring his lifetime and in his bequests, Elder contributed over £170,000 to the Adelaide Benevolent and Strangers’ Friend Society, the oldest secular philanthropic society in South Australia. In 1898 funds from the bequest were used to buy land and construct the society's office at 17 Morialta Street, Adelaide, which was named \"Elder Hall\" in his honour,[52][53][54] and is state heritage-listed.[55]"
