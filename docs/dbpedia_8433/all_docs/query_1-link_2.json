Dear Sir : — In accordance with the agreement by which the Department of Botanical Research of the Carnegie Institution of Washington is to aid in the investigations of the Cactaceae by yourself and Dr. J. N. Rose, 31 cases of living specimens were shipped to you from Tehuacan, Puebla, via Vera Cruz, on Sept. 13, 1906. Some of the specimens included are of massive size, and if induced to grow in New York will soon furnish material to illustrate their entire life-history. A set of photographs illus- trating the habits of many of the species is being sent you by mail. In connection with the activities of the Desert Laboratory an effort is being made to obtain a comprehensive idea of the vegeta- tion of the arid areas of the continent with especial regard to the composition of the flora, the factors affecting distribution, and the general physiological behavior of the more highly specialized forms. A study of several localities in southern Mexico with these ends in view was made in August and September, 1906, and I was so fortunate as to do this work in company with Dr. J. N. Rose, who is engaged in a taxonomic study of the flora of the regions in question. This arrangement greatly facilitated my own work, and by our joint efforts a large number of species were secured, some of which are as yet undescribed, and many have 1 Digitized by VjOOQ IC ^ 0. c \" V 2 i -5 c e( V B •5 C d c ^ o o ,*— V c .*o «t 1 ■g (^ c« •§ ^ 1 «o 3 JC o w *> «*. o ha JJ s. to o. ^ 'ct ^ 8f IP £: o TS im JU jd P^ ** 9) a> JQ 5 s o 13 in s: 1 4^ ^ u es CJ .. Digitized by VjOOQIC not previously been represented in horticultural or botanical col- lections. In our first trip afield we were guided by Dr. C. G. Pringle to a locality on the lava slopes of the Pedregal, a few miles south of Mexico City. The irregular surface of this volcanic forma- tion is pitted with cavities and caverns, some of which are large enough to enclose an ordinary dwelling house, and the variety of conditions of moisture and shade gives opportunity for a wide range of vegetation. So luxuriantly do the plants grow in these places that the openings of the caves, or pits, will be choked with their branches and foliage. This locality has been visited by Dr. Pringle many times and Fig. 2. Opuntia and Dr. C. G. Pringle. is a type locality for many species collected by him. We found several species of prickly pear, some of which have not yet been described, and it was also seen that species so closely related as not to be easily separable were in the closest proximity. Early in September we started to examine the desert valleys which lie along the main backbone of southern Mexico in the states of Puebla and Oaxaca at elevations of 1,200 to 6,000 feet. Tehuacan, situated in one of the northernmost of these arid val- leys, was chosen as a favorable place for centering our work and Digitized by VjOOQIC assembling living plants for shipment to New York, Tucson and Washington. Headquarters were made at the Hacienda El Riego, west of the city, near the foothills of the range bounding the valley on the west. We met Mr. W. L. Morkhill, general manager of the railway, the Ferrocarril Mexicano del Sur, in his office at Puebla, and in his car at Tehuacan, and plans were made by him by which laborers and materials were secured for us by Sr. Daniel Tellez, superintendent of the tram lines of the railway system. In addition Mr. Morkhill arranged with the general manager of the Interoceanic Railway that the car loaded with plants at Tehuacan should be sent through without change or delay to the wharf at Vera Cruz where the crates could be lightered out to the steamer. It is difficult to acknowledge properly the amount of material aid and kindly cooperation re- ceived from Mr. Morkhill in this enterprise. The town of Tehuacan lies in the middle of a valley running north and south on the eastern side of the main continental ridge, and this and the neighboring valleys and slopes are a part of one of the most striking deserts in the world, the xerophilous vegeta- tion offering features of adaptation and distribution not previously encountered elsewhere. The abundance of the Cactaceae rivals or surpasses even that of the southern part of Arizona and of Sonora, and, a half dozen of the species being massive forms, the landscape is highly characterized by them. Cercus Weberiy C: geometrizans^ Cephalocercus macrocephaliis, Piloccretis fidviceps, P. chrysocantha, P. tetetzo, Escontria chiotilla, together with four or five other undescribed forms reach a height and attain a bulk as great or greater than the saguaro. The amount of water stored by such plants on any given area is so great that planters have actually considered the feasibility of obtaining it in quanti- ties by crushing the plants with machinery. Nopals, tunas, and prickly pears in general are in abundance, and here as elsewhere in Mexico more than one variety practically free from spines have been under cultivation for some time. Of the half dozen species of Echiiiocactus one forms huge mounds of small individuals as much as three yards across, while E. grandis might as rightly be included among the trees as the saguaro ( Cereiis gigaNteus), GooQle Digitized by VjOOQ The fruits of a large number of species of Opuntia and of a few of Cereus, are used in quantities for food and may be found in great abundance in the local markets. A few of the prickly pears produce a fruit, which is shipped long distances, and even finds a way to New York markets. A liking for these fruits is Fu;. 3. Echinocactus grandisy and Dr. J. N. Rose, on Rancho San Diego east of Tehuaciio. an acquired taste ; probably a residence in Mexico would hasten the acquisition, the insipidity of these fruits forming a possibly welcome contrast to the fieriness of the *' chile \" and the corrosive effect of mescal. Many of these plants are grown around the primitive homes of the natives as apples, peaches or pears might Digitized by VjOOQIC 6 be around a farmhouse in the United States. In addition to yielding fruits the stems make admirable hedges or barriers, although when planting for this purpose alone some species of Cereus are generally used. The evaporation in the Tehuacan region must be much in excess of the precipitation, yet it was noticeable that the various species of Oputitia were to be seen growing on dirt roofs of adobe dwellings, on stone wills, and even in crevices of brick and stone high up on cathedrals and other tall buildings. The air tempera- tures are favorable to such exposure but the protective and regulatory devices of such plants must be of the highest kind. No desert has yet been visited by the writer in which the storage function is so highly developed and exhibited by so many genera of plants as in the arid region of Tehuacan. In addition to the cacti, euphorbias, agaves, and related forms, the tree morning glory {Ipomoea sp.) has a soft thick trunk into which a knife may be easily thrust to the hilt and is chiefly a storage organ. Three species of Beaucarnea^ relatives of the yucca, known locally as ** sotol \" have the bases of the trunks swollen to a thickness of seven or eight feet with a height not more than two or three times this measurement, by the formation of an immense mass of spongy tissue with great capacity for retaining water. Like many other plants showing similar adaptions these trees sit directly on the surface and may be easily pushed over, especially after dead. On the jungly slopes we encountered Rhiis potentillaefolia, and found its poisonous effect on the skin as virulent as that of any American species, and the results as severe and lasting. Here as elsewhere in Mexico it was found that the broad leaves of the agave are sliced and the dried plates used in covering the huts and enramadas of the peons and Indians. After a general preliminary reconnaisance around Tehuacan we proceeded southward by rail to Oaxaca de Juarez, where we were so fortunate as to encounter Prof. Conzatti, of the Escuela Normal, who has long been known as an ardent student of the flora of this region. From him we obtained much valuable infor- mation not only as to distribution and general features of the Digitized by VjOOQIC region, but also as to the uses of various vegetable products found in the local markets. Oaxaca lies on an elevated plain. The precipitation in the immediate neighborhood is rather high owing to the close prox- imity of the mountains which act as condensers, although at an elevation but little below, the vegetation becomes distinctly xerophytic. Here it was found that the Indians and travellers in general used a peculiar storm cloak, consisting of a mat made from the leaves of a palm with three rows of overlapping thatch- ing inserted on one side. A second pattern, not seen so often, was thatched more densely by leaving free ends of the fiber over Fig. 4. Group of natives in storm cloaks of thatched palm. the whole surface. With two of these carried in a roll by a cord across the shoulder the traveller was provided with clothing by day and bedding by night. Lying upon one of these waterproof cloaks with the second above him the Indian seems heedless of the fact that the legs from the knees downward were exposed to the night air. Following the line of least resistance it was found that the facilities for travel provided for going to the ancient ruins at Mitla 35 miles to the southeast would take us into a region densely populated with cacti and affording a view of the sur- Digitized by VjOOQIC 8 rounding desert. The journey was made by diligence, and the route lay through the village of Tule made famous by the giant ahuehuetl, or cypress (Taxodium mucronatutfi), which stands in the church yard. This tree by the claims of local patriotism is the greatest in the world, while for a long time it has been cited as the oldest living. Both these claims are incapable of actual proof, although the tree has much to justify an interest in it. It measures 1 54 feet and 2 inches six feet from the ground, but it may be really two or three individuals fused together as it divides into that Fig. 5. View of basal portion of giant cypress of Tule, Oaxaca. many main branches within fifty feet, as may be seen from the accompanying illustration. This tree has been an object of ob- servation for more than two centuries, and on one side is a tablet, partly covered by the growth of the outer layers of the trunk, signed by the great naturalist. Baron von Humboldt, and probably placed there by his direction a century ago. The road to Mitia runs down the drainage system of a tribu- tary of the Tehuantepec river, among fields of maize and agaves, Digitized by VjOOQIC 9 and is fringed much of the way with hedges of cacti especially in and near the villages. Among these were seen several species which seemed to lack descriptions among known records. The village of Mitla is situated in latitute 17° N., at an alti- tude of about 4,000 feet, conditions which cooperate to give the vegetation a pronounced desert character. The famous ruins near by testify to the former existence of a type of civilization with the indelible impress of the desert upon it : a civilization in which cooperation or communism was carried to the greatest Fig. 6. Roadside scene between Oaxaca and Mitla. Cereus eburnetis, Cereus sp., Agave and Beld of maize. extreme, as it must have been among the ancient pueblos of the deserts of the United States. In the light of the conclusions of the meteorologist we may assume that no matter how long ago these ruins were peopled, yet a climate similar to that of to-day must have been experienced by the builders of the ancient temple. Before leaving Mitla we were afforded the opportunity of in- specting a distillery for making mescal, the fiery whiskey derived from the juice of the agave. When the great rosettes of this Digitized by VjOOQIC 10 plant (several species are used) are mature they are uprooted and the blades are cut away near the base, leaving a core made up of leaf bases and the lower end of the undeveloped inflorescence axis. A rock-lined pit is filled with the cores and baked thor- oughly, and after cooling the juice is pressed out and collected in great vats of rawhide supported on a framework of mesquite branches. After a week of reeking fermentation in the open air distillation is accomplished by a crude but effective apparatus in which condensation is secured by the cooling effect of running water brought hither in earthen and wooden conduits. So far as experience and information may be relied upon the devotees of this beverage cherish the ambition to quaff\" it as fresh from the Fig. 7. Agave, **chular miel,'* from which a tlachiquero is taking the sap for pulque. A reservoir made of the raw skin of a pig is carried on the back. still as it is possible to get it, and before any of its stinging quali- ties have been lost. Several kinds or types of this fluid are made, of which one of the better quality is known as tequila. In addition to these various preparations the production of pulque seems to be one of the profitable industries in the agri- culture of Mexico. The agaves used for this purpose have the centers of the rosettes hollowed out when mature and the sap exudes by bleeding pressure into this cavity, from which it is Digitized by VjOOQIC 11 collected and taken away once or twice daily. This is deftly accomplished by the use of a long gourd in the hands of the tiachiquero, who thrusts one end of the gourd into the liquid and puts his lips to the other perforated end and sucks, with the result that the sap is drawn into the gourd and then emptied into the whole pigskin carried upon his back. Fermen- tation quickly ensues and the resulting pulque is used in enor- mous quantities. It has the appearance of skimmed milk diluted with water and is characterized by an ill-favored odor which clings long to the person imbibing. The water supply, even in the remoter parts of central and southern Mexico is not of the best quality, and the traveler is between the danger arising from drinking from contaminated streams, and the disagreeable neces- sity of using the illy flavored pulque with the general result that one is endured at times and the dangers of the other are incurred when the taste of the safer beverage palls. On the return to Tehuacan Dr. Rose and I left the train at Santa Catalina where we were met by a section crew with a push car and taken down to Tomellin, thus giving an opportunity for the examination of the vegetation at closer range than that afforded by a moving train. Many interesting and unrecogniza- ble plants had been seen on the journey southward and we ex- pected to secure some valuable material by the trip. In this we were not disappointed, and by the courtesy of Mr. Morkill who arranged the matter for us we experienced one of the most thril- ling rides in Mexico. The railway grade drops 2,346 feet in the descent from Sta. Catalina to Tomellin, a distance of 22 miles, running down a steeply walled Canada most of the way, crossing the stream by bridges at various angles and curves, through tunnels and around curves in a short radius made possible by the narrow gauge of the track. Our car was a wooden platform about eight or nine feet long and half as wide which rested by open, wooden U-bear- ings upon two pairs of car wheels. Our crew were evidently of the determination to show us that a Mexican could slide down hill as fast as an American. Standing erect the foreman used a handspike thrust through a hole in the platform against one Digitized by VjOOQIC 12 wheel as a brake, while we sat with feet dangling from the front edge of the platform, the middle being occupied by agaves, cacti and other plants collected, while the crew formed a fringe to the rear. Within a few hundred yards the car would gain a speed of over thirty miles an hour at which rate we would dash down to the apex of a curve around a cliff, which we would round with the wheels climbing the outer rail, the track visible only a few feet ahead, and a very sufficient drop below us. The slopes examined during our frequent stops were replete with interest. Crass ulaceae were abundant, the sago-palm, Dioon edule, was found in the ravines, a Beaucarnea was abundant on the northern slopes, while in one place we faced a great hillside thickly covered with tetetzo {PUocereus tetetso), the individuals of which were as large as the giant cactus of Arizona. Tomellin was reached in the evening, where we found shelter in the staff house of the railway by the courtesy of Mr. Morkill. Portions of two days were spent here in securing additional ma- terial and shipping all of our collection to Tehuacan. At this elevation we found the principle giant cactus to be Cereus Weberi, a huge form which divides a few feet from the ground into a cluster of thirty to fifty branches which may be eight or ten inches in diameter. This species, growing at an elevation of 1,200 feet in latitude 19° N., is perhaps the most tropical of the massive forms. Here was also to be found the much-branched slender Escontria chiotilla, also a tree. Arriving at Tehuacan on September 8 we began immediately to complete our observations and prepare living specimens for shipment. A gang of laborers, a team, and a carpenter were kept busy for a week measuring standing cacti, by which suit- able wooden jackets could be built, and packing all securely for the journey. The entire lot was assembled on a vacant piece of ground near the baths of El Riego and from there was taken to the freight station at Tehuacan on a tram car from which a transfer was made to a freight car. The latter was sealed and sent despatch to Vera Cruz. To this point Dr. Rose proceeded to attend to matters of clearance and shipment, and when the plants where safely aboard the S. S. Monterey they were accom- Digitized by VjOOQIC 13 panied to New York by Mr. Joseph Rose Jr., who had assisted in the preparations throughout. The shipments to the Desert Laboratory came through safely and are already in use in our experimental observations. The regions visited by Dr. Rose and myself during the trip were easy of access and many of the localities had been previously seen by Dr. Pringle, Dr.^ Rose, Prof Trelease or other botanists. We had almost constantly in view, however, mountain ranges and valleys from which no specimens have ever been obtained and in which no examination has been made of the flora. In fact, this applies to the greater part of southern Mexico not directly ac- cessible from the railways and stage lines. It would be safe to say that not more than one-tenth of the main topographical regions of southern Mexico have been explored by the botanist. Some of this territory might be reached from haciendas, but the greater part may be investigated thoroughly and profitably only by means of a small independent expedition carrying its own outfit and supplies, as most of the country has nothing beyond the resources of scattered Indian villages in which the traveller is apt to meet with little beyond \"no hay\" and the tardy service of a people living in the very home and seat of the spirit of \" manana.\" Respectfully, , D. T. MacDougal. THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE YOUNG PAULOWNIA. The tree from which the accompanying illustration was made was purchased early in May, 1905, and placed in its present posi- tion near the drinking fountain but a short distance southeast of the Museum. It was a rather sorry looking object upon its arrival, and at that time did not appear to have before it a long and prosperous career, but appearances are often deceptive, as the sequel here will show. The tree was planted and the first year made two new shoots from the roots, one of which was re- moved. The wonderful growth of this one shoot during the Digitized by VjOOQIC 14 past summer shows clearly that it is not always safe to venture an opinion as to what a young tree may do, even though it Fig. 8. A young Paulo wnia tree ( Paulownio ionientosa), appear a weakling, for it may have wonderful recuperative powers. The shoot, when spring opened up last year, measured Digitized by VjOOQIC 15 two feet SIX inches in height, and at the end of the growing season the stem had attained a stature of sixteen feet six inches, a gain of fourteen feet in one season's growth. As indicated in the illustration, its leaves are large and showy, giving quite a tropical aspect to the plant, which has attracted considerable attention from visitors to the Garden. This tree is known to botanists as Patdownia tomentosa^ or sometimes as Paulownia imperialism Its rapid growth and magnificent foliage when young are not the only attractive features of this species. As it matures it spreads out into a shapely tree with widely spreading branches, bearing leaves much resembling those of the catalpa or Indian bean. During the late summer and fall the flower clusters are formed. Their growth does not proceed beyond the bud stage, however, and they remain in this condition during the winter, the tree at that time presenting an odd appearance with its two kinds of inflorescences, those bearing the brown woolly flower buds, and those with the much larger capsules which are pointed and black and remain attached to the tree for a long time. About April or May the flower buds expand, before the leaves are fully out, and a full-grown tree at such times is a delight to the eye, with its rich mantle of scented flowers borne in great profusion in large clusters. The flowers are purple and resemble those of the common foxglove in color and form. A fine speci- men of this tree is located near the Lorillard mansion in Bronx Park. It is many years old and perhaps has not many more to live, but it is still vigorous enough to put forth a wealth of flowers nearly every year. This tree is a native of Japan, where it is known as Kiri or To. It attains there a height of thirty to forty feet and a trunk diameter of two to three feet. It is found most commonly in the southern parts. of the country, thriving in the valleys, especially in those exposed to the hot sun. It was originally described by Thunberg as a Bignonia, under the name of Bignonia iontentosa^ and it was not until some years later that Siebold and Zuccarini recognized it as the type of an undescribed genus, to which they gave the name of Paulownia, in honor of Anna Digitized by VjOOQIC 16 Paulowna, a hereditary princess of the Netherlands. It was introduced into cultivation in Europe by Siebold, and seems to have flowered in England for the first time out of doors about 1852. It is a member of the figwort family, to which belong also the foxglove, the mulleins, the speedwells or veronicas, the beard-tongues or pentstemons, and many others of our well- known plants.

Kern, both of Purdue University, Lafayette, Indiana, are continuing their researches on plant rusts in the Garden herbarium during the month of January, and completing their monograph of these minute destructive fungi for publication in '* North American Flora,'* part of it being already in press. The Botanical Society of America met at the Garden on De- cember 29. The programme, including the address of the retiring president, was completed by 1.30 P. M. Over a hundred persons remained to luncheon. The lichen collection of Dr. H. E. Hasse, of California, con- sisting of about 3,000 species and many duplicates, has been recently presented to the Garden by Mr. John I. Kane. Most of the specimens are from America, many of them having been collected by Dr. Hasse in California, while a goodly number of European specimens are scattered through the collection. Mr. Guy West Wilson, one of the student guides at the Garden, presented an interesting paper on the ** Downy Mil- dews ** at the meeting of the botanical convention, December 5. The members of this class are filamentose alga-like fungi which are either aquatic or aerial. The aquatic forms, of which Sapro- legnia is an example, are parasitic on fishes and other animals. The aerial members of the class are parasitic upon green plants. Digitized by VjOOQIC 17 These are divided into two families upon the basis of habit of growth and method of germination. The first, Albuginaceae, contains a single genus, Albugo, the species of which are known as white rusts. This genus numbers about fifteen species, seven of which are North American. Of the latter all but one are of economic importance. The second family, Peronosporaceae, known as the downy mildews, contains seven genera with about one hundred and ten species, sixty of which are North American and many of which are of economic importance. Miss Gertrude S. Burlingham has been conducting some experiments at the Garden to determine the effect of magnesium salts upon plant growth. Magnesium salts in the absence of calcium salts are generally considered to be toxic to plants. Dr. Loew makes the statement that ** Plants succumb soon when placed in diluted solutions of magnesium salts and no other. In fact magnesium salts can exercise their nutritive functions only in the presence of a sufficient amount of calcium salts.\" With the view that the inhibitory effects noted by Loew might have been due to the use of excessive amounts of magnesium, experi- ments were undertaken to determine the effects of magnesium sulphate in dilute solutions, using the water culture method. Seedlings of abutilon, pea and corn about 3 cm. long were used. They were suspended over the mouth of beakers either through holes in paraffined cork, or from glass rods. Growth was measured for the first 168 hours. The magnesium sulphate solutions were made up with distilled water and chemically tested Kahlbaum salts. In each series seedlings were grown in distilled water as a control. From the results obtained these conclusions are drawn : that as with calcium, so with magne- sium, there is a dilution in which the toxic action is lost and stimulation begins, this dilution varying with the type of seed- ling; that from this point there is a gradual increase in stimula- tion with each successive dilution until a maximum is reached beyond which the growth decreases to the control ; and that the vitality of seedlings grown in proper dilutions of magnesium sul- phate is greater than in seedlings grown in distilled water. Two notable contributions to fossil botany by Dr. Arthur Digitized by VjOOQIC 18 Hollick have been issued during the past month by the United States Geological Survey and by the Maryland Geological Survey. The first * represents the results of about fifteen years of field work and critical examination of material collected by the author and others on Staten Island, Long Island, Block Island, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, the Elizabeth Islands and Cape Cod. A large part of this material, including many of the type specimens, is the property of the Garden, and the remainder belongs to either the Staten Island Association of Arts and Sciences, the Long Island Historical Society or the United States National Museum. The work was undertaken at the suggestion of the United States Geological Survey in order to solve, if possible, several perplex- ing problems in the geology of the region by means of the evi- dence afforded by fossil plants, and the results attained in this connection are condensed on p. 29 in a correlation table of the insular and allied formations. The total number of species described is 222, including 31 which are new to science. The ferns and fern-allies number 6, the conifers 27 and the angio- sperms 189. In the second of these contributions, t E)r- Hollick has written the part on fossil plants, in which some 40 species are described and figured, including 11 new to science. Under agreement with the Maryland Geological Survey a free set of the specimens upon which this part of the work was based will become the property of the Garden. It is by far the most exten- sive contribution to the palaeobotany of the Pleistocene forma- tions which has been published in America and the material represents a collection which is not duplicated elsewhere in this country. The total precipitation at the Garden during the month of De- cember, 1906, was 2.36 inches.

Sir: In a former report on an expedition to Southern Florida,* I called attention to the fact that it had been our good fortune to explore some of the islands lying in the everglades southwest of Miami while they were yet uninhabited. During our recent expedition to the same region, the value of our earlier explora- tions was emphasized by what we saw of the destruction caused by the hurricane that had recently swept south Florida. Had we not acquired a fundamental knowledge of the native vegetation of that unique and fascinating region as early as we did, our knowledge of the relation of the flora of south Florida to that of tropical America would have remained very imperfect. With your permission I left New York on the twenty-second of last October, and proceeded direct to Miami, Florida. I was joined on the way by Mr. J. J. Carter, of Pleasant Grove, Penn- sylvania, who continued my tireless associate throughout the ex- pedition. Upon the invitation of Dr. Ernst A. Bessey, who is in chaise of the Subtropical Laboratory of the United States De- partment of Agriculture, we established our headquarters in the laboratory building of that institution, and to Dr. Bessey and his associates, Mr. Fawcett and Mr. Wester, we tender thanks for their constant cooperation and association. We were also accompa- nied during most of the field work by Dr. H. C. Cowles, of the •Jour. N. Y. Bot Card. 5 : 49. 1904. 23 Digitized by VjOOQIC 24 University of Chicago, who, together with Mrs. Cowles, is study- ing certain features of the Florida flora. The object of our field work was mainly two-fold ; first, we had planned a survey of Long Key and several adjacent everglade islands which, taken together, form the southwestern extremity of the chain which appears north of the Miami River ; second, we had arranged to continue the survey of the Florida Keys, in order to secure and to preserve the knowledge of the native flora of that singular chain of islands before it becomes further obscured or wholly destroyed by the advance of civilization. The high water in the everglades prevented us from getting more than a distant view of Long Key, consequently we continued explora- tion on the larger group of islands lying between Miami and Camps Longview and Jackson, and through the courtesy of Mr. Johnson, of the Florida East Coast Railway engineer corps, we were enabled to penetrate a wholly unexplored section of the everglades lying between the present terminus of the railway and ^ Key Largo, including a portion of Cross Key. Our interesting experience on the latter island indicated further important dis- coveries when its flora shall be more thoroughly explored. This island, together with a parallel and almost similar formation, consti- tutes the only natural and approximately complete land-connec- tion between the Florida Keys and the mainland of the peninsula. As we reached the field about a week after the occurrence of the hurricane already referred to, we had an opportunity to observe its effects on the vegetation. The everglades were exceptionally full of water, a condition caused not only by the heavy rains of the recent storm, but also by those of a very wet season preceding it. On the islands of coral sand-rock, the pinclands were uninjured ex- cept for the relatively insignificant loss of myriads of pine trees which were blown over by the wind, the number being especially large because of the fact that the trees growing directly on the exposed rock cannot make tap-roots. The islands ranging from the vicinity of Homestead Station southward had been completely submerged during the latter stage of the hurricane ; the water lying to the northwest being pushed out of the everglades by the extremely high winds, swept over the islands, and poured Digitized by VjOOQIC 25 into the everglades to the southeast. The hammocks were greatly injured, the very small ones isolated in the higher por- tions of the pinelands being especially damaged. With only the slight external protection of the slender pine trees to break the force of the wind, their vegetation was practically mowed down. These little hammocks were the homes of many of the botan- ical treasures of the region. Within them were formerly discov- ered numbers of West Indian plants not known to occur elsewhere on the North American mainland. The half dozen of these ham- mocks which we examined critically during this last expedition were found to be almost total wrecks. Their complete natural restoration will be a question of at least a century, if the home- steader does not finish the destruction already accomplished by the wind. Formerly, the spreading tops of the tall trees, whose trunks varied from two to four feet or more in diameter, interlaced with one another, and the branches were further bound together by means of numerous herbaceous and woody vines. The direct sunlight was thus wholly excluded from the inside of the ham- mocks, and no matter at what angle the sun might be, twilight reigned there from sunrise to sunset. Many species of plants, both flowering and flowed ess, that could not even exist elsewhere in the vicinity, were found to thrive there luxuriantly. In the case of the Florida Keys, some of the upper islands were twice completely submerged during the hurricane, first by the water blown in from the ocean while the wind came from the southeast, and then by the water blown out from the bay when the wind came from the northwest. Elliott's Key was a conspic- uous example of devastation. Under normal conditions the veg- etation of this key is luxuriant, both the herbaceous and woody plants growing in such masses as to be almost impenetrable at most places, and, as seen from the bay or from the ocean, exhib- iting a solid bank of green. During our last visit this key pre- sented the aspect of a desert ; the herbaceous vegetation and small shrubbery was temporarily almost annihilated by the deluge of salt water, while the trees and shrubs presented leaf- less and apparently dead*skeletons, the wind having whipped off Digitized by VjOOQIC 26 every leaf. Several weeks after the storm all of the trees, as if recovering from the shock, started simultaneously to put forth not only new leaves, but also flowers. Our investigations on the keys were confined to the northern ones.^and we have learned that on account of their floras, as well as their position, Virginia Key and Key Biscayne, which lie op- posite Miami and Cocoanut Grove, are to be associated with the mainland, which ends as a narrow peninsula just north of them, and not with the rest of the keys ; from which, moreover, they are separated by an interval of almost ten miles, leaving out of consideration the insignificant Soldier's Key, which is a mere iso- lated sand-bar about five miles south of Cape Florida. Their vegetation consists of a dense growth of mangrove on the side facing the bay, the usual tropical beach flora along the ocean and a few of the sand-dune plants which are common for many miles northward along the coast. Our work on the mainland was considerably impeded by the effects of the hurricane, the high water in the everglades, which in some sections partially submerged the islands and filled all of the prairies, and the fallen trees throughout the pinelands greatly delayed our progress. We experienced the most difficulty in making progress to the southwest of the settlement of Cutler, where time was consumed in mending both harness and wagon. Naturally, accidents happened in the more unfavorable places. At one point in the everglades, when the doubletree and one singletree of the wagon and three traces and several minor straps of the harness all broke simultaneously, the driver, before he re- covered from the shock, had the charity to suggest that he ride the horses to the nearest point of dry land and that the rest of us pull the wagon out. Contrary to the exhilarating effect which the environment of these rugged and uninhabited regions had on most of us, it seemed to have a uniformly depressing effect on our drivers. This was most plainly shown by the fact that we had a new driver on each successive excursion. The monotony of wading the submerged prairies, which are usually dry at that season, was varied by both the depth of the soft mud and the number of the treacherous pot-holes in the rock bottom under Digitized by VjOOQIC 27 the mud. In fact^ we became so accustomed to an amphibious mode of life that several of the party complained that they did not feel natural when deprived of the aquatic stage for any length of time. We have now accumulated enough knowledge of the. flora of these islands of coral sand-rock in the everglades to make the solution of many problems, both general and local, very interest- ing. This chain of everglade keys is a miniature of the Florida Keys, both in its crescent shape and its flora, and also of the West Indies in the character of its vegetation. It is surrounded by the everglades, except where the upper islands touch Biscayne Bay at points from Miami to Cutler. Before these islands were elevated to their .present altitude, they were probably surrounded by a shallow sea just as the Florida Keys are at the present time. This being the case, we can easily account for the tropical American flora now inhabiting them. After sufficient elevation had taken place, the surrounding sea was transformed into the vast spring now known as the everglades. Conditions becom- ing favorable, the plants of the flora of northern peninsular Florida advanced southward and naturally took complete posses- sion of the area that was formerly the sea, thus surrounding and isolating the wholly different flora of the islands. In fact, the two floras are so sharply delimited that one can often stand with one foot on plants characteristic of the high northern regions and the other on plants restricted to the tropics. It is not an un- common experience to see colonies of plants common in Canada, such as the arrowarum {Peltandra)^ the lizard's tail {Saururus) and the ground-nut {Apios), growing side by side with tropical palms, cycads, orchids and bromeliads. The total area of these islands is perhaps about one hundred and fifty square miles. Those that we have explored have yielded between five and six hundred species of native flowering plants, surely a very large number when we consider that the solid rock is exposed everywhere and that soil in the sense thSit we are accustomed to think of it does not occur there. The close relationship of this flora to that of the West Indies is now established by the fact that considerably more than one half Digitized by VjOOQIC 28 of the species found on the islands south of Miami are also native in Cuba and the Bahamas. Since the publication of my last report on exploration in southern Florida,* and a subsequently printed paper on the species added to the flora of that state.f we have secured over fifty more species not before known to grow on the North Ameri- can mainland. Eight or ten of these are complete novelties, in- asmuch as they are not yet described. Noteworthy among the recent collections, which make an aggregate of 3,200 specimens, are seven species not previously included in the arborescent flora of the United States. Respectfully submitted, J. K. Small, Head Curator of the Museums and Herbarium. THE MITTEN COLLECTION OF MOSSES AND HEPATICS. William Mitten died at Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, England, on July 20, 1906. Following his last request, his daughter. Miss Flora Mitten, offered his entire collection of mosses and hepatics to Mrs. N. L. Britton and the collection was purchased for the 'New York Botanical Garden for ;f 400, the donors being Messrs. D. O. Mills, Andrew Carnegie, J. Pierpont Morgan, Jas. B. •Ford, Geo. W. Perkins and Charles F. Cox. At the request of Dr. Alfred Russell Wallace, Mr. Mitten's executor, a representative of the Garden, Mr. R. S. Williams, was sent to pack and ship the collection, which was received safe and in good condition on December 6, 1906. Besides twenty large boxes full of mosses, the collection contains ten boxes of hepatics. Mrs. Britton also received as a gift from Miss Mitten a large photograph of her father and his personal copy of the ** Musci Austro-Americani,\" his greatest work, which, strange to say, is absolutely without notes or writing of any kind, as Mr. Mitten was in the habit of laying memoranda and descriptions of subsequent additions in the covers with his specimens. • * Jour.

Digitized by VjOOQIC 29 Two accounts of Mr. Mitten's life and work have appeared, one in the Journal of Botany for October, igo6, by W. Botting Hemsley and the other in the Bryologist for January, 1907, by William Edward Nicholson, both of which are interesting per- sonal sketches, the latter giving a bibliographical list, but neither of them containing any account of his collections. In a letter dated September 5. 1906, Dr. Wallace states that *' Nobody ever touched, or hardly ever saw these collections but Mr. Mitten himself and a few specialist visitors. Although I have never examined them myself, as a friend (and a son-in-law) of Mr. Mitten for forty years, I know something of them and I am inclined to think that they constitute the richest (or nearly the richest) private collection of those groups in existence, while it is doubtful if any public collections are much richer. Mr. Mitten, as you know, has studied and described mosses for nearly sixty years, and for a long time was the greatest British authority on them, and received collections to sort, name, and describe from collectors, museums, and travelers, in every part of the world. Of all these he reserved sets for himself, and has thus accumu- lated an enormous collection, the nomenclature and arrangement of which he was at work at up to the end of his life.\" Beginning in 1851 with a list of mosses and hepatics from the vicinity of his home in Sussex, the 57 titles which follow include studies of the mosses and hepatics from Quito, Portugal, New Zealand, Panama, the East Indies, Tasmania, Fiji, Tropical Africa, the Azores, Japan and China, Samoa, Ceylon, St. Paul, and St. Helena, Bermuda, Kerguelen, Cape of Good Hope, Morocco, Polynesia, British Guiana, Socotra and Borneo. His largest and chief work was the description of the mosses of South America, including Central American and West Indian species! This was published as Vol. 12 of the Journal of the Linnean Society in 1869. It contains 659 pages and includes 603 species and 19 genera new to the region, of which the types are in his herbarium. It was largely based on the collections made by Richard Spruce in his travels up the Amazon, Orinoco and Rio N^ro and across the Andes, and by Jameson, in Peru ; as well as those made by Lindig and Weir in New Granada ; Digitized by VjOOQIC 30 Burchell and Glaziou in Brazil ; Funck and Schlim in Venezuela ; Martens, Galeotti and Bourgeau in Mexico ; Godman and Salvin in Guatemala, and by Seemann in Panama. Collections from the West Indian islands include the following : From Jamaica by Swartz, Purdie, Wilds, Wilson, Hart, Jenman and Harris ; from Cuba by Wright ; from Grenada by Broadway ; from St. Christo- pher by Breutel ; from Trinidad by Fendler and Cruger ; and from Haiti and Santo Domingo by Swartz. He had very few mosses from the French Antilles, a lack which has already been sup- plied in the Garden collections by the purchase of the herbarium of Pere Duss, made in the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, which contains many species whose type localities have since been destroyed by the volcanic eruption* of Mt. Pelee. His collections are not as rich in European exsiccatae as that of Jaeger, but they supplement those already at the Garden with several sets that were lacking, notably Spruce's Mosses of the Pyrenees. There are also two fine sets of Drummond's First Arctic and Canadian Collections of North American Mosses, secured during the second Land Arctic Expedition under the command of Sir John Franklin, in 1828. One of these sets was the property of Sir John Richardson. He also had a set of Drummond's Second Collection from the Southern States, 1841, one of Sullivant's Musci Alleghanienses, 1845, and one of Sul- livant and Lesquereux's Musci Boreali Americani, First Edition, 1856. Besides these he had collections from Richardson made in the Northwest Territory from the vicinity of Great Bear and Great Slave Lake ; from Davis Strait and Arctic America by James Taylor ; from Lake Winnipeg, Saskatchewan and the Rocky Mountains by Bourgeau in Palliser's British North American Ex- pedition. 1859; ^\"d from the Northwest Coast, Vancouver Island and British Columbia by Menzies, Lyall and Douglas. The mosses of the 49th parallel, or the northern boundary of the United States, were named and listed by Mitten, in the Proceed- ings of the Linnean Society, 1864. From John Macdun, he re- ceived a fine set of the mosses of Ontario. He also had speci- mens sent by Dr. C. W. Short from Kentucky, Chapman from Florida, T. P. James from New Hampshire, and John Torrey rom New York. Digitized by VjOOQIC 31 Among the most valuable of his collections are those made by the various Arctic and Antarctic Expeditions. Among these are the sets of mosses from Spitzbergen collected by Parry and Ross in 1819-1820, from the herbarium of Robert Brown, and those collected in Greenland, Baffin's Bay and Melville Island by Franklin in his search for the Northwest Passage. There are also collections made by Seemann on the Voyage of H. M. S. Herald in 1 845-1 851 at Panama, by the Transit of Venus Expe- dition in 1874-1875, by Moseley on the Voyage of the Chal- lenger in 1875. including specimens from Bermuda, and by the Roraima Expedition in British Guiana in 1884. Asiatic mosses are represented by collections in the Himalayas by Hooker and Thomson ; in Nepal by Griffith ; in Ceylon by Thwaites ; and in Burma and the Straits Settlements by Griffith. A few Chinese and Japanese mosses also were described in 1864, Those from Borneo, Sumatra and Java, including Fleischer's Musci Archipelagi Indici, will be very useful in naming the recent collections made in the Philippines by Mr. R. S. Williams. The collections from New Zealand made by Hutton and Kirk and from Samoa by Powell seem to be largely duplicated and available for exchanges. Besides these, there are other Polynesian mosses from Fiji and New Caledonia, and Australian mosses from Mel- bourne, Port Philip, Gippsland, Victoria and New South Wales, African collections were received from Central Africa, collected by Bishop Hannington and from Kilimanjaro by H. H. Johnston ; from West Africa from the Cameroons and River Niger ; from Southern Africa, including Rehman's exsiccatae of 1875-1877 ; from the Cape of Good Hope by Milne and Eaton and McGilli- vray and Burchell ; from Madagascar by Pool ; from Mauritius by Ayres, Balfour and Telfair ; from Bourbon and Socotra by J. B. Balfour ; from St. Thomas by G. Mann ; from Algiers and Morocco by Sir John Ball ; and from Fernando Po and St. Helena, the Azores, and the Atlantic Islands of Madeira and Canary. Local mosses from the vicinity of Hurstpierpoint and other parts of Sussex and Kent, which had been made up into sets for exchange, are also well represented ; together with several dupli- Digitized by VjOOQIC 32 cate sets of Drumniond's mosses of Scotland and collections of his own from Wales. The entire collection abounds in beautiful drawings, which usually accompany the specimens. It frequently happens that every species in a cover is illustrated. NATURE-STUDY AS AN EDUCATION.* Nature-study has been exploited during the last score of years in this country in various ways. It began here as an off-shoot of the so-called object-lessons introduced by Dr. Sheldon into the Oswego Normal School, and received further stimulus in the Cook County Normal School under Dr. Francis Parker and Mr. W. S. Jackman, who attempted the first formulation of nature- study as a distinct subject, and prepared a text-book of numer- ous isolated suggestions for the teacher, these suggestions ranging through many subjects and sometimes going far afield. And yet the key-note of the book as stated by the author rings out strong and true : \" Let us place the children in the woods and fields that they may study nature at work.\" About the same time (1889), Mr. Arthur C. Boyden of the Bridgewater Normal School championed the new idea, began teaching in the state institutes of Massachusetts, and got out a pamphlet on the \"Study of Trees in Plymouth County** ; one of the first of a long series of fluttering nature-study leaflets by men and women who, knowing much or little or nothing at all about the subject, have found the theme a good one to write upon. At the same time, also, a department ot nature-study was organized in the Summer School of Cottage City under the name of elementary science, and in the latter part of the eighties, na- ture-study under the name of elementary science was receiving consideration in many schools in several states. From 1890 to 1895, exhibits of nature-work were common in cities, the display at the World's Fair in Chicago being the cul- mination of this phase of development. ♦Read before the convention of the New York Botanical Garden January 23, 1906. Published simultaneously in the Garden Journal and the Nature Study Re- view. Digitized by VjOOQIC 33 About ten years after the first introduction of elementary science into the grades, two men came forward to whom children will be grateful for centuries to come. Of all the numerous writers who have considered nature-study from one standpoint or another, the principles set forth by Professor Bailey of Cornell and Professor Hodge of Clark, are as sane and practical as any- thing yet presented. To little people shivering over their first experience in the clear, cold atmosphere of science, a warmer temperature and more genial atmosphere were eagerly welcomed. While there is no doubt of the constant advance of nature- study over the country as a whole, yet the gain is not the mushroom growth of the first few years, and this is well. There has been lack of fibro-vascular tissue, and in more than one place nature-study has been dropped after a trial. This has occurred in a few large cities where the problem is most difficult, or where the school-board has failed to recognize the value of nature-study as a means of education, or in some cases where the teaching has been inadequate. Nature-study, then, has already passed through various phases with us : first came the experiment followed by the exhibition which so inspired the on-lookers that it straightway became a fad ; then came the period of reaction and criticism when nature- study became less serious — more of a recreation — and here came the opportunity to run in the unusual, the exceptional, the sensational in nature literature, which is not nature-study at all, though it may be very good literature ; and now our leading lights tell us that nature-study is an idea, an atmosphere, an attitude, — in a word, it is spirit. This, then, is the promise of the future, and our prophets prophesy wisely and well. But we cannot hope for any universal fulfillment of the prophesy for several genera- tions to come — not until there has been time to train our teachers, and they in turn have had the opportunity of training the children who are to be the parents of the next generation. In the next generation we may begin to look for parents who will not destroy the attitude, the atmosphere of nature-study, which is an inherent part of the nature of the normal child. He inherits from ancestors remote a primitive love of nature and every natural Digitized by VjOOQIC 34 object. Any child of three years turned loose in a small space out-of-doors where there is good clean dirt with worms in it, and pebbles, where green things are growing, where the chance cater- pillar and toad and small snake are free to come and go, has amusement for a summer. Some one has well said : <* Out-doors, God amused him ; in-doors his mother ; And the finite can never satisfy as the Infinite/' It is only when the child learns from others that he \" must not touch the toad or he will get warts,\" that the harmless garter- snake is a poisonous reptile, that the caterpillar will bite ; that his faith in nature is shaken, the nature-study atmosphere dark- ened, and the nature-study spirit hampered. Dr. M. T. Cook says that in Cuba he frequently gave his one- year-old son small snakes to play with, and the child considered them the most interesting kind of a plaything, until at the age of four he began to run with other children. In a short time the boy became afraid of snakes and is still afraid of them. Profes- sor Hooker, of Mt. Holyoke College, had a little visitor whom she found it hard to entertain, so she brought out some snakes which she called her \" little friends.*' The child was delighted, and played with them happily until she heard some one call them snakes, then dropped them in fear and disgust. A child in the first primary grade of the University School for Girls in Chicago brought a tiny leafless twig to her teacher and asked her to use it for the nature-study lesson. The teacher thought it a rather small affair, but a leaf-bud or two offered suggestion, and the teacher held out for what seemed to her a very creditable length of time and then turned with relief to a gay picture of an oriole on the wall. But the children did not want orioles in pictures on the wall ; they wanted a little live twig, and the small girl who had brought it in raised her hand and asked severely, ** Why don't you go on with the nature- science ? \" That which we are to aim for, then, we have at the very be- ginning ; but by the time that the child goes to school he has lost more or less of it, and it is more difficult to restore it in a Digitized by VjOOQIC 35 soil that has been sterilized than it would be to start anew in fresh soil. Allowing for individual exceptions, I have found it true tl^t interest in nature-study in schools where the subject is not a vital one varies inversely with the age of the children, and that the difficulty in exciting an interest varies directly with the age. The problem that confronts us is, how shall we recover that which has been lost ; how shall we reach the ideal, the pervad- ing atmosphere that colors, the idea that permeates the whole life, the nature-study spirit. Now the child of the graded school has many teachers. It is a chance if he ever has one who really un- derstands and fully comprehends just what Bailey means by atmos- phere and attitude and idea and spirit It is possible that one may be all this and that the school may have the spirit and never know it. I am not sure but this is the essence of the whole thing — the spirit free because unconscious of itself. At one of the State Summer Schools held in Bennington, Vermont, a young teacher came to me and told me how much she regretted the impossibility of having any nature-study in the little rural school where she taught. '* The parents are not willing that the time should be given in school,\" she said, \" the programme is already crowded, we have no money with which to buy books. Put,*' she added, \" there is a little brook back of the school house, and the children and I stay out there about all the time at recess and noon and we all go early in the morning before school. We have a series of pools, and in them we have several kinds of fish, and in one pool we have some salamanders, and in another turtles, and in another pollywogs. We feed them and keep the pools in order and the children do have such a good time. Then a little house-wren came into the school house and built her nest on the stove-pipe by the chimney, right in the school room. And the children would keep just as still as pos- sible so as not to disturb her.\" This dear girl assured me over and over again with tears in her eyes that she would be so glad to have nature-study in her school, but that it was simply an impossibility ! This illustrates how difficult it is for one to grasp the real significance of the Digitized by VjOOQIC 36 study as presented by even so plain and simple and straightfor- ward a speaker as Professor Bailey. Atmosphere is intangible at best, and not an easy mark for the inexperienced. One may be sure the arrow will hit somewhere, even if sent at random, and many of our public-school teachers have evidently taken refuge in this thought, and the result is random and haphazard. The result would be the same and perhaps the idea might seem more definite, if, with the idea of attitude as the ultimate goal, we should begin by aiming at some nearer mark. To in- spire the boys and girls with a vital rational interest in their im- mediate natural environment — an interest that shall continually widen with the circles of growing experience and knowledge founded on experience, and so lead to a wider environment — this is concrete and feasible. In the country, there is such abundance of material that the question is one of choice ; in the more cramped conditions of the larger cities, the question of choice is largely eliminated, and here it is necessary to seize upon every natural object that comes within the reach of the children and to widen their pathetically limited environment by constantly reaching out. always from something they have seen or experienced, to the things beyond, and to inspire them with a desire to learn what lies outside the few blocks which immediately surround them. Settlement- workers tell us that most children in the crowded tenement dis- tricts seldom go beyond the half-dozen blocks which supply the necessities of life. A little girl of nine years was taken to the country for the first time. She was amazed beyond measure ; she had attended the public-schools, but she had never been told that the earth was not paved all over, and it had never oc- curred to her that it could be any other way. Let us teach the children to love the parks, not simply as pleasant places in which to play but as places where one can know the trees as individuals that in time may become one's comrades and friends. To know the trees that are in our parks, to know them by their outlines and buds and twigs and leaves and flowers and fruits, and to watch the changes in them from week to week and season to Digitized by VjOOQIC 37 season is to have an unfailing resource for pleasure throughout life. To teach the child a proper appreciation of our parks and scenery and to make him feel a sense of ownership in them is to make him some day a better man. We can do no better and go no farther today than did Aris- totle when he said : ** It is clear then that there are branches of education and learning which we must study with a view to the enjoyment of leisure, and these are to be valued for their own sake ; whereas those kinds of knowledge which are useful in business are to be deemed necessary, and exist for the sake of other things. It is evident then that there is a sort of education in which parents should train their sons, not as being useful or necessary, but because it is liberal or noble.\" In commenting upon this passage, Burnet in ''Aristotle on Education '* says : *'Here in simple form is the perennial problem as to whether the end of educa- tion is culture, or to fit us for the business of life. The most ardent business men will tell you that they work hard in order that they may be able to retire ; the misfortune is that when they have retired they are very oflen at a loss what to do with their time. *' An education which took as its aim to train people in such a way that they could rightly enjoy the rest which they have earned by a life of toil would, we can see, have a good deal to say for itself, and might be quite as ** practical '' as one which merely anticipated the \"useful and necessary\" activities of the business life itself. It might sound strange at first, but it would not be amiss if we were once more to speak with Aristotle of the noble enjoyment of leisure as the end of education in its highest sense. It is just the want of such an education that makes men put up with that very poor and cheap substitute for theoria, the life of amusement. •* The Gospel of Work is a noble one and has been nobly preached^ but the neglect of the still higher Gospel of Leisure has produced the results which Aristotle has indicated so clearly. We cannot always work, and if our education has not fitted us to use our spare time rightly, we are sure to take to the life of mere amusement. We all know men who would be transformed if only they knew what to do with themselves when they arc not at work. We can all see that whole classes of the community arc sunk in needless degradation just because their lives are a succession of periods of overwork and intervals of low or vicious relaxation. And we can see too that the end of the nineteenth century, the century of work, has been marked by a morbid, an abnormal growth of the craving for amusement and excitement which has threatened at times to break up society altogether. It is from the Greeks that we can best learn the cause and cure of these ills.\" Of the thousands of poor and ignorant people who visit the New York Botanical Garden during the spring and summer and autumn months, on the one day of leisure in the week, one does not dare to venture a guess at the per cent, of those who really Digitized by VjOOQIC 38 care for the things of the park aside from space and coolness. If only these people had been educated to an appreciation of nature, what an additional inspiration this place would become in their sordid lives ! President Cleveland went fishing when the affairs of state be- came too taxing ; President Roosevelt hunts bears. When the little boy in the first grade of to-day becomes president, the same instinctive craving for nature may be satisfied in a simpler way if nature-study be rightly taught. It was not the fish that President Cleveland wanted ; he could have bought them with much less trouble at the market. It is not the bear-skins that President Roosevelt .wants ; he can buy them at the furrier's. What both men want is the free pure air, the untrammeled woods, the sound of rippling water, the call of the thrush, ferns, moss and wild things ; in a word, nature. And, after all, fish and bears are only excuses ; just the same results could be had by hunting with a camera, or in listing the trees or studying the ecology of a region, or in hunting for rare ferns. The most serious problem of nature-study just now is the teacher of nature-study. At present she must be born, for she cannot be made, except in a few places. Without question there are some excellent teachers who would never become good teachers of nature-study, no matter what advantages they might receive. But with these rare exceptions, the good teacher would also make a good teacher of nature-study if only she knew her subject. How can she have any adequate comprehension of that which she has not herself experienced ? She did not have na- ture-study in the grades when a child herself; she did not get it in the high school except in rare instances ; there are scarcely a score of normal schools that offer nature-study as nature-study ; and the number of colleges that offer such courses can be counted on the fingers of one hand. Courses in biology, including botany and zoology, are now generally offered in the college, the normal school and the high school ; but these courses are largely domi- nated by the spirit of the scientist and the specialist — and rightfully so. A little girl said to me : ** I don't care at all for botany, but I Digitized by VjOOQIC 39 just love flowers.*' Now the specialist may love botany and not care for flowers. Particularly if he works along histological or embryological lines, he may be wholly ignorant of nature in any field except the somewhat limited one bounded by the horizon of his microscope. I one day asked a most enthusiastic and suc- cessful instructor in one of our leading universities what a certain common wild-flower of that region, new to me, looked like. This man had made something of a specialty of the points brought out in the development of this particular flower and had prepared many slides from it. He replied that he did not know what the flower looked like, and did not care, that that was not the point ; that he did not know any flowers by their names in the field, he had no time to learn them, and he did not know what good it would do him if he did know. A student had just finished her research on a problem con- nected with pines and had taken her degree. She was out driving with a friend who inquired about some pines they were passing. '* Oh, I don't know anything about our native pines, not even their names,\" was the reply. Even in the high school the courses in botany and zoology have been until quite recently too technical and limited to cer- tain lines to fit the requirements of college entrance. Fitting for college and fitting for life have been two quite different things. And nature-study should be taught in the grades. Where shall the teacher learn ? Can she get it from books ? A few summers ago I was riding on the front seat of a trolley car through a beautiful Vermont valley at sunset. A woman whose dress and general air bespoke culture and refinement sat beside me. She was wholly absorbed in the pages of a book and utterly oblivious to the surrounding beauty and glory. I con- cluded that she was doubtless so familiar with the place that its charms were no longer felt, and I pitied her. We passed a large and stately building on a hillside. ** Pardon me,\" I said, \" will you kindly tell me what that building is? \" \" I'm sure I don't know,\" was the reply. *' I was never here before.\" and she re- lapsed into the book again. Then I was seized with curiosity to know what she could be reading. The car gave a favorable Digitized by VjOOQIC 40 lurch, I leaned over, and caught the title of the book, \"Self-CuU ture,\" and the chapter-heading at the top of the page read '•^The Love of Nature.*' In addition to the quickened and widened environment of the child, which should be the first aim of the teacher of nature-study, we q^iay look with assurance for many valuable results which are by-products. In the past one or another of the by-products has too often been mistaken for the main object. This was especially true at first when it was claimed that the greatest gain to be derived from the study of natural objects is increased power of observation. This increase is a natural result ; one looks at the things he is interested in, and the more things one is interested in and the more he is interested in some one thing, the more he sees. *' It is active seeing, not passive looking which constitutes obser- vation,\" says Professor Ganong. The result should culminate in visualization — the power to reproduce subjectively that which has been seen objectively. The nature-teacher said to the third-grade class of a school in Missouri : ** Children, I want you to watch a spider and see if you can learn something about it that you did not know before. Then I would like you to write down whatever you find out and bring it to me.\" The next day Locke Sawyer brought in the following to his teacher : \" Onct I sawn a spider spin his web. He span it on the winder-pain. I watched him as clost as I could. He went along in front and spun behind.\" Here is the real thing — visualization: one sees the spider with the boy, \" going along in front and spinning behind.\" The delighted teacher, carried away by the enthusiasm of the moment, began to tell the children how spiders spin, how they have a little res- ervoir of adhesive liquid substance within, which is forced out and hardens into a thread on exposure to the air. Locke was vastly interested ; he wanted to write down what the teacher had said, and at his request his paper was returned. This is what he added : *' Inside of himself the spider has two tin cans. These are for its web, which is glue before it is spun.\" A second scientific value of nature-study is that it develops the power of reason. One learns to generalize from the particular Digitized by VjOOQIC 41 and to make critical comparison. The whole subject of adapta- tions comes in here and appeals strongly to the child. Bills and beaks and teeth and feet and tails take on new interest when one grasps the fact that they are to serve some special need. Nature- study leads to faith in causality, which involves the belief that every phenomenon is linked with preceding factors. The child is freed from superstition ; and bats that cause your hair to fall out, and toads that cause warts, and devil's-darning-needles that sew up your ear if you ever told a lie, lose their terrors and become objects of interest and perhaps companionship. Of the cultural instincts which are developed, we may note briefly : 1. Power of expression ; the child can talk about the thing he is interested in, he can write about it, he can make a picture of it. But let his teacher remember that these are the products of nature-study, and that nature-study can never be the product of talking or writing or drawing. The child's language should be more accurate and logical. He should learn to tell the truth and not exaggerate. Laboratory methods should lead to greater skill and dexterity in the use of the hands. 2. Knowledge for its own sake and love of knowledge should result from the widened environment of the child. Knowing his own surroundings, he is able to interpret what he reads and geography takes on a new meaning. 3. The aesthetic values of nature-study are not to be over- looked in a time when utilitarian ideas are as prominent as today. Let the child know that the sky and clouds and sunset coloring and the river and hills beyond are his in the same sense in which the parks are his — to appreciate and enjoy. Whatever one can see that is beautiful is his own as much as though it were his individual property. All that any one can do with a beautiful object is to contemplate it with appreciation and enjoyment It is possible for the poorest child to be richer than the multi- millionaire. 4. The industrial and economic side of the question appeals to many, especially to parents and school-boards. Plants and animals beneficial and injurious, pests and their extermination. Digitized by VjOOQIC 42 problems of food and clothing, of shelter and sanitation and personal hygiene, all become a legitimate part of the great subject. 5. Finally, the ethical value of nature-study which results in happiness to the individual is most important. One is never happier than when riding a hobby and riding hard. Birds or butterflies, trees or mosses, ferns or fungi — it doesn't matter, so long as one has an absorbing interest in the world without. Health and happiness are not to be despised in these days of nerves and constant (Remands for new sensations. To the love of all created things nature-study should lead, and if it be true that love is the greatest thing in the world then nature-study is indeed justified. A man who ranks high in the scientific world showed this spirit when he carried a tub of sea- water back to the beach from which it came, a distance of some rods, and poured the water into the sea saying, ** I could not see any life there but it would be a pity to run any risk of destroying life needlessly.\" That the country -boy will see more of interest and beauty in his surroundings, and that the city-boy will learn greater appre- ciation of the country may be reasonably expected ; but not until the agricultural side of nature-study has been much developed can we hope for that which will help to solve the greater problems of rural districts. Nature-study has no need to demand more than rightfully belongs to her. Mary Perle Anderson. NOTES, NEWS AND COMMENT. Mr. C. F. Millspaugh, of the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, spent about two weeks at the Garden before his departure for the Bahamas. Dr. N. L. Britton and Mrs. Britton left New York on Feb- ruary 1 1 for the Bahamas, where they will spend several weeks in botanical exploration. Mr. C. F. Millspaugh will join them at Nassau. Dr. Marshall A. Howe returned on January 30 from an ex- pedition to Jamaica, where he devoted five or six weeks to col- GooQle Digitized by VjOOQ 43 lecting and studying marine algae in Kingston Harbor and vicinity and at Montego Bay. When the disastrous earthquake of January 14 occurred, he was at Montego Bay, where the shock was comparatively light. His Kingston collections, which were stored at the time in a wooden office building on the water-front of that ill-fated city, were uninjured by the earthquake and es- caped the subsequent fire. In connection with the New York meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, during Convoca- tion Week, 1 906- 1 907, an exhibition was held at the American Museum of Natural History, from December 28 to January 14, by the New York Academy of Sciences. The purpose of the exhibition was to illustrate the most recent advancement in the diflFerent branches of science. The Associate Committee for botany consisted of C. Stuart Gager (Charman), George Francis Atkinson, William L. Bray, John Merle Coulter, Margaret Clay Ferguson, Byron David Halsted, Edward Charles Jeffrey, Duncan Starr Johnson, and Lucien M. Underwood. The botanical ex- hibit, assembled from various institutions and workers through- out the United States, consisted of herbarium, alcoholic, and living specimens, photographs and drawings, microscopic prep- arations, new apparatus, and literature ; representing recent ad- vancement in physiology, morphology, taxonomy, paleobotany, teratology, pathology, cytology, horticulture, the pedagogy of botany, and the development of botanical gardens and labora- tories. There was a total of about forty-five entries, making the botany exhibit the largest, but one, of the exhibition. Of the precipitation for January, i^}4 inches of snow fall were recorded in addition to 1.54 inches of rain. Maximum tempera- tures were recorded of 58° on the 4th, 67.5° on the 7th, 52.2° on the 20th, and 37° on the 2 2d. Also minimum temperatures of 27.5° on the 6th, 16.5° on the loth, 10° on the 17th, 0° on the 24th, and 1 1° on the 31st. Digitized by VjOOQIC 44 ACCESSIONS.
