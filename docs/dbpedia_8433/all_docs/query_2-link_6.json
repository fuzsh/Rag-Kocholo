THE NEW ACCADIAN. By the Rev. C. J. Ball, M.A., Oxon., CHAPLAIN OF LINCOLN'S INN ; FORMERLY CENSOR AND LECTURER IN KING'S COLLEGE, LONDON. Some time ago I began to study Chinese, not so much with a view to mastering the literature of that remarkable language, as for purposes of philological comparison. I had not gone far before I was struck by an apparent parallelism of sound between a series of terms with which I was already familiar in the Babylonian syllabaries, and a Chinese series of similar import. The Accadian terms were these : A-A (or AI), \" father.\" A-A (or AI), \"moon.\" A \"hand,\" \"side.\" A \"son.\" and the Chinese : ye, \" father \" (Amoy id). yueh, \" moon.\" yu, \" hand.\" yu, \" young.\" These coincidences appeared to me so curious, that I thought it might be worth while to make further investigation in order to determine, if possible, whether there might not be something more in them than mere accident. I could not help remembering that in Accadian the moon is a goddess, and the consort of the sun, just as she is in Chinese, whereas in the Semitic languages generally, the term for \" moon \" is of the masculine gender ; so that a Babylonian or an Assyrian uninfluenced by non-Semitic ideas, would have naturally spoken of the moon-god. Then, again, the Turkish ai, \" moon,\" was present to my mind, as also the Coptic Ioh (a de- scendant of the old Egyptian cta/i), and even the Greek Io, which Pausanias tells us was a title of the moon-goddess at Argos. It seemed noteworthy that all these names contained the^-sound, which Assyrian scholars consider to be either expressed or suppressed in the sign ]] ^ a-a or a-i. 4 Nov. s] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. Now it was plain that if I wished to trace a possible connection between two languages so remote from each other in time and place as the old non-Semitic idiom of Babylonia and the Mandarin dialect of Chinese, it would not do to be satisfied with mere similarities of sound, even when the inference of identity might seem to be con- firmed by similarity of meaning. Scientific philology is not a hotch- potch of isolated resemblances. The proper course appeared to be to try to establish uniformities in the permutation of sounds between the two languages. I had chanced to begin with words presenting an initial y in Chinese, so I proceeded to look for other instances of correspon- dence involving this letter. The advanced stage of phonetic decay presented by the Mandarin dialect, and the fact, familiar in philology, of initial G wearing down in course of time to a Y sound, at once suggested that the numerous cases of initial Y in the common language of modern China might exemplify this change. If this idea were correct, and Chinese were really cognate with Accadian, I expected to find that the substitution of an initial G for a Y in Chinese words would yield forms recognisably related to corres- ponding Accadian terms. Accordingly, I wrote the Chinese ye, \" night,\" with a g, and got the Accadian gk, \" night \" (Assyrian tniisu). It was an isolated fact, but it encouraged me to pursue what might, after all, turn out to be a will-o'-the-wisp. The result was the following list : Accadian. Chinese, ge, gea, \"night.\" ye, \"night.\" gig (salmu), \"shadow,\" \"dark,\" yt'ng, \" a shadow \"; yu, \"dark.\" \"image,\" \"likeness.\" yin, \"shady,\" \"a shade.\" (eqlitu), \"darkness.\" GU (sas/i, qibii, apalu, etc.), \"to yu, \" to speak \"; yen, \"word.'' speak.\" gig (tnarsu, fnursu), \"sick,\" yang, \"sickness.\" \"sickness.\" gana (ginu), \"garden.\" yuen, \"garden.\" {eqlu), \"field.\" gis, gi {edu), \" one.\" yih, \" one.\" ges (jr; gas), Sikaru, \"new wine,\" yu, \" new wine.\" or \"strong drink\" of any kind. gin (alaku), \"to walk,\" \"march.\" yin, \"to journey,\" \"move on.\" Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY. [1889. Gi, gin (qatw), \"a reed.\" yih, \"a dart\"; yoh, \"a musical reed\"; yin, \"a long spear, or pointed weapon.\" (gis)kan-na (ganag? gana? yin,\" a. seal.\" kunukku), \"a seal.\" 6u (iss/iru), \"a bird,\" \"winged yii, \" wings \"; yV, \" wings.\" thing,\" VOlucris, to Tre-reivov. GA (uii/iu), \"a fish.\" yii, \"fish.\" 6u, ge (i^ basii), \"to be.\" yu, \"to be.\" Having obtained similar results from the comparison of eight other initial consonants, b, d, k, p, t, 1, m, n, s, s, I thought I might venture to lay the whole before Professor R. K. Douglas, of the British Museum. I was especially anxious to know where to find the older forms of the Chinese language, as it was obvious that, if my theory of an earlier g in place of the Mandarin y could be supported by the history of the language, the above comparisons would be all the more secure. Professor Douglas gave me every possible en- couragement to continue my researches, and advised the use of Dr. Samuel Wells Williams' great Syllabic Dictionary (Shanghai, 1874).* To recur now to the list of apparently common terms which I have already indicated ; there would be little difficulty in extending the list to almost indefinite dimensions, especially if we have regard to the older forms of the Chinese words as recorded in the native dictionaries, and as preserved in the actual usage of the so-called Chinese dialects, or rather cognate languages of Amoy, Canton, Swatow, Fuhchau, Shanghai, and Chifu, of which the first two appear to have undergone least phonetic change. For instance, gud, gu (alj>u, siiru,), is Accadian for \"ox,\" \"cow.\" This corresponds to * Afterwards I procured a dictionary of the Amoy vernacular, by the Rev. Carstairs Douglas (London, Triibner, 1873) > a grammar and reading-book of the ( lanton dialect by the Rev. \\V. Lobscheid (Hong Kong, 1864) ; Du Ponceau on Chinese Writing (Philadelphia, 1838), which includes a lexicon of the Cochin Chinese; Stephan Endlicher's Anfangsgriinde der Chinesischen Grammatik ( Wien, 1845); Bayer's Museum Sinicum (Petropoli, 1730), and other works. When this paper was already at press, Professor Douglas kindly lent me I >r. Edkins1 monograph 'The Evolution of the Chinese Language' (Triibners, 1888), in which I find many remarkable facts that tell in favour of the views expressed in the text. The ' Chinese Manual ' of Professor Douglas has also been of the greatest service to me, owing to the clear and handy form in which it presents a multitude of facts (London, 1889). 6 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. the Chinese niu, \" ox,\" \" cow,\" \" cattle,\" of which one of the old sounds was ngu, and which appears in Cantonese as ngau, in Swatow as gu, in Amoy as giu, in Fuhchau as ngiu, as well as under the forms nu, nuk, nau, liu. Niu is nyit = ngu. Now it is an interesting fact, upon which Dr. Jensen has laid special emphasis, that initial g is often nasalized in Accadian, e.g., galu, \"man\" is, strictly speaking, ngalu. This seems to prove the identity of Accadian gu (ngu) with Chinese niu {nyu). gid, gidda, again, is the Accadian for Ass. arku, \"long,\" nasdhu, \"to remove,\" elipu, \"to last long,\" etc. This seems to answer to the Chinese yii, \"vague,\" \"vast,\" \"distant,\" which, like the Accadian and Assyrian terms, is used of both time and place (yii kiu, \"a very long time\"), gab (patdru), \"to loose,\" \" free,\" answers to yii, \" loose,\" \" free.\" Chinese regularly drops the final consonants k, p, t (=g, b, d) ; but among the old sounds of the words just mentioned, Dr. Williams gives ngop, ngot, which might represent the Accadian gab (ngab) and gid (ngid). The Accadian has another gab, meaning irtu, \"breast.\" The Chinese yi\\ \" breast,\" is placed under a root YIH, with the old forms yik, yit, yip, ngik, etc. Thus gib (= gab) would seem to have been the original Chinese term for \"breast.\" Under the same root we find yV, \"strong,\" \"tall,\" which may be the counterpart of git, GID, \"long.\" It is to be borne in mind that the Accadian signs for gap, git, would be the same as for gab, gid. Under the same heading YU, we find yii, \"to speak,\" \"say\"; yii \"to talk with,\" \"tell,\" \"inform,*' \"words,\" which are clearly doubles of the Accadian gu, \"to speak,\" and_)Vi, \" sick,\" \" weak \" ; yii, \" to be cured,\" \" disease \" ; yii, \" a cry of pain \" ;yii, \" sorrowful,\" \"grieved at,\" answering again to Accadian gig, \"sick,\" \"sorrowful\" (cf. yok, i.e., gug, one of the old sounds o( yii). We have not yet done with the Chinese yii. It is a curious fact that, just as in Accadian, we find two similar vocables gul (li>/i?u() and gul (hadu), with the opposite meanings of \"bad\" and \"glad.\" so in Chinese we find yii, \"sorrowful,\" and yii, \"joyful,\" \"happy.\" Yii, \" fat,\" \" rich,\" \" fertile \" (of soil), and yii', \" rich (in clothes and chattels),\" \"plenty,\" \"to enrich,\" remind one of the Accadian g'&, \"abundance\" (cp. nam-g'k, duhdu, g'e-gal, hegallu, cl-nun, nuhsii); and I think that g'al, \"to flow,\" g'al-g'al (gardru Sa mi), \"to run,\" said of water, may be connected with these words; compare the Chinese yii, \"to rain.\" The Chinese yii, \"to walk, rapidly,\" may answer to g'al g'al, gardru, though iti s perhaps rather 7 Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHEOLOGY. [1889. related to gin, \"to walk.\" There is also gur, \"to rush,\" \"flow,\" \"run,\" \"hasten,\" and gur, \"ocean,\" which answer very well to yii ; for (1) Chinese has lost the letter r, and (2) Accadian itself often omits it as a final consonant ; cp. ga = gar, \" to make\" ; tu = tur, \" to enter \" ; ga = gur, \" to lift.\" The Chinese roots YU, YIH, appear to be ultimately one. Thus it is that we find yi\\ \" to pour out,\" and yi', \"damp,\" \"wet,\" and yi', \"very large,\" \"great,\" \"abundant,\" and yi\\ \"happy,\" \"jovial,\" \"to like,\" \"rejoice in,\" arranged under the latter, showing that it is in many respects synonymous with the former. The old sounds yik, yit, yip, ngik, point to the same fact, and the Accadian g'e, \" abundance,\" g'al, \" to flow,\" may be as well explained by these terms as by the derivatives of YU. And not only so ; under the heading YIH -we find also yi', \"the throat,\" \"organs of eating and speaking,\" in Cantonese \"to call after,\" \" scold,\" yi\\ \"to explain,\" \" interpret between parties,\" plainly answering to the Accadian gu (kisddu), \"the neck,\" gu, \"to speak\" and \"interpret\" (ragdmu, cp. targumannu, \"interpreter,\" \"dragoman\"). Then, too, we have yi', \"black,\" yi\\ \"mists and vapours,\" answering to Accadian ge, \"night,\" gig, \"darkness,\" \"shadow,\" and yi', \"plague,\" \"epidemic sickness,\" yi\\ \"disquieted,\" \"sorrowful,\" answering to the Accadian gig, \"sick,\" \"sickness.\" The ideas of dark (tristis, ater, \"Hp, etc.), sick, sorrowful, are naturally expressed by similar sounds. Now, as in Accadian we meet with synonymous forms like Gi and gin, ti and tin, so in Chinese we find the root YIN (old sounds yin, yim, ngin) with various meanings akin to those of YU and YIH. Thus we have yin, \"a shadow,\" \"dark,\" \"sombre,\" i.e., gin, cp. Accadian GE, gig ; yin, \"mournful,\" \"sorry,\" cp. Accadian gig; yin, \"full,\" \"flourishing,\" \"abundant,\" \"many,\"^. Accadian G't;yin, \"rising of waters,\" \"to soak,\" \"to drench,\" \"extraordinary,\" \"excessive,\" and yin, \"a long and drenching rain,\" cp. Accadian g'al and g'e. Further, we have yin, \"news,\" \"a reply,\" \"an intimation or order,\" corres- ponding to the Accadian gin (gen), sctparn, \"to send,\" taru, \"to return,\" gi, gigi, \"to return,\" apalu, \"to answer,\" kin (gin), sipru, \"a message,\" \"order,\" \"commission.\" The Accadian gam, \"to bend,\" \" bow \" (beugen, biegen), may be compared with gin, \" to bow, bend, turn, return,\" which is written with the ideogram of reed or bulrush, and the Chinese 'yin, \"to draw a bow,\" \"to lead on,\" which is homophonous with 'yin (Ace. gin), \" to journey,\" may be compared with both. The Accadian has several words with Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS.

The fact that gud is the term for \" bull,\" is suggestive in this connection, considering the widespread association between the sun-god and the bull.t ZAGIN, ibbn, ellu, seems to be a compound of za, which we see also in za-bar, namru, \"shining,\" siparru, \"copper,\" and gin, gi, \"bright,\" \"glistening,\" which occurs in gi-bil (older bil-gi), \"the fire-god.\" bil or pil is qahi, \" to burn,\" and isatu, \" fire.\" gi (dialectic di or de) means namdru, \"to shine,\" and qalu, \"to burn.\" In regard to na zagin = uknu, it is curious that yii, \"beautiful,\" \"precious,\" is also an old name of \"clear white jade,\" and ordinarily means \"gem,\" while yii is defined as \"a beautiful stone like jasper,\" and another yii as \"a pebble with stripes and colouring, which make it almost as valuable as a gem.\" Seals were sometimes made of na ZAGIN, and yiri is a seal. (See also below, p. 30.) The Accadian gi, \"a * babbar (= bar-bar) is defined by />isu, \"white.\" Poh kin, \"white gold,\" is a Chinese designation of silver. t In Gudibir bir = bar, as in Zimbir (for Zubar) from zabar ; the change being due to vowel-harmony. As bar may mean \" bright,\" gudibir is perhaps \" brightness of the sun.\" The names of the metals involve the sound »Y- \" liar.\" »->-Y >Y-, \"iron,\" is, perhaps, \"metal of the sky,\" being named from the meteoric iron, which probably gave men their first knowledge of this metal.

Yu\\ \"to drive (i.e., grasp the reins), \"manage,\" \"rule\"; \"imperial,\" \"royal\" (old sounds ngo, ngop, etc.), seems to be cognate. With gun, \"to shine,\" gun-ni, \"an oven\" or \"furnace,\" the Chinese yang, \" to roast,\" a term used of cooking, and also of melting metals, is seen to be related when we notice that the old sound was yung, which points to an original gun {cp. Amoy j'ong, giong, Fuhchau ngibng). From the same root springs yang, \" the rising sun,\" yang, \" lofty,\" \" clear,\" \"sunny light,\" yang, \"the male of animals,\" \"virility,\" corresponding to Ace. gi-s, gi, zikaru, \"male,\" and gis, idlu, \"hero\" (?). ' Gis, \"heaven,\" and gir-ra (gira), \"heaven,\" are akin to gus and gar, \"to shine,\" and may be connected with the same Chinese roots. One of the meanings of yil is \" the canopy of heaven.\" ga, gur, \"to lift,\" gu, \"lifted up,\" seem to find analogues in yin (old sound ngin), \" lofty and mountainous,\" yin, \"high cliffs,\" yin, \"rising of waters,\" \"excessive,\" \" great,\" yin, \"to raise a bank,\" etc. I have already pointed out that gis, \" one,\" answers to yih, \"one,\" and that gis (gSs), \"strong drink,\" answers to yii. Finally, Gis, isu, \" wood,\" which has the dialectic forms mis and mu, corresponds to the Chinese muh, \" wood,\" older i/utk. The same apparent exception to the rule seems to exist in the case of a word for \" eye,\" which in Chinese is also muh, but in the Accadian igi, with a dialectic form ide. The Chinese yen or yien, \"the eye,\" old sound yin, ngin, in Cantonese ngan, Amoy gan, Shanghai ngi-\", exactly corresponds to the Accadian igi (igin). The Accadian im-ma (ima, im) silmu, \"thirst,\" appears to correspond with 'yin, \"to drink,\" Cantonese yam, Amoy im. The original form was probably gim. The goddess Zirpanitu was called gas-mu in Accadian, which perhaps means the same thing as her Assyrian title ; cp. Cochin Chinese giou, semen, genus, gieo, seminare ; mou, germen ; mo (Mandarin mu), amare. (In Mandarin, jv/' is \" to long for,\" \" desire,\" and also \" to bear and bring up children.\")* The word gukkal, from which is borrowed the Assyrian gukkallu, is supposed to mean \"sheep.\" In that case, it may be compared with yang (old form yung, implying gun or gug), a \"sheep\" or \"goat.\" Dingira, \"god,\" with its Assyrianized form digirft, may be a compound of Di namaru, \" to shine,\" and gira, \" heaven \" (di-hgira ; cp. KINGIRA = * As Accadian mu = naddnu, \"to give,\" gasMU may be \"seed-giver.\" 10 Nov. s] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. ana-kia = same u irsitum. kingira is plainly ki + ngira). The Accadian for \"god,\" therefore, is \"shining one of heaven,\" which explains why the ideogram is a star (>->-], orig. ^-).

[1889. Is it quite presumptuous on the part of a mere believer in Accadian, to set over against these the Chinese equations : liao = \"to finish,\" \"vollenden,\" \"fulfil.\" liu = \"to flow\"; 'lao, \"heavy rain,\" \"overflow produced thereby\"; lao', \"a torrent,\" \"floods.\" liao = \"to measure.\" 'lao = \"old;\" lei, \"feeble,\" \"infirm.\" lei = \"to join in a series\"; \" to place on,\" \"add to\"; \"to bind.\" lo', le = \"a bridle,\" \"the reins,\" \"whatever binds the head by which to lead the animal,\" \"to rein in,\" \"restrain,\" \"tie up,\" \"bind.\" lieh' = \"a sewer obstructed, and its waters forcing a passage.\" lao = \"to know certainly\"; lai, \"to glance at\"; lan, \"to inspect,\" \"behold from a distance\"; lo (la), \"to look about.\" li = \" bright \"= lan ; LAN, \" fire \"= lang. lao = \"to search or drag\" (for a body); lao yu, \"to scoop out fish, with a dredging net.\" lai = \"to bring,\" \"to get\"; lan, \"to carry\"; leu, \"a loft.\" la =. \"toseize\"; lai, \"toget\"; lan, \"to grasp\"; lo, \" to take.\" lan = \"a two-leaved clasping-net, for fish\"; lo (old sound la), \"a spring-net for birds.\" lei = \" to mutually destroy, as in fighting\"; li, \"to oppose.\" lao = \"a great rain.\" lao = \" confused,\" \"perturbed.\" lei == \"to pile up\"; \"aheap.\" lan = \" to overstep,\" \"pass over.\" As R and L interchange, ra = rahasit, \"to flood,\" may also be compared with 'lao, \"heavy rain\" (= ri/jsu), and ir, \"to weep,\" \"a tear,\" with lei, \"tears,\" \"to weep.\" But I will venture further with these comparisons. In Accadian we have a word labar, \"old,\" from which is derived the Assyrian labaru, \"to be old.\" There is also another labar defined ardu, \" servant \" (dialectic lagar). Now- whatever may be the force of bar in these two terms, I cannot help seeing a likeness between them and the Chinese lao, \"old,\" and lao, \"to toil,\" \"to labour.\" Accadian dissyllables appear generally as monosyllables in Chinese. x3 Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHEOLOGY. [1889. It is evident that all these various meanings of lal admit of reduction to a few general heads ; but that is a process which may be left to the reader to carry out, if he pleases. I regard lal as an instance of the extension of a root by reduplication = la + la, whence the Assyrian lalu, lulu, \"abundance.\" In both Accadian and Chinese the root is preserved in its simplest form la, which in Accadian means \" fullness \" or \" abundance,\" and in Chinese \" un- even,\" \"piled up,\" as a heap. The development of the root in Accadian is, as usual, far more restricted than in Chinese. If now we look back upon the terms with which we started, we shall perhaps see that the Chinese and Accadian words which happened first to excite my curiosity, are really connected in their original forms. The word a-a or ai, \"father,\" appeared to bear some relation to the Chinese ye. The term is honorific, and is used in addressing divinities, officers, noblemen, princes, and gentle- men. Tien lao ye is \"the highest god, whoever he may be, the Ruler of the sky\" (heaven + old man + father). The old sounds of ye in its various senses are ya, yap, yat, yak. In four of the dialects ya is still spoken ; a vocalization which brings the Chinese and Accadian terms closer together. I think it probable that ga was the original term. Now ga (dial, ma) means \" to make \" (cp. Assyrian banuya, \" my maker \" = my father), and }], a, is defined by ban/}. As regards a-a or ai, \" the moon,\" Chinese yue/i, the old sounds given for the Chinese character are nget and yet. I had decided that Mandarin y stands in place of an ancient g (tig) before ever seeing William's Dictionary, which so strikingly corroborates that opinion. The other dialects support an initial g in this instance, e.g., Swatow gue, Amoy goat. Now if gud were the ancient word, we are reminded of the Accadian g'ud, \"to be bright\"; cp. Cantonese id. The spirant g' of Accadian points back to an older surd G, which brings us to gud, gu, \" cow \" ; about the relation of which animal to the moon in mythology I need say nothing. Our next pair of terms was a, \"hand,\" \"side,\" andyz/, \"hand.\" Wells Williams gives the Chinese word as yiu' (Shanghai yii). A homophone is yiu\\ \"the right hand,\" \"on the right.\" The old sounds of YIU include ot and at. The Accadian word is written with a character whose syllabic value is it, id. Possibly, therefore, the original word was gad, which gives us the other value of ^f, SIT, viz., kat (gad), from which springs the Assyrian qatu, \"hand.\" The last pair were the Accadian a, \"son,\" and yiu, \"young,\" 14 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. \"tender.\" With these we may conveniently take a = w// = \" water.\" The Chinese for water is shui; but under the same heading YIU, we find i'///', \"hand,\";'///', \"young,\" and yiu, \"to go on the water,\" yiu as part of the name of several rivers, yiu, \"water flowing along rapidly,\" .yiu, \"oil,\" ^yiu, \"to float,\" \"to swim,\" \"to drift,\" and . yiu as the name of several plants growing in the water. This seems to show that yiu as well as shui once meant simply \" liquid \" or \" water.\" Thus we get fair parallels to the Accadian A=\"hand,\" A = \"son,\" and A. = \" water.\" What may we suppose were the original forms of A (son) and a (water)? The Chinese for river is ho; and under this heading the old sounds ha, ka, ga, are given. In the dialects we find ho and 0, hu and u. The Chifu hwoct suggests an original G. I believe the primitive form to have been ga(d), in the sense of \"to flow\"; cp. Accadian g'al, \"to flow,\" and gur, \"to flow,\" \"to run,\" and ga, \"milk\" (\"that which flows from the breast,\" gab; as Assy- rian sispu), and id (g'id ?), \" a river\" ; cp. Hid-deqel. \"Water\" is a natural and not uncommon metaphor for offspring {cp. Num. xxiv, 7). The initial h of so many modern Chinese words appears as k in the age of the ancient poetry, as is remarked by Dr. Edkins ; and this k often corresponds to an Accadian G. The syllabary presents us with yet another Accadian (|^) a, in the sense of \"dress,\" \"clothing\" (lubsu). The common Chinese term for clothes is /', which is found in all the dialects, and may represent an original a. Let us now look at the dental t, d. The Accadian for \"to hear,\" \"listen,\" is gis-tug (dialectic mus-tug), Shnu, magdru. The Chinese fing, \"to hear,\" \"listen\" (old sounds, t'ing and ding\\ answers to this as kin, \"gold,\" answers to gus-kin, and as tsiit, \"wine,\" to ges-tin (din). The nasalisation of the final G is not remarkable, and may have been heard in the Accadian itself. In the case of shut syllables, the initial consonant is generally indeterminate in Accadian (tin-din, kar-gar tab-dib). The GiS in gistug means \" ear \" ; cp. the dialectic ^ = ge = uznu, \" ear,\" = \"TT-^ GI = GU (*M^) > and as TUK (tug) is \" to have and hold,\" gistug =2 \"to have or hold ear.\" Til, dialectic tin, and ti, are familiar Accadian terms, denoting balatu, \"to live.\" I did not at once succeed in my endeavour to identify them in Chinese. But when I remembered that TU was Accadian for \" the wind \" (saru), and that in most languages terms denoting \"wind,\" \"breath,\" and \"life\" or \"spirit,\" were akin to IS Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHEOLOGY. [1889. each other, I had no difficulty in recognising the Accadian tin in the Chinese fun, \"the breath\"; cp. fun, \"to swallow\" (old sound t'un ; Amoy tun, t'ui); t'ien, \"the sky,\" \"the air\" (old sound t'in, t'im, din, dim). With tu, \"the wind,\" cp. fui, \"a rapid gust of wind,\" \"a whirlwind.\" Dub in Accadian is a tablet for writing upon, or a written document (= Assyrian duppu, a loan-word, of course), and dub-sar is the scribe who writes such tablets (Assyrian dupsarru, IDGIS)- The word reveals itself at once in Chinese as tie, \" tablets for writing on \" ; \" records of families \" ; \" official despatches,\" etc. ; old sound, dip ; the Cantonese tip. With Swatow and Amoy tiap, cp. Tal. Ty\\. (Sar, satdru, to write \" = Chinese sie, \"to write.\") In the syllabary the sign J^Hf! , with the sound dub, is repeated six times, with the Assyyian meanings tuppu, \" tablet \" (the / is interesting in the light of the Chinese tie, tip) ; sapaku, \" to pour out,\" \" heap up earth,\" used of raising mounds and earthworks ; tabaku, \" to pour a libation,\" \" saraqu, \"to empty,\" sibu, \"to dip,\" and lamu, \" to surround \" (a city with a wall, or an investing force). It is surely very remarkable that in Chinese we have tie (tip), \"a high hillock,\" tieh, \"jutting,\" \"anything above the surface,\" tie, \"to surround with a parapet or breastwork,\" and, as sapaku is also used of buildings falling into heaps of ruin (issapik tilanis I) ; tie, \"to fall down.\" All these Chinese terms are grouped under tieh (old sounds, dit, dip, and tip), along with tie, \"tablets for writing on.\" {Cp. Ezek. xxvi, 8; TjQtl? aggessit aggerem, aufschiitten ; Isa. lvii, 6, effudit libamen ; Psalm lxxiii, 2, effusus = lapsus est.) Finally, we have Hen, \"to sink into,\" \"overwhelmed in,\" answering to dub = sibu, \" to dip,\" and lien, \" to offer libations,\" \" pour out (a libation \"), as equivalent of tabaku, and saraqu (old sounds tin, ti'm, dien). For the remaining ^Jlfff, pronounced dig' (di-ih) = abnu, I will account presently. I have spoken of tin, \"to live,\" \"life.\" The well known name of Babylon, tin-tir-ki, \" Living + seat + place \" = abode of life ; contains also the element tir. This is not \"wood,\" gis-tir, but is defined subtu (subat balati) ; and we may compare tien, \" a palace,\" or if the literal idea of \"seat\" be insisted upon, tien, a cushion\" (for sitting on), tien \"a fine bamboo mat\"; tun, \"a heap,\" \"a block of stone or wood\"; \"low,\" \"squat,\" e.g., \"low cushions, to sit on.\" Cp. also fun, \"to dwell\" (old sound, tun). 16 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. Di = rfenu or dim/, \"judgment,\" is one of the numerous instances in which it has been supposed to be quite obvious that the Assyrian syllabic value of the ideogram was determined by the Assyrian word. If so, what of the Chinese //', to judge,\" \"to decide between,\" which is found in all the dialects, and to which the old sounds te, de, etc., are assigned ? In this, as in former instances, cognate roots supply abundant comparisons. Thus we have Hen (old sounds, tin, tim, dien), pronounced at Shanghai tin, din, meaning \"a canon,\" \"standard,\" or \"ritual\"; a \"statute,\" or \"code\"; \"a law\"; \"ordinances,\" etc. ; ting, \"to decide,\" \"adjust fully, \"determine,\" \"arrange,\" etc. (old sounds, ting, ding). It would seem that the Accadian form was din originally, unless we prefer to see in these variants the growth of new stems from the simplest form of the root. Then there is twan (old sounds, twan, dwan), pronounced tiin at Canton, and in Chifu tan, \"to cut asunder,\" \"divide,\" \"settle,\" \"give a judicial opinion,\" \"a de- cision.\" Cp. also fo, to \" split wood \" (old sounds, t'a, t'ap, da, dip) ; to, \" to mince,\" \" carve,\" \" cut in two \" (old sounds, ta, tap, etc.). That verbs of cutting are used of giving legal decisions needs no illus- tration. It is evident in the term ^f^f= »\\r, di-kud, dan?/, \"a judge \" (? da? ami). The second sign in this group, »v-, KUD, is denned by dan//, \"to judge,\" and dinu, \"judgment,\" by ta/u/i, \"to speak,\" \" pronounce \" (a sentence, formula of incantation, or exor- cism, etc.), and by parasu, \"to divide,\" \"break,\" \"decide.\" Read as tar, it is explained by taraku — the Assyrian scribes were naturally fond of selecting, where possible, an Assyrian term that, by its assonance with the Accadian, would serve to assist the memory, — taraku, \" to leave off,\" \"cease,\" and by samu, \"to fix,\" \"appoint,\" \"settle,\" \"determine.\" kud is literally \"to cut off,\" and answers to Chinese ko (old sound, kat), \"to cut in two,\" and ko, \"to examine,\" \"sift thoroughly\"; \"a law\"; cp. Cantonese kot, Amoy gut. AV (old sound, k'ak, k'at) \"to subdue,\" overcome\"; \"exorcise\" (demons), \"prevail over,\" etc., and ko, to carve, \"cut out,\" complete our Chinese parallels. Kb' \"to stop,\" \"leave off,\" and k% \"to strike\" and \"smash,\" prove, if proof were wanted, that kud and TAR wire really synonyms in the Accadian language. Tar, taraku, corre- sponds to Chinese t'ien, \"to terminate,\" \"make to cease,\" \"finish \" (old sounds, t'in, t'im, din, dim), t'ing, \"to rest,\" \"stop,\" \"hold up\"; while tar, samu, \"to appoint,\" \"fix,\" etc., may be compared with tien, \"to rule or manage,\" \"to be directed to,\" \"bent on\"; /ten, \" to preserve,\" \"establish,\" \"fixed;\" tic'//, \"fixed and settled,\" as the 17 c Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY. [18S9. hills and streams; \"to set up,\" \"to consolidate\" (e.g., an empire). The root thus appears to be the same ultimately as that of ni=d&nii (Hen, old sounds, tin, tim, dien ; vid. supr.); cp. also ting (old sounds, ting, ding) \" to order,\" \"firm,\" \"settled\"; \"to secure\"; \"to esta- blish; to decide, adjust finally\"; \"to stop,\" \"to fix,\" \"deter- mine,\" etc. The sign >^- occurs nine successive times in Haupt's Syllabary. We have dealt with six ; now for the remaining three. Pronounced SILA, it is explained to denote sfiqu, \"street\"; salatu, \"to subdue,\" \"overcome,\" \"rule,\" \"act as ruler,\" e.g., \"judge\"; and nakasu, \"to cut off.\" Sila, \"to cut off,\" has its counterparts in sin, \"to cut wood\" (old sound, sin), si (old sound, sik), \"to split wood\"; while sila, salatu answers to sin, sun, \" to investigate,\" \" inquire,\" h'iin, \" to inquire into judicially\"; \"to direct\"; \"announce to\"; and si, \" to distinguish,\" \"discriminate.\" I suppose a \"street\" was called sila, as cutting a town into sections, or dividing the houses. That said?\" meant \"to judge,\" among other things, appears from the rule saltis ul itame ; \"(On the 7th, 14th, 19th, 21st, and 28th days of the month) let not (the king) pronounce a decision as judge\"! Thus an ideogram with three distinct Accadian sounds and nine Assyrian definitions has been accounted for by help of the Chinese Dictionary. If this be chance, then chance is another name for order and method and design. In the Assyrian syllabary we find the character »-£^- tim, dim, occurring four times, and defined by dimmu \"pillar,\" riksu, \"bond,\" \"cord,\" markasu, \"bond\" (metaph.), and rikisqanc, \"bond or band of reed.\" If dim be a genuine vocable, and not an arbitrary sign, dimmu will probably be a loanword. Now dim, \"prop,\" \"pillar,\" may be compared at once with Hen (old sound, tim), \"to steady a thing by patting bricks or other things under it; to shore up; to prop\"; \"to buttress;\" fieri, \"the plinth or base of a pillar\"; ting, \" to sustain,\" \" secure,\" \" establish \" ; fing, \" (door)-posts \" ; fing, \"a portico,\" \"open roof supported on pillars\"; tun (old sounds ton, don), \"a square pillar\" ; \"a plinth or base\"; tung, \"the ridge-pole\" ; \"a main support in a building\"; \"a leading man in a state, a pillar.\" But what of dim, \"a bond\"? It corresponds to fan (old sounds dan, dam), \"a rattan cord or string for binding\" ; t'ang (old sounds, t'eng, deng), \"to bind,\" \"fasten,\" as with ropes; \"cords\"; tao (old sounds, t'o, t'op, t'ok, do, dot, dok), \"a plaited sash\"; \"a band or cord\"; tao, \"to bind up\"; \"a cord.\" I shall have occasion to iS Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. return to this term presently, when I have finished discussing those words in which an Accadian t or d is preserved in Chinese. We have accounted for tu, \"the wind\"; but Accadian also presents tu or tu tu, eribu, \"to go in,\" \"to set\" (of the sun); tu, summatu, a kind of bird; and tu, \"a garment,\" \"dress\" (JEJ). With tu, \"to go in,\" te, \"to approach,\" \" nearness,\" may be con- nected ; for Accadian u and e are closely related vowels, and we find te=\" dress,\" and T¥.=sumuiatu, as well asTU. Tu, \"to go in,\" appears also in the fuller form tur (tur). The Chinese tieh (old sounds, dit, dip, tip), pronounced at Canton tit, tip, in Swatow tint. etc., in Amoy tiat, tiit, etc., furnishes tie, \"to fall down,\" tie, \"the sun beginning to decline towards the west \" ; tie, \" to fall, as a hawk from the sky.\" The Amoy tut almost preserves the old Accadian tutu intact; cp. also t'au, \" to enter \" (old sounds dan, dam) ; ti, \" to bend, incline\" (old sounds, te, de). As to the tu bird or summatu, it is probably not a swallow, but the Chinese tu, the cuckoo, but also the goatsucker or nightjar (see tv, old sounds, to, tot, etc.). The goatsucker, also called chiien, bears another name, indicating the mournful cry which it is fabled to sing all night, till blood comes into its eyes, singing for its mate to hasten home. (Its song in the daytime indicates the time for sowing.) Cp. the phrase of the Accadian penitential hymns: kima tu.g'u (summati) adammum, \" like the Tu bird I mourn.\" Tu, \"clothes,\" which also appears in the earlier form tuk, is of the same origin as tuk, \"to take,\" \"to have\" (tuku = />\"//, ahazu). It is defined by the Assyrian subatu, \"clothes,\" which springs from sabatu, \"to take.\" Cp. Chinese \"teu, \"to lift up,\" \"get hold of,\" \"seize\" (old sounds, tu, du, duk). There is also ti, \"to take,\" an abbreviation of tig (dialetic tim) ; cp. tum, \"to carry off.\" Now under the heading TOH (o\\o\\ sounds, tat, dak, dat), the Chinese lexicon ranges to, \"to take up with both hands,\" to, \"to take by force,\" \"get by striving, or anyhow,\" to, \"to carry off,\" toh, \"to seize,\" \" rob \" ; to, \" to mend clothes \" ; to, \" to let down, drop,\" e.g., a line into a well ; to, a small bird whose cry is ti-ti ; to, \"a species of water-bird like the rail.\" The Chinese TAO (old sounds, to, do, tot, dok), gives tao, \" to arrive at,\" \" reach \" ; cp. Accadian te = dahu\\ aggredi, which also recalls ti (te), \"to butt,\" \"to push,\" \"to reach,\" \"arrive at.\" With tu, \"clothes,\" we may further compare fa, \";i wrapper\" (for the person), (old sounds, tat, tap, etc.), ta, \"to cover,\" 19 c 2 Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCH.EOLOGY.

D, Z, S. It is well known that in Accadian there is a dialectic change from G to d, as in gis, di§, \"one,\" gim and dam, \"like\"; and, again, between d and z, as dug = zib (tsib?), \"good.\" Further, we have the change exemplified in zi (tsi ?) = shi = napistum, \"life.\" It is natural, therefore, to expect to find similar relations between these various sounds in the Chinese. So far, we have seen an Accadian t or d preserved in a Chinese /, /', with an older /, or d. But this is by no means invariable, though many more instances might be added to those I have already given. An Accadian d (t) reappears in modern Chinese sometimes as ch, sometimes as ts, sometimes apparently as softy (French sound); which last may also repre- sent an Accadian z, although it has usually replaced a G (vid. infra). As to the interchange of these letters within Chinese itself, 22 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. Dr. Wells Williams observes that initial ch, ch', and ts, ts', \"are interchanged so much and so irregularly all over the country, that it is impossible to follow their variations. As one goes north, they mingle in a greater or less degree, and many natives cannot tell them apart. At Swatow and Amoy ts is heard doubtfully only before a, 0, and u ; but on reaching Fuhchau it is altogether merged in ch.\" Owing to the great differentiation of the root-stuff in modern Chinese, it will be found that many of the words beginning with / or d, already considered, have doubles with initial ch. Thus the Accadian dim, \"pillar,\" for which we have pointed out a number of Chinese cognates such as tun, tien, etc., also corresponds to chu \"a pillar \" \"post,\" \"joist\"; \"a statesman\" (metaph.). Under chu, as usual, the Chinese lexicon groups a great number of vocables with the most diverse and apparently unconnected meanings. The old sounds given are te, tu, tot, de, du, djot, So, and fot. In Shanghai the sounds are tso, tsii, dzo, tssu, etc. Now chu, \"a trunk,\"' \"bole\" of trees, is used as a general determinative of trees and similar objects; thus answering to Accadian gi-s (dialectic di-s), which is the de- terminative of trees and wooden objects. (One seems to see a reason why | gis = zikaru, \"male.\" It recalls the straight branchless pole or trunk which symbolized the Asherah.) I have already mentioned that iiiuh (muk), \"wood\" answers to the dialectic Accadian iiu (mug?), \"wood.\" Accadian udu, \"lamb,\" is like chu, \"a lamb five months old \" (du) ; cp. ta (old sounds, tat, dat), \" a new- born lamb.\" Chu, \"to make judicial inquiry,\" \"to punish capitally,\" and chu, \"to discriminate,\" \"distinguish,\" answer to Accadian in, \"to judge.\" Then we have chu, \"a stone tablet,\" cp. t'i, \"an inscription \" (dai, dat); tie (dip), \"tablets, records\"; t'ie (t'ip), \"written scrolls,\" cha (old sounds, tat, tap, dap), \"a thin wooden tablet,\" \"writings.\" \"documents.\" Chih (old sounds, tip, tit, tik, dip, and cli't ), \"to apprehend, seize,\" \"lay hold of,\" etc., answers to Accadian dib, \"to seize,\" \"take\"; Amoy chip. DiB is also \"to take the road,\" \"to come,\" and chih is \"to proceed,\" \"to go up,\" and \"to go on.\" Chili is also \"to record events\"; cp. dub; ami chih means \"to tie up or tether\"; \"a cord\"; cp. dim. Chih is a book-wrapper, and a bag used like an envelope ; cp. DIM in dimmenna = thnennu. In Accadian we have du, asdbu, \"to dwell,\" du, suhtu.

The Accadian tum (dum), du, \"to go,\" \" walk,\" answer to /•//, \" a footman \" ; pedes ; \" to go afoot \" (old sound, do) ; in Shanghai, tu and du ; but also to cfro (old sound, t'ok), \" to walk fast\"; chlo, \"to stamp\"; chih, \"to proceed\"; c/ii/i, \"the sole of the foot\"; chih, \"to tread\"; chu, \"to walk sedately (dok); chui, \"to follow\" (old sounds, ti, tui, tut, etc.). The Accadian gir, \"foot\" and \"step,\" may be related, through the known interchange of g and d in that language. Du, \"to make, build,\" and du, \"to make bricks,\" may be compared with chu (old sounds, tok, dok), in Shanghai tsbk and dzbk, Swatow tek, etc., Fuhchau titiik, tiik, \" to build\"; dim, \"to beget,\" \"to make\" {Ixtnu, H2D, \"to build\"), and du, dumu, \"child,\" are cognate; cp. chlu \"to spring from,\" and \"to beget\" (old sounds, t'ot, t'uk, implying dug) ; chUi, \"to rear,\" \"to breed\"; ch'an, \"to produce,\" \"breed,\" \"bear\" (old sounds, dam, shan, tsim) ; chan (old sounds, tin, tim, dim), \"to mould,\" \"fashion,\" \" make like.\" With 1% \" to approach,\" attack,\" cp. chu, ch'u, \" to butt,\" \"run against,\" \"oppose\" (tut, tuk). Dug, \"a command,\" and \"to speak,\" is chu, \"to bid,\" \"order\" (old sounds, tok, dok); chui, \" talk \" (tui, tut, dut) ; chan, \" to talk and gabble \" (old sounds, tam, dam). Tu, \"the wind,\" answers to ch'ut, \"to blow,\" \"puff,\" \"a puff,\" \"blast,\" \"gust\" (old sounds, t'i, t'ui, t'ut, di, etc.). Dugud (dialectic gid, gidda), \"heavy,\" is chung (old sounds, tong, dong, presupposing dug) ; in Amoy, tibng, Shanghai, tsung. Chung is also \"rectitude,\" \"sincerity,\" \"goodness,\" and dug is \"good.\" With dugud, in the sense of \" mighty,\" cp. chlung (dong, dzong), \"high,\" \"noble,\" \"to reverence.\" Chung, \"a cup,\" goes back to Accadian duk, \"vessel,\" \"cup\"; chwang (old sound, dung), \"strong,\" to Accadian dun, dan. Di, dim (d£, d£m), \"to irrigate,\" \"irrigation,\" answer to ch'ih, \"to drink\"; chan (old sounds, tam, dam), Chifu, Isan, \"to immerse,\" \"to steep,\" \"to moisten\"; chan, \"to dip\" {cp. dub); chan (dim), \"to pour,\" \"empty out.\" (The term also means \"to deliberate,\" \"adjust\" — Accadian di, and \"to twist a cord around,\" \"to bind \" = Accadian dim.) Chan, \"a likeness\" or \"portrait,\" and chan, \"to make like,\" recall Accadian dim, \"like,\" \"as,\" which is related to dim, banu. The 24 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. Accadian di (din), \"judgment,\" may further be compared with chlan (old sound, din), \"to arrange,\" \"set in regular order.\" DAGAL (dialectic damal), \"broad,\" \" wide,\" \"to extend,\" etc., is a compound of da, \"broad,\" and gal (mal),/////, \"to open.\" We see da in cha (old sounds, ta, da), \"to open out,\" \"stretch open\"; cha, \"to widen out, \" expand,\" and other terms. With gal cp. yao, \"extensive,\" as a plain ; yao, \" boundless,\" like the ocean. So far Accadian d = Chinese ch. Let us now look at z. The syllabary gives six occurences of *-fyV% z*d, zi, with the definitions imnu, \"right hand,\" \"right,\" \"straight\"; kcitu, \"right,\" \"fixed,\" \"lawful,\" \"just,\" etc.; zigga, tebii, \"to come on,\" \"approach,\" \"attack\"; 71asa.hu, \"to pluck up,\" \"rend away,\" \"depart\" (nD3)j napistu, \"life,\" and nissu, \"spirit.\" The term zi, \"life,\" was pronounced shi in the other dialect of the Accadian ; and this being the fact, what could be more striking than that shi means \" life \" in Chinese ? Nothing, except perhaps the fact that another shi is \"to go to,\" \"approach \" ; another is \"to depart\"; another means \"direct,\" \"straight\"; another \"right,\" \"proper.\" Yet another shi means \"to swear,\" \"adjure,\" which recalls the well- known formula of the magical tablets, z\\ anna ge-pad-es, zi kia ge-pad-es. We also have zi, saqu, \"leader,\" and zi, nasii, \"to lift up.\" These terms have their fellows in s/ii, \"a leader,\" \"a general,\" shi, \"an officer,\" and shi, \"to set up\" (poles or trees, a flagstaff, etc.), \"erect,\" \"lofty.\" In the same place we have tig, with the definition ilu sa naphari, \"God of the universe,\" cp. Chinese //, \"a god,\" and perhaps Shang-ti, \" the Supreme ruler.\" This Chinese shi had the old sounds shai, shi, zhi (Accadian zi), shik. shit, zhit (cp. Accadian zit, zid), and zhik {cp, Accadian zigga). In the dialects ch'i is heard as well as shi. But, further, under the heading shi, the first two Chinese terms are shi, \"a corpse,\" and shi, \"a carcase.\" Does anything correspond in the Accadian ? It would seem so, for we have su-zi = salummatum^ \"body,\" \"corpse\" (su means \"body,\" \"skin,\" and \"flesh \"). May not dumuzi, \"Tammuz,\" be \"the slain or dead son,\" rather than \"son of life\"? The Chinese sz\\ or as Professor Douglas writes it, ssu, \"to die,\" \"death\" (old sounds, si, sei, sai, zi, etc.), is similar. The contrary meanings of shi, \"life,\" and \"a corpse,\" may remind us that in ancient Egypt the dead were par excellence \"the living.\" (Cp. also sha/i, old sounds, shim, shin, zhim, \"the trunk,\" \"body\"; shan, \"the powers above,\" \"the gods.\" \"a spirit,\" \" the human spirit,\" \"ancestral spirits.\") In Accadian we 25 Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHAEOLOGY. [1889. have also shum, tabd.hu, \"to slaughter\"; cp. Chinese s/iu, \"to kill\" (old sounds, sho, zho, shiu), and shai:, \"to cut off\"; cp. Chinese s/ia/i, \" to slay\" (old sounds, shat, shap). The Accadian shu = kissatu, \"multitude\" = Chinese shu, \"a multitude,\" \"all,\" \"the whole,\" \"a great number\" (shud?) Under the same head we have shit, \"open,\" \"wide apart\"; \"distant in space or time,\" etc. = Accadian shud, \"distant\"; shu, \"to overturn \" = Accadian, shu, \"to throw to the ground\" (cp. shu, \"to slaughter,\" \"exterminate); shu, \"to pour out \" = Accadian shub, \"to pour out,\" \"sprinkle\" (= Accadian shib) ; shu, \"millet\" == Accadian she, \"grain\"; shu, \"bright,\" \"the light of the rising sun,\" \"clear\" = sha, shaga, \"pure,\" \"purified\"; and shu, \"benevolent,\" u benignant \" = sha, shaga, \"favour,\" \"grace.\" The Accadian shur (dialectic shir, sher), \"to cry aloud,\" \"an outcry,\" recalls shang (old sound, shing, i.e., shig?), \"a sound,\" \"a cry,\" \"a wail.\" Shit, \"a number,\" \"to count\" — sho, \"to count\" (given under sheh, old sounds, shet, zhet, ship, and shak), used of divination by straws. Sheg, \"to rain,\" \"rain\"; cp. shah (old sound, shap), \"a slight shower,\" \"a passing rain\"; sha, sa (old sound, shak), \"to sprinkle,\" \"wet\" with rain, \"rain\"; shan, \"a slight rain\"; shao (shok), \"water driven by the wind,\" \"to sprinkle.\" Shib, shub, \"to sprinkle,\" are clearly related words. Sheu (old sounds, shu, shut, zhu, and shuk), gives us sheu, \"to receive,\" and sheu, \"the arm,\" \"the hand\"; cp. Accadian shu, \"the hand,\" \"might\"; also sheu, \"the head,\" \"a chief, a leader\"; cp. si-lig, \"leader\" (////, old sound, lik, Cantonese lik, means \"strength\"; cp. Accadian lig, \"strong\"). With sheu, \"the head,\" cp. also zag, resu, \"head.\" Shan, \"mountain,\" \"height\" (old sound, shan), seems to answer to g'ar-sag, \" mountain \" ; cp. Amoy, sail, Fuhchau, sang, Chifu, sau. Shaug, \"top,\" \"above,\" \"heaven \"(old sound, zhung), may be compared with zag, sag, \" head \" ; cp. the Swatow, siang, Amoy, sioug. Shi'/i, \"a stone,\" \"hard\" (old sound, ship, shek, etc.), Recalls sheg and sheb, \"brick,\" which sometimes has \"stone\" as a determinative before it, and za, \"stone,\" and dig (ahuii), \"a stone.\" One of the commonest of Accadian roots is zu, \"to know,\" \"know- ledge,\" \" wisdom,\" of which an older form is za. Zu is explained by idu and lamadu, \"to see\" (mentally), \"to know\" (in pael, uddu, \"to let see,\" \"show\"), and \"to learn.\" It corresponds to shi, \"to 26 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS.

The common Chinese term for \" to know,\" \" to perceive\" (also \"to tell,\" \"inform\") is chi (old sounds, tai dai, ti), pronounced in Swatow as ti, but at Shanghai as tsz\\ This implies a dialectic Accadian term related to zu, as dug to zib. Now we actually have dug, \"to speak,\" answering to chi, \"to tell.\" The term ab-zu, older form zu-ab, Assyrianized as apsu, and meaning \" ocean,\" is probably not \" house of wisdom,\" but \" house of water,\" * Chinese shui \" water \" (old sound, zhui) ; cp. shun, cfrun, (old sounds, zhon, shon, don, zhun, dun), \"to cleanse,\" \"wash,\" \"sprinkle\"; Accadian shun, \"to wash\";| shwan, old sound, shon, \"to wash,\" \" rinse \" ; shwan, \" to scour and wash out \" ; and ses, \" to purify.\" sukkal, \" high servant,\" \"messenger,\" maybe compared with shi, \"to command,\" \"to send,\" \"service\"; shi, \"following,\" as an attendant (old sound, shik). Kal is \" exalted,\" \" mighty,\" Chinese kao, \"high.\" The sign £^£zf, which is the ideogram for \"fire,\" has the values ne, de, pi, pit, kum, zah, izi, gibil.

Initial B is, however, preserved in certain cases enumerated by the old lexicographers as ancient sounds of the characters ; as also in the dialects, to a certain extent. One of the first words that meet us in the Accadian syllabary is •-i^y^, bal. This term has a great variety of meanings assigned to it by the Assyrian scribes ; and it struck me that it might very well be taken as a test-term for my theory of the relation of the language to the Chinese.

With bal, \"to rebel,\" we might also compare poh, \" to mislead by fair speeches,\" \" to stir up rebellion by seducing talk,\" \"obstinate,\" disorderly,\" \"perverse\"; and so in other in- stances. The truth is that the development of the root in Chinese is far more elaborate than in Accadian, as will be seen from the following, which presents at a glance all the secondary roots or outgrowths springing from the primary pa : — 14. bal, Saqfi, \"to irrigate.\" 15. bal, pilakku, \"an ax. 16. bal, pilakku, \" a spindle.\" 17. bal, ussatu, \"trouble,\" \" vexation \" (ussat libbisu). 18. bal, naqu, \"to pour a liba- tion.\" 19. bal, tabaku, \"to pour out.\" pa (old sounds, pa, pak, pat). p'a (p'a pat, p'ak, ba, bat). pah (old sounds, pat, bat). pai (pa, pat, ba, bat). p'ai (ba, bat, p'a, p'at). pan (pan and ban). p'an, (p'an, ban). pan (pen, ben). p'an (ben p'en). pang (pong, bong). 36 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS.

The above are all the sounds grouped under the letter P in the Chinese dictionary. The forms given in brackets as old sounds do not carry us farther back than J200 years. It will be noticed that they all terminate either in a vowel, or in one of the tenues, k, t, p, or in one of the liquids m, n, or, finally, in the nasal ng. Neither r nor / appears in this position. In Accadian, on the other hand, both appear as finals. Corresponding to the above sounds, in Accadian we have the following list : ba, bi, bu, bad, bal, bil (pil), bulug', 'bam, ban, bar, bur, bis (pes) \\ that is about a third of the Chinese number of sounds. (It happens that none of these roots ends in B, like gab.) Thus we see that the Accadian series answeis to the Chinese, in so far as it has for final sounds either vowels or the medials b, g, d, or the liquids m, n. Final l, r, s, have dis- appeared from Chinese ; while Accadian has no special mode of marking a nasalized final letter. Under each of the Chinese sounds, pa, p'a, pah, etc., we find a number of different characters, with diverse meanings. All or nearly all under pa are sounded pa, but a distinction is made by means of the accents or tones, which play so important a part in the language. Considering the great number of meanings which we find grouped together under some Accadian signs, we may think it probable that a similar device obtained in that language also, at the time when it was still spoken, although no diacritic marks indicative of tonal 37 Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCILEOLOGY [1S89. differences existed or were put on record by the Assyrian scribes. But Accadian availed itself freely of another expedient which is foreign to the Chinese. The same character was used to signify quite different sounds (>~< = bat, be, til, mid, etc.), whereas in Chinese every distinct sound has a character all to itself. And some- times we find the same Accadian syllable represented by different characters, e.g. >~< and >J^<y are both bad. As regards meanings, the same or similar notions are repeated under each sound of the Chinese series ; throughout the whole, the changes are rung, as it were, upon one or two leading ideas. Over and over again we encounter variations of the ideas of splitting, opening, striking, bursting forth, rushing, running, shining, which are all plainly reducible to one or two principal notions. The same thing is observable in the Accadian series. If ba is \" the opening of the mouth,\" bi is \" to speak,\" and so is pad, and so is bal ; if bad is \" to open,\" so is bar. This correspondence in mechanism is surely remarkable ; and would probably be more so, if we had the com- plete series of Accadian sounds, instead of only a part of it. Let us now proceed to compare the two series, so far as possible. Ba has the meanings qasu, \"to give\"; azazu, \"to be angry,\" \"enraged\"; nas&ru, \"to tremble, shake, fall\" ()Aj), \"to throw down,\" \"overthrow\"; and/////, \"opening of the mouth.\" In Chinese, // and pei are \"to give,\" and ping is \"to invite with a present,\" and pan is \"to confer rewards (on soldiers).\" Pi is \"great and robust,\" \"angry\"; p'ie/i, \"to be soon angry\"; p'a is \" to fall to the ground,\" po, \" to shake,\" p'a, \" to fear,\" p% \"frightened,\" pien, \"alarmed,\" pu, \"afraid\"; while ka-ba is repre- sented by pa, \"the mouth open,\" pa, \"large mouthed,\"/rt, \"crying and wrangling of infants,\" \" hubbub.\" Ba as a verbal prefix answers to pa as \" a sign of the optative.\" Ba is also a pronoun, suatu, su, \" that,\" \" he, him,\" and// is \" that,\" a demonstrative.

As bi is both singular and plural, so the Chinese// is \"that \" and \"those.\" So na, \"he, his, him,\" = Chinese na, \"that.\" Bi, \"and,\" as in itu-bi ud-mu-bi, arhit ih/iu u sattu, \"month, day and year,\" coincides with pa, \"over,\" \"up- wards,\" \" more,\" \"besides,\" as in shihpa, \"a thousand and more.\" Bi, 33 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS.

Under the same head we have ai, \" beautiful and luxuriant vegetation ; \" much as in Accadian, ana means also \" ear of corn,\" and \" twig or branch \" (sissintiu = D^D-D)- Cp. also ang (old sounds, ngung, yung), \" to rise higher and higher,\" as the sun; ang, \"great,\" \"high\"; ang, \"overflowing\"; ang, ang, \"rich and abundant, like a spring,\" with anu, subultu, J~Oi1!?, \"ear of corn,\" and \"flood\"; yang (old sound, yung), \" lofty, clear, manifest,\" \" heaven \" as opposed to \" earth \" ; yang, \" to look up towards heaven \" ; yen (old sounds, yin, ngin, an), \" clouds rising and spreading\"; yen, \"to overflow,\" \"the margin of a stream\" (subultu); yen, \"a high bank,\" \"lofty,\" \"steep\"; yen, \"a stream flowing far,\" \" long, ample, extended \" ; yen, \" a serene clear sky \" ; yen, \" pitchy black, as the sky, which makes a background for stars\"; yen, \"a spacious covering or shelter\"; yen, \" the sun obscured by clouds,\" \"indistinct,\" \"obscure\"; and yen, \"to cover over, to hide.\" Yen, \"sharp,\" \"pointed,\" reminds one again of anu, subultu, \"an ear of (bearded) wheat,\" spica. I think it probable, therefore, that the original term for \" heaven \" was gan (ngan), a view which 40 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. is favoured by the initial c (rather than I) of !~T^, rC57 ; and that the term meant \" the covering or canopy above the earth \" (cp. the roots pj, \"py, ~ ~~y ~<\"to cover \"). The term was then used, by a natural transfer, to denote \" high,\" \" lofty,\" while Ann, the god, is simply heaven personified, or the zi anna, the Spirit of Heaven. Perhaps, as the canopy of heaven appears concave (cp. yen, \" bell- shaped \"), ears of corn got the same name from their bending and bowing (cp. gin, \"a reed\"). The Accadian gan g'e, \"abundance,\" \"overflow,\" an apparent homophone of (g)an, \"sky,\" seems to connect the two meanings of corn and flood. Of the numerals I have already identified gis, \"one,\" with yih (yit), \"one\"; and \"two,\" tab, with Chinese fa (t'ap). MlN, min-na, \"two,\" may be connected with erh or drh or 'rk, \"two,\" which, strange as it may appear, had formerly the sound of ni. This ni may represent an older mi, as in Accadian itself we find dialectic m for n. So erh, \"ear\" = ni = mi = MU-s, Gi-s, \"ear.\" The Chinese term for \"three\" is san, which seems to answer to Accadian e-sin, \"thirty.\" Sin (San ; cp., Sanherib), the moongod, was symbolized by the number 30. The Chinese sz' or ssn (the root closely approximates to shi), may be akin to the Accadian san, sim, sib, \"four.\" A, ia, \"five,\" goes back to gad, \"the hand\"; cp. Chinese wu, \" five \" = older wot = mot = mat = gat. As, \" six \" = a + a§ = 5 + i== gad + gas = dgas = dyas = lyas = Amoy liok, Mandarin luh (old sound, lok.) Gispu, \"ten\" (gisip) = Chinese shih, \"ten\" (old sound, ship). As-tan means, I think, \"one only\"; cp. tan, \" single,\" \"alone\" (old sound, tan). \" His army was in three corps,\" san tan ; tan being added to the numeral as in Accadian. Exceptio probat regula/n. The Mandarin speech has an initial / sound (zh ; the French sound, as in Juge), which, after several false starts, I determined to represent an Accadian G (ng). How was this result to be reconciled with the rule that Accadian G = Chinese jy? The old forms and the dialects supplied the answer. Strange as it may appear, the old sound of jan (pronounced zhun) was actually nien, that is, nyen, that is ngin, so that this term is no real exception to the rule (cp. Fuhchau ybng, yaig, and Chifu yen). Under J, the Chinese Lexicon groups sixteen principal sounds, Viz., JAN, JAN, JANG, JANG, JAO, JE, JEH, JEU, JOH, JU, JUH, JUI, JUN, JUNG, JWA, JWAN.

Few Biblical plant-names have given rise to more discussion than the tappuakh, rendered \"apple\" in our Version; there is some difficulty in selecting any fruit-tree which will answer all the Biblical requirements. The Hebrew word occurs in Cant, ii, 3, \" as the tappuakh among the trees of the thicket (\"iy ) yd'ar, so is my beloved among the sons ; I rejoiced and sat down under its shadow, and its fruit was pleasant (piJlD) wathok to my palate;\" in Cant ii, 5, the Shulamite says, \"Sustain ye me with raisin-cakes (fntZ^ipN) ashishoth, refresh me with tappukhl/u, for sick with love am I;\" in vii, 8, Solomon is represented as saying to the Shulamite, \" May the smell of thy breath be like tappukhlmP In Cant, viii, 5, the Shulamite says, \" under the tappuakh I aroused thee ; there thy mother was in travail with thee . . . and brought thee forth.\" The tappuakh is mentioned in Joel i, 12, with other trees injured by locusts; and in Prov. xxv, n, we read that \"a word fitly spoken is like golden tappukhl/n in silver baskets.\" The Biblical requirements, I think, may be reduced to two only, viz. : that the fruit should be pleasant to the palate, and possess a sweet odour ; it is not necessary to discover a tree which would afford any considerable amount of shade ; the tappuakh was far superior to other trees, and \"to sit under the shade \" may denote nothing more than \" under its branches.\" The expression of golden \" apples \" in silver baskets mentioned above, does not, I imagine, allude to the bright pale foliage of any tree con- trasted with its golden fruit ; but to such fruit in manufactured silver filigree work (iTDtft?) maskith. The citron, the quince, the apple, and the apricot have each been suggested as the tree denoted by the tappuakh. The claim of the citron cannot be supported. The citron {Citrus medico) was obtained by the Greeks possibly as early as the time of Alexander's Asiatic campaign ; but it is pretty certain that its original home is in Nepaul, and perhaps also in China, the home of the sweet orange, and the late introduction of the Citrus 42 Nov. 5] PROCEEDINGS. [1889. medica into Palestine at once forbids its identification with the Biblical tree.* The claim of the quince (Cydonia vulgaris) has been ad- vocated by Celsius (Hierobotanicon i, p. 254-267). This tree is a native of the Mediterranean basin, and is when ripe deliciously fragant, but according to our Western tastes, by no means pleasant to the taste when uncooked, but on the contrary austere and unpleasant. This latter fact is regarded generally as destructive of its pretensions ; but for my part I hesitate to throw over the claims of the quince to denote the tappuakh, on account of its taste. \" De gustibus non est disputandum.\" The flavour and odour of plants or other things is simply a matter of opinion. Orientals set a high value on flavours and odours which to European senses are unpleasing ; moreover we must seek for the reason why such and such a fruit was regarded with approbation. Let me adduce the instance of the mandrake, Atropa mandragora. To most Europeans the smell of the whole plant is very fetid, but even Europeans differ ; Schulz says \" they have a delightful smell and the taste is equally agreeable, though not to everybody.\" Mariti says \" the fruit is of the size and colour of a small apple, ruddy and of a most agreeable odour.\" Tristram writes, \" the perfume of the flower we found by no means disagreeable, though it is said by some to be fetid\" (Land of Israel, p. 102). Again, it has a peculiar, but decidedly not unpleasant smell and a pleasant sweet taste \" (Nat. Hist. Bib., p. 467, ed. 7th). When we remember the properties which the mandrake was and is still supposed by the natives of Palestine to possess, viz., its efficacy as a love-philtre to strengthen the affection between the sexes, we see at once the reason of their * Some writers have concluded that the citron was known to the early Jews of Palestine from the testimony of Josephus who {Auti,j. xiii, 13, § 5) states that King Alexander Janna?us was pelted with citrons (/cirpioit) which at the Feast of Tabernacles the Jews had in their hands, because \"the law required that at that feast every one should have branches of the palm-tree and citron-tree.\" Josephus evidently had in mind the its hadar of Lev. xxiii, 40, which he considered to be some special tree, rather than any \"goodly\" or ornamental tree; but Ilehn has well shown that the Greek Kirpiov, the Latin citrus comes originally from KtSpog, the scented wood of conifera.-, and in time came to be used for the citron on account of its supposed property to preserve clothes, &c, from mollis, like the scented wood of the cedars and other conifers. As the golden Median apple was laid among clothes for this purpose (the custom continuing into the middle of the second century A.D.), and as the smell of the rind was thought to be similar to that of cedar-resin, the common people imagined it to be the fruit of the citrus tree and gave it the name citrium (Wanderings, etc., p. $33). 43 Nov. 5] SOCIETY OF BIBLICAL ARCHEOLOGY. [1889. fondness for it. The same arguments may, I think, be applied to the tappuakh. \" The Song of Solomon,\" so called, seems to be a sort of pastoral love-song, partly dramatic, and it abounds with expressions of endearment, caresses and love. The quince among the ancient Greeks and Romans was a token of love ; it seems to have been so regarded by the Orientals. Celsius quotes Abu'l Fadli in illustration of Cant, ii, 5, \" Comfort me with tappukhi/u, for I am love-sick.\" \"Its scent,\" says the Arabian writer, \"che"
