        "meta_description": "Sea anemones (order Actiniaria) are among the most diverse and successful members of the anthozoan subclass Hexacorallia, occupying benthic marine habitats across all depths and latitudes. Actiniaria comprises approximately 1,200 species of solitary and skeleton-less polyps and lacks any anatomical synapomorphy. Although monophyly is anticipated based on higher-level molecular phylogenies of Cnidaria, to date, monophyly has not been explicitly tested and at least some hypotheses on the diversification of Hexacorallia have suggested that actiniarians are para- or poly-phyletic. Published phylogenies have demonstrated the inadequacy of existing morphological-based classifications within Actiniaria. Superfamilial groups and most families and genera that have been rigorously studied are not monophyletic, indicating conflict with the current hierarchical classification. We test the monophyly of Actiniaria using two nuclear and three mitochondrial genes with multiple analytical methods. These analyses are the first to include representatives of all three currently-recognized suborders within Actiniaria. We do not recover Actiniaria as a monophyletic clade: the deep-sea anemone Boloceroides daphneae, previously included within the infraorder Boloceroidaria, is resolved outside of Actiniaria in several of the analyses. We erect a new genus and family for B. daphneae, and rank this taxon incerti ordinis. Based on our comprehensive phylogeny, we propose a new formal higher-level classification for Actiniaria composed of only two suborders, Anenthemonae and Enthemonae. Suborder Anenthemonae includes actiniarians with a unique arrangement of mesenteries (members of Edwardsiidae and former suborder Endocoelantheae). Suborder Enthemonae includes actiniarians with the typical arrangement of mesenteries for actiniarians (members of former suborders Protantheae, Ptychodacteae, and Nynantheae and subgroups therein). We also erect subgroups within these two newly-erected suborders. Although some relationships among these newly-defined groups are still ambiguous, morphological and molecular results are consistent enough to proceed with a new higher-level classification and to discuss the putative functional and evolutionary significance of several morphological attributes within Actiniaria.",

        "text": "Taxonomic Sampling\n\nNo special specific permit was required to collect marine anemones. The sampling did not involve endangered or protected species. Actiniarian specimens were collected intertidally by hand, through SCUBA diving, or via trawls. All specimens were identified using polyp anatomy and the distribution and size of cnidae in various regions of the polyp. Voucher specimens fixed in formalin have been deposited at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology (ZSM), the California Academy of Sciences (CAS), the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (RMNH), the University of Kansas Natural History Museum (KUNHM), and the U. S. National Museum of Natural History (USNM).\n\nWe provide new DNA sequence data for multiple representatives of each of the historically-proposed higher-level groups within Actiniaria, representing approximately three quarters (67%) of the family-level diversity within the order (Table S1). Specimens from multiple localities were sampled for broadly distributed or potentially heterogeneous taxa such as Metridium senile [21] or Diadumene ( = Haliplanella) lineata [22]. Three species within the subclass Octocorallia–the putative sister group to the subclass Hexacorallia ([23], [24]; but see [25])–were used as outgroups. To test the monophyly of the order Actiniaria rigorously, we included taxa representing the breadth of hexacorallian diversity, including multiple species from the orders Antipatharia, Ceriantharia, Corallimorpharia, Scleractinia, and Zoanthidea. We only included taxa for which we were able to amplify at least three of the five markers used, which resulted in a phylogeny consisting of 156 taxa. DNA sequences from GenBank were also included as appropriate (Table S1). Note that in a few cases, not all markers have been sequenced for the same individual within a species or the same specimens within a genus. Thus, the combined analysis contains terminal taxa that are chimeric at some level (e.g., Cirrhipathes, Aiptasia pallida [26], Dendronephthya, Pavona); these chimeras are indicated with asterisks in Table S1.\n\nWe have defined and listed the taxonomic changes made in this work in Appendix 1. Authorship of new names here contained should be attribute to Rodríguez and Daly. We have omitted authorship information for taxa above the level of species within the text; refer to Appendix 1, [14], [27], [28] for this information.\n\nThe electronic edition of this article conforms to the requirements of the amended International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), and hence the new names contained herein are available under that Code from the electronic edition of this article. This published work and the nomenclatural acts it contains have been registered in ZooBank, the online registration system for the ICZN.

In the resulting phylogenetic reconstruction the order Actiniaria is not monophyletic–Boloceroides daphneae, previously placed within the infraorder Boloceroidaria, is resolved outside of Actiniaria as sister to the clade containing members of order Zoanthidea (Fig. 1). All other members of Actiniaria cluster into two clades: Endocoelantheae+Edwardsiidae and a large and heterogeneous group that encompasses most of what Carlgren [12] considered Nynantheae. None of the subordinal groups proposed by Carlgren are monophyletic, and their relationships do not align with their ranking or hierarchical position in Carlgren’s [12] system (Table 1).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096998.t001\n\nWe find a monophyletic Hexacorallia and monophyly of all orders within it, except Actiniaria (Fig. 1). Monophyly of Hexacorallia, Antipatharia, Ceriantharia, Corallimorpharia, Scleractinia, and Zoanthidea are each well supported; of these, only one of the least-well sampled taxon, Corallimorpharia, has bootstrap support for monophyly <100%. The clade that includes all Actiniaria except Boloceroides daphneae has bootstrap support of 100% in the concatenated ML analysis (Fig. 1).\n\nThe relationships among ordinal groups supported by our ML analysis of the concatenated dataset (Fig. 1) broadly follow those recovered by Daly et al. [7]. Ceriantharia is sister to all other lineages of Hexacorallia. Within the crown Hexacorallia clade, Actiniaria (exclusive of Boloceroides daphneae) is sister to all other ordinal-level lineages. Scleractinia and Corallimorpharia group together in a well-supported, monophyletic clade; this clade is sister to a clade containing Antipatharia, Zoanthidea, and B. daphneae.\n\nRelationships among Actiniaria vary most significantly in terms of relationships within the large clade of former members of Carlgren’s [12] Nynantheae; the clade that includes Endocoelantheae and Edwardsiidae is well supported and recovered in almost all analyses (Table 2). We find a clade that broadly corresponds to the Endomyaria of Carlgren [12]; however, the position of Epiactis and Capnea renders the clade as paraphyletic. This clade includes some former members of Athenaria (e.g., Harenactis, Stephanthus, Haloclava, Peachia) and members of Ptychodacteae (e.g., Dactylanthus, Preactis) (Fig. 2). The ptychodactean species are not resolved as sister taxa. This large clade of endomyarians, athenarians, and ptychodacteans is sister to a clade corresponding to Rodríguez et al.’s [11] Metridioidea (Fig. 2). We find low support values for Metridioidea and its sublineages (except for MrBayes); as is expected given the expansion of the taxon sample, the support values are generally lower than in [11]. The protantheans Protanthea and Gonactina lie within Metridioidea, in a well-supported sister relationship to the boloceroidarians Boloceroides mcmurrichi [47] and Bunodeopsis. No members of Endocoelantheae or Protantheae have previously been included in a phylogenetic analysis.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096998.t002\n\nClassification and Taxonomic Results\n\nIn accordance with our results, we propose a new higher-level classification for the order Actiniaria, and adjust the taxonomic status of Boloceroides daphneae. We recognize two suborders within Actiniaria, Anenthemonae and Enthemonae. Anenthemonae includes members of Edwardsiidae and the former suborder Endocoelantheae; in members of this lineage mesenteries are not arranged in the typical paired, coupled arrangement seen in other actiniarians and in e.g. Corallimorpharia and Scleractinia. Anenthemonae contains two superfamilies: Edwardsioidea (members of the family Edwardsiidae, which have only eight perfect mesenteries) and Actinernoidea (members of the former suborder Endocoelantheae, which secondary cycles of mesenteries arise in the endocoels). Enthemonae includes the majority of actiniarians (members of former suborders Protantheae, Ptychodacteae, and Nynantheae and subgroups within), all of which have the typical arrangement of mesenteries for actiniarians (primarily hexamerous cycles in which pairs of mesenteries arise in the exocoels). Enthemonae contains three clades that we rank as superfamilies: Actinostoloidea (members of former family Actinostolidae sensu [10]), Actinoidea (members of former Endomyaria and Ptychodacteae plus some former members of Athenaria), and Metridioidea (acontiate actiniarians plus several families that have lost acontia, including members of former sub- and infra-orders Protantheae and Boloceroidaria, respectively). Diagnostic features and constituents of each group are listed in Appendix 1.\n\nAlthough its precise position is as yet unclear, no method or data set supports a close relationship between Boloceroides daphneae and the other members of Boloceroididae (Figs. 1, 3, Table 2). To address this situation, we create a new genus and family for this species. In light of the varied placement of this taxon in our analyses, we consider Relicanthidae fam. nov. Hexacorallia incerti ordinis and thus not within the classification scheme proposed above for Actiniaria.\n\nRepresentation of ancestral character state reconstruction for seven morphological characters within Hexacorallia (acontia, basilar muscles, longitudinal ectodermal muscles, deciduous tentacles, marginal sphincter muscle, microorganism endosymbiosis, apical flaps). Characters mapped onto the Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis of concatenated 12S, 16S, 18S, 28S and cox3. Characters absent unless specified in the figure. Directionality of acontia not inferred due to lack of support of nodes. Colored boxes indicate clades defined in the text; name of each clade is next to the colored box. Species epithets are given only for genera represented by more than one species; for a complete list of taxa, see Table S1. Only bootstrap resampling values (parsimony [TNT] and ML, respectively) >90% and values of posterior probabilities of 0.9 are indicated (by filled-in circles) for legibility; refer to Figures 1 and 2 for other support values.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096998.g003\n\nRelicanthidae fam. nov., Rodríguez and Daly 2014.\n\nDiagnosis. Solitary, skeleton-less hexacorallian with well-developed pedal disc but without basilar muscles. No marginal sphincter muscle. Longitudinal ectodermal muscles in column. Deciduous tentacles with sphincter at the base. Twenty-four pairs of perfect mesenteries arranged hexamerously. Muscles of mesenteries weak. Cnidom: Gracile spirocysts, basitrichs, microbasic p-mastigophores (p-rhabdoid A sensu [48]). Basitrichs with apical flaps.\n\nIncluded genera. Relicanthus gen. nov, Rodríguez and Daly 2014 (for Relicanthus daphneae comb. nov.). The LSID identifier for this taxon is urn:lsid:zoobank.org:act:6611427D-6573-4452-B62C-97C1685EF853.\n\nEtymology and nomenclature. Name comes from the Latin word “reliquiae” meaning “old remains.” Relicanthus gen. nov. is the type genus by monotypy.\n\nRemarks. Although molecular data do not closely affiliate this taxon with Actiniaria, the ultrastructure of its nematocysts strongly suggest that it belongs within Actiniaria: basitrichs of Relicanthus daphneae comb. nov. have apical flaps (Fig. 4) and the distal tubule of microbasic p-mastigophores of R. daphneae comb. nov. does not have spines; these features recall those of Actiniaria (see [1], [48], [49]).\n\nA) SEM image of a discharged capsule of a basitrich from the tentacle of Relicanthus daphneae comb. nov. showing apical flaps.

Rodríguez and Daly 2014.\n\nDiagnosis (after [31]). Relicanthidae with adherent base. Column cylindrical, smooth, not divisible into regions. Tentacles numerous, extremely long and strongly tapering. Mesenteries hexamerously arranged in four cycles; two pairs of directives attached to single weak siphonoglyph. Longitudinal muscles of tentacles and radial muscles of oral disc ectodermal.

The type species of the genus is Boloceroides daphneae [31] by monotypy.

Although the relationships among groups identified by Carlgren [12] do not accord with our phylogenetic results, several of the lineages he identified in his classification are monophyletic: Boloceroidaria, Endocoelantheae, and Protantheae are each monophyletic, but they nest within larger groups rather than representing lineages equivalent in the phylogenetic hierarchy of Actiniaria (Table 1, Figs. 2, 3).\n\nPerhaps because of the simplicity of their body plan, actiniarians show high levels of morphological convergence, and many of the relatively few morphological characters of the order have been repeatedly lost. This also applies to the features highlighted in Carlgren’s [12] classification, which tend to be applicable at more general levels than he inferred. Ectodermal longitudinal muscles are characteristic of the clade that includes the protantheans and the boloceroidarians, not uniquely derived in each. Contra Carlgren [50], this is a derived rather than primitive condition in these lineages. Basilar muscles are characteristic of all enthemonaean anemones and are lost multiple times in each sublineage (Fig. 3). Although Carlgren’s system, like Stephenson’s [13] before it, implied that endodermal and mesogleal marginal muscles represent independent and alternative derivations of marginal musculature, the optimization of marginal sphincter muscles on our trees (Fig. 3) and a recent study of this feature in members of Anenthemonae [51] suggest that marginal musculature is characteristic of Enthemonae, and that they arose as mesogleal muscles, being transformed into an endodermal muscle in the lineage leading to Actinoidea. Marginal musculature has arisen at least three times within Hexacorallia, and in each case (Enthemonae, the anenthemonean Halcurias, and in Zoanthidea; see Fig. 3) it arose as mesogleal muscles.\n\nNonetheless, our findings based on DNA sequence data correspond neatly with several morphological trends observed in the order Actiniaria. The primary distinction among actiniarians (that defining the newly-erected suborders Anenthemonae and Enthemonae) corresponds with the arrangement of the mesenteries. In members of Anenthemonae, the mesenterial arrangement departs from the common hexacorallian arrangement of hexamerous cycles of pairs of mesenteries that arise in the exocoels (space between different pairs of mesenteries) [12]. Similarly, within Anenthemonae, the major split also corresponds to the arrangement of mesenteries: in Edwardsioidea the eight perfect mesenteries arise in exocoels whereas in Actinernoidea secondary pairs of mesenteries arise in the endocoels (space within mesenteries of a pair) (see Appendix 1). The position of Edwardsiidae has been controversial: although Carlgren considered them a family within Nynantheae, others assigned higher-level ranks (e.g., [2], [52], [53], reviewed in [54]).\n\nWithin Enthemonae, acontia and marginal musculature stand out as phylogenetically-consistent features (Fig. 3). These characters have been used in previous classifications (e.g., [12], [55]; reviewed in [28]); we find them to apply at levels other than those suggested by previous workers, and find that both the marginal sphincter muscle and acontia have been lost several times (Fig. 3). Marginal musculature is lost in Edwardsioidea, Actinoidea (e.g., Dactylanthus; Preactis+Korsaranthus), and within Metridioidea (e.g., Boloceroididae+Protantheae, Halcampa+Halcampoides). Many of these instances of loss are associated with a reduction in body size or a shift to an infaunal habitat [6]. The endodermal or mesogleal nature of the marginal musculature also stands out as phylogenetically-consistent feature: members of Actinoidea have endodermal (or no) marginal sphincter and members of Actinostoloidea and Metridioidea have a mesogleal (or no) marginal sphincter muscle. However, the position recovered for Epiactis and Capnea challenges this pattern. Because support values across the tree are relatively low in general and the representation in our analysis of members of Actinoidea is not extensive relative to the diversity of the clade, the position of Epiactis and Capnea is not definitive. Also, the absence of structures in the column of Epiactis might suggest a basal position of this taxon, which might explain is position. Nevertheless, other features, such as cnidae (see below), support the position of Epiactis and Capnea within Actinoidea. Acontia are inferred to have arisen once, at the base of Metridioidea, and to have been lost multiple times (e.g., Boloceroididae+Protantheae; Halcampa+Halcampoides; Ostiactis: see discussion in [11]). In the case of acontia, the position of Triactis and Paranthus challenges this generalization. Nevertheless, Triactis belongs to Aliciidae, a family not well sampled in this study (only two taxa included), which have many modifications to their anatomy (its members have lost the marginal musculature, gained unique column structures, etc.). As with Epiactis and Capnea, cnidae (see below) support the position of Triactis within Metridioidea. A denser taxon sampling is required to address the placement and support of these specific taxa.\n\nCnidae have been interpreted to provide the only synapomorphy for Actiniaria, as all Actiniaria (and only Actiniaria) have nematocysts with apical flaps and have no spines on the distal tubule of p-mastigophores [1], [48]. However, the phylogenetic position recovered in our analyses for Relicanthus daphneae comb. nov. and the presence of apical flaps and p-mastigophores without spines in the distal tubule in nematocysts of this taxon (Fig. 4) raise two possibilities: 1) these features of the cnidae are not a synapomorphy for sea anemones, or 2) the molecular data incorrectly place R. daphneae comb. nov. outside of Actiniaria. The origin and evolution of apical flaps remains unresolved until the position of Relicanthus within Hexacorallia is resolved with higher support. Similarly, the order Actiniaria remains characterized by the absence of attributes defining other orders of hexacorals. Nevertheless, although the current classification of cnidae is not useful for phylogenetic inference, cnidae have been shown to carry phylogenetic information, with different clades associated with different types of cnidae [56]. For example, p-rhabdoids B (∼microbasic p-amastigophores) characterize acontiate actiniarians (superfamily Metridioidea) whereas p-rhabdoids A (∼microbasic p-mastigophores) are common in the other clades (e.g., Actinoidea, Actinostoloidea, etc.) (Fig. 4). Our results confirm this: the cnidom of members of former Boloceroidaria and Protantheae resemble those of acontiate actiniarians in having p-rhabdoids B but no p-rhabdoids A. Similarly, Aliciidae, a family traditionally placed within Endomyaria [12], [14] but here recovered within Metridioidea, has a cnidom that includes p-rhabdoids B and lacks p-rhabdoids A, a finding that supports its new placement within Metridioidea.\n\nMetridioidea includes several lineages that have lost or modified many of the features that characterize the group as a whole. Taxa belonging to what had previously been the sub- and infra-orders Protantheae and Boloceroidaria (respectively) form a clade of highly modified species in which several morphological characters (e.g., marginal sphincter and basilar muscles, etc.) have been lost or reduced. Within Metridioidea, we also find clades (e.g., Deepsina, Chemosynthina: [10], [11]) in which acontia have been lost, and others, such as Graspina in which the base is highly modified to exploit substrates in the deep-sea.\n\nFunctional and Evolutionary Correlates of Morphological Attributes\n\nIn our phylogenetic reconstructions we recognize several clades whose members have similar habitats or ecologies. These trends hint at the pattern and nature of radiation within this group and provide context for interpreting the putative function of some morphological attributes. Because our sampling is biased towards deep and shallow water, with relatively fewer species from 60–1000 m, and because many of these clades have relatively low support, these findings bear further exploration. The most distinct examples of ecological clades are perhaps Edwardsioidea, Actinoidea, Actinostoloidea and, within Metridioidea, the acuticulate and cuticulate clades (Fig. 2).\n\nAll members of Edwardsiidae are burrowers; these animals live in soft sediment, with only the tentacle crown exposed (reviewed in [54], [59]). Like most burrowing anemones, edwardsiids are small and lack basal musculature. Burrowing undoubtedly poses some constraints in terms of distribution, but the group is nonetheless diverse and widespread, occurring in every ocean and at all depths [14], often with multiple species co-occurring at a site or in a region (e.g., [55], [60], [61]).\n\nThe superfamily Actinoidea is primarily comprised of shallow-water forms. Members of this clade typically have an endodermal marginal sphincter muscle that allows the distal column to close tightly, retaining water within the column. Many actinoideans have some kind of adhesive structure (vesicles, verrucae, etc.) on the column; these may provide desiccation relief, UV protection, or camouflage [62]. Within Actinoidea is a distinctive deep-sea clade (e.g., Bolocera, Liponema, presumably Iosactis) whose members have long deciduous tentacles and tend to have a short column [58].\n\nActinostolina (superfamily Actinostoloidea) is a deep-sea and polar clade, and includes relatively large animals with smooth columns that are often internal brooders. Internal brooding in marine invertebrates is often associated with extreme environments and although it potentially limits the distribution of the species, it increases survival of the offspring in such environments. Nonetheless, internal brooding is also common in some members of Actinoidea in shallow-water habitats (reviewed in [63]).\n\nMetridioidea contains an acuticulate clade (Fig. 2) comprised of shallow-water anemones with smooth columns, numerous perfect mesenteries, cinclides (perforations in the body wall associated with expulsion of acontia), and microbasic p-amastigophores in the acontia. Within this acuticulate clade we find the former members of suborder Protantheae and infraorder Boloceroidaria as sister taxa. These taxa form a well-supported clade of small-sized, highly-derived actiniarians that have lost several morphological characters–marginal sphincter muscle, basilar muscles, acontia– but share a synapomorphy of having ectodermal longitudinal muscles at least in the distal column. Because of similarities in the cnidom, Schmidt [49] associated members of families Aiptasiidae and Aliciidae with the former Protantheae and Boloceroidaria; we find that Aliciidae is sister to the clade containing former members of Protantheae and Boloceroidaria (except Relicanthus daphneae comb. nov.). The reductions in musculature and the retention of juvenile features such as ectodermal column muscles may reflect paedomorphosis.\n\nIn contrast, the cuticulate clade within Metridioidea (“Clade II” sensu [11]) contains mostly deep-sea forms, whose thick columns bear cuticle and (usually) tubercles. Despite their large size, perfect mesenteries are not numerous in these animals. Within Cuticulata, we see several taxa that have reduced or lost acontia (Fig. 3). Among these are members of the clade Graspina (families Actinoscyphiidae, Amphianthidae, and Galatheanthemidae), whose members have a modified pedal disc that enables them to exploit alternative substrates (e.g., tubes of worms, octocorals, etc.), a distinctive advantage in the deep sea because rocky outcrops may be limited. Actiniarians from deep-sea chemosynthetic environments (clade Chemosynthina, see [10], [11]) also share the loss of acontia; but in this case cinclides are still usually present.\n\nThis phylogeny provides context for understanding the evolution of muscles, a feature previous authors (e.g., [12], [13], [49]) considered of primary importance in classifying actiniarians. We infer that basal muscles are primitively absent in Anenthemonae (Fig. 3). This means that, contra Daly et al. [6], basilar muscles have not been lost in the burrowing Edwardsiidae, although they do seem to be lost in other burrowing lineages (e.g., Halcampa+Halcampoides, Andvakia, Haloclava). Marginal sphincter muscles are reduced or lost in several burrowing forms (e.g., Halcampa+Halcampoides, Andvakia, Actinostephanus) and in several non-burrowing forms (e.g., Aliciidae, Boloceroidaria+Protantheae); these muscles are most commonly lost in forms that undergo an overall reduction in column diameter, a reduction that may occur in concert with or separately from the adoption of a burrowing habit.\n\nSmall body size does not correlate with relatively fewer mesenteries, at least in a few critical cases. For example, the cuticulate clade within Metridioidea includes relatively large-bodied animals, but these all have relatively few mesenteries, when compared to members of the acuticulate clade or to members of Actinoidea. Size is more constrained in burrowing forms than in those that attach: Edwardsiidae encompasses animals with less variation in size than does Actinernoidea or any of the clades within Enthemonae.\n\nAssociations with photosymbiotic microorganisms occur across the actiniarian tree (within Edwardsiidae, Actinoidea, and in both the cuticulate and acuticulate clades of Metridioidea). Given its distribution within each clade and the biases in our taxon sampling towards shallow-water species (and thus toward those taxa in which this trait is likely to occur), it is difficult to make broad inferences about the distribution of this trait except to note that the capacity to engage with symbionts is broadly distributed across Actiniaria and probably analogous across Hexacorallia (Fig. 3). Although symbiosis with metazoans is similarly broadly distributed, those relationships show clearer ecological or lineage-specific patterns. Symbiosis with scyphozoans and ctenophorans has arisen in two very distantly-related lineages of burrowing anemones (Edwardsiidae and Haloclavidae, see [64] and [65] for Edwardsiella and Peachia, respectively). Symbiosis with hermit crabs has arisen once within Actinoidea (in Stylobates: reviewed in [66]) and multiple times within Cuticulata (reviewed in [67]).\n\nWith respect to other Hexacorallia, Actiniaria is characterized by “absence” of traits: its members lack a skeleton, are solitary, and have only a marginal ring of tentacles. Labial tentacles (in addition to marginal tentacles) characterize Ceriantharia and are inferred to be a synapomorphy for that clade. The lack of skeleton of Actiniaria is primary rather than secondary; the topology of the ML concatenated data set suggests that the skeleton of corals and that of Antipatharia arose as an independent event in each of those clades. Similarly, we infer the solitary state of Actiniaria to be ancestral and shared with Ceriantharia; the shift to colonial life occurs in its sister clade (see discussion in [7]). The marginal sphincter muscle borne by many anemones has an analog among hexacorallians in Zoanthidea, but this seems to be an independent origin; within Actiniaria our analyses suggest that the marginal sphincter muscle has also evolved independently twice, once within Actinernoidea (in Halcurias) and once at the base of the Enthemonae; in both instances the marginal sphincter seems to have arisen as a mesogleal muscle (Fig. 3).\n\nIt is currently impossible to date the age of the split between the major lineages of Actiniaria: there are no fossils for Actiniaria that can be associated with any specific clade, and rates of molecular evolution are heterogeneous within the order (see branch lengths, Fig. 2 and [9]) and within the larger clade to which Actiniaria belongs (see [68]). Nevertheless, the broader phylogeny of Hexacorallia provides some perspective because Actiniaria is at least as old as the constituents of its sister lineage. Fossil-based estimates for skeletonized hexacorals place the group deep in the Paleozoic: 425 mya for Scleractinia [69] and 470 mya for Antipatharia [70] (but see [71] for discussion of fossil identity). Because the divergence between Actiniaria and other hexacorallians must precede the emergence of each of these sublineages, that split must be at least 470 mya."
