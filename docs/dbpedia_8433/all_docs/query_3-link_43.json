        "text": "Josiah D. Laird\n\nProminent because of his success as a farmer and also because of his long residence in Buchanan county, Josiah D. Laird is numbered among the influential citizens of Jesup and Perry township. For fifty-four years he has lived in this section of Iowa and there are few men who are so well acquainted with the early history of this section or who retain a more distinct recollection of its pioneer settlers than does Mr. Laird.\n\nHe was born in Mesopotamia, Trumbull county, Ohio, January 14, 1835, and has therefore passed the seventy-ninth year of his age. His parents were James and Katherine (Cox) Laird, the former a native of Pennsylvania, born in 1806. His father, who also bore the name of James, was born in Scotland and settled in the Keystone state in an early day. The father of our subject was reared in the latter place and was there married, subsequent to which time he purchased land in Trumbull county, Ohio, to which he removed. He cleared his farm and eventually brought it to a high state of cultivation. In the winter months, however, he engaged in teaching school for many years. He died in Trumbull county when he had reached the age of sixty-five years. His wife, who was born in 1809 and was of German extraction, died at the comparatively early age of forty years.\n\nReared on the home farm in Trumbull county, Josiah D. Laird attended the district schools of the neighborhood until he was fifteen years of age, at which time he entered an academy at Orwell, Ohio. At the age of seventeen he taught a winter term of school and subsequently taught one season at the academy which he had previously attended. His time was alternated by farming and teaching until 1860, when he came to Buchanan county, Iowa, to locate on one hundred and sixty acres of land which had been given him by his father. During the succeeding three winters he engaged in teaching at Littleton and then disposed of his land. He next engaged in buying grain for a time and in the meantime built an elevator at Jesup. He dealt in farm lands and for five or six years served as deputy sheriff in Buchanan county. He eventually made a trade by which he came into possession of forty acres of land adjoining the town of Jesup. He has since added to this until the property now comprises two hundred acres, one hundred and forty acres of which lies within the corporate limits. This land is well improved and is under a high state of cultivation. There are also to be found here three substantial sets of buildings. Although well advanced in years he is still active and appears much younger. He has seen this district develop into a prosperous region, having located here in pioneer days even before the railroad was built and he has done not a little to bring about the transformation that has here been witnessed along various lines.\n\nMr. Laird was married on the 19th of March, 1863, to Miss Abbie Mosher, a daughter of Allen and Phoebe (Wilbur) Mosher, who was born in Columbia county, New York, May 5, 1835, and comes of Quaker stock. Her parents were both natives of Columbia county and about 1855 they made their way to Clayton county, Iowa, where the father engaged in farming. They subsequently removed to Jesup, where they spent a decade, then made their home among their children, spending much of their time with Mr. and Mrs. Laird. They, too, were Quakers and both lived to a venerable age, the mother passing away at the age of eighty-four, while the father reached the age of ninety years ere he was called from this life.\n\nThe marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Laird has been blessed with three children: Fannie K., the wife of Charles Oliver, of Omaha, Nebraska; Jay R., who operates the home farm; and Abbie May, the wife of E. R. Shoemaker, of Waterloo, Iowa.\n\nMr. Laird has always been a stanch supporter of the republican party and in his earlier life was very active in public affairs. For six years he served as deputy sheriff and at one time was a candidate for the office of sheriff but met defeat by fifteen votes. He was township trustee and also served as a member of the board of supervisors for one term, while for many years he was a member of the school board. Fraternally he is a Mason and both he and his wife have been members of, and active workers in the Presbyterian church for more than half a century. For fifty years Mr. Laird was clerk of the sessions of the Presbyterian church but then resigned. Their children too are all devout members of the church. His sterling traits of character have won for him a wide acquaintance and he and his family enjoy the highest esteem of a host of warm friends.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nColonel Jed Lake\n\nThe number of those surviving who were in reality pioneers in the state and who, through unremitting toil and the brave endurance of hardships, took possession of the wild prairies years ago in the name of civilization, whether as farmers, professional men or merchants, is fast decreasing, but the memory of their heroic lives will remain as a stimulus to endeavor as long as the great state which they founded endures. Colonel Jed Lake, who passed away at Independence on the 7th of June, 1914, was a man who, coming to this country in the early days, suffered the discomforts of pioneer life and also knew the stern pleasure that comes from persevering in a worthy work and from performing faithfully a duty. He was one of the first attorneys of the county and rose to a position of leadership at the local bar, which he retained until the infirmities of age compelled him to largely retire from practice.\n\nHis birth occurred in Cortland county, New York, on the 18th of November, 1830, and his parents were Jedediah and Patience (Church) Lake. The father was born in 1798, in Montgomery county, New York, a son of Henry Lake, who served under General George Washington in the Revolutionary war, enlisting when a boy of seventeen years and serving for four years. In 1822 Jedediah Lake settled in Virgil, Cortland county, New York, and there his marriage to Miss Church occurred. She was a native of Windsor, Vermont, and by her marriage became the mother of four children, of whom the subject of this review was the third in order of birth. The father died when the Colonel was but three years of age, leaving the mother with four children, the eldest of whom was but seven years old.\n\nColonel Lake attended the common schools in the acquirement of an education, and worked at whatever he could find to do in order to partly provide for his own support. At one time he drove a team on the Erie canal for thirteen dollars a month and as soon as he had received sufficient education he engaged in teaching school. He also worked as a farm hand for some time and as he was determined to continue his studies he lived as economically as possible and saved his earnings and in this way accumulated a sufficient sum to enable him to attend the New York Central College at McGraw, New York. While a student there he worked in his spare time and thus paid part of his expenses. He later attended Homer Academy, taking an advanced course in mathematics, but as his health had initially failed he left school and turned his attention to outdoor work.\n\nIn 1855, when a young man of twenty-five, Colonel Lake came to Buchanan county and for two years worked upon a farm in Buffalo township but at the end of that time came to Independence and began the study of law. He was admitted to the bar in the spring of 1859 and immediately entered upon practice his death served in that capacity and was always untiring in his efforts to advance the interests of the institution. His last appearance in court was man action to maintain the rights of the public to the school property. In many other ways he manifested an unusual public spirit, being willing to make personal sacrifices in order to advance the community welfare. As an instance of this spirit those who were living in Independence in 1875 may recall that at that time when the Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railroad Company proposed to construct its Decorah division through Independence Colonel Lake gave the enterprise his earnest support and at a time during a financial stringency when failure seemed imminent, he and Dr. Bryant personally guaranteed the grading of several miles of the road, thereby securing it for the town. He was a director and attorney for the First National Bank of Independence and also a director and chairman of the executive committee of the Independence Mill Company as well as its local representative.\n\nColonel Lake was married January 2, 1861, to Miss Sarah E. Meyer, who was born in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, January 2, 1842, a daughter of Henry and Isadora (Sullivan) Meyer. Her father was born near Hamburg, Germany, and was married in 1835 in London, England, to Miss Sullivan, a native of that city, and they soon afterward emigrated to the United States. After an ocean voyage of seven weeks they landed in America and made their way to Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, where they settled. The father farmed there for some time and then removed with his family to Rockford. Illinois, where they remained until 1855, in which year they came by wagon to this county and the father entered government land in Byron township. He improved the same and operated it until his death, at .seventy-six years of age. His wife died when sixty-five years old. To their union were born twelve children, six of whom grew to maturity. Mrs. Lake was only a child when she accompanied her parents to this county and here she grew to womanhood and attended school. By her marriage she became the mother of three children. Rush C., an attorney in Kansas City, Missouri, is quite prominent in city politics and a leader in his profession. Jarvis N. died in infancy. Harriet I., the only daughter, resides with her mother. She is very active in women's clubs, having served as regent for Iowa of the Daughters of the American Revolution, and is also well known in the Colonial Dames.\n\nMrs. Lake is one of the few pioneer women now living and is known throughout the city for her good deeds as she has done much to aid the sick and poor, and her sincere sympathy for those in trouble has made her ministrations welcome and acceptable. She is a quiet, unassuming woman but has great strength of character and also much practical business ability. She was for sixteen years president of the Ladies' Poor Relief Society and has since been made an honorary life member of the same. At the time of the Civil war, when her husband enlisted for service, their eldest child was an infant and she went to the home of her parents and while living there saved the money which the Colonel sent her and with it purchased a farm, which proved an excellent investment. She has many friends, who hold her in affectionate regard, and her long and useful life and womanly qualities command the respect of the community. She proved in all respects a worthy helpmate to Colonel Lake and was always in sympathy with his undertakings and aided him in his work in many ways. He was foremost in any movement that promised to advance the interests of Independence and the city owes much to him. His great-hearted and broadminded personality commanded the respect of those who at times differed with him in their judgment as to the best course to pursue in a given matter and those to whom he gave his friendship prized highly his regard and favorable opinion. His personal appearance fitted well with his character, as he was a man of large frame, well proportioned and of great physical strength. His demise, which occurred June 7, 1914, was the occasion of much sincere sorrow throughout the county and the influence of his life is potent in making for true manhood and unselfish public service.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nJames F. Lamb\n\nJames F. Lamb, one of the prominent and leading agriculturists of Jefferson township, is the owner of an excellent farm comprising one hundred and seventy acres on section 16. He is numbered among the worthy native sons of Buchanan county, his birth having occurred in Jefferson township in 1872. His parents, Bernard and Ellen Martin Lamb, were both natives of County Cavan, Ireland. The father emigrated to the United States with his parents as a young man and located in Boston, Massachusetts, where he was successfully engaged in the shoe business for seven years. On the expiration of that period he sold out and came to Jefferson township, Buchanan county, Iowa, purchasing the farm of one hundred and seventy acres which is now in possession of our subject. The operation of that place claimed his attention throughout the remainder of his active business career and his last years were spent in honorable retirement at Independence, this county, where he had purchased a nice home and where his demise occurred at the age of seventy-nine. He gave his political allegiance to the democracy and was a devout communicant of the Catholic church. Mrs. Lamb, who passed away in Independence six years prior to the death of her husband, had come to this country in company with her parents, who took up their abode in Boston, Massachusetts, and there died. She belonged to the Ancient Order of Hibernians and in religious faith was a Catholic.\n\nJames F. Lamb attended the public schools in the acquirement of an education and has always remained on the old home farm where he was born and which he now owns and operates. The place comprises one hundred and seventy acres of rich and productive land on section 16, Jefferson township, and in its cultivation he has met with gratifying success, raising the cereals best adapted to soil and climate and also devoting considerable attention to live stock. When a young man of thirty-three years Mr. Lamb was united in marriage to Miss May Duddy, her parents being P. C. and Catherine Duddy, both of whom are natives of Ireland. They emigrated to the United States, were married at Philadelphia and are now residing on a farm at Clear Water, Minnesota. Mr. and Mrs. Lamb have two children, Ita K. and Gerald D.\n\nIn politics Mr. Lamb is a democrat and his influence is ever on the side of public progress and improvement. He was instrumental in having the new electric railroad built through Brandon and his cooperation may ever be counted upon to further any movement or measure instituted to promote the general welfare. His religious faith is that of the Catholic church, and in the community where his entire life has been spent he is well known and highly esteemed as an upright, honorable and valued citizen.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nEphraim Leach\n\nAlthough ninety-two years of age, Ephraim Leach still retains the vigor and clarity of mind which made him one of the leaders of his generation in various lines of endeavor. He was for many years vice president of the First National Bank of Independence, which he assisted in organizing, and was also the owner of immense tracts of land, but he has now given the management of his extensive interests to others and is passing his days in ease. Although a native of the east, he has resided in the middle west for many years and knows by experience the life of the American pioneer. At one time he drove through by wagon from New York to Wisconsin, as that was long before the days of adequate railway connection.\n\nEphraim Leach was born in Owego, New York, June 28, 1822, a son of Ephraim and Sophia (Jones) Leach. The father was born in New England and was a son of Caleb Leach, whose birth occurred in 1755 and who died in 1782. The mother of Ephraim Leach, Sr., was in her maidenhood Miss Abigail Tinkham, who was born in 1758 and passed away in 1818. She was a direct descendant of Miles Standish. Caleb Leach was the son of Peter, who was born in England About 1732 or 1733, and probably came from England. The records of the family covering this period in the history are lost but they show that in 1774 John Tilson, of Halifax, Massachusetts, was chosen as guardian for Caleb Leach and his brother Ebenezer. As nothing more is recorded concerning the latter it is probable that he died unmarried and that Caleb was thus left the sole heir. Caleb Leach was apprenticed to a watchmaker in early life and at the beginning of the Revolutionary war enlisted in Captain Keith's Company, which was a part of Paul D. Sargent's Twenty-eighth Massachusetts Regiment. After serving for eight months he reenlisted for one year and in 1776 was one of the army that marched into Boston. He was stricken with smallpox and was sent to Brooklyn Hospital, where he was cared for. After recovering he returned to his regiment and fought at Hellgate but was again taken sick at White Plains and was sent to a hospital. He was later given a furlough and went home, but on the 10th of September, 1777, again entered the army at Halifax, this time becoming a member of the company commanded by Lieutenant Jesse Sturdevant. This command later went to Albany, New York, where it guarded military stores. Caleb Leach was afterward transferred to Captain James Cogswell's company, which was a part of the Eighth Massachusetts Continental line, commanded by Colonel James Wessens. They marched to the vicinity of Trenton, thence to White Marsh, Pennsylvania, and eventually to Valley Forge, where they joined Washington's army and spent the winter, the hardships and suffering endured there during the months of bitter cold being a matter of common knowledge. Mr. Leach was again taken sick and left there when the army began the campaign in the spring. He was discharged September 10, 1780, after having served three years in Colonel Wessens' regiment, being sergeant for the last ten months. He returned to Halifax and again worked at his trade of watchmaker.\n\nHe was married on the 17th of January, 1782, to Miss Abigail Tinkham, a daughter of Ephraim and Sarah (Standish) Tinkham. Mr. Leach was a man of considerable mechanical skill and made the first orrery ever made in America, which he presented to Brownville. In 1796 he organized the Plymouth aqueduct, which is said to have been the first waterworks built in this country. He invented a pop auger for boring holes and received his patent for the same signed by John Adams, president. In 1798 he presented the sword of Miles Standish to the Massachusetts Historical Society. Two years later, in company with Aaron Burr, DeWitt Clinton and others, he went to New York city and built the Manhattan waterworks, on whose charter the Manhattan Bank was founded. He was superintendent of the water company and a director and stockholder in the Manhattan Bank. He also built the Fairmount waterworks at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n\nHe eventually removed to Owego. New York, where he became one of the leaders in the development of the business interests of the community. He built a grist mill, a woolen mill and a distillery, all of which he conducted successfully He took a prominent part in public affairs and was also active in church work.\n\nEphraim Leach, Sr., father of our subject, assisted his father in the building of the waterworks in New York city and Philadelphia, and mills at Owego, New York He was a civil engineer and a man of considerable note in his locality. His son Ephraim was reared under the parental roof and assisted in the operation of the mills and woolen factory which belonged to the family and which were situated at what is now known as Leach's Mills. He pursued a civil engineering course at the Owego Academy and subsequently worked in the fields with his father for a year. When a young man of twenty-three years he went to Janesville, Wisconsin, which city was then, in 1845, a town of eighteen hundred people. He purchased four hundred acres of wild land near the town paying one dollar and a quarter per acre. He improved the land and rented the same on shares while he clerked in a store for two and one-half years He then returned to his home in New York and assisted his father in the management of his property and upon the latter's death, in association with a brother he purchased the interests of the other heirs in the various industrial concerns formerly owned by his father, and our subject managed the same for some time. In 1851, however, he went to California by the Nicaragua route, desiring to try his fortune in that Eldorado. For two years he assisted a friend who owned a store at Marysville, California, and then established a mercantile business of his own at Suckers Flat, upon the Yuba, where he also had mining interests He remained there several months and then sold out and returned to Owego, New York, by way of Panama. When crossing the Isthmus he contracted Panama fever and did not recover from the effects thereof for eight months. He subsequently took charge of his business in New York but in 1855 sold his interests there. In December, 1856, he came to Independence, Iowa, which at that time had but eight hundred inhabitants. He engaged in loaning money for several years and also bought land extensively, purchasing about live hundred acres near the town and paying from five to six dollars per acre. Some of the tract is still in possession of the family. In 1860 he went to Michigan and purchased eight hundred sheep, which he drove through to this county, and for three or four years engaged in the raising of sheep, letting them out to others to care for them upon shares. About the time of the close of the Civil War he discontinued that business and in 1865 assisted in organizing the First National Bank of Independence, becoming vice president. For six months he was also the manager of the bank but at the end of that time the institution employed a cashier to handle administrative detail. Mr. Leach remained vice president for almost thirty-five years and was a potent force in determining the policies of the institution by reason of his foresight, his executive ability and the lucidity of his mind. In 1900, he retired and has since lived in well earned leisure in the beautiful Leach home in Independence.\n\nMr. Leach was married on the 26th of February, 1868, to Miss Mary E. Tracy, who was born in Cazenovia, New York, on the 1st of August. 1845, and came upon a visit to Iowa, where she met her future husband. She also survives and is highly esteemed by all who know her. Her branch of the Tracy family qualifies for the societies of Americans of Royal Descent and Colonial Governors. To them was born a son, Robert Ephraim, who became one of the leading attorneys of Independence, but who during the last years of his life devoted the greater part of his time to looking after his extensive business interests and those of his father. He met death by accident on the 30th of August, 1914, and his passing was a source of loss to the community at large. A sketch of his life appears elsewhere in this work.\n\nMr. Leach of this review has been a republican since age conferred upon him the right of franchise but has never consented to hold public office. His wife is a member of the Presbyterian church and has taken an active part in its work for many years. The couple are widely known in Independence and its vicinity and are accorded the honor and esteem which they so richly deserve, their long lives of useful and honorable activity entitling them to the respect of all. Independence and Buchanan county owe much to the energy and wisdom of Ephraim Leach, as he aided in commercial expansion in many ways but most of all through his connection with the First National Bank. Through the years of his long life he has been intimately connected with many in business and in all of his dealings with his fellowmen has proved a man of unimpeachable honor and integrity.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nRobert Ephraim Leach\n\nThe news of the sudden death of Robert Ephraim Leach, which was occasioned by an accident, on the 30th of August, 1914, came as a shock to Independence, as he was a man in the prime of life and possessed of great physical vigor. He was one of the leaders in civic affairs, prominent in fraternal circles and a business man of no mean ability. He was often referred to as the best educated man in Independence, and was proficient in many languages and also in higher mathematics. He did not admit all to intimate relationship, but those who were privileged in being his close friends held him in the highest honor, as they found him in all circumstances a man true to his word, even at the greatest material cost to himself, and unflinchingly loyal to any cause in which he believed. For a number of years he was one of the leaders of the bar of Buchanan county, but for some time previous to his death he concentrated his energies upon the management of his estate and that of his aged father, Ephraim Leach, one of the pioneers of the county.\n\nMr. Leach, of this review, was born in this city on the 13th of February, 1869, a son of Ephraim and Mary E. (Tracey) Leach. A sketch of the father appears elsewhere in this work. The subject of this review was the only child born to his parents and was reared in Independence, attending the public schools of the city. However, his secondary education was acquired in Waterloo, and after being graduated from the high school there in 1886 he entered the State University of Iowa at Iowa City, and completed his course there with the class of 1889. After spending two years in post-graduate work in Harvard University he entered the law department of the University of Iowa, from which he was graduated with his legal degree in 1894. His college career was one of unusual success, both in scholastic attainments and in the field of student activities. His scholarship was of a high order and won him election to Phi Beta Kappa, an honorary college fraternity founded at William and Mary in 1776 for the purpose of recognizing marked ability shown in college work and also with the aim of fostering the love of learning. That he held the respect and esteem of his college mates is apparent from the fact that he was elected a member of Beta Theta Pi, a leading college fraternity, and was president of Phi Delta Phi, a law fraternity.\n\nAfter leaving law school he pursued his legal studies in the office of Woodward & Cook, and was in due time admitted to the bar. He subsequently practiced his profession alone for a year, but upon the death of J. S. Woodward, formed a partnership with the latter 's partner, J. E. Cook, and this law firm continued until about 1905. Mr. Leach then again practiced by himself for a time, but subsequently became associated with R. J. O'Brien in the formation of a law firm, which continued until January, 1909. At that time Mr. Leach withdrew from the firm and devoted his time and energy to the management of his other interests and those of his father. He was successful in everything that he undertook, bending the powers of his fine intellect, trained in the best schools of the country, to the accomplishment of whatever task he had in hand, and the association of his name with any project insured its validity. As a lawyer he was aggressive in the conduct of any case entrusted to him, his wide learning and his keen, vigorous mind making him an opponent much to be feared, and he won an unusually high percentage of the cases in which he appeared as counsel.\n\nMr. Leach was married on the 28th of June, 1894, to Miss Kate E. Woodward, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. S. Woodward, a sketch of whom appears elsewhere in this work. To Mr. and Mrs. Leach were born four children: Robert Woodward; Jerome Southwick, who is deceased; Ephraim; and Catharine, also deceased.\n\nMr. Leach was a member of the Presbyterian church and practiced in his daily life the teachings of Christianity. Fraternally he was prominent, belonging to Independence Lodge, A. F. & A. M.; Aholiah Chapter, R. A. M.; Kenneth Commandery, K. T.; Crescent Lodge, K. P.; Wapsie Camp, M. W. A.; Independence Lodge, I. O. O. F.; and Anchor Homestead. B. A. Y.; and he was also affiliated with a number of other organizations, including the Harvard Club of Chicago, the Buchanan County Bar Association, and the Iowa State Bar Association.\n\nHe was an accomplished linguist, being master of the English, German, Greek, Latin, French, Spanish and Italian languages, and able to translate to some extent two other foreign tongues. Not only was he gifted as a language student, but he was also a mathematician of exceptional ability. He realized the importance to a community of a good school system and he recognized also the fact that the best work can only be done when there is adequate equipment, and was the one man who did the most towards securing the fine new high school building, which is the pride of the city. A great many, disliking the idea of the expense of erecting a modern high school building, were in favor of patching up the old one, but Mr. Leach circulated a petition and secured a sufficient number of signatures to insure the success of the plan to erect a new building.\n\nPolitically Mr. Leach belonged to the republican party, and was active in its ranks until 1912, at which time he joined the progressive party, and from that year until his death was one of the leaders of the new organization in this state. He was delegate from Iowa to notify Colonel Roosevelt of his nomination for president. He was candidate for Congress in this district upon the progressive ticket and his energetic and telling campaign resulted in his polling many more votes than the politicians of the older parties believed possible. He was a man who, while quietly insisting upon his rights, was also scrupulous in the discharge of his duties and just to ail men. In his family relations he was all that a man should be, and his friends found that his loyalty was unchanging and steadfast. His sense of obligation included the community in which he lived his entire life, and no citizen of Independence ever labored more unselfishly or sincerely for her welfare. He was a man of magnificent physique and his great strength and reserve force, coupled with his fine mind, enabled him to achieve much in diverse lines of endeavor.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nJohn Leary\n\nEarly in life John Leary realized that the chief factor in the attainment of success is industry, and in cultivating and utilizing that quality he has become one of the well-to-do farmers of Westburg township, where he now makes his home, owning and cultivating two hundred and forty acres on section 3. He was born in Rochester, New York, in 1852, his parents being Dan and Margaret (McMullen) Leary. The father, a native of Ireland, came to the United States when thirteen years of age, settling in Rochester, New York, and removing to Kendall, Orleans county, that state, in 1856. For ten years he was a stage driver and later rented a farm which he cultivated for a short time. He subsequently returned to Rochester, where he worked as a boiler maker until his health failed him and he went to live with his daughter at Carlton, Orleans county, where he passed away in 1903. In politics he was a democrat and his religious faith was that of the Catholic church. His wife was born in Dublin, Ireland, and when a young lady came to the United States, making her way to Rochester, New York, where she became the bride of Dan Leary. Their son, John Leary, remained under the parental roof until nineteen years of age and then started to earn his living by working as a farm hand. He was employed in that manner for seven years, after which he removed to La Rose, Marshall county, Illinois, where he followed farm work for five years and also operated a farm on shares for two years. About that time he wedded Miss Mary Ellen Wills, of Lacon, Illinois, and they began their domestic life upon a rented farm of one hundred and sixty acres. In the cultivation of that property he met with success and afterward rented another tract of one hundred and forty acres, thus making three hundred acres which he farmed for ten years. He afterward left that place and rented another tract of two hundred and twenty acres on which he remained for three years. On leaving Illinois he took up his abode in Barclay township, Black Hawk county, Iowa, and after living upon a rented farm there for two years he removed to Perry township, where he rented two hundred and seventy-five acres, continuing the cultivation of that place for three years. He next came to Buchanan county and in Westburg township purchased two hundred and forty acres constituting his present home. This is today a valuable farm property. He paid sixty-five dollars per acre for the first quarter section and seventy-four dollars per acre for the remaining eighty acres. He has added many modern equipments and improvements to his place and has good farm buildings which furnish ample shelter for grain and stock, while in his sheds is found the latest improved farm machinery.\n\nIn all these years Mr. Leary has had the able assistance and encouragement of his wife, who was born in Lacon, Illinois, in 1863, a daughter of David and Mary (Martin) Wills. Her father was born in Ripley, Ohio, in 1830, a son of Samuel and Belinda (Martin) Wills, and left home at the age of fifteen years, going to Peoria, Illinois, where he learned steamboat engineering. He afterward accepted a position as engineer on one of the Mississippi river boats and was on the Jennie Lind during the Civil war. He was also an engineer on Missouri river boats and on boats on the Illinois river at different times, and in the winter seasons when navigation was impossible he worked at his old trade of coopering, which he had learned and followed in Ohio and in Peoria, Illinois. At length he retired to Henry, Marshall county, Illinois, where he passed away in 1906 at the age of seventy-six years. His wife was born in County Cavan, Ireland, in 1836, and was a little maiden of but eleven summers when brought to the United States. Her father died near Pittsfield, Massachusetts, almost immediately after their arrival, but the mother and daughter continued on their way to Lacon, Illinois, and lived upon a rented farm. Mrs. Wills now makes her home with Mrs. Leary. To Mr. and Mrs. Leary have been born five children: Charles E., George E., Ora J., Owen D. and Harry W.\n\nThe political belief of Mr. Leary is that of the democratic party. The visible evidence of his life of thrift, industry and determination is his well-kept farm, which he has gained entirely through his own efforts. His business career has at all times been creditable and his path has never been strewn with the wreck of other men's fortunes. On the contrary he has ever been reliable and trustworthy in his dealings and his prosperity has its root in indefatigable labor.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nJohn W. Leaven\n\nJohn W. Leaven, a representative and enterprising young agriculturist residing in Newton township, is the owner of a well improved farm comprising one hundred and twenty acres on section 20. His birth occurred in Benton county, Iowa, on the 5th of May, 1885, his parents being Nicholas and Anna (Lanser) Leaven, both of whom are natives of Holland. The father came to the United States with his parents when ten years of age, the family home being established in Dubuque county, Iowa. Subsequently he removed to Benton county, this state, and there successfully carried on agricultural pursuits for a number of years. In time he disposed of his property and came to Newton township, Buchanan county, here purchasing and improving a farm of three hundred and sixty acres which he operated for seven years. On the expiration of that period he put aside the active work of the fields and took up his abode in Walker, where he has since lived in honorable retirement. His wife also survives and they enjoy an extensive and favorable acquaintance throughout the community.\n\nJohn W. Leaven was reared and educated in the county of his nativity and remained under the parental roof until twenty-four years of age. He then started out as an agriculturist on his own account, cultivating rented land for two years, at the end of which time he bought from his father a tract of one hundred and twenty acres on section 20, Newton township, this county. He has made a number of excellent improvements on the property and has been actively and successfully engaged in its operation to the present time, carrying on the work of the fields in a most practical, progressive and resultant manner.\n\nOn the 25th of November, 1909, Mr. Leaven was united in marriage to Miss Mamie Burke, a daughter of Thomas and Catherine (Tarpy) Burke. Her father came to Buchanan county in an early day and has since followed farming in Newton township. Our subject and his wife have three children, namely: Anna Catherine and Bernice, who are four and two years of age respectively; and Thomas Francis, who is in his first year. Mr. Leaven gives his political allegiance to the democracy and is a Catholic in religious faith. His life is actuated by high principles and characterized by manly conduct, and in his home community he enjoys that warm personal friendship and kindly esteem which are always given in recognition of genuine worth in the individual.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nEdson A. Lewis\n\nIowa offers splendid opportunities to the agriculturist, as lands are naturally rich and arable and respond readily to the care and cultivation bestowed upon them. The man, therefore, who wisely and systematically directs his labors in the tilling of the soil can readily win success and this Edson A. Lewis has done. For a long period he was closely connected with farming interests in Buchanan county, but is now living retired in Hazleton. He was born in Essex county, New York, April 19, 1850, a son of Allen A. Lewis, whose birth occurred June 22, 1823, and who is now living in Hazleton at the unusual age of ninety-one years. He is a son of James and Daphne (Allen) Lewis, both of whom were natives of New Hampshire. The father passed away in 1854 at the age of sixty-nine years, while the mother died in the year 1879. James Lewis followed the occupation of farming, as had his father, Abel Lewis, who was one of the patriots of the Revolutionary war and served for eight years, from 1775 to 1783, as an aid on the staff of one of the generals in the Revolutionary war.\n\nAllen A. Lewis continued in the same occupation which had been followed by his father and grandfather. In early manhood he married Levisa McKenzie, who was born in the state of New York, August 28, 1825, and is now living at the advanced age of eighty-nine years. They are perhaps the most venerable couple in this county. Mrs. Lewis is a daughter of Robert McKenzie, who was born in Essex county, New York, October 20, 1792, and died at the age of sixty-seven years. His wife, Mrs. Jemimah (Strong) McKenzie, was born June 8, 1792. Robert McKenzie was private secretary to and lieutenant on the staff of a general who commanded the American troops near Lake Champlain in the War of 1812. It was in early life that Allen A. Lewis removed from New Hampshire to New York and after remaining for an extended period in that state he came to Iowa in 1864. In New York he served as captain of a rifle corps of the State Guards, but could not enter the army at the time of the Civil war because of his health. Following his removal to the west he settled in Hazleton township, this county, and began farming. He brought his fields to a high state of cultivation and also engaged extensively in stock-raising, making a specialty of handling sheep. He had one of the best improved farms of the county, his home being an attractive and substantial residence, and upon the place were also good barns and outbuildings and the latest improved machinery of the day. He was always active in republican affairs in his township and held several local offices, although he was never an aspirant for political preferment. Mrs. Lewis has always been very active in the Methodist church and today, at the age of eighty-nine, does more real church work than many of the younger women of the congregation.\n\nEdson A. Lewis acquired the rudiments of an education in the district schools, which were taught in the farmers' homes, as there were no schoolhouses at that period. Being an only son, he remained with his parents, assisting his father in the farm work, and together they acquired three hundred and five acres of land. As the years went on the son more and more largely relieved his father of the work of the farm and he has always featured stock-raising as an important branch of his business. He handles high grade stock and in this, as in other branches of his farm work, displays progressive methods, keeping in touch with all the modern ideas which mark progress along that line. He has seen Buchanan county grow in many ways, but there is no more noticeable evidence of advancement than is to be seen in the means of conveyance, for when the family first came here even buggies were very uncommon and today it is no unusual thing to find the farmer, as well as the townsman, using his motor car. Edson A. Lewis became an active worker upon the home farm when but sixteen years of age and worked persistently and energetically for a long period until, having become the possessor of a handsome competence, he put aside business cares and is now living retired.\n\nOn the 25th of December, 1878, occurred the marriage of Mr. Lewis and Miss Abbie C. Beers, who was born in New York, December 23, 1852, a daughter of Benjamin Beers, who at an early age became a cabin boy on a sloop used as a provision ship in the War of 1812. He was born in Vermont in 1799 and passed away at the age of sixty-seven years. His wife, who bore the maiden name of Susanna Barton, was an own cousin of Phoebe and Alice Gary and was born at Sandy Hill, Argyle county, New York, in 1810. Her life record covered a span of eighty-two years, being ended in 1892. Both removed in their youth to Essex county, New York, and there Benjamin Beers followed the cooper's trade. He afterward began farming in that state, owning a tract of land. In early manhood he was an active whig and upon the dissolution of that party he joined the ranks of the new republican party. His fellow townsmen, appreciative of his worth and ability, frequently called him to public office. Both he and his wife remained residents of the Empire state until called to their final rest. Mrs. Lewis had a brother, George W. Beers, who was a non-commissioned officer in the Civil war and died from wounds received at the battle of Antietam. There were twelve children in the family, of whom Mrs. Lewis was the eleventh in order of birth. Both of her parents held membership in the Baptist church and took a most active and helpful part in its work, doing all in their power to advance moral progress.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Lewis have been born three sons. Ralph Clifton, born in 1879 and living upon a farm in this county, married Clara Follmer and has two children, Ross and Mabel. Both the parents have attended the Upper Iowa University at Fayette. Harry C. died at the age of seventeen months. Allen Barton, born in 1886, is a graduate of the Oelwein Business College at Oelwein, Iowa, and married Miss Bernice Few. He is engaged in the hardware business at Whitehall, Illinois, and is a very active church worker. The eldest son is serving as a school director.\n\nAbout thirty years ago Mr. Lewis, acknowledging the power of the Supreme Being, became an active worker in the Methodist church and has done much to increase the influence of the Prairie Grove church and also of the Methodist church of Hazleton. He has reared his family in that faith and has lived to see his sons also become active in church work. Mr. Lewis has served as a teacher and as superintendent in the Sunday school, as a trustee and steward in the church, and has filled other of its offices, being now the church librarian. He is an ardent temperance worker and was a most earnest supporter of the Good Templars during its existence. He now has membership with the Modern Woodmen of America. It will be easily seen that his life is actuated by high and honorable principles and that he has labored effectively for the uplift and benefit of mankind, never deviating from a course which he believes to be right nor faltering in his allegiance to a cause which he has espoused.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nJoseph Limbert\n\nJoseph Limbert is one of the partners in a wholesale cigar and pipe business at Independence and concentrates his efforts upon the upbuilding of the trade, which has already assumed extensive and gratifying proportions. He was born in Auglaize county, Ohio, on the 30th of September, 1861, a son of Francis Limbert, who was born in Germany, January 1, 1828. The father was brought to the United States when but six years of age by his parents and in early life he learned and followed the molder's trade in Dayton, Ohio. He made the first car wheel manufactured by the Barney-Packard Manufacturing Company of Dayton and for several years followed his trade there, but after an accident which caused him the loss of the sight of one eye he turned his attention to farming.\n\nIn 1864 Francis Limbert came to Iowa, settling at Waterloo, where he resumed the molder's trade and was thus engaged until the sight of the other eye became impaired. He then took up his abode upon a farm in Westburg township, Buchanan county, in 1868, and was identified with general agricultural pursuits in the ownership and cultivation of one hundred and sixty acres of land until 1881, when he retired and established his home in Independence, where he still resides. He was married in Ohio in early manhood to Miss Margaret Sheppard, who was born in Germany in October, 1829, and came to the United States with her parents when four years of age. She died in 1910. In their family were seven children, of whom Joseph is the fifth. The father led a busy and useful life, always concentrating his energies upon his industrial or agricultural interests and taking no active part in political affairs.\n\nJoseph Limbert was but three years of age when the family came to Iowa and through much of his life has been a resident of Buchanan county. He pursued his education in the public schools of Westburg township and when twenty years of age engaged in merchandising in connection with N. E. Becker, his brother-in-law, at Allison, this state, there remaining for a year and a half. He afterward clerked for Steven Tabor in a grocery store in Independence for two years and then went upon the road as a traveling salesman for Chamberlin, Dewstoe & Company, wholesale tobacconists, whom he represented for fifteen years, or from the 1st of January, 1885, until 1900. He then severed his connection with that house and formed a partnership with his brother, Albert F. Limbert, for the conduct of a wholesale business in cigars and pipes, and bought his brother's interest in 1901. He employs four men to represent him upon the road, while he also acts as a traveling salesman. He is a jobber of the well-known cigar Wapsipinicon, which name is derived from an old Indian legend. A band of Sac warriors, led by Pinnekon, were accompanied by a band of Fox, led by Fleet Foot, on the warpath against the Sioux, to avenge the death of members of Pinnekon's tribe. On their return from a victorious battle Pinnekon with some of his braves, visited the village of the Fox and there wooed and won Wapsie, the daughter of Good Heart, chief of the Fox tribe. The evening before they were to be married and leave for the Sac village, Wapsie and Pinnekon floated down the river to Cedar Rock. There he was shot from ambush by Fleet Foot, mad from jealousy, and sank in the river with Wapsie.\n\nOn the 8th of October, 1885, Mr. Limbert was united in marriage to Miss Stella A. Kent, a native of Independence and a daughter of Silas and Roxie Ann (Welsh) Kent, both of whom were natives of New York and are now deceased. Her father was killed at the 4th of July celebration at Ashville, New York. He went to California in 1849 during the gold rush, but after a brief period there spent returned to New York, making the journey both ways by wagon train. His wife was an active member of the Methodist church. In their family were three daughters, of whom Mrs. Limbert is the youngest. She has three children: Fred K., born in 1887, who was graduated from the Independence high school and is now a traveling salesman for his father; Cora Margaret, at home; and Ralph R., who was born in 1894 and is now traveling for his father. Mrs. Limbert is an active member of the Presbyterian church and is also prominent in the social and club life of the city.\n\nMr. Limbert belongs to the Odd Fellows society, the Modern Woodmen of America and is a charter member of Wapsie Council, No. 413, United Commercial Travelers. He has never sought nor desired political office, preferring to concentrate his energies upon his business affairs, yet he is deeply interested in the welfare and progress of the city and is especially known for his activity in efforts for beautifying Independence through floral adornment.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nOscar H. Lotts\n\nA splendidly improved farm of Sumner township is that owned and occupied by Oscar H. Lotts. It is pleasantly and conveniently situated and comprises one hundred and sixty-seven acres of rich and productive land in the midst of which stands one of the finest country homes of this part of the state ? a monument to the thrift, enterprise and progressiveness of the owner.\n\nMr. Lotts was born at Hazel Green, Grant county, Wisconsin, in 1868, a son of William and Sophia (Stroble) Lotts. The father was born in Germany, in 1829, and had passed the sixty-second milestone on life's journey when called to his final rest in 1891. His wife, who was born in Germany in 1832, is still living, making her home with her son in Dows, Wright county, Iowa. Mr. Lotts was seventeen years of age and his wife twelve years of age when they came to the United States. He made his way to St. Louis and there enlisted for service in the Mexican war. He marched with Colonel Doniphan on the new Santa Fe trail from St. Louis, to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and when the war was ended marched back to St. Louis, where he went to work as a shoemaker, which trade he had previously learned. He had not even taken out his naturalization papers when he enlisted for military service, but he had come to America to be an American citizen and when he felt that the interests of his adopted country were endangered he went to the front to protect them. He lived in St. Louis for a time and worked up and down the Mississippi and Ohio rivers at his trade, going north in summer and south in winter. He was an expert workman along that line and found little difficulty in obtaining employment. In September, 1868, he removed to Iowa and purchased land in Homer township, Buchanan county. He was afterward employed in Independence by the firm of Till & Rhodes, while the family engaged in the cultivation of the farm. He had thirteen children, of whom Oscar H. was the tenth in order of birth. At the outbreak of the Civil war the father enlisted from Hazel Green, Wisconsin, in a regiment of cavalry, after which he did guard duty at Washington. He was a member of the party who tried to capture Booth, the assassin of President Lincoln, and he witnessed the shooting of the assassin when he failed to surrender. William Lotts engaged in farming and stock-raising but prior to his death removed to Independence, where he lived retired. He took an active interest in politics as a supporter of the democratic party but desired none of the rewards of office for himself. His religious faith was that of the Presbyterian church, which found in him an earnest member. His son Ed now owns the original homestead, the father having owned one hundred and sixty acres of land in Homer township.\n\nOscar H. Lotts attended the public schools of Homer township, pursuing his studies through the winter seasons, while in the summer months he assisted in the work of the fields. He continued to give his father the benefit of his services until he reached the age of twenty-two years, when he began farming for himself on the old homestead, which he cultivated for three years. He then purchased one hundred and ten acres near Rowley, and after there carrying on farming for several years sold that property and removed to Sumner township, where he now owns one hundred and sixty-seven acres, constituting one of the rich, productive and valuable farms of that locality. It is splendidly improved, lacking in none of the equipments and accessories of the model farm of the twentieth century. In its midst stands one of the finest homes of the county, built in an attractive style of architecture and thoroughly modern throughout, with running water, steam heat and all the other conveniences of the present-day home. He likewise has one of the best barns of the township. It was recently erected and is forty by sixty feet. All of the timber - black walnut and white oak - was taken from the farm. All of the buildings have been constructed with a view to convenience and sanitary conditions and the Lotts farm constitutes one of the attractive features of the landscape. In addition to tilling the soil in the cultivation of various crops, Mr. Lotts is engaged in raising thoroughbred shorthorn cattle.\n\nIn 1890 he married Irene Bowder, a daughter of Jacob Bowder and they became the parents, of two children: Delbert, who is an electrician of the United States navy, now on the boat of the American ambassador in Turkey; and Clarence. The wife and mother died in 1895, and in 1897 Mr. Lotts married Ruth Miller, who passed away in 1901. In 1908 Miss Mamie Spear became his wife. The family is prominent in the community, occupying an enviable position in social circles and enjoying the hospitality of many of the best homes in the township and in the city.\n\nIn his political views Mr. Lotts is an earnest republican, doing everything in his power to promote the growth and insure the success of his party, and he is now serving as a trustee in Sumner township. His religious faith is that of the Presbyterian church and he is interested in all that pertains to the progress and upbuilding of the community along material, political, social and moral lines.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nGeorge Lowry\n\nGeorge Lowry, one of the venerable and respected citizens of Jesup, where he is now living retired after a period of connection with agricultural interests of Buchanan county, dating from 1869, was born in Underhill county, Vermont, March 16, 1825. He is a son of James and Rebecca (Pratt) Lowry. The father was likewise a native of the Green Mountain state and was a soldier in the War of 1812. In early life he followed the carpenter's trade, but in later life engaged in agricultural pursuits. About 1835 he removed to Cass county, Michigan, making a location in the village of Adamsville, where he continued to work at his trade until 1856 or 1857, when he came to Iowa and secured a soldier's grant of land of one hundred and sixty acres in Jackson county, which he improved and to which he later added a tract of one hundred and twenty acres. He cultivated this land until the time of his demise, which occurred when he had reached the advanced age of seventy-seven years. His wife survived and subsequent to his death made her home in California with a daughter, and there her death occurred. In their family were nine children, but only two are living. The record is as follows: Ann, deceased; George, of this review Oliver, Jane, Myron, Elia and Emily, all of whom have departed this life; Harriet, now making her home in California; and Frank, who has also passed away.\n\nGeorge Lowry was reared under the parental roof and accompanied his parents on their various removals during the period of his boyhood and youth. He later learned and worked at the carpenter's trade, being thus engaged until 1850. He was married about this time, but his wife died in 1853 and he subsequently went to California by the overland route, making the journey as far as Salt Lake City with horses, but at that point he traded his horse team for a yoke of oxen and continued his journey to Bidwell's Bar, Oroville and Spanish Town. He then hired a man to drive his team and haul freight, while he spent three years at Bidwell's Bar, California, working at his trade. He was also interested in a mine, but eventually sold his interest therein for five hundred dollars. He spent five years there working at his trade and then, disposing of his team and other interests, returned to Michigan, where he purchased a farm, operating the same some seven or eight years. In 1867 he came to Iowa, operating his father's farm in Jackson county two years, on the expiration of which period he made a permanent location in Buchanan county, purchasing land in Westburg township, his place comprising one hundred and sixty acres, on which had been erected a small house. He made many improvements on the farm and added sixty acres to his original holdings, operating the same until 1911, in which year he took up his abode in Jesup, where he has since lived in honorable retirement. His undertakings both as a farmer and carpenter were attended with a gratifying measure of success, and he has long been numbered among the prosperous and esteemed citizens of his community.\n\nMr. Lowry has been twice married. He was first married about 1850 to Miss Sarah E. Mattox, of Michigan, who died three years later, leaving one son, Charles Wallace, a resident farmer of Buchanan county. His second union was with Sarah E. Plass, who was born October 14, 1843, in Elkhart county, Indiana, a daughter of John and Eliza E. (Curtis) Plass. Her father was a native of New York and was a blacksmith by trade, following this line of work in Kansas, where he died at the age of seventy-eight years. His father, William Plass, was a native of Holland, while his mother was born in Germany. Mrs. Lowry's maternal grandfather was a Scotchman and was a soldier in the Revolutionary war. Her mother, Mrs. Eliza E. Plass, departed this life at the age of seventy-seven years. Mrs. Lowry spent her early life on the state line between Indiana and Michigan and by her marriage has become the mother of one son. James R., who makes his home in Jesup.\n\nMr. Lowry has always supported the men and measures of the democratic party, but has never consented to hold public office. His wife is a member of the Methodist Episcopal church. Although he has reached the advanced age of eighty-nine years, he still retains his mental faculties unimpaired and takes a keen interest in the happenings of the times. He has always been a steady, hard-working man and the course he has followed has commended him to the confidence and good-will of all and he has an extensive circle of friends throughout Buchanan county.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nW. N. Loy\n\nW. N. Loy was born in Morrow county, Ohio, July 10, 1843, and became a pioneer settler of Buchanan county, Iowa, in 1856. In the years which have since come and gone he has not only been an interested witness of the development and upbuilding of the county, but has also borne an active and helpful part in the work which has brought about present day conditions.\n\nHe was a youth of thirteen when he came to Iowa with his parents, F. S. and Clarassy (Purvis) Loy. The father was born in Pennsylvania in 1823 and the mother in New York in 1822. When a young man F. S. Loy went to Ohio, and when old enough began farming in that state, being there connected with agricultural interests until 1854, when he made the trip overland with teams to Grant county, Wisconsin. He there purchased land when the district in which he settled bore the evidences of frontier life. In 1856 he journeyed by wagon from that state to Buchanan county and lived in Independence until 1858, devoting his time to teaming between that place and Dubuque. Independence was then a mere village and gave little promise of its later rapid and substantial development. All around was the wild prairie, dotted in summer with a million wild flowers and in winter covered by a dazzling and unbroken sheet of snow.\n\nThere were all kinds of wild game to be had and deer were seen on the town site. In 1858 Mr. Loy began breaking the sod upon the farm land which he had secured, clearing and cultivating his fields and erecting the necessary buildings upon his place. He took possession of the property in 1860 and for many years thereafter actively engaged in tilling the soil and raising stock. He made a specialty of raising shorthorns and he was also the owner of a large number of driving horses which won prizes at fairs. His shorthorns were also prize winners at the Buchanan county fairs. Mr. Loy was engaged on the construction of the first hotel, The Empire, in Independence in 1856, and in many ways was closely associated with the initial steps in the county's development and progress. He was an active republican in the local councils of his party and did much to aid in winning success for its candidates. He was also a zealous member of the Presbyterian church and contributed to the support of various churches in Independence in the early days. He died in this city at the ripe old age of eighty-five years, while his wife passed away in Sumner township at the age of fifty-eight.\n\nW. N. Loy, a youth of thirteen when the family came to Iowa, continued his education in the schools of Independence, being a pupil in one of the pioneer schoolhouses which was built about 1858. He remained at home until twenty-five years of age and then began farming, which he followed until the outbreak of the Civil war, when all business and personal considerations were put aside and he joined the \"Boys in blue\" of Company H, Twenty-seventh Iowa Volunteer Infantry. He served for eighteen months, going north on scout duty in the vicinity of St. Paul and afterward south to Tennessee, where he was largely engaged on provost duty. After the war he returned to this county, settling upon a farm in Sumner township. He acquired eighty acres, which he still owns and which he cultivated for many years with good success, although he is now living retired in Independence, where he has made his home for the past two years.\n\nOn the 15th of September, 1871, Mr. Loy was united in marriage to Miss Mary E. North, who was born in Washington county, Wisconsin, a daughter of Nelson and Isabelle (Wiley) North. Her father was born in Shoreham, Vermont, in 1824 and died in 1891. Her mother, whose birth occurred in Trumbull county, Ohio, in 1830, is still living at the age of eighty-four years, in Sumner township. Mr. North went from New England to Wisconsin when a young man, settling there before the state was admitted to the Union. He purchased land and resided thereon until 1865, in which year he came to Iowa, making the trip overland. He purchased a farm in Sumner township and in both Wisconsin and Iowa engaged in the raising of shorthorn cattle in addition to general agricultural pursuits. He also held local township offices in both states and for seven years he was county assessor in Wisconsin.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Loy were born four children: Elsie B., now the wife of John Firth, a farmer living near Independence, by whom she has one child, Susan; Frederick, who was a farmer of Sumner township and died in 1912, leaving a wife and daughter, Elsie; Elma C, now the wife of Charles O. Jones, who is connected with the State Hospital at Independence and by whom she has three children, Nellie, Sarah and Howard; and Lucy E., who married Walter M. Jones, a brother of Charles O. Jones, and they now have three children, William B., Kenneth N. and Donald F. Mr. Loy is active in the Grand Army of the Republic and his wife in the Woman's Relief Corps. They are well known as pioneer residents of the county, Mr. Loy having resided here for fifty-six years, during which notable changes have occurred, for when he came this entire district was then largely undeveloped and unimproved. There was still considerable wild game to be had in the forests, the timber was uncut and the prairies uncultivated, while the now thriving towns and villages of the county had not yet sprung into existence. Mr. Loy has borne his part in the work of general improvement as the years have gone by and can tell many an interesting tale of the early days and of the events which have marked the progress of this section of the state.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nE. F. W. Luloff\n\nE. F. W. Luloff is a self-made man in the highest and best sense of the term. He started out in business life empty-handed, having no inherited wealth or influential friends to aid him, but through his integrity and industry he has worked his way upward and is today the owner of a valuable farm property of one hundred and sixty acres on section 28, Westburg township, worth one hundred and seventy-five dollars per acre.\n\nWisconsin numbers Mr. Luloff among her native sons, his birth having there occurred in 1866. His parents were Louis and Henrietta (Gosse) Luloff. The father was born, reared and educated in Germany and eventually married Miss Henrietta Gosse. Coming to the United States, they made their way into the interior of the country, settling in Sheboygan county, Wisconsin, where the father purchased a farm of forty acres. After developing it for a time he sold that property and in 1867 came to Buchanan county, Iowa, settling in Westburg township, where he made investment in one hundred and eighty acres. He improved this by erecting substantial buildings and bringing the fields under a high state of cultivation. In fact, he added all of the accessories and conveniences of a model farm and carefully tilled his fields until 1879, when death terminated his labors. He was a veteran of the Civil war, having served for four years with the boys in blue of the Union army. He participated in the battle of Gettysburg and a number of other important engagements, which proved the strength of the Union troops and led up to the victory that finally crowned the northern arms. Politically he was a democrat and was a member of the German Lutheran church. His widow survived him for thirty-two years and passed away on the 13th of March, 1911, upon the old home place where her son, F. A. Luloff, now resides. She spent her girlhood days in Germany and was educated there. Her religious faith was also that of the German Lutheran church.\n\nNo event of special importance occurred to vary the routine of farm life for E. F. W. Luloff in his boyhood and youth, which was spent upon the home place now owned by his brother-in-law. He is indebted to the public-school system for the educational advantages which he enjoyed and later he took up farming, purchasing the William Polk farm. At a subsequent date he sold that property and invested in the Robert Stewart .farm. He holds title to three hundred and forty acres of fine land and is a substantial agriculturist of the county.\n\nOn the 3d of February, 1892, Mr. Luloff was united in marriage to Miss Ida Ehrke, a daughter of Carl and Amelia (Ebert) Ehrke. Mrs. Luloff was born in Brandenburg, Germany, in 1873. Both Mr. and Mrs. Ehrke were natives of Brandenburg, Germany. They began their domestic life in that country following their marriage in 1866. On coming to the United States, Mr. Ehrke went first to Baltimore, Maryland, and on leaving the east made his way to Independence, Iowa, where he lived for two years. He then purchased a farm of eighty acres three miles east of Jesup and occupied that place for nine years. He then sold out and bought a farm five miles south of Aurora, in Buchanan county, becoming owner of one hundred and twenty-seven acres, on which he lived for ten years and then rented the property, taking up his abode in Lamont, Buchanan county, where he and his wife now reside, the former at the age of seventy-four years and the latter at the age of seventy years. Mrs. Luloff was educated in Brandenburg, Germany, and came with her parents to the new world. She is a member of the German Lutheran church and displays many excellent traits of heart and mind. To Mr. and Mrs. Luloff have been born two children: Arthur L., who was married October 23, 1913, to Miss Adelia Harting, of Spring Creek township. Black Hawk county; and Clarence C. Both sons are upon the home farm.\n\nThe family is widely and favorably known in the county, the hospitality of many of the best homes being freely accorded them. Mr. Luloff early learned the lesson that industry is the foundation upon which all true and honorable success is built and therefore cultivated that quality with the result that is now seen, he being today the owner of two of the valuable and highly cultivated farms of Westburg township.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nA. Roy Luther\n\nA. Roy Luther, a real estate agent of Independence, and one of the native sons of the county, was born in 1880, a son of W. S. Luther, whose birth occurred in Castile, New York, April 1, 1833. In early life he was connected with a cousin in the foundry business, but at the outbreak of the Civil war all business and personal considerations were put aside and he joined the array as a member of Company A, One Hundred Forty-ninth Regiment, New York Volunteer Infantry. In the Dismal Swamp he contracted sickness which forced him to obtain a leave of absence. His trip home led to no improvement, and he was later obliged to resign. He went to the front as sergeant, and when he left the army he was holding the rank of second lieutenant. After the war he went to southern Ohio, where he remained for five years, engaged in the oil business, but he still maintained his home in Castile, New York.\n\nIn 1869 W. S. Luther arrived in Iowa, settling at Independence, where he engaged in the agricultural implement business, establishing the firm of Bartle, Luther & Brownell, which relation was maintained for fifteen years. Later he was at Ossian, Iowa, and at Austin, Minnesota, in the creamery business with C. W. Williams, and subsequently he returned to Independence. During the period of his early residence here he was also interested in a sash and door factory. It was in Castile, New York, in 1871, that he was united in marriage to Miss Anna Shea, who was born in St. John, New Brunswick, August 11, 1850. They became the parents of five children, who are yet living, all being residents of Independence, namely: W. S. and A. R., who are engaged in the real estate business; J. S., who is bookkeeper for the People's National Bank; W. P., who is associated with his brothers, A. R. and J. S., in the cigar business in Independence; and Mrs. J. B. Steinmetz, of Independence. The father died in March, 1914, in the faith of the Methodist church, in which he held membership. The mother survives.\n\nA. Roy Luther attended school in Independence and when seventeen years of age enlisted as a member of Company E, Forty-ninth Iowa Volunteer Infantry, for service in the Spanish-American War. He served for one year in Jacksonville, Florida, in Savannah, Georgia, and in Cuba, and while at Jacksonville suffered from typhoid fever. After his return he went into the post-office as junior clerk, remaining there under several different postmasters, or for a period of fourteen years. In November, 1912, he entered the real estate and insurance business, and now confines his attention to real estate dealing, being an active representative of that line of business.\n\nMr. Luther was united in marriage to Miss Maude Higby, a native of Fairbank, Iowa, and they have one child, Elizabeth May, who was born September 2, 1910. Mrs. Luther was for six years on the concert stage, in which connection she traveled all over the United States and through its colonial possessions.\n\nMr. Luther belongs to the Masonic fraternity, and is a chancellor commander of the Knights of Pythias. He also has membership with the Spanish War Veterans, and in politics he is an active republican, doing all in his power to promote the growth and further the success of the party. He has made a commendable record in business circles and possesses the enterprise and energy which overcome difficulties and obstacles and advances steadily toward the goal of prosperity.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nJ. Barney Lux\n\nJ. Barney Lux owns and occupies an excellent farm of one hundred and eighty acres in Sumner township and in addition is the owner of a quarter section of land in Westburg township. Whatever success he has achieved is the direct result of his own labors, and he early came to a recognition of the eternal truth that \"industry wins.\" He was born near Joliet, Illinois, in 1864, a son of Henry and Elizabeth (Gravenish) Lux. The father was a native of Luxemburg, Germany, born in 1835, and he died at the age of sixty-eight years. His wife, who was born in Germany about 1828, passed away in 1906. Henry Lux spent the period of his minority in his native country and then when twenty-one years of age came to the United States, settling first in Chicago. He afterward took up his abode upon a farm near Joliet, Illinois, where he remained until the early '70s, when he came to Iowa, locating near Fairbank in Hazleton township. There he became the owner of land which he cultivated and improved for about seven years. He next removed to a farm north of Independence, in Washington township, and subsequently took up his abode in Homer township, where he remained for seven years. He afterward removed to Laurens, Iowa, there remaining until his death, at which time he was the owner of farm property in Pocahontas county. He was a member of the Catholic church and was a democrat in his political belief.\n\nJ. Barney Lux is the second in order of birth and the only one of the six children in the father's family who is now living in Buchanan county. Here he attended the country schools and when not busy with his text-books his time was given to the task of cultivating and improving the fields. He started out independently when twenty-one years of age and was employed by neighboring farmers until he reached the age of twenty-six. He then began farming upon the place of his father-in-law, which he cultivated for several years. He carefully saved his earnings until his industry and economical expenditure had brought him a sum sufficient to enable him to purchase property, and that he has succeeded in his undertakings is indicated in the fact that he is now the owner of one hundred and eighty acres of land in Sumner township and one hundred and sixty acres in Westburg township. Thereon he is engaged in the raising of Poland China hogs and Durham cattle and both branches of his business are bringing to him substantial success, his entire time being given to his farm interests.\n\nMr. Lux was joined in wedlock to Miss Alvina Stewart, a native of this county. They have had no children of their own, but the kindness of their hearts has prompted them to rear four, two girls and two boys, to whom they have given every advantage of home and school life, caring for them until they have been able to care for themselves. Two of the number are married and all four are a credit to the careful rearing of their foster parents.\n\nMr. Lux is an Odd Fellow and in politics is a republican. He has served as township trustee and in other local offices but has little aspiration along that line, preferring to concentrate his energies upon his business affairs. He has been a resident of Buchanan county for four decades and has therefore witnessed much of its growth and development. He has taken an active interest in the work of progress as the years have gone by and his aid can be counted upon to further beneficial public measures. Moreover, his life record shows what can be accomplished in business when energy and determination point out the path to success.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nH. T. Lynch\n\nH. T. Lynch, president of the Northern Iowa Land Company and interested in the Eastern Kansas Oil Company, Limited, of Moran, Kansas, is well known as a progressive and successful business man, thoroughly familiar with every phase of land operations. Illinois numbers him among her native sons, his birth having occurred in Lee county, that state, in 1862. His father, Thomas J. Lynch, was a native of Elmira, New York, and wedded Rebecca Clendenning, who was born in Lycoming county, Pennsylvania. In early life Thomas J. Lynch learned and followed the wagon-maker's trade and continued in that line of business after his removal to Illinois. In 1870 he came to Iowa, settling at Rowley, Buchanan county, after which he entered the railroad employ. For about six years he lived in Rowley and then went to West Branch, where he also engaged in railroading, spending about two years at that place. He became the owner of land in Buchanan county, which he farmed after leaving the railroad service at Rowley. He next removed to Nebraska, where he lived retired.\n\nH. T. Lynch attended public schools in Illinois and in Rowley, Iowa, and at the age of sixteen years began learning telegraphy at the latter place. For about four years he was agent for the Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Railroad and then turned his attention to the real-estate business in Kansas City, Missouri, where he remained for six years, giving his entire attention to that line of activity. In 1891 he came to Independence and here continued in the land business, organizing the Northern Iowa Land Company, of which he became the first president, and so continues. This company owns about two thousand acres of land in the different states in which it operates and its well directed business affairs result in substantial sales annually. Mr. Lynch is also interested in the Eastern Kansas Oil Company, Limited, of Moran, Kansas, and his capable direction of his business affairs has won for him gratifying returns.\n\nIn 1887 Mr. Lynch was married to Miss Jessie F. Todd, a daughter of Morris Todd and a native of Buchanan county. Four children have been born to them: H. C, a civil engineer, who is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin and is now with the C. E. Bryan Engineering Company of Chicago; Percy L., who is looking after his father's farming interests in southeastern Kansas; Frank T., who is attending Grinnell College at Grinnell, Iowa; and Clara R., who is pursuing her education at Lake Forest, Illinois. All four children are graduates of the high school at Independence.\n\nThe family attend the Presbyterian church, of which Mrs. Lynch and children are members. Mr. Lynch is republican in his political views and is identified with no lodges or clubs. He has always followed an independent course, adhering closely to the principles in which he believes, yet never interfering with the rights of others. He has preferred always to concentrate his energies upon his business affairs and his persistency of purpose is the potent element in his growing success.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nLafayette McBane\n\nLafayette McBane, who follows farming in Liberty township, was born in Tuscarawas county, Ohio, in 1850, a son of George and Sabina (Eisnogle) McBane, both of whom were natives of Tuscarawas county. In early life the father followed farming in Ohio, where he owned lands, and on removing westward settled in Buchanan county, Iowa. The journey was made by boat to Dubuque, from which point he came overland to this county and secured government land in Liberty township. He at once began the arduous task of clearing this and preparing it for cultivation and in 1850 built a log house, which was the pioneer home of the family. The conditions of frontier life were everywhere in evidence. Many Indians were still to be seen and there was much game to be had. The prairies were covered with their native grasses, the timber was largely uncut and there was little indication of the rapid changes which were soon to transform the district from a wild, unsettled region into one of the populous and prosperous counties of the commonwealth. Mr. McBane was the owner of two hundred and fifty-five acres of land and carried on general farming, success attending his efforts more and more largely as the years went on. He was always interested in the public affairs of the community and cooperated in many plans for the betterment of existing conditions. He lived to see marked advancement here. The population of the county was very sparse at the time of his arrival and Independence was only a village with a few houses and a store or two, while Quasqueton contained nothing but a postoffice. He saw all this changed and rejoiced in what was accomplished. He helped to build the first church and the first schoolhouse in Liberty township, and thus aided in hiving the foundation upon which later progress has been made.\n\nLafayette McBane was the eldest of the four sons in his father's family and, therefore, assumed heavier responsibilities in the early days. He pursued his education in a log schoolhouse which stood in the forest near his home and when not busy with his text-books gave his time and attention to the farm work, aiding his father up to the time of his marriage, when he began farming on his own account, having in the meantime purchased land. He has added to his original holdings until he is now the owner of four hundred and forty-five acres of valuable farm land in this county and has successfully tilled his fields until the crops harvested have made him one of the substantial farmers of the township. He also raises Hereford cattle and Duroc Jersey hogs and this has become an important feature of his business. At the present time he is in large measure living retired, enjoying the fruits of his former toil, and the most envious cannot grudge him his success?so honorably has it been won and so worthily used.\n\nIn 1874 Mr. McBane was united in marriage to Miss Galena Shoemaker, of Montour county. Pennsylvania, born in 1855, a daughter of Charles and Mary (Reed) Shoemaker. Her father owned a large tract of land in the Keystone state and there resided until 1857, when he removed westward with his family to Rock county, Wisconsin, where he remained until 1866. He then again turned his face toward the setting sun and became a resident of Byron township, Buchanan county, having traveled overland to his destination. Here he became a pioneer settler and aided in the establishment of churches and schools and in the early material development of the county. Mrs. McBane was one of a family of six children and by her marriage has become the mother of three sons. Lemuel, a farmer owning land in Liberty township, wedded Elizabeth Braden, a representative of one of the pioneer families of the county. Charles is a bookkeeper in the Hospital for the Insane at Independence. George, who married Leta Meyers, is on his father's farm in Byron township.\n\nWhile Mr. McBane still resides upon the old homestead farm, he largely leaves its care and cultivation to his son, advising with him concerning its management and further cultivation. He is a democrat, but has never been an office seeker. He feels, however, the deepest interest in the welfare of his township and county and has been a helpful factor in promoting public progress along various lines. He has been practically a lifelong resident of this county and has deep attachment for its institutions and its people, many of whom are numbered among his stanch friends.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nMary (Cowie) McCarty\n\nThe life record of Mrs. Mary (Cowie) McCarty is one which has gained for her the esteem and admiration of all who know her, for she has accomplished much that others would have failed to do. When left a widow with four small children, she not only kept them together but came to a new country and through business ability and close application has succeeded in accumulating a comfortable competence. She was born in County Limerick, Ireland, where she was reared, and in young womanhood she crossed the Atlantic to the United States, settling first in Detroit, Michigan, where she formed the acquaintance of Michael McCarty, who sought her hand in marriage. He, too, was a native of County Limerick, Ireland, and as a young man had come to the new world, making his way to Detroit, where he was employed to the time of his death, which occurred when he had advanced but a little way beyond the milestone that marks arrival at adult age. At the time of his death they were the owners of a little home in Detroit.\n\nIn 1869 or 1870, not long after the demise of her husband, Mrs. McCarty with her four children, the eldest then six years of age, came to Iowa, living with and working for a sister of her deceased husband on a farm in Byron township. She saved her money until her industry and economical expenditure had brought her a sum sufficient to enable her to purchase eighty acres of land, and as her sons grew in years and strength they worked in the fields, more and more largely relieving their mother. Mrs. McCarty, however, did not scorn the out-of-door work and on more than one occasion drove the team which hauled the harvester or did other work in the fields. She displayed splendid business management and ability in the control of her business affairs and added to her land from time to time until she is now the owner of two hundred acres, constituting a very valuable property improved with splendid farm buildings. The home place is especially well improved. There is a comfortable and attractive residence, a large barn, the latest improved machinery and all the other accessories of modern farm life. The family have always worked together, keeping but one pocket book and sharing with each other in all the adversity as well as in the prosperity which has come to them. They now have a herd of pure blooded Hereford cattle equal to any to be found in the state.\n\nTo Mr. and Mrs. McCarty were born two daughters and two sons: Mary, at home; Lizzie, the wife of Michael Greeley, a resident farmer of Byron township; John, at home; and Daniel, who married Clara Lorang, a native of New York state, and resides on the old homestead. Mrs. McCarty is now about eighty years of age but is still active, hale and hearty. She and her family are members of the Catholic church. She certainly deserves great credit for what she has accomplished, showing that she possesses excellent business ability, initiative and executive force, as well as those womanly qualities which have made her a devoted mother.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nArthur L. McClernon\n\nArthur L. McClernon, filling the office of county recorder of Buchanan county, was born in Independence on the 6th of March, 1878, a son of Hugh and Bridget (Maroney) McClernon, The father was born in Belfast, Ireland, and the mother in County Clare, Ireland. He was a saddler by trade, having learned the business in Scotland, and he became a harness dealer ere leaving his native country. In 1864 he sailed for the United States and for some years remained in New York city, after which he came to Independence about 1868 or 1869. Here he engaged in the saddlery business in connection with his uncle, the partnership existing until his uncle's death about two years later. Mr. McClernon afterward remained in the business until his demise, which occurred on the 31st of March, 1903. For several years he had survived his wife, who died in 1896. In public affairs Mr. McClernon took a deep interest and for many years filled the office of alderman, exercising his official prerogatives in support of many measures for the general good.\n\nArthur L. McClernon was the second in order of birth in a family of five children. He attended the public schools of Independence and when seventeen years of age took up the saddlery business in connection with his father, with whom he was associated for about ten years or until the latter 's death. He then took over the business, which he continued alone for about six years. At the end of that time he disposed of his stock and went upon the road as a traveling salesman for a large wholesale saddlery company, whom he thus represented for about three years. He was then elected to his present office.\n\nIn his political views he has always been a stalwart democrat and in the fall of 1912 he was elected county recorder of Buchanan county, assuming the duties of the office on the 1st of January, 1913. He had previously served as alderman for a number of years. He now devotes his entire time and attention to his official duties and is making a creditable record in that connection. His religious faith is that of the Roman Catholic church. He is widely and favorably known in Independence, where he has spent his entire life, and many of his staunchest friends are those who have known him from his boyhood to the present time.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, Chicago, Illinois, 1914, submitted by Mary Kay Krogman.\n\nAlexander T. McDonald\n\nMany of the business enterprises in Independence and a number of movements for the welfare of the community along lines of civic progress owe much of their success to the efforts of Alexander T. McDonald, who is one of the most prominent men of Buchanan county. He was for many years a merchant of Independence, but has now retired from active business, although he is still interested in a number of concerns. The marked success which he has achieved has been due entirely to his own initiative and business acumen, as he began life without capital or the aid of influential friends. Although he has accomplished much and has been an important figure in many lines of activity in his county, he is quiet, unassuming, approachable and affable.\n\nMr. McDonald was born in Manilla, Ontario, Canada, on the 14th of March, 1850, a son of Donald and Ann (Edwards) McDonald. His father was born in Canada in 1825, his parents being Archibald and Flora McDonald, natives of the highlands of Scotland, where their marriage occurred. They emigrated to Canada in 1820 and the father operated a farm near Toronto, Canada, where he passed away when about seventy years of age, and his wife died when about seventy-five. They were members of the United Presbyterian church in good standing. Donald McDonald, the father of our subject, was reared upon the home farm and educated in the schools of the neighborhood. His marriage occurred in Canada and he continued to reside in that country for some time afterward, but subsequently removed to the United States, arriving in Buchanan county, Iowa, in 1875. He purchased one hundred and sixty acres of land in Byron township and began the improvement of his farm, which he operated for a number of years. He eventually sold the place, however, and removed to Independence, living retired until his death, which occurred in 1898 when he was seventy-three years of age. He was a member of the Presbyterian church and his political allegiance was given to the republican party. His wife was born in London, England, but accompanied her parents, Edward and Ann (Ashton) Edwards, to Canada when but a child. Both her father and mother were also natives of England. The former was a farmer and was also engaged in the banking business and accumulated a considerable fortune. He died in 1847 when but forty-eight years of age and his widow survived for many years, dying in 1880 when eighty years of age. They were both members of the Church of England. The mother of our subject was reared and educated in Canada and is still living at the age of eighty-eight years, making her home in Independence. Her church membership is with the Presbyterian denomination. By her marriage she became the mother of seven children, namely: Alexander T., the subject of this review; Flora, the wife of Walter Thompson, a farmer living in Byron township; Edward, of Seattle, Washington, government pure food and drug commissioner for Washington and Oregon; John, who previous to his death in 1911 was a merchant of Tacoma, Washington; Richard, who is engaged in the mercantile business in Tacoma; and Elizabeth and Sarah, both living with their mother in Independence.\n\nAlexander T. McDonald passed his boyhood under the parental roof and was educated in the public schools. In 1872, when a young man of twenty-two years, he came to Independence and engaged in the mercantile business in partnership with his uncle, Thomas Edwards, this association being continued for about twenty years. The firm operated a branch store at Brandon which Mr. McDonald managed, and they also had another branch at Oelwein, Iowa, Mr. Edwards eventually sold his interest in the business to James M. Romig and Mr. McDonald continued as a partner of Mr. Romig for a number of years, but he finally sold his interest in the enterprise to Mr. Romig and then engaged in the wholesale glove and mitten business. He was associated in that undertaking with James A. Wells under the name of the McDonald Glove Company. This concern carried on business for about eight years but in 1907 was sold out to Wells Keagy & Company. The McDonald Company had about five traveling men upon the road and sold their product in Iowa, Minnesota and the Dakotas. Mr. McDonald was highly successful both as a merchant and manufacturer, as he conducted all of his business dealings upon the principle of fairness and justice to all, and his name stood for a high standard of commercial ethics, he also at one time owned an interest in his brother's store in Tacoma. He has invested heavily in land and owns about nine hundred and sixty acres of land in Dickey county. North Dakota, a part of which is improved and which he rents. He also holds title to about three thousand acres in Martin county. North Carolina, which he expects to put upon the market in small tracts. Until 1914 he was the owner of one hundred and sixty acres of land in Buchanan county, but a short time ago he sold it, receiving one hundred and fifty dollars per acre. He has a half interest in two store buildings in Independence and is one of the most substantial citizens of the place.\n\nMr. McDonald was united in marriage on the 17th of September, 1882, to Miss Clara Romig, a native of Wisconsin, born November 13, 1856, and a daughter of Isaac and Elizabeth Romig. Her father was born in 1814. The family came to Iowa at an early day in the history of the state and settled in Brandon, where Mr. Romig engaged in farming and also in mercantile business until his death, which occurred on the 13th of May, 1887. His wife survived for eight years, dying June 25, 1895. Mr. and Mrs. McDonald have no children of their own but adopted his brother John's daughter, Nellie, when she was but a small child and reared her as their own. She is now the wife of Perry J. Miller, a real-estate man of Independence.\n\nMr. McDonald is a republican but has never been willing to accept local office. He was, however, for a number of years one of the board of trustees of the Hospital for the Insane, which is located at Independence, being appointed to that office by the state legislature. Fraternally he belongs to Independence Lodge, No. 87, A. F. & A. M.; Ahohab Chapter, No. 21, R. A. M.; and Kenneth Commandery, No. 32, K. T. Both he and his wife are consistent members of the Presbyterian church. In addition to his business connections previously mentioned, he is a stockholder and director of the Commercial State Bank of this city and was also for a time engaged in the manufacture of lumber here and was likewise interested in a number of the early business enterprises of Independence. He has done a great deal toward developing the commercial and industrial life of the county and has been associated in business with many people. It is much to his credit that his dealings have been invariably straightforward and honorable and all those who have been brought in contact with him hold him in the highest esteem and respect.\n\nHistory of Buchanan County, Iowa, and its People, Harry Chappell and Katharyn Chappell, published by S.
