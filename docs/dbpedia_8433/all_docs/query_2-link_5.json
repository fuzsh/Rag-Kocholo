K r xi sufficiently popular to have attained to some standard pronunciation, how. much more it is sc>wit:h words such as ace famine, which have no popular currency, and which indeed were ma'&^pet primarily^ t»2b^ sj5okeji but to be used in books, and as to the pronunciation of which, or the question whetHet>/'$iey are pronoirtSp'gialb^, no thought was given by their makers? On several occasions, the Editor has app fifed directly to the introducer of a word, to know how he pronounces it, or means it to be pronounced, and has rectfttd the answer, that he has never thought of its pronunciation, does not presume to say how it ought to be pro- nounced, and leaves it to people to pronounce as they like, or to the DICTIONARY to say what is the right pronunciation. This, of course, reverses the natural order of language, in which speech comes first, and writing is only its symbolization ; for here the first thing is the written symbol addressed to the eye (and reminding the reader perhaps more or less distinctly of other written symbols which are to be found in the Greek Lexicon), while, for 'pronunciation', anything passes muster which suffices to recall the written symbol in question ; just as any reading of a mathematical formula passes muster, if it enables an auditor to write down the formula again. In dealing with words in which two or more pronunciations are current, these pronuncia- tions are given in the Dictionary ; in the case of those in which no standard exists, an attempt has been made to follow analogies so far as they go, and at least to mark the place of the stress ; but sometimes it has not been possible to do even this. The preparation of this volume has taken a much longer time than any of the promoters of the work Difficulties of anticipated. The time has been consumed chiefly in two directions : first, with the larger articles, as those on the work' AT, BY, BUT, BE, BEAR, BREAK, the construction of which has occupied many days, sometimes even weeks. The mere study of the result, arranged in some degree of order, gives little idea of the toil and difficulties encountered in bringing into this condition what was at first a shapeless mass of many thousand quotations. And in this part of the work there was practically no assistance to be got from the labours of our pre- decessors ; the attempt has never been made before to exhibit such a combined logical and historical view of the sense-development of English words. Our own attempts lay no claim to perfection ; but they represent the most that could be done in the time and with the data at our command. The other direction in which much time has been consumed is the elucidation of the meaning of obscure terms, sometimes obsolete, some- times current, belonging to matters of history, customs, fashions, trade, or manufactures. In many cases, the only thing known about these was contained in the quotations, often merely allusive, which had been collected by the diligence of our readers. They were to be found in no dictionary, or, if mentioned in some, were explained in a way which our quotations evidently showed to be erroneous. The difficulty of obtaining first- hand and authoritative information about these has often been immense, and sometimes insurmountable. Ten, twenty, or thirty letters have sometimes been written to persons who, it was thought, might possibly know, or succeed in finding out, something definite on the subject ; and often weeks have passed, and 'copy ' advanced into the state of 'proof ', 'proof into 'revise', and ' revise' even into 'final', before any results could be obtained. It is incredible what labour has had to be expended, sometimes, to find oat the facts for an article which occupies not more than five or six lines ; or even to be able to write the words \" Derivation unknown \", as the net outcome of hours of research and of testing the statements put forth without hesitation in other works. These experiences have often called to mind the classical words in which Dr. Johnson recounts in his Preface Dr. Johnson's his similar difficulties : \" When first I engaged in this work, I resr/ived to leave neither words nor things unexamined, and pleased myself with a prospect of the hours which I should revel away in feasts of literature, with the obscure recesses of northern learning which I should e*ter and ransack ; the treasures with which I expected every search into those neglected mines to reward my labour, and the triumph with which I should display my acquisitions to mankind. When I had thus enquired into the original of words, I resolved to show likewise my attention to things ; to pierce deep into every science, to enquire the nature of every substance of which I inserted the name, to limit every idea by a definition strictly logical, and exhibit every production of art or nature in an accurate description, that my book might be in place of all other dictionaries whether appellative or technical. But these were the drean* of a poet doomed at last to wake a lexicographer. I soon found that it is too late to look for instruments, when the work calls for execution, and that whatever abilities I had brought to my task, with those I trust finally perform it. To deliberate whenever I doubted, to enquire whenever I was ignorant, would have protracted the undertaking without end, and, perhaps, without much improvement ; for I did not find by my *irst experiments, that what I had not of my own was easily to ba xii NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY. be obtained : I saw that one enquiry only gave occasion to another, that book referred to book, that to search was not always to find, and to find was not always to be informed : and that thus to pursue perfection, was, like the first inhabitants of Arcadia, to chase the sun, which, when they had reached the hill where he seemed to rest, was still beheld at the same distance from them. I then contracted my design, determining to confide in myself, and no longer to solicit auxiliaries, which produced more incumbrance than assistance : by this I obtained at least one advantage, that I set limits to my work, which would in time be ended, though not completed.\" Assistance If the present writer has been more successful than Dr. Johnson in finding what he searched for, it has been owing to the ready good-will and helpful co-operation of many scholars and specialists, most of them men whose time is much occupied, but whose interest in this undertaking has led them willingly to place some of it at the Editor's service, and freely to contribute of their knowledge to the perfection of the work.

It has not, as a rule, been possible to submit to contributors or revisers the articles for which their assistance was asked ; it will, therefore, be understood that none of the foregoing are responsible for the use made of their help in the Dictionary. If they have been misunderstood or misrepresented, the Editor alone must bear the blame. Still warmer acknowledgements are due to those gentlemen who, not occasionally, or for special words, but systematically and continuously, have read the proofs, to improve the work as a whole by criticism, or to enrich it by additions. And first of all, and above all others, to Mr. Fitzedward Hall. D.C.L., who, as a voluntary and gratuitous service to the history of the English Language, has devoted four hours daily to a critical examination of the proof-sheets, and the filling up of deficiencies, whether in the vocabulary or the quotations. Those who are familiar with the pages of his Modern English, his English Adjectives in -able, and his numerous articles and papers on special points of English, know with what an amazing wealth of evidence the author illustrates the history of every word, idiom, or grammatical usage, upon which he touches ; the whole of his stock of quotations, references, and indices, he has generously placed at the service of the Dictionary, and there is scarcely a page to which he has not added earlier instances of words or senses than those which our Readers had found ; many rare words and rare senses have been added entirely from his stores. Mr. Henry Hucks Gibbs has also read all the proofs from the commencement of the work, and en- riched them systematically by valuable criticism and additions : many articles owe much of their accuracy and completeness to his assiduous care. The Rev. J. B. Johnston, B.D., of Glasgow, has also read all the proofs since the beginning of B ; and this voluntary help has been specially valuable from the experience in the practical work of the Dictionary which he had previously gained as an assistant in the Scriptorium. Professor Eduard Sievers has read, in proof, all the etymological articles on Teutonic words, besides advising the Editor in the preparation of the more difficult ones, to the accuracy and completeness of which he has made many additions. M. Paul Meyer has similarly contributed to the correctness of the etymological articles on Romanic words, and has revised the proofs of the more difficult ones which have been submitted to him. Dr. F. J. Furnivall has been constant with his help on all points requiring further investigation, and, by personal search in the British Museum Library and elsewhere, has saved the Editor many hours of work. xiv NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY. The following portions, before being finally taken in hand by the Editor and his staff in the Scriptorium, were sub-edited by the lady and gentlemen here named, whose gratuitous services were an important contribution to the accomplishment of the work.

I have also to acknowledge the collaboration, in parts of this volume, of Mr. Henry Bradley, whose editorial work was more particularly devoted to part of the words in Bo-, BR-, and Bu-. Those who have assisted in the Scriptorium with Volume I, or parts of it, are Mr. Alfred Erlebach. B.A., Mr. John Mitchell, the Rev. J. B. Johnston, M.A., B.D., Mr. G. F. H. Sykes, B.A.; Mr. F. E. Bumby, Mr. Walter Worrall, B.A., Mr. A. T. Maling, B.A., Mr. R. H. Lord, M.A., Mr. C. G. Balk, Mr. H. F. P. Ruthven, Mr. C. G. Crump, B.A., and Mr. G. Parker, whose services are gratefully acknowledged. After all the help which has been received, and which has contributed so much to the completeness of the Dictionary, the element of time still remains inexorable ; it is still, as in the days of Dr. Johnson, imperative that limits be set to research, in order that the work may ' in time be ended, though not com- pleted '. Accordingly, since the close of Volume I, it has been the aim of the Editor and his staff to maintain such a regular rate of progress as will ensure the production of one Part a year. As Mr. Henry Bradley (whose co-operation in the present volume is mentioned above) is now at work independently, with a staff of assistants, on a third volume, there is reasonable ground to expect that the production of the work henceforth will be twice as rapid as it has been hitherto.

The value of quotations is, of course, independent of their number, and many valuable contributions have been received from friends whose names do not appear in these lists ; especially from those who have devoted their attention to supplying our desiderata, or who, keeping themselves acquainted with the current progress of the work, have been always ready to undertake searches in connexion with groups of words at which the Editor and his staff were actually working.

Davies, M.A., who had already published his Supplementary English Glossary, has desired that work to be treated as a contribution to the Dictionary, and has presented all his subsequent gleanings to it. The quotations which we use from Mr. Davies's printed work are, as in similar cases, distinguished by (D.). Col. Yule was similarly good enough to put at our disposal the proofs of his Glossary of Anglo- Indian Colloquial Terms, as it was passing through the press. Quotations thence supplied are marked (Y.). GENERAL EXPLANATIONS. THE VOCABULARY. THE Vocabulary of a widely-diffused and highly-cultivated living language is not a fixed quantity circumscribed by definite limits. That vast aggregate of words and phrases which constitutes the Vocabulary of English-speaking men presents, to the mind that endeavours to grasp it as a definite whole, the aspect of one of those nebulous masses familiar to the astronomer, in which a clear and unmistakable nucleus shades off on all sides, through zones of decreasing brightness, to a dim marginal film that seems to end nowhere, but to lose itself imperceptibly in the surrounding darkness. In its constitution it may be compared to one of those natural groups of the zoologist or botanist, wherein typical species forming the characteristic nucleus of the order, are linked on every side to other species, in which the typical character is less and less distinctly apparent, till it fades away in an outer fringe of aberrant forms, which merge imperceptibly in various surrounding orders, and whose own position is ambiguous and uncertain. For the convenience of classification, the naturalist may draw the line, which bounds a class or order, outside or inside of a particular form ; but Nature has drawn it nowhere. So the English Vocabulary contains a nucleus or central mass of many thousand words whose ' Anglicity ' is unquestioned ; some of them only literary, some of them only colloquial, the great majority at once literary and colloquial, — they are the Common Words of the language. But they are linked on every side with other words which are less and less entitled to this appellation, and which pertain ever more and more distinctly to the domain of local dialect, of the slang and cant of ' sets ' and classes, of the peculiar technicalities of trades and processes, of the scientific terminology common to all civilized nations, of the actual languages of other lands and peoples. And there is absolutely no defining line in any direction : the circle of the English language has a well-defined centre but no discernible % •£ \\ ^>> ^ •*. o O <t \\ 4 ^ C O M M O N y< „,«•**' L°fa \"\"»««,. 5? circumference *. Yet practical utility has some bounds, and a Dictionary has definite limits : the lexicographer must, like the naturalist, ' draw the line somewhere ', in each diverging direction. He must include all the ' Common Words ' of literature and conversation, and such of the scientific, technical, slang, dialectal, and foreign words as are passing into common use, and approach the position or standing of ' common words ', well knowing that the line which he draws will not satisfy all his critics. For to every man the domain of ' common words ' widens out in the direction of his own reading, research, business, provincial or foreign residence, and contracts in the direction with which he has no practical connexion : no one man's English is all English. The lexicographer must be satisfied to exhibit the greater part of the vocabulary of each one, which will be immensely more than the whole vocabulary of any one. In addition to, and behind, the common vocabulary, in all its diverging lines, lies an infinite number of Proper or merely denotative names, outside the province of lexicography, yet touching it in thousands of points, at which these names, and still more the adjectives and verbs formed upon them, acquire more or less of connotative value. Here also limits more or less arbitrary must be assumed. * The above diagram will explain itself, as an attempt to express to the eye the aspect in which the Vocabulary is here presented, and also some of the relations of its elements typical and aberrant. The centre is occupied by the ' common ' words, in which literary and colloquial usage meet. ' Scientific ' and ' foreign ' words enter the common language mainly through literature ; ' slang ' words ascend through colloquial use ; the ' technical ' terms of crafts and processes, and the ' dialect ' words, blend with the common language both in speech and literature. Slang also touches on one side the technical terminology of trades and occupations, as in ' nautical slang,' ' Public School slang,' ' the slang of the Stock Exchange,' and on another passes into true dialect. Dialects similarly pass into foreign languages. Scientific terminology passes on one side into purely foreign words, on another it blends with the technical vocabulary of art and manufactures. It is not possible to fix the point at which the ' English Language' stops, along any of these diverging lines. C xviii NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY. The Language presents yet another undefined frontier, when it is viewed in relation to time. The living vocabulary is no more permanent in its constitution than definite in its extent. It is not to-day what it was a century ago, still less what it will be a century hence. Its constituent elements are in a state of slow but incessant dissolution and renovation. ' Old words ' are ever becoming obsolete and dying out : ' new words ' are continually pressing in. And the death of a word is not an event of which the date can be readily determined. It is a vanishing process, extending over a lengthened period, of which contemporaries never see the end. Our own words never become obsolete : it is always the words of our grandfathers that have died with them. Even after we cease to use a word, the memory of it survives, and the word itself survives as a possibility ; it is only when no one is left to whom its use is still possible, that the word is wholly dead. Hence, there are many words of which it is doubtful whether they are still to be considered as part of the living language ; they are alive to some speakers, and dead to others. And, on the other hand, there are many claimants to admission into the recognized vocabulary (where some of them will certainly one day be received), that are already current coin with some speakers and writers, and not yet 'good English', or even not English at all, to others. If we treat the division of words into current and obsolete as a subordinate one, and extend' our idea of the Language so as to include all that has been English from the beginning, or from any particular epoch, we enter upon a department of the subject, of which, from the nature of the case, our exhibition must be imperfect. For the vocabulary of past times is known to us solely from its preservation in written records ; the extent of our knowledge of it depends entirely upon the completeness of the records, and the completeness of our acquaintance with them. And the farther back we go, the more imperfect are the records, the smaller is the fragment of the actual vocabulary that we can recover. Subject to the conditions which thus encompass every attempt to construct a complete English Dictionary, the present work aims at exhibiting the history and signification of the English words now in use, or known to have been in use since the middle of the twelfth century. This date has been adopted as the only natural halting-place, short of going back to the beginning, so as to include the entire Old English or ' Anglo-Saxon ' Vocabulary. To do this would have involved the inclusion of an immense number of words, not merely long obsolete but also having obsolete inflexions, and thus requiring, if dealt with at all, a treatment different from that adapted to the words which survived the twelfth century. For not only was the stream of English literature then reduced to the tiniest thread (the slender annals of the Old English or Anglo- Saxon Chronicle being for nearly a century its sole representative), but the vast majority of the ancient words that were destined not to live into modern English, comprising the entire scientific, philosophical, and poetical vocabulary of Old English, had already disappeared, and the old inflexional and grammatical system had been levelled to one so essentially modern as to require no special treatment in the Dictionary. Hence we exclude all words that had become obsolete by 1150. But to words actually included this date has no application; their history is exhibited from their first appearance, however earl}-. Within these chronological limits, it is the aim of the Dictionary to deal with all the common words of speech and literature, and with all words which approach these in character; the limits being extended farther in the domain of science and philosophy, which naturally passes into that of literature, than in that of slang or cant, which touches the colloquial. In scientific and technical terminology, the aim has been to include all words English in form, except those of which an explanation would be unintelligible to any but the specialist ; and such words, not English in form, as either are in general use, like Hippopotamus, Geranium, Aluminium, Focus, Stratum, Bronchitis, or belong to the more familiar language of science, as Mammalia, Lepidoptera, Invertebrata. Down to the Fifteenth Century the language existed only in dialects, all of which had a literary standing : during this period, therefore, words and forms of all dialects are admitted on an equal footing into the Dictionary. Dialectal words and forms which occur since 1500 are not admitted, except when they continue the history of a word or sense once in general use, illustrate the history of a literary word, or have themselves a certain literary currency, as is the case with many modern Scottish words. It is true that the dialectal words are mostly genuine English, and that they are an essential part of the contents of a. Lexicon totius Anglicilatis; but the work of collecting them has not yet been completed; and, even when they shall have been collected, the phonetic variety in which they exist in different localities, and the want of any fixed written forms round which to group the variations, will require a method of treatment different from that applicable to the words of the literary language, which have an accepted uniform spelling and an approximately uniform pronunciation. CLASSIFICATION OP THE VOCABULARY. For the purposes of treatment in this Dictionary, words and phrases are classed as: (i) Main Words, (2) Sub- ordinate Words, (3) Combinations. MAIN WORDS comprise (i) all single words, radical or derivative (e.g. Ant, Amphitheatrically\\ (2) all those compound words (and phrases) which, from their meaning, history, or importance, claim to be treated in separate articles (e.g. Afternoon, Almighty, Almsman, Air-pump, Aitch-bone, Ale-house, Forget- me-not, Adam's apple, All fours}. The articles in which these are treated constitute the Main Articles. SUBORDINATE WORDS include variant and obsolete forms of Main Words, and such words of bad formation, doubtful existence, or alleged use, as it is deemed proper, on any ground, to record. The Main and Subordinate Words are arranged in a single alphabetic series, the former being printed in a larger, the latter in a smaller type. COMBINATIONS, when so simple as either to require no explanation, or to be capable of being briefly explained in connexion with their cognates, are dealt with under the Main Words which form their first element, their treatment forming the concluding part of the Main Article. GENERAL EXPLANATIONS. xix MAIN WORDS. Every Main Word is treated, once for all, under its modern current or most usual spelling ; or, if obsolete, under the most typical of its latest spellings; the form or spelling thus chosen being considered the Main Form of the word. Occasionally a form or spelling of an obsolete word has been assumed, which is not actually found in the quotations adduced, but is in accordance with the usual analogies of the language, as seen in kindred words. Thus Aiinoyotisly is given as the Main Form, on the analogy of annoy, annoyous, although only anoyously has actually been found. All other important forms of each word, current or obsolete, are entered in their alphabetical order, as Subordinate Words, and are there concisely referred to the Main Form under which they are treated. When a word which is historically one has different grammatical relations, it is treated as one word only, and the different relations are indicated by the division of the article into sections (marked A, B, C). This refers especially to substantives used also attributively (or objectively), as in ' an ounce of gold, a gold watch, ^/(/-coloured scales ' ; to adjectives used substaniively or pronominaUy, as in ' the catholic church, a good catholic ; that book, that is mine, the words thai he spoke ' ; to adjectives used adverbially, as in ' the according voice of national wisdom ', ' he acted according to orders ' ; to adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions, originally the same word, as ABOUT, AFTER, SINCE, As ; and of course a fortiori to verbs used transitively and intransitively, as ' to abide battle, to abide at home,' which, in some dictionaries, are reckoned as two distinct words. In this Dictionary, 'transitive and intransitive seldom appear even as leading divisions of a verb, but, in accordance with the actual history of the word, in most cases only as varying and often temporary constructions, subordinate lo the different senses, and liable to pass one into the other in the development of the language. Thus a verb at one time intransitive finally takes a simple object, through the phonetic decay of a dative or genitive ending, or the elision of a preposition, and is accounted transitive, without any change either in form or meaning (e.g. ANSWER) ; and a verb used transitively, likewise without change of meaning and form at length becomes intransitive, through the regular modern English suppression of the reflexive pronoun (e.g. Kzek. xx. 22 I withdrew mine hand ; Mark iii. 7 Jesus withdrew himself to the sea; Revised Version, Jesus with- drew to the sea). The history of ANSWKR or WITHDRAW would be misrepresented by splitting them each into two words, or even by classifying their senses in a manner which would conceal these historical relations. But verbs uniform in their stems with substantives or adjectives, as LAND, to LAND, DRY, to DRY, ABSTRACT, to ABSTRACT, are, of course, distinct words ; as are adjectives and adverbs which, through ' levelling ' of terminations, have become identical in form, though originally distinct, as ALIKE a., ALIKE adv. ; and substantives and adjectives which have always been identical in form, but were of separate introduction into the language, and have separate histories, as ANIMAL sb., ANIMAL a. Where a word originally one has been, in the course of its history, split into two, whether with distinction of sense, as ALSO, As, or merely as synonyms, as ANT, EMMET, APPRENTICE, PRENTICE, both modern forms are treated as separate words, and there is a reference from one article to the other. Where two original words of identical or similar form have coalesced into one, the modern word is treated as one or two, according lo practical utility. When they are treated as two words, these come, of course, immediately together : see ALLAY, ALLOW, AMICE. The treatment of a Main Word comprises :— I. The Identification, II. The Morphology, III. The Signification, IV. The Illustrative Quotations. I. The Identification includes : 1. The Main Form, i.e. the usual or typical spelling, as already described. (In certain cases where two spellings are in current use, both are given in the Main Form, as ANALYSE -YZE, CHEMISTRY CHYMISTRY, INFLECTION INFLEXION.) Words believed to be obsolete are distinguished by prefixing t ; non-naturalized or partially-naturalized words, by ||. In the case of rare words, especially those adopted or formed from Latin equivalents, it is often difficult to say whether they are or are not obsolete. They are permanent possibilities, rarely needed, but capable of being used whenever they are needed, rather than actually discarded terms. To these and other words, of which the obsoleteness is doubtful, the f is not prefixed. As to their citizenship in the language, words may be classed as Naturals, Denhens, Aliens, and Casuals. NATURALS include all native words like /at/ier, and all fully naturalised words like street, rose, knapsack, gas , parasol. DENIZENS are words fully naturalized as to use, but not as to form, injlcxion, or pronunciation, as aide-de-camp, locus, carte-de-visile, table d'hote. ALIENS are names of foreign objects, titles, etc., which we require often to use, and for which we have no native equivalents, as shah, geyser, cicerone, targum, baekshcesh, sepoy. CASUALS are foreign words of the same class, not in habitual use, which for special and temporary purposes occur in books of foreign travel, letters of foreign correspondents, and the like. There are no fixed limits between these classes, and the constant tendency is for words to pass upwards from the last to the first. But, while casuals and aliens from barbarous languages are readily and quickly naturalized, words from French and the learned languages, especially Latin, which are assumed to be known to all the polite, are often kept in the position of denizens for centuries : we still treat phenomenon as Greek, genus as Latin, aide-de-camp as French. The words marked with || in the Dictionary comprise Denizens and Aliens, and such Casuals as approach, or formerly approached, the position of these. Opinions will differ as to the claims of some that are included and some that are excluded, and also as to the line dividing Denizens from Naturals, and the position assigned to some words on either side of it. If we are to distinguish these classes at all, a line must be drawn somewhere. 2. (Within parentheses) the Pronunciation or symbolization of the actual existing form of the word, as explained here- after. A recognized difference of pronunciation is also shown, with occasional notes on the diversity. Of Obsolete Words usually no pronunciation is given, but the place of the stress or accent, when ascertained, is indicated by a ' turned period 'after the stress-vowel, as Alfe'res, A'nredly. In partially naturalized words two pronunciations are often given, viz. the native (or what passes for the native), and one conformed more or less to English analogies ; in actual use many intermediate varieties may be heard, cf. rendcz-vous, envelope, environs, prestige, chignon, recitative, Koran, caviare, and the like. 3. The Grammatical Designation, i.e. the Part of Speech, or subdivision of the same, as/«-j. pron., vbl. sb. See the list of Abbreviations. All words having no Grammatical Designation are substantives: the letters sb. are employed only where required to avoid ambiguity. r xx NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY. 4. In words of more or less specific use, the Specification, as Mus. (in Music), Bot. (in Botany), etc. 5. The Status, where there is any peculiarity, as Obs. (obsolete), arch, (archaic or obsolescent), colloq. (colloquial), dial. (now dialectal, though formerly in general use : words exclusively dialectal are not inserted, except on special grounds). Here also is added, when applicable, the epithet rare, with ~', or ~\", indicating that only one, or no actual instance of the use of the word is known to us. Words apparently employed only for the nonce, are, when inserted in the Dictionary, marked nonce-wd. 6. The principal earlier Forms or Spellings, with their chronological range indicated by the unit figure of the century, thus 3-6 = i3th to i6th cent.; i standing for all centuries down to noo. These figures also correspond broadly to distinct periods of the language ; viz. i Old English or 'Anglo-Saxon'; 2 (izthc.) Old English Transition (.'semi-Saxon'); 3 (i3th c.) Early Middle English; 4 (i4th c.) Late Middle English; 5 (ijthc.) Middle English Transition; 6 (i6th c.) Early Modern or Tudor English ; 7 (i7th c.) Middle Modern English ; 8, 9 (i8th and igth c.) Current English. 7. The Inflexions, i.e. plural of substantives, and principal parts of verbs, when other than the ordinary -s, -ed. II. The Morphology or Form-History [within heavy square brackets] includes : — 1. the Derivation, or Etymology, showing the actual origin of the word, when ascertained. 2. The Subsequent Form-history in English, when this presents special features, as phonetic change, contraction, corruption, perversion by popular etymology or erroneous association. 3. Miscellaneous facts as to the history of the word, its age, obsolescence, revival, refashioning, change of pronunciation, confusion with other words. In the light of historical Etymology, an English word is (i) The extant formal representative, or direct phonetic descendant, of an earlier word ; that is to say, it is the earlier word itself, in a later or more recent form, as it has been unconsciously changed in the mouths of the successive generations that have used it. For example, ACRE (now really /'•kaj), formerly aker, is the extant form of Old English cecer, this the later form of prehistoric eecr, the special English form of acr, air, this of West Germanic akra, this, through earlier akra-z, of Original Teutonic akro-z, this of original Aryan or Indo-European agro-s; and agros, akroz, akraz, akra, akr, cecr, cecer, aker, aker, acre («'-kaa), are all merely successive and temporary forms of one and the same word, as employed during successive periods. The word has never died ; no year, no day probably, has passed without its being uttered by many : but this constant use has so worn it down and modified its form, that we commonly look upon acre as a distinct word from agros, with which it is con- nected by many intermediate forms, of which only a few have been discriminated in writing, while the finer and more intimately connecting links have never been written. This phonetic descent is symbolized by (:— ); thus ACRE: — OE. cecer : — O.Teut. *akro-z. If not the extant formal representative of an original Teutonic word, an English word has been (2) adopted (a.), or (3) adapted (ad.), from some foreign language; i.e. it is a word once foreign, but now, without or with intentional change of form, used as English; or it has been {informed on or from (f.) native or foreign elements, or from a combination of them. Adoption is essentially a popular process, at work whenever the speakers of one language come into contact with the speakers of another, from whom they acquire foreign things, or foreign ideas, with their foreign names. It has pre- vailed in English at all periods from the earliest to the latest times : inch, pound, street, rose, cat, prison, algebra, antic, orange, tobacco, tea, canoe, focus, meerschaum, are adopted words. Adaptation is essentially a learned or literary process; it consists in adapting a foreign word to the ' analogies of the language ', and so depriving it of its foreign termination. Examples are Latin or Greek words reduced to their stem form, or receiving recognized English endings. Latin words which lived on in Gaul there underwent regular phonetic changes, whereby they at length became ' French ' ; in this living French form they were adopted in Middle English ; but in more recent times numerous Latin words have been taken into English directly, yet modified, in their terminations, in the same way as if they had lived on in French and been thence adopted into English *. Such English words originate in an adaptation of the Latin original, not in an adoption of its French (or other Romance) extant representative. Formation consists in the combination of existing words or parts of words with each other, or with living formalives, i.e. syllables which no longer exist as separate words, but yet have an appreciable signification which they impart to the new product. Formation is the chief natural process by which the vocabulary of a language is increased : it is both popular and learned ; in its popular application, it gives such words as * The French words adopted before 1400 were generally taken from the Anglo-French, or French spoken for several centuries in England, where they had undergone further phonetic change. It was in strict conformity with linguistic facts that Chaucer told of his Prior esse : ' Frenssh she spak ful faire and fetisly, After the scole of Stratford at-te Bowe, For frenssh of Parys was to hire vnknowe : ' for the Anglo- F\"rench dialect of the I4th century was distinct not only from Parisian, but from all dialects of continental French. In its origin a mixture of various Norman and other Northern French dialects, afterwards mixed with and greatly modified by Angevin, Parisian, Poitevin, and other elements, and more and more exposed to the overpowering influence of literary French, it had yet received, on this side the Channel, a distinct and independent development, following, in its phonology especially, English and not continental tendencies. As the natural speech of the higher and educated classes, it died out in the fourteenth century ; but it maintained a kind of artificial existence for a longer period, and was used (in an in- creasingly debased form) for writing law-reports down to the I /th century, in which stage it still influenced the spelling of English words. Its forms survive in many of onr terminations : armour, colour, glorious, gracious, envious, perilous, arrival, espousal, language, enjoy, benefit, gaoler, caitif, are the actual Anglo-French forms, as distinct from those of continental Old and Modern French. As a rule, it may be assumed that the original form of every Middle English word of French origin was identical with the Anglo-F>ench form ; and that, where a gap appears between the earliest known English form of a word and its Old French equivalent, that gap would be filled up by the recovery of the Anglo-French and earliest English form. It was not until the fifteenth century, and chiefly at the hands of Caxton, that continental French forms and spellings began directly to influence our language.

Much of the terminology of modern science is identical, or as nearly so as the forms of the languages permit, in English and French, in English, French, and German, or sometimes even in most of the European languages. It would often be as difficult as useless to ascertain in which language a particular scientific term first appeared in print, this being, linguistically, a mere accident : the word was accepted as common property from the beginning. In such cases, modern formation (mod. f.) is employed to intimate that it is uncertain in what modern language, English or continental, the word was first used; it may indeed have occurred first in some modern Latin work, either of English or foreign authorship. Phonetic descent (: — ), adoption (a.), adaptation (ad.), \\\\orA~formation (f.) are usually combined. under the term derivation; but, until we know in which of them, singly or in combination, a word has originated, we do not know its Etymology. In this Dictionary, words originally native are traced to their earliest known English, and, when possible, to their earliest Teutonic form, authenticated and illustrated by the cognate words in other Teutonic languages and dialects ; those of foreign origin are referred to the foreign word or elements whence they were immediately adopted or formed. In certain cases these foreign words, especially the French, are themselves traced to their antecedent forms or component elements ; but these antecedents are considered only with a view to the clearer comprehension of the history and use of the word in English. To trace the remoter history of these words, and determine their Aryan or other ' roots,' is no part of their English history. Of many words it has to be stated that their origin is either doubtful or altogether unknown. In such cases the historical facts are given, as far as they go, and their bearing occasionally indicated. But conjectural etymologies are rarely referred to, except to point out their agreement or disagreement with the historical facts ; for these, and the full discussion which they require, the reader is referred to special treatises on etymology. III. The Signification (Sematology). Some words have only one invariable signification ; but most words that have been used for any length of time in a language have acquired a long and sometimes intricate series of significations, as the primitive sense has been gradually extended to include allied or associated ideas, or transferred boldly to figurative and ana- logical uses. This happens to a greater extent with relational words, as prepositions (cf. About, After, Against, And, Anenl] than with notional words, as verbs and nouns ; of these, also, it affects verbs and adjectives more than substantives ; of substan- tives, it influences those which express actions, qualities, and mental conceptions (cf. Account), more than those which name, and are, as it were, fixed to material objects. Yet even these latter have often acquired many different senses. Thus, Board names a material object ; yet compare : a thin board, a frugal board, a card-board, board and lodgings, passengers on board, to fall over board, to sit at the council board, a board school, the Board of Trade, to tread the boards, a sea.-Aoard parish. The order in which these senses were developed is one of the most important facts in the history of the word ; to discover and exhibit it are among the most difficult duties of a dictionary which aims at giving this history. If the historical record were complete, that is, if we possessed written examples of all the uses of each word from the beginning, the simple exhibition of these would display a rational or logical development. The historical record is not complete enough to do this, but it is usually sufficient to enable us to infer the actual order. In exhibiting this in the Dictionary, that sense is placed first which was actually the earliest in the language : the others follow in the order in which they appear to have arisen. As, however, the development often proceeded in many branching lines, sometimes parallel, often divergent, it is evident that it cannot be adequately represented in a single linear series. Hence, while the senses are numbered straight on i, 2, 3, &c., they are also grouped under branches marked I, II, III, &c., in each of which the historical order begins afresh. Subdivisions of the senses, varieties of construction, &c., are marked a, b, c, &c. ; subdivisions of these, which rarely occur, (<?.), (b.), (c.), &c. So far for words of which the senses have been developed in English itself. But in adopted or adapted words which had already acquired various significations in the language (e.g. Latin) from which they were taken, it often happens that the order in which the senses appeared in English does not agree with the natural order in which they were developed in the original language. The English order is in fact accidental. For it was not in the primary sense that the word was first taken into English, but in a figurative, transferred, or specialized use, as an ecclesiastical, legal, grammatical, or medical term, which perhaps took root in our language, and here received a development of its own. Subsequently, however, familiarity with the Latin language and literature sometimes led to a fresh adoption of the word in the primary sense, or to a sudden extension of English usage, so as to include the primary sense, which thus appears as of quite late origin in English. In such a case it is not possible to make the historical order of the senses in English agree with the logical order in which they arose in Latin or other previous language ; and every such word must be treated in the way which seems best suited to exhibit the facts of its own history and use. Instances of such words are afforded by ADVKNT, AGONY, AN- NUNCIATION, APPEND. Obsolete Senses, like obsolete words, have t prefixed, so as to be at once distinguished from those now in use. Under ^f are included Catachrestic and erroneous uses, confusions, and the like. To a great extent the explanations of the meanings have been framed anew upon a study of all the quotations for each word collected for this work, of which those printed form only a small part. But the labours of other scholars in this, the most successfully cultivated department of English lexicography, have not been neglected. In particular, the explanations of Dr. Johnson and of his editor Archdeacon Todd have often been adopted unchanged (within inverted commas and marked J. or T.), as have those of N. Bailey, and other early lexicographers, to whom it is only right to give credit for original work which has become the common property of all their successors. . xxii NEW ENGLISH DICTIONARY. IV. The Quotations illustrate the forms and uses of the word, showing the age of the word generally, and of its various senses particularly; the earliest and, in obsolete words or senses, the latest, known instances of its occurrence being always quoted. Except in special cases, where the letters of the Greek alphabet, a, ft y, &c. are used to separate parallel forms, the illustration of the forms is subordinated to that of the senses : the quotations illustrating each sense immediately follow the explanation. They are arranged chronologically, so as to give about one for each century, though various considerations often render a larger number necessary. The original spelling is retained, as an essential part of the history of the language. But merely graphical or typographical devices, such as contractions, erratic presence of capitals, and (in seventeenth-century books) employment of italics to emphasize words, phrases, or whole passages, are not reproduced ; and simple blunders, which would mislead the reader, are tacitly corrected. The recent use of italics, to indicate a doubt about the status of a word, is retained as being often of historical importance. As to letters, the Old and Middle English ' thorn' (}> = M) and Old English 'divided d' or 'the' (8; usually only a variant of ' ]>', though some- times distinguished, as in the KEY TO PRONUNCIATION) are retained; also ME. ' open-tailed g', or ' yea' (3=/ initially, gh finally). In Old English, the letter g had the form ' J, g ' (a peculiar British development of the Roman G). Besides the original sound in go, gild, this letter had also (at least in later Old English) a fricative sound as in German ta^f, or Irish louy// (or both', and a palatalized sound, approximately —y mye,yes. After the Norman Conquest the modern forms ' g, g ', were introduced (from French) for the sound in go, and the new sound in .finder ; but the OE. form (in process of time slightly modified) was retained for the sounds in \\ougA, yes, till the introduction of Printing. In printing Old English, modern scholars sometimes reproduce the contemporary 's,g' (as is done by Sievers, in his Angelsaehsischt GrammatiK), but more commonly substitute modern ' g, g '. The adoption of cither course exclusively in this work would have broken the historical continuity of the forms ; in the one case, we should have had the same word appealing in the eleventh century as ' sold ', and in the twelfth century as ' gold ' ; in the other, the same word written in the eleventh century ' ge ' and in twelfth century ' 3e '. To avoid this, both forms are here used in Old English, in accordance with the Middle English distinction in their use ; thus, ' gold ', ' so ', ' decs '• The reader will understand that ' g ' and ' s ' represent the same Old English letter, and that the distinction made between them is purely editorial (though certainly corresponding to a distinction of sound in OE.). For ME. the form ' 3 ' commonly used in reprints is employed, so that OE. ' sc ' becomes ME. ' se ', modern ' ye ' ; OE. ' senos, senoh 't ME. ' yno;, inouj ', mod. ' enough '. It is to be distinctly borne in mind that the quotations are not merely examples of the fully developed use of the word or special sense under which they are cited : they have also to illustrate its origin, its gradual separation from allied words or senses, or even, by negative evidence, its non-existence at the given date. It would often have been desirable to annotate the quotations, explaining the purpose for which they are adduced ; but the exigencies of space render this impossible, and they are therefore left to speak for themselves. Some help has been offered by enclosing within [. . .] quotations given for what may be called subsidiary purposes. The need to keep the Dictionary within practicable limits has also rendered it necessary to give only a minimum of quotations selected from the material available, and to make those given as brief as possible. It is to be observed that in their abridged form they simply illustrate the word, phrase, or construction, for which they are given, and do not necessarily express the sentiments of their authors, though in no case have they been intentionally curtailed in such a way as to misrepresent their original meaning. This, however, may always be ascertained, and the full context recovered, by help of the exact reference to author, work, and passage, which it is a special feature of this work to give. Here also the utmost conciseness has been indispensable ; the exact date renders the surnames only of authors in most cases sufficient ; the titles of books are so abbreviated as to be recognizable by those who know them, or to be adequate for the purpose of reference to a library or bibliographical catalogue. This is all that is now attempted; but a list, hereafter to be given, of all the authors and works quoted, with the editions read, and the Readers who extracted them for the Dictionary will give the full title of each work and form of abbreviation used, as well as indicate the mode of reference to each. Mean- while, it may be stated that, in order to make the latter as simple as possible, an approximately uniform value has been given to different forms of numerals. Thus, in all works, Roman Capitals (IV.) stand for rolume ; small capitals (iv.) for book, par/, or other larger division; lower-case letters (iv.) for chapter or its equivalent; and Arabic numerals (42) for page. Other divisions, as marginal section — the most useful of references, since it is not dependent on the paging of a particular edition — are indicated by special marks. In the Essayists of the i8th c. (Spectator, &c.), of which the editions are innumerable, the reference T is to the paragraphs of each essay or number, counted for this purpose. In Poetry, the reference iv. iv. 42 means act, scene, line; or canto, stanza, line, (rarely book, canto, stanza?) as the work may be divided. In Shaksfiere (where the reading is that of the First Folio, 1623) the lines of the Globe edition are referred to. In dramatic works, or other long poems, of which the lines are not numbered, the Arabic numerals mean the page of the edition quoted. Single poems are, whenever possible, cited by name and line; in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, every edition of which has its own order and numbering, the only useful mode of reference was to number the lines of each piece, tale, or prologue, separately. As neither MSS. nor editions agree as to the junction of the Canon's Yeoman's Prologue and Tale, the two have been reckoned as one piece. Melibaus and the Parson's Tale are referred to by the versicles as divided in the Six-text edition, but numbered separately. In many works, both prose and verse, the only available reference has been to the volume and page of a specified edition, which is thus indicated, ' Wks. 1802, III. 178 '. Wherever practicable, a work is dated and quoted from its first edition : if the reference is to a later edition (as has been often unavoidable), the date of this is added (within parentheses) to the reference *. It is necessary to be * In the case of some well-known and often-quoted works, where the reference is always to a standard edition or modern literal reprint, it has not been thought necessary to insert the date of it. This omission occurs in the case of nearly all the publications printed by the Early English Text and other similar Societies, the repiints of Mr. Arber, and the following among other works: — Aneren Rivile (ed. 1853), BKLLENUENE Livy (ed. 1821), LD. BEKNERS freissarl (ed. 1812), BURKE Works (ed. 1808), FABYAN Chronicle (ed. 1811), GOWER Confessio GENERAL EXPLANATIONS. xxiii precise on this point ; for later editions often change the spelling : hence a quotation from them is valid for the use of the word, but not for its spelling, at the date assigned. It is hoped that reasonable accuracy has been attained in dates and references : in the former, absolute accuracy is in many cases impossible, and, for the purposes of this work, not essential ; in the latter, errors are inevitable in the work of so many years and so many readers. SUBORDINATE WORDS. Under this head are here included: — i. (and mainly) Obsolete and variant forms of words, when these are so far removed in spelling as not to come closely before or after the regular form, or readily to suggest it. These words are concisely referred to the Wain Form to which they belong, with an explanatory synonym, when the latter is itself obsolete ; as Almucantar, -urie, obs. ff. (i.e. obsolete forms of) ALMACANTUR; Abugge, obs. w. and s.w. f. (= obsolete western and south-western form of) ABYE v.; Almoise, -moyse, var. (= variant of) ALMOSE, Obs. alms. To economize space variant forms which differ from the regular form only in the doubling of a single consonant or the converse, as Appert for APERT, Aple for APPLE, or in the interchange of u, v or i, j, are not usually inserted. 2. Irregular or Peculiar inflexions of Main Words. 3. Alleged words of bad or doubtful formation, or doubtful existence, and spurious or erroneous forms found in Dictionaries, or cited from single passages in authors, but having little or no claim to re- cognition as genuine constituents of the English vocabulary: their character is pointed out, and their history briefly given. COMBINATIONS. Under this term are included all collocations of simple words in which the separate spelling of each word is retained, whether they are formally connected by the hyphen, or virtually by the unity of their signification. The formal union and the actual by no means coincide ; not only is the use of the hyphen a matter of indifference in an immense number of cases, but in many where it is habitually used, the combination implies no unity of signification ; while others, in which there is a distinct unity or specialization of meaning, are not hyphened. The primary use of the hyphen is grammatical: it implies either that the syntactic relation between two words is closer than if they stood side by side without it, or that the relation is a less usual one than that which would at first sight suggest itself to us, if we saw the two words standing unconnected. Thus, in the three sentences, ' After consideration had been given to the proposal, it was duly accepted,' ' After consideration the proposal was accepted,' 'After-consideration had shown him his mistake,' we have first no im- mediate syntactic relation between after (conjunctive adverb) and consideration ; second/)', the relation of preposition and object ; thirdly, the relation of attribute and substantive, closer than the first, less usual than the second (since after is more commonly a preposition than an adjective). But after-consideration is not really a single word, any more than subsequent consideration, fuller consideration ; the hyphen being merely a convenient help to the sense, which would be clearly ex- pressed in speech by the different phrase-accentuation of a-fter considera-tion and a-fter consider a' (ton. And as this ' help to the sense ' is not always equally necessary, nor its need equally appreciated in the same place, it is impossible that its use should be uniform. Nevertheless after-consideration, as used above, is on the way to become a single word, which reconsideration (chiefly because re- is not a separate word, but also because we have reconsider) is reckoned to be ; and indeed close grammatical relation constantly accompanies close union of sense, so that in many combinations the hyphen becomes an expression of this unification of sense. When this unification and specialization has proceeded so far that we no longer analyze the combination into its elements, but take it in as a whole, as in blackberry, postman, newspaper, pro- nouncing it in speech with a single accent, the hyphen is usually omitted, and the fully developed compound is written as a single word. But as this also is a question of degree, there are necessarily many compounds as to which usage has not yet determined whether they are to be written with the hyphen or as single words. Many specialized combinations, indeed, are often not even hyphened : especially is this the case with descriptive names, formed of a substantive preceded by an adjective or possessive case, or followed by a phrase, as Aaron's Rod, All fours, Blue John, Jack by the hedge, Jack in a box, Jew's harp, Sea Anemone, Sea Horse. There is thus considerable difficulty in determining to what extent combinations are matters for the lexicographer, and to what extent they are merely grammatical. While no attempt is made fully to solve this difficulty, combinations formal and virtual are, for practical purposes, divided into three classes: First, those in which each word retains its full meaning, the relation between them falling under one or other of the ordinary grammatical categories. Of these, specimens merely are given, at the end of each Article, which are printed in italics, and illustrated collectively by a few quotations. Second: Combinations of which the signification is somewhat specialized, but still capable of being briefly explained in a few words, in connexion with their cognates. These also are concisely treated at the end of the Main Article, where they are printed in small Clarendon type in an alphabetical series, and illustrated by quotations arranged in the same order. When these are very numerous the word illustrated is distinguished in the quotation by prefixing *, in order that it may catch the eye more readily. Third: Combinations which attain in specialization of sense to the position of full compounds Amanlis (ed. 1857), HALL Chronicle (ed. 1809), HOLINSHED Chronicle (ed. 1587), HOLLAND Pliny (ed. 1634), JOHNSON Works (ed. 1787), LUTTRELL Brief Relation (ed. 1857% MAUNDEVII.E Travels (ed. 1839), SIR T.

These are enumerated (in SMALL CAPITALS) at the end of the Main Article, and thence referred to their alphabetical place, where they are treated in all respects as Main Words. All Compounds and Combinations of interest or importance will thus be found either in their alphabetical order, or under the word which constitutes their first element. But phrases are treated under their leading word, as on account of, under ACCOUNT ; and specific names, like Sea Anemone, Black Alder, under their generic names ANEMONE, ALDER, etc. Sea Anemone is considered (linguistically) as a kind of Anemone, but Adam's Needle not as a kind of Needle, nor Mouse-ear as a kind of Ear. PRONUNCIATION. The pronunciation is the actual living form or forms of a word, that is, the word itself, of which the current spelling is only a symbolization — generally, indeed, only the traditionally-preserved symbolization of an earlier form, sometimes imperfect to begin with, still oftener corrupted in its passage to our time. This living form is the latest fact in the form-history of the word, the starting-point of all investigations into its previous history, the only fact in its form-history to which the lexicographer can personally witness. For all his statements as to its previous history are only reproductions of the evidence of former witnesses, or deductions drawn from earlier modes of symbolizing the forms of the word then current, checked and regulated by the ascertained laws and principles of phonology. To register the current pronunciation is therefore essential, in a dictionary which deals with the language on historical principles. It would be manifestly absurd, for example, to trace the form-history of the first numeral from the Old Teutonic am, through the Old English an, to the Middle English oan, on, oon, one, and to stop short at the last of these, without recognizing the modern English wz>n, which represents a greater change within the last three and a half centuries than had previously taken place in 1 500 years. The fact that the written history, as embodied in the spelling, accidentally stops short at the Middle English one, makes it all the more necessary to give the modern history and current form of the living word, since of these no hint is otherwise conveyed. But the living word is sound cognizable by the ear, and must therefore be itself symbolized in order to reach the understanding through the eye. The most that can be done is to provide a careful and consistent means of representing it, in which the symbols should agree with the actual values of letters used either in the earlier or later stages of the language. For historical purposes the earlier values of letters are the more convenient ; and accordingly, the symbols here adopted are the Roman letters, in most cases retaining the values which they had when first employed to write English ; to these are added such modifications and amplifications as are required by the phonetic changes and discriminations which distinguish a modern from an ancient language. The reference of the symbols to a permanent standard, such as the Visible Speech of Mr. A. Melville Bell, will be made elsewhere : in the following table they are merely illustrated by words which exemplify the sounds. As a general principle, each simple sound is represented .by a single symbol. In choosing additional symbols, regard has been had to former usage or analog)' ; thus 'x' was the Old English symbol for a in at, ' 9 ' the Icelandic for o in not ; 3 (reversed e) is used for a sound most commonly written e, as in err, evet ; » {reversed a) for a sound expressed by a in Sanskrit and Oriental languages, as in Chandarnagar or Chundernugger. In the consonants, i (reversed r) is used for the vocalized retracted r in he?\" ; ' J> ' and ' S ' are taken from Old English, with their powers discriminated ; J (*/')> 3 C2/')' an(i 9 (ng) fr°m the Phonotypy of Messrs. Pitman and Ellis. In the Vcnvels, ordinary (or short\") quantity is unmarked ; long quantity is marked by (\") ; medial quantity, when distinguished, by (' ) ; obscure quality by (\"). In modern English speech, vowels are regularly obscured in syllables that have neither primary nor subordinate stress, especially in those that follow the main stress ; they then approach, or fall into, the sound of the mid-mixed vowel or 3. But, in syllabic or rhetorical pro- nunciation, or in singing, the original vowels are more or less heard ; by writing these with the mark of obscuration, we are enabled to indicate at once the theoretical and the actual pronunciation. The vowel in pass, command, variously identified by different speakers with a in man, and a in father, is symbolized by the avowedly ambiguous a. Similarly, the doubtful length of the o in off, soft, lost (by some made short as in got, by some long as in Corfe, by others medial}, is indicated by {>. In cases where sounds are identified by some English speakers, and distinguished by others, it has been thought best to mark the distinction, which may be disregarded by those to whom it is unknown ; thus, the sounds in iir and fur are discriminated by the majority of orthoepists, though commonly identified by natives of the south of, England, to whom our Ki and fw will thus indicate the same sound. So 9 and p, in watch, Scotch, are identified by many. The generally recognized Diphthongs in by, boy, bow, few, pure, are expressed by ai, oi, au, i», iii ; and the diphthong in ay (yes) by ai (when distinguished from that in eye, si). After r, the simple u, u, take the place of iii, iii ; which is also the usage of many speakers after /, as in lieu, h<nar, l«re, where others make, or try to make, a diphthong. This doubtful diphthong we write hi, 'u, as 1!», I'D'a. The half-sized ', u, are also used to express the second element in the imperfect or doubtful diphthongs in fate, note (f<Tlt, nout), which many orthoepists treat only as long S, 6 ; the half-sized » is similarly used to express the non-recognized vowel-element developed between I, e, o, u, and J or r, as in pier, pare, pore, -poor, weary (pi'i, wi»'ri). Syllables are not divided ; but, when two vowels come together and do not make a diphthong, they are separated by the break (,)> which in this case divides two syllables. The break is not written between the two vowels in groups such as -ial, -ian, in pitlor-ial, Fen-ian, which are pronounced either in two syllables, or (familiarly) in one. It is written between t and J, d and 3, in compounds like knightship (uitijip), where the two consonants do not form a consonantal diphthong, as tj and dg ordinarily do, as in pitcher, lodging (pi'tjai, If-d^ir^. Also in words like antacid, ant ambulacra! (jc:nt|ae'sid, Ee:nt|CcmbittltTl'kral) where the first syllable is ant-, not an-. And it is used in 'combinations and long words with two accents, to separate the two accentual groups into which the word naturally falls, as in plano-convex, agamogenesis (pU7i:no,k(vnvt-ks, The main Stress or Syllabic Accent is indicated by a ' turned period ' (•) after the vowel, whether long or short (not after the consonant at the end of the syllable) ; subordinate stress is marked (;), only where it attains to the strength of secondary accent, in long words and compounds, as cty-stalltea'tion, a-fter-wi-tled ; the ordinary subordinate stress, as in the first syllable of telesco'fic, anlece-dent, which is not more than tertiary, is not marked, being sufficiently indicated by the clearness of the vowel (telfskfpik, ocnt/srdcnt). In loose combinations, of which both elements have a main accent, the stronger stress is occasionally indicated by (••) as in a-fter-cou-nsel. XXV KEY TO THE PRONUNCIATION. I.

A («•')> the first letter of the Roman Alphabet, and of its various subsequent modifications (as were its prototypes Alpha of the Greek, and Aleph of the Phoenician and old Hebrew); representing originally in English, as in Latin, the ' low-back-wide ' vowel, formed with the widest opening of jaws, pharynx, and lips. The plural has been written aes, A's, As. 11340 H AMI-OLE Pr. Consc. 481 And by bat cry men knawban Whether it be man or weman, For when it es born it cryes swa . If it be man it says a ! a !

Forms of A, and Sounds historically represented by it : see INTRODUCTION. The sounds now repre- sented by A are thus symbolized in this work : — (1) e1 in name, n^'m. (2) e „ bare, be»i. (3) x „ man, msen. (4) a in father, f 00 9 \" w\"ter, (6) 9 „ want, wont. vHedj, mse'rid.^. se'pare't (-ft, -rt). se'paret (-/t). senta'jktik. 1/7'naj, amrba. The vowel in chant, past, varies with different speakers from 3 to 4, with various intermediate sr'nds, and is here, with intentional ambiguity, indicated by (7) a as tfant, past (without determining the quantity or quality). In unaccented syllables these vowels are modified, and obscured ; thus : — (8) e (i) in village, marriage, (9) e> (e) „ separate, v. (10) e (<*) „ separate, adj. (n) & „ antarctic, (12) a „ lunar, amoeba, ('3) 9 a a!*thority, i and 2 are also commonly represented by the di- graphs ai, ay, as in pam, pay, pair (pe'n, pJ', pe»a) ; and 5 by an, aw, as in laud, law (Igd, 1§). Ai, ay rarely represent a diphthong (ai), as in ay, Isa/ah (ai, sizai'a, also si, aiz^i'a) ; an is a diphthong (au) only in foreign words. Except in syllabic, or strictly rhetorical utterance, 10, n, 12 are practically = 3 (e in water, wg'tai) ; and 13 = 6 (as in collect, kole'kt), sinking collo- quially to 3 (jbp'riti, 6b(mti, abp-riti), to which a'lso 9 (but not 8) falls in careless speech. In rapid utterance this 3 may become a mere voice glide ('), or entirely disappear, as separate adj. se'paret, se'psrst, se'p'rst, se'prat. These phonetic variations in actual speech are reflected in variant spellings like mackarel, mackerel, mackrel ; abanet, abnet ; caravel, carvel ; Catharine, Catherine, Cath- rine; dependant, dependent; and common 'mis- takes' in spelling, such as seperate. II. The letters of the alphabet, or some of them, are also used to indicate serial order and distinguish things in a series, as the notes of the musical scale, the 'quires' or sheets of a book, classes of ships, propositions in logic, quantities in algebra, points, and hence lines and figures in geometry.
