        "text": "Chapter Text\n\nIf you think fighting for your life is hard wait until you have to entertain a four year old in a dark storage container while also keeping her away from the statue of her mother that you failed to bring back from stone. I think I might’ve given a four year old trauma within the first couple hours of meeting her but who’s to say really.\n\nShe traced the white spot on my forehead, then the small white dot on the bridge of my nose, then she pointed at the thick stripe of white going from my bottom lip to my neck.\n\n“Why do ya look like that? You got a funny face ‘mam!” She said with a small giggle.\n\n“I have something called vitiligo! It just means I lose color in certain spots of my body over time.” I answered in the sweetest kindergarten voice I could muster up.\n\n“I ain’t see nobody like you before mam! You look real interestin’ Cherie!”\n\nI laughed as she continued to touch the small spots of vitiligo along my arms, I do admit, it was pretty nice to have someone complement something that I’ve hated about myself for most of my life.\n\n“You know- my brother liked dis one lady- and she was reaaal pretty I done tell you that-“\n\nI listened to her tell me stories about her brother and mother, about how she tripped, about how she laughed. Though it was jumbled with some words i couldn’t even make out, I couldn’t stop listening. I held her tighter to myself with every word she spoke, I tried to get her away from the ice, giving her as much warmth as I possibly could.\n\nShe fell asleep soon after, I took her off of me and gently rested her on the floor. I walked over to the statue of the woman, looking terrified of what was to come, and then I saw the base of it.\n\n‘Budoux family misfortune, 1915’\n\nI looked back at the woman, putting my hand on her shoulder as I desperately tried to turn her back to no avail. Had Lucy…had Ajax…come from the statue? Were they…from 1915? My mind was running through possibility of possibility of what this could mean- could I…do magic?\n\nI looked into the clayed over eyes of the statue, cursing myself internally for not being able to save her. I sat down and pulled my knees to my chest, wrapping my arms around my shins as I did so. I tried to blink tears away from my eyes, but I couldn’t. Drop after drop landed on my jeans as they kept on coming, sniffing and wiping my nose with my arm. I wanted to sleep, to go away for good and never come back, I didn’t want to die I just didn’t want to exist.\n\nThe truck pulled to a sudden halt, I heard the door of the truck open and close as I heard the jingling of keys get farther and farther away. I gently woke up Lucy, shaking her tiny body slightly as I saw her eyes blink. I got my hoodie back, putting the flashlights in my pockets and putting my guitar and backpack back on as I opened the door to the storage container and jumped out with Lucy in arm, shutting the door to it afterwards.\n\nIt was sunset by the time we had gotten to the diner via the truck. The sign was bright and the words jumbled in my brain but I could’ve sworn it said “sumthet all uround dinner” at first. I took another second to look at it again, only to see it saying “sunset all around diner” instead. And that’s when I knew dyslexia and directions to New York would mix like a quiet town and a hurricane.\n\nAs I opened the door, a small bell jingled. In there there was some bikers with graying beards, old ladies going for tea, a tired waitress with black hair and piercings, and a lone boy with golden locs, dressed in a green hoodie with an extra long hood, listening to music and eating a grilled cheese.\n\nSomething just felt off about the guy, not bad but just off. I sat at the table behind him with Lucy as I told her to order something but not to make it too expensive cus I only had twenty dollars.\n\n“Twenty? Is you rich? Where’d ya find twenty dolla’s Cherie?”\n\nI looked at her confused as I shook my head and told her to order something. She pointed to scrambled eggs that were six dollars, I nodded and decided to get the same thing.\n\n“Wanna know a trick?” I said with a smile. “If you order a water with extra lemon-“ I got my cup and squeezed the lemon into the water. “And you get some of these sugar packets-“ I quickly opened the packet and dumped three or four of them in. “You get a free lemonade.”\n\nShe looked at me in wide eyed astonishment. She did the same to her drink as she sipped away happily. I looked over at the guy, still jamming out to music on his headphones as his bag dropped to the floor. I tapped him on the shoulder as I picked it up. His eyes opened as he saw me, taking his chunky black headphones off.\n\n“You need something?” He shot me a confused look as I handed him his bag, he didn’t look much older then me- either 13 or 14 by his looks alone. I shook my head as I fiddled with my hoodie strings.\n\n“Um…sorry you uh-dropped your bag…oh by the way is that a Zelda pin?”\n\n“You know Zelda? Dude that’s awesome! I love Zelda-“ he smiled with green banded braces, he had bright amber eyes and dark skin, he wore about as much Zelda merch as any Nintendo store had, and looked like thee link fanboy.\n\n“Well…I know a few things from…a friend…she always made me watch her play majoras mask-“\n\n“NO WAY! That’s like my second favorite game behind twilight princess!”\n\nHe invited me and Lucy to sit with him, he told us about how he was also trying to get to New York, and how he was trying to escape his crazy aunt who wanted to send him to wilderness therapy. He said that his friend was getting salad at the salad bar, he talked about said friend for over five minutes before they decided to join.\n\n“Yo Hero! These guys are heading to NYC just like us!” He smiled widely as his braces showed the green band once more. “Dang- I forgot to tell you my name- I’m stupid sorry- um I’m link and this is Hero they go by They/Them! Hero meet Kaya and Lucy, Lucy and Kaya meet Hero-“\n\nI looked at the person named Hero with wide eyed astonishment, on the left side, they were the most gorgeous person I’d ever laid eyes upon, with a sky blue eye that shined as the sun hit it just right, clear skin and just the right amount of blush and bronze that perfectly contoured their face, blonde hair that fell from their scalp down to a ponytail that held it all together, dripping down to their mid back. On the other side of their face was a red mark that stuck onto the face bone like it was desperately trying not to fall off, it dropped down to the right side of their neck. Their eye was glossed over and dripped down more than an eye should. Hero was terrifying to look at to say the least.\n\nThey were silent as they stuffed their face with a salad, looking at me occasionally from their food. They wore a dodgers jersey with cargo shorts and an old Radiohead teeshirt with a brown across-body bag. I didn’t know if they were just like that or if they hated me from the moment they saw me.\n\n“Um…I have a twenty…do you have any cash on you? Sorry I don’t think a twenty’s gonna cover all of us and tip-“\n\n“Nahh chill! I got my credit card-“\n\nLink pulled out a golden credit card as he showed it off with a smirk.\n\n“It’s all on me I’ll pay for your stuff too since we’re all going as a group-“\n\n“But me and Lucy are going to this…camp half blood place…not NYC-“\n\n“Camp half Blud? I done heard nuthin ‘bout going to a camp-“\n\nLink turned to hero as they both nodded.\n\n“We’re going to camp half blood too…” link said slightly suspicious. He squinted at me as he leaned over slightly.\n\n“You aren’t a monster in disguise tryna follow us right?” He clenched the table as his nose scrunched up, Hero pulled him back down by the trim of his hoodie.\n\n“You mean those weird lion things that pretend to be your councilor but actually push you out of a three story building- yeh I know them-“\n\n“And there’s more! There’s these huge dogs that chase you- AND- and there’s these-“ link motioned with his hands what seemed to be a bird, I shook my head in astonishment.\n\n“You can see them too?” I open my eyes wide. “You guys are demigods?” Leaned in, waiting for an answer.\n\n“Demi- whut?” Lucy looked up at me, still sipping on her lemonade.\n\n“Don’t- don’t worry about it Lucy-“ I said as I waved her off. She huffed as she sat back and sipped angrily.\n\n“Yeh! Yeh we’re demigods! This guy with goat legs named Gary told us-“ link smiled widely at Hero who was still taking glances at me. Hero kept their head low, squinting at me like they were trying to memorize my face. Hero had an energy about them that made the hair on my arms stand up, in short, link looked like the guy in the movie that gets the girl at the end, and Hero looked like the type of person to spike the punch at prom and then rob said guy in an alleyway at gunpoint.\n\nAs link paid for the food I could see hero staring right at me, the one blue eye practically glowing as they took in my appearance. I gulped and shakily grabbed my make-shift-lemonade as I sipped it carefully.\n\n“Are you going to finish your food?”\n\nTheir voice was raspy, their head tilted to the side slightly in curiosity. I let out a shaky breath as I answered in probably the most nervous way possible.\n\n“O-oh uh…sorry I only usually eat half- I-i always do take out and-“\n\n“You should finish your food…we won’t have fridges where we’re going…”\n\nI looked at them with slight panic as I scooped another fork full of the scrambled eggs and toast into my mouth. After that- they went back to being silent.\n\n“Well don’t get too intimidated by Hero- they’re a huge comic book nerd! Aren’t you Hero?” Hero seemed to shoot link a glance that said ‘dude not in front of them’ in the most threatening way possible. Link just laughed it off.\n\n“Kaya you know marvel? Hero LOVES marvel! And X-men!”\n\n“Oh yeh! I like marvel a little! My favorites uhhh…shoot uhhh lo- le- h-he’s a green villain-“\n\n“Loki…you mean Loki…”\n\nI went silent as hero looked at me blankly once more.\n\n“I should teach you about the marvel universe-“\n\nI gulped as i practically sunk into my chair. “M-maybe some other time you know-“ I looked down at Lucy who was looking blankly out of the window at the truck that was pulling away.\n\n“I’m sorry Lucy…I really am-“\n\n“I neva gon see dem a’gain will I?”\n\nI looked down at my lap, pulling the little girl closer to me in a small embrace.\n\n“We have bigger and better things Lucy! Remember, bigger and better!”\n\nShe continued to stare at the truck as she held onto my hand tightly. I was an awful witch or whatever Ajax had called me back then, I pulled Lucy into my lap as I held her once more.\n\n“I’m sorry…Lucy’s going though something right now and…and it’s my fault…”\n\nLink looked at hero awkwardly who just kept on looking at me. The waiter soon came back with the bill as link took out his card and placed it on the black leather, signing something before handing it off.\n\nThe next few minutes were spent in silence, Hero was still looking at me as I looked down at my empty plate, it was weird. I always ate half of my food and almost forgot what being full felt like, honestly it felt good I wasn’t going to lie-hero was right, I was gonna have to let an old habit die hard if i wanted to survive the way to New York.\n\nWe left the diner, Lucy on my back and Hero not far behind me and link. The sun had already set, making it a cold night. In front of us was a road and dirt, I looked at link who was already heading up road, I furrowed my brows as I looked at him.\n\n“Uh link?…where are you going?”\n\n“Up road!”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“One of the people in there said there’s a junkyard up ahead”\n\n“And why are we going to the junkyard, link?”\n\n“So we can steal a car and get out of Texas.”\n\nHero nodded along with the plan, they sped up slightly to be next to me, their good eye wondered to Lucy who was looking straight ahead.\n\n“Is she ok?” Hero spoke in a monotone voice, their good eye wondering back to me.\n\n“I found her like this…I think she’s ok…” I answered back.\n\n“Your eyes are green. The white part of your hair makes you look like rouge.” Hero said back to me. I furrowed my eyebrows in a slightly weirded out way, looking directly at hero. ‘A little off topic there bud’ I thought to myself as I studied the Radiohead teeshirt they were wearing.\n\n“You like Radiohead? You have a favorite song by them?” I tried to make small talk with them, but their eyes just avoided mine as they turned their face to the ground, the stray, somewhat grown out bangs, covering their face that was reddened either by being flustered or by the cold.\n\nLucy looked at hero who was still walking right next to us, and then she uttered something out of her mouth that made my heart drop in embarrassment.\n\n“Is you a boy or a lady?”\n\nMy eyes widened as I turned to hero, I was getting ready on my knees to apologize for her rude words before hero spoke up.\n\n“I’m neither”\n\n“But how?”\n\n“I dunno…I’m just…neither…”\n\nLucy frowned, I shook my head in embarrassment as I covered my face with one hand.\n\nSuddenly I was brought back to my home, no not Florida- Hawaii. Living with my family in Ōahu, I had moms and dads-who I learned on the mainland were just called aunts and uncles- who took care of me, and cousins who’d play with me in the ocean. I remembered the face of my dad, oh how I missed my dad- I looked back on my culture, something i clung onto for dear life it felt like…it was apart of me, it was home.\n\n“Lucy, in Hawaii there’s something called being ‘Māhū’. There’s Kane, which is man. wahine, which is woman. And Māhū, which is just being a mix of the two. I think hero is closer to Māhū then anything.”\n\nLucy looked at me curiously, shaking her head as to agree.\n\n“Why ain’t that done interestin’ on der Cherie?” She wiggled off my shoulders, falling off as she landed in my arms. I laughed as I looked up at hero, who was most definitely looking at me like I was the kindest person to ever walk the earth.\n\n“Go on and walk with link, Lucy. he’s farther ahead.” Lucy nodded as her little legs sped off to walk with him.\n\n“You…aren’t weirded out?” Hero’s tone was flat, but their expressions betrayed their voice.\n\n“No im not! Trust me! Im…not really a stranger to it…I’m Bi actually.” I gave hero a small smile as I nudged their arm. Hero gave me a smile, a genuine smile. I could’ve sworn a gust of wind flew past me when I saw it, I smiled back at hero as walked in newfound comfortable silence to the junkyard.\n\n…\n\n“And here we are! Junk-topia baby!”\n\nLink gestured to the cars that were rusted so badly it smelled like pennies and graveyards. I wanted to dash out of that junkyard like I wanted a million dollars, Badly.\n\nAnd then the most beautiful, wonderful, godlike thing caught my eye. It glowed in its silvery, beautiful state. It was like a movie nerds dream come true to see one, and for it to be in a place like this? Well it was a shame.\n\n“Is that a DELOREAN? OH MY GO-“\n\nI pushed past link in an urgent manner, putting my hands up to the car as I looked in wide eyed astonishment.\n\nThe door was already opened upward towards my face as I squealed in utter delight. I immediately hopped into the drivers seat as I played with the steering wheel like I was a NASCAR driver.\n\n“Oh imagine going 88 in this! OH I FEEL JUST LIKE MARTY MCFLY!” I continued to make car noises as hero, link, and Lucy started to catch up.\n\n“Kaya…what are you doing?” Link looked appalled at my behavior but i didn’t care, this had to be a gift from whoever above that was making my life a horribly written angst fanfic made by a person who’s just a bit too obsessed with making the main character be unapologetically abused.\n\n“Can we drive this one please! PLEASE! With cherries and chocolate and anchovies and spam and-“ I got out of the car and onto my knees begging the group as I rambled off toppings. The car was in near perfect condition save for the few scratches, the tank was completely empty ,sadly, and the oil needed to be changed badly-but that was something to do at a later time-First we had to find gas, and then learn how to Hotwire a delorean.\n\n…\n\nHero had started a fire with some matches they had found and some air fresheners that were in cars. We all huddled around it for warmth as we sat in silence. Lucy was already dozing off in my lap and link was fast asleep on my shoulder. I didn’t like thinking about fire, it brought me back-\n\nI shook my head as I found hero staring at me once again, this time I looked back, staring at their one working eye. I still felt slightly uneasy being around them- I wasn’t exactly buddy buddy with them like link was. They were across from me, hugging their knees to their chest and absentmindedly biting their lip over and over again.\n\nBeing used as I pillow for two people wasn’t exactly on my to-do list of getting to New York, but it was a small price to pay for making some new acquaintances. I motioned for hero to come over, moving my free arm as I waved for them to sit next to me. They didn’t look like they got much sleep at all if not ever, they had one large eye bag hanging around the non-scarred part of their face.\n\nHero hesitantly sat next to me, their face set fully on the fire now, I could feel the wind get stronger just slightly, and I could see the clouds were moving away from the moon, illuminating the junkyard just a bit more.\n\n“So…link said that you both had a friend with goat legs, is that right?” I said as i tilted my head slightly.\n\n“Gary…yeh…he was….energetic.” I saw hero shift uncomfortably.\n\n“What happened to Gary?” My body leaned toward hero just slightly, a worried expression plastered across my face.\n\n“He…he…saved us…from the big dog thing…and now we don’t know where he is…”\n\n“Oh…”\n\nI looked down at Lucy who was still fast asleep in my arms, then I looked at link, who was snoring away already.\n\n“Me and link…both lived in California-“\n\n‘CRASH’\n\nJust then, link and Lucy shot up from their sleep, Lucy grabbed onto my neck and shut her eyes tightly. I looked at link and hero, who looked absolutely ready to book it out of there. But if any of us did that exactly then it wouldn’t make for an interesting story now would it?\n\nI put Lucy on my back and held out my flashlights in front of me, double clicking them as two twin blades formed in my hands, link looked down at the swords and loudly whispered: “WHAT! THATS THE COOLEST THING LIKE- EVER!” Which resulted in hero putting their hand over links mouth, which also resulted in link licking hero’s hand to get it off of his mouth.\n\n“So you guys don’t have weapons?”\n\n“Not that we know of- Oh hero! The baseball bat! Get it out of my pin bag!”\n\nHero raced to the bag as they pulled out a huge bronze bat, resting it on their shoulder as the ran back.\n\n“Ok so now it’s only you and Lucy who don’t have weapons-“\n\nI thought for a second, trying to make up somewhat of a plan.\n\n“Ok link, stay behind with Lucy and make sure she doesn’t run off. Me and hero are gonna see if there’s any danger.”\n\nI handed Lucy off to link, her hands reaching out to me as I pulled her off, me and hero ran over to where we heard the bang come from, giving once last look at link and Lucy as the both of us ran farther away.\n\nStanding there in the middle of the junkyard, surrounded by rusted cars and old pipes was a tall man. He looked to be about eight feet, and buff like you couldn’t believe. He was surrounded by at least three , red, gallons of gas. There was a small jingling as he moved around, his stomps felt like mini earthquakes as he thumped all around, the jingling kept on getting more and more as the man picked up the car and threw it in anger.\n\n“It’s just a guy?” I said as I shook my head.\n\n“I don’t think any ‘regular’ guy would be able to just throw a whole car.” Hero said with their raspy, crackly voice.\n\nWe quickly took cover behind a black van with wolves painted on it, crouching down and whispering together, trying to make up a plan.\n\n“I mean…maybe he’s not dangerous?”\n\n“Kaya I’ve met things like that! When I met link one of those things tried attacking us in LA-“\n\n“Hero, I don’t need a backstory right now-“\n\n“They’ve only got one eye, kaya! And they-“\n\nHero groaned in frustration as the covered their face with their hands. They peaked out from the weirdly painted van quickly to try and make a little more ground to set up a plan.\n\n“Ok…the jingling sounds like-“\n\n“Car keys.”\n\nHero nodded\n\nHero looked at me with wide eyes of recognition, I could practically smell the plan they were cooking up in their dome.\n\n“If we get those keys, we can get a car!” Hero pushed some stray blonde hair out of their face as the looked down to the ground, thinking even harder.\n\n“Ok we can’t let this thing reach link…or Lucy…” hero looked again, watching the way the guy stopped around.\n\n“It looks like the keys are tangled in the guys hair, so-“\n\n“Haircut?” I asked.\n\n“Haircut.” Hero affirmed.\n\nHero and I ran out from the van, matching each others pace as we ran towards the tall guy.\n\n“HERO! You distract him! I’ll be the barber!” Hero nodded along as they ran in front of the large, hulking, figure. If I could get the keys out of the hair of the guy- I could stop the rampaging and get a car, but that would cause another problem- that being- the guy would most definitely hate my ever loving guts.\n\nHero hit a car with their bat as the impact rung all throughout the junkyard, I could see them flinch as the monster turned his full attention to them. I planned on stealing a gallon or two of the gas for the absolute angel of a car (that being the delorean) so we could drive all the way to New york New York and never go back to junk-topia ever again.\n\n“YOU! QUIET NOW!”\n\nThe monster threw a tire at hero, who quickly dodged out of the way before it could hit them. It felt like magic watching them move so swiftly, it was like they were dancing with violence itself. I shook the thought of hero out of my head as I reached for a long, matted, lump. My hand made contact with the weirdly greased up ball as I tried not to gag from the smell, the guys hands tried to come at me as i began to saw away at the lump of hair where the keys resided.\n\n“WERE GONNA HAVE TO KILL IT KAYA!”\n\n“AND HOW DO WE DO THAT-“ the monster tried to shake me off like i was water on a dog. “OH KNOW IT ALL OF BATTLE?”\n\nI fruitlessly sawed away at the keys on the monsters hair, dodging the bone crushing hands that would surely grind me into pieces if they made contact.\n\nHero groaned in frustration as they ran around the monster to try and distract it from me. They held their bat firmly in their hands as they tried to think, hitting the side of their head in frustration.\n\n“HOLD ON KAYA! IM GONNA TRY TO DISTRACT IT BETTER-“\n\n“AND HERE I THOUGHT YOU WERE THE CO-AUTHOR TO ‘THE ART OF WAR’ MY BAD-“ I cut myself off as I held the keys in my hand, small bits of monster hair still remaining on the smaller keys.\n\nAnd then I felt a hand reach up and make contact with my ankle.\n\nI got thrown probably thirty feet as my body made contact with a black Honda odyssey, the wind knocked out of my lungs once again. Twice in a row now! Guess you could say these fights are- breathtaking! Ba dum chhh…ok that wasn’t funny at all I’m gonna tell the rest of the story now.\n\nI desperately tried to crawl back to my feet, coughing as I clutched the one activated sword in my hand. My breath became shaky and hard as I saw the huge man thump over to me like my name was Jack and I had a magical bean stalk, picking me up by the hair as I met its grotesquely rotten breath.\n\n“YOU! MEAN LADY!”\n\nMy head was screaming as I looked into the monsters eye. Only one, big, huge eye. I could’ve sworn it was flipping between one eye and two every time that I blinked. I couldn’t even muster the strength to slash it with my swords before the one activated one fell out of my hand along with the keys.\n\nAnd then, I saw hero.\n\nHero was absolutely terrifying.\n\nThere was a blue electric field that ran along their bat, their one blue eye seemed to glow even brighter. The air felt ice cold as they came nearer and nearer to the monster, they looked ready to kill. The clouds became almost black as they swirled around the moon like a tornado, it didn’t ease my nerves that said clouds were also accompanied by strikes of blue and purple thunder. Making hero shutter at each loud hammer in the sky, but it never stopped their intimidating stride towards me and the monster holding me by the hair.\n\nJust as hero was about to hit the monster with the electric blue glow of the bat, a loud, high pitched voice came from behind them.\n\n“STOP!!!”\n\nJust then the monster froze, letting my hair go as I dropped to the ground with a thump. I looked up as I saw the ice spread from his hips to his shoulders as he made one last attempt to kill me.\n\nAnd then he was completely frozen in place, his fist only stopping a little under three inches away from my face.\n\nI saw as the electricity faded away from hero, the sky clearing as Lucy came up and wrapped her arms around my neck. I gave her a firm squeeze as I looked up to see an out of breath link ogling at the ice statue.\n\n“He ain gonna be like dis for long-“\n\n“Lucy-“\n\n“PLEASE! TRUST ME JUS FOR ONCE! LISTEN!”\n\nI held her tightly as i nodded. I put her down as I picked up my flashlight and stuffed it back in my jean pockets.\n\n“Let’s get the gas. We’ve got keys-\n\nI looked down at the keys, begging and hoping that maybe they were for my dream car and maybe the universe could give me a break. The fob had a wolf howling at the moon, and then I knew I had to leave the beautiful delorean behind.\n\nI walked over to the beautiful silver angel as I kissed its front window, my arms spread all across the hood, My heart broke ten times at once it felt like.\n\n“Kaya we need to go”\n\n“Not now link! I’m grieving”\n\n“It’s just a car-“\n\n“It is THE car-“\n\nHero was busy filling the tank of the van with the wolves on it as they spun the keys on their fingers.\n\n“BOTH of you need to come over here!”\n\nI said my final goodbyes to the gorgeous beauty of movie-nerd-dom. Still mourning my chance to drive the almost perfect delorean.\n\n“We will always have junk-topia Marty jr-“\n\n“Wait you named it?”\n\n“You don’t name the things you like? Ok, liar”\n\nLink thought for a second before nodding along.\n\n“Ok you’ve got me there- now hop in! Wolf-y Goldberg is ready to go!”\n\nLink took my hand as I looked back to what felt like my nerdy brain’s one true love. Hopping in the back of the van with link and Lucy.\n\n“New York?” Hero said as they plugged the keys into the car.\n\n“At this point- away from Texas” i said as I saw link take shotgun. I closed the doors to the back, locking them before putting Lucy on my lap and hearing the engine purr.\n\nBut our quest for home sweet half blood was just getting started."
