        "text": "The Simpsons has been broadcast in the United States since 1987 on FOX. In other countries, the TV show also started to be broadcast few times later 1987, either in its original version or in a dubbed version.\n\nIn addition to these non-English versions, The Simpsons Movie has also been dubbed in languages for which there is no TV series dubbed version. This is a list over the voice cast of all the different languages.\n\nBy language[edit]\n\nlanguages listed here are those broadcast by television channels of different countries\n\nArabic[edit]\n\nThe show was first broadcast in the area in its original language with Arabic subtitles on networks like Showtime Arabia and Dubai's One TV, where it received a following in the area. The vast majority of all airings of the series on television channels in Arab countries (including all current broadcasts of the series) have been in English with Arabic subtitles.\n\nThe show finally received an Arabic dub in September 2005, under a title that transliterates as \"Al-Shamshoon\" (in Arabic, الشمشون) In addition to being dubbed into Egyptian Arabic (with subtitles provided for shots including written English, such as the chalkboards), references to alcohol (Duff Beer & Moe's Tavern), pork (bacon & hot dogs), and numerous other themes have been deleted or significantly modified. For instance, Homer drinks soda-pop instead of beer and eats beef sausages as opposed to pork and all references to Moe's Tavern were cut. The characters were also given typical Arabic names such as \"Omar\", \"Mona\" and \"Abar\" for Homer, Marge and Bart respectively as part of the retooling, while voices were provided by leading actors including Egyptian film star Mohamed Henedi as \"Omar\" and Hanan Tork as Lisa, and their hometown \"Springfield\" was called \"Rabeea\" (Arabic for Spring) and made it look like an American town with a major Arab population. Another major modification was that the Simpsons attended mosque instead of church to reflect an Islamic theme of the show. This dubbed version of the series did not fare very well in the Middle East nations, and only 34 of the 52 adapted episodes aired.[1]\n\nCatalan[edit]\n\nWhen the show first aired on TVE (in the early 90s), it aired in both Catalan and Spanish for the audience in Catalonia. Later, when Antena 3 bought the rights for the show, it also aired some episodes in both Catalan and Spanish for a brief period (within 1995) in Catalonia. Not long after, the Catalan dub fell into oblivion.\n\nDutch[edit]\n\nThe TV show is currently broadcast by Comedy Central undubbed, and formerly on SBS 6, with subtitles, which is usual for foreign-language TV shows and movies in the Netherlands and Dutch-speaking parrs of Belgium. However, the series was actually briefly aired on RTL 4 with a Dutch dub. Additionally, the movie received a dubbing in Dutch for its theatrical release in the Netherlands. Another Dutch dub of the movie was produced specifically for its release in Belgium, featuring Flemish actors. Names of the characters remain unchanged.[2]\n\nThe Netherlands[edit]\n\nThe Dutch movie voice actors are:\n\nCharacter Voice actors Homer Simpson Reinder van der Naalt Marge Simpson Georgina Verbaan Bart Simpson Marjolein Algera Lisa Simpson Niki Romijn Otto Mann, Waylon Smithers, Jr. fr:Fred Meijer\n\nBelgium[edit]\n\nThe Flemish movie voice actors are:\n\nCharacter Voice actors Homer Simpson Chris Van den Durpel Marge Simpson Tania Van der Sanden Bart Simpson Vicky Florus Lisa Simpson Mieke Laureys\n\nFrench[edit]\n\nThe Simpsons has been dubbed into the French language twice; once in the Canadian province of Quebec, and again in France. In both versions, the show is named Les Simpson, as last names are not pluralized in French. Matt Groening has stated that the Quebec version of the series is the best translation of the show in another language in the world. The French audio on the Region 1 DVDs is the Quebec dub.\n\nIt is one of only a handful of American television shows that have wholly separate dubbed versions in Quebec and France, and a number of studies have been made comparing them. In France all the characters speak standard French with a strong Parisian accent, with the exception of the ethnic minorities: Apu is given the Portuguese accent common to French shop keepers while Carl, who has no accent in the American version, also speaks inflected French. Kirk Van Houten is given a stereotypical Belgian accent.[3] In the Quebec version only the town elite, such as Principal Skinner and Reverend Lovejoy, speak International French. The Simpson family and most of the townsfolk speak Quebec French with strong Québécois accents. In the Quebec version the ethnic minorities also have accents. Apu speaks in a creole while Carl has the accent of a Black immigrant from Africa or the Caribbean.[4]\n\nLocal idioms are occasionally adopted in place of direct translation. American cultural and political jokes are occasionally replaced with local references. For instance, a reference to Newt Gingrich in Quebec is generally replaced with one to Mike Harris. Most of the recurring characters keep their English names in each French version. Two exceptions are Sideshow Bob and Sideshow Mel, who are known as Tahiti Bob and Tahiti Mel in France, as the word sideshow has no direct translation. In Quebec, the title sideshow is kept as an Anglicism. Another exception is made for Simpsons family's dog, Santa's Little Helper, who is called \"Le p'tit renne au nez rouge\" (Little Red-Nosed Reindeer) in the Quebec version and \"Petit Papa Noël\" (Little Santa) in the French one.\n\nThe episodes are dubbed by a team of voice actors, similar to the one that does the original. The team does about two episodes per day. In general these voice actors also do the characters who were voiced by celebrities in the American version. In the French version, on occasion, official dubbers are brought in. For instance for the episode where Mulder and Scully from the X-Files appear the voice actors who do their voices on the French version of the X-Files guest starred.\n\nThe animation of the show is not changed, and what is in writing in English appears in English, subtitled in French, in the two French versions. One important exception is the blackboard joke at the beginning of each episode. The Quebec and France versions share these French language blackboard scenes.\n\nIn July 2007 Matt Groening said in an interview on Late Night with Conan O'Brien that the actor (Philippe Peythieu) who does the voice of France French Homer says \"Toe!\" instead of Homer's trademark \"D'oh!\". This comes from the actor misreading the line the first time he did Homer's voice and has been that way ever since.\n\nPhilippe Peythieu, the France French voice of Homer, and Véronique Augereau, the France French voice of Marge, first met on the dubbing of the series and are now married, just like their animated counterparts. On April 8, 2007, Peythieu and Augereau hosted \"in character\" a special prime-time compilation of their favorite Simpsons episodes on French cable channel W9.[5]\n\nAlthough the location and setting of the show are not changed in the Quebec dub (still takes place in the United States), many references to the characters watching American TV shows, movies, etc. are changed to references to Québécois ones (the same is done in the Quebec dub of King of the Hill, done by the same company). For example, a reference to Homer watching CSI: Miami in the original was changed to Fortier, a similar Québécois show. Although these changed references would be familiar to the French-Canadian viewer, in real life these would be awkward because almost all Québécois media is unknown in the USA. In addition, most instances of the word \"English\" are changed to \"French\". Due to this, in one episode where Homer visits Canada, the roles of anglophones and francophones are completely reversed, resulting in a stereotypical English Canadian speaking French and a stereotypical French Canadian speaking English.\n\nMost Québécois who know about the France version are not too fond of it; the humor is completely different. Télétoon, which broadcasts the Quebec Simpsons dub, also once broadcasted France dubs of Futurama (also created by Matt Groening) and Family Guy, two shows similar to The Simpsons whose French dubs were also similar to The Simpsons' Parisian dub. Although The Simpsons has been on Télétoon long before the other two shows, Futurama and Family Guy are no longer shown on the network, while The Simpsons continues to be aired. Although this could have been done because there were no more French episodes of Futurama and Family Guy to air (reruns were repeatedly aired), it could as well have been because of a lack of popularity- Télétoon airs many other shows that only repeatedly show reruns.\n\nCatchphrases[edit]\n\nIn France version of the show, many catchphrases are also translated: Homer's \"D'oh\" becomes \"T'oh\", Bart's \"Eat my shorts\" becomes \"Va te faire shampouiner\" (no direct translation, like \"go to hell\"). When Homer tries to throttle Bart, his phrase \"Why you little...\" becomes \"espèce de sale petit...\", literally \"kind of dirty lil'...\".\n\nIn Quebec version of the show, \"D'oh!\" stays \"D'oh!\", Bart's \"Eat my shorts\" becomes \"Mange de la crotte\" (we could translate it by \"Eat some shit\" but in a censored way), Bart's \"I didn't do it!\" becomes \"J'ai rien fait\". When Homer tries to throttle Bart, he says \"Oh, Mon p'tit verrat\" (a Quebec expression) instead of \"Why you little...\".\n\nFrance[edit]\n\nThe French voice actors are:\n\nCharacter Voice actors Homer Simpson, Abraham Simpson, Otto Mann Philippe Peythieu Marge Simpson, Selma Bouvier, Patty Bouvier, Jacqueline Bouvier Véronique Augereau Bart Simpson, Jimbo Jones (since season 7) Joëlle Guigui Lisa Simpson, Milhouse Van Houten, Maggie Simpson Aurelia Bruno Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Waylon Smithers, Jr., Carl, Barney Gumble, Lou, Troy McClure, Rainier Wolfcastle, Comic Book Guy, Snake, Lionel Hutz, Superintendent Chalmers, Duffman, Herbert Powell (voice 1), Guibole, Roger Meyers (voice 4) Patrick Guillemin (seasons 1-9) Pierre Laurent (since season 10) Moe Szyslak, Lenny, Willie, Cletus, Eddie, Arnie Pie, Louie, Database, Lance Murdock, Scratchy (voice 1), John Frink, Disco Stu, Murphy Gencives Sanglantes (voice 2) Roger Meyers (voice 3) Roland Timsit (seasons 1-4) Gilbert Levy (since season 5) Charles Montgomery Burns, Krusty, Clancy Wiggum, Principal Skinner, Dr. Hibbert, Marvin Monroe, Kent Brockman, Joe Quimby, Tahiti Bob, Captain McCallister, Hans Taupeman, Gil Gunderson, Jasper, Kirk Van Houten, Snyder, Larry, Kang, Nick Riviera, Dewey Largo, Fat Tony (voice 2), Scratchy (voice 2), Herbert Powell (voice 2), Roger Meyers (voice 2), Clarence Bouvier (voice 2) Michel Modo (seasons 1-19) Gérard Rinaldi (since season 19) Edna Krabappel (since season 7), Elizabeth Hoover, Sarah Wiggum, Maude Flanders, Agnes Skinner, Doris, Helen Lovejoy, Luann Van Houten, Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon, Bernice Hibbert, Mona Olsen, Itchy, Nelson, Jimbo Jones (seasons 2-6), Kearney, Dolph, Martin Prince, Wendell Borton, Lewis Clark, Üter, Janey Powell, Sherri and Terri, Ralph Wiggum Régine Teyssot Rod Flanders, Todd Flanders Régine Teyssot\n\nThe dialogue is adapted by Juliette Vigouroux and Alain Cassard until season 19, the dialogue was done by Regine Teyssot and Christian Dura now.\n\nArt director by Christian Dura\n\nThere are two important changes in Simpson French dub. first, the departure of Patrick Guillemin at the end of season 9. and now the French adapters and Michel Modo (who died recently) during season 19. The presence of Gerard Rinaldi is not ensured yet for the upcoming seasons.\n\nQuebec[edit]\n\nThe Quebec voices are:\n\nCharacter Voice actors Homer Simpson Hubert Gagnon Abraham Simpson Marge Simpson Béatrice Picard Bart Simpson Johanne Léveillée Lisa Simpson Lisette Dufour Moe Szyslak Benoît Marleau Herman Hermann Maude Flanders Natalie Hamel-Roy Elizabeth Hoover Milhouse Van Houten Chantal Baril Jimbo Jones Martin Watier Professor Frink Gilbert Lachance Nelson Muntz Hélene Lasnier Ralph Wiggum Agnes Skinner Selma Bouvier Johanne Garneau Charles Montgomery Burns Edgar Fruitier Waylon Smithers, Jr. Alain Zouvi (formerly Jean-Louis Millette) Apu Nahasapeemapetilon Reverend Lovejoy Bernard Fortin Clancy Wiggum Ned Flanders Groundskeeper Willie Pierre Auger Lionel Hutz Mario Desmarais Barney Gumble Yves Massicotte Julius Hibbert Krusty the Clown Marc Labrèche Otto Mann (Otto Bus in the Quebec version) Troy McClure Benoît Rousseau Snake Jailbird Lenny Leonard Eddie Seymour Skinner Mario Desmarais Joe Quimby Edna Krabappel Louise Rémy Carl Carlson Joël Legendre Marvin Monroe Martin Prince Natalie Hamel-Roy Rod Flanders Gabrielle Dhavernas Todd Flanders Danielle Mayer Sideshow Bob Ronald France Patty Bouvier Chantal Baril Fat Tony Pierre Auger Lou Martin Watier\n\nIt is adapted by Benoît Rousseau with the help of Johanne Léveillée .\n\nThe speech of Homer, Lenny, Carl, and other lower-class characters in the Quebec version occasionally resembles joual, the working-class speech.\n\nGerman[edit]\n\nThe Simpsons has been dubbed into one single German language and are broadcasted by ProSieben in Germany, Austria and Switzerland and ORF1 in Austria. The show is named Die Simpsons and the episodes appear uncut and dubbed, with written or sung English subtitled in German. The animation of the show is not changed. In the blackboard scene, Bart reads the phrase translated. Homer's alveolar catch phrase \"D'oh!\" has been translated to \"Nein!\" (meaning \"No!\") rather than leaving it as the meaningless interjection that is his annoyed grunt.\n\nAn alternate Austrian dub was produced for and broadcast on ÖRF1 in Austria, but only for a tiny handful of episodes. This dub features a voice cast comprised of local Austrian actors.\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nNearly all of the characters carry their American names; there are only just a few characters which are translated, especially animals. For example Reverend Lovejoy is still Reverend Lovejoy. Lovejoy's name seems to be the single one ever (partially) translated into German for some episodes (\"Reverend Gottlieb\"). Gottlieb is a real German first name - albeit outdated - meaning \"to love God\". In the earlier episodes, Homer is called 'Humor', because the German translators didn't know how to spell it.\n\nTranslated characters:\n\nSideshow Bob: Tingeltangel Bob, Sideshow Bob\n\nIn prior episodes solely translated as Tingeltangel Bob, afterwards taken over the original.\n\nReverend Lovejoy: Reverend Gottlieb, Reverend Lovejoy\n\nReverend Gottlieb was used just a very few times, afterwards generally the original.\n\nÜter: Uter\n\nIn the German version always a stereotypical Swiss, because they wouldn't make fun of themselves.\n\nHans Moleman: Hans Maulwurf\n\nBleeding Gums Murphy: Zahnfleischbluter Murphy\n\nSanta's Little Helper: Knecht Ruprecht\n\nSnowball: Schneeball in some episodes, but generally the original is used.\n\nThe German voice actors are:\n\nLink with photos and sound samples:\n\nGerman voice actors\n\nPortuguese[edit]\n\nIn both Portugal and Brazil, the series is known as Os Simpsons.\n\nBrazilian version[edit]\n\nOn this dubbing, Bart is voiced by a male actor instead of a female.\n\nHomer Simpson: Waldyr Sant'anna (seasons 1-7, and 15-17); Julio Cesar (seasons 8-14); Carlos Alberto (since season 18)\n\nMarge Simpson: Selma Lopes (seasons 1-7, and since season 14); Mariângela Cantú (seasons 8-10); Nelly Amaral (season 11-13)\n\nBart Simpson: Peterson Adriano (seasons 1-7); Rodrigo Antas (since season 8)\n\nLisa Simpson: Nair Amorim (seasons 1-7); Priscila Amorim (season 8-14); Flávia Saddy (since season 15)\n\nPortugal[edit]\n\nIn Portugal the series itself is subtitled rather than dubbed, as with most foreign-language television programs not directed toward children and/or families.\n\nThe Simpsons Movie, however, did receive a dubbed version, in which José Jorge Duarte, Cláudia Cadima, Carla de Sá, and Manuela Couto provide the voice of Homer, Marge, Bart, and Lisa, respectively.\n\nRussian[edit]\n\nUntil 2018, the show was undubbed for its televised broadcast in Russia, and had an offscreen voiceover. The Simpsons Movie, however, was properly dubbed.\n\nSpanish[edit]\n\nThe Simpsons has been dubbed into the Spanish language twice, once in Latin America and again in Spain. In both versions, the show is named Los Simpson, as last names are not pluralized in Spanish. There are many differences between the two versions. For example, Homer's name is translated as Homero, but in Spain it isn't translated. Other translations in Latin America but not in Spain are:\n\nBarney Gumble as Barney Gómez\n\nChief Wiggum as Jefe Gorgory\n\nRalph Wiggum as Ralf/Rafa Gorgory\n\nReverend Lovejoy as Reverendo Alegría\n\nSideshow Bob as Bob Patiño\n\nMayor \"Diamond\" Joe Quimby as Alcalde Diamante\n\nCletus Spuckler as Cleto Spuckler.\n\nNelson Muntz and Martin Prince were previously renamed as Nelson Rufino and Martin Trino, respectively.\n\nItchy and Scratchy's names are translated in both versions: Tommy y Daly in Latin America, and Rasca y Pica in Spain.\n\nThe animation of the show is not changed, and what is written in English appears in English in the Spanish versions. In the chalkboard gags, we hear Bart reading the phrase in Spanish. After the introduction in the Latin American version we hear Homer saying the name of the episode, unlike in the European Spanish dub.\n\nThe DVDs in some regions, and all of the episodes (including the movie) on Disney+/Star+ include both Latin and Castilian Spanish audio tracks.\n\nLatin American version[edit]\n\nThe Latin American version is dubbed in Mexico by Audiomaster 3000 (seasons 1-14) and New Art Dub (season 15-onwards). The DVD commentary for season 3's \"Like Father, Like Clown\" states that writer Wallace Wolodarsky went to several countries, including Mexico and Germany, to cast the foreign versions. The most memorable cast dubbed from seasons 1 through 9 and was:\n\nHomer: Humberto Vélez (seasons 1-15, 32-onwards)/ Víctor Manuel Espinoza (seasons 16-31).\n\nMarge: Nancy MacKenzie (seasons 1-15, died)/ Marina Huerta (seasons 16-31)/ Claudia Motta (season 32-onwards).\n\nBart: Marina Huerta (seasons 1-9, 16-31)/ Claudia Motta (seasons 9-15, singing voice in season 30 episode \"Krusty the Clown\", 32-onwards).\n\nLisa: Patricia Acevedo (seasons 1-15, 32-onwards)/ Nallely Solís (seasons 16-31).\n\nMr. Burns: Gabriel Chávez (seasons 1-15, 32-onwards)/ Miguel Angel Botello (season 16-31).\n\nAbraham Simpson: Carlos Petrel (season 1-11, died)/ Roberto Reséndiz (season 12)/ Humberto Vélez (season 13)/ Arturo Mercado (a couple of episodes)/ Sebastián Llapur (seasons 14-25, 32-onwards).\n\nSeymour Skinner: Agustín Sauret (season 1-4)/ José Luis Castañeda (season 5-9)/ Gabriel Pingarrón (season 9-15)/ Gerardo Vásquez (seasons 16-31)/ Roberto Mendiola (season 32-onwards).\n\nNed Flanders: Agustín Sauret (seasons 1-15, died)/ Oscar Gómez (season 16-onwards).\n\nWaylon Smithers, Jr.: Octavio Rojas (seasons 1-14, 32-onwards)/ Eduardo Fonseca (seasons 16-31).\n\nPatty: Nelly Horseman (season 1-15)/ Erika Mireles (seasons 16-28, died)\n\nSelma: Nelly Salvar (seasons 1-15)/ Erika Mireles (seasons 16-28, died)\n\nEdna Krabappel: Loretta Santini (seasons 1-15)/ Gabriela Gómez (season 16-onwards)\n\nNelson: Sergio Bonilla (seasons 1-12, 32-onwards)/ Carlos Amador (seasons 13-15)/ Eduardo Garza (a couple of episodes)/ Edson Matus (seasons 16-17, 25-31)/ Hugo Núñez (seasons 17-25).\n\nMoe: César Izaguirre (season 1-4)/ Jorge Ornelas(season 5-onwards).\n\nDuring season 9, Huerta quit playing Bart for not being well paid by the company, and was replaced by Claudia Motta. Before season 16, the main cast had a legal issue with Grabaciones y Doblajes (today, New Art Dub) because it wanted the actors to be in the National Actors Association of Mexico, and they were not in that association, so as a result, the whole cast was fired. Beginning at season 16, they were replaced by new actors (in fact, they \"copy\" the old actors's character voice so the change is not so drastic for the viewers) and Huerta returned to do Bart's voice and replaced Nancy MacKenzie to make Marge's voice. However, since season 32, Claudia Motta return to dub the Bart's voice and also the Marge's voice due to Nancy MacKenzie was never called to dub the character. MacKenzie died on June 14, 2024.\n\nEuropean Spanish Version[edit]\n\nThe principal cast is the following:[6]\n\nHomer Simpson: Carlos Revilla (Seasons 1-11, died)/Carlos Ysbert (Season 12 ownards)\n\nMarge Simpson and her sisters: Amparo Soto (replaced at 4th season by Begoña Hernando due to voice problems with his character; in the 6th season Hernando was replaced by Margarita de Francia due to the same problem)\n\nLisa Simpson: Isacha Mengíbar\n\nBart Simpson: Sara Vivas\n\nSeymour Skinner: José Padilla\n\nApu Nahasapeemapetilon and Waylon Smithers, Jr.: : Javier García\n\nNed Flanders: Oscar Gómez\n\nRod Flanders: Laura Palacios\n\nTodd Flanders: Elena Palacios\n\nMany fans of the series and the rest of the Spanish cast were very sad after the death of Carlos Revilla due to his excellent work,[7][8][9] and Antena 3 had to find a substitute for Revilla's voice (as opposed to Dan Castellaneta's).[10] Carlos Revilla also dubbed the appearance of KITT in the episode \"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\", like he did in Knight Rider. Other characters voiced by their voice actors' Spanish-speaking counterparts include Mulder and Scully from the X-Files, or Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil. They are dubbed by the same actors who dub Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce in Frasier.\n\nThe Spanish version of The Simpsons also distinguishes itself by using more literal translations of what the characters are saying. The Spanish translation would most likely seem very salacious to a Latin American audience. Another large difference between the two versions is that in the Spanish version the guest stars are always voiced by that actor's particular Spanish voice counterpart. In this way if the Spanish public is expecting to hear Glenn Close they actually hear the voice they usually equate to that actress.\n\nBy country[edit]\n\nCountries listed here are those broadcasting the original version or those whose dubbed version is broadcast in only one country\n\nBulgaria[edit]\n\nIn mid September 2005 dubbed in Bulgarian versions of the first four seasons of The Simpsons started airing on the Bulgarian branch of the cable television FOX Life. The show was named \"Семейство Симпсън\" (literally \"Simpson Family\"). There were rarely any mistranslations in the scripts, only the untranslatable word puns were changed to such in Bulgarian, albeit not nearly as creative as the originals. The dubbing, much like almost everything else dubbed for Bulgarian television, was crude and the original voices could be heard in the background. In mid 2006 dubbed versions of seasons 5 through 7 started running on the Bulgarian FOX Life after numerous reruns of the previous seasons. The dub quality was a little lower than the one of the first four seasons and almost the entire voice cast had been replaced. Minor mistranslations occurred from time to time, but they were not anything significant. In early May 2007 dubbed versions of the 8th and 9th season started airing on the Bulgarian FOX Life with the same voice cast as in the previous three seasons. The quality of the dub had however greatly declined - the voice direction had become very poor and all the lines were read in pretty much the same fashion; the secondary characters' voices were very inconsistent; the scripts were poorly translated and most of the spoken humor was lost (not only the untranslatable word puns). In late September 2007 a dubbed version of the 10th season started running on the Bulgarian FOX Life. The dub quality was as worse as the previous two seasons'.\n\nChina[edit]\n\nIn 2006, The Simpsons, along with other shows such as Pokémon, SpongeBob SquarePants and Mickey Mouse cartoons, were barred from being aired during primetime (5:00 to 8:00 PM) in China. This was done so that Chinese cartoons, which were having a hard time competing with foreign cartoons, would gain more viewers. The government had previously tried several things, such as ordering that networks cut down on the number of foreign animated series being aired in 2000 and in 2004, passed a rule that would ensure that 60 percent of cartoon content came from Chinese studios.[11] The move was heavily criticized by Chinese media.[12]\n\nCzech Republic[edit]\n\nThe Simpsons has been dubbed into the Czech language and the show is named Simpsonovi. Directed by Zdeněk Štěpán. The movie is named Simpsonovi ve filmu. On this dubbing, Marge is unusually voiced by a male voice actor, unlike in all other documented dubbings of the series.\n\nThe Czech voice actors are:\n\nCharacter Voice actors Homer Simpson Vlastimil Bedrna (from 1st season) - cardiac infarct;\n\nVlastimil Zavřel (from 13th season) Marge Simpson Jiří Lábus Bart Simpson Martin Dejdar Lisa Simpson Helena Štáchová Maggie Simpson Helena Štáchová / Jiří Lábus Abraham Simpson Dalimil Klapka Patty Bouvier Zdeněk Štěpán Selma Bouvier Jaroslava Kretschmerová Jacqueline Bouvier Jiří Lábus Other Ned Flanders Jiří Havel Milhouse Van Houten Pavel Tesař Apu Nahasapeemapetilon Vítězslav Bouchner Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon Klára Sedláčková Clancy Wiggum Bohdan Tůma Julius Hibbert Bohuslav Kalva Reverend Timothy Lovejoy Roman Mihina Charles Montgomery Burns Bedřich Šetena Waylon Smithers, Jr. Mojmír Maděrič Lenny Leonard Josef Carda Carl Carlson Jaroslav Horák Seymour Skinner Dalimil Klapka Gary Chalmers Milan Slepička Edna Krabappel Blanka Zdichyncová Groundskeeper Willie Zdeněk Hess Otto Mann Martin Janouš J.

The show is named Simpsonit.\n\nThe Finnish voice actors of The Simpsons Movie are:\n\nHomer: Markku Toikka\n\nMarge: Eija Vilpas\n\nBart: Rinna Paatso\n\nLisa: Kiti Kokkonen\n\nTranslated character names:\n\nItchy and Scratchy: Tikku ja Takku (literally Stick and Shag). The name is a word play referring to Tiku ja Taku, Finnish for Chip 'n' Dale.\n\nKrusty the Clown: Hassu-klovni (literally Funny-Clown)\n\nSanta's Little Helper: Pukin Pikku Apuri\n\nSnowball: Lumipallo\n\nBleeding Gums Murphy: Veri-ien Murphy\n\nComic Book Guy: Sarjakuvahemmo\n\nHungary[edit]\n\nThe Simpsons has been dubbed into the Hungarian language, and the show is named A Simpson család.\n\nThe Hungarian voice actors are:\n\nCharacter Voice actors Homer Simpson József Székhelyi† (season 1-29, movie)\n\nJános Háda (season 29-) Marge Simpson Zsuzsa Pálos Bart Simpson Balázs Simonyi (season 1-29, movie)\n\nTamás Markovics (season 29-) Lisa Simpson Titanilla Bogdányi\n\nTranslated character names:\n\nItchy and Scratchy: \"Frinci és Franci\"\n\nKrusty the Clown: \"Ropi a bohóc\"\n\nSanta's Little Helper: \"Télapó Kiskrampusza\"\n\nSnowball: \"Hógolyó I, II, III, IV, ...\"\n\nComic Book Guy: Képregényes fickó\n\nSeymour Skinner: \"Seymour Sintér\"\n\nItaly[edit]\n\nThe Simpsons has been dubbed in Italian since the very beginning of the broadcasting by Italia 1, as subtitled shows are not common in Italy. The show is named I Simpson - as last names are not pluralized in Italian. The animation of the show is changed: whenever something written in English appears on screen, the Italian version superimposes the translated phrase. In the initial blackboard scene, Bart reads the phrase translated but the blackboard itself still shows the English words.\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nMain characters carry their American names; many of the side characters, however, have their names translated:\n\nSanta's Little Helper: Piccolo aiutante di Babbo Natale;\n\nSnowball: Palla di neve;\n\nMoe Szyslak: Boe Szyslak/Boh Szyslak in the later seasons (his tavern's sign Moe has always superimposed Boe or Boh)\n\nFat Tony: Tony Ciccione;\n\nClancy Wiggum: Clancy Winchester (in just one episode, Homer alone, his last name is left Wiggum)\n\nEdna Krabappel: Edna Caprapall\n\n\"Bleeding gums\" Murphy: \"Gengive sanguinanti\" Murphy\n\nItchy and Scratchy: Grattachecca e Fichetto (in one episode they are translated as Grattino e Pruritino)\n\nHans Moleman: Hans Uomo Talpa\n\nOtto Mann: Otto Disc\n\nSideshow Bob (Mel): Telespalla Bob (Mel)\n\nJimbo, Kearney, Dolph: Secco, Patata, Spada (literal translations: Slim, Potato, Sword)\n\nMany characters are dubbed with strong local accents: Wiggum, Lou and Marvin Monroe talk like men from Naples, Eddie talks like someone from Bari, Carl with a Venice accent, Reverend Lovejoy is a Calabrian, Otto Mann a Milanese, Fat Tony - obviously - a Sicilian, and Willie is a Sardinian.\n\nThe Italian voices:\n\nCatchphrases[edit]\n\nMany catchphrases are also translated: while Homer's \"D'oh\" remains the same in Italian, Bart's \"Ay caramba\" becomes \"E che cacchio\" (meaning \"What the hell\", where \"cacchio\" is actually a euphemism for \"dick\") and \"Eat my shorts\" becomes \"Ciucciati il calzino\" (lit. \"Suck your sock\"). When Homer tries to throttle Bart, his phrase \"Why you little...\" becomes \"Brutto bacarospo...\". \"Brutto\" means \"ugly\", while \"bacarospo\" is a non-existent word, a portmanteau of \"bacarozzo\", which is a Romanesco word for \"scarafaggio\" (Eng: \"cockroach\") and Italian \"rospo\" which means \"toad\".\n\nCensorship[edit]\n\nItalian airing of four episodes were hit by censorship, at least on Italia 1. \"Weekend at Burnsie's\" and \"Highway to Well\" was aired in late evening viewing due to the argument for its premiere. It was never reaired on Italia 1 afterwards in reruns of the season. \"Bart-Mangled Banner\" was reaired less frequently due to the revisionism argument. \"Treehouse of Horror XXVIII\" is the first episode never aired in Italy, neither on Fox or Italia 1 (until February 20, 2021 on Italia 1 in late evening), due to the religious arguments in The Exor-Sis, and the crude segment MMM... Homer.\n\nJapan[edit]\n\nIn Japan, The Simpsons has been dubbed into Japanese and were first broadcasted by WOWOW until 2002 and later on the Fox Channel-onwards.\n\nThe Japanese audio track was later included on Disney+ for first 17 seasons only.\n\nMain characters[edit]\n\nRecurring characters[edit]\n\nCharacter Abraham Simpson Junpei Takiguchi Ned Flanders Minoru Inaba Moe Szyslak Maude Flanders Sayuri Yamauchi Itchy Milhouse Van Houten Nobuo Tobita Jimbo Jones Professor Frink Nelson Muntz Masahiro Anzai (season 1-6)\n\nToshiharu Sakurai (season 7-present) Otto Mann Snake Jailbird Rod Flanders Mari Mashiba Ralph Wiggum Manjula Nahasapeemapetilon Chuck Lunchlady Dora Charles Montgomery Burns Kōichi Kitamura † Waylon Smithers, Jr. Kōsuke Meguro Reverend Lovejoy Groundskeeper Willie Clancy Wiggum Daiki Nakamura Lionel Hutz Hiroya Ishimaru Barney Gumble Masashi Hirose Apu Nahasapeemapetilon Krusty the Clown Bin Shimada Troy McClure Seymour Skinner Shin Aomori Julius Hibbert Edna Krabappel Keiko Tomoe Mayor Quimby Shinpachi Tsuji Carl Carlson Herman Hermann Brent Lenny Leonard Tetsuya Asado Kent Brockman Hiroshi Ito Kirk Van Houten Marvin Monroe Kōsei Tomita Martin Prince Shinobu Adachi Todd Flanders Sideshow Bob Akira Murayama Della Hiromi Ishikawa Patty Bouvier Reiko Suzuki Agnes Skinner Fat Tony Eizō Tsuda Lou Eiji Itō Donny Jack Larson Sarah Wiggum Mizuki Ōtsuka Herman Hermann Shigeru Chiba\n\nLatvia and Lithuania[edit]\n\nIn Latvia and Lithuania, the series is usually aired with a voice-over translation in Latvian or Lithuanian respectively read by a single individual and overlayed on top of the original English audio, similarly to how the series is usually aired in Poland. However, the movie was properly dubbed into Latvian and Lithuanian for its theatrical release, with a full voice cast.\n\nPoland[edit]\n\nAlthough The Simpsons (Simpsonowie) in Poland is typically aired with a Polish-language lector-style single-voice voice-over translation overlayed on top of the original English audio (narrated by Janusz Szydłowski for TVP1 and Canal+; Tomasz Knapik for Fox Kids; and Jarosław \"Jarek\" Łukomski, Ireneusz Machnicki and Paweł Bukrewicz for Fox/Fox Comedy),the movie has instead been dubbed into Polish (as Simpsonowie: Wersja kinowa), and the actual series was also dubbed into Polish when it aired on TV Puls in 2008 (although the TV Puls dub only covered the first three seasons). Later, three Disney+-original Simpsons shorts, \"The Good, the Bart, and the Loki\" (\"Dobry, Bart i Loki\"), \"Plusaversary\" (\"Wszystkiego Disneyplusowego\") and \"Welcome to the Club\" (\"Witajcie w klubie\") were dubbed into Polish.\n\nThe Polish voice actors of the movie are:\n\nCharacter Voice actor Homer Simpson Miłogost Reczek Marge Simpson Barbara Zielińska Bart Simpson Joanna Wizmur Lisa Simpson Dominika Kluźniak Russ Cargill Adam Ferency Ned Flanders Wojciech Paszkowski Medicine woman Emilia Krakowska\n\nSweden[edit]\n\nWhen TV3 started broadcasting The Simpsons the show was not dubbed, but rather subtitled. However, in 1993, the network decided to start dubbing The Simpsons and moved the show to a more child friendly time at 6:00 p.m. After public outrage, the dubbing was dropped after only six episodes, and the show was moved to a more adult time.[14] Bart was voiced by Annica Smedius and Homer by Per Sandborgh.[1] Despite the original dubbing of the series being fully canceled, a dub of the movie was released with the The Simpsons Movie DVD.[15]\n\nUkraine[edit]\n\nIn Ukraine The Simpsons has been dubbed in Ukrainian since 2004. Dubbing and translation is liked by public.\n\nIt was first broadcasted by M1, then 2+2, then QTV, and the most recently (until 2021) NLO TV.\n\nThe Ukrainian voice actors are:\n\nCharacter Voice actor (series) Voice actor (film) Homer Simpson Yevhen Malukha Mykola Lutsenko Marge Simpson Iryna Doroshenko Bart Simpson Hanna Levchenko Lisa Simpson Iryna Doroshenko Kateryna Kachan Abraham Simpson Yuriy Kovalenko Ned Flanders Yuriy Kovalenko Dmytro Zavadskyy Russ Cargill Mykola Boklan Moe Szyslak/Cletus Spuckler/Kent Brockman Yuriy Kovalenko\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]"
