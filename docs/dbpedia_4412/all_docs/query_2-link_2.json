        "text": "If you’re looking for the perfect gift for a younger model railroader, you’re not exactly short of options!\n\nAt the same time, more choice isn’t always a good thing, especially if you find yourself looking at 10 different trains and want to make sure to buy the one that the lucky recipient will like best.\n\nStill, it’s hard to go wrong with the Thomas & Friends kit.\n\nLet’s explore why one of Thomas the Train’s friends, Percy the Small Engine, is an excellent gift for children.\n\nWho Is Percy The Small Engine?\n\nPercy the Engine is a saddle tank locomotive, but most importantly, he’s Thomas the Tank Engine’s best friend.\n\nAs one of the franchise’s main characters, Percy is also part of the Thomas & Friends Steam Team, alongside Thomas the Train himself, Gordon, James, Emily, Nia, and Rebecca.\n\nPercy is a cheeky, playful engine who is one of the youngest on the Isle of Sodor. He works on Thomas’ Branch Line as a goods engine, but pulling the Mail Train is his favorite job.\n\nIn terms of appearance, Percy the Engine is a beautiful apple green with red and yellow lining, and he sports the number six.\n\nWhy Percy The Small Engine Makes A Great Gift For Kids\n\nHe’s Part Of A Brand That Kids Love\n\nYou can’t really go wrong when buying a Thomas the Train inspired gift.\n\nKids love Thomas & Friends! And if you happen to be buying for someone who has never watched Thomas & Friends before, we can all relate to knowing how quick and easy it is to fall in love with it! On top of that, there’s no hard and fast rule that says a new Thomas & Friends collection has to start with Thomas the Train. Everyone has their favorite friend, and Percy is one of the most popular members of the Isle of Sodor gang!\n\nHe’s Relatable To Kids Who Watch Thomas & Friends\n\nOne of the most significant reasons Thomas & Friends has endured for so many years and remains popular today is how relatable all the characters are. All the engines have distinct personality traits, and Percy the Engine certainly stands out from the crowd in that regard!\n\nPercy brings a youthful, infectious eagerness to everything he does. At times, Percy’s willingness to prove himself while having fun can cross over into mischief. Still, his cheeky side means this is always done playfully, with a desire to have fun at the center of everything he does. Of course, Percy sometimes gets into trouble, but that’s where his friends show their own positive personality traits by coming along to help him out.\n\nMost kids have at least some of Percy’s attributes, making him such a great friend and gift choice!\n\nHe’s A Wonderful Role Model\n\nAbove all else, and on top of Percy’s personality traits, he is a wonderful role model for children who watch the show.\n\nPercy the Engine is known for being a brave, kind engine who isn’t afraid to involve himself with the other trains even though they’re bigger and older than he is.\n\nPercy is unfailingly loyal, always trying his best, and isn’t disheartened if something goes wrong. He might need some help in the end, but he’ll keep trying to do something until it’s done and always wants to prove just how good he can be.\n\nThese are all values every parent tries to instill into their kids. What better inspiration and role model for a young person than Percy himself?\n\nHe Doesn’t Need To Be Steaming Around the Isle of Sodor or Tidmouth Sheds To Have Fun\n\nWhile Percy is at home pulling the Mail Train around the Isle of Sodor before heading back to Tidmouth Sheds to see his friends, he can have fun anywhere.\n\nEven if the person you’re buying the gift for doesn’t have a Thomas & Friends inspired layout, Percy will still look amazing and be a brilliant addition wherever he ends up. Percy is so playful that he’ll even have fun pulling carriages that aren’t part of the Thomas & Friends range!\n\nBuy Percy the Small Engine at Model Train Stuff\n\nReady to buy Percy the Small Engine and make someone incredibly happy?
