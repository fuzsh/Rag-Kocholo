I wouldn't want to be any other colour either. „ ~ Percy in \"Thomas, Percy and the Coal\".\n\n“ \"Don't call me Dirty Percy!\" „ ~ Percy after Gordon calls him that in \"Thomas, Percy and the Squeak\"\n\nPercy the Small Engine is on of the two deuteragonists (alongside James) of the Thomas the Tank Engine & Friends franchise.\n\nHe is a green saddle tank engine who works on the North Western Railway and is the number 6 engine. He was first brought to Sodor to help run the railway while Gordon, James and Henry went on strike and later became station pilot at Knapford. Following the renovation of New Harbour, Percy was moved permanently to Thomas' Branch Line, where he now works as a goods engine. His favourite job pulling the Mail Train and he is Thomas' best friend.\n\nPortrayals\n\nIn the first twelve seasons, he was, like every character, voiced by the narrator, a role assumed at various times by Ringo Starr, Alec Baldwin, Michael Brandon, Pierce Brosnan, the late George Carlin, and the late Michael Angelis.\n\nIn Thomas and the Magic Railroad, he was voiced by Linda Ballantyne, originally going to be voiced by Michael Angelis.\n\nIn the CGI series, he was voiced by Martin Sherman in the US dub of Seasons 13-18 and Christopher Ragland in Seasons 19-24. In the UK dub, he was voiced by Keith Wickham in Seasons 13-18 and Nigel Pilkington in Seasons 19-24.\n\nBio\n\nPercy was most likely built by Avonside sometime around the 1900's and had gone through a subsequent rebuild in the years preceding his second-hand sale to the North Western Railway. He is said to have been found wearing Hunslet parts, according to workers at Crovan's Gate.\n\nWhen Gordon, James and Henry went on strike in protest of the extra work they had to do since Thomas left to run his branch line, the Fat Controller decided that the railway needed another tank engine. Going to the engine workshop, the Fat Controller saw a green saddle tank and when the engine confirmed he was willing to work hard, the Fat Controller bought him and named him Percy. Bringing him back to Sodor, Percy was charged with running the branch line while Thomas ran the Main Line with Edward and was allowed to stay after the big engines surrendered and returned to work. At first, Percy liked to annoy the big engines. Percy was later waiting at Tidmouth, but forgot to whistle to the signalman, and thus was startled when Gordon came running towards him with the express. Gordon managed to stop in time, but Percy was so frightened, he ran away and ended up stuck in a sandbank. He was rescued by Gordon and took up the duty of station pilot at Tidmouth.\n\nPercy was still a cheeky engine and often liked to play jokes on Gordon and James, but one day the other engines got their revenge when Percy failed to recognise a \"backing signal\". After this, Percy was subject to bullying from the big engines until Duck arrived and helped Percy to put the big engines in their place, although Percy still received a reprimand from the Fat Controller for it.\n\nWith Duck's arrival, Percy was sent to Thomas' Branch Line to help build Knapford Harbour and has stayed there ever since as a goods engine.\n\nIn Tale of the Brave, Thomas tells Percy about some mysterious footprints that he saw at the China Clay Pits. Percy convinces himself that it must be footprints of a monster that is roaming Sodor. Continuing to be anxious for a few days, he causes lots of confusion and delay such as: mistakenly referring to Gator, the new engine as the monster, failing to delivery his mail on-time and running off before The Fat Controller finished talking to him. After talking with his new friend Gator, he understands what being brave is like and later uses this courage to save James from a huge landslide. He later learns that the monster was really a dinosaur a long, long time ago, which had now become a fossil. He also understood that the footprints Thomas saw, were also only fossils left from the dinosaur. Percy later says goodbye to Gator, who has to return to the mainland, but the two friends are certain they will meet again someday.\n\nIn the eighteenth season, Percy was starting to miss Gator & tries to forget him by working hard & not think about him. When he had to deliver trucks full of precious sculptures and paintings for a special exhibition, he didn't stop to be coupled & the Troublesome Trucks rolling to the Old Mine. He thinks about Gator and his advice of how to be brave. Percy goes into the mine and rescues the trucks. Percy reunited with Gator on Christmas.\n\nIn the nineteenth season, he was to take the Mayor of Sodor to the Search and Rescue Centre to present a new alarm bell to celebrate their one thousandth rescue. Diesel overheard Percy talking about it at the Docks and he played a trick on him, sending Percy to the Old Quarry which resulted him ending up on a badly flooded railway line and after Diesel unsuccessfully attempted to pull him out of the flood, he too also ended up getting stuck in the water after it badly damaged his generator. The rescue of Diesel and Percy marked the Sodor Search and Rescue Centre Crew's one thousand and first rescue.\n\nPersonality\n\nWriting in The Thomas the Tank Engine Man, Brian Sibley described Percy as \"one of the most engaging engines in the shed, with his slightly roly-poly appearance and a look of wide-eyed innocence\". As the television series has progressed, Percy has been dumbed-down in order to teach viewers difficult words: he would say \"dingy-fried\" where anyone else would say \"dignified\". He is also shown to make silly mistakes, but then fix them upon realising what he has done before further damage is caused.\n\nPercy is incredibly accident-prone and holds the dubious record of the most accidents in one season - five, in the second season - crashing into some buffers, falling into the sea, being pushed onto a brakevan, colliding with a cart, and being hit by a falling crate of treacle. So far, his silliest accident yet was in the sixth season, when he slipped on oily rails, crashed through the chocolate factory and emerged covered in chocolate. Despite this, he always tries to do his best, learn from his mistakes and get his jobs done, a loyalty which Sir Topham Hatt has praised him for on several occasions.\n\nAlthough their friendship has been turbulent at times, Thomas is generally portrayed as Percy's best friend. Percy is also great friends with Duck and enjoys working with him at Knapford Harbour.\n\nSince the second season, Percy has had a small rivalry with Harold, stemming from their race. However, they are always willing to help each other when in trouble.\n\nHe also had held a grudge from the big engines about their tricking him into misinterpreting a signal, but silenced this with some help from Duck. This shows that, when nonsense goes too far, Percy will not stand for it and seek help to settle the matter for good, even if he faces a reprimanding from Sir Topham Hatt for it.\n\nPercy is also a big coward and is afraid of ghosts and monsters. Thomas teases him for this in Scaredy Engines where both he, Percy and Duck have to work at the Smelters Yard, Percy also warns Thomas and Emily to be careful at the Smelters in Halloween as he thought that ghosts reside there. However, there are times were Percy shows immense courage and bravery such as in Put Upon Percy where Percy remembered to use the canvas barrier to protect him and his crew from the landslide at the coal mine.\n\nBasis\n\nPercy is primarily based on a GWR Avonside 0-4-0ST with the body of a GWR 1340 Trojan, the bunker of a GWR 1361 class locomotive, Hunslet underframes and valve gear, a smokebox protruding from his saddletank, external cylinders and motion, and sandboxes underneath the tanks on his footplate.\n\nModifications made to Percy's shape include the angled smokebox supports and the cab being cut down slightly from the back for the bunker.\n\nA similar looking engine painted red, lived with Percy at the Workshop where he used to live before arriving on Sodor, in the My Thomas Story Library book, The Fat Controller.\n\nLivery\n\nPercy is painted NWR green with NWR red-and-yellow lining and a \"6\" painted on his bunker sides in yellow with red lining.\n\nAppearances\n\nRailway Series\n\nTroublesome Engines\n\nHenry the Green Engine\n\nToby the Tram Engine\n\nGordon the Big Engine\n\nEdward the Blue Engine (not seen)\n\nPercy the Small Engine\n\nThe Eight Famous Engines\n\nThe Twin Engines\n\nBranch Line Engines\n\nStepney the \"Bluebell\" Engine\n\nTramway Engines\n\nReally Useful Engines\n\nMore About Thomas the Tank Engine\n\nToby, Trucks and Trouble\n\nThomas and the Twins (does not speak)\n\nThomas and the Great Railway Show\n\nThomas Comes Home\n\nWilbert the Forest Engine\n\nThomas and the Fat Controller's Engines\n\nThomas and Victoria\n\nThomas and his Friends\n\nTelevision series\n\nSeason 1 - Trouble in the Shed, Percy Runs Away, Whistles and Sneezes, Dirty Objects, Off the Rails, and Thomas' Christmas Party\n\nSeason 2 - Thomas, Percy and the Coal, Cows (does not speak), Saved from Scrap (cameo), Old Iron, Percy and the Signal, Duck Takes Charge, Percy and Harold, The Runaway (does not speak), Percy Takes the Plunge, Pop Goes the Diesel (cameo), A Close Shave (cameo), The Deputation, Thomas Comes to Breakfast, Daisy, Percy's Predicament, Ghost Train, Woolly Bear, and Thomas and the Missing Christmas Tree (does not speak)\n\nSeason 3 - A Scarf for Percy, Percy's Promise, Time for Trouble, Gordon and the Famous Visitor, Donald's Duck (cameo), Thomas Gets Bumped, Thomas, Percy and the Dragon, Diesel Does it Again, The Trouble with Mud (cameo), No Joke for James, Thomas, Percy and the Post Train, Trust Thomas (does not speak), Toby's Tightrope, All at Sea, Tender Engines (cameo), Escape (cameo), Oliver Owns Up, Bulgy (cameo), Percy, James and the Fruitful Day, and Thomas and Percy's Christmas Adventure\n\nSeason 4 - Granpuff, Sleeping Beauty, Bulldog, Four Little Engines (cameo), A Bad Day for Sir Handel (cameo), Trucks!
