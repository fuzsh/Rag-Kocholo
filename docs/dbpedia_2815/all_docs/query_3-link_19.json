        "text": "Over the past 25 years, scholars have tended to shift away from phenomenological approaches to Gnosticism, and increasingly recognized social ethics with the \"Gnosticisms\" of the 2nd to 4th centuries. However, little attention has been devoted to the question of how ancient rhetorical conventions shaped Gnostic ethical and moral discourse, especially as evidenced in Nag Hammadi sources. Appreciation of the generic conventions that dictate features of a text can improve understanding of the social context in which it was produced. Examines the \"Interpretation of Knowledge,\" whose genre has not been satisfactorily established. The text should be read as a sustained work of paraenesis – a moral exhortation with a persuasive intent. On the basis of that identification, reconstructs features of the social context in which it was produced. [Abstract from Religious & Theological Abstracts]\n\nRather than an organized church, Gnosticism or Docetism in antiquity were broad dualistic ways of thinking held as expressions of reality within Greco-Roman society. A codified body of literature did not exist. The Pistis Sophia was a major work and is available here, and the Nag Hammadi manuscripts also constitute literature with gnostic ideas. Carpocrates and Valentinus were gnostic leaders in the second century A.D. Marcion founded celibate churches in Syria where monasticism also developed, and Tatian, also a gnostic, developed the first canon or list of inspired books. Origen in 248 A.D. shows signs of gnostic thinking in his writing, e.g. . “Every soul that is born into flesh is soiled by the filth of wickedness and sin…..” – Homily on Leviticus. Origen was prolific, and one may think he wrote too much. Irenaeus was a second century Christian writer and counsellor who advised Pope Victor.. Evangelical Protestants and Roman Catholics still hold the view that every human conception is separated from God because of sin inherited from Adam and Eve. The teaching is that Jesus died to save even infants from original sin. By tying the sacrifice of Jesus to original sin, the latter seems validated by the former. Definition: Evangelical Gnosticism is a dualistic world-view that believes salvation from sin is attained only by an unseen spiritual approach, i.e. internal mental assent alone; excluding physicality. In this way, the idea of “spiritual” has been hijacked or claimed by the evangelical gnostics. The insidious nature of gnostic thinking is that one may not realize that their ideas are gnostic.\n\nTo be published in ARAM Periodical vol. 33 2021. Sixty years ago, the study of Gnosticism adhered to the field of comparative religion. But over the last 30 years, a strong trend of analyzing Gnosticism in the light of orthodox Christianity has emerged. This approach has established boundaries between the fields of Christian Gnosticism, Hermeticism, Manichaeism, and Mandaeism. I assert that this development is detrimental to all of these traditions as well as to the study of orthodox Christianity. In this article, I discuss the problems facing scholars who justly challenge the stereotypes of heresy and orthodoxy. Some of these scholars have been more successful in dispelling the prejudices projected onto Gnosticism than in understanding the different ways in which Gnostic myth may function—surprising the present author and, perhaps, others as well. I conclude that the clear-sightedness we have gained by dismantling different stereotypes has led to an approach to interpreting Gnostic texts that, yet again, conceals Gnostics’ different traits. They have escaped the cage of heresy only to be buried under the umbrella term “Christianity,” thereby losing their links to other Gnostics as well as non-Gnostic ancient traditions."
