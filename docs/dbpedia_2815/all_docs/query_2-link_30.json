        "text": "Citation preview\n\n(CE:2035a-2036a)\n\nQAL‘AT AL-BABAYN (castle of the two gates), a medieval fortress on the east bank of the Nile (some 12 miles [19 km] south of Idfu), at which a few sturdy fortification walls with towers and numerous domestic buildings remain. The unusual, hook-shaped ground plan is determined by the lie of the land. The fortress falls into two parts divided by a middle wall, of which the eastern part is regarded as younger. Both parts have a gate opening on the intermediate slope. The buildings within consist in the western section predominantly of single-story, two-roomed houses, which are set into the mountainside one above the other. In the eastern section, building development is less dense and runs parallel to the course of the wall. The lower area accommodates several buildings with large rooms, among them a church, although only parts of the sanctuary remain. It consists of an apse with two rectangular side rooms, the spatial dimensions of which are similar to those of the Nubian churches of the tenth century from the Faras region. Furthermore, remains of the gallery floor above the two side rooms have been preserved. One can only speculate about the date of the fortress. From the layout, it can hardly be dated to the late Roman period. The existence of a Christian church in it disproves an origin in the Islamic period. There has been no lack of support for the attempt to set it in the period of the Nubian Christian occupation of Upper Egypt (Monneret de Villard, 1938, p. 124). In that case it would go back to the first half of the tenth century. BIBLIOGRAPHY Grossmann, P., and H.

Apart from the remains of a few miserable houses (Ranke, 1926, p. 7, pl. 7), only the cemeteries have survived, and these afford information about an occupation extending from the fifth to the eighth century A.D. The graves themselves were oblong earth pits, without any additional casing. The dead were as usual wrapped in shrouds, but had over the head a peculiar triangular headpiece made of wood or palm branch ribs, which served to protect the head and was incorporated into the wrappings. The grave offerings were poor, for the most part fabrics as well as wood and bone carvings. In the ground of the cemetery there are also the remains of a fairly large building, which has been described by the excavators as a monastery (Bilabel, 1924, p. 4). BIBLIOGRAPHY Bilabel, F. Griechische Papyri. Heidelberg, 1924. Ranke, H. Koptische Friedhöfe bei Karara. Berlin and Leipzig, 1926. PETER GROSSMANN\n\n(CE:2036b-2038a) QASR IBRIM, a fortified hilltop settlement in Lower Nubia, about 25 miles (40 km) to the north of the famous temples of Abu Simbel. A temple seems to have been built there in the Egyptian New Kingdom, and the place was intermittently occupied from that time until its final abandonment in 1811. The name appears in Meroitic texts as Pedeme; in classical texts variously as Primis, Premnis, and Prima; and in some Coptic texts as Phrim. Most Arabic sources give the name as Ibrim or Qal‘at Ibrim. The forename Qasr is seldom encountered before the nineteenth century, although it has been regularly coupled to the name of the town in the recent past. Qasr Ibrim in the beginning seems to have been primarily a religious center. In addition to the New Kingdom temple (which may never have been finished), the \"Ethiopian\" pharaoh Taharqa built a brick temple in the seventh century B.C. A more overt military and administrative role began when the Ptolemies occupied the place and built a massive girdle wall around it, probably around 100 B.C. They and their Roman successors apparently occupied the place for about two centuries, although a Meroitic invading force took temporary possession in 23 B.C., as recounted by Strabo and Pliny. Around A.D. 100, Qasr Ibrim was returned to the control of the Meroites, who restored the Taharqa temple and built another, larger one alongside it. Qasr Ibrim retained its strategic as well as its religious importance in the post-Meroitic period. It was seized for a time by the Blemmye nomads (see BEJA TRIBES) who settled in the Nile Valley following the Meroitic collapse, and afterward by the Nobadae, who drove out the Blemmyes. Texts found at Qasr Ibrim suggest that this was the earliest residence of the kings of NOBATIA; later they seem to have transferred their residence to FARAS. Early in the sixth century the Taharqa temple was made over into a church. This may well have been the earliest church building in Nubia, for archaeological evidence suggests that its conversion preceded the \"official\" Christianization of Nobatia in 543, as related by John of Ephesus. Other parts of the Taharqa temple complex\n\nwere apparently converted for a time into a monastery, but this was subsequently dismantled. A bishopric was established at Qasr Ibrim in the seventh century, and shortly afterward an impressive stone cathedral was begun. A smaller church was built alongside the cathedral at a later date. Meanwhile, most of the secular buildings at Qasr Ibrim seem to have been leveled, and the mountaintop became primarily a religious center in the early Middle Ages. Visitors' graffiti show that it was an important pilgrimage site, as it had been in Meroitic times. Nubia was invaded by an Ayyubid force under Shams al-Dawlah Turan Shah in 1172-1173, and the invaders temporarily seized Qasr Ibrim and damaged the cathedral. This event marked a turning point in the history both of the fortress and of Nubia. The town fortifications, which had been neglected, were now restored and heightened. Secular and commercial buildings began to appear again on the mountaintop alongside the churches. The eparch of Nobatia, who had formerly resided chiefly at Faras, transferred his main headquarters to Qasr Ibrim in the twelfth century. Meanwhile, the religious importance of the place continued. A bishop of Faras and Qasr Ibrim was consecrated at al-Fustat (modern-day Cairo) in 1372, and bishops of Qasr Ibrim are mentioned in a number of documents of still later date. After the medieval Nubian kingdom of MAKOURIA collapsed, its power in Lower Nubia was assumed by the splinter kingdom of DOTAWO. The capital or principal royal seat of this principality seems to have been at JABAL ‘ADDA, but Qasr Ibrim was also an important center within the kingdom. Many of the surviving documents that relate to the kingdom of Dotawo have been recovered from the excavations at Qasr Ibrim. The latest of these bears the date 1464. Qasr Ibrim may have been largely abandoned by the time the Ottomans took possession of Nubia early in the sixteenth century. They reoccupied and refortified the hilltop and made it one of their two principal control points within Nubia, the other being at SAI ISLAND. Part of the old cathedral was turned into a mosque, and the remainder of the structure was allowed to deteriorate. The original Ottoman garrison, according to local tradition, was of\n\nBosnian origin, and as a result the latter-day inhabitants of Qasr Ibrim were usually termed \"Bosnians\" both by themselves and by their neighbors. They remained in occupation until driven out by Mamluk refugees in 1810. These in their turn were expelled by artillery fire in the following year, and the 3,000-year history of the fortress came to an end. Excavations in the Qasr Ibrim fortress were begun in 1963 and have continued intermittently. The original fortress was perched so high above the Nile Valley floor that, unlike any other site in Lower Nubia, it has not been fully inundated by the waters of Lake Nasser. It is now a small island, about 5 acres (2 hectares) in extent, projecting above the lake surface. Some of the finds from Qasr Ibrim, particularly the textual finds, are of outstanding historical importance. They include letters relating to the BAQT treaty, to the commercial relations of the eparchs of Nobatia, and to the late medieval kingdom of Dotawo. Also important are the intact consecration scrolls of Bishop Timotheus, one in Coptic and one in Arabic, dated 1372. [See also: Nubian Church Organization.] BIBLIOGRAPHY Adams, W. Y.

About 5.5 miles (9 km) south of Khargah, Nisimah is a tiny square site 164 x 164 feet (50 x 50 m), perched on a till of low elevation in the middle of a small cultivated plain. In addition to a small fort (qasr) built on a base of stones and ordinary clay mortar 50 x 32 feet (15 x 10 m; maximum extant height 24 feet or 7.5 m) and a magnificent well-preserved columbarium, one may see the leveled down remains of a small church oriented from west to east (choir rounded to the east). The entrance door is in the north side wall. In the nave, along the north side, are two median columns of octagonal sections that perhaps had matching columns along the south side. This church of small dimensions 32 x 23 feet (9.5 x 7 m) is entirely comparable to that of SHAMS AL-DIN.

According to al-MAQRIZI, candles burned every month at the top of the tower of the fortress when the sun entered a new constellation of the zodiac. This conveyed the event to the population. In time Qasr al-Sham‘ came to designate a whole quarter of Old Cairo inhabited mainly by Copts. Four Coptic churches are still to be found in that part of Cairo: Church of al-Mu‘allaqah, Church of Abu Sarjah (Saint Sergius), Church of Sitt Barbarah (Saint Barbara), and Church of Mar Jirjis (Saint George). A fifth church, known as Qasriyyat al-Rihan (Church of Our Lady), burned down in 1979. BIBLIOGRAPHY Coquin, C. Les Edifices chrétiens du Vieux-Caire. Cairo, 1974. AZIZ S.

In Greek it was called Kynopolis ano (Upper Kynopolis). The SYNAXARION commemorates the martyrdom of Bisadah (Psoi) from al-Qays on 24 Tubah. Records indicate that the city was a bishopric in the Middle Ages. A bishop Maqarah of al-Qays attended a synod held in Cairo in 1078, and a bishop Butrus from the city was present at the preparation of the holy CHRISM in 1299 (Munier, 1943, pp. 27, 36).

RANDALL STEWART\n\n(CE:2038b-2040a) QIFT (Coptos), city on the east bank of the Nile, about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Luxor. It was already of some significance early on as the exit point of the desert routes to the Red Sea and to the quarries in the desert area. In the third century A.D. during the Palmyrene rebellion, the city fell into the hands of the Blemmyes and because of renewed resistance was besieged and destroyed by the emperor DIOCLETIAN in 292. However, the city soon recovered, although at first cities like Qus and Qina tried to take its place. Under JUSTINIAN, for a short time, it was called Justinianopolis (Kees, 1922, col. 1368), which may suggest the existence of a Chalcedonian community in the city. The city was known to be the seat of a bishop since the fifth century (Amélineau, 1893, p. 214). A bishop PHOIBAMMON from Coptos took part in the Council of EPHESUS in 431 (Munier, 1943, p. 14). Of Christian buildings within the area of the old city, only slight traces of a church have been found, but all the same it was a structure of large proportions. Contrary to normal tradition the basilica was oriented northwestward instead of northeastward, the width of the nave being roughly 31 feet (9.5 m). The sanctuary consisted of three rectangular rooms. Apparently because of the absence of an apse, the building was not recognized as a church by Reinach (1910, p. 39). The central main room that here took the place of the apse was connected with the eastern side room by a large opening in the wall. In front of the entrance to this main room, a crypt constructed of fired bricks was found under the floor. The baptistery was accommodated in an annex on the east side of the basilica. It contained an extraordinarily large octagonal pool with steps leading down into it on four sides—a rare feature in Egypt. In addition it was surrounded by a massive ciborium supported on four large octagonal granite columns. The axle width of the columns amounted to 23 feet (7 m). The church was constructed largely of spoil material from demolished pagan temples. Consequently it goes back at the earliest to the fifth century. To judge by the capitals used in the ciborium, the baptistery was actually constructed in the sixth century.\n\nRemains of a small, somewhat older building were found under the western section of the basilica. This also appears to have a northward orientation but only its apse has survived. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amélineau, E. La Géographie de l'Egypte a l'époque copte, pp. 21315. Paris, 1893. Fisher, H.

Qina was mentioned in a list of third-century bishoprics by George of Cyprus and occurs in medieval Coptic-Arabic scales, which suggests that the city has a long Christian tradition.

[This entry consists of two parts: The History of Qurnat Mar‘i, and the building of the Monastery of Mark the Evangelist.] History Qurnat Mar‘i is the name of ruins of a small hermitage built over an ancient tomb of a late period. It is on the north slope of the hill called Mar‘i, from the name of a Muslim saint buried on the summit, on the left bank of the Nile opposite Luxor. There is no ancient attestation. Winlock notes it in making his inventory of the monastic sites of the region (Winlock and Crum, Vol. 1, p. 15). U. Monneret de Villard believed he had found a church there with a plan approximating the churches of Georgia (pp. 495-500). The French Institute, which has the concession in this sector, excavated this site from 1971 to 1975, and reaped an abundant harvest of ostraca (2,000) and fragments of pottery, with and without decoration (more than 400 decorated pots that have been reassembled), but the results of this excavation have not yet been published. Only the general plan and a study of the mummies exhumed have been published (Castel, Vol. 2, pp. 121-43). The site was called the topos of Saint Mark the Evangelist. The term topos (\"place\" in Greek) indicates that this was not a true monastery (besides, there is no surrounding wall) but the center where each week, on Saturday and Sunday, hermits living in the caves or tombs of the neighborhood gathered together. This topos was already known from the documents of the region (see Winlock and Crum, Vol. 1, p. 108), but its precise position was not known. Its superior, Mark, was a priest who wrote various documents (Winlock and Crum, Vol. 1, p. 223). The plan published by Castel reveals a church and some adjoining rooms that are insufficient to constitute a true cenobium. Qurnat Mar‘i appears to have come to an end when the Muslim troops arrived, for the written documents do not show any Arab name. Perhaps it disappeared at the time of the Persian invasion\n\n(619-629), for a mummy of a monk shows that he died a violent death.

The Monastery of Epiphanius at Thebes, 2 vols. New York, 1926. MAURICE MARTIN, S.J. RENE-GEORGES COQUIN Monastery of Mark the Evangelist Set in the middle of the Theban necropolis, Qurnat Mar‘i dominates the ruins of the great pharaonic temples: the Ramesseum to the east and the temple of DAYR AL-MADINAH to the northwest. A narrow strip of desert separates it from the cultivated areas. The monastery is built on the northeast part of the hill, near the summit. It is oriented northeast/southwest, and with its terraces covers an area of about 15 yards (14m) on each side. Its archaeological material dates it to the sixth and seventh centuries. In its present form the monastery is composed of two buildings of mud brick. The main building, to the north and situated near the summit, occupies a natural terrace. Enclosed by high walls, it consists of communal rooms: in the center, the church with an apse; to the south, the refectory with two storage jars for water; to the west, a workroom with three loom pits; to the north, utility rooms and storage chambers. In the northwest corner of the building, an ancient pharaonic tomb drives into the rock. A small oratory is near the entrance to the tomb, and granaries occupy its lower part. The\n\nother building, south of the main building, includes three cells and a kitchen backing against the rock. These open directly on the access path to the monastery. These two buildings are separated by a passage. A spacious artificial platform to the east of the church was the monks' cemetery. Immediately south of the cells, on a lower level, two pharaonic tombs contained some materials dating from the period of the monastery. They were inhabited by monks of the small community. The pharaonic tomb and its court are the oldest part of the monastery. They were occupied by an anchorite, who left some graffiti in them. Then a chapel and communal buildings were built at the entrance to the tomb, in memory of this hermit. These structures underwent numerous alterations and extensions before acquiring their present appearance. The phases of construction may be summarized thus: 1. tomb and its court 2. first and second churches 3. rooms on the north, with kitchen on the outside of the monastery, to the northeast; 4. rooms on the south and west, with new kitchen to the southeast; 5. cells to the south of the main building, then eastern platform converted into a cemetery; 6. some secondary alterations when the monastery became a place of pilgrimage. The small size of the communal buildings, the few cells (fewer than six with the two neighboring pharaonic tombs), the arrangements for work (six looms in all), and the graves in the cemetery (five or six) indicate that even in its best days the community was one of five or six monks only. The numerous texts gathered up (about 1,400 Coptic ostraca and one in Greek) allow some insight into aspects of the daily life of this small community: weaving and trade in wine, for instance. The figure of Apa Markos, HEGUMENOS of the monastery, emerges from these letters.\n\nThe pottery (thousands of potsherds as well as 100 complete amphorae and remains of nearly 2,000 broken amphorae) includes a number of unpainted objects of various shapes: dishes, plates, cups, \"pseudo-sigillate\" bowls, kitchen ware, ovens, amphorae, water jars, basins, vats and mud bins. There is also another group consisting of a series of items with geometrical designs: vegetable or animal decoration. These are applied in either one or more colors, black or white on a red base, or in black or red on a lighter base (unpublished notes by Mme C. Neyret). All these elements show that the monastery of Mark the Evangelist had several stages of development: 1. a stage intermediate between the period of absolute independence for the hermits and the period of strict organization with clearly defined community rules, characterized by a series of cells or lauras scattered around the cell of a hermit of renown who had attracted monks and become their head; 2. a stage of organized community life within an enclosed space; 3. a stage at which the monastery was no longer occupied by monks and had become a place of pilgrimage.

From the Greek period onward (third century B.C.) it was known as Apollinopolis Parva. It evolved by taking advantage of the activities of QIFT, which the Greek kings had made the starting point for roads linking the Nile Valley and the ports on the Red Sea. But above all it was at that time a port on the Nile where the agricultural products of its environment were loaded. From the end of the third century A.D., its official name was changed to Diocletianopolis. No date can be fixed as regards the beginning of Christianity there. The SYNAXARION for 7 Tut commemorates a family of six, martyred at Alexandria but coming from the neighborhood of the town, where they confessed their faith and because of them a crowd of people believed. It was the seat of a bishop at least from the fifth century. In about the sixth century, the city was called by its current name, Qus. The ARAB CONQUEST OF EGYPT does not seem to have involved the settlement of a numerous Muslim community. Soon to be more important than Qift, which remained the administrative capital, Qus, which had basically a Christian population, no longer had any official role. When the Fatimids had established their power in Egypt, one of their first concerns was to attract again, by way of the Nile, the major trade of the Indian Ocean toward the Mediterranean; they hoped to divert this commerce from the routes it was then using through Abbasid territory. The Red Sea ports were again employed. ‘Aydhab, situated at the outlet of the region of the gold mines in the Wadi al-‘Allaqi, south of Aswan, became a busy anchorage. All the towns of Upper Egypt, and Qus in particular, found new prosperity. With the serious crises of the caliphate after 1067, the town was called upon to play a special role. The southern part of the Upper Sa‘id—and above all the Aswan region, toward which the caliph's black troops retreated when they were expelled from Cairo—was for nearly a decade ill-controlled by the authorities. The turbulence of the Arab tribes, which had abandoned their obedience to the caliph, also increased the insecurity. The Qus region seems to have been less troubled. It was thus natural that the ‘Aydhab caravan route,\n\nwhich until then had joined the Nile at Aswan, was diverted to Qus. The superior officer entrusted with the maintenance of order in the Upper Sa‘id established himself at Qus during the last quarter of the eleventh century. The town then became the administrative center of the entire Upper Sa‘id. A mint was established there in 1122, and in the second century of Fatimid rule, the military forces at the disposal of the governors of Upper Sa‘id made Qus into the most important station after the vizierate, a position that conferred de facto mastery of the Fatimid state. It is probable that the Shi‘ite caliphate had more readily chosen Qus as the new capital of Upper Sa‘id because the Muslims (among whom Sunnism was still the majority faith) were small in number and the greater part of the population was Christian. If the development of trading activities, which periodically enlivened the town during the commercial season, contributed to the enrichment of the Christian community, the benefits for its services to the Fatimid authorities gave the Christian community its strength. It was probably during this period that the dozen churches of Qus and its environs were built or rebuilt. These are listed in the description of the churches of Egypt that was compiled under the Ayyubids at the beginning of the thirteenth century. There Qus is not separated from what is then called \"the west of Qus,\" that is, the part on the west (opposite) bank of the Nile between Naqadah and Qamulah, and it seems that the preparation of the last recension of the SYNAXARION of Upper Egypt was made in one of the monasteries to the west of Qus in the twelfth century or at the beginning of the thirteenth. The Christian community of Qus must have seen its riches and power grow. We may suppose that Christian families from other centers in the valley came to swell their ranks. From the end of the eleventh century, the bishop of Qus made efforts to have it accepted that in the church he had precedence over the other bishops in the region. When subsequently around 1160, Shawar, the Muslim governor of the town, proposed to seize the vizierate by force, he thought it wise to conciliate the local Christian community by making a vow to Saint George in his church of al-‘Abbasah at the gates of the town. Yaqut, who produced his dictionary between 1215\n\nand 1224, stated after spelling the name of the town, \"it is a Coptic town.\" However, one could foresee that this situation would not last. A consequence of the choice of Qus as a regional center was the establishment in the town of a qadi (magistrate) of the Upper Sa‘id. And the advancement of Qus had also attracted many Muslim families, some very wealthy, who had left localities like Aswan or Isna to come and live there. The arrival of these Muslims also contributed to urban development. As was often the case at that period, the town must have had a somewhat casual and disorganized appearance due to built-up agglomerations—doubtless in part along the access roads—scattered around the old Christian center, which officially continued to be known as \"the town.\" Significantly, the qadi lived \"outside the town.\" The basic activities relating to the handling of goods arriving by road and leaving by the Nile also took place \"outside the town.\" The residence of the governors must have been on the outskirts of \"the town,\" not far from the Jami‘ al-‘Amri; it faced on a maydan (hippodrome or parade ground for the cavalry garrison), a feature characteristic of an age in which a foreign military unit of horse troops (increasingly of Turkish origin, and increasingly more dominant) put its stamp on the urban landscape. The presence of these representatives of the Muslim state also favored Islamization. The governors of the Ayyubid period increasingly surrounded themselves with educated Muslims, especially poets. Their official productions, being well received, could only strengthen the hitherto perhaps imperfect Arabic of the population and reinforce the power of attraction of the Muslim environment. Conversions to Islam took place. Moreover, Qus was not just an important spot on the main Indian Ocean trade route but also a staging-post on the way now favored by Muslim pilgrims to the Hijaz who wished to avoid the Crusaders' territories established in Palestine at the end of the eleventh century. Until the reconquest of Jerusalem by Salah al-Din a century later, there was no other route, and consequently pilgrims made use of it for a long time thereafter. Some of them, especially the Maghribins (those from North Africa), having gone through the town, returned to settle there. Thus gradually a coherent Muslim\n\nenvironment came into being. In 1210 Qus had its first madrasah (Islamic college). One can well imagine that during the second half of the century, under the first Mamluks, the Christian community ceased to be dominant, if not numerically then at least socially. In a town of indefinite limits, straggling between gardens, the old Christian center around the Church of Saint Stephen was for the Muslims of Qus just the \"Harat al-Nasara.\" (The term harah seems to have meant a distinct center of population but not a closed quarter, i.e., one of several similar sections of the agglomeration.) The two communities in the town, one expanding and the other on the defensive, came into confrontation toward the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. The situation especially lent itself to confrontation at Qus, though it cannot be separated from the more general Egyptian context. At Qus, as elsewhere, the dominant military class, that is, the sultan and the amirs, employed Christian secretaries who worked in the service of the diwan and saw to the collection of the fiscal revenues. Some elements of the taxes (e.g., those collected by the sultan himself in the whole of the northwestern part of the province of Qus) were levied on a peasantry that was still in large measure Christian. In others, many conversions to Islam had occurred, and the Christian secretaries found themselves in a delicate situation when they had to show strictness against Muslims. The town Muslims in particular accused them of showing bias in the exercise of their office, especially since some of the Christian secretaries reached high financial positions in the capital, from which they could intervene. The Muslim community, however, was also represented at Cairo, where from 1295 to 1302 a Muslim from Qus took on the responsibilities of the Grand Qadi. Consequently, local incidents were magnified in both directions as a result of external pressures. Often the Christian secretaries, backed by the Mamluk authorities (and therefore implicated with them), won the day. Toward the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century, during the period between the two great sultanates of Qalawun and al-Nasir Muhammad, and perhaps because power was so bitterly disputed among the amirs, the Muslim civil population became more insistent on exacting from the sultans and amirs a minimal favor from the\n\nChristian secretaries, namely, their forced conversion, and, by extension, stricter respect for the laws of Islam in an Islamic state. This was a show of opposition to the Mamluk authorities, who were ill tolerated, and a genuine religious demand. In 1300 most of the churches in Egypt had been closed for a year. It seems that the Christian community of Qus resolved to resist, gradually reopening the churches when it was possible to do so, sometimes with unwise demonstrations. They affirmed their exclusive presence in those parts of the city that they occupied, particularly in the Christian sector. To do this it was necessary on occasion to remove the Muslim places of worship that had been built among Christian dwellings. In 1307 an operation of this kind engendered a violent reaction from the Muslim population; thirteen Christian places of worship were attacked and destroyed in a single morning. The repressive action taken by the Mamluk authorities was severe, and similar events did not recur till the great crisis of 1321, which went beyond the town of Qus in its scope. Then six churches were again devastated, which indicates that in the interval at least a partial reconstruction had taken place. No later incidents are known. In fact, the general administrative development of the Muslim state under al-Malik al-Nasir Muhammad does not seem to have lessened the role of the Christian, or superficially converted, secretaries in the state. Quite the contrary. This is doubtless the period when Athanasius of Qus referred to the ignorance of his coreligionists of their own language, and drew up in Arabic his grammar of the Coptic language. This is an indication of a decline in the knowledge of Coptic; it is also a sign that the Christians nevertheless had a place in the administrative structures of the Arab-Muslim state. At Qus the destructive acts of 1307 and 1321 doubtless damaged the integrity of the Christian community, but they did not succeed in turning it into Muslim territory, which appears to have been one of the purposes for destroying churches. As to violence, which in general terms was hard on the Christians, we cannot say how the relationship between the two communities would have developed in the second part of the century had Qus remained a center of attraction for the Muslims of Upper Egypt.\n\nIn fact, the position of Qus gradually changed during the second half of the fourteenth century, as the town was no longer the most suitable spot in the upper valley to station troops for the maintenance of order (and in particular to control the bedouin tribesmen). The center of control, whatever kind it might be, now had to be located in the north at Asyut or, later, at Jirja, because of the establishment of routes from the West to Sudanese Africa and of the disequilibrium this had caused in the bedouin world. This disturbance of the equilibrium, moreover, in part occasioned the disorders of 1365-1366 in the eastern desert and the closure of the ‘Aydhab route. Gradually after that date, and after a serious drought suffered by the town and its region in 1374-1375, the spice trade ceased to pass through Qus. The plague of 1405-1406, which, according to al-MAQRIZI, claimed 17,000 victims at Qus, doubtless cleared out a good part of its population, and there was no longer anything to encourage people to come and settle. The governor of Qus was of only secondary importance under the Circassian Mamluks. As the structures of the Muslim state no longer operated to the advantage of the town, the Muslim community was affected by departures or by the absence of new settlements to fill the gaps made by the epidemics. Symbolic of this eclipse was the transfer of the qadi to Qina after the Ottoman occupation. The importance of the Christian community, therefore, began to increase in the town. This increase owed less to the exercise of fiscal service that governmental prohibitions sometimes called in question against the Christians than to the traditional activities of Qus, particularly textile craftsmanship and the export of its products to the upper valley of the Nile and probably to Ethiopia. We may suppose that relations between the Christian community of Qus and the Christians of Ethiopia, who were at the time feared by the Mamluk state, were not purely commercial. In 1430 a governor of Qus left to take service with the negus. When the dilapidated urban environs of the medieval period gradually fell into ruins, and especially in the seventeenth century, it was initially the peripheral Muslim part of the town that was affected. The Christian center around the Church of Saint Stephen, even if penetrated little by little by the Muslims, survived.\n\nAt the time of the French expedition at the end of the eighteenth century, in a town of less than 5,000 inhabitants, the proportion of Christians appeared to be significant. The proportion declined during the nineteenth century, when Qus again saw its population growing because of the rural exodus from the Islamized parts of the countryside. Some Coptic Christians became Protestants. Modern education made it possible for many to leave Qus. But the situation of the Christian community of Qus, which is no longer capital of the Upper Sa‘id, no longer differs in any way from that of the other Christians of Upper Egypt.

JEAN-CLAUDE GARCIN\n\n(CE:2046a-2047b)\n\nQUSTANTIN IBN ABI AL-MA‘ALI IBN ABI AL-FATH ABU AL-FATH, fourteenth-century Melchite of Cairo who belonged to a family of important state officials. Qustantn must have been born around 1270, as his son was already a bishop in 1358. He knew Greek extremely well and had a fine Arabic style. He composed at least two works, both liturgical. Near the end of his life he withdrew to the Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai. This summary of information about him derives from an autograph manuscript dated 1335 (Sinai Arabic 264, containing 206 sheets, not yet published or studied). The first of his works, Kitab al-Hadi fi Ma‘rifat al-Samadi, appears not to have survived, though it is mentioned by the author in the second colophon of his Typikon (fol. 204b), which shows that it was composed prior to 1355. Speaking of John of Damascus he says, \"For, during the vizierate of his father, at the time of the King Heraclius, Damascus was taken from the Greeks in the year 6148 of the world. Now this saint succeeded his father as vizier, as I explained in the book I composed and entitled, Al-Hadi fi Ma‘rifat al-Samadi in the chapter of the cheironomia.\" The last word of the title poses a problem, since the meaning of the word al-samadi is not clear. For that reason, A. S. Atiya and J. N. Youssef (p. 492) read it al-samawi, the heavenly. They have been followed by J. Nasrallah (1981, p. 150). But there is no doubt that it must be read al-samadi, for two reasons: first, because of the very clear handwriting of the autograph; and second because of the rhyme with al-Hadi, which is an essential element in old Arabic titles. Qustantin agreed to translate the Typikon of Saint Sabas into Arabic at the request of one who \"loved virtue.\" The Typikon is the manual giving dispositions for all the liturgical ceremonies, especially the recitation of the divine office; the Typikon of Saint Sabas was used in the Arabic East, and was composed by Saint John of Damascus. Qustantin completed his translation on Tuesday, 5 December 6844 of the world/5 December A.D. 1355 (fol. 203a).\n\nThe Greek manuscript that served as a basis for Qustantin's translation was copied by Hesychius, monk of Saint Sabas. He completed his copy on Monday, 20 April 1187. On two occasions (fols. 197a and 204b), Qustantin states that this manuscript may have been copied from the original copy of John of Damascus. This Greek manuscript bore an act of bequest in favor of the monastery of Saint Sabas. Nevertheless, in 1355, it was in Cairo, in the Greek quarter (HARIT AL-RUM), in the Church of the Forty Martyrs (fol. 204b). It was there that Qustantin translated it. Shortly afterward, Qustantin donated his translation to his own son, Marqus, the Melchite bishop of Damietta, for his use during his lifetime, on condition that it should subsequently be bequeathed to the Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai. The act of donation is dated Wednesday, 28 February 1358. It is remarkable that Marqus wrote the date in Coptic cursive figures. The manuscript found its way to Sinai shortly afterward, as is indicated in a note written by the bishop of Sinai, who was also called Marqus and who was probably the same one mentioned in the Sinai Arabic 90. It should be noted that the bishop of Damietta speaks of his father as \"the lord [my] father,\" which suggests a man who was highly respected socially. After this date, Qustantin entered the Monastery of Saint Catherine, as his wife had died and his children were already independent. He wore the monastic habit and took the name Antuniyus, as is indicated in a later note added in the margin of the colophon (fol. 203b). The manuscript contains 206 sheets, but folios 205-206, which were blank, were filled by two different hands that can be dated as the end of the fourteenth century, probably on Mount Sinai. The other folios contain the following: Fols. 1b-2b: translator's preface in fine rhymed prose Fols. 2b-6b: translation of the Agrypniai, or night vigils preceding solemn feasts Fols. 6b-21a: translation of the Ordo of Matins Fols. 21a-135a: translation of the ordinary of the whole year, from September to August\n\nFols. 135b-97a: translation of the periods of Lent, Easter, and Pentecost Fols. 197b-99a: translator's note explaining that this is the office of monks, and indicating how this office should be adapted for lay people Fols. 199a-203a: Six translator's notes on certain feasts, namely the Exaltation of the Cross, the Vigil of Christmas, the Vigil of the Epiphany, the Lent of the Apostles, Holy Week, and the Washing of Feet Fols. 203a-203b: first colophon Fols. 203b-204a: two notes concerning the eleven days on which the Liturgy of Saint Basil is celebrated, and Dissidents' Week Fol. 204b: second colophon. The sections composed by Qustantin are written in an elevated style, in fine rhymed prose. Occasionally the author has employed terms so rare that readers have added explanations in the margin. Apart from the autograph manuscript, another manuscript exists (Mar Elias Shuwayya, 30). This was copied by the deacon Saba ibn Tadurus al-Hawrani at the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist at Duma (Lebanon) between 4 June 1594 and 16 March 1595. However, Qustantin's name has been omitted, and this caused Nasrallah to think that the translation was the work of the deacon Saba. He has recently corrected this error (Nasrallah, 1981, p. 149, n. 195). What is more, in the preface the copyist added an interpolation to the effect that Patriarch Gregory the Sinaite had translated the Agrypniai into Arabic. Since he speaks of the \"deceased patriarch,\" Nasrallah deduced that Gregory the Sinaite, who became Melchite patriarch of Alexandria, died before 1355, the date of composition of the preface (Nasrallah, 1981, p. 149). The truth of the matter is that the two lines on Patriarch Gregory are an addition on the part of Saba ibn Tadurus; moreover, they interrupt the sentence and spoil the rhyme. Thus Gregory died before 1594 and not before 1355. According to Nasrallah (1963, p. 167), the end is missing in this manuscript. It lacks the translation of the periods of Easter and Pentecost and the explanations and notes composed by Qustantin.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Arranz, M., S.J.

The information collected there by Porphyry Ouspensky in 1850 places al-Rayah, or at least its ruins, on the edge of the sea, two hours' march south of al-Tur (see also Maspero and Wiet, 1919, pp. 98-99). In the neighborhood of this town several sites were inhabited by anchorites or cenobites. It cannot be stated with any precision at what date the first ascetics established themselves there. The APOPHTHEGMATA PATRUM mentions Raithou several times, but this collection brings together pieces of very diverse origin and period, which therefore are difficult to date. Similarly, there are no certain documents for fixing the date of the martyrdom of the forty monks at Raithou, perhaps fourth or fifth century, massacred by Blemmyes or Agarenes (Devreesse, 1940, pp. 216-21). Although it is very probable that Sinai was inhabited by monks from the fourth century on, the sources do not confirm their presence at Raithou before the beginning of the fifth century. Amun of Raithou paid a visit to Sisoes at Clysma (Apophthegmata patrum, Sisoes 26); Sisoes did not install himself there before 429 (Chitty, 1966, p. 79, n. 83). Three anchorites from Raithou came before 428 to join Euthymius in his laura near Jerusalem (Festugière, 1962, p. 79). A solitary from Raithou named Zosimus became the disciple of Peter the Iberian (c. 409-489) toward the middle of the fifth century. Generally dated to the sixth century, the report of Ammonius, who was a monk of Canopus near Alexandria, and also a pilgrim to Jerusalem and then to Sinai, where he gathered up the history of the martyrs of Raithou and of Sinai, describes a semi-anchoritism at Raithou very similar to that of Egypt. Ammonius notes that at Raithou only one of the hermits \"who lived separately in caves\" was a Roman, which, Tillemont (1732) remarks, leads one to think that the others were autochthonous. We know that at the Council of CONSTANTINOPLE in 536 a monk-priest named Theonas represented not only the mountain of Sinai but also the \"laura\"\n\n(some manuscripts say the desert) of Raithou (Schwartz, Vol. 3, pp. 37, 51, 130; see the index); Eutychius (Sa‘id ibn Batriq) states that a delegation of monks from Sinai asked Emperor JUSTINIAN (527565) to build monasteries to protect them against the raids of the Blemmyes and the Arabs. The text states that a monastery was built at Rayah (Vol. 2, pp. 202-03). It is known that the monastery of the Virgin in Sinai was completed in 556 (Stein, Vol. 2, p. 300). The Nestorian traveler known as COSMAS INDICOPLEUSTES, whose report was written between 547 and 549, speaks of the monastery of Raithou, where Menas, one of his traveling companions, became a monk. He identifies Raithou with the biblical Elim, where twelve springs flowed. John Climacus (c. 570-649) wrote his famous Ladder of Divine Ascent at the request of John, HEGUMENOS of Raithou, with whom he exchanged letters. This was perhaps the same man who is called John the Cilician in the Pratum spirituale of John Moschus (c. 550-619). The last source mentions three anchorites at Raithou. It was also a monk of Raithou, named Daniel, who wrote the life of John Climacus. Apart from two rather vague references to the monk Epiphanius (perhaps in the ninth century) and to Daniel of Ephesus (in the fifteenth century), we find no further reference to monks at Raithou until the travelers of the sixteenth century. The first sixteenth-century mention of a monastery in this part of the Sinai Peninsula is by Jean Thenaud in 1512 (p. 81). He notes that there is no potable water at al-Tur; one must seek it \"half a French league from there, near the sumptuous ruined monastery which Justinian once had built, the abbot of which was Saint John, to whom John Climacus addressed his book on the spiritual life (The Ladder of Paradise).\" He, too, associates Raithou with the twelve springs of Elim. In 1588, the Russian merchant Basil Posniakoff wrote of the \"monastery of Saint John of Raithou, ruined from top to bottom by the accursed Turks,\" at \"three versts [a little more than 2 miles/3 km] from al-Tur\" (Volkoff, p. 28). Claude SICARD visited the site in 1720, but says very little about it; the monastery is that of John of Raithou, friend of John\n\nClimacus, and there are still gardens and caves in good condition. On his map of 1722 he places the monastery a little to the north of the well of sweet water and of Elim. The archimandrite Ouspensky noted in 1850 that the monastery dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and founded by Justinian had been destroyed by al-Hakim at the beginning of the eleventh century and had become the cemetery for the Christians of al-Tur. It is remarkable that all the Russian travelers designate the town of alTur by the name of Raithou. Ouspensky notes that the ancient Raithou was at the place today called Rayah, and that ruins are still visible: a fortress and a well of sweet water. He adds that near the Jabal Hammam Sidna Musa, three and a half hours' march northwest of al-Tur, there are hermitages and a church fitted up in caves. He thus clearly distinguishes the cenobium of Justinian to the northeast and the hermitages near the sea to the northwest. The latter, of a type common in Egypt, are well described by Wellsted (1838, Vol. 2, pp. 15-19), at a place called al-Wadi. BIBLIOGRAPHY Chitty, D. J. The Desert a City. London, 1966.

He excelled in designing brick vaults and domes, a form inherited from early dynasties, and in creating oriental stained glass windows from plaster and colored glass chips, for which he won the National Arts Award in 1961. He designed a Coptic school in QASR AL-SHAM‘ in Old Cairo and the junior school of the French Lycée at Bab-al-Luq. He collaborated with Hassan Fathy on the village of al-Qurnah near Luxor. The best-known works of Ramses Wissa Wassef are the two Coptic cathedrals of Zamalek and Heliopolis, his own house at ‘Ajuzah in Cairo, the complex of tapestry workshops at Harraniyyah, the chapel of the Dominican convent at ‘Abbasiyyah, and the Moukhtar Museum at Gezira. The Harraniyyah workshops were the culmination of Wassef's philosophy that children have innate artistic creativity. Choosing the medium of tapestry weaving he experimented, with parental consent, with selected children from the elementary school at Qasr al-Sham‘. He felt weaving to represent a balanced fusion between art and manual labor. The looms were vertical and simple to handle; wool came from local sources and was dipped in natural dyes. Inspiration came from within each child. The experiments proved successful. From the first show organized by UNESCO in Paris in January 1950, exhibits were shown in Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Germany, England, Italy, and the United States. In September 1983 he was posthumously awarded the Agha Khan \"Grand Prix\" for the architectural ensemble conceived,\n\ncreated, and executed by him at Harraniyyah village in the province of Giza.

CÉRÈS WISSA WASSEF\n\n(CE:2052a-2052b)\n\nRAMSHAUSEN,\n\nFRANCISCUS\n\nWILHELM\n\nVON\n\n(seventeenth century), German Coptologist. Born in the small town of Quakenbruck in Westphalia, he studied theology in the Lutheran tradition and read widely the travel works on Egypt, particularly the writings of the Jesuit Athanasius KIRCHER, whose experiences among the Copts must have influenced him greatly in his studies. He wrote and published a comprehensive doctoral thesis on the Copts and submitted it to the University of Jena in the year 1666. Written in Latin, his own work has the composite title of tekkl/cia nkef] (tekklesia Nkefti) sive Exercitatio Theologica, Ecclesia Copticae, Hoc Est Christianorum Aegyptiacae Ortum, Progressum Praecipuaque Doctrinae. . . . The book has been described by W. Kammerer in A Coptic Bibliography (1950, 1969) as \"probably the oldest European work on the Copts,\" a verdict confirmed by A. Mallon in his renowned Grammaire copte. Von Ramshausen's approach to the subject is systematic, original, and thorough. Starting with the definition of the word \"Copt,\" he discussed the Coptic language in its hieroglyphic background. Then he discussed the Coptic Bibles and other Coptic manuscripts available at his time. Next, he dealt with the history of the Coptic church and Coptic persecutions and heresies in Egypt, extending his panoramic view of Coptic Egypt beyond the sixth century. Coptic dogmas, sacraments, and rituals are also treated at a time when the West was oblivious of that nation in the framework of Eastern Christianity. In this way, von Ramshausen laid a solid basis for the study of the Coptic language and Coptic church history for subsequent generations of scholars in the West. He drew attention to the antiquity of the Coptic church fathers and to the establishment of the Coptic church by Saint MARK, its first patriarch. He was outspoken in his sympathy for the ancient church. He appears to have had access to historical material no longer available, which enhances the value of his writing. The genuine contribution of von Ramshausen's work is his objectivity in dealing with the Coptic church, which makes it overshadow subsequent works by even so great a scholar as\n\nRenaudot, whose Liturgiarum Orientalium Collectio (1716) was apparently more critical and unsympathetic than his predecessor's. This alone entitles von Ramshausen to a place in the story of Coptology.

The Hebrew word repha’el can mean \"God has healed.\" Latin authors such as Gregory the Great (Evangelia Homiliarum 34.9) interpreted the name as \"medicine of God.\" In a Coptic text (Kropp, 1930, Vol. 2, p. 165) it has the meaning of \"cure.\" The archangel Raphael appears for the first time in Tobit (3rd century B.C.), written by a Jew of the Diaspora, probably in Egypt. Here Raphael introduces himself as one of the seven angels who present the prayers of the just to God and who stand in the presence of God (Tb. 12:15). Hence the many guises under which he helps men. Under the symbolic name of Azarias (\"the Lord helps\"), he accompanies the young Tobias, son of Tobit, on his journey to Raguel of Medes in Ecbatana, where Tobias meets Sarah (Tb. 5:13;7:7). On the way to Raguel, Raphael frees Tobias from a monstrous fish that attacks him as he is bathing in the river Tigris (6:1-3); he later saves Sarah and Tobias from the snares of the devil Asmodeus, who has killed Sarah's previous seven husbands (6:14;8:3). Finally, as the etymology of his name indicates, he cures the blindness of Tobit, the father of Tobias (11:7-14). In 1 Enoch, Raphael is one of the four archangels, together with MICHAEL, Suriel (or Uriel), and GABRIEL (1 En. 9.1; 10.4-8), or as one of the seven (1 En. 20.3). Since Raphael is the angel of men's souls, he accompanies Enoch on his heavenly journey and explains the distribution of souls in the various sections of sheol after death (1 En. 22.3-6). He also appears with Enoch in the paradise of righteousness and tells him of the tree of wisdom (1 En. 32.6). In Enoch's vision, the archangel Raphael is charged by God to bind Asael hand and foot and to heal earth, which the angels have corrupted (1 En. 10.4-8; 54.6). This charge appropriately reflects the double meaning of the root rapha, \"to tie\" and \"to heal.\" Raphael is also said to have power over illness and wounds (1 En. 40.9). In the Apocalypse of Ezra, after Michael the archangel has departed, Raphael ministers to Ezra under the title of commander-in-chief of the angels (Apoc. Esd. 1.4). He is also said to be present at the end of men's lives (Apoc. Esd. 6.1f.). In the Apocalypse of Moses, with\n\nother angels he takes part in the burial of Abel next to Adam (Apoc. Mos. 40). In postbiblical Jewish literature further details are added, such as Raphael's visit to Abraham (Gn. 18; bT Joma 37a), his curing of pious men, and his overpowering of savage beasts. He is also said to preside over one of the four cohorts of angels surrounding the throne of God. In Christian literature he appears as one of the four, or seven, archangels created first of all by God (Evangelium Bartholomaei 4.29), and, in accordance with the etymology of his name, he is held to be the angel of healing, patron of medicine (Origen Homilies on Numbers 14.2; De principiis 1.8.1), and heavenly doctor. This is why some, according to ORIGEN, represent him as a serpent (Contra Celsum 6.30). As with Tobias, Raphael guides men on their journeys and for their sake overpowers the demon Asmodeus. He helps them to earn their living and is present at the hour of death. With Michael, Gabriel, and other angels, he has the power to punish Satan (Ev. Barthol. 4.29). In Coptic literature we know of only two encomia, undoubtedly pseudepigraphic, dedicated to the archangel Raphael. One is attributed to Saint JOHN CHRYSOSTOM and is conserved in the British Museum, ed. Budge, 1915, pp. 526-33, 1189-91 [texts]; 1034ff., 1199 [trans.]. Here, as in Tobit, Raphael binds the wicked demon Asmodeus with fetters, and his name is given the meaning of \"God who guideth men.\" The episodes of Tobit are recalled, along with the fact that Raphael filled the poor man's house with joy and the rich man's with health (fol. 3b). Besides taking the prayer of Sarah to the seventh heaven, he is a faithful servant who accepts no payment; he is obedient to God and to the man for whom he prepares meals as a chief cook (fols. 4a-b). He is also the patron of the wedding. The appearance of Raphael to Saint JOHN CHRYSOSTOM while he was celebrating mass is narrated in this encomium (fol. 6a). Raphael is shown as the guardian angel of Chrysostom, whom he has not abandoned \"for a single hour, half an hour, or the blink of an eye\" (fol. 6b). Raphael sends Chrysostom to the emperor Arcadius, who builds a shrine in his honor. The other encomium, in Sahidic, In Raphaelem archangelis, is attributed to the patriarch THEOPHILUS OF ALEXANDRIA;\n\nfragments are conserved in the libraries of Paris, Naples, and Vienna [identified and edited with a Latin translation by Orlandi, (1972)]. The fragments belong to two codices from the White Monastery (DAYR ANBA SHINUDAH). The encomium is a homily given in the presence of Theodosius II and contains a conversation of Theophilus with the Emperor Theodosius I concerning the building of a shrine in honor of the archangel Raphael in Alexandria, and also the initiation of his cult in the city by a Roman widow called Dronice. Later the narrative tells of the building of the shrine on the island of Patres and of two miracles: the rescue of some people who were shipwrecked and the recovery of a ship, and the liberation from barbarians who wished to sack the island. The data that the homily gives concerning the construction of the shrine agree with those found in the HISTORY OF THE PATRIARCHS OF ALEXANDRIA (in Arabic, PO 1, pp. 426-30). Five homilies in honor of Saint Raphael have been preserved in Arabic, one of which is attributed to CYRIL I of Alexandria on the feast of the consecration of the church built by Theophilus (3 Nasi/26 August) (On these homilies, see Muller, 1959, n. 131.) Other writings in Coptic tell us that Raphael was the fourth angel to be created, after Saklitaboth, Michael, and Gabriel (Installatio Michaelis, ed. Müller, 1962, n. 3), and that his installation took place after that of Michael and Gabriel (Muller, 1962, n. 9); no date to commemorate this is given, however, suggesting that there was no feast to celebrate his installation. Raphael has an important role in exorcism texts (Stegemann, 1934, pp. 69-70; Kropp, 1930-1931, pp. 3 and 82). He dispenses the holy oil for healing (Coptic Evangelium Bartholomaei 85f., ed. Kropp, 1930-1931, vol. 1, p. 80, and vol. 2, p. 250) and he is the protector against fever and the angel of strength and good health (Kropp, 1930-1931, Vol. 1, p. 20, and Vol. 2, p. 203). He is also invoked in a blessing for success in fishing (Kropp, 1930-1931, Vol. 1, p. 33, and Vol. 2, p. 99). All the traits attributed to Raphael in these texts are derived from his activities as narrated in Tobit. When he is mentioned with other arcangels, he comes after Michael and Gabriel. In the Coptic liturgy Raphael is the third archangel. His feast is celebrated on 3 Nasi, although in the\n\nencomium attributed to Chrysostom, it was the fourth of the epagomenic (intercalary) days (4 Nasi). Sixteen doxologies or hymns in his honor are known (Müller, 1959, pp. 48-53); these emphasize that he is a servant and instrument of God. He does nothing on his own account—it is God who acts through his intercession. The chief characteristic of Raphael is joy, since he brought joy to the ancient parents of Tobias. On occasions he appears closely united to John the Baptist and the Emperor Theodosius. His cult does not appear to have been particularly widespread, since only one church is mentioned as being dedicated to him. As with other angels, the Coptic tradition relates appearances of Raphael to several saints, such as the martyrs Philotheus and Paese. He is also credited with having miraculously freed the Emperor Theodosius from being swallowed by a shark. BIBLIOGRAPHY Budge, E. A. T. W. Miscellaneous Coptic Texts, pp. 526-33, 118991.

GONZALO ARANDA PÉREZ\n\n(CE:2054b-2055a) RASHID (Rosetta), city in the Egyptian Delta situated west of Lake Burullus, some 26 miles (42 km) northwest of Damanhur near the Nile mouth known as Masabb Rashid. In Greek the city was known as Bolbitine. Westerners know the place as Rosetta, a name famous for the stone found not far from the city that provided the key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. In Christian-Arabic sources from the Arabic period, Rashid is first mentioned in connection with the heresy of the BARSANUPHIANS and Gaianites (see GAIANUS). The HISTORY OF THE PATRIARCHS relates that during the patriarchate of ALEXANDER II (705-730), Bishop John of Sa contended successfully with at least one of these groups in Rashid. It is not clear from the text, however, which of the two groups was active in the city. Elsewhere in the History we read that in 749-750, during one of the BASHMURIC REVOLTS, the Coptic Bashmurites killed the Muslims in Rashid and set the city on fire. Rashid appears in the medieval Coptic lists of Egyptian bishoprics, but it is not known when the city first became a bishopric. The first bishops of Rashid of whom we have record were in office in the eleventh century. Bishop Yustus of Rashid attended a synod in Cairo in 1086 (Munier, 1943, p. 28). Bishop Theodorus of Rashid is mentioned for this same period, but the record does not indicate whether he was the predecessor or the successor of Yustus. Historical sources for the Crusades mention Rashid often, but they provide no information about the fate of the city's Christian inhabitants. However, the fact that a manuscript was dedicated to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Mark in Rashid sometime around 1799 bespeaks a continuity of Coptic Christians in the city until at least the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Like ANACHORESIS, reclusion is a form of separation from the world, a fundamental element of the monastic ideal. Much practiced among the monks of Syria, it was also practiced in Egypt from the earliest days of monasticism. Saint ANTONY himself lived for a long time as a recluse before his great anachoresis in the Arabian Desert. First he spent about ten years shut up in a tomb not far from his village, provisioned by a friend who brought him bread from time to time. Thereafter he lived for about twenty years shut up in an abandoned Roman fort. The most celebrated Egyptian recluse was JOHN OF LYCOPOLIS, who is known from chapter 35 of the Lausiac History of PALLADIUS and the first chapter of the HISTORIA MONACHORUM IN AEGYPTO. He lived to a very advanced age in a three-room cave about five miles from Lycopolis (Asyut). One room was reserved for prayer; in another room a window opened on a vestibule in which the numerous visitors waited to converse with John on Saturdays and Sundays. No one ever entered his cell, and he himself never left it. The Historia monachorum (chap. 6) mentions another recluse named Theonas, whose cell was in the neighborhood of Oxyrhynchus. He communicated with his visitors only in writing, for he had vowed perpetual silence. He came out only at night to gather the plants that were his food. There also were some recluses in Lower Egypt. The APOPHTHEGMATA PATRUM mentions some among the monks of the deserts of NITRIA and SCETIS. Reclusion must be distinguished from the residence in the cell to which the monks in these deserts were constrained. They could leave their cells to visit one another, and above all to participate at the end of the week in the meal taken in common and in the liturgy celebrated in the church. But the recluse remained shut up in his cell and did not come out, even to go to church (cf. Nau, 1907, pp. 56-58). In certain cases, a priest came to celebrate the Eucharist in the recluse's cell. Since he never left his cell, the recluse used the services of a faithful layman to obtain what he required. It was not necessary to withdraw to the desert to practice reclusion. A young Alexandrian named\n\nTheodorus, who later became a disciple of PACHOMIUS, lived for twelve years in quarters that the patriarch ATHANASIUS had fitted up for him in the church, where he acted as a reader. Reclusion was a form of solitary life better suited for women than anachoresis in the desert. The Apophthegmata patrum notes some cases of women recluses, such as the former prostitute converted by Serapion. Palladius heard in Alexandria of a young woman named Alexandra who, having left the town, shut herself in a tomb; she remained there until her death, ten years later, without seeing anyone, receiving what she required through an opening in the wall (Palladius, chap. 5). This voluntary reclusion is evidently very different from the reclusion imposed upon monks guilty of serious faults. Some monasteries, like those of Pachomius and SHENUTE, had, in fact, prisons. Inspired by a purely religious motive, reclusion could appeal to the word of Jesus in Matthew 6:6: \"When you pray, go to your private room and shut the door, and pray to your Father who is in secret.\" Several historians (among them Bouché-Leclercq) have maintained, following H. Weingarten, that reclusion among the monks was a survival within Christianity of the way of life of men who lived in the Serapeum at Memphis, to whom the Greek papyri give the name katochoi, a term generally translated as \"recluse.\" This thesis was refuted as early as 1920-1922 by P. Gobillot. Even retaining the meaning of \"recluse,\" which has been contested by E. Preuschen, according to whom the katochoi were \"possessed,\" the motives for this reclusion are not very clear and have been debated. K. Sethe saw recluses simply as prisoners, most often shut up for debt. For L. Delekat, they were people in difficulty who had taken refuge in the temple, claiming the right of asylum. According to these diverse hypotheses, the reclusion of the katochoi does not appear to be inspired by any religious motive, which is essential in monastic reclusion.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Bouché-Leclercq, A. \"Les reclus du Sérapéum de Memphis.\" In Mélanges Perrot.

ANTOINE GUILLAUMONT\n\n(CE:2056a-2057a) REFECTORY, \"table of the brethren,\" a standard element of monastery architecture, especially in cenobite monasticism, the room in which the monks took their common meals. According to the oldest examples so far identified in Egypt (Grossmann, 1982, pp. 162-63), the monks did not sit at long tables as is the custom today. Instead, they sat on benches arranged in the form of a circle, just as the Egyptian country folk still do during their work breaks in the fields. In the same way, the couches for the ancient meals for the dead, such as are found at al-Bagawat (Grossmann, 1982, pp. 7879), are arranged in a semicircle. The seating arrangement of the meal described in the Coptic life of Shenute of Atrib during his stay in Constantinople (Amélineau, 1888, p. 43, fol. 48v) may not have been very different. In order to accommodate as many such rings of seats as possible in one room, the refectories in Egypt were built with several aisles. The individual aisles were of equal width, and one ring of seats was provided for each of the bays formed by the columns. Most refectories contain two or three aisles. The largest examples so far identified in Egypt are the two refectories of DAYR ALBALAY’ZAH, which both have three aisles. The refectories in the great Pachomian monasteries were probably similar. Very small refectories have only a single pillar standing in the middle of the room; the room is divided by arches thrown across to the four sides into four bays of roughly equal size (e.g., the present chapel of Mar Jirjis at DAYR ANBA BISHOI; cf. Evelyn-White, 1933, Vol. 3, pp. 161-62; DAYR AL-BARAMUS, the actual \"monastic henhouse\"; and Qasr al-Wizz). In the late Fatimid period, a middle-sized type was developed with four pillars and nine symmetrically arranged bays (e.g., DAYR AL-FAKHURI at Isna and Dayr Anba Bishoi in Wadi al-Natrun; cf. Evelyn-White, 1933, Vol. 3, p. 165, where this is described as \"a large and nearly square building\"). The rings of seats were in several cases built of bricks. In the refectory of DAYR ANBA HADRA, they were distributed remarkably irregularly. The equipment of the refectory also included a water jug stand and, in later times, a lectern. In addition, the\n\nkitchen and storerooms were logically accommodated in the neighborhood of the refectory. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amélineau, E. C., ed.

The massacre was at the hands of DECIUS, Roman governor of the region under Emperor Maximian. According to legend, during her martyrdom, Regula survived even after being dipped into boiling cobbler's wax and being forced to drink glowing lead. Like her comrades, she was beheaded, and with them she arose, carrying her head, and walked forty ells uphill to her resting place. Along with Felix and Saint EXUPERANTIUS, also in the legion, Regula occupies a special place in the history of Zurich. Two great churches, the Grossmünster and the Wasserkirche, and a significant cloister beyond the river Limmat as well as the Frauenmünster, were erected to honor and house the relics of the saints. The headless figures of Felix, Regula, and Exuperantius, heads in hands, are depicted on the coats of arms of both the city and the canton of Zurich. BIBLIOGRAPHY Hottinger, J.

This refrain may take one of several forms: (1) it may be one fixed word, such as \"Alleluia,\" in the psalmody of the Coptic month of Kiyahk; (2) it may be a fixed group of words, such as \"For His mercy endures forever\"; \"O Lord Jesus Christ help me\" in the Sunday psalmody; or \"My Lord Jesus Christ, my good Savior\" in the Saturday psalmody; (3) it may be a short petition, such as \"Restore us, O God, and let Thy face shine, that we may be saved,\" which recurs three times in Psalm 80, or \"Lord have mercy\" (Kyrie Eleison), which is reiterated throughout the Divine Liturgy. The choice of the appropriate category of liturgical chant— tractus (where a single cantor sings and the congregation listens), antiphon (where two alternating groups of singers take their turns), or responsory—depends primarily on the particular time of the day or night when it is to be used. Thus, at vespers, which is a comparatively short service, the tractus system is the one usually followed, whereas in long night vigils, the responsory proves to be more suitable. It may be of particular interest to mention in this respect, that when in February 356 a military detachment invaded the church where Saint ATHANASIUS was celebrating a vigil service, the congregation was asked to join in a responsory. Here is the episode in full in the words of Athanasius, taken from his \"Apologia de fuga\" (Apology for Flight): It was night, and some of the people were keeping vigil, for a communion was expected. A body of soldiers suddenly advanced upon them, consisting of a general [Syrianus] and five thousand armed men with naked swords, bows and arrows and clubs. . . . I deemed that I ought not in such a time of confusion to leave the people, but that I ought rather to be the first to meet the danger; so I sat down on my throne and desired the deacon to read a psalm, and the people to respond \"For His mercy endureth forever.\" Then I bade them all return to their own houses. But now the general with the soldiery forced his\n\nway into the church, and surrounded the sanctuary in order to arrest me. The clergy and the laity who had remained clamorously besought me to withdraw. This I firmly refused to do until all the others had retreated. I rose, had a prayer offered, and directed all the people to retire. \"It is better,\" said I, \"for me to meet the danger alone, than for any of you to be hurt.\" When the greater number of the people had left the church, and just as the rest were following, the monks and some of the clergy who had remained came up and drew me out. And so, may the truth be my witness, the Lord leading and protecting me, we passed through the midst of the soldiers, some of whom were stationed around the sanctuary, and others marching about the church.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Iqladiyus Yuhanna Labib.

The term Agha in his name is a Turkish title granted by the viceroy to governors of provinces. Apparently he was active in repelling Arab marauders from the area east of the Damietta branch of the Delta and the establishment of security in that region. He founded a series of estates bearing his name in the district of Mit Ghamr. Muhammad ‘Ali's eldest son, Ibrahim Pasha, was received by him as his honored guest together with Mu‘allim GHALI in March 1822. After leaving Mit Ghamr, Ghali precipitated the wrath of the pasha, who murdered him and cast his body outside the district of Zifta. On hearing what happened to his fellow Copt, Rizq hastened to the pasha's presence and pleaded for the recovery of Ghali's body, which he took to the nearest Coptic church prior to burial. Rizq is one of the few Copts in the administration who happened to retain their position until their death. He left behind him a family of notable Copts and his name is still remembered in the district of Mit Ghamr. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ramzi Tadrus. Al-Aqbat fi al-Qarn al-Ishrin, 5 vols. Cairo, 19111919. AZIZ S. ATIYA\n\n(CE:2059b-2061a) ROMANCES. There are two Coptic romances: the Alexander Romance and the Cambyses Romance. The Alexander Romance All genres of literature—from history to poetry—include chronicles of the life of Alexander the Great of Macedonia (reigned 336-323 B.C.). The most widespread work, the Alexander Romance, is falsely ascribed to the Greek historian Callisthenes (c. 370-327 B.C.). In different forms, whether varying recensions, synopses, or entirely new collections, the Alexander Romance filtered into the Middle East and later into the West. As a result, the history of the transmission of the work has become very complicated. The Coptic version played an active role in that transmission. Probably during the sixth century, a text translated from Greek into Coptic was revised and perfected, and it gained an independent character that gave it a special place in the development of the romance. The fragmentary Coptic (Sahidic) version was taken from a book in the White Monastery (DAYR ANBA SHINUDAH) of Apa Shenute the Great near Suhaj in Upper Egypt. Originally the 220-page manuscript consisted of about thirty-seven chapters. In all probability, each chapter had for its motto a verse from the Bible. The surviving recensions deal with Alexander among the Elamites, his rescue from the abyss (chaos) by Antilochos (Eurylochos in Gedrosia), how the disguised Alexander discovers the fidelity of the Macedonians and the disloyalty of the Persian King Agrikolaos, the legacy of the true Selpharios, Alexander's sojourn near the four streams of Paradise on the borders of the land of darkness, Alexander with the Brahmans, and finally Alexander's murder by poisoning. The last fragment closely resembles the text of PseudoCallisthenes. The style of these Coptic versions of the Alexander Romance duplicates the literature of edification written by the monks. The narratives extend the stories of the martyrs and also of the apocalypses. Those who treat some Coptic literature as being\n\n\"profane\" err; Coptic literature is Christian. As a tool of God, Alexander could be considered a prophet; as a martyr, he foreshadowed Christ. The Cambyses Romance Of the Cambyses Romance there remains only a fragmentary version of six parchment leaves in poor condition at the Staatliches Museum in Berlin (P9009; probably eighth or ninth century). The text is written in Sahidic Coptic, and undoubtedly formed part of a larger manuscript of unknown origin. The romance deals with the Persian King Cambyses II (reigned 529-522 B.C.). The epistle of Cambyses to the \"Inhabitants of the East\" attempts to incite them against Egypt and the pharaoh without success. Helped by the wise Bothros, the addressees stand firmly by Egypt, the pharaoh, and the holy bull Apis, god of Memphis. In their replies to his writings, the Egyptians express their animosity toward Cambyses and their loyalty to the safe stronghold of their country. At this point, the name of Cambyses changes to the Assyrian Nebuchadnezzar II (604-562 B.C.). One of the seven wise men of Nebuchadnezzar proposes that false messengers be sent to the Egyptians to assemble them for a feast—in the name of the pharoah and in the name of their god Apis. However, the Egyptians are not to be deceived. Soothsayers reveal the plan, and under the guise of accepting the invitation, the Egyptians assemble a strong army for the pharaoh Apries (588-568 B.C.). Here the text ends, but undoubtedly an Egyptian victory occurred, in spite of recorded history about the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses II. The incomplete state of the manuscript makes it very difficult to judge the character of this romance. It can be compared to the World Chronicle of Bishop JOHN OF NIKIOU (C. A.D. 700). But, of course, this cannot be considered a source for the romance, although both works include the prophet Jeremiah. Otherwise, the Cambyses Romance echoes the reports of the Persian invasion of Egypt. The unusual geography, in which Egypt is presented as a land of the East, can be explained from the viewpoint of the Libyan oases and its robbers infiltrating into Egypt.\n\nWe cannot know for sure the extent of the work, nor the purpose of the author. We do know that the Cambyses Romance as it survived was revised by Christian Egyptians, and this would explain the name change from Cambyses to Nebuchadnezzar. The Coptic author seems to have been a monk of Upper Egypt who probably revised an older original for his own purposes. Biblical and Greek authors (including Herodotus) are the sources for the text. The form follows other examples of Coptic rhetoric. The fragments consist mainly of speeches and epistles. The romance was probably composed before the fifth or sixth century, or perhaps even as late as the eighth or ninth century, in response to the pressure of an Arabian invader. Jansen's hypothesis that an Aramaic-speaking Jew participated in the revision of the story (1950, p. 33) is also possible. Without doubt, this Coptic romance connected the Bible— ending with the flight of the Holy Family to Egypt—to the history of Egypt for the monastic community.

Although Alexandria never became a \"Second Rome,\" the existence and, in some sense, the presence of the Roman emperor was a common and permanent experience for the inhabitants of Egypt. The head of the provincial administration, the prefect of Egypt, was the direct representative of the emperor. The importance and power of the distant imperial overlord were constantly felt in everyday life. Documents from Augustus to DIOCLETIAN were dated by the regnal years of the emperor, often recalling his name and his victory titles. Annual official ceremonies commemorated the accession of the emperor and his anniversary. In their oaths, the subjects invoked the name and the fortune of the emperor, and they sacrificed to his divinity while performing the ruler-cult or to demonstrate that they were not Christians. Even the appearance of those emperors who never paid a visit to Egypt was well known to the inhabitants of the Nile Valley. The emperor's portrait figured on the coins they handled and his statues were omnipresent in official buildings, military camps, and temples (Kiss, 1984; Vogt, 1924). Well into the Roman period, the emperors were still represented on the walls of Egyptian-style sanctuaries in the traditional pharaonic attire (on the nomenclature of emperors in "
