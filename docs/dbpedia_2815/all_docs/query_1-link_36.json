Bothmer1 was the North American among the four most influential historians of ancient Egyptian art, alongside Cyril Aldred (1914–1991) in Great Britain, Hans Wolfgang Müller (1907–1991) in Germany, and Jacques Vandier (1904–1973) in France. Born on 13. X. 1912 in Charlottenburg, a suburb of Berlin, and named Bernhard Wilhelm von Bothmer, he began his career in Egyptology as a departmental assistant in the Egyptian Department of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin while still a student. A staunch opponent of Hitler’s Nazi party, he left Germany in late summer 1939 before completing his doctoral dissertation. After success finally met more than two years spent in Switzerland, attempting to acquire a visa for the U.S.A. and the transit visas essential to make the journey through Vichy France, Franco’s Spain, Portugal, and Bermuda, he arrived in America in October 1941. Bothmer became an American citizen in 1944 and upon discharge from the US Army in 1946, he could resume his career in Egyptology following a six-year hiatus when he accepted the offer of a position in the Egyptian Department of Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts. In 1954 he took a leave of absence from the museum to become head in the Cairo office of the recently established American Research Center in Egypt of which he was a founding member.2 Following his two-year stint in Egypt, when he was also a Fulbright scholar researching Late Period sculpture, he joined the staff of the Brooklyn Museum in 1956 as associate curator. Eventually, in 1977, he became chairman of the Department of Egyptian, Classical, and Ancient Middle Eastern Art. In Brooklyn, Bothmer was responsible for planning and mounting the groundbreaking international loan exhibition Egyptian Sculpture of the Late Period (1960) which was instrumental in bringing the long-neglected art of the final phase of ancient Egyptian culture to center stage. Akhenaten and Nefertiti – the first major exhibition on the art of the Amarna Period when the “heretic king” Akhenaten occupied the throne of Egypt – followed in 1973. And Bothmer’s role was decisive in staging Africa in Antiquity (1978), the exhibition focusing on the pharaonic-influenced art produced above the First Nile Cataract.3 In 1982, after 1\n\nAs in the title of this book, not Bernhard von Bothmer as he was known for nearly the entire period covered by the text. When he became an American citizen in 1944 – see Chapter 6, P. 119 – Bothmer adopted the English spelling of his first name and replaced “von” with “V.”. 2 Cf. http://arce.org/sterling-dow (accessed 10. V. 2018). 3 The catalogue of the Late Period show – Egyptian Sculpture of the Late Period 700 B.C. to A.D. 100, Brooklyn 1960 – was authored by Bothmer in cooperation with Herman De Meulenaere and Hans Wolfgang Müller, but he did not contribute to the catalogues of © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n8\n\nPreface\n\nhis retirement from the museum, he became the first Lila Acheson Wallace Professor of Egyptian Art at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, where he had long been an adjunct professor. Bothmer was a charismatic teacher who continued to introduce many aspiring art-history students to ancient Egyptian art until his death in November 1993.4 As I have explained elsewhere,5 my interest in Bothmer’s earlier career was aroused by conversations with the late Werner Kaiser (1926–2013), director of the Egyptian Museum in West Berlin from 1962 until 1967, and then of the Cairo branch of the German Archaeological Institute, 1967–1989. The deadline for submitting a contribution to the memorial volume honoring Prof. Kaiser and the restriction on length necessitated omission of some details of Bothmer’s earlier career then known to me. In the meantime, new sources of information and considerable archival research in the U.S.A., as well as in Germany and Italy, have resulted in providing not only the answers to some questions left open in the article but also additional insights into various aspects of the story. It is a pleasure for me, in addition to an obligation, to acknowledge here the multiple kinds of assistance provided me by many persons while I was preparing this study. Heading up the list are Bothmer’s widow Norma Jean, in New York City, and Max Kricke, Freiburg in Breisgau, Germany. Mrs. Bothmer gave me unlimited access to those papers of her late husband still in her possession, including documents and photographs illustrated here (Figures 1–4, 12–18, and Color plate 3a–b), the “Emigration file” of material relating to his enforced sojourn in Switzerland (1939–1941), and his Pocket diaries. And she also provided the manuscript which Bothmer began composing immediately after his arrival in the U.S.A. in October 1941, included as an appendix. It was Jasper Griffin, curator of Greek and Roman Art at the Michael C. Carlos Museum, Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and the person to whom Bothmer’s brother Dietrich von Bothmer entrusted his Nachlass, who first mentioned to me the existence of correspondence received by their maternal grandmother Elisabeth von und zu Egloffstein née von Rotenhahn. As I subsequently learned, this consisted primarily of letters sent to her by her daughter Marie von Bothmer, mother of the Bothmer brothers. Of interest for this biography are also fifteen letters and twenty-three postcards Bernhard sent to his grandparents and one letter either the Amarna or the Africa in Antiquity exhibitions. However, the authors of both volumes gratefully acknowledged his role in conceiving and mounting the exhibitions, aided by the professional staff he had assembled in Brooklyn – see Cyril Aldred, Akhenaten and Nefertiti, Brooklyn 1973, p. 9, and Steffen Wenig, Africa in Antiquity. The Arts of Ancient Nubia and the Sudan, Brooklyn 1978, v. II, p. 11. 4 See Rita E. Freed, ‘Introduction: Bernard V. Bothmer and Egyptian Art History’, in Egyptian Art, p. xxii, and cf. Paul Edmund Stanwick [untitled contribution], in In Memoriam, pp. 23–27. 5 Eaton-Krauss, ‘biographical essay’. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nPreface\n\n9\n\nwritten by his father Wilhelm to his grandmother. Thanks to Jasper, I could contact Dietrich’s son Bernard von Bothmer in San Francisco, California to whom I am greatly indebted for putting me in touch with Max Kricke (who had acquired the correspondence) and graciously authorizing him to help me however possible. Since mid-March 2015 Max and I have been in frequent email and telephone contact, and we have also met and exchanged information in Freiburg, Berlin, Heidelberg, and Stuttgart. I am immensely grateful to Max for his generosity in providing me with his transcriptions of Marie’s letters mentioning Bothmer, and excerpts from others, which spared me deciphering her handwriting. It goes without saying that many significant factors influencing Bothmer’s youth and his career down through his immigration would have remained a “closed book” without the material contained in the family correspondence.6 References below to specific letters written by Marie to her mother are cited in the text and footnotes as MvB plus the date (day. month. year) enclosed in brackets – e.g., [MvB 2. X. 1935] refers to Marie’s letter to her mother dated October 2nd 1935. References to the cards and letters Bernhard sent to his grandparents are cited similarly – [BvB day. month. year] – as is the letter of Wilhelm von Bothmer to his mother-in-law (P. 22). Max also shared with me much additional information about the circumstances of Marie and her children in Berlin and about other members of the family, and he made several pertinent observations which are credited to him below. Those to whom I owe thanks are many, both individuals and institutions in the U.S.A. and Europe. I have made every effort to include them all and apologize for any inadvertently overlooked in the footnotes or the long list that follows here: •\n\n• •\n\n•\n\nStefan George Stiftung for permission to cite numerous unpublished sources held at the Stefan George Archive, Württembergische Landesbibliothek, Stuttgart, and to illustrate in this study the first of the three letters Bothmer sent to the poet; Ute Oelmann, director of the Stefan George Archive, when in 2013 I made initial inquiries about Bothmer; Maik Bozza, Oelmann’s successor at the Stefan George Archive, for his help not only on the occasion of my repeated visits to Stuttgart, but also via email and by telephone, and for his kindnesses over and above his official duties; Betsy M.

In Basel, Alexander Zschokke’s daughter Petra welcomed me to her home a second time, in July 2017, providing access to her father’s atelier where I found the sketches of Morwitz and George illustrating this book. I wish to express my sincere appreciation for her permission to do so and not least, for her hospitality on the occasion of both my visits to Basel. Last but surely not least, I am very grateful to the editors of Investigatio Orientis for accepting the biography for publication in their series at the suggestion of one of their number, Thomas L. Gertzen, and to Kai Metzler, Zaphon, for his patience, as well as, above all, his professional attention to detail. Technical notes Unless otherwise specified, all English translations of German in the text are my own. Names in German of organizations (political parties, associations, etc.) are rendered in English followed by the German name in parentheses. Individual German words, phrases, and shorter text passages in letters and documents (in parentheses) follow English translations; longer passages in German, translated into English in the text, are provided in the notes. Passages and words within {…} are additions in the original. The bibliography of published sources gives the abbreviated form employed for citations of those books and articles which are mentioned more than once in the notes. All other published sources are given in full when cited. Unpublished, archival sources are acknowledged in square brackets […] both in the text and in the notes. For various episodes of German history in those years covered by this study, I have endeavored whenever possible to supplement sources in German with readily available English-language publications (insofar as they are not completely outdated or incorrect), with a view to reaching those readers lacking a reading knowledge of German.\n\nMarianne Eaton-Krauss, Berlin, August 2018\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nChapter 1 – From childhood through secondary schooling\n\nBernhard Wilhelm von Bothmer was born to the nobility. The parents of both his mother Marie von und zu Egloffstein (1887–1960) and his father Wilhelm Friedrich Franz von Bothmer (1869–1922; Figure 1) came from old, well established noble houses – so-called Uradel.7 The ancestral homes of his maternal grandparents were located in Franconia – the Egloffsteins in Kunreuth and the Rotenhahns in Rentweinsdorf. His father belonged to the Landesbergen (Lower Saxonian) branch of the Bothmer family, Lutheran by confession.8 Bernhard, the first child of Marie’s marriage to Wilhelm, eighteen years her senior, was born on 13. X. 1912 in Charlottenburg, a town on the western outskirts of Berlin which would be incorporated into the German capital eight years later. Bernhard’s parents continued to maintain their home in Charlottenburg where his oldest sister Luise (“Is[’]chen”9) Henriette (1914–2008) was born (Figure 2), followed two years later by Marie/Maria Artemise (1916–1936).10 Towards the end of World War I, Marie moved with the three children to her parents’ home in Eisenach, Thuringia. Bernhard’s brother Dietrich Felix (1918–2009; Figure 3) was born there, as was the last sibling, Auguste Victoria (“Tora”; 1921–1975). Wilhelm von Bothmer rose to the rank of colonel in the 176th infantry regiment of the German army.11 His brother-in-law Julius Gottfried von und zu Egloffstein 7 Cf. Ernst Morwitz’s description of the Bothmer brothers [Letter book, p. 180 l.]: ‘… of the best German nobility on both [their mother’s and their father’s] sides’ (… von beiden Seiten aus bestem deutschen Adel). 8 For the Bothmer family, cf. v. II, pp. 33–34 in Adelslexikon, Walter von Eueck, ed., Limburg an der Lahn 1974/75; for the Egloffsteins v. III, pp. 94–95; and v. XII, pp. 51– 52 for the Rotenhahns. I am indebted to Max Kricke for sorting out the complex familial relationships for me. 9 So in the letters of her mother, not “Isi”, pace Alfred Grimm, in Handbuch v. 3, pp. 1304, 1307. 10 Neither brother included her among their siblings in the forms they completed in 1979 for the Research Foundation for Jewish Immigration (accessed on microfilm 4. II. 2014; Zentrum für Antisemitismusforschung, Technische Universität Berlin), which accounts for her absence from Grimm’s entries on them both, in Handbuch v. 3, pp. 1304 and 1307, respectively, as well as from Int’l. Bio. Dictonary v. 2: 1, pp. 136–37. The existence of a fifth sibling is mentioned by Bothmer himself in the memories he recorded in the summer of 1993 [StG/cassette], while in Dietrich von Bothmer’s address at the memorial service for his brother, In Memoriam, p. 12, he commented that there were five children in the family. 11 This was his rank, according to Dietrich von Bothmer [letter dated 29.

At that time, the Pädagogium was a private Lutheran boarding school, affiliated with the Otto Kühne Schule, Bad Godesberg. After a brief and enervating stint – the tasks that confronted Marie and Wilhelm, described by Bernhard in one of the first letters he sent to his grandparents that has survived [BvB 1. XII. 1920], did not conform to the job description [cf. also MvB 2. XII. 1920] – the couple made plans to return to Charlottenburg, in the meantime no longer a suburb but a district of Berlin. The move took place on 22. I. 1922, without, however, the three younger children who stayed on in Eisenach at first [MvB 22. I. 1922]. The new domicile was an apartment in Achenbachstraße14 which remained the family home until the spring of 1932 when Marie, then a widow, moved to Holsteinische Straße 33, another address in the Charlottenburg district [cf. MvB 14. II. 1932]. When Wilhelm was demobilized, the economic future was not auspicious, neither for his family nor for the country in general. Decades later, Bothmer described his family as impoverished nobility, noting that his mother’s inheritance had been in government bonds which were worthless after the war [StGA/cassette]. The immediate cause of his father’s death was a serious bout of dysentery, but according to the official report of Berlin’s Westend Hospital where he passed away on 12. II. 1922, his weakened heart was ultimately responsible [MvB 6. VI. 1922]. Thereafter solvency seems to have depended primarily on three sources, apart from the modest pension Marie received as Wilhelm’s widow: (1) the income from a series of boarders who occupied rooms in the family apartment; (2) financial aid provided by various organizations, such as the Association of German Army Officers (Deutscher Offiziersbund – DOB), the Association of German Officers’ Wives (Bund deutscher Offiziersfrauen – BDOF), and the Cooperative Association of German Nobles (Deutsche Adelsgenossenschaft – DAG); and (3) assistance from relatives – above all, Marie’s parents in Eisenach. From the Bothmer side of the family it was Ivo Conrad Ulrich von Bothmer, proprietor of a manor (Rittergut) in Falkenberg15 where he lived with his wife and mother,16 to whom Marie was indebted from time to time for victuals. She often sought advice from them, as well as from her brother Julius in Potsdam, a garrison city immedi-\n\n13\n\nNowadays the Bodelschwingh Gymnasium. Since renamed Heilbronner Straße. 15 In the aftermath of World War II, this village in West Pomerania became part of Poland and was renamed Jastrzębniki. It is located about 150 km northeast of Berlin. 16 In the correspondence she is usually referred to as Aunt Lena but once as a cousin [MvB 18. IV. 1926] while Morwitz [Letter book, p. 172 rt.], calls Ivo Bernhard’s uncle. Such kinship terms had a wide application and are not to be taken literally; Ivo was neither the brother of Bernhard’s mother nor of his father but actually a member of a collateral branch of the large, extended Bothmer family. 14\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nFrom childhood through secondary schooling\n\n17\n\nately southwest of Berlin.17 While Bernhard was growing up, he frequently spent time with Ivo’s family in Falkenberg.18 By the autumn of 1929, he had come to realize that the serious economic problems experienced in the German capital had also begun to have a negative effect on life at the manor.19 The political sympathies of Marie von Bothmer, revealed in the letters she wrote to her parents, are unsurprising. As the daughter, sister, and widow of military men and belonging to the so-called Kleinadel – less affluent, city-dwelling nobility, she was characteristically pro-monarchist. There was a portrait of Emperor Wilhelm II, who had abdicated in November 1918, in the Bothmer apartment [MvB 27. I. 1929]. Marie regularly posted birthday greetings to him in Doorn, Holland, his home in exile, and she was pleased to receive acknowledgment of their receipt from “Empress” Hermine [e.g., MvB 7. III. 1926] whom Wilhelm II had married after the death in 1921 of his first wife Auguste Victoria.20 In line with the policies of the German National People’s Party (Deutschnationale Volkspartei – DNVP) of which Marie was a member, she favored the referendum which proposed dissolving the Prussian parliament – characteristically, Bernhard did not agree with her [MvB 26. IV. 1931]. (A petition of the Stahlhelm, the paramilitary arm of the DNVP, was responsible for instigating this referendum; Bernhard’s negative attitude towards the Stahlhelm [MvB 8. V. 1927] was in line with his opposition to all such organizations.) The voting, when it finally took place on 9. VIII. 1931, proved unsuccessful.21 In general Marie’s political outlook was conservative, but not as rightist as, for example, the overtly anti-Semitic German völkisch22 Freedom Party (Deutschvölkische Freiheitspartei). The very few negative remarks about Jews in Marie’s correspondence reflect prejudices and stereotypes widely held in contemporaneous Germany. Moreover, they were typical of the nobility and of the families of military professionals like her\n\n17\n\nWhere, beginning in 1871, the King of Prussia – and later the German emperor – resided. The last mention of him visiting Falkenberg in his mother’s correspondence is dated 19. IV. 1938. 19 As described in a letter (dated 5. X. 1929 [StGA]), which he sent from Falkenberg to Alexander Zschokke. 20 Very probably Bernhard’s youngest sister was named after her. 21 See especially pp. 489–91 in Wilhelm Ribhegge, Preußen im Westen. Kampf um den Parlamentarismus in Rheinland und Westfalen 1789–1947, Münster 2008. Although supported not only by rightist parties, but also by the communists, the referendum failed because only 37% of eligible voters went to the polls, instead of the required 50%. 22 The German term völkisch harbors a host of implications. Völkisch political programs and parties expressed and instrumentalized populist sentiments; they were nationalistic and, typically, often racist to varying degrees. There is no single English word that adequately conveys the sense of the German term. 18\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n18\n\nChapter 1\n\nhusband, father, and brother.23 The limited contact which the public at large24 had with Jews was primarily professional and “at arm’s length”.25 Distrust of Jews went hand in hand with abhorrence of communism and devotion to the Fatherland. Marie’s negative comments were occasioned by difficulties she experienced, beginning around Christmas time 1927, with her landlord in which a certain Herr Himmelweit, a representative of the firm managing the property, played a significant role. Both Himmelweit and the owner of the building in which the family had their apartment in Achenbachstraße were Jewish. Marie believed the attempt to forbid her to have boarders (an important source of her income) was motivated by a plan to force her out and replace her family with wealthy Jews [MvB 30. XII. 1927]. Marie continued to have problems with Himmelweit until towards the end of 1931 when she decided to move to a smaller apartment.26 (Her decision was not, however, influenced primarily by the conflict with Himmelweit but rather resulted from financial constraints in general.27) The candidate whom Marie von Bothmer favored in the election of 1925 for the first directly elected German president was Karl Jarres of the DNVP [MvB 25. III. 1925]. He garnered the most votes in the first round of voting which took place on 29. III. 1925, but they were not enough for him to win outright. His withdrawal from the second round enabled the victory of Paul von Hindenburg (1847–1934), the revered general and chief-of-staff of German troops in the First World War, whose independent candidacy was backed by the DNVP and the equally conservative, monarchist German People’s Party (Deutsche Volkspartei) and the Bavarian People’s Party (Bayerische Volkspartei).28 With her four oldest children, Marie stood in the section reserved for the DAG at Reichskanzlerplatz (nowadays Theodor-Heuss-Platz) to witness the entry of Hindenburg to Berlin, the day before the official swearing-in ceremony [MvB 12. V. 1925]. In addition to documenting Marie’s own financial worries, her letters to her mother show her sensitivity to the dire economic situation of the country at large [e.g., MvB 24. VIII. 1925] and the unemployed forced by circumstances to resort to begging. In her letter to her mother dated 15. I. 1926, she wrote that frequently well-dressed beggars came to her door 23\n\nSee, for example, Stephan Malinowski, Vom König zum Führer. Deutscher Adel und Nationalsozialismus, 3rd ed., Berlin 2003, pp. 104–17 (prejudices of protestant nobility with modest means and strong ties to the military) and pp. 477–88 (anti-Semitism among the nobility in general). 24 By contrast to those in the circle around the poet Stefan George. The Jewish members of the Circle and their changing roles in it are the subject of essays in “Verkannte Brüder”. 25 Groppe, Macht der Bildung, p. 652. 26 His name occurs for the last time in a letter dated 18. XI. 1931. 27 I am grateful to Max Kricke for advising me that this is obvious from other letters she sent to her mother. 28 An accessible source of information about this election for those who do not read German is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_presidential_election_1925. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nFrom childhood through secondary schooling\n\n19\n\n… in droves. But it is no wonder when one reads about the really alarmingly increasing numbers of unemployed! The deep misery in which we are mired becomes ever more frighteningly clear, especially now when such important anniversaries near.29 Marie refers here to the celebrations commemorating the occasion when Wilhelm, King of Prussia, became Emperor Wilhelm I of a united Germany in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles on 18. I. 1871. In the same letter Marie mentions her intention to attend events planned in that connection, sponsored by the DOB and the Preußenbund,30 another conservative organization with ties to the DNVP. Later that same year she remarked [MvB 10. IX. 1926]: ‘Men are in dire straits – no one makes demands so long as he has work’.31 In late spring 1928 Marie feared that the gains of the Socialist Party of Germany (Sozialistische Partei Deutschlands – SPD) and the communists in the recent election of 20. V. 1928, coupled with notable losses for the DNVP, would result in even harder times [MvB 28. V. 1928]. The following winter, in February 1929, she observed [MvB 10. II. 1929] that ‘… a definitely “better man”’ (… ein entschieden “besserer”Mann) had come begging for a warm meal, adding that the extremely low temperatures32 made times worse, especially for the many poor and homeless. Marie was a member of the Confessing Church33 (Bekennende Kirche) which came into being when German Lutherans split into pro- and anti-Hitler factions after the assumption of authority by the Nazi Party, the National Socialist German Workers Party (Nationalsozialistische deutsche Arbeiterpartei – NSDAP) in 1933.34 The Confessing Church denied the NSDAP the right to interfere in church affairs. Martin Niemöller (1892–1984) and the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer (1906–1945) are the figures associated with this movement who are best known 29 Sie [beggars] kommen jetzt in Scharen, oft ganz fein angezogen. Es ist ja aber auch kein Wunder, wenn man die geradezu erschreckend anwachsenden Zahlen der Arbeitslosen liest! Das tiefe Elend, in dem wir stehen, wird einem immer wieder, jetzt vor allem, wo so große Erinnerungstage sich wieder jähren, erschreckend klar. 30 Also known as the Association of Those Loyal to the Emperor (Bund der Kaisertreuen). 31 Bei den Männern ist Not – da stellt keiner Bedingungen, wenn er Arbeit hat. 32 The winter of 1928/1929 was said to be the coldest for a century. 33 The translation Confessional Church is also sometimes used. I follow here the lead of Matthew D. Hockenos, A Church Divided. German Protestants Confront the Nazi Past, Bloomington and Indianapolis, Indiana 2004. The introduction and first chapter of Hockenos’s study review the conflicts which divided Protestants and led to the founding of the Confessing Church in 1934. 34 Limited opposition to Nationalsocialism was still possible 1934–1935, but it soon became a crime against the state, and by 1939 a treasonal offence; cf. Anders Jarlet, ‘Das Problem des Widerstandes in den evangelischen Kirchen Europas 1933–1945’, in Glaube – Freiheit – Diktatur in Europa und den USA, FS Gerhard Besier, Katarzyna Stocłosa and Andrea Strübind, eds, Göttingen 2007, esp. p. 47.\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n20\n\nChapter 1\n\noutside Germany. At first, the Confessing Church actively attempted to protect only those Jews who had converted to Christianity, but eventually some signers of the document establishing the movement in 1934 became highly vocal opponents of Nazi policies and denounced the persecution of all Jews. Many of these protesters ended up in a concentration camp or prison. Marie regularly worshipped at the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche at Auguste-Viktoria-Platz (since 1947, Breitscheidplatz) in Charlottenburg where Gerhard Jacobi (1891–1971)35 was pastor. He played a leading role in the Confessing Church in Berlin-Brandenburg until 1939, when he was called up to serve in the army. Jacobi was himself in some danger since, according to the laws discriminating against Jews passed by the Nazis, he was a not an “Arian” but a so-called jüdischer Mischling zweiten Grades. Marie was not only a member of Jacobi’s congregation but also acquainted with Anni von Gottberg (1885–1958), the only woman who played a decisive role in establishing the Confessing Church.36 And in March 1942, Marie attended ‘… a fine Confessing Church meeting with a very good lecture by Pastor Dr. Böhm’ (… eine schöne Bekennendenversammlung mit einem sehr guten Vortrag von Pfarrer Dr. Böhm) [MvB 11. III. 1942]. Dr. Hans Böhm (1899–1962) had been arrested earlier, in June of 1936; in October 1944 he was again incarcerated, in the same prison as Bonhoeffer, but unlike the theologian, he survived the war.37 Marie’s membership in the Confessing Church put her at risk.38 Back in the spring of 1922, shortly after his father’s death, Bernhard became eligible for participation in a program established to send undernourished German children to Switzerland.39 Thanks to assistance provided by DOB, he was one of 35 For Jacobi’s biography, see Hartmut Ludwig and Eberhard Röhm, Evangelisch getauft – als “Juden” verfolgt, Stuttgart 2013, pp. 166–67. – Max Kricke called my attention to Marie’s membership in the congregation of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gedächtniskirche, for which I am again grateful to him. The church was seriously damaged in a bombing raid in November 1943. The ruin of the church spire, supplemented by a modern belfry and a chapel (both added 1959–1963), became a trade-mark of West Berlin. 36 The website www.anni-von-gottberg.de, supported by the Agency for Political Education, Brandenburg, is devoted to her. Max Kricke tells me that a letter from her to Marie dated 13. III. 1957 documents that contact between the two women continued well after the end of the Second World War. 37 Böhm was involved in the ecumenical activities of the Confessing Church from 1936 until it ceased to exist after World War II. His relationship to Bonhoeffer was close; cf. the numerous references to Böhm in Eberhard Bethge, Dietrich Bonhoeffer. Theologe – Christ – Zeitgenosse. Eine Biographie, 7th revised ed., Gütersloh 2001, esp. pp. 541, 604, 774, and 1016; cf. also the website of the International Bonhoeffer Gesellschaft www.dietrich-bonhoeffer/bonhoeffer-umwelt/hans-boehm/. 38 As Bothmer was well aware [StGA/cassette]; see also further below, Chapter 6, P. 116. 39 For the initial phase of this program in the aftermath of World War I, see Bernd Haunfelder, Schweizer Hilfe für Deutschland. Aufrufe, Berichte, Briefe, Erinnnerungen,\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nFrom childhood through secondary schooling\n\n21\n\nthe boys from Berlin sent with more than 300 other children to a children’s home in Rünenberg, in the canton Basel Land. He departed Berlin by train on 17. V. 1922, returning on 13. VII., sun-tanned and much stronger than when he left [MvB 13., 17., 25. V; 1. VI; 21. VII. 1922].40 This stay of slightly less than two months’ duration was Bernhard’s initial experience of Switzerland, a country that he would visit many times on hiking and skiing vacations before finding himself stranded there for a bit more than two years, 1939–1941. Decades later [StGA/cassette], Bothmer attributed to these sojourns his ability to converse accent-free in the dialect of the German-speaking Swiss, enabling him to “pass” as a native speaker during the lengthy period he was forced to spend in the country prior to his emigration. At the end of 1923 the central aid office (Zentralhilfe) of the DAG concerned with financial aid for nobles in need advised Marie by letter that Dr. Maximilian Krieger, the tutor of Ernst Aschwin, son of Prince Bernhard zur Lippe (1872– 1934), was looking for a boy to be a playmate for his charge and a fellow pupil at the family residence Schloss Woynowo at Züllichau (nowadays Sulechów, in Poland). Might Bernhard be suitable? After discussing the proposal with her brother Julius, Marie arranged to meet Dr. Krieger and that he make Bernhard’s acquaintance. Then she asked her parents for advice [MvB 29. XII. 1923],41 listing the financial advantages but also her concerns. These were twofold: (1) Bernhard would be removed from his accustomed environment – from the family where he provided support, both physical and emotional, for her and his siblings, and from the Fichte Gymnasium (see infra) where he had made such progress; (2) since Bernhard was two years older than the prince’s son, he might well become even more dictatorial than he already was at home in his relationship with his brother and sisters. Before Dr. Krieger’s return to Züllichau he took Bernhard, ‘… whom he found very much to his liking’ (… hat großes Gefallen an ihm), to visit museums and other sites in Berlin almost daily while Marie deliberated [MvB 6. I. 1924]. Scarcely a month later, she had completed negotiations with the family of the prince, but put off telling Bernhard about the plans, since she wanted to postpone\n\nReden. 1917–1933 und 1944–1957, Münster 2010, pp. 19–67. 40 The sojourn of Bernhard’s little brother in Norway, from February until September 1924, was substantially different. When Dietrich was diagnosed as suffering from scrofula (a tubercular infection of lymph nodes in the neck) [MvB 4. II. 1924], the DAG arranged for him to spend several months (11. II. until 7. IX. 1924) not in a children’s home, but with the family of Karl Gulbrandsen, a bookbinder, in Kristiania, as the Norwegian capital Oslo was known from 1877 until 1925. Max Kricke tells me that when the Gulbrandsens’ first child was born during Dietrich’s stay, he spent time with Karl’s father. Brief mentions in Marie’s letters to her mother document that contact was maintained between the families for years after Dietrich’s return to Germany. 41 Marie included the letter from the Zentralhilfe with her letter to her mother. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n22\n\nChapter 1\n\nthe separation for a time [MvB 6. II. 1924]. Apparently in March the arrangements had gone so far as to withdraw Bernhard officially from the Fichte Gymnasium.42 But then a letter arrived from the wife of Prince Bernhard zur Lippe, expressing her regret for the inconvenience caused Marie by her cancellation of the contractual agreement; it had proved impossible for the princess not to dismiss Dr. Krieger, about whom she had been very mistaken, when she learned of his ‘… moral transgressions towards friends of her sons’ (… Verfehlungen sittlicher Art gegen Kameraden ihrer Söhne) [MvB 11. V. 1924, clarifying the rather cryptic remarks of the princess reported in her earlier letter of 30. IV. 1924 to her mother]. In retrospect, Marie was very thankful that nothing had come of it. A sequel to this story was played out in early 1927 when a special delivery letter for Bernhard arrived from Dr. Krieger who was in Morocco as a journalist. In it were stamps for Bernhard’s stamp collection and a photo of the sender who asked for one of Bernhard in exchange. Marie, who took this opportunity to speak plainly to Bernhard, realized that he was already aware of the existence of inappropriate contact between men and boys; furthermore, he was not at all surprised about Dr. Krieger – he must have known back then ‘… that there was something disturbing about him’ (… daß er etwas Unheimliches an sich hat). Although Bernhard would reply to Dr. Krieger’s letter, no photo would be included with his response [MvB 23. I. 1927].43 Six years earlier, in 1921, when a move back to Berlin was being planned, an important item on the agenda was deciding on a school for Bernhard’s secondary education. Should it be a Gymnasium with traditional focus on Latin and the humanities or a Realgymnasium where modern languages and the natural sciences were given precedence? After investigating the alternatives in the time leading up to the move, Bernhard’s father Wilhelm, already in Berlin, wrote to his motherin-law for advice [WvB 25. XI. 1921]. The choice would be between the Mommsen Gymnasium44 and the Fichte Gymnasium.45 Both were said to have good faculties but the latter at Emser Straße 50–52 was about 20 minutes further away from the apartment the family would occupy. Regardless of the advice Elisabeth von und zu Egloffstein may have given her son-in-law, the decision fell in favor of the Fichte Gymnasium (Figure 4), a choice 42\n\nSince he had to be re-matriculated when he returned from spending the spring school vacation with his relatives in Falkenberg [MvB 30. IV. 1924]. 43 Marie told her mother: ‘In this regard, Silvio [Markees] is also a good support and protection for Bernhard, for he, too, warned Bernhard about such dangers which indeed lurk everywhere’ (Silvio ist Bernhard auch darin eine gute Stütze und Abwehr indem er Bernhard ebenfalls warnt vor solchen Gefahren, die eben überall lauern). For Silvio Markees, see further immediately below. 44 In 2008 renamed to honor Heinz Berggruen (1914–2007), the collector and patron of art. 45 Today the building houses the Johann Peter Hebel Elementary School. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nFrom childhood through secondary schooling\n\n23\n\nwith significant consequences. At the Fichte Gymnasium Silvio Markees (1908– 1991) befriended Bernhard46 whom he introduced to Ernst Morwitz, his mentor. And it was through Morwitz that Bernhard became acquainted not only with Morwitz’s friend the painter Erich Heckel,47 a founding member of the group of German painters known collectively as Die Brücke, but also with members of the circle around Stefan George, and, ultimately, with the poet himself. (This side of Bernhard’s life and those who played a role in it – especially Morwitz – are considered in the following chapter.)\n\nFigure 4: The Fichte Gymnasium. 1920s.\n\n46 According to Morwitz [Letter book, p. 98 l.] this was after Silvio’s unsuccessful attempt to initiate a friendship with a different boy at the Fichte Gymnasium. – Klaus Bremme was another of Bernhard’s friends at school. He is mentioned frequently, simply as Bremme, between 24. VIII. 1925 and 14. X. 1926 in Marie’s letters to her mother. She invited him together with Silvio Markees for tea on 14. X. 1926 to celebrate Bernhard’s 14th birthday. Bremme’s role in Bernhard’s life was clearly not comparable to Silvio’s. The only mention of him after 1926 I have found occurs in a postcard which Bothmer sent to Wilhelm Stein (for whom see N. 107 and Chapters 4 and 5, passim) dated 15. IX. 1939 [StGA]: Bremme, whom Bothmer characterized as a former school chum, had asked Silvio if he knew how to get in touch with Bernhard, and Silvio had given Bremme Stein’s address in Bern. Bothmer asked Stein, should Bremme get in touch, not to divulge his whereabouts but to find out instead how Bothmer might contact him. 47 For Heckel, see Chapter 2, P. 31 N. 71, and Chapters 4–6, passim.\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n24\n\nChapter 1\n\nSilvio Markees,48 born on 21. II. 1908 and so 3 ½ years older than Bernhard, was a Swiss national, thanks to his father Carl (1865–1926) who came from Chur. His German mother Gabriele belonged to the von Stettin family, nobility from Württemberg. Carl Markees came to Berlin as a music student in 1881. At the State Music School he studied violin for a time with Joseph Joachim (1831–1907), the famous virtuoso and friend of Johannes Brahms; in 1889 he was awarded a Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy stipendium. After a brief orchestral career, Carl Markees joined the faculty of his alma mater to follow the calling of a teacher.49 Bernard’s acquaintance with Silvio dated at the latest from November 192450 when Marie mentioned him for the first time in a letter to her mother [MvB 30. XI. 1924], expressing the opinion that he would be ‘good company’ (ein guter Umgang) for her older son. She noted that, like Bernhard, Silvio collected stamps, enjoyed swimming, and went ice skating, a pastime at which he was a master. It was this last accomplishment which had led three years earlier, in the winter of 1921/22, to Silvio’s getting to know Ernst Morwitz51 who considered Silvio the ‘most gifted’ (meistbegabt) of his young friends [Letter book, p. 172 rt.]. The Fichte Gymnasium was better in respect to the student body and to the teaching in general (and of religion, in particular) than the school he had attended in Eisenach [MvB 22. I. 1922] but it was ‘very strict’ (sehr streng [MvB 21. XI. 1924]). Bernhard at first lagged behind his classmates. Marie much appreciated the help – initially, with Latin and then French – that Silvio provided. In February 1926 when Bernhard was again experiencing difficulties at school, she turned once more to Silvio who confided in her that her older son seemed to be suffering at the moment from ‘a lack of energy and initiative’ (einen Mangel an Energie und Initiative) which even extended to gymnastics, the traditional German sport. With Silvio’s help the problem was soon solved [MvB 20. II. 1926]. Marie remained grateful to Silvio throughout Bernhard’s years at the Fichte Gymnasium and well beyond; for Silvio, Bernhard was the younger brother52 he did not have [MvB 27. X. 1926] (Figure 5). 48 Information from Marie von Bothmer’s letters and Morwitz’s Letter book cited here supplements the entry by Birgit Wägenbaur, in Handbuch v. 3, pp. 1542–44. 49 Biographical information from Wilhelm Wasielewski, Die Violine und ihre Meister, reprint of the 7th and 8th ed., revised and augmented by Waldemar Wasielewski, Leipzig 1927, pp. 525–26.

Ca. 1929.\n\nIn October 1926, Silvio told Marie about his friend the sculptor Alexander Zschokke (see Chapter 2, Pp. 37–38) who had expressed interest in having Bernhard as a model [MvB 14. X. 1926]. Towards the end of that month, when Marie met Silvio’s mother for the first time with the purpose of discussing this possibility over tea, she discovered that Mrs. Markees shared her concern about what society might think about relationships between boys and men [MvB 27. X. 1926].53 Marie and Mrs. Markees believed their sons were very much alike: both were ‘reticent, rather uncommunicative beings’ (verschlossen, wenig mitteilsame Wesen) [MvB 30. III. 1930]. Occasionally, Marie expressed the wish that Bernhard spend more time at home – and less with Silvio, but she never doubted that Silvio was not only a true friend of Bernhard but hers as well. The boys frequently vacationed together both before and after the trip they made to Italy in July 1929 (see Chapter 2, Pp. 46–49) – sometimes travelling around northern Germany and the Netherlands. They were often in Switzerland,\n\nclearing out Morwitz’s apartment in Regensburger Straße – see Chapter 4, P. 86. 53 This issue arose towards the end of the following year when relatives, as she told her mother, doubted the purity (Reinheit) of a friendship such as Bernhard enjoyed with Silvio – it was beyond their ken [MvB 11. XII. 1927]. When they again expressed their mistrust and encouraged her to read clandestinely the letters that Silvio sent to Bernhard, she refused. As she told her mother she simply did not wish ‘… to forfeit his trust forever’ (… ich mir nicht für alle Zeiten sein Vertrauen verscherzen wollte) [MvB 25. XII 1927]. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n26\n\nChapter 1\n\nhiking and swimming in summer, skiing in winter (after Bernhard learned to ski in January 1930 [MvB 19. I. 1930]). Upon graduation from the Fichte Gymnasium, Silvio took up the study of medicine at university in Berlin. Before completing his residency and leaving the capital permanently for Switzerland,54 he and Bernhard spent time together whenever they could. They particularly enjoyed going to the cinema; once, by chance, they ran into Buster Keaton, a favorite film star of theirs, on Tauentzienstraße (mentioned by Bothmer in a letter to Zschokke dated 14. IX. 1930 [StGA]). As far as politics were concerned, both shared a strong antipathy to the NSDAP.55 When Bernhard had a nervous breakdown in November 1938 (see Chapter 4, Pp. 81–83), he turned to Silvio who did everything he could to help. A few years later, Bernhard listed Silvio as his physician in documents dated 22. VII. 1940 submitted to the Swiss authorities for the renewal of his residency permit [copy in the Emigration file]. But by that time, their friendship had already ended because Silvio became involved with and eventually married Bernhard’s girlfriend (see Chapter 5, Pp. 96–97). Although Marie had known about this for some time, she did not inform her mother until December 1941 when she remarked ‘… among all of his [Bernhard’s] friends, Silvio was always the one dearest to me; I – and Bernhard even much more – owe him a very great deal [MvB 10. XII. 1941].’56 Dr. Werner-Max Schäfer (1888–?), a senior teacher (Studienrat) at the Fichte Gymnasium from 1919 until 1932,57 took a special interest in Bernhard whom he taught Latin, Greek, and religion. Schäfer’s concern for Bernhard extended to advising Marie in January 1926 that it was time she should inform him about the “facts of life”.58 Moreover, he urged Marie to encourage her son to make friends with boys his own age; Schäfer did not care for Silvio nor did he approve of the closeness of Bernhard to the older boy [MvB 1. II. 1926]. The sports in which Bernhard regularly enjoyed participating during his secondary schooling were swimming, running,59 and rowing. He became adept at 54 Bernhard described his deep sense of loss when Silvio left Berlin for good in a letter to Wilhelm Stein (dated 23. V. 1939 [StGA]) – see Chapter 4, P. 86 for a lengthy quotation from this letter. 55 So Morwitz [Letter book, p. 180 l]. 56 … unter allen seinen [Bernhard’s] Freunden war mir stets Silvio der liebste, und ich – noch mehr wohl Bernhard – verdanke ihm unendlich viel. Marie added that Bernhard was very upset about the marriage, and she entreated her mother never to mention it (… bitte erwähne du auch nie etwas davon). 57 For this information I am indebted to archivist Annett Krefft, Bibliothek für Bildungsgeschichtliche Forschung, Deutsches Institut für Internationale Pädagogische Forschung, Berlin, email dated 23. VIII. 2016. 58 Marie told her mother [MvB 1. II. 1926] that she planned to delegate this task to her brother Julius. 59 Bernhard wrote Zschokke (letter dated 7. IX. 1929 [StGA]) that he wanted to better his\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nFrom childhood through secondary schooling\n\n27\n\njuggling [MvB 15. V. 1927], a hobby which he continued to enjoy in later life.60 That he had learned to fence is documented by his mother’s mention of an injury he sustained in a match [MvB 18. II. 1934]. Bernhard was also interested in ballroom dancing; in September 1930, he and Silvio were looking for a dancing school [MvB 14. and 21. IX. 1930].61 Marie’s concern that Bernhard might have to repeat a grade [e.g., MvB 20. II. 1926] was unfounded. He reached the upper secondary level (Oberstufe), the last years of high school, right on schedule [MvB 10. IX. 1926], and himself began tutoring younger boys.62 Towards the end of February 1931, he earned the Abitur (roughly equivalent to an American high school diploma, essential for matriculation at a German university). With a grade average of 2 (the second highest achievable), he ranked third in his class of 20 pupils; his mother was understandably proud of him [MvB 1. III. 1931].\n\ntime in the 1000 m. from 3 minutes, 43 seconds, to 3 and a half minutes. 60 As Norma Jean Bothmer told me. 61 Marie mentioned that Bernhard went dancing with Silvio [MvB 19. IV. 1931] and attended a ball [MvB 11. II. 1934]. Sven-Erik Bergh reported in his memoir Leben ohne Grenzen, p. 49, that he, Bernhard, and Silvio also took tap-dancing lessons in Berlin from a ballet dancer after Morwitz encouraged them to do so. 62 Initially reported in Marie’s correspondence with her mother in her letter dated 26. X. 1930; also mentioned by Bothmer himself [StGA/cassette]. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nChapter 2 – Bernhard and the Stefan George Circle\n\nAmong the last youths to become acquainted with the German poet Stefan George (1868–1933), Bernhard was reportedly the one who most deeply affected him.63 Comparatively few non-Germans will be familiar with George. In the Englishspeaking world, his name is not widely known outside the field of German literature; by contrast, in Germany interest in George and the group of those who surrounded him, the George Circle, has increasingly attracted the attention of historians of the Weimar Period and the Third Reich.64 The Master, as members of the Circle referred to him, occupied a unique place in Bernhard’s life beginning in January 1927 when they first met in the atelier of the sculptor Alexander Zschokke. Bernhard’s role in the poet’s life, however, predated that initial faceto-face meeting by more than a year.65 The crucial link between them was Ernst 63 So Grimm, in Handbuch v. 3, p. 1305, citing Goldschmidt, Morwitz im Gespräch, p. 40. An analogous claim has been made for Michael Stettler; see Ute Oelmann, in Handbuch v. 3, p. 1693. – Note that Morwitz [Letter book, p. 100 l.], asserted that Dietrich von Bothmer knew George solely from photos (pace Grimm, in Handbook v. 3, p. 1308). Only when Bernhard went to Bonn in 1932 to study for a semester at the university (see Chapter 3, Pp. 54–55), did he send his little brother to Morwitz [Letter book, 169 rt.; and cf. also Letter book, p. 180 rt.: ‘… by the time Dietrich was old enough to be introduced, George was too ailing to receive anyone whom he did not already know’ (... weil Stefan George als Dietrich in das Alter kam, Stefan George kennenzulernen, schon zu leidend war von [sic] noch ihn bisher Unbekannte zu empfangen)]. 64 Culling the Internet for Stefan George will produce relatively little detailed information for searches restricted to English-language publications. An introduction, in English, to various issues associated with the poet and his circle is provided by essays in A Poet’s Reich. Politics and Culture in the George Circle, Melissa S. Lane and A. Ruehl, eds, Rochester, New York 2011. For George’s biography I recommend (for those who can read German) Karlauff’s Entdeckung des Charisma and the overview of responses it provoked among George specialists which Manfred Koch provides in his own review, in GeorgeJahrbuch 7, 2008/2009, pp.167–79. In the most recent biography of George (Jürgen Egyptien, Stefan George – Dichter und Prophet, Darmstadt 2018) Bothmer is not mentioned. – For essential biographical information on persons in or associated with the Circle who played a role in Bernhard’s life, readers should consult the entries on them in Handbuch v. 3, cited here in the notes. I have supplemented these with additional references when appropriate. Note that Bernhard’s friends Erich Heckel, Ottmar Hollmann, and Sven-Erik Bergh are mentioned in Handbuch, but there are no articles devoted to them in v. 3 since they were not members per se of the Circle. 65 Cf. Morwitz [Letter book, p. 105 l.] commenting on the letter George sent to him from Basel [p. 105 rt., dated 1. I. 1926]. He explained that the mention of ‘… 3 in B[erlin] …’ is a reference to himself, Silvio, and Bernhard, adding: ‘In other words, Stefan George saw Bernhard von Bothmer for the first time in 1925 in Berlin’ (Also sah Stefan George Bern-\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n30\n\nChapter 2\n\nMorwitz (Figure 6) who had come to know Bernhard through Silvio Markees (introduced in the preceding chapter). By the end of 1925, Morwitz (der grosse Ernst – ‘the big Ernst’, his nick-name in the Circle66), Silvio, and Bernhard were a threesome.67\n\nFigure 6: Morwitz , portrait sketch by Alexander Zschokke. 1929.\n\nhard von Bothmer zuerst 1925 in Berlin). 66 Nick-names and initials were commonly used in the Circle – see Raulff, Kreis ohne Meister, pp. 211–12. Morwitz [Letter book, p. 91 l.] states that Stefan George also jokingly called him Sch. W. = Schwarze Wonne (‘Black Bliss’). For the use of Süsser/Süsse (‘sweetie’) by George when referring to his young friends, see Groppe, Macht der Bildung, p. 429. 67 Cf. N. 65. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nBernhard and the Stefan George Circle\n\n31\n\nMorwitz (1887–1971)68 had introduced himself in 1905 to Stefan George, including a poem of his own with a “mash letter” to the poet. Their friendship continued until George’s death in December 1933, despite the internal disputes within the Circle which led to Morwitz’s loss of favor towards the end of the 1920s. He was a lawyer by profession whose career led to high-ranking posts in the Prussian judiciary. But his true calling in life was pedagogical, to give carefully selected boys of promise the guidance necessary so that they might enjoy the “beautiful life” as envisioned by The Master. There was no fixed agenda, but secrecy was one aspect of the program, to reinforce the idea of being “chosen”. Ideally, the process, which included emotional closeness, began when those to be initiated were children and might last several years.69 This was certainly the case with Woldemar Graf von Uxkull-Gyllenband and his younger brother Bernhard (for both, see P. 53 N. 157), whom Morwitz named, alongside Silvio, Sven-Erik Bergh (see Pp. 56–57), and the von Bothmer brothers, Bernhard and Dietrich, as his ‘spiritual sons’ (geistige Söhne) [Letter book, pp. 181 rt. and 195 l.]70 Morwitz’s judicial career began with a position in the Berlin-Schönefeld appellate court in 1914. After the interruption of World War I, when he served as a volunteer paramedic in Ostende, Belgium, alongside his friend the painter Erich Heckel (1883–1970),71 Morwitz worked for a few years in Berlin in the law office of Berthold Vallentin (1877–1933),72 another member of the Circle. In 1921 he was again employed in the state judiciary system. By the time he met Bernhard, he was an associate judge at a district court (Landgerichtsrat); eventually, in 1930, he was appointed superior court judge (Kammergerichtsrat), one of the highest posts in the Prussian judiciary. Because he was Jewish, Morwitz was suspended in April 193373 but reinstated in August the same year; testimonials provided the 68 The primary sources for the summary biography given here are Michael Philipp, in Handbuch v. 3, pp. 1559–64 and the article of Carola Groppe, ‘Deutsch-jüdischer Emigrant’. 69 Groppe, Macht der Bildung, pp. 441–65 passim. 70 There is no evidence that Morwitz’s relationship with any of these boys involved sexual impropriety as defined by contemporaneous society or legislation – § 175 of the German Criminal Code (Strafgesetzbuch) which was in effect from 1871 until 1994. 71 For Heckel and his fellow painters known collectively as Die Brücke, see, e.g., Christian Saehrendt, “Die Brücke” zwischen Staatskunst und Verfemung, Stuttgart 2007, especially pp. 24–25 and 63; for Heckel’s friendship with Morwitz in particular, as well as his association with the Circle, see Michael Philipp, Der Freund des Freundes. Erich Heckel und Ernst Morwitz, Amsterdam 1993. It was through Morwitz that Bernhard got to know the painter who became an important figure not only in his life but also in the life of his younger brother Dietrich whom Heckel taught to paint (cf. Eaton-Krauss, ‘biographical essay’, p. 113). 72 See Jens Schnitker, in Handbuch v. 3, pp. 1728–32. 73 In a letter to Zschokke (dated 5. IV. 1933 [StGA]), Bothmer reported that Morwitz had been ‘relieved’ of his duties (beurlaubt) for an indeterminate period.\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n32\n\nChapter 2\n\nhighest regard for his previous service. The official demand that he “retire” came into effect on 31. XII. 1935. He emigrated to America via England just before Reichskristallnacht, 9./10. XI. 1938 (see Chapter 4, Pp. 80–81). Morwitz has been described as both ascetic and retiring.74 The last adjective, if understood to mean withdrawn, is certainly accurate for the time he remained in Germany following his dismissal from the judiciary75 and, apparently, to the years he lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, too.76 But this characterization seems not to have applied to the period after he began receiving compensation from the German government in 1959 and could leave Chapel Hill.77 There is no mention of Morwitz by name in Marie’s correspondence with her mother until well after Bernhard’s arrival in the U.S.A. An oblique reference occurs in her letter of 30. IV. 1939 when she wrote that Bernhard was involved in clearing out ‘the unpleasant apartment’ (die ungemütliche Wohnung) in Regensburger Straße – doubtless Morwitz’s domicile at No. 29. (Bernhard himself [StGA/cassette] mentioned his responsibility for this task following on Morwitz’s departure from Germany.78) Nearly three years later Marie reported to her mother that she had obtained an address for her son in Durham, North Carolina,79 but she exclaimed rhetorically, ‘… what good is it!’ (… was nützt sie mir!): since the U.S.A’s entry into the war, any letter she might send to an address in North Carolina would not reach its destination [MvB 1. III. 1942]). Nor did Marie mention 74 E.g., Groppe, ‘Deutsch-jüdischer Emigrant’, pp. 88–89. Bergh in his memoir Leben ohne Grenzen, p. 48, described Morwitz’s life style as extremely ascetic, adding that he strictly guarded his private life. Bergh (like Groppe, ibid. and Landmann, Figuren v. 2, p. 78) lists the publications of the George Circle, Kürschners Gelehrtenlexikon (a German “Who Was Who” in academia), and the German Civil Law Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch) as the only books in Morwitz’s apartment. – It is not always easy to distinguish Bergh’s own memories from what he may have read elsewhere; moreover, his incorrect references – e.g., a quotation (ibid. p. 51) about Morwitz’s emigration attributed to the wrong publication of Groppe – and other slips of the pen are disconcerting. 75 Raulff, Kreis ohne Meister, pp. 279–80, refers to Morwitz’s bitterness toward those who then avoided his company. 76 Sidney R. Smith (who was not acquainted with Morwitz) reported that Allen Chappel (who did not know Morwitz well) described him as ‘… somewhat reclusive … very secretive and independent and [who] did not want to talk with people; only when he initiated a conversation did a conversation take place – at least when a student was the other party’; Smith, ‘ “Carolina Vignettes”: Ernst Morwitz, German Literature’, in They Fled Hitler’s Germany and Found Refuge in North Carolina, Henry A. Landsberger and Christoph E. Schweitzer, eds, Southern Research Report 8, Chapel Hill 1996, p. 81. 77 Cf. Raulff, Kreis ohne Meister, pp. 294–95, for a description of Morwitz’s travels after he left Chapel Hill in 1959 until his death (1971) in Switzerland. 78 In fact, following Morwitz’s emigration, when Silvio rented the apartment, Bothmer himself had a room there – see Chapter 4, P. 83. 79 Surely c/o Morwitz, but his name is not mentioned in connection with this address until her letter of 8. VII. 1946.\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nBernhard and the Stefan George Circle\n\n33\n\nStefan George in her letters to her mother until more than three months after Bernhard’s departure from Switzerland and his arrival in the U.S.A. [MvB 4. I. 1942]. The contents of a letter she wrote a week later [MvB 11. I. 1942] make it clear that she knew of her son’s acquaintance with the poet, but not necessarily when they had first met. Decades after Bernhard had been formally introduced to Stefan George in 1927 (in the atelier of Alexander Zschokke – for whom see further, below), Morwitz remarked [Letter book, p. 106 l.] that from the poet’s first glimpse of Bernhard a year earlier, he had ‘treasured’ (schätzte) him whereas he ‘… so to speak accepted’ Silvio (… sozusagen in den Kauf nahm) as Morwitz’s friend. George considered Bernhard, who exercised a ‘… much stronger natural charm than Silvio’ (… viel stärkeren natürlichen Zauber als Silvio), ‘the epitome of the German boy’ (das Muster des deutschen Knaben).80 According to Morwitz81 Bernhard inspired two of the last three poems Stefan George composed, viz. “Das Licht” and the following untitled poem in the cycle Das Lied.82 Among the encounters of Bernhard with Stefan George that Morwitz recalled [Letter book, p. 119 l.] was the occasion when, in his apartment, Bernhard presented The Master with the document naming him the first recipient of the Goethe Prize, awarded by the city of Frankfurt am Main in September 1927. Advised of the city’s intent to give him the prize, the poet demurred, relenting only when the public announcement of the award made refusing it unseemly. His decision was communicated to the city council by Morwitz who asked that he be sent the official notification, in accordance with George’s wishes.83 This may have been about the same time as the occasion when Stefan George, on the way to Zschokke’s atelier, encountered Bernhard whom he took under his cape. When he removed it upon arrival at the atelier, Bernhard was revealed.84 80 So Morwitz who added that years later in the U.S.A. when he maintained contact with Bernhard, his natural charm still had its effect (… Bernhards natürlicher Zauber auf Menschen hat sich erhalten [Letter book, 180 l. for these comments/quotations]). 81 Kommentar, p. 482. 82 See George, Poems, pp. 240 (“Das Licht”; German text) and 241 (“The Light”; English translation); 242 (untitled) and 243 (English translation). Bothmer himself recalled [StGA/cassette] that Fine von Kahler (q.v. Chapter 4, P. 80 N. 309) had described him as ‘marked’ (gezeichnet) because he inspired George to compose verse. 83 A draft of Morwitz’s letter (dated 28. VIII. 1927) and a copy of a letter he sent to Edgar Salin (dated 21. VIII. 1959) confirming his role in the negotiations (and that the document was presented to George by Bothmer), are in StGA; cf. also Letter book, p. 118 l. 84 This anecdote is first mentioned in the Letter book on p. 106 l. and repeated on pp. 172 rt. and 188 l. while on p. 120 l., Morwitz refers to a story involving Bernhard and a yellow scarf which took place before the end of 1927, perhaps even in 1926, but he does not elaborate. – A yellow silk scarf belonged to Stefan George’s customary attire [Letter book, p. 93 l.]: ‘… cotton shirts with a piqué inset and button-on, stiff, white, stand-up collars and … a silk scarf, usually yellow, … around the collar as a sort of neckerchief’ (… Baum-\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n34\n\nChapter 2\n\nMorwitz also remembered [Letter book, p. 172 l.] that in his apartment Bernhard, in the presence of Silvio and the poet, read poems from Der Siebente Ring – among them “Origins” (Urspruenge)85 – ‘… with such intensity that for a short time afterwards he was faint’ (… mit solcher Intensität, dass er nach dem Lesen für kürzere Zeit ohnmächtig war).86 In fact, The Master was ‘especially delighted with Bernhard’s recitation of poems’ (besonders … von Bothmers Vortrag von Gedichten entzückt [Letter book, p. 126 l.]) and duly impressed [Letter book, p. 120 l.] when members of the Circle met for the last time in Berlin at the “Achilleion”, the apartment cum atelier of Ludwig Thormaehlen (1889–1956)87 in Albrecht-Achilles-Straße, in November 192888 for the reading of George’s final poetry cycle Das Neue Reich: Bernhard ‘… alone knew what a Yarte is. He also was the only one who knew that the north-Germanic god of ice-skaters was named “Uller”.’89 In 1993 Bothmer himself, remembering that Morwitz and Silvio took care that he did not meet other members of the Circle except at readings or other meetings arranged at George’s request, noted that he (by far the youngest present) often was the first or last to read from The Master’s works.90 Comparatively frequent mentions of Bernhard occur in the letters of George to Morwitz beginning in early 1927. Worthy of note here is also a reference to Bernhard in Morwitz’s letter to George (dated 20. V. 1927 [StGA]): ‘The child [i.e., Bernhard] has become a tall boy who already has a will of his own and begins to have opinions.’91 From Morwitz’s comments in the Letter book it is clear that Silvio had begun to correspond with the poet earlier.92 But only three of Silvio’s letters to The Maswollhemden mit Piqué-Einsatz und anknöpfbaren steifen weissen Stehkragen … und einen … Schal meist gelbe Seide um den Kragen als eine Art Plastron). 85 George, Poems, pp. 158 and 160 (German text); 159 and 161 (English translation). 86 Cf. Marie’s remark [MvB 5. V. 1929] that Bernhard had been reading much dramatic poetry (viel dramatische Dichtung); in May 1929, George was in Berlin; cf. Zeittafel, pp. 362–63. 87 For whom see Achim Aurnhammer, in Handbuch v. 3, pp. 1710–14. 88 Cf. Zeittafel, p. 359. 89 Bei der letzten Lesung der neuen Gedichte des ‘Reiches’ im Achilleion hatte Bernhard von Bothmer allein gewusst, was ein ‘Yarte’ ist. Er wusste auch allein, dass der nordgermanische Gott der Schlittschuhläufer ‘Uller’ hiess. 90 … sowohl EM wie SM darauf bedacht waren, mich nicht mit anderen Mitgliedern des Kreises um Stefan George zusammenzubringen, außer bei den ‘Lesungen’ oder ‘Kreistagungen’, die von Stefan George in der Fasanenstraße oder im Achilleion berufen wurden und wo ich oft, als der bei weitem Jüngste, als erster oder letzter lesen durfte … [StGA/cassette]. 91 Aus dem Kinde ist ein hochgewachsener Knabe geworden, der schon einen eigenen Willen hat und Stellung zu nehmen beginnt. 92 Silvio became acquainted with George in 1924, according to Morwitz [Letter book, pp. 95 l. and 169 rt.]. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nBernhard and the Stefan George Circle\n\n35\n\nter are in the StGA, rendering the comments made by George in his letters to Morwitz about the others cryptic.93 Similarly, a letter from Bernhard with the description of a poem (… das von B beschriebene gedicht am schluss seines briefes) – along with a letter from Silvio (both mentioned in George’s letter to Morwitz from Basel dated 23. VI. 1927 [Letter book, p. 115 rt.]) – is not preserved. Often George included expressions of affection for both Bernhard and Silvio,94 but his comments about Bernhard imply a higher regard. For example, greetings are included for Silvio, but it is ‘dear Bernhard’ about whom he thinks ‘every day’.95 There are three letters in the Stefan George Archive which Bernhard sent to The Master. The occasion of the first, sent from Falkenberg, was George’s 60th birthday on 12. VII. 1928 (Figure 7): Dear Master! Word of the masterly [sic] birthday extends even out here, as far as the dreary east. On this day I have especially vivid thoughts of our great Master and hope that the enclosed picture [not preserved] – the last taken in Berlin – pleases [you].

And that’s such a very long time. – My Silvio will be just as sad as I during this time, but I realize the necessity of it. From [the] heart, Bernhard.\n\n93 For example, in a letter of uncertain date early in 1927 [Letter book, p. 113 rt.], George stated his conviction that Silvio was proceeding correctly with regard to Bernhard (referred to as S, for Süsse – see N. 66) as he himself has written in his response to a letter from Silvio (both letters are not preserved). 94 For example, in the postscript to George’s letter dated 30. III. 1928 [Letter book, p. 126 rt.], he asks Morwitz to ‘hug S[ilvio] and B[ernhard]’ (Umarme S und B). 95 An den lieben B denke ich jeden Tag [Letter book, p. 125 rt. – undated but apparenty written early in 1928]. 96 I.e., none of the young relatives who were customarily in Falkenberg? 97 In a letter of the same date from Silvio to Stefan George [StGA], he wrote that he hears about loneliness and lack of intellectual stimulus ‘aus Pommern’ – i.e., from Bernhard. 98 Presumably Silvio Markees (cited by name in the next paragraph), Ernst Morwitz, and Alexander Zschokke.\n\n© 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n36\n\nChapter 2\n\nFigure 7: Bernhard’s letter to Stefan George, 12.

II. 1948 [StGA]), he recalled that Max Kommerell (1902–1944)101 had attempted, unsuccessfully, to draw Bernhard away from Morwitz and into his own faction.102 (In a note dated 23. I. 1963,103 Morwitz expressed his own conviction that his loss of status among circle members was Kommerell’s doing.) As for Thormaehlen’s opinion of Silvio and Bernhard, in the same letter to Partsch he wrote: ‘I always considered Sylvio [sic] and the second Bernhard104 too simple; they seemed peculiar to me’.105 Exactly when Bernhard made the acquaintance of the Swiss sculptor Alexander Zschokke (1894–1981)106 remains unclear (Figure 8). Zschokke studied architecture and then painting before turning to sculpture. In 1919 he went to Berlin on the advice of his compatriot the art historian Wilhelm Stein (1886–1970).107 The following year he acquired his own atelier, and his sculptures were shown publically for the first time in a joint exhibition with Thormaehlen’s work at the Kunstverein, Magdeburg, 7.–18. V. 1922.108 Zschokke came into contact with 99\n\nRobert Boehringer (1884–1974; see Christopher Perels, in Handbuch v. 3, pp. 1290– 1295) was named executor in George’s will dated 15. VII. 1932; cf.

Apparently Kommerell had earlier also attempted to befriend Silvio; cf. Morwitz’s comment [Letter book, p. 103 l.] on George’s letter of 10. X. 1925 from Kiel, autographed by Kommerell who had added his own description of Silvio as ‘aloof and disdainful’ (spröde und schnöde) because Silvio did not respond to what Morwitz termed Kommerell’s ‘kitschy letters’ (kitschige Briefe). 103 In Norma Jean Bothmer’s possession. 104 The “first” Bernhard will have been Bernhard Graf von Uxkull-Gyllenband. 105 Sylvio [sic] und den zweiten Bernhard hatte ich immer für zu leicht genommen. Sie waren mir fremd. – Thormaehlen continued: ‘Ernst should have accepted that. ... [Instead] for the second time he hindered the second Bernhard’s development.’ (Der Ernst hätte sich damit abfinden sollen. … Er verhinderte ein zweites Mal das Anwachsen des zweiten Bernhard.) I admit to being stumped about the suggestion that there had been an earlier instance of Morwitz thwarting Bernhard’s development. – Note that Bothmer remarked with obvious amusement [StGA/cassette] that until he left Germany in 1939, he was often treated ‘… like a child – non-intellectual, good-looking, but not very clever’ (… als Kind behandelt – ungeistig, gut-aussehend, aber nicht sehr gescheit). 106 See Stephan E.

Zschokke moved into the building in 1926, three years after the Berlin City Train line (the S-Bahn) was laid out on an artificial embankment right up against the building. His apartment was in the rear right-hand wing of the building. In Marie’s correspondence with her mother she frequently mentions both her sons spending time there. In October 1926 Silvio first mentioned to Marie the idea that her older son might pose as a model for Zschokke [MvB 14. X. 1926]. But the Swiss sculptor may have met Bernhard as much as two years earlier.112 Regardless, Zschokke won Marie’s consent, thanks to the very positive impression he made when he paid her a visit a short time later, and he began work straight away on the statue [MvB 27. X. 1926]. The daily sessions resulted in Bernhard’s ‘… starting to become interested in beauty and to read character from the portrait heads …’ (… fängt an sich für Schönheit zu interessieren sowie dafür, die Charaktere aus den Köpfen zu lesen ([MvB 14. XI. 1926])113 that constituted a significant proportion of Zschokke’s work. A few months after Stefan George’s formal introduction to Bernhard in Zschokke’s studio, Marie remarked in a letter to her mother [MvB 24. IV. 1927] that a visitor to the atelier, as Silvio told her, had asked if the statue were ‘idealized’ (idealisiert). And when Zschokke answered in the negative, the anonymous visitor remarked: ‘Then the youth is either totally unspoiled or he belongs to a 110\n\nWhen Thormaehlen found a new apartment in Albrecht-Achilles-Straße, the Circle resumed meeting in his quarters (see, e.g., Karlauf, Entdeckung des Charisma, pp. 567– 68). 111 Nowadays the address is Fasanenstraße 13. The architect was Bernhard Sehring (1855– 1941) who was responsible for the design of the Theater des Westens, cattycornered across Kantstraße from Fasanenstraße, as well as for other prominent buildings in Berlin in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Constructed in 1889/90, the Künstlerhaus is maintained today by the Künstlerhaus St. Lukas Foundation; see Nicola Bröcker, Das Künstlerhaus St. Lukas. Wunderkammer an der Berliner Stadtbahn [Berlin 2015]. I am indebted to Anni Jänisch, descended from Wilhelm Jänisch, the building’s custodian in the first three decades of the 20th century, for a tour of the building, and for arranging with the current tenant for me to see the apartment Zschokke occupied. 112 This is suggested by Bernhard’s letter to Zschokke (dated 2. X. 1928 [StGA]), q.v. immediately below. 113 This resulted, as Marie remarked subsequently [MvB 1. XII. 1926], in Bernhard’s becoming more tolerable at home. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\nBernhard and the Stefan George Circle\n\n41\n\nvery good family.’114 It is possible, but far from certain, that this visitor was Stefan George.115 In November, Zschokke took Bernhard to a special exhibition on the work of Arnold Böcklin (1827–1901).116 (The Swiss symbolist painter was one of Stefan George’s favorites.117) It can hardly be coincidental that at this time, Marie wrote to her mother [MvB 27. XI. 1927] about having ‘… a very well-educated son when it comes to art’ (… einen sehr kunstgebildeten Sohn). The bronze statue of Bernhard was the centerpiece of the first major exhibition of Zschokke’s work, installed in October 1928 at the prestigious Ferdinand Möller Gallery on Schöneberger Ufer in Berlin118 (Figure 10). Marie had given Zschokke permission to include the statue,119 and she accepted his invitation to attend the opening [MvB 7. X. 1928].120 A notice in the Teltower Kreisblatt of 4. XI. 1928 makes specific mention of the bronze, calling attention to its creator’s affinity for ancient Greek sculpture.121 Portrait heads of Bernhard and Silvio were also included in the exhibition. In the unillustrated flyer the sculptures are simply listed; the bronze statue of Bernhard, No. 6, is described as Jugendliches Bildnis, Bronze. In the copy pictured here (Figure 11), a note added in pencil to the description of\n\n114\n\nDann ist der Jüngling entweder ganz unverdorben, oder er gehört einer sehr guten Familie an. 115 According to Philipp, in Handbuch v. 3, p. 1561, Stefan George was in Berlin and staying with Morwitz in April 1927. 116 This will have been the Böcklin retrospective in the Nationalgalerie, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin; see Andrea Meyer, ‘Eine “denkwürdige” Ausstellung. Justis Böcklin-Retrospectiv 1927’, in Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen 52, 2010, pp. 73–80. 117 Cf. Michael Thimann, in Handbuch v. 2, p. 553 and passim. George visited the exhibition (which Thormaehlen, in his capacity as keeper under Ludwig Justi, director of the National Gallery, had organized) before the official opening: see Zeittafel, pp. 352–53. 118 For Möller and his role as gallerist, see Eberhard Röters, Galerie Ferdinand Möller. Die Geschichte einer Galerie für moderne Kunst in Deutschland, 1917–1956, Berlin 1983, where the exhibition of Zschokke’s sculptures is mentioned in the list on p. 302. I suspect that Zschokke owed the opportunity to exhibit in Möller’s gallery to his friendship with Erich Heckel whose drawings of the preceding years were shown simultaneously in another room. Möller’s partiality to the work of the artists of Die Brücke was well known; cf. ibid. p. 88 and passim. 119 Although initially, when he asked her if Bernhard might pose for him, it was only for study purposes, not for a sculpture intended to be exhibited publically [MvB 27. X. 1926]. 120 In this letter Marie mentioned that she had overheard (presumably at the opening) the comments about the statue expressed among a group of visitors – the statue ‘… could only depict a German youth – precisely what Mr. Zschokke wanted to depict and capture’ (… nur einen deutschen Jüngling darstellen könnte – gerade das hat ja Herr Zschokke wiedergeben und festhalten wollen). 121 I am grateful to the Berlinische Galerie for a pdf of this short notice (one of four) about the exhibition in the Möller Gallery. © 2019, Zaphon, Münster ISBN 978-3-96327-048-2 (Buch) / ISBN 978-3-96327-049-9 (E-Book)\n\n42\n\nChapter 2\n\nNo. 5, Frau v. B., reads Mutter von 6.122 Bernhard himself wrote a letter to Zschokke from Falkenberg (dated 2. X. 1928 [StGA]), just two days before the exhibition was scheduled to open, expressing his feelings about the statue:123 Through the figure [i.e., the bronze statue] and the [portrait] head depicting me I am very closely connected with this exhibition. […] Do you remember how, 4 [sic?124] years ago, I was a little boy, reading on the way to school? The figure depicts the mean between that stage and today – a little goodness and yet somehow a greater essence than just absolutely real dullness, and that’s why the figure always makes me happy – it is not the B of today nor of 1926 but a stylized cross between the two, with much instilled in it which remains for me a great duty to fulfill. It could possibly be called ‘whole.’ That’s why the figure is at the same time a second ‘I’ because it includes so much of the present and of the past. And you, too, have unconsciously put into it very much more than just what hovers above the simple physical presence of a young person: - - - - (I don’t know what to call it because my feelings only hint at it so I can’t find the right word.) I hope you yourself can understand what I have expressed here very instinctively, perhaps somewhat muddled. And I also want to show you with this letter that I also know how to write to you something sensible, not just nonsense.125 122\n\nI am indebted to Philip Gorki, archivist at the Berlinische Galerie, for the information that the handwriting resembles that of Möller himself, but the note cannot be attributed unequivocally to him. Perhaps Marie was the subject of the sculpture, although it seems doubtful to me – especially since she did not mention “sitting” for Zschokke in correspondence with her mother, despite the fact that she expected her father would see the exhibition on a planned visit to Berlin while it was on view [MvB 21. X. 1928]. 123 Here as in his letter to George (P. 35) Bernhard used The Master’s script (G. Baumann, in Handbuch v. 2, pp. 694–98) but standard capitalization and punctuation. 124 This would mean that Bernhard knew Zschokke as early as late 1924 – i.e., Silvio introduced them more or less right after he himself became acquainted with Bernhard. 125 Durch die Figur und den Kopf von mir bin ich ja ganz besonders mit dieser Ausstellung verbunden. … Wissen Sie noch, wie ich vor 4 [sic?] Jahren noch ein kleiner Junge war und auf dem Schulweg las? Und zwischen diesem Stadium und dem heutigen bildet die Figur den Durchschnitt: kleine Nettigkeit und doch etwas grösseres Wesen als absolute reale Geistlosigkeit, und das freut mich immer so an der Figur, dass sie nicht der Heutige und nicht der B von 1926 ist, sondern ein stilisierter Mittelweg, in den viel hineingelegt ist, was zu erfüllen für mich noch eine grosse Aufgabe {bleibt added}. Man kann es vielleicht ‘Ganzheit’ nennen. Drum ist auch die Figur gleichsam ein zweites Ich für mich dadurch, dass sie so viel von Gegenwart und Vergangenheit enthält. Auch legten Sie unterbewusst ein gross Teil von dem hinein, was über der einfachen Körperlichkeit eines jungen Menschen schwebt: - - - - (Ich weiss es nicht zu benennen, da mein Gefühl es nur mir {corrected to mir nur} andeutet, sodass ich das richtige Wort nicht finde.)

XI. 1930 [StGA]) which Zschokke sent to George after the statue had been erected in Aarau, shows that he believed The Master would continue to be interested in the bronze and its reception. The sculptor reported that it had been successfully cast128 and that the unveiling in Aarau, on October 12th 1930, had been greeted with considerable enthusiasm (grosse Begeisterung).129 Zschokke was also along in the summer of 1929 when Bernhard made his first visit to Italy, a milestone in his life.130 Several times previously Bernhard had travelled with Silvio; often they were accompanied by their mentor Morwitz.131 In 1927, for example, the trio was in the Harz and also visited Hildesheim; in late May 1928 they travelled to Vienna and Prague over the school holidays at Pentacost. In December 1928 they were in Weimar, and while in Thuringia they visited the Romanesque abbey and monastic complex Paulinzella. Another trip in 1928 had taken Bernhard and Morwitz to Kolberg, Pommerania.132 Zschokke completed the quartet for the journey to Italy which took them from Innsbruck to Bolzano and on through northern Italy to Verona, Mantua, Parma, Forte dei Marmi, Genoa, Milan, and Lecco. The main sources for the trip and the impression it made on Bernhard are two letters he wrote after he returned to Berlin – one to Stefan George and the other to Zschokke [both StGA] – and the postcards he sent in the course of the journey to his maternal grandparents who were then at Schloss Kunreuth (Figure 12) for a family reunion.133\n\n128\n\nMore than two years earlier, Silvio had reported the successful casting of the sculpture to Stefan George (letter to the poet dated 12. VII. 1928 [StGA]): ‘The little man is cast and wonderfully successful. He strides too lifelike towards you’(Das männchen ist aus dem guss und ganz wundervoll gelungen. Er schreit"
