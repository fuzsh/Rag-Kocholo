Initially subject to persecution by the Roman Empire, it was able to expand after Emperor Constantine accepted Christianity in 311. However, it repeatedly came under pressure from Byzantium and was on occasionally poor terms with both the Church in Constantinople and that in Rome. But such tension was nothing compared to the consequences of the Arab conquest of 639–641. Once covering all of Egypt and some surrounding areas, the Coptic Church’s territory shrank from century to century, affected by actions that ranged from voluntary but strongly encouraged conversions to outright forced ones, with the Copts living until the present day under governments that at best tolerated them and at worst regarded them as enemies. Yet, over recent years, they have flourished in their Egyptian homeland with the creation of more monasteries and a growing interest in Coptic art, literature, and studies. Meanwhile, there has been a continuing diaspora that has resulted in new and sometimes thriving communities in the United States and Europe. It is this long, complex, sometimes glorious, and sometimes tragic history that is summed up in The A to Z of the Coptic Church. The best starting point is the chronology, which casts a glance over nearly two millennia, marking the high points, the low points, and the turning points. The introduction then takes a broader, more analytical look at the situation of the Church in earlier centuries as well as an emphasis on the present day. Although it is a cursory glance, the introduction provides an excellent context in which to examine many of the details that are then expanded through several hundred dictionary entries. Some of these deal with outstanding figures of today and yesterday—patriarchs and monks, those who determined the mainstream and others who deviated, as well xiii\n\nxiv •\n\nEDITOR’S FOREWORD\n\nas the councils convened to decide important events of the day. Others look into the basic theology and practices of the Church, its organization and structure, several outstanding monasteries, its literature and liturgy, as well as other salient matters. An extensive bibliography is there for readers who want to follow up on any particular aspects to a greater depth. This volume was written by one of the most prominent scholars in the field of Coptic studies, Gawdat Gabra. The former director of the Coptic Museum in Cairo, he is the chief editor of the St. Mark Foundation for Coptic History Studies and a member of the board of the Society of Coptic Archaeology. He has taught at various universities in Egypt and the United States and is presently at Claremont Graduate University in California. He has written extensively, and his work includes numerous articles and papers as well as several books, the most recent of which is The Treasures of Coptic Art in the Coptic Museum and Churches of Old Cairo. This historical dictionary, of quite a different nature from his other writings, is a further contribution to a lifetime devoted to furthering knowledge of the Coptic Church. In this effort, he was ably assisted on specific aspects by Birger A. Pearson, Mark N. Swanson, and Youhanna Nessim Youssef. Among them, they have covered the important bases and provided a reference book that will be very helpful for Copts wishing to know more about their own church and for outsiders who may finally realize just how important the Coptic Church is in the overall history of Christianity. Jon Woronoff Series Editor\n\nPreface\n\nToday, visitors to Egypt are encouraged not only to see its famous and imposing pharaonic monuments but also to enjoy its Christian legacy in many ancient Coptic churches and monasteries throughout Egypt as well as in Cairo’s Coptic Museum. Beginning in the early 1960s, the Coptic Church experienced a marvelous renaissance. Its impressive heritage is now known, thanks to numerous publications and, above all, the Coptic Encyclopedia. The Coptic Church’s renaissance is most noticeable in the rejuvenation of monasticism, ecumenical activities, and theological discussions with other churches, the establishment of many new dioceses throughout Egypt, and expansion in North America, Australia, Europe, and Africa. The discovery of the Gnostic Coptic library of Nag Hammadi inspired a veritable boom of interest in Coptic studies, including the history of the Coptic Church, at many European and American universities and academic institutions. Exhibitions of Coptic art and artifacts in several European capitals such as Vienna, Paris, Munich, and Budapest resulted in a vastly heightened awareness of the literary and artistic heritage of the Copts worldwide. The creation of the International Association for Coptic Studies in 1976 emboldened Aziz Suryal Atiya to solicit the assistance of scholars in order to fulfill his dream of a Coptic Encyclopedia. The appearance of this eight-volume work in 1991 played a crucial role in facilitating the research of scholars while at the same time providing nonspecialists with information on all aspects of Coptic civilization. Within a few years, however, the Coptic Encyclopedia went out of print. Unlike many other encyclopedias, this invaluable tool for Coptic studies is not available on the Internet—nor is there any “handy” one-volume reference work, accessible to the scholar, student, and modern reader interested in the history and heritage of the Coptic Church. xv\n\nxvi •\n\nPREFACE\n\nThe scope of this volume, covering nearly two millennia in a single volume, made it mandatory to be selective when choosing subjects to be covered and to exclude others entirely. Although the number of Coptic patriarchs and bishops had to be necessarily limited to those whose impact on the history of the Church was greatest, entries covering major themes such as monasticism and liturgy are comparatively numerous. Many Egyptian scholars who played a role in reforming the Church or in the education of the Copts are mentioned in this work, along with some non-Egyptian figures. The usefulness of the entries on the Coptic Church and its legacy presented in this concise format is enhanced by a bibliography—not only English titles but also many French, Italian, and German titles—in order to enhance the value of the volume and to direct readers to additional sources of information. I take this opportunity to express my gratitude to three colleagues who contributed to this volume. Professor Birger A. Pearson is responsible for the texts on Gnosticism and the codices of Nag Hammadi. Professor Mark N. Swanson provided all entries relating to the Christian Arabic literature of the Copts. Dr. Youhanna Nessim Youssef assumed the task of preparing all the entries relating to the liturgy and theology of the Coptic Church, as well as the entry on hagiography. I am also grateful to the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation and the Brigitte and Martin Krause Foundation, Germany, for two generous grants that freed me from other duties and made it possible for me to devote myself to the manuscript’s preparation. In writing this volume, I have benefited from the library of the Institute of Egyptology and Coptology in Münster, Germany. I am indebted to Dr. David Grafton and Howard Middleton-Jones for correcting my English. Finally, my thanks are extended to the Scarecrow Press and to Jon Woronoff, senior editor, for publishing this volume.

Unofficial sources estimate their number at 9 million or more. The term “Copt” and the adjective “Coptic” derive from qibt, an abbreviated, Arabic transliteration of the Greek word for the indigenous inhabitants of Egypt (Άίγυπτος)/“aigyptioi” (Egyptians), itself a phonetic corruption of ancient Egyptian “Hikaptah,” a name for Memphis, the ancient capital at the apex of the Nile Delta. After the Arab conquest of Egypt in 641, the term qibt came to distinguish the native Christians from the Muslim ˙ the majority of Egyptians converted to Islam during the Arabs. When following centuries, they naturally ceased to be Christians (qibt). The ˙ term “Copt” is relatively elastic as used in historical, ethnic, religious, cultural, and social contexts. Because some other churches that are in communion with Rome are also labeled “orthodox,” scholars apply the phrase “Oriental Orthodox Churches” to those congregations from Egypt, Armenia, Ethiopia, Syria, and India that refused to acknowledge the Council of Chalcedon. Moreover, the term “Coptic” is also used to designate Christian minorities in Egypt who are members of the Roman Catholic Church and of various evangelical denominations to signal their ethnic identity as Egyptians.\n\nHISTORY Some historians consider a “Coptic period” of Egyptian history to date from the second century a.d., simultaneous with the formation of the Coptic language; others prefer the benchmark 451 a.d., the date of the Council of Chalcedon. The Arab conquest of Egypt in 643 a.d. is generally taken to mark the end of the Coptic period. Although Copts never 1\n\n2 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nruled Egypt, they contributed, and still contribute today, to all aspects of Egypt’s culture so that their history may be said to continue right down to the present. The Coptic Church cherishes the memory of the Flight of the Holy Family into Egypt and maintains the tradition of their sojourn in the land of the Nile. It takes pride also in the tradition handed down by the fourthcentury ecclesiastical historian Eusebius that St. Mark the Evangelist preached the Gospel in Alexandria in the mid-first century, and that he was the first Egyptian martyr. There is, however, very little concrete information documenting the spread of Christianity in the first century, for early Christianity is not archaeologically traceable in Egypt. Christianity first gained a foothold in Alexandria where, beginning in the late second century, the first and foremost theological school, the Catechetical School, developed, led by great scholars such as Pantaenus, Clement, and Origen. By the end of that century, Christianity had begun to spread in Egypt, and Patriarch Demetrius consecrated the first three bishops. Because Christians refused to sacrifice to the emperor, they were regarded as a threat to the Roman Empire. Between 249 and 260, under the Roman emperors Decius and Valerian, Christians suffered major persecutions. The second wave of persecutions under Emperor Diocletian made such a lasting impression on Egyptian Christians that the Coptic calendar reckons dates even down to the present in terms of the “year of the martyrs” (a.m.) from Diocletian’s accession in 284. The commemoration and veneration of martyrs is one of the main factors that enabled the Coptic Church to survive. The Edict of Milan, issued in 313 by Emperor Constantine I, put an end to persecution and officially recognized the right of Christians to worship freely. Christianity continued to spread in Alexandria and the majority of its inhabitants became Christians in the second half of the fourth century. Alexander I, Patriarch of Alexandria (312–326), assembled about 100 bishops in a synod. Christianity grew in importance also in the hinterland, where about 80 percent of the population had turned to the new faith by the early fifth century. Alexandria was one of the most important centers that contributed significantly to the formulation of the Christian doctrine. The patriarchs of that great city played a crucial role in the major theological controversies that shaped Christian dogma during the fourth and the fifth centuries. Patriarch Alexander I and his young deacon Athanasius\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 3\n\n(328–373), who later became the most important Coptic patriarch of them all, were instrumental in identifying the heretical ideas of Arius, condemned at the Council of Nicaea in 325. The Nicene Creed, which survives to this day, was a result of that council. It expresses the orthodox belief that Christ and the Father are of one substance. At the Council of Ephesus in 431, Patriarch Cyril the Great opposed the theology of Patriarch Nestorius of Constantinople and championed the role of the Virgin Mary as “God-bearer.” During the fifth century, the struggle over this fundamental issue proved decisive for the history of Christianity in Egypt. Following the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the dispute over the nature of Christ led to an irresolvable schism and to bloodshed between the Christians in Egypt and those in Byzantium. The patriarchs of Alexandria refused to accept what has been called the Chalcedonian Definition of Faith. By that time, monasticism was flourishing in the Egyptian deserts, and monasteries began to provide the Coptic Church with its spiritual leaders. During the doctrinal conflict, the Byzantine emperors wanted to fill the See of Alexandria with men who accepted the Chalcedonian Definition, rewarding their loyalty to Constantinople with military support. The Copts and the wealthy monastic establishments backed the opposing patriarch, who often had to leave Alexandria in order to avoid persecution at the hands of the Byzantine authorities. The Persian occupation of Egypt (619–629) brought more difficulties for the Coptic Church. Sources speak of the destruction of more than 600 monastic establishment by the Persian army. The situation deteriorated further when Byzantium appointed Cyrus in 631 as both civil and ecclesiastical head of the country. Cyrus pursued the Coptic Patriarch Benjamin, who fled for 14 years to Upper Egypt. This wave of Byzantine oppression did not last long, for the Arab army invaded Egypt in 639 and occupied the entire country within two years. The Arab occupation undoubtedly had immeasurable consequences for the history of the Coptic Church. At first, the conquerors respected the Christian community as “people of the Book” or dhimmis, and Patriarch Benjamin was encouraged to return to Alexandria. He restored churches and monasteries, but the building of new churches was prohibited. During the first few decades of the Arab settlement in Egypt, Copts were appointed to most of the high administrative positions in the\n\n4 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\ncountry, but in later centuries the higher offices were delegated only to Muslims. The principal concern of the Muslim rulers, like their Roman predecessors, was the efficient collection of taxes, irrespective of any other consideration. Copts were obliged to pay a supplementary tax known as the jizyiah or poll tax. Initially, monasteries were exempt from this poll tax, but beginning in 705, the monks, too, were obliged to pay it. When the tax burden became unendurable at times in the eighth and ninth centuries, Copts revolted. However, their rebellions were successfully put down. It seems that the brutal suppression of the last Bashmurite revolt in 832 by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma’mun resulted in the conversion of a considerable segment of the Coptic population. The dress code imposed for the first time on Copts during the rule of Caliph al-Mutawakkil (847–861) could not have been implemented were Egypt predominantly a Christian country. Moreover, the Church’s economy as well as its institutions, and especially the monasteries, had been weakened long before that time. The social status of the Copts, including patriarchs and bishops, had also been considerably lowered. Initially, the capital of the Islamic caliphal government was at Medina; in 661, it shifted to Damascus, and from Damascus to Baghdad in 750. The caliphs sent governors to rule Egypt. It was not until 870 that Ahmed Ibn Tulun made himself independent of the Abbasid caliph. In general, the Tulunids (870–905), the Ikhshids (935–969), and the Fatimids (969–1171) were tolerant toward the Christian communities. The Shi‘ite Fatimid caliphs in particular appointed Copts to the most important positions and allowed them to receive the highest honors. The only exception was Caliph Al-Hakim (996–1021), who ordered the sacking of monasteries and churches and dismissed Copts from government offices. They suffered humiliation and were compelled to wear wooden crosses weighing at least five pounds and distinctive clothing. The Fatimids resided in Cairo, the new city that they established to the north of al-Fustat. It was Patriarch Christodoulus (1047–1077) who moved the patriarchate from Alexandria to the Church of al-Mu’allqa in Old Cairo in order to be near the seat of government, although he—and his successors as well—continued to be known as the Patriarch of Alexandria. The arrival of the Crusaders in the Holy Land had long-lasting negative consequences for the Christians in the entire region. Syrian Christians fled to Egypt to take refuge with their coreligionists. But in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 5\n\nEgypt itself, the Crusaders did not distinguish between Muslims and the anti-Chalcedonian Christians; Copts were adjudged heretics. At the same time, Crusader victories led to severe retaliatory actions against the Copts, for Muslim rulers did not distinguish between the indigenous Christians and the invaders. When Egypt’s first Ayyubid ruler, Salah al-Din (Saladin, 1171–1193), came to power, he dismissed Copts from governmental offices. He obliged all Copts to wear distinctive dress and forbade them to ride horses. The great Cathedral of St. Mark in Alexandria was destroyed on the pretext that the Crusaders might fortify it should they take the city. However, the Ayyubid sultans (1171–1250) were in general relatively tolerant of the Copts, so that in 1218 the Egyptian Christians joined forces with them to battle the Crusaders who had captured the northeastern Delta town of Damietta. The Mamluks were slaves brought mainly from the region of the Caspian and Black Seas, sold and trained in Egypt as soldiers. They assumed power in 1250 and ruled Egypt until 1517. The fortunes of the Copts declined steadily throughout this period, and by the time of the Ottoman invasion, their situation was catastrophic. They were often dismissed from government offices. Humiliating rules and regulations were frequently enforced. Persecution and conversions to Islam accelerated the dwindling of the size of the Coptic community. Many Christian houses of worship were pulled down under the Mamluks. On one day in 1321, fanatic Muslims sacked and burned over 60 of the main churches and monasteries throughout Egypt. The art of wall painting with its long tradition in Coptic monasteries and churches deteriorated remarkably and finally ceased during this era. The influence of the Mamluks continued even after the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in 1517. Their leaders served as provincial beys, ruling in effect under an Ottoman governor until the early 19th century. Some Copts occupied significant positions under Mamluk beys; one of them was Ibrahim al-Gawhari (d. 1795), who served as finance minister and was able to restore many Coptic monasteries and churches, as well as to construct new churches. Although the vast majority of Egypt’s inhabitants endured one of the most impoverished periods under Ottoman rule, life as a Copt was less miserable than it had been under the Mamluks. At least Christians were left to lead a relatively peaceful existence trying to preserve what remained of their ancestors’ religious legacy. A significant factor that sustained the existence of the Copts under the\n\n6 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMamluk and Ottoman rules was their success in financial administration, coupled with a comparatively pacific disposition. The French Campaign of 1798–1801 under Napoleon Bonaparte was a watershed: Egypt turned decisively toward modernization. The new ruler of the country, Mohammed Ali (1805–1849), enlisted foreign expertise, established new industries, and introduced new crops and effective irrigation systems. Mohammed Ali and most of his descendants encouraged all Egyptians, regardless of their religious identity, to build a modern Egypt. Copts began to flourish during the 19th century, and in 1855 the poll tax (jizyiah), which centuries of Muslim rule had imposed on them, was lifted. The revival was visible in the cultural movement within the Coptic Church initiated by Patriarch Cyril IV (1854–1861). Known as the Reformer, he established many modern Coptic schools, including one for girls in Cairo, and paid special attention to the teaching of foreign languages as well as Arabic and Coptic, and he imported a printing press from Europe. The contribution of the Coptic elite, educated in the West and in Egypt, to the remarkable economic and cultural development the country experienced during the first half of the 20th century was considerable. The cultured laity’s attempt to establish a more democratic system in Coptic community affairs and in the management of Church properties, however, met with less success. In 1910, Egypt’s prime minister, Butros Ghali, a Copt, was assassinated by a Muslim partisan of the Nationalist Party. This crime led to serious clashes between Copts and Muslims. National unity was achieved only by the revolution of 1919, which pitted both against the British occupation. The emblem of this uprising—a crescent enclosing a cross—reflected the bond between Muslims and Copts who were exiled with the revolution’s leader, Sa‘d Zaghlul, and jailed for their part in the struggle for independence. Undoubtedly, Sa‘d Zaghlul succeeded in unifying Muslims and Copts in his Wafd party. In 1923, Copts comprised nearly 44 percent of its executive committee. The three decades following the revolution of 1919 represent a liberal period that was characterized by excellent relations between Muslims and Copts. By contrast, Copts faced many difficulties in the second half of the 20th century. Under the regime of President Gamal Abd al-Nasser (1952–1970), many wealthy Christian families lost their real estate and other property. His land reform also weighed heavily on the Coptic pa-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 7\n\ntriarchate and on landholding Coptic monasteries. Copts were dramatically underrepresented in high governmental positions, in the army, and on the faculties of universities. A few “token” Copts were nominated to sit in Parliament to demonstrate that they were represented in the political structure. But for all practical purposes, Copts no longer played a role in politics. Matters became progressively worse during the regime of President Anwar al-Sadat (1970–1981), who furthered the Islamization of national life and favored extreme Islamists, whose influence had greatly increased, particularly at universities. Moreover, he instigated Parliament’s adoption of an amendment to the constitution making the Shari‘a (Islamic law) the principal foundation of legislation in Egypt. This amendment, which had already affected many aspects of the Egyptians’ everyday existence, represents a sword directed against the Copts. Muslim militants plundered and set fire to Coptic shops, especially jewelers and pharmacies at al-Minya and Assiut, and attacked churches in villages throughout Upper Egypt. When bloody riots resulted in the torching of three churches at al-Zawya al-Hamra, Cairo, in 1981, Pope Shenouda canceled Easter celebrations as a sign of protest. Sadat issued a presidential decree ordering the patriarch of the Coptic Church to retire in Wadi al-Natrun under what was effectively “monastery” arrest. Pope Shenouda was allowed to return to his seat in Cairo only in January 1985. According to statistics compiled by the Center for Egyptian Human Rights, Muslim fundamentalists have committed 561 acts of violence against Copts since 1994. In the past 25 years, militants attempted to assassinate a number of ministers, slaughtered foreign tourists, and attacked churches in their insurgency against the Egyptian government under President Hosni Mubarak. Most Muslim politicians and intellectuals strongly condemn these criminal activities, which have contributed to the emigration of large numbers of Copts to the United States, Canada, and Australia since the 1960s.\n\nHIERARCHY AND ADMINISTRATION After the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the Coptic Church became a national institution. The hierarchy established at that time has been maintained independently until the present. Throughout its long history, the authority of the patriarch has been understood to continue in a direct\n\n8 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nline of apostolic succession. The Coptic patriarchs are the successors of St. Mark, just as the monks are the spiritual descendants of the martyrs. Thus Pope Shenouda III is the 117th Patriarch of Alexandria and the 116th successor to St. Mark. The patriarch bears the title “Pope and Patriarch of the great city of Alexandria and of all Egypt, the Pentapolis, Nubia, the Sudan, Libya, Ethiopia, and all Africa, and all countries of the preaching of St. Mark.” The patriarch presides over the Holy Synod, which is the supreme ecclesiastical authority, responsible for the protection of the faith, the preservation of tradition, and the Church’s welfare. It is made up of all the Church’s bishops. The hierarchy and administration of the Coptic Church is based on the traditional system of bishop, priest, and deacon. The number of bishops varies from time to time, according to the size of the Christian community and the economic state of the Church. The patriarch, traditionally the bishop of both Alexandria and Cairo, is responsible for vacant dioceses. He ordains bishops, usually after they are chosen by their congregations. The vast majority of bishops come from the monastic milieu. It was Patriarch Athanasius of Alexandria (328–373), who first encouraged monks to be ordained as bishops. The dioceses of Egypt usually enjoyed a considerable measure of autonomy. The Church observed Canon 15 of the Council of Nicaea, which forbade the practice of transferring bishops. Throughout the history of the Coptic Church, bishops have stood united behind their patriarchs, supporting them especially in difficult times, except in a few exceptional cases when a bishop cooperated with Muslim rulers against the patriarch. The Coptic priest has nearly all the same duties as the bishop, with the exception of ordination and a few other functions such as the consecration of icons.\n\nWORLD PERCEPTIONS On 23 October 2001 the Roman Catholic Pope John Paul II was received by Pope Shenouda III in his papal residence that looks out on the Cathedral of St. Mark. The relics of St. Mark are housed in his shrine, which lies behind the cathedral. They were transferred from Venice to Cairo at the order of the Vatican in 1968 as a conciliatory gesture intended to cement goodwill and new relations between the churches of\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 9\n\nRome and Alexandria. Nonetheless, conditioned by history, the Coptic Church seems rather cautious when dealing with “Western Christians.” Many unsuccessful endeavors were made before the second half of the past century to bridge the gap between Rome and the Copts. The first, at the Council of Florence (1439–1443), was followed by other attempts during the pontificate of the Coptic patriarchs Gabriel VII (1559–1565), John XIV (1570–1585), Gabriel VIII (1586–1601), Matthew IV (1660– 1675), and John XVI (1676–1718) to persuade the Coptic Church to defer to Rome. The Copts apparently preferred a union based in love and so rejected a strict legal subjugation to Rome. In other words, the popes of Rome demanded obedience from the Copts, who held out for the status of an equal partner. Despite the persecution of the Coptic Church and its very critical financial state, its patriarchs did not show any enthusiasm for a union with Rome. In Ottoman times, Franciscan friars came to Cairo while the Jesuits settled in Upper Egypt. They succeeded only in the conversion of some individual Copts to Roman Catholicism—in 1683 and 1684 the conversion of four men and more than eight women is documented— but not in their greater goal of a union between the two churches. In 1824 Pope Leo XII of Rome consecrated Abraham Khashur as bishop for the Catholic Copts. The introduction of Catholicism to Egypt profited from the political influence of the French advisors in the government of Egypt’s ruler Mohammed Ali (1805–1848), who endeavored to unite the Coptic Church with the Church of Rome. He commanded his Coptic secretary and head of finances, Mu‘allim Ghali, and his son to proselytize. In 1895, Rome extended its pretensions to superiority over the Coptic Church by establishing a Catholic patriarchate in Alexandria. Cyril Macarius, the new “Coptic” papal nuncio, issued circular letters inviting the priests and congregations of the Coptic Church to recognize the authority of the Roman pope. Beginning in 1879 the Jesuits and the Franciscans founded many seminaries, colleges, and schools throughout Egypt, which benefited the Coptic Catholic community. The attempt of the Russian Archimandrite to “realize the union between the Orthodox Church and the Jacobite Copts” in 1845 proved unsuccessful. When the Russian ambassador to Egypt offered Patriarch Peter VII (1809–1852) the protection of the tsar, the patriarch thanked him, saying that no other protection was needed than God’s own.\n\n10 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Presbyterian Church of North America began missionary activities in Egypt in 1854. Less than a decade later, in 1863, the Egyptian Presbytery founded a theological school to prepare Egyptian pastors for evangelical work. Beginning in 1882 the Church Missionary of England supported the efforts of the Presbyterian Church in Egypt. Their initial aim was to preach the Gospel to Muslims. But having soon discovered the dangers involved in this virtually impossible task, they turned to proselytizing Copts, who admired the simplicity and clarity of their preaching and benefited from the excellent educational opportunities and social services that the missionaries provided. Although the two Catholic and Protestant minor communities contributed to some extent to the modern awakening of the Coptic Orthodox Church from centuries of lethargy under Mamluk and Ottoman rule, their primary purpose of preaching the Gospel to Egyptian Muslims changed to proselytizing Orthodox Copts, whose fathers had kept their faith for centuries, surviving repeated waves of persecution. Therefore, it is no wonder that the Coptic Church felt unfairly challenged by “Western Christians.” The current pope, Shenouda III, was instrumental in overcoming centuries of silence by initiating ecumenical activities. In 1973, he and Roman Catholic Pope Paul VI issued a joint statement of Christology in Rome that has led to further dialogue between the two churches. Pope Shenouda visited the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1979, who returned the favor with a trip to Egypt in 1987. Their joint communiqué confirmed the Nicene Creed as the basis of faith. Pope Shenouda called for a meeting between the Coptic Evangelical Community Council and Coptic Orthodox theologians, which took place in 1988 at his monastic residence in the Monastery of St. Pshoi, Wadi al-Natrun. Such fruitful meetings are repeated frequently. The Coptic Church has been an active member of the Church Council of the Middle East since its establishment in 1974 and of the World Councils of Churches since 1954.\n\nCURRENT GEOGRAPHICAL EXTENT Reliable statistics concerning the Coptic population are unavailable, and any attempt to estimate the number of Copts living in Egypt must be made with extreme caution, especially since a vast discrepancy ex-\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n• 11\n\nists between the figures provided by the Egyptian government and those originating with Church authorities. Unfortunately, the governmental census does not accurately reflect the number of Christians. In 1975 the figures issued by the Egyptian government placed the number of Copts at 2.3 million, while the Coptic Church counted 6.6 million or nearly three times as many. In 2000 the Coptic Church claimed its community numbered 9,817,000. The tally of Copts who left Egypt for the West in the second half of the 20th century, primarily because of economic and political discrimination, has been estimated at between 400,000 and 1 million. A sizable proportion of them emigrated to avoid the Islamization of Egypt’s national life and the increasing influence of Muslim fundamentalists under Sadat. The majority of Copts abroad live in North America and Australia. There are 125 churches in the United States, 27 in Canada, and 37 in Australia and New Zealand. Many other Coptic churches were established in Europe, South America, Africa, and Asia. These congregations are served by Coptic priests with a number of local bishops. The latter are consecrated by Pope Shenouda III, who is keen to strengthen the ties between the “Mother Church” and the “churches in the lands of emigration.”\n\nPRESENT AND FUTURE CHALLENGES The 21st century has not brought any improvement in the lives of the Copts in Egypt. Primary evidence of discrimination is provided by the many restrictions placed on the construction of churches. Procedures to acquire permission to build are notoriously long, sometimes lasting for decades. It is indeed ridiculous that not a single Egyptian university has a Department of Coptic Studies; the American University in Cairo boasts the only academic “minor” in the field. Copts still suffer discrimination, particularly regarding appointments to governmental positions of influence, such as those of provincial governor, city manager, university president, and director of educational districts. Copts are rarely promoted in the ranks of the police or within the army. The new policy of President Sadat in the early 1970s empowered Islamic extremism and led to the reemergence of the Muslim Brotherhood, which now claims 25 percent of the seats in Parliament. This movement\n\n12 •\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nstrives to implement the Shari‘a and to apply it to every aspect of daily life. Instances of Islamic fundamentalist attacks on Coptic churches and the plundering or burning of their properties after the Friday prayer service occur from time to time in the absence of effective protection by government agencies. The time has come for Copts to become politically active after decades of their effective exclusion from the political life and institutions following the revolution of 1952. They should seek cooperation with those moderate Muslim politicians and intellectuals who strongly condemn the criminal activities of Muslim fundamentalists. Such cooperation is imperative to improving the educational program of schools and universities and to fostering understanding and peaceful social relations between Muslims and Copts in and by means of the mass media. The modernization of the educational and cultural institutions of the Coptic Church will be indispensable in facing the challenges of the decades to come.\n\nTHE DICTIONARY\n\n–A– ABARKAH. Eucharistic wine. An Arabic corruption of the Greek word aparche, which means “beginning of a sacrifice” or “first fruit.” Coptic tradition uses this word for the Eucharistic wine in order to highlight the symbolism of Christ as our sacrifice and the first raised among mankind. This wine is either made from dried raisins or grapes. It is noteworthy to mention that wine has played an important role in the life of the Coptic community. The site of the Monastery of St. Jeremiah at Saqqara contains a liturgical calendar indicating the quality of wine issued for each feast. ‘ABD AL-MASIH AL-ISRA’ILI (late 10th c.). Apologist. According to the title of his Book of Induction (Kitab al-istidlal), ‘Abd al-Masih was a Jew of al-Raqqah who was led to Christianity by the famous Christian physician Mansur ibn Sahlan (d. ca. 1004), who flourished under the early Fatimid caliphs. A précis (by Samir Khalil, “‘Abd al-Masih”) of ‘Abd al-Masih’s unpublished book suggests that it is a compendium of arguments for the truth of the Christian faith (in particular, the doctrines of the Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Crucifixion of Christ), much of it gathered from earlier Arabic Christian literature from outside Egypt. The arguments range from the standard “proofs” for the true religion through prophecies and miracles to sophisticated apologetic exploitation of notions found in the (relatively recent) Arabic translations of Greek philosophical and mathematical works. As ‘Abd al-Masih becomes better known, he will undoubtedly gain in stature as a pioneer of Arabic Christian apologetic literature in Egypt.\n\n13\n\n14 •\n\n‘ABD AL-MASIH, YASSA (1889–1959)\n\n‘ABD AL-MASIH, YASSA (1889–1959). He taught in the Clerical College and the Higher Institute of Coptic Studies and served as the librarian of the Coptic Museum. He was a competent scholar who specialized in Copto-Arabic literature and the Coptic language. He strove for the preservation of the manuscripts of many monasteries and old churches. He prepared some catalogs of the manuscripts in his own handwriting, such as those of the libraries of the Monastery of St. Antony and the Monastery of St. Paul. With Marcus Simaka Pasha he published the Catalogue of the Coptic and Arabic Manuscripts in the Coptic Museum, the Patriarchate, the Principal Churches of Cairo and Alexandria and the Monasteries of Egypt, in two volumes, 1939–1942. ABLUTION. The ablution, or washing of the hands, is performed by the priest twice during the liturgy. The first occurs just before the offering of the bread. The minister (priest or bishop) washes his hands and recites from Psalms 50:7–8 or 25:6–7, according to the majority of the manuscripts, although some manuscripts prescribe that he recites Psalm 50:7–10. The second ablution is during the recitation of the Creed. The minister again washes his hands and recites the same psalms. ABSOLUTION. The Absolution is a prayer recited by a priest begging from God the remission of the sins of the people or of an individual repentant in accordance with the authority given in the Gospels (Matt. 16:18, 18:18; John 20:23). In the Coptic language, the word for this prayer means “freedom.” A special feast for the Absolution took place in Middle Egypt, where we find that Christ promised the saint that he will tear up the deed of their (the faithful’s) sins. The Absolution is an integral part of any liturgical church service. It is recited during the offering of incense (Vespers and Matins), the mass, the ceremony of matrimony, the Unction of the Sick, the genuflection, the Liturgy of the Water of the Basin, the burial services, and baptism. On many occasions, the priest reads the Absolution inaudibly. Some Absolutions are addressed to the Son, while others are addressed to God the Father. The former are likely to date from the sixth and seventh centuries when Egyptian monks started to address\n\nABU AL-MAJD IBN YU’ANNIS (?–BEFORE 1357)\n\n• 15\n\nprayers to the Son. It is important to mention that the priest recites the Absolution after the confession of the repentant. ABSTINENCE. See FASTING. ABU AL-MAKARIM. See HISTORY OF THE CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES OF EGYPT. ABU DAQN, YUSUF (ca. 1565–ca. 1630). Linguist and historian. He was sent by Patriarch Gabriel VIII (1586–1601) to Rome in 1595, at a time when the Church of Rome attempted to reestablish a union with the Coptic Church under its authority. Abu Daqn did not return to Egypt and instead became a Catholic. In Rome, he learned Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, and Chaldean, in addition to Arabic, his mother tongue, and Coptic, the language of the liturgy of the Coptic Church. He also learned Italian, Spanish, and French. Around 1600 he was appointed a translator at the court of King Henry IV. In 1603, he began to teach Arabic at Oxford University, where he compiled, in Latin, a history of the Coptic Church that appeared in 1675, long after his death. It was translated into English by Sir Edward Sadleir and published in London in 1733. Abu Daqn copied Coptic liturgical texts, probably to use them in his teaching at Oxford, where he remained for 10 years. He prepared an Arabic-Latin lexicon and other volumes in Arabic in Belgium, and taught Hebrew at Louvain. He sojourned in Munich from 1618 to 1620, where he worked At the Grand Ducal Library. ABU AL-MAJD IBN YU’ANNIS (?–before 1357). Priest, theologian. Abu al-Majd ibn Yu’annis was a priest of Minyat Bani Khasib (present-day Minya) in Middle Egypt. The dates—and even the century—of his activity are not known, although the oldest dated manuscript of his work (from 1357) provides a terminus ad quem (a final limiting point in time). At the request of one Bishop Ghubriyal of Qus, he wrote a Commentary on the Creed that, in response to Jewish objections to Christian use of a nonbiblical text, provides Old Testament testimonia for every clause in the symbol of Nicaea (the Nicene Creed). Abu al-Majd also on occasion quotes from the\n\n16 •\n\nABU MINA\n\nQur’an and from the Greek sages, which perhaps indicates that he had wider apologetic and catechetical goals for the work. As Samir has pointed out (“Abu al-Majd,” 21), Abu al-Majd’s concentration on the Old Testament neatly complements other CoptoArabic commentaries on the Creed: that of Sawirus ibn al-Muqaffa‘, written against the background of Christological controversy with the Melchites and Nestorians, and that of Abu al-Barakat ibn Kabar in the second chapter of his encyclopedia, The Lamp of the Darkness, which consists largely of quotations from the New Testament. ABU MINA. A most significant pilgrimage center of the Late Antique period. It is located about 45 kilometers southwest of Alexandria near Lake Mareotis, where the tomb of St. Menas was venerated from the fourth century onward. According to a tradition, St. Menas was an Egyptian recruit in the Roman army who was martyred because of his Christian faith. When a spring of healing water appeared at the tomb site, pilgrims flocked to his shrine. Byzantine emperors erected splendid buildings there. The huge pilgrimage center flourished from the fourth to the eighth century. Its vestiges include churches, colonnaded avenues, arches, streets, several public buildings, hostels, baths, markets, and presses for both wine and oil. The shrine of St. Menas became the Lourdes of ancient times. People came from all over the world, taking home the famous Menas flasks, which were found not only in Egypt but also in Europe. The flasks are decorated with St. Menas between two camels. ABU SALIH THE ARMENIAN. See HISTORY OF THE CHURCHES AND MONASTERIES OF EGYPT. ABU SALIH YU’ANNIS (late 10th or early 11th c.). Canonist. Abu Salih Yu’annis (or Yunis) ibn ‘Abdallah prepared a collection of canon law (in 48 headings) by gathering materials from (probably) Coptic sources and translating them into Arabic. This work was incorporated into the canonical compendium of the monk Maqara (active before 1350), who reports that he found it in a manuscript dated to 1028. If this is correct, then Abu Salih becomes one of the pioneers of Copto-Arabic canonical literature, a figure marking the beginning\n\nAL-AS‘AD IBN AL-‘ASSAL (?–BEFORE 1259)\n\n• 17\n\nof a trajectory that finds its culmination in the work of al-Safi ibn al-‘Assal or of Maqara, two and three centuries later respectively. ACT OF PETER (BG, 4). A Coptic translation of a narrative featuring Peter’s healing activity on a certain Sunday, presumably in Jerusalem. Surprisingly, Peter reverses the healing of his invalid daughter in order to preserve her virginity. This narrative was probably part of the lost beginning portion of the apocryphal Act of Peter composed in Greek in the second century. ACTS OF PETER AND THE TWELVE APOSTLES (NHC VI, 1). An account of the adventures of Peter and his companion Apostles on a journey taken by them after Jesus’ resurrection. In the text, Peter meets a pearl merchant named Lithargoel, and at his bidding, Peter and his companions go to Lithargoel’s city. Lithargoel turns out to be the risen Christ, who commissions them for ministry. The title appears at the end of the tractate. Extant only in Coptic, Acts of Peter and the Twelve Apostles was composed in Greek. It resembles other apocryphal Acts produced in the second and third centuries. Its provenance is uncertain. ADAM. The tune to which hymns are sung on Sundays, Mondays, and Tuesdays. The name is taken from the first word of the verse of the Theotokia for Monday: “Adam was yet sorrowful of heart.” AJBIYAH. See CANONICAL HOURS. AL-AS‘AD IBN AL-‘ASSAL (?–before 1259). Biblical scholar, theologian, scholar of Coptic. Al-As‘ad Abu al-Faraj Hibatallah ibn al-‘Assal was probably the eldest of the Awlad al-‘Assal. He was married, a skilled scribe, an avid collector of books, and a frequent traveler to Damascus; he may well have been a civil servant in the Ayyubid administration. The only sure dates that we possess for him concern two of his compositions. An early work, The Treatise on the Soul, was written in 1231. Al-As‘ad’s masterwork was composed two decades later, in 1252–1253: a new Arabic translation of the Gospels, made after collating the various Coptic and Arabic translations in use\n\n18 •\n\nALEXANDER I, PATRIARCH\n\nby the different Christian communities of his day (including Arabic translations made from Greek and from Syriac), and supplied with an apparatus reporting readings or translations different from his own. The resulting text is elegant and much superior to the standard Arabic translation of the Gospels from Coptic (the so-called Egyptian Vulgate), but was never accepted into general use. Despite the fact that al-As‘ad’s translation of the Gospels continues to attract attention and admiration, no critical edition of it has yet been published. Al-As‘ad’s bibliography contains a number of other works, including a Coptic grammar, a work on the epact calculation (for working out the date of Easter), and poetic summaries of inheritance and marriage laws. He also assisted the monk Da’ud (the future patriarch Cyril III) ibn Laqlaq and Bulus al-Bushi in the composition of their Book of Confession. ALEXANDER I, PATRIARCH. He was the 19th patriarch of the See of St. Mark (312–326). He succeeded Achillas in the year 312 a.d., just after the end of the great persecution. Alexander faced three problems during his episcopate. He was first troubled over the timing of the Easter observance by a schismatic faction led by a certain Erescentius. Alexander was obliged to write a special treatise on this paschal controversy, referring to previous patristic declarations by Dionysius the Great. This matter remained a sore point until it was settled by the bishops at the Council of Nicaea in 325. The second problem that faced the patriarch occurred at Lycopolis in Upper Egypt, where Bishop Melitius, who had been calumniating Achillas (his predecessor), continued to do the same to Alexander. This culminated in Melitius lodging a formal complaint against Alexander before the imperial court under Constantine, but the court paid no great attention to it. More seriously, Melitius seems to have established a kind of alliance with the most dangerous of the patriarch’s adversaries, Arius. Further, Melitius consecrated his own schismatic bishops, ignoring his ecclesiastical superior. The Melitian schism remained in full force until it was temporarily settled at Nicaea in 325 a.d. through the wisdom of the patriarch, who made a compromise in order to win the bishop back to the fold, thus ending Melitius’ alliance with Arius. The third problem that faced Alexander was the most dangerous of all heretical movements: that of Arius, who\n\nALEXANDER I, PATRIARCH\n\n• 19\n\nwas excommunicated by Peter I, only to be readmitted by Achillas and appointed as presbyter of the most ancient of the Alexandrian churches, at Bucalis. The church was located in the most populous district of the metropolis, where Arius could exercise a great influence on the Christian population. Arius ran as a rival to Alexander at the time of his elevation to the episcopate. Open hostilities between the two broke out when Alexander declared the unity of the Trinity in one of his sermons. Arius at once branded his declaration as mere Sabellianism. Since the Father created the Son of God, he argued, the Son could not be coeternal with his Father. This was the beginning of a long argument, which the future heresiarch enlarged to frightening dimensions as he acquired the support of increasing numbers of followers. Literature and Works. Alexander I is represented most fully in Eusebius’ Historia ecclesiastica. He is also mentioned in the lives and encomiums of his successor, Athanasius the Apostolic. These accounts tend to present Alexander in the shadow of his great successor who, as his secretary, would have led the struggle against Arius and his disciples, both at Alexandria and at the Council of Nicaea, if Alexander had not taken the initiative. Of his works, only one collection of letters related to the Arian controversy was known in antiquity, and of these, only two letters have survived. Also, a homily, De anima et corpore (On the Soul and the Body), is ascribed to him in a Syriac version, but the Coptic version attributes this work to Athanasius. Coptic literature attributes to Alexander an Encomium of Peter the Alexandrian, known in five codices: VC62.10 (Bohairic, ninth century), VC62.8 (Bohairic, two fragments, ninth century), and three fragmentary codices from the White Monastery. There is also an elaborated Arabic translation to be found in the chapter concerning Alexander in the History of the Patriarchs. It is possible to reconstruct the original redaction of this encomium by comparing the various versions in existence. It must have been composed of three segments, characterized as follows: a literary prologue; the main body, which recounts his birth, life, and martyrdom, with vivid descriptions of the many miracles wrought at his birth, during his life, and after his death; and a literary epilogue. Except for a few minor variations, the Sahidic and Bohairic redactions are similar, save that the Bohairic version has excluded the martyrdom and posthumous miracles.\n\n20 •\n\nALEXANDRIA\n\nThe text appears to be a typical, late construction, filled with biblical allusions, vague traditions, and the portrayal of Peter’s Passion. The complexity of the literary structure, the theological competence, and the style make it one of the best examples of literature of this period, and probably one of the first whose date can be proposed as being at the first half of the seventh century. ALEXANDRIA. Founded in 331 b.c. by Alexander the Great at the western end of the Nile Delta. An Egyptian town, Rakote, already existed there on the shore and was a fishermen’s resort. From its very beginning, Alexandria developed rapidly into one of the world’s great cities. The city replaced Memphis as the capital of Egypt under the Ptolemies and became a great center of Hellenism and Semitism. The foundation of the famous library of Alexandria by Ptolemy II (283–244 b.c.) made the city the cultural center of the Mediterranean world for many centuries. According to one tradition, it was Ptolemy II who instigated the work in the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Torah) for the library at Alexandria, where a Jewish community flourished during the centuries immediately preceding the birth of Christ. The Jewish thinker and exegete Philo (ca. 20 b.c.–50 a.d.) was the most important figure among the Hellenistic Jews in the first century. Alexandria was a cosmopolitan city with a large number of Greek inhabitants. Alexandria is undoubtedly the cradle of Egyptian Christianity, where the famous Catechetical School was established in the second century and became a leading center of the allegorical method of biblical interpretation. The first Egyptian Christians undoubtedly spoke Greek. According to the church historian Eusebius, St. Mark the Evangelist arrived at Alexandria in 43 a.d. and preached the Gospel there. Tradition would have it that St. Mark the Evangelist brought Christianity to Alexandria in the middle of the first century and was martyred in that city. During Roman and Byzantine times, the city remained the center of classical learning and the intellectual capital of the cultured world until its occupation by Muslims after the Arab conquest of Egypt (639–641). It was the home of one of the most famed libraries of antiquity. Many of the early Church Fathers such as Clement, Origen, and Athanasius were either Alexandrians by birth or adoption. Alexandrine scholars were also influenced by\n\nAL-GOHARY, IBRAHIM (?–1795)\n\n• 21\n\nGnosticism, as the great city was the home of the two Gnostic teachers, Basilides and Valentinus. The Council of Nicaea assigned to Alexandria a position second only to Rome and superior to Antioch. The patriarchs of Alexandria played a significant role in the religious policy and the universal theological controversies of the fourth and fifth centuries. However, the importance of Alexandria was affected by the rise of Constantinople and the Council of Chalcedon. The Christian monuments and religious institutions in Alexandria and its vicinity must have been exceptional indeed. Like many of its other monuments, the ancient churches and monasteries in and around Alexandria have been almost completely destroyed. The Christian monuments suffered much damage during the Persian occupation between 619 and 629. However, Church historian Abu al-Makarim/ Abu Salih (13th century) mentions more than 40 churches; among them is the church of St. Mark on the seashore, known as Bucalis, the spot where St. Mark was martyred and buried. That great church was pulled down during the Crusades by the Ayyubid Sultan al-Kamil around 1218 on the pretext that it might furnish the Crusaders with a fortified position in Alexandria. When the Arabs seized Alexandria, the Melchite patriarch Cyrus left the city with the Byzantine army, and the Coptic patriarch Benjamin ended his exile and returned to Alexandria. The great city continued to be the residence of the Coptic patriarch as late as the 11th century, when Patriarch Christodoulos (1047–1077) transferred the patriarchal seat to the Mo‘allaqa Church in Old Cairo to be closer to the rulers of the country. AL-GOHARY, IBRAHIM (?–1795). Minister of finance. He was one of the most important and influential Coptic laymen who contributed to the beginning of the renaissance of the Coptic Church in the 18th century. He was born in the district of Haret al-Saqqayen in Cairo, which was predominantly populated by Copts. He worked for two patriarchs, Mark VII (1745–1769) and his successor, John XVIII (1769–1796). He began his career during the tenure of Mu’lim Rizq, the administrator of finance of the Mamluk ‘Ali Bey in Ottoman Egypt. Under Ibrahim Bey, al-Gohary became the chief scribe of all Egypt, a position that is equivalent to finance minister. Al-Gohary was one of the most influential personalities in the Egyptian state. He was a humanitarian who gave donations to needy families and was\n\n22 •\n\nALLOGENES (NHC XI, 3)\n\naffable to everyone. He served the Coptic Church using his financial and political influence. During his lifetime many monasteries and churches all over Egypt were restored, and new churches were constructed. Al-Gohary was able to obtain permission from the Ottoman sultan to build the Coptic Cathedral of St. Mark at al-Azbakiah. His brother Girgis completed its construction. When al-Gohary died, Ibrahim Bey was saddened and went to participate in his funeral, although it was improper for a Muslim to do so. The tomb of al-Gohary is located near the Church of St. George in Old Cairo. ALLOGENES (NHC XI, 3). A Sethian Gnostic revelation discourse in which a certain Allogenes transmits to his “son” Messos revelations received from a feminine deity called Youel, and then describes his ascent to heaven. Allogenes (“of another race”) is probably another name for Seth. The title is given at the end of the tractate. Heavily influenced by second- and third-century Platonism, Allogenes was one of the Gnostic “apocalypses” read in Plotinus’ school in Rome in the mid-third century (VP 16). Extant only in Coptic, it was originally composed in Greek, probably in the early third century, possibly in Egypt. AL-MAKIN JIRJIS IBN AL-‘AMID (1205–after 1280). Historian. Al-Makin Jirjis ibn Abi al-Yasir ibn Abi al-Makarim, known as Ibn al-‘Amid, was a Copt of Syrian Orthodox ancestry who, like his father before him, served in high office in the Egyptian military bureaucracy. Such a position carried risks, and al-Makin lived in especially risky times (in which the new Mamluk rulers of Egypt had to prove themselves in the face of the Mongol invasions from the East as well as continued Crusading activity from the West); whether a victim of circumstance, poor choices, or intrigue, he ended up spending over a decade (1261–1272 or 1276) in prison. After his release, he composed a world history (from the Creation until the accession of the Mamluk sultan Baybars in 1260) in which he drew heavily on earlier sources, including the world history of ibn al-Rahib. If not a strongly original work, al-Makin’s history has been very influential in both the East and West: it was used by the 14th–15th century Muslim historians ibn Khaldun, al-Qalqashandi, and al-Maqrizi; an Ethiopic translation of the work was made; and, in 1625, the second part\n\nAL-MUFADDAL IBN ABI AL-FADA’IL (?–AFTER 1357)\n\n• 23\n\nof the history (the Historica Saracenica) was published by Thomas Erpenius in Leiden, providing Western scholars with an important source for Islamic and Eastern Christian history. AL-MU’TAMAN IBN AL-‘ASSAL (?–last quarter of 13th c.). Priest, theologian, encyclopedist. Al-Mu’taman Abu Ishaq Ibrahim ibn al-‘Assal was probably the youngest of the three authors of the Awlad al-‘Assal, and he is the one whose life is best known to us, thanks now in part to the investigations of Wadi Abullif (see the bibliography). Al-Mu’taman was ordained priest (perhaps by Cyril III ibn Laqlaq), was widowed at an early age, and on several occasions served the Coptic community in Damascus, where he lost his library during anti-Christian rioting in 1260 (following the Mongol defeat at ‘Ayn Jalut). Al-Mu’taman had already begun his literary production by the 1230s, and a number of his writings—letters, homilies, an introduction to the Pauline epistles, liturgical primers, and a rhymed CopticArabic vocabulary—have been preserved. Al-Tabsira al-mukhtasira (The Concise Instruction), composed in 1260, is an apology for the Christian faith, the Triunity of God, and the Incarnation. Al-Tabsira, however, was simply a foretaste of al-Mu’taman’s masterwork: his theological encyclopedia Majmu‘ usul al-din (The Compilation of the Fundamentals of Religion)—now available in Wadi Abullif’s critical edition. Its 70 chapters are divided into five parts: fundamental theology; the Triunity of God; Incarnation; miscellaneous theological, moral, and liturgical matters; and eschatology. Al-Mu’taman draws on a wide variety of identified sources, thereby not only preserving texts otherwise lost but also allowing the reader to sense the catholicity of his theological vision AL-MUFADDAL IBN ABI AL-FADA’IL (?–after 1357). Historian. Al-Mufaddal ibn Abi al-Fada’il continued the world history of alMakin Jirjis ibn al-‘Amid (who may have been his great-uncle), picking up where al-Makin left off with the accession of the Mamluk sultan Baybars in 1260, and continuing through the death of al-Malik al-Nasir in 1341. It is for the most part a secular history that draws from Muslim sources, but it occasionally refers to events within the Coptic community.\n\n24 •\n\nAL-RASHID ABU AL-KHAYR IBN AL-TAYYIB (?–AFTER 1270)\n\nAl-Mufaddal wrote his history for his own personal use, and it has only survived in a single manuscript (where it has the Arabic rhyming title al-Nahj al-sadid wa l-durr al-farid fima ba‘d Tarikh Ibn al-‘Amid (The Correct Procedure and Singular Pearl in What Comes after the History of Ibn al-‘Amid); the text’s publication in the 20th century has provided scholars with an important source for early Mamluk history. AL-RASHID ABU AL-KHAYR IBN AL-TAYYIB (?–after 1270). Priest, theologian. Al-Rashid Abu al-Khayr ibn al-Tayyib worked as a priest, physician, and possibly also scribe to a Muslim notable. He was the author of a number of theological and apologetic works, most notably Tiryaq al-‘uqul fi ‘ilm al-usul (The Theriac of Intellects in Fundamental Theology), an explanation of Christian beliefs and practices with responses to questions raised by Muslims. His wide reading is evident in frequent allusions to figures such as Abu Hamid al-Ghazali, Musa ibn Maymun (Maimonides), and Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. Although al-Mu’taman ibn al-‘Assal speaks very highly of al-Rashid in his theological encyclopedia and quotes extensively from his treatise on free will, others (as we learn from Abu al-Barakat ibn Kabar) passed a negative judgment on his apologetic capacity and even his orthodoxy. Perhaps because of this negative assessment, the genuinely popular Tiryaq often circulated under the names of others, including Ibn Kabar, the Awlad al-‘Assal, or Sawirus ibn al-Muqaffa‘; furthermore, accurate information about al-Rashid’s life—including when he lived—has been difficult to come by. The researches of Wadi Abullif (“Al-Rasid ibn al-Tayyib”) have now established al-Rashid as an important writer of the period between 1240 and 1270, and one who deserves a renewed assessment after new editions of his works have been published and studied. AL-SAFI IBN AL-‘ASSAL (?–ca. 1265). Canonist, theologian, apologist. The reputation of al-Safi Abu al-Fada’il Majid ibn al-‘Assal has long rested on his magisterial canonical collection, the Nomocanon of 1238 commonly known even today as al-Majmu‘ al-Safawi (alSafi’s Compilation); this has allowed brief characterizations of the Awlad al-‘Assal to refer to the accomplishments of al-Safi in the canonical field alongside those of his brothers al-As‘ad in the bibli-\n\nAL-THIQA IBN AL-DUHAYRI (?–AFTER 1267)\n\n• 25\n\ncal field and al-Mu’taman in the theological. Recently, however, the work of Samir Khalil Samir (see the bibliography) in particular has shown us that al-Safi must be remembered for much more than his work in canon law, however important that work was to the future functioning of the Egyptian and (as the Fetha Nagast or Law of the Kings) Ethiopian churches. Surprisingly little is known about al-Safi’s life; he was a lay theologian who may have worked in one of the government bureaucracies. He had dealings with Patriarch Cyril III ibn Laqlaq, writing discourses in honor of the latter’s election in 1235 and upon his death in 1243, and serving as secretary at the Synod of Harat Zuwayla in 1238 that sought to reform the patriarch’s simoniacal practices. What is best known about al-Safi is the course of his research in the 1230s and 1240s. Al-Safi excelled at making epitomes (mukhtasarat) of texts, editing them to a fraction of their original length while sacrificing little of their meaning (and sometimes, particularly in the case of treatises by Yahya ibn ‘Adi, making the meaning plainer!). His epitomes include works of monastic spirituality, exegetical homilies of St. John Chrysostom, works by Iraqi Arabophone (Arabic-speaking) theologians (including ‘Ammar al-Basri, Iliyya al-Nasibini, and especially Yahya ibn ‘Adi), and works by Muslim controversialists. The climax of al-Safi’s literary career consists of a set of about a dozen apologetic treatises, including responses to well-known mutakallimin such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi, al-Nashi’ al-Akbar, and ‘Ali al-Tabari. While these have not yet been adequately studied, indications are that al-Safi should be considered “the greatest Coptic apologist of the Middle Ages” (Samir, “Safi,” CE, p. 2079). AL-THIQA IBN AL-DUHAYRI (?–after 1267). Scholar of Coptic. Whether or not al-Thiqa ibn al-Duhayri is the Ibn al-Duhayri who was consecrated Metropolitan of Damietta with the name Christodoulos by Patriarch Cyril III ibn Laqlaq, he is remembered as a scholar who wrote a highly regarded Bohairic grammar, Muqaddimat al-Duhayri. Al-Thiqa sought to improve on the earlier grammars of Yuhanna, Bishop of Samannud, Ibn Katib Qaysar, and al-Wajih Yuhanna al-Qalyubi, refining Ibn Katib Qaysar’s threefold division of material into nouns, verbs, and particles, and adding many examples. Al-Thiqa corresponded with scholars such as al-Mu’taman\n\n26 •\n\nAL-TUKHI, RUFA’IL (1701–1787)\n\nibn al-‘Assal, whose Bohairic-Arabic lexicon he praised; his own grammar was judged to be “good” by Abu al-Barakat ibn Kabar, and by many others, to judge from the large number of manuscripts in which it is preserved. AL-TUKHI, RUFA’IL (1701–1787). Bishop, scholar. He was born in Gerga in Upper Egypt to a Coptic family. He converted to Catholicism in his early 20s and was sent to Rome, where he obtained a doctorate in theology in 1735. He was appointed a professor at the collegio and taught Coptic language and Church rites for more than 36 years. In Rome, he published a Coptic grammar and a number of Coptic liturgical books provided by an Arabic translation. Pope Clement XIII ordained him bishop in 1761. He was buried at the Vatican. AL-WADIH IBN RAJA’ (?–after 1009). Monk, apologist. The History of the Patriarchs devotes several pages to the story of al-Wadih, a Muslim who—through the witness of a martyr and the intervention of St. Mercurius—converted to Christianity and became a monk and priest. He became a friend of Sawirus ibn al-Muqaffa‘, with whom he is said to have spent considerable time in reflection and study. He wrote at least three Arabic-language apologetic/polemical works in which he drew on Islamic sources; unfortunately, these works remain almost entirely unknown. Like Sawirus, al-Wadih is one of the pioneers of Copto-Arabic literature, but an evaluation of his place in the history of this literature must await the publication of some of his work. AL-WAJIH YUHANNA AL-QALYUBI (?–after 1271). Biblical and Coptic scholar. Al-Wajih Yuhanna ibn Mikha’il ibn Sadaqa alQalyubi is a rather overlooked figure of the “golden age” of CoptoArabic literature, despite his connection to well-known scholars such as al-Mu’taman ibn al-‘Assal, and despite his extensive scholarly output, which includes a Coptic grammar, a careful new Arabic translation of the Pauline epistles, a commentary on Romans, and other works. His Bohairic Coptic grammar, entitled al-Kifaya (That Which Is Sufficient), breaks new ground in assimilating Arabic grammatical categories (with which the Coptic grammarians began) to the peculiar features of the Coptic language.\n\nANAPHORA OF ST. BASIL\n\n• 27\n\nAMOUN (?–ca. 350). Saint, ascetic. He is the founder of anchoritism in Nitria. Amoun was an Egyptian orphan who was brought up and forced to marry by his uncle. However, he and his wife lived celibately for 18 years. Around 330, Amoun retired to the mountain of Nitria. He soon attracted many followers and monasticism began to flourish there. One of the Sayings of the Fathers attributes the foundation of the monastic center of Kellia jointly to St. Amoun and St. Antony. Patriarch Athanasius mentioned him in the Life of Antony. According to one tradition, Antony saw Amoun’s soul borne up to heaven by angels. ANAPHORA OF ST. BASIL. The Anaphora of St. Basil is considered one of three official anaphoras of the Coptic Church. Pope Gabriel ibn Turayk (1131–1145) declared in his canons that only the liturgies of St. Basil, St. Gregory, and St. Cyril are to be used, and he forbade the Christian inhabitants of Upper Egypt from using their many anaphoras. There are four groups of this anaphora representing four geographical regions: Egypt, Syria, Armenia, and Byzantium. The Egyptian Anaphora of Basil, in contrast to the other three textual traditions, represents a substantially shorter version of the Basilian anaphora. The earliest manuscript of the Egyptian group is preserved on four small sheets of parchment written around the seventh century and discovered by Jean Doresse. It is written in the Sahidic dialect. Another fragment of the beginning of the anaphora was written on papyrus and discovered in the Monastery of alBali’zah. The Bohairic version survives in a rather large number of manuscripts, but they are mostly of a later date. The Greek version of the Egyptian form survives in a dozen manuscripts dated between the 14th and the 19th centuries. The first edition was published in Rome in 1636 and edited by Rufa’il (Rafael) al-Tukhi, but in all his editions, Tukhi did not respect the text of the original manuscripts. The best edition of the Anaphora of Basil was published by Claudius Labib and edited by Hegumen Abd al-Masih Salib al-Mas‘udi in 1908. It provided different readings in the apparatus according to the manuscripts. This edition was reprinted several times by Hegumen Attalah Arsenius al-Muharaqqi in 1956 by the Commission for Publication in Bani\n\n28 •\n\nANAPHORA OF ST. CYRIL\n\nSueif in 1986, and by Dayr al-Muharraq in 1997. Another edition was published by the Society of the Sons of the Church in 1945, mainly based on the Abd al-Masih’s edition with some additional hymns and the Horologion (a fixed schedule of daily prayers or services). The Mahabah Bookshop published several editions of the Euchologion in both Coptic and Arabic of the liturgies of Basil and Gregory. ANAPHORA OF ST. CYRIL. The Anaphora of St. Mark (Cyril) is notable for several features that are peculiar to it among Eastern liturgies, differentiating it from the Syro-Byzantine type. These features suggest that the structure of prayer is of considerable antiquity. These features are as follows: • The presence of an offering in the preface. • The position of the intercessions before the Sanctus. • The absence of the Benedictus and of any Christological thanksgiving. • The presence of an epiclesis immediately after the Sanctus with “fill” as a link word rather than “holy.” • The introduction of the anamnesis by “proclaiming” rather than “remembering.” • The inclusion of a second epiclesis. There are early Greek and Coptic versions of the Egyptian Liturgy of St. Cyril. The Ethiopian version of this liturgy was clearly developed at a later date. The earliest manuscripts of this liturgy are Greek fragments on papyrus. These fragments are preserved in the University of Strasbourg and probably date from the fourth century. The British Museum possesses small Greek fragments written in the sixth or seventh century containing part of the Liturgy of St. Mark. A Polish archaeological mission working in the Naqlun Monastery discovered several fragments of the deacon’s responses from the Liturgy of St Mark, which probably date from the 9th or 10th century. A Coptic parchment written around the 10th century contained a part of this liturgy. Unfortunately this important piece of history perished in a fire at Louvain University. The John Rylands Library in Manchester possesses a Greek parchment of the second half of the Anaphora of St. Mark. The British museum has a wooden tablet, crafted around the seventh or\n\nANATHEMA\n\n• 29\n\neighth century, on which a Sahidic Coptic text is engraved containing a quotation from this liturgy. In addition to these early sources, many Coptic medieval manuscripts survive from the complete text of the Liturgy of St. Mark. See the Anaphora of St. Basil for a review of the various editions. ANAPHORA OF ST. GREGORY. This anaphora belongs to the same Syrian type as the Anaphora of St. Basil. It is unique in that its prayers are directed to the Son and not to the Father through the Son, which indicates a sixth-century date. It seems that the Syrian monks who came to the desert of Scetis introduced this anaphora to the Coptic Church. Some Coptic Sahidic fragments, originally from Ashmunein, contain a few lines of the Liturgy of St. Gregory. The Sahidic Euchologion of the White Monastery contains two fragments of the Anaphora of St. Gregory. This manuscript may date from the 10th century. Some Bohairic fragments of the Anaphora of Gregory, originally from the Monastery of Saint Macarius, may date from the 12th or 13th century. They are now kept in the University and State Library of Hamburg. The first edition was published in Rome in 1636 and edited by Raphael al-Tukhi, but in all his editions, Tukhi did not respect the text of the original manuscripts. The first and the best edition of the Anaphora of Gregory was published by Claudius Labib. After consulting many manuscripts, Hegumen Abd al-Masih Salib al-Mas’udi edited a Euchologion in 1908 with alternate readings in the apparatus. This edition was reprinted several times by Hegumen Attalah Arsenius al-Muharaqqi after 1956, by the Monastery of al-Moharraq in 1997, and by the Bani Sueif Commission for Publications in 1986. Another edition was published by the Society of the Sons of the Church in 1945, mainly based on Abd al-Masih’s edition with some additional hymns and the Horologion. The Mahabah Bookshop published several editions of the Euchologion with the liturgies of Basil and Gregory in both Coptic and Arabic languages. ANATHEMA. This word occurs in the Greek New Testament in Romans 9:3 and I Corinthians 12:3. It means anything (or anyone) devoted to evil. Hence, it is considered a curse. The great curse of the\n\n30 •\n\nANBA RUWAIS\n\nCoptic Church is excommunicating a person or denouncing a doctrine or practice as damnable. This anathema is pronounced against heretics, usually by authority of a Church council. Anathemas are pronounced against those who insist on contradicting the dogma accepted by the council. Among the famous anathemas in the Church history were the Twelve Anathemas sent to Nestorius by St. Cyril and his synod. The last chapter of the Book of the Professions of the Fathers is a compilation of the anathemas of the Fathers of the Church, such as Gregory the Armenian, Hippolytus of Rome, Cyril of Alexandria, and Theodosius. ANBA RUWAIS. See CATHEDRAL OF ST. MARK IN CAIRO. ANIANUS (THE COBBLER). Patriarch. Tradition says that the Apostle Mark’s first convert in Alexandria was Anianus the cobbler. Mark later consecrated Anianus as the first bishop of the new church. Eusebius of Caesarea was the first author to mention the story of the succession of Mark in his book Church History. This tradition is developed in later sources such as the History of the Patriarchs and the Coptic Synaxarion to include many details. Unfortunately the entire Coptic version of the History of the Patriarchs did not survive; hence, we do not know exactly the origin of this story. Anianus is commemorated in the Coptic calendar on the 20th Hathor. According to Western tradition, the relics of Anianus were transferred to Venice in the 12th century. ANOINTING. See CHRISM; MARRIAGE; UNCTION OF THE SICK. ANTHROPOMORPHISM. The followers of Anthropomorphism believed that God has a human (Anthropos) form or shape (morphe). This affair arose in the late fourth century and the beginning of the fifth century in Egypt, during the patriarchate of Theophilus of Alexandria. The three tall monks of Nitria followed the allegorical interpretation of Origen. Theophilus first supported them. In his paschal letter of the year 399 a.d., he was inclined to adopt the incorporeity of God but later he changed his mind. In front of some monks who assembled in protest, he cried, “Looking at you, I see God’s face.” Theophilus then condemned Origenism and persecuted\n\nAPOCALYPSE OF ADAM (NHC V, 5)\n\n• 31\n\nthe followers of Origen. It should be mentioned that most of our knowledge of the reign of Theophilus of Alexandria came essentially from his opponents and especially Palladius (a close friend of John Chrysostom). However, monastic sources show him as a holy man and great champion of the monks. ANTIPHONARION. See DIFNAR. ANTONY (ca. 251–ca. 356). Saint, monk, ascetic. He is known as “the father of the monks.” He was born in an Egyptian village called Koma of the Heracleopolite nome in Middle Egypt. As a youth of about 18 years old, Antony heard in the church the Lord’s command: “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come to follow Me” (Matt. 19:21). Accordingly Antony sold his possessions, gave the money to the poor, and devoted himself to a life of asceticism. He began his ascetic life as a village ascetic, and around 285 he set out for the mountains and withdrew himself to Pispir, about 60 kilometers south of Cairo, where today stands the Monastery of al-Maimoun. By about 313 he had completely retired in the “inner desert” at the Red Sea, where he is said to have struggled with demonic powers. His commitment to God, seclusion, self-denial, and his readiness to be a spiritual guide for the monks made him a complete model for an anchoritic way of life. Antony went to Alexandria to strengthen the Christians who were imprisoned at the time of persecution. He supported Patriarch Athanasius in his struggle against the Arians. Toward the end of Antony’s life, the number of his disciples grew. They settled in the very region where today stands his famous monastery in Wadi Araba of the Red Sea. Athanasius, who knew Antony personally, wrote the Life of Antony shortly after Antony’s death. Its authenticity, which has sometimes been questioned, is now generally accepted by scholars. Athanasuis introduced the West to this ideal monk through his biography of the great hermit. It had a considerable impact on Christianity: It is sufficient to mention its influence on St. Augustine.
