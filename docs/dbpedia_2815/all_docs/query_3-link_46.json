The unusual, hook·shaped ground plan is determined by the lie of the land. The fortress fa(ls into two parts divided by a middle wall, of which the eastern part is reo garded as younger. Both parts have a gate opening on the intermediate slope. The buildings within consist in the western sec· tion predominantly of single-story, two-roomed houses, which are set into the mountainside one above the other. In the eastern section, building development is less dense and runs parallel to the course of the wall. The lower area accommodates several buildings with large rooms, among them a church, although only parts of the sanctuary remain. It consists of an apse with two rectangular side rooms, the spatial dimensions of which are similar to those of the Nubian churches of the tenth century from the Far· as region. Furthermore, remains of the gallery floor above the two side rooms have been preserved. One can only speculate about the date of the fortress. From the layout, it can hardly be dated to the late Roman period. The existence of a Christian church in it disproves an origin in the Islamic peri~ 00. There has been no lack of support for the at· tempt to set it in the period of the Nubian Christian occupation of Upper Egypt (Monneret de Villard, 1938, p. 124). In that case it would go back to the first half of the tenth century.\n\n,L\n\n,\n\n,,\n\n--------..,,\n\n,\n\n____ . . . __ J\n\n,\n\nL __ ..\n\n, -'\n\n,\n\n_.\n\nr----.J\n\n..\n\nc_ , ,,-\n\n,,\n\n.\n\n... .., -.\n\n... , •••\n\n..-,_., ,\n\n,\"\n\no •\n\n..._-.\n\n, ,\n\n..\n\n--,\n\n,• •\n\n.. •..•\n\n..• •,\n\n,\n\n... ,, .~---\n\n. ,\n\n-----\n\n--------\n\n- - - - - - - - - - ---- - - - --\n\n,\n\n---\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n... co, • I\n\n- -----\n\n---\n\n--\n\n---~\n\n--- . -- - --- - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nPlan of the church located in the lower area of the medieval fortress Qat'at al·Bcibayn.

The graves themselves were oblong earth pits, without any additional casing. The dead were as usual wrapped in shrouds, but had over the head a peculiar triangular headpiece made of wood or palm branch ribs, which served to protect the head and was incorporated into the wrappings. The grave offerings were poor, for the most part fabrics as well as wood and bone carvings. In the ground of the cemetery there are also the re· mains of a fairly large building, which has been described by the excavators as a monastery (Bilabel, 1924, p. 4). , BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBilabel, F.

RANDALL STEWART\n\nQAMULAH. See Pilgrimages.\n\nQARARAH, early Christian settlement on the east bank of the Nile, east of the modem railway station of Magharah (about 112 miles or 180 km south of Cairo). Apart from the remains of a few miserable houses (Ranke, 1926, p. 7, pI. 7), only the cemeteries have survived, and these afford information about an occupation extending from the fifth to the\n\nQA~R IBRIM, a fortified hilltop settlement in Lower Nubia, about 25 miles (40 km) to the north of the famous temples of Abu Simbel. A temple seems to have been built there in the Egyptian New Kingdom, and the place was intermittently occupied from that time until its final abandonment in 1811. The name appears in Meroitic texts as Pedeme; in classical texts variously as Pri lis, Premnis, and Prima; and in some Coptic text,,'> Phrim. Most Arabic sources give the name as Ibrim or Qal\"at IbIim. The forename Q~r is seldom encountered before the nineteenth century, although it has been regularly coupled to the name of the town in the recent past. Q~r Ibrim in the beginning seems to have been primarily a religious center. In addition to the New Kingdom temple (which may never have been tinished), the \"Ethiopian\" pharaoh Taharqa built a brick temple in the seventh century B.C. A more overt military and administrative role began when the Ptolemies occupied the place and built a massive girdle wall around it, probably around 100 B.C. They and their Roman successors apparently occupied the place for about two centuries, although a Meroitic invading force took temporary possession in 23 B.C\" as recounted by Strabo and Pliny. Around A.D. 100, Qa~r Ibrim was returned to the control of the Meroites, who restored the Taharqa temple and built another, larger one alongside it.\n\n!\n\nQA$R IBRlM\n\nQ~r\n\n[brim retained its strategic as well as its religious importance in the post-MeTailic period. It was seized for a time by the Blemmye nomads (see BElA TRIBES) who setded in the Nile Valley following the Meroitic collapse, and afterward by the Nobadae, who drove out the Blemmyes. Texts found at Q~r Ibtim suggest that this was the earliest residence of the kings of NOBATIA; laler they seem to have transferred their residence to FARAS. Early in the sixth century the Taharqa temple was made over into a church. This may well have been the earliesl church building in Nubia, for archaeological evidence suggests that its conversion preceded the \"official\" Christianization of Nohatia in 543, as related by John of Ephesus. Other parts of the Taharqa temple complex were apparently converted for a time into a monastery, but this was subsequently dismantled. A bishopric was established at Q\"'ir Ibtim in the seventh century, and shortly afterward an impressive stone cathedral was begun. A smaller church was built alongside the cathedral at a laler date. Meanwhile, most of the secular buildings at Qa~r lbrim seem to have been leveled, and the moun taintop became primarily a religious cenler in the early Middle Ages. Visitors' graffiti show that il was an important pilgrimage site, as it had been in Meroitic times. Nubia was invaded by an Ayyubid force under Shams al-Dawlah Turan Shah in 1172-1173, and the invaders temporarily seized Q~r (hrim and damaged the cathedral. This event marked a tum· ing point in the history both of the fortress and of Nubia. The town fonifications, which had been oe· glected, were now restored and heightened. Secular and commercial buildings began to appear again on the mountaintop alongside the churches. The eparch of Nobatia, who had formerly resided chiefly at Faras, transferred his main headquarters to Q~r lbtim in the twelfth century. Meanwhile, the religious importance of the place continued. A bishop of Faras and Q~r Ibrim was consecrated at aIFus!3! (modern-day Cairo) in 1372, and bishops of Q~r Ibrim are mentioned in a number of documents of still later dale. After the medieval Nubian kingdom of MAKOURJA collapsed. its power in Lower Nubia was assumed by the splinter kingdom of DOTAWO. The capital or principal royal seat of this principality seems to have been at JABAL 'ADD..\\.. but Q~r Ibtim was also an important center within the kingdom. Many of the surviving documents that relate to Lhe kingdom of Dotawo have been recovered from the excavaM\n\n2037\n\ntions at O\"'ir Ibtim. The latest of these bears the date 1464. Q\"'ir Ibtim may have been largely abandoned by the time the Ottomans took possession of Nubia early in the sixteenth century. They reoccupied and refortified the hilltop and made it ODe of their two principal control points within Nubia, the other being at SAl ISlAND. Part of Ihe old cathedral was turned inter a mosque, and the remainder of the structure was allowed to deteriorate. The original Ottoman garrison, according to local tradition, was of Bosnian origin, and as a result the latter-day inhabitants of Qa,,;r Ibtim were usually termed \"lIosnians\" both by Ihemselves and by their neighbors. They remained in occupation until driven out by Mamluk refugees in 1810. These in their turn were expelled by artillery fire in the following year, and the 3,OOO-year history of the fortress came to an end. Excavations in the Qa~T Ibrim fortress were begun in 1963 and have continued intermittently. The original fortress was perched so high above the Nile Valley floor that, unlike any other site in Lower Nubia, it has nol been fully inundated by Ihe walers of Lake Nasser. II is now a small island, about 5 acres (2 hectares) in extent, projecting above the lake surface. Some of the finds from O\"'ir Ibrim, particularly the textual finds, are of outstanding historical importance. They include letters relating to the BAOT treaty, to the commercial relations of the' parchs of Nobatia, and to Ihe late medieval kin~m of Dotawo. Also imponant a...e the intact consecration scrolls of Bishop Timotheus, one in Coptic and one in Arabic, dated 1372. [See also: Nubian Church Organizalion.]\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAdams, W. Y.

About 5.5 miles (9 km) south of Khargah, Nisimah is a tiny square site 164 x 164 feet (SO x SO m), perched on a till of low elevation in the middle of a small cultivated plain. In addition to a small fort (q~r) built on a base of stones and ordinary clay mortar SO x 32 feet (15 x 10 m; maximum extant height 24 feet or 7.5 m) and a magnificent well·preserved columbariurn, one may see the leveled down remains of a smaU church oriented from west to east (choir rounded to the east). The entrance door is in the north side wall. In the nave, along the north side, are two median columns of octagonal sections that perhaps had matching columns along the south side. This church of small dimensions 32 x 23 feet (9.5 x 7 m) is entirely comparable to that of SHAMS\n\n•\n\nwest side of the Nile about 4 miles (6 km) southwest of Bani Mazar in Minya Province. In Greek it was called Kynopolis ano (Upper Kynopolis). The SYNAXARlON commemorates the martyrdom of Bisadah (Psoi) from al-Oays on 24 Tubah. Records indicate that the city was a bishopric in the Middle Ages. A bishop Maqarah of al-Oays attended a synod held in Cairo in 1078, and a bishop Bu!rus from the city was present at the preparation of the holy CHRISM in 1299 (Munier, 1943, pp. 27, 36).

In time O~r ai-Sham' came to designate a whole quarter of Old Cairo inhabited mainly by Copts. Four Coptic churches are still to be found in that part of Cairo: Church of al-Mu'allaqah. Church of Abu Sarjah (Saint Sergius), Church of Sitt Barb~rah (Saint Barbara), and Church of M~r Jirjis (Saint George). A fifth church, known as O~riyyat alRlh~n (Church of Our Lady), burned down in 1979. •\n\nQIFT (Coptos), city on the east bank of the Nile, about 25 miles (40 km) northwest of Luxor. It was already of some significance early on as the exit point of the desert routes to the Red Sea and to the quarries in the desert area. In the third century A.D. during the Palmyrene rebellion, the city fell into the hands of the Blemmyes and because of renewed resistance was besieged and destroyed by the emperor DlOCLETIAN in 292. However, the city soon recovered, although at first cities like Ou~ and Oina tried to take its place. Under JUSTINIAN. for a short time, it was called Justinianopolis (Kees, 1922, col. 1368), which may suggest the existence of a Chalcedanian community in the city.

A bishop PHOIBAMMON from Coptos took part in the Council of EPHESUS in 431 (Munier, 1943, p. 14). Of Christian buildings within the area of the old city, only slight traces of a church have been found, but all the same it was a structure of large propor-\n\nlions. Contrary to nannal tradition the basilica was oriented northwestward instead of northeastward, the width of the nave being roughly 31 feel (9.5 m). The sanctuary consisted of three rectangular rooms. Apparently because of the absence of an apse, the building was not recognized as a church by Reinach (1910, p. 39). The central main room that\n\n• \"\n\n2040\n\nQINA.\n\n.'\n\n•\n\n,\n\ni\n\n,• ,\n\nhere took the place of the apse was connected with the eastern side room by a large opening in the wall. ]n front of the entrance to this main room, a crypt constructed of fired bricks was found under the floor. The baptistery was accommodated in an annex on the east side of the basilica. It contained an extraordinarily large octagonal pool with steps leading down into it on fouf sides-a rare feature in Egypt. In addition it was surrounded by a massive ciborium supported on fOUf large octagonal granite columns. The axle width of the columns amounted to 23 feet (7 m). The church was constructed largely of spoil material from demolished pagan temples. Consequently it goes back at the earliest to the fifth century. To judge by the capitals used in the ciborium, the baptistery was actually constructed in the sixth century. Remains of a small, somewhat oJder building were found under the western section of the basilica. This also appears to have a northward orientation but only its apse has survived.

Winlock notes it in making his inventory of the monastic sites of the region (Winlock and Crum, Vol. I, p. 15). U. Monneret de Villard believed he had found a church there with a plan approximating the churches of Georgia (pp. 495-500). The French Institute, which has the concession in this sector, excavated this site from 1971 to 1975, and reaped an abundant harvest of ostraea (2,000) and fragments of pottery, with and without decoration (more than 400 decorated pots that have been reassembled), but the results of this excavation have not yet been published. Only the general plan and a study of the mummies exhumed have been published (Castel, Vol. 2, pp. 121-43). The site was called the topos of Saint Mark the Evangelist. The term tapas (\"place\" in Greek) indicates that this was not a true monastery (besides, there is no surrounding wall) but the center where each week, on Saturday and Sunday, hermits living in the eaves or tombs of the neighborhood gathered together. This tapas was already known from the documents of the region (see Winlock and Crum, VoL I, p. 108), but its precise position was not known. Its superior, Mark, was a priest who wrote\n\nvarious documents (Winlock and Crum, VoL I, p. 223). The plan published by Castel reveals a church and some adjoining rooms that are insufficient to constitute a true cenobium. Qumat Mar'i appears to have come to an end when the Muslim troops arrived, for the written documents do not show any Arab name. Perhaps it disappeared at the time of the Persian invasion (619-629), for a mummy of a monk shows that he died a violent death. BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nCastel.

A narrow strip of desert separates it from the cultivated areas. The monastery is built on the northeast part of the hill, near the summit. It is oriented northeast/southwe , and with its terraces covers an area of about IS yards (14m) on each side. Its archaeological material dates it to the sixth and seventh centuries. In its present form the monastery is composed of two buildings of mud brick. The main building, to the north and situated near the summit, occupies a natural terrace. Enclosed by high walls, it consists of communal rooms: in the center, the church with an apse; to the south, the refectory with two storage jars for water; to the west, a workroom with three loom pits; to the north, utility rooms and storage chambers. In the northwest corner of the building, an ancient pharaonic tomb drives into the rock. A small oratory is near the entrance to the tomb, and granaries occupy its lower part. The other building, south of the main building, includes three cells and a kitchen backing against the rock. These open directly on the access path to the monastery. These two buildings are separated by a passage. A spacious artificial platform to the east of the church was the monks' cemetery. Immediately south of the cells, on a lower level, two pharaonic tombs contained some materials dating from the period of the monastery. They were inhabited bX monks of the small community. The pharaonic tomb and its court are the oldest part of the monastery. They were occupied by an anchorite, who left some graffiti in them. Then a chapel and communal buildings were built at the entrance to the tomb, in memory of this hennit. These structures underwent numerous alterations and extensions before acquiring their present appearance. The phases of construction may be summarized thus:\n\nThe small size of the communal buildings, the few cells (fewer than six with the two neighboring pharaonic tombs), the arrangements for work (six looms in all), and the graves in the cemetery (five or six) indicate that even in its best days the community was one of five or six monks only. The numerous texts gathered up (about 1,400 Coptic ostraca and one in Greek) allow some insight into aspects of the daily life of this small community: weaving and trade in wine, for instance. The figure of Apa Markos, HEGUMENOS of the monastery, emerges from these letters. The pottery (thousands of potsherds as well as 100 complete amphorae and remains of nearly 2,000 broken amphorae) includes a number of unpainted objects of various shapes: dishes, plates, cups, \"pseudo-sigillate\" bowls, kitchen ware, ovens, amphorae, water jars, basins, vats and mud bins. There is also another group consisting of a series of items with geometrical designs: vegetable or animal decoration. These are applied in either one or more colors, black or white on a red base, or in black or red on a lighter base (unpublished notes by Mme C. Neyret). All these elements show that the monastery of Mark the Evangelist had several stages of development:\n\nI\n\n1. a stage intennediate between the period of absolute independence for the hermits and the period of strict organization with clearly defined community rules, characterized by a series of cells or lauras scattered around the cell of a hennit of renown who had attracted monks and become their head; 2. a stage of organized community life within an enclosed space; 3. a stage at which the monastery was no longer occupied by monks and had become a place of pilgrimage.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\n1. tomb and its court 2. first and second churches 3. rooms on the north, with kitchen on the outside of the monastery, to the northeast; 4. rooms on the south and west, with new kitchen to the southeast; S. cells to the south of the main building, then eastern platfonn converted into a cemetery;\n\nBonomi, J. \"Topographical Notes on Western Thebes Collected in 1830.\" Annales du Service des antiquites de l'Egypte 7 (1906):82, no. 42.

From the Greek period onward (third century B.C.) it was known as Apollinopolis Parva. It evolved by taking advantage of the activities of QIFf. which the Greek kings had made the star1ing point for roads linking the Nile Valley and the ports on the Red Sea. But above all it was at that time a port on the Nile where the agricultural products of its environment were loaded. From the end of the third century A.D., its official name was changed to Diocietianopolis. No date can be fixed as regards the beginning of Christianity there. The SYNAXARION for 7 Tlit commemorates a family of six, martyred at Alexandria but coming from the neighborhood of the town, where they confessed their faith and because of them a crowd of people believed. It was the seat of a bishop at least from the fifth century. In about the sixth century, the city was called by its current name, Qu~. The ARAB CONQUEST OF EGYPT does not seem to have involved the settlement of a numerous Muslim community. Soon to be more important than Oift, which remained the administrative capital, Oli!;, which had basically a Christian population, no longer had any official role. When the Fatimids had established their power in Egypt, one of their first concerns was to attract again, by way of the Nile, the major trade of the Indian Ocean toward the Mediterranean; they hoped to divert this commerce from the routes it was then using through Abbasid territory. The Red Sea ports were again employed. 'Aydhab, situated at the outlet of the region of the gold mines in the Wadi al-'Allaqi, south of Aswan. became a busy anchorage. All the towns of Upper Egypt, and QIi~ in particular, found new prosperity. With the serious crises of the caliphate after 1067, the town was called upon to play a special\n\n2043\n\nrole. The southern part of the Upper ~'ld-and above all the Aswan region, toward which the caliph's black troops retreated when they were expelled from Cairo-was for nearly a decade iIlcontrolled by the authorities. The turbulence of the Arab tribes, which had abandoned their obedience to the caliph, also increased the insecurity. The Oli~ region seems to have been less troubled. It was thus natural that the 'Aydhab caravan route, which until then had joined the Nile at Aswan, was diverted to Qii~. The superior officer entrusted with the maintenance of order in the Upper ~a~id established himself at Oli~ during the last quarter of the eleventh century. The town then became the ad~inis­ trative center of the entire Upper ~a·id. A mint was established there in .1122, and in the second century of Fatimid rule, the military forces at the disposal of the governors of Upper ~'ld made Oli!; into the most important station after the vizierate, a p0sition that conferred de facto mastery of the Fatimid state. It is probable that the Shi'ite caliphate had more readily chosen QIi~ as the new capital of Upper l?a'id because the Muslims (among whom Sunnism was still the majority faith) were small in number and the greater part of the population was Christian. If the development of trading activities, which periodically enlivened the town during the commercial season, contributed to the enrichment of the Christian community, the benefits for its services to the Fatimid authorities gave the Christian community its strength. It was probably during this period that the dozen churches of 0Ii!; and its environs were built or rebuilt. These are listed in the description of the churches of Egypt that was compiled under the Ayyubids at the beginning of the thirteenth century. There Q~ is not separated from what is then called \"the west of Oli~:' that is, the part on the west (oPl'osite) bank of the Nile between Naqadah and Oamulah, and it seems that' the preparation of the last recension of the SYNAXARION of Upper Egypt was made in one of the monasteries to the west of Qa~ in the twelfth century or at the beginning of the thirteenth. The Christian community of Oii~ must have seen its riches and power grow. We may suppose that Christian families from other centers in the valley came to swell their ranks. From the end of the eleventh century, the bishop of Oli!; made efforts to have it accepted that in the church he had prece· dence over the other bishops in the region. When subsequently around 1160, Shawar, the Muslim governor of the town, proposed to seize the vizierate by force, he thought it wise to conciliate the local\n\n2044\n\nQO~\n\nChristian community by making a vow to Saint\n\n,•\n\nI\n\n~i\n\n••\n\nr\n\nGeorge in his church of .'-'Abbasah at the gates of the town. Yaqut, who pr~ed his dictionary between 1215 and 1224, stated after spelling the name of the town, \"it is a Coptic town.\" However, one could foresee that this situation would not last. A consequence of the choice of Qii~ as a regional center was the establishment in the town of a qac;li (magistrate) of the Upper ~a'id. And the advancement of Ql1~ had also attracted many Muslim families, some very wealthy, who had left localities like Aswan or Isml to come and live there. The arrival of these Muslims also contributed to urban development. As was often the case at that period, the town must have had a somewhat casual and disorganized appearance due to built-up agglomerations-doubtless in part along the access roads-scattered around the old Christian center, which officially continued to be known as \"the town.\" Significantly, the qac;li lived \"outside the town.\" The basic activities relating to the handling of goods arriving by road and leaving by the Nile also took place \"outside the town.\" The residence of the governors must have been on the outskirts of \"the town,\" not far from the limit al-tAmri; it faced on a maydan (hippodrome or parade ground for the cavalry ganison), a feature characteristic of an age in which a foreign military unit of horse troops (increasingly of Turkish origin, and increasingly more dominant) put its stamp on the urban Jandscape. The presence of these representatives of the Muslim state also favored Islamization. The governors of the Ayyubid period increasingly surrounded themselves with educated Muslims, especially poets. Their official productions, being well received, could only strengthen the hitherto perhaps imperfect Arabic of the population and reinforce the power of attraction of the Muslim environment. Conversions to Islam took place. Moreover, Qii~ was not just an important spot on the main Indian Ocean trade route but also a staging-post on the way now favored by Muslim pilgrims to the J:lijaz who wished to avoid the Crusaders' tenitories established in Palestine at the end of the eleventh century. Until the reconquest of Jerusalem by $Alal) ai-Din a century later, there was no other route, and consequently pilgrims made use of it for a long time thereafter. Some of them, especially the Maghribins (those from North Africa), having gone through the town, returned to settle there. Thus gradually a coherent Muslim environment came into being. fn 1210 Q(i~ had its first madrasah (Islamic college). One can well imagine that during the second half of the century, under\n\nthe first Mamluks, the Christian community ceased to be dominant, if not numerically then at least socially. In a town of indefinite limits. straggling between gardens, the old Christian center around the Church of Saint Stephen was for the Muslims of Q~ just the \"J:larat al-N~.\" (The term ~iirah seems to have meant a distinct center of population but not a closed quarter, i.e., one of several similar sections of the agglomeration.) The two communities in the town, one expanding and the other on the defensive, came into confrontation toward the end of the thirteenth and beginning of the fourteenth century. The situation especially lent itself to confrontation at Qii~. though it cannot be separated from the more general Egyptian context. At Q~, as elsewhere, the dominant military class. that is, the sultan and the amirs, employed Christian secretaries who worked in the service of the diwan and saw to the collection of the fiscal revenues. Some elements of the taxes (e.g., those collected by the sultan himself in the whole of the northwestern part of the province of Qu~) were levied on a peasantry that was still in large measure Christian. In others, many conversions to Islam had occurred, and the Christian sec· retaries found themselves in a delicate situation when they had to show strictness against Muslims. The town Muslims in particular accused them of showing bias in the exercise of their office, especialJy since some of the Christian secretaries reached high financial positions in the capital, from which they could intervene. The Muslim community, however, was also represented at Cairo, where from 1295 to 1302 a Muslim from Qli~ look on the responsibilities of the Grand Qa41. Consequently, local incidents were magnified in both direclions as a result of external pressures. Often the Christian sec· retaries, backed by the Mamluk authorities (and therefore implicated with them), won the day. Toward the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the fourteenth century, during the period between the two great sultanates of Qaliwiin and al·N~ir Mul:tammad, and perhaps because power was so bitterly disputed among the amirs, the Muslim civil population became mOTe insistent on exacting from the sultans and am irs a minimal favor from the Christian secretaries, namely, their forced conversion, and, by extension. stricter respect for the laws of Islam in an Islamic state. This was a show of opposition to the Mamluk authorities, who were ill tolerated, and a genuine religious demand. In 1300 most of the churches in Egypt had been closed for a year. It seems that the Christian community of Qii~ resolved to resist, gradually reopen-\n\n2045\n\n/ ing the church!.. when it was possible to do so, sometimes with unwise demonstrations. They affirmed their exclusive presence in those parts of the city that they occupied, particularly in the Christian sector. To do this it was necessary on occasion to remove the Muslim places of worship that had been built among Christian dwellings. In 1307 an opera· tion of this kind engendered a violent reaction from the Muslim population; thirteen Christian places of worship were attacked and destroyed in a single morning. The repressive action taken by the MamJuk authorities was severe, and similar events did not recur till the great crisis of 1321, which went beyond the town of QU~ in its scope. Then six churches were again devastated, which indicates that in the interval at least a partial reconstruction had taken place. No later incidents are known. In fact. the general administrative development of the Muslim state under ai-Malik al-Na~ir Mul:tammad does not seem to have lessened the role of the Christian, or superficially converted, secretaries in the state. Quite the contrary. This is doubtless the period when Athanasius of Qu~ referred to the igno~ rance of his coreligionists of their own language, and drew up in Arabic his grammar of the Coptic language. This is an indication of a decline in the knowledge of Coptic; it is also a sign that the Christians nevertheless had a place in the administrative structures of the Arab-Muslim state. At Q~ the destructive acts of 1307 and 1321 doubtless damaged the integrity of the Christian community, but they did not succeed in turning it into Muslim territory, which appears to have been one of the purposes for destroying churches. As to violence, which in general tenns was hard on the Christians, we cannot say how the relationship between the two communities would have developed in the second part of the century had Q~ remained a center of attraction for the Muslims of Upper Egypt. In fact, the position of Qu~ gradually changed during the second half of the fourteenth century, as the town was no longer the most suitable spot in the upper valley to station troops for the maintenance of order (and in particular to control the bedouin tribesmen). The center of control, whatever kind it might be, now had to be located in the north at Asyii! or, later, at Jilja, because of the establishment of routes from the West to Sudanese Africa and of the disequilibrium this had caused in the bedouin world. This disturbance of the equilibrium, moreover, in part occasioned the disorders of 1365-1366 in the eastern desert and the closure of the 'Aydhab route. Gradually after that date, and after a serious\n\ndrought suffered by the town and its region in 13741375, the spice trade ceased to pass through Qu~. The plague of 1405-1406, which, according to a1MAQRlzl. claimed 17,000 victims at Qu~, doubtless cleared out a good part of its population, and there was no longer anything to encourage people to come and settle. The governor of Q~ was of only secondary importance under the Circassian Mamluks. As the structures of the Muslim state no longer operated to the advantage of the town, the Muslim community was affected by departures or by the absence of new settlements to fill the gaps made by the epidemics. Symbolic of this eclipse was the transfer of the q{u!i to Qiml after the Ottoman occupation. The importance of the Christian community, therefqre, began to increase in the town. This increase owed less to the exercise of fiscal service that governmental prohibitions sometimes called in question against the Christians than to the traditional activities of Q1i~, particularly tex· tile craftsmanship and the export of its products to the upper valley of the Nile and probably to Ethiopia. We may suppose that relations between the Christian community of Q1i~ and the Christians of Ethiopia, who were at the time feared by the Mamluk state, were not purely commercial. In 1430 a governor of Qii~ left to take service with the negus. When the dilapidated urban environs of the medieval period gradually fell into ruins, and especially in the seventeenth century, it was initially the peripheral Muslim part of the town that was affected. The Christian center around the Church of Saint Stephen, even if penetrated little by lillie by the Muslims, survived. At the time of the French expedition at the end of the eighteenth century, in a town of less than 5,000 inhabitants, the proportion of Christians appeared to be significant. The proportion declined during the nineteenth century, when Q1i~ again saw its population growing because of the rural exodus from the Islamized parts of the countryside. Some Coptic Christians became Protestants. Modern education made it possible for many to leave OU~. But the situation of the Christian community of QU~, which is no longer capital of the Upper ()a'jd, no longer diliers in any way from that of the other Christians of Upper Egypt.

JEAN-CLAUDE GARCtN\n\nQUSTANTIN IBN ABI AL·MA'ALI IBN ABf AL.PATI:I ABU AL·FATI:I, fourteenthcentury Melchite of Cairo who belonged to a family of important state officials. Qus!an!in must have been born around 1270, as his son was already a bishop in 1358. He knew Greek extremely well and had a fine Arabic style. He composed at least two works, both liturgical. Near the end of his life he withdrew to the Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai. This summary of information about him derives from an autograph manuscript dated 1335 (Sinai Arabic 264, containing 206 sheets, not yet published or studied). The first of his works, Kitab al-Hadl fl Ma'rifat al-Samadl, appears not to have survived, though it is mentioned by the author in the second colophon of his Typikon (fol. 204b) , which shows that it was composed prior to 1355. Speaking of John of Damascus he says, \"For, during the vizierate of his father, at the time of the King Heraclius, Damascus was taken from the Greeks in the year 6148 of the world. Now this saint succeeded his father as vizier, as I explained in the book I composed and entitled, AI-Hadl fl Ma'rifat al-Samadl in the chapter of the cheironomia. \" The last word of the title poses a problem, since the meaning of the word al-samadl is not clear. For that reason, A. S. Atiya and J. N. Youssef (p. 492) read it al-samawl, the heavenly. They have been followed by J. Nasrallah (1981, p. 150). But there is no doubt that it must be read al-samadl, for two reasons: first, because of the very clear handwriting of the autograph; and second because of the rhyme with al-Radl, which is an essential element in old Arabic titles. Quslan!in agreed to translate the Typikon of Saint Sabas into Arabic at the request of one who \"loved virtue.\" The Typikon is the manual giving disposi-\n\ntions for all the liturgical ceremonies, especially the recitation of the divine office; the Typikon of Saint Sabas was used in the Arabic East, and was composed by Saint John of Damascus. Qus!an!in completed his translation on Tuesday, 5 December 6844 of the world/5 December A.D. 1355 (fol. 203a). The Greek manuscript that served as a basis for Qus!an!in's translation was copied by Hesychius, monk of Saint Sabas. He completed his copy on Monday, 20 April 1187. On two occasions (fols. 197a and 204b), Qus!an!in states that this manuscript may have been copied from the original copy of John of Damascus. This Greek manuscript bore an act of bequest in favor of the mon,astery of Saint Sabas. Nevertheless, in 1355, it was in Cairo, in the Greek quarter (HARIT AL-RUM), in the Church of the Forty Martyrs (fol. 204b). It was there that Qus!an!in translated it. Shortly afterward, Quslan!in donated his translation to his own son, Marqu~, the Melchite bishop of Damietta, for his use during his lifetime, on condition that it should subsequently be bequeathed to the Monastery of Saint Catherine on Mount Sinai. The act of donation is dated Wednesday, 28 February 1358. It is remarkable that Marqu~ wrote the date in Coptic cursive figures. The manuscript found its way to Sinai shortly afterward, as is indicated in a note written by the bishop of Sinai, who was also called Marqu~ and who was probably the same one mentioned in the Sinai Arabic 90. It should be noted that the bishop of Damietta speaks of his father as \"the lord [my] father,\" which suggests a man who was highly respected socially. After this date, Qus!aD!in entered the Monastery of Saint Catherine, as his wife had died and his children were already independent. He wore the monastic habit and took the name An!uniyiis, as is indicated in a later note added in the margin of the colophon (fol. 203b). The manuscript contains 206 sheets, but folios 205-206, which were blank, were filled by two different hands that can be dated as the end of the fourteenth century, probably on Mount Sinai. The other folios contain the following: Fols. Ib-2b: translator's preface in fine rhymed prose Fols. 2b-6b: translation of the Agrypniai, or night vigils preceding solemn feasts Fols. 6b-2Ia: translation of the Ordo of Matins Fols. 2Ia-135a: translation of the ordinary of the whole year, from September to August\n\nQUSTANTIN IBN ABI AL-MA'ALi IBN ABI AL-FATH ABU AL-FATH • • • •\n\nFols. 135b-97a: translation of the periods of Lent, Easter, and Pentecost Fols. 197b-99a: translator's note explaining that this is the office of monks, and indicating how this office should be adapted for lay people Fols. 199a-203a: Six translator's notes on certain feasts, namely the Exaltation of the Cross, the Vigil of Christmas, the Vigil of the Epiphany, the Lent of the Apostles, Holy Week, and the Washing of Feet Fols. 203a-203b: first colophon Fols. 203b-204a: two notes concerning the elev· en days on which the Liturgy of Saint Basil IS celebrated, and Dissidents' Week Fol. 204b: second colophon. The sections composed by Qus!antin are written in an elevated style, in fine rhymed prose. Occasionally the author has employed tenns so rare that readers have added explanations in the margin. Apart from the autograph manuscript, another manuscript exists (Mar Elias Shuwayya, 30). This was copied by the deacon Saba ibn Tadurus aIl;Iawrani at the Monastery of Saint John the Baptist at Diima (Lebanon) between 4 June 1594 and 16 March 1595. However, Qustantin's name has been omitted, and this caused Nasrallah to think that the translation was the work of the deacon Saba. He has recently corrected this error (Na,,;rallah, 1981, p. 149, n. 195).\n\n2047\n\nWhat is more, in the preface the copyist added an interpolation to the effect that Patriarch Gregory the Sinaite had translated the Agrypniai into Arabic. Since he speaks of the \"deceased patriarch,\" Nasrallah deduced that Gregory the Sinaite, who became Melchite patriarch of Alexandria, died before 1355, the date of composition of the preface (Nasrallah, 1981, p. 149). The truth of the matter is that the two lines on Patriarch Gregory are an addition on the part of Saba ibn TaduIUs; moreover, they interrupt the sentence and spoil the rhyme. Thus Gregory died before 1594 and not before 1355. According to Nasrallah (1963, p. 167), the end is missing in this manuscript. It lacks the translation of the periods of Easter and Pentecost and the explanations and notes.composed by Qustantin. BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nArranz, M., S.J.

See Papyrus Collections. RAITHOU (al-Rayah), ancient town, which has disappeared, 5 miles (8 km) south of aI-Tiir, a small town on the west coast of the southern Sinai Penin· sula. The information collected Ihere by Porphyry Ouspensky in 1850 places al-Rayah, or at least its ruins, on the edge of the sea, two hours' march south of al-Tiir (see also Maspero and Wiet, 1919, pp. 98-99). In the neighborhood of this town several sites were inhabited by anchorites or cenobites. It can· not be stated with any precision at what date the first ascetics established themselves there. The APOPHTHEGMATA PATRUM mentions Raithou several times, but this collection brings together pieces of very diverse origin and period, which therefore are difficult to date. Similarly, there are no certain documents for fixing the date of the martyrdom of the forty monks at Raithou, perhaps fourth or fifth century, massacred by Blemmyes or Agarenes (Devreesse, 1940, pp. 216-21). Although il is very probable that Sinai was inhabited by monks from the fourth century on, the sources do not confirm their presence at Raithou before the beginning of the fifth century. Amun of Raithou paid a visit to Sisoes at Clysma (Apophthegmata patrum, Sisoes 26); Sisoes did not install himself there before 429 (Chitty, 1966, p. 79, n. 83). Three anchorites from Raithou came before 428 to join Euthymius in his laura near Jerusalem (Festugiere, 1962, p. 79). A solitary from Raithou named Zosimus became the disciple of Peter the Iberian (c. 409-489) toward the middle of the fifth century.

Ammonius notes that at Raithou only one of the hennits \"who lived separately in caves\" was a Roman, which, Tillemont (1732) remarks, leads one to think that the others were autochthonous. We know that at the Council of CONSTANTINOPLE in 536 a monk-priest named Theonas represented not only the mountain of Sinai but also the \"laura\" (some manuscripts say the desert) of Raithou (Schwartz, Vol. 3, pp. 37, 51, 130; see the index); Eutychius (Sa'jd ibn Balriq) states that a delegation of monks from Sinai asked Emperor JUSTINIAN (527-565) to build monasteries to protect them against the raids of the Blemmyes and the Arabs. The text states that a monastery was built at Rayah (Vol. 2, pp. 20203). It is known that the monastery of the Virgin in Sinai was completed in 556 (Stein, Vol. 2, p. 300). The Nestorian traveler known as COSMAS INDICOPLEUSTES, whose report was written between 547 and 549, speaks of the monastery of Raithou, where Menas, one of his traveling companions, became a monk. He identifies Raithou with the biblical Elim, where twelve springs flowed. John Climacus (c. 570-649) wrote his famous Ladder of Divine Ascent at the request of John, HEGUMENOS of Raithou, with whom he exchanged letters. This was perhaps the same man who is called John the Cilician in the Pratum spirituale of John Moschus (c. 550-619). The last source men· tions three anchorites at Raithou. It was also a monk of Raithou, named Daniel, who wrote the life of John Climacus. Apart from two rather vague references to the monk Epiphanius (perhaps in the ninth century) and to Daniel of Ephesus (in the fifteenth century), we find no further reference to monks at Raithou until the travelers of the sixteenth century. The first sixteenth·centmy mention of a monastery in this' part of the Sinai Peninsula is by Jean Thenaud in 1512 (p. 81). He notes that there is no potable water at aI-TOr; one must seek it \"half a French league from there, near the sumptuous ruined monastery which Justinian once had built, the abbot of which was Saint John, to whom John Climacus addressed his book on the spiritual life (The Ladder of Paradise).\" He, too, associates Raithou with the twelve springs of Elim. In 1588, the Russian merchant Basil Posniakoff wrote of the \"monastery of Saint John of Raithou, ruined from top to bottom by the accursed Turks,\"\n\nat \"three versts [a little more than 2 miles/3 km] from ai-Fir\" (Volkoff, p. 28). Claude SICARD visited the site in 1720, but says very little about it; the monastery is that of John of Raithou, friend of John Climacus, and there are still gardens and caves in good condition. On his map of 1722 he places the monastery a little to the north of the well of sweet water and of Elim. The archimandrite Ouspensky noted in 1850 that the monastery dedicated to Saint John the Baptist and founded by Justinian had been destroyed by al-l;Iakim at the beginning of the eleventh century and had become the cemetery for the Christians of aI-TOr. It is remarkable that all the Russian travel• ers designate the town of aI-TOr by the name of Raithou. Ouspensky notes that the ancient Raithou was at the place today called Rayah, and that ruins are still visible: a fortress and a well of sweet water. He adds that near the Jabal J:lammam Sidna Musa, three and a half hours' march northwest of al-Tur, there are hermitages and a church fitted up in caves. He thus clearly distinguishes the cenobium of Justinian to the northeast and the hermitages near the sea to the northwest. The latter, of a type common in Egypt, are well described by Wellsted (1838, Vol. 2, pp. 15-19), at a place called ai-Wadi. BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nChitty, D. J. The Desert a City. London, 1966.

Born in the small town of Quakenbrock in Westphalia, he studied theology in the Lutheran tradition and read widely the travel works on Egypt, particularly the writings of the Jesuit Ath· anasius KIRCHER, whose experiences among the Copts must have influenced him greatly in his studies. He wrote and published a comprehensive doctoral thesis on the Copts and submitted it to the University of lena in the year 1666. Written in Latin, his own work has the composite title of T6KK>.HCU. \"K6\";- (tekklesia Nkefti) sive Exereitatio\n\nTheologica, Ecclesia Copticae, Hoc Est Christianorurn Aegyptiacae Ortum, Progressum Praecipuaque Doetrinae. . .. The book has been described by W. Kammerer in A Coptic Bibliography (1950, 1969) as \"probably the oldest European work on the Copts,\" a verdict confirmed by A. Mallon in his renowned Grammaire caple. Von Ramshausen's approach to the subject is systematic, original, and thorough. Starting with the definition of the word \"Copt,\" he discussed the Coptic language in its hieroglyphic background. Then he discussed the Coptic Bibles and other Cop' tic manuscripts available at his time. Next, he dealt with the history of the Coptic church and Coptic persecutions and heresies in Egypt, extending his panoramic view of Coptic Egypt beyond the sixth century. Coptic dogmas, sacraments, and rituals are also treated at a time when the West was oblivious of that nation in the framework of Eastern Christianity. In this way. von Ramshausen laid a solid basis for the study of the Coptic language and Coptic church history for subsequent generations of scholars in the West. He drew attention to the antiquity of the Coptic church fathers and to the establishment of the Coptic church by Saint MARK, its first patriarch. He was outspoken in his sympathy for the ancient church. He appears to have had access to historical material no longer available, which enhances the value of his writing. The genuine contribution of von Ramshausen's work is his objectivity in dealing with the Coptic church, which makes it overshadow subsequent works by even so great a scholar as Renaudot, whose Liturgiarum Orientalium Collectio (1716) was apparently more critical and unsympathetic than his predecessor's. This alone entitles von Ramshausen to a place in the story of Coptology.

The Hebrew word repha'el can mean \"God has healed.\" Latin authors such as Gregory the Great (Evangelia Homiliarum 34.9) interpreted the name as \"medicine of God.\" In a Coptic text (Kropp, 1930, Vol. 2, p. 165) it has the meaning of \"cure.\" The archangel Raphael appears for the first time in Tobit (3rd century B.C.), written by a Jew of the Diaspora, probably in Egypt. Here Raphael introduces himself as one of the seven angels who present the prayers of the just to God and who stand in the presence of God (Tb. 12:15). Hence the many guises under which he helps men. Under the symbolic name of Azarias (\"the Lord helps\"), he accompanies the young Tobias, son of Tobit, on his journey to Raguel of Medes in Ecbatana, where Tobias meets Sarah (Tb. 5:13;7:7). On the way to Raguel, Raphael frees Tobias from a monstrous fish that attacks him as he is bathing in the river Tigris (6:1-3); he later saves Sarah and Tobias from the snares of the devil Asmodeus, who has killed Sarah's previous seven husbands (6:14;8:3). Finally,\n\n•\n\nRAPHAEL\n\nas the etymology of his name i.ndicates, he cures the blindness of Tobit. the father of Tobias (11:714). In 1 Enoch, Raphael is one of the four archangels, together with MtCHAEL, Suriel (or Uriel), and GABR'U (1 En. 9.1; 10.4-8), or as one of the seven (I En. 20.3). Since Raphael is the angel of men's souls, he accompanies Enoch on his heavenly jour· ney and explains the distribution of souls in the various sections of sheol after death (I En. 22.3-6). He also appears with Enoch in the paradise of righteousness and tells him of the tree of wisdom (I En. 32.6). In Enoch's vision, the archangel Raphael is charged by God to bind Asael hand and foot and to heal earth, which the angels have conupted (I En. 10.4-8; 54.6). This charge appropriately reftects the double meaning of the root rapha, \"to tie\" and \"to heal.\" Raphael is also said to have power over ill· ness and wounds (1 En. 40.9). In the Apocalypse of Ezra, after Michael the archangel has departed, Raphael ministers to Ezra under the title of commander-in-chief of the angels (Apoc. Esd. 1.4). He is also said to be present at the end of men's Bves (Apoc. Esd. 6.1f.). In the Apocalypse of Moses, with other angels he takes part in the burial of Abel next to Adam (Apoc. Mos. 40). In postbiblical Jewish literature further details are added, such as Raphael's visit to Abraham (Gn. 18; bT lorna 37a), his curing of pious men, and his overpowering of say· age beasts. He is also said to preside over one of the four cohorts of angels surrounding the throne of God. In Christian Jiterature he appears as one of the\n\nfour, or seven, archangels created first of all by God (Evangelium Bartholomaei 4.29), and, in accordance with the etymology of his name, he is held to be the angel of healing, patron of medicine (Origen Homilies on Numbers 14.2; De principiis 1.8.1), and heavenly doctor. This is why some, according to ORIGEN, represent him as a serpent (Contra Celsum 6.30). As with Tobias, Raphael guides men on their journeys and for their sake overpowers the demon Asmocleus. He helps them to earn their living and is present at the hour of death. With Michael, Gabriel, and other angels, he has the power to punish Satan (Ev. Barthol. 4.29). In Coptic literature we know of only two encomia, undoubtedly pseudepigraphic, dedicated to the archangel Raphael. One is attributed to Saint JOHN CHRYSOSTOM and is conserved in the British Muse· um, ed. Budge, 1915, pp. 526-33, 1189-91 [texts]; 1034ff., 1199 [trans.]. Here, as in Tobit, Raphael binds the wicked demon Asmodeus with fetters, and his name is given the meaning of \"God who guideth\n\n2053\n\nmen.\" The episodes of Tobit are recalled, along with the fact that Raphael filled the poor man's house with joy and the rich man's with health (fol. 3b). Besides taking the prayer of Sarah to the seventh heaven, he is a faithful servant who accepts no payment: he is obedient to God and to the man for whom he prepares meals as a chief cook (fols. 4a-b). He is also the patron of the wedding. The appearance of Raphael to Saint JOHN CHRYSOSTOM while he was celebrating mass is narrated in this encomium (fol. 6a). Raphael is shown as the guardian angel of Chrysostom, whom he has not abandoned \"for a single hour, half an hour, or the blink of an eye\" (fol. 6b). Raphael sends Chrysostom to the emperor Arcadius, who builds a shrine in his honor. The other encomium, in Sahidic, In Raphaelem archangelum, is attributed to the patriarch THEOPHIWS OF ALEXANDRIA; fragments are conserved in the libraries of Paris, Naples, and Vienna [identified and edited with a Latin translation by Orlandi, (1972)]. The fragments belong to two codices from the White Monastery (nAYR ANBA SHINOOAH). The encomium is a homily given in the presence of Theodosius II and contains a conversation of Theophilus with the Emperor Theodosius I concerning the building of a shrine in honor of the archangel Raphael in Alexandria, and also the initiation of his cult in the city by a Roman widow caned Dronice. Later the narrative tells of the building of the shrine on the isJand of Patres and of two miracles: the rescue of some people who were shipwrecked and the recovery of a ship, and the liberation from barbarians who wished to sack the island_ The data that the homily gives concerning the construction of the shrine agree with those found in the H[STORY OF THE PATRIARCHS OF ALEXANDRIA (in Arabic, PO I, pp. 426-30). Five homilies in honor of Saint Raphael have been preserved in Arabic, one of which is attributed to CYRIL [ of Alexandria on the feast of the consecration of the church built by Theophilus (3 NasI/ 26 August) (On these homilies, see Muller, 1959, n. 131.) Other writings in Coptic tell us that Raphael was the fourth angel to be created, after Saklitaboth, Michael, and Gabriel (Instal/atio Michaelis, ed. Muller, 1962, n. 3), and that his installation took place after that of Michael and Gabriel (Muller, 1962, n. 9); no date to commemorate this is given, however, suggesting that there was no feast to celebrate his installation. Raphael has an important role in exorcism texts (Stegemann, 1934, pp. 69-70; Kropp, 1930-1931, pp. 3 and 82). He dispenses the holy oil\n\nr ;\n\n2054\n\nRASHID\n\nfor healing (Coptic Evangelium Bartholomaei 85£., ed. Kropp, 1930-1931, Vol. 1, p. 80, and Vol. 2, p. 250) and he is the protector against fever and the angel of strength and good health (Kropp, 19301931, Vol. 1, p. 20, and Vol. 2, p. 203). He is also invoked in a blessing for success in fishing (Kropp, 1930-1931, Vol. 1, p. 33, and Vol. 2, p. 99). All the traits attributed to Raphael in these texts are derived from his activities as narrated in Tobit. When he is mentioned with other archangels. he comes after Michael and Gabriel. In the Coptic liturgy Raphael is the third archangel. His feast is celebrated on 3 NasI, although in the encomium attributed to Chrysostom, it was the fourth of the epagomenic (intercalary) days (4 Nasi). Sixteen doxologies or hymns in his honor are known (MUlIer, 1959, pp. 48-53); these emphasize that he is a servant and instrument of God. He does nothing on his own account-it is God who acts through his intercession. The chief characteristic of Raphael is joy. since he brought joy to the ancient parents of Tobias. On occasions he appears closely united to John the Baptist and the Emperor Theodosius. His cult does not appear to have been particularly widespread, since only one church is mentioned as being dedicated to him. As with other angels, the Coptic tradition relates appearances of Raphael to several saints, such as the martyrs Philotheus and Paese. He is also credited with having miraculously freed the Emperor Theodosius from being swallowed by a shark.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nBudge, E. A. T. W. Miscel/aneous Coptic Texts, pp. 526-33, 1189-91.

In Greek the city was known as Bolbitine. Westerners know the place as Rosetta, a name famous for the stone found not far from the city that provided the key to the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs. In Christian-Arabic sources from the Arabic peri· od, Rashid is first mentioned in connection with the heresy of the BARSANUPHIANS and Gaianites (see GAIANUS). The HISTORY OF THE PATRIARCHS relates that during the patriarchate of ALEXANDER II (705-730), Bishop John of ~a contended successfully with at least one of these groups in Rashid. It is not clear from the text, however, which of the two groups was active in the city. Elsewhere in the History we read that in 749-750, during one of the BASHMURIC REVOLTS, the Coptic Bashmurites killed the Muslims in Rashid and set the city on fire. Rashid appears in the medieval Coptic lists of Egyptian bishoprics, but it is not known when the city first became a bishopric. The first bishops of RashId of whom we have record were in office in the eleventh century. Bishop Yustus of Rashid at· tended a synod in Cairo in 1086 (Munier, 1943, p. 28). Bishop Theodorus of Rashid is mentioned for this same period, but the record does not indicate whether he was the predecessor or the successor of Yustus. • Historical sources for the Crusades mention Rashid often, but they provide no information about the fate of the city's Christian inhabitants. However, the fact that a manuscript was dedicated to the Coptic Orthodox Church of Mark in Rashid sometime around 1799 bespeaks a continuity of Coptic Christians in the city until at least the beginning of the nineteenth century.

Like ANACHOREStS. reclusion is a form of separation from the world, a fundamental element of the monastic ideal. Much practiced among the monks of Syria, it was also practiced in Egypt from the earliest days of monasticism. Saint ANTONY himself lived for a long time as a recluse before his great anachoresis in the Arabian Desert. First he spent about ten years shut up in a tomb not far from his village, provisioned by a friend who brought him bread from time to time. Thereafter he lived for about twenty years shut up in an abandoned Roman fort. The most celebrated Egyptian recluse was JOHN OF LYCQPOUS. who is known from chapter 35 of the Lausiac History of PALLADIUS and the first chapter of the HISTORIA MONACHORUM IN AEGYPTO. He lived to a very advanced age in a three-room cave about five miles from Lycopolis (Asyii!l. One room was reserved for prayer; in another room a window opened on a vestibule in which the numerous visitors waited to converse with John on Saturdays and Sundays. No one ever entered his cell, and he him· self never left it. The Historia monachorum (chap.\n\n2055\n\n6) mentions another recluse named Theonas, whose cell was in the neighborhood of Oxyrhynchus. He\n\ncommunicated with his visitors only in writing, for he had vowed perpetual silence. He came out only at night to gather the plants that were his food. There also were some recluses in Lower Egypt. The APOPHTHEGMATA PATRUM mentions some among the monks of the deserts of NITRIA and SCETIS. Reclusion must be distinguished from the residence in the cell to which the monks in these deserts were constrained. They could leave their cells to visit one another, and above all to participate at the end of the week in the meal taken in common and in the liturgy celebrated in the church. But the recluse remained shut up in his cell and did not come out, even to go to church (d. Nau, 1907, pp. 56-58). In certain cases, a priest came to celebrate the Eucharist in the recluse's cell. Since he never left his cell, the recluse used the services of a faithful layman to obtain what he required. It was not necessary to withdraw to the desert to practice reclusion. A young Alexandrian named Theodorus, who later became a disciple of PACHOMIUS, Jived for twelve years in quarters that the patriarch ATHANASIUS had fitted up for him in the church, where he acted as a reader. Reclusion was a form of solitary life better suited for women than anachoresis in the desert. The Apophlhegmata palrum notes some cases of women recluses, such as me former prostitute converted by Serapion. Palladius heard in Alexandria of a young woman named Alexandra who, having left the town, shut herself in a tomb; she remained there until her death, ten years later, without seeing anyone, receiving what she required through an opening in the wall (Palladius, chap. 5). This voluntary reclusion is evidently very different from the reclusion imposed upon monks guilty of serious faults. Some monasteries, like those of Pachomius and SHENUTE, had, in fact, prisons. Inspired by a purely religious motive, reclusion could appeal to the word of Jesus in Matthew 6:6: \"When you pray, go to your private room and shut the door. and pray to your Father who is in secret.\" Several historians (among them BoucheLeclercq) have maintained, following H. Weingarten, that reclusion among the monks was a survival within Christianity of the way of life of men who lived in the Serapeum at Memphis, to whom the Greek papyri give the name katochoi, a term generally translated as \"recluse.\" This thesis was refuted as early as 1920-1922 by P. Gobillo!. Even retaining the meaning of \"recluse,\" which has been\n\n2056\n\nRED MONASTERY\n\ncontested by E. Preuschen. according to whom the katochoi were \"possessed,\" the motives for this reclusion are not very clear and have been debated. K. Sethe saw recluses simply as prisoners, most often shut up for debt. For L. Delekat, they were people in difficulty who had taken refuge in the temple, claiming the right of asylum. According to these diverse hypotheses, the reclusion of the katochoi does not appear to be inspired by any religious motive, which is essential in monastic reclusion.

In the same way, the couches for the ancient meals for the dead, such as are found at al-Bagawat (Grossmann, 1982, pp. 7879), are arranged in a semicircle. The seating arrangement of the meal described in the Coptic life of Shenute of AtrIb during his stay in Constantinople (Amelineau, 1888, p. 43, fol. 48v) may not have been very different. In order to accommodate as many such rings of seats as possible in one room, the refectories in Egypt were built with several aisles. The individual aisles were of equal width, and one ring of seats was provided for each of the bays fonned by the columns. Most refectories contain two or three aisles. The largest examples so far identified in Egypt are the two refectories of DAYR ALBALAY'ZAH. which both have three aisles. The refectories in the great Pachomian monasteries were probably similar. Very small refectories have only a single pillar standing in the middle of the room; the room is divided by arches thrown across to the four sides into four bays of roughly equal size (e.g., the present chapel of Mar Jirjis at DAYR ANBA. BISHOI; d. Evelyn-White, 1933, Vol. 3, pp. 161-62; DAYR ALBARAMOS, the actual \"monastic henhouse\"; and Qasr • al-Wizz). In the late Fatimid period, a middle-sized type was developed with four pillars and nine symmetrically arranged bays (e.g., DAYR AL-FAKHfJRI at Isna and Dayr Anba Bishoi in Wadi al-Na!n1n; d. Evelyn-White, 1933, Vol. 3, p. 165, where this is described as \"a large and nearly square building\"). The rings of seats were in several cases built of bricks. In the refectory of DAYR ANBA HADRA. they were distributed remarkably irregularly. The equipment of the refectory also included a water jug stand and, in later times, a lectern. In addition, the kitchen and storerooms were logically accommodated in the neighborhood of the refectory. BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nRED MONASTERY.

See Music, Coptic: Description.\n\nRESPONSORY, a form of liturgical chant wherein a cantor says verses of the Psalms and the whole group of cantors or the congregation responds with a refrain. This refrain may take one of several forms: (I) it may be one fixed word, such as \"Alleluia,\" in the psalmody of the Coptic month of Kiyahk; (2) it may be a fixed group of words, such as \"For His mercy endures forever\"; \"0 Lord Jesus Christ help me\" in the Sunday psalmody; or \"My Lord Jesus Christ, my good Savior\" in the Saturday psalmody; (3) it may be a short petition, such as \"Restore us, 0 God, and let Thy face shine, that we may be saved,\" which recurs three times in Psalm 80, or \"Lord have mercy\" (Kyrie Eleison), which is reiterated throughout the Divine Liturgy. The choice of the appropriate category of liturgical chant-tractus (where a single cantor sings and the congregation listens), antiphon (where two alternating groups of singers take their turns), or responsory-depends primarily on the particular time of the day or night when it is to be used. Thus, at vespers, which is a comparatively short service, the tractus system is the one usually followed, whereas in long night vigils, the responsory proves to be more suitable. It may be of particular interest to mention in this respect, that when in February 356 a military de· tachment invaded the church where Saint ATHANASIUS was celebrating a vigil service, the congregation was asked to join in a responsory. Here is the episode in full in the words of Athanasius, taken from his \"Apologia de fuga\" (Apology for Flight):\n\nIt was night, and some of the people were keeping vigil, for a communion was expected. A body of soldiers suddenly advanced upon them, consisting of a general [Syrianus1 and five thou· sand armed men with naked swords, bows and arrows and dubs.... I deemed that I ought not in such a time of confusion to leave the people. but that I ought rather to be the first to meet the danger; so I sat down on my throne and desired the deacon to read a psalm, and the people to respond \"For His mercy endureth forever.\" Then I bade them all return to their own houses. But now the general with the soldiery forced his way into the church, and surrounded the sanctuary in order to arrest me. The clergy and the laity who had remained clamorously besought me to withdraw. This I finnly refused to do until all the others had retreated. I rose, had a prayer offered,\n\nand directed all the people to retire. \"It is better:' said I. \"for me to meet the danger alone, than for any of you to be hurt.\" When the greater number of the people had left the church, and just as the rest were following, the monks and some of the clergy who had remained came up and drew me out. And so, may the truth be my witness, the Lord leading and protecting me. we passed through the midst of the soldiers, some of whom were stationed around the sanctuary, and others marching about the church.

The term Agha in his name is a Turkish title granted by the viceroy to governors of provinces. Apparently he was active in repelling Arab marauders from the area east of the Damietta branch of the Delta and the establishment of security in that region. He founded a series of estates bearing his name in the district of Mit Ghamr. Muf.Jammad Ali's eldest son, Ibrahim Pasha, was received by him as his honored guest together with Mu'aJ]im GHAil in March 1822. After leaving Mil Ghamr, Ghali precipitated the wrath of the pasha, who murdered him and cast his body outside the district of ZiM. On hearing what happened to his fellow Copt, Rizq hastened to the pasha's presence and pleaded for the recovery of Ghali's body, which he took to the nearest Coptic church prior to burial. Rizq is one of the few Copts in the administration who happened to retain their position until their death. He left behind him a family of notable Copts and his name is still remembered in the district of MIt Ghamr.\n\n2059\n\nROMANCES. There are two Coptic romances; the Alexander Romance and the Cambyses Romance.\n\nThe Alexander Romance All genres of literature-from history to poetryinclude chronicles of the life of Alexander the Great\n\nof Macedonia (reigned 336-323 B.c.). The most widespread work, tl;>e Alexander Romance, is falsely ascribed to the Greek historian Callisthenes (c. 370327 B.C.). In different forms, whether varying recensions, synopses, or entirely new collections, the Alexander Romance filtered into the Middle East and later into the West. As a result, the history of the transmission of the work has become very complicated. The Coptic version played an active role in that transmission. Probably during the sixth century, a text translated from Greek into Coptic was revised and periected, and it gained an independent character that gave it a special place in the development of the romance. The fragmentary Coptic (Sahidic) version was taken from a book in the White Monastery (DAYR ANBA SHINUDAH) of Apa Shenute the Great near Suhaj in Upper Egypt. Originally the 220'page manuscript consisted of about thirty·seven chapters. In all probability, each chapter had for its motto a verse from the Bible. The surviving recensions deal with Alexander among the Elamites, his rescue from the abyss (chaos) by Antilochos (Eurylochos in Gedrosia), how the disguised Alexander discovers the fidelity of the Macedonians and the disloyalty of the Persian King Agrikolaos, the legacy of the true Selpharios, Alexander's sojourn near the four streams of Paradise on the borders of the land of darkness, Alexander with the Brahmans, and finally Alexander's murder by poisoning.

The narratives extend the stories of the martyrs and also of the apocalypses. Those who treat some Coptic literature as being \"profane\" err; Coptic literature is Christian. As a tool of God, Alexander could be considered a prophet; as a martyr, he foreshadowed Christ.\n\n2060\n\nROMANCES\n\nThe Cambyses Romance Of the Cambyses Romance there remains only a fragmentary version of six parchment leaves in poor condition at the Staatliches Museum in Berlin (P9009; probably eighth or ninth century). The text is written in Sahidic Coptic, and undoubtedly formed part of a larger manuscript of unknown angm. The romance deals with the Persian King Cambyses II (reigned 529-522 B.c.). The epistle of Cambyses to the \"Inhabitants of the East\" attempts to incite them against Egypt and the pharaoh without success. Helped by the wise Bothros, the addressees stand firmly by Egypt, the pharaoh, and the"
