        "text": "The broader interest of this study is linked to the notions of the ‘roles’ of women in the socio-cultural landscape of the Greco-Roman world, and especially, to the re-negotiation of these roles within the formation of the Early Christian discourse in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. The research is focusing on one of the vastly 'popular' in Late Antiquity texts from the ‘genre’ of apocrypha: The Acts of Paul and Thecla, and in particular, on his heroine, Thecla. Reading through the captivating narrative of Thecla’s struggles, the study aims to detect the textual features of the female protagonist that can be meaningful in the larger perspective of the Early Christian discourse and its paradigmatic notions of renunciation and 'soteriological' suffering.\n\nWomen played a vital role in the spread of Christianity in the first and second century CE. This paper will assess their contribution by examining the various functions and responsibilities held by women as described in the New Testament and Canonical Gospels. The assessment will commence with a brief description of the lives of women in the Greco-Roman world. This description of the cultural setting will serve as an introduction to Jesus’ attitude towards and interaction with women, who were among his first followers. Women continued to function in the early church in a variety of roles such as apostles, evangelists, prophets, teachers and house church leaders, using their skills to spread the message and further the impact of the fledgling religion. A close examination of these multifarious roles, drawing on the Canonical Gospels as primary source, will demonstrate the integral part women played in the dissemination of Christianity.\n\nR. W. Connell discovered a tendency in the social organization of masculinity for constructions of masculinity to be based on adaptations to crisis points emerging from encounters with hegemonic masculinity. I argue that such a pattern shapes the presentation of martyrs in Revelation. Written to resist an empire that was often presented as the \"alpha male,\" Revelation must respond to the masculinity crisis provoked by disassociation from Rome. The presentation of the martyrs as masculine figures who do not follow the pattern of traditional masculinity allows the male readers and hearers of the texts to identify with the martyr's masculinity as an alternative to identifying with Rome."
