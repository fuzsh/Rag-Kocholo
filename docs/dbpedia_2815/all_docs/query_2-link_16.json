        "text": "In the second decade of the 20 th century a small group of Jewish German intellectuals was considering resuscitating Schelling's late project of a philosophy of revelation. In his Star of Redemption, Franz Rosenzweig (1886-1929) reads the attempt of thinking revelation, which plunged idealism in an abyss of trans-speculative silence and in the depths of the via negativa, as the dawn of a different, thoroughly positive, line of approach not only to revelation itself but also to the thought that goes to revelation's encounter. Rosenzweig construes revelation as a complex speech-act that invites and enables a liturgical response. Instead of a semantics of revelation stretched beyond its speculative limits, Rosenzweig envisages a pragmatic of revelation and a performative-liturgical semiosis. Our group reunites three philosophers with a patristic background and an expertise in the modern and recent philosophies of language. We shall use the semantic-pragmatic tension at the heart of the Rosenzweig-Schelling debate to explore the possibility of a performative liturgical function of patristic literature as an alternative to the already well-studied semantic and speculative directions of this same literature. Our central concern will be taking seriously this literature's claims to being an extension of and a diligent response to scriptural revelation. To this end, we propose a set of analyses of Origen's exegesis of Proverbs 22:20-21, John 1:1-2, and Phillipians 2:6-11, as well as a few, more comprehensive, interpretations of Cappadocian homiletic literature, which we shall place in dialogue with Rosenzweig's Sprachdenken, Benveniste's theory of enunciation, and Austin's performative linguistics; with LÃ©vinas' philosophy of language and its Lyotardian elaboration, as well as with Zizioulas personalist reformulation of patristic ontology.\n\nFor my thesis I did a comparative analysis of the Coptic Perfect Discourse from the Nag Hammadi codices and the Latin Asclepius. Both texts have been subject to discourse, and much about the texts is still disputed; about their authors and readers, the milieus in which their originated, etc. Differences between the translations have been noticed, but so far there has been no actual analysis of these differences and what these can tell us about their respective texts. I argue that by looking at the differences between the texts, we can learn much about their respective origins, users, and general context. In this thesis I examine a number of differences between the texts, analyze them, and offer my interpretation of what these differences can tell us. For example, both texts contain some sentences that talk about human procreation, but both differ in their accounts. These different conceptions of procreation or anthropogony could be connected to wider (religio-)philosophical systems, which gives us insight into the composers and audience of the texts. This thesis is necessarily a limited analysis, but I hope that it can serve as a starting point for further analyses of these and perhaps other Hermetic texts."
