        "text": "In spite of the observation that the literary structure of the Apocalypse of John I is a significant key to the interpretation of its messages, one of the most controversial aspects of the study of the book, perhaps, is its literary structure. The lack of scholarly consensus on the literary structure of the Apocalypse has grown to the point that the claim is true that almost every interpreter of the book produces a different literary structure. In fact, J. Ramsey Michaels encourages every exegete to produce his/her own detailed structure of the Apocalypse because it should become the one most useful to you, precisely because it is yours. This view implies that there would be many literary structures as there are exegetes of the book. In essence, this threatens to reduce the study of the literary structure of the Apocalypse to absurdity. In response to this threat, this paper surveys the various proposals that have been made in relation to the study of the literary structure of the Apocalypse. It also aims at ascertaining the positive contributions that each proposal has made as well as pointing out apparent weaknesses that may characterise each proposal on the literary structure of the Apocalypse of John.\n\nThis thesis is concerned with the novel, and specifically with how the novel is recognisable as a certain kind of meaning-the kind of meaning known to literary theorists as genre. To say that genre is a kind of meaning is to infer that it shapes linguistic meaning in the broad sense that I have given thus far, for genre can indeed be said to both enhance and constrain meaning in these terms (Frow Genre 10). Thus a statement in a novel, although it will have the same linguistic value that it possesses in ordinary usage, will have the additional meaning described by the term \"fiction\"; and this additional meaning value will both limit and direct the inferences that follow from the utterance. Situation-as an integral relation of space and time-is important because such enhancements will include presumptions founded on conventions not ordinarily required for everyday speech and writing where the utterance is unmediated and the speakers are phenomenally known or knowable. These conventions will position the utterance as deriving from a character in the novel, or the narrator, rather than the author of the work overall. Such distinctions are primarily spatiotemporal: although the coherence of the novel's statements will be critically attributable to the writer, these are mediated through different \"persons\"-they come to us via the fictive speakers of the novel. The four key metaphors identified in the title to this thesis are the kinds of meaning that are mediated in the novel to create this effect, which is the sense of a space and time that is other than the conditions in which the novel was written. Mediation of these terms occurs in a variety of genres but it is in particular the novel which achieves this effect through the elaboration and transformation of ordinary styles of speech. Indeed, the construction of fictive eventfulness is possible because all meaning is metaphoric when added to the world through speech; for speech represents a likeness to the phenomenal aspect without being the same as that aspect: meaning is not material, in other words, but a conceptual aspect correlating to the phenomenal. This realisation underpins post-Saussurean semiologie and post-Peircean semiotics; 1 but in this thesis"
