Hayworth previously worked in the market as a sportscaster at KTSP-TV from 1987 to 1994 and then hosted mornings at iHeartMedia's Conservative Talk 550 KFYI from 2007 to 2010.

        "text": "JD Hayworth, with a television and radio career that spans five decades, featuring assignments as a show host on both coasts, and includes a historic 12-year “detour” to Capitol Hill, returns full-time to Phoenix radio, reuniting with local news/talk station KFNN, for the weekday 3-5pm drive time, “All Right Now!” In 1994, Hayworth was elected to the United States Congress from Arizona’s 6th District, as part of the first Republican House Majority in forty years. JD’s new show “All Right Now” signifies his return to daily Arizona local broadcast radio. Hayworth was first heard on KFNN with his short-form morning commentary program, “The Business of Sports” in 1992 & 1993, while he was seen daily on local TV station Channel 10 as the weeknight sports anchor at 6pm and 10pm.\n\n“JD coming home to KFNN is a watershed moment for our station and all Arizona radio listeners” said Ron Cohen, Founder and CEO of CRC Broadcasting Company, owners of KFNN. “With so much interest in the 2024 election and Arizona’s growing notoriety as a key battleground state, the timing could not be better to bring JD back to host a daily show. No Valley radio host possesses JD’s credentials in both broadcasting and politics,” said Cohen.\n\n“KFNN has given me this chance to return to the air on a regular basis, and I’m grateful,” Hayworth said. “No one will confuse me with ‘Toto’ from the ‘Wizard of Oz,’ but I’ll ‘routinely pull back the curtain’ on what’s really happening with politics and public policy.”\n\nIn 1994, Hayworth made history when he was elected to Congress from Arizona’s 6th District, as part of the first Republican House Majority in forty years. He became the first Arizonan to serve on the powerful Ways & Means Committee and was often called upon by GOP Leadership to help craft communication themes and serve as a national spokesman. The six-term congressman then ran unsuccessfully for the US Senate in 2010. He finished second in the Arizona Republican Primary as the incumbent John McCain spent 30 million dollars, mostly in radio and television advertising, to defeat him.\n\nJ.D.’s broadcasting background led to frequent guest appearances on cable news outlets and nationally syndicated radio talk shows; he even anchored telecasts of MSNBC’s “Scarborough Country” and CNN’s “Crossfire,” and served as a guest host on the nationwide news/talk radio programs including Mark Levin, Erick Erickson, Laura Ingraham, Mike Gallagher, and Todd Starnes."
