        "text": "Sonya Morgan\n\nSonya Morgan has been in the real estate business for more than 20 years, many of those at the head of her own private lending company. She’s a natural born sales woman and leader. “I sold everything I could sell growing up,” she says. “Business is in my blood; it’s what I love doing, but at the same time I have a passion to help hurting people find restoration.”\n\nThat’s why several years ago Sonya got involved in Without Permission (https://withoutpermission.org ), a grassroots organization working to confront the culture that promotes sex trafficking in California’s Central Valley and across the country. That’s why she spent time working with the survivors—the girls who have been rescued out of trafficking, triaging them after they’ve been picked up by the police or been recognized by a social worker. “I’ve been fingerprinted and done the things I’ve needed to do to gain access to juvenile halls, schools, police departments and churches to educate people on human trafficking,” she says. “This is extremely difficult work at times. There are some very heartbreaking parts to it.\n\n“Recently the CEO asked me to step in and run the organization,” Sonya continues. “It’s just been a few months but already I realize that the easiest thing I’ve done in this organization is running it. I’ve learned that I can use my business acumen in ways that align with my passion for changing culture.”\n\nThis insight has come through Sonya’s longtime connection with Pinnacle Forum. “When Guy Rodgers came along and introduced the cultural impact plan, that had a huge influence on me. It gave me an understanding of how God created me and what my mission was. I realized for first time that there was a place for God in business. Before I had separated my life into church and work and I didn’t mix the two. But now I saw how God could use me in the marketplace. That was my mission field, away from the church and out in the world.”\n\nIt was actually at work that Sonya was first introduced to Pinnacle Forum. “Many years ago I had a boss who was a Pinnacle Forum Partner,” she recalls. “When a local businesswomen’s Bible study decided to transition into a Pinnacle Forum women’s group, I was invited in as the office host.”\n\nSonya was also part of a group of women whom Chuck later asked for input on how Pinnacle Forum could do a better job of reaching women leaders. “We talked about how Pinnacle Forum started out as a men’s organization and has had difficulty attracting women,” Sonya says. “I always saw the value in it and was getting a lot out of it, but there were many women who joined a Forum and then left because they felt it wasn’t meeting their needs as women.”\n\nOne of the areas the group discussed was the need for a national director for women, and recently Pinnacle Forum Partner, Caroline Mendez, stepped into that position. “Since she’s come on board, there’s been massive growth among the women’s groups,” Sonya says. “We all feel God is calling women right now to leadership in the Christian realm. We see God moving within Pinnacle Forum to help make this happen!\n\n“I’m in two Forum groups now because I’m leading a newer Forum. My more established group has undergone a transition from being more of a prayer group to focusing on encouraging each other as leaders. Prayer is an important part of that but we are focusing more on planning how we can impact culture and how we can support each other in doing that. I have really enjoyed the transition.\n\n“I’m a completely different person than I would be if I weren’t in Forums,” Sonya says. “I have a whole different skillset for dealing with life because I’m connected to these amazing, wise, women who have experiences I’ve never had. They’re praying for me; they’re advising me. Because of that, everything I do is more purposeful. My life is easier because I’m part of Pinnacle Forum. I have more time because I’m not spinning my wheels as much. I have a better focus because of the books I’m reading and the podcasts I’m listening to. I’ve gotten so much out of them. If I wasn’t attending a Pinnacle Forum group, I would be fed just from the podcasts.” (Listen to Sonya’s own podcast, The Power of a Woman’s Intuition in a Male Dominated Industry, at https://pinnacleforum.com/ 2020/07/ul-podcast-113/.)\n\n“Caroline’s doing an amazing job and I’m looking forward to what will come out of the women’s groups.” Sonya says. “Pinnacle Forum is such an amazing organization and I’m excited to be a part of it.”"
