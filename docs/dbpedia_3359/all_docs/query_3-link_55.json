        "text": "JD listened...learned...and now, laments! For a guy who began in Broadcasting at age 14--if you're scoring at home, that was 1972--the year Joe Biden won a Senate seat at age 29 (he turned 30 to pass \"constitutional muster\" a few days after the election), I loved to scan the AM dial for \"Big Signals from Big Cities.\" While my initial interest was exclusively \"Top 40,\" the voices, production, and drama of what Douglas Edwards called \"news in the making,\" lured me time and again to WCBS, New York. The headlines, a brief forecast, and the sounding of the familiar \"four chimes,\" with the loudest striking at precisely the top of the hour, accompanied by the dramatically delivered words, \"Now CBS covers the World on NewsRadio 88, WCBS, New York\" absolutely captivated me, as did the signature CBS News Sounder. Though it will soon \"fade into a new format,\" these sounds will remain in memory...and select internet sites. https://lnkd.in/gAUacwCq\n\nJD-On-the-Air...with YOUR Help? Yet another opportunity for professional advancement in Radio...as you help produce and direct \"All Right Now!\" Yes...check out the link below...apply to locally-owned KFNN...and \"fasten your seatbelt\" as you help me deliver quality talk radio content each weekday from 3-5pm down the \"homestretch\" of the 2024 Campaign...and Beyond! https://lnkd.in/g5yGQmmb\n\nJD-in-Print: This is not a drill...it's \"attest!\" My latest column deals with the much-maligned (with good reason) \"Motor Voter Act,\" and how an unlucky 2013 decision by the \"Supremes\" superseded the will of Arizona voters, discarding \"documented\" proof of citizenship, and enshrining the Clintonian precept of \"lawyerly evasion.\" Fasten your seat belts...it's first of many electoral \"detours\" ahead in 2024. https://lnkd.in/e9AJdJBf\n\nJD-in-Print: So much is wrong these days--that it prompts a reminder to remember what seems so right. As long as we have our National Pastime, the warmth of spring, the crack of the bat, and the dreams of young fans insure that Baseball remains a valued member of Our American Family. https://lnkd.in/gW6XnKck\n\nJD-in-Print: Forget \"Jason and the Argonauts...\" Nothing is mythical about Jason Kelce--except the degree to which old fashioned dedication, singleminded determination, and a generous dose of inspiration led the former \"walk on\" at the University of Cincinnati to perennial All-Pro status with the Philadelphia Eagles. While the Eagles must find a new center, Jason Kelce will soon find himself the \"center of attention\"--something rare for any offensive lineman--active or retired. https://lnkd.in/g3rEtCNM"
