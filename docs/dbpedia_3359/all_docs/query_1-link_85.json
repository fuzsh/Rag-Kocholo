        "text": "Congressman David Schweikert (R-AZ) currently scores a 92% on our Legislative Scorecard and was elected as part of the Tea Party wave in 2010. He was able to easily defeat incumbent Democrat Harry Mitchell 52% to 43%.\n\nRep. Schweikert was born in Los Angeles, California in 1962. He grew up in Scottsdale, AZ with his adoptive parents and siblings, graduating from Saguaro High School in 1980. He earned his Bachelor’s degree in finance and real estate in 1985 and his MBA from Arizona State University’s W.P. Carey School of Business in 2005.\n\nIn 1990, Rep. Schweikert was elected to the Arizona State House of Representatives. His strong conservative stances led him to be elected Majority Whip after his reelection in 1992. While serving in the State House, he sponsored one of the largest tax cuts in Arizona history. He also worked tirelessly to reduce the size of the state government and cut pork barrel spending.\n\nIn 1995, was elected as Chairman of the Arizona State Board of Equalization, where he served until 2004, overseeing billions of dollars from Arizona citizens and businesses. In 2004, he was elected Treasurer of Maricopa County, one of the largest counties in the United States. Rep. Schweikert protected billions of taxpayer dollars and earned over $300 million in investment income without running a deficit, even in tough economic times.\n\nRep. Schweikert has run for the U.S. House of Representatives three times. In 1994, he lost a primary against J.D. Hayworth, and in 2008 he lost to incumbent Harry Mitchell in the general election. But in 2010, in part due to rejection of the Obama Administration and Congress’ big-government spending, Rep. Schweikert was able to win his third attempt at a House seat.\n\nHe currently sits on the Financial Services Committee where he serves as the Vice Chair of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. He is also a member of the Republican Study Committee.\n\nRep. Schweikert and his wife, Joyce, currently live in Fountain Hills, AZ with their famous dog, Charlie, who has his own Twitter hashtag (#CharlieTakesDC) and has appeared with the Congressman on ABC’s Top Line program. They also have two cats, who are less famous and apparently camera shy."
