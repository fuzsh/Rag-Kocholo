        "text": "Former KFYI Phoenix conservative talker and current candidate for the Republican US Senate nomination in Arizona J.D. Hayworth is taking full responsibility for his infomercial appearance hawking conferences on how to obtain government grants. He says it was a job, and perhaps the message to take from it is “buyer beware.”\n\nTalkingPointsMemo published a transcription of a Hayworth video addressing the infomercial situation. Tellingly, the video did not come from Hayworth’s staff – it came from the rival campaign of Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).\n\n“It is similar in many ways to my days in broadcasting, when we would have advertising clients, who would pay for a live endorsement,” said Hayworth in a clip. “I always say about any product or service, one of the staples I learned growing up is caveat emptor, ‘buyer beware.’ I think that is a given in any commercial endeavor – I would certainly hope in this one. But yeah, I’m a broadcaster, and yeah, I appeared in this, and yes, it was a job. And that’s that.”"
