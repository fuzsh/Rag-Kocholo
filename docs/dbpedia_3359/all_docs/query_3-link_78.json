        "text": "Fight disinformation: Sign up for the free Mother Jones Daily newsletter and follow the news that matters.\n\nIn the annals of congressional arrogance, Barr is a repeat offender. In 1998, The New York Times reported an incident in which Barr slapped a female security guard at the airport, after which his wife summarized her view of airport security: “They were all from other countries, and they were talking about me in their language…I thought, ‘Hey, this is my country.'”\n\nThe Class Clown Award\n\nSenator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) publicly sang — picture it — “Who Let the Dogs Out?”\n\nIn a fundraising mailer, Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-Ariz.) sent out “Jim Jeffords Barf Bags” to be used while contemplating the senator’s “sickening…disgusting…treachery.”\n\nRep. Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.), accused of causing $28,000 of damage to a rented yacht on a Y2K booze cruise, later appeared at a political roast dressed in a sailor suit. Tough to the finish, the son of Senator Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) capped off the evening by singing “Patrick the Sailor Man.”\n\nRep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.) brought up the rumor of Florida Governor Jeb Bush’s affair with Katherine Harris. “I believe him,” cracked Foley about Jeb’s denials. “I mean, good God — dating Katherine Harris? How would you get that makeup off your collar?”"
