        "text": "Fantastic!!!\n\nThis book was fantastic and is a must listen!!!\n\nI have now listened to over 50 books, and 'Whatever It Takes' has proven to be one of the fastest and most enjoyable listens.\n\nJ.D. Hayworth and Joseph Eule have complied in one place all of the major compelling illegal immigration arguments and present the issues in detail. The book presents a clear critical thinking approach that identifies the root cause of the increasing problems that face all US Citizens (crime, tax, health care, etc.), what the primary recommended solutions are, and finally the resulting effects that the recommended actions would produce -all based on verifiable empirical facts and not opinion.\n\nThough from my perception the majority of the book is focusing on the identification of the illegal immigration problems with only a small portion devoted to the authors recommended solutions. This makes perfect sense due to the enormity of the pro-illegal immigration influences in our society today 'Not what is best for America, but what is best for them', and the ease of which this problem can be fixed via what ever it takes to 'secure our borders' now! I'll even buy President Bush and Senator McCain copies to listen to, they need it.\n\nA must listen!\n\nIf you're an American citizen with even the slightest concern for the welfare of our country, then your need to listen to this book. JD Hayworth does an excellent job bringing example after example of how illegal immigration is destroying our once great country. Even more appauling, is the fact that our elected officials do nothing to stop it. Again, Hayworth provides shocking details here that leave you wondering in disbelief. Crime, jobs, employment, health care, fiscal impacts, the drain on education,,, the list goes on and on as Hayworth bring to light the very sad truths of all these topics. As a resident of a border state, I see firsthand what he is talking about. Unfortunately, everything he says, is absolutely true. This book will leave you angry, frustrated, and very disappointed with the political process our government takes with Mexico. The book is well presented as Hayworth does an excellent job of narrating. I wish I could give this book more stars.\n\nIllegal Immigration and the War on Terror\n\nOpen borders not only allows the invasion from our Mexican neighbors but is the passage way terrorists take coming up through South America where many radical Islamic groups have set up training camps and indoctrination centers. These terrorists simply join in with groups of illegal Mexicans crossing the border. Securing our borders not only will stop the invasion but will keep Americans safe from terrorists. Numbers USA lays out the case for reducing legal immigration as well as stopping illegal immigration in the name of saving what is left of our national identity. In a last ditch attempt to mange immigration so no one group of immigrants is excessive and not amenable to assimilation, reducing the numbers entering the US is essential. Legal immigration must be cut at least in half to accomplish this goal, our borders secured and English must be made the official language of the United States."
