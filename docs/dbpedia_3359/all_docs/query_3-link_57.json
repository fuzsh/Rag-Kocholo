        "text": "Former Rep. J.D. Hayworth (R-AZ), whose Senate campaign in the Republican primary against Sen. John McCain has come under scrutiny due to his 2007 appearance in a questionable infomercial for “free money” from government grants, is standing by his involvement in the ad — and saying “buyer beware.”\n\nIn a live video webcast last night, Hayworth discussed the matter. “It is similar in many ways to my days in broadcasting, when we would have advertising clients, who would pay for a live endorsement,” said Hayworth, in a clip that has been distributed by the McCain campaign. “I always say about any product or service, one of the staples I learned growing up is caveat emptor, ‘buyer beware.’ I think that is a given in any commercial endeavor – I would certainly hope in this one. But yeah, I’m a broadcaster, and yeah, I appeared in this, and yes, it was a job. And that’s that.”\n\nThat would be a fun slogan for a Senate campaign: “Buyer Beware.”\n\nThe infomercial promoted seminars at which people could obtain information on “free money” from the government, in the form of grants or loans they would not have to pay back. The seminars themselves would then sell people packets of information for $999. The parents company received an F rating from the Better Business Bureau, and was the subject of a letter to the Federal Trade Commission by 32 state attorneys general.\n\nIn the infomercial, Hayworth’s endorsement was burnished along with his credentials as a former Congressman and member of the House Ways and Means Committee."
