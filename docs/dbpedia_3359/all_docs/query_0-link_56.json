        "text": "And so now back to the History of Decisions Chapter 1 Footprints on the Moon Eight days after the Soviets propelled the first human being into space, just one day after the Bay of Pigs ended in America’s humiliation, the 35th president of the United Stated wrote this memorandum to the man who would one day be the 36th President of the United States. It was dated April 20,1961. With that memo John Kennedy cranked up the ponderous mill of federal decision making that ultimately would send the United States on its way to the moon, spend 25billion of public money, harness the adventure and test the faith of some, arouse the doubt and anger of others. In less than 200 words, he set the wealthiest nation in history toward a goal that poets dreamt of, that primitive had worshipped. So as we are looking in history, we should reflect today before trying to place more footprints in the future as one global push again for a never ending goal. Our morals and values as human kind are so much more important than having a title of power, where ecological evolution was pending on earth to be able to solve the equation to further development. We are now reversed to consider going back to the chapters, concerning 1 and then 3 And the base two is what is now and its for you to make the choice on what you believe is the best for the development of our youth to whom will be our elders and legacies living? Let’s not fail that attempt again. Or try to steal a home base and get caught in the act.\n\nThe article is an excellent summing up of the traditions & practices, through they appear irrational to some people. Considering the nature, pressure and danger of the challenging activity, it is perhaps not too surprising that such good luck charms have been adopted over a period, in these space nations. One can notice that the Russians who have more superstitions, have had fewer fatalities in their space endeavour. As long as it increases the odds, whatever the rationality, superstition will stay! For rationalists, it may appear absurd that in the era of high-tech space age there is still superstition and custom that each and every crew member follows as though executing a holy rite. However, According to a study, believing in a superstition might actually increase an individual's performance on a task by increasing his or her self-confidence. Researchers from Germany's University of Cologne claim that superstitions have substantial performance benefits.\n\nThe article is an excellent summing up of the traditions & practices, through they appear irrational to some people.

Scientists were hoping to confirm the presence of water ice in a permanently shadowed crater at the Moon’s South Pole among other things. In it, I had argued, as I did in 1991 as a graduate student in my honor mention wining essay to a writing contest on space, “Earth: The Case for Space” (a NASA scientist had won the first prize) and in an interview to PBS Space Age Series Nova - What is a Heaven For? that humanity needs to return to the moon and Mars to achieve economic convergence in search of extra planetary natural resources. This also became the vision of Elon Musk after Barack Obama triggered the commercial space industry in the United States. When I sat in the Washington, DC passport office in 2012 renewing my U.S. passport to apply for a visa to go to Brazil for the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD, Rio+20) waiting to pick up my passport, SpaceX had made history with its first commercial docking with the International Space Station (ISS). By 2012 when I landed in Rio, I had changed my mind. I significantly scaled back to earth orbit away from moon and Mars and my initial linear vision I had entertained in 1991 when I had contributed to a project on an international mission to Mars in Toulouse, France as part of a 120+ team at International Space University, working specifically on Space Resources and Manufacturing and, in part, influenced by Robert Zubrin’s thought leadership at NASA on in-situ resource utilization on Mars. I had changed my mind because I had solved the problem of the economics of global sustainability by returning to the natural and beautiful circularity of Earth’s agriculture and using space just for that and nothing else. What mattered was only climate, food, and water to ensure the future of humanity. I dropped my pen and went to Rio. I was done thinking about it. It took me 21 years to overcome my cognitive dissonance about the linearity of secular economic growth since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. I had become an economic renegade. I have been doing nothing since but convince the world, swimming upstream like a salmon, to return to Earth only to be gobbled up by the status quo of the economic cocaine bear. Eventually I know I will succeed in fertilizing the egg of the subliminal fecundity of our geopolitics for humanity to be born again.\n\nHello everyone! Today we are introducing a new series of posts called “Historical Marker Highlights”, which, as the name implies, gives a shout out to historical markers relating to STEM history in Ohio. We want to highlight the fact that history occurs all around us and not just far away places. You never know, a notable piece of STEM history might have occurred right in your own backyard that might have played a role not just in local history but national history as well. For this first Historical Marker Highlight we are giving a shout out to an important experiment that has a connection to Ohio. This marker is especially fitting given that we are nearing the end of April and it is around this time of year that you hear the age-old phrase “April showers bring May flowers”. Today’s historical marker is located in Wilmington, Ohio and commemorates the Thunderstorm Project¹. The experiment was the first major study conducted in the United States that, you guessed it, examined thunderstorms². The study was funded and mandated by Congress in 1945, and became necessary as a result of World War II, which caused a boom in the aviation industry, aircraft incidents related to thunderstorms occurred more frequently². However, in the early 20th century, little was known about thunderstorms, making such a study necessary². The project occurred in two phases, with the first occurring in 1946 in Florida, due to the fact that thunderstorms happen there more often than anywhere else in North America³. The second phase took place in Clinton County in 1947¹. The area was chosen due to the frequency of weather fronts that occur there¹. That phase of the experiment involved pilots from the Clinton County Air Force Base, who (we kid you not), flew through storms in every stage of their development and different levels of intensity¹. Along with this, scientists used various weather instruments along with balloon soundings and radar¹. The observations that were collected provide a greater understanding of thunderstorms, particularly about their life cycles and their structure¹. The results from the study, which were analyzed by the University of Chicago, were published in 1949¹. Learn more about the historical marker and where it is located below along with more information about the Thunderstorm Project. Stay tuned for our next post on May 10th!
