However, European people, and especially ruling aristocracies, just got fed up with armed militias and civil wars, and personal arms were banned. The #socialcontract came to include, alongside other civil safeguards - freedom and liberty, limited political power, representation, safety nets, an independent judiciary - expectations of public safety. Fast forward, some parts of Europe, including in metropolitan cities, are no longer safe. Especially for the most vulnerable of our society. And from time to time they become lawless wastelands. They resemble little of the free, tolerant, diverse, kind, cosmopolitan Europe we envision and desire. This, of course, is a tragedy of the commons, a failure of irresponsible policy, undermining the very principles of a safe, shared, liberal society.\n\nThe ICJ just shows how broken the international court and the UN are, they stop fulfilling their role as peacekeepers and international and human rights protectors long time ago, by getting short to call for the complete cease fire in Gaza and to protect human lives. Is a reality we all live these days that no organization can protect society against the powerful and rich countries around the world. Everything is a sham a false, the best proof is the Presiding judge is there to look for the US and UK interest not to serve and interpret the law, she is and American judge place there by US and is subservient to US, she is bias and in the pocket of US and UK. They don't have any shame or honor ...If I was a Head of state of any country I walk away for that Circus and focus to run my country without any external interventions, because is no such thing of international law, the law if for some and not to others and that is not law. Remember Law and Justice are two different things. U.S. President George Bush signed into law the American Servicemembers Protection Act of 2002, which is intended to intimidate countries that ratify the treaty for the International Criminal Court (ICC). The new law authorizes the use of military force to liberate any American or citizen of a U.S.-allied country being held by the court, which is located in The Hague. In addition, the law provides for the withdrawal of U.S. military assistance from countries ratifying the ICC treaty and restricts U.S. participation in United Nations peacekeeping unless the United States obtains immunity from prosecution. At the same time, these provisions can be waived by the president on \"national interest\" grounds. Know what moral grounds America and allies have to complain about South Africa for calling Israel a genocidal state, when most his allies and itself are historically committing genocide and atrocities against humanity for decades and some even centuries. America. Germany, France, UK, Italy, etc. are the corrupt power elite that are calling the shots, and the international order is had been demolished by the Powerful and Neo-colonialist countries driven by their greed and control. \"The states that have ratified this treaty are trying to strengthen the rule of law,\""
