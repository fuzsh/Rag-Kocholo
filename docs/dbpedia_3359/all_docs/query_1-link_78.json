Hayworth, one of America's most outspoken and eloquent conservative spokesmen. J. D. has walked the border and seen firsthand the devastation that illegal immigration inflicts on law-abiding Americans. He's read the intelligence reports, talked to the Border Patrol and the Marines, and knows how intolerable illegal immigration is in a post-9/11 world.\n\nIn Whatever It Takes, you'll learn how illegal immigration steals jobs from American workers and reduces their pay, how illegal immigrants often take advantage of health and education benefits at the expense of American citizens, how illegal immigrants are hastening the downfall of Social Security, and how can we prevent the next 9/11.\n\nJ. D. Hayworth has served Arizona’s fifth congressional district (which includes Phoenix, Scottsdale and Tempe) for more than a decade. A former radio news commentator and sports anchorman, he remains a sought-after speaker and media personality, appearing frequently on such shows as Hannity & Colmes, the O’Reilly Factor, the Laura Ingraham Show, Scarborough Country, Imus in the Morning, and the G. Gordon Liddy Show. He lives with his family in Scottsdale, Arizona."
