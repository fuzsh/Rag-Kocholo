Small corner creases to several pages. John David Hayworth Jr. (born July 12, 1958) is an American television host and former politician. He served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1995 to 2007 from Arizona's 5th Congressional District. He currently hosts Newsmax Prime, a television news/talk prime time show that airs weekdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time and 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Newsmax TV. Previously, he hosted a conservative talk radio program on KFYI in Phoenix until January 2010, when he resigned due to his run for the U.S. Senate. In 1994, Hayworth was elected to represent Arizona's 6th congressional district, which was redistricted into the 5th District starting in the 2002 House elections. Hayworth was unsuccessful in his race against U.S. Senator John McCain for the Republican nomination to represent Arizona in the U.S. Senate in 2010. Whatever It Takes is a wide-ranging and highly entertaining read, in which Congressman J. D. Hayworth exposes the ongoing battle where terrorists seek ways to exploit our porous borders and attack our homeland as well as the hypocrisy, greed, and political correctness that could literally destroy our nation. What should we do to solve America's border crisis? J. D. has walked the border and seen firsthand the devastation that illegal immigration inflicts on law-abiding Americans. He's read the intelligence reports, talked to the Border Patrol and the Marines, and knows how intolerable illegal immigration is in a post-9/11 world. In Whatever It Takes, you'll learn how illegal immigration steals jobs from American workers and reduces their pay, how illegal immigrants often take advantage of health and education benefits at the expense of American citizens, and how illegal immigrants are hastening the downfall of Social Security."
