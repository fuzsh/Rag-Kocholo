        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nThe ability to turn during ambulation is impaired among patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD)1-7. These alterations in turning have been related to falls and to freezing of gait (FOG)1,4,8,9. Advancing the understanding of turns in PD may, therefore, provide new insights into a common, everyday motor task that is associated with two major adverse outcomes of PD.\n\nSeveral aspects of turning are altered in PD1-7. Patients with PD exhibit poorer balance and impaired segmental coordination while turning during walking, compared to healthy older adults. Although patients with PD use the same top-down sequence of segment reorientation during turning while walking as healthy older adults10, the timing of the movement of body segments differs in PD. Patients have a shortened delay between the onset of the head and shoulder reorientation and have a longer delay between the pelvis and foot reorientation. In general, patients with PD approach turns with a slower step and take slower and wider turns, with narrower and increased number of steps, and significantly decreased rotation of the trunk compared to healthy older adults. When patients with PD perform the turns, their head and upper trunk rotation occur almost concurrently instead of in a cranio-caudal sequence as in healthy older adults10,11. This concurrent movement is consistent with the clinical description of “turn en bloc”.\n\nThe successful completion of a specified motor task like a turn to sit depends on the choice and timing among the individual subtasks needed to meet the overall task requirements, as well as on the coordination and movement speed of different body segments. Using a body-fixed sensor, our group and others have extracted additional aspects of mobility tasks like the Timed Up and Go to better appreciate and quantify the heterogeneity of gait impairments among older adults12-14. Applying this approach15, we recently identified two strategies that older adults take when they turn to sit: 1) the distinct-strategy, in which turning is first completed and only then sitting begins, and 2) the overlapping-strategy, in which part of the turning and sitting take place concurrently, in an overlapping manner. In a study among 1055 community dwelling older adults without PD15, almost 80% of the subjects used the distinct-strategy and only ~20% employed the overlapping-strategy. Interestingly, a prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlapping interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) were both related to worse parkinsonian scores and poorer cognitive function among these non-PD older adults.\n\nSince patients with PD perform turns more slowly, take more steps to complete the turn, exhibit bradykinesia and, in general, have problems sequencing motor tasks, one could speculate that they would use the distinct-strategy when turning to sit, like the vast majority of healthy older adults. On the other hand, their delayed segmental coordination and the concurrent, en bloc head and trunk rotation could suggest that they might more often opt for the overlapping-strategy. The primary purpose of the present study was to determine which strategy is employed by adults with PD when transitioning from turning to sitting. In light of the known motor impairments in PD, we speculated, that once a strategy is chosen, a longer D-interval and a longer O-interval would be associated with more severe PD motor symptoms. In addition, similar to what was observed in the older adults, we anticipated that longer D-intervals and longer O-intervals would also be related to cognitive function. Moreover, like certain other aspects of gait, we expected that the strategy employed might change in response to dopaminergic medications.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nPatients with PD were almost twice as likely to choose the overlapping strategy (66%) as the distinct strategy (34%). Interestingly, the selection of the strategy was apparently not related to dopaminergic processes as the percentage of subjects who used each strategy was similar both off and on antiparkinsonian medications. Once a strategy was selected, the associations between PD symptoms, on the one hand, and the D-interval and the O-interval, on the other, were different.\n\nThe present findings are, to some degree, the opposite of what was previously observed among older adults without PD (see ). In that previous work, about 80% older adults chose the distinct strategy15, while in the present study, most PD patients used the overlapping strategy ( ). The non-PD cohort (mean age 80 yrs; 73% women) was older and was predominantly women relative to the current PD cohort. Still, even after adjusting for age and gender, the group differences persisted (p<0.001). Similar to what was observed in older adults, among those who used an overlapping strategy, longer O-intervals tended to be associated with worse PD signs, in particular, worse PIGD score as well as with rigidity, with a tendency towards an association with bradykinesia. However, in contrast to what was seen among the non-PD older adults, we found no associations with the D-interval and PD symptoms. Based on these two studies, one can suggest that the use of the overlapping-strategy is related to poorer balance and gait. Nonetheless, it is still not fully clear why the PD subjects were more likely to use the overlapping strategy.\n\nPrevious studies observed that patients with PD have impaired segmental coordination when asked to perform a 90 degree turn10,27. While healthy older adults first performed a sequential head rotation followed by an upper trunk rotation and a pelvis rotation toward the direction of movement, patients with PD rotated the head and upper trunk almost concurrently followed by the pelvis rotation. Although the specifics of the turn type differ in earlier reports and the present study, in some ways, those findings are parallel to the present findings. As suggested by the results in , this lack of segmentation may be related to poorer balance control. In other words, the ability to separate between the two motor tasks of turning and sitting might be more difficult and require better muscle and equilibrium control. Therefore, performing these two movements concurrently might be easier for those patients and, therefore, result in the overlapping strategy. In addition, patients with PD have delayed segmental coordination, as well as reduced rotation magnitude in multiple body segments compared to healthy older adults5-7,10,27,28. This may also explain in part why the patients with PD perform the turning and sitting movements concurrently when turning to sit, instead of first completing their turning and only then performing the sitting movement. Less variation and lower magnitude of the rotation of different body segments along with troubles in sequencing may reflect less control and less ability to separate the turning movement from the sitting movement which follows, and hence this may have led to a higher prevalence of the overlapping-strategy. This strategy may also be a reflection of the ‘free-fall” nature that frequently occurs when a person with PD attempts to sit from the standing position or while turning6. Patients with PD find it difficult to decelerate during the phase of the Stand-to-Sit task i.e., an impaired ability to generate eccentric muscle contractions in pelvic and lower extremities6.\n\nWhile questions remain about what contributes to the use of the overlapping strategy in PD, the present findings help us to exclude two potential mechanisms. PD is generally accompanied by mild cognitive deficits, particularly, attention and executive function29. Indeed, while Mini Mental Status Examination Scores of the patients with PD in the present study were near perfect ( ), mean scores of attention and executive function indices were below the age- and education-normed values of 100.0 (recall ). Still, multiple measures of cognitive function were not related to the choice of strategy and were not related to the duration of the D-intervals or the O-intervals. Cognitive function, i.e., cholinergic dysfunction which has been associated with cognitive deficits in PD, apparently can be ruled out as playing a key role in the present findings. Similarly, the current results show that a similar percentage of subjects choose the overlapping strategy in the off and on medication states, suggesting that dopaminergic pathways are not likely a major contributor to the choice of strategy. This lack of responsive of turning characteristic is similar to what was previously reported for other types of turns and turning features10. In addition to dopaminergic and cholinergic systems, other neural transmitters and multiple pathways are affected by PD30. By way of exclusion, one can speculate that perhaps these other factors play a role in the selection of the strategy choice. Of course, the observed behavior may reflect impairment due to multiple networks and neurotransmitters and is not likely caused by alterations of a single neurotransmitter.\n\nThe present study has several limitations. The cross sectional nature of the findings limit the ability to evaluate cause and effect and do not allow us to estimate if or how alterations in turning strategy and turning intervals change over time with disease progression and in response to non-dopaminergic based interventions. Direct comparison to a healthy matched control group is also lacking and it could be that some unknown, subtle changes in the methods (e.g., different assessors) contributed to the differences observed between the PD and healthy control groups.. Further, while there is some suggestion for the underlying mechanism (i.e., poor balance and motor control), we do not yet have a full explanation for the somewhat surprising choice of strategy taken by most individuals with PD. A recent review posited that turning deficits in PD can be divided into axial (i.e., altered segment coordination, turn en bloc) and perpendicular (e.g., shorter and more steps) and that the latter may drive the former1. Perhaps this contributed to the turning strategy. Motivated by the present findings, future work should more fully address these questions and if and how turning strategy and features can be used to monitor certain aspects of PD. In the meantime, the present findings indicate that the strategy and sequence taken by patients with PD as they transition from walking, to turning, and to a sitting position is not as exactly expected. In addition, it appears that the identification of the strategy is reliable in patients with moderate to advanced PD and that the choice of this strategy is generally not influenced by anti-parkinsonian medications. Further, the present findings join a growing body of literature which illustrates the added value of using body-fixed sensors to carefully assess movement patterns in older adults and patients with neurological impairment. Future work is needed to determine the basis for the strategy choice in PD, to more fully explicate the factors that contribute to the duration of the sequencing of turning and sitting motor tasks, and to evaluate the potential clinical utility of these measures."
