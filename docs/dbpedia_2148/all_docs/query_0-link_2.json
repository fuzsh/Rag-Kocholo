With the small number of meets today, I better have some new stats soon!\n\nGirls Adjustment: -12\n\nBoys Adjustment: -8\n\nAs always, these writeups below will shoutout someone or a team that stood out from the race. That may not be the best runner or the winning team. Perhaps a team that surprised, a runner breaking through, or a runner contributing to a team victory. Of course, if you come to me nicely and want to brag about a fellow team/competitor/teammate, let me know, and I’ll try to give them love further down the line.\n\nSPARTAN STUDS\n\nTessa Bruns, Marquette\n\nGotta love Upper Peninsula teams coming down here and running races. I wish more Lower Peninsula teams returned the favor. Beautiful fall weather, excellent air, hilly training grounds. Perhaps that’s a reason the Redwomen came down here and won the D1 race. Another was Tessa, moving up 20+ spots from the mile to the finish, clinching a single point win.\n\nEva Thompson, Croswell-Lexington\n\nShe’s dropped time in each race this year, time descending from 20:40 onto this 19:12. The defending regional champ and currently ranked #1 in Region 17, both in terms of time and my rankings. Her Cros-Lex teammates followed her lead as well, beating a number of ranked teams on the way to a 2nd place finish in the D2 race.\n\nElijah Forbord, Brighton\n\nThe Bulldogs took it out HARD and just had enough real estate to beat Northville. The clincher was Elijah as Brighton’s 6th man. The kid only hit a 30+ second season best and his 16:33 was more than a minute faster than last year’s effort.\n\nOwen Brown, Hanover-Horton\n\nThe Summer Preview had the Comets as the 11th team in D3, and as is tradition, H-H is outperforming those rankings. A big part of that has been Owen, who’s already hitting the form he showed late last season. Two consecutive sub-18’s, with the 17:56 yesterday being 80+ seconds faster than his 2022 race.\n\nGIRLS TEAM RATINGS\n\n*** = State Title worthy effort\n\n** = Top-10 worthy effort\n\nBOYS TEAM RATINGS\n\nGIRLS INDIVIDUAL RATINGS"
