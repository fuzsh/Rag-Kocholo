Pictures. The franchise also includes comic books, short films, novels, and video games. The DCEU, much like the original DC Universe in comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.\n\nWarner Bros. had plans to bring various DC Comics superheroes together in films since 2002, when Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a crossover of the Batman and Superman film franchises. After a planned Justice League film was put on hold and the success of The Dark Knight in 2008, Warner Bros. decided to focus on individual franchises but began to start building a shared universe to compete with Marvel Studios' Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2011. The DCEU was originally planned to center around five films directed by Zack Snyder, but DC Films downplayed the shared nature of the universe in order to allow greater autonomy for the individual filmmakers in 2018.\n\nThe first DCEU film is Man of Steel (2013), a reboot of the Superman film series, followed by Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), which served as a reboot of the Batman film series. These films were followed by Suicide Squad (2016), Wonder Woman (2017), Justice League (2017), Aquaman (2018), Shazam! (2019), Birds of Prey (2020), Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), and The Suicide Squad (2021). The franchise will continue with Black Adam, The Flash, and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom in 2022, and Shazam! Fury of the Gods in 2023. Additionally, the DCEU expanded to exclusive releases on the streaming service HBO Max with Zack Snyder's Justice League in 2021, and will continue with the television series Peacemaker and the film Batgirl in 2022. The studio also has a number of films scheduled for their 2022–2023 film slate, including: Blue Beetle, Green Lantern Corps, Static Shock and Supergirl.\n\nThe DCEU is the eleventh-highest-grossing film franchise of all time, having grossed over $5.8 billion at the global box office. Its highest-grossing film, Aquaman, earned over $1.15 billion worldwide and became the highest-grossing DC Comics-based film to date. The DCEU has received a generally mixed critical response.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nUpon announcement of the film series, the universe was commonly called the \"DC Cinematic Universe\" by fans and the media, in keeping with the naming convention of the already established Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).[1][2][3] Keith Staskiewicz, writing for Entertainment Weekly, jokingly coined the term \"DC Extended Universe™\" in an article about Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice on July 1, 2015.[4][5] This term and the abbreviation DCEU quickly spread among the press and fans thinking of it as the official name of the franchise over the following years.[6][7] According to Vulture writer Abraham Riesman, DC confirmed to him in September 2017 that the term was not used internally and they did not consider it official.[5] In 2016, as part of DC Films Presents: Dawn of the Justice League, both Geoff Johns and Kevin Smith referred to the franchise's name as being the \"Justice League Universe\".[8] During the DC Films panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2018, a video banner displayed the words \"Welcome to the Worlds of DC\", after showcasing some upcoming films. As a result, some media outlets interpreted this as DC officially naming their shared film universe as the \"Worlds of DC\".[9][10] However, in March 2020, Jim Lee referred to the franchise as the DC Extended Universe at C2E2.[11] The franchise was officially titled DC Extended Universe when the WarnerMedia streaming service HBO Max launched the following May.[12]\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nFilm[]\n\nIn 2002, Wolfgang Petersen was set to direct a Batman vs. Superman film from a script by Akiva Goldsman.[13] Warner Bros. canceled development to focus on individual Superman and Batman projects after J. J. Abrams submitted another draft for Superman: Flyby.[14][15] In February 2007, Warner Bros. hired husband and wife duo Michele and Kieran Mulroney to write a script for a Justice League film.[16] Christian Bale, who starred as Batman in Batman Begins (2005), was not approached to reprise the role,[17] nor was Brandon Routh, who starred as Superman in Superman Returns (2006).[18] George Miller was hired to direct the film,[19] reportedly titled Justice League Mortal,[20] with Armie Hammer cast as Batman, D. J. Cotrona as Superman, Adam Brody as Flash, Santiago Cabrera as Aquaman, Common as Green Lantern, Megan Gale as Wonder Woman, Hugh Keays-Byrne as Martian Manhunter and Jay Baruchel as Maxwell Lord.[21] The project was put on indefinite hold in January 2008, after failing to secure tax breaks for filming in Australia, as well as the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike preventing progress on the script.[22]\n\nIn 2013, a reboot of the Superman franchise, Man of Steel, was set to lay the groundwork for future DC films.[23] The film contained references to other characters in the DC Universe, so if it were a success, it could launch a shared universe.[24][25] Days before Man of Steel's release in June, it was reported that director Zack Snyder and screenwriter David S. Goyer would be returning for a sequel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.[26] In July, at San Diego Comic-Con, it was revealed that the sequel would include Batman in a main role, establishing the shared universe.[27][28] In October 2014, Warner Bros. announced a slate of ten DC films.[29]\n\nWhile the rival Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) includes television productions, DC's crossover series is a shared continuity for films. Several television series featuring DC characters and storylines have their own shared continuity, known as the Arrowverse.[30] DC's chief creative officer Geoff Johns explained DC's difference in approach to Marvel Studios and their cinematic universe, saying, \"We look at it as the multiverse. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach.\"[31] In June 2015, Warner Bros. president of creative development Greg Silverman expanded on DC's approach to their cinematic universe, saying, \"We ... take these beloved characters and put them in the hands of master filmmakers and make sure they all coordinate with each other. You'll see the difference when you see ... the things that we are working on.\"[32]\n\nIn May 2016, following criticism of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, Warner Bros. established a DC Films division with Geoff Johns and Warner Bros. executive vice president Jon Berg as its heads,[33] which oversees production to form a cohesive creative direction for the franchise.[34][35] DC Films would not be fully autonomous, as Johns reported to DC president Diane Nelson and Berg reported to Silverman.[34] Charles Roven was also moved from his day-by-day producer role on future DC films, which he had served since 2005's Batman Begins, to an administrative executive producer role.[36] In December, Silverman was ousted from his role in Warner Bros., and Toby Emmerich was promoted to president and chief content officer, in his place.[37] By January 2017, Johns and Berg reported to Emmerich.[38] Following the financial and critical success of Wonder Woman in June 2017, Johns stated that moving forward the films will focus on the heart, humor, hope, heroics, and optimism of the characters.[39] As a result of Justice League's underperformance at the box office, Berg was fired in January 2018 and became a production partner with Roy Lee.[40][41] DC also sought to deemphasize the shared nature of their films, with Diane Nelson stating, \"Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall storyline or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them.\"[42]\n\nIn January 2018, Walter Hamada was appointed the President of DC Films and co-runner of the DCEU, replacing Berg.[41] The following month, Chantal Nong was named Vice President of DC Films.[43] The pair were hired to oversee the franchise with Johns, as the key production team managers.[41] However, Johns was fired from his executive roles at DC in June 2018. He created a production company, Mad Ghost Productions, to have a greater hands-on role in various DC media as a writer and producer.[44] After the financial success of Aquaman, Warner Bros. CEO Kevin Tsujihara said the upcoming slate of DC films would be focused on individual character stories instead of interconnectivity.[45] In 2021, WarnerMedia reversed course and announced that future films would once again be interconnected.[46][47]\n\nTelevision[]\n\nIn August 2020, following the conclusion of the Arrowverse's sixth annual crossover event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Hamada revealed prior to \"Crisis\", DC had been structured in a way that the television division had to clear the use of characters with the film division. Now, the company could \"really lean into this idea of [the multiverse] and acknowledge the fact there can be a Flash on TV and one in the movies, and you don't have to pick one or the other, and they both exist in this multiverse\". Berlanti agreed, feeling that \"moving forward, there's more opportunity to do more things like this\".[48]\n\nIn May 2020, a new streaming service named HBO Max, launched with partnerships with WarnerMedia, DC Films, and The CW. In September, HBO-Max ordered an eight-episode series titled Peacemaker with James Gunn and Peter Safran set to executive produce the series and John Cena reprising his role as the titular character from The Suicide Squad.[49] In January 2021, Gunn said he was open to producing more spin-offs to The Suicide Squad beyond Peacemaker.[50] In February, HBO Max began developing various series based on the individual team members of the Justice League Dark. The streaming service's plan is to do so in a similar fashion to Marvel Television/Netflix released individual shows centered around The Defenders, and culminated with the team up miniseries. The first series will center around John Constantine, and will feature the character at a younger age,[51] while the studios are looking for a \"non-white\" actor to portray the character.[52] In June 2021, a series centered around Madame Xanadu entered development from Angela Robinson and Abrams.[53] A film centered around Zatanna is in development set in the Justice League Dark line from a screenplay by Emerald Fennell.\n\nFilms[]\n\nFilm U.S. release date Director Screenwriter(s) Story by Producer(s) Man of Steel June 14, 2013 ( ) Zack Snyder David S.

Raised by his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent, Clark adopts the persona \"Superman\", and learns if his abilities are meant to maintain peace or conquer the world.[58]\n\nDuring story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context.[59] Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio,[60] who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight.[61][62] Zack Snyder was hired in October 2010 to direct the film.[63] In January 2011, Henry Cavill was cast as Clark Kent / Superman.[64] Other cast members included Amy Adams as Lois Lane,[65] Michael Shannon as the villain General Zod,[66] Diane Lane as Martha Kent,[67] Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent,[68] Russell Crowe as Jor-El,[69] and Laurence Fishburne as Perry White.[70] Principal photography began on August 1, 2011.[71] Man of Steel released in North America on June 14, 2013.[72]\n\nBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)[]\n\nGotham City-based vigilante Batman travels to Metropolis to preemptively combat Superman, fearing what would happen if the latter is kept unchecked, while another threat endangers humankind.[73]\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported that Snyder and Goyer would be returning for a sequel to Man of Steel, which was being fast-tracked by Warner Bros.[26] Nolan was involved in an advisory role as executive producer.[74] In July, at the San Diego Comic-Con, Warner Bros. announced that Superman and Batman would meet for the first time in a cinematic format in the film, which would be the follow-up to Man of Steel and a reboot of the Batman film series.[27][28] According to Snyder, the film took inspiration from the comic The Dark Knight Returns.[75] Cavill, Adams, Lane, and Fishburne reprised their roles.[76] In August, Ben Affleck was cast as Bruce Wayne / Batman.[77] In December, Gal Gadot was cast as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman, marking the character's first appearance in a live-action theatrical film.[78] Later in the month, Chris Terrio was hired to rewrite Goyer's script.[79] In January 2014, the film was delayed from its July 17, 2015, release date to May 6, 2016, to give the filmmakers \"time to realize fully their vision, given the complex visual nature of the story\".[80] Later that month, Jesse Eisenberg and Jeremy Irons joined the cast as Lex Luthor and Alfred Pennyworth, respectively.[81] In May 2014, the film's title was revealed to be Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[82] Initial filming occurred on October 19, 2013, at East Los Angeles College,[83] before full principal photography began on May 21, 2014, in Detroit.[84] Production also took place in Illinois, New Mexico, Africa and the South Pacific.[84][85] After another date change, the film was released in North America on March 25, 2016.[86]\n\nThe film is set 18 months after the events of Man of Steel.[87] Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice introduced Ezra Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash,[88] Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman,[76] Ray Fisher as Victor Stone / Cyborg,[89] and Joe Morton as Dr. Silas Stone.[90] The film also introduced Steppenwolf, who served as the main antagonist in Justice League, through a brief scene.

Suicide Squad was released in North America on August 5, 2016.\n\nThe film is set after the events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[102] Affleck as Bruce Wayne / Batman and Miller as Barry Allen / The Flash made appearances in the film.[102] In a mid-credits scene, Waller meets Wayne in a restaurant and hands him a dossier containing information on future members of the Justice League.[103]\n\nWonder Woman (2017)[]\n\nMain article: Wonder Woman (2017 film)\n\nDiana of Themyscira, an Amazon warrior who also is the demigoddess daughter of the god Zeus, uses her talents and abilities in order to help humanity during World War I.\n\nIsraeli actress and model Gal Gadot was cast as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman in December 2013 and signed a three-picture deal which included a solo film.[78][104] In October 2014, Wonder Woman was announced by Warner Bros.[29] In November, Michelle MacLaren was confirmed to direct the film from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs.[105][106] In April 2015, MacLaren left the project due to creative differences.[107] Later that month, Patty Jenkins was announced as the new director of the film.[108] In July, Chris Pine was cast as Steve Trevor.[109] Other cast members include Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Robin Wright as General Antiope, Danny Huston as Erich Ludendorff, Elena Anaya as Doctor Poison, and David Thewlis as Ares.[110][111] Filming began in November 2015, and was shot in the United Kingdom, France and Italy.[112] Wonder Woman was released in North America on June 2, 2017.\n\nJustice League (2017)[]\n\nMain article: Justice League (film)\n\nMotivated by Superman's death at the hands of Doomsday, Batman and Wonder Woman assemble a team of metahumans to stop the threat of Steppenwolf, who is in search of three Mother Boxes scattered across Earth.[113]\n\nIn June 2013, it was reported that Goyer would be writing Justice League as part of a three-film deal he signed for Man of Steel.[26] In April 2014, it was announced that Snyder would return as director.[114] The film was announced in October as Justice League Part One.[29] In March 2016, it was confirmed that Chris Terrio had written the script, who said that the film would not be as tonally dark as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.[115] In June, Geoff Johns announced that the title had been changed to simply Justice League.[116] Affleck, Cavill, Gadot, Momoa, Miller, Fisher, Irons, Lane, Adams, Eisenberg, Nielsen, Wright, and Morton reprised their respective roles from previous films.[117][118][119] Ciarán Hinds provides the voice and performance capture for Steppenwolf.[120] Beginning on April 11, 2016, filming took place at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden, in England, as well as locations around London and in Iceland.[121] Filming concluded in October 2016.[122] In May 2017, Snyder stepped down from his duties on the film due to his daughter's death; Joss Whedon filled his position on post-production, with additional scenes being written and directed by him.[123] Though Whedon was not officially credited for his role as post-production director, he completed enough additional work for a screenwriting credit on the film.[124] Justice League was released worldwide on November 17, 2017.[121]\n\nJustice League introduced various characters, including J. K. Simmons as James Gordon,[125] Amber Heard as Mera,[126] and Billy Crudup as Henry Allen.[127] Additionally, Joe Manganiello as Slade Wilson / Deathstroke was also introduced in a post-credits scene, teasing an alliance between him, Lex Luthor,[128] and possibly the Legion of Doom.

Arguments were made that Snyder's vision would be more cohesive to the previous films than the actual theatrical cut, which Snyder has refused to see. Warner Bros. initially remained silent regarding any intention of making a \"Snyder Cut\".[131]\n\nIn March 2019, Snyder confirmed his original cut does exist, and stated that it is up to Warner Bros. to release it.[132] Despite this, in November, Variety reported that Warner Bros. was unlikely to release Snyder's version of Justice League in theaters or on HBO Max, calling it a \"pipe dream\".[133] In December, however, Snyder posted a photo in his Vero account, which showed boxes with tapes labeled \"Z.S.

Abrams' Bad Robot Productions announced that the project would be redeveloped as a series for HBO Max, with Abrams serving as an executive producer.[412] According to Variety, Justice League Dark will likely premiere after the individual team members are introduced in their own series, similar to how Marvel Television's Netflix series individually premiered before crossing over in The Defenders (2017).[51]\n\nMadame X: In June 2021, a series focusing on Madame Xanadu entered early development at HBO Max.

Fisher expressed his desire for Zack Snyder to direct the film,[427] and pitched plot elements including the Phantom Limbs as the primary antagonists of the film.[428] Cyborg was scheduled to be released on April 3, 2020,[365] but was later delayed.[366] In April 2020, Fisher confirmed that development on the project continued;[429] though by 2021, amidst a dispute between the actor and Warner Bros. Pictures regarding an investigation in the reshoot process on Justice League, he stated that he would not play the role in any film that has Hamada's involvement.[430][431] DC Films responded by stating that they will not recast the role.[432] Fisher later commented that he would only reprise the role if Zack Snyder's cancelled Justice League sequel was to be revived.[433] In March 2021, Fisher said that he is not opposed to reprising the role in future DCEU films, with the actor preferring Cyborg be directed by Snyder or Rick Famuyiwa.[434]\n\nDeathstroke : In October 2017, a film centered around Slade Wilson / Deathstroke was announced to be in development with Gareth Evans attached as screenwriter and director from a story by Joe Manganiello,[435] who was also set to reprise his role from Justice League.[436] The project was greenlit after Evans impressed executives with his pitch.[436] By April 2020, Evans was no longer in negotiations to work on the project, stating that he had never been contractually involved with its development. He described the story as a \"dark\" and \"unforgiving\" origin story, similar to Korean noir films.[437][438][439] In December 2020, after reprising the role in Zack Snyder's Justice League, Manganiello stated he and Snyder were working on projects featuring Deathstroke.[440] In March 2021, after numerous delays, Manganiello confirmed that Deathstroke had been canceled because Warner Bros. did not consider it a priority.[435] Manganiello stated that he wrote a \"human and grounded\" revenge backstory for the character, while preparing for the role in Justice League and Ben Affleck's The Batman.[441] He had spent six months writing the script outline for the film that was pitched to the studio; with details including the character's time in the U.S. Military, his connection to the League of Shadows,[441] as well as the characters Talia al Ghul, William Wintergreen, his wife Adeline Kane, and their children.[442] The story included the events that would lead to the character's role in Affleck's film where he exacts revenge on Batman, who he blames for the death of his son.[440] Manganiello noted that a revival was possible.[435] Shortly after the release of Snyder's Cut of Justice League, a social media campaign was started as an attempt to persuade Warner Bros. to continue with the project.[443] In April 2021 during Justice Con, Manganiello stated that the first project featuring the character that he is hoping gets greenlit is an origin story reworked as a series and released exclusively on HBO Max.[444]\n\nGreen Lantern : Originally, the 2011 Green Lantern film was planned to be the first film in a shared DC cinematic universe. However, its planned sequels were canceled in September 2011[445] and the film was eventually left out of continuity due to its critical and financial disappointment.[446] Despite this, Sinestro actor Mark Strong incorrectly referred to it as \"part of the DCEU\" in February 2019.[447] The character is scheduled to be rebooted for the franchise continuity in Green Lantern Corps. currently in development. Later, Zack Snyder considered having Ryan Reynolds return to play an \"additional lantern...to fill out the corps\" in his 2021 director's cut of Justice League.[448][449] The film would eventually be retroactively established to be set on the world of Earth-12 in the Arrowverse crossover event \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\".[450]\n\nHarley Quinn vs. the Joker : In July 2017, a film featuring Harley Quinn and the Joker was announced to be in development with the working title of \"Harley Quinn vs. the Joker\", scheduled to begin production after The Suicide Squad.[451][452] Glenn Ficarra and John Requa were hired as co-writers, co-directors, and co-producers.[453] In September 2018, Ficarra and Requa said that the script was completed and submitted to Warner Bros., and that production would commence after Birds of Prey. The story would have explored the toxic relationship of the characters, combining the tones of Ficarra and Requa's previous works Bad Santa and This Is Us.[454] The film was canceled by February 2019.[455]\n\nUntitled Joker film: In June 2018, a film featuring the Joker entered early development. Jared Leto would have served as an executive producer in addition to reprising his role as the Joker, as well as being involved with hiring the film's production crew. The film was intended to \"pave the way\" for all other Suicide Squad-related projects.[456] By February 2019, the film had been canceled, and a Joker film unrelated to the DCEU was released later that year.[455]\n\nJustice League sequels: In October 2014, Justice League Part Two was announced, with Snyder returning as director.[29] In June 2016, Deborah Snyder revealed that Justice League would not be one film split in two.[457] The film was scheduled to be released on June 14, 2019, but production was pushed back to accommodate The Batman.[458] Joss Whedon, the director of Justice League's reshoots, would eventually rework one of the film's post-credit scenes in order to tease the Injustice League as villains of a possible sequel.[459] In October 2017, J. K. Simmons stated that work on the script was in-progress,[460] while in December, Variety reported that there were \"no immediate plans\" for Snyder to return as director.[40] Before his departure from DC Films, Snyder originally intended for the sequel to focus on the League's battle against the Injustice League, which would have consisted of Lex Luthor, Doctor Poison, Captain Cold, the Riddler, Ocean Master and Black Manta. The conflict would have resulted in the deaths of Wonder Woman and Aquaman. The film would have ended with Darkseid invading Earth and killing a pregnant Lois Lane, which would have made Superman susceptible to the Anti-Life Equation.[461] By 2019, Warner Bros. had prioritized standalone films over the project, although Patty Jenkins noted she would be open to directing the next Justice League film.[45][311][390] Zack Snyder's Justice League was considered \"a storytelling cul-de-sac\", with no sequels planned.[320] Snyder said that he did not \"have any expectation that there would be more movies than this. If that happened, that would be amazing — but that bridge is far away.\"[462] He would later add that Warner Bros. had \"no appetite or interest\" to have him direct more films.[463] In January 2021, Ray Fisher stated that he would only be willing to reprise his role as Cyborg in a future DCEU film if a Justice League sequel were to be made by Snyder.[433] The following month, Snyder said that he would return to direct the sequel if he was offered the chance.[464] In March, storyboards created for Snyder's version of the sequel were displayed at the \"Dreamscapes of Zack Snyder’s Justice League\" exhibit in Dallas.[461]′ The storyboards confirmed the existence of a second sequel, tentatively titled Justice League 2A, which was planned to be released in 2020. 2A would have been set five years after the previous film and would have saw the League using time travel to reverse Darkseid's invasion.[461] Batman would have sacrificed his life while defending Lois Lane from Darkseid in the past, eventually creating an alternate timeline where Darkseid's invasion never occurred. Twenty years in the future, the son of Clark and Lois would have become the second Batman after Bruce.[465] In August, producer Charles Roven confirmed the studio's continued interest in a Justice League sequel, however stating that it is still \"a number of years away\".[466]\n\nKrypton : In October 2014, the Man of Steel writer David S. Goyer was announced to developing a television series focused on the planet Krypton.[467] During the development, Goyer revealed that the series would use unused concepts for the planet that were created for Man of Steel.[468] In early marketing materials for the series and the first teaser that debuted at the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, the Superman logo designed for the DCEU films was used to represent the House of El, implying that the series would have been a direct prequel to Man of Steel.[469][470] During the casting process, the production crew sought an actor who resembled a young Henry Cavill to portray Seg-El, Superman's grandfather,[471] while Goyer stated that the series was planned to take place 200 years prior to the events of Man of Steel.[472] Ultimately, all connections to Man of Steel were dropped by the series' release in March 2018.[470] Executive producer Cameron Welsh would later describe the series as \"adjacent\" to both the DCEU and the Arrowverse.[473]\n\nMan of Steel sequel: By October 2014, a sequel to Man of Steel was in development.[29] In November 2016, Amy Adams stated that work had begun on the screenplay.[474] In September 2017, Matthew Vaughn announced that he was having discussions with the studio to direct the film.[475] In June 2018, Cavill revealed that he was preparing to reprise the role.[476] By March 2019, Vaughn stated that discussions with Warner Bros. had ended, and he was no longer involved with development of the film. In discussing his work on the project he revealed that it was influenced by a previous trilogy pitch from 2008 that he had co-written with Mark Millar, with Vaughn describing the project as \"a massive, uplifting, hopeful thing\".[477] In July 2019, Christopher McQuarrie said that he and Cavill had pitched a sequel idea to Warner Bros. over a year prior, with the plot having ties to Green Lantern Corps, but he moved on to other projects due to what he perceived as no movement on the films.[367] Later, Michael B. Jordan had pitched his own take on the character, but was not ready to commit due to an already busy schedule.[259] By November 2019, it was reported that Warner Bros. had entered early negotiations with J. J. Abrams about taking control of the project.[259] In December, Cavill said the future of Superman will be more faithful to the comic book source material.[478] After confirming that though his casting in The Witcher had previously interfered with his availability for the role, he also said that the same would not be the case with the show's second season.[479] In January 2020, James Gunn said that he chose directing The Suicide Squad over the next Superman film.[480] The Man of Steel sequel was no longer in development by May 2020, but Cavill entered negotiations to reprise the role in a different film.[481] Zack Snyder later stated that plans for the plot had included Brainiac and the Kryptonians who were banished to the Phantom Zone at the end of Man of Steel.[482] In July 2021, producer Charles Roven stated that there will be multiple Supermen in the DCEU going forward, including the original portrayed by Henry Cavill, referencing the multiple Batman in The Flash as a similar example.[483] Later that month, David S. Goyer stated his belief that there is more story to explore with Cavill's Superman.[484] That same month, Seven Bucks Productions president Hiram Garcia noted the potential for Cavill to appear as Superman in a future project with Johnson as Black Adam.[485]\n\nNew Gods : In March 2018, Ava DuVernay signed on to direct a film centered around the New Gods, with a script written by Kario Salem. In May 2019, DuVernay announced that she and Tom King would instead co-write the film. Darkseid was planned to be the main antagonist of the film, and the Female Furies were set to appear.[486] In May 2020, DuVernay announced that work on the fourth draft of the script was ongoing.[487] In December 2020, DuVernay said that the COVID-19 pandemic had given her and King time to dig into \"the mind and musings of Jack Kirby.\"[488] King stated that he and DuVernay wanted to honor Kirby's \"genius\" and described working on the film as \"a joy\". King said that DuVernay was focused on the emotional core of the characters and the complex relationships that Kirby wrote for them.[489] New Gods was canceled in April 2021, though Warner Bros. stated that it may be revived in the future. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the project faced difficulties due to Darkseid's role in Zack Snyder's Justice League, and Warner Bros. wanted time to pass before the character appeared again.[47] Later, DuVernay revealed that Mister Miracle, Big Barda, Granny Goodness, and Highfather would have appeared in the film.[490]\n\nThe Trench : In February 2019, Warner Bros. announced a horror-themed spin-off from Aquaman focusing on the villainous Trench kingdom. Peter Safran and James Wan were set to produce, with Noah Gardner and Aidan Fitzgerald writing the script. The film was planned to have a lower production budget than other DCEU films.[491] The following month, Safran stated that he expected the film to be released before Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.[311] In April 2021, The Trench was canceled, though Warner Bros. stated that it may be revived in the future.[47] In October, Wan revealed that Black Manta was planned to be the protagonist of the film.[492]\n\nExpanded setting[]\n\nIn October 2014, Geoff Johns explained that DC's approach to their films and television series would be different from Marvel Studios' cinematic universe, stating that their film universe and TV universes would be kept separate within a multiverse to allow \"everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world.\"[493] Johns and Jon Berg were appointed by the studio to co-run the DC Films division and oversee creative decisions, production and story arcs in order to create a cohesive overarching plot within the films. Johns left his position in June 2018 to start his own studio where he will take on a greater hands-on role with film media as a producer and screenwriter. However, he remained with the studio as a co-chairman. Berg was replaced by Walter Hamada as the president of DC Films in January 2018.[41] After the successful release of Wonder Woman (2017), DC Films decided to deemphasize the shared nature of the franchise.[42] In August 2020 however, Hamada announced plans to develop a multiverse inspired by the comics. In doing so, the studio also stated that all past, present, and future projects are a part of the same unified multiverse.[494][296][320]\n\nArrowverse[]\n\nThe DC Extended Universe was retroactively established to have connections to The CW's Arrowverse continuity via the concept of a multiverse, during Part 4 of the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" crossover. Ezra Miller reprised their role as Barry Allen in a cameo appearance alongside Grant Gustin's version of the same character. During their conversation, Miller's Barry Allen gets the idea to call himself \"The Flash\" from his alternate self and even mentions \"Victor\".[495] However, despite their cameo, the episode does not confirm the designated Earth for the DCEU characters.[496][497]\n\nMiller's cameo opened up more possibilities for crossovers between the DC films and Arrowverse. Hamada revealed prior to \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", DC had been structured in a way that the television division had to clear the use of characters with the film division. Now, the company could \"really lean into this idea of [the multiverse] and acknowledge the fact there can be a Flash on TV and one in the movies, and you don't have to pick one or the other, and they both exist in this multiverse.\"[498] Arrowverse creator and executive producer Greg Berlanti agreed, feeling that \"moving forward, there's more opportunity to do more things like this\",[499] and was open to more film characters appearing in the Arrowverse.[498] In September 2020, the TV universe was rebranded as The CWverse following the consolidation of various alternate realities in various DC Television productions into one continuity with the \"Crisis\" episode.[500]\n\nOther DC films[]\n\nIn August 2020, Hamada revealed various DC adaptations compose the cinematic DC Multiverse. Hamada stated that Joker (2019) and The Batman (2022) existed on separate Earths from each other as well as the DCEU, where Justice League takes place.[494] Andy Muschietti, director for The Flash (2022), further explained that all previous adaptations of DC Comics are a part of the multiverse: \"...all the cinematic iterations that we've seen before are valid...all that you've seen exists, and everything that you will see exists, in the same unified multiverse\".[296]\n\nIn December, Hamada confirmed the studio's plan for the franchise that will greatly explore the DC Multiverse adapting various realities with multiple incarnations of the same character being developed and released. Hamada would also describe the main DCEU as being set on one Earth, while The Batman (2022) would be set on a different Earth.[320]\n\nTimeline[]\n\nIn the DCEU, the events of the films never explicitly make their exact years known.[501] Man of Steel takes place after the events of Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 1984, which are set in 1918 and 1984, respectively. The events of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice occur 18 months after the events of Man of Steel, which follows the consequences and the emergence of aliens and metahumans such as Superman.[87] The film concludes with the death of Superman, which is emphasized in the following ensemble films, Suicide Squad and Justice League, taking place approximately one and two years later, respectively.[502]\n\nJason Momoa confirmed that Aquaman takes place right after Zack Snyder's Justice League.[166] Aquaman is followed by Shazam!, which occurs during the Christmas season of 2018.[503] Afterwards, the events of Birds of Prey are set in 2020,[210] followed by The Suicide Squad, confirmed to take place in 2021.[504]\n\nRecurring cast and characters[]\n\nFurther information: Characters of the DC Extended Universe and List of DC Extended Universe cast members\n\nList indicator(s)\n\nThis section shows characters who will appear or have appeared in three or more films in the series.\n\nAn empty, dark grey cell indicates the character was not in the film, or that the character's official presence has not yet been confirmed.\n\nA indicates an appearance through archival footage.\n\nC indicates a cameo role.\n\nE indicates an appearance not included in the theatrical cut.\n\nP indicates an appearance in onscreen photographs.\n\nU indicates an uncredited appearance.\n\nSeriesSeasonEpisodesOriginally releasedShowrunnerStatusFirst releasedLast released Peacemaker18[49]January 13, 2022 ( )[398]TBAJames GunnPost-production\n\nCharacter Released Upcoming Man of Steel Batman v Superman:\n\nDawn of Justice Suicide Squad Wonder Woman Justice League Aquaman Shazam!
