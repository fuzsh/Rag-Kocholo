        "text": "“It is always challenging to choose awards but this was an especially difficult year,” said Programming Director Andre Seward. “All of the films in our program are amazing. That being said, we want to highlight the handful of films that made the biggest impression on us.”\n\nThis year, Tallgrass Film Festival introduced the Gordon Parks Award for Black Excellence in Filmmaking, a partnership with David Parks, Cargill, The Kansas African American Museum, the Wichita Chapter NAACP, Wichita State University Office of Diversity & Inclsion and Shocker Studios.\n\nThe inaugural award of $5,000, as well as a $15,000 camera rental package from Panavision. The award was given to FINDING SALLY, directed by Tamara Dawitt, and produced by Isabelle Couture. The award was presented by jurors David Parks, Brandon Wilson, and Kate Gondwe. An Honorable Mention was awarded to Many Fires This Time: We the 100 Million, directed by Jason RA Foster and produced by Michael “Quess?” Moore and Jeremy Liu.\n\nThe 2021 DOXX Award for Outstanding Documentary, given to a documentary directed by a female-identifying filmmaker, was awarded to SUBJECTS OF DESIRE, directed and produced by Jennifer Holness. This award comes with a $5,000 cash prize.\n\nFrom the jury:\n\nPart competition film, part recollection of Black women’s history in North America, the documentary takes on a stunning array of topics around Black women and Black female beauty, from the origins of the Miss Black America pageant, to the dominant stereotypes of Black women as Mammys, Jezebels, and Sapphires, to white appropriation of traditional Black features in the age of Instagram and plastic surgery. During the course of the film, we both fall in love with the pageant contestants and their stories as well as gain knowledge from experts who provide enlightening historical and cultural context for their experiences.\n\nSubjects of Desire is a compelling antidote to the omnipresence of white beauty in Western cultural spaces. We congratulate Jennifer Holness on her powerful work and authentic authorship in the telling of this story and hope that it will be seen by many, especially our young people – especially women-identifying – the ones who need it most.\n\nThe 2021 Stubbornly Independent award, given to a narrative feature with a budget of $500,000 or less, was awarded to 18 1/2 directed and produced by Dan Mirvish. This award included a $5,000 cash prize.\n\nOur 2021 Programming Awards\n\nExcellence in the Art of Filmmaking:\n\nHonorable Mention: The Return: Life After Isis directed by Alba Sotorra Clua, Produced by Alba Sotorra Clua, Vesna Cudic, Carles Torres\n\nWinner: Cat Daddies directed by Mye Hoang, produced by Dave Boyle, Nobu Nagatsuma, Robert Bennett\n\nOutstanding Courage in Filmmaking:\n\nHonorable Mention: Forbidden to See us Scream in Tehran directed by Farbod Ardebili, produced by Victoria Razevska Hill, Soroush Arayesh, Patrick Reasonover, Sarah Jane Murray\n\nWinner: Silent River directed by Chris Chan Lee, produced by Chris Chan Lee, Robert Cho, West Liang\n\nOutstanding Woman Filmmaker:\n\nEureka directed by Miida Chu, produced by Xianqi Crystal Du\n\nOutstanding Cinematography:\n\nPoser – Logan Floyd\n\nOutstanding Screenplay:\n\nRehab Cabin written by Kate Beacom and Domenic D’Andrea\n\nOutstanding Editing:\n\nA Machine to Live In directed by Yoni Goldstein and Meredith Zielke\n\nOutstanding Animation:\n\nIn-somnia directed by Benjamin Cleveland\n\nOutstanding Rising Star:\n\nMickalia Forrester Ewen from Missing First Period\n\nOutstanding Performance:\n\nJames ‘Jimmy’ Carrozo from Moon Manor\n\nOutstanding Supporting Performance:\n\nLea DeLaria from Potato Dreams of America\n\nOutstanding Ensemble Cast:\n\nCast of Burros directed by Jefferson Stein, produced by Liz Cardenas, Russell Sheaffer\n\nOutstanding First Feature:\n\nA Sexplanation directed by Alex Liu, produced by Steven Flynn, Leonardo Neri\n\nEDA Award (Alliance of Women Film Journalists) Special Mention:\n\nMYRTLE directed by Patricia McCormack, produced by Shaheen Schliefer\n\nEDA Award for Best Female-Directed Short:\n\n1-800-D-DIRECT directed by Clare Macdonald, produced by Haley Bishop, Gemma Yates-Round\n\nEDA Award for Best Female-Directed Feature:\n\nTHIS IS NOT A WAR STORY directed by Talia Lugacy, produced by Rosario Dawson, Talia Lugacy, Noah Lang, Julian West\n\nOutstanding Documentary Feature Honorable Mention:\n\nFerguson Rises directed by Mobolaji Olambiwonnu, produced by Executive Produced by – Sandra Evers-Manly, Gigi Pritzker, Kai Bowe, TJ Martin/ Co-Executive Producers – Robert F.
