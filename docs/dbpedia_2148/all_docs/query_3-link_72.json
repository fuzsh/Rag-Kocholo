        "meta_description": "Wesley Allen Bennett Daybed shown in Antique VerdeThe charm of the Bennett day bed lies in its elegant, unhurried personality. From handsome upright supports to the camelback-style back and sloped sides, Bennett offers both relaxed comfort and style. A deep, rich finish adds substance, and carefully-worked finials, ornamental joints, and elegantly tapered feet combine to complete the iron bed's look without busying Bennett's characteristically nonchalant style. Available in all finishes See Finishes Here",

        "text": "Talia, Roslyn NY\n\nGreg, I wanted to thank you again for your patience and assistance as we negotiated the purchase of our new bed. You were very accommodating with our multiple visits and inquiries–always responding with a welcoming smile and sense of humor. We’re enjoying our new latex mattress, and thank you again for walking us through the decision process.\n\nTanya, of Cleveland, Ohio\n\nHello Greg. Just a note to let you know how pleased I am with my cabinet murphy bed from Sleepworks. Upon delivery, I was so happy to see that the persons who were delivering the bed were so kind and well spoken. They put me at ease with my concern about the bed even getting up my stairs, around the tight corner, and into the bedroom. You did say that the guys were use to tight areas. They quickly put it together and then showed me how to unfold it as well. They were great! Oh, and Greg, You were great to me when you first picked up the phone and said, Sleepworks……this is Greg. You have such a soothing voice. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you, for making my experience so wonderful and standing by your products."
