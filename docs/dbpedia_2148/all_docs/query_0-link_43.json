        "text": "Validation of Manual Muscle Testing and a Subset of Eight Muscles (MMT8) for Adult and Juvenile Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRider, Lisa G.; Koziol, Deloris; Giannini, Edward H.; Jain, Minal S.; Smith, Michaele R.; Whitney-Mahoney, Kristi; Feldman, Brian M.; Wright, Susan J.; Lindsley, Carol B.; Pachman, Lauren M.; Villalba, Maria L.; Lovell, Daniel J.; Bowyer, Suzanne L.; Plotz, Paul H.; Miller, Frederick W.; Hicks, Jeanne E.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nObjective To validate manual muscle testing (MMT) for strength assessment in juvenile and adult dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM). Methods Seventy-three children and 45 adult DM/PM patients were assessed at baseline and reevaluated 6â9 months later. We compared Total MMT (a group of 24 proximal, distal, and axial muscles) and Proximal MMT (7 proximal muscle groups) tested bilaterally on a 0â10 scale with 144 subsets of six and 96 subsets of eight muscle groups tested unilaterally. Expert consensus was used to rank the best abbreviated MMT subsets for face validity and ease of assessment. Results The Total, Proximal and best MMT subsets had excellent internal reliability (rs:Total MMT 0.91â0.98), and consistency (Cronbachâs Î± 0.78â0.97). Inter- and intra-rater reliability were acceptable (Kendallâs W 0.68â0.76; rs 0.84â0.95). MMT subset scores correlated highly with Total and Proximal MMT scores and with the Childhood Myositis Assessment Scale, and correlated moderately with physician global activity, functional disability, magnetic resonance imaging, axial and distal MMT scores and, in adults, with creatine kinase. The standardized response mean for Total MMT was 0.56 in juveniles and 0.75 in adults. Consensus was reached to use a subset of eight muscles (neck flexors, deltoids, biceps, wrist extensors, gluteus maximus and medius, quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexors) that performed as well as the Total and Proximal MMT, and had good face validity and ease of assessment. Conclusions These findings aid in standardizing the use of MMT for assessing strength as an outcome measure for myositis.

The purpose of this study is to provide a narrative review of variations in techniques, durations, and forces used in MMT putting applied kinesiology (AK) muscle testing in context and highlighting aspects of muscle testing important to report in MMT research. Method PubMed, the Collected Papers of the International College of Applied KinesiologyâUSA, and related texts were searched on the subjects of MMT, maximum voluntary isometric contraction testing, and make/break testing. Force parameters (magnitude, duration, timing of application), testing variations of MMT, and normative data were collected and evaluated. Results âBreakâ tests aim to evaluate the muscle's ability to resist a gradually increasing pressure and may test different aspects of neuromuscular control than tests against fixed resistances. Applied kinesiologists use submaximal manual break tests and a binary grading scale to test short-term changes in muscle function in response to challenges. Many of the studies reviewed were not consistent in reporting parameters for testing. Conclusions To increase the chances for replication, studies using MMT should specify parameters of the tests used, such as exact procedures and instrumentation, duration of test, peak force, and timing of application of force.

Using an explicit protocol with a structured approach to training and quality assurance of research staff, manual muscle testing (MMT) is a highly reliable method for assessing strength, using a standardized clinical examination, for patients following ARDS, and can be completed with mechanically ventilated patients who can tolerate sitting upright in bed and are able to follow two-step commands. (7, 8) This video demonstrates a protocol for MMT, which has been taught to â¥ 43 research staff who have performed >800 assessments on >280 ARDS survivors. Modifications for the bedridden patient are included. Each muscle is tested with specific techniques for positioning, stabilization, resistance, and palpation for each score of the 6-point ordinal Medical Research Council scale. Three upper and three lower extremity muscles are graded in this protocol: shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist extension, hip flexion, knee extension, and ankle dorsiflexion. These muscles were chosen based on the standard approach for evaluating patients for ICU-acquired weakness used in prior publications.

Four lay testers with limited training in MMT performed muscle tests for the selection of the bedding systems from five different mattresses and eight different pillows for 14 participants with mild sleep-related respiratory disturbances. For each participant individually, two bedding systems-one inducing stronger muscle forces and the other inducing weaker forces-were selected. The tester-participant pairs showed 85% and 100% agreement, respectively, for the selection of mattresses and pillows that induced the strongest muscle forces. The firmness of the mattress and the height of the pillow were significantly correlated with the body weight and body mass index of the participants for the selected strong bedding system but not for the weak bedding system. Finally, differences were observed between the strong and the weak bedding systems with regard to sleep-related respiratory disturbances and the percentage of slow-wave sleep. It was concluded that MMT can be performed by inexperienced testers for the selection of bedding systems.\n\nManual muscle testing and hand-held dynamometry in people with inflammatory myopathy: An intra- and interrater reliability and validity study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaschung Pfister, Pierrette; Sterkele, Iris; Maurer, Britta; de Bie, Rob A.; Knols, Ruud H.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nManual muscle testing (MMT) and hand-held dynamometry (HHD) are commonly used in people with inflammatory myopathy (IM), but their clinimetric properties have not yet been sufficiently studied. To evaluate the reliability and validity of MMT and HHD, maximum isometric strength was measured in eight muscle groups across three measurement events. To evaluate reliability of HHD, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), the standard error of measurements (SEM) and smallest detectable changes (SDC) were calculated. To measure reliability of MMT linear Cohen`s Kappa was computed for single muscle groups and ICC for total score. Additionally, correlations between MMT8 and HHD were evaluated with Spearman Correlation Coefficients. Fifty people with myositis (56Â±14 years, 76% female) were included in the study. Intra-and interrater reliability of HHD yielded excellent ICCs (0.75â0.97) for all muscle groups, except for interrater reliability of ankle extension (0.61). The corresponding SEMs% ranged from 8 to 28% and the SDCs% from 23 to 65%. MMT8 total score revealed excellent intra-and interrater reliability (ICC>0.9). Intrarater reliability of single muscle groups was substantial for shoulder and hip abduction, elbow and neck flexion, and hip extension (0.64â0.69); moderate for wrist (0.53) and knee extension (0.49) and fair for ankle extension (0.35). Interrater reliability was moderate for neck flexion (0.54) and hip abduction (0.44); fair for shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, wrist and ankle extension (0.20â0.33); and slight for knee extension (0.08). Correlations between the two tests were low for wrist, knee, ankle, and hip extension; moderate for elbow flexion, neck flexion and hip abduction; and good for shoulder abduction. In conclusion, the MMT8 total score is a reliable assessment to consider general muscle weakness in people with myositis but not for single muscle groups. In contrast, our results confirm that HHD can be recommended to evaluate\n\nThe effect of bedding system selected by manual muscle testing on sleep-related cardiovascular functions.\n\nPubMed\n\nKuo, Terry B J; Li, Jia-Yi; Lai, Chun-Ting; Huang, Yu-Chun; Hsu, Ya-Chuan; Yang, Cheryl C H\n\n2013-01-01\n\nDifferent types of mattresses affect sleep quality and waking muscle power. Whether manual muscle testing (MMT) predicts the cardiovascular effects of the bedding system was explored using ten healthy young men. For each participant, two bedding systems, one inducing the strongest limb muscle force (strong bedding system) and the other inducing the weakest limb force (weak bedding system), were identified using MMT. Each bedding system, in total five mattresses and eight pillows of different firmness, was used for two continuous weeks at the participant's home in a random and double-blind sequence. A sleep log, a questionnaire, and a polysomnography were used to differentiate the two bedding systems. Heart rate variability and arterial pressure variability analyses showed that the strong bedding system resulted in decreased cardiovascular sympathetic modulation, increased cardiac vagal activity, and increased baroreceptor reflex sensitivity during sleep as compared to the weak bedding system. Different bedding systems have distinct cardiovascular effects during sleep that can be predicted by MMT.\n\nEnvironmental assessment of MMT fuel additive.\n\nPubMed\n\nLynam, D R; Pfeifer, G D; Fort, B F; Gelbcke, A A\n\n1990-04-01\n\nMethylcyclopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl (MMT) has been shown to be an effective octane enhancer in gasoline. It is presently used in the U.S. in leaded gasoline and in Canada in both leaded and unleaded gasoline. Because MMT has a low vapor pressure and a short half-life in sunlight, it is unlikely that significant concentrations of MMT could occur in the environment as a result of its use as a gasoline additive. Greater than 99.9% of the manganese from MMT is converted into inorganic oxides of manganese during the combustion of MMT-containing gasoline. Authors of several health assessments on MMT concluded the increase in environmental levels of manganese oxides would be slight compared to the natural background levels of manganese and would present no health hazards. Studies showed that MMT usage had no effect on CO emissions, caused a slight decrease in NOx emissions, and a slight increase in HC emissions. MMT usage caused a decrease in NOx + HC emissions in one test and had no effect in another.\n\nThe Effect of Bedding System Selected by Manual Muscle Testing on Sleep-Related Cardiovascular Functions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKuo, Terry B.

EMG amplitude comparisons between individuals, muscles or days need normalization. There is no consensus on existing methods. The gold standard, maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), is not adapted to pathological populations because patients are often unable to perform an MVIC. The normalization method inspired by the isometric grade 3 of manual muscle testing (isoMMT3), which is the ability of a muscle to maintain a position against gravity, could be an interesting alternative. The aim of this study was to evaluate the within- and between-day reliability of the isoMMT3 EMG normalizing method during gait compared with the conventional MVIC method. Lower limb muscles EMG (gluteus medius, rectus femoris, tibialis anterior, semitendinosus) were recorded bilaterally in nine healthy participants (five males, aged 29.7Â±6.2years, BMI 22.7Â±3.3kgm -2 ) giving a total of 18 independent legs. Three repeated measurements of the isoMMT3 and MVIC exercises were performed with an EMG recording. EMG amplitude of the muscles during gait was normalized by these two methods. This protocol was repeated one week later. Within- and between-day reliability of normalization tasks were similar for isoMMT3 and MVIC methods. Within- and between-day reliability of gait EMG normalized by isoMMT3 was higher than with MVIC normalization. These results indicate that EMG normalization using isoMMT3 is a reliable method with no special equipment needed and will support CGA interpretation. The next step will be to evaluate this method in pathological populations. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

One neurotoxic effect of MMT in mice is seizure activity. In this study, seizures were observed in mice treated with MMT in propylene glycol or corn oil. The LD50 associated with seizure activity was lower in mice receiving MMT in propylene glycol (152 mg/kg) than in those receiving MMT in corn oil (999 mg/kg). Manganese concentrations in the brains of mice which showed seizure activity due to MMT were higher than in those that did not (2.45 micrograms/g vs. 1.14 micrograms/g for MMT treated in propylene glycol and 3.25 micrograms/g vs. 1.63 micrograms/g for MMT in corn oil). Mice treated with manganese chloride (MnCl2) showed increases in brain manganese comparable to those of the mice showing seizure activity due to MMT, but exhibited no sign of seizure activity. MMT in non-lethal seizure-inducing doses had no effect on the accumulation of 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mouse brain. However, MMT inhibited the binding of t-[3H]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate [3H]-TBOB (a ligand for the GABA-A-receptor linked chloride channel) in mouse brain membranes with an IC50 value of 22.8 microM. The data suggest that MMT (organic manganese) or a closely related metabolite and not elemental manganese itself is responsible for the seizure activity observed. The seizure activity may be the result of an inhibitory effect of MMT at the GABA-A receptor linked chloride channel.\n\nInter-Tester Reliability and Precision of Manual Muscle Testing and Hand-Held Dynamometry in Lower Limb Muscles of Children with Spina Bifida\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nMahony, Kate; Hunt, Adrienne; Daley, Deborah; Sims, Susan; Adams, Roger\n\n2009-01-01\n\nReliability and measurement precision of manual muscle testing (MMT) and hand-held dynamometry (HHD) were compared for children with spina bifida.

The study objective was to examine the relationships among ankle plantar-flexion isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), repeated single-limb heel raises (SLHRs), and MMT in people with myositis. This was a cross-sectional study with a between-group design. The ability to complete 1 SLHR determined group assignment (SLHR group, n=24; no-SLHR group, n=19). Forty-three participants with myositis (13 women; median age=64.9 years) participated. Outcome measures included MVC, predicted MVC, Kendall MMT, and Daniels-Worthingham MMT. The Kendall MMT was unable to detect significant ankle plantar-flexor weakness established by quantitative methods and was unable to discriminate between participants who could and those who could not perform the SLHR task. Ankle plantar-flexion MVC was not associated with the number of heel-raise repetitions in the SLHR group (pseudo R(2)=.13). No significant relationship was observed between MVC values and MMT grades in the SLHR and no-SLHR groups. However, a moderate relationship between MVC values and MMT grades was evident in a combined-group analysis (Ï=.50-.67). The lower half of both MMT grading scales was not represented in the study despite the profound weakness of the participants. Both Kendall MMT and Daniels-Worthingham MMT had limited utility in the assessment of ankle plantar-flexor strength. Repeated SLHRs should not be used as a proxy measure of ankle plantar-flexion MVC in people with myositis.\n\nUpdate of MMT assessment\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nMethylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT) is added to gasoline to increase its octane rating. As a metal additive with potential for widespread use and manganese (Mn) exposure implications, MMT has been the focus of numerous analyses and debates about its potential publi...\n\nPreparation and characterization of APTES modified magnetic MMT capable of using as anisotropic nanoparticles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Yingjun; Chen, Hua; Wu, Jie; He, Qin; Li, Yintao; Yang, Wenbin; Zhou, Yuanlin\n\n2018-07-01\n\nMontmorillonite (MMT) based anisotropic magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4/APTES/MMT) with high anisotropy and reliable magnetism were prepared by using Fe3O4 as magnetic nanoparticles and Î³-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (ATPES) as modifier. The characterization indicated that the interactions between Fe3O4 nanoparticles and MMT in Fe3O4/APTES/MMT were stronger than that of directly deposited on to MMT (Fe3O4-MMT) because APTES was chemically bonded to both Fe3O4 and MMT. Fe3O4/APTES/MMT had a greater Ms value (25.16 emu/g) than Fe3O4-MMT (23.71 emu/g). Also, ultrasonication was used to test the interactions between Fe3O4 and MMT. With 30 min of ultrasonication, the amount of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of Fe3O4/APTES/MMT was more than that of Fe3O4-MMT, and Fe3O4/APTES/MMT had a faster magnetic response to a magnetic field than that of Fe3O4-MMT because of enhanced interactions between Fe3O4 and MMT in Fe3O4/APTES/MMT. In addition, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were densely immobilized onto Fe3O4/APTES/MMT with a smaller average diameter, and the distribution of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of MMT was more uniform than that of Fe3O4-MMT. Fe3O4/APTES/MMT possessed stable and high magnetism, in ease of orientation and recycling in the magnetic field, and this makes it a promising candidate as anisotropic nanoparticles for use in preparing anisotropic inorganic/polymer composites and anisotropic adsorbents used in wastewater treatment. Finally, the mechanism of ATPES-modified magnetic MMT was investigated.\n\nPalpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle to repetitive nerve stimulation testing: A potential assessment indicator in patients with generalized myasthenia gravis.\n\nPubMed\n\nYan, Chong; Song, Jie; Pang, Song; Yi, Fangfang; Xi, Jianying; Zhou, Lei; Ding, Ding; Wang, Weifeng; Qiao, Kai; Zhao, Chongbo\n\n2018-02-01\n\nRepetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) is a valuable diagnostic method for myasthenia gravis (MG). However, its association with clinical severity was scarcely studied. We reviewed medical records and retrospectively enrolled 121 generalized MG patients. Sensitivity of different muscles to RNS and clinical scoring systems was evaluated. RNS testing revealed facial muscles have the highest positive rate, followed by proximal muscles and distal muscles, with the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle most sensitive. Amplitude decrement of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) in the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle is related to quantitative myasthenia gravis (QMG) scores, MG-specific manual muscle testing (MMT) scores and myasthenia gravis-related activities of daily living (MG-ADL) scores. We suggest that RNS testing of the palpebral portion of the orbicularis oculi muscle is a potential assessment indicator in patients with generalized MG. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the unmodified MMT gives low conversion of free fatty due to the limitation of acid sites in the clay structure. This work focuses on preparation of an environmental friendly catalyst from montmorillonite K10 (MMT K10) clay catalyst for the esterification of oleic acid with various alcohols. Esterification of oleic acid with alcohols has been carried out in the presence of metal exchanged MMT K10 (M-MMT K10; M = Fe3+ and Cu2+). The concentrations of both Fe3+ and Cu2+ precursors were varied at 1 M and 4 M. The effect of different alcohols used, molar ratio of reactants and catalyst loading on the esterification reaction was investigated. Among the exchanged clay catalysts, 4 M Fe-MMT K10 was found to be more active for the esterification of oleic acid with methanol. The maximum oleic acid conversion (ca. 68.5%) was achieved after 3 hours of reaction at the reaction temperature of 60 oC with molar ratio of methanol to oleic acid of 10:1 and catalyst loading of 5 wt% relative to the mass of oleic acid. The catalytic activity was found to be directly related to the amount of cation used in the modification step and BrÃ¸nsted acidity of metal exchanged MMT K10 clay catalyst.\n\nRemediation: DOE funding cut shakes MMT\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nStringer, J.\n\n1996-10-30\n\nMolten Metal Technologies (MMT; Waltham, MA) announced last week that its 1993-97 R&D contract with the Department of Energy (DOE) would provide $12 million less next year than had been projected. The company was struck an additional blow when its stock plummeted more than 50% in three days on the news. MMT says that with tightened resources it will refocus attention on two core areas: chemical and radioactive wastes. The company says construction on some of its projects will be delayed, but an MMT unit that employs a molten metal bath to destroy wastes at a Hoechst plant at BaymoreÂ Â» City, TX and a planned unit at Celanese Mexicana`s Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz plant will go ahead. Those projects are slated to be completed by the end of 1997 and 1999, respectively.Â«Â less\n\nCardiorespiratory function in stable methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeichtahl, Harry; Wang, David; Cunnington, David; Kronborg, Ian; Goodman, Cathy; Prodromidis, Andy; Drummer, Olaf\n\n2004-01-01\n\nPatients in methadone maintenance programmes (MMT) often smoke tobacco and cannabis and many have ongoing illicit drug use. There is therefore potential for these patients to have abnormal cardiorespiratory function; however, few studies address this in stable MMT patients. We assessed resting cardiorespiratory function on 50 stable MMT patients (25 males, 25 females). Forty-six MMT patients were current tobacco smokers, 19 were current cannabis users and none were currently using opioids other than prescribed methadone. We defined abnormalities of respiratory function as those results outside the 95% confidence interval of reference values for normal subjects adjusted for age, weight, height and sex. Thirty-one (62%) MMT patients had reduced carbon monoxide transfer factor (D(L)CO); 17 (34%) had elevated single breath alveolar volume (V(A)) and 43 (86%) had a reduced D(L)CO/V(A) ratio. Six patients (12%) had reduced FEV1; one (2%) had reduced FVC; and nine (18%) had an obstructive ventilatory defect. Ten (20%) patients had PaCO2 higher than 45 mmHg and 14 (28%) had alveolar to arterial oxygen gradient (A-aPO2) higher than 15 mmHg. CXR, Echocardiography and ECG showed no significant abnormalities. We conclude that stable MMT patients have abnormalities of resting respiratory function which may be due to ongoing tobacco cigarette and current or past cannabis smoking.\n\nManufacturing Methods & Technology (MMT) Project Execution Report\n\nDTIC Science & Technology\n\n1982-10-01\n\nmanagers.

The effect of muscle tone on ankle kinetics when walking with an AFO remains unknown. Objectives To investigate the effect of plantar flexion (PF) muscle tone on ankle plantar flexion torque during walking with an ankle-foot orthosis Methods The study included 80 participants with first-ever stroke whose manual muscle testing (MMT) of ankle DF 0-4, and 10 healthy subjects. Participants were instructed to walk on a treadmill, at a comfortable speed, wearing an instrumented AFO. Minimum PF torque during the last half of swing was extracted as an outcome measure. Resistive PF torques during passive slow and fast stretches were measured with a custom-built device, with torques at 10Â° DF (T10Â°-slow and T10Â°-fast) extracted as defining parameters for stiffness and muscle tone, respectively. Results Correlations between both T10Â°-slow and T10Â°-fast variables with minimum PF torque were fair among ankle DF MMT 0-3 groups (rÂ =Â 0.71 -0.74, pÂ <Â 0.01), with no correlation observed among the MMT 4 group and healthy subjects. Conclusions Effects of muscle tone on ankle kinetics during swing phase, with an AFO, were observed in persons with severe ankle DF paresis. Quantitative evaluation of ankle kinetics during gait with an AFO in addition to evaluation of muscle tone at rest is contributory to objective assessment of a muscle tone, not subjective rating scale at rest, or visual inspection of walking.\n\nImplementation and on-sky results of an optimal wavefront controller for the MMT NGS adaptive optics system\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPowell, Keith B.; Vaitheeswaran, Vidhya\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe MMT observatory has recently implemented and tested an optimal wavefront controller for the NGS adaptive optics system. Open loop atmospheric data collected at the telescope is used as the input to a MATLAB based analytical model. The model uses nonlinear constrained minimization to determine controller gains and optimize the system performance. The real-time controller performing the adaptive optics close loop operation is implemented on a dedicated high performance PC based quad core server. The controller algorithm is written in C and uses the GNU scientific library for linear algebra. Tests at the MMT confirmed the optimal controller significantly reduced the residual RMS wavefront compared with the previous controller. Significant reductions in image FWHM and increased peak intensities were obtained in J, H and K-bands. The optimal PID controller is now operating as the baseline wavefront controller for the MMT NGS-AO system.\n\nQuantitatively differentiating microstructural variations of skeletal muscle tissues by multispectral Mueller matrix imaging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDong, Yang; He, Honghui; He, Chao; Ma, Hui\n\n2016-10-01\n\nPolarized light is sensitive to the microstructures of biological tissues and can be used to detect physiological changes. Meanwhile, spectral features of the scattered light can also provide abundant microstructural information of tissues. In this paper, we take the backscattering polarization Mueller matrix images of bovine skeletal muscle tissues during the 24-hour experimental time, and analyze their multispectral behavior using quantitative Mueller matrix parameters. In the processes of rigor mortis and proteolysis of muscle samples, multispectral frequency distribution histograms (FDHs) of the Mueller matrix elements can reveal rich qualitative structural information. In addition, we analyze the temporal variations of the sample using the multispectral Mueller matrix transformation (MMT) parameters. The experimental results indicate that the different stages of rigor mortis and proteolysis for bovine skeletal muscle samples can be judged by these MMT parameters. The results presented in this work show that combining with the multispectral technique, the FDHs and MMT parameters can characterize the microstructural variation features of skeletal muscle tissues. The techniques have the potential to be used as tools for quantitative assessment of meat qualities in food industry.\n\nThe effect of a jail methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) program on inmate recidivism.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcMillan, Garnett P; Lapham, Sandra; Lackey, Michael\n\n2008-12-01\n\nTo evaluate the effects of a jail-based continuation of methadone maintenance therapy (MMT) on subsequent inmate recidivism risks. Prospective, longitudinal, observational study. A large, Southwestern United States jail that continues MMT for heroin-addicted inmates on MMT at the time of booking. A total of 589 inmates booked between 22 November 2005 (the start date for the MMT program) and 31 October 2006. The outcome measure was time from release to subsequent re-booking in the jail. Predictors included binary dosing with methadone in the jail, final dose received (mg), age, gender, race/ethnicity, previous bookings and days in jail. Random effects Weibull proportional hazards models were fit to the recidivism times to estimate the impact of treatment with MMT in the jail on re-booking risks. There was no statistically significant effect of receiving methadone in the jail or dosage on subsequent recidivism risks (hazard ratio = 1.16; 95% confidence interval = 0.8-1.68). Offering jail-based MMT does not increase recidivism risks by eliminating the deterrent effect of imposed withdrawal, nor does it reduce recidivism in this high-risk population.\n\nToward first light for the 6.5-m MMT Telescope\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWest, Steve C.; Callahan, Shawn; Chaffee, Frederic H.; Davison, Warren B.; Derigne, S. T.; Fabricant, Daniel G.; Foltz, Craig B.; Hill, John M.; Nagel, Robert H.; Poyner, Anthony D.; Williams, Joseph T.\n\n1997-03-01\n\nOperated by the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory (MMTO), the multiple mirror telescope (MMT) is funded jointly by the Smithsonian Institution (SAO) and the University of Arizona (UA). The two organizations equally share observing time on the telescope. The MMT was dedicated in May 1979, and is located on the summit of Mt. Hopkins (at an altitude of 2.6 km), 64 km south of Tucson, Arizona, at the Smithsonian Institution's Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO). As a result of advances in the technology at the Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory for the casting of large and fast borosilicate honeycomb astronomical primary mirrors, in 1987 it was decided to convert the MMT from its six 1.8 m mirror array (effective aperture of 4.5 m) to a single 6.5 m diameter primary mirror telescope. This conversion will more than double the light gathering capacity, and will by design, increase the angular field of view by a factor of 15. Because the site is already developed and the existing building and mount will be used with some modification, the conversion will be accomplished for only about $20 million. During 1995, several major technical milestones were reached: (1) the existing building was modified, (2) the major steel telescope structures were fabricated, and (3) the mirror blank was diamond wheel ground (generated). All major mechanical hardware required to affect the conversion is now nearly in hand. Once the primary mirror is polished and lab-tested on its support system, the six-mirror MMT will be taken out of service and the conversion process begun. We anticipate that a 6 - 12 month period will be required to rebuild the telescope, install its optics and achieve f/9 first light, now projected to occur in early 1998. The f/5.4 and f/15 implementation will then follow. We provide a qualitative and brief update of project progress.\n\nFabrication of durable fluorine-free superhydrophobic polyethersulfone (PES) composite coating enhanced by assembled MMT-SiO2 nanoparticles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Xiguang; Wang, Huaiyuan; Liu, Zhanjian; Zhu, Yixing; Wu, Shiqi; Wang, Chijia; Zhu, Yanji\n\n2017-02-01\n\nA durable fluorine-free polyethersulfone (PES) superhydrophobic composite coating with excellent wear-resistant and anti-corrosion properties has been successfully fabricated by combining sol-gel and spray technology. The robust micro/nano-structures of the prepared surface were established by introducing binary montmorillonite-silica (MMT-SiO2) assembled composite particles, which were formed by in-situ growth of SiO2 on MMT surfaces via sol-gel. Combined with the low surface energy of amino silicon oil (APDMS), the fluorine-free superhydrophoic PES coating was obtained with high water contact angle 156.1 Â± 1.1Â° and low sliding angle 4.8 Â± 0.7Â°. The anti-wear of the final PES/APDMS/MMT-SiO2 superhydrophobic coating can reach up to 60,100 cycles, which is outdistancing the pure PES coating (6800 cycles) and the PES/MMT/SiO2 coating prepared by simple physical mixture (18,200 cycles). The enhanced wear resistance property can be mainly attributed to the lubrication performance of APDMS and stable interface bonding force between the MMT surface and SiO2. Simultaneously, potentiodynamic polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy exhibited the outstanding anti-corrosion property of PES/APDMS/MMT-SiO2 composite coating, with low corrosion current (1.6 Ã 10-10 A/cm2) and high protection efficiency (99.999%) even after 30 d immersion process. These test results show that this durable superhydrophobic PES composite coating can be hopefully to provide the possibility of industrial application.\n\nHectospec, the MMT's 300 Optical Fiber-Fed Spectrograph\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFabricant, Daniel; Fata, Robert; Roll, John; Hertz, Edward; Caldwell, Nelson; Gauron, Thomas; Geary, John; McLeod, Brian; Szentgyorgyi, Andrew; Zajac, Joseph; Kurtz, Michael; Barberis, Jack; Bergner, Henry; Brown, Warren; Conroy, Maureen; Eng, Roger; Geller, Margaret; Goddard, Richard; Honsa, Michael; Mueller, Mark; Mink, Douglas; Ordway, Mark; Tokarz, Susan; Woods, Deborah; Wyatt, William; Epps, Harland; Dell'Antonio, Ian\n\n2005-12-01\n\nThe Hectospec is a 300 optical fiber fed spectrograph commissioned at the MMT in the spring of 2004. In the configuration pioneered by the Autofib instrument at the Anglo-Australian Telescope, Hectospec's fiber probes are arranged in a radial ``fisherman on the pond'' geometry and held in position with small magnets. A pair of high-speed, six-axis robots move the 300 fiber buttons between observing configurations within ~300 s, and to an accuracy of ~25 Î¼m. The optical fibers run for 26 m between the MMT's focal surface and the bench spectrograph, operating at R~1000-2000. Hectochelle, another high-dispersion bench spectrograph offering R~35,000, is also available. The system throughput, including all losses in the telescope optics, fibers, and spectrograph, peaks at ~10% at the grating blaze in 1\" FWHM seeing. Correcting for aperture losses at the 1.5\" diameter fiber entrance aperture, the system throughput peaks at ~17%, close to our prediction of 20%. Hectospec has proven to be a workhorse instrument at the MMT. Together, Hectospec and Hectochelle have been scheduled for 1/3 of the available nights since its commissioning. Hectospec has returned approximately 60,000 reduced spectra for 16 scientific programs during its first year of operation.\n\nMegasite Management Tool (mmt): a Decision Support System Built Using Mapwindow Activex Control\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPulsani, B. R.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nMegasite Management Tool (MMT) is planning and evaluation software for contaminated sites. Using different statistical modules, MMT produces maps which help decision makers in rehabilitating contaminated sites. The input data used by MMT is of geographic nature and exists as shapefile and raster format. As MMT is built using simple windows forms application, the objective of the study was to find a way to visualize geographic data and to allow the user to edit its attribute information. Therefore, the application requirement was to find GIS libraries which offer capabilities such as (1) map viewer with navigation tools (2) library to read/write geographic data and (3) software which allows free distribution of the developed components. A research on these requirements led to the discovery of MapWindow ActiveX components which not only offered these capabilities but also provided free and open source licensing options for redistribution. Although considerable amount of reports and publications exist on MMT, the major contribution provided by MapWindow libraries have been under played. The current study emphasises upon the contribution and advantages MapWindow ActiveX provides for incorporating GIS functionality to an already existing application. Similar components for other languages have also been reviewed.\n\nMaking Metadata Better with CMR and MMT\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nGilman, Jason Arthur; Shum, Dana\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEnsuring complete, consistent and high quality metadata is a challenge for metadata providers and curators. The CMR and MMT systems provide providers and curators options to build in metadata quality from the start and also assess and improve the quality of already existing metadata.\n\nReduction of the subacromial space in athletes with and without rotator cuff tendinopathy and its association with the strength of scapular muscles.\n\nPubMed\n\nLeong, Hio Teng; Tsui, Sammi Sin Mei; Ng, Gabriel Yin-Fat; Fu, Siu Ngor\n\n2016-12-01\n\nTo compare the reduction of subacromial space (SAS) during arm abduction between overhead athletes with and without rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy, and to explore the relationship between the strength of scapular muscles with the SAS. Cross-sectional study. Sixty-six athletes (33 healthy and 33 with RC tendinopathy, mean age=22.3 years) participated in the study. Ultrasound measurement of the SAS with arm at 0Â°, 30Â° and 60Â° of shoulder abduction were taken, and the maximal isometric force in upper, middle and lower trapezius, and serratus anterior with manual muscle tests (MMT) were assessed using a handheld dynamometer. The change in SAS during arm abduction from 0Â° to 30Â° (SAS 0Â°-30Â° ), 30Â° to 60Â° (SAS 30Â°-60Â° ) and 0Â° to 60Â° (SAS 0Â°-60Â° ) was compared between groups. Differences in force produced with scapular muscles MMT between groups and relationships with reduction in SAS were explored. We found more reduction of the SAS during SAS 0Â°-30Â° in athletes with RC tendinopathy (0.44Â±1.22mm) than healthy athletes (-0.06Â±1.41mm) (p=0.045). Athletes with RC tendinopathy demonstrated significant decrease in all scapular muscles MMT strength when compared to their healthy counterparts (p<0.05). In healthy athletes, a lower middle and lower trapezius MMT strength were moderately associated with a greater reduction in SAS during 0Â° to 30Â° (r=-0.445, p=0.016 and r=-0.423, p=0.022, respectively) and 0Â° to 60Â° of shoulder abduction (r=-0.415, p=0.018 and r=-0.504, p=0.003, respectively). Athletes with RC tendinopathy demonstrated more reduction in the SAS during early arm abduction. Decreased strength of middle and lower trapezius was related to reduction of the SAS.

They also experience these complaints during mastication. To measure endurance of continuous mastication in patients with mitochondrial diseases, the 6-min mastication test (6MMT) was developed. This study included the collection of normal data for the 6MMT in a healthy population (children and adults). During 6 min of continuous mastication on a chew tube chewing cycles per minute, total amount of chewing cycles and the difference between minute 1 (M 1 ) and minute 6 (M 2 ) were collected in 271 healthy participants (5-80 years old). These results were compared with those of nine paediatric and 25 adult patients with a mitochondrial disease. Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were collected directly after the test and after 5 min. A qualitative rating was made on masticatory movements. The reproducibility of the 6MMT in the healthy population with an interval of approximately 2 weeks was good. The inter-rater reliability for the observations was excellent. The patient group demonstrated lower total amount of chewing cycles or had greater differences between M 1 and M 6 . The 6MMT is a reliable and objective test to assess endurance of continuous chewing. It demonstrates the ability of healthy children and adults to chew during 6 min with a highly stable frequency of mastication movements. The test may give an explanation for the masticatory problems in patient groups, who are complaining of pain and fatigue during mastication.

Meanwhile, spectral features of scattered light can also provide abundant microstructural information of tissues. In this paper, we take the 2D multispectral backscattering Mueller matrix images of bovine skeletal muscle tissues, and analyze their temporal variation behavior using multispectral Mueller matrix parameters. The 2D images of the Mueller matrix elements are reduced to the multispectral frequency distribution histograms (mFDHs) to reveal the dominant structural features of the muscle samples more clearly. For quantitative analysis, the multispectral Mueller matrix transformation (MMT) parameters are calculated to characterize the microstructural variations during the rigor mortis and proteolysis processes of the skeletal muscle tissue samples. The experimental results indicate that the multispectral MMT parameters can be used to judge different physiological stages for bovine skeletal muscle tissues in 24 hours, and combining with the multispectral technique, the Mueller matrix polarimetry and FDH analysis can monitor the microstructural variation features of skeletal muscle samples. The techniques may be used for quick assessment and quantitative monitoring of meat qualities in food industry.\n\nFunctional capacity and muscular abnormalities in subclinical hypothyroidism.\n\nPubMed\n\nReuters, Vaneska S; Teixeira, PatrÃ­cia de FÃ¡tima S; VigÃ¡rio, PatrÃ­cia S; Almeida, Cloyra P; Buescu, Alexandre; Ferreira, MÃ¡rcia M; de Castro, Carmen L N; Gold, Jaime; Vaisman, Mario\n\n2009-10-01\n\nNeuromuscular abnormalities and low exercise tolerance are frequently observed in overt hypothyroidism, but it remains controversial if they can also occur in subclinical hypothyroidism (sHT). The aim of this study is to evaluate neuromuscular symptoms, muscle strength, and exercise capacity in sHT, compared with healthy euthyroid individuals. A cross-sectional study was performed with 44 sHT and 24 euthyroid outpatients from a university hospital. Neuromuscular symptoms were questioned. Muscle strength was tested for neck, shoulder, arm, and hip muscle groups, using manual muscle testing (MMT). Quadriceps muscle strength was tested with a chair dynamometer and inspiratory muscle strength (IS) by a manuvacuometer. Functional capacity was estimated based on the peak of oxygen uptake (mL/kg/min), using the Bruce treadmill protocol. Cramps (54.8% versus 25.0%; P < 0.05), weakness (45.2% versus 12.6; P < 0.05), myalgia (47.6% versus 25.0%; P = 0.07), and altered MMT (30.8% versus 8.3%; P = 0.040) were more frequent in sHT. Quadriceps strength and IS were not impaired in sHT and the same was observed for functional capacity. IS was significantly lower in patients complaining of fatigue and weakness (P < 0.05) and tended to be lower in those with altered MMT (P = 0.090). Neuromuscular complaints and altered MMT were significantly more frequent in sHT than in controls, and IS was lower in patients with these abnormalities. Results suggest that altered muscle strength by MMT and the coexistence of neuromuscular complaints in patients with sHT may indicate neuromuscular dysfunction.\n\nIndividual muscle control using an exoskeleton robot for muscle function testing.\n\nPubMed\n\nUeda, Jun; Ming, Ding; Krishnamoorthy, Vijaya; Shinohara, Minoru; Ogasawara, Tsukasa\n\n2010-08-01\n\nHealthy individuals modulate muscle activation patterns according to their intended movement and external environment. Persons with neurological disorders (e.g., stroke and spinal cord injury), however, have problems in movement control due primarily to their inability to modulate their muscle activation pattern in an appropriate manner. A functionality test at the level of individual muscles that investigates the activity of a muscle of interest on various motor tasks may enable muscle-level force grading. To date there is no extant work that focuses on the application of exoskeleton robots to induce specific muscle activation in a systematic manner. This paper proposes a new method, named \"individual muscle-force control\" using a wearable robot (an exoskeleton robot, or a power-assisting device) to obtain a wider variety of muscle activity data than standard motor tasks, e.g., pushing a handle by hand. A computational algorithm systematically computes control commands to a wearable robot so that a desired muscle activation pattern for target muscle forces is induced. It also computes an adequate amount and direction of a force that a subject needs to exert against a handle by his/her hand. This individual muscle control method enables users (e.g., therapists) to efficiently conduct neuromuscular function tests on target muscles by arbitrarily inducing muscle activation patterns. This paper presents a basic concept, mathematical formulation, and solution of the individual muscle-force control and its implementation to a muscle control system with an exoskeleton-type robot for upper extremity. Simulation and experimental results in healthy individuals justify the use of an exoskeleton robot for future muscle function testing in terms of the variety of muscle activity data.\n\nComparison of In Situ Polymerization and Solution-Dispersion Techniques in the Preparation of Polyimide/Montmorillonite (MMT) Nanocomposites\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhmad, Mansor Bin; Gharayebi, Yadollah; Salit, Mohd. Sapuan; Hussein, Mohd. Zobir; Shameli, Kamyar\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn this paper, Polyimide/Montmorillonite Nanocomposites (PI/MMT NCs), based on aromatic diamine (4-Aminophenyl sulfone) (APS) and aromatic dianhydride (3,3â²,4,4â²-benzophenonetetracarboxylic dianhydride) (BTDA) were prepared using in situ polymerization and solution-dispersion techniques. The prepared PI/MMT NCs films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The XRD results showed that at the content of 1.0 wt % Organo Montmorillonite (OMMT) for two techniques and 3.0 wt % OMMT for the in situ polymerization technique, the OMMT was well-intercalated, exfoliated and dispersed into polyimide matrix. The OMMT agglomerated when its amount exceeded 10 wt % and 3.0 wt % for solution-dispersion and in situ polymerization techniques respectively. These results were confirmed by the TEM images of the prepared PI/MMT NCs. The TGA thermograms indicated that thermal stability of prepared PI/MMT NCs were increased with the increase of loading that, the effect is higher for the samples prepared by in situ polymerization technique.

This study aimed to evaluate the test-retest reliability of TMG and MMT parameters for measuring (TMG:) muscle displacement (D m ), contraction time (T c ), and velocity (V c ) and (MMT:) frequency (F), stiffness (S), and decrement (D) of the erector spinae muscles (ES) in healthy adults. A particular focus was set on the establishment of reliability measures for the previously barely evaluated secondary TMG parameter V c . Twenty-four subjects (13 female and 11 male, meanâÂ±âSD, 38.0âÂ±â12.0Â years) were measured using TMG and MMT over 2Â consecutive days. Absolute and relative reliability was calculated by standard error of measurement (SEM, SEM%), Minimum detectable change (MDC, MDC%), coefficient of variation (CV%) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC, 3.1) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The ICCs for all variables and test-retest intervals ranged from 0.75 to 0.99 indicating a good to excellent relative reliability for both TMG and MMT, demonstrating the lowest values for TMG T c and between-day MMT D (ICCâ<â0.90). Absolute reliability was suitable for all parameters (CV 2-8%) except for D m (10-12%). V c demonstrated to be the most reliable and repeatable TMG parameter (ICCâ>â0.95, CVâ<â8%). The reliability for TMG V c could be established successfully. Its further applicability needs to be confirmed in future studies. MMT was found to be more reliable on repeated testing than the two other TMG parameters D m and T c .\n\nThe impact of ultra-low amounts of amino-modified MMT on dynamics and properties of densely cross-linked cyanate ester resins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBershtein, Vladimir; Fainleib, Alexander; Egorova, Larisa; Gusakova, Kristina; Grigoryeva, Olga; Kirilenko, Demid; Konnikov, Semen; Ryzhov, Valery; Yakushev, Pavel; Lavrenyuk, Natalia\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThermostable nanocomposites based on densely cross-linked cyanate ester resins (CER), derived from bisphenol E and doped by 0.01 to 5 wt. % amino-functionalized 2D montmorillonite (MMT) nanoparticles, were synthesized and characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), far-infrared (Far-IR), and creep rate spectroscopy (CRS) techniques. It was revealed that ultra-low additives, e.g., 0.025 to 0.1 wt. %, of amino-MMT nanolayers covalently embedded into CER network exerted an anomalously large impact on its dynamics and properties resulting, in particular, in some suppression of dynamics, increasing the onset of glass transition temperature by 30Â° to 40Â° and twofold rise of modulus in temperature range from 20Â°C to 200Â°C. Contrarily, the effects became negligibly small or even negative at increased amino-MMT contents, especially at 2 and 5 wt. %. That could be explained by TEM/EDXS data displaying predominance of individual amino-MMT nanolayers and their thin (2 to 3 nanolayers) stacks over more thick tactoids (5 to 10 nanolayers) and the large amino-MMT aggregates (100 to 500 nm in thickness) reversing the composite structure produced with increasing of amino-MMT content within CER matrix. The revealed effect of ultra-low amino-MMT content testifies in favor of the idea about the extraordinarily enhanced long-range action of the `constrained dynamics' effect in the case of densely cross-linked polymer networks.\n\nPreparation and photo-catalytic activities of FeOOH/ZnO/MMT composite\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhou, Yao; Liu, Fusheng; Yu, Shitao\n\n2015-11-01\n\nMontmorillonite (MMT) was used as the carrier for synthesis of FeOOH and FeOOH/ZnO nano-material. FeOOH and FeOOH/ZnO were synthesized by the aqueous solutions of Fe(NO3)3-HNO3 and Zn(NO3)2-NaOH/Fe(NO3)3-HNO3 with the carrier of montmorillonite respectively. Transmission electron-microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were used to study the morphology form and structure of the nano-materials. TEM was also used to demonstrate that FeOOH/ZnO can be formed with the appropriate interface. According to UV-vis absorption spectra, FeOOH/ZnO has a better response to visible light than FeOOH and ZnO, which indicates there is some coupling effect between FeOOH and ZnO. Pentachlorophenol (PCP) was used as a representative organic pollutant to evaluate the photo-catalytic efficiency of the FeOOH/ZnO and FeOOH catalysts in visible light (Î» > 400 nm). The photo-catalytic efficiency of FeOOH/ZnO/MMT is better than FeOOH/MMT. According to FTIR, changes of pH and TOC, the degradation mechanism was also discussed. PCP was degraded to aromatic ketone and chloro-hydrocarbon compounds and then to H2O, CO2 and HCl.\n\nSTS-121: Discovery Launch Postponement MMT Briefing\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n2006-01-01\n\nBruce Buckingham from NASA Public Affairs introduces the panel who consist of: John Shannon, MMT chairman JSC; Mike Leinbach, NASA Launch Director; and 1st Lieutenant Kaleb Nordren, USAF 45th Weather Squadron.

Grant; Ortiz, R.; Goble, W.; Gibson, J. D.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe MMT Observatory, a joint venture of the Smithsonian Institution and the University of Arizona, operates the 6.5-m MMT telescope on the summit of Mount Hopkins approximately 45 miles south of Tucson, AZ. The upgraded telescope has been in routine operation for nearly fifteen years and, as such, is a very reliable and productive general purpose astronomical instrument. The telescope can be configured with one of three secondary mirrors that feed more than ten instruments at the Cassegrain focus. In this paper we provide an overview of the the telescope, its current capabilities, and its performance. We will review the existing suite of instruments and their different modes of operation. We will describe some of the general operations challenges and strategies for the Observatory. Finally, we will discuss plans for the near-term future including technical upgrades, new instrumentation and routine queue operation of MMIRS and Binospec.\n\nManufacturing Methods and Technology (MM&T) program. 10.6 micrometer carbon dioxide TEA (Transverely Excited Atmospheric) lasers\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLuck, C.

As compared to the corresponding Fmoc-Cys(Trt)-OH, the S-Mmt-function was found to be considerably more acid labile. Quantitative S-Mmt-removal occurs selectively in the presence of groups of the tert butyl type and S-Trt by treatment with 0.5-1.0% TFA. The new derivative was successfully utilized in the SPPS of Tyr1-somatostatin on 2-chlorotrityl resin. In this synthesis groups of the Trt-type were exclusively used for amino acid side-chain protection.

Synthesis and characterization of novel nanocomposites by interlamellar controlled/living radical copolymerization via preintercalated RAFT-agent/organoclay complexes.\n\nPubMed\n\nRzayev, Zakir M O; SÃ¶ylemez, A Ernur\n\n2011-04-01\n\nWe have developed a new approach for the synthesis of polymer nanocomposites using a bifunctional reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) agent, two types of organo-montmorillonites, such as a non-reactive dimethyldodecyl ammonium (DMDA)-MMT and a reactive octadecylamine (ODA)-MMT organoclays, and a radical initiator. The method includes the following stages: (1) synthesis of RAFT intercalated O-MMTs by a physical or chemical interaction of the RAFT agent having two pendant carboxylic groups [S,S-bis(alpha,alpha'-dimethyl-alpha\"-acetic acid)trithiocarbonate] with surface alkyl amines of O-MMT containing tertiary ammonium cation or primary amine groups through strong H-bonding and complexing/amidization reactions, respectively, and (2) utilization of these well-dispersed and intercalated RAFT ... O-MMT complexes and their amide derivatives as new modified RAFT agents in radical-initiated interlamellar controlled/living copolymerization of itaconic acid (IA)-n-butylmethacrylate (BMA) monomer pair. The structure and compositions of the synthesized RAFT ... O-MMT complexes and functional copolymer/O-MMT hybrids were confirmed by FTIR, XRD, thermal (DSC-TGA), SEM and TEM morphology analyses. It was demonstrated that the degree of interaction/exfoliation, morphology and thermal behavior of nanocomposites significantly depended on the type of organoclay and in situ interaction, as well as on the content of flexible butyl-ester linkages as a internal plasticizer. The results of the comparative analysis of the nanocomposites structure-composition-property relations show that the functional copolymer-organoclay hybrids prepared with reactive RAFT ... ODA-MMT complex and containing a combination of partially intercalated and predominantly exfoliated nano-structures exhibit relatively higher thermal stability and fine dispersed morphology. These effects were explained by in situ interfacial chemical reactions through amidization of RAFT with surface alkyl amine\n\nThe value of multiple tests of respiratory muscle strength\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSteier, Joerg; Kaul, Sunny; Seymour, John; Jolley, Caroline; Rafferty, Gerrard; Man, William; Luo, Yuan M; Roughton, Michael; Polkey, Michael I; Moxham, John\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBackground Respiratory muscle weakness is an important clinical problem. Tests of varying complexity and invasiveness are available to assess respiratory muscle strength. The relative precision of different tests in the detection of weakness is less clear, as is the value of multiple tests. Methods The respiratory muscle function tests of clinical referrals who had multiple tests assessed in our laboratories over a 6âyear period were analysed. Thresholds for weakness for each test were determined from published and inâhouse laboratory data. The patients were divided into three groups: those who had all relevant measurements of global inspiratory muscle strength (group A, nâ=â182), those with full assessment of diaphragm strength (group B, nâ=â264) and those for whom expiratory muscle strength was fully evaluated (group C, nâ=â60). The diagnostic outcome of each inspiratory, diaphragm and expiratory muscle test, both singly and in combination, was studied and the impact of using more than one test to detect weakness was calculated. Results The clinical referrals were primarily for the evaluation of neuromuscular diseases and dyspnoea of unknown cause. A low maximal inspiratory mouth pressure (Pimax) was recorded in 40.1% of referrals in group A, while a low sniff nasal pressure (Sniff Pnasal) was recorded in 41.8% and a low sniff oesophageal pressure (Sniff Poes) in 37.9%. When assessing inspiratory strength with the combination of all three tests, 29.6% of patients had weakness. Using the two nonâinvasive tests (Pimax and Sniff Pnasal) in combination, a similar result was obtained (low in 32.4%). Combining Sniff Pdi (low in 68.2%) and Twitch Pdi (low in 67.4%) reduced the diagnoses of patients with diaphragm weakness to 55.3% in group B. 38.3% of the patients in group C had expiratory muscle weakness as measured by maximum expiratory pressure (Pemax) compared with 36.7% when weakness was diagnosed by cough gastric pressure (Pgas), and 28.3% when\n\n[Impacts of antiretroviral treatment on drug use and high risk sexual behaviors among HIV-positive MMT clients].\n\nPubMed\n\nQian, Xiaoai; Cao, Xiaobin; Zhao, Yan; Wang, Changhe; Luo, Wei; Rou, Keming; Zhang, Bo; Min, Xiangdong; Duan, Song; Tang, Renhai; Wu, Zunyou\n\n2015-06-01\n\nTo explore the impacts of antiretroviral treatment on drug use and high risk sexual behaviors among HIV-positive MMT clients. A cross-sectional study was conducted in patients undergoing ART (ART-experienced) and patients not undergoing ART (ART-naive) attending MMT in 5 clinics in Yunnan Honghe and Dehong prefectures in 2014. A questionnaire was designed to collect socio-demographic characteristics, ART and MMT information and sexual and drug use behaviors within 3 months before the investigation was conducted. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the predictors for drug use and risky sexual behaviors. A total of 328 cases were included in the analysis, among which 202 were ART-experienced and 126 were ART-naÃve. Among 152 respondents who were sexually active, 61 (40.1%) reported having unprotected sex (UPS) with their regular partners in the prior 3 months. A total of 57.6% (189/328) of the respondents used drugs in the prior 3 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that younger than 35 years old (OR = 3.57, 95% CI: 1.23-10.37), fertility desire (OR = 4.47, 95% CI: 1.49-13.41), partner being HIV-positive (OR = 4.62, 95% CI: 1.80-11.86), length of MMT attendance less than 5 years (OR = 2.92, 95% CI: 1.14-7.53), agreed that it was necessary to use condom no matter the viral load is high or low (OR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04-0.51) were protective factors of UPS in the prior 3 months. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that being Han (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.24-0.89), feeling having good health status (OR = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18-0.85), being enrolled in ART (OR = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.17-0.60) were protective factors for drug use in the prior three months, having contact with drug using friends (OR = 4.41, 95% CI: 2.31-8.29), having experience of missing an MMT dose (OR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.92-6.29), and not satisfied with current MMT dose (OR = 13.92, 95% CI: 3.24-59.93) were risk factors for drug use during the prior three months.

The peroneus longus and brevis are primary evertors and secondary plantar flexors of the ankle joint. However, some international textbooks describe them as dorsi flexors, when instructing peroneal muscle testing. The identified variability raised a question whether these educational texts are reflected in the clinical field. The purposes of this study were to investigate what are the methods commonly used in the clinical field for peroneal muscle testing and to evaluate their compatibility with functional anatomy. A cross-sectional study was conducted, using an electronic questionnaire sent to 143 Israeli physiotherapists in the musculoskeletal field. The survey questioned on the anatomical location of manual resistance and the combination of motions resisted. Ninety-seven responses were received. The majority (69%) of respondents related correctly to the peronei as evertors, but asserted that resistance should be located over the dorsal aspect of the fifth metatarsus, thereby disregarding the peroneus longus. Moreover, 38% of the respondents described the peronei as dorsi flexors, rather than plantar flexors. Only 2% selected the correct method of resisting plantarflexion and eversion at the base of the first metatarsus. We consider this technique to be the most compatible with the anatomy of the peroneus longus and brevis. The Fisher-Freeman-Halton test indicated that there was a significant relationship between responses on the questions (P = 0.0253, 95% CI 0.0249-0.0257), thus justifying further correspondence analysis. The correspondence analysis found no clustering of the answers that were compatible with anatomical evidence and were applied in the correct technique, but did demonstrate a common error, resisting dorsiflexion rather than plantarflexion, which was in agreement with the described\n\nThe effect of recycled Natural Rubber Glove (rRG) Plasticizers to Deflection and Flexural Strength Properties of PP/MMt/rRG Smart Composites and Its Inflammability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSuharty, N.

The addition of rRG plasticizers will improve the deflection properties and increase the filler capacity MMt loading to reach the optimum concentration. The addition of 3% rRG is capable of loading filler capacity MMt to 23% as the optimum condition. At the optimum conditions it can increase the deflection (Defl) and flexural strength (FS) up to 16% and 15% respectively compared to that of the composites without rRG. The rRG plasticizer serves as a bio-compatibilizer that can reduce surface tension of the mixture and leads to decrease the Defl., follow by the increase of loading filler capacity and well interaction finally can increase the FS properties. The increase of loading filler MMt up to 23% can also improve the inflammability of the composites. Time to Ignition (TTI) increase by 5% and Burning Rate (BR) decrease by 4.5% compared to that of the composites which is containing MMt 20% without rRG.\n\nDevelopment of novel composite membranes using quaternized chitosan and Na+-MMT clay for the pervaporation dehydration of isopropanol.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoudhari, Santosh K; Kariduraganavar, Mahadevappa Y\n\n2009-10-01\n\nNovel polymer-clay-based composite membranes were prepared by incorporating sodium montmorillonite (Na(+)-MMT) clay into quaternized chitosan. The resulting membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WXAD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of membrane swelling was studied by varying the water concentration in the feed. The membranes were employed for the pervaporation dehydration of isopropanol in terms of feed composition and Na(+)-MMT clay loading. The experimental results demonstrated that membrane containing 10 mass% of Na(+)-MMT clay showed the highest separation selectivity of 14,992 with a flux of 14.23x10(-2) kg/m(2) h at 30 degrees C for 10 mass% of water in the feed. The total flux and flux of water are found to be overlapping each other particularly for clay-incorporated membranes, signifying that the composite membranes developed in the present study involving quaternized chitosan and Na(+)-MMT clay are highly selective toward water. From the temperature-dependent diffusion and permeation values, the Arrhenius activation parameters were estimated. The resulting activation energy values obtained for water permeation (E(pw)) are much lower than those of isopropanol permeation (E(pIPA)), suggesting that the developed composite membranes have higher separation efficiency for the water-isopropanol system. The estimated E(p) and E(D) values ranged between 8.97 and 11.89, and 7.56 and 9.88 kJ/mol, respectively. The positive heat of sorption (DeltaH(s)) values were obtained for all the membranes, suggesting that Henry's mode of sorption is predominant in the process.\n\nMaking Interoperability Easier with NASA's Metadata Management Tool (MMT)\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nShum, Dana; Reese, Mark; Pilone, Dan; Baynes, Katie\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWhile the ISO-19115 collection level metadata format meets many users' needs for interoperable metadata, it can be cumbersome to create it correctly.

The double leg lowering test (DLLT) and lower abdominal muscle progression (LAMP) are two common tests of abdominal muscle performance. The purposes of this study were to determine the relation between surface electromyographic (EMG) activity during the DLLT and LAMP levels; hip joint resultant moments and DLLT and LAMP levels; and the two measures of DLLT and LAMP. Ten healthy participants were tested under both conditions. Surface EMG activity of the abdominal muscles was obtained, while pelvic movement was detected simultaneously. A moderate to strong association was found between rectus abdominus muscle activity and a moderate association with the external obliques with both test levels. For the internal oblique/transversus abdominus, a moderate and weak association was found with the DLLT and LAMP, respectively. A very strong association existed between the hip resultant joint moments (RJM) and the DLLT, while there was a weak correlation between hip RJM and the LAMP. No significant correlation was found between the DLLT and LAMP grades. This finding suggests that these tests may measure different qualities of muscle performance and provides preliminary support for their use. Further evaluation of these assessments with clinical populations is necessary.\n\nHISTORY AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE US EPA'S SUPERFUND INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY EVALUATION (SITE) MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT (MMT) PROGRAM\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThis manuscript presents the history and evolution of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Superfund Innovative Technology Evaluation (SITE) Monitoring and Measurement Technology (MMT) Program.

Measure the degree of fatigue of the trunk extensor muscles induced by the SÃ¸rensen test. Eighty young healthy subjects were randomly divided into a control group (CG) and an experimental group (EG), each including 50% of the two genders. The EG performed an isometric MVC of the trunk extensors (pre-fatigue test) followed by the SÃ¸rensen test, the latter being immediately followed by another MVC (post-fatigue test). The CG performed only the pre- and post-fatigue tests without any exertion in between. The comparison of the pre- and post-fatigue tests revealed a significant (P< 0.05) decrease in MVC force normalized by body mass (-13%) in the EG, whereas a small increase occurred in the CG (+2.7%, P= 0.001). This study shows that the SÃ¸rensen test performed until failure in a young healthy population results in a reduced ability of the trunk extensor muscles to generate maximal force, and indicates that this test is valid for the assessment of fatigue in trunk extensor muscles.\n\nPreoperative botulinum toxin test injections before muscle lengthening in cerebral palsy.\n\nPubMed\n\nRutz, Erich; Hofmann, Eva; Brunner, Reinald\n\n2010-09-01\n\nMuscle weakening is a well-known side effect of muscle-tendon lengthening. Botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) weakens the muscle temporarily by blocking the neuromuscular junction. Hence application of the drug is a logical step to test whether weakness deteriorates function prior to an operation. In the present study, BTX-A application is used to test preoperatively whether the gait pattern depends on the strength of the tested muscle. Since 1999, instrumented gait analysis, including kinematic, kinetic, and dynamic electromyographic data, is routinely used to define the individual surgical program. In our series of 110 consecutive patients with cerebral palsy (CP) considered for surgical muscle lengthening from 1999 to 2008, BTX-A was applied to identify patients at risk for functional deterioration. Gait analysis was repeated 6 weeks (maximum effect of BTX-A) and 12 weeks (follow-up) after the test injection to check for loss of joint control (excessive ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, increased anterior pelvic tilt). In all, 20.9% (n = 23) showed deterioration in gait after preoperative BTX-A test injections (n = 112, two patients had two test trials) in all muscles considered for lengthening. As a consequence, their lengthening surgery was canceled. A total of 68 patients underwent surgery as planned, and in none of them did gait function deteriorate. These clinical data were compared to those of a historical group (n = 105) before this test, where 18% showed functional deterioration after surgery. The similar percentage of patients filtered out by the test suggests that there could be a context to the number of poor results in the historical group. We conclude that preoperative BTX-A test injection is a reliable tool for filtering out patients with risk of deterioration after muscle lengthening surgery in patients with CP and can be helpful to avoid poor outcomes.\n\n21 CFR 866.5120 - Antismooth muscle antibody immunological test system.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n...

Duane; Clark, Dusty; Porter, Dallan\n\n2014-07-01\n\nDetails of the software framework for the upcoming in-situ re-aluminization of the 6.5m MMT Observatory (MMTO) primary mirror are presented. This framework includes: 1) a centralized key-value store and data structure server for data exchange between software modules, 2) a newly developed hardware-software interface for faster data sampling and better hardware control, 3) automated control algorithms that are based upon empirical testing, modeling, and simulation of the aluminization process, 4) re-engineered graphical user interfaces (GUI's) that use state-of-the-art web technologies, and 5) redundant relational databases for data logging. Redesign of the software framework has several objectives: 1) automated process control to provide more consistent and uniform mirror coatings, 2) optional manual control of the aluminization process, 3) modular design to allow flexibility in process control and software implementation, 4) faster data sampling and logging rates to better characterize the approximately 100-second aluminization event, and 5) synchronized \"real-time\" web application GUI's to provide all users with exactly the same data. The framework has been implemented as four modules interconnected by a data store/server. The four modules are integrated into two Linux system services that start automatically at boot-time and remain running at all times. Performance of the software framework is assessed through extensive testing within 2.0 meter and smaller coating chambers at the Sunnyside Test Facility. The redesigned software framework helps ensure that a better performing and longer lasting coating will be achieved during the re-aluminization of the MMTO primary mirror.\n\nMuscle Force-Velocity Relationships Observed in Four Different Functional Tests.\n\nPubMed\n\nZivkovic, Milena Z; Djuric, Sasa; Cuk, Ivan; Suzovic, Dejan; Jaric, Slobodan\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe aims of the present study were to investigate the shape and strength of the force-velocity relationships observed in different functional movement tests and explore the parameters depicting force, velocity and power producing capacities of the tested muscles. Twelve subjects were tested on maximum performance in vertical jumps, cycling, bench press throws, and bench pulls performed against different loads. Thereafter, both the averaged and maximum force and velocity variables recorded from individual trials were used for force-velocity relationship modeling. The observed individual force-velocity relationships were exceptionally strong (median correlation coefficients ranged from r = 0.930 to r = 0.995) and approximately linear independently of the test and variable type. Most of the relationship parameters observed from the averaged and maximum force and velocity variable types were strongly related in all tests (r = 0.789-0.991), except for those in vertical jumps (r = 0.485-0.930). However, the generalizability of the force-velocity relationship parameters depicting maximum force, velocity and power of the tested muscles across different tests was inconsistent and on average moderate. We concluded that the linear force-velocity relationship model based on either maximum or averaged force-velocity data could provide the outcomes depicting force, velocity and power generating capacity of the tested muscles, although such outcomes can only be partially generalized across different muscles.\n\nMuscle Force-Velocity Relationships Observed in Four Different Functional Tests\n\nPubMed Central\n\nZivkovic, Milena Z.; Djuric, Sasa; Cuk, Ivan; Suzovic, Dejan; Jaric, Slobodan\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAbstract The aims of the present study were to investigate the shape and strength of the force-velocity relationships observed in different functional movement tests and explore the parameters depicting force, velocity and power producing capacities of the tested muscles.

Here, we report a clinical case series of C8 drop finger to reveal the clinical outcome of surgical treatments to allow for a better choice of treatment. The present study included 17 consecutive patients who were diagnosed as having C8 drop finger, in which muscle strength of the extensor digitorum communis (EDC) showed a manual muscle testing (MMT) grade of 3 or less. We retrospectively investigated the clinical characteristics of C8 drop finger and recovery of muscle power was measured by subtraction of preoperative MMT of the EDC from the final follow-up values. Nine cases showed recovery of muscle power of EDC, whereas the remaining eight cases did not show any recovery including two cases of deterioration. None of the conservatively treated patients showed any recovery. Surgically treated cases included two cases of deterioration. In the cases showing recovery, recovery began 9.9Â months after surgery on average and recovery took 13.8Â months after surgery on average. There was a significant difference in the recovery of MMT grade between the groups treated conservatively and surgically (pÂ =Â 0.049). Preoperative MMT grade of EDC showed a moderate correlation with postoperative recovery (r 2 Â =Â 0.45, pÂ =Â 0.003). In other words, the severity of preoperative muscular weakness correlated negatively with postoperative recovery. C8 drop finger is better treated by surgery than conservative therapy.\n\nHunting for extremely metal-poor emission-line galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: MMT and 3.5 m APO observations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIzotov, Y. I.; Thuan, T. X.; Guseva, N. G.\n\n2012-10-01\n\nWe present 6.5-m MMT and 3.5 m APO spectrophotometry of 69 H ii regions in 42 low-metallicity emission-line galaxies, selected from the data release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to have mostly [O iii]Î»4959/HÎ² â² 1 and [N ii]Î»6583/HÎ² â² 0.1. The electron temperature-sensitive emission line [O iii] Î»4363 is detected in 53 H ii regions allowing a direct abundance determination. The oxygen abundance in the remaining 16 H ii regions is derived using a semi-empirical method. The oxygen abundance of the galaxies in our sample ranges from 12 + log O/H ~ 7.1 to ~7.9, with 14 H ii regions in 7 galaxies with 12 + log O/H â¤ 7.35. In 5 of the latter galaxies, the oxygen abundance is derived here for the first time. Including other known extremely metal-deficient emission-line galaxies from the literature, e.g. SBS 0335-052W, SBS 0335-052E and I Zw 18, we have compiled a sample of the 17 most metal-deficient (with 12 + log O/H â¤ 7.35) emission-line galaxies known in the local universe. There appears to be a metallicity floor at 12 + log O/H ~ 6.9, suggesting that the matter from which dwarf emission-line galaxies formed was pre-enriched to that level by e.g. Population III stars.

It is therefore a pre-requisite to have a reliable method for clinical assessment of hip muscles function allowing the design and implementation of a proper strengthening program. Motor-driven dynamometry has been widely accepted as the gold-standard for lower limb muscle strength assessment but is mainly related to the knee joint. Studies focusing on the hip joint are less exhaustive and somewhat discrepant with regard to optimal participants position, consequently influencing outcome measures. Thus, we aimed to develop a standardized test setup for the assessment of hip muscles strength, i.e. flexors/extensors and abductors/adductors, with improved participant stability and to define its psychometric characteristics. Eighteen participants performed unilateral isokinetic and isometric contractions of the hip muscles in the sagittal and coronal plane at two separate occasions. Peak torque and normalized peak torque were measured for each contraction. Relative and absolute measures of reliability were calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient and standard error of measurement, respectively. Results from this study revealed higher levels of between-day reliability of isokinetic/isometric hip abduction/flexion peak torque compared to existing literature. The least reliable measures were found for hip extension and adduction, which could be explained by a less efficient stabilization technique. Our study additionally provided a first set of reference normalized data which can be used in future research.

M.\n\n2012-03-01\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey is now in its third phase (SDSS-III; Eisenstein et al. 2011AJ....142...72E) and is carrying out a combination of four interleaved surveys that will continue until the summer of 2014. One of those surveys, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), commenced operations in late 2009 and is using essentially all the dark time for SDSS-III. BOSS uses the same 2.5m Sloan Foundation telescope that was used in SDSS-I/II, but since BOSS will observe fainter targets, the fiber-fed spectrographs have been significantly upgraded. These upgrades include: new CCDs with improved blue and red response; 1000 2\" instead of 640 3\" optical diameter fibers; higher throughput gratings over a spectral range of 3600-10000Ã at a resolution of about 2000, and improved optics. Prior to the commencement of BOSS spectroscopy, we carried out spectroscopy of quasar candidates selected from co-added photometry in SDSS Stripe 82. Observations of these candidates were carried out in queue mode between 2008 September and 2009 January using the Hectospec multi-fiber spectrograph on the 6.5m Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT). In Tables 14 and 15, we provide positions, PSF photometry (as observed, uncorrected for Galactic extinction), and redshifts for confirmed quasars from the MMT survey. Objects that are not flagged Primary in the CAS are listed separately (table 15).

The comparison between the pyramid and the double-roof prism based wavefront sensors and the evaluation of their micro pupils' quality are presented. According to our analysis, the use of two double-roof prisms with achromatic materials produces the competitive performance when compared to the traditional pyramid prism, which is difficult to manufacture. The final micro pupils on the image plane have the residual errors of pupil position, chromatism, and distortion within 1/10 pixel over the 2Ã2 arcsecond field of view, which meet the original design goals.\n\nMethadone Maintenance Treatment Promotes Referral and Uptake of HIV Testing and Counselling Services amongst Drug Users and Their Partners\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNguyen, Lan Phuong; Nguyen, Cuong Tat; Phan, Huong Thi Thu; Latkin, Carl A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) reduces HIV risk behaviors and improves access to HIV-related services among drug users. In this study, we assessed the uptake and willingness of MMT patients to refer HIV testing and counseling (HTC) service to their sexual partners and relatives. Methods Health status, HIV-related risk behaviors, and HTC uptake and referrals of 1,016 MMT patients in Hanoi and Nam Dinh were investigated. Willingness to pay (WTP) for HTC was elicited using a contingent valuation technique. Interval and logistic regression models were employed to determine associated factors. Results Most of the patients (94.2%) had received HTC, 6.6 times on average. The proportion of respondents willing to refer their partners, their relatives and to be voluntary peer educators was 45.7%, 35.3%, and 33.3%, respectively. Attending MMT integrated with HTC was a facilitative factor for HTC uptake, greater WTP, and volunteering as peer educators. Older age, higher education and income, and HIV positive status were positively related to willingness to refer partners or relatives, while having health problems (mobility, usual care, pain/discomfort) was associated with lower likelihood of referring others or being a volunteer. Over 90% patients were willing to pay an average of US $17.9 for HTC service. Conclusion The results highlighted the potential role of MMT patients as referrers to HTC and voluntary peer educators. Integrating HIV testing with MMT services and applying usersâ fee are potential strategies to mobilize resources and encourage HIV testing among MMT patients and their partners.

The aim of this study was to assess the isokinetic muscle strength in sciatica patients' and control subjects' ankles that exhibited normal ankle muscle strength when measured clinically. Forty-six patients with L5 and/or S1 nerve compression, and whose age, sex, weight, and height matched 36 healthy volunteers, were recruited to the study. Heel-walking, toe-walking, and manual muscle testing were used to perform ankle dorsiflexion and plantar fl"
