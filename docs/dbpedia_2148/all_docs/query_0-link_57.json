The anthropological data contained in this study were collected at the time of the selective service draft of 1917 and 1918 and at the demobilization during the late summer and fall of 1919. The principal data concerning stature, weight, and chest circumference were taken from physical examination sched- ules (Form 1010 P. M. G. 0.) ° for the first million selective service recruits, and, with special reference to men found with selected diseases or defects, also for the second million. The preliminary study of the result of the physical examinations of approxi- mately the hrst million drafted men sent to mobilization camps was published in Bulletin No. 11, Surgeon General's Office, March, 1919. The complete study of approximately 2,000,000 drafted men who were sent to the mobilization camps, and of the 549,099 who were rejected by the local boards as totally and permanently unfit, mentally or physcially, for the military service, was pub- lished in Defects Found in Drafted Men, War Department, Surgeon General's Office, 1920. The anthropological data contained in this work relative to the draft recruits were taken from the same source (Form 1010 P. M. G. O.) . A preliminary study of the physical dimensions of the men with the selected diseases for the first million draft recruits was made in 1919. Such diseases and defects were selected as, it was anticipated, might show some deviation from the normal of the physical dimensions. Subsequently, similar data were collected for the second million. Accordingly, the results of the men with the special diseases or defects amonc the first and second million draft recruits were tabulated and the constants were calculated separately as well as combined. Such a procedure has certain advantages, especially in enabling one to make a comparison between the first and the second million,'' and to secure a criterion as to the constancy and significance of the findings. In the second million recruits there were found more cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, goiter of both types, errors of refraction, tachycardia, varicose veins, hernia, underweight, and congenital defects, and less, or about the same, of various cardiac disorders, varicocele, hemorrhoids, flat-foot, and \"defective physical development.\" Unfortunately, no provision was made on the physical examination forms for recording color, nativity, age, or occupation. Acknowledgment is made of the very kind and hearty cooperation of the entire office of the Provost Marshal General, and thanks are especially due to Colonel James Easby-Smith, Colonel Frank II. Wigmore, and Colonel Frank P. Keefer, of that office. An excellent study containing material for the Civil War \" The earlier form used was Form HP.M.O.O. b In the tables and illustrations throughout this publication the \"first million draft recruits\" are designated by the symbol Pi and the \"second million draft recruits\" by the symbol Pj. 3 4 ARMY ANTHROPOLOGY. draft recruits, draft substitutes, and late volunteers, similar to that published in Defects Found in Drafted Men, 1920, and in this work, was prepared after the close of the Civil War by Colonel J. H. Baxter, Medical Corps, Chief Medical Officer, Provost Marshal General's Bureau, in the office of the Provost Marshal General, and published in a two-volume work in 1875, under the title of \"Statistics, Medical and Anthropological.\" The part of this work that is based on the measurements of approximately 100,000 troops at demobilization has also an interesting history. Having in mind the study made by Dr. B. A. Gould, of the United States Sanitary Com- mission, on the physique of the Civil War volunteer recruits and troops at demobilization in 1865, and recognizing the importance of special anthropometry to the Army, to science, and to the Nation at large, an effort was made by the National Academy of Science from the summer of 1917 to secure authorization for special measurements, but in the stress of the preparation for warfare and during the war itself, authorization was not deemed advisable by the military authorities. However, an order to measure returning soldiers, to secure data for the fashioning of uniforms, was obtained from the Secretary of War during the latter half of 1919. Thanks are due to Dr. Charles D. Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to Colonel William H. Welch, M. C, of Johns Hopkins University Medical School, to Brigadier General Edward L. Munson, Morale Branch of the General Staff, for their continued efforts to secure the necessary authorization for the measurements, and to Colonel A. J. Dougherty, of the Equipment Branch of the General Staff, who finally secured the authorization for the work. Thanks are also due to The Adjutant General for the permission granted to remove records of physical examinations to the Medical Record Section of the Surgeon General's Office for use in collecting statistical data; to the chief clerk of that office, Mr. Thomas A. O'Brien, for his advice and assistance in arranging the details for the use of the records, and to Mr. John N. Manning, principal clerk, Medical Record Section, Adjutant General's Office, for his very kind assistance in expediting the transfer of the records to and from the Sur- geon General's Office. Acknowledgement is made of the services of Mr. Louis R. Sullivan, anthropolo- gist (formerly second lieutenant, Sanitary Corps), for his careful and painstaking work in the preparation of Tables 17, 18, 19, and 20 (sections of the United States, with the \"groups\" of them). Especial mention must be made of the services of the civilian anthropologists and anatomists who supervised the work of taking the measurements of sol- diers at the camps during the heat of the summer and early autumn of 1919, frequently at considerable self-sacrifice in other ways.- - The good quality of the results are evidence of the effectiveness of the service they rendered. Acknowledgement is also made of the assistance rendered by the clerical personnel of the Medical Record Section, Surgeon General's Office; to Mr. John W. Beath for his care in the supervision of the preparation of most of the large statistical tables; to Miss Anna T. Buckley and Mrs. Lillian K. Taylor for their ' See pp. 36 and 57 for the list of the names of the supervising anthropologists and anatomists, and of the camps where the measurements were taken. PREFACE. 5 exceptionally excellent and accurate work in calculating the constants of the large tables in the text and appendix; to Dr. Thomas J. Griffith, Miss Martha E. Burton and Miss Viola M. Rose for their careful and painstaking work in super- vising the coding of the data on the statistical cards; to Second Lieutenant Glendon H. Armstrong, S. C, for his conscientious and painstaking work in supervising the tabulation of the material for the draft recruits; to Miss Helen R. Markley for her equally excellent work in supervising the tabulation of the. data for special measurements of the 100,000 demobilized men; to Mrs. Blanche E. Moore for the preparation of the majority of the graphs; and, indeed, to the entire clerical force of the Medical Record Section, Surgeon General's Office, who cooperated efficiently and intelligently, both during the last year of the war and afterward, in making this report as accurate and valuable as possible. Acknowledgement is also due to Miss Miriam Kortright, of the Carnegie Institution's Station for Experimental Evolution, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, N. Y., who assisted in the calculation of many of the smaller text tables. TABLE OF CONTENTS Page. Preface 3 Introduction 34 1. Importance of anthropology in the Army 34 2. Stature 34 3. Weight 36 4.

This study involves the analysis of the three standard physical measurements of the Army, taken on 1,000,000 recruits; with special reference to physical defects, taken on 2,000,000 recruits; and of a set of 17 other measurements made of 100,000 troops at demobilization, for the purpose of securing dimensions for uniforms. The whole study gives an insight into the sizes and proportions of the American male population, ages 21 to 30 years, and is a study of dimen- sions with reference to health and development, to geographical distribution and environment, and to race and color. The data were gathered partly at local and camp boards on the occasion of the selective draft, and partly on special order from the War Department to secure detailed measurements of 100,000 troops at the time of demobilization. The statistical work was done by the Medical Record Section of the Surgeon General's Office. 1. IMPORTANCE OF ANTHROPOLOGY IN THE ARMY. For over a century armies have prescribed limits of size for recruits on various grounds. It is urged that small men (under 60 inches) can not carry the pre- scribed equipment. Men over 78 inches are more apt to suffer from circulatory and other diseases. The size of men has a relation to the standard food ration. This differs in the English and Italian Armies because of the difference in body size of the soldiers. Troops in an Army camp containing a large proportion of South Italians and Polish Jews from New York city should use a different average amount of food per man than those composed mostly of Scandinavians. The length of leg is important for the classification of troops which are required to make long marches. A knowledge of proportions of facial features is essen- tial to gas-mask manufacturers. A knowledge of the size and proportions of the body is essential to the proper cutting of uniforms. It will also aid in detecting pulmonary tuberculosis and cardiac disorders, as well as thyroid and other diseases. A knowledge of racial characteristics is often necessary to decide on classification when military organizations are being formed on racial lines, such as Negro regiments, Slavic legions, etc. And finally, the whole system of identification, whether by finger prints or by Bertillon's proportions, belongs to the field of anthropology. 2. STATURE. The mean stature of the first million recruits, ages 21 to 30 years, inclusive, and including white and colored, is 67.49 inches (1,714 mm.). The 100,000 troops measured at demobilization measured 67.72 inches tall (1,720 mm.). The gain of 6 millimeters on the average was partly because they were older, partly because they were straighter, partly because some of the shorter divisions were not included in the hundred thousand, and partly because some short men were rejected when examined for mobilization. Comparing the average stature of recruits with those of the Civil War, after combining the figur es of Baxter, 1 1875, and Gould, 2 1869, due allowance being Note.— Superior figures refer to literature and other documents cited, p. 417. 34 INTRODUCTION. 35 made for the number of men recorded in each case, we find that it is practically the same, being 67.502 in the Civil War, and G7.49 in 1017-1918. We might con- clude, then, that the mean stature of men of military age has changed little in the United States in the last 50 years. But this conclusion might be hasty, for the men of 1917-1918 were taken from all parts of the United States, while those of 1864-1865 largely excluded the Southern States, and since the men from these States are exceptionally tall, their inclusion tends to raise the mean stature. Taking the figures from Gould, 2 1869, the ages of volunteers showed a greater proportion of men below the ages of 24 — that is, of those who had not obtained their maximum growth — than in 1917-1918. This again tends to raise the average stature of 1917-1918 over that of 1861-1865. Baxter, 1 gives a higher average age for draft recruits, namely, 27.307. It is reasonable to suppose that since this country has received a very large number of immigrants of prevailingly low stature from the southern part of Europe, during the last 50 years the average stature of the population of the country should show a decrease. Such, however, is very difficult to demon- strate mathematically, since, the methods used in the recruiting of the two armies, at the two periods, differed so materially. Indeed, the question whether the physique of our young men has changed in the last 50 years thus unqualified has little meaning. Had the racial constitution of the population remained constant — that is, had there been no heavy immigration — then the question would have more meaning; but in view of the tremendous immigra- tion, amounting in some years to nearly a million persons, the physical changes of the racial constitution of our stock have been so great as to mask entirely any slight alteration that may have occurred in the physique of the stock of 50 years ago, through either improvement or deterioration of environmental or economic conditions. From the different States men differ much in stature. The Texans are tallest, having an average stature nearly 1 inch above the national average. The mean of the Southern States is taller than the average, while the men of Con- necticut, Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have an average short stature. They are the States with many immigrants from southeastern Europe. Among the North Central States, Kansas, Idaho. Oregon, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, and Minnesota have high average statures. At demobilization the greatest increase in average stature was found in the Southern States, which hud apparently greater room for improvement: at least in absolute millimeters. The average stature of veterans from Massa- chusetts, District of Columbia, and Indiana had not increased. The average stature of the men from different sections revealed points of even greater interest. At the head of the list stands the mountain section of North Carolina, with a mean stature of 68.67 inches, nearly 1 .2 inches above the national average. The inhabitants of this section are largely descendants of the early Scotch settlers (a tall race) in Cape Fear River basin. The next tallest mean man is found in the Ozark mountain region. 68.64 and 68.63 36 ARMY ANTHROPOLOGY. inches, and then come the Texas sections, averaging about 68.47. At the top of the northern sections is northern Minnesota with its \"big Swedes.\" Other sections with tall average stature are Mississippi, the mountain sections of Tennessee and Kentucky, other parts of North Carolina, Western Kansas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, California, and Nebraska. At the other extreme are Rhode Island, New York City, the mining area of eastern Pennsylvania, Phila- delphia, the manufacturing towns of northeast Massachusetts, eastern New Jersey, and all parts of Connecticut. The inhabitants of these mining and manufacturing sections are not small because of the injurious somatic effect of the miner's and manufacturer's occupations; for the miners of Idaho average far above the mean of the country, and the inhabitants of the flour mill \"twin cities\" of Minnesota average three-tenths of an inch above the mean of the country. On the other hand, an agricultural section of eastern Pennsylvania has a population that is seven-tenths of an inch below the mean of the country. Combining sections, the mountain whites have the greatest mean stature and a low variability; they \" run tall \" fairly uniformly. Next comes the prevailing white agricultural group of the South, then two groups with a large Mexican and Indian population, then the German-Scandinavian groups and those low- land sections with many native whites of Scotch origin. The shortest group is that containing many French Canadians. The next taller is the eastern manufacturing group with its great numbers of representatives of the short races. Of the eight European races that were most numerous in the examina- tion at demobilization the Scotch were the tallest (67.93 inches), next the English (67.75), then the Germans (67.73), the Irish (67.46), the Polish (66.70), French (66.37), Hebrew (65.71), and Italians (65.03). At demobilization the stature of the whites had increased over mobilization from 67.49 inches to 67.71 ; the Negroes were 67.70 and the Indians were 67.52 tall at demobilization; the Chinese 67.37; and the Japanese 67.30. At demobilization the Negroes were found to be more variable in stature than the whites as 6.91 is to 6.66 centimeters. 3. WEIGHT. The mean weight of the first million recruits was 141.54 pounds, which is slightly higher than the mean weight (136.05 pounds) of a few thousand \"white American \" recruits measured at the time of the Civil War (Baxter, Vol. II, p. 15).* At demobilization troops weighed, on the average, 3 pounds more than did recruits and showed about the same increase that veterans showed over recruits in Civil War times. At demobilization in 1919 there was reduced variability in the weight. The soldiers had increased 2 per cent in weight and diminished 2 per cent in variability; the fine physical conditions of army life tended to raise the weight to a uniform high level. The greatest weight is found in men from the extreme north. The following States stand at the head of the list : Alaska, South and North Dakota, Minne- sota, Oregon, Montana, Washington, Nevada, and Idaho. The men from these States are not the tallest, but as we shall see later they are the stockiest. This stocky condition is not entirely racial; it is probably the reaction of the body * The figures citoil are for draft substitutes and late volunteers, as well as for draft recruits per se. INTRODUCTION. 37 to climatic conditions. Just as the Eskimos arc robust, so whites in Alaska and the Dakotas tend to become so. Also, under army conditions men from Alaska gained on the average 11.5 pounds. However, the number of men from Alaska examined was small and the averages probably untrustworthy. The average increase for the whole country was only 3.4 pounds. In general, the men from the Southern States showed an increase of weight above the average of the entire country. The \"French-Canadian\" sections comprised recruits of the least weight; the eastern manufacturing groups came next, largely because they contained so many small men. That conditions of life were not the principal cause of the low weight is indicated by the fact that the recruits from commuter (suburban) groups also showed a low average weight. Of the Europeans at demobilization, Germans show the greatest average weight, South Italians and Hebrews the least. The Scotch are the most variable in weight, the Poles the least. The Negro troops are slightly heavier and show a greater variability in weight than the white troops. The Japanese weigh the least of all color races. In the southern sections those containing a large proportion of colored men show relatively less obesity than those containing a small proportion of them. 4. CHEST CIRCUMFERENCE. The mean circumference of the deflated chest of the first million recruits was 33.22 inches. At demobilization uninflated chests of the veterans meas- ured, on the average, 34.94 inches. These results are not strictly comparable, however, as the chest was not measured in the same phase of expansion in the two sets. Despite this there is evidence that the mean chest girth of the veterans had increased about 1 inch. The same thing happened in the Civil War. The recruits from the Northwestern States showed the greatest chest circumference, those from the Southern States, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia the least. In relative chest circumference Connecticut stands first, partly because of the racial composition of her population. Indeed, all States which have many representatives of the stocky Mediterranean race stand high in this regard. The tall Southerners stand very low in the series of relative chest girth. For the groups, the largest mean chest circumference is found in such as are occupied by the Finns, agricultural Russians, French-Canadians, German-Austrians, and Scandinavians. Scotch sections and the southern white show the smallest relative chest girth. The chest girth of the Negro troops was relatively somewhat less than that of whites. 5. BUILD. The best index of build is debatable. The square of stature as a base is probably the most satisfact"
