Abshire, Cheryl Dennison Himmelfarb\n\nSchool of Nursing, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Advanced heart failure patients who face end of life may require a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a pump surgically implanted in the ventricle with a driveline percutaneously connected to a power source and controller. The LVAD significantly improves quality of life and functional status and extends life by as much as four times over medical management alone. However, emotional distress, psychological sequelae, multiple postimplant hospitalizations, lifestyle adaptations and end‐of‐life considerations are common following device insertion. The proposed study will examine physiologic biomarkers and psychological stress response measures among patients living with an LVAD. Relationships among individual characteristics (implant strategy, time with LVAD, emergent implantation and number of stressful life events), indicators of stress (salivary cortisol, C‐reactive protein, perceived stress, depression and coping) and outcomes (quality of life, functional status and hospitalization rate) will be examined. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In this cross‐sectional study, we will recruit 92 LVAD patients from three hospital‐based LVAD centers in the Baltimore‐Washington area to complete surveys during clinic visits and provide biospecimens collected at home during the 2 days following survey completion. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Statistical analyses will include descriptive statistics and regression modeling. We anticipate those with emergently inserted devices and destination therapy will demonstrate higher levels of stress response (physiological and psychological) when controlling for potential covariates. In addition, we anticipate that high levels of stress biomarkers and stress response measures will be associated with low quality of life, functional status and high hospitalization rates. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: This study will provide important data to guide the development and testing of interventions to improve outcomes among patients living with an LVAD.\n\n029\n\nDETECTING MATERNAL‐FETAL GENOTYPE INTERACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH CONGENITAL HEART DEFECTS\n\nMing Li1, Mario A. Cleves1, Himel Mallick2, Stephen W. Erickson1, Xinyu Tang1, Stewart L. Macleod1, Charlotte A. Hobbs1\n\n1Pediatrics/Biostatistics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA; 2University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Genetic factors associated with congenital heart defects (CHDs) may be attributed to either independent effects of maternal or fetal genes, or the intergenerational interactions between maternal and fetal genes. In this study, we try to detect maternal‐fetal genotype (MFG) interactions and differentiating them from the maternal/fetal main effects. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We introduced a penalized logistic regression framework with adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso), which dissects the maternal effect, fetal effect, and MFG interaction effects. Our method allows simultaneous model selection and effect estimation, providing a unified framework to differentiate maternal/fetal main effect from the MFG interaction effect. All subjects were participants of the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), an ongoing large‐scale covering an annual birth population of 482,000, or 10 % of U.S. births. CHD cases were ascertained from birth defect registries in ten participating states that had similar inclusion criteria. The final study population included 294 case‐mother pairs and 874 control‐mother pairs. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We identified 9 haplotype blocks that are potentially associated with CHDs. Four haplotype blocks, located in genes MGMT, MTHFS, CBS, and DNMT3L, were statistically significant using a Bayesian false‐discovery probability threshold of 0.8. Two blocks in MGMT and MTHFS appear to have significant fetal effects, while the CBS and DNMT3L genes may have significant MFG interaction effects. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: This study is among the first to investigate the interaction effect between maternal and fetal genes. By employing an innovative logistic regression framework with adaptive lasso, we identified four genes potentially associated with CHDs. Further studies are needed to replicate these findings.\n\n030\n\nUTILIZATION OF INPATIENT CARDIAC REHABILITATION DURING A HOSPITALIZATION FOR A CARDIAC CONDITION: A NATIONAL SAMPLE\n\nQuinn R. Pack1, Aruna Priya1, Tara Lagu1, Penelope Pekow1,2, Peter K. Lindenauer1\n\n1Baystate Medical Center, West Springfield, Massachusetts, USA; 2School of Public Health, Unverisity of Massachussetts, Amherst, Massachusetts, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Inpatient cardiac rehabilitation (ICR) programs provide important services to patients, including daily ambulation, risk factor education, and coordinated referral to outpatient cardiac rehabilitation. However, little is known about national current utilization or practice patterns. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Utilizing a geographically and structurally diverse sample of U.S. hospitals (PREMIER Data Warehouse, Inc.), we examined the use of ICR using detailed administrative data from January 2007 to June 2011. Patients with an ICD‐9 principal diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) or heart failure (HF), or with a procedure code for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), valve (V) surgery, or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were included. Any patient with ≥ 1 service code for ICR was considered to have received ICR. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We evaluated 1,343,537 qualifying admissions from 458 hospitals. The overall ICR utilization rate was 20.8%. ICR utilization was highest in patients with surgical procedures with 45.5%, 37.0%, 40.7% for CABG, V, CABG+V, with rates of 23.7%, 31.3%, 23.7%, 15.6%, and 10.6% for elective PCI, urgent PCI, MI + PCI, MI alone, and HF respectively. Of 458 hospitals, 223 (49%) hospitals provided any ICR, with a median (10–90%) hospital ICR rate of 18.8% (0.06%–74.1%). Hospitals in urban areas had significantly higher rates of ICR compared to hospitals in rural areas (30.1% vs. 18.6%) as did hospitals with presence of interventional services (surgical services: 31.5% vs. 20.2%, p = 0.006; PCI services: 30.3% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.003). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: There appears to be substantial variation in the delivery of ICR across U.S. hospitals. Less than half of hospitals with cardiac patients provide ICR and only a minority of patients ever receives ICR. This substantial gap in the secondary prevention of heart disease appears to warrant further investigation and intervention.\n\n031\n\nA ROLE FOR NOTCH1 SIGNALING IN ASCENDING AORTIC ANEURYSMS\n\nSara Koenig1,2, Kevin Bosse2, Patrick Rowland2, Brenda Lilly2,1, Vidu Garg2,1\n\n1The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA; 2Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The development of ascending aortic aneurysms (AscAA) is a significant clinical problem for patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), which is the most common type of congenital heart defect with an estimated prevalence of ∼1%. Nearly 50% of individuals with BAV will develop aortic dilation before 30 years of age. Previously, we identified loss of function, heterozygous mutations in NOTCH1 that were associated with familial BAV. A subset of affected family members had dilation of the ascending aorta, suggesting a potential role for Notch1 in AscAA. The objective of this research was to determine if haploinsufficiency of Notch1 is associated with AscAA using mutant mouse models.. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: First, we performed serial echocardiograms on Notch1 +/–; Nos3 –/– mice, which have BAV. Then, in order to investigate the role of Notch1 in AscAA without BAV, we have introduced Notch1 haploinsufficiency to a known model of Marfan syndrome (Fbn1C1039G/+), which develops AscAA. We performed serial echocardiograms on these compound mutant mice. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Our echocardiographic analysis demonstrated the development of ascending aortic dilation in a subset of the Notch1 +/–; Nos3 –/– mice, while no aortic dilation was noted in wildtype, Notch1 +/–, and Nos3 –/‐ ‐littermate mice by 6 months of age. When the Fbn1C1039G/+ mouse is crossed into a Notch1 haploinsufficient background (Fbn1C1039G/+; Notch1 +/–), an exacerbated AscAA phenotype is observed, which is significantly different by 3 months of age. Furthermore, a subset of these mice died from aortic rupture before 3 months of age, an outcome that is not present in Fbn1C1039G/+ mice. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Our findings support a novel role for Notch1 in the pathogenesis of AscAA. These findings lay the foundation for future research to understand the mechanism by which loss of Notch1 signaling contributes to the development of AscAA, which could lead to pharmacological intervention and improve patient quality of life.\n\n032\n\nTHE WARBURG EFFECT IN THE FAILING HEART: INCREASED GLUCOSE METABOLISM DRIVES SUNITINIB ­CARDIOTOXICITY\n\nMeredith R. Rodriguez1, Janani Subramaniam1, Yuantang Li1, Dale J. Hamilton3, O. H. Frazier2, Heinrich Taegtmeyer1\n\n1Internal Medicine‐Cardiology, UT Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA; 2Texas Heart Institute, Houston, Texas, USA; 3The Methodist Research Institute, Houston, Texas, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Sunitinib malate is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of highly vascularized tumors. Nearly 20% of sunitinib‐treated patients develop cardiac dysfunction or failure. At the same time sunitinib lowers blood glucose levels. Intensive blood glucose lowering regimens have been associated with cardiac dysfunction in diabetic patients. We asked whether altered glucose metabolism contributes to sunitinib cardiotoxicity. We then examined whether these changes also occurred in nonchemotherapy–related human heart failure. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Mice were treated with sunitinib for 6 weeks. Sample from failing human hearts were obtained before and after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) support. Nonfailing heart samples were obtained from patients undergoing heart–lung transplantation due to pulmonary hypertension and right‐ventricle failure. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Sunitinib increased systemic insulin sensitivity and resulted in a fivefold increase in glucose uptake in the mouse heart. Transcript analysis by qPCR revealed an up‐regulation of genes associated with glycolysis. Specifically, we observed a shift in the enzyme pyruvate kinase from the adult M1 (PKM1) isoform to the fetal M2 (PKM2) isoform, a hallmark of the Warburg Effect in cancer. This corresponded to an accumulation of glycogen and increased O‐GlcNAc modified proteins. The failing human hearts similarly displayed a reexpression of PKM2 that was partially reversed following mechanical unloading. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Cancer cells up‐regulate nonoxidative glycolysis to support continuous growth and proliferation. We propose that a similar redirection of glucose occurs in the failing heart and may represent a novel target for the treatment of human heart failure.\n\n033\n\nNMR‐BASED LIPOPROTEIN PARTICLE PROFILES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE WITH PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION\n\nWynn G. Hunter3, Jacob P. Kelly2,4, Carol Haynes1, Damian Craig1, Robert McGarrah2,1, Eric Velazquez2,4, G. Michael Felker2,4, Adrian Hernandez2,4, Svati Shah2,1, William Kraus2,1\n\n1Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 2Duke University Department of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 3Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA;4Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) based measurements of lipoprotein particle concentrations and sizes have been associated with adverse events in the setting of coronary artery disease. NMR‐based lipoprotein particle profiling (NMR‐LP) has not been performed in the setting of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), a disease characterized by incomplete risk prediction and phenotypic heterogeneity. We sought to determine the relationship between NMR based lipoprotein measurements and clinical outcomes in the setting of HFpEF to identify high‐risk subtypes and offer mechanistic insights into disease pathogenesis. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We identified N = 262 patients with HFpEF (ejection fraction ≥ 50%, presence of New York Heart Association class II–IV symptoms) from the CATHGEN biorepository. NMR‐LP was performed on fasting plasma using the LipoProfile test. Independent associations between lipoprotein size, particle concentration, and time to all‐cause mortality or myocardial infarction (MI) was assessed using Cox modeling adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, smoking, hypertension, COPD, diabetes, and number of diseased coronary arteries. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: After adjusting for major clinical factors, 11/19 lipoprotein characteristics were independently associated with time to death or MI. Increased risk was observed with greater size of high‐density lipoprotein (HDL) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10–1.56, p = 0.003) and greater size of low‐density lipoprotein (LDL) (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01–1.52, p = 0.04). Decreased risk was observed with greater size of VLDL (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45–0.74, p < 0.0001) and increased numbers of large VLDL particles and chylomicrons (HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43–0.84, p = 0.003). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Lipoprotein particle sizes and concentrations are independently associated with adverse clinical outcomes in HFpEF and may assist in risk prediction.\n\n034\n\nPERIVASCULAR ADIPOSE TISSUE AND VASCULAR ­REACTIVITY IN OBESITY‐INDUCED CORONARY DISEASE\n\nJillian Noblet1, Meredith Owen2, Adam Goodwill1, Daniel Sassoon1, Johnathan Tune1\n\n1Cellular & Integrative Physiology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; 2University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Studies were designed to investigate the effects of lean vs. obese coronary perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) on K+ channel mediated dilation and to examine differences in the vascular effects of PVAT according to anatomic depot. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Coronary arteries from lean and obese Ossabaw swine were cleaned of PVAT and mounted in organ baths for isometric tension studies. Lean arteries were incubated for 30 min with 0.3 g of lean PVAT from the same animal, obese PVAT, or left untreated as control. Arteries were preconstricted with U46619 (1 μM) and then exposed to K+ channel agonists. Additional studies were conducted in which segments of human internal thoracic arteries obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were incubated with or without 0.1 g of PVAT for 30 min and exposed to increasing concentrations of KCl (10–60 mM). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Compared to control responses, the addition of lean PVAT attenuated dilator responses to the KCa channel agonist NS‐1619 (30 μM) by ∼30% (p < 0.001) and the KV7 channel agonist L‐364,373 (10 μM) by ∼20% (P = 0.02). Dilation to the KATP channel agonist cromakalim (1 μM) was unaffected in the presence of lean PVAT. In contrast to lean PVAT, obese PVAT had no effect on relaxation to NS‐1619 (30 μM) or L‐364,373 (10 μM) in lean arteries. Alternatively, obese PVAT significantly attenuated relaxation to cromakalim (1 μM). Overall responses to NS‐1619 and L‐364,373 in the absence of PVAT were significantly attenuated in obese compared to lean arteries. These differences were independent of changes in KV7 (KCNQ1) and KATP (Kir6.1) protein abundance. In human internal thoracic arteries, the presence of PVAT did not significantly affect vasoconstriction to KCl. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These findings provide new insights into the unique vasoactive properties of lean vs. obese PVAT and the potential role of coronary PVAT‐derived factors in obesity‐induced vascular dysfunction.\n\n035\n\nSECONDHAND SMOKE AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: THE HEALTH eHEART STUDY\n\nShalini Dixit, Mark J. Pletcher, Kourtney Imburgia, Carol Maguire, Isaac R. Whitman, Stanton A. Glantz, Jeffrey E. Olgin, Gregory M. Marcus\n\nUniversity of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Previous studies suggest that tobacco use may be an important risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, the effect of secondhand smoke (SHS) on AF risk has not yet been studied. We sought to examine the relationship between SHS exposure and prevalent AF in a cohort of adult men and women. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The Health eHeart study is an ongoing, Internet‐based cardiovascular cohort study. At the time of this analysis, there were 6,863 participants enrolled in the study, of which 4,986 had completed visit one. A validated, 22‐item questionnaire was used to assess SHS exposure during different stages of life and in various environments, including home, work, and social settings. Prevalent AF was ascertained by self‐report in the baseline medical conditions survey. SHS questions that exhibited unadjusted associations with p‐values < 0.10 were selected for multivariable analysis to address potential confounding using logistic regression. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Of the 4,976 participants, 593 (11.9%) reported having AF at baseline. Twelve of the 22 survey questions met criteria to be examined in multivariable analysis. Of those, having had a smoking parent during gestational development (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05–1.73, p = 0.019) and residing with a smoker during childhood (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05–1.75, p = 0.021) each remained significantly associated with AF after adjustment for age, sex, race, smoking status, years of smoking, alcohol consumption, education level, diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, and history of myocardial infarction. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: SHS exposure in early life may be an important, modifiable risk factor for the development of AF. Given the increasing burden of AF and lack of effective preventive strategies, additional studies are needed to further characterize the relationship between SHS and AF and to identify possible causal mechanisms.\n\n036\n\nPROJECT RED CHIP GEOCODING PLAN: A UNIQUE APPROACH TO OPTIMIZATION OF PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH DISPARITIES\n\nNakiya N. Showell1,2, Rachel Thornton1,2, Michael Albert4,3, Lisa A. Cooper2,4\n\n1Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Division of General Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; 2Johns Hopkins Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Health Disparities, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; 3Johns Hopkins Community Physicians, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; 4Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Department of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Optimizing healthcare delivery to eliminate missed opportunities for prevention is critical to improving population health. Clinical prevention often focuses on individual‐level services but can also be delivered at the population level. Neighborhood factors such as healthy food availability (HFA) and crime impact health and may significantly influence the success of behavioral health interventions. We explored patients’ exposures to neighborhood characteristics associated with CVD outcomes for patients from three Johns Hopkins Community Physicians (JHCP) outpatient clinics with a majority of patients living in Baltimore City. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: This study (1) maps the geographic distribution of JHCP patients; and (2) characterizes HFA and crime in JHCP patients’ neighborhoods. Exploratory unadjusted Pearson's Chi‐square analyses tested whether there are significant differences in patients’ neighborhood exposures between clinics. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Among three JHCP clinic sites (N = 24,879 patients), there are statistically significant (p < 0.01) differences in the proportion of patients living in neighborhoods with low HFA (23.8%, 25.6%, 15.2% at Sites A, B and C respectively) and high crime (37.0%, 39.8%, and 16.6% at Sites A, B and C respectively). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Results suggest that tailoring CVD prevention based on predominant neighborhood exposures for patients receiving care at specific sites could be relevant for optimizing patients’ abilities to implement healthy lifestyles changes.\n\n037\n\nNOVEL MULTICOLOR MRI FOR CARDIAC REGENERATIVE MEDICINE\n\nMoriel Vandsburger\n\nPhysiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a reference standard modality for high‐quality anatomical and functional imaging of the heart. Most MR images represent the density of hydrogen protons in water, however, the exchange of magnetic saturation between water and surrounding molecules including collagen, creatine, and with exogenous lanthanide metal contrast agents can be exploited for molecular imaging. Uniquely, each interaction can be probed with radiofrequency energy at specific frequencies. We have developed the first cardiac specific MRI method to perform multicolor molecular imaging through the process of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) imaging, termed cardioCEST. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We used cardioCEST in mice to probe a number of biomarkers of heart failure. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Using cardioCEST, we measured fibrotic scar tissue formation after myocardial infarction, as well as the development of diffuse fibrosis, all via endogenous contrast not requiring gadolinium. In addition, we have utilized cardioCEST to identify early in vivo myocardial metabolic dysfunction, measured as a reduction in cardiomyocyte creatine levels, in response to diet‐induced obesity in the absence of overt structural or functional ventricular failure. Finally, we have labeled multipotent cells with lanthanide metal CEST contrast agents and used cardioCEST to measure in vivo dynamics of cell survival/proliferation or rejection following intramyocardial implantation. In ongoing studies, we have cloned two reporter genes that generate CEST contrast into adeno‐associated viral vectors and are using cardioCEST to perform in vivo imaging of gene therapy. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Further development and application of cardioCEST will enable rapid and noninvasive in vivo multicolor molecular imaging. Ultimately, we strive to make cardioCEST an in vivo analogue of fluorescence microscopy.\n\n038\n\nSEX DIFFERENCE IN 1‐YEAR HEALTH STATUS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\n\nAnne Nzuki1, Rachel Dreyer3, John Spertus2, Harlan Krumholz3, Kevin Kennedy2, Chileshe Nkonde‐Price4, Garth Graham5, Stacie Daugherty6, Donna Buchanan2, Paul Chan2\n\n1Medicine, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Overland Park, Kansas, USA; 2Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute, Kansas City, Missouri, USA; 3Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, USA;4University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; 5Aetna Foundation, Hartford, Connecticut, USA; 6University of Colorado Denver, Denver, Colorado, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Past research suggests that women, compared with men, have worse survival after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, little is known about whether women also have worse recovery of health status (symptoms, function, and quality of life [QOL]) after an AMI. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Across two multicentered US AMI registries (PREMIER and TRIUMPH), we examined whether there were sex differences in health status recovery among 4555 AMI patients using the validated disease‐specific Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ). We compared 1‐year change in SAQ angina frequency and QOL scores for men and women with hierarchical linear regression models that adjusted for demographics, clinical comorbidities, socioeconomic factors, and treatment. To facilitate interpretability, we repeated the analyses for the presence of any angina at 1 year (SAQ angina frequency score <100 vs. 100). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Of 4555 AMI patients, 1481(32.5%) were women. Women were older, more frequently of black race and widowed, and were more likely to have economic barriers to care, including financial difficulty affording medications, and to not be employed. Compared with men, women had lower mean baseline (61.3 ± 23.4 vs. 64.9 ± 22.7) and 1‐year (80.3 ± 21.5 vs. 84.2 ± 19.0) SAQ QOL scores, and less model‐adjusted improvement in QOL at 1‐year (–3.0 SAQ points; 95% CI: –1.8, –4.20; p < 0.001). Although women and men had similar baseline SAQ angina scores (85.0 ± 20.7 vs. 85.8 ± 20.4), they had more frequent angina at 1‐year (91.6 ± 17.6 vs. 94.1 ± 14.9), which persisted after adjustment for all covariates (–2.0 SAQ points; 95% CI: –1.0, –3.0; p < 0.001). Moreover, compared with men, women had a 33% increased odds of any angina at 1‐year (adjusted OR = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.12, 1.59; p = 0.01). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Compared with men, women have worse health status recovery after AMI than men, with lower QOL and more frequent angina.\n\n039\n\nCIRCULATORY SYSTEM DISEASES AT AN INNER CITY ­HOSPITAL USING I2B2 QUERY\n\nNana Osafo1,2, John Kwagyan2,1, William Southerland1,2, Anas Belouali2,1, Adil Alaoui2,1, Victor Apprey1,2, Jane Otado2,1\n\n1Howard University Center for Computational Biology & Bioinformatics, RCMI, Washington, District of Columbia, USA; 2Georgetown‐Howard Universities Center for Clinical and Translational Science (GHUCCTS), Washington, District of Columbia, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the United States, and blacks are disproportionately affected. The purpose of this study was to document the distribution of diseases of the circulatory system at an inner city hospital over a 4‐year period. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: i2b2(Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside), a biomedical computing based query tool designed for cohort identification of patient clinical and demographics characteristic at Howard University Hospital, Washington, DC from 2009 to 2012, was utilized to access deidentified patient record. The i2b2 database currently has data on 188,000 patients with over 500,000 diagnosis. We searched for diseases of the circulatory system using ICD‐9 codes. Descriptive characteristics of disease diagnosis incidence were presented as percentages. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Search resulted in 28,983(∼6%) diagnosis of diseases of the circulatory system. Of these, 15,560 (54%) females, and 25,156 (87%) blacks, and Hispanic, 1,615 (6%). Ages ranged from infancy to over 85 years. The five major diseases of the circulatory system were hypertensive disorders, accounting for 22,651 (78%) diagnosis, venous and lymphatic diseases 7,989 (27.5%) and cardiac dysrhythmias, 3,077 (10.6 %.), ischemic heart disease, 2,900 (10%), and heart failure 2379 (8.2%). Acute rheumatic fever, a rare but potentially life‐threatening disease was diagnosed on three occasions and chronic rheumatic heart disease diagnosed 289 times. Acute myocarditis was diagnosed eight times and acute pericarditis 16 times. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Analysis documents that most circulatory system diseases were result of hypertensive disorders. This highlights the need for blacks to engage in therapeutic lifestyle changes of exercise and diet including reduction of salt intake.\n\n040\n\nSYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION: THE LINK BETWEEN PSORIASIS AND CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE: A STUDY IN HISPANICS\n\nJuan J. Nieves1, Crystal Sulia1, Pablo I. Altieri1,2, Luz Figueroa1, Hector L. Banchs1,2\n\n1Medicine and Physiology, University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus, San Juan, Puerto Rico, USA; 2Cardiovascular Center of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, San Juan, Puerto Rico, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Morbidity and mortality in patients with psoriasis is attributed mainly to cardiovascular disease. Chronic systemic inflammation, and activation of T helper (Th)‐1, Th‐17, regulatory T cells and proinflammatory cytokines might play a key role in the etiology of this theoretical psoriasis‐related atherothrombotic state. There are studies in Caucasians and African Americans, but little is known about how psoriasis affects the development of coronary artery disease in Hispanics. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 46 patients with moderate‐to‐severe psoriasis admitted in the Cardiovascular Center of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean from 2007 to 2013. Coronary angiographic reports were reviewed, and collected data was submitted for statistical analysis. Population median age was 56, and 72% were males. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The majority (63%) of patients had diagnosed metabolic syndrome (MetS). We found that 58.7% of patients had angiographic evidence of obstructive coronary disease (CAD). Thirty percent of patients had positive C‐reactive protein. No prior myocardial infarction or strokes were reported. All of them received either pharmacological or revascularization therapy, according to the current guidelines. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: In Hispanics, there is a lower incidence of CAD compared to Caucasians and African Americans. We believe that persistent systemic inflammation associated to immune‐mediated diseases, such as psoriasis itself, in conjunction with the up‐regulation of inflammatory mediators associated to MetS does increase the risk of developing CAD. Genetics and environmental factors specific to the Hispanic population might explain why some studies have reported a less aggressive CAD in Hispanics, compared to non‐Hispanics. To the best of our knowledge, no study has ever before described the angiographic findings in Hispanic patients with psoriasis, until now.\n\n041\n\nULTRASOUND‐MEDIATED SCAVENGING OF DISSOLVED ­OXYGEN\n\nKevin J. Haworth, Kirthi Radhakrishnan, Kyle Stewart, Christy K. Holland\n\nUniversity of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Excess dissolved gases in blood can affect tissue health and function. Examples include decompression sickness (primarily due to excess nitrogen) or acidosis and vasodilation associated with hypercapnia. Current treatments employ systemic administration of a gas or therapeutic, which can have off‐target effects. The objective of this study is to demonstrate rapid gas scavenging using acoustic droplet vaporization (ADV). METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Pulsed ultrasound exposure induces ADV, the process of converting liquid perfluorocarbon emulsion microdroplets into gas microbubbles. The conversion process triggers a large volumetric expansion of the perfluorocarbon microdroplets, resulting in microbubbles that are significantly undersaturated with air relative to the surrounding fluid. Thereafter, dissolved gases in the surrounding fluid rapidly diffuse into the microbubbles, lowering the dissolved gas concentration in the surrounding fluid. A simple numerical model of the diffusion process based on gas concentration gradients was developed and compared to measurements of dissolved oxygen in an in vitro flow phantom before and after ADV. Because the gas scavenging depends on the microdroplet size, a centrifugation technique was developed to isolate droplets that would pass through the cardiopulmonary system in vivo. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The experimental measurements of dissolved oxygen concentration in the flow phantom agreed with the numerical predictions. The dissolved oxygen concentration was reduced to approximately 25% (relative to air saturation) within 15 s. Centrifugation increased the volume‐weighted fraction of droplets between 2 μm and 5 μm from 29% to 93%. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Feasibility of gas scavenging was demonstrated for oxygen. Future in vivo studies will investigate the scavenging of other gases, such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen.\n\n042\n\nSEX DIFFERENCES IN THE MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOMES OF HFpEF PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE ER WITH ACUTE HF\n\nReka Zsilinszka1, Robert J. Mentz2,3, Adam D. DeVore2,3, Adrian F. Hernandez2,3\n\n1Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 2Division of Cardiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 3Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is increasing in the general population, and women outnumber men by a 2:1 ratio. There is a need for further investigation of the sex differences in HFpEF patients in the emergency room (ER) setting in order to better inform clinical practice in this subpopulation. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We will conduct a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry Emergency Module (ADHERE‐EM) with HFpEF that present to the ER with acute heart failure (AHF). We will describe baseline characteristics (comorbidities, age, blood pressure) of the population of interest and also describe the initial management (e.g., time to diuretic therapy, use of vasoactive therapy, use of observation unit) of patients presenting to the ER by sex. Finally, we will describe in‐hospital and 30 day post–hospital discharge outcomes (e.g., length of stay, mortality, readmission) of the HFpEF patient cohort by sex. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We anticipate that our results with provide important information regarding sex differences in patients with HFpEF in the ER setting. We plan to describe the initial ER management of HFpEF patients who present to the ER with AHF based on sex, as well as to determine whether in‐hospital and 30‐day postdischarge outcomes vary by sex. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: HFpEF represents upward of 50% of the HF population and adverse event rates are similarly high compared with HFrEF. One strategy to investigate the HFpEF population is to explore sex differences. Recent studies have shown parallels between structure‐function changes seen in HF‐PEF and sex differences in cardiovascular function, which suggest that sex‐specific modifications to hypertensive aging in women may cause a greater risk of developing HF‐PEF. These data suggest that a reappraisal of the care of HFpEF patients may inform clinical practice and improve outcomes.\n\n043\n\nTRENDS AND OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WITH ADULT ­CONGENITAL HEART DISEASE WITH PULMONARY ­HYPERTENSION LISTED FOR ORTHOTOPIC HEART ­TRANSPLANTATION IN THE UNOS DATABASE\n\nYamini Krishnamurthy1,2, Lauren Cooper2,3, Adrian Hernandez2,3, Chetan Patel2,3\n\n1Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 2Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 3Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Heart transplantation in patients with adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) is increasing, but remains limited by underlying pulmonary hypertension (PH). The impact of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) on ACHD patients with pretransplant PH is not well‐defined. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Patients with ACHD waiting for heart transplantation were identified from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database from 1987 to 2014. This cohort was then stratified into those patients with PH—defined as a mean pulmonary artery pressure >25 mmHg—and those without PH. Demographics, hemodynamic measurements, MCS‐use, and other medical therapy were compared between PH and non‐PH ACHD patient groups. Outcomes, including survival to transplant and post‐transplant outcomes were assessed as well. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We anticipate that our results will provide important information regarding trends in the utilization of heart transplantation in patients with ACHD. We plan to explore novel relationships between PH in ACHD and posttransplant outcomes. In addition, we plan to assess the influence of MCS on posttransplant outcomes of ACHD patients with PH. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: There is compelling evidence that MCS is able to reverse PH and reduce posttransplant mortality in non‐ACHD patients; however, it remains difficult to extrapolate this understanding to ACHD patients. Reasons for this include complex anatomy, prior surgical procedures, and a residual shunt physiology. This is the first study to examine the impact of MCS and PH in ACHD. Understanding the role of MCS in this patient population will inform clinical practice for patients with ACHD, and will have an important impact on post‐transplant outcomes.\n\n044\n\nNMR‐BASED LIPOPROTEIN PROFILING IDENTIFIES LIPOPROTEIN SUBPARTICLES ASSOCIATED WITH HEART FAILURE WITH REDUCED AND PRESERVED EJECTION FRACTION\n\nWynn G. Hunter1, Jacob Kelly2,3, Carol Haynes4, Damian Craig4, Robert McGarrah1,4, Eric Velazquez1,3, Adrian Hernandez1,3, G. Michael Felker1,3, Svati Shah1,4, William Kraus1,4\n\n1Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 2Duke University Department of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 3Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA; 4Duke Molecular Physiology Institute, Durham, North Carolina, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous population that remains poorly characterized. Lipoprotein profiles (LP) may provide insight into the molecular phenotypes of patients with HFpEF and identify biomarkers for heart failure subtypes. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We identified patients with HFpEF (defined as NYHA class II–IV symptoms and ejection fraction EF ≥ 50%, N = 262), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) (NYHA class II–IV symptoms and EF < 50%, N = 214), and normal controls (no heart failure and EF ≥ 50%, N = 1,810). NMR‐based lipoprotein profiling was performed using LipoProfile, with calculations based on the amplitude and frequency of lipid methyl group NMR signals. After multivariable adjustment for key clinical factors (age, race, sex, BMI, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, COPD, and smoking), values were compared across the three groups with ANCOVA and post hoc t‐tests. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Several lipoprotein subparticles were different in overall ANCOVA analyses after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons: total HDL (p < 0.0001), HDL size (p < 0.0001), small HDL number (p < 0.0001), and total very low density lipoproteins and triglycerides (p = 0.036). Based on post hoc two‐way analyses, the drivers of these results were primarily differences between HFrEF or HFpEF with normal controls, with HFrEF and HFpEF groups similar in profiles. Post hoc two‐way analyses also identified differences between HFpEF and normal controls in medium sized very low‐density lipoproteins (p = 0.046) and HFrEF and normal controls in intermediate‐density lipoprotein (p = 0.034). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Using NMR‐based lipoprotein profiling, we found that HDL lipoproteins differentiate patients with heart failure from normal controls, even after adjustment for clinical factors including BMI, coronary artery disease severity and diabetes.\n\n045\n\nA MOLECULAR SCREEN TO IDENTIFY NOVEL MYOCARDIAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR HUMAN HEART FAILURE\n\nRobert M. Blanton1, Robrecht Thoonen2, Shewit Giovanni1, Suresh Govindan3, Sakthivel Sadayappan3, Gordon Huggins1, Richard Karas1\n\n1Cardiology, Tufts Medical Center, Brookline, Massachusetts, USA; 2Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA; 3Loyola University, Chicago, Illinois, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Heart failure (HF) remains a leading cause of hospitalization and mortality. HF arises from the process of cardiac remodeling: the maladaptive changes in cardiac structure and function in response to pathologic stimuli. Preclinical studies identified that the molecule Protein Kinase G Iα (PKGIα) potently inhibits remodeling. However, drugs which activate PKGIα have largely failed to improve outcomes in humans with HF, due to systemic hypotension arising from the PKGIα vasodilatory effect. Translating preclinical knowlege about PKGIα into improved outcomes in humans with HF will require understanding the specific substrates that PKGIα regulates in the heart. Our objective therefore was to identify cardiac‐specific PKGIα substrates which might serve as novel targets to inhibit remodeling yet avoid excess vasodilation from systemic PKGIα activation. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We performed a molecular screen for myocardial proteins which bind to PKGIα, but not to negative control proteins. We then identified the protein sequence of PKGIα binding proteins and studied these interactions using in vivo preclinical models of heart failure. We next began to explore the regulation of these proteins and their partners in left ventricular tissue from human patients with end stage nonischemic cardiomyopathy. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We identified two proteins not previously known to be regulated by PKGIα in the heart: (1) mixed lineage kinase 3, and (2) cardiac myosin binding protein C. In vivo studies in mice confirmed their roles as novel PKG‐regulated antiremodeling molecules. We have begun to explore their regulation (or dysregulation) in LV tissue from human failing hearts. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These studies reveal two novel PKGIα antiremodeling substrates. Therefore, the strategy of exploring PKGIα substrates in the heart may identify novel therapeutic targets which could inhibit remodeling, yet circumvent the hypotensive effects of systemic PKGI activation.\n\n046\n\nPPAP2B EXPRESSION REGULATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS\n\nPaul Mueller, Andrew Morris, Susan Smyth\n\nPhysiology, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in both men and women worldwide. The bioactive lipid lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) accumulates in human atheroma compared to levels in healthy control tissue. LPA can be degraded by the membrane protein lipid phosphate phosphatase 3 (LPP3), encoded by the gene PPAP2B. Noncoding polymorphisms in PPAP2B associate with CAD risk, and gene expression analysis indicates that individuals possessing the risk allele exhibit lower levels of PPAP2B mRNA in leukocytes. We hypothesize that decreased LPP3, as a result of low PPAP2B expression, accelerates experimental atherosclerosis. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: An inducible knockout of LPP3 was generated using the Cre‐Lox system driven by the MX‐1 promoter in mice on the atherogenic LDL receptor deficient background. Broad knockdown of LPP3 was achieved with IP injection of a synthetic double stranded RNA (pI:pC) at age 3–5 days. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: After 12 weeks on Western diet, LPP3 knockdown mice developed significantly more atherosclerosis by en face analysis compared to littermate controls. Additionally, LPA content determined with LC/MS/MS tended to be higher in the proximal aortas of LPP3 knockdown mice. Real‐time PCR analysis indicated significantly higher macrophage gene expression (CD68) in the LPP3 knockdowns compared to controls. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These results are consistent with accelerated atherosclerosis in LPP3 knockdown mice and suggest a protective role for LPP3 in CAD. Increased vascular LPA content, as a consequence of decreased LPP3 expression, may promote the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages into lesions to accelerate the development of CAD. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into the genome wide association studies that linked genetic variation in PPAP2B with risk of CAD and focus attention on the LPA/LPP3 signaling nexus as a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent atherosclerosis.\n\n047\n\nMUTAGENESIS SCREENING IN ZEBRAFISH SUGGEST ­RETINOID X RECEPTOR, ALPHA A(RXRAA) AS A ­THERAPEUTIC TARGET FOR CARDIOMYOPATHY\n\nXiao Ma, Yonghe Ding, Stephen Ekker, Xiaolei Xu\n\nMayo Graduate School, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Cardiomyopathy is a progressive disease affecting millions of Americans. However, current therapies are mainly palliative. High colony management efforts in vertebrate models prevent a forward genetic strategy to be used for cardiomyopathy. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We are exploring adult zebrafish as a new model for cardiomyopathy. By establishing a strategy to enrich cardiac mutants via an insertional mutagenesis screening, and an efficient approach to stress these mutant zebrafish using a doxorubicin‐induced cardiomyopathy model, we developed an unbiased forward mutagenesis screening approach for systematic identification of genetic modifiers for cardiomyopathy. From a pilot screening of >500 gene‐breaking transposon (GBT) mutants, we identified mtor and GBT419 as two mutants that exert salutary effects on doxorubicin‐induced cardiomyopathy. While mtor inhibition is a known therapeutic strategy for cardiomyopathy, the salutary effects of GBT419 are studies, which might suggest a novel therapeutic strategy. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: A transposon insertion was found in the first intron of retinoid X receptor, alpha a (rxraa) gene in GBT419. Based on the expression of rxraa transcripts and the expression of rxraa downstream target genes including raldh2, cyp26b, rbp1, our preliminary results suggested that the salutary effects of GBT419 is ascribe to gain‐of‐function of rxraa and an activation of retinoic acid pathway. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Novel genes of therapeutic potential can be identified by mutagenesis screening in adult zebrafish. Specifically, genetic manipulation of retinoid X receptor, alpha a (rxraa) was suggested as a novel candidate therapeutic strategy via modulating retinoic acid pathway. Taking advantage of the scalable and nonbiased genetic screening in zebrafish, our approach promises systematically identification of novel therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy.\n\n048\n\nTHE EFFECT OF KV ON CORONARY CALCIUM SCORE, LESION VOLUME, AND DENSITY\n\nJasmeet Singh, Harold I. Litt\n\nRadiology, University of Pennsylvania, Lawrenceville, New Jersey, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: To evaluate the effect of varying kVp levels (70–150) on coronary calcium score, calcification volume and lesion density. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Agatston scoring is a validated method for measuring coronary calcium to predict cardiovascular risk. CT is traditionally performed at x‐ray energy of 120 kV, however newer scanners can perform imaging at lower energy using a lower radiation dose. This score is calculated by multiplying lesion volume (pixels measuring denser than 130 Hounsfield Units) with a weighting factor dependent on the maximum lesion density (highly dependent upon x‐ray energy). We used an anthropomorphic cardiac phantom with six calcified lesion inserts at different concentrations (200, 400 and 800 mg/cm3 each) and performed multiple dual source CT scans to study effects on calcium score. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The relationship between coronary lesion volume and the mean density is quite complex and has several nonlinear dependencies of which x‐ray energy is a significant one. Total score and volume for lower density lesions (200 and 400 mg/cm2) had a nonlinear relationship to kV in comparison to those of a higher density (800 mg/cm2), which had a more linear relationship. Measured lesion volume decreased by 38%, 31%, and 13% from 70–150kVp across 200, 400, and 800 mg/cm3 lesions, respectively. Overall decrease in score for lower density lesions (200 and 400 mg/cm2) was larger (85%, 48%) in comparison to 800 mg/cm3 lesion, where the change was only 21%. This dramatic difference in the change in volume and total score with kVp is likely related to the greater number of pixels below the 130 HU threshold for lower vs. higher density lesions. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Alterations in kVp result in complicated changes in total Agatston score, calcium volume and density. An algorithm allowing translation of lower energy acquisition results to standard measurements will need to adjust for underlying lesion density and size for accurate Agatston scoring.\n\n049\n\nPOPULATION‐BASED STUDY OF AMPUTATIONS DUE TO ­DIABETES AND PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE USING ­STATEWIDE DATA\n\nMisty d. Humphries, Ann Brunson, Patrick Romano, Joy Melnikow\n\nUniversity of California‐Davis, Sacramento, California, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Conflicting data exist regarding changes in amputation rates in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study aims to explore amputation rates due to DM, PAD, or a combination of PAD/DM and determine if population based amputation rates are decreasing in the current treatment era. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Using the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) database, all patients that underwent major amputation were identified. Age adjusted population based amputation risk was determined from 2005 to 2011. Gender and age trends in amputation risk were determined for each disease group. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: From 2005 to 2011, 32,025 amputations were performed in California. Of these, 11,896 patients met the diagnostic criteria for DM (n = 1,095), PAD (n = 4,335), or a combination of PAD/DM (n = 6,466). Population based amputation rates in patients with PAD and PAD/DM are unchanged since 2009, and have continuously increased since 2005 in patients with DM. Patients over the age of 80 with PAD had the most dramatic decrease in amputation rates from 2005 to 2011 from 317 to 175 amputations/million Californians. Men with PAD/DM had amputation rate 1.5 times higher than those of patients with PAD alone and 5 times higher than rates of DM patients. In women the difference between patient with PAD and PAD/DM was not seen; however, these rates were 2.5 times higher than patients with DM alone. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Preventable amputations in high‐risk diseases are no longer decreasing despite advancements in care and education. Octogenarians with PAD represent the highest risk group for amputation. Further research to understand treatment pathways for patient with lower extremity wounds may shed light on pathways for amputation prevention in the future.\n\n050\n\nINFLAMMATION AN ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE: A PARADOX? THE BOGALUSA HEART STUDY\n\nCamilo Fernandez, Rupert Barshop, Wei Chen, Roberto Blandon, Gerald S. Berenson\n\nTulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Systemic inflammation—as measured by high‐sensitivity C‐reactive protein (hs‐CRP)—is adversely associated with arterial compliance. However, information is scant on whether this association in consistent throughout the available noninvasive measurements of arterial compliance in a group of biracial (black‐white), relatively young and healthy adults. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Measurements of hsCRP and noninvasive arterial compliance—large‐artery elasticity index (C1), small‐artery elasticity index (C2), brachial‐ankle pulse‐wave velocity (ba‐PWV) and augmentation index (AI@75)—were assessed in 702 participants with a mean age of 43.5 years (29.4–51.1 years); 70.8% whites and 43.7% males, as a part of the Bogalusa Heart Study. Race‐specific independent associations were tested through multivariable‐adjusted linear regression analyses. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Black vs. white participants had higher hs‐CRP, baPWV and AI@75 (p < 0.01); whereas C1 and C2 were higher in whites (p < 0.01). In race‐specific linear regression analyses, controlling for: age, sex, high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL‐C), low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C), body mass index (BMI), smoking status and other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, hs‐CRP was significantly and independently associated with AI@75 (β = 0.11, p < 0.01) and C1 (β = –0.08, p = 0.04), in whites only. In contrast, black participants did not show any significant associations among these parameters. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These findings help enhance the concept that the association of inflammation and arterial compliance is seemingly relative, as it is dependent on the measurement used to assess the latter; with its impact varying by race (black‐white). Further, these observations may aid in revising existing methodologies used in the diagnosis of inflammation‐mediated structural and functional damage, in addition to enhance race‐specific approaches for screening and prevention of cardio‐metabolic risk factors.\n\n051\n\nENZYMES AND PROGRESSION OF INTIMA MEDIA ­THICKNESS IN YOUNG ADULTS IN A COMMUNITY: THE BOGALUSA HEART STUDY\n\nCamilo Fernandez, Rupert Barshop, Roberto Blandon, Wei Chen, Gerald S. Berenson\n\nTulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Carotid intima‐media thickness (CIMT) progression, a resultant of inflammation‐mediated mechanisms, has been previously shown to be predictive of future cardiovascular events in middle‐age and older adults. Hepatic enzymes, such as gamma‐glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) play a role in the inflammation pathway as extracellular antiinflammatory agents. However, information is scant on the relationship between the progression of carotid intima‐media thickness and the level of liver enzymes in noninstitutionalized, biracial (black‐white) young adults. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Bilateral ultrasound measurements of far‐wall CIMT were obtained from 676 subjects aged 24 to 43 years, enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study (70% whites and 43% men). CIMT and traditional cardiometabolic risk factors were measured at baseline, and a second set of CIMT imaging was performed at follow up after an average of 6.9 years. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Compared to its counterparts, female and white participants exhibited overall lower levels of CIMT and liver enzymes. In race‐specific multivariate‐adjusted logistic regression analyses, controlling for age, sex and traditional cardiometabolic risk factors, GGT was found to be significant, and directly related with progression of CIMT in blacks (OR = 1.01; 95% Confidence Interval [CI] = 1.001–1.02; p = 0.02), but not in whites (OR = 0.99; 95%CI = 0.98–1.01; p = 0.7). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These results suggest a racial component exists in the involvement of GGT as a systemic anti‐inflammatory agent. Further, these observations may aid in supporting the development of race‐specific approaches in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.\n\n052\n\nCAREGIVER TELEPHONE COACHING PROGRAM TO REDUCE HEART FAILURE–RELATED REHOSPITALIZATIONS IN AFRICAN AMERICANS\n\nUbolrat Piamjariyakul1, Carol E. Smith1, Jo Wick2\n\n1University of Kansas Medical Center, School of Nursing, Kansas City, Kansas, USA; 2University of Kansas Medical Center, Department of Biostatistics, Kansas City, Kansas, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: To test the effects of a culturally specific telephone coaching intervention (FamHFcare) for family caregivers. The FamHFcare included strategies for teaching, reinforcement, supporting professional and family partnerships and motivating caregiver involvement in every day practical action plans for HF home care. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: A matched case control group comparison design where 20 caregivers and patients with HF were randomly assigned either to standard care (n = 20) or intervention group (n = 20). Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare change scores between baseline and 6 months postintervention on patients’ HF‐related hospitalizations, caregivers’ confidence, preparedness, social support, depression, and burden between groups. FamHFcare included standard care information and a 4‐weekly post hospital coaching via telephone on specific HF home care skills practice with a teach‐back strategy. Cultural‐specific related content was integrated into the coaching intervention based on previous study, extensive literature review and engagement of the African American population. FamHFcare materials on dietary sodium have been modified for cultural preferences. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: At 6 months after the intervention, patient's HF rehospitalizations were significantly lower in the intervention group. Caregivers’ confidence, social support scores were significant higher; caregivers’ depression scores and two burden activities were significant lower among intervention group. Also 90% of caregivers rated the FamHFcare information as “helpful” in problem‐solving HF‐related home care challenges. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: The cultural‐specific FamHFcare intervention provided African Americans caregivers with practical skills to improve HF home care and reduce patients’ rehospitalizations. This finding warrants further testing in a larger study.\n\n053\n\nCAPTOPRIL WORSENS AORTIC REMODELING ASSOCIATED WITH AORTIC CONSTRICTION AND ANEURYSM FORMATION IN ACTA2 –/– MICE\n\nAndrew Peters1, Jiyuan Chen1, Shao‐Qing Kuang1, Corey Reynolds2, Dianna Milewicz1\n\n1Medical Genetics, UT Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas, USA; 2Mouse Phenotyping Core, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) was used to identify molecular pathways involved in the remodeling of the ascending aorta in response to increased biomechanical forces. Losartan, an angiotensin type I receptor (AT1R) antagonist, attenuated the histologic and inflammatory changes associated with TAC. Mice deficient in smooth muscle α‐actin (Acta2 –/– ) develop root and ascending aortic enlargement. We hypothesized that captopril would be as effective as losartan at attenuating aortic remodeling with TAC and preventing thoracic aortic enlargement in Acta2 –/– mice. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: C57BL/6 mice underwent TAC or sham surgeries (n ≥ 5 per group) and were untreated or treated with captopril or losartan. Two weeks postsurgery, mice were sacrificed and aortas analyzed. One‐month‐old Acta2 –/– mice were treated with captopril for eight months and compared with untreated wild type (WT) and Acta2 –/– littermates (n = 15, 12, and 12, respectively) and aortas assessed by echocardiography. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: TAC induces an increase in aortic wall thickness and diameter, enhanced adventitial macrophage recruitment and expression of inflammatory markers, and adventitial fibroblast proliferation. Captopril significantly decreased mouse survival by over 40% (p = 0.001) and did not attenuate any of the TAC induced histologic changes (p < 0.5 vs. untreated TAC mice, p ≥ 0.05 vs. sham mice). After 8 months, captopril‐treated Acta2 –/– mice showed significantly enlarged aortic roots when compared to the WT (p = 0.004) and Acta2 –/– mice (p = 0.045). Losartan attenuated this phenotype at 6 months. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Captopril treatment was associated with worse outcomes with TAC and increased aortic root growth in the Acta2 –/– mice. Blocking the conversion of angiotensinogen to AngII with captopril may not be as effective as an AT1R antagonist in preventing thoracic aortic disease.\n\nINFECTIOUS DISEASE\n\n124\n\nPROTECTION WITH NONENHANCING CONSERVED LENTIVIRAL CYTOTOXIC T‐CELL EPITOPES USING MULTI‐ANTIGENIC PEPTIDE VACCINES\n\nShannon R. Roff1, Missa P. Sanou1, Alek M. Aranyos1, Ruiyu Pu1, Mobeen H. Rathore2, Jay A. Levy3, Janet K. Yamamoto1\n\n1University of Florida College of Veterinary Medicine, Gainesville, Florida, USA; 2University of Florida Center for HIV/AIDS Research, Education and Service, Jacksonville, Florida, USA; 3University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The failure to elicit high (>80%) protective immunity in recent human and animal trials may be due to the effect of epitopes that enhance HIV infection. In order to avoid viral enhancement and confer protection, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)‐associated epitopes conserved among multiple lentiviruses: HIV‐1, FIV and SIV reverse transcriptase (RT) and p24 were identified, tested for FIV enhancement, constructed into multi‐antigenic peptides (MAPs), and tested in the FIV‐cat model. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: CTL responses were evaluated using IFN‐γ, ELISpot and T‐cell proliferation assays and CTL‐associated cytotoxin production in HIV+ subjects. After epitope screening, Laboratory cats were primed 1x with inactivated FIV vaccine and boosted with multiantigenic peptids (MAP) composed of previously idenfied epitopes including Fp4‐3 + Fp14‐1 (MAP1), Fp14‐1 (MAP1b), and FRT3‐3/3‐4 (MAP2). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: 85% (22/26) of human subjects responded to FIV RT with FRT3‐3 and FRT3‐4 generating the strongest response. 65% (20/31) of the HIV+ subjects responded to FIV p24 peptide by either IFNg or T‐cell proliferation. Epitopes Fp9‐3 and Fp14‐1 induced the strongest cytotoxin response. In vitro inhibition of infection was induced by Fp9‐3 against HIV and FIV, but nonconserved Fp4‐3 enhanced FIV infection. Upon FIV challenge, cats vaccinated with commercial FIV vaccine boosted 3x with MAP1+MAP2 produced sterilizing protection in 1 cat with delay in FIV detection and lower viral set point in 2 cats. The MAP1 group immunized with the most Fp4‐3 had no protection, whereas MAP1b+MAP2 group had 50% partial protection. All placebo and 1x‐primed groups were unprotected. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Multiantigenic peptides using conserved CTL‐based epitopes can be used to create an effective AIDS vaccine however careful selection of eiptopes without viral enhancing activity is required.\n\n125\n\nBACTERIAL VAGINOSIS AND MUCOSAL IMMUNITY IN THE CONTEXT OF HIV AND HSV2 INFECTION\n\nJeremy Gold, Aileen P. McGinn, Lilia Espinoza, Marla J. Keller\n\nMedicine/Infectious Disease, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: HSV2 infection and BV are more prevalent in HIV+ women; however, the relationship of BV and HSV2 in the context of HIV has not been studied. We hypothesized that women who are dually infected (DI) with HIV and HSV2 are more likely to have BV, as measured by Nugent score, compared to women who are singly infected (SI) with HIV or HSV2 or who are dually seronegative (DS). We also assessed the association of BV with levels of immune mediators in the genital tract (GT). METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: 17 DI, 15 SI (HIV+), 14 SI (HSV2+), and 15 DS women had a baseline vaginal swab to define flora consistent with BV (Nugent Score 7–10) and cervicovaginal lavage for measurement of immune mediators. Non‐parametric bivariate tests were used to identify differences in baseline characteristics among the four groups. Logistic regression, both unadjusted and with sequential adjustment for potential confounders, was used to assess the associations between BV and 1) HIV/HSV2 and 2) each immune mediator (log10 transformed) separately. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: There was a significant difference in age and history of douching among the four groups (p ≤ 0.01). Though not significant, the unadjusted odds of BV were 3× greater in DI compared to DS women (OR 3.1, 95% CI 0.70–13.7) and higher in SI with either virus compared to DS women; these associations were similar with adjustment for age or douching. IL1α (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.0), IL1β (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–2.1) and HBD1 (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.41–0.91) were significantly associated with BV with adjustment for HIV/HSV2 infection. Adjustment for age or douching did not alter the associations substantially. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Though not significant, there was a meaningful increase in odds of BV in DI and SI compared to DS women even after adjustment for age and douching. BV was also associated with higher levels of GT inflammatory mediators and lower levels of beta defensins, independent of HIV/HSV2, age and douching.\n\n126\n\nDEFINING ANTIRETROVIRAL PHARMACOKINETICS AND ­VIRAL DYNAMICS IN HIV‐1 RESERVOIRS\n\nCecile D. Lahiri, Igho Ofotokun\n\nMedicine/Infectious Diseases, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Emerging evidence suggests that sites such as the gut and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) remain reservoirs for HIV‐1 and play critical roles in viral persistence. New methods to determine antiretroviral (ARV) drug concentrations necessary to suppress viral replication in these reservoirs are needed. The objectives of our study are to investigate the use of integrated pharmacokinetic (PK)—viral dynamic (VD) population modeling to compare parameters, including area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC0‐24h) and HIV viral decay rate, of dolutegravir (DTG) in three body compartments: blood plasma, PBMCs, and rectal tissue. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In a prospective cohort study, 30 HIV‐1 infected persons will undergo blood plasma, PBMC, and rectal tissue sampling over 12 weeks for DTG drug concentration and HIV‐1 RNA quantification after initiating Truvada + DTG. DTG concentrations will be measured using high‐performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC‐MS/MS) while HIV‐1 RNA will be quantified using RNA extraction, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), and PCR amplification. Model development and simulation will be generated from these data to estimate the concentration of DTG needed to suppress HIV‐1 replication in each site. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We expect to see lower DTG AUC0–24h and HIV viral load decay rate in PBMC and rectal tissue reservoirs compared to blood plasma. In addition, we hypothesize that greater concentrations of DTG would be needed to achieve suppression of HIV‐1 replication in PBMCs and rectal tissue than in blood plasma. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Evaluation and use of innovative strategies to determine ARV exposure and viral load response in reservoir compartments are crucial to understanding pharmacological barriers to HIV cure. A predictive model based on a uniform dose that minimizes the challenge of invasive tissue sampling will be impactful.\n\n127\n\nTHE IMPACT OF INJECTION DRUG USE STATUS ON AIDS‐­ASSOCIATED MORTALITY\n\nNicky Mehtani, Richard Moore\n\nSchool of Medicine/Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: While the advent of Highly Active Anti‐Retroviral Therapy (HAART) has transformed the experience of HIV for millions of patients in developed countries, this success has not been universal. Previous studies have shown higher rates of AIDS‐associated mortality in Injection Drug Users (IDUs) than in non‐IDU HIV patients. Our study aims to assess whether improvements in HIV pharmacotherapy over the past two decades have been associated with decreased relative rates of AIDS mortality in IDUs compared with non‐IDUs. Secondary analyses will assess differences in viral load suppression rates and CD4 count changes between IDU vs. non‐IDU HIV patients. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We will analyze data from a cohort of HIV patients recruited from the Johns Hopkins Moore Clinic between 1995 and 2014. Adjusting for the year of study enrollment, age, sex, race, baseline CD4, baseline viral load, and duration and type of HAART, we will measure AIDS‐associated mortality among IDUs vs. non‐IDUs for 5‐year intervals from 1995 to 2014 and conduct a multivariate analysis of factors associated with AIDS mortality. Anticipated models include Poisson or Beta‐Binomial to assess person‐time and Cox Regression for relative hazard. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Among patients enrolled into our cohort early on, we hypothesize that AIDS‐associated mortality may be greater in IDUs vs. non‐IDUs. However, we anticipate that the magnitude of this difference in mortality will decrease for patients enrolled at later calendar dates. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Past studies have demonstrated barriers in HAART efficacy for IDUs, leading to increased AIDS mortality rates. But HIV pharmacotherapy has changed substantially over the past two decades. A decreased discrepancy in mortality between IDU vs. non‐IDU HIV patients in the later years of HAART may indicate improved adherence among IDUs and may validate the assumed improvements in pharmacotherapy, including increased potency, decreased adverse effects, and greater convenience.\n\n128\n\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATION OF CULTURE‐NEGATIVE ­PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS\n\nMinh‐Vu H. Nguyen, Jacqueline M. Achkar\n\nMedicine, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The objective was to examine the clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with sputum culture‐negative pulmonary TB (PTB) and compare them to those of patients with culture‐positive PTB. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In this cross‐sectional study, we reviewed medical records of HIV uninfected patients who had been diagnosed with PTB at four New York City public hospitals from July 2006 through July 2014. Demographics, symptoms, and radiographic findings of sputum culture‐negative PTB patients were compared to those of sputum culture‐positive PTB patients. Odds‐ratios were reported for comparisons of categorical variables. Medians and p‐values were reported for comparisons of continuous variables. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Of the 93 subjects with PTB, 72 (77%) were sputum culture‐positive and 21 (23%) were culture‐negative based on the first three sputum samples obtained. Compared to culture‐positive subjects, a significantly lower proportion of culture‐negative subjects had productive cough (36.8% in culture‐negative vs. 65.6% in culture‐positive, OR = 0.31, p = 0.03) and less duration of productive cough (median of 0 vs. 1 week, p = 0.02). Further, culture‐negative compared to culture‐positive subjects were more likely to receive a CT scan of the chest (85% vs. 58.1%, OR = 4.09, p = 0.03) and had a significantly lower frequency of cavitation (11.8% vs. 69.4%, OR = 0.06, p = 0.0001) and multilobar infiltrates (23.5% vs. 55.6%, OR = 0.25, p = 0.03). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Compared to culture‐positive PTB, culture‐negative PTB was associated with a decreased frequency of productive cough, cavitation, and multilobar infiltration, but an increased frequency of CT scan of the chest. Despite the small sample size, these findings suggest that cough and cavitation are often absent in culture‐negative TB and should thus not be considered as main clinical criteria for the diagnosis of early PTB. Additional studies with larger sample size are needed to validate these findings.\n\n129\n\nBLOCKING VIRAL ACCESS TO HEPARAN SULFATE INHIBITS HMPV INFECTION\n\nEdita Klimyte, Rebecca E. Dutch\n\nBiochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a paramyxovirus that causes severe respiratory disease in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients worldwide. Despite its clinical significance, there is no treatment or vaccine available. Entry of paramyxoviruses into host cells typically requires the coordinated activity of the attachment protein, G, which interacts with a cell receptor, and the fusion protein, F, which promotes fusion of viral and cellular membranes. However, recombinant HMPV without G is replication competent in animal models, suggesting a unique, dual function of HMPV F. Our group previously showed that HMPV F mediates binding to target cells, and this interaction requires the presence of heparan sulfate (HS), a repeating sulfated disaccharide sugar found on HS‐proteoglycans, a diverse class of cell surface proteins that influence major cell processes. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We tested compounds known to either occlude HS at the cell surface or interact with potential HS‐binding domains on viral proteins by mimicking HS. Variably sulfated derivatives of E. coli K5 polysaccharide interact with HS‐binding proteins and peptide dendrimer SB105‐A10 occludes HS chains on the cell surface. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We found the pretreatment of virus with only the highly sulfated K5 polysaccharides inhibited HMPV infection in multiple human lung cell lines in a dose‐dependent manner, suggesting negative charges resulting from sulfation of HS are critical for interaction with the HMPV F protein. Peptide dendrimer SB105‐A10 inhibited HMPV infection in a dose‐dependent manner as well, suggesting occlusion of HS at the target cell surface is sufficient to prevent viral binding. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These results were also seen in a 3D model of the human lung using Human Airway Epithelium tissues, suggesting these interactions take place during HMPV infection in a physiologically relevant model, and heparan sulfate serves as a potential target for antiviral development.\n\n130\n\nDYNAMICS OF CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE AND THE GUT ­MICROBIOTA IN RECURRENT C. DIFFICILE INFECTION\n\nAnna M. Seekatz, Krishna Rao, Vincent B. Young\n\nInternal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is a leading nosocomial infection, resulting in up to $3B dollars of excess healthcare costs annually. Disruption of the gut microbiota is correlated to initial CDI susceptibility. However, it is currently unknown why 20–30% of CDI patients experience disease recurrence following treatment. This study investigates the potential microbial factors that may impact susceptibility to recurrence in CDI patients. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: To identify the microbial factors involved in developing recurrence, we have used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare changes in the gut microbiota during recurrent CDI. We compared the gut microbiota of patients with recurrent and nonrecurrent CDI over time. Additionally, we compared these to the gut microbiota of recurrent patients treated with fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) and their healthy donors. We have also isolated C. difficile strains from recurrent CDI patients to identify the pathogenic factors involved in developing recurrence. Strain ribotype and toxinotype will be compared to determine whether strain type is correlated to recurrence rate. A subset of strains will also be fully sequenced to determine if specific genes are related to development of recurrent CDI. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Microbiota analysis: we observed that the composition of recurrent patients was dominated by Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, the microbiota of patients treated with FMT resembled that of the donor, for whome the community was most diverse, rather than the community before FMT. Functional genomics: we anticipate that certain C. difficile strains will correlate to recurrence susceptibility. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: These results are part of an ongoing study on the development of recurrent CDI. Future prospective studies in patients that develop recurrent CDI may be helpful in identifying specific community members that confer colonization resistance against C. difficile.\n\n131\n\nPROTECTIVE HIV ANTIBODY RESPONSES ARE LIMITED BY MECHANISMS OF LYMPHOCYTE TOLERANCE\n\nKristin M. Shotts, Pamela Strauch, Michael Harper, Roberta Pelanda, Mario Santiago, Raul Torres\n\nImmunology, University of Colorado‐Anschutz Medical Campus, Thornton, Colorado, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) recognize conserved regions of the HIV envelope trimer, neutralize up to 90% of cross‐clade HIV strains in vitro, and have interesting characteristics, including high levels of somatic hypermutation and auto/poly‐reactive specificities. Multiple anti‐MPER bnAbs have been reported to recognize autoantigens and do not escape B cell central tolerance mechanisms when genetically knocked into mice. Further, bnAb CH98 was identified in an HIV infected individual with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), found to recognize dsDNA, and neutralize multiple HIV strains in vitro. Most recently, four anti‐CD4bs bnAbs were found to recognize human ubiquitin ligase E3A (UBE3A) and the avidity of bnAb‐UBE3A binding correlated with neutralization breadth. From this data, our lab hypothesized that B cell tolerance checkpoints inhibit potentially neutralizing HIV‐Ab responses, and that autoimmune prone individuals are capable of mounting neutralizing Ab responses. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In order to further investigate this and as a proof of principle study, we immunized both wild type and SLE prone strains of mice with both single and multiple doses of HIV envelope or the adjuvant alum alone as a control. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We found that 56% of both alum control and HIV envelope immunized SLE prone mice neutralized multiple heterologous HIV strains 14 days post immunization, which was not observed in wild‐type mice. This neutralizing Ab response was not dependent on HIV envelope immunization and positively correlated with age, but not specifically with antinuclear auto Abs in the sera. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: In these mouse models, it has been reported that the marginal zone B cell compartment increases with age and T cell activation thresholds are lower, which may contribute to the age‐dependent neutralizing Ab responses, along with the immunoglobulin heavy chain repertoire.\n\n132\n\nSTUDYING NOVEL CYTOSKELETON PROTEINS IN ­TOXOPLASMA GONDII FOR POTENTIAL TREATMENT OF TOXOPLASMOSIS\n\nJun Liu, Ke Hu\n\nBiology, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Toxoplasma gondii is an apicomplexan parasite. It can cause toxoplasmosis. Currently, there is no vaccine against the parasite and available medicines often cause severe side effects. In order to change this situation, I am searching for novel mechanism that can be used to target the parasite. I focus on novel microtubule associated proteins in parasite because they are believed responsible for special properties of parasite cortical microtubules, a feature making the parasite distinct from human host cells. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: First, I used proteomic and bioinformatic approaches to search for novel microtubule associated proteins in T. gondii. Then I confirmed their localization to the cortical microtubules using fluorescence microscopy method and tested their interaction with microtubules using biochemical method. Lastly, I investigated their roles in parasite by genetic manipulations, including gene knockout and transient and inducible overexpression. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: I discovered a set of novel microtubule associate proteins in T. gondii. One of those proteins, TLAP2, localizes to two distinct sections on the cortical microtubules. It has potent microtubule binding and bundling activities both in vitro and in vivo. Knocking out of tlap2 gene shows no obvious morphology or growth defects. However, overexpression of TLAP2 severely disorganizes cortical microtubules and disrupts cell shape. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: TLAP2 is the first microtubule bundling factor discovered in Apicomplexa. It plays a regulatory role in the organization of the cortical microtubules and the cortical microtubules are important to maintain normal cell shape. The loss of TLAP2 is compensated by other factor in parasite, likely another microtubule associated protein. I am searching for the compensating factor using a candidate approach.\n\n133\n\nHIV+ AND THE FISHING COMMUNITIES OF LAKE ­VICTORIA, UGANDA: A CROSS‐SECTIONAL STUDY OF BASELINE ­CHARACTERISTICS\n\nMegan Hosein, Larry Chang\n\nJohns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The fishing villages around Lake Victoria have historically been a challenging setting for HIV service implementation, and have a much higher HIV prevalence than the rest of Uganda. Rakai Health Sciences Project (RHSP) conducts HIV research and provides care for over 10,000 patients in Uganda, and recently extended programs to the fishing villages in 2011. This study aims to assess differences of the fishing village participants that may influence HIV care outcomes. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: HIV‐positive, ART‐naive adults were recruited to a peer health worker RCT from the Rakai Community Cohort Study, from patients presenting to RHSP clinics for HIV testing (“walk‐in”), and from the fishing villages. Baseline questionnaires given to all participants consisted of questions related to HIV knowledge, behaviors, motivation, and access to care. Outcomes of interest included access to care, distance to clinic, alcohol use, condom use, and recent sexual activity. Multiple logistic regression controlling for age and sex will be used to estimate Prevalence Risk Ratios with 95% CI. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: 442 total participants were enrolled: 148 from fishing villages (FV), 148 from walk in (WI), 146 from cohort (C). For FV vs. WI, C: Alcohol use (71% vs. 47%, 52% ); sex in past 12 months (95% vs. 84%, 91%); condom use (57% vs. 41%, 46%); sex with >1 partner (62% vs. 33%, 35%); previously visited a HIV clinic (52% vs. 96%, 40%); travel time to clinic in minutes (17 vs. 46, 34). DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Among fishing village participants, alcohol use, condom use, sex within past 12 months, and sex with multiple partners was higher than among walk‐in and cohort participants. Travel time to clinic was less in the fishing villages. This study may offer insight into characteristics of fishing village participants that influence HIV care outcomes, with implications for the PeerCARE study and future RHSP programming in the community.\n\n134\n\nASSESSING MALAWIAN WOMEN'S WILLINGNESS TO SELF‐COLLECT VAGINAL SAMPLES FOR HUMAN PAPILLOMAVIRUS TESTING\n\nAllahna Esber1, Abigail Norris Turner1, John Phuka2, Alison Norris1\n\n1Epidemiology, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA; 2University of Malawi, Lilongwe, Malawi\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Malawi has the highest age‐adjusted cervical cancer incidence in the world. Among those women diagnosed with cervical cancer, the case fatality is nearly 80%. In many countries, incidence of cervical cancer has been dramatically reduced through regular screening. However, screening programs in eastern Africa are limited due to lack of health delivery infrastructure, limited health budgets and competing healthcare priorities. In under‐screened populations, public health programs that facilitate self‐collection of vaginal samples for HPV testing have seen increased uptake in screening. The objective of this study was to determine women's willingness to self‐collect a vaginal sample in the home for HPV testing. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We used data from the baseline survey of a community‐based cohort study conducted among 661 women in rural Lilongwe District, Malawi. Participants were given a questionnaire assessing willingness to self‐collect a sample for HPV testing, concerns about testing and other hypothesized correlates of willingness to self‐collect. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The majority of women (67%) reported willingness to self‐collect a vaginal sample in the home. The most commonly reported concerns were fear of collecting the sample incorrectly (21%), the self‐swab procedure might hurt (20%), and the results obtained through self‐collection may not be accurate (19%). Forty percent of women reported no concerns with self‐collection. Older age, perceived approval of friends, partner and clinician, and higher education were all significantly associated with increased willingness to self‐collect a vaginal sample for HPV testing. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: We found that in this population, self‐collection of vaginal samples may be acceptable and has the potential to promote scaling up of an HPV test. Increased screening can reduce the high burden of cervical cancer in this community.\n\n135\n\nINADEQUATE CONTROL OF STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS QUORUM SENSING BY HOST IMMUNITY IN COMPLICATED ABSCESS INFECTIONS\n\nJon Femling, Alex Vold, Pamela Hall\n\nEmergency Medicine, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Abscess infections frequently present to the Emergency department, yet we have a limited understanding of the molecular determinants of disease severity. This gap in knowledge has important ramifications for the development of antimicrobials. The goal of this work was to determine the concentration of host immune mediators including IFN‐γ, IL‐17, IL‐1β, and TNF‐α and apolipoprotein B (apoB) in complicated and simple infections. We hypothesized that complicated infections would have increased inflammatory cytokines, yet decreased apoB and thus a defect in bacterial quorum sensing control. To test this hypothesys, we measured both host immunity and bacterial virulence in complicated and simple abscesses. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We obtained abscess fluid from subjects presenting to the Emergency Department with simple and complicated infections as defined by current clinical guidelines. We then performed multiplex protein analysis and quantitative‐PCR on samples. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We found differences in cytokine profiles with complicated abscesses having increased IFN‐γ, IL‐17, IL‐1β, TNF‐α, and decreased IL‐10 when compared to simple abscesses. In addition, we found that apoB, which disrupts bacterial quorum sensing, was lower in complicated infections. This decrease in host apoB was associated with increased expression of bacterial quorum sensing dependent virulence factors including: dltA, isdB, and pvl. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Together these findings translate clinical findings of disease severity into molecular determinants of pathogenesis and reveal a potential mechanism by which future antimicrobials could enhance treatment. Specifically, these data reveal a potential role for quorum sensing inhibitors as a way of augmenting defective host immunity.\n\n136\n\nRAPID, WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING OF ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS PROVIDES GENETIC VIRULENCE AND EPIDEMIOLOGIC INFORMATION\n\nDarrell L. Dinwiddie1, Walter Dehority1, Kimberly Paffett1, Kevin Harrod2, Gross Steve3, Gary Schroth3, Stephen Young4\n\n1Pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Science Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA; 2The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA; 3Illumina, San Diego, California, USA;4TriCore References Lab, Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Respiratory infections cause the greatest morbidity and mortality of all pediatric ailments. Despite the enormous medical burden caused by respiratory viruses the specific genetic variation that influence transmission, virulence, and pathogenesis are poorly understand for most viruses. The objective of this study is to develop a clinical test that can both detect infections and identify genetic variation that may influence these critical processes while providing epidemiologic surveillance intelligence. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: We have developed the UNM ResInfect Panel, a novel, innovative hybridization‐based method to enrich whole viral genomes of 34 respiratory viruses directly from clinical nasopharyngeal samples. The samples are then sequenced in a rapid manner on the Illumina MiSeq. A custom bioinformatic pipeline is then used to determine the specific virus, to detect genetic variation, and identify the closest previously sequenced virus providing epidemiologic data. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: De‐identified, residual nasopharyngeal swabs of 48 previously classified viral infections were obtained from TriCore Reference Labs and sequenced using the UNM ResInfect method. We were able to identify viral infections in 41 of the 48 samples tested using reference guided alignment to a custom viral genome database. We were able to conduct genomic variant characterization and whole genome phylogenetic analysis by completing hierarchical clustering to previously sequenced viral strains. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Our results suggest that enrichment and next‐generation sequencing can be used for the detection and characterization of acute respiratory infections in a culture independent, high‐throughput, low cost manner. Furthermore, the method can detect specific pathogen strain, genetic resistance to therapeutics, genetic mutations that may influence virulence, and has the ability to provide epidemiologic intelligence.\n\n137\n\nCHRONIC MYCOPLASMA GENITALIUM INFECTION ELICITS CERVICITIS AMONG HIV(+) NEW ORLEANS WOMEN: IMPLICATIONS FOR SCREENING AND TREATMENT\n\nPatricia M. Dehon, Michael E. Hagensee, Chris L. McGowin\n\nMicrobiology, Immunology, and Parasitology, LSU Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging sexually transmitted pathogen associated with chronic inflammatory conditions including cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubal factor infertility. It is hypothesized that cervical inflammation due to M. genitalium infection negatively impacts HIV disease progression and may increase HIV transmission through enrichment of infected cells in the cervical mucosa. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: In a retrospecitve manner, we utilized a longitudinal cohort of 108 HIV(+) New Orleans women enrolled into the HIV Outpatient Program (HOP) who visited the clinic approximately once every three months from 2009 to 2014. The cohort consisted of older, primarily black women with an average CD4 count of 484. STI testing, analysis of cervial secretions, cervical cytology/histology, and a chart review were performed. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Over the study period, the cumulative prevalence of M. genitalium or T. vaginalis was 21% and 27%, respectively. Three of these women were chronically infected with M. genitalium (2.8%). Chronically infected women had lower CD4 counts compared to women without M. genitalium infection. Peripheral HIV viral loads were similar in both groups. The concentrations of several pro‐inflammatory cytokines and chemokines measured from cervicovaginal lavages were significantly higher in subjects with M. genitalium, including IL‐8, MCP2, IL‐1β, GM‐CSF, MDC, and IL‐6. All chronically infected women showed signs of chronic cervical leukocytosis that was ablated upon antibiotic treatment. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: Together, these results indicate that M. genitalium is a cause of chronic cervicitis, may enhance HIV transmission in the lower reproductive tract, and treatment appears to ablate these signs. Screening and treatment may be warranted among HIV(+) women.\n\n138\n\nGOOGLE FLU TRENDS SPATIAL VARIABILITY VALIDATED AGAINST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PNEUMONIA AND INFLUENZA VISITS\n\nJoseph Klembczyk1, Mehdi Jalalpour2, Raynard Washington3, Jesse Pines4, Richard Rothman1, Andrea Dugas1\n\n1School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins Univerisity, Baltimore, Maryland, USA; 2Cleveland State University, Cleveland, Ohio, USA; 3AHRQ, Rockville, Maryland, USA; 4George Washington University, Washington, District of Columbia, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Google Flu Trends (GFT) is a surveillance tool that gathers data on local internet searches to estimate influenza‐like illness. GFT has been proven to strongly correlate with influenza incidence, but requires further geographical validation. We sought to evaluate the correlation between city‐level GFT and ED visits for pneumonia and influenza (P&I) in several geographically distinct US cities. We then investigated potential factors that may contribute to the variability in that correlation. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project data, we collected weekly counts of ED visits for all patients with ICD‐9 codes for P&I from 2005 to 2010 in 19 different US cities. We then calculated the correlation between city‐level GFT and the volume of P&I‐related ED visits in each city as a measure of GFT effectiveness. Eight city‐level indicators hypothesized to affect GFT performance were collected for all 19 cities. Univariate regressions were performed between the indicators and GFT effectiveness along the 19 cities. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Correlation between city‐level GFT and ED visits for P&I from 19 different cities was overall strong with a median of 0.84 (range 0.67–0.93). When regressing GFT performance against city‐level indicators, percent female and number of ED visits per person demonstrated the most significant positive correlations. Percent hispanic/latino and socioeconomic status yielded the most prominent negative correlation with GFT effectiveness. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: We demonstrate a strong correlation between city‐level GFT and ED visits for P&I across numerous US cities. We also identified several city‐level characteristics that impact this correlation. Establishing broad geographic generalizability and explaining variability of city‐level GFT is key to understanding its capabilities and further integration into other surveillance or forecasting models.\n\n139\n\nIGG ANTI‐HA FC GLYCOFORM MODULATION IS PREDICTIVE OF INFLUENZA VACCINE EFFICACY\n\nTaia Wang, Jad Maamary, Sarah Schlesinger, Jeffrey Ravetch\n\nMolecular Genetics and Immunology, Rockefeller University, New York, New York, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Protective antiviral vaccines elicit high affinity, antigen‐specific neutralizing antibodies through secondary diversification mechanisms involving the selection of B cells bearing somatically hypermutated antigen receptors. This selection process involves the interaction of the B cell receptor with antigen retained in the form of immune complexes, thus dictating that Fc‐Fc receptor (FcR) interactions contribute to the selection process. FcRs are diverse in function and can transduce immunomodulatory, activating, or inhibitory signaling; the sum of these activities contributes to the generation of protective IgGs. Immune complex‐FcR interactions are governed by the precise structure of Fc domains within an immune complex, which, in turn, depends on the subclass distribution and Fc glycan composition of antigen‐specific serum IgG. We performed the first detailed structural analysis of IgG Fc domains following influenza virus vaccination and found complex regulation of both subclass and Fc glycoforms. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: The vaccination study was conducted at the Rockefeller University Hospital in New York City in accordance with a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of Rockefeller University (protocol #TWA‐0804). RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: The abundance of sialylated Fc glycans on HA‐specific IgG was found to predict the quality of vaccine response suggesting a mechanism by which sFc glycans modulate B cell activation thresholds, thereby driving the production of neutralizing, high affinity IgGs. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: That sialylated IgG produced during the early plasmablast response is correlated with subsequent production of neutralizing antibody suggests a possible requirement for immunomodulatory Type 2 FcR signaling in the ontogeny of a protective response elicited by TIV. These results suggest that Type 2 FcR signaling might be exploited to enhance protection achieved through vaccination against influenza viruses and other pathogens.\n\n140\n\nSCHISTOSOMICIDAL OXAMNIQUINE DERIVATIVE DRUG ­ACTIVITY AGAINST HUMAN SCHISTOSOMIASIS\n\nStacey Stahl1, Alex B. Taylor2, Xiaohang Cao2, Stephen Holloway2, P. John Hart2, Stanton McHardy3, Timothy J. Anderson4, Philip T. LoVerde2\n\n1Department of Microbiology, UTHSCSA, San Antonio, Texas, USA; 2Department of Biochemistry and Pathology, UTHSCSA, San Antonio, Texas, USA; 3Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, USA;4Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas, USA\n\nOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: Human schistosomiasis is a disease which globally affects over 200 million people. The major species effecting humans are S. mansoni, S. haematobium, and S. japonicum. There is currently only one method of treatment (monotherapy), the drug Praziquantel (PZQ). Evidence of resistance to PZQ has arisen in the field. The purpose of this research is to develop a second drug for use in conjunction with PZQ. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Previous treatment of S. mansoni included the use of oxamniquine (OXA), a prodrug that is enzymatically activated in S. mansoni but is ineffective against S. haematobium and S. japonicum. The OXA activating enzyme was identified, described, and crystallized by our laboratory as being a sulfotransferase. S. haematobium and S. japonicum express homologous sulfotransferases that have differing OXA contact residues. OXA derivatives synthesized were engineered by the Center for Innovation in Drug Discovery (CIDD) based on these residue interactions. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: Initially, 12 OXA derivatives were synthesized, of which three showed schistosomicidal activity against S. mansoni equal to or better than OXA. An iterative process was used to create, thus far, 4 generations of derivatives. Of the derivatives created, 8 were more schistosomicidal than OXA against S. mansoni. Further in vitro tests of these 8 derivatives yielded 2 derivatives with schistosomicidal activity against S. haematobium. Further testing of these derivatives against S. japonicum is ongoing. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF IMPACT: This iterative process of using structural data to inform chemical synthesis of derivatives, which are then tested in vitro, continues to provide us with novel compounds with improved antischistosomal activity. An OXA‐derivative drug would have a mechanism of action distinct from PZQ, hindering the pathogen's ability to adapt to chemotherapy. The intent of this work is to reengineer OXA to be effective against all human schistosome species.\n\n141\n\nKNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES ABOUT EBOLA VIRUS ­INFECTION AMONG RESIDENTS, PHYSICIANS AND NURSES IN A TEACHING MEDICAL CENTER\n\nJeff Ziffra, Arsalan Khan, Amisha Shah, Rasha Issa, Armand Krikorian\n\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago/Advocate Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn, Illinois, USAOBJECTIVES/SPECIFIC AIMS: The Ebola virus (EB) epidemic has exposed varied levels of preparedness across the United States. For teaching hospitals, the ACGME guidance statement set the expectation that residents and fellows will be fully trained to appropriately respond to the disease under the supervision of qualified faculty. Yet, ACGME acknowledged the lack of availability of properly trained physicians in dealing with the management and infection control of Ebola virus disease. Our goal is to assess the knowledge and attitudes towards EB infections among health care workers and compare nurses, residents and teaching faculty across specialties.
