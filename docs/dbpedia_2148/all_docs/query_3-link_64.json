That’s why Reliant offers MyChart, a free and secure online patient portal that provides you with a quick way to connect to your doctor’s office from any device with Internet access. MyChart makes it easier for Reliant patients to manage their care. That’s why we want to make sure you know about all the convenient features MyChart offers!\n\nIf you haven’t checked out MyChart recently, you may be surprised by some of the new capabilities. For instance, if you are an adult patient, you can now directly schedule some of your primary care appointments through MyChart, choosing the time and day that’s most convenient for you. MyChart even lets you choose the type of appointment you need, whether a follow-up visit or a physical exam.\n\nSave time with an E-visit\n\nIf you can’t take time off work to see your caregiver, MyChart allows E-visits for certain types of conditions – all at no charge to you! Adult patients can have an E-visit for sinus problems, red eye, cough/colds, back pain, and urinary symptoms (female only). E-visits utilize a detailed questionnaire that you fill out online. After receiving the information, your doctor’s office will get back to you promptly with a health recommendation, including a prescription if needed.\n\nOne of the more interesting features of MyChart is that it makes it easy to track health changes over time. You can check your weight at each of your last visits as well as see if your blood pressure has gone up or down. Plus your surgical history and family medical history is also available. To view this information, just look under the Health Trends and History sidebar.\n\nNeed a prescription renewal? MyChart does that too.\n\nAnother convenient feature of MyChart is that you can request a prescription renewal without having to call your doctor’s office. Just click on the “Request RX Renewal” icon and you will see a list of all the medications that have been prescribed for you. Then, with just a few clicks you can have that prescription renewed and ready to pick up at the pharmacy of your choice. It’s that simple.\n\nMyChart even makes it easier to pay your bill. You can view outstanding balances and then pay your bill using a credit or debit card. There is also an insurance summary that includes your type of plan and member number if you need it. All this is available under the Billing and Insurance sidebar.\n\nEasy-to-use mobile apps"
