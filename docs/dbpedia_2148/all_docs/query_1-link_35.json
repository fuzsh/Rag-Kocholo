        "text": "An extraordinary vision requires an extraordinary learning environment. To fully bring our vision for education to life, new, state-of-the-art facilities that unite Rowland Hall on one campus are essential. A single, integrated campus designed for transformative education will further elevate learning, amplify teaching, expand programmatic and collaborative opportunities, and bring our community together. To accomplish this transformation, we are called to unlock Rowland Hall’s full potential and to show what’s possible in education.\n\nBecause the world awaits, our new campus cannot.\n\n\"To us, Rowland Hall is more than a school—it's a community. Unifying on one campus intentionally constructed to cultivate deep connections will further enhance our strong sense of community, enabling our students to build relationships and friendships that will last far beyond their time on campus.\"\n\n“The innovative new campus we’re building opens up endless possibilities for our program and students. I envision cross-divisional collaboration and student-driven research, either independently or with local experts, to solve real-world problems. These things are happening now, but state-of-the-art, purpose-built facilities will amplify what we can do as a school.”\n\n“Generations of Rowland Hall families before us have given generously to create the school that our kids benefit from today. Yes, we’re excited for our kids to be on the new campus. But really, we want to pay it forward for the next generation of Rowland Hall students to come.”\n\nWe are grateful to all of our donors for investing in the future of Rowland Hall. Your generosity will make possible a new vision for education—a vision of extraordinary teaching and learning that reimagines what the future looks like for our students and the world. If you haven’t yet donated, we encourage you to join us as we undertake the most significant transformation in our history."
