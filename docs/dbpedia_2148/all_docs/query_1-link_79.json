        "text": "Putting on a full-scale musical is an enormous undertaking. There are sets to paint, costumes to sew, lights to hang, and much more. Our shows would not be possible without our wonderful volunteers.\n\nPeninsula Youth Theatre requires a minimum of 25 hours of volunteer time from each family participating in a CenterStage production (15 hours for the second child and 5 hours per child after that). Without this contribution of time and energy, it would be prohibitively expensive for us to put these shows on stage.\n\nDon’t have a child in the cast but still want to volunteer? PYT will be happy to have your help! Non-parent volunteers must be fingerprinted and pass a routine background check. For more information about how you can become a PYT volunteer, email lhatten@pytnet.org.\n\nA few things to know about our show specific volunteer positions:\n\nMany volunteer positions require more than the minimum 25 hour commitment, particularly those in the theatre during the run of the show. These are very important positions that must be filled by committed people, so please understand what is expected of you before signing up for any of these roles. If you sign up for a position in the theatre, you should plan on working at ±5 performances as well as several nights of Tech rehearsal.\n\nFor the safety of all our volunteers, performers and staff, volunteers must follow the instructions of PYT and MVCPA staff at all times\n\nLoad-in and Strike (when we move the show in and out of the theater) are crucial to the success of the show and require a great deal of effort. ALL families are expected to participate in Load In and Strike. This is in addition to the expected 25 hours.\n\nWhen volunteers don’t show up as expected, the work still needs to get done. Either other volunteers will have to fill the void, or more commonly, PYT must hire professional crew at great expense. This is an especially big concern during Load-in and Strike.\n\nEnjoy yourself! Whether you have a special talent to contribute or want to learn a new skill, there is a place for you. Parent volunteers are an important part of the PYT community, and volunteering is a great way to feel connected to the process.\n\nNow….which committee is right for you?\n\nBackstage Crew\n\nDo you like to be part of the action happening on stage during the show?
