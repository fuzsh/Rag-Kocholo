Jefferson and Charlottesville

Jefferson was born April 13, 1743 at Shadwell in Virginia. Interesting that a man who drafted our Declaration of Independence, became our 3rd President and founded the University of Virginia decided to live in Charlottesville.

Certainly he could have lived anywhere as he traveled overseas as Secretary of State and had intimate knowledge of the United States as he was the one who sent Lewis and Clark to map out the west.

Jefferson built his home, Monticello with a few miles of his birth place overlooking Charlottesville and the University of Virginia.

When her died on July 4th, 1826 he wanted his tombstone to reflect the things he had given to people and not what was given to him.

Below is what is written on his tombstone:
