        "text": "Thomas Jefferson\n\nPeople who met Thomas Jefferson remembered him.\n\nAt six feet, two and a half inches tall, Jefferson towered over other people. His lively personality and vast interests towered over them as well. Daniel Webster remarked that Jefferson's \" general appearance indicates an extraordinary degree of health, vivacity, and spirit.\n\nJefferson used his brilliant mind, his unending curiosity, and his great energy to do it all. In 1782, the Marquis de Chastellux wrote that in the wilds of Virginia, he had found, \"An American, who ... is musician, draftsman, surveyor, astronomer, natural philosopher, jurist, and statesman.\" Jefferson's accomplishments cover the sciences and the arts, public service as politician and statesman, an interest in the American frontier, and a diplomatic career in France.\n\nBorn April 13, 1743, into a wealthy and distinguished Virginia family, Jefferson inherited land and hundreds of slaves. What Jefferson thought about slavery remains an enigma. That means it's a puzzle. For all his fine words on every man's right to freedom, Jefferson kept slaves and only freed a handful in his lifetime.\n\nJefferson practiced law and served in local government. On his plantations, he practiced new, scientific farming methods and designed and built Monticello, one of the most beautiful homes in America.\n\nIn 1776, the Continental Congress chose Jefferson to draft the colonies' Declaration of Independence from Britain. Considered the greatest state document in western civilization, the declaration proclaims that all men are equal in rights and that government is the servant of the people.\n\nAfter the United States won independence, Jefferson served his new nation as minister to France. While there, he studied European culture and sent home books, seeds and plants, statues and architectural drawings, and scientific instruments.\n\nJefferson became secretary of state for President George Washington and later vice president to John Adams, and finally president. Always curious, President Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Territory, which had doubled the size of the nation.\n\nFor the last seventeen years of his life, Jefferson returned to Monticello. He continued his scientific interests, entertained important visitors, played with his grandchildren, and still found time to found the University of Virginia. He sold his collection of 6,700 books to the government. Jefferson's books became the Library of Congress.\n\nJefferson died on July 4, 1826, the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence and just hours before his close friend John Adams. On his tombstone, Jefferson ordered the following inscription and not a word moreÂ—\n\nHere was buried\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nAuthor of the Declaration of American\n\nIndependence of the Statute of Virginia\n\nfor religious freedom & Father of the\n\nUniversity of Virginia"
