        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: Thomas Jefferson—the third president of the United States—was the chief author of the Declaration of Independence. During his presidency the size of the United States was doubled by the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nJefferson entered politics in 1769 as a member of the Virginia legislature. He opposed British authority and taxation of the American colonies. In 1775 he joined the Continental Congress, where he argued for independence from Britain. And in 1776 Jefferson was chosen to draft the formal Declaration of Independence. This document contains some of the most important and influential writing in American political history.\n\nAfter George Washington became the country's first president, in 1789, he appointed Jefferson as the first secretary of state. During this time Jefferson urged the United States to maintain its alliance with France and to allow greater autonomy—or independence—for state governments. These positions put him at odds with the Federalist Party, led by Vice President John Adams and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton. In response, Jefferson founded the Republican Party with James Madison. Later renamed the Democratic-Republican Party, this was the forerunner to the present-day Democratic Party.\n\nAfter Washington's second term, Jefferson ran for president but lost to Adams. He became vice president instead. The political differences between the two men strained the Adams administration. In 1800 Jefferson again ran for president against Adams, and this time Jefferson won.\n\nThe most significant achievement of Jefferson's presidency was the Louisiana Purchase. In 1803 the United States acquired the entire Louisiana Territory from France. This vast addition of land doubled the size of the United States at the cost of only about three cents an acre.\n\nIn July 1803 Jefferson sent Meriwether Lewis and William Clark on an expedition to explore the new territory and to find a route to the Pacific Ocean. The explorers met with a number of Native American tribes and gathered significant knowledge of the geography, plants, and animals of the West.\n\nJefferson's role in the Louisiana Purchase is celebrated at Mount Rushmore, a monument that honors four American presidents. Jefferson is recognized for expanding the borders of the United States across the continent.\n\nAt the end of his second term as president, Jefferson retired to Monticello, his Virginia estate. He had designed and built the mansion on a mountain over the course of 40 years. It is one of the finest examples of the early Classical Revival style found in the United States.\n\nMonticello is just one of Jefferson's architectural legacies. As secretary of state and then as president, Jefferson had a large influence on the development and design of the nation's federal buildings, leading one historian to call him \"the father of our national architecture.\"\n\nJefferson also laid out the campus for the University of Virginia and designed its first buildings. He founded the university in 1819, advocating for publicly supported education. Jefferson sought to create an \"academical village,\" where learning would coexist with daily life for students and faculty. His original village still remains at the center of the university's campus. Together the University of Virginia and Monticello have been named a UNESCO World Heritage center."
