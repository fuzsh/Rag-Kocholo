Jefferson spent the three years learning the intricacies of the law under Wythe and was admitted to the bar in 1767.[5] Wythe's tutelage had a profound impact on the young lawyer. In his autobiography, Jefferson recognized Wythe as one of the three most influential men in his life, along with Dr. Small and Jefferson’s benefactor, Peyton Randolph.[6] Jefferson described Wythe as \"my faithful and beloved mentor in youth and my most affectionate friend through life\"[7] and \"my ancient master, my earliest and best friend.\"[8]\n\nIn 1769, Jefferson added a political career to his practice of law, being elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses.[9] He gained notoriety for his support of the revolutionary cause, and in 1775 Jefferson was elected to the Second Continental Congress where he began drafting revolutionary state papers.[10] In June, 1776, Jefferson was tasked to draft a declaration of independence from Britain that would fairly represent all 13 colonies.\n\nJefferson's political career continued after his service in the Continental Congress. He served as Governor of Virginia (1779-1781), Minister to France (1785-89), Secretary of State (1790-1793), Vice President (1797-1801), and ultimately as President of United States (1801-1809).\n\nFinished with politics after his second term as president, Jefferson retired to Monticello, the home he had built near Charlottesville, Virginia. As an avid student of architecture, he modeled the house after the work of Italian Renaissance master Andrea Palladio;[11] he repeated a similar design in his later works—the Virginia Capitol, Poplar Forest, and the University of Virginia.[12]\n\nJefferson wrote his own epitaph. In it, he identified the accomplishments of which he was most proud: the Declaration of Independence, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom, and the founding of the University of Virginia.[13] Jefferson died at Monticello on July 4th, 1826 — the 50th anniversary of the announcement of American independence. Coincidentally, John Adams, a partner in the Continental Congress, a bitter political rival, and ultimately a rediscovered friend, died on the same day. Adam's reported last words, knowing nothing of Jefferson's death earlier on that same morning, were \"Thomas Jefferson still survives.\"[14]\n\nWythe books willed to Jefferson\n\nWhen George Wythe died in 1806, he willed his library and scientific equipment to Jefferson. Of the 332 titles listed on an inventory made by Jefferson, he kept 149 titles for his own library, and gave away 183 to various family members, a joiner who worked at Monticello, and his grandson's tutor. The list of books Jefferson retained follows, and is subdivided into categories assigned by Jefferson.[15] Click on the titles to learn more about the works.\n\nPage 6\n\nBooks retained by Jefferson\n\nMain article: Jefferson Inventory\n\nPage six of Jefferson's inventory of books received from George Wythe's estate, September, 1806.
