        "text": "Thomas Jefferson chose to be remembered for three items when he ordered engraved on his tombstone:1\n\nHere was buried\n\nThomas Jefferson\n\nAuthor of the Declaration of American Independence\n\nof the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom\n\n& Father of the University of Virginia\n\nDespite his instructions, the words were inscribed on a marble slab that was placed next to a granite shaft installed at his grave in 1833. Jefferson's dates of birth and death were carved on the granite. Visitors seeking a memento of Jefferson chipped off pieces of the tombstone. In 1836 the new owner of Monticello, Uriah Phillips Levy, moved the marble slab to the house for safekeeping.\n\nAfter Levy died, Monticello was largely abandoned for 20 years as heirs disputed the directions in his will to donate Monticello for non-profit use. During that time, including the Civil War, more damage occurred to the granite shaft.\n\nWhat visitors to Monticello see today is a replacement funded by the US Congress and installed in 1883. The original granite obelisk is at the University of Missouri.1\n\nthe monument at Thomas Jefferson's tomb, 1881\n\nSource: \"The Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Directory, Containing an Illustrated History and Description of the Road,\" Tomb of Jefferson (p.240)\n\nThe original draft that Jefferson prepared for the Declaration of Independence ended up being altered 86 times before final adoption by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776.2\n\nThomas Jefferson's original draft of the Declaration of Independence was edited by Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and others\n\nSource: Library of Congress, Thomas Jefferson, June 1776, Rough Draft of the Declaration of Independence\n\nLinks\n\nAnatomy of a Mystery: The Jefferson-Hemings controversy in the post-DNA era (University of Virginia Magazine, Fall 2007)\n\nBen Franklin's World podcast\n\nErica Dunbar: The Washingtons' Runaway Slave, Ona Judge\n\nGilder Lehrman Instiute of Anmerican History\n\nInside the Vault: The Election of 1800\n\nGoogle StreetView\n\nMonticello\n\nPoplar Forest\n\nUniversity of Virginia\n\nInternet Public Library Biography\n\nJefferson's Autobiography\n\nJefferson Biography from Outline of American History\n\nMonticello\n\nNational Portrait Gallery\n\nThomas Jefferson - A Film By Ken Burns\n\nThomas Jefferson, Son of Virginia\n\nJefferson's Draft of the Declaration of Independence\n\nThe Journal of Thomas Jefferson's Life and Times\n\nNotes on Slavery\n\nDraft for a Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom (1779)\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nThomas Jefferson Exhibit\n\nThomas Jefferson: Genius of Liberty exhibition\n\nThomas Jefferson Papers\n\nPloughshares at Emerson College\n\nNotes on the State of Virginia: Journey to the Center of an American Document\n\nPortrait of Thomas Jefferson\n\nJefferson's Blood (about Jefferson and Sally Hemmings)\n\nThomas Jefferson Digital Archive (University of Virginia)\n\nNotes on Virginia\n\nthe other side of the Sally Hemmings story: Thomas Jefferson Heritage Society and The Truth About The Thomas Jefferson DNA Study\n\nThe Jefferson-Hemings Scholars Commission: Report on the Jefferson-Hemings Matter\n\nJefferson-Hemings Scholars Commission\n\nAmerican Writers: Jefferson and Madison Declaration of Independence & the Constitution (C-SPAN video)\n\nSaving Monticello\n\nThomas Jefferson Library - Links\n\nWho Was Uriah Levy?\n\nThomas Jefferson: Radical and Racist (The Atlantic Monthly; October 1996; Thomas Jefferson: Radical and Racist; Volume 278, No. 4; pages 53-74)\n\nJefferson & The Capitol of Virginia (exhibit at The Library of Virginia)\n\nUniversity of Virginia - Papers of Thomas Jefferson\n\nThe White House Biography\n\nMartha Wayles Skelton Jefferson\n\nThomas Jefferson was a slaveowner as well as an advocate for personal liberty, creating a complex contradiction between his thoughts and behavior\n\nSource: Encyclopedia Virgnia, Thomas Jefferson Advertises for Runaway Slave\n\nReferences\n\n1. \"Jefferson's Gravestone,\" Monticello, https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/jeffersons-gravestone; \"1826 - 1837,\" The Monticello Association, http://www.monticello-assoc.org/1826-to-civil-war.html (last checked July 23, 2022)\n\n2. \"Creating the United Stats,\" Library of Congress Magazine, July/August 2022, https://loc.gov/lcm/pdf/LCM_2022_0708.pdf (last checked July 23, 2022)\n\nThomas Jefferson was in France when the General Assembly approved the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786\n\nSource: Smithsonian Institution Thomas Jefferson (by Mather Brown, 1786)\n\nPlaces Associated With Famous Virginians\n\nVirginia Places"
