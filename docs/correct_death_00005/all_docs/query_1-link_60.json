        "text": "Judging Thomas jefferson\n\nBy ChlÃ¶e Berlin\n\nWhen CBS News recently ranked Thomas Jefferson as the nationâs seventh best President, they lost sight of his contradictory administrative decisions. In reality, the so called âKing of Monticelloâ is hardly deserving of such a title.\n\nHereâs why.\n\nIn 1776, Jefferson boldly proclaimed that âall men are created equal.â This assertion would go on to define the nationâs ethical blueprint for generations to come. His definition, however, was hardly inclusive of all the demographics affected by his jurisdiction.\n\nJeffersonâs personal choices repudiated his broad claims of universal equality. Despite having referred to slavery as the âbanality of humankind,â he profited from the industry greatly.\n\nAs one of the largest slave owners in Virginia, Jefferson frequently engaged in human trafficking. He enslaved more than 700 people, physically disciplining those he deemed incompetent. The brutal treatment he enacted upon other human beings demonstrated his utter disregard for the rights of others.\n\nBut his hypocrisy pervaded more than just his personal affairs. The third Presidentâs leadership was riddled with inconsistencies when it came to slavery. As President, he did little to combat the industry of forced labor and dehumanization, despite citing it as a âcruel war against human nature itself, violating its most sacred rights of life & liberties.â\n\nMuch of this language is evocative of the Founding Fathersâ texts. Both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution explore rights as innate accessories to the human condition. Jefferson understood the power and legitimacy that this rhetoric held over his audience. Framing this language to serve against its intended meaning further demonstrates his apathy towards those who were not white, male and wealthy.\n\nWhile it was very much within his authoritative power to fight against this âcomplete contradiction to American values,âJefferson did nothing of the sort; he actually intensified it. As President, he believed that the continuation of Southern slavery was crucial to the advancement of Westward Expansion. By neglecting to spread slavery Westward, he maintained, was to âperpetrateâ an âact of suicide on themselves, and of treason against the hopes of the world.â\n\nFurthermore, it is dubious that Jefferson was even entitled to the land he sanctioned as an American entitlement. His insistence in moving westward resulted in the slaughter, pillage and displacement hundreds of indigenous tribes. This philosophy, which served as the origins for the Manifest Destiny, uprooted countless Indian families and served as the foundation for the nationâs legacy of exploiting native land.\n\nJeffersonâs views on governance and administration were similarly inconsistent. He strongly opposed federal authority. True to his ideology, he founded his own partyâthe Democratic-Republicans. This party prioritized local governance over nationwide supervision, serving as a near antithesis to Alexander Hamiltonâs Federalist party.\n\nAlexander Hamilton, John Adams and their cohorts appealed to conservatives and businesses which favored banks, a supervised nationwide economy, and laws applying to the country as a whole. Under Jeffersonâs leadership, the Democratic-Republicans rejected these regulations and the patriotic ideals of national legislation imposed by their opposition.\n\nAround centralized banking, the Democratic-Republican party tended to rely on the notion that the âgovernment that governs least governs best.â This was certainly Jeffersonâs sentiment when it came to banking. As Secretary of State under George Washington, Jefferson outwardly criticized the federal banking system and its intention to assume state debts.\n\nThis struggle carried through well into his presidency. In a letter to his wife, Martha, the President alleged the national charter to be âwreaked of abuse of power.â Jeffersonâs outspoken criticism of the Federalists, and of Hamilton himself, only heightened tensions between the two parties. This rivalry intensified the disparate views on either side of the opposition. That is, Jefferson grew to hate the national charter more than before.\n\nBut the President soon employed the very monetary infrastructure he eschewed to finance the expansion of the United States navy. During the time of his presidency, the nationâs fleets were plagued by piracy off of the coast of Tripoli. Jefferson claimed that funneling funds from the national charter was âessential to squashingâ this maraud. Undoubtedly, the expanded use of US naval power made passage off of Barbary coast safer for international trade, but negated the tenets of his credo.\n\nSimilarly, Jefferson depended upon the national bank to fund the 1800 Louisiana Purchase. The Louisiana Purchase allowed for American acquisition of â827,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi Riverâ. The Purchase cost the nation a mere $15 million, and was an incredible bargain, even by the eraâs standards.\n\nMany historians regard the land deal between the United States and France to be a revered tactical decision which bolstered American economy and allowed for future financial success. Whether or not this was a commendable exchange is unimportant. It was not an example of minimal governance.The President previously viewed the system with vehement opposition, only to depend upon it when necessary. This contradiction further delineates him as a weak-willed, deceitful leader.\n\nPresident Jeffersonâs achievements were by and far impressive. He supported the nation through strategic military tactics, a radical expansion of land, and advocacy for free public education. A truly great leader needs to be consistent, however, both in words and actions. Jefferson fell short.\n\ntime to reassess jefferson\n\nBy Olivier Khorasani\n\nCBS News recently dubbed Thomas Jefferson the seventh best president of the United States, but that conclusion is extremely problematic.\n\nThe âSage of Monticelloâ was, in fact, hypocritical and racist, and he bent the Constitution to his will.\n\nOn slavery in the United States, Jefferson once said, âif something is not done and soon done, we shall be the murderers of our own children.â Here, though he expressed a sense of urgency over the critical topic of slavery, he failed to specify a plan of action. In fact, during his presidency, he owned more than 600 slaves.\n\nSlavery also contradicted Jeffersonâs famous statement in the Declaration of Independence that âall men are created equal.â Yet in his 1785 Notes of Virginia, he wrote that â[blacks] are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.â\n\nJefferson benefitted directly from the institution he sought to abrogate. A wealthy white Virginian, he cared for his own comfort beyond that of the nationâs. In this respect, he leveraged his privileged position of power by engaging in an intimate relationship with his wifeâs half-sister, Sally Hemmings, a slave. Jefferson repeatedly sexually assaulted Ms. Hemmings, and she bore six of his children at Monticello.\n\nShe, along with her children, were the only slaves freed by Jefferson after his death. Instead of abiding by his decree of liberty, Jeffersonâs estate auctioned off the hundreds of other slaves he owned at the time of his death with no regard for separated or fractured families.\n\nPolitically, the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 was a substantial component of Jeffersonâs presidency. However, Jefferson struggled to get congressional support for the Louisiana Purchase and contradicted the Constitution to enable it.\n\nJefferson also contradicted his own word when he declared neutrality in the Haitian Revolution in 1799, and in doing so increased tensions with the French. After he received word that France wanted to retake its empire in the Western Hemisphere, he refused to help them. In refusing aid, Jefferson indirectly allowed for arms to be transported to Haiti and thus helped the Haitians in their pursuit of freedom.\n\nThe French loss in Haiti ultimately forced that nation out of the Western Hemisphere, and led to the French surrender of the Louisiana Territory to the United States for a mere $15 million (the equivalent of about $335 million today). Although considered by many to be one of Jeffersonâs chief achievements as President, the purchase was nothing more than a way for Jefferson, who believed in small government, to expand his political power.\n\nHereâs why.\n\nPurchasing the Louisiana Territory was a bargain by any standard, but Jefferson went against the very things he firmly believed in while doing so: the Constitution, state vs. federal power, and small, limited government.\n\nJefferson was staunchly opposed to the idea of Federal Bank when Alexander Hamilton first proposed it, but he used it to fund the Louisiana purchase. Though he aggressively fought to eradicate Hamiltonâs idea, he nevertheless abused the power of the presidency to achieve his own ends.\n\nPresident Jefferson displaced an astonishing number of Native Americans due to his aspirations for westward expansion, and he had trouble integrating the indigenous population into the United States. A displaced Native American man was disgusted with the way his peers were being treated and lamented that the people of the U.S. thought it fit âto dispossess us and to destroy our dwellings.â\n\nRegardless of what he thought about the horrors of slavery, Jefferson sat idly by and did nothing to support the new citizens, and the local legislatures in newly incorporated Louisiana forbade blacks to âever consider themselves the equal of whites.â Slaves living in the Louisiana territory had enjoyed more freedom under both French and Spanish rule than under Jeffersonâs ostensibly pro-liberty United States of America.\n\nWhite men, women, and children all kept the rights they obtained when they were under French and Spanish rule (such as women being co-owners of family property), but the rights of free blacks slowly decreased under American control.\n\nAfter the Louisiana Purchase, American relations with the French and British continued to deteriorate. These two powers were desperate and concerned for their own safety in the Napoleonic Wars, and therefore saw fit to capture American soldiers.\n\nJefferson imposed the Embargo Act of 1807 to prevent American ships from being abducted by the British and French navies. Despite Jeffersonâs intensions of retaliation against Britain and France, the Embargo Act had devastating, and lasting, impacts on the Northern and coastal economies of the United States.\n\nMore importantly, however, the Embargo Act of 1807 was another astounding exercise of federal power, originally condemned by Jefferson, that he displayed in his presidency.\n\nAs a member of the United Statesâ founding generation and as the author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson advocated for liberty and peace. His presidency, however, was full of contradictions. He spoke against slavery but owned hundreds of slaves. He argued for small government but doubled the nationâs size by abusing his presidential authority. Despite his contributions to the founding of the United States, his presidency does not deserve to be counted in the top ten in history.\n\nJeffersonâs Complicated presidency and Legacy\n\nBy Miles Munkacy\n\nThomas Jefferson, the noted third president from Virginia, is lauded as a figure of paramount importance in American history. An expansive memorial stands in his honor in our nationâs capital, and he was chosen as one of the four presidents represented on our nation's preeminent presidential monument. A recent CBS News ranking even listed him as the seventh best president.\n\nYet, Jefferson does not deserve this ranking. At best, he is a hypocrite. At worst, he lacked an effective moral conscience.\n\nVenerating presidents like Jefferson is a highly questionable pursuit. We need to delve deep into Jeffersonâs actions and look beyond the few accomplishments he may have had in order to see his true character.\n\nEven those few accomplishments may be of dubious benefit. Jeffersonâs most famous achievement came in the second year of his presidency. He negotiated with France to acquire the Louisiana Purchase, more than 800,000 square miles of land west of the Mississippi River, for $15,000,000, almost universally considered to be a bargain.\n\nThere were two problems with this deal. The first was its legality. Jefferson was known for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, only exercising his power if explicitly allowed. However, the Constitution did not address purchasing land from foreign powers. After the treaty with France was ratified, Jefferson became worried that his actions were not lawful. To alleviate his fears about legality, he retroactively proposed a Constitutional amendment that would allow presidents to purchase land for the country. However, Jefferson realized he had little support in Congress, and capitulated.\n\nDespite having sacrificed his principles, Jefferson was elated with the purchase, calling it a âgreat achievementâ. Years later, he wrote, âIt is incumbent on those who accept great charges to risk themselves on great occasionsâ, essentially arguing that it is alright to ignore oneâs most basic principles in face of a potentially great achievement. That is a dangerous precedent for presidents to set, as it can be used to justify extreme, and possibly illegal, actions.\n\nThe second issue with the Louisiana Purchase was its effect on the issue of slavery. The acquisition of a large area of fertile land quickly ignited a debate on the extent of slavery in the United States. Would slavery be allowed in the new land? Would it be allowed in part of the territory? Jefferson unfortunately didnât have answers to these questions. The ensuing decades would see this controversial debate grow, deepening the divide between northern and southern states, something that would eventually lead to the Civil War.\n\nJeffersonâs own personal relationship with the terrible act of slavery has affected his presidential legacy far more than any treaty or constitutional crisis. Supporters of Jefferson might stop here and posit that his âall men are created equalâ proclamation set the United States on the course for equal rights for all Americans. However, Jeffersonâs habit of hypocrisy appears in full force here.\n\nIn his lifetime, Jefferson owned hundreds of slaves and was an active member of the slave trade, buying or selling more than a hundred individuals. These slaves were treated inhumanely at his plantation, Monticello. They were forced to work long hours doing menial labor, which at Monticello meant farming, house work, or working in a nail factory.\n\nJeffersonâs slaves were also punished in ways typical for the era. He delegated most management of slaves to other people, including Gabriel Lilly and William Page, who were both known to be too eager to use their whips. Lilly once whipped a slave three times in one day, until the slave was not able to hold his head. Any man connected to an atrocities like that can never claim to be moral, no matter what he wrote decades before.\n\nAside from owning slaves, Jeffersonâs attitude toward and actions with black people clearly made him a man of questionable morals. He argued that black people were âinferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.â He also had a long time physical relationship with one of his slaves, Sally Hemings, with whom most people agree he fathered multiple children. The nature of their relationship is largely unknown, however it is unlikely their relationship was consensual due to the power imbalance between the two.\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase and his relationship with black people encapsulates Jeffersonâs shortcomings as president. The former gives an example of him abandoning any semblance of ethics in order to cultivate his legacy. The Louisiana Purchase also stoked tensions that would lead to the deadliest conflict in American history. The latter shows his clear racism and highly questionable morals.\n\nIn this light, a ranking of seventh seems spurious and unsubstantiated. A president whose major accomplishment had a mixed result, who also owned slaves, should not be held in high regard. As a country, we need to be more discerning with who we hold to be heroes.\n\nThis awareness starts in school, with lessons that force students to question common and fundamental misconceptions about powerful figures. For those already out of school, a refocused effort to separate myths from reality is needed. Neither of these occurring will lead to undesirable people taking power, a danger to our country.\n\nJefferson's Incompetence\n\nBy Charles Beagle\n\nWhile most presidentsâ legacies are romanticized in line with their actions, Thomas Jefferson stands out as a grotesque outlier. Regularly receiving praise for his role in both the nationâs founding and his presidency---being ranked as the 7th best president in a recent survey---few are quick to mention the rampant hypocrisy and incompetence that dogged his era.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that Jefferson, public sovereign that he was, lived a callous and deeply hypocritical lifestyle; ruthless to those under him and unafraid of sacrificing his character if it meant getting his way.\n\nJefferson was a true connoisseur of the slave trade, owning over 600 slaves over the course of his life, roughly 200 of which he gained through outside means. Jefferson saw these people in statistics, measuring their worth in possible net gain and acting accordingly if any of them did anything to affect that.\n\nYoung women suffered the most under this mindset. As any children reared by them were automatically his property, Jefferson âencouragedâ breeding, even stating that \"I consider a woman who brings a child every two years as more profitable than the best man of the farm.â\n\nIt wouldnât be long before he participated in this behavior himself. Sally Hemings was at most sixteen when Jefferson fathered her child on a trip to France in 1787, a practice he would both repeat six times with her alone\n\nOf course, while he was a tyrant to the few hundred he ruled over, he was a retrospective joke on the world stage. While at the center of several defining moments in U.S. History, youâd seldom find any that werenât drenched in hypocrisy and poor foresight on his part.\n\nEvents such as the Louisiana Purchase, while monumental for the nation, perfectly exemplify Jeffersonâs loss of character. Arguably one of the most important deals in American history, the purchase, overseen by Jefferson, nearly doubled the landmass of the U.S. for a paltry $15,000,000---roughly four cents an acre.\n\nThe deal would go on without a hitch, though not without further complicating matters for Jefferson on a moral level. The purchase stressed his ideals to their limits, and he gave under the pressure on almost all counts.\n\nThe payment alone was a blow against his character. In desperate need of capital in fear of the deal falling through, Jefferson acquired the money from the National Bankâthe symbol of his rival, Alexander Hamilton, and the exact opposite of what he had had in mind for the country.\n\nBack in 1790, the two secretaries had fought gruesomely over the structure of Americaâs economic system---Jefferson wanting to keep the current system of state banks while Hamilton wished to employ his idea for a national one. Jefferson feared that this move would give too much power to the government, allowing the Legislative and Executive branches to sidestep the restrictions put in place by the Constitution.\n\nAround the same time, Congress was in a deadlock over where the capital---and the influence that came with it---should be located. Biting the bullet, he along his longtime partner James Madison, struck a deal with Hamilton that would satisfy both parties. In exchange for backing their campaign to move the capital south, the two of them would give Hamilton the votes he needed to establish his bank. It was underhanded for everyone involved, but it was the first time Jefferson had really put his wants over his ideals, a trend that would repeat itself several times over his courier.\n\nThis all circles back to the purchase. In using the national bank to fund it Jefferson conceded the fight---as well as his character---to the system Hamilton had created. A loss that only highlighted the moral decay already present a few years back.\n\nIn the lull between the revolution and his time in office, Jefferson made his misgivings with the navy abundantly clear. He saw the ever-increasing budget spent on it as detrimental and even dangerous towards the nation, citing the messages of war and trade it broadcasted to the rest of the world and, more importantly, America itself. Jeffersonâs vision of America was that of an agrarian, self-sustaining nation that only traded for luxury, and saw the navy as a beacon of ambition that would eventually lead it to its doom.\n\nAs he ascended, however, he started to change his tune. His once furious attacks on the navyâs supporters began to die down, and---while trying to be subtle about it to save face---he actually began to endorse it on certain occasions. In his first annual address to congress after taking office, he advised them to begin the construction of ships and equipment in times of peace, in an attempt to bolster the navy.\n\nWhile the reason for this came in the form of the very real threat of the Barbary States demanding tribute, it once again shows the man trading his ideals for pragmatism. And while these traits would be admirable in a present-day authority figure, for a fledgling nation in desperate need of a moral center, itâs a risk they cannot afford to take.\n\nJefferson strengths as a leader and as a person cannot be denied, but neither can his weaknesses. For all he was brilliant and charismatic, he was a deeply prejudice and flexible man in an era where that didnât amount to much other that suffering.\n\nWhen it Comes to Jefferson, CBS News Has it Wrong\n\nBy Camille Cherney\n\nThomas Jefferson is revered in history class as a defender of liberty, but in reality he was a brutal hypocrite who only fought for freedom when it served himself.\n\nCBS News recently ranked Jefferson Americaâs 7th best president, but this couldnât be further from the truth.\n\nI the Declaration of Independence, which he authored, Jefferson wrote that âall men are created equal,â yet his actions did not reflect this fundamental American value.\n\nAs the âKing of Monticello,â Jefferson owned over 600 slaves, and he wasnât afraid to use brutal physical violence to enforce order on his estate.\n\nJefferson argued that some slaves ârequire a vigour of discipline to make them do reasonable work.â This blunt statement exposes Jeffersonâs apathetic attitude toward human bondage and his failure to afford basic human rights to all people.\n\nJefferson publicly presented himself as an abolitionist, insisting, âthere is nothing I would not sacrifice to a practicable plan of abolishing every vestige of this moral and political depravity.â\n\nIn his lifetime, however, Jefferson only freed seven slaves. Two of them were his sons Madison and Eston Hemings, whom he fathered with his slave Sally Hemings. It is unclear whether the relationship was consensual or not, given the fact that slaves had no right to refuse sexual advances from their slaveowner.\n\nWhen he obtained office, Jefferson also made no effort to abolish slavery or promote emancipation. He continued to enjoy the economic benefits of slave labor, choosing to appear ignorant to Americaâs greatest evil.\n\nIronically, without the inclusion of slaves in state populations, Jefferson would never have been elected president. The 3/5 compromise, which counted 3/5 of a stateâs slave population in determining electors, allowed Jefferson to obtain the electoral votes he needed to win the presidency.\n\nBesides his attitudes toward slavery, Jeffersonâs bold actions as president further exemplify his extreme hypocrisy.\n\nAs a Democratic-Republican candidate, Jefferson scorned federal power, but as president, he repeatedly abused his executive power.\n\nIn 1803, Jefferson bought the Louisiana territory from France for $15 million. Although the purchase doubled the size of the United States, it was an extreme abuse of federal power. The Constitution did not give permission for a president to acquire land from a foreign power.\n\nJefferson even admitted in an 1803 letter to senator John Breckinridge that âthe constitution has made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for incorporating foreign nations into our Union.â\n\nDespite knowledge of his wrongdoing, the third president followed through with the Louisiana Purchase.\n\nThe deal would eventually be called the ultimate bargain, but the ends do not justify the means. Although the purchase led to large economic gains, nothing excuses Jeffersonâs disregard for the Constitution.\n\nEven the Federalist Party, which supported a strong federal government, thought Jefferson had overstepped. One federalist declared, âWe are to give money, of which we have so little, for land, of which we already have too much.â\n\nJefferson also got America involved in its first war since the Revolution. Between 1785 and 1796, pirates from the Barbary states of Africa captured several American ships, preventing trade with the Mediterranean.\n\nInitially, the American government paid a ransom and annual fees to keep the peace. In 1801, however, Jefferson refused to pay and Tripoli declared war on the United States.\n\nAfter viciously criticizing John Adamsâ expansion of the navy, Jefferson still chose to employ its power in full force during the Barbary Wars.\n\nJeffersonâs entanglement in international affairs would have disappointed George Washington, who implored future presidents to maintain neutrality.\n\nIn 1803, a war between Britain and France led to the impressment of American sailors. In response to this relatively minor interference with the American economy, Jefferson instituted the Embargo Act of 1807, which prohibited almost all foreign trade.\n\nThe Constitution gave the government the right to âregulate,â trade but not to prohibit it completely. By enforcing the policy, Jefferson employed the Federalist doctrine of implied powers, which he had previously condemned.\n\nThe embargo was a staggering act of executive power that ruined the economies of port cities and decreased exports by over eighty percent.\n\nFor a new economy like the United States, trade was vital to healthy economic growth. Jeffersonâs embargo stunted economic progress and prevented traders from earning a living. Moreover, the Act made no impact on Britain or France, who were too preoccupied to notice.\n\nThe Louisiana Purchase, the Barbary Wars, and the Embargo Act all illustrate Jeffersonâs propensity to act against his convictions. Jefferson was elected in order to reduce federal power, yet as president he repeatedly made decisions beyond the powers specified in the Constitution.\n\nMost abhorrent were Jeffersonâs morals when it came to slavery, or lack thereof. He spoke of emancipation, but never took concrete action.\n\nAs president, Jefferson had the power to end the wicked institution of slavery, but he knew that the economic and political power he enjoyed was a direct product of the slave trade.\n\nIn Jeffersonâs world, not all men were created equal. Looking back, Americans can see that not all presidents were created equal. Jefferson was certainly not one of our best.\n\nA fool of history\n\nBy Libby Foley\n\nWe all know Thomas Jefferson. As a giant of American history, his many titles certainly add validity to his name. Nicknamed as âThe Pen of the Revolution,â Jefferson surely signed his name onto Americaâs roots.\n\nCBS News recently ranked each of our nationâs presidents, with Jefferson coming in at 7th place, grouped with many notable figures.\n\nDespite the news organizationâs acclaim, I feel it necessary to question their decision-making. How can anyone of repute rank Jefferson as one of the nationsâ best presidentsâespecially when his actions directly contradict everything that todayâs Americans represent and stand for? He was a trickster who manipulated the nation solely for his betterment. With respect to differing views, the time has come to put Jefferson in the doghouse, right where he belongs.\n\nJefferson was the owner of a wealthy plantation filled to the brim with slaves. In fact, in his lifetime, he owned upward of six hundred slaves. He benefited economically from each one of these slaves, therefore expanding his prominent grasp on society.\n\nAs chief author of the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson enshrined into Americaâs consciousness, âWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.â\n\nBy owning slaves, Jefferson directly contradicted these words, which were his own. Clearly, all men were not created equal. He did make attempts to abolish slavery, but never ended up freeing any of his own slaves. This not only proves how reliant on slavery he was, but also speaks to his stubborn personality.\n\nHe allowed for the mistreatment of hundreds of human beingsâat his own hands. Clearly, he didnât have any kind regard for the people of his nation. It seems inequitable to rank a president as the seventh best in history when Jefferson clearly did not understand basic ethical principles.\n\nYet another burden on Jeffersonâs name was his attitude towards other political figures. One such treatment was that of Alexander Hamilton, Secretary of the Treasury. Political discord is natural, and I donât mean to imply that each and every system of government should run seamlessly. However, many of Jeffersonâs actions crossed the line. When referring to Hamiltonâs methods and idea for a National Bank, Jefferson remarked that they âflowed from principles adverse to liberty, and was calculated to undermine and demolish the republic.â The nerve that Jefferson had to make such a comment is astounding. It seems foolish to worship somebody who was capable of such harsh words.\n\nJefferson and Hamilton endured fierce stages of debate throughout the process of establishing the National Bank. Jefferson was in strong opposition. He believed that the Constitution did not grant Congress the authority to create a bank. Additionally, Jefferson believed that the bank would only be a resource for the privileged, and that it would also prevent state banks from growing.\n\nHamilton was solely attempting to better the nation. Jeffersonâs imputations against Hamilton seen childish. He was immune to good ideas, and this was one of them. The fear he held of power being stripped from his bare hands blatantly overruled his ability to make good decisions.\n\nOne of the elements that defines a great president is their management of the government. Jeffersonâs wavering and unstable system undoubtedly contradicts this belief. Originally, he aspired to create a limited federal government. In fact, the credo of his party was âThe government that governs best, governs least.â Jefferson believed in local self-government,\n\nand thought that the government should step lightly in affairs that were not their own. During his presidency, he took many steps to limit federal power. One of these steps was reducing the amount of government employees and abolishing the army and navy.\n\nHowever, his changes would not last for long. Jefferson changed his mind, going against all of his original principles and beliefs. The danger of Jeffersonâs modifications is something that cannot be ignored. A president who rapidly changed his ideas surely did not have any of his âducks in a row.â To put faith, understanding, and trust in a man who contradicted his own speech is just absurd.\n\nIn 1803, Jefferson purchased the Louisiana Territory for $15 million from the French. In doing so, he expanded his power as a political figure, broadening his grasp on the country. While many view the Louisiana Purchase as a positive thing, I have much cause to believe it was quite the opposite. The Louisiana Purchase was solely a manipulative move. Jefferson knew what he was doing, and jumped on the opportunity to expand his control of the nation.\n\nBy purchasing the Louisiana Territory, Jefferson became the exact thing that he feared: a symbol of a âlarge government.â Both Jeffersonâs thoughts and actions were unbound. In fact, Jefferson used Alexander Hamiltonâs National Bank to fund the purchase, an idea to which he was originally against. He was using a system that he had originally declared âunconstitutional.â In this case, however, it was Jefferson who was invalid. He went against his word, which made him a weak man and president. It seems foolish to place so much trust into a man capable of such inconstancy.\n\nThomas Jefferson wasnât everything that we've chalked him up to be. It is essential that CBS reevaluates their thinking. Before determining the greatest figures in our history, we need to take a step back to look at their values and ethics before handing out gold medals."
