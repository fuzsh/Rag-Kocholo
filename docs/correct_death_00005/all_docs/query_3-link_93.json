        "text": "1. Introduction\n\n7This article aims to show that Jefferson viewed politics as a matter of putting into effect his convictions not only about the fundamental rights of religious freedom and free speech as well as about social issues, but also about the principles of scientific thought, and, to an extent, even about one’s search for individual happiness.\n\n8In sum, politics can be viewed as the centerpiece of Jefferson’s entire worldview according to which all purposes needed to be brought into compliance, to the effect that one ended up with politics of democratic institutions, of science, and of all socioeconomic issues, including slavery. The never-ending process of creating policies for bettering American society gave politics its own character as a moral concept.\n\n9Let us in the following first consider the term politics itself in its extrahistorical meanings and only then consider how such concepts as direct and representative democracy figured in Jefferson’s thought. Then will follow accounts of Jeffersonian politics for socioeconomic purposes, for scientific thought, for the slavery question, and finally for the issues of religious freedom and individual moral faith.\n\n2. The Concept of Politics\n\n10As Jefferson’s astonishing political career well proves, his several lamentations on the pains and dullness of politics, should be kept in context. If there ever was a human activity that he held necessary for human beings in general that was politics. And politics for him always remained the art of the possible. This explains his patience on even such key issues as promoting the emancipation of enslaved people, general male suffrage, elementary education, and the like.\n\n11One may ask in what sense the American Founding in fact changed the concept of politics as an extrahistorical game of power on all levels of human life. The game of everyday politics was not brought to an end. Rather, it only became inscribed within the doctrine of equal natural rights of all human beings. What followed was the gradual extension of suffrage and the establishment of the idea that in political democracy the minority’s right to disagree with the majority’s opinion would remain in place even after elections.\n\n12In sum, Jefferson’s most sacred value, the freedom of opinion, became fully established as the basis for a genuinely free government, even if it offered no guarantee against cunning, betrayal, and general deviousness in politics as a natural human practice. The first national political parties were born out of profound disagreements on how to interpret the purpose of the American Constitution.\n\n16Let us briefly consider politics as it may appear in its extrahistorical meanings. What is mistaken in the old proverb of war being the continuation of politics by other means? It is mistaken because politics is but a means itself, innately peaceful, even if sometimes a mischievous game of negotiating with one’s opponents, as noted above. Transforming a means of often hostile, but essentially non-violent, intercourse into the means of war is by definition a failure of politics. Even wars tend not to end until the parties have returned to the negotiation table to settle the peace.\n\n17The goals of politics have changed throughout human history. Genuinely historical understanding helps us to grasp that problems calling for a political solution have always evolved in certain historical circumstances and have thus been genuinely distinct in nature. Under the society of orders, all human rights were mere privileges, and politics on the governmental level was reserved for only men representing the court, the aristocracy, the gentry, or the clergy.\n\n18This is not to say that common people did not do politics in the larger meaning of the term. To an extent, all tenants, throughout the Middle Ages and the early modern era, just like enslaved people in “the new world” later on, constantly resorted to different forms of protest and opposition to inappropriate treatment by their traditional social “superiors” or enslavers.\n\n20By the same token our problems of climate change, worldwide pandemics, the constant threat of nuclear war, or the unequal treatment of gay and lesbian people were not in view for Jefferson at the turn of the nineteenth century. This is why his belief in general human progress could remain so unequivocally optimistic.\n\n21Jefferson could well believe that Americans would become wealthier under an orderly government thanks to the technological innovations and extending economy. Similarly, he could believe in their becoming wiser thanks to progressive empirical science and even morally more sensitive about such issues as the enormity of slavery. To a large extent, Americans managed to achieve all this during the last two centuries after his death in 1826. That later generations’ achievements have gone well beyond even the hopes and visions of the founding era generation is equally obvious.\n\n22In its deepest sense, however, politics can be viewed as sheer power play embracing all forms of human behavior—beginning with parents negotiating their power relations with their children and with each other on a daily basis. Similarly, our manifold social norms, etiquettes, practices, uses of language, and institutions involve power claims. While every American child is legally compelled to go to school, adults have genuine political disagreements on what to teach them about even such basic issues as gender, race, abortion, religion, and the like.\n\n24The American constitutional form of free government was established to provide the arena for this ongoing negotiation, while keeping faith in the individual’s capacity to negotiate one’s power relations with others in what is called the private sphere. Public concerns are concerns of national, state, and local politics. Notably, even the proper limits between the public and the private spheres are doomed to remain among the topics of politics, as with the recent developments in legalizing same-sex marriages and the use of marijuana.\n\n25Finally, each and every issue of human life needs to be conceptualized as a political problem before it can become so, as is well proved by the recent major reforms regarding the rights of sexual minorities. For centuries, many people thought that sexual issues should have nothing to do with public policies. In sum, not everything is politics, but anything can be politicized.\n\n26What politics in its manifold forms calls for is the vision of a future better than the present and grasping the nature of the game itself as a never-ending negotiation process. So it was with Jefferson. He remained true to his long-term goals, but moderate in his means, as one is often compelled to be in majoritarian democracy. Jefferson consistently refused to become a lonely crusader, sacrificing his political capital and risking removal from offices of genuine importance. As with all other long-term goals, this held true of his cautious advocacy of the emancipation of slaves.\n\n3. Politics of the Government\n\n32This is why Jefferson never advocated an extensive federal debt and the ensuing taxes to cover its interest payments. Those payments would, in his view, only end up in the pockets of Alexander Hamilton’s circle of a new money aristocracy. This new aristocracy appeared to aim only at enriching themselves as government creditors (alongside speculating with federal lands), and would hence corrupt the government from its very beginnings.\n\n33The doctrine of minimal federal government led Jefferson to take stands that become understandable only within the context of constitutional arrangements prior to the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of revolutionary significance regarding American federalism. In the 1791 bill of rights the famous freedoms of opinion, of speech, of religion, and the like were guaranteed only against the federal government.\n\n35By contrast, state governments’ role in Jeffersonian federalism was not anything close to minimal government ideals. To state governments belonged all questions of citizenship, voting rights, education, and the like. Jefferson also wished to assign all governmental functions to as low a level of society as possible. This is why he constantly advocated subdividing the counties into municipal, township-level political decision-making units. To local townships would belong all such issues as organizing a police force, constructing and maintaining local roads and river routes, organizing common poor relief, and building and maintaining an elementary school in every township.\n\n36Nothing in this socioeconomic vision called for less politics rather than more. Jefferson was a man of the Enlightenment, always aiming at a better common control of all socioeconomic trends. This would be achieved by popular sovereignty alone, and most effectively by relying as much as possible on local politics.\n\n39Given that politics itself was about maintaining peaceful social development, nothing in Jefferson’s vision entailed any particularly anti-government attitude. The federal government, the state governments, the counties, and the “ward-republics” or townships (sometimes also called hundreds) would all contribute to the common decision making for the common good, Jefferson believed, based on democratic rules.\n\n41What Jefferson urged his political allies to do was simply never cease discussing the desired reforms and to push them forward gradually. Jefferson, for example, urged Madison’s former secretary Edward Coles not to move from Virginia in order to free his slaves, but instead to stay in Virginia. Coles was needed to support any initiative for a gradual abolition law in the Virginia legislature.\n\n43It is not as simple as one might expect to define even the proper meaning of representative government as related to the idea of popular sovereignty. As is well known, the American revolutionaries had debated with the British about the meanings of virtual and actual representation of the colonists in the British Parliament. Yet, even the ancient Greek city-state democracies could be viewed as representative in the sense that every Athenian master of his own household (oikos), whenever voting on any topic in the general public council of all free men, also represented the other members of his household, namely his wife, children, and servants. Notably, Aristotle never deemed merchants worthy of free men’s political rights in Athens.\n\n45Following Hannah Arendt, one may argue that the true threat to genuine democratic discourse is not disagreement in general or a a heated debate in particular, but silence, given that politics as a term refers to conflict solving by the peaceful means of negotiation. The only thing forbidden is violence.\n\n46This is how Jefferson took the trouble to explain the problem with so-called “pure democracy” to Samuel Kercheval, who was preparing plans for large-scale political reforms in Virginia in 1816:\n\n30 TJ to Samuel Kercheval, Sept. 5, 1816, at Founders Online, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/ (...)\n\nWere our state a pure democracy, in which all inhabitants should meet together to transact all their business, there would yet be excluded from their deliberations, 1, infants until arrived at years of discretion. 2. Women, who to prevent depravation of morals and ambiguity of issue could not mix promiscuously in the public meetings of men. 3, Slaves, from whom the unfortunate state of things with us takes away the right of will and property. . . . So, slaves with us have no powers as citizens; yet in representation in the General Government, they count in the proportion of three to five; so also in taxation. Whether this is equal, is not here the question.\n\n47It was clear that in any democratic ordering of society imaginable by Jefferson those with political rights had the duty to represent also the interests of all those excluded from them. This is why, in Jefferson’s view, statesmen and regular voters continued owing not only justice but also benevolence to children, women, slaves, and a huge number of free, adult male Americans still excluded from political power.\n\n52Considering this statement in its possible repercussions, however, Jefferson did not claim that the American people might not one day consider the question of women’s political rights anew. He was only speaking of possible preparedness for such a reform. Given that women’s rights had been a subject of political considerations at least since the publication of Mary Wollstonecraft’s book on women’s rights in the early 1790s, future generations, he thought, might think differently on the matter.\n\n4. Politics for Socioeconomic Changes\n\n56This is the fundamental basis for Jefferson’s long-held vision of America, which, at least in short-term policy, would best serve itself, he believed, by becoming an agricultural nation with independent and educated citizen farmers rather than a country resembling the European monarchies with all the social problems of their commercial metropolises teeming with beggars and prostitutes, and stained by general licentiousness (as Jefferson claimed).\n\n62What Jefferson thought of all this was simply that as long as the natural right of freedom of conscience and the right to leave one’s country (both partly dissenting from John Locke’s teachings) were in effect, one’s moral compromises were compromises necessary for human progress. Without democracy no permanent social reforms appeared possible at all.\n\n63Jefferson went far in his compromises in remaining a law-abiding American, whose ideas of religious freedom and free elementary education for both boys and girls remained quite exotic in the United States of his time. As for his advocacy of democratic rights, in Virginia the political establishment refused to extend the right to vote to all white men as Jefferson had supported from the Revolution until his very death in 1826. Although an estimated half of all white males remained excluded from the ballot, it was left to Madison in the 1830 Virginia constitutional convention to argue for universal white male suffrage—still in vain.\n\n64Genuine benevolence, as Jefferson saw it, demanded more than mere obedience to contemporary social ordering. This was why it was every citizen’s moral responsibility to think anew the natural-law basis of the contemporary legal order regarding such issues as slavery, women’s civil (if not political) rights, the right of conscience, the right to vote, and possibly even the right to education. On all these issues Jefferson was ready to compromise in the name of keeping American democracy open to further development.\n\n65As for Jefferson’s readiness for compromises between his personal convictions and the political realities of the time, he remained an obedient citizen under the rule of the Virginia government all his life—a government that refused both to extend the electorate toward general male suffrage and to consider his plan for Virginia slave emancipation. He never questioned his personal loyalty to the government with which he disagreed on such elemental issues as these.\n\n5. Politics of Scientific Thought\n\n66A vast majority of contemporary and subsequent scholarly arguments on Jefferson contradicting himself can be dismissed once his commitment to scientific research instead of mere speculation is genuinely grasped. This is particularly conspicuous regarding his views of natural history and racial issues. Jefferson’s incorrect assumption that the mammoth still lived on earth was based on his belief in the eighteenth-century grand concept of the great chain of being.\n\n68Jefferson’s fundamental assumption about the stability of nature did not rest on the belief that nature does not change. It rested on the belief that its changes must be so regulated that it would not fall apart as a whole, as it obviously did not. This is how he expressed his musing to John Adams not only about nature, but also about the ordering of the entire universe:\n\n51 TJ to John Adams, April 11, 1823, TJW, 1467.\n\nStars, well known, have disappeared, new ones come into view, comets, in their incalculable courses, may run foul of suns and planets and require renovation under other laws; certain races of animals are become extinct; and, were there no restoring power, all existences might extinguish successively, one by one, until all should be reduced to a shapeless chaos.\n\n70This did not yet solve any issues of scientific approach to the world. The basic assumption of modern science, as Jefferson correctly viewed it, consisted in doing research about the unknown. This entailed only that one must acknowledge the boundaries of the yet unknown. Contrary to philosophical system-building, only turning the unknown into scientific hypotheses that could be tested would provide humankind the kind of knowledge Jefferson was interested in, namely, certain knowledge.\n\n72Indeed, Jefferson’s opinions on the natural order of things, including the topic of race, abounds with conjectures. The reason is that all research hypotheses must be empirically tested. Instead of aiming to convince people of his own assumptions and prejudices, Jefferson’s (in)famous book, Notes on the State of Virginia (1787), as well as his domestic and international correspondence over the years are full of what he himself treated as speculations, not knowledge.\n\n73Jefferson grasped that his suspicions about Africans having developed as as a distinct species until coming into contact with Europeans represented mere speculation about the very meaning of the terms of race and species. These terms were used synonymously among the scientists and intellectuals of the eighteenth century.\n\n81In sum, alongside everyday politics there was also the politics of natural science. With that, as with politics in general, the “principles” were “the stake.” Without free inquiry that enabled empirical testing of each and every imaginable hypothesis no new knowledge would be possible, and that was exactly what the Jeffersonian “progress” in material welfare, in knowledge, and in morality called for.\n\n84This commitment to bettering oneself was derived from ancient virtue ethics, and also called for the modern notion of free government in which everyone was left responsible for the development of both one’s intellectual and moral capacities. The doctrine of the inalienable rights of man was about this same existentialist goal: one was morally forbidden to “alienate” one’s rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of (personal) happiness from oneself as an autonomous moral actor.\n\n85Nothing in Jefferson’s original draft of the Declaration of Independence directly implies that the equality of “all men” did not pertain to women’s rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Everyone knew that equal political rights were far from guaranteed even to all free, white men at the time, not to mention the unresolved issue of slavery.\n\n6. Politics for Ending Slavery\n\n91The failure to free his own slaves did not constitute a personal moral compromise for Jefferson. He never believed that the emancipation would succeed with only individual slaveholders giving up their slaves. The reform needed to be political to be effective at all. Without legal obligations there would always be slaveholders keen on holding on to their labor force, he thought.\n\n96Jefferson remained adamant that the federal government could not be given any say on the matter of the states’ rights to define citizenship. Doing so would have changed the entire current political structure of the federation. As noted earlier, in Jefferson’s mind, the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom was not supposed to become federal policy either. Jefferson eventually compromised on his earlier view that new states joining the federation should avoid adopting slavery. His reasons for doing so demand an explanation.\n\n97What is often overlooked in Jefferson’s (just as in James Madison’s) position on abolition is that he never had a federal plan for putting it into effect. Initially, he thought that new states should not adopt slavery, as his 1784 plan for the eventual Northwest Ordinance (1787) made clear by banning slavery in those territories. Both Jefferson and Madison thought that the strategy of gradual abolition of slavery, as put forward legally in the Northern states, would also work in the South, even if with the additional provision of forced deportation. It did not.\n\n98The situation with which Jefferson and Madison were confronted in 1820 was the reality that gradual emancipation programs in the Northern states had proved effective over the decades following the Revolution, whereas no positive developments had taken place in the South. Instead, the number of both enslaved and free black Americans had grown with astonishing speed from 1776 to 1820, even though the greatest boom of cotton slavery lay still ahead. It also lay beyond any of Jefferson’s expectations.\n\n101The same logic pertained to any personal effort of Jefferson’s to rid himself of the status of a slaveholder: his creditors would not have consented to his freeing his slaves, but would have insisted on selling them to slavery elsewhere. Jefferson lived well beyond his means throughout his life and never made a serious attempt to radically lower his own standard of living as a member of the slaveholding Virginia elite. This remained his sin.\n\n7. Politics of Religion and Morality\n\n103To truly grasp the meaning of religious freedom for Jefferson, one should first note that his religious politics never aimed to promote his personal convictions about the afterlife or its absence. Nor did he advocate some particular interpretation of Scripture as sacred and holy for all Americans. Jefferson was conspicuously radical in promoting the rights of atheists. He believed not only in the freedom of religion, but also in the freedom of conscience.\n\n105Deep down, Jefferson was interested in natural religion, by which he meant a belief in an extra-human rationality presiding over the universe and in the Stoic-inspired notion of the laws of nature covered both physical and moral aspects of the world. Moreover, such natural lawyers as Hugo Grotius, Samuel Pufendorf, and Emer de Vattel, had already distinguished divine reason from the human knowledge of it and instead focused on rational deductions from the hypothetical state of nature as a reliable way of reasoning out what decent human life called for in terms of our natural sociality.\n\n106These thinkers, hence, had partially distinguished the field of moral philosophy, insofar as it concerned our genuine respect for other human beings, from any considerations of how the human soul would be guaranteed happiness in the afterlife. This is the basis for Jefferson’s numerous statements belittling any doctrinaire religious thinking.\n\n111That Jefferson believed in freedom of conscience beyond mere freedom of religion becomes clear by taking a look at his counsel on religious studies to his young nephew Peter Carr:\n\n95 TJ to Peter Carr, Aug. 10, 1787, TJW, 903-904.\n\nDo not be frightened from this inquiry by any fear of its consequences. If it ends in a belief that there is no God, you will find incitements to virtue in the comfort and pleasantness you will feel in its exercise, and the love of others which it will procure for you. … Your own reason is the only oracle given you by heaven; and you are answerable, not for the rightness but for the uprightness of the decision.\n\n116In addition to the absolute freedom of conscience—needed for remaining true to oneself in order to remain honest with others—Jefferson’s moral faith, following the ancients, included two kinds of virtues: the virtues of both the head and the heart. The former included reasoning among all truth claims, thus also offering the basis for rational social justice. The latter, the virtues of the heart, represented compassionate human virtues beyond mere justice in terms of our genuinely moral feelings of mercy and benevolence.\n\n8. Conclusion\n\n119As has been shown above, by situating the concept of politics as the centerpiece of Jefferson’s worldview we gain a good deal more coherent and consistent view of this famously complicated founding father. He has traditionally been accused of irreconcilable inconsistencies, not only in his own thinking, but in particular between what he preached and what he even attempted to attain.\n\n120He believed in human morality in terms of every-one’s personal responsibility for his/her own happiness and he believed in a political system that would one day make all this genuinely possible for the poor as well as for the rich. This view was partially indebted to the latest achievements in political science, namely the Lockean concept of social contract and Montesquieu’s division of powers as well as to the ancient concept of politics as the effort to persuade others of one’s good intentions—but most of all, and for practical reasons alone, it derived from the general idea of human equality, which demanded deconstruction of the society of orders, often viewed as the “natural” order of society even among many Americans well into the early nineteenth century.\n\n121Jefferson never claimed that slavery could be viewed as profitable for any enslaved people no matter their ethnic origins or, in the long run, even for their masters. Nor can Jefferson be held personally accountable for American racism. He did not claim to possess any scientific proof that people with African ancestors were inherently (or genetically) less capable of improvement than any other ethnic group, including whites, among whom he found a lot of people unwilling or incapable of any genuine self-betterment. Finally, Jefferson’s notion of an individual’s constant self-improvement in terms the “head and heart” resembles politics as a daily practice of negotiations with oneself and with others regarding our natural human interdependence on each other.\n\n122In the light of all this, it should be apparent why Jefferson viewed establishing the new American democratic social order as his main goal in life. He believed in majority democracy to an exceptional extent. Nevertheless, the true challenge of successful politics lay in democracy itself. Even as an “antislavery slaveholder” Jefferson needed a democratic majority to vote for emancipation in Virginia. The state’s slaveholding elite remained reluctant about the idea, just as they remained reluctant even to extend the right to vote to poor white men, who might have provided Jefferson his needed democratic majority.\n\n124Politics, as noted, was often about persuading people to do what would be in their best interest even when they did not yet grasp that themselves. Even while definitely linked to the notion of the politically empowered owing benevolence to those not yet so (or ever to be), politics as a game of power had little to do with Jefferson’s belief in progressive history.\n\n125Progress called for putting the past behind oneself. Even progressive history was therefore about the past that one cannot remedy, whereas politics was always future-oriented. Both Jefferson and Hamilton knew that. They were fighting about the future, as all politicians by definition are, and not about the uncorrectable past. If Jefferson was right in his insistence that “the earth belongs to the living,” then so does morality. Because the past is essentially beyond repair, our respect for previous generations’ mishaps, suffering, pain, and agony remains inevitably historical rather than properly moral in nature.\n\n126Morality, which consists in our respect for others, concerns us all, but primarily here and now, as a commitment to be renewed every single day. Majoritarian democracy may, indeed, remain a mere compromise. It does, however, provide an individual the right to disagree with the majority even when left in the minority oneself. Only violence is to be excluded, as it is in democracy by definition; this is why Jefferson’s insistence on the right to free speech remains the key to it all. After all, the classic advice for a voter in the election booth has always been to select the best candidate promoting the common good, which, when compatible with the voter’s own long-term interests, would inevitably include the cause of the environment, the minors, the marginalized, the poor, the elderly, and the weak."
