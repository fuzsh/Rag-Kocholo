        "meta_description": "No other home in the United States more accurately reflects the personality of its owner than Monticello. Monticello is the autobiographical masterpiece of Thomas Jefferson&mdash;designed and redesigned and built and rebuilt for more than forty years&mdash;and its gardens were a botanic showpiece, a source of food, and an experimental laboratory of ornamental and useful plants from around the world. Guided tours of the house are offered daily throughout the year; outdoor gardens and plantation tours are offered daily April-October. Children under&nbsp;5 are free. Reduced rates for adult and student groups are available. HOURS: Hours vary throughout the year; visit www.monticello.org for detailed information on Monticello's operating hours. Monticello is on Route 53 (Thomas Jefferson Parkway) in Albemarle County, near Interstate 64 Exit 121, approximately 5 miles from downtown Charlottesville and the University of Virginia, 70 miles from Richmond, 110 miles from Williamsburg and 125 miles from Washington, D.C.",
