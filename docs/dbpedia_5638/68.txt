Jerry Rubin | Introduction

Jerry Rubin was an American social activist, entrepreneur, and author, known for his prominent role in the counterculture movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Born on July 14, 1938, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Rubin became one of the most vocal and recognized figures of the era, advocating for various political and social causes. Rubin's political activism began during his time at the University of Cincinnati, where he became involved in civil rights and peace movements. He was deeply influenced by the books of Ralph Nader and visited Mississippi in 1964 to participate in the Freedom Summer campaign. This experience exposed him to the issues of racial inequality, fueling his passion for activism. In the mid-1960s, Rubin moved to Berkeley, California, a hub of counterculture and activism at the time. There, he co-founded the Vietnam Day Committee, which organized some of the earliest protests against the Vietnam War. Rubin's involvement in nonviolent demonstrations and his vocal opposition to the war led to his arrest multiple times, including during the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention protests in Chicago. Alongside his activism, Rubin was known for his charismatic persona and theatrical style. He believed in using media and spectacle to draw attention to important issues, and he often appeared in colorful and flamboyant attire, making himself a recognizable figure. Rubin's high-profile status allowed him to attract a large following, particularly among young people disillusioned with the mainstream society and seeking radical change. After the decline of the counterculture movement in the early 1970s, Rubin shifted his focus towards entrepreneurial pursuits. He co-founded the Yippies (Youth International Party) alongside Abbie Hoffman and Paul Krassner, aiming to promote a blend of social activism and satire. Additionally, Rubin ventured into business, becoming involved in the stock market and starting a successful New York-style deli in Los Angeles. In the later years of his life, Rubin experienced a significant transformation. He abandoned his radical and confrontational tactics, embracing a more spiritual and introspective path. He became interested in yoga, meditation, and new age philosophies, aiming to find personal enlightenment and inner peace. Jerry Rubin wrote several books throughout his life, documenting his experiences and ideas. Some of his notable works include "Do It! Scenarios of the Revolution," "We Are Everywhere: The Irresistible Rise of Global Anti-Capitalism," and "Growing (Up) at 37." These writings reflect his diverse range of interests and experiences, blending political analyses, personal anecdotes, and reflections on the counterculture movement. Jerry Rubin's life was abruptly cut short on November 14, 1994, when he was hit by a car in Los Angeles. However, his impact on the counterculture movement and his influence on subsequent generations of activists and social movements continue to be felt today. Rubin's legacy as a passionate and dedicated advocate for change serves as an inspiration for those seeking to challenge the status quo and fight for a more just and equitable society.
