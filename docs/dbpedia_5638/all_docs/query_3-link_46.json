        "text": "Yippie!\n\nTitle\n\nYippie!\n\nSubject\n\nCounterculture and New Left\n\nDescription\n\nThe Youth International Party, known as the \"Yippies,\" was founded in 1967 by Abbie and Anita Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Nancy Kurshan, and Paul Krassner. Other activists involved with the Yippes included, Stew Albert, Ed Rosenthal, Allen Ginsberg, Ed Sanders, Robin Morgan,Phil Ochs, Robert M. Ockene, William Kunstler, Jonah Raskin, Steve Conliff, John Sinclair, Dana Beal, Betty (Zaria) Andrew, Matthew Landy Steen, Judy Gumbo, Ben Masel, Tom Forcade, David Peel, Wavy Gravy, Aron Kay, Tuli Kupferberg, Jill Johnston, Daisy Deadhead, Leatrice Urbanowicz, Bob Fass, John Murdock, Alice Torbush, Judy Lampe, Walli Leff, Steve DeAngelo, Dennis Peron, and Brenton Lengel. According to Krasner, who coined the term, Yippies were “radicalized hippies.” In a 2007 essay in the Los Angeles Times, Krasner explained, \"We needed a name to signify the radicalization of hippies, and I came up with Yippie as a label for a phenomenon that already existed, an organic coalition of psychedelic hippies and political activists. In the process of cross-fertilization at antiwar demonstrations, we had come to share an awareness that there was a linear connection between putting kids in prison for smoking pot in this country and burning them to death with napalm on the other side of the planet.\" Further, Anita Hoffman liked the term, but felt that \"strait-laced types\" needed a more formal name to take the movement seriously. She came up with \"Youth International Party,\" because it symbolized the movement and made for a good play on words. Some referred to the group as \"Yippie!,\" as in a shout for joy (with an exclamation mark to express exhilaration). As Abbie Hoffman wrote, \"What does Yippie! mean?\" Energy – fun – fierceness – exclamation point!\"\n\nThe Yippies were influenced by The Diggers in San Francisco and often used guerilla theater, pranks, absurdist forms of protest, as well as political and cultural disruption in their activism. They sought to merge the personal with the political… and have fun in the process. ABC News once stated, \"The group was known for street theater pranks and was once referred to as the 'Groucho Marxists'.\" Among their many storied antics, the Yippies suggested lacing the New York City water supply with LSD, sent joints to hundreds of random people in New York from the telephone book, threw fake money on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and suggested a circle of hippies could “levitate” the Pentagon during an October 1967 protest. The Yippies understood the dominant role of mass media and television in contemporary society and often went on television, but refused to obey the normal rules of corporate TV production, hoping to “break the frame” and reveal to audiences the constructed nature of mass media. As Krassner later recalled, “[T]he more visual and surreal the stunts we could cook up, the easier it would be to get on the news, and the more weird and whimsical and provocative the theater, the better it would play.” The Yippies were also involved in the underground press movement. Much of the writing and visual culture they produced consisted of obscenity-laced diatribes against mainstream society, but made few serious calls to militant action.\n\nAbbie Hoffman and the Yippies first suggested a “Festival of Life” in the park outside of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. They also planned to nominate a pig, nicknamed “Pigasus,” for President. Other New Left organizations joined the effort, which ultimately descended into chaos when Chicago police, at the order of authoritarian Democratic Mayor Richard Daley, attacked and brutally beat demonstrators in front of reporters and television cameras, causing an international controversy. In the melee, many Yippies were injured and arrested, including Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, who were put on trial as a part of what become known as the Chicago 7.\n\nIn 1970, an estimated 200-300 members of the Yippies descended on the Disneyland amusement park in Anaheim, California, to hold what was billed as their “First International Pow-Wow” to protest the U.S.’s continuing involvement in the Vietnam War and to liberate Disneyland as a symbol of the establishment. Hoffman authored a pamphlet in 1967, titled, “Fuck the System”; two books, “Revolution for the Hell of It” (1968) and “Steal This Book” (1971); and an LP record, “Woodstock Nation: A Talk-Rock Album” (1969).\n\nThe Yippies began to fragment and disintegrate during the 1970s. A disillusioned Hoffman committed suicide in 1989. Jerry Rubin became a “Yuppie” during the 1980s, embracing capitalism and starting a number of businesses. He was killed in 1994 when he was struck by a car. Even so, a number of Yippie followers have carried on in the same spirit.\n\n_______\n\nHere is a brief clip of Abbie Hoffman discussing Yippie tactics during the 1968 Democratic National Convention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=29&v=2oujcg_Tifw\n\nHere is Jerry Rubin speaking to a group of Yippies days before the 1968 Democratic National Convention: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=oZlmjZPrG0s\n\n________\n\nYippie Manifesto\n\nBy Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin (1968)\n\nCome in to the streets on Nov. 5, election day. Vote with your feet. Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball! Demand the bars be open. Make music and dance at every red light. A festival of life in the streets and parks throughout the world. The American election represents death, and we are alive.\n\nCome all you rebels, youth spirits, rock minstrels, bomb throwers, bank robbers, peacock freaks, toe worshippers, poets, street folk, liberated women, professors and body snatchers: it is election day and we are everywhere.\n\nDon't vote in a jackass‐elephant‐cracker circus. Let's vote for ourselves. Me for President. We are the revolution. We will strike and boycott the election and create our own reality.\n\nCan you dig it: in every metropolis and hamlet of America boycotts, strikes, sit‐ins, pickets, lie‐ins, pray‐ins, feel‐ins, piss‐ins at the polling places.\n\nNobody goes to work. Nobody goes to school. Nobody votes. Everyone becomes a life actor of the street doing his thing, making the revolution by freeing himself and fucking up the system.\n\nMinisters dragged away from polling places. Free chicken and ice cream in the streets. Thousands of kazoos, drums, tambourines, triangles, pots and pans, trumpets, street fairs, firecrackers – a symphony of life on a day of death. LSD in the drinking water.\n\nLet's parade in the thousands to the places where the votes are counted and let murderous racists feel our power.\n\nForce the National Guard to protect every polling place in the country. Brush your teeth in the streets. Organize a sack race. Join the rifle club of your choice. Freak out the pigs with exhibitions of snake dancing and karate at the nearest pig pen.\n\nRelease a Black Panther in the Justice Department. Hold motorcycle races a hundred yards from the polling places. Fly an American flag out of every house so confused voters can't find the polling places. Wear costumes. Take a burning draft card to Spiro Agnew.\n\nStall for hours in the polling places trying to decide between Nixon and Humphrey and Wallace. Take your clothes off. Put wall posters up all over the city. Hold block parties. Release hundreds o f greased pigs in pig uniforms downtown.\n\nCheck it out in Europe and throughout the world thousands of students will march on the USA embassies demanding to vote in the election cause Uncle Pig controls the world. No domination without representation.\n\nLet's make 2‐300 Chicago's on election day.\n\n(On election day let's pay tribute to rioters, anarchists, Commies, runaways, draft dodgers, acid freaks, snipers, beatniks, deserters, Chinese s pies. Let's exorcise all politicians, generals, publishers, businessmen, Popes, American Legion, AMA, FBI, narcos, informers.\n\nAnd then on Inauguration Day Jan. 20 we will bring our revolutionary theater to Washington to inaugurate Pigasus, our pig, the only honest candidate, and turn the White House into a crash pad. They will have to put Nixon's hand on the bible in a glass cage.\n\nBegin now: resist oppression as you feel it. Organize and begin the word of mouth communication that is the basis of all conspiracies ....\n\nEvery man a revolution! Every small group a revolutionary center! We will be together on election day. Yippie!!!\n\n________\n\nA Yippie Manifesto\n\nby Jerry Rubin\n\nThis is a Viet Cong flag on my back. During the recent hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee in Washington, a friend and I are walking down the street en route to Congress – he’s wearing an American flag and I’m wearing this VC flag.\n\nThe cops mass, and boom! I am going to be arrested for treason, for supporting the enemy.\n\nAnd who do the cops grab and throw in the paddy wagon?\n\nMy friend with the American flag.\n\nAnd I’m left all alone in the VC flag.\n\n“What kind of a country is this?” I shout at the cops. “YOU COMMUNISTS!”\n\nEverything is cool en route to Canada until the border. An official motions me into a small room and pulls out a five-page questionnaire.\n\n“Do you use drugs?” he asks quite seriously.\n\n“Yeah,” I say.\n\n“Which?”\n\n“Coca Cola.”\n\n“I mean DRUGS! He shouts.\n\n“Coca Cola is more dangerous for you than marijuana,” I say. “Fucks up your body, and it’s addictive.”\n\n“Have you ever advocated the overthrow of the Canadian government?” he asks.\n\n“Not until I get into Canada.”\n\nHave you ever been arrested for inciting to riot?”\n\nI reply no, and it is true. In August I was arrested in Chicago for something similar, “solicitation to mob action,” a violation of a sex statute.\n\nFinally I ask the border official to drop out. “Man, your job is irrelevant,” I say. “The Canadian-American border does not exist. There are no such things as borders. The border exists only in your head.\n\n“No state has the right to ask me these questions. The answers are mine. Next thing I know you guys will be tapping my brain!”\n\nI try to get the cat to take off his uniform right there. But he refuses, saying, “I’ve got a job to do and a family to support.”\n\nSo goes the cancer of the Western World: everyone just doing his “Job.” Nobody learned the lesson of Eichmann. Everyone still points the finger elsewhere.\n\nAmerica and the West suffer from a great spiritual crisis. And so the yippies are a revolutionary religious movement.\n\nWe do not advocate political solutions that you can vote for. You are never going to be able to vote for the revolution. Get that hope out of your mind.\n\nAnd you are not going to be able to buy the revolution in a supermarket, in the tradition of our consumer society. The revolution is not a can of goods.\n\nRevolution only comes through personal transformation: finding God and changing your life. Then millions of converts will create a massive social upheaval.\n\nThe religion of the yippies is: “RISE UP AND ABANDON THE CREEPING MEATBALL!”\n\nThat means anything you want it to mean. Which is why it is so powerful a revolutionary slogan. The best picket sign I ever saw was blank. Next best was: “We Protest__________!”\n\nSlogans like “Get out of Vietnam” are informative, but they do not create myths. They don’t ask you to do anything but carry them.\n\nPolitical demonstrations should make people dream and fantasize. A religious-political movement is concerned with people’s souls, with the creation of a magic world which we make real.\n\nWhen the national media first heard our slogan, they reported that the “creeping meatball” was Lyndon Johnson. Which was weird and unfair, because we liked Lyndon Johnson.\n\nWe cried when LBJ dropped out. “LBJ, you took us too literally! We didn’t mean YOU should drop out! Where would WE be if it weren’t for you, LBJ?”\n\nIs there any kid in America, or anywhere in the world, who wants to be like LBJ when he grows up?\n\nAs a society falls apart, its children reject their parents. The elders offer us Johnsons, Agnews, and Nixons, dead symbols of a dying past.\n\nThe war between THEM and US will be decided by the seven-year-olds.\n\nWe offer: sex, drugs, rebellion, heroism, brotherhood.\n\nThey offer: responsibility, fear, Puritanism, repression.\n\nDig the movie Wild in the Streets! A teenage rock-and-roll singer campaigns for a Bobby Kennedy-type politician.\n\nSuddenly he realizes: “We’re all young! Let’s run the country ourselves!”\n\n“Lower the voting age to 14!”\n\n“14 or FIGHT!”\n\nThey put LSD in the water fountains of Congress and the Congressmen have a beautiful trip. Congress votes to lower the voting age to 14.\n\nThe rock-and-roll singer is elected President, but the CIA and military refuse to recognize the vote. Thousands of long-hairs storm the White House, and six die in the siege. Finally the kids take power, and they put all people over 30 into camps and given them LSD every day. (Some movies are even stranger than OUR fantasies.)\n\n“Don’t trust anyone over 30!” say the yippies – a much-quoted warning.\n\nI am four years old.\n\nWe are born twice. My first birth was in 1938, but I was reborn in Berkeley in 1964 in the Free Speech movement.\n\nWhen we say “Don’t trust anyone over 30,” we’re talking about the second birth. I got 26 more years.\n\nWhen people 40 years old come up to me and say, “Well, I guess I can’t be part of your movement,” I say, “What do you mean? You could have been born yesterday. Age exists in your head.”\n\nBertrand Russell is our leader. He’s 90 years old.\n\nAnother yippie saying is “THE GROUND YOU STAND ON IS LIBEATED TERRITORY!”\n\nEverybody in this society is a policeman. We all police ourselves. When we free ourselves, the real cops take over.\n\nI don’t smoke pot in public often, although I love to. I don’t want to be arrested: that’s the only reason.\n\nI police myself.\n\nWe do not own our own bodies.\n\nWe fight to regain our bodies…to make love in the parks, say “fuck” on television, do what we want to do whenever we want to do it.\n\nProhibitions should be prohibited.\n\nRules are made to be broken.\n\nNever say “no.”\n\nThe yippies say: “PROPERTY IS THEFT.’\n\nWhat America got, she stole.\n\nHow was this country built? By the forced labor of slaves. America owes black people billions in compensation.\n\n“Capitalism” is just a polite schoolbook way of saying: “Stealing.”\n\nWho deserves what they get in America? Do the Rockefellers deserve their wealth? HELL NO!\n\nAmerica says that people work only for money. But check it out: those who don’t have money work the hardest, and those who have money take very long lunch hours.\n\nWhen I was born I had food on my table and a roof over my head. Most babies born in the world face hunger and cold. What is the difference between them and me?\n\nEvery well-off white American better ask himself that question or he will never understand why people hate America.\n\nThe enemy is this dollar bill right here in my hand.\n\nNow if I get a match, I’ll show you what I think of it.\n\nThis burning gets some political radicals very uptight. I don’t know exactly why. They burn a lot of money putting out leaflets nobody reads.\n\nI think it is more important today to burn a dollar bill than it is to burn a draft card.\n\n“Humm, pretty resilient. Hard to burn. Anybody got a lighter?”\n\nWe go to the New York Stock Exchange, about 20 of us, our pockets stuffed with dollar bills. We want to throw real dollars down at all those people on the floor playing monopoly games with numbers.\n\nAn official stops us at the door and says, “You can’t come in. You are hippies and you are coming to demonstrate.”\n\nWith TV cameras flying away, we reply: “Hippies? Demonstrate? We’re Jews. And we’re coming to see the stock market.”\n\nWell, that gets the guy uptight, and he lets us in. We get to the top, and the dollars start raining down on the floor below.\n\nThese guys deal in millions of dollars as a game, never connecting it to people starving. Have they ever seen a real dollar bill?\n\nThis is what it is all about, you sonavabitches!!”\n\nLook at them: wild animals chasing and fighting each other over dollar bills thrown by the hippies!\n\nAnd then someone calls the cops . The cops are a necessary part of any demonstration; always include a role for the cops. Cops legitimize demonstrations.\n\nThe cops throw us out.\n\nIt is noon. Wall Street Businessmen with briefcases and suits and ties. Money freaks going to lunch. Important business deals. Time. Appointments.\n\nAnd there we are in the middle of it, burning five-dollar bills. Burning their world. Burning their Christ.\n\n“Don’t, Don’t!” some scream, grasping for the sacred paper. Several near fist-fights break out.\n\nWe escape with our lives.\n\nWeeks later The New York Times publishes a short item revealing that the New York Stock Exchange is installing a bullet-proof glass window between the visitor’s platform and the floor, so that “nobody can shot a stockbroker.”\n\nIn Chicago, 5,000 yuppies come, armed only with our skin. The cops bring tanks, dogs, guns, gas, long-range rifles, missiles. Is this South Vietnam or Chicago? America always overreacts.\n\nThe American economy is doomed to collapse because it has no soul. Its stability is war and preparation for war. Consumer products are built to break, and advertising brainwashes us to consume new ones.\n\nThe rich feel guilty. The poor are taught to hate themselves. The guilty and the wretched are on a collision course.\n\nIf the men who control the technology used it for human needs and not profit and murder, every human being on the planet could be free from starvation. Machines could do most of the world: People would be free to do what they want.\n\nWe should be very realistic and demand the impossible. Food, housing, clothing, medicine, and color TV free for all!!\n\nPeople would work because of love, creativity, and brotherhood. A new economic structure would produce a new man.\n\nThat new structure will be created by new men.\n\nAmerican society, because of its Western-Christian-Capitalist bag, is organized on the fundamental premise that man is bad, society evil, and that: People must be motivated and forced by external reward and punishment.\n\nWe are a new generation, species, race. We are bred on affluence, turned on by drugs, at home in our bodies, and excited by the future and its possibilities.\n\nEverything for us is an experience, done for love or not done at all.\n\nWe live off the fat of society. Our fathers worked all-year round for a two-week vacation. Our entire life is a vacation.\n\nEvery moment, every day we decide what we are going to do.\n\nWe do not groove with Christianity, the idea that people go to heaven after they are dead. We want HEAVEN NOW!\n\nWe do not believe in studying to obtain degrees in school. Degrees and grades are like money and credit, good only for burning.\n\nThere is a war going on in the Western world: a war of genocide by the old against the young.\n\nThe economy is closed. It does not need us. Everything is built.\n\nSo the purpose of universities is: to get us off the streets. Schools are baby-sitting agencies.\n\nThe purpose of the Vietnam War is: to get rid of blacks. They are a nuisance. America got the work she needed out of blacks, but now she has no use for them.\n\nIt is a psychological war. The old say, “We want you to die for us.” The old send the young to die for the old.\n\nOur response? Draft-card burning and draft dodging! We won’t die for you.\n\nYoung whites are dropping out of white society. We are getting our heads straight, creating new identities. We’re dropping out of middle-class institutions, leaving their schools, running away from their homes, and forming our own communities.\n\nWe are becoming the new niggers.\n\nI’m getting on a plane en route to Washington. An airline official comes up to me and says, “You can’t go on this airplane.”\n\n“Why not?” I ask.\n\n“Because you smell.”\n\nThat’s what they used to say about black people, remember? They don’t say that about black people anymore. They’d get punched in their fucking mouths.\n\nOur long hair communicates disrespect to America. A racist, short-hair society gets freaked by long hair. It blinds people. In Vietnam, America bombs the Vietnamese, but cannot see them because they are brown.\n\nLong-hair is vital to us because it enables us to recognize each other. We have white skin like our oppressors. Long hair ties us together into a visible counter-community.\n\nA car drives down the street, parents in front, and a 15-year-old longhair kid in back. The kid gives me the “V” sign! That’s the kind of communication taking place.\n\nWithin our community we have the seeds of a new society. We have our own communications network, the underground press. We have the beginnings of a new family structure in communes. We have our own stimulants.\n\nWhen the cops broke into my home on the Lower East Side to arrest me for possession of pot, it was like American soldiers invading a Vietnamese village. They experienced cultural shock.\n\nFidel Castro was on the wall. They couldn’t believe it! Beads! They played with my beads for 20 minutes.\n\nWhen the cops kidnapped me in Chicago, they interviewed me as if I had just landed from Mars.\n\n“Do you fuck each other?”\n\n“What is it like on LSD?”\n\n“Do you talk directly with the Viet Cong?”\n\nThe two generations cannot communicate with one another because of our different historical experiences.\n\nOur parents suffered through the Depression and World War II. We experience the consumer economy and the U.S.A. as a military bully in Vietnam.\n\nFrom 1964 to 1968 the movement has been involved in the destruction of the old symbols of America. Through our actions we have redefined those symbols for the youth.\n\nKids growing up today expect school to be a place to demonstrate, sit-in, fight authority, and maybe get arrested.\n\nDemonstrations become the initiation rites, rituals, and social celebrations of a new generation.\n\nRemember the Pentagon, center of the military ego? We urinated on it. Thousands of stone freaks stormed the place, carrying Che’s picture and stuffing flowers in the rifles of the 82nd Airborne.\n\nRemember the Democratic Convention? Who, after Chicago, can read schoolbook descriptions of national political conventions with a straight face anymore? The farce within the convention became clear because of the war between the yippies and the cops in the streets.\n\nWe are calling the bluff on myths of America. Once the myth is exposed, the structure behind it crumbles like sand. Chaos results. People must create new realities.\n\nIn the process we create new myths, and these new myths forecast the future.\n\nIn America in 1969 old myths can be destroyed overnight, and new ones created overnight because of the power of television. By making communications instantaneous, television telescopes the rev solution by centuries. What might have taken 100 years will now take 20. What used to happen in 10 years now happens in two. In a dying society, television becomes a revolutionary instrument.\n\nFor her own protection, the government is soon going to have to suppress freedom of the press and take direct control over what goes on television, especially the news.\n\nTV has dramatized the longhair drop-out movement so well that virtually every young kid in the country wants to grow up and be a demonstrator.\n\nWhat do you want to be when you grow up? A fireman? A cop? A professor?\n\n“I want to grow up and make history.”\n\nYoung kids watch TV’s thrill-packed coverage of demonstrations – including the violence and excitement – and dream about being in them. They look like fun.\n\nMayor Daley put out this television film about Chicago. It had cops beating up young longhairs. In one scene, the cops threw a tear-gas canister into the crowd, and one demonstrator picked it up and heaved it right back.\n\nWho do you think every kid in the country identified with?\n\nThen the announcer said the chiller: “These demonstrations are Communist led!…”\n\nCommunism? Who the hell knows from Communism? We never lived thro8ugh Stalin. We read about it, but it doesn’t affect us emotionally. Our emotional reaction to Communism is Fidel marching into Havana in 1959.\n\nThere is NO WORD that the Man has to turn off your youth, no scare word.\n\n“They’re for ANARCHY!”\n\nDamn right, we’re for anarchy! This country is fucking over-organized anyway. “DON’T DO THIS! DON”T DO THAT, Don’t!”\n\nGrowing up in America is learning what NOT to do.\n\nWe say: “DO IT, DO IT. DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.”\n\nOur battlegrounds are the campuses of America. White middle-class youth are strategically located in the high schools and colleges of this country. They are our power bases.\n\nIf one day 100 campuses were closed in a nationally coordinated rebellion, we could force the President of the United States to sue for peace at the conference table.\n\nAs long as we are in school we are prisoners. Schools are voluntary jails. We must liberate ourselves.\n\nDig the geography of a university. You can always tell what the rulers have up their sleeves when you check out the physical environment they create. The buildings tell you how to behave. Then there is less need for burdensome rules and cops. They designed classrooms so that students sit in rows, one after the other, hierarchically facing the professor who stands up front talking to all of them.\n\nClassrooms say:\n\n“Listen to the Professor.\n\n“He teaches you.\n\n“Keep your place.\n\n“Don’t stretch out.\n\n“Don’t lie on the floor.\n\n“Don’t relax.\n\n“Don’t speak out of turn.\n\n“Don’t take off your clothes.\n\n“Don’t get emotional.\n\n“Let the mind rule the body.\n\n“Let the needs of the classroom rule the mind.\n\nClassrooms are totalitarian environments. The main purpose of school and education in America is to force you to accept and love authority, and to distrust your own spontaneity and emot8ons.\n\nHow can you grow in such an over-structured environment? You can’t. Schools aren’t for learning.\n\nClassrooms should be organized in circles, with the professor one part of the circle. A circle is a democratic environment.\n\nTry breaking up the environment. Scream “Fuck” in the middle of your prof’s lecture. ‘\n\nSo we organized a University of the Flesh. Four of us go into a classroom. We sit in the middle of the class. The lecture is on “Thinking.”\n\nThinking!\n\nWe take off our shirts, smoke joints and start French kissing. A lot of students get nervous. This goes on for 10-15 minutes, and the professor goes on with his lecture like nothing is happening.\n\nFinally a girl says, “The people there are causing a distraction, and could they either put their shirts back on or could they please leave.”\n\nAnd the prof says, “Well, I agree with that. I think that if you’re not here to hear what I’m saying…”\n\nWe shout: “You can’t separate thinking from loving! We are hard in thought!!”\n\nAnd the prof says, “Well, in my classroom I give the lessons.”\n\nScratch a professor deep and you find a cop!\n\nFucking milquetoast! Didn’t have the guts to throw us out, but in his classroom HE GIVES the lesson. So he sends his teaching assistant to get the cops, and we split.\n\nThe mind is programmed. Get in there and break that bloody program!\n\nCan you imagine what a feeling a professor has standing in front of a class and looking at a room full of bright faces taking down every word he says, raising their hands and asking questions? It really makes someone think he is God. And to top it off, he has the power to reward and punish you, to decide whether or not you are fit to advance in the academic rat race.\n\nIs this environment the right one for teacher and student?\n\nSocrates is turning in his grave.\n\nI was telling a professor of philosophy at Berkeley that many of his students were wiser men than he, even en though he may have read more books and memorized more theories.\n\nHe replied, “Well, I must take the lead in the transfer of knowledge.”\n\nTransfer of knowledge! What is knowledge?\n\nHow to Live.\n\nHow to Legalize Marijuana.\n\nHow to Make a Revolution.\n\nHow to Free People from Jail.\n\nHow to Organize Against the CIA.\n\nWhen a professor takes off his suit and tie, and joins us in the streets, then I say, “Hay man, what’s your first name?” You’re my brother. Let’s go. We’re together.”\n\nI don’t dig the “professor” bullshit. I am more interested in a 15-year-old stoned dope freak living on street corners than I am in a Ph.D.\n\nThere is anti-intellectualism in America because professors have created an artificial environment. That is why the average working guy does not respect professors.\n\nThe university is a protective and plastic scene, shielding people from the reality of life, the reality of suffering, of ecstasy, of struggle. The university converts the agony of life into the securi6ty of words and books.\n\nYou can’t learn anything in school. Spend one hour in a jail or a courtroom and you will learn more than in five years spent in a university.\n\nAll I learned in school was how to beat the system, how to fake answers. But there are no answers. There are only more questions. Life is a long journey of questions, answered thro8ugh the challenge of living. You would never know that, living in a university ruled by the “right” answers to the wrong questions.\n\nGraffiti in school bathrooms tells you more about what’s on people’s minds than all the books in the library.\n\nWe must liberate ourselves. I dropped out. The shit got up to my neck and I stopped eating. I said: NO. NO. NO!! I’m dropping out.\n\nPeople at Columbia found out what it felt like to learn when they seized buildings and lived in communes for days.\n\nWe have to redesign the environment and remake human relationships. But if you try it, you will be kicked out.\n\nYou know what professors and deans will say? “Of you don’t like it here, why don’t you go back to Russia!”\n\nA lot is demanded of white, middle-class youth in 1969. The whole thing about technological and bureaucratic society is that it is not made for heroes. We must become heroes.\n\nThe young kids living in the streets as new niggers are the pioneers of tomorrow, living dangerously and existentially.\n\nThe yippies went to Chicago to have our counter-festival, a “Festival of Life” in the parks of Chicago, as a human contrast to the “Convention of Death” of the Democrats.\n\nI get a phone call on Christmas Day, 1967 from Marvin Garson, the editor of the San Francisco Express-Times, and he says, “Hay, it looks like the Peace and Freedom Party is not going to get on the ballot.”\n\nI say, “I don’t care. I’m not interested in electoral politics anyway.”\n\nAnd he says, “Let’s run a pig for President.”\n\nAn arrow shoots through my brain. Yeah! A pig, with buttons, posters, bumper stickers.\n\n“America, why take half a hog, when you can have the whole hog.”\n\nAt the Democratic convention, the pigs nominate the President and he eats the people.\n\nAt the yippie convention, we nominate our pig and after he makes his nominating speech, we earth him. The contrast is clear: should the President earth the people or the people earth the President?\n\nWell, we didn’t kill our pig. If there is one issue that could split the yippies, it is the issue of vegetarianism. A lot of yippies don’t believe in killing and eating animals, so I had to be less militant on that point.\n\nWe bring Pigasus to Chicago, and he is arrested in Civic Center. The cops grab him. They grab seven of us, and they throw us in the paddy wagon with Pigasus.\n\nThe thing about running a pig for President is that it cuts through the shits. People’s minds are full of things like, “You may elect a greater evil.” We must break through their logic. Once we get caught in their logic, we’re trapped in it.\n\nJust freak it all out and proclaim: “This country is run on the principles of garbage. The Democratic and Republican parties have nominated a pig. So have we. We’re honest about it.”\n\nIn Chicago, Pigasus was a hell of a lot more effective than all those lackeys running around getting votes for the politicians. It turned out that the pig was more relevant to the current American political scene than Senator Eugene McCarthy. I never thought McCarthy could reform the Democratic Party. Hell, McCarthy barely got into the convention himself. He had to have a ticket. That’s how controlled the damn thing was. Finally, we forced McCarthy out into the streets with the people.\n\nThe election was not fair because every time we brought eh pigs out to give a campaign speech, they arrested him. It happened in Chicago, in New York, in San Francisco, even in London.\n\nThe yippies asked that the presidential elections be cancelled until the rules of the game were changed. We said that everyone in the role should both in American elections because America controls the world.\n\nFree elections are elections in which the people who vote are the people affected by the results. The Vietnamese have more right to vote in the American elections than some 80-year-old grandmother in Omaha. They’re being bombed by America! They should have at least some choice about it, how, and by whom they are going to be bombed.\n\nI have nothing in particular against 80-year-old grandmothers, but I am in favor of lowering the voting age to 12 or 14 years. And I’m not sure whether people over 50 should vote.\n\nIt is the young kids who are going to live in this world in the next 50 years. They should choose what they want for themselves.\n\nMost people over 50 don’t think about the potentialities of the future: they are preoccupied with justifying their past.\n\nThe only people who can choose change without suffering blows to their egos are the young, and change is the rhythm of the universe.\n\nMany older people are constantly warning: “The right wing will get you.” “George Wallace will get your momma.”\n\nI am so scared of George Wallace that I wore his fucking campaign button. I went to his campaign rally – all old ladies.\n\nThere are six Nazis who come with black gloves and mouthpieces, looking for a fight. And two fights break out. Two guys with long hair beat the shit out of them.\n\nI am not afraid of the right wing because the right wing does not have the youth behind it.\n\n“Straight” people get very freaked by Wallace. “Freaks” know the best way to fuck Wallace up. We support him.\n\nAt Wallace’s rally in the Cow Palace in Sand Francisco, we come with signs saying “CUT THEIR HAIR1” “SEND THEM BACK TO AFRICA!” “BOMB THE VIETNAMESE BACK TO THE STONE AGE!”\n\nWhen we arrive there is a picket line going on in front of the rally. I recognize it is the Communist Party picketing.\n\nWhat? Picketing Wallace?\n\nI walk up to my friend Bettina Aptheker and say, “Bettina, you’re legitimizing him. You’re legitimizing him by picketing. Instead, support him, kiss him. When he says the next hippie in front of his car will be the last hippie, cheer! Loudly!”\n\nWe have about two hundred people there, and we are the loudest people at the rally. Every five seconds we are jumping up and swearing. “Heil! Hitler! Heil! Hitler!”\n\nWallace is a sick man. America is the loony bin. The only way to cure her is through theatrical shock. Wallace is necessary because he brings to the surface the racism and hate that is deep within the country.\n\nThe hippie Fugs spearheaded the anti-war movement of the past five years by touring theaters and dance halls shouting into a microphone: “Kill, Kill, Kill for Peace! Kill, Kill, I’ll for Peace!”\n\nWallace says aloud what most people say privately. He exposes the beast within liberal America. He embarrasses the liberal who says in one breath, “Oh, I like Negroes,” and then in another breath, “We must eliminate crime in the streets.”\n\nRemember what Huey Long said: “When fascism comes to America, it will come as Americanism.”\n\nWallace may be the best thing for those of us who are fighting him. You can only fight a disease after you recognize the diagnose it. America does not suffer from a cold: she has cancer.\n\nThe liberals who run this country agree with Wallace more than they disagree with him. George tells tales out of school. The liberals are going to have to shut that honest motherfucker up.\n\nDo you dig that most cops support Wallace? Cops – the people who make and enforce the law in the streets! Wallace speaks FOR them.\n\nIsn’t that scary? Can’t you see why blacks are getting guns and organizing into small self-defense units? Wouldn’t you, if you were in their situation? Shouldn’t you be?\n\nMake America see her vampire face in the mirror. Destroy that gap between public talk and private behavior. Only when people see what’s happening can they hear our screams, and feel our passion.\n\nThe Vietnam War is an education for America. It is an expansive teaching experience, but the American people are the most brink-washed people in the world.\n\nAt least the youth are learning that this country is no paradise – America kills infants and children in Vietnam without blinking. Only professional killers can be so cool.\n\nIf you become hip to America in Vietnam, you can understand the reaction against the red-white-and-blue in Latin America, and you can feel why China hates us.\n\nThey are not irrational – America is.\n\nWallace is a left-wing agitator. Dig him. He speaks to the same anxiety and powerlessness that the New Left and yippies talk about.\n\nDo you feel overwhelmed by bigness, including Big Government?\n\nDo you lack control over your own life?\n\nAre you distrustful of the politicians and bureaucrats in Washington?\n\nAre you part of the “little people?”\n\nWallace stirs the masses. Revolutions should do that too.\n\nWhen is the left going to produce an inflammatory and authentic voice of the people? A guy who reaches people’s emotions? Who talks about revolution the way some of those nuts rap about Christ?\n\nWallace says: “We’re against niggers, intellectuals, liberals, hippies.”\n\nEverybody! He puts us all together. He organizes us for us.\n\nWe must analyze how America keeps people down. Not by physical force, but by fear. From the second kids are hatched, we are taught fear. If we can overcome fear, we will discover that we are Davids fighting Goliath.\n\nIn late September a friend calls and says, “Hay, I just got a subpoena from HUAC.”\n\nI say, “Yeah” I didn’t. What’s going on here? I’m angry. I want a subpoena too.\n\nIt’s called subpoenas envy.\n\nSo I telephone a confident to the Red Squad, a fascist creep who works for the San Francisco Examiner, and I say, “Hey, Ed, baby, what about HUAC? Are they having hearings?”\n\nHe answers, “Well, I don’t know. Are they?”\n\nWell, my friend just got a subpoena.” I say. “I’d like on too. If you can manage it.”\n\nHe says, “Call me back in a few hours.”\n\nI call him back that afternoon and he says, “Well, I just talked to HUAC in Washington, and you are right. They are having hearings, and they are looking for you in New York.”\n\nIn NEW YORK? I’ve been in Berkeley a week! You guys are sure doing a shitty job trying to save this country!”\n\nWe exaggerate the surveillance powers of cops. We shouldn’t. They are lazy. Their laziness may be the one reason why America doesn’t yet have a totally efficient police state.\n\nThe cops were not lazy in Chicago. They followed the “leaders” continuously, 24 hours a day. If you are trailed by four cops just six steps behind you, you can’t do very much.\n\nBut the people really doing things – why, the cops didn’t even know who they were!\n\nPigs cannot relate to anarchy. They do not understand a movement based on personal freedom. When they look at our movement, they look for a hierarchy: leaders, lieutenants, followers.\n\nThe pigs think that we are organized like a pig department. We are not, and that’s why we are going to win. A hierarchical, top-down organization is no match for the free and loose energy of the people.\n\nAs the pigs check with their high-ups to find out what to do next, we have already switched the tactics and scene of the battle. They are watching one guy over there, and it is happening over here!\n\nI come to the HUAC hearings wearing a bandolero of real bullets and carrying a toy M-16 rifle on my shoulder. The rifle was a model of the rifles the Viet Cong steal and then use to kill American soldiers in Vietnam.\n\nThe pigs stop me at the door of the hearings. They grab the bullets and the gun. It is a dramatic moment. Press and yippies pack us in tightly. The pigs drag me down three flights of stairs and remove the bullets, leaving the gun, Viet Cong pajamas, Eldridge Cleaver buttons, Black Panther beret, war paint, earrings, bandolero, and the bells which ring every time I move my body. My costume carried a nonverbal message: “We must all become stoned guerrillas.”\n\nThe secret to the costume was the painted tits. Guerrilla war in America is going to come in psychedelic colors. We are hippie-guerrillas.\n\nIn HUAC’s chambers Abbie Hoffman jumps up and yells out, “May I do to the bathroom?” Young kids reading that in their hometown papers giggle because they have to ask permission every time they want to go to the bathroom in school.\n\nThe message of my costume flipped across the country in one day: an example of our use of the enemy’s institutions – her mass media – to turn on and communicate with one another.\n\nI wore a Santa Clause costume to HUAC two months later in a direct attempt to reach the head of every child in the country.\n\nOur victories are catching up with us: America isn’t ready to napalm us yet, but the future doesn’t look easy.\n\nFrom June to November 1968, when I was helping to organize the demonstrations against the Democratic convention in Chicago, I experienced the following example of Americana:\n\nNew York pigs use a phony search warrant to bust into my apartment, question me, beat me, search the apartment and arrest me for alleged felonious possession of marijuana; a pig in Chicago disguises himself as a biker to “infiltrate” the yippies as an agent provocateur and spy; he busts me on a frame-up, “solicitation to mob action,” a felony punishable by five years in the pen; the judge imposes $25,000 bail and restricts my travel to Illinois; then the Justice Department in a document to a Virginia court admits that it maintains “electronic surveillance…of Jerry Rubin..in the interests of national security.”\n\nTo try to suppress youth, Nixon will have to destroy the Constitution.\n\nWe will be presumed guilty until proven innocent.\n\nOur privacy will vanish. Big Brother will spy on all of us and dominate our lives.\n\nEvery cop will become a law until himself.\n\nThe courts will become automatic transmission belts sending us to detention camps and prisons.\n\nPeople will be arrested for what they write and say.\n\nCongress will impose censorship on the mass media, unless the media first censors itself, which is more likely.\n\nTo be young will be a crime.\n\nIn response, we must never become cynical, or lose our capacity for anger. We must stay on the offensive and be aggressive: AMERICA: IF YOU INJURE ONE, YOU MUST FIGHT ALL.\n\nIf our opposition is united, the repression may backfire and fail. The government may find the costs too heavy.\n\nDon’t think, “They can never get ME.”\n\nThey can.\n\nYou are either on the side of the cops or on the side of human beings.\n\nYIPPIE!\n\nCreator\n\nYouth International Party\n\nSource\n\nRoz Payne\n\nPublisher\n\nCenter for Digital Research in the Humanities, University of Nebraska-Lincoln\n\nFormat\n\nButton\n\nType\n\nPhysical Object\n\nCollection\n\nButtons\n\nCitation\n\nYouth International Party, “Yippie!,” Roz Payne Sixties Archive, accessed August 15, 2024, https://rozsixties.unl.edu/items/show/113."
