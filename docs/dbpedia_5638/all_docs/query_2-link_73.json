        "text": "Among the counter-culture wave of the 1960s one group of activists, now all but forgotten, repeatedly rose to national prominence for their technique of combining street theatre and protest to create inventive, darkly comic and politically charged stunts. The Yippies melting pot of ’60s youth culture, Marxist political theory, dramatic flair and savvy media awareness was the prefect recipe an explosive relationship with authorities of all kinds and mainstream America. The two most prominent Yippie figures, Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, even established themselves as household names for a time.\n\nTheir story sits within the world of Woodstock, the Civil Rights and anti-war movement, and the fierce clashes between the establishment and youth protest and counter-culture of the 1960s. The desired audience for their political theatre was working class and poor American people they felt needed to see these issues like racial inequality and the war as symptomatic of deep structural problems in American society, best solved through a radical break with tradition to find new solutions. In many ways they were totally exemplary of their co-activists, but their solutions were loud and innovative.\n\nJerry and Abbie were both Jewish and a little older than most of the kids that made up the hippie generation. In his autobiography, Abbie attributed developing a political consciousness to his parents indecisiveness on fully assimilating versus maintaining their Jewish culture and traditions,\n\nHaving opted for life in mainstream America it became very difficult, even hypocritical for them to try to push any strict code of tradition down our throats.\n\nBoth Abbie and Jerry were raised with an intrinsic and personal understanding of political systems gone deeply wrong, and this coloured their relationship with any authority they saw as unjust. Abbie wrote in his autobiography,\n\nDeep down I’m sure we felt our parents’ generation was a bunch of cop outs. Six million dead and except for the Warsaw ghetto hardly a bullet fired in resistance.\n\nBoth were prominent full-time activists totally dedicated to the anti-war and civil rights movement. Both were very pro-drugs. Jerry had been a successful journalist in Cincinnati who radicalised gradually. His final break with working within the system came when he lost a campaign to become a mayoral candidate for Berkeley where he had been established as a key leader in the anti-war activist scene for several years. His campaign had called for free heroin for addicts and community control of a disarmed police force. He felt the compromises necessary to work within the system had alienated him from his fellow activists.\n\nJerry’s key player status within the movement had been cinched by his original, visual and media minded protests. When a top US General drove through Berkeley, Jerry threw a pint of blood on his car. To draw attention to napalm bombs being manufactured in near Berkeley, he and his fellow activists bought a small truck which they painted gunmetal grey and sprayed in bright yellow letters with “Danger, Napalm Bombs Ahead”. The truck followed the napalm delivery vehicles around California, making sure people in the community saw what was happening and infuriating officials. His techniques gained a huge amount of media attention in contrast to the bread and butter of political protest, rallies, which he felt were not TV-friendly.\n\nAbbie was rebellious from early, as a teenage greaser, and had similarly tried the system and found it not to his liking. He was a psychology major from University of California who had left his wife and mediocre career as a salesman to become more involved in the civil rights movement. While Jerry was moving to the forefront of the Berkeley anti-war movement, Abbie rose in similar directions within the New York civil rights scene.\n\nWhen white members were asked to leave the civil rights group Abbie worked for, he was upset and angry. A faction of black members felt that blacks needed to develop their own solutions and power structures separately. Abbie disagreed, he felt that politics should be conducted along class lines, not racially. But he recognised that perhaps he should work radicalising among his own community: the hippies of New York’s Lower East Side.\n\nWhile their gradual development into full time political activists had differed, once reached Jerry and Abbie’s ideologies closely aligned. Both felt the Vietnam War was but a symptom of an imperialist culture and the power of the military industrial complex within high circles of American political leadership. Both felt revolutionary changes were needed in the way Americans were taught by the mainstream media to think and live. Both saw clearly through their activist activities that the disaffection and high level of political awareness in American youth culture could and was being successfully directed at established power. Both despised the mainstream media and felt that more needed to be done to reach people who’s only view of the world was created through their exposure to its messages. Both believed drugs should be legalised and were strong promoters of smoking weed and taking LSD.\n\nTheir common problem was that they felt the existing movement was not reaching enough people. They needed the kind of reach that only the mainstream media had. They needed to somehow get the media to play their game and promote the hippie anti-war civil rights world view.\n\nWhen they met in 1967 in New York, they could not but became fast friends and partners in political activism. Earlier that year Jerry and a group of friends had visited the New York Stock Exchange and joined a tour. When the tour reached the balcony above the trading floor, they all ran to the railing and rained one dollar bills on the floor below. The stock pit turned into chaos and trading stopped for a full five minutes (a lot of time on a busy stock exchange) as stockbrokers ran about grabbing the bills. It was a perfect Yippie prank, a political metaphor made visual and real, and extremely well-covered in the national media despite there being no cameras present. At one of their first meetings, Jerry took Abbie to the stock exchange which had since installed bullet-proof screens on the balcony to prevent a repeat. Jerry and Abbie went onto the balcony and gleefully burned paper money to the horror and dismay of onlookers on the trading floor.\n\nJerry and Abbie were to next work together on a march on the Pentagon to protest the war. They strongly agreed it should included elements of their new guerrilla theatre. They decided to turn the protest into a sort of comic ritual exorcism, with the liberating message of hippie culture verses the ‘dark spirit’ of the military machine. The idea was popular and at the protest supporters handed out crazy costumes and witches hats to bemused and intrigued participants. They chanted, sang religious-sounding songs, announced and conducted a ritual to attempt to levitate the Pentagon three hundred feet in the air claiming it would cause the evil spirits to be shook out.\n\nThe media lapped it all up. The ‘levitation’ gained far greater media coverage than the protest itself would have. In turn the media had to at least mention or explain the protest. The event help to inform their theories on effective action. They realised they were onto something.\n\nBreaking away from their existing movement affiliations, they pooled their established contacts to form a core group of hardcore activists. Abbie, inspired by the unorthodox protest methods Jerry had been using in Berkeley, explained their solution at the founding Yippie meeting in New York on New Year’s Eve 1967. He argued that form letters, telephone calls and protests with signs made bad TV and had only got activists so far. To reach more people they needed to use Jerry’s street theatre that didn’t directly say “end the war” or “fight poverty” but instead got mass media attention through its weirdness, absurdity and colourfulness. The lack of spelled out meanings would make people curious and they would have to figure things out for themselves, which would be the beginning of seeing the world differently. Abbie called this creating a “blank space” in the media.\n\nHe argued young people didn’t want to listen to leaders, so they had to create a situation where people would participate and thus become their own leaders. He was sure that such “blank spaces” as the levitation would inspire people. Jerry and everyone else present agreed.\n\nThe name Yippie was coined by fellow Yippie founder Paul Krassner, publisher and editor of counter-culture magazine The Realist, who felt it combined an element of hippie and joyous celebration. Later they backronym’d and decided the YIP stood for Youth International Party. They also designed a flag:\n\nThe Yippies and the media were drawn to each other with all the relentless perversity of moths to flames. The Yippies decided to run a pig, they named Pegasus, as a presidential candidate for YIP. A later 1976 Yippie campaign performed a similar stunt, running nobody as their presidential candidate on the campaign slogan “Nobody’s Perfect”.\n\nJerry and Abbie were subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) to explain themselves twice. They treated the proceedings as joke and used every opportunity to mock the committee in visual Yippie style. Jerry came to a session dressed as an American Revolutionary War solider and passed out copies of the Declaration of Independence, dressed as Santa Claus carrying a fake gun and dressed as a Viet Cong solider. He spent the proceedings blowing gum bubbles and giving Nazi salutes to the infuriated committee. At one point Abbie came dressed in an American flag and Jerry in a Viet Cong flag. Abbie was arrested (it was seen as desecration to wear the US flag as a shirt, how times have changed!), while Jerry taunted the police as communists for failing to arrest him also.\n\nA major Yippie protest was designed to coincide with the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The DNC was seen as a rubber stamp for the nomination of pro-war candidate Hubert Humphrey, who was about to win though unpledged delegates despite not having competed during the primaries. And this despite 80% of Democrat voters picking one of the anti-war presidential candidates.\n\nThe Yippies decided to hold an event called The Festival of Life to coincide with and to protest the DNC. The city of Chicago brought in a huge number of extra police, shutting down parts of the city to separate the protesters and the convention. The event became notorious when a series of altercations between protesters and police over several days lead to the police rushing a crowd of around 15,000 non-violent protesters and attacking them with batons, all right in front of TV cameras. A government commissioned report into the incident laid the blame at the feet of the City of Chicago and the Police Department, calling the event a ‘police riot’.\n\nIn the aftermath of the protests Jerry, Abbie and six other men were charged by a federal grand jury with conspiracy to incite a riot and other charges. The main charge, conspiring to incite a riot, was part of new legislation passed in 1968 that made it a federal crime to cross state lines with the intent of starting a riot. It was a law specifically aimed at curbing protest. Abbie and Jerry, who said they were happy to go to prison for their beliefs and to fight for what they saw as a right to legitimate protest, were not much bothered by the charges. They used the whole thing as an opportunity to put the Vietnam War on trial through theatrical protest and stunts which caught national attention. The trial made both Abbie and Jerry famous, and between trial dates they flew around the US on speaking tours to raise money. Jerry later wrote that he also got really blazed:\n\nI got stoned a lot for the trial because it was such complete theater – a front-row seat to history – and marijuana intensifies every experience.”\n\nAt around this time, Jerry was on TV for this pretty funny short interview which I highly recommend watching.\n\nThe trial was a massive fiasco for the government. Five of the eight were convicted, but all charges were overturned on appeal. The only prison time served was for contempt of court, as the infuriated judge had sentenced all 8 defendants and their lawyers to 2 – 4 years for contempt. Even this was overturned and the judges behaviour was found to be illegal. In particular, he had refused to allow one defendant to defend himself, and then tied him to his chair and gagged him when he would not stop protesting loudly the illegality of this decision.\n\nThe trial and the 1968 riots are covered in a great documentary called Chicago 10 (since 8 defendants + their two lawyers were ultimately charged) which can be found online. As only transcripts remain of the trial, the trial sequences are animated which makes for a really visually interesting presentation style.\n\nSome notable Yippie actions over the next few years:\n\nrunning a candidate for mayor of Vancouver in 1970 with her campaign promising to repeal every law, including the law of gravity so everyone can get high.\n\nA Yippie running for sheriff of Alameda County, challenging the incumbent sheriff to a high-noon duel and receiving 65,000 votes.\n\nDetroit Yippies went to city hall and applied for a permit to blow up the General Motors building in 1970. When the permit was predictably denied, the Yippies said that it just goes to show you can’t work within the system to change the system.\n\nHolding ‘smoke-ins’ where large crowds would gather and openly smoke weed, defying the authorities to arrest all of them.\n\n‘Pieing’: throwing pies at political figures.\n\nBut, this was the zenith of Abbie and Jerry’s careers as leading protesters, pranksters and public figures. It’s no coincidence that the late ’60/early ’70s was also the zenith for protest in the US. The Civil Rights movement began to falter, having gained much ground. The anti-war movement remained prominent until the end of the war in 1975. But the “let’s build a new world” slightly vague movement Jerry and Abbie had wanted the Yippies to inspire never eventuated. The Yippies became increasingly obscure as membership faded away, though small groups still exist.\n\nAbbie remained an major activist and protester and wrote several books. He went into hiding for a period after being charged with dealing cocaine, which he claimed was planted. In 1980, he turned himself in and served only a year. He returned to prominence in the 1980s as he was involved in another protest that lead to a trial which he used as an opportunity to lay out the case that the CIA was an organisation undertaking illegal activities (funding the Contras). He was acquitted. He took his own life in 1989, after a long struggle with bipolar disorder and a recent switch in medication which may have contributed.\n\nJerry left politics in 1974 and became, bizarrely, an extremely wealthy stockbroker. When questioned about the apparent incongruity, he argued (I would say, since he was a stockbroker, unconvincingly) that he had found he could effect more change from the inside. He was killed when struck by a car in 1994, while jaywalking. Irritatingly articles always cite this as evidence of him possessing a rebellious streak to the end, as though jaywalking is somehow on the light end of a spectrum that includes throwing blood on a General or being willing to go to prison for your beliefs.\n\nWith hindsight, the Yippies as a movement and Jerry and Abbie as individuals appear flawed. The Yippie movement remained ideologically unfocused, they contained radical strains of anarchism, Marxism and surrealism without resolving the contradictions. Yet there are elements that merit attention, if only for their sheer oddness and highly successful strategy of media engagement. Their visual, TV savvy forms of protest and their mentality of protest as metaphor/theatrical performance is something that feels relevant today. A modern example of this technique used effectively would be The Yes Men who prank corporate culture and ‘ethics’. That the Yippies’ messages were most always relentlessly positive, presenting (generally absurdist) alternatives to implicitly critique current solutions, is also interesting."
