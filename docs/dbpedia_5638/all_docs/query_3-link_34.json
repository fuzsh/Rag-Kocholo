        "text": "From #BlackLivesMatter to #MeToo, from the Women’s March on Washington to the March for Our Lives following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, a new generation of activists has taken the world by storm, with global media networks as their megaphones. The goal of this module is to explore, from the perspectives of multiple disciplines and fields of study, how contemporary activists harness a diverse range of media tools and platforms for social change. We will define “media” broadly, and consider not only the relationship between movements and mainstream news media, but also social media, street protests, DIY print media projects, and more. While digital media have altered the shape and reach of activism, we will trace important historical continuities between today’s social movements and the movements of the past. Most importantly, we will keep in mind that while emerging media technologies have created new opportunities for today’s movements, these platforms have also created new risks and challenges for activists. Ultimately, through independent readings and in-class activities, we will explore how social change emerges from the resilience and creativity of activist media-makers.\n\nIn lieu of an abstract, here is the paper&#39;s first paragraph: In Tom Wolfe’s 1968 book The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Wolfe follows author Ken Kesey and his group the Merry Pranksters as they develop as an American counterculture in the mid to late 1960’s. In a key moment of the book, Kesey is asked to participate and give a speech at an anti-Vietnam War rally at Berkeley in 1965. He shows up, but instead of joining the political movement he shuns it, saying, “you know, you’re not gonna stop this war with this rally, by marching... That’s what they do... They hold rallies and they march... Ten thousand years, and this is the game they play to do it... holding rallies and having marches... and that’s the same game you’re playing... their game” [italics in the original] (Wolfe 222). Kesey rose to prominence after the publication of his first novel as the spiritual chief and leader of the Merry Pranksters and one of the early leading voices of the subsequent “hippie generation.” K..."
