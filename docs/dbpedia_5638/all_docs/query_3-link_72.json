        "text": "Like those in SDS who supported the Palestinians, the Yippies discussed and wrote about their feelings toward the Arab-Israeli conflict but never actualized them. Jim Retherford, who ghostwrote Rubin's best-selling book, Do It!: Scenarios of the Revolution, recalled that the issue was not as “straight-forward” as Vietnam and thus did not prompt them to demonstrate or carry out other concrete actions in support of the Palestinian struggle.37 John Sinclair and Lawrence “Pun” Plamondon, two leaders of the White Panther Party (WPP), a radical group allied with the Yippies, similarly sided with the Palestinians, but like much of the white New Left, never acted on it. Plamondon did visit the Fatah office in Algeria in 1970, but years later, he expressed the feeling of many New Leftists when he stated that “the Middle East was not a significant focus of my or other WPP members' attention. The war in Vietnam and the threat of U.S. fascism was my/our primary focus.”38\n\nThe Black Panthers Project the Guerrilla Image\n\nAt the time that Jewish and other white New Leftists in SDS, the Yippies, and the WPP grappled with the Arab-Israeli conflict in the late 1960s, doing little more than arguing about which side to support, the BPP deepened earlier Black Power support for the Palestinians demonstrated by Malcolm and SNCC. Two southern transplants to Oakland, California, Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, formed the BPP in October 1966 as an armed force to protect Oakland's black citizens from police violence. The group soon developed a wider left-wing, anti-imperialist ideology that spoke of revolution at home in the United States and support for Third World liberation struggles abroad.39 This included the Palestinians. Starting in October 1968, the BPP newspaper, the Black Panther, began running articles hailing the Palestinian struggle and the guerrilla group Fatah, in particular. The following month, a piece in the paper summed up the party's stance: “Israel IS because Palestine's right to be was canceled.”40\n\nIn 1969, as the New Left was at its peak, the number of BPP public statements of support for the Palestinians increased significantly. In fact, the party published thirty-three articles supporting the Arabs or attacking Israel in the forty-three issues of the Black Panther that came out between 1 June 1969 and 28 March 1970.41 Newton and Seale, as well as BPP chief-of-staff David Hilliard and Field Marshall Donald “D. C.” Cox, made clear that the Palestinian struggle mirrored that of U.S. blacks and that both struggles were part of a wider global conflict with imperialism. So did BPP minister of education Raymond “Masai” Hewitt, who stated in August 1969, “We recognize that our oppression takes different forms—Zionism in Palestine and fascism here in America—but the cause is the same: it's U.S. imperialism.”42 Palestinians agreed. A few months later, the Black Panther quoted PLO chair Yasir Arafat: “The Palestinian Liberation Movement considers itself a part of the people's struggle against international imperialism. We are fighting the same enemy. The mask may differ, but the face remains the same.”43 The party followed this up with an article titled “Zionism (Kosher Nationalism) + Imperialism = Fascism” that announced “victory to the people's struggle of Palestine!” and proclaimed that “the Zionist fascist state of Israel is a puppet and lackey of the imperialists and must be smashed.”44\n\nA significant fact contributing to the BPP's embrace of the Palestinians in 1969 was the fact that their minister of information, Eldridge Cleaver, took up residence in Algiers that June while on the run from U.S. law enforcement. Along with his wife, Kathleen Neal Cleaver, and several others, Cleaver openly associated with Fatah cadres in the city. He opened the Afro-American Information Center near Fatah's offices in July 1969 and publicly declared that Israel was a “puppet and pawn” of the United States and that “al-Fatah will win”—all with a Fatah figure standing by his side. He also delivered a speech at the nearby Fatah office45 and later met Arafat in the city that December. The following year, Algerian authorities officially designated the BPP a liberation movement and allowed the Panthers to open the International Section of the Black Panther Party in September 1970 in a villa formerly occupied by the National Liberation Front in Vietnam (Viet Cong). The international section of the party thereafter continued to express both its support for the Palestinians and the BPP's belief in the commonality of their struggle. “The struggle of the Palestinian people for their freedom and liberation from US imperialism and its lackeys is also our struggle. We recognize that if the Palestinian people cannot get their freedom and liberation neither can we,” declared a statement issued in September 1970.46\n\nIn a sign of the dissension within the New Left about the Arab-Israeli conflict, the BPP received criticism from some white comrades over its strident attacks on Israel and bristled in response. Hewitt noted in August 1969 that “the white left gets uptight because we dig Al Fatah” and pointed out that the BPP was dedicated to armed revolution, not discussions, books, or mere symbols of radical culture. “Culture is manifested in AK-47s,” he argued, and “the most beautiful thing I saw at the [1969] Algerian conference was the symbol of Al Fatah—the dove of peace perched on the balance point of an AK-47.”47 At about the same time, Hilliard attacked what he called “little bourgeois snotty nose motherfucking S.D.S.'s,” and complained that “we don't see S.D.S. as being so revolutionary. … S.D.S. had better get their politics straight.” For his part Seale asserted, “We want to make it clear to all the S.D.S.'s … that we have a mind of our own, and yes we support Al-Fath [sic] in the struggle. And that we make our decisions and we support who we want to support, and that we're here to make revolution.”48\n\nConflicts on Campus Further Divide the New Left\n\nDivisiveness over the conflict not only led some in the white New Left to criticize the BPP but also characterized student activism on college campuses. Berkeley was a highly politicized campus in the late 1960s that was illustrative of students' conflicted attitudes toward the Arab-Israeli conflict. Even before the June War erupted, some Arab students held a demonstration at Berkeley's iconic Sproul Plaza on 16 May 1967 and distributed a leaflet titled “Zionism, Western Imperialism, and the Liberation of Palestine.” Just days later, pro-Israeli socialists staged a counter demonstration on 25 May. In October, a group called the Friends of the Tri-Continental Progressive Students held a press conference in Berkeley at which it said it would commence efforts to present the Arab perspective to the campus. The group also issued a pamphlet declaring that the Palestinians and the Viet Cong had declared their mutual support, and therefore the U.S. antiwar movement should “draw the parallel” between the two movements.49 In May 1969, Berkeley joined with over thirty other campuses to host a “Palestine Week,” followed by another pro-Palestinian event in October 1970 in the wake of the Jordanian army's attack on Palestinian forces, an event known to Palestinians as Black September.\n\nStill, the Arab-Israeli conflict continued to divide student activists at Berkeley. As a result, noteworthy Berkeley radicals Mario Savio and Michael Lerner formed the Committee for a Progressive Middle East in March 1969 to bridge the gap between strongly pro-Israeli and pro-Palestinian students and, they hoped in the process, to save the Left from destroying itself over the issue. Lerner later recalled that while the “Left was totally anti-Israel … the discourse that was prominent in the Jewish world was [also] deeply distorted.”50 Their committee issued a statement in the spring of 1969 that urged both Israel and the Palestinians to stop fighting each other and instead focus on the real enemy in the Middle East, capitalist imperialism. It also called on Fatah to halt guerrilla attacks against Israel and to fight the Arab world's internal enemies instead, and also affirmed Israel's right to exist.51\n\nColumbia University was similarly famous for student activism in the 1960s, and it too witnessed sometimes tumultuous campus events related to the Middle East. A gathering held on 18 April 1969 titled “Teach-In on the Middle East: Arab Liberation vs. Imperialism-Zionism” descended into chaos when fistfights broke out between pro- and anti-Israeli students in the audience.52 Of note was the fact that members of the Organization of Arab Students (OAS) worked with U.S. leftists to organize the event.53 A debate in 1970 went more peacefully and featured two Jewish SDS students arguing for replacing a Zionist Israel with a secular democratic state, as called for by the PLO. Debating them was another Jewish student from a Zionist group on campus who supported Palestinian nationalism but still upheld Zionism.54 However, October 1970 witnessed a return to violence on campus when protestors demonstrating against an Israeli army officer who was visiting Columbia were attacked by militants from the Jewish Defense League, prompting the New York police to intervene.55\n\nPro-Palestinian actions were held on many other campuses across the country. A teach-in on “The Arab Liberation Struggle and Its Relationship to Zionist Israel” was held at Wayne State University in February 1969, followed by an OAS-sponsored symposium titled “Palestine, the Arabs, and Zionism” in February 1970. Like at Berkeley, Palestine Week in May 1969 was celebrated at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, Harvard, New York University, the University of Pennsylvania, the State University of New York at Buffalo, the George Washington University, the University of Chicago, and several dozen other schools. In 1970, the University of Texas at Austin staged Arab Refugees Week, while Antioch College witnessed a gathering called The Middle East Crisis, Israel, and the Palestinian Revolution. A teach-in on the Palestinians was also held at Emory University in Atlanta that same year. Beyond special events, students also began forming groups to rally support for the Palestinians. The OAS once again worked with U.S. students to form the Palestine Solidarity Coalition at Indiana University in Bloomington, and Arab students at the George Washington University set up the Palestine Solidarity Committee and a “Palestine House” in 1970. At the University of Virginia, a group of U.S. and international students formed the American Friends of Free Palestine in April 1970, and that summer students at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee founded a group called Students for Peace and Justice in the Middle East.\n\nSuch pro-Palestinian campus activities prompted a strongly pro-Israeli response. At Northwestern, graduate student Jack Nusan Porter, who had been involved with SDS, formed the Jewish Student Movement in 1968. “We will not identify with or join with any groups that argue for the destruction of the State of Israel,” he declared.56 In February 1969, Michael J. Rosenberg and other Jewish leftists met at the State University of New York at Albany to form a militant Jewish organization on campus called Am Yisrael as a direct response to the anti-Israeli actions of groups on campus. Rosenberg wrote in 1971, “In dealing with those who oppose Israel we are not reasonable and we are not rational. Nor should we be.” In shoring up Am Yisrael's left-wing credentials, he noted, “We are radicals. We actively oppose the war in Viet Nam. We support the black liberation movement as we endorse all genuine movements of liberation. And thus, first and foremost, we support our [Jews'] own.”57\n\nThese groups heralded the growth of a large number and wide variety of Jewish student organizations dedicated to defending Israel on campus. A notable feature of this backlash was the Radical Zionist Movement, which sought to combine New Left values with support for Israel. One example of this movement was the Jewish Liberation Project, formed in New York City in July 1968. The organization saw itself as Zionist and socialist, and while it supported Palestinian aspirations, it sought to “communicate a positive position on Israel to the American Left.”58 Another group, the Radical Zionist Alliance, was originally formed as a coalition of like-minded, left-wing, pro-Israeli Jewish organizations. It emerged from a conference held in Palmer, Massachusetts, in February 1970 and also supported “the national rights of the Jews and Palestinian Arabs.” It urged its members to become involved in radical actions both at home and, eventually, in Israel. It boasted the slogan “Be a Revolutionary in Zion, and a Zionist in the Revolution.”59\n\nDivisions within Left-Wing Publications\n\nThis dissension within the New Left also manifested itself in left-wing political journals, and once again often pitted Jew against Jew. One of the most significant of these in the 1960s was the National Guardian. Conscious of the rising tensions in the Middle East in the spring of 1967, it published two stories on the eve of the June War in an effort to be evenhanded. One was written by Abdallah Schleifer, a U.S. pro-Palestinian and Jewish convert to Islam living in East Jerusalem, while the other was by socialist Zionist journalist Richard Yaffe. As the war came to an end one week later, National Guardian laid out its own thoughts about the Israeli victory in a less even-handed way. The editors wrote that Israel was in alliance with imperialism in its struggle against the Arabs. The piece also decried Israel's Law of Return for allowing only Jews to immigrate to Israel, but not Palestinian refugees displaced since 1948.60\n\nIrving Beinin was a major figure at the National Guardian and played an important role in its editorial stance on the Middle East thereafter. A Jew and a former Trotskyist with a number of Zionist relatives who had helped establish Jewish settlements in Israel, he criticized Israel in a piece written after the war, noting in the late spring of 1967 that the country was faced with two choices: peace with the Arabs at any cost, or, as it ultimately chose, “escalation of the nationalist, anti-Arab sentiment, glorification of the Jewish military and reliance on might to establish Jewish hegemony.” He argued that Israel's rejection of cooperation with the Arabs left alliance with U.S. and British imperialism as its only option.61 Beinin's stance engendered a fierce response. In the first few weeks after the war, the letters-to-the-editor section of the National Guardian exploded with a lively exchange of letters about the conflict from the journal's readers. It was clearly the first time some of them had seen such strong opinions about Israel since the war had ended, and like those leftists who were aghast at New Left criticisms of Israel, they were not happy. According to Beinin, a “majority” of the letters he received criticized the newspaper's coverage and editorial stance on the June War.62\n\nJust after the 1967 war broke out, another venerable left-wing journal reflected the Left's conflicted thinking about the Arab-Israeli conflict by publishing rival editorials for only the third time in its history. Monthly Review's longtime, cofounding editors, Paul Sweezy and Leo Huberman, offered readers their own respective and divergent assessments of the violence in the journal's October 1967 issue. Huberman was a Marxist Jew who maintained warm feelings toward Israel. He wrote that the main enemy of the Arab masses was “not Israel, but their own feudal, reactionary, bureaucratic governments which exploit them, and Western imperialism which robs them of their wealth.” A true Arab liberation struggle therefore would go after the master, the West, and not the lackey, Israel.63 Sweezy, by contrast, took a much tougher stance against Israel. He wrote that “[Israel's] very existence as a colonizing state rests on the expropriation of lands from the Palestinian Arabs, and in keeping with its Zionist exclusionary character it practices systematic, principled discrimination against all Arabs. … Arab hostility to Israel is of the same kind and as natural as black hostility to white settler states in Africa.”64\n\nLike other left-wing publications read by the New Left, Ramparts magazine covered the 1967 war and its implications soon after hostilities ended, and initially tread carefully. Its July 1967 issue carried several signed articles discussing the war and the wider Arab-Israeli conflict from various perspectives. The writers I. F. Stone and Paul Jacobs, both Jewish, called for Israel to realize that it could never secure ultimate peace by military force. In marked contrast, the Jewish academics Michael Walzer and Martin Peretz offered a full-throated defense of Israel against the growing chorus of left-wing criticism that emerged after the 1967 war. Ramparts's editors contributed an editorial, as well, lamenting the fact that too many Americans, including liberals, were exulting in Israeli triumphalism. They also noted, “The hallowed memory of Jewish lives taken by the Nazis is not served by continuing the plight of the Arab refugees.” On the other hand, the editorial pointed out that the Arab-Israeli issue transcended the simplistic idea floated by some leftists that the conflict was one pitting Arab socialism against Israel, the tool of Western imperialism.65\n\n* * * * *\n\nDespite its unanimity on so many issues, the New Left suffered from deep divisions about whether to support Israel or the Palestinians. These fissures stemmed from differing notions about imperialism and left-wing internationalism that were sometimes superheated by ethnic identity issues. Black leftists were motivated to champion the Palestinians as a result of their transnational anti-imperialism. Theirs was a worldview based on a racialized understanding of imperialism and colonialism, and supporting the Palestinians as a kindred people of color suffering from U.S.-Israeli domination came easily to them. By contrast, the white New Left, with its disproportionate number of Jews, was split between those who felt similarly to their black comrades and those whose Jewish identity seemed to complicate their understanding of Israel as a colonial/imperialist power. These disagreements not only led to a virtual Jewish civil war on the Left but also contributed to further straining of black-Jewish relations, which were already tense.\n\nThe New Left was essentially gone by the end of 1973. Various factors account for this: U.S. troops had left Vietnam, military conscription had ended, eighteen-year-olds could vote, and black militants suffered from the might of state repression. On top of this, the intra-Left fissures over the Arab-Israeli conflict also helped weaken the Left as some, notably Jewish Social Democrats, defected from the Left and moved rightward, spurring the growth of neoconservatism. At the same time that five decades of retrospection reveals how the New Left's lack of unity on the Arab-Israeli conflict hurt it at the time, it is instructive to note how much support for the Palestinians has grown among progressive Americans, notably young (and Jewish) ones, in the decades since. Of particular note has been the transnational and intersectional solidarity with Palestinians displayed by black Americans in the twenty-first century. Among other actions, in August 2015 over eleven hundred persons signed the 2015 Black Solidarity Statement with Palestine,66 and in August 2016 the Movement for Black Lives issued a platform that spoke of U.S. complicity with the “genocide” befalling the Palestinian people.67 Nor are sympathy with the Palestinians and criticism of Israel simply restricted to African Americans. A poll conducted by the Pew Research Center in April 2019 revealed that just 27 percent of Americans under the age of thirty hold a favorable view of the Israeli government,68 and a Pew poll from 2018 showed that the number of self-described liberal Democrats who sympathized with the Palestinians was nearly twice the number of those in the Democratic Party who were sympathetic to Israel.69 While some liberal-to-left-wing Americans still balk at criticizing Israel, and in turn are accused of being “PEP” (progressive except for Palestine), events in the Middle East in recent decades truly have escalated popular U.S. support for the Palestinians, building on support first articulated forcefully by leftists long ago in the 1960s."
