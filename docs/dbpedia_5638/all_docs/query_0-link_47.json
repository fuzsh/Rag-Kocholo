        "text": "MEIR KAHANE AND SOVIET JEWRY\n\nIn April 1964, a young British emigre to the US named Yaakov Birnbaum and his colleague Glenn Richter gathered a small group of Jewish students, mostly from Yeshiva University, to discuss what to do about Jewish dissidents stuck in the Soviet Union.16 The group was in some way a response to the American Jewish [End Page 82] Conference on Soviet Jewry (AJCSJ) that was established in Washington, DC, at the same time. The Soviet Jewry organization, later to become known as the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry (SSSJ), was officially founded soon afterward on the Columbia University campus and quickly spread to other locales.17 Only four days after its founding, the SSSJ managed to organize a May Day protest that brought over 1,000 people to the Soviet Mission in New York City. Its continuing commitment to street protest is also clear from the \"Jericho March\" in Manhattan in April 1965 where demonstrators with Torah scrolls and blowing shofars encircled the Soviet Mission.18 In the early years of the Soviet Jewry movement, Birnbaum devoted his resources to widening its student base and began to explore strategies to lobby the US government to intervene on behalf of Soviet Jewish dissidents. With the rise of radicalism on college campuses more generally, however, SSSJ, initially limited to traditional Jews, began to gain more popularity among Jews aligned with the New Left, sometimes referred to as \"New Jews.\"19\n\nIn many ways, the movement for Soviet Jewry was a late instantiation of the Cold War: Jews in the Soviet Union, often living under very difficult conditions, were summarily denied requests for emigration, taking on the status of \"refuseniks.\" By the early 1960s, Jews in the Diaspora, especially in the US and Israel, began to advocate for these Jews, in the US to the US government, and in Israel through international channels. The movement was dedicated to diplomacy, non-violent protests, and advocacy for the sake of fairness and justice. As Shaul Kelner notes:\n\nthe AJCSJ was guided by an instrumentally rational, strategic calculus that weighed the costs and benefits of calling for emigration rights, not by a value-rational commitment to enacting biblical narrative. In 1967, the AJCSJ leadership believed that the political environment militated against calling for emigration rights.20\n\nFor the most part, this movement remained quite insular and did not attract the attention of a wider society that had many more pressing issues to deal with. But Soviet Jewry did become a significant issue for American Jews, especially on college campuses and in synagogues. [End Page 83]\n\nKahane's energies were focused on translating what he believed were Jewish interests to the public sphere to respond to matters that may have had a significant impact on the lives of Jews in the US, spiritually and physically. In this sense, and perhaps in this sense only, one could view Kahane as quite in line with the early work of the Lubavitcher rebbe, Menachem Mendel Schneerson (1902–1994), who immigrated to New York during the Second World War and built a large Hasidic movement that was devoted to spreading Judaism to American Jews and the Noahide Laws to non-Jews.\n\nSchneerson, whose interests may have been more spiritual than Kahane's, also believed deeply in the US, which he called a \"medina shel hesed [a country of kindness]\" and believed in the right, and need, of Jews to assert their Jewishness in the public sphere, as is evident in his charge to erect a Hanukkah Menorah in Liberty Bell Park in Philadelphia in 1974.21 Schneerson supported Jerry Fallwell's call for a moment of silence in public schools and also limited certain church-state restriction of parochial schools. And more than most Hasidic masters in the US, Schneerson took a strong interest in Soviet Jewry and directed organizational resources toward aiding them as best he could even in the 1950s, although he strongly opposed Kahane's program, rejecting even non-violent protest. Schneerson even lobbied unsuccessfully to cancel the \"Solidarity Sunday\" rally for Soviet Jewry in Washington, DC, in December 1987. Schneerson, who grew up in Russia and whose movement was founded in Belarus, was a firm believer in clandestine activities as the best route to help Soviet Jews.22\n\nA subway ride away from upper Manhattan, in the Jewish enclave of Flatbush, Kahane, a young Orthodox rabbi who had been a sportswriter for a Brooklyn daily and served as a rabbi in numerous small synagogues, became radicalized in the emerging counterculture that witnessed the rise of the anti-war movement and the Black Power movement in 1966. In his early thirties, he appeared to be heading for a second-tier rabbinic career, serving a number of small pulpits in Queens and Brooklyn.23 But he was a fiery ideologue, raised in a family with [End Page 84] strong, militant, and reactionary views on Zionism, and was an aspiring opinion journalist with an inflated sense of self.24 In the same year Birnbaum and Richter founded their organization uptown, Kahane penned a short essay in the Brooklyn weekly, The Jewish Press (a paper he eventually edited), on May 22, 1964, called \"To Save Soviet Jewry.\" In this short and pungent piece, Kahane's voice rang more strident than Birnbaum and Richter. He blamed the US, the complacency of the US Jewish community, and warned of serious consequences if Soviet Jewry was not addressed. \"Save Soviet Jewry\" was a shot across the bow. But few heard it.\n\nNothing much came of Kahane's short essay. The Soviet Jewry movement struggled along, often lost in the plethora of more pressing national issues, and Kahane rarely wrote about it again for the next five years. In May 1968, responding to the antisemitism that arose from the New York City Ocean Hill-Brownsville public school strike, Kahane founded the JDL, a ragtag group of Jewish youth who patrolled the streets of the urban north (New York, Boston, Philadelphia) fending off Black and Puerto Rican violence against mostly elderly Jews in what were then called \"frontier neighborhoods.\" The JDL made regional and then national news for its confrontations with groups like the Black Panthers and the Young Lords, or their local affiliates, causing havoc in an already destabilized racial situation.25 [End Page 85]\n\nAnd then, sometime in late December of 1969, Meir Kahane walked into the JDL office at 156 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan and announced that the JDL was now going to be focused on Soviet Jewry. It came as a big surprise to those present because, aside from the short essay Kahane published in May 1964, Kahane did not seem overly engaged with that issue. The JDL's official turn to Soviet Jewry began on December 29, 1969, when JDLers struck the offices of the TASS (Soviet press agency), Intourist, and Aeroflot. On December 30, JDL caused a riot at the Soviet Mission in Manhattan by breaking through police barriers to protest in front of the mission instead of a block away as the Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry had been doing on order of the NYPD. With Kahane's involvement, the movement for Soviet Jewry now took on the mantel of militancy.\n\nKahane was, in some ways, a reactionary counter-culturalist against the complacency and assimilationism of US Jewish liberalism. Shlomo Russ, in his unpublished 1991 dissertation on the JDL entitled \"Zionist Hooligans,\" argued that Kahane switched gears because he saw that the race wars were abating and needed a new cause. Russ posits that it was Kahane's opportunism and not his ideology that drove him to Soviet Jewry. Gal Beckerman, in his book on Soviet Jewry, When They Come for Us, We'll Be Gone, has another theory. He recounts a conversation between Kahane and right-wing Knesset member Geulah Cohen when she was visiting the US. Beckerman writes, \"In a cluttered dirty office the JDL called home, Geulah Cohen had one question for Kahane, 'Why are you wasting time fighting the schvartzers [a Yiddish slur for Black people]?'\"26 She proposed that he turn his attention to Soviet Jewry.27 While not discounting either of these two possibilities, I want to suggest a third that speaks to Kahane's view of global shifts that included US Jewish liberalism, Israel, the Soviet Union, and the Chinese threat through the escalating war in Vietnam.\n\nTo understand Kahane and Soviet Jewry one must first understand the conceptual position he held regarding the dangers of communism, not only in the Soviet Union, but also, as important, in Vietnam, where the conflict was entering a critical phase in 1967. That year, Kahane published The Jewish Stake in Vietnam (under the pseudonym Michael King) with his friend Joseph Churba, a Syrian-American Jew Kahane had known since high school.28 In it, Kahane predicted that a loss in Vietnam would result in an increase in antisemitism, an assertion that seems speculative but not totally baseless. Kathleen Belew, in her [End Page 86] 2019 book, Bringing the War Home: The White Power Movement and Paramilitary America, argues that the present iteration of white nationalism and militarism rose in the wake of the US's humiliating loss in Southeast Asia.29 This included, as is often the case when racial conflict arises, a rise in antisemitism. Similarly, Eric Ward notes that antisemitism is lodged in the belly of the new American white nationalist racism. Ward argues that white nationalists claim that Jews are behind Black success in part because they cannot fathom how Black people could have achieved such success on their own.30\n\nOn June 9, 1968, a month after the founding of the JDL, Kahane testified about communism and Soviet antisemitism before the congressional Committee on Un-American Activities. It is not clear why or how the House of Representatives asked him to testify, but it is likely because of Churba's connections.31 Kahane said that he had conducted \"a 15-year study of communism and Soviet anti-Semitism,\" although we have no evidence of such a study.\n\nWhen describing Kahane as an anti-communist, we must be careful about what we mean and about what communism meant to him. Here he mirrors in many ways the anti-communism that includes suspicion of Jews as communists. Kahane does not engage in economic theory or Marxian political analysis. His writings do not indicate he was proficient in, or concerned with, any Marxist thought, although he does refer to Marx's \"On the Jewish Question\" on occasion, though not in any way that indicates he read it carefully (such as in his 1972 Time To Go Home.)32 [End Page 87] For Kahane, communism mostly meant the abolition of religious and ethnic difference and, particularly, the totalitarianism of Soviet and Chinese regimes that limited emigration and individual expression. And, as important, communism also implied Arab nationalism in the form of its anti-Israel program, even though only some Arab movements were directly influenced by communism.33 For Kahane, communism equaled the erasure of human freedom, the subjugation of the individual to the collective, and the rejection of Zionism as a legitimate expression of Jewish self-determination, in spite of the fact that Zionism was in part founded on socialist principles, albeit ones that were largely limited to Jews.34 Kahane's anti-communism can also be viewed as an exercise in American patriotism to convince Americans that Jews were not communists.35\n\nFor Kahane, the rise of religion in the US political culture of the 1950s, with Billy Graham, Reinhold Neibuhr, and Eisenhower's \"religious renaissance,\" surely did not go unnoticed. In general, the Cold War gave religious denominations more respectability and helped move them to positions of power in US public life. Kahane certainly took advantage of this shift, presenting himself as an expert on matters of Jewish survival in communist countries and the dangers of communism for Jews. At the same time, he used religion as a vehicle for Jewish pride and identity for a young countercultural generation of US Jews who set their sights more on politics than religion. For example, he and Churba were able to obtain support from Cold War warriors Jay Lovestone and Irving Brown, former liberals who were then running the AFL-CIO's International Affairs Department connected to the CIA.36\n\nAmong Jews, the situation was a bit more complicated because of the traumatic aftermath of the Holocaust and the history of American Jewish fidelity to liberalism. Roosevelt was an American \"Jewish\" hero, and Jews also made up a [End Page 88] disproportionate percentage of members of the socialist and communist parties in the US in the first decades of the twentieth century.37 Jews had been accused of importing communism to the US by antisemitic Father Coughlin in his 1938 radio sermons, and, long after Coughlin had been discredited, the link between Jews and communism stayed with many US Americans through the Cold War. The Julius and Ethel Rosenberg trial in March 1951, together with the later prominence of Jewish socialists and radical leftists, activists such as Saul Alinsky, put Jews in a precarious position.38\n\nIn depicting communism as a special danger to Jews, Kahane's writings on Vietnam, his activism for Soviet Jewry, and his staunch reactionary Revisionist Zionist sensibilities served to counter suspicions about Jews in the US, speaking thus to the situation of Jews in the US no less than internationally.39 Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky, for example, was depicted as a hero in the US for democracy and freedom against tyranny and totalitarianism, and not only among Jews.40 Kahane stated in his congressional testimony that much of what he would say came from material published in a series of essays entitled \"Communism vs. Judaism\" published over a six-month period in The Jewish Press. But his emphasis in his testimony is somewhat different.\n\nTo Congress, he defined the JDL as an organization \"to defend the Jewish people against antisemitism and to defend this country against various extremist groups such as the Communists and the black nationalists.\"41 No mention is made of Soviet Jewry in his testimony, and more significantly, no mention is made of the Soviet Jewry movement. And while Israel is discussed, it is not a focus of his remarks.\n\nKahane was an ardent Zionist, and yet, from his congressional testimony, it seems his pro-Israel position is disconnected from his fight against the [End Page 89] Soviet-Chinese communist bloc. In fact, quite the opposite is true; as we will see, they are inextricably bound together. Kahane's views on Soviet Jewry were part of a larger geo-political conundrum with Israel at its center. And yet he knew that only the US had the leverage to move the Soviet Union on these issues. The Arab part of Kahane's communist triad, often overlooked, comes through in his book on Vietnam. The main target is Ahmad Shukeiri (1908–1980). A Palestinian nationalist, Shukeiri was the first chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from 1964 to 1967. After the Six-Day War, the PLO became more militant, and Shukeiri, more of a moderate, was viewed as largely ineffectual. He stepped down and was replaced by the young Yasser Arafat. But in 1966, when Kahane was writing The Jewish Stake in Vietnam, Shukeiri was still the figurehead of the newly formed PLO. Kahane's interest in Shukeiri in The Jewish Stake in Vietnam was that Shukeiri, who had studied at the American University in Beirut and the Jerusalem Law School and had a negative view of the West in general, decided to open ties with Beijing and Moscow and frame the PLO's position as similar to the struggle of the Viet Cong.42\n\nThe PLO alliance with these communist powers was not only theoretical. In June 1966, Cairo radio broadcast that the PLO had intended to send some of its men to Vietnam to help fight alongside the Viet Cong. Whether they actually did so or not I do not know. To be sure, during the Six-Day War, South Vietnamese premier Nguyen Cao Ky declared, \"I'm with Israel.\"43 And it was Shukeiri who brought Chou En-lai to the conclusion that the Arab struggle was \"an unholy trinity of U.S.A. imperialism, West German militarism, and Zionism.\"44 Ironically, Kahane made use of Chou's declaration to argue that Zionism in the global perspective was indeed a part of Western imperialism while internally it was a biblically inflected movement of Jewish supremacy in the land of Israel. Just as Shukeiri was trying to situate the Palestinian struggle as a struggle against Western imperialism, in the US, Kahane was advocating for support for Israel by arguing that Palestinian resistance was an arm of the communist threat. This was ironically all happening in the 1960s when Israel still largely viewed itself as a socialist country and Maki, the Israeli Communist Party, was still represented in the Israeli Parliament.\n\nIn terms of Vietnam, the conflict of the Viet Cong against the South Vietnamese army was a complex struggle that pitted communism in the north against democratic forces in the south. And its global reach certainly challenged [End Page 90] US administrations from Eisenhower, who coined the \"Domino Theory\" as a justification for the war, to Nixon, who opted for \"peace with honor.\" In the US, the anti-war movement was also gaining steam. New Left and radical activists such as Lee Webb and Gar Alperovitz had organized Vietnam Summer in 1967, mobilizing student protests in favor of a larger radical program.45 Martin Luther King, Jr., added his voice to the growing anti-war movement in his famous speech in Riverside Church in Manhattan on April 4, 1967, and, in October 1967, the biggest anti-war rally thus far, numbering over 100,000, took place in Washington, DC. Of course, many Jews were deeply invested in the anti-war movement and felt they were expressing core Jewish values of human dignity, but Kahane had a different view.46 For him, what mattered most was Jewish survival, and he believed that victory in Vietnam would also reverberate in Israel's struggle in the Middle East. Kahane was certainly not alone in this. In November 1966, the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America voted to endorse the Vietnam War. They claimed that the spread of communism was almost always accompanied by the suppression of Jewish religious freedom. But Kahane had a much more complex geopolitical theory.47\n\nKahane desperately wanted to implicate Jews in this Cold War face-off by viewing Vietnam as part of a Cold War battle that affected Jews in two ways. First, that the Sino-Russian pact was implicated in Vietnam, which is obvious enough and part of standard Cold War thinking: the logic was that a win for China would be a win for the Soviet Union and thus damaging for the struggle for Soviet Jews. Second, that Israel's war against Arabs was comparable to the US's war against China.\n\nWhat Shukeiri did for Kahane was create a bridge between the Arab struggle and China. Because Shukeiri viewed the Palestinian struggle against Israeli \"imperialism\" as comparable to the North Vietnamese struggle against American imperialism, Kahane thought that Shukeiri essentially chose sides and made the Palestinians an enemy of the US. As the US waged a war in Vietnam, it also had to support Israel's war against Arabs. For him it was the same war. Thus, the liberal Jewish protest against the war in Vietnam was tantamount to taking the Arab side in the war against Israel.\n\nWhat Kahane exhibits here is his deep investment in American imperialism, with Israel being its great beneficiary, thus, in some way, acknowledging [End Page 91] the Arab claim that Israel was simply part of the Western imperial project. We must remember that Kahane did not shy away from Israel's attachment to the US, including its imperialist tendencies, even as he viewed Israel as an exceptional state based on a divine mandate. In this reading, the New Left's antiwar program (which included many progressive Jews) was by definition, albeit unwittingly, anti-Israel. This was not just in Kahane's imagination. One can see this in the New Politics Conference held in Chicago in August 1967 where the Black Caucus successfully persuaded the conference to adopt a position against \"Zionist colonial exploitation.\" This was not lost on some New Left Jews who understood the apparent incongruity of protesting the Vietnam War while supporting Israel.48\n\nThe anti-Israel position of many in the New Left after 1967 was not the invention of Kahane alone. It was the impetus and even the reason behind Michael Walzer's Just and Unjust Wars in part to justify defending Israel's occupation and condemn the US's war in Vietnam.49 Yet for Kahane there was no incongruity since both conflicts were part of the Cold War against communism. As he stated in his congressional testimony,\n\nUnfortunately, very, very few people know of or realize how closely linked American foreign policy [with] American security, the American future, is linked to that of freedom-loving nations such as Israel, and I would like to make a comment right here that I believe my newspaper believes that the majority of American Jews believe, that the war in Vietnam and the war in the Middle East were part of the same war, same enemies. . . . Communism is an entity, a unity. The Israeli troops fought for America. American troops in Vietnam fight for Israel.50\n\nBut, more specifically, why would Kahane publish a book about Vietnam in 1967, the same year as the Six-Day War? Was it because of the escalation of protests against the war, which he maintained were destructive, or the way the triumphant Six-Day War changed the status quo in the Israeli-Arab conflict? Perhaps both. The reason may have been less about the global fight against communism and more about countering liberal Jews in the US. In 1967, the anti-war movement was gaining steam, and Kahane wanted to make a case that US Jews [End Page 92] who were protesting the war were endangering themselves as Jews and endangering the Israel they ostensibly supported. Kahane thus argued that the freedoms the New Left enjoyed, as Jews and Americans, would be in peril if Vietnam fell to the Viet Cong, even if communism never reached American shores. It is for this reason, I believe, that he and Churba chose to end their book on Vietnam with a quote from an anonymous Israeli source speaking to the US anti-war protestors: \"So long as America stands alone and does this work and spills the blood of her sons in Vietnam, she is not worthy of being kicked and smeared but is deserving of appreciation and support.\"51\n\nWe can see this sentiment in a slightly different way in the October 20, 1967, segment of \"Communism vs. Judaism\" in The Jewish Week where Kahane engaged Reform Rabbi Abraham Feinberg (1899–1986) of Holy Blossom Temple in Toronto.52 Feinberg was a US American rabbi who served in Canada and was part of a group that traveled to Vietnam to see for themselves the two sides of the conflict. He returned with positive things to say about the North Vietnamese people and also an invitation from Ho Chi Minh to President Johnson for peace talks. What interested Kahane was not just Feinberg's sympathy for Ho Chi Minh but also how Feinberg claimed to be a passionate supporter of Israel.\n\nThe case of Feinberg illustrated for Kahane the utter hypocrisy that was poisoning the liberal Jewish community in the US—that is, between their belief in the right of Israel to exist and their claim that the US should exit Vietnam and allow the Viet Cong to spread communist rule to the south. As noted, it is this apparent contradiction that bothered Walzer as well. Kahane writes, \"This same Rabbi Feinberg who so ardently defends Israel and Ho Chi Minh apparently has not the slightest awareness or interest in the fact that of all the deadly enemies of the Jewish State, few are deadlier than Uncle Ho.\" In addition, Kahane claimed that Feinberg was unaware that Nguyen Huu Tho of the Viet Cong had cabled Ahmed Shukeiri, \"wish[ing] the Palestinian people further success in their struggle against Israel, the aggressive tool of imperialism and the realizing of their hope of returning to Palestine.\"53\n\nIn short, using Feinberg as an example, Kahane argued that the liberal Jewish community in the US was stuck in a dangerous contradiction. Their [End Page 93] anti-imperialism and support for progressive national liberation movements led them to oppose the war without duly recognizing that Israel was viewed by the Marxist bloc as an imperialist regime (attached to the US) that was preventing the PLO from its national aspirations. Thus, for Kahane, Jewish commitment to Israel required the recognition of Arab ties to the Tricontinental Conference in Havana in January 1966. These ties made Israel part of the very imperialist problem they were fighting against in their opposition to the war.54 That is, if the Jewish left were protesting American imperialism in Southeast Asia, they were also, perhaps unwittingly, contesting Israeli sovereignty in the Middle East. For Kahane, Zionism was a reactionary (not a liberal) Jewish liberation movement that was fighting against the threat of a communist take-over. Liberal US Jews had totally lost perspective. They supported leftist liberation movements while ignoring their own.\n\nBut here Kahane found himself in his own contradiction. On the one hand, Israel was an arm of Western imperialism against the communist threat. And yet he also believed it was a liberation movement of the Jews that the Jewish left should support. Liberation from what? From the tyranny of exile? From liberalism? Not clear. In any case, the way out of this for the Jewish left was to detach the two struggles (Israel and Vietnam), as Waltzer tried to do in Just and Unjust War. Kahane does something a bit different.\n\nTHE 1971 BRUSSELS CONFERENCE ON SOVIET JEWRY AS KAHANE'S GREAT VICTORY AGAINST US JEWISH LIBERALISM\n\nKahane's attack on US Jewish liberalism comes through in the episode around the February 1971 international conference for Soviet Jewry. The international conference held in the Palais des Congrès in Brussels was intended to give public voice to the plight of Soviet Jews.55 It included a delegation of 250 US Americans as well as strong delegations from Europe and Israel. In attendance were some of the great Jewish leaders and intellectuals of the time, including film director Otto Preminger, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky, writers Elie Wiesel and Saul Bellow, scholar Gershom Scholem, US American rabbi Alexander Schindler, head of [End Page 94] the Herut (Likud) party Menachem Begin, and Labor party leader Golda Meir. An ailing David Ben-Gurion was also in attendance. Another US American delegate was Albert Shanker, the head of the United Federation of Teachers from 1964–1986 who, a few years back in 1968, was Kahane's nemesis in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville school strike that inspired the founding of the JDL.56\n\nThe Brussels conference countered Kahane's entire approach to Soviet Jewry. He submitted a proposal for a talk he wanted to give at the conference. Not surprisingly, the committee rejected his proposal. This is where Kahane's militant intervention began, as he attempted to unveil the hypocrisy of liberal Zionists' support for Soviet Jewry. It was political theater par excellence.\n\nWhat did the Brussels conference matter, and why did it matter for Kahane to attend? The fight for Soviet Jewry was already in full swing by 1971. But the Brussels conference was a watershed moment in terms of making Soviet Jewry an international movement that joined together a wide swath of famous Jews, and non-Jews, to pressure the Soviet Union to allow its Jews to emigrate. It was largely about publicity, but, in this case, publicity also meant leverage. And leverage is what the movement needed.\n\nKahane's choice to attend the Brussels conference uninvited was not merely to have his voice heard about Soviet Jewry, for which he had just been convicted of a crime, giving him credibility as one who fought for Soviet Jews in the streets of America that few in the liberal Jewish establishment could match. And it was not only about being included in the cadre of famous Jews. Rather, he used the event as an international public setting to begin a war against the Jewish establishment, whose complacency in dealing with Soviet Jewry for years now took a hypocritical turn is this high-profile conference. Instead of accepting the verdict that he was not welcome at the conference, Kahane saw it as the opportunity he had been waiting for. Kahane arrived in Brussels, entered the conference hall uninvited, and sent a personal note to the chairman requesting to speak, knowing, I think, that his radical plan would never be accepted. The conference organizers took the bait.\n\nKahane's ten-point platform was diametrically opposed to the liberal diplomacy-driven platform of the conference. Among other things, Kahane called for an immediate cessation of talks with the Soviet Union on disarmament, space, culture, and trade, as well as a ban of Soviets from the Olympics, nonviolent civil disobedience, and nonstop daily demonstrations at all official Soviet installations. Basically, Kahane was demanding that the US boycott the Soviet Union until Jews were free to emigrate. It was a bold and unrealistic plan with no chance of US support. This illustrated the Americanness of Kahane's [End Page 95] activism I mentioned earlier: challenging the elasticity of American freedom and resolve and demanding it stand up to its principles. In this sense, he was simply extending his activities in the New York City school strike from a few years before to this new issue. The difference here was that this issue had much wider appeal among US Jews in part because it joined the communist threat in Southeast Asia with the Arab threat to Israel. When he stressed the communist element and its connection to Israel, it also had much wider appeal among the US public at large. Kahane's point, which was different than the leftist advocates for Soviet Jewry, was that the cause of Soviet Jewry was not exclusively about the freedom of Soviet Jews to emigrate: it was a new front in the war against communism, and it was also a battle against anti-Zionism, and thus, for him, part of his war against liberalism and antisemitism.\n\nKahane's attempt to speak at the conference caused the leaders to have a closed session to discuss the matter. It is a matter of debate whether they also informed the Belgian police, who then were rumored to have arrested Kahane and to have removed him from the premises. In fact, he was never arrested. Samuel Shoshan, a Kahane supporter who was at the conference, was there with Kahane until he left Brussels, and, in an interview with the Jewish Telegraph Agency London Bureau Chief, S. J. Goldsmith, he said that no one at the conference ordered his arrest:\n\nThere is not a scrap of evidence that anybody in the conference had anything to do with the arrest. In fact, a high-ranking Belgian official told me, \"We read the Herald Tribune (of Paris) and we know who Kahane is. Our purpose was merely to ensure that there are no unpleasant incidents in our capital and we were not involved in the whole matter otherwise.\"57\n\nIn any case, no formal charges were filed. There may have simply been a policy of escorting Kahane to the airport. But it seems that rumors began at the conference itself about the organizers ordering his arrest. These rumors were a blessing Kahane could not have imagined. When news got around the conference that Jews had handed over another Jew to the police, pandemonium broke loose. Menachem Begin, the only one in the closed session who voted in favor of allowing Kahane to speak, accused the organizers of an \"un-Jewish act\" in turning him over to the police.58 Delegate Morris Brafman, a Holocaust survivor, supporter of Ze'ev Jabotinsky's Revisionist Zionism, and a wealthy Manhattan entrepreneur [End Page 96] (he had a lucrative lingerie business), jumped onto the stage, grabbed the microphone, and began yelling, \"Meir Kahane has been arrested! I demand to know who ordered Meir Kahane arrested!\"59 Otto Preminger went even further in his public address that evening, saying that Kahane was treated \"exactly as contemptible and wrong as what the Nazis and the Soviet Communists have done.\"60 Kahane had succeeded in getting a delegate to accuse the leftists on the committee of being communists! The New York Times story on the conference mentioned Kahane's ousting in the third paragraph, before Golda Meir's summation speech. It made the front pages of newspapers throughout western Europe—in Vienna, Amsterdam, Antwerp, Paris, London, Hamburg, Rome—and even in South America.\n\nKahane's antics at the Brussels conference got him the immediate international notoriety he desired and launched his new career as the militant arm of the movement for Soviet Jewry. The issue itself had widespread support among US Jews, and this shift would thus gain him prominence and popularity. But it would also lead to his downfall in the US and the downfall of the JDL as well.\n\nReflecting on the conference some years later in his 1975 book The Story of the Jewish Defense League, Kahane wrote:\n\nI went to Brussels because I feared that the conference would content itself with platitudes. It did. I went to Brussels because I sensed that concrete programs would not even be on the agenda. They were not. I went to Brussels because, if playwrights and producers and authors and architects who have little or no share in the struggle for Soviet Jewry were allowed to the hallowed entry, representatives of an organization that has literally spilled its blood on barricades and gone to prison for our oppressed brethren had a moral and natural right to speak.61\n\nHere, Kahane makes a generic radical claim against liberals: we have paid the price, we were in the streets, we understand the enemy more than you do.\n\nEssentially, Kahane turned the conference on its head. Its leaders were now being accused by their own members of the same discriminatory policies they claimed to be protesting. And such accusations dovetailed with Kahane's own general critique of liberalism: its claim to openness was really a disguise for the [End Page 97] exclusion of more radical views. For Kahane, Brussels thus illustrated precisely what was wrong with the Jewish establishment on numerous fronts:\n\nBrussels, where dissent was stifled, where fearful men kept out of Jewish militant, where a Jew was seized by Belgian police and expelled by force with the knowledge and approval of Jews. This was the story of Brussels. And more, it was the story of the Jewish establishment and why JDL came into being.62\n\nKahane was not wrong; the conference turned into a side show, whereas Kahane's protest was the main event. As Gal Beckerman noted, \"It was Kahane's moment, and he grabbed it. In the weeks leading up to and following the Brussels's conference, he brought unprecedented attention to Soviet Jewry\"63—and, I would add, unprecedented attention to the JDL. Kahane won in Brussels on two fronts. First, he succeeded in getting Soviet Jewry on the front pages of newspapers worldwide. He was made the victim of being denied the right to speak, and he used it to his benefit when he returned to the US. The conference results were nominal at best, counterproductive at worst. But Kahane returned with the wind at his back.\n\nBrussels poised him to become the leading face of Soviet Jewry in 1971. More than that, it gave him credibility to implement his plan of harassment and civil disobedience in opposition to the diplomatic approach of the establishment. In a sense, from the US, Kahane and his small band of ragtag Jewish followers waged a war of attrition against one of the world's most powerful countries, attempting to broaden it to include Vietnam as well. He globalized Soviet Jewry as an issue. Brussels gave him the legitimacy he needed and the media attention he craved not only for Soviet Jewry but also for his attack on liberal US Jewry more generally.\n\nKahane rode the wave of Brussels and then a massive Soviet Jewry rally in Washington, DC, rally in March 21, 1971, until it came crashing down in January 1972 while Kahane was in Israel preparing for his son's bar mitzvah. In the early hours of January 27, a group of JDL members threw a bomb into the window of Sol Hurok Productions in Manhattan. The impresario of Sol Hurok had booked Soviet entertainment groups, such as the Bolshoi dancers, and thus had long been a target of Kahane's wrath. The JDL threatened him, but he did not change his policy. A little after nine in the morning on January 27, 1972, the bomb went off in Hurok's offices, causing a fire that injured thirteen employees and killed a 27-year-old employee, Iris Kones (who also happened to be Jewish) [End Page 98] from smoke inhalation.64 This act wiped out any inroads Kahane had made after Brussels and Washington. Kahane was in Israel at the time, and it was never clear whether he knew about the plan (he claimed he did not), but it did not matter. His legitimacy in the US was critically damaged.65 His US career, including his role in Soviet Jewry, was coming to an end."
