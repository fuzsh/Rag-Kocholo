But the who was on stage and hit him with guitars until he left.\n\nHe was on trial with what I believe was known as the \"Chicago 7\" for starting riots.\n\nThe history of the 60s was a time distorted by chaos and opposition. It often called the time of troubles by people in the establishment and a rite of passage for a huge generation suddenly coming of age, \"The Baby Boomers.\"\n\nEvery new generation is going to defy the parent generation and this one did with joyful exuberance.\n\nTo say that Rubin and Hoffman were the only good things to come out of the decade is just not looking very closely.\n\nThe society of the 50's was rigidly conformist. If you stood in Times Square on any day, almost every male wore a white shirt and tie and maybe a suit jacket and hard leather shoes. Women didn't wear pants and there was a lot less of them because the majority of them were \"homemakers or housewives.\"\n\nThe 60's dramatically changed all of this. A young generation was set free in a prosperous time where you could hitch-hike all over the country or go to the big city with not much more than $20 in your pocket. The only way you could do that today would be as an outlaw or a homeless person.\n\nThe 50's were so heavily censored that this new generation rejected many of the old traditions to the point where they began to invent their own life styles. For many this included drugs.\n\nPeople forget that women were not liberated at this time. There was an implied social code that they were supposed to follow. The 60's prosperity brought in a time where women could go to college and forge a career. They could get their own apartment and not be exclusively dependent on a male and certainly not stay in an abusive relationship as in the past.\n\nPeople forget how it was before.\n\nHomosexuals were regularly jailed or black-mailed. In some states, blacks could not legally marry whites under threat of prison or worse.\n\nThe democratic tradition of protest came alive in opposition to the war in Vietnam and was instrumental in ending the war.\n\nPeople tend to characterize the 60's as, ..Dirty hippies, drugs and chaos in the streets.\" They over look the important, positive social changes that occurred during this time and that we now take for granted.\n\nThere was one famous protest (though they protested and were on national TV all the time) was at the pentagon. The Yippies sent out flyers that claimed they were going to \"meditate\" and make the pentagon \"levitate\". They surrounded the pentagon with military opposition, put flowers in the barrels of their guns, and hung out for a while.\n\nThey also started a famous riot at the Democratic national convention.\n\n...\n\nHe was on trial with what I believe was known as the \"Chicago 7\" for starting riots.\n\nTo me, the Chicago 7 trial was more interesting than what they did before.\n\nThe main charge, IIRC, was not just starting a riot, but conspiracy to cross state lines to start a riot. That made it federal case.\n\nThroughout the trial, many of the 7, including Hoffman & Ruben, kept up their 'theatrical' antics, often turning the court into a circus. At the same time, the judge, Julius Hoffman, played a hard-... denying certain rights to the defendants and making other slanted rulings. In the end, most, if not all of the 7 were convicted of one thing or another and sentence to prison. But the Supreme Court overturned the ruling and set them free.\n\nYears ago HBO made a very good reenactment movie of the trial culled directly from the court records. I don't know if it is still available. But it casts serious doubts on the 7 starting the riots. it seems closer to the truth to say that the Chicago police were the main culprits."
