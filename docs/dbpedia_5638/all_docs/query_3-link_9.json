        "text": "In 1970 Jerry Rubin had everything. He was the author of a best‐selling book, he was famous as a leader of a mass movement and he was deeply in love. Then life came crashing down around him. In two short years, his political movement disappeared, a group of young kids publicly retired him for being over 30 and the woman he adored walked out on him. Newspapers began describing him as “erstwhile” and “aging.” People started relating to him as an image, not as a human being and, worst of all, Jerry himself believed the image. He felt dead at 34.\n\nBy Jerry Rubin. 208 pp. New York: M. Evans & Co. $7.95.\n\nThen one day, walking down a street in New York, he was “zapped” by an insight. He was being given an opportunity to grow. If he wouldn't stay stuck in the old images, he could start his life over, expand and reincarnate himself.\n\n“Growing (Up) at Thirty‐seven” is the story of Jerry Rubin's attempt at rebirth: an odyssey through the lands of consciousness expansion. It begins in the twilight of “the Movement,” when, in 1972, he could still manipulate the media by calling a press conference in Miami, taking off his shirt and announcing that 10,000 Yippies would parade nude through the streets to denounce the Democratic and Republican Conventions. The local TV news shows headlined the story and a flood of conservative counter‐protest resulted. It was a non‐event. By that time Jerry had few naked Yippies at his command.\n\nFame had always been addictive to Jerry Rubin. once someone asked him what he did for a living. “I'm famous,” he replied. “That's my job.” But the fame had backfired. Young people were sneering at him. One by one, the leaders of the movement were being “eaten for breakfast by our own “ Jerry's life was being made unbearable by the very public image he had worked so painstakingly to create.\n\nSo he moved to California and plunged into self‐discovery. In a fiveyear period he directly experienced est, Gestalt therapy, Bioenergetics, Ro'fing, Tai Chi, Esalen, meditation, Mind Control, Arica and acupuncture. He got into health food and drank so much carrot juice that his legs turned orange. (The doctor told him not to worry, but he gave up carrot juice anyway.)\n\nHe entered Psychic Therapy, a regimen that uses the theory of reincarnation and karma to try to cure people's hang‐ups about their parents. The therapy got him in touch with “Lorraine,” his internal spirit guide who spoke to him from a spot inside his solar plexus. “Jerry,” she said, “hate is as strong a bond between people as love. As long as you hate your father, you will be tied to him.” Quite some advice to come from inside the man who, back in the 60's, had admonished kids to kill their parents. Now Jerry came to realize it was the parent inside oneself that has to be killed and that can be done only through love and understanding.\n\nJerry began to see how much like his own mother and father he was. He saw the influence (for good and ill) that his grandfather, an orthodox, religious Jew, had had on him. He remembered being allowed as a little boy to sit and pray with the men at synagogue while the women were segregated upstairs. Then he flashed to his Yippie meetings, where he and Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden talked about their business and humored the women when they spoke up, not expecting them to say anything worthwhile.\n\nHe remembered his grandfather's chanting of “meaningless” Hebrew prayers and came to compare it to the repetition of mantras in meditation. He realized that his grandfather was “emptying his mind . . . getting high, losing his ego, dancing in cosmic consciousness.” Jerry stopped being prejudiced against God and human beings. He came to un derstand that “I am my mother and father. I am my grandparents. If I hate them, I hate myself!” That realization, he says, was “like an acid rush, at once terrifying and completely liberating.”\n\nHis most powerful growth experience, he writes, was “est,” Werner Erhard's synthesis of yoga, Castaneda, Penis and Scientology. But, as he seems to have about most things, he has mixed feelings concerning Erhard and refers to him as the Eddie Fisher of Zen."
