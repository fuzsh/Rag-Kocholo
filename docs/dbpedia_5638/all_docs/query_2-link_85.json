More than just an exploration of Ginsberg’s personal ephemera – it includes Allen’s interactions with Bob Dylan, Jerry Rubin and the Yippies, Paul McCartney, Patti Smith, Diane di Prima, Amiri Baraka, Arthur Russell, Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady, William Burroughs, Norman Mailer, Terry Southern, and even Henry Kissinger! Poet and close friend of Allen; Anne Waldman wrote the introduction to Material Wealth."
