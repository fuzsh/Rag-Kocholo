        "text": "November 2020\n\nImagine there’s no countries\n\nIt isn’t hard to do\n\nNothing to kill or die for\n\nAnd no religion, too\n\nImagine all the people\n\nLiving life in peace\n\nYou, you may say I’m a dreamer\n\nBut I’m not the only one\n\nI hope someday you will join us\n\nAnd the world will be as one\n\nImagine no possessions\n\nI wonder if you can\n\nNo need for greed or hunger\n\nA brotherhood of man\n\nThere was a time when it seemed as if everyone knew this song. Many knew the lyrics by heart and would sing them anytime, anywhere. It was an anthem for a generation. It felt like the only discussion was about how realistic this vision was, separating the dreamers from more realistic people. What was and is interesting to me is that such a vision was considered to be the proper goal for humanity.\n\nWikipedia\n\n“Imagine” is a song by English rock musician John Lennon from his 1971 album of the same name. The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage listeners to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song’s lyrics and content came from his wife, Yoko Ono, and in 2017 she received co-writing credit.\n\nLennon and Ono co-produced the song with Phil Spector. Recording began at Lennon’s home studio at Tittenhurst Park, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the Record Plant, in New York City, during July. In October, Lennon released “Imagine” as a single in the United States, where it peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was first issued as a single in Britain in 1975, to promote the compilation Shaved Fish, and reached number six on the UK Singles Chart that year. It later topped the chart following Lennon’s murder in 1980.\n\nBMI named “Imagine” one of the 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. In 1999, it was ranked number 30 on the RIAA’s list of the 365 “Songs of the Century”, earned a Grammy Hall of Fame Award, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s “500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll”. A 2002 UK survey conducted by the Guinness World Records British Hit Singles book named it the second-best single of all time, while Rolling Stone ranked it number three in the 2004 list of “The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time”. Since 2005, event organizers have played the song just before the New Year’s Times Square Ball drops in New York City.\n\nBy 2013, “Imagine” had sold over 1.6 million copies in the UK. More than 200 artists have performed or covered the song, including Madonna, Stevie Wonder, Joan Baez, Lady Gaga, Elton John, and Diana Ross. After “Imagine” was featured at the 2012 Summer Olympics, the song re-entered the UK Top 40, reaching number 18. In March 2020, in response to the unfolding coronavirus pandemic, the actress Gal Gadot posted an informal but star-studded cover version of “Imagine” on Instagram. The song remains controversial, as it has been since its release, over its request to imagine “no religion too”.\n\nMY COMMENT\n\nThis once iconic song seems to have faded away and it seems that only a few baby boomers dare to mention it and dare to believe that, against what the world is today, its ideals are a goal to strive for. I dare to believe, however, that there are many people fighting for this goal. It has just shifted some – to the fight against climate change and to the struggle to save the planet and the people living here.\n\nIn several issues I have addressed how divided the American population is. As someone who likes to look at modern events through the lenses of 100 years of history (or more if needed), the claims that the USA has not been this divided since the Civil War ignore the New Deal policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy. FDR was portrayed as a pawn in the hands of the USSR, taking orders from Moscow. The viciousness of much of the American media against him can sadly be compared to the worst on today’s social media. Similar hysteria existed when JFK ran for and won the 1960 election. Because he was Catholic, he was declared unfit to be president, as he would be obeying the pope. He was also depicted as a traitor for his supposed allegiance to a higher authority. Reading about those periods opened my eyes and increased my interest in learning more about American history. The civil rights movement, the opposition to the Vietnam war and the riots that occurred mainly in the 1960s are better known to the American public. Comparison is often misleading, especially when dealing with historical events. Lately, I am seeing statements like “It feels like the ’60s demonstrations again” from a lot of my readers. Interestingly to me, they talk about the Monterrey festival as a turning point, more than Woodstock.\n\nThis trend must be quite strong, as Netflix has just dug up another iconic moment of that era, the 1968 Chicago Democratic convention. Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young endlessly sang their song “Chicago” detailing the events of that week. Today there is The Trial of the Chicago 7.\n\nWikipedia\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 is a 2020 American historical legal drama film written and directed by Aaron Sorkin. The film follows the Chicago Seven, a group of anti–Vietnam War protesters charged with conspiracy and crossing state lines to incite riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It features an ensemble cast that includes Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Sacha Baron Cohen, Daniel Flaherty, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Michael Keaton, Frank Langella, John Carroll Lynch, Eddie Redmayne, Noah Robbins, Mark Rylance, Alex Sharp, and Jeremy Strong.\n\nMY COMMENT\n\nAt one point I got very interested in how the Yippie movement went into the political debate and became a structured political force. Jerry Rubin, the leader of this political force, had faded into anonymity until Netflix aired this program. People interested in these matters could learn a lot comparing Jerry Rubin’s actions and his political goals to what the USA is living through today. Again, who remembers him?\n\nWikipedia\n\nJerry Clyde Rubin (July 14, 1938 – November 28, 1994) was an American social activist, anti-war leader, and counterculture icon during the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s, he became a successful businessman. He is known for being one of the co-founders of the Youth International Party (YIP), whose members were referred to as Yippies.\n\nMY COMMENT\n\nAfter all this, I doubt any reader will be surprised that I read Rubin’s book DO IT!: Scenarios of the Revolution (1970) when I was in my early 20s.\n\nYou may think that I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one drawing such parallels. It can be scary to look at how many people died, how many were sentenced to life in prison or otherwise had their lives destroyed in the fight back then. It can also be equally reassuring to see how close to the breaking point the USA was in the late ’60s and how quickly it recovered, all things considered.\n\nVoting will end in a few days. Two very different visions of the future of the USA are riding on the ballots.\n\nVALUABLE DISCUSSIONS CAN BE HAD ON FACEBOOK!\n\nIt is common to criticize Facebook these days, as it displays so much negativity and hatred. I use it for two things:\n\n• Staying in contact with friends and acquaintances, mainly those in the USA whom I cannot see frequently,\n\n• Being active in groups dedicated to immigration and helping foreigners in France.\n\nI recently had the following exchange in a group dealing with Americans in France.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\n“Hi Jean. I believe you’re French, right? What do you think about how generous the French healthcare system is for foreigners?”\n\nMY ANSWER\n\n“I understand why you qualify the French healthcare system as generous as it covers foreigners and citizens alike. It also covers undocumented aliens (sans-papiers) for free. It follows one basic logic, if 99.99% of the population in France at any given time is covered by the public system, national policies will affect everybody which is critical especially during a pandemic.\n\n“I like the sense of security that comes from not worrying about being covered as well as knowing that the people sitting around me in the metro, the bus, the train are also covered and therefore there is just about a zero risk that they can transmit a dangerous virus.\n\n“This is why I find the COVID 19 pandemic so disturbing in so many ways, starting with the fact that this sense of security is gone. I can no longer trust the people next to me.\n\n“SO it is not generous, it is a national security issue. This issue shows probably the most vividly how Europe and the USA view political issues so differently.”\n\nI expected some strong opposition, but what I got was a few positive and supportive comments and a few likes. On a topic that I thought to be quite divisive, the exchanges were quite civil. So it can happen.\n\nWHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE SECOND WAVE OF COVID 19 IN FRANCE?\n\nAt the time I was writing this (before the latest lockdown), all major French cities had a 9 PM curfew and it seemed that after a few weeks it was being well observed. As usual, there have been countless debates about how effective it is, about whether the situation is so awful that such a measure is needed, about how bad the number of deaths and ICU admissions will be in the coming weeks and about whether French hospitals will be able to cope.\n\nI do not know and I find all the conflicting positions very confusing. The new policy had an immediate and rather radical effect on my professional life. I am now home by 8:30, just to be on the safe side. Once I am home, I have a hard time resuming work, and I admit I have been quite slow in answering emails and following up on client requests. The change in my schedule is one of the main reasons.\n\nI am not complaining, as I had thought I would gradually spend less time in the office this fall. The problem is that the decision was made almost overnight. I am trying to adapt as quickly as I can. With the lockdown in effect now, I plan on meeting with my clients remotely through the usual software.\n\nThe situation of the pandemic in France has worsened enough that this kind of decision was needed. The government has extended the state of emergency until February 16th, 2021, and 46 million people are now under curfew.\n\nHere are the numbers that matter: As of October 29th there were more than 200 deaths and 47,000 new cases recorded per day. The unknown here is the true number of cases. The topic has been discussed a great deal in the USA; testing is being done on a wide scale and so many people are finding out they are infected, often with no symptoms. The concern is the uncertainty over the ratio of those infected who will get seriously sick. Because the scale differs considerably from that of the first wave, the French government is trying to plan for the worst.\n\nA critical piece of information, the Paris prefecture as well as those in the rest of France are staying open. Having an appointment at the prefecture is a very valid reason to be out of your home. Make sure you fill out the attestation, which is the statement explaining the reason why you are out. The convocation alone is not enough.\n\nTERRORISM IN FRANCE\n\nMy opinion on terrorism in France may be disputed, and I am ready for that. I believe that since the beginning of the 20th century, France has had to handle terrorist attacks perpetrated by foreign forces or by French people pushing various ideologies. I find it interesting that the extreme right has been far more prevalent and therefore much more dangerous for France than the extreme left, which only existed in its terrorist form for about 10 years at most:\n\nWikipedia\n\nAction directe (AD) was a French far-left terrorist group that committed a series of assassinations and violent attacks in France between 1979 and 1987. Members of Action Directe considered themselves libertarian communists who had formed an “urban guerrilla organization”. The French government banned the group. During its existence, AD’s members murdered 12 people and wounded a further 26.\n\nMY COMMENT\n\nIn those days the French domestic intelligence service (equivalent to the FBI), then called Les Renseignements Généraux, carefully and slowly investigated all terrorist groups on both sides of the political spectrum, as the attacks were meticulously prepared and needed a lot of time to set up. The danger France faces today is different, and requires a very different operating mode. The danger comes mostly from individual fanatics who do not belong to a political party or terrorist organization, though they may be more or less loosely connected with radical terrorist groups located both within and outside France. They do not always appear on the intelligence services’ radar, and they act very quickly.\n\nThus, the current analysis is that because the former type of French terrorism no longer exists, French police should radically change their methods and move very fast, putting under surveillance not only identified terrorist groups but also people who regularly visit their websites. Owing to the nature of the current threat, this also means having a significant share of police officers who are native speakers of Arabic. That opens a completely different topic, but one that is just as complex as this one.\n\nOFFICE CLOSED FOR CHRISTMAS\n\nThe office will close for three weeks over the Christmas holidays, starting on Friday December 18th in the evening and reopening on the morning of Monday January 4th. As always, I will be reachable by email for emergencies and important matters. The service I offer of receiving mail for clients will continue while the office is closed. Of course, Sarah or I will honor prefecture meetings already scheduled, as well as a couple of other engagements.\n\nBest regards,"
