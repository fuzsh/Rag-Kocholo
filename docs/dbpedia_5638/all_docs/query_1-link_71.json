        "text": "Veteran social activist and politician Tom Hayden, a stalwart of America's New Left who served 18 years in California's state legislature and gained a dash of Hollywood glamour by marrying actress Jane Fonda, has died aged 76, according to media reports.\n\nMr Hayden died in Santa Monica, California, after a long illness, The Los Angeles Times reported on its website.\n\n\"A political giant and dear friend has passed,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti wrote on Twitter.\n\nMr Hayden, who forged his political activism as a founding member of Students for a Democratic Society, which stood at the core of the 1960s anti-war and civil rights movements, was the principal author of the group's revolutionary manifesto, the Port Huron Statement.\n\nThe University of Michigan student ventured into the Deep South, where he joined voter registration campaigns and was arrested and beaten while taking part in the \"freedom rider\" protests against racial segregation.\n\nMr Hayden, however, became perhaps best known as one of the \"Chicago Eight\" activists tried on conspiracy and incitement charges following protests at the turbulent 1968 Democratic National Convention.\n\nHe was ultimately acquitted of all charges.\n\n'The single greatest figure of the 1960s student movement'\n\nA New York Times book review of his 1988 memoir, Reunion, one of more than 20 books published under his name, called Mr Hayden \"the single greatest figure of the 1960s student movement\".\n\nOutliving contemporaries Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton, Hayden remained active in left-wing politics well into the 21st century, posting on Twitter just a week ago.\n\nWinning election himself to the California state Assembly in 1982, and then the state Senate a decade later, Mr Hayden went on to serve a total of 18 years.\n\nLater, he became director of the Peace and Justice Resource Centre, a non-profit left-wing think tank devoted mainly to analysis of continued US military involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, drug policy and global poverty.\n\nMr Hayden was married to actress Fonda from 1973 to 1990, and the pair had two children.\n\nMidway through their marriage, the couple graced the cover of People Magazine.\n\nIn later years his writings were published in national publications including The New York Times, the Boston Globe and the Denver Post.\n\nHe also served on the editorial board and was a columnist for The Nation magazine.\n\nTributes poured in on social media, including from actress Martha Plimpton, who wrote on Twitter: \"Rest in peace, Tom Hayden. And thank you. Love to all who knew & worked w him. Esp his family, and @Janefonda. He was a good man.\""
