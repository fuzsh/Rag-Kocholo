        "text": "Jerry Rubin, the flamboyant 1960's radical who once preached distrust of \"anyone over 30,\" died on Monday night in a Los Angeles hospital where he was being treated after having been struck by a car two weeks earlier. He was 56 and lived in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles.\n\nA hospital spokesman said the cause was cardiac arrest, but Mr. Rubin had been unconscious and in critical condition since he was hit on the night of Nov. 14 while jaywalking across Wilshire Boulevard in the Westwood section of Los Angeles. His former wife, Mimi Leonard Fleischman, said that he had suffered multiple injuries.\n\nAs a bearded standard-bearer of the 1960's counterculture and opposition to the Vietnam War, Mr. Rubin carved himself a niche in the history of American radicalism with his energetic and sometimes comic gestures. He was among the founders of the Youth International Party, the Yippies, a militant but loose-knit group with a penchant for political theater. He appeared before a Congressional committee wearing a Revolutionary War costume, and was a center of attention at anti-war demonstrations in his Uncle Sam hat.\n\nMr. Rubin was prominent in the riotous protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which led to the famously unruly trial, in 1969 and 1970, of him and six other radical defendants -- the group known as the Chicago Seven. At the trial he showed up wearing judge's robes covering a blue Chicago police shirt.\n\nAfter the 1960's, Mr. Rubin wrote, lectured, sought self-improvement and then worked in New York on Wall Street and as an entrepreneur. In the 1980's, he became known for his promotion of \"networking,\" bringing together ambitious young professionals at parties at the Palladium nightclub in Manhattan. Transformed from protester to businessman but still demonstrating a flair for the public gesture, he held a series of public \"Yippie vs. Yuppie\" debates with Abbie Hoffman, another former leader of the Yippies, who committed suicide in 1989.\n\nLooking back years later at the 1960's, Mr. Rubin called himself one of \"the anti-capitalistic comics of the 1960's\" who used street theater to pursue, without much success, \"the radical dream of transforming the system from outside.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
