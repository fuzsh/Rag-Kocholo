        "text": "Final Paper Jerry Rubin is a man with very distinct views of how society should be, At the beginning of the excerpt from his book titled “Do It!” he begins to explain how school in the united states and around the world is only shaping students in very specific and unnatural ways. His writing is a very good example of how the world is changing during this time and the normal is becoming un-normal to a large group of people throughout the world. Jerry Rubin begins to make it seem like College is brainwashing people and prevents the students from seeing the natural things in life and only living life as other people tell them too by saying, “we non – student fuck ups say, excuse me student. Did you know the sun is shining? They look at us like …show more content…\n\nIn my personal experience at Bridgewater State University, I can see exactly what Rubin meant by what he said in his book “Do It”. Many times throughout this year not only have I seen examples that perfectly fit the points of his book but I have also done them as well. I am 100 percent sure that every student has at least once completed school work to the lowest of their ability to just get through the class. Also I see on a daily basis people that are buried in their books and have no life outside of their room or classroom. Sure school can help someone get good at science or math but it doesn’t teach people the little things that are necessary to live, this a point that is brought up multiple times on debate.org, a website that allows people to argue on both sides of a main point. This specific argument I examined was “does school really prepare kids for life.” Out of everyone that participated in the vote and also of the people that commented 77 percent said that everything that is 100 percent necessary for life was not taught in school. Living life should not be dependent on going to school, a person should be able to get through life happy without having to be thousands of dollars in debt to do a job that only makes them depressed or angry. Although BSU is a great school that gets its students ready for the working world it does not get them ready for a natural life that involves making friends or talking …show more content…\n\nLife has to be full of events and happiness that school and work cannot give you. Only nature and instinct can truly give someone a life that is meaningful. Knowing who you are as a person is a much more important quality for someone to have than being able to figure out how many cells are in an atom or being able to high level mathematics that will probably never be needed in most people’s life times. Jerry Rubin had very strong and also true ideas that I think still affect people to this day, even though I am a college student I believe that there is more to life than school and that everyone should read his work and try to find the true meaning of"
