        "text": "Records of the Madison, Wisconsin based organization which first coordinated the national opposition to the war in Vietnam. Two-thirds of the collection consists of exchanges with individuals and organizations from foreign countries and the United States who were active in the anti-war movement. The remainder consists of correspondence, fragmentary financial records, publications, minutes, notes, proposals, and reports which pertain to the NCC's steering and standing committees, conferences sponsored by the NCC and other anti-war groups, reports of staff trips and meetings, and various projects such as the International Days of Protest. The section provides revealing, though by no means complete information about internal operations and disputes.\n\nThe files of several conferences and staff meetings include summarized minutes, correspondence, planning material, and some lists of participants. Publications include press releases, pamphlets, and rough drafts of articles for Peace and Freedom News. (Printed copies of Peace and Freedom News are available in the Historical Society Library.) On microfilm are clippings chiefly relating to NCC participation in the International Days of Protest.\n\nProminent correspondents include Bettina Aptheker, Irving Beinin, Paul Booth, Carl Braden, Harry R. Bridges, David Dellinger, Sanford Gottlieb, Felix Greene, Ernest Gruening, Robert Kastenmeier, Arthur Kinoy, William Kunstler, Sidney Lens, Staughton Lynd, Floyd B. McKissick, Wayne Morse, A. J. Muste, Sidney Peck, Jerry Rubin, Benjamin M. Spock, and I. F. Stone.\n\nThe processed portion is summarized above and is described in the register. Additional photographic accessions are described below."
