        "text": "I’ve Got Something to Say\n\nThe Sixth Annual Clara Lemlich Awards were held in May, 2016, honoring women who have been working for the larger good their entire lives, in the tradition of those who sparked so many reforms in the aftermath of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire over one hundred years ago.\n\nWatch the video below, and learn more about the inspiring lives of our honorees by clicking on the images to the right.\n\n“I want to be able to look my children in the eye some day and say I tried to stop that” said Debra Bernhardt at a demonstration against military expenditures in the early 1980s—capturing the sentiment of Lemlich honorees from 2011 through today.\n\nBea Klier at the reception\n\nReception\n\nEdgar Romney, Bea Klier, Etta Dixon, Teresa Chan, Eva Kollisch, Naomi Replansky\n\nNYC Labor Chours members\n\nEtta Dixon, Virginia Baron, Eva Kollisch and Naomi Replansky\n\nStudents from J. Taylor Finley Middle School, Huntington, Long Island\n\nEva Kollisch and Naomi Replansky\n\nTeresa Chan\n\nVideo of the event shot and edited by Kuji Banks.

They are hosted by LaborArts, the Puffin Gallery for Social Activism at the Museum of the City of New York, and the Remember the Triangle Fire Coalition, and were organized by Rachel Bernstein, Esther Cohen, Evelyn Jones Rich, Sherry Kane, Rose Imperato and May Chen. Many thanks to Raul Nunez and Brad Segal of Corks on Columbus, and to Anne Newman Bacal, Kuji Lezama-Banks, Anuska Corbin, Veronica Garcia, Elena Palankerina, Kimberly Schiller and her Huntington, Long Island middle school students, Ruth Sergel, Anna Shelkin, Laura Talkow, Stephanie Thompson, the NY Labor History Association, and Jewish Currents. We are grateful for the continued expert support of MCNY staff, particularly Jerry Gallagher, Sarah Seidman, Samantha Fleck and Francesca Bertolini.\n\nWe invite you to visit the Puffin Gallery for Social Activism, and to visit LaborArts.org for video of previous honorees and online exhibits, including “Play it Again, Sam,” Songs of the Labor and Progressive Movements of the 1940s.\n\nTo Be of Use\n\nThe people I love the best\n\njump into work head first\n\nwithout dallying in the shallows\n\nand swim off with sure strokes almost out of sight.\n\nThey seem to become natives of that element,\n\nthe black sleek heads of seals\n\nbouncing like half-submerged balls.\n\nI love people who harness themselves, an ox to a heavy cart,\n\nwho pull like water buffalo, with massive patience,\n\nwho strain in the mud and the muck to move things forward,\n\nwho do what has to be done, again and again.\n\nI want to be with people who submerge\n\nin the task, who go into the fields to harvest\n\nand work in a row and pass the bags along,\n\nwho are not parlor generals and field deserters\n\nbut move in a common rhythm\n\nwhen the food must come in or the fire be put out.\n\nThe work of the world is common as mud.\n\nBotched, it smears the hands, crumbles to dust.\n\nBut the thing worth doing well done\n\nhas a shape that satisfies, clean and evident.\n\nGreek amphoras for wine or oil,\n\nHopi vases that held corn, are put in museums\n\nbut you know they were made to be used.\n\nThe pitcher cries for water to carry\n\nand a person for work that is real."
