        "text": "Estonia,[a] formally the Republic of Estonia,[b] is a country by the Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland across from Finland, to the west by the sea across from Sweden, to the south by Latvia, and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia. The territory of Estonia consists of the mainland, the larger islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, and over 2,200 other islands and islets on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea,[9] covering a total area of 45,339 square kilometres (17,505 sq mi).[2] The capital city Tallinn and Tartu are the two largest urban areas of the country. The Estonian language is the autochthonous and the official language of Estonia; it is the first language of the majority of its population, as well as the world's second most spoken Finnic language. The land of what is now modern Estonia has been inhabited by Homo sapiens since at least 9,000 BC. The medieval indigenous population of Estonia was one of the last \"pagan\" civilisations in Europe to adopt Christianity following the Papal-sanctioned Livonian Crusade in the 13th century. [10] After centuries of successive rule by the Teutonic Order, Denmark, Sweden, and the Russian Empire, a distinct Estonian national identity began to emerge in the mid-19th century. This culminated in the 24 February 1918 Estonian Declaration of Independence from the then warring Russian and German Empires. Democratic throughout most of the interwar period, Estonia declared neutrality at the outbreak of World War II, but the country was repeatedly contested, invaded and occupied, first by Stalinist Soviet Union in 1940, then by Nazi Germany in 1941, and ultimately reoccupied in 1944 by, and annexed into, the USSR as an administrative subunit (Estonian SSR). Throughout the 1944–1991 Soviet occupation, [11] Estonia's de jure state continuity was preserved by diplomatic representatives and the government-in-exile. Following the bloodless Estonian \"Singing Revolution\" of 1988–1990, the nation's de facto independence was restored on 20 August 1991. Estonia is a developed country, with a high-income advanced economy, ranking very highly in the Human Development Index.[12] The sovereign state of Estonia is a democratic unitary parliamentary republic, administratively subdivided into 15 maakond (counties). With a population of just over 1 million, it is one of the least populous members of the European Union, the Eurozone, the OECD, the Schengen Area, and NATO. Estonia is nowadays often considered to be one of the three \"Baltic countries\" or \"Baltic states\" — a geopolitical grouping which also includes Latvia and Lithuania. Estonia has consistently ranked highly in international rankings for quality of life,[13] education,[14] press freedom, digitalisation of public services[15][16] and the prevalence of technology companies.[17] Name Main article: Name of Estonia The name Estonia (Estonian: Eesti [ e s ti] (listen)) has been connected to Aesti, a people firstˈ ː ʲ mentioned by Roman historian Tacitus around 98 AD. Some historians have suggested that Tacitus was referring to speakers of Baltic languages (i., not Finnic-speaking Estonians), while others have proposed that the name Aesti may have been applied to the entire eastern Baltic Sea region.[18] The Viking runestones[19] and Scandinavian sagas referring to Eistland are the earliest known sources to use the name indisputably for a geographic area overlapping with what is now Estonia.[20] The toponym Estland/Eistland has been linked to Old Norse eist, austr meaning \"the east\".[21] History Main article: History of Estonia Prehistory and Viking Age Main articles: Ancient Estonia and Viking Age in Estonia Bronze Age stone-cist graves in north Estonia Human settlement in Estonia became possible 13,000- 11,000 years ago, when the ice from the last glacial era melted. The oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement, which was on the banks of Pärnu river, near Sindi, in southwest Estonia. According to radiocarbon dating, it was settled around 11, years ago.[22] The earliest human habitation during the Mesolithic period is connected to the Kunda culture. At that time the country was covered with forests, and people lived in\n\nsemi-nomadic communities near bodies of water. Subsistence activities consisted of hunting, gathering and fishing.[23] Around 4900 BC, ceramics appear of the neolithic period, known as Narva culture.[24] Starting from around 3200 BC the Corded Ware culture appeared; this included new activities like primitive agriculture and animal husbandry.[25] Iron Age artefacts of a hoard from Kumna[26] The Bronze Age started around 1800 BC, and saw the establishment of the first hill fort settlements.[27] A transition from hunter-fisher subsistence to single-farm-based settlement started around 1000 BC, and was complete by the beginning of the Iron Age around 500 BC.[22][28] The large amount of bronze objects indicate the existence of active communication with Scandinavian and Germanic tribes.[29] The middle Iron Age produced threats appearing from different directions. Several Scandinavian sagas referred to major confrontations with Estonians, notably when \"Estonian Vikings\" defeated and killed the Swedish King Ingvar.[30][31] Similar threats appeared to the east, where East Slavic principalities were expanding westward. In ca 1030 the troops of Kievan Rus led by Yaroslav the Wise defeated Estonians and established a fort in modern-day Tartu. This foothold may have lasted until ca 1061 when an Estonian tribe, the Sosols, destroyed it, followed by their raid on Pskov.[32][33][34][35] Around the 11th century, the Scandinavian Viking era around the Baltic Sea was succeeded by the Baltic Viking era, with seaborne raids by Curonians and by Estonians from the island of Saaremaa, known as Oeselians. In 1187 Estonians (Oeselians), Curonians or/and Karelians sacked Sigtuna, which was a major city of Sweden at the time.[36][37] Estonia could be divided into two main cultural areas. The coastal areas of Northern and Western Estonia had close overseas contacts with Scandinavia and Finland, while inland Southern Estonia had more contacts with Balts and Pskov.[38] The landscape of Ancient Estonia featured numerous hillforts.[39] Prehistoric or medieval harbour sites have been found on the coast of Saaremaa.[39] Estonia also has a number of graves from the Viking Age, both individual and collective, with weapons and jewellery including types found commonly throughout Northern Europe and Scandinavia.[39][40] Independent counties of Ancient Estonia in the beginning of the 13th century In the early centuries AD, political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (Estonian: kihelkond) and the county (Estonian: maakond), which consisted of multiple parishes. A parish was led by elders and centered on a hill fort; in some rare cases a parish had multiple forts. By the 13th century, Estonia consisted of eight major counties: Harjumaa, Järvamaa, Läänemaa, Revala, Saaremaa, Sakala, Ugandi, and Virumaa; and six minor, single-parish counties: Alempois, Jogentagana, Mõhu, Nurmekund, Soopoolitse, and Vaiga. Counties were independent entities and engaged only in a loose cooperation against foreign threats.[41][42] Little is known of medieval Estonians' spiritual and religious practices before Christianization. The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia mentions Tharapita as the superior deity of the then inhabitants of Saaremaa (Oeselians). There is some historical evidence about sacred groves, especially groves of oak trees, having served as places of \"pagan\" worship.[43][44] Crusades and the Catholic Era Main articles: Livonian Crusade, Terra Mariana, and Danish Estonia Medieval Estonia and Livonia after the crusade In 1199, Pope Innocent III declared a crusade to \"defend the Christians of Livonia\".[45] Fighting reached Estonia in 1206, when Danish King Valdemar II unsuccessfully invaded Saaremaa. The German Livonian Brothers of the Sword, who had previously subjugated Livonians, Latgalians, and Selonians, started campaigning against the Estonians in 1208, and over next few years both sides made numerous raids and counter-raids. A major leader of the Estonian resistance was Lembitu, an elder of Sakala County, but in 1217 the Estonians suffered a significant defeat in the Battle of St. Matthew's\n\noffensives and the bloody war finally ended in 1583 with Russian defeat.[64][65] As a result of the war, Northern Estonia became Swedish Duchy of Estonia, Southern Estonia became Polish Duchy of Livonia, and Saaremaa remained under Danish control.[66] In 1600, the Polish–Swedish War broke out, causing further devastation. The protracted war ended in 1629 with Sweden gaining Livonia, including the regions of Southern Estonia and Northern Latvia.[67] Danish Saaremaa was transferred to Sweden in 1645.[68] The wars had halved the population of Estonia from about 250–270,000 people in the mid 16th century to 115– 120,000 in the 1630s.[69] While many peasants remained in the status of serfdom during the Swedish rule, legal reforms strengthened both serfs' and free tenant farmers' land usage and inheritance rights – hence this period got the reputation of \"The Good Old Swedish Time\" in people's historical memory.[70] Swedish King Gustaf II Adolf established gymnasiums in Reval and Dorpat; the latter was upgraded to Tartu University in 1632. Printing presses were also established in both towns. In the 1680s the beginnings of Estonian elementary education appeared, largely due to efforts of Bengt Gottfried Forselius, who also introduced orthographical reforms to written Estonian.[71] The population of Estonia grew rapidly for a 60–70-year period, until the Great Famine of 1695–97 in which some 70,000–75,000 people died – about 20% of the population.[72] In 1700, the Great Northern War started, and by 1710 the whole of Estonia was conquered by the Russian Empire.[73] The war again devastated the population of Estonia, with the 1712 population estimated at only 150,000–170,000.[74] In 1721, Estonia was divided into two governorates: the governorate of Estonia, which includes the northern part of Estonia (such as the Tallinn area), and the southern governorate of Livonia, which extends to the northern part of Latvia. [75] Russian administration restored all the political and landholding rights of Baltic Germans.[76] The rights of local farmers reached their lowest point, as serfdom completely dominated agricultural relations during the 18th century.[77] Serfdom was formally abolished in 1816–1819, but this initially had very little practical effect; major improvements in farmers' rights started with reforms in the mid-19th century.[78] National Awakening Main article: Estonian national awakening Carl Robert Jakobson played a key role in the Estonian national awakening. The Estonian national awakening began in the 1850s as several leading figures started promoting an Estonian national identity among the general populace. Widespread farm buyouts by Estonians and the resulting rapidly growing class of land- owning farmers provided the economic basis for the formation of this new \"Estonian identity\". In 1857 Johann Voldemar Jannsen started publishing the first Estonian language daily newspaper and began popularising the denomination of oneself as eestlane (Estonian). [79] Schoolmaster Carl Robert Jakobson and clergyman Jakob Hurt became leading figures in a national movement, encouraging Estonian farmers to take pride in their ethnic Estonian identity.[80] The first nationwide movements formed, such as a campaign to establish the Estonian language Alexander School, the founding of the Society of Estonian Literati and the Estonian Students' Society, and the first national song festival, held in 1869 in Tartu.[81][82] [83] Linguistic reforms helped to develop the Estonian language.[84] The national epic Kalevipoeg was published in 1862, and 1870 saw the first performances of Estonian theatre. [85][86] In 1878 a major split happened in the national movement. The moderate wing led by Hurt focused on development of culture and Estonian education, while the radical wing led by Jacobson started demanding increased political and economical rights.[82] At the end of the 19th century, Russification began, as the central government initiated various administrative and cultural measures to tie Baltic governorates more closely to the empire. [81] The Russian language replaced German and Estonian in most secondary schools and\n\nuniversities, and many social and cultural activities in local languages were suppressed.[86] Still, some administrative changes aimed at reducing the power of Baltic German institutions did prove useful to Estonians.[81] In the late 1890s, there was a new surge of nationalism with the rise of prominent figures like Jaan Tõnisson and Konstantin Päts. In the early 20th century, Estonians started taking over control of local governments in towns from Germans. [87] During the 1905 Revolution, the first legal Estonian political parties were founded. An Estonian national congress was convened and demanded the unification of Estonian areas into a single autonomous territory and an end to Russification. The unrest was accompanied by both peaceful political demonstrations and violent riots with looting in the commercial district of Tallinn and in a number of wealthy landowners' manors in the Estonian countryside. The Tsarist government responded with a brutal crackdown; some 500 people were executed and hundreds more jailed or deported to Siberia.[88][89] Independence Main articles: Estonian Declaration of Independence, Estonian War of Independence, and History of Estonia § Interwar period (1920–1939) photograph of crowd around flag raising The tricolour flags of Estonia on display during the public announcement of the Declaration of Independence of Estonia in Pärnu on 23 February 1918. One of the very first images of the independent republic. In 1917, after the February Revolution, the governorate of Estonia was expanded by the Russian Provisional Government to include Estonian-speaking areas of Livonia and was granted autonomy, enabling the formation of the Estonian Provincial Assembly.[90] Bolsheviks seized power in Estonia in November 1917, and disbanded the Provincial Assembly. However, the Provincial Assembly established the Salvation Committee, and during the short interlude between Russian retreat and German arrival, the committee declared the independence of Estonia on 24 February 1918, and formed the Estonian Provisional Government. German occupation immediately followed, but after their defeat in World War I the Germans were forced to hand over power to the Provisional Government on 19 November 1918.[91][92] On 28 November 1918 Soviet Russia invaded, starting the Estonian War of Independence.[93] The Red Army came within 30 km of Tallinn, but in January 1919, the Estonian Army, led by Johan Laidoner, went on a counter-offensive, ejecting Bolshevik forces from Estonia within a few months. Renewed Soviet attacks failed, and in spring, the Estonian army, in co-operation with White Russian forces, advanced into Russia and Latvia.[94][95] In June 1919, Estonia defeated the German Landeswehr which had attempted to dominate Latvia, restoring power to the government of Kārlis Ulmanis there. After the collapse of the White Russian forces, the Red Army launched a major offensive against Narva in late 1919, but failed to achieve a breakthrough. On 2 February 1920, the Tartu Peace Treaty was signed by Estonia and Soviet Russia, with the latter pledging to permanently give up all sovereign claims to Estonia.[94][96] Estonian armoured train during the Estonian War of Independence In April 1919, the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected. The Constituent Assembly passed a sweeping land reform expropriating large estates, and adopted a new highly liberal constitution establishing Estonia as a parliamentary democracy.[97][98] In 1924, the Soviet Union organised a communist coup attempt, which quickly failed.[99] Estonia's cultural-autonomy law for ethnic minorities, adopted in 1925, is widely recognised as one of the most liberal in the world at that time.[100] The Great Depression put heavy pressure on Estonia's political system, and in 1933, the right-wing Vaps movement spearheaded a constitutional reform establishing a strong presidency.[101][102] On 12 March 1934 the acting head of state, Konstantin Päts, declared a state of emergency, under the pretext that the Vaps movement had been planning a coup. Päts, together with general Johan Laidoner and Kaarel Eenpalu,\n\nrestore Estonia's independence, but this soon proved to be in vain. Only a puppet collaborationist administration was established, and occupied Estonia was merged into Reichskommissariat Ostland, with its economy being fully subjugated to German military needs.[123] About a thousand Estonian Jews who had not managed to leave were almost all quickly killed in 1941. Numerous forced labour camps were established where thousands of Estonians, foreign Jews, Romani, and Soviet prisoners of war perished.[124] German occupation authorities started recruiting men into small volunteer units but, as these efforts provided meagre results and military situation worsened, a forced conscription was instituted in 1943, eventually leading to formation of the Estonian Waffen-SS division.[125] Thousands of Estonians who did not want to fight in the German military secretly escaped to Finland, where many volunteered to fight together with Finns against Soviets.[126] The Red Army reached the Estonian borders again in early 1944, but its advance into Estonia was stopped in heavy fighting near Narva for six months by German forces, including numerous Estonian units.[127] In March, the Soviet Air Force carried out heavy bombing raids against Tallinn and other Estonian towns.[128] In July, the Soviets started a major offensive from the south, forcing the Germans to abandon mainland Estonia in September, with the Estonian islands being abandoned in November.[127] As German forces were retreating from Tallinn, the last pre-war prime minister Jüri Uluots appointed a government headed by Otto Tief in an unsuccessful attempt to restore Estonia's independence.[129] Tens of thousands of people, including most of the Estonian Swedes, fled westwards to avoid the new Soviet occupation.[130] Overall, Estonia lost about 25% of its population through deaths, deportations and evacuations in World War II.[131] Estonia also suffered some irrevocable territorial losses, as the Soviet Union transferred border areas comprising about 5% of Estonian pre-war territory from the Estonian SSR to the Russian SFSR.[132] Second Soviet occupation (1944–1991) Main articles: Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, Occupation of the Baltic states, and Baltic states under Soviet rule (1944–1991) sailing ship filled with refugees Estonian Swedes fleeing the Soviet occupation to Sweden (1944) Thousands of Estonians opposing the second Soviet occupation joined a guerrilla movement known as the \"Forest Brothers\". The armed resistance was heaviest in the first few years after the war, but Soviet authorities gradually wore it down through attrition, and resistance effectively ceased to exist in the mid-1950s.[133] The Soviets initiated a policy of collectivisation, but as farmers remained opposed to it a campaign of terror was unleashed. In March 1949 about 20, Estonians were deported to Siberia. Collectivization was fully completed soon afterwards. [117][134] The Russian-dominated occupation authorities under the Soviet Union began Russification, with hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians and other \"Soviet people\" being induced to settle in occupied Estonia, in a process which eventually threatened to turn indigenous Estonians into a minority in their own native land.[135] In 1945 Estonians formed 97% of the population, but by 1989 their share of the population had fallen to 62%.[136] Occupying authorities carried out campaigns of ethnic cleansing, mass deportation of indigenous populations, and mass colonization by Russian settlers which led to Estonia losing 3% of its native population.[137] By March 1949, 60,000 people were deported from Estonia and 50,000 from Latvia to slave labor camps in Siberia, where death rates were 30%. The occupying regime established an Estonian Communist Party, where Russians were the majority in party membership.[138] Economically, heavy industry was strongly prioritised, but this did not improve the well-being of the local population, and caused massive environmental damage through pollution.[139] Living standards under the Soviet occupation kept falling further behind nearby independent Finland.[135] The country was heavily\n\nmilitarised, with closed military areas covering 2% of territory.[140] Islands and most of the coastal areas were turned into a restricted border zone which required a special permit for entry.[141] That is why Estonia was quite closed until the second half of the 1960s, when gradually Estonians began to watch Finnish television in the northern parts of the country due to a good signal range, thus getting a better picture of the way of life behind the Iron Curtain. Watching Finnish television was unauthorized, but nevertheless it was watched with a special device made for this purpose.[142] The United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and the majority of other Western countries considered the annexation of Estonia by the Soviet Union illegal.[143] Legal continuity of the Estonian state was preserved through the government-in-exile and the Estonian diplomatic representatives which Western governments continued to recognise.[144][145] Restoration of independence Main article: Singing Revolution The blue-black-white flag of Estonia was raised again on the top of the Pikk Hermann tower on February 24, 1989. The introduction of perestroika by the central government of the Soviet Union in 1987 made open political activity possible again in Estonia, which triggered an independence restoration process later known as Laulev revolutsioon (\"Singing revolution\").[146] The environmental Fosforiidisõda (\"Phosphorite war\") campaign became the first major protest movement against the central government. [147] In 1988, new political movements appeared, such as the Popular Front of Estonia, which came to represent the moderate wing in the independence movement, and the more radical Estonian National Independence Party, which was the first non-communist party in the Soviet Union and demanded full restoration of independence.[148] On 16 November 1988, after the first non-rigged multi-candidate elections in half a century, the parliament of Soviet-controlled Estonia issued the Sovereignty Declaration, asserting the primacy of Estonian laws over laws of the Soviet Union. Over the next two years, many other administrative parts (or \"republics\") of the USSR followed the Estonian example, issuing similar declarations.[149][150] On 23 August 1989, about 2 million Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians participated in a mass demonstration, forming the Baltic Way human chain across the three countries.[151] In 1990, the Congress of Estonia was formed as the representative body of Estonian citizens.[152] In March 1991, a referendum was held where 78% of voters supported full independence. During the coup attempt in Moscow, Estonia declared restoration of independence on 20 August 1991.[153] Baltic Way in Estonia Soviet authorities recognised Estonian independence on 6 September, and on 17 September Estonia was admitted into the United Nations.[154] The last units of the Russian army left Estonia in 1994.[155] In 1992 radical economic reforms were launched for switching over to a market economy, including privatisation and currency reform.[156] Estonia has been a member of the WTO since 13 November 1999.[157] 21st century See also: COVID- pandemic in Estonia The foreign ministers of the NATO countries in Tallinn in April 2010 Since regaining independence in 1991, Estonian foreign policy has been aligned with other Western democracies, and in 2004 Estonia joined both the European Union and NATO.[158] On 9 December 2010, Estonia became a member of OECD.[159] On 1 January 2011, Estonia joined the eurozone and adopted the euro, the single currency of EU.[160] Estonia was a member of the UN Security Council 2020–2021.[161] In 2021, during the 2021– Belarus–European Union border crisis, Estonia strengthened its border with Russia by fencing it with 40 kilometres (25 mi) of barbed wire and inviting almost 1,700 reservists to a preparedness exercise.[162][163] In August 2022, half a year later after Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, Estonia began removing Soviet-era monuments, beginning with a T- tank in Narva, saying it was necessary for public order and internal security.[164][165]\n\nranking it 152nd globally out of 172 countries.[182] Estonia Endla Nature Reserve 07 Forest Clearcutting is the dominant logging method in Estonia, used in 95% of total felling. And logging, in part for biomass, is contributing to the devastation of some of the world's most precious conservation areas. Between 2001 and 2019, Estonia's Natura 2000 areas lost more than 120 sq. km., due in part to demand for biomass. Investigations show that companies like Graanul Invest—Europe's biggest pellet producer—and its subsidiaries (including Valga Puu), have clearcut large areas (the size of 17 football fields) of forests in both Estonia's Haanja and Otepää nature reserves. Estonian NGOs also report that industry actively lobbies for the weakening of Estonian regulations protecting these reserves.[183] At the same time, Estonia's current Minister of the Environment Erki Savisaar has announced that the Estonian government intends to dispute Estonia's obligations to reduce logging in accordance with the European Commission's climate package.[184] As a result of loss of biodiversity, there are around 100,000 breeding pairs of birds less in Estonia than in previous years. Approximately half of Estonia's territory is covered with forests, but in fact, only one to two per cent of it can be considered truly natural old-growth forests – the rest is young and managed.[185] Species that need old forest habitats are also not doing well, with lynx and the flying squirrel moved down one endangerment category. Species that require wild meadow habitats are not doing well either.[186] Across Estonia, between 2001 and 2019, Natura 2000 areas lost more than 15,000 hectares (37,000 acres) of forest cover. The last five years account for 80% of that loss. Further alterations to rules in other Estonian national parks are planned. This practice is also being pursued by RMK,[187] the state forest management company, which manages around half of Estonian forests.[188] Haanja Nature reserve where violations of Natura 2000 area logging is taking place. The European Commission recently[when?] initiated infringement proceedings against Estonia for failing to properly implement the environmental impact assessment requirements laid down in EU law when permitting logging at Natura 2000 sites. Foreign media has also drawn attention to increasingly extensive logging in protected Estonian forests. For example, an investigative article published in Ingenioren, a Danish weekly newspaper specializing in engineering topics, highlighted that Estonian and Latvian wood pellets come from Natura 2000 protected areas and the annual increase in felling volumes is due to demand from other countries, including Denmark, for heating with CO2-neutral biomass.[189] The activities of the Estonian Ministry of the Environment directly violate EU measures to restrict protected forests, in particular the requirements and principles of the European Habitats Directive.[190] Amidst the other concern with regards to loss of biodiversity, there are now proposals put forward by the Estonian Ministry of Environment to slash water body shoreline protected zones to 20 meters.[191] The legal amendment, if it were to pass, would particularly affect Estonia's islands, where protected zones are 200 meters from the shore, causing concern in nature conservationists.[192] Politics Main articles: Politics of Estonia, List of political parties in Estonia, and Elections in Estonia Alar Karis President since 2021 Kaja Kallas Prime Minister since 2021 Estonia is a unitary parliamentary republic. The unicameral parliament Riigikogu serves as the legislative and the government as the executive.[193] Estonian parliament Riigikogu is elected by citizens over 18 years of age for a four-year term by proportional representation, and has 101 members. Riigikogu's responsibilities include approval and preservation of the national government, passing legal acts, passing the state budget, and conducting parliamentary supervision. On proposal of the president Riigikogu appoints the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, the chairman of the board of the Bank of Estonia, the Auditor General, the Legal Chancellor, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces.\n\n[194][195] The Government of Estonia is formed by the Prime Minister of Estonia at recommendation of the President, and approved by the Riigikogu. The government, headed by the Prime Minister, represent the political leadership of the country and carry out domestic and foreign policy. Ministers head ministries and represent its interests in the government. Sometimes ministers with no associated ministry are appointed, known as ministers without portfolio.[196] Estonia has been ruled by coalition governments because no party has been able to obtain an absolute majority in the parliament.[193] Toompea Castle pink stucco three-story building with red hip roof The seat of the Parliament of Estonia in Toompea Castle The head of the state is the President who has primarily representative and ceremonial role. There are no referendums on the election of the president, but the president is elected by the Riigikogu, or by a special electoral college.[197] The President proclaims the laws passed in the Riigikogu, and has right to refuse proclamation and return law in question for a new debate and decision. If Riigikogu passes the law unamended, then the President has right to propose to the Supreme Court to declare the law unconstitutional. The President also represents the country in international relations.[193][198] The Constitution of Estonia also provides possibility for direct democracy through referendum, although since adoption of the constitution in 1992 the only referendum has been the referendum on European Union membership in 2003.[199] Estonia has pursued the development of the e-government, with 99 percent of the public services being available on the web 24 hours a day.[200] In 2005 Estonia became the first country in the world to introduce nationwide binding Internet voting in local elections of 2005.[201] In 2019 parliamentary elections 44% of the total votes were cast over the internet.[202] In the most recent parliamentary elections of 2019, five parties gained seats at Riigikogu. The head of the Centre Party, Jüri Ratas, formed the government together with Conservative People's Party and Isamaa, while Reform Party and Social Democratic Party became the opposition.[203] In January 2021 Ratas resigned as prime minister in the wake of a corruption scandal,[204] and Reform Party leader Kaja Kallas became Estonia's first female prime minister. The new government was a two-party coalition between the country's two biggest political parties Reform Party and Centre Party.[205] In July 2022, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas formed a new three-party coalition by her liberal Reform Party, the Social Democrats, and the conservative Isamaa party. Her previous government had lost its parliamentary majority after the centre-left Centre Party left the coalition.[206] Law Main articles: Law of Estonia and Constitution of Estonia Building of the Supreme Court of Estonia in Tartu The Constitution of Estonia is the fundamental law, establishing the constitutional order based on five principles: human dignity, democracy, rule of law, social state, and the Estonian identity.[207] Estonia has a civil law legal system based on the Germanic legal model.[208] The court system has a three-level structure. The first instance are county courts which handle all criminal and civil cases, and administrative courts which hear complaints about government and local officials, and other public disputes. The second instance are district courts which handle appeals about the first instance decisions.[209] The Supreme Court is the court of cassation, and also conducts constitutional review, it has 19 members.[210] The judiciary is independent, judges are appointed for life, and can be removed from office only when convicted by court for a criminal deed.[211] The Estonian justice system has been rated among the most efficient in the European Union by the EU Justice Scoreboard.[212] Foreign relations Main articles: Foreign relations of Estonia and Diplomatic missions of Estonia US President Barack Obama giving a speech in Tallinn (2014) Estonia was a member of the League of Nations from 22 September 1921, and became a\n\n10,000 volunteers in its affiliated organisations.[238][239] Estonia co-operates with Latvia and Lithuania in several trilateral Baltic defence co-operation initiatives. As part of Baltic Air Surveillance Network (BALTNET) the three countries manage the Baltic airspace control center, Baltic Battalion (BALTBAT) has participated in the NATO Response Force, and a joint military educational institution Baltic Defence College is located in Tartu.[240] Estonia joined NATO in 2004. NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence was established in Tallinn in 2008.[241] In response to Russian war in Ukraine, since 2017 a NATO Enhanced Forward Presence battalion battle group has been based in Tapa Army Base.[242] Also part of NATO Baltic Air Policing deployment has been based in Ämari Air Base since 2014.[243] In European Union Estonia participates in Nordic Battlegroup and Permanent Structured Cooperation.[244][245] Since 1995 Estonia has participated in numerous international security and peacekeeping missions, including: Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Kosovo, and Mali.[246] The peak strength of Estonian deployment in Afghanistan was 289 soldiers in 2009.[247] 11 Estonian soldiers have been killed in missions of Afghanistan and Iraq.[248] Administrative divisions Main articles: Administrative divisions of Estonia, Counties of Estonia, Municipalities of Estonia, Boroughs of Estonia, and Populated places in Estonia Administrative divisions of Estonia Estonia is a unitary country with a single-tier local government system. Local affairs are managed autonomously by local governments. Since administrative reform in 2017, there are in total 79 local governments, including 15 towns and 64 rural municipalities. All municipalities have equal legal status and form part of a maakond (county), which is an administrative subunit of the state.[249] Representative body of local authorities is municipal council, elected at general direct elections for a four-year term. The council appoints local government, headed by a mayor. For additional decentralization the local authorities may form municipal districts with limited authority, currently those have been formed in Tallinn and Hiiumaa.[250] Separately from administrative units, there are also settlement units: village, small borough, borough, and town. Generally, villages have less than 300, small boroughs have between 300 and 1000, boroughs and towns have over 1000 inhabitants.[250] Economy Main article: Economy of Estonia A proportional representation of Estonia exports, 2019 As a member of the European Union, Estonia is considered a high-income economy by the World Bank. The GDP (PPP) per capita of the country was $29,312 in 2016 according to the International Monetary Fund.[6] Because of its rapid growth, Estonia has often been described as a Baltic Tiger beside Lithuania and Latvia. Beginning 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th eurozone member state.[251] According to Eurostat, Estonia had the lowest ratio of government debt to GDP among EU countries at 6% at the end of 2010. [252] A balanced budget, almost non-existent public debt, flat-rate income tax, free trade regime, competitive commercial banking sector, innovative e-Services and even mobile- based services are all hallmarks of Estonia's market economy. Estonia produces about 75% of its consumed electricity.[253] In 2011, about 85% of it was generated with locally mined oil shale.[254] Alternative energy sources such as wood, peat, and biomass make up approximately 9% of primary energy production. Renewable wind energy was about 6% of total consumption in 2009.[255] Estonia imports petroleum products from western Europe and Russia. Estonia imports 100% of its natural gas from Russia.[256] Oil shale energy, telecommunications, textiles, chemical products, banking, services, food and fishing, timber, shipbuilding, electronics, and transportation are key sectors of the economy.[257] The ice- free port of Muuga, near Tallinn, is a modern facility featuring good transshipment capability, a high-capacity grain elevator, chill/frozen storage, and new oil tanker off-loading\n\ncapabilities.[citation needed] The railroad serves as a conduit between the West, Russia, and other points.[citation needed] aerial view of high rises at sunset The central business district of Tallinn Because of the global economic recession that began in 2007, the GDP of Estonia decreased by 1% in the 2nd quarter of 2008, over 3% in the 3rd quarter of 2008, and over 9% in the 4th quarter of 2008. The Estonian government made a supplementary negative budget, which was passed by Riigikogu. The revenue of the budget was decreased for 2008 by EEK 6 billion and the expenditure by EEK 3 billion.[258] In 2010, the economic situation stabilised and started a growth based on strong exports. In the fourth quarter of 2010, Estonian industrial output increased by 23% compared to the year before. The country has been experiencing economic growth ever since.[259] According to Eurostat data, Estonian PPS GDP per capita stood at 67% of the EU average in 2008.[260] In 2017, the average monthly gross salary in Estonia was €1221.[261] However, there are vast disparities in GDP between different areas of Estonia; currently, over half of the country's GDP is created in Tallinn.[262] In 2008, the GDP per capita of Tallinn stood at 172% of the Estonian average,[263] which makes the per capita GDP of Tallinn as high as 115% of the European Union average, exceeding the average levels of other counties. The unemployment rate in March 2016 was 6%, which is below the EU average,[261] while real GDP growth in 2011 was 8%,[264] five times the euro-zone average. In 2012, Estonia remained the only euro member with a budget surplus, and with a national debt of only 6%, it is one of the least indebted countries in Europe.[265] Economic indicators Estonia's economy continues to benefit from a transparent government and policies that sustain a high level of economic freedom, ranking 6th globally and 2nd in Europe.[266][267] The rule of law remains strongly buttressed and enforced by an independent and efficient judicial system. A simplified tax system with flat rates and low indirect taxation, openness to foreign investment, and a liberal trade regime have supported the resilient and well-functioning economy.[268] As of May 2018, the Ease of Doing Business Index by the World Bank Group places the country 16th in the world.[269] The strong focus on the IT sector through its e-Estonia program has led to much faster, simpler and efficient public services where for example filing a tax return takes less than five minutes and 98% of banking transactions are conducted through the internet.[270][271] Estonia has the 13th lowest business bribery risk in the world, according to TRACE Matrix.[272] Estonia is a developed country with an advanced, high-income economy that was among the fastest-growing in the EU since its entry in 2004.[273] The country ranks very high in the Human Development Index,[274] and compares well in measures of economic freedom, civil liberties, education,[275] and press freedom.[276] Estonian citizens receive universal health care,[277] free education,[278] and the longest paid maternity leave in the OECD.[279] One of the world's most digitally-advanced societies, [280] in 2005 Estonia became the first state to hold elections over the Internet, and in 2014, the first state to provide e-residency.[281] Historic development Real GDP per capita development of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania In 1928, a stable currency, the kroon, was established. It is issued by the Bank of Estonia, the country's central bank. The word kroon (Estonian pronunciation: [ kro n], \"crown\") is related to that of the other Nordic currenciesˈ ː (such as the Swedish krona and the Danish and Norwegian krone). The kroon succeeded the mark in 1928 and was used until 1940. After Estonia regained its independence, the kroon was reintroduced in 1992.[citation needed] Estonia's GDP growth from 2000 until 2012 Since re-establishing independence, Estonia has styled itself as the gateway between East and West and aggressively pursued economic reform and integration with the West. Estonia's market reforms put it among the economic leaders in the former COMECON area.[citation\n\nby 2016.[298][299] Industry and environment See also: Oil shale in Estonia, Narva Power Plants, and Wind power in Estonia Rõuste wind turbines next to wetland Rõuste wind farm in Lääneranna Parish Food, construction, and electronic industries are currently among the most important branches of Estonia's industry.[citation needed] In 2007, the construction industry employed more than 80,000 people, around 12% of the entire country's workforce. [300] Another important industrial sector is the machinery and chemical industry, which is mainly located in Ida-Viru county and around Tallinn. The oil shale-based mining industry, also concentrated in East Estonia, produces around 90% of the entire country's electricity. [citation needed] Although the number of pollutants emitted has been falling since the 1980s,[301] the air is still contaminated with sulphur dioxide from the mining industry the Soviet Union rapidly developed in the early 1950s. In some areas, coastal seawater is polluted, mainly around the Sillamäe industrial complex.[302] Estonia is dependent on other countries for energy. In recent years, many local and foreign companies have been investing in renewable energy sources.[citation needed] Wind power has been increasing steadily in Estonia and the total current amount of energy produced from wind is nearly 60 MW; another roughly 399 MW worth of projects are currently being developed and more than 2800 MW being proposed in the Lake Peipus area and coastal areas of Hiiumaa.[303][304] [305] Currently[when?], there are plans to renovate some older units of the Narva Power Plants, establish new power stations, and provide higher efficiency in oil shale-based energy production.[306] Estonia liberalised 35% of its electricity market in April 2010; the electricity market as whole was to be liberalised by 2013.[307] Together with Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia, the country considered participating in constructing the Visaginas nuclear power plant in Lithuania to replace the Ignalina nuclear plant.[308][309] However, due to the slow pace of the project and problems with the nuclear sector (like the Fukushima disaster and bad example of Olkiluoto plant), Eesti Energia shifted its main focus to shale oil production, seen as far more profitable.[310] The Estonian electricity network forms a part of the Nord Pool Spot network.[311] Estonia has a strong information technology sector, partly owing to the Tiigrihüpe project undertaken in the mid-1990s, and has been mentioned as the most \"wired\" and advanced country in Europe in the terms of e-Government of Estonia.[312] The 2014 e-residency program began offering those services to non-residents in Estonia. Skype was written by Estonia-based developers Ahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallinn, who had also originally developed Kazaa.[313] Other notable startups that originated from Estonia include Bolt, GrabCAD, Fortumo and Wise (formerly known as TransferWise). It has been reported that Estonia has the highest startups per person ratio in the world.[314] As of January 2022, there are 1,291 startups from Estonia, seven of which are unicorns, equalling nearly 1 startup per 1,000 Estonians.[315][316] Trade Main article: Tallinn Stock Exchange graph of exports in 2010 showing $10,345,000,000 2 percent cars, 12 percent lubricating oil, 3 percent telephone Graphical depiction of Estonia's product exports in 28 colour- coded categories Estonia has had a market economy since the end of the 1990s and one of the highest per capita income levels in Eastern Europe.[317] Proximity to the Scandinavian and Finnish markets, its location between the East and West, competitive cost structure and a highly skilled labour force have been the major Estonian comparative advantages in the beginning of the 2000s (decade). As the largest city, Tallinn has emerged as a financial centre and the Tallinn Stock Exchange joined recently with the OMX system. Several cryptocurrency trading platforms are officially recognised by the government, such as CoinMetro.[318] The current government has pursued tight fiscal policies, resulting in balanced budgets and low public debt. In 2007, however, a large current account deficit and rising inflation put\n\npressure on Estonia's currency, which was pegged to the Euro, highlighting the need for growth in export-generating industries. Estonia exports mainly machinery and equipment, wood and paper, textiles, food products, furniture, and metals and chemical products.[319] Estonia also exports 1 billion kilowatt hours of electricity annually.[319] At the same time Estonia imports machinery and equipment, chemical products, textiles, food products and transportation equipment.[319] Estonia imports 200 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually.[319] Between 2007 and 2013, Estonia received 53 billion kroons (3 billion euros) from various European Union Structural Funds as direct supports, creating the largest foreign investments into Estonia.[320] Majority of the European Union financial aid will be invested into the following fields: energy economies, entrepreneurship, administrative capability, education, information society, environment protection, regional and local development, research and development activities, healthcare and welfare, transportation and labour market.[321] Main sources of foreign direct investments to Estonia are Sweden and Finland (As of 31 December 2016 48%).[322] Demographics Main article: Demographics of Estonia Residents of Estonia by ethnicity (2021)[323] Estonians 69% Russians 23% Ukrainians 2% Belarusians 0% Finns 0% Others 3% Unknown 0% The population of Estonia, from 1960 to 2019, with a peak in 1990. Population of Estonia 1960–2019. The changes are largely attributed to Soviet immigration and emigration.[324] Before World War II, ethnic Estonians made up 88% of the population, with national minorities constituting the remaining 12%.[325] The largest minority groups in 1934 were Russians, Germans, Swedes, Latvians, Jews, Poles, and Finns. The share of Baltic Germans in Estonia had fallen from 5% (~46,700) in 1881 to 1% (16,346) by 1934,[325][326] mainly due to emigration to Germany in the light of general Russification at the end of the 19th century[citation needed] and the independence of Estonia in the 20th century. Between 1945 and 1989, the share of ethnic Estonians in the population resident within the currently defined boundaries of Estonia dropped to 61%, caused primarily by the Soviet occupation and programme promoting mass immigration of urban industrial workers from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, as well as by wartime emigration and Joseph Stalin's mass deportations and executions.[327] By 1989, minorities constituted more than one-third of the population, as the number of non-Estonians had grown almost fivefold. At the end of the 1980s, Estonians perceived their demographic change as a national catastrophe. This was a result of the migration policies essential to the Soviet Nationalisation Programme aiming to russify Estonia – administrative and military immigration of non-Estonians from the USSR coupled with the deportation of Estonians to the USSR.[citation needed] In the decade after the reconstitution of independence, large-scale emigration by ethnic Russians and the removal of the Russian military bases in 1994 caused[citation needed] the proportion of ethnic Estonians in Estonia to increase from 61% to 69% in 2006. Modern Estonia is a fairly ethnically homogeneous country, but this historical homogeneity is a feature of 13 of the country's 15 maakond (counties). The mostly Russian-speaking immigrant population is concentrated in urban areas which administratively belong to two counties. Thus 13 of Estonia's 15 counties are over 80% ethnic Estonian, the most homogeneous being Hiiumaa, where Estonians account for 98% of the population. In the counties of Harju (including the capital city Tallinn) and Ida-Viru, however, ethnic Estonians make up 60% and 20% of the population, respectively. The ethnic Russian immigrant minority makes up about 24% of the country's total population now, but accounts for 35% of the population in Harju county and for a near 70% majority in Ida-Viru county.

The largest minority groups are the various Christian denominations, principally Lutheran and Orthodox Christians, with very small numbers of adherents in non- Christian faiths, namely Judaism, Islam and Buddhism. Other polls suggest the country is broadly split between Christians and the non-religious / religiously undeclared. In ancient Estonia, prior to Christianization and according to Livonian Chronicle of Henry, Tharapita was the predominant deity for the Oeselians.[343] Estonia was Christianised by the Catholic Teutonic Knights in the 13th century. The Protestant Reformation led to the establishment of the Lutheran church in 1686. Before the Second World War, Estonia was approximately 80% Protestant, overwhelmingly Lutheran,[344][345][346] followed by Calvinism and other Protestant branches. Many Estonians profess not to be particularly religious because religion through the 19th century was associated with German feudal rule.[347] There has historically been a small but noticeable minority of Russian Old-believers near the Lake Peipus area in Tartu county. Today, Estonia's constitution guarantees freedom of religion, separation of church and state, and individual rights to privacy of belief and religion.[348] According to the Dentsu Communication Institute Inc, Estonia is one of the least religious countries in the world, with 75% of the population claiming to be irreligious. The Eurobarometer Poll 2005 found that only 16% of Estonians profess a belief in a god, the lowest belief of all countries studied.[349] A 2009 Gallup poll found similar results, with only 16% of Estonians describing religion as \"important\" in their daily lives, making Estonia the most irreligious of the nations surveyed.[350] Ruhnu stave church, built in 1644, is the oldest surviving wooden building in Estonia New polls about religiosity in the European Union in 2012 by Eurobarometer found that Christianity is the largest religion in Estonia accounting for 45% of Estonians.[351] Eastern Orthodox are the largest Christian group in Estonia, accounting for 17% of Estonia citizens,[351] while Protestants make up 6%, and Other Christian make up 22%. Non believer/Agnostic account 22%, Atheist accounts for 15%, and undeclared accounts for 15%.[351] The most recent Pew Research Center, found that in 2015, 51% of the population of Estonia declared itself Christian, 45% religiously unaffiliated —a category which includes atheists, agnostics and those who describe their religion as \"nothing in particular\", while 2% belonged to other faiths.[352] The Christians divided between 25% Eastern Orthodox, 20% Lutherans, 5% other Christians and 1% Roman Catholic.[353] While the religiously unaffiliated divided between 9% as atheists, 1% as agnostics and 35% as Nothing in Particular.[354] Traditionally, the largest religious denomination in the country was Lutheranism, which was adhered to by 160,000 Estonians (or 13% of the population) according to the 2000 census, principally ethnic Estonians.\n\nAccording to the Lutheran World Federation, the historic Lutheran denomination has 180,000 registered members.[355] Other organisations, such as the World Council of Churches, report that there are as many as 265,700 Estonian Lutherans.[356] Additionally, there are between 8,000 and 9,000 members abroad. However, the 2011 census indicated that Eastern Orthodoxy had surpassed Lutheranism, accounting for 16% of the population (176,773 people). Eastern Orthodoxy is practised chiefly by the Russian minority. The Estonian Orthodox Church, affiliated with the Russian Orthodox Church, is the primary Orthodox denomination. The Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church, under the Greek- Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarchate, claims another 20,000 members.[citation needed] Roman Catholics are a small minority in Estonia. They are organised under the Latin Apostolic Administration of Estonia. According to the census of 2000 (data in table to the right), there were about 1,000 adherents of the Taara faith[357][358][359] or Maausk in Estonia (see Maavalla Koda). The Jewish community has an estimated population of about 1,900 (see History of the Jews in Estonia), and the Muslim community numbers just over 1,400. Around 68,000 people consider themselves atheists.[360] Languages Main article: Languages of Estonia Distribution of Finnic languages in Northern Europe The official language, Estonian is a Finnic language, and is conventionally classified as a member of the Uralic language family. Estonian is closely related to Finnish and one of the few languages of Europe that is not of Indo-European origin. Unlike Estonian and Finnish, the languages of their nearest geographical neighbouring countries, Swedish, Latvian, and Russian, are all Indo-European languages. Although the Estonian and Germanic languages are of different origins, one can identify many similar words in Estonian and German. This is primarily because the Estonian language has borrowed nearly one-third of its vocabulary from Germanic languages, mainly from Low Saxon (Middle Low German) during the period of German rule, and High German (including standard German). The percentage of Low Saxon and High German loanwords can be estimated at 22–25 percent, with Low Saxon making up about 15 percent. South Estonian languages are spoken by 100,000 people and include the dialects of Võro and Seto. The languages are spoken in South-Eastern Estonia, are genealogically distinct from northern Estonian: but are traditionally and officially considered as dialects and \"regional forms of the Estonian language\", not separate language(s).[361] Russian is the most spoken minority language in the country. There are towns in Estonia with large concentrations of Russian speakers and there are towns where Estonian speakers are in the minority (especially in the northeast, e. Narva). Russian is spoken as a secondary language by forty- to seventy-year-old ethnic Estonians, because Russian was the unofficial language of the Estonian SSR from 1944 to 1990 and was taught as a compulsory second language during the Soviet era. In the period between 1990 and 1995, the Russian language was granted an official special status according to Estonian language laws.[362] In 1995 it lost its official status. In 1998, most first- and second-generation industrial immigrants from the former Soviet Union (mainly the Russian SFSR) did not speak Estonian.[363] However, by 2010, 64% of non-ethnic Estonians spoke Estonian.[364] The latter, mostly Russian- speaking ethnic minorities, reside predominantly in the capital city of Tallinn and the industrial urban areas in Ida-Viru county. From the 13th to the 20th century, there were Swedish-speaking communities in Estonia, particularly in the coastal areas and on the islands (e., Hiiumaa, Vormsi, Ruhnu; in Swedish, known as Dagö, Ormsö, Runö, respectively) along the Baltic sea, communities which today have almost disappeared. From 1918 to 1940, when Estonia was independent, the small Swedish community was well treated. Municipalities with a Swedish majority, mainly found along the coast, used Swedish as the administrative"
