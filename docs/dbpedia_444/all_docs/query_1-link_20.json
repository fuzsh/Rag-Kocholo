        "text": "The Psalter is the first Belarusian printed book. It is one of the most popular books in Christianity and forms part of the Old Testament. The book origins from the Hebrew Holy Scripture (Tanakh), where it is called תְּהִלִּים (Tehilim) meaning “praises” and is placed in the third part – Ketuvim. While preparing the Greek translation (Septuagint) the book was named “psalms” (Greek: Ψαλμοί) and this name was taken by the majority of other languages (for example, English). The Slavic people called this book Psalter (Church Slavonic: Ψалтирь) in accordance with the name of a musical instrument “psaltery”. In Belarusian lands this book was widely used not just for clerical needs but also for studying and religious-moral upbringing. Probably, such popularity of this book became the reason why Francysk Skaryna chose it as his first edition. On the example of such book it was easy to determine whether his publications would be appreciated by the public. In connection with that he paid close attention to the preparation of this edition. Thus, Belarusian book printing started from very popular edition – Psalter – one of the most respected and emotionally exalted books of the Bible. It opened a wholes series of biblical editions that were prepared and released by Francysk Skaryna in 1517–1519 and laid basis for Belarusian book printing. The date the book was released (or, rather, sent to the printer’s) is known precisely as the publisher indicated it in the edition – August 6, 1517. This date is considered the beginning of the Belarusian book printing. In the Introduction to this book one may read about the importance Francysk Skaryna attributed to the first edition of the Psalter. The enlightener points out that “the Psalter is the only book that includes all these things, teaches and preaches them. For the psalms that it contains are like depository of all spiritual riches”. In poetic form he proves that each and everyone needs Psalter. Understanding the exceptional meaning of the Psalter for educational and religious purposes, the first printer said, “So I, Francysk son of Skaryna from Polack, doctor of medical sciences, seeing a great virtue in such a small book, ordered to print the Psalter with Ruthenian letters (thus Skaryna calls words of the Old Belarusian language – A.S., H.K.) in Slavonic language first of all for the honor of God in Trinity united, His Most Holy and Blessed Mother Virgin Mary and all the God’s saints, and then for common good because I was born among these people by the grace of God”. Here, among other things, we see one of the first patriotic statements about native people and their language in the Belarusian writing. Besides considerations on lofty mission of the Psalter, Francysk Skaryna describes major techniques of producing a book, tells about the system of references used in it, about glosses on the margins containing explanations of words unknown to readers. The mere fact that the edition of a biblical book contained an authorial foreword emphasized its innovatory character. However, the aspiration of Francysk Skaryna to make the book understandable and comprehensible for common people makes the whole thing even more remarkable. The larger part of the first Belarusian edition is occupied by the biblical text translated into Church Slavonic language. Basing on the analysis of its content one may conclude that the book released by Skaryna is a so-called Simple Psalter. The edition includes 151 psalms divided into 20 kathismas. They are added by several biblical songs and prayers of the Old and New Testaments. The edition finishes with a traditional colophon or afterword where publisher’s imprints are given. They are placed on the front side of 142nd sheet and are emphasized with artistic organization of the text. The reverse side of a sheet is left blank. Since it was the first publishing experience of Francysk Skaryna, the given edition slightly differed from his following books. It had smaller type page: 146х85 mm, while the size of the type page in other Prague editions was 161х106 mm. As a result, a page of the Psalter edition contained only 20 lines, while the successive editions had room for 22. The sheets were numbered at the bottom of a page, not at the top as in later editions. Obviously, Skaryna was looking for more perfect artistic form, which would correspond to his authorial conception. His efforts succeeded, none of the previous Cyrillic editions had so rich and perfect artistic decoration as those released by the Belarusian first printer. The Psalter was printed in traditional quarto format that later became traditional for all Skaryna’s Prague editions. The edition consists of 142 sheets (283 pages) divided into 17 eight-page and one six-page gatherings. This is the biggest Prague edition in terms of size. There is a mistake in the sheets numbering: sheet 38 is numbered as “30”. The Psalter is the only Francysk Skaryna’s Prague edition that was printed using paper with watermarks. The Psalter is a monochrome edition: black text and engravings on the white ground. Starting from the Psalter, Skaryna didn’t use traditional for Cyrillic books carry-over words (repetition of first letters or words of the next page in the end of the previous one) and signatures (sheets numbering by gatherings). The artistic decoration of the book included two engravings. The first of them – “King David, the kneeler” – was used twice. On the title sheet under the engraving the title of the book is placed, “Songs of King David, called Psalter”. In the second case the engraving is placed next to the first eight lines of the text opening the first psalm, in the place where usually capital letter is placed. Earlier it was considered that this page is the back of a title sheet. This was connected with the wrong (reverse) placement of a sheet after restoration in the only known copy. Probably, the Prague edition of the Psalter was very popular and became rare during the lifetime of the publisher. In connection with this after his return to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and opening of typography in Vilna Francysk Skaryna first of all republished the Psalter, which formed basis of so-called “Little Travel Book”. That is why it’s safe to say that the endeavour of Francysk Skaryna did not go unnoticed, which inspired him for continuation of his publishing activity. Thus, the Prague Psalter is the rarest of all the books released by Francysk Skaryna. Moreover, both extant copies are not full: the copy form the collection of the National Library of Russia lacks the last sheet and the one from the collection of the State Historical Museum – the first sheet."
