        "text": "Finds of Final Iron Age jewelry and cremated bones show that many medieval parish churches of southern Estonia were founded on Iron Age cemeteries. This shows the active participation of the natives in choosing places for churches during the period of Baltic crusades , as well as high evaluation of the new religion, at least in terms of its afterlife concepts.\n\nThe text presents survey of metal detector investigations on medieval cemetery and chapel site at Loosi, SE Estonia. Large number of offered coins from the 13th-14th cc., incl. coins from the first decades after the conquest and Christianization refers to special status of the site which can be explained by its location at the big trading route from the important centres of Ugandi (Tartu and Otepää) to Pskov and Old Rus areas. Finds from Loosi give a foothold to localize the course of the road in the south-eastern corner of Estonia.\n\nPublished in: \"Archaeological Fieldwork in Estonia\" (volume 2020, published 2021). An annual overview of archaeological fieldwork in Estonia with a comprehensive information on statistics, type of sites and most important results. The previous volumes of the journal are available from here: http://www.arheoloogia.ee/kirjandus/arheoloogilised-valitood-eestis/\n\nabstract: The aim of this article is to compare Estonian burial-related runosongs (regilaul) to archaeological information. I introduce the runosong as a potential source of information about burials to archaeologists and give folklorists a new perspective by addressing the age and practises behind the motifs of runosongs. One runosong may contain elements from different time periods, and for this reason I have concentrated on dating the elements of storylines. However, I have also tried to match the idea of a whole song-type with one or another time period."
