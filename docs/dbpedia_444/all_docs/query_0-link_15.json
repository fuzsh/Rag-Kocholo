        "text": "Two east Lithuanian barrow cemeteries, Baliuliai and Peršaukštis Kasčiukai II, which date to the mid-5th century, are distinguished by a specific pattern of burial orientation. The head appears to generally lie to the west and northwest, which is entirely typical of east Lithuanian barrows. But a closer inspection shows an exceptional feature, i.e. the alignment of the deceased towards a single focal point near the cemetery. The present paper seeks to discuss if this spatial organization was intentional, and if so, what significance the focal point possessed and what views of the afterlife and social objectives might lie behind this mortuary treatment. The grave orientation in both cemeteries is examined, with a certain amount of criticism, in the light of the chronological and territorial contexts. The paper proposes a hypothesis that burial direction is a form of symbolic communication between the living and the dead as well as among the dead within a certain internment area. It suggests that an ancestral tradition was established and maintained through this grave orientation. And it also examines the astronomical framework of the burial directions.\n\nThe present paper maps the methodological positions of European neighbour relations and partnership instrument 2007 - 2013 cross-border cooperation program Latvia - Lithuania - Belarus project ìPopularization of Oral History Centres in the cross-border territory of LV - BY, ID LLB-2-143, studies of cemeteries in the cross-border area between Latvia and Belarus and characterizes their adaptation for the aims and tasks of the given project. Several common and different features of cemeteries in Latvia and Belarus are indicated that are determined by the traditional and contemporary culture trends, national identity traits, religious creed specificity, the soviet period and other factors. The peculiarities of cemeteries in the border area between Latvia and Belarus are compared to those of other regions in Latvia, framing the polemical character of the collected material. Key words: cemetery culture, area studies, commemoration, border zone, fieldwork, cemetery, necropolis, communal cemetery, rural cemetery, urban cemetery, cemetery festival, grave, tombstone, ritual\n\nThis paper through a use of syntactic descriptive tools explores a presence of Catholic morphological implications that are discreetly woven into the organic spatial con guration of Bernardines cemetery – culturally and historically signi cant a orested scape. A case study is approached as a sum of internal connections, able to communicate attitudes to death and memory in the nineteenth-century Vilnius, Lithuania. The article involves overlaying axial network, topography, burial directions and chronological occupation data over each other, aiming at understanding correlation between them, and how they help to explain the con guration of unplanned burial ground. Bernardines cemetery functioned as a suburban branch of overcrowded churchyard burial ground that was in need of extension. A chapel was built 15 years after cemetery foundation. Even today chapel is a central gure in the spatial composition of Catholic cemeteries – in Bernardines cemetery the centrality of the chapel is not that apparent. After processing topographical and syntactical analysis it was possible to detect network’s structural potential gathered around the chapel, its con gurative relation to the burial directions and the location on the highest altitudes of the whole plot. In this case spatiality of religious hierarchy was implemented discreetly, but a tight dialogue with the natural terrain enabled Catholic cemetery to be identi ed with a pagan forest necropolis.\n\nEuropean burial grounds suffered a great shift in the 19th century: hygienic strategies of city development brought them to be outside of the city cores. A new model of cemetery handed a right to memory for those social classes that were sentenced to forgetting before: it was the time of the rise of the individual. Following garden development – from hortus conclusus to an open landscape – first through the use of the false funeral monuments in the gardens, then placing real tombs in natural milieu (for example, a tomb of Jean-Jacques Rousseau in Île des Peupliers in Ermenonville) – people got accustomed to see death in the garden and burial spaces acquired Edenic expression. Lithuania was the very last European country to accept Christianity; all the territory was only Christianised in the beginning of the 15th century. Therefore this article approaches burial grounds in Lithuania as places where pagan culture meets recent Christian attitudes and concerns. The first trigger for this research was an urge to identify elements of pagan beliefs in spatial solutions of Lithuanian cemeteries. In order to decode a morphogenetic identity of Lithuanian burial grounds, two 19th-century cemeteries in Vilnius, Lithuania, were approached from a syntactic point of view taking into account the mythological references of Christianity and Baltic paganism. The spatial texture of two cemeteries – Rasos and Bernardines - is analysed and compared, by interpreting it as a system of accessibility axes. Configurative relations are used to inform morphological analysis by identifying their architectural character and cultural identity as well as relating them to the pagan imaginaries of the afterlife. To understand the spatial reality of the cemeteries, observations of the movement have been carried out, helping to construct simple graphs of cemeteries’ plans, significant for genotype definition. Through the configurative relations it was possible to confirm a premise that the two burial grounds studied in the paper are symbolically-organic spaces, which could have evolved in the sequence of the pagan custom to bury in the wilderness – places associated with abode of gods and the dwelling places of dead. https://thanatos-journal.com/2016/12/21/thanatos-vol-5-22016/"
