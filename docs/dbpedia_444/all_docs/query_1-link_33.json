        "text": "Järva County (Estonian: Järva maakond), or Järvamaa (German: Jerwen, Latin: Jervia), is one of 15 counties of Estonia. It is situated in central part of the country and borders Lääne-Viru County to the east, Jõgeva County to the south-east, Viljandi County to the south, Pärnu County to the south-west, Rapla County to the west, and Harju County to the north. 36,130 people live in Järva County – constituting 2.7% of the total population in Estonia (as of January 2009).[1]\n\nContents\n\n1 History\n\n2 County Government\n\n3 Municipalities\n\n4 References\n\n5 External links\n\nHistory\n\nIn the first centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (kihelkond) and the county (maakond). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major districts had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Osilia), Läänemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), Rävala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), Järvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia).[2]\n\nCounty Government\n\nThe County Government (Estonian: Maavalitsus) is led by Governor (Estonian: maavanem), who is appointed by the Government of Estonia for a term of five years. Since 2009, the Governor position is held by Tiina Oraste.\n\nMunicipalities\n\nThe county is subdivided into municipalities. There is 1 urban municipality (Estonian: linnad – towns) and 11 rural municipalities (Estonian: vallad – parishes) in Järva County.\n\nUrban municipality:\n\nPaide\n\nRural municipalities:\n\nAlbu Parish\n\nAmbla Parish\n\nImavere Parish\n\nJärva-Jaani Parish (includes the borough of Järva-Jaani)\n\nKareda Parish\n\nKoeru Parish\n\nKoigi Parish\n\nPaide Parish\n\nRoosna-Alliku Parish\n\nTüri Parish (includes the town of Türi)\n\nVäätsa Parish\n\nReferences\n\nOfficial website"
