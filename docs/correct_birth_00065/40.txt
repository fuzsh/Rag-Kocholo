The Ancestors of Tupac Shakur (1971-1996) by Christopher Challender Child

The following material on the immediate ancestry of Tupac Shakur should not be considered either exhaustive or definitive, but rather as a first draft.

The information was largely derived from Look for me in the Whirlwhind: the Collective Autobiography of the New York 21 (1971), by (among others) Kuwasi Balagoon, Lumumba Shakur, Afeni Shakur, Clark Squire, and Jamal Joseph; and from Afeni Shakur, Evolution of a Revolutionary, (2004) by Jasimine Guy.

The primary contribution of the undersigned is that of HTML-izing Mr. Child's work.

NOTES &nbsp

&nbsp

&nbsp

&nbsp

&nbsp

&nbsp

The name Shakur (Arabic for "thankful to God") was first taken as a surname by the father of Lumumba Shakur, Mr. Coston, after joining the Nation of Islam in the 1960's. The name was then taken by several close of friends of Lumumba Shakur, including his wife Afeni (who had been given her first name Afeni by a Yoruba priestess), Afeni's later husband Mutulu, Lumumba's brother Zayd Malik Shakur (born James F. Coston) and Zayd's close friend Assata Shakur (born JoAnne Deborah (Byron) Chesimard). Zayd Shakur, Assata Shakur, and Sundiata Accoli (born Clark Edward Squire, another of the New York 21) were involved in a shootout with state troopers in New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1973 that left Zayd and an officer Werner Foerster dead. Sundiata and Assata were both convicted and given life sentences, Assata Shakur later escaped to Havana, Cuba, where she is currently (2005) a professor and has been granted political asylum by Fidel Castro. She wrote her autobiography Assata in 1987. Mutulu Shakur's charges included helping in the escape of Assata Shakur. &nbsp

&nbsp

1 -- Several Internet sources claim that Tupac's original name at birth was Lesane Parish Crooks and had been changed to Tupac Amaru Shakur shortly after his birth in 1971. The source and accuracy of this statement is not clear. This is not claimed in Afeni Shakur's biography. &nbsp
