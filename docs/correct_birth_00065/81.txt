OAKLAND, Calif. (KGO) -- Oakland is showing "California Love" to Tupac Shakur by renaming a stretch of one of its most prominent streets after the late rap legend.

"And so I'm proud to be here today to be part of the street naming ceremony. I see murals all over the world of Tupac. Was only right that we have a street named after him, correct?" said Sway Calloway, popular radio personality and Oakland native. "So let's celebrate today with the Shakur family. And thank you. Your family has been through a lot. And still you stand here strong."

Tupac's sister was at Friday morning's renaming ceremony.

MacArthur Boulevard between Grand Avenue and Van Buren Avenue is now "Tupac Shakur Way."

Shakur was born in New York City and grew up in Baltimore before his mom moved their family to Marin City.

But his career took off in Oakland, where he first worked with the hip-hop group Digital Underground.
