        "text": "Tupac Amau Shakur was born on June 16, 1971. He was raised in a very political family, both parents were active supporters of the Black Panther Party. He started his young career at a small school in Harlem. Tupac lived in the very rough parts of the Harlem, New York. This helped build his strong character. When Tupac was a teen he moved to Baltimore and took acting classes and even Ballet classes. in the 1980’s he later moved to California and that is what started his rapping career. The year 1991 was a very big one for “2Pac” he set out his debit album “2pacalypse Now”.\n\nTupac Shakur was born on June 16th, 1971, with the name Lesane Crooks. His name was switched to Tupac Amaru II almost a year later. He was born in New York and lived primarily in Harlem till he was 13. In 1984 he moved to Baltimore where he lived for four years until he moved to Oakland. When he was younger he struggled in life because his family was poor and had to move. Mostly Everyone in Tupac’s life was part of the Black Panther\n\nIn the same fashion that Elvis defined Rock ‘n’ Roll; Tupac Shakur defined the hip-hop music scene, as we know it today. What made Tupac (also known as 2Pac, or Makaveli) so special were his enormous talent, his on screen friendly looks, and the sense that he was “real” and talked the talk, while walking the walk. Tupac was born on June 16, 1971, Tupac Amaru Shakur. He was named after Tupac Amaru, the Inca Indian that was sentenced to death by the Spaniards. He was originally from Brooklyn, New York. Tupac spent a lot of time moving around as he was growing up. He was the son of a Black Panther activist Afeni Shakur and Billy Garland. Tupac moved from Harlem, to Baltimore, to Oakland. The constant moving caused Tupac to fit into his new\n\nMusic can rock your world, enlighten your mind and change your perspective. When you think of rap music who comes first to mind? Without hesitation, it must be the self acclaimed best rapper alive, Lil Wayne. He alone can make such statements as “My picture should be in the dictionary next to the definition of definition” (Wayne, “Shoot Me Down”). Lil Wayne is a prominent force in the rap world. His debut Album in 1999, Tha Block is Hot went double platinum upon its release and even his lowest selling album is still certified as gold according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Rollingstone Magazine declares “Lil Wayne is one of the most popular — and prolific — recording artists in the world” (Kreps). Top this with\n\nHe selected his alias to be Makaveli, though spelled differently, is a pseudonym for the 16th century Italian philosopher Nicolo Machiavelli. Machiavelli wrote a book titled The Prince, in which the main character fakes his death in order to fool his enemies. 2Pac studied Machiaveli in depth while in prison, was a fan, and had read his books several times. Perhaps Tupac was taking his advice? He certainly has enemies on the East coast, most of who are connected to Bad Boy Entertainment, a rival of Death Row. In 1994, 2Pac was shot five times in New York City while he was on his way to the studio, and he claimed that Bad Boy had something to do with the failed hit. In any case, his name change became fully complete on his posthumous album, where he states in the booklet, \"Exit: 2Pac, Enter: Makaveli.\" An eerie three-fingered handprint also appears on the inside of the Makaveli booklet. Tupac had two of his fingers shot off during the September 7th shooting. Is it coincidence? It is strange that an autopsy was never performed on the body (since when don't you autopsy a murder victim?), and 2Pac's family reportedly cremated his body the day after he died. No one outside of the family has seen Tupac's dead body, other than the doctors, who could have easily been paid off with Tupac's riches. These actions, both before and after the shooting, are strange and point to the fact that Tupac Amaru Shakur is still alive.\n\nTupac “2Pac” Shakur was, and remains, one of the most popular rappers of all time. He was born in Harlem, New York City on June 16,1971, But his real name is “Lesane Parish Crooks” but later then, his mother changed his name to ‘Tupac Shakur’, Tupac Shakur is a gifted, talented, parionad soul and was very careful of what kind of friends he would choose to hang around with and would only trust people that were close to him and loyal towards him, but When he was just a teenager, his mother, ‘Afeni shakur’, used to tell him 'If you can't find somethin' to live for, you best find somethin' to die for”. But fate drove himself into rapping and He had the words \"thug life\" tattooed across his abdomen and has a Nostril piercing. He was an American rapper and actor and wrote\n\nFor most people that listen to music, a song can be classified as simply a plethora of words constructed into verses in the midst of an appealing tune playing in the backdrop. But it is when an artist can take all of this and add even more to it to make it memorable and even sometimes controversial he or she is considered a great artist. Perhaps one of the most misunderstood rap, along with hip hop artist of the 20th century is the late Tupac Shakure. ... However, to his fans and critics, he was perceived as a political poet and a lyrical genius. Though I wasn’t supposed to, I have listened to Pac since I was a child...and Ill have to\n\nAfter Tupac’s death, in 1996, his body was cremated AND members of the group Outlawz smoked some of his ashes in honor of him, HOWEVER, his mother Afeni Shakur spread his ashes in Soweto, South Africa on his 36th birthday. Although he has been deceased for over a decade he has sold over 75 million albums AND on April 7, 2017 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame EVEN THOUGH some rappers opposed Tupac being inducted over LL Cool J BUT Tupac reigned and received the prestigious title. Many say Tupac accomplished more in death than life BECAUSE in June 2017 a movie called All Eyez On Me will be released; a praiseworthy addition to the greatest rapper of all time legacy.
