        "text": "Tupac Shakur Tupac Shakur was a lyrical genius when it came to rapping his feelings about subjects, he was one of the bestselling music artists of all time (Rolling Stone) and yet he was taken from us too early at the young age of 25 while partying in Las Vegas. This story is one that shows how a young musician with so much talent can be taken into the rap culture and enveloped by it, towards the end of his life Shakur produced hundreds of songs ensuring that after his death records would be released for many years. Some say he was crazy and some say he was just misunderstood but either way Tupac was an artist that changed the rap game and continues to influence bilingual rappers to the current day. His work and songs still make it into popular culture and will continue for many years to come. His childhood and upbringing are what made him who he was while also influencing the language and culture used in his music. The locations and personal influences are what inspired him to get into the rap game. Tupac’s childhood and upbringing were heavily influenced by his parents and their ideals regarding the Black Panthers, and criminal activity. Many members of his immediate family were either convicted or charged with crimes and all spoke heavy Ebonic influence in their speech. Also growing up in the East Harlem his childhood was based on the street education. He was an avid reader however and enjoyed many styles of classical literature and this is what led him to join and perform in the 127th Street Repertory Ensemble where he learned how to act and also where he began his rap career. He not only succeeded at his new school but also was the starring role in plays like the Nutcracker and A Raisin in the Sun. These influences helped h... ... middle of paper ... ...ged into many situations that probably were detrimental to his health in the long run and created enemies that are what potentially were what caused him his death. Tupac’s music is what I have always enjoyed and is why I chose to pick him for this assignment, he is not just a typical rapper in my opinion and I have enjoyed learning more about him. The biggest thing that I learned about him were the circumstances in his death, It is very similar to the Elvis conspiracy how people believe he is still alive and I believe this is because people had such an emotional connection with him that they feel they can’t let that go. People loved or hated Tupac but he changed many people’s lives regardless of that, he was a saint and a sinner but he will be remembered through his work. Tupac is a hero to me for bringing about this change and bringing awareness to these problems."
