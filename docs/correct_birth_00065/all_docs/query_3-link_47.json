Biography on Tupac Shakur Essay Biography on Tupac Shakur In much the same fashion that Kurt Cobain defined the alternative rock music scene, Tupac Shakur defined the hip–hop scene as we know it today. What made Tupac (also known as 2pac) so special was his enormous talent, his on–screen friendly looks, and the sense that he was 'real' and talked the talk, while walking the walk. Since his death, there's been a deluge of speculation on who and why, and even if, but unfortunately still no concrete answers exist for any of these questions. Born June 16, 1971, Tupac Amaru Shakur, who was named after Tupac Amaru, the Inca Indian that was sentenced to death by the Spaniards, was originally a newborn from Brooklyn, New York. He later was transplanted and grew most of his...show more content... His main notoriety though was through music, and he followed up his successful debut with Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. in 1993, which also was a crossover pop success. In 1995 he released Me Against the World and his last living album release came with All Eyez on Me in 1996. Shakur's post–celebrity run–ins with the law were almost as frequent as when he was growing up. In 1992 he was arrested when a stray bullet killed a 6 year old child during a scuffle between Shakur and two others, though later charges against Shakur were dropped. In 1993 Tupac was arrested for allegedly shooting 2 off–duty Butts County Atlanta police officers who were harassing a black motorist, but the charges were again dropped. Ironically, one of the Butts County officers was shot in the ass, and in 1998 Deputy Scott Whitwell won a $210,000 lawsuit for the incident. Then, that same year, Tupac was accused of sexual abuse against a 19 year old woman in a New York City luxury hotel. Shakur's legal troubles continued in 1994 when he punched out Menace II Society codirector Allen Hughes and served a 15 day jail sentence for his actions. The sexual charge came to haunt Shakur in that 1994 as he was convicted and sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison, and to add insult to injury, Shakur was shot 5 times and robbed of his jewelry the same day, a mugging that Shakur later claimed came from the Notorious B.I.G. was responsible for hiring those who shot Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n2. Commemorative Manuscript on Tupac Shakur Essay Commemorative Manuscript on Tupac Shakur Central theme: Tupac was a very misunderstood individual, and a lot can be learned from his life. 1.When most people hear the name Tupac, they think of a tattooed thug, a gangsta rapper killed in a tragic shooting who only got what was coming to him, a man who lived by the gun, and who died by the gun. However, those people probably have never taken a chance to look beyond what their eyes tell them, past the ignorance and into the depths of the man who really was Tupac. 2.Tupac Shakur was born on September 17, 1971, in Brooklyn New York. Tupac got into acting early in his life, landing his first role in an acting ensemble when he was 12 years old. Tupac also began writing many poems...show more content... Over the next five years, Tupac enjoyed a lot of success in both the rap industry and as an actor. He released four more albums including raps first ever double CD, all going multiple platinum. He also acted in three movies earning high remarks from directors and actors. However, for the first half of this successful solo career, Tupac continued to go further off track. He was arrested several times over the next three years, but was acquitted of every crime. In 1993, he was arrested for the last time, but while on trial, he was shot five times during an alleged robbery. Tupac underwent surgery and checked himself out of the hospital two hours after that. Tupac was still on trial however, and this time earned a four and a half year sentence on February 14, 1995. During April of that year, Tupac conducted an interview with Vibe magazine, in which he renounced the life that he had been living and promised to do nothing but positive works from then on. On October of 95, record company CEO signed Tupac to a record deal and then posted bond for Tupac. Tupac immediately began work on what would be his last album, All Eyez On Me, which was released on February 13, 1996. Tupac also began to live up to his promise that he made in prison, performing many charitable acts and staying away from the things that had previously gotten him into trouble. His rap music also began to carry a message of hope for those who grew up on the streets. 6.Around this Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n3. Tupac Shakur 's `` Keep Ya Head Up `` Tupac Shakur released the song \"Keep Ya Head Up\" first in 1993 on his album \"Strictly for my N.I.G.G.A.Z.\", then as a single in 1994. Tupac's \"Keep Ya Head Up\", one of his most notable and recognizable singles, received acclaim upon its release and continues to do so. The record centers on the social climate in the 90's, and Tupac's own experiences from his youth. Around the time of the song's release, Tupac's indictment in a rape case colored the reception of the song although it remained mainly positive. Tupac speaks on multiple issues through his lyrics, making it effective as a critique of society; moreover, the other creative devices he uses – phrasing, rhythm changes, and samples – make the song effective as an artistic project and back up his social message. Tupac's rhymes and phrases center on the treatment of women (especially black women) in America. The video also includes a dedication to Latasha Harlins, who died at the hands of a Korean shop owner in 1991. Underneath the dedication, reads \"it's still on\" in reference to the L.A. riots in 1992 (Genius 2010). This song speaks about the treatment of women, life in the ghetto, and society 's disregard for the poor. Tupac repeatedly tells women that they deserve better treatment and that they should not allow themselves to feel defeated by their circumstances. He exclaims the phrase \"Keep ya head up\" at the end of each verse. Also, in the song he asserts his disdain for men who emotionally abuse women and leave Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n4. Tupac Essay Tupac When thinking of the Hip–Hop industry, one of the first names that comes to mind is Tupac Shakur. Shakur was born in the Bronx on June 16, 1971. He was reared by his mother Afeni Shakur who was an active member of the Black Panthers. Tupac's family later relocated to Oakland, California, where he spent much of his time on the street. As a kid, he was always getting himself into trouble, and he was very lonely. He started writing songs to keep himself out of trouble. An article from VIBE magazine \"Troubled Times forTupac Shakur\" quotes Tupac. \"'I was lonely, I didn't have no big brothers, no big cousins until later. I could remember writing songs.... I remember writing poetry.' \" 1 Tupac was talented in the areas of ...show more content... He was arrested in Los Angeles for carrying a concealed weapon, was implicated in the shooting deaths of two undercover policemen and was convicted of sexual assault. In November 1994, in a much publicized incident, Shakur was shot four times while entering a New York recording studio and robbed of $40, 000 in jewelry. The following month he was sentenced to prison for the sexual assault conviction. After spending eight months in jail, his case was appealed and head of Death Row Records, Suge Knight, bailed Tupac out of jail. This also brought about the opportunity to sign him with Death Row Records. In 1996, Tupac released his last album All Eyez on Me. The album was the beginning of his career with Death Row. In an MTV interview with Tupac, Kurt Loder, a journalist from the source said: Tupac turned his troubles to a career that was bigger than ever. His double Album... \"All Eyes on Me,\" sold more than five million copies, scored a number one single and included tracks with Snoop Doggy Dogg, and Dr. Dre. With three years past since Snoop's last solo release.... Tupac became Death Row's artistic centerpiece, as well as its biggest mouthpiece. 3 Tupac loved his life with Death Row Records; during his time with the label, he was at the epitome of his career. One thing that Death Row and Tupac had in common was animosity toward the New York based record label Bad Boy Entertainment. This label included artists such as Sean \"Puffy\" Combs Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n5. Essay On Tupac Tupac Shakur was a sensitive, precociously talented yet troubled soul who came to embrace the 1990s gangsta–rap aesthetic and paid the ultimate price – he was gunned down in Las Vegas on September 7, 1996 and died six days later. His murder has never been solved. He began his music career as a rebel with a cause – to articulate the travails and injustices endured by many African–Americans, often from a male point of view. His skill in doing so made him a spokesperson not just for his own generation, but for subsequent ones who continue to face the same struggle for equality. In death he became an icon symbolizing noble struggle, though in life his biggest battle was sometimes with himself. As fate drove him towards the nihilism of gangsta...show more content... It was from Sekiya 's father, another Panther called Mutulu Shakur, that the rapper took his surname – though Mutulu did not stick around either. A single mother of two children, Afeni struggled for money and they moved homes often, sometimes staying in shelters. They moved to Baltimore, and Tupac enrolled at the prestigious Baltimore School for the Arts, at which he felt \"the freest I ever felt.\" But their neighborhood was riven by crime, so the family moved again, this time to Marin City in California, which turned out to be a \"mean little ghetto\" according to Robert Sam Anison 's comprehensive posthumous feature on Tupac for Vanity Fair in 1997. It was in Marin City that Afeni succumbed to crack addiction– a drug her son, Tupac, would sell on the same streets as his mother bought her supply. But Tupac 's love for hip hop would steer him away from a life of crime (for a while at least). At 17, in the spring of 1989, he met an older white woman, Leila Steinberg, in a park, and they struck up a conversation about Winnie Mandela. Steinberg would later recall \"a young man with fan–like eyelashes, overflowing charisma, and the most infectious laugh.\" By the time they met, Tupac was obsessively writing poetry (\"The world moves fast and it would rather pass u by / than 2 stop and c what makes you cry,\" is one verse from around that time and would eventually be published in the 2000 book The Rose that Grew from Concrete). He convinced Steinberg, who had no Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n6. Tupac Shakur Tupac Shakur – His Impact on American Culture Tupac Shakur was a very influential person in the 20th century. He was born on June 16, 1971 in Brooklyn New York, and died on September 13, 1996 in Las Vegas Nevada (unknown author, no title, no page, letter code C). But his family moved around a lot while he was a kid (Bastin, J.D.). He eventually ended up in the Bay Area California alone and spent his first two years there homeless (unknown author, no title, n.p., letter code D). He grew up with only his mom and loved her very much. He even wrote a song called Dear Mama to his mom and thanked her for how she tried her best at raising him. His public career started when he joined the seminal Bay Area rap ensemble (u.a., \"original...show more content... This is an influence because since people want to be like him, they will follow his beliefs. And if Tupac believes in non–racism, then the people will believe in that too. This is a big difference from him and other rap artists. A lot of others are racist to different people, and the different people then don't like him, don't listen to his music, don't see his movies, and aren't influenced by him. Almost all races listen to Tupac's music. I've known Mexican, White, Black, Asian, Indian, and even Pakistani people who listened to his music and are influenced and are moved by him. I've even saw a show in Singapore about music here and a Singaporean kid said he listens to Tupac. Tupac has a lot of self–values that he follows. He even said it's hard sometimes, but he keeps it up. He said \"To me it's really troubling because I look over what's successful – Marky Mark, Hammer, Vanilla Ice, New Kids on the Block selling twenty–two million copies, and I want that so badly, but I can't do that. I would be wrong to do that, knowing what I know and having the brain that I have, for me to even go and write some simple *censored* would be wrong even though I would get paid and I would get more people's money.\" (Patrick, Tony, n.p.) This means that Tupac has a strong will and values. He resisted the temptation to write some easy rhyming words and get peoples money. He instead followed his values and worked\n\n7.

The famous phrase, 'never judge a book by its cover' applies to Tupac's own personality and character. A first look at Tupac and you see darkness, you see a violent man with no purpose or direction in his life. Then you look deeper inside him, you step into his shoes and see a kind, caring, but very confused man. Tupac's life story is like any other typical 'thug' lifestyle. Yet, he had accomplished what no other rapper had accomplished before, realism. ?You know, I have read this report, and this young man seems to me to be absolutely remarkable? stated by a judge in one of Tupac?s hearings. (Dyson...show more content... Tupac?s lifestyle was definitely not like the great Martin Luther King Jr. or the kind Pope John Paul II. He was convicted of several serious criminal charges (though he claims it was a set up) including rape, weapon possession, and deliberately hitting a fan just because she kindly asked him for an autograph. Those were just a few, neither the media nor do I know about the other ?minor? criminal charges against him before his rap career. How many times though do we make mistakes? Should we be judged by the influence we get from the lives we are forced to live in, like Tupac was? To get the money and attention the media will make a big deal out of the negative side of any artist so it is easy to mistaken an artist for whom they really are (?Lexus? www.4freeessays.com) This is exactly why so many of Tupac?s fans supported him in whatever he did because they knew (if they ever experienced pain in their life) how hard it is to live a good life when you live in such a negative one. Take a look on the other side of the mirror and look into Tupac?s heart. What do you see? Some will see ?just another rapper trying to be hardcore? (Light 88). I see a young man struggling with his life and desperately trying to change. Tupac hid most of his ?other side? in himself; even in interviews he wouldn?t admit that he wasn?t so ?gangsta? after all. Various situations proved this, ?One time we were driving around L.A. in his new Rolls Royce, he had The Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n9.

One of their hits include the song \"All Around the World ( The Same Song) in 1989. In 1991 Tupac's multi–talented skills are displayed in the field of motion pictures. Shakur starred along with Omar Epps in the blockbuster \"Juice\". The movie was about four friends bound for a tragic end. This foreshadowed with the relationship with the Notorious B.I.G. Among his other films have been'93s Poetic Justice and '94s blockbuster hit \"Above The Rim\". He starred with Dwayne Martin and Marlon Wayans.

Through his early elementary school days, young Christopher was known for misbehaving, and was kicked out of most of the schools he attended. This led him to a later life of selling drugs and a few misdemeanors and jail time. During those years he was known as a comedian, and sometimes freestyled1 to his friends. Big Syke also picked up Christopher Wallace, along with Tupac and many others. Biggie's2 lyrical style consisted of loud yelling and hard–core lyrics that appealed to fans.

Tupac Shakur The Life and Death of Tupac Tupac Amaru Shakur, a gangster rapper and actor who was very successful, was shot several times on September 9, 1996. He died nearly a week later on September 15, 1996 after being in a coma for days. Shakur was like most rappers in the early to mid 90's. He partied, drank, smoked, and was in and out of jail. A large portion of his career was spent in a \"battle\" between the east coast (New York) and the west coast (California). Many believe this is a cause for his assassination, but this has yet to be proven. Tupac Shakur's death was untimely due to his asset to the music industry and his flourishing career, but many believe that his death was timely due to his feud with an old friend, Christopher Wallace. In his early life Shakur was born in Baltimore but in his teen years moved to Los Angeles with his mother. He was born to two black panthers (Anson para. 6). While in Baltimore Shakur attended the Baltimore School of the Arts where he first began acting and writing poetry. He also would rap at school. Shakur originally wanted to be an actor and was intrigued by things such as Shakespeare and ballet which is why he attended the arts school in Baltimore. This school gave him a new experience which in turn made him the talented lyricist he is known to be today. During his last years of high school he and his mother moved to...show more content...

Analysis Of Tupac Shakur 's Song, Dear Mama The struggles of a single mother is not something everyone will fully understand. In the late 90's there was huge poverty and gang violence in Los Angeles, California where Tupac grew up. Many of his songs reflect on how his experience was in this environment. In Tupac Shakur's song, \"Dear Mama\" found in album, Me Against the World, for a single mother to show love for her child takes a huge struggle, especially when it was a time where gang violence was really high and fathers would leave their children. Throughout the song Tupac uses imagery to capture the feeling of pain and struggle and fluently illustrate the moments where he was young, until he grew up and realized the love his mother gave him. \"Dear Mama\" is also portrayed as a...show more content... The song implements on the hardships a mother will face for the growth of their son because love is what keeps them going. The love a mother will have for her son means that even though they don't have a father figure around to show them how to grow up, they will always have their mothers to teach them the way of life through a woman's perspective. In the song, \"Dear Mama\", Tupac mentions, \"For a woman it ain't easy trying to raise a man, you always was committed\" and he is able to foreshadow the hardships his mother had to face while Tupac was growing up without a father. At the age of seventeen Tupac, was always caught up in drama with his mom. Since Tupac was young he got involved into the hustle and was left in the streets where he basically had to risk he life every day. He never realized that being pushed into the streets would make him think about his mother or even worry about her. Tupac reflects upon the behavior he had during the time and how much stress he would add on his mother's shoulders, but little did he know that his mother would be there for him regardless. Tupac Shakur's mom was committed to his son and no matter the troubles he caused and faced she would be there for him to either help him out or at least hear him when he was not feeling good. She was a single mother on welfare, but she always tried Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n13. tupacs music Essays MUSIC ANALYSIS: Changes by Tupac Shakure For most people that listen to music, a song can be classified as simply a plethora of words constructed into verses in the midst of an appealing tune playing in the backdrop. But it is when an artist can take all of this and add even more to it to make it memorable and even sometimes controversial he or she is considered a great artist. Perhaps one of the most misunderstood rap, along with hip hop artist of the 20th century is the late Tupac Shakure. ...

Tupac has released around 15 albums and an uncountable amount of underground tracks. I have chosen to look at one of Tupac's song that I think is the most concentrated on Black and White race relations in America. This song is called Changes, this song was released on his Greatest hits CD in 1998. In this song Tupac addresses this issue he begins the second verse with the lines; \"And still I see no changes all I see is racist faces....\" (verse2). This verse is very powerful in that it addresses political racial issues, society's justice system and how things in society are set up in a way that blacks will remain at the bottom of society and how that is accepted as the norm. He addresses in this verse the American presidency and how we aren't ready to see a black man occupy the white house. Tupac says \"we aint ready to see a black president.....huu\" (verse2) I interpret this as him using sarcasm in that he laughs at the end and uses the term \"we\" when in all reality he knows that the majority of blacks in the U.S. are patiently waiting for that day. In his first verse Pac also addresses the law enforcement issues based on racial inequalities in our society. He addresses the fact that the life of and African American is not Get more content on HelpWriting.net\n\n14. Tupac Shakur Impact On Society For those unfamiliar with the deceased master of ceremony, Tupac Shakur definitely had a unique upbringing. While still in the womb, he was a part of the Panther 21 Trial, in which his mother Afeni Shakur represented and achieved acquittal of all Black Panther Party members accused of a series of New York bombings. One has to consider the impact of this event in proper context: A black 1970s woman and member of a \"militant\" organization actively sought after by government program COINTELPRO, with no more education than high school, won the freedom of not only her but also twenty others in her same predicament, while still pregnant. If your mother accomplished such a feat while you, and all the accompanying pregnancy side effects, ravaged her...show more content... For instance, in (often unaired) interviews he frequently spoke on the responsibility of celebrities to utilize their prerogative for the common good, and He didn't just mean giving some hollow statement on a social issue. Tupac Shakur believed it was the duty of those in any position of power to inflict progress, and his most eminent example of this was his role in the 1992 Truce Picnic. At this event, Shakur was instrumental in getting members of rivaling Blood and Crip gangs to sign a truce enumerating their permitted business conduct. Major highlights of the Code of Thug Life included a no ratting clause, a dual effort to promote street life loyalty and reduce the number of reprisals on those who did rat, a banning of children as either buyers and sellers of drugs, and a sparing of civilians from any potential disputes. Now, reflect on famous individuals who crusade for some cause. Bono may be known for his ONE Campaign fighting extreme poverty, Oprah for espousal of education, and insert your favorite celebrity activist and cause. Compare their speeches or founding of organizations – both of which legitimate humanitarian efforts– to a still rising entertainment star sitting down with the actual leaders and members causing the issue in question (gang violence), formulating a plan of action to quell the issue, and actually making these volatile individuals give written consent to the proposed resolution. Tupac did exactly that because he labored to embody the ideal of social responsibility. This can be further highlighted through a number of his acts: taking a fan to her prom and giving her over $1000, going to a basketball game with a dying fan and renaming his publishing company Joshua's Dream in the fan's honor, or visiting a young Georgia girl after her mauling by a pit bull.
