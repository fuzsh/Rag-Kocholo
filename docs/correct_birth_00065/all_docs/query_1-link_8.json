        "text": "A stretch of street in Oakland, California, was renamed Friday for Tupac Shakur, 27 years after the killing of the hip-hop luminary.\n\nA section of MacArthur Boulevard near where he lived in the 1990s became Tupac Shakur Way, following a ceremony that included his family members and Oakland native MC Hammer.\n\n\"Let his spirit live on the rest of these years in these streets and in your hearts,\" Shakur's sister Sekyiwa \"Set\" Shakur told the crowd, wiping away tears at the end of a nearly two-hour ceremony. The sign for Tupac Shakur Way was unveiled moments later.\n\nMC Hammer, the \"U Can't Touch This\" rapper who spent many of Shakur's final months with him before his 1996 shooting death at age 25, said in his remarks that Shakur was, \"hands down, the greatest rapper ever, there's not even a question of that.\"\n\nShakur collaborator Money-B and Oakland hip-hop legend Too Short also spoke at the ceremony.\n\nShakur was born in New York and was raised there and in Baltimore, but he moved with his mother to the San Francisco Bay Area in the late 1980s. He would live in Oakland in the early 1990s and embraced it as an adopted hometown.\n\nIn the spring, the city council in Oakland, California, unanimously voted to rename the street after Shakur.\n\n\"He claimed Oakland,\" said City Councilwoman Carroll Fife, who led the effort to rename the street. \"He said Oakland gave him his game.\"\n\nThe ceremony came the day after a former Southern California street gang leader named Duane Keith \"Keffe D\" Davis pleaded not guilty to murder in the Las Vegas shooting death of Shakur, a charge prompted by his own descriptions in recent years about orchestrating the deadly drive-by shooting. Davis is the only person still alive who was in the vehicle from which shots were fired and the only person ever charged with a crime in the case."
