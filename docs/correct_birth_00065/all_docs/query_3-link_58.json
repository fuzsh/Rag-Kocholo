        "text": "Tupac Amaru Shakur was a very influential person who overcame many difficulties. Tupac was a rapper of truth that spoke about the things that go on in the “Hood” and the unjust police. He was treated differently because he was black and was even arrested for jaywalking. After he was arrested he was beaten by the cops who wanted him to “learn his place”(Joseph 29). This shows how bad Tupac had it because he was African American. Tupac died an early death at 25 because of a brewing rivalry between the East and West Coast rappers. Shakur was a person who would stand up for what he believed in no matter the cost and died fighting for that. He never let anyone win a battle that he was determined to win and always knew what he was fighting for. His mother was the same, as a loyal member of the Black Panther Party, a group that protected all African Americans from police brutality. Tupac was literally born to be a fighter and carried on his mother's legacy. Despite his rough life, Tupac Shakur became one of the most influential rappers of all time.\n\nTupac Shakur was born on June 16th, 1971, with the name Lesane Crooks. His name was switched to Tupac Amaru II almost a year later. He was born in New York and lived primarily in Harlem till he was 13. In 1984 he moved to Baltimore where he lived for four years until he moved to Oakland. When he was younger he struggled in life because his family was poor and had to move. Mostly Everyone in Tupac’s life was part of the Black Panther"
