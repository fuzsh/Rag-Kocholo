        "text": "(1971–96). American rapper Tupac Shakur was one of the leading names in 1990s gangsta rap, a form of hip-hop music that depicts the often violent lifestyle of impoverished American inner cities. Although his career was relatively short, he left an enduring legacy within the hip-hop community. Shakur also went by the names 2Pac and Makaveli.\n\nShakur was born Lesane Parish Crooks on June 16, 1971, in Brooklyn, New York. His mother was Alice Faye Williams, a member of the revolutionary Black Panther Party. She renamed him Tupac Amaru Shakur—after Peruvian revolutionary Túpac Amaru II—when he was a year old. Shakur spent much of his childhood moving around with his family, and in 1986 they settled in Baltimore, Maryland. Shakur attended the elite Baltimore School of the Arts, where he did well both creatively and academically; however, his family relocated to Marin City, California, before he could graduate. There Shakur began selling drugs and became involved in the gang culture that would one day provide material for his rap lyrics.\n\nIn 1990 Shakur joined Digital Underground, an Oakland, California-based rap group. After contributing to two of the group’s albums in 1991, This Is an EP Release and Sons of the P, later that year he produced his solo debut recording, 2Pacalypse Now. The tone and content of 2Pacalypse Now echoed the works of Public Enemy and West Coast gangsta rappers N.W.A. The album was limited in its radio appeal, but it sold well, especially after Vice President Dan Quayle criticized the song “Soulja’s Story” during the 1992 presidential campaign. That same year, Shakur was cast in the motion picture Juice, an urban crime drama. In 1993 he appeared in the film Poetic Justice, opposite Janet Jackson, and released his second album, Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z. The album retained the activist lyricism of his debut, but hit singles such as “Holler If Ya Hear Me” and “Keep Ya Head Up” made it much more radio-friendly.\n\nWith increased fame and success came greater scrutiny of Shakur’s gangsta lifestyle. A string of arrests culminated with a conviction for sexual assault in 1994; he was incarcerated when his third album, Me Against the World, was released in 1995. Shakur was paroled after serving eight months in prison, and he signed with Death Row Records for his next release. That album, All Eyez on Me (1996), was a two-disc tribute to the “thug life” that Shakur embodied. It debuted at number one on the Billboard charts and sold more than five million copies within its first year of release. Quick to capitalize on his success, Shakur returned to Hollywood, where he starred in Bullet (1996) and Gridlock’d (1997).\n\nOn the evening of September 7, 1996, Shakur was leaving a casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, when he was shot by an unknown assailant; he died six days later. The incident was believed by many to be the result of an ongoing rivalry between the East Coast and West Coast rap communities."
