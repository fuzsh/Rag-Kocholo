        "text": "1971 - 1996\n\nTupac Amaru Shakur\n\nDOB: June 16, 1971 - Brooklyn, NY\n\nDOD: September 13, 1996 - Las Vegas, NV\n\nHeight: 5'10 Weight: 168\n\nMother: Afeni Shakur\n\nFather: William Garland\n\nStep Father: Jeral Wayne Williams\n\nAKA Mutula Shakur\n\nHalf Sister: Sekyiwa Shakur\n\nHalf Brother: Maurice Harding\n\n(Mopreme of Thug Life)\n\nGodfather: Elmer \"Geronimo\" Pratt\n\nMusic Groups: One Nation Emcees, Two From The Crew, Strictly Dope, Digital Underground, Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz/Outlawz\n\nAliases: MC New York, 2Pac, Makaveli (the don)\n\nMarital Status: Divorced (Keisha Morris) & Engaged (Kidida Jones)\n\nTupac Shakur was born Lesane Parish Crooks in Brooklyn, NY in 1971. While still a small child, his mother changed his name to Tupac Amaru after an Inca Indian revolutionary, \"Tupac Amaru\", meaning \"Shining Serpent\". \"Shakur\" means \"Thankful To God\" in Arabic.\n\nFrom childhood, everyone called him the \"Black Prince.\" For\n\nmisbehaving, he had to read an entire edition of The New York Times. When he was two, his sister,\n\nSekyiwa, was born. This child's father, Mutulu, was a Black\n\nPanther who, a few months before her birth, had been sentenced to sixty years for a fatal armored car robbery.\n\nWith Mutulu away, the family experienced hard times. No matter where they moved-the Bronx, Harlem, homeless shelters- Tupac was distressed. \"I remember crying all the time. My major thing growing up was I couldn't fit in. Because I was from everywhere. I didn't have no buddies that I grew up with.\"\n\nBy the age of twelve, Tupac had discovered his loves for acting, writing love songs and poetry. As a young teen, his family moved to Baltimore , MD, where he attended The Baltimore School for the Performing Arts studying acting and ballet. At this school, Tupac left a lasting impression on his teachers and was showing tremendous potential. Unfortunately, Tupac was unable to continue his training. He moved to Oakland, California with the rest of his family. That's when Tupac began to, as he called it, \"Hang with the wrong crowd.\"\n\nAt age fifteen, he fell into rap; he started writing lyrics, walking with a swagger, and milking his background in New York for all it was worth. People in small towns feared the Big Apple's reputation; he called himself MC New York and made people think he was a tough guy.\n\nBy the time he was twenty, Shakur had been arrested eight times, even serving eight months in prison after being\n\nconvicted of sexual abuse. In addition, he was the subject of\n\ntwo wrongful-death lawsuits, one involving a six-year-old\n\nboy who was killed after getting caught in gang-war crossfire between Shakur's gang and a rival group.\n\nNot held back by his lack of formal education, Tupac joined the Rap group Digital Underground as a dancer. Not long before the group achieved award winning success, Tupac released his own album \"2Pacalypse Now\", which was also a success. The hit single \"Brenda's Got A Baby\" launched Tupac's career like a rocket. His stunning talent also got him a role in the motion picture, \"Juice\". Tupac eventually released a second album \"Strictly for my N.I.G.G.A.Z.,\" which was an even bigger success and introduced Tupac's music onto the pop charts.\n\nIn November of 1994, he was shot five times during a robbery in which thieves made off with $40,000 worth of his jewelry. Shakur miraculously recovered from his injuries to\n\nproduce his most impressive artistic accomplishments,\n\nincluding 1995's Me Against the World\n\nThe highlight of Tupac's acting career came when he appeared in \"Poetic Justice\" besides Janet Jackson. The role made Tupac a household name and showed the world that music may not be Tupac's #1 attribute. In the midst of a role in the movie \"Above the Rim\" and a Platinum album \"Me against the world,\" Tupac's rising career was snagged. He was brought up on sexual assault charges by a woman he met at a nightclub. Hours before Tupac would be found guilty, Tupac was robbed at gun point by men whose intent and purpose is still uncertain. Tupac was eventually released at over $1 Million in bail. After his release, Tupac answered his critics by releasing his best album, \"All Eyes On Me.\" \"All Eyes On Me\" has currently sold over 6 million copies, which is revolutionary for a double CD, especially in Hip Hop music. Tupac also had costarring roles in three other films, \"Gridlock'd\", \"Bullet\", and \"Gang Related.\"\n\nWhile on his way to do charity work, Tupac Shakur was shot by unknown gunmen and past on September 13, 1996. Much of what happened on this night remains a mystery to this very day.\n\nFollowing his passing, Shakur's label released an album, The Don Killuminati, under the pseudonym \"Makaveli.\" The cover depicted Shakur nailed to a cross under a crown of thorns, with a map of the country's major gang areas superimposed on it. In January of 1997, Gramercy pictures released Gridlock'd, a film in which Shakur played the role of a drug addict to mostly good reviews. His final film, Gang Related, was released in 1997, and Death Row is said to have several unreleased recordings in the vaults for\n\npotential future release.\n\nSeptember 13, 2003 will mark the seventh anniversary of Tupac's passing.\n\nR.I.P PAC\n\nTHE REALEST NIGGA AROUND."
