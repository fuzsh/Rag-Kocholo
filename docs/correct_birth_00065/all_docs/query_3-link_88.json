        "text": "AMERICAN rap king Tupac Shakur was one of the top music artists of all time.\n\nHe was known for his 1990s gangsta-rap aesthetic and fighting for social justice but was tragically killed in a drive-by shooting in 1996.\n\nWho controls Tupac Shakur's estate?\n\nTom Whalley took over the role of the executor of Tupac Shakur’s estate after the death of his mother Afeni Shakur in 2016.\n\nWhalley is the former head of Warner Bros Records.\n\nBack in 1989, he was working for Interscope and had signed a young Tupac to the label.\n\nIn January 2022, Sekyiwa Shakur, Tupac's sister, and the Tupac Shakur foundation filed a lawsuit against Whalley.\n\nThey allege that he has been \"embezzling millions\" and blatantly violating his role as executor of Afeni Shakur's estate.\n\nWho owns the rights to Tupac Shakur's music?\n\nWhen Tupac died Afeni created record label Amaru Records to handle the release of her son's unreleased music.\n\nAmaru has released 11 albums since the death of the star as well as a documentary titled Tupac: Resurrection.\n\nSince Afeni died suddenly of a heart attack Amaru Entertainment, as well as the star's estate - has been managed by Whalley.\n\nWhat was Tupac's net worth when he died?\n\nThere are conflicting reports as to what the rapper's net worth was when he died.\n\nAccording to PinkVilla at the time of Tupac's death his Net Worth was a whopping $28 million.\n\nBut Celebrity Networth said he had significantly less to his name before his passing.\n\nThey said he had $200,000 at the time of his death.\n\nDid Tupac own a business?\n\nTupac owned a company called Euphanasia which he set up himself.\n\nThe rapper launched the business to develop movie projects and help finance community-minded projects like a centre for young people at risk.\n\n“Euphanasia” is a word Tupac created by combining the words “euphoria” and “euthanasia.\n\nAccording to a Reddit user Tupac also had many other planned business ventures that hadn't come into fruition.\n\nOne of these reportedly included a charity called The Underground Railroad aimed at helping ex convicts and drug addicts.\n\nThe idea was that those discarded by society would go on vacation with Tupac to stop them slipping up.\n\nAnother one of his planned topics was to form \"Thug Mansions\", according to Afeni.\n\nThis would be a place for disadvantaged youth where they would be helped to get back on their feet and find a job.\n\nHow much is Tupac's estate worth now?\n\nAs of 2024, Tupac's estate is estimated to be worth around $40million, according to TheRichest.\n\nBut The Mirror reported the estate was actually worth double that at more than $100million if combined with a library of unreleased material valued at that amount $100million.\n\nHow much money did Tupac's mom get when he died?\n\nIt is unclear how much money Afeni Shakur inhjerited after the death of her son but at the time of her death in 2016 she had a a net worth of $50million, according to The Richest.\n\nAfeni was an American philanthropist and ex-Black Panther.\n\nBefore she died Afeni was named executor of Tupac’s estate and started the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation (TASF) in her son’s honor.\n\nAfeni continued her philanthropic efforts after Tupac's passing and used the foundation to fund several scholarships and programs for young people interested in the arts."
