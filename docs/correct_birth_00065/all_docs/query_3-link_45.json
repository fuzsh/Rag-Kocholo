        "text": "Founded in 1997 by Afeni Shakur, mother of the multi-talented Tupac Shakur, the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, Inc. (TASF) originally began as the Shakur Family Foundation. Afeni formed the organization to bring quality arts training to young people. Over the span of 20 years, a range of creative arts education was offered via annual ‘Performing Arts Day Camps’ for ages 12 through 18 at the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts, in Stone Mountain, Georgia. Disciplines such as creative writing, vocal technique, acting, stage set design, dance, poetry & spoken word, provided clarity around the business of entertainment. TASF also nationally hosted Essay Competitions, charity Golf Tournaments, Internships, and awarded scholarships during this time.\n\nSince the passing of the family’s matriarch and foundation’s founder, Afeni Shakur in 2016, we are determined to inspire current and future generations through the family’s rich history. The Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation has built strong followership with an eternally supportive community of volunteers who are ready to transcend to the next levels of impact work. Sekyiwa Shakur, the daughter of Afeni and Dr. Mutulu Shakur, sister of Tupac, has successfully led the TASF since 2016, with programs and initiatives that reflect her family’s legacy and purpose. The Shakur family name is a symbol of strength, power, creativity, resilience, intelligence, and courage."
