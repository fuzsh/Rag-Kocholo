        "text": "Nearly three decades after Tupac Shakur was gunned down near the Las Vegas Strip, police announced they arrested Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis Friday in connection to the fatal drive-by shooting.\n\nThe late American rapper, one of the most prolific figures in hip-hop music, died Sept. 13, 1996. He was 25.\n\nDavis, the uncle of a person of interest long-linked to the 27-year-old investigation, was taken into custody Friday morning and charged with murder in Shakur's killing, police said at a Friday press conference.\n\nHere's what to know about Davis, who stands accused of killing the rapper − considered one of the most successful and influential artists of his time.\n\nTIMELINE >> Suspect arrested in Tupac Shakur's 1996 killing: A timeline of rapper's death, investigation\n\nHow did Tupac Shukur die?\n\nShakur was fatally wounded in a drive-by shooting near Las Vegas Boulevard the evening of Sept. 7, 1996.\n\nHe was in a BMW driven by Death Row Records founder Marion “Suge” Knight in a convoy of about 10 cars. They were waiting at a red light when a white Cadillac pulled up next to them and gunfire erupted.\n\nDuring a press conference in Las Vegas Friday, LVPD homicide Lt. Jason Johansson said the shooting took place as Shakur headed to a nightclub, after watching Mike Tyson knock out Bruce Seldon in a championship fight at the MGM Grand.\n\nShot multiple times, Shakur died a week later at University Medical Center in Las Vegas.\n\nWho is Duane 'Keffe D' Davis?\n\nDuane Keith Davis, now age 60, was born in Compton, California.\n\nKnown to many in the entertainment world as \"Keffe D,\" he is a self-professed member of the California-based gang, the South Side Compton Crips.\n\nDavis rose to fame as one of the only living witnesses to Shakur's slaying after being featured in television specials on networks including A&E, USA Network and Fox.\n\nIn 2018, in an interview for BET, he admitted he was inside the Cadillac when Shakur was shot. He implicated his nephew, the late Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, saying he was one of two people in the back seat where the shots were fired.\n\nOn Friday, Johansson said that prior to leaving the MGM Grand, Shakur and Knight, spotted their rival Anderson inside the building near the elevators and began to kick and punch him. Security broke up the fight, Johansson said, and the pair left the MGM headed toward the post-fight party.\n\nAt the same time, Johansson said, Davis learned what happened inside the MGM \"and began to devise a plan to obtain a firearm and retaliate against Suge Knight and Mr. Shakur for what occurred.\"\n\nAlso from Compton, Anderson died in May 1998. Police said he also was a South Side Compton Crips gang member.\n\nWhat is Duane Davis charged with?\n\nDavis is charged with one count of murder with use of a deadly weapon and with the intent to promote, further or assist a criminal gang, Clark County District Attorney, Steven B. Wolfson told reporters during a Friday press conference.\n\nDavis is slated to appear in court over the next few days on the murder charge after being indicted by a grand jury.\n\nVegas cops raid home over Tupac's death: Police raid couple's home in relation to Tupac Shakur's murder investigation\n\nPolice recently raided a home connected to Davis\n\nThe long-awaited break in the case came two months after authorities in Nevada obtained a search warrant and raided a home tied to Davis on July 18, 2023.\n\nThe home belonged to Davis' wife, the AP reported, and Las Vegas police collected the following items: A cell phone, laptops, a hard drive, photographs, a magazine featuring Shakur, .40-caliber bullets, and a copy of Davis' 2019 biography, \"Compton Street Legend.\"\n\nWhat to know about Davis' book, 'Compton Street Legend'\n\nDavis was the \"former shot caller for the Southside Compton Crips\" and a kingpin of a Compton-based multi-million dollar drug operation, according to a summary of his memoir listed on Amazon.\n\n\"The infamous Suge Knight, former Death Row Records CEO, and I are the only living eyewitnesses to the deadly confrontation on the Las Vegas strip between the occupants of our two vehicles,\" Davis wrote in the summary, calling the incident a \"violent confrontation that led to the deaths of two of Hip-Hop's biggest stars (Tupac Shakur & Christopher 'Notorious B.I.G.' Wallace) and changed Hip-Hop history forever.\"\n\nWho was Tupac Shakur?\n\nTupac Amaru Shakur was born in East Harlem, New York, on June 16, 1971.\n\nKnown by his stage name 2Pac, he produced classic rap hits including \"California Love\" and \"Dear Mama.\"\n\nSnoop Dogg once dubbed the artist and activist \"revolutionary\" and \"the greatest rapper of all time.\"\n\nThe rapper's career lasted just five years but he has sold over 75 million records worldwide. His 1996 album \"All Eyez on Me\" was certified diamond and includes hits such as \"How Do U Want It” and \"I Ain't Mad at Cha.\"\n\n\"He continues to be one of the most misunderstood, complicated and prolific figures in modern history,\" according to his online bio. \"Shakur's message has continued to resonate throughout the world as his loyal and adoring fan base continues to treasure the timeless messages that he incorporated into his poetry and his music.\"\n\nHe was inducted into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in April 2017 and a hologram of him took the stage at the 2012 Coachella Music and Arts Festival.\n\nIn July, Tupac's sister, Sekyiwa \"Set\" Shakur, accepted his posthumous Hollywood Walk of Fame star., During the ceremony, radio personality Big Boy, who emceed the event, cited two museum exhibits recently dedicated to the star: \"All Eyez on Me: The Writings of Tupac.\" at the Grammy Museum from 2015-2016, and \"Tupac Shakur. Wake Me When I'm Free.\" at L.A. Live in 2022. This year, FX released Dear Mama: a multi-part series on Shakur and his mother Afeni Shakur.\n\nBefore he died, Shakur spent a stint in prison after he was charged in a sex assault case in the '90s. While there, according to XXLMag, he married his girlfriend Keisha Morris. The magazine reported their union was annulled 10 months later.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nNatalie Neysa Alund is a senior reporter for USA TODAY.
