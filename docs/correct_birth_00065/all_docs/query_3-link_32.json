        "text": "We all know who Tupac Shakur is right? Legendary MC who was known for his real and raw demeanor that would display itself in his music and movie roles. He was a beloved figure in music whose words and lyrics have stood the test of time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his short life, he’s still extremely influential to artists today who want to leave behind a similar impact when they no longer make music.\n\nWith his death being investigated nearly 27 years after he was fatally shot, The Root thought it would be the perfect time to revisit the short but impactful life of one Makaveli. Here is the evolution of Tupac Shakur.\n\nHe later moved to the Bay Area in California in the late 1980s. This is when he started to record his raps and went under the name MC New York. It was during this time that he met his future manager Leila Steinberg while taking her poetry classes in the area. She’s the one who got Pac signed by Atron Gregory, who managed Digital Underground.\n\nTupac later became a hype man and backup dancer for Digital Underground, a hip–hop group based out of Oakland. This is when he changed his name to “2pac.” He would also make appearances on songs from the group, most notably, “Same Song” which was a single that was on the soundtrack for the 1991 movie, Nothing but Trouble.\n\nPac was charged and eventually convicted on two counts of first-degree sexual abuse after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in November 1993, along with two other men. Although he was let off on three counts of sodomy, the other counts were enough to send him to prison, where he was sentenced to 18 months to 4.5 years. His sentence began in February 1995 and was released in October of the same year after Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight was able to organize the posting of his bond.\n\nThis is where the relationship between 2Pac and Biggie went south. While in New York in November 1994, Pac was asked to stop by Quad Studios in Manhattan to record a verse. When he arrived, he was shot and robbed by three men in the lobby. Shakur suspected a setup. Days after the shooting, Shakur showed up to hear the verdict in his sexual assault case in a wheelchair.\n\nPac’s fourth album is easily his most popular. It was hip-hop’s first double album and featured a myriad of dope records including, “Ambitionz Az A Ridah,” “2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted,” “California Love,” “All Eyez on Me,” and “How Do U Want It.” It debuted at the top of the Billboard 200 selling more than 500,000 copies in its first week. The record was eventually certified diamond in July 2014 for selling more than 10 million copies.\n\nWhat else is there to say? Pac did not like Biggie at all and basically, any and everyone that was affiliated with East Coast rap. Although he had plenty of shots for Biggie, he went at Bad Boy Records, Diddy, Chino XL, and Mobb Deep. No debate, Pac made the best diss track ever with this song. Some of the lines aren’t even appropriate to repeat. Just listen and you’ll understand.\n\nThere’s so much that happened the night Pac was murdered. The short story is that Pac was in Vegas to attend the Mike Tyson fight in September 1996 with Suge Knight and other associates. He later went to Suge’s nightclub. When they left the club and stopped at a red light, a car pulled up next to the Suge and Pac was in, and started firing shots rapidly. He was shot four times and later pronounced dead days later after internal bleeding."
