Who was Tupac Shakur?

Tupac Shakur, also known by his stage name 2Pac, was a controversial and successful rapper and actor. He was born into a family with a history of legal trouble, and he had no contact with his biological father until he was an adult. Violence was a constant presence in his life, as his mother was imprisoned while pregnant with him. This experience shaped his music, which often dealt with themes of ghettos, street violence, sex, gangs, and other social problems.

Shakur began his career as a roadie and backup dancer for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground. He released his solo debut album, 2Pacalypse Now, in 1991. The album was controversial due to its violent lyrics, but it was also a commercial success. Shakur’s music often landed him in trouble with the law, and he was arrested several times.

Tupac Shakur Early Life

Tupac Shakur was born in East Harlem, New York City on June 16, 1971. His birth name was Lesane Parish Crooks, but his mother renamed him Tupac Amaru Shakur at the age of one. Shakur’s name was inspired by Túpac Amaru II, a Peruvian revolutionary who was executed by the Spanish in 1781. Shakur’s mother said that she wanted him to have a name that reflected his “world culture” and not just his neighborhood.

Shakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme “Komani” Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa Shakur, who was two years younger than him.

Tupac Shakur’s parents were both active members of the Black Panther Party in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. His mother, Afeni Shakur, was acquitted of over 150 charges in the Panther 21 criminal trial a month before his birth.

Shakur’s stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, was a member of the Black Liberation Army and was on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list for four years. He was eventually convicted of a robbery in which police officers and a guard were killed.

Shakur’s godfather, Elmer “Geronimo” Pratt, was also a high-ranking member of the Black Panther Party. He was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a robbery, but his conviction was overturned after it was revealed that the prosecution had concealed evidence of his innocence.

Shakur’s godmother, Assata Shakur, is a former member of the Black Liberation Army who was convicted of the first-degree murder of a New Jersey State Trooper. She is still wanted by the FBI.
