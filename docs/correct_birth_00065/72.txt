Tupac Amaru Shakur (16 June 1971-13 September 1996), born Lesane Parish Crooks, was an African-American rapper, actor, and political activist. Born in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York City in 1971, the son of Black Panther Party members Afeni Shakur and Billy Garland (Black Liberation Army member Mutulu Shakur later became his stepfather, and Geronimo Pratt and Assata Shakur were his godparents), he was renamed at the age of one in honor of the Incan rebel leader Tupac Amaru II. In 1984, his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland, and he became a member of the Communist Party USA's youth league and dated the local chapter director's daughter. In 1988, he moved to Marin City, Marin County, California (5 miles north of San Francisco), and he went to high school in Mill Valley. He made his rap debut in January 1991 under the stage name "2Pac", and he went on to become a massive success, moving to Los Angeles in 1993, becoming a central figure in West Coast hip-hop, rapping about social issues despite the prevalence of gangsta rap at the time, and dating Madonna in 1994. On 22 August 1992, he accidentally shot and killed 6-year-old Qa'id Walker-Teal during a fight in Marin City; he also shot two drunk, off-duty police officers in Atlanta in October 1993; he was charged with assault for swinging a baseball bat at a rival rapper on 5 April 1993; and, on 1 December 1994, he was convicted of raping a woman in a New York hotel room, serving just under a year in prison. In 1995-1996, he became heavily involved in the East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry, and his former friend The Notorious B.I.G. soon became his worst rival. On the night of 7 September 1996, Shakur and his manager Suge Knight assaulted the Crips gangster Orlando Anderson at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas after a friend claimed that Anderson had tried to steal his medallion at a shopping mall. At 11:15 PM that night, while stuck at a stop-light, Tupac was shot four times in a drive-by shooting, and it was believed that Anderson had killed Shakur with a gun purchased by B.I.G. Tupac was regarded by some as the greatest rapper who ever lived due to his influence on the genre. B.I.G. was killed in another drive-by-shooting six months later.
