Actor Louisa Moritz, who starred in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, has died.

Moritz died aged 72 of natural causes at her home in Los Angeles last week, Deadline reported on Wednesday, citing Moritz's friend and publicist Edward Lozzi.

The actor was one of the women who accused Bill Cosby of sexual assault.

Born Louisa Castro in Havana, Cuba, in 1946, Moritz moved to New York City in the 1950s.

She played prostitute Gina in The Man from O.R.G.Y. in 1970, and acquired a few more acting credits in productions such as Death Race 2000 before her appearance in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

In Miloš Forman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel of the same name, Moritz plays Rose, one of the women Jack Nicholson's character Randle McMurphy sneaks into the ward.

She went on to star in films such as Up in Smoke (1978), The Last American Virgin (1982), and Chained Heat (1983).

Moritz also appeared in several TV shows including Happy Days, M*A*S*H, and The Incredible Hulk.

In addition to her acting career, Moritz worked as a real estate agent and as a lawyer.

In 2014, Moritz joined other Cosby accusers when she said the comedian had assaulted her, forcing her to perform oral sex on him, during an appearance on the Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971.

Cosby has denied allegations of non-consensual sex.

Moritz was one of several women who sued Cosby for defamation. Her attorney told Deadline the case will continue following her death.
