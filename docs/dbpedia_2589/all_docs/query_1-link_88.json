        "text": "© Unofficial Royalty 2024\n\nAugust 12, 1503 – Birth of King Christian III of Denmark and Norway at Gottorp Castle in Schleswig, Duchy of Schleswig, now in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nChristian III lived during the time of the Reformation. After the death of his father, the Catholic Frederik I, the Council of State had a lengthy discussion on whether the Danish throne should go to Christian, Frederik I’s Lutheran son from his first marriage, or Frederik I’s Catholic twelve-year-old son Johann from his second marriage. In 1534, Christian was proclaimed Christian III, King of Denmark at an assembly of Lutheran nobles in Jutland. However, the Council of State, made up of mostly Catholic bishops and nobles, refused to accept Christian III as king. Johann, Frederik’s son from his second marriage, was deemed too young and the council was more amenable to restoring the deposed King Christian II to the throne because he had supported both the Catholics and Protestant Reformers at various times. Christopher, Count of Oldenburg, the grandson of a brother of King Christian I of Denmark and the second cousin of both Christian II and Christian III, led the military alliance to restore King Christian II to the throne. What resulted was a two-year civil war, known as the Count’s Feud, from 1534 – 1536, between Protestant and Catholic forces, that led to King Frederik I’s son from his first marriage ascending the Danish throne as King Christian III. In 1537, Christian III was also recognized as King of Norway.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Christian III of Denmark\n\nAugust 12, 1674 – Birth of Marie of Lorraine, wife of Antonio I, Prince of Monaco in Paris, France\n\nIn 1688, in the Chapel Royal at the Palace of Versailles in Versailles, France, 14-year-old Marie married 27-year-old Antonio, the future Prince of Monaco. Antonio and Marie had six daughters but only two survived to adulthood. The elder surviving daughter Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as the reigning Princess of Monaco. The marriage was not happy. In what seems to have become a Grimaldi tradition, Antonio had several illegitimate children from different affairs. Marie responded by finding lovers of her own. In 1701, Antonio became Prince of Monaco upon the death of his father Louis I, Prince of Monaco. Marie spent the last years of her life quietly, frequently returning to the French court. She died at the Prince’s Palace in Monaco on October 30, 1724, at the age of 50.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Marie of Lorraine, Princess of Monaco\n\nAugust 12, 1762 – Birth of King George IV of the United Kingdom at St. James’s Palace in London, England\n\nGeorge’s birth marked the first time an heir had been born to a reigning monarch since the birth of King James II’s son in 1688. At birth, George was automatically Duke of Cornwall as the eldest son of the reigning monarch. Five days after his birth, George was created Prince of Wales. George was created a Knight of the Garter at age three and was introduced to ceremonial functions at an early age. In 1795, George married Caroline of Brunswick, his first cousin. This marriage is one of the worst ever royal marriages. Upon first seeing Caroline, George said to his valet, “Harris, I am not well. Pray get me a glass of brandy.” Caroline said George was fat and not as handsome as his portrait. It is doubtful that the couple spent more than a few nights together as husband and wife. Their only child, Princess Charlotte of Wales, was born nine months later. They both found each other equally unattractive and never lived together nor appeared in public together. Their daughter Charlotte married Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld (the uncle of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and the future King of the Belgians), but she predeceased both her parents, dying in childbirth in 1817 at the age of 21, along with her son. Had Charlotte lived, she would have succeeded her father on the throne.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King George IV of the United Kingdom\n\nAugust 12, 1779 – Birth of Georg, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz in Hanover, Electorate of Hanover, now in Lower Saxony, Germany\n\nIn 1807, Georg represented his father in Paris to negotiate the Duchy of Mecklenburg-Strelitz’s entry into the Confederation of the Rhine. He again represented his father seven years later at the Congress of Vienna. Through his efforts, Mecklenburg-Strelitz was raised to a Grand Duchy. Georg became Grand Duke in 1816, upon his father’s death. Georg found Mecklenburg-Strelitz in great debt and in need of much rebuilding. To eliminate much of the debt, he sold several towns to Prussia, towns given to the Grand Duchy at the Congress of Vienna. He abolished serfdom and throughout his reign, he worked to raise education standards, building schools and instituting compulsory education. He made vast improvements to the infrastructure which would help to energize the grand duchy’s economy.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Georg, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz\n\nAugust 12, 1872 – Birth of Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein, granddaughter of Queen Victoria, at Cumberland Lodge in Windsor, England\n\nFull name: Franziska Josepha Louise Augusta Marie Christina Helena\n\nMarie Louise was the daughter of Princess Helena, the third daughter of Queen Victoria, and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein. In 1890, Marie Louise married Prince Aribert of Anhalt. However, the marriage was unsuccessful. In 1900, the marriage was dissolved by Marie Louise’s father-in-law, at her husband’s insistence. It has been speculated that the marriage was never consummated and implied that Aribert was homosexual, and had been caught in a delicate situation by either his wife or his father. In her memoirs, Marie Louise states that even though her marriage was annulled, she maintained the vows she had made at her wedding, and would never remarry.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nAugust 12, 1904 – Birth of Tsesarevich Alexei of Russia, son of Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia, at Peterhof Palace in St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nAlexei’s mother Empress Alexandra, born Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, was the daughter of Grand Duke Ludwig IV of Hesse and by Rhine and Princess Alice of the United Kingdom, and a granddaughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Before Alexei’s birth, Queen Victoria’s son Prince Leopold, two of her grandsons, and two of her great-grandsons had been born with hemophilia, a genetic disease that prevents the blood from clotting properly. One of the grandsons was Empress Alexandra’s brother Prince Friedrich of Hesse and by Rhine (Frittie) who died of a brain hemorrhage at age 2 ½ after falling out a low window to the ground below. Therefore, there was a risk that Empress Alexandra was a hemophilia carrier. Even before Alexei was two months old, when he suffered severe bleeding from his navel, it was evident that he too had been born with hemophilia. After Alexei’s birth, three more great-grandsons of Queen Victoria would also be diagnosed with the disease. In 2009, DNA analysis done on the remains of Empress Alexandra, Alexei, and his sister Anastasia, the only sister who was a carrier, revealed that Alexei suffered from the rare, severe form of hemophilia, known as Hemophilia B or Christmas Disease. Throughout his short life, Alexei suffered greatly.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Tsesarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Hemophilia in Queen Victoria’s Descendants\n\nAugust 12, 1932 – Birth of Queen Sirikit of Thailand, widow of King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand; born Sirikit Kitiyakara at the home of Lord Vongsanuprabhand, her maternal grandfather, in Bangkok, Siam, now Thailand\n\nSirikit’s paternal grandfather Prince Kitiyakara Voralaksana was the twelfth son of King Chulalongkorn of Siam. She shared a descent from King Chulalongkorn with her husband King Bhumibol Adulyadej and they are first cousins once removed. While he was attending the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, King Bhumibol Adulyadej frequently visited Paris and it was there that he met his future wife Sirikit Kitiyakara who was the daughter of the Thai ambassador to France. Both Sirikit and King Bhumibol Adulyadej were studying at the Thai embassy and a relationship developed. They married in 1950, just a week before the king’s coronation. After the coronation, the 22-year-old king and the 17-year-old queen returned to their studies in Lausanne, Switzerland. The couple had three daughters and one son including the current King of Thailand, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Queen Sirikit of Thailand\n\nAugust 12, 2013 – Death of Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, son of Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, at Huis ten Bosch Palace, his mother’s residence in The Hague; buried at the Dutch Reformed Cemetery in Lage Vuursche, Utrecht, the Netherlands\n\nOn February 17, 2012, while on the royal family’s annual skiing holiday in Lech, Austria, Prince Friso was buried under an avalanche and was in a coma. According to medical reports, he had been buried for 25 minutes and suffered neurological injuries due to the lack of oxygen. On March 1, 2012, he was moved to Wellington Hospital in London, England, nearer to his family’s home. In the summer of 2013, he was declared to be in a minimally conscious state and no longer in need of hospital care. He was moved again on July 9, 2013, to Huis ten Bosch Palace, his mother’s residence in The Hague in the Netherlands. It was there that Prince Friso passed away at the age of 44.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

In 1481, negotiations began for a marriage between Mary and Frederik, Duke of Holstein and Schleswig (the future King Frederik I of Denmark and Norway), the youngest son of King Christian I of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. However, at the end of 1481, Mary became seriously ill with an unknown illness and died, aged fourteen. She was interred on the north side of the altar in St. George’s Chapel, Windsor Castle in Windsor, England at the side of her younger brother George, who had died three years earlier at the age of two. Mary’s parents were interred in a tomb nearby – her father in 1483 and her mother in 1492.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Mary of York\n\nAugust 11, 1730 – Birth of Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen, wife of Anton Ulrich, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, in Philippsthal, Landgraviate of Hesse-Philippsthal, now in Hesse, Germany\n\nIn 1750, Charlotte Amalie married Anton Ulrich, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, who was 43 years older. He had previously contracted a morganatic marriage and had ten children, but they were not eligible to succeed to the ducal throne. This marriage was solely intended to provide an heir for Saxe-Meiningen. The couple had eight children. Following her husband’s death in 1763, Charlotte Amalie was appointed the sole guardian of their sons and served as Regent of Saxe-Meiningen.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Philippsthal, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nAugust 11, 1763 – Birth of Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen, wife of Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen, in Langenburg, Principality of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, now in Baden-Württemberg, Germany\n\nIn 1782, Luise Eleonore married Georg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. The couple had three children including Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the wife of King William IV of the United Kingdom. In December 1803, her husband died and her three-year-old son became Bernhard II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. Luise Eleonore became Regent and is credited with steering the duchy through very difficult times.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Luise Eleonore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nAugust 11, 1863 – Birth of Ernst Gunther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein in Dolzig, Kingdom of Prussia, now in Poland\n\nIn 1864, following the Second Schleswig War, the Duchy of Holstein and the Duchy of Schleswig became occupied territories of the German Confederation, and two years later, following the Austro-Prussian War, part of the new Prussian Province of Schleswig-Holstein. Just like his father, Prussia recognized Ernst Gunther as the mediatized duke of these two duchies, with the rank and all the titles. (mediatize – to annex monarchy to another state, while allowing certain rights to its former sovereign)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Ernst Gunther, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein\n\nAugust 11, 1873 – Birth of Luise Charlotte of Saxe-Altenburg, Princess Eduard of Anhalt, wife of the future Eduard, Duke of Anhalt, in Altenburg, Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, now in Thuringia, Germany\n\nIn 1895, Luise Charlotte married Eduard, the future Duke of Anhalt. They had six children but were divorced on January 26, 1918, just a few months before he succeeded to the ducal throne. Luise Charlotte spent her remaining years in Altenburg, Germany where she died in 1953.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Luise Charlotte of Saxe-Altenburg, Princess Eduard of Anhalt\n\nAugust 11, 1958 – Death of Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky, second husband of Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia, at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville in Ontario, Canada, a suburb of Toronto; buried at York Cemetery in Toronto, Ontario, Canada\n\nGrand Duchess Olga was in an unsuccessful marriage with Duke Peter Alexandrovich of Oldenburg when, in 1903, she saw Nikolai at a military review. It was love at first sight. Despite Olga’s continuing requests to her brother Nicholas II, Emperor of All Russia, permission for marriage was not granted until 1916. Olga and Nikolai had two sons. After the Russian Revolution, the couple and their sons lived in Denmark. After World War II, the Soviet Union notified the Danish government that Olga was accused of conspiracy against the Soviet government. Because they were fearful of assassination or kidnap attempts, Nikolai and Olga decided to move their family across the Atlantic to the relative safety of rural Canada. By 1952, Olga and Nikolai’s sons had moved away and the farm became a burden so they sold it and moved to a five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, Canada, a suburb of Toronto, where Nikolai died.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Nikolai Alexandrovich Kulikovsky\n\nAugust 11, 1968 – Birth of Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau, widow of Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, born Mabel Martine Wisse Smit in Pijnacker, the Netherlands\n\nMabel is the widow of Prince Friso, son of the former Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, who was critically injured in a skiing accident after being buried by an avalanche in 2012.

Most notably, in 2008, she became the first CEO of The Elders, an international non-governmental organization of public figures noted as senior statesmen, peace activists, and human rights advocates founded by Nelson Mandela.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Princess Mabel of Orange-Nassau\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

The Treaty of Rouen was signed in 1517 and one of the provisions was for James V, King of Scots to marry a French princess. When James V reached a marriageable age, talks began regarding a marriage with Madeleine. However, Madeleine had tuberculosis and her ill health was an issue and another French bride, Mary of Bourbon, was offered as a substitute. When James V came to France to meet Mary of Bourbon, he met Madeleine and decided to marry her. Because of his daughter’s health issues, François I was reluctant to agree to the marriage, but eventually, he did so. Madeleine and King James V of Scotland were married on January 1, 1537, at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. The couple arrived in Scotland on May 19, 1537, after months of celebrations in France, with Madeleine’s health having further deteriorated. Madeleine wrote a letter to her father on June 8, 1537, saying that she was feeling better and that her symptoms had subsided. Despite this, on July 7, 1537, Madeleine died from tuberculosis in her husband’s arms, a month short of her seventeenth birthday.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Madeleine of Valois, Queen of Scots\n\nAugust 10, 1759 – Death of King Fernando VI of Spain at the Castle of Villaviciosa de Odón in Madrid, Spain; buried at Salesas Reales Church in Madrid, Spain\n\nIn 1729, Fernando married Barbara of Portugal, daughter of João V, King of Portugal. The couple had no children. Fernando succeeded his father Felipe V, King of Spain in 1746, and reigned for thirteen years. His wife Barbara died in 1758 and her death broke Fernando’s heart. During the last year of his reign, probably at least partially caused by his wife’s death, Fernando VI rapidly lost his mental capacity and was held at the Castle of Villaviciosa de Odón, near Madrid, where he died less than a year after Barbara’s death, on August 10, 1759, as the age of 45.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: King Fernando VI of Spain\n\nAugust 10, 1869 – Birth of Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Grand Duchess of Oldenburg, second wife of Friedrich August II, Grand Duke of Oldenburg, in Schwerin, Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg- Schwein, now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany\n\nElisabeth Alexandrine married Friedrich August II, the last Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. She was the sister of Prince Heinrich of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, the husband of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands. After her husband was forced to abdicate on November 11, 1918, when the German Empire fell, the couple took up residence at Rastede Castle in Rastede near Oldenburg, Germany. Elisabeth Alexandrine remained close to her large family, often spending time with her brother Heinrich in the Netherlands.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Elisabeth Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Grand Duchess of Oldenburg\n\nAugust 10, 1876 – Death of Charles Elmé Francatelli, maitre d’hôtel and chief cook in ordinary to Queen Victoria from 1840 – 1842, in Eastbourne, England\n\nCharles Francatelli’s story in the TV series Victoria is mostly fictional. For two years only, from March 9, 1840 to March 31, 1842, Francatelli served as maitre d’hôtel and chief cook in ordinary to Queen Victoria. For some reason, he was dismissed, perhaps because Queen Victoria did not like his French cuisine. Francatelli did have one more royal client. From 1863 – 1865, he served as chef de cuisine to The Prince and Princess of Wales (the future King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) at their London home, Marlborough House. He did marry (but not to Queen Victoria’s dresser Marianne Skerrett as depicted in the television series Victoria) and have children.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Charles Elmé Francatelli\n\nAugust 10, 1888 – Birth of Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark, son of King George I of Greece, in Pavlovsk, near St. Petersburg, Russia\n\nChristopher was the only one of his parents’ eight children not born in Greece. His birth was a surprise, as his eldest sibling was 20 years old at the time of Christopher’s birth. Christopher was offered the thrones of Lithuania, Albania, and Portugal, all of which he refused. Christopher believed a throne should be accepted only when the prospective ruler was seriously dedicated to leading a country. Christopher did not believe himself to be sufficiently up to the challenge.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Prince Christopher of Greece and Denmark\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the illegitimate son of King James II of England (reigned 1685 – 1688) and his mistress Arabella Churchill. James’s surname FitzJames comes partially from Anglo-Norman Fitz, meaning “son” so FitzJames means “son of James”. James’ paternal grandparents were King Charles I of England and Henrietta Maria of France (the daughter of King Henri IV of France and Marie de’ Medici). His maternal grandparents were Sir Winston Churchill and Elizabeth Drake. John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, who gained fame as a military leader and courtier during the reign of Queen Anne, was James’ maternal uncle. King Charles II was his paternal uncle.\n\nIn 1663, during the reign of King Charles II of England, James’s fifteen-year-old future mother Arabella Churchill was sent to court to be a Maid of Honor to the Duchess of York. The Duchess of York, born Anne Hyde, was the first wife of King Charles II’s brother James, Duke of York, the future King James II. Because King Charles II and his wife Catherine of Braganza had no children, James, Duke of York was the heir presumptive to the throne and did succeed his brother in 1685. Arabella captured James’ eye and by 1665, she was his mistress. The Churchill family was firmly loyal to the royal household, and their only feeling about Arabella’s position as a royal mistress seems to have been “a joyful surprise that so plain a girl had attained such high preferment.”\n\nJames had three full siblings from her mother’s relationship with King James II:\n\nHenrietta FitzJames (1667 – 1730), married (1) Henry Waldegrave, 1st Baron Waldegrave, had one son and one daughter (2) Piers Butler, 3rd Viscount Galmoye, no children\n\nHenry FitzJames, 1st Duke of Albemarle (1673 – 1702), married (1) Marie Gabrielle d’Audibert de Lussan, had one daughter who became a nun\n\nArabella FitzJames (1674 – 1704), became a nun in Pontoise, France taking the name Sister Ignatia\n\nJames had eight half-siblings from King James II’s first marriage (before he became king) to Lady Anne Hyde but only two survived childhood and both were reigning Queens of England:\n\nCharles, Duke of Cambridge (1660 – 1661), died at age six months from smallpox\n\nQueen Mary II of England (1662 – 1694), married her first cousin William III, Prince of Orange in 1677, ascended to the throne in 1689 as co-ruler with her husband after the deposition of her father, no surviving children\n\nJames, Duke of Cambridge (1663 – 1667), died at age three from smallpox\n\nQueen Anne of Great Britain (1665 – 1714), married Prince George of Denmark, had 17 pregnancies, five live births, no surviving children\n\nCharles, Duke of Kendal (1666 – 1667), died at age ten months\n\nEdgar, Duke of Cambridge (1667 – 1671), died at age three\n\nHenrietta (born and died 1669), died at age ten months\n\nCatherine (born and died 1671), died at age ten months\n\nJames had seven half-siblings from King James II’s second marriage to Maria Beatrice of Modena but only the youngest two survived childhood:\n\nCatherine Laura (1675 – 1676), died at age nine months\n\nIsabel (1676 – 1681), died at age four\n\nCharles, Duke of Cambridge (born and died 1677), died 35 days after his birth\n\nElizabeth (born and died 1678), died in infancy\n\nCharlotte Maria (born and died 1682): died at age two months from convulsions\n\nJames Francis Edward, Prince of Wales “the Old Pretender” (1688 – 1766), married Maria Clementina Sobieski, had two sons\n\nLouisa Maria Teresa (1692 – 1712), died at age nineteen from smallpox\n\nJames had three half-siblings from his mother’s marriage to Charles Godfrey:\n\nElizabeth Godfrey (1677 – 1719), married Edmund Dunch, had four children\n\nFrancis Godfrey (1681 – 1712), unmarried\n\nCharlotte Godfrey (circa 1682 – 1754), married Hugh Boscawen, 1st Viscount Falmouth, had nine children\n\nJames was raised in France and was educated at the College of Juilly, a private Catholic school still in existence, the Collège du Plessis, a college of the University of Paris, and the Jesuit College of La Flèche which was in existence from 1604 – 1762. At the age of sixteen, he received military training while serving with Charles V, Duke of Lorraine, the Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nJames returned to England a year later. His father King James II appointed him Governor of Portsmouth and Colonel of the Blues, and created him a Knight of the Order of the Garter. In 1688, the Glorious Revolution forced James’ father King James II of England to vacate the throne in favor of his daughter (and James’ half-sister) Queen Mary II and her husband and first cousin (also James’ first cousin) King William III. The former King James II, his second wife Maria Beatrice of Modena, and their son James Edward Francis Stuart, the former Prince of Wales (James’ half-brother) were exiled. They settled in France, where King James II’s first cousin King Louis XIV provided him with the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye in France. James’ English peerage and its subsidiary titles were considered forfeited after the forced exile of his father in 1688.\n\nJames’ military training with the Imperial Army of the Holy Roman Empire proved invaluable. From 1689 – 1691, he served in the Williamite War in Ireland in which the Jacobite supporters of the exiled King James II unsuccessfully fought to restore the House of Stuart to the English throne. After the 1691 Treaty of Limerick, James withdrew permanently to France. He served in the French Army in twenty-nine campaigns, commanding fifteen of the campaigns against his maternal uncle, the great English military leader John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough.\n\nIn 1706, King Louis XIV rewarded James for his service by creating him a Marshal of France, a French military honor awarded to generals for exceptional achievements, and by creating him Duke of FitzJames in the peerage of France in 1710. After James participated in the War of the Spanish Succession, King Felipe V of Spain rewarded his military capabilities by creating him Duke of Liria and Jérica in 1707 in the Spanish nobility.\n\nOn March 26, 1695, at the chapel of the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye in France, James married Lady Honora Burke, the widow of Patrick Sarsfield, 1st Earl of Lucan, who had died in battle in 1693.\n\nJames and Honora had one son who served in the Spanish Army and founded a Spanish dynasty, the Dukes of Liria and Jérica and later the Dukes of Alba.\n\nJames Fitz-James Stuart, 2nd Duke of Berwick, 2nd Duke of Liria and Xérica (1696 – 1738), married Catalina Ventura de Portugal-Columbus, 9th Duquesa de Veragua y de La Vega, had six children but only four survived childhood\n\nJames’ wife Honora, aged about twenty-three, died on January 16, 1698, in Pézenas, Languedoc, France, from tuberculosis, leaving a two-year-old son and a grieving husband. She was buried at the Convent of English Benedictines in Pontoise, France.\n\nTwo years after his first wife’s death, James married Anne Bulkeley, on April 18, 1700, in Paris, France. Anne was the daughter of Henry Bulkeley, who served as Master of the Household to King Charles II and King James II.\n\nJames and Anne had thirteen children, the nine below survived childhood. Their descendants are the French Ducs de Fitz-James.\n\nHenry James FitzJames, 2nd Duke of FitzJames (1702 – 1721), died at age nineteen, married Victoire-Félicité de Duras de Durfort, no children\n\nHenriette de FitzJames (1705 – 1739), married Jean-Baptiste-Louis, Count of Clermont d’Amboise, Marquis of Reynel, had four children\n\nFrançois de Fitz-James, 3rd Duke of FitzJames, (1709 – 1764), became a priest, served as Bishop of Soissons, and as a chaplain to King Louis XV of France\n\nLaure-Anne de Fitz-James (1710 – 1766), married Joachim-Louis de Montagu, Marquis of Bouzols, no children\n\nHenry de FitzJames (1711 – 1731), colonel of the Berwick Regiment of Irish Infantry\n\nCharles de FitzJames, 4th Duke of FitzJames (1712 – 1787), Marshal of France, Lieutenant General during the Seven Years’ War, Governor of Limousin in 1734 married Louise Victoire Goyon, had four children\n\nMarie Emilie de FitzJames (1715 – 1770), married François-Marie de Pérusse, Marquis d’Escars, had four children\n\nEdouard de FitzJames (1716 – 1758) field marshal in 1734 and lieutenant general in 1748, unmarried\n\nAnne Sophie de FitzJames (1718 – 1763), became a nun\n\nIn 1733, the nearly 63-year-old James was chosen to command the French troops in the War of the Polish Succession. He led his French troops to victory at the Siege of Kehl in the Margraviate of Baden, now in Baden-Württemberg, Germany, on October 29, 1733. After the Siege of Kehl, the French army went into winter quarters. During the spring of 1734, James planned to lead 100,000 troops to siege the city of Philippsburg in the Margraviate of Baden, now in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.\n\nAlthough the French were victorious at the Siege of Philippsburg, on June 12, 1734, the nearly 64-year-old James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick, 1st Duke of Liria and Jérica, 1st Duke of Fitz-James was killed when a cannonball decapitated him while he was inspecting the work on trenches.\n\nOn June 14, 1734, the coffin of James Fitz-James was transported in a grand military style to Strasbourg Cathedral in Strasbourg, France, and placed in the crypt there. James had expressed the desire to be buried next to his son at the Church of the English Benedictines on Rue Saint-Jacques in Paris, France. However, he was interred at the Scots College in Paris, France. His tomb was destroyed during the French Revolution and his remains were lost.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Their relationship lasted twelve years until Peter met Marta Samuilovna Skavronskaya, first his mistress, then his second wife, and finally his successor on the Russian throne as Catherine I, Empress of All Russia.
