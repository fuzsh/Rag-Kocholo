        "text": "Thank you very much for locating the obituary for Jane and her brother. The information was very helpful. I have found “Cook County” a very difficult resource to work with.\n\nAgain, many thanks.\n\n…you have some unexpected surprises. I was more than thrilled to receive a copy of a thank you letter\n\n(WWII Harvey Letters) my father wrote from the south pacific during World War II. He said he was really happy to get the Christmas package from the Harvey committee which included a real American candy bar. I’ve been wondering what kind it was. I also found a history of the Methodist church on Lexington Ave. which mentioned my great grandparents. I hope to be able to explore your shelves again in the near future. Thanks for being there.\n\nThanks for all your service with the SSGHS. This organization is a godsend for the genealogy of the south suburban area and then some. The records they’ve kept from the trash dump are pure gold. Those not presently into genealogy might consider supporting now, because family members down the road will certainly appreciate.\n\nAs a long time member, I would like to take this opportunity to thank you and all the other volunteers who make SSGHS so important to those of us who live far away. I live in New Hampshire and although we have been to IL researching, many years ago, we can hardly wait to see your readings of First Lutheran. On our brief visit there, we found dozens of graves of our family members. Please take an extra photo of the tombstone of Christoph and Therese, my husband’s g g grandparents, as we lost the one that we took. Once again, thanks to all of you.\n\nReceived the photos yesterday. I was very impressed by the details and quantity of pictures, which made it feel as though I had taken the trip myself. Besides the excitement of finally seeing the family headstone, the dates on the tombstones have helped my research a great deal and brought me that much closer to my family that was scattered during the Depression.\n\nAlthough I did not recognize any names on the other headstones you photographed, it still made the place more real for me. I expect that I may need your services again as I uncover more family history down the road.\n\nThank you again!\n\nI have received the cemetery photos that you did for me… I was hoping for more information and although some cemeteries are full of new facts for me, others are just NOT. It was not a total bust however, and I am sure when I get all the info it will be a correct and complete picture.\n\nI hope to be able to send another request for the Mt. Olivet Cemetery soon.\n\nI wanted to thank you for your organizations representation for me in the Chicago area and for the important work you do in providing family history data to people like me.\n\nHave a wonderful summer."
