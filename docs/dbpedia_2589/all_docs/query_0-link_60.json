        "text": "Sharon Hartnett, age 80, of Jackson, Nebraska died 1/4/21 after an 11-year courageous battle with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. She died peacefully in the home that she loved surrounded by her family that adored her. A Private Mass of Christian Burial will be at 11:00 a.m. Saturday, January 9, 2021 at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Jackson, Nebraska with burial to follow at St. John Cemetery, rural Jackson.

For added safety, the 3pm to 5pm hours of visitation are for the elderly, and high-risk attendees, followed by the general public from 5pm until 7:30 p.m. A Rosary and Vigil Service will begin at 7:30 p.m. Friday evening at the funeral home. Online condolences may be offered at www.meyerbroschapels.com\n\nSharon was born on April 24, 1940 in Sioux City, the daughter of Agnes and Roy Danielson. She was raised as the oldest of 7 siblings in South Sioux City. Her father died suddenly when she was 23 years old and she helped care for her siblings and helped her mom manage the home. She graduated from South Sioux City High School in 1958.\n\nOn May 29, 1965, she married Jack Hartnett at St. Michael’s Catholic Church in South Sioux City. Sharon and Jack were blessed with six children and made their home in Jack's childhood home in Jackson, Nebraska. Sharon grew to love the town of Jackson and enjoyed her many years surrounded by family and wonderful friends. Her first job was a dental assistant with Dr. Liske in Dakota City until her first child was born. Upon the birth of her daughter, she stayed home to raise her children. She then worked as a cook/dispatcher for the Dakota County Sheriff’s office, followed by dispatching at the South Sioux City Law Enforcement Center. Sharon had great love and admiration for her “men and women in blue” and watched over them as if they were her sons and daughters for all those years and even after.\n\nSharon’s greatest joy in life was giving to others and putting others before herself; always looking for a new friend and an opportunity to get to know them. She modeled selflessness to her children to the very end of her life, especially in her care for her husband. Sharon was known for her cinnamon rolls and cookies, as baking was a way for her to love on others. She had many challenges in her life, but one would never know it. She handled all struggles with positivity, faith, and grace and always said “it could be worse, there are many who have it worse than me.” Ultimately, if her children and grandchildren were ok, she was ok. She leaves an emptiness in Dakota County that can never be filled. Her faith guided her and ultimately led her to her eternal home in heaven. Her 6 children and 16 grandchildren were her greatest accomplishment.\n\nSurvivors include her six children that are proud to call her their mom; Kris (Tim) Brown of Sioux City, Steve (Christine) of Ponca, Neb., Dave (Michelle) of Sioux City, Craig (Alice) of Ballwin, Mo., Janie (Kevin) Snieder of Sioux City, and Kathy (Travis) Moller of Jackson; 16 grandchildren: Tyler, Carter, Madison and Maria Brown; Taylor, Derek, Megan, Jenna and Brady Hartnett; Jack, Libby, Mikey, and Molly Hartnett; and Joshua, Jonah, and Ethan Snieder; as well as her 7 siblings: Mary (Dave) Burns, Eileen Wolf, Peg (Joe) Moritz, Terry (Valerie) Danielson, Dan (Pat)Danielson, Bob (Kathy) Danielson, and Jeff Danielson; and sister-in-laws Mary Jo Nelson, Emily Hartnett, and Peg O’Neill.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, in-laws, and husband of 53 years, Jack Hartnett; as well as several loved and cherished family members.\n\nThe family would like to thank the physicians and staff at the June E. Nylen Cancer Center for their care and compassion during her battle with cancer as well as the staff of Unity Point Hospital oncology floor. We would also like to thank mom’s wonderful friends and the residents of Jackson for their compassion toward both of our parents over the years. All roads truly lead to Jackson.\n\nMemorials may be directed in Sharon's name to Bishop Heelan Catholic Schools or St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, in Jackson, Neb."
