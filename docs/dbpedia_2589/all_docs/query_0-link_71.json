Archives & Special Collections, University of Nebraska–Lincoln Libraries.\n\nAlternative Format: University Studies of the University of Nebraska https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/univstudiespapers/\n\nBiography:\n\nThe \"University Studies\" publications were developed through the Senate Committee on Publication of University Studies and the Board of University Publications, which were comprised of faculty. Two of the publication board members served as editors.\n\nIn 1941, volume 41, number 1, included a note that explained changes to the publication. The Board decided to combine \"University Studies\" with another publication called \"Studies in Language, Literature, and Criticism,\" published under the new title \"University of Nebraska Studies.\" This new publication included three subseries, outlined as \"Studies in the Humanities,\" Studies in the Social Sciences,\" and \"Studies in Science and Technology.\"\n\nIn 1946, with a switch to a new format, the publication became identified as a \"new series\" identified by a single number rather than numbers and volumes. There is no new series no. 3 in the publication. David L. Dowd's book Pageant Master of The Republic, published by the University of Nebraska Press, has been noted as number 3 but there are no indications in that work, or records, in support of that designation.\n\nScope and Content:\n\nThe records include copies of publications of university faculty printed by the University of Nebraska Printing Division.\n\nSubjects:\n\nHuman geography -- Great Plains -- Periodicals\n\nAuthors, American -- Great Plains -- Periodicals\n\nGreat Plains -- History -- Periodicals\n\nGreat Plains -- Book reviews -- Periodicals\n\nWest (U.S.) -- Periodicals\n\nContainer List: Box 1.
