        "text": "It’s unclear what caused the death of Moritz Erhardt, a twenty-one-year-old intern at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, in London last week. Erhardt, a German exchange student who had recently finished a semester at the University of Michigan’s business school, was nearing the end of a seven-week summer internship at the prestigious bank when he collapsed in the shower of his East London residence. Reports indicated that he suffered from epilepsy, and may have had a seizure. This is a tragic story; what makes it even more grievous are revelations of the gruelling schedule Erhardt had kept in the weeks leading up to his death. (Epileptic seizures are also often brought on by exhaustion.)\n\nIn an apparent attempt to win his bosses’ approval, Erhardt worked through the night eight times in two weeks, friends and colleagues say; in the nights leading up to his death, he worked until six o’clock in the morning for three days in a row. Erhardt was employed in the firm’s investment-bank division, which, even by the cutthroat standards of the City of London and of Wall Street, is notorious for the hours workers are expected to clock in. “I see many people wandering around, blurry-eyed and drinking caffeine to get through but people don’t complain because the potential rewards are so great,” an intern told The Independent. (In a statement, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said it could not comment on assertions about the hours that Erhardt had been working, and is waiting for the postmortem results.)\n\nDeath from overwork—if this indeed turns out to have been the cause of Erhardt’s death—may be relatively rare, but it’s nothing new. Only a few months ago, a twenty-four-year-old ad man in Beijing suffered a cardiac arrest after working overtime for a month. In Japan there’s even a word for the phenomenon, and the Japanese health ministry has made a concerted effort to cut down on the number of such deaths. Erhardt’s death points to a curious phenomenon—one that highlights the changing nature of work and of leisure, and people’s reasonable expectations from both.\n\nIn 1930, John Maynard Keynes wrote an essay called “Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren,” in which he predicted that as technology improved and productivity, in turn, rose, we would be able to work much less to satisfy our needs. Within a century, Keynes estimated, no one would have to work more than fifteen hours a week. The argument seems almost naïve as 2030, Keynes’s target date, approaches.\n\nWork hours in the developed world did fall drastically in the first decades of the twentieth century, thanks to industrial innovations (as Keynes himself witnessed). The decline slowed in later decades, and since the nineteen-eighties, work hours have largely stalled at an average of forty hours a week. Today, no place in the developed world comes close to Keynes’s projected fifteen-hour workweek. Still, by the end of the twentieth century, the average number of annual hours worked was nearly half that of a century before, mostly because of the drastic change earlier in the century. This, in time, has led to a rise in leisure activities: playing sports, travelling, watching television.\n\nYet the top ten per cent of earners “have not shared much in the gain of leisure,” Robert Fogel, an economic historian, wrote in 1994. Rather, those well-off people, Fogel noted, were working closer to the nineteenth-century standard of thirty-two hundred hours a year than to the current standard of about eighteen hundred hours.\n\nThis is surprising, on the face of it, if you assume—as Keynes did—that people prefer leisure time and would spend less time at work if only they made enough money to afford putting in fewer hours. In other words, it seems to make sense that people who earn a lot of money would work less rather than more.\n\nInstead, the opposite has happened. To be sure, Erhardt’s salary of forty-two hundred dollars a month wouldn’t have put him in Fogel’s category of the top ten per cent of workers. But there’s no doubt that had he lived, and carried on working in investment banking, his wages would have increased exponentially. What’s more, Erhardt belonged to a field in which working hours barely decline as one climbs the corporate ladder. Alexandra Michel, an assistant professor at the U.S.C. Marshall School of Business, interviewed over five hundred bank associates for a paper on workplace culture: in their first year at the job, all of those interviewed reported working more than eighty hours a week; in their fifth year, that number remained a staggering ninety-seven per cent. “It is like a psych experiment where the light is always on,” one bank associate told Michel of his work environment. “The only temporal markers are secretarial shifts.”\n\nHow did Keynes, whose forecasts proved otherwise prescient, get this so wrong?\n\nThe answer might have to do with the fact that workplace cultures—including the hours people work—are often set not by workers themselves but by those who employ them. Employers prefer to hire a smaller number of workers who work longer hours than to pay less and spread the work around for the simple reason that the first approach is more profitable, write Robert and Edward Skidelsky in their book “How Much Is Enough?” The outcome, according to the authors, is that the labor market is now “divided into those who are compelled to work longer than they want, and those who cannot get enough work.” The simplest solution, they argue, would be to gradually reduce the number of hours expected of employees. This solution isn’t likely to excite employers, of course. But one wonders, in light of these findings, if a workplace culture that acknowledged workers’ needs as much as employers’ bottom lines might have helped prevent the tragedy of Erhardt’s death.\n\nPhotograph by Jeff J.
