        "text": "First Hotel in ST. Moritz\n\n1855 - In the year 1855 Johannes Badrutt and his wife rented Pension Faller - today's Kulm Hotel St. Moritz - with 12 rooms at CHF 200 per year. Later, in the year 1858 they bought the Pension for CHF 28,500. It is the first hotel in St. Moritz and the later birthplace of winter tourism. One year later, the hotel was extended by two floors. Battlements and towers gave the house a palace-like appearance. The hotel will be continuously expanded over the next few years.\n\nThe Legendary Bet\n\n1864 - According to legend, Badrutt invited his regular British summer guests to experience the winter in St. Moritz. He suggested that should they do not like it, he would reimburse them their travel costs. The guests came for Christmas and stayed until Easter. On departure, everyone was tanned, healthy, and happy. Today's winter tourism was born.\n\nElectric Light In the Grand Restaurant\n\n1879 - The first electric light illuminated the Dining Room of Kulm Hotel St. Moritz. In 1878, Badrutt and his son visited the world exhibition in Paris, where the first arc lamps were presented.

He initiated the construction the Chesa Al Parc in 1986 with the sports field, consisting of 3 tennis courts and the ice rink in winter, as well as Residence I in 1988, consisting of 14 luxury apartments, conference rooms, and the parking garage.\n\nThe entrance receives a face lift\n\n1993 - Renovation of the hotel entrance and lobby.
