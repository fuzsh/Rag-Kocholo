        "text": "John E. “Jack” Zenk, of Bull Valley, IL passed away on December 4, 2023. Jack was born on April 27, 1941 in Sheboygan, WI to Paul E. Zenk and Ruth L. Kahle. He was the second oldest of eight children. He is survived by brother Robert Zenk, of Hamilton, IL, sisters Jeannie Moritz, of Henderson, NV, Vicki Clapper of Sheboygan Falls, WI, and Sandi Cuckler of Mequon, WI, and many nieces and nephews.\n\nJack attended McHenry High School and after he joined the US Navy. He spent most of his adult life in Bull Valley. He lived on and managed Century Ridge Farm. The farm has been in the Zenk family for over 130 years, started by his grandfather William Zenk. Jack’s uncles William Jr (Nick) and Glen (Pete) ran the farm for many years after his grandfather died. It was Jack’s pride and joy. There was always work to be done on the farm and if you were there, you were working. Countless memories at the farm will always be cherished by his friends and family.\n\nTraveling was a passion of Jack’s as he traveled the world over the years. Greece and Egypt were two of his favorite destinations. In his later years, to escape the snow, Jack would winter at South Padre Island, TX.\n\nJack owned and operated a hair salon in Long Grove, Il. He made many friends in Long Grove and was a regular at the Village Tavern. He enjoyed helping his clients and friends decorate their homes for Halloween and Thanksgiving with corn stalks and pumpkins from the farm.\n\nWe used to call Jack the “Mayor of McHenry” because it seemed he knew just about everyone. You could regularly find him at the Corner Tap or the Fox Hole. But by far his favorite thing to do was sit outside at the farm and reminisce about days gone by, of course you would have to have a few cold beers while doing so. Jack will be sorely missed."
