        "text": "Munising\n\nMarian A. Cockrell, age 91, of Munising, died unexpectedly at her home on Saturday morning, August 12, 2017. She was born on December 1, 1925 in Grafton, Nebraska to Alvin and Anna (Miller) Moritz. Marian married Clyde Cockrell in 1949 and together had four daughters. Clyde preceded Marian in death in 1968. In the early 1970’s she moved to Munising and volunteered at St. Vincent De Paul Society. Marian also worked at the Country Connection. She loved to dance, bullhead fish with Irene, read, work puzzles, watch Westerns on television, and at one time had a green thumb for gardening.\n\nShe is survived by four daughters – Cheryl (Jim) Albright of Munising, Sandra (Dale Kirmo) St. Martin of Van Meer, Cynthia Wojtowicz of Van Meer, and Kay Polmatier of Munising; seven grandchildren – Dean, Amanda, Bryan, Cora, Nathan, Jamie, and Michael; and numerous great-grandchildren. Marian was preceded in death by her parents, husband Clyde, son-in-law Joseph Wojtowicz, and brothers Melvin and Robert Moritz.\n\nNo public services will be held and Marian will be buried at the Grafton Cemetery in Grafton, Nebraska. If memorial gifts are made, they are requested to be made to the Alger County Animal Shelter in Marian’s name."
