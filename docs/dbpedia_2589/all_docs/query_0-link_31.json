        "text": "In 1900 six men were added to the department and there were three major fires. On June 21, the Hotel Morrison at Lincoln Way East and St. Joseph Streets was destroyed by an explosion and fire killing three men in the process.\n\nOn September 7, 1900, the South Bend Foundry Company plant that was located at Lafayette and Stull Streets was destroyed by fire, a loss of $60,000. Later that year in November the newly built Notre Dame gym was destroyed by fire accruing $40,000 in losses.\n\nIn 1901 Jacob Kerner and Irving Sibrell shared the title of Fire Chief. In April, a huge grain elevator on West Sample Street near Olive was razed to the ground by a fire. The capacity of the elevator was 125,000 bushels and the estimated loss was $120,000.\n\nWilfred Grant took over the position of Fire Chief in 1902 and continued his term through 1913. The first major fire of his term occurred on February 27 when the plant of the Anderson Chilled Plow Company, 22 West Ewing Street, was destroyed by fire. On May 3, two firemen were seriously injured when a ladder truck from the Central Station house and a hose wagon from Station #3 collided at Main and LaSalle Streets while both vehicles were rushing to a fire.\n\nFire Chief Grant made a test run of his brand new buggy on June 3. Built by Studebaker, the buggy was painted fire-engine red and was equipped with ball bearings, rubber tires, lanterns and other essentials. Total cost for the new vehicle was $225.\n\nWhile answering a false alarm, Captain Chester Van Arsdel was seriously hurt, two horses killed and a hose wagon demolished at the Carroll Street Grand Trunk Railroad crossing when a high speed freight train hit them on September 12.\n\nBy 1904 the South Bend Fire Department had grown to 7 stations when Fire Station #7 was put into service at Notre Dame, Indiana.\n\nThe seventh station was obviously needed as the next few years saw a sharp increase in the number of fires. The Suburban Club, a resort on Lincoln Way East across from Playland Park and operated by Joseph Logan, was destroyed by fire on May 31, 1904. On the morning of June 8, the second floor in the Novelty Hack Barn (a hack is a horse that you can rent), 326 S. Michigan Street was consumed by a fire.\n\nThe Vandalia Railroad roundhouse that was located near West Indiana Avenue was completely demolished by fire on July 28. On the evening of September 9, 1904, flames badly damaged a large barn at 540 S. Chapin Street and burned six horses. The barn was formerly used by the firm of Kanouse & Philips Coal Dealers. A fire broke out in the packing room of the South Bend Woolen Company on E. LaSalle Avenue at 5:15 p.m. November 17, causing $10,000 damage.\n\nOn March 15, 1905, a morning fire destroyed the foundry of the South Bend Pulley Company plant at 1400 S. Lafayette. The Art Store owned by Frank Freyermuth at Jefferson and St. Joseph Streets was badly damaged by fire on February 4, 1906. One hundred high grade pigeons (racing pigeons) valued at $1,000 were suffocated in this fire. On the same day, Fire Station #3 was built at 219 N. Hill Street.\n\nA tragedy occurred on August 7, 1906 when three people burned to death in a fire that was started by Mrs. E.H. Denslow while she was temporarily deranged in her residence at 436 N. Main Street. The victims of the fire were Mrs. Denslow, her husband and her sister.\n\nOn November 1, 1906 a volunteer fire department was organized in River Park with Richard Moritz serving as the first Fire Chief.\n\nAt 4:45 a.m. on February 3, 1907, there was a 2nd alarm fire at the Indiana Foundry on Sycamore Street causing $3,200 in damage. Firefighter William Cavanaugh was injured by a falling wall during a fire that was caused by sparks from a stove. A fire which broke out in the south engine room of the Singer Sewing Machine plant on February 20 caused $5,000 damage.\n\nOn February 15, 1907, the Fire Department had an opportunity to display its firefighting techniques when it had exhibition fire runs for the insurance company.\n\nOn March 6, 1907 at 7:20 p.m., the department responded to a chimney fire at the home of Magie Niezgodski, 909 W. Napier Street. On the way to the fire, one of the fire apparatus collided with a streetcar at Michigan and Wayne Streets.\n\nAt 6:13 p.m., March 13, there was a 2nd alarm fire at the business at 471 South Street.\n\nUnder the auspices of the Fireman’s Pension Fund Association, the city firemen staged an elaborate Fourth of July celebration in 1907. In addition to the traditional festivities, the South Bend Fire Department had another reason to celebrate as Fire Station #10 was opened at 1820 S. Michigan Street.\n\nLess than 3 weeks later on July 21, while firemen were responding to an automobile fire at 9:35 p.m., Engine #3 collided with Herman Hopke. Ending the year, a fire gutted the factory at the Sweeping Compound Company, 1108 S. High Street at 10:00 a.m. on Christmas Day.\n\nThe first fire of 1908 was on January 6; a 3rd alarm fire at the George H. Wheelock & Company, 113 W. Washington Street, that caused $11,000 damage. The fire was attributed to spontaneous combustion. Two days later, Mrs. Sezpanich burned to death at 10:15 a.m. That same day ladder truck #2 was put into service at Central Fire Station and a horse drawn engine #10 was put into service at 1820 S. Michigan. August Hoagland was the Captain.\n\nFrom 1909 through 1911 there were 20 fires of major consequence, causing untold thousands of dollars damage and killed four persons. The first fatality occurred on January 29, 1909 when Mrs. Cooley succumbed to the burns she received after throwing oil on a fire. On February 17 fire did much damage in the lumber drying rooms of the carriage department at the Studebaker works. An overheated furnace was the cause of a 3rd alarm fire at the hotel at 538 S. Scott Street at 8:30 a.m. on March 9. On July 10 at 4:25 a.m., there was a 3rd alarm fire at the factory of Smith and Jackson on Michigan Street that caused $6,900 damage. The cause of the fire was unknown. On October 30, at 12:30 p.m. while responding to a barn fire at 315 S. Chapin Street, William Furey’s chief driver was thrown from his buggy at the corner of Division and Taylor and suffered severe bruises. The last fire of 1909 was a 2nd alarm on November 4 at 11:50 a.m. at W.F. Wyant Cold Storage. Damages were $6,200.\n\nThe fire that put the South Bend News temporarily out of commission on February 1, 1910 had the dubious distinction of being the first fire of the year. The 3rd alarm fire broke out at noon in the Mills Building on E. Jefferson and caused $15,000 damage.\n\nOn April 24 at 6:00 a.m. the department answered a 3rd alarm fire at 341 S. Scott Street. While playing with matches, 4-year old Wladislaus Aujarski suffered fatal burns on June 23 at 11:45 a.m.\n\nA disastrous fire occurred on July 18 at 11:00 a.m. that destroyed the Aerial Moving Picture Theater, a large tent with a wooden front that was located on Lincoln Way East near Jefferson Blvd. Four days later there was a 3rd alarm fire at 11:48 a.m. at the corner of Niles and Howard Streets. It was started from an unknown source. On August 19, the Oliver Chilled Plow Works paint shop on S. Arnold Street was destroyed by fire. Losses were in excess of $25,000.\n\nA fire in the August Coddens residence, 502 S. Walnut Street was responsible for the second death that year. The blaze started when a fire was lit with gasoline at 6:00 a.m. on October 26. Mrs. Coddens died at Epworth Hospital at 1:00 p.m. Mr. Coddens was burned on his hands and face, Mary Coddens was burned on her hands.\n\nThe year ended with an $8,000 fire on December 18 at the Diamond Auto Company 2101 S. Main Street. On March 8, 1911, at 11:20 p.m. a 2nd alarm fire caused $4,500 damage at 1801 Ernsberger Street. On April 23, 1911 at 3:50 p.m., there was a 3rd alarm fire at St. Mary’s barn on April 24 at 12:25 a.m. there was another 3rd alarm fire at 405 E. Madison where two horses belonging to Grover Hartman were burned to death.\n\nThe second child fatality attributed to playing with matches in a little over a year occurred on August 4. Five-year old Cora Riffel of the Daniel Riffel residence, 816 N. Eddy Street, burned to death.\n\nNotre Dame was once again the site for a disastrous fire when four large ice houses filled with 4 tons of ice were destroyed on July 9th. The loss was estimated at $20,000.\n\nWhile responding to a fire alarm at 834 Park Avenue on January 5, 1912, Joseph Fearkess, Pipeman #6, froze his hand while Percy Alford, Pipeman Chemical, froze his ears.\n\nOn March 6, a fire at the J.P. McGill Furniture Company store at Michigan and Jefferson did $6,000 damage.\n\nMarch 25 was a significant day in the advancement of the South Bend Fire Department when the first automobile fire apparatus, Chemical #1, was put into service at the Central Fire Station. On April 2 it made its first run with I.W. Sibel as driver. At that time there were 66 men on the department and 377 alarms had been answered so far that year. On November 12, the Chemical Company was sent to Lakeville, Indiana, to aid in a fire.\n\nThat was not the only time that South Bend Fire Department left the city to help other towns fight fires. On July 16, 1913 an explosion of dynamite caps in Walkerton, Indiana, required the assistance of Hose Company #1. The same company assisted Michigan City, Indiana, firefighters on July 12. The Chemical Company went to Crumstown, Indiana, on July 25.\n\nThe first incident involving the South Bend Fired Department and new Fire Chief Irving Sibrell in 1914 was, surprisingly enough, not a fire. On January 3, a three story brick building at 11 S. Michigan collapsed. Although the fire department rushed to the scene, no fire ensued. The first action the firefighters saw that year was in Lakeville on January 14 when the Chemical Company assisted. On February 4, a fire in the Majestic Theater, 131 N. Michigan, caused $4,500 damage.\n\nThree firefighters were injured in the line of duty in 1914. On April 21, Captain Entizon burned his eyes from the explosion of a March 10, 1921 marked the passing of the era of horses as they were replaced by gasoline engines in the South Bend Fire Department. The evolution of firefighting equipment was also accompanied by increased efficiency in firefighting techniques. On April 12, a fire which threatened the entire town of Edwardsburg, Michigan, was stopped by South Bend firemen. The blaze, however, wiped out half a block on Main Street before being stopped. In addition to the new equipment, Fire Station #4 at Thomas and Walnut Streets was rebuilt into a bay station.\n\nMajor fires of 1921 were as follows: February 19, South Bend Bedding Company, 517 S. Scott Street; 3 alarm fire from overheated stove caused $6,000 damage. May 16, The South Bend Grain Elevator and Grand Trunk Coal Docks at Sample and Olive were destroyed by fire, combined loss of $150,000. July 5, 6:00 p.m. 209 S. Kaley Street $1,000 fire. November 2, a 3 alarm fire on the 2nd floor of the Oldsmobile Garage, 226 S. Lafayette, loss $7,000. Totals for 1921: 201 box alarms, 23 false alarms; number of runs: 10,151, 3,929 miles, 197,800 feet of hose, 8,673 feet of ladder, 12,935 gallons of chemicals and 11 tarps used. Total losses $203,209.\n\nThree new pieces of equipment were added to the department in 1922. On June 1, truck #2 was put into service at Fire Station #4. Two days later the new American LaFrance ladder truck #3 was put into service at the Central Fire Station. Also, another American LaFrance pumper was put into service at Fire Station #3 the same day.\n\nThe major fires during 1922 were as follows: January 6, 420 Manitou Place, $2,000 fire in a two story apartment house. January 20, at 2:22 p.m. at 420 S. William, Son of Israel Church hit by $6,500 fire. February 21, a fire on the 3rd floor at the Brandon-Durrell store, 201 S. Michigan caused a loss of $67,000.

On January 16 at 11:57 was the last fire alarm box pulled in over the old fire alarm system. The fire was in a frame garage at 1727 S. Walnut. The cause of the fire was unknown but it was responsible for $700 damage.\n\nTwo days later, the new Alarm Station and Gamewell Fire Alarm System in the city went into service.
