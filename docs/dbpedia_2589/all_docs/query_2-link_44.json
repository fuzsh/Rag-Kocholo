        "text": "Tuesday, January 16, 2024.\n\nBeloved father of Michael (Terry Perez) Kobylinski and Michele Fisher; loving grandfather of Niki Perez, Amanda (Shane) Hanson, Megan (Trevor) Smith and Zach Fisher; adoring great-grandfather of Brooke, Mikala, Nick, Greyson, Austin, Avery and Melanie; cherished brother of Patti Williams; dear companion of Kay Mayberry. Our dearest uncle, great-uncle, cousin and friend to many.\n\nBob graduated from Affton High School in 1954, went on to C.at Mizzou University, and was in the United States Navy until he was Honorably Discharged in 1963.\n\nHe married Mary Ann Davis in 1956 and resided in a mobile trailer in Crestwood, Missouri. They had two children, Michael (1957) and Michele (1961) and purchased their first home in Webster Groves, Missouri in 1958.\n\nBob was an operator for Ackerman Excavating until starting his own excavation business (Koby Contracting Company) in 1969. He was highly recognized in the excavation and drainlaying business for over 50 years. He was heavily involved in volunteer work; such as the Webster Groves Police Department, as a reserve police officer, in the late 1960’s. In the early 1980’s to the early 1990’s he was involved with the Des Peres Optimist Club, which he achieved many titles with the highest being the Lieutenant Governor.\n\nHe was a licensed pilot and had many stories regarding his love of flying! He became a novice water skier up on the Illinois River and passed on the love of water skiing to his children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. If you couldn’t find him at home he was probably in his haven at his Lake of the Ozark property, which he purchased in 1966. On this property he built with his own hands his secondary home, garage, gazebo, waterfall, etc. You could always find him tinkering with something as he couldn’t sit for long. He was a man of talents! His other passions were traveling, boating, fishing, hunting, theater, painting, along with the dearest to his heart, being with friends and family.\n\nHe was a friend to many, had a heart of gold, took care of his family, and had a love for God and his Country.\n\nUntil we meet again dad, SOAR HIGH!!!!!\n\nMemorial visitation at Kutis Affton Chapel 10151 Gravois Rd. 63123 on Saturday, February 3 from 1:00 pm. until Memorial Service time at 4:00 pm.
