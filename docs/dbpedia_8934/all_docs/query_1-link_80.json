        "text": "Far infrared waves penetrate into our body to activate the sweat glands. The sweat glands offer one of only a few mechanisms that the body has to eliminate toxins and since the skin is the largest organ in the human body it is apparently a very good means for elimination. Bring the benefits of an infrared sauna into your home with a new Clearlight® infrared sauna.\n\nWhen far infrared waves are applied to water molecules (comprising 70% of our body) these molecules begin to vibrate. This vibration reduces the ion bonds and the eventual breakdown of the water molecules causes encapsulated gasses and other toxic materials to be released.\n\nFull spectrum refers to the entire infrared spectrum: near infrared, mid infrared and far infrared. With the addition of near and mid infrared, you will get the maximum benefit from your Clearlight® sauna.\n\nNear Infrared is the shortest wavelength, and will be absorbed just below the surface of the skin creating a sweat that promotes healing and revitalization.\n\nMid infrared is a longer wavelength that can penetrate deeper into the body’s soft tissue increasing circulation, releasing oxygen to reach injured areas.\n\nFar infrared is the longest wavelength which penetrates the fat cells causing vasodilation, where the fat cells vibrate to expel toxins, resulting in the greatest levels of detoxification and stimulate your metabolism to aid in weight-loss.\n\nTests have shown that the energy output of our True Wave® far infrared heaters is tuned so closely to the body’s own radiant energy that our bodies absorb as much as 93% of the far infrared waves that reach our skin.\n\nBy comparison, conventional saunas must rely only on indirect means of heat: first, on convection (air currents) and then, conduction (direct contact of hot air with the skin) to produce its heating effect. Your Clearlight Infrared® Sauna is best used at temperatures between 100° to 125°F versus 180° to 220°F for traditional hot-air saunas. Since conventional saunas require 30 to 90 minutes of warm-up before use, electricity costs are reported to be a lot higher than those of Clearlight Infrared® Saunas which are ready to use in 10-15 minutes.\n\nYes! Infrared heat is all around us. This photo below shows everything emits and receives infrared heat. This image was taken with a camera that takes a regular photograph and an infrared image of the subjects at the exact same time.\n\nThe human body emits and receives infrared heat in the far infrared band. Other surfaces, like a warm street or heated vending cart, give off infrared in the middle and near infrared band.\n\nDo you want to experience far infrared heat right now? Take you hands and put your palms together. Move your hands about 1/2 an inch apart. You will feel warmth eminating from your palms. This is far infrared heat very similar to the infrared heat emitted from our True Wave™ heaters. Radiant far infrared is all around us and is essential for human life.\n\nThe main difference between infrared saunas and traditional saunas is how they use heat. Traditional saunas use a single heater that is heating the air and this hot air heats the user. In contrast, infrared saunas use advanced therapy to heat the user directly with only a small percentage of the heat heating the air. This results in a deeper sweat and at a lower ambient air temperature. In fact, infrared saunas usually operate between 115° – 135°F, while traditional saunas can get up to 195°F.\n\nYou will get all of the relaxation benefits of a traditional infrared sauna along with the increased health benefits that infrared offers all at a much more comfortable temperature. Infrared saunas are also dry saunas and many users find this makes for a more comfortable sauna session.\n\nNot only are infrared saunas extremely beneficial, but they are also more efficient and require less electricity (according to Livestrong.com, a traditional sauna is almost three times as expensive to run as an infrared sauna). That also means that the warm-up time of an infrared sauna is much quicker than a traditional sauna.\n\nOur Sanctuary Full Spectrum Saunas offer near, mid, and far infrared technologies and our Premier Far Infrared Saunas offer all of the benefits of far infrared heat. Surround Yourself In Wellness in a Clearlight® infrared sauna."
