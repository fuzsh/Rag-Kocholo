        "meta_description": "Lightning, Show Us Your Stuff by Grant-Lee Phillips, released 04 September 2020\n\n1. Ain&#39;t Done Yet\n2. Drawing the Head\n3. Lowest Low\n4. Leave a Light On\n5. Mourning Dove\n6. Sometimes You Wake Up in Charleston\n7. Gather Up\n8. Straight to the Ground\n9. Coming To\n10. Walking in My Sleep\n\nGrant-Lee Phillips’ latest album, Lightning, Show Us Your Stuff, is a turbulent and highly musical rumination that finds the veteran singer-songwriter addressing the strange fragility of life. His tenth solo release bears the markings of his prolific output, a melodic prowess and an ear for lyric in everyday conversation. The album offers a salve to a wounded world, struggling to regain equilibrium. This is Grant-Lee Phillips at his most reflective, wrestling with the most pertinent of questions. What we value, how we define security, our vulnerability – here Phillips takes stock of the deeper questions with intensity and humor.\r\n\r\nLightning, Show Us Your Stuff is grown from the same rich soil that Phillip’s long career, from Grant Lee Buffalo to his solo work has sprang from. The result is a beautifully human musical tapestry. The warm, live on the floor, instrumental bed is the perfect support for Phillips’ inimitable voice. This spontaneous approach has become a tradition among his solo works.",

        "text": "1.\n\nAin't Done Yet 03:26\n\nVultures on the hitching post Shoo fly shoo You gotta’ ward off those Yea they gotta’ do their job But given the chance They’d dig in the claws Carry some unfortunate one off Circling ‘round above my roof Just wanna’ scream out loud Don’t size me up so soon Well I ain’t done yet More dreaming left to do People sitting at their desk Nothing changes but the tie on their neck Everybody wears a yoke The weight of the past A future unknown I don’t want to live a life like that Circling ‘round like troubles do I just wanna’ scream out loud Don’t size me up so soon Well I ain’t done yet, more dreaming left I may not be young A lot of songs are sung But when you’re half way up Ya never count the rungs Buzzards on the hitching rail Keepin’ a watch out over the trail Let ‘em go and prey on someone else Circling ‘round above my roof I just wanna’ scream out loud Don’t size me up so soon Well I ain’t done yet More dreaming left to do Ain’t dead yet More dreaming left to do Ain’t dead yet More dreaming left More dreaming left to do More dreaming left\n\n2.\n\nDrawing the Head 02:47\n\nWhat if I fail Oh no Afraid I might splinter Into sunlight Charcoal lines Lost in the eyes And the mouth just lies It ain’t nothing but practicing, practice Drawing the head Yea, the rest of me’s riddled with doubt All in my head Pencil and pad Half light Trying to render it all Shafts and shadows Scars on the face Fragile like a doll It ain’t nothing but practicing, practice Drawing the head Yea, the rest of me’s riddled with doubt All in my head It ain’t nothing but practicing, practice Drawing the head\n\n3.\n\nLowest Low 03:22\n\nSafe in the room Spin a cocoon Safe in the room for now Face in the steam I don’t want to be seen I don’t want to bring you down Not like this Not at my weakest Not at my lowest low Safe in the wings Fade into the scenery Safe in the wings awhile Heart in the game What do they mean? Walk out and fake a smile? Not like this Not at my weakest Not at my lowest low Not like this Not at my bleakest Not at my lowest low\n\n4.\n\nAim this bird in your direction Gotta’ get me home Been draggin’ ‘round my case too long Starved of sunlit days Waking to an endless dawn But a man ain’t made to be this strong I got a ways to go The stars are all that I can see But I’ll be there before you know Just leave a light on Leave a light on for me Well I miss your face Being the first one that I see each day Talk on the phone is not the same But is it wrong because I love it when I do my job And I just ain’t found no better way I got some miles to go The stars are all that I can see I’ll be there before you know Just leave a light on Leave a light on Leave a light on for me Leave a light on for me Aim this bird in your direction Gotta’ get me home Feels like time is moving slow But it’s so dark outside these windows Mama, here we go One more circle ‘round the globe And when you’re fast asleep Let me come into your dreams I’ll be there before you know Just leave a light on Leave a light on Leave a light on for me Leave a light on for me\n\n5.\n\nMourning Dove 04:12\n\nEmpty handed you enter Empty handed you leave On the long walk, temptation gleams Like silver coins on money trees Open hearted you enter Open hearted you step To be dazzled by fortune The things we chase that can't be kept One day I’m gonna’ lay my head In the long cool shadow of the dogwood Lay back and let the cotton clouds go by White blossom of the mountain laurel The wild flowers and the smoke bush No weeping when the mourning dove arrives On the highway there’s suffering On the highway there's loss Many tolls on the road that turns Great miles to cross One day I’m gonna’ lay my head In the long cool shadow of the dogwood Lay back and let the cotton clouds go by White blossom of the mountain laurel The wild flowers and the smoke bush No weeping when the mourning dove arrives No weeping when the mourning dove arrives One day I’m gonna’ lay my head In the long cool shadow of the dogwood Lay back and let the cotton clouds go by White blossom of the mountain laurel The wild flowers and the smoke bush No weeping when the mourning dove arrives No weeping when the mourning dove arrives No weeping when the mourning dove arrives No weeping when the mourning dove arrives\n\n6.\n\nSometimes you wake up in Charleston At the height of summertime Crack open the window Hear the bells of Emanuel chime You seek out the shade when in Charleston Walk along Meeting and Queen Live oak and azaleas And the white crepe myrtle trees Folks, they hold the door out And they offer you \"God bless\" How you wind up in Charleston Is anybody's guess Sometimes you wake up in South Carolina Rain in the gutter outside Tapping away like a snare drum As you wipe the sleep from your eyes And nothing moves fast, here in Charleston The cars on the avenue crawl Like a funeral procession Barely moving at all The folks, they hold a hand out And they offer you \"God bless\" How you wind up in Charleston Is anybody's guess In the holiest city of Charleston Where men were once enslaved They keep the railings polished Azaleas on the grave Sometimes you wake up in Charleston Sometimes you wake up in Charleston\n\n7.\n\nGather Up 02:59 video\n\nGather up your children The earth is reelin’ The seas are bound to swell The ground, it trembles underneath your feet Awaken to the warning bell Gather up children Don’t you wait ‘til mornin’ For the nightingale has sang Skies are weeping and the dogs run wild The bells of the steeple

eyes Someone at the Legion Hall last night Caught up in some endless guessing game Wondering if that someone feels the same Swear I’d like to burn this place straight to the ground Everything here just reminds me that I’m missing out I’d love to set a fire to all of it It ain’t worth a matchstick to me now Trains don’t even stop here anymore If they did, I wouldn’t know what for What I’d give to buy a ticket out I’d be gone before you heard the door Swear I’d like to burn this place straight to the ground Everything, it just reminds me that I’m missing out Missing out on more than I can say Someday I’d like to set it all aflame I had a dream that I was walking on the beach In the white foam of the sea I felt the sands down underneath me start to shift And the waves crash over me Out west they sleep under the moon Have their breakfast brought out by the pool You never ring them ‘til the afternoon It’s how they do in Hollywood Swear I’d like to burn this place straight to the ground Everything, it just reminds me that I’m missing out I’d love to set a fire to all of it It ain’t worth a matchstick to me now Swear I’d like to burn this place straight to the ground

Straight to the ground Straight to the ground\n\n9.\n\nComing To 04:36\n\nFeel the warmth of the morning sun Move from corner to corner Fill the room up with golden hues Contentment comes Noisy clock on the wall slows down As you breathe for the first time And your heart can't remember when You slept so sound Now the fog has finally lifted And the daylight's breaking through It’s been a longtime drifting But I'm coming to Through the wilderness, we must crawl For what seems like forever Till the clear light of mercy shines Down on us all Now the fog has finally lifted And the daylight's breaking through It’s been a longtime drifting But I'm coming to Half awake But I’m coming to No need to hide those tears They will surely dry Just as darkness yields to twilight Now the fog has finally lifted And the daylight's breaking through It’s been a longtime drifting Half awake, but I'm coming to Half awake, but I'm coming to Coming to I’m coming to I’m coming to Coming to\n\n10.\n\nWalking in My Sleep 03:20"
