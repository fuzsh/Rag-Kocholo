        "text": "You’ve probably heard how the right infrared sauna can improve your life, lead to all sorts of health benefits, YouTuber’s reporting 40% reduction in all cause mortality, etc… problem is, all these sauna companies tout XYZ unique feature to rope you in, and you can’t tell what’s worthwhile and what’s nonsense.\n\nIs Clearlight one of them, and is the Premier or Sanctuary really worth it?\n\nHi I’m Matt Justice, maybe you’ve seen my youtube videos on saunas, or read some of my articles on health improvement. In this article, lets go over some pros and cons of the Clearlight Infrared Sauna lineup from my point of view… after testing over 13 different sauna brands now.\n\nOne Major Problem With Clearlight Saunas\n\nThe major problem with Clearlight Saunas, is they’re sold as a Full Spectrum sauna, often times over reaching what that’ll do for you. Of course it depends on who helps you, but very often people are selling you a sauna based on marketing and not their own experience with it.\n\nNow what does this mean? The way they market the sanctuary sauna as “full spectrum”, meaning it has near, mid, and far infrared wavelengths in for, for complete infrared wavelength coverage. This is simply not true the way it’s explained 90% of the time.\n\nThe problem is, many sales agents are also taking this out of context, using NASA based low level laser therapy studies (readily available on PubMed) to sell these saunas.\n\n(key point: red light therapy does nothing to contribute to your sweat, so you really don’t NEED it in a sauna. But when you think you’re getting it but you’re really not, is when the trouble really starts… you’re spending extra money on a sauna that’s not doing what you think it’s doing)\n\nTrouble is, they don’t produce actual red light therapy wavelengths on their own when I tested them with a spectrometer, which you need to get the PBMT photobiomodulation benefits like in the NASA studies.\n\nSee here:\n\nThis chart has the wavelength at the bottom of the screen, and you can clearly see there the near infrared falls off a cliff from about 1,000 nm and down.\n\nNow how big of an issue is this? Not a huge one if you’ve seen this article, and understand a little bit of what I’m explaining here.\n\nWell how’s that Matt?\n\nThe main issue comes into play when you spend extra money on a full spectrum sauna, thinking you’re getting far infrared (which is what makes you sweat) and near infrared (or red light therapy), which contributes to skin healing, cellular ATP benefit, and a whole host of other things you can research on pubmed.\n\nTrouble is, you won’t be getting any of those wavelengths from your full spectrum sauna like you see the benefits of in the study.\n\nIf you did, the spectrometer would look like this red light therapy device I use before my sauna sessions here:\n\nSee how it peaks at the wavelengths all the research studies are done on?\n\nThis is missing in most full spectrum saunas, which includes Clearlight Sanctuary’s. They’re literally just quartz halogen patio heaters added to the front, not some special sauce from NASA.\n\nAnd don’t think this is limited to just Clearlight Saunas either, a flagship Sunlighten M Pulse also suffers from a similar problem as well, albeit a bit different because they put red light panels behind a grill and limit them to one side of your body on a computer controlled cycle.\n\nSo Don’t Buy A Clearlight Sauna?\n\nSo does that mean Clearlight Saunas don’t work well? Quite the contrary, they work good and I recommend them if it fits what you’re looking for. Just be sure you don’t get roped into buying some nonsense, and then not getting the right wavelengths to experience all the benefits of true red light therapy.\n\nUpdate – You know I’ve been doing this many years, and these articles only show the last updated date. Things have changed since I originally wrote this quite a bit, and Clearlight now offers a Red Light Therapy Tower add on you can put in Clearlight Sanctuary Saunas.\n\nDoes this remedy this issue altogether?\n\nNot exactly. For one, I don’t like how The Sanctuary Models are sold as “Full Spectrum” saunas, and then you have to buy a red light tower to get true photobiomodulation red light therapy.\n\nIf it had all three wavelengths to begin with as touted, why would you need to do that? You wouldn’t. Plain and simple.\n\nThey’re still good saunas EMF and VOC wise, even though the Sanctuary models don’t test as well as the Premier models (which is why you don’t find them on The Certified Sauna List), but there are some issues with timing your red light therapy during your sauna session. It’s not ideal. When your body is super heated, and you’re covered in a thick layer of sweat, AND your core temperature is elevated, the absorption from red light therapy can decrease. Optimally, you want clean dry skin for maximum benefit, and preferably when you’re not overheated. (you want to get ALL of the red light therapy benefits)\n\nAre Clearlight Sauna Accessories Worth It?\n\nThe red light therapy add on is loved by many members in our sauna Facebook group. The benefit to it is you can save time by combining your sauna session and your red light therapy session.\n\nThe con to it, is you can only get red light coverage on one side, since the panel mounts to the glass door in front. I personally like to lay down and do my red light sessions, 5 mins on the front, 5 mins on the back.\n\nYou’ll have to weigh out what’s most important to you whether or not you use red light therapy in your sauna or separately. I should also note, this is not unique to Clearlight saunas either, you can add red light therapy to any sauna, and vice versa.\n\nSo what’s the answer here?\n\nWell I can tell you what I do for myself, and you can decide if something similar is right for you.\n\nPersonally, I use a standard far infrared sauna like you see us inside of in my Facebook group (join us here), usually a Radiant Health Sauna E2H or similar, and my standalone red light therapy body panel for maximum results.\n\nGenerally I do my red light therapy session outside of my sauna while my sauna is preheating, and it’s pretty quick. I’m very relaxed when by the end of my protocol, and enjoy the separate benefits of both sauna and red light therapy immensely.\n\nConclusion: Buy A Clearlight (or not?)\n\nNow does that mean you shouldn’t buy a Clearlight Sauna at all? Absolutely not, I still recommend them.\n\nIf you’re looking for a Wi-Fi controlled sauna with a smartphone app, or want an all glass front sauna, or need something Yoga or ADA compliant, sometimes Clearlight is the only choice.\n\nSo that should help you stay out of the weeds with how Clearlight Saunas are respresented at times, and this varies depending on which dealer you call of course, which sales agent you talk to, etc… (which is why I recommend our FB group rep to buy all your Clearlight saunas from if you decide Clearlight is right for you, she’ll treat you right, tell her Matt Justice sent you, she’ll treat you even better! 😉 )\n\nClearlight Sauna Pros & Cons\n\nPros:\n\nTruly low EMF & low ELF\n\nGood build quality\n\nGood preheat time (does not take forever and a day to heat up)\n\nSeveral sizes for almost any application (including ADA compliant models & yoga sizes)\n\nTrue outdoor sauna models offered (with weather protection)\n\nFinancing offered\n\nCons:\n\nFull spectrum upsell\n\nBest Place To Buy In 2023?\n\nwww.infraredsauna.com\n\nphone: (800) 317-5070\n\nemail: [email protected]\n\nUse coupon code: “matt-justice-500” for a discount on any sauna brand of your choosing, not just Clearlight saunas\n\nIn this review, you’ll be able to see firsthand if this home sauna is the right one for you. Instead of blowing smoke up your behind like every other sauna “reviewer,” we’ll test this Clearlight sauna against the other good choices… and see how it stacks up.\n\nMost influencers and online reviews just look at the website of the sauna, and tell you their opinion on it. When you check the Certified Sauna List, you’ll see off the bat that I’m sitting inside the actual saunas, testing them and using them myself.\n\nThere’s no Tom Foolery like deferring to 3rd party emf reports, and blah blah… nope, home grown real world use of every sauna listed in the review section.\n\nIf you’re in a hurry, and just want the cliff notes, here they are:\n\nIn my older Clearlight sauna videos below, you’ll be able to see firsthand that this company offers one of the lowest EMF saunas in the industry. Also commonly spelled Clear Light, this sauna is made to mitigate both electric fields and magnetic fields. That’s in contrast to other saunas on the market, which mitigate just one of the two. This is true for a lot of infrared sauna companies!\n\n(But hardly anyone will show you that in their live video reviews, which frustrated me to no end.)\n\nThat’s why I decided to start testing all the different sauna options myself. I test for both electric and magnetic fields on video so you see firsthand what the different options are transmitting. No more do you have to cross your fingers and hope for the best. Like me, you likely want to get into a Clearlight sauna often – without worrying about what’s happening to your body.\n\nWHAT TO BUY: I get it if you want to skip reading through the sauna reviews (here and all across the internet) and just want to know which Clear Light sauna is likely right for you. So, overall, the Clearlight Premier is a solid choice for anyone looking for a good, low-EMF home sauna. In fact, the Premier IS-2 is a perfect fit for most homeowners in that it’s a two-person FIR sauna that works on a 15-amp circuit. That’s probably why it’s one of the most popular options, allowing anyone to set up a two-person sauna without hiring an electrician to upgrade your circuit to a 20-amp or higher.\n\n(Nothing worse than setting a budget, making an investment, and then not being able to use the dang thing until you spend more money.)\n\nBut I understand better than anyone that a sauna review resource should also provide all the information you need on Clearlight saunas to help you make an informed purchasing decision. Get ready to get exactly that!\n\nSick Of Shady Clearlight Sauna Reviews From Haters & Competitors? Me Too.\n\nI was so tired of seeing shady Clearlight infrared sauna reviews. It’d be one thing if it was because they’re not a great product, but (pretty much) every time, they’re by disgruntled competitors. Either that, or they’re shot on shaky cell phones and use nothing more than a Trifield meter – that’s on the wrong setting! Then they claim that the full spectrum Sanctuary heaters have high EMF levels. Since they’re not using it right to test the sauna, that information is wrong at best and manipulative at worst. So, yeah. “Frustrating” would be putting it lightly.\n\nSo, I decided to Test and Review Saunas Myself\n\nYep, I was so tired of those ridiculously biased or poorly performed reviews, I started testing several brands of infrared saunas myself. So far, I’ve tried the Sunlighten, JNH Lifestyles, Dynamic, and a handful of other major players.\n\nHave you already been researching saunas? Doing all the research alone can be overwhelming, especially when you’re expected to compare and contrast, weigh the pros and cons, and know what to look for, ask about, and be aware of. Here, you’ll get all the info on saunas you need so you can choose the one that’s right for you.\n\nMy overall hope is that my reviews are helpful for anyone looking for accurate, firsthand, live video information from an experienced professional, one with the expertise to cross-compare the many choices.\n\nI also offer an exclusive promo code that you can use to minimize your investment on a Clear Light sauna, and it includes the popular ergonomic backrest add-on. Take $400 to $600 off (plus the popular ergonomic backrest) here.\n\nMy Approach to Sauna Reviews\n\nI care the most about low EMF levels, but I also pay attention to people’s comments on my YouTube channel and the Facebook group. If there is anything you’d like to know about Clearlight saunas, let me know in the comments below so that I can include it in my review when I shoot the videos.\n\nThis is a crucial element to my review approach: I want to cover any and all areas that might be of interest so that you know exactly what you’re buying before it arrives. It’s far too easy to get false information online, and end up with a sauna that you simply can’t use – or one that you wouldn’t want if you got the right advice.\n\nI personally DO NOT TRUST any of the TriField meter videos floating around the Facebook groups. Most people have no idea how to use a meter – and don’t even know if they’re measuring RF or ELF. For one thing, saunas only have RF if they have a Bluetooth stereo or built-in Wi-Fi.\n\nSo, if the sauna doesn’t have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and the TriField meter is used to measure RF, boom, you have a low-EMF sauna! Wow, magic. Either that, or an outright (and potentially intentional) lie that’s designed to get you to buy a sauna you would otherwise pass over.\n\nWhat’s especially maddening about these false videos is the fact that you’re looking for a sauna that doesn’t produce an abundant amount of EMF. Sure, some people shop for saunas without worrying about something like that, but you’re being particularly diligent about your well-being and the health and safety of loved ones, visitors, and so on. Lying about the EMF output with that in mind is plain ole immoral. But it’s also wrong to flippantly use a TriField meter to test for something this important without knowing how to use or read it.\n\nIf you’re one of those reviewers, please stop. If you’re everyone else, please stop watching them and reach out to me instead – and save yourself a TON of headaches in the long run.\n\nAn Example of One of My Clearlight Sauna EMF Test Review Video\n\nOne thing I really like about Clearlight saunas is that they are endorsed by Dr. Brian Clement, the director of the Hippocrates Institute in South Florida. I value his opinion, and believe he has more experience with alternative health therapies than anyone else that I know of. (Okay, okay. He’s a bit extreme with the wheatgrass and liquitarian raw food diet stuff, but who could call any of that unhealthy?)\n\nBasically, Dr. Brian Clement is a guy who’s widely considered a pioneer of today’s era of self-care, and there must be a reason why he won’t stay in a hotel unless it has a sauna. In fact, he saunas every day, claiming that it’s a critical component to keeping the body detoxed. This is particularly useful for those in a metropolitan area, where the air itself can be heavy with toxins.\n\nBut don’t take his, or my word for the health benefits of saunas. According to Medical News Today, additional benefits include:\n\nEasing muscle pain\n\nImproving joint movement\n\nAlleviate stress\n\nPromoting cardiovascular health\n\nReducing psoriasis\n\nDelivering asthma relief\n\nAccording to the same article, FIRS themselves have been linked to boosting exercise performance and minimizing chronic fatigue, making a Clearlight sauna a great addition to a home gym.\n\nClearlight models also feature the option Vibration Resonance Therapy (VRT) add-on, which can improve relaxation.\n\nI Cover Both the Pros and Cons of Clearlight Saunas\n\nClearlight saunas are supposed to have the best infrared penetration of almost any modern carbon heater sauna on the market. They’re also supposed to have wonderfully low EMF. To figure out the pros and cons, I consider both of these major selling points and break them down against competitor models.\n\nFor example, we see reviews all the time of people saying they’ve never sweat as much in their life as they did when they got into a Clearlight sauna. Meanwhile, I’ve been on a three-mile hike on an 85-degree day and didn’t sweat as much as I did in any sauna. That is to say that I sweat just fine in a Sunlighten Mpulse. But do I sweat more in the Clearlight saunas? That’s what we’re going to find out!\n\nOf course, we’ll also test EMF. The point is, though, that we’ll cover all of it.\n\nClearlight Sauna Tested: Clearlight Premier IS-2\n\nThis is the two-person model, with integrated front heaters in the sidewalls. It’s not the most expensive two-person, but it’s the largest size you can find that’s compatible with a 15-amp circuit (standard house circuit). Comparatively, larger saunas require dedicated 20-amp lines, which have to be put in by an electrician. (So, with this model of sauna, you’re saving money in more ways than one. Not too shabby!)\n\nThe Clearlight Premier IS-2 is available in cedar or basswood. The standard model offers an ergonomic backrest and bench, reservation mode, and chromotherapy lighting. It takes about an hour to install, and it has a convenient, versatile holder for smartphone or tablet viewing.\n\nClear Light also claims that it has the lowest EMF levels in the industry…\n\nEMF Ratings: Is Clearlight Really Low EMF?\n\nIn short, yes it is super low emf. And not just low magnetic fields, it’s also low electric fields, which leads to low body voltage – something that I love to see.\n\nIn my test video a little higher up on the page, you can see me testing the Clearlight saunas live for all types of EMF. Most sauna companies and salespeople defer you to third-party EMF reports, but I don’t believe in those. You cannot take the heaters out of the sauna, ship them to a lab, and then say it’s low EMF.\n\nIn the test video, though, you can see I have an Electric Field Meter, TriMeters, Magnetic Fields Meters, and RF Meters. In addition to those, I check body voltage with a voltmeter to ensure everything is super low for the EHS customers out there.\n\nIn the end, Clearlight scores an A+ rating. That’s incredibly rare for me. I’m extremely pleased with the Clearlight Premier IS-2, and it was a no-brainer inclusion in my Certified Sauna List, which only hosts THREE recommended saunas so far. To say it’s exclusive is to put it lightly, and the fact that the Clearlight Premier IS-2 is included is a true testament to how much it blew my socks off.\n\nClearlight Sauna Model Cost / Price List\n\nThis Clearlight sauna ranges from the lower $3,000 range to above $4,000 depending on which size you want. They have models that are small one-person saunas and they have large four-person infrared models. Keep in mind, once you go larger than a two-person size, you will need to consult with an electrician to upgrade your wiring.\n\nPRO-TIP: Make sure to check with an electrician before you get the sauna. Don’t assume you’ll be able to put it wherever you want it. Yes, you’ll almost certainly be able to wire it, even if it’s a concrete wall with no outlet. But what’s it going to cost? Is it logistically prudent? Consult with an electrician, make sure you’re good to go, then get your dream sauna. (And, boy, once you get the right sauna, what a dream it is.)\n\nAlso, do not listen—repeat, DO NOT listen—to the Clearlight sauna resellers on YouTube telling you to put a 15- to 20-amp extension cord adapter on your wall outlet. You cannot create a dedicated 20-amp circuit for your Clearlight sauna simply by shutting things off, using outlet clickers, and swapping out the wall outlet to a 20-amp prong. (It does not change the small gauge wire in the wall, which means it’s not adequate no matter what any sauna person tells you. Please consult with a licensed electrician if you need to do this. I’d bet big bucks they tell you the same thing!)\n\nFIRE-HAZARD WARNING: Another major issue with using an extension cord adapter? If you overload the circuit to the point of breaker fault, it can melt the wire in the wall and start a fire. That’s why you need to be incredibly careful listening to ANY advice from resellers. They’re likely trying to do little more than smooth the edges so you’ll make the purchase.\n\nAgain, if you’re ever unsure about anything, I run a YouTube channel with livestreams where you can ask questions multiple days per week. Right now we’re doing the 30 for 30 Sauna Challenge, every night at 9pm Eastern time.\n\nWhere To Buy Clearlight Saunas At The Best Price?\n\nDon’t fall for the constant barrage of “buy now before blah blah excuse….” The best place to buy your Clearlight Jacuzzi sauna, is from the recommended dealer listed on the Certified Sauna List. Things were different a few years ago, and you could get good service several places buying your Clearlight… but lately, there have been customers scammed out of thousands of dollars, from fake retailers who just take the money and run. To top it off, you have a call center that now handles Clearlight sauna sales when you buy direct, and I’m getting emails every single week about how they’re misinforming customers left and right. On the Certified Sauna List, there will be a direct phone number where you’ll be sure to speak to someone that knows what they’re talking about, and not get stuff with a pushy salesman that doesn’t even own a sauna. On top of their terrible advice that’s designed strictly to get you to buy, not to help you understand what you’re getting, they’re prone to customer complaints. I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve had people call me to complain that they were duped them, and that makes me wonder how many are out there that I haven’t heard from. Avoid them at all costs! You don’t want to buy from the same people making the awful videos that brought you to my site to begin with. (this is not limited to Clearlight brand saunas, in general across the board)\n\nShould I Buy a Used Clearlight Sauna?\n\nI get this question a lot. Should you buy a used Clear Light sauna? And while I always recommend going with a brand-new model if you can afford it, especially since I can get you in touch with a member of their team for a great deal, the answer isn’t known.\n\nThe real answer: It depends.\n\nIt could be a good idea. It could be a bad idea. And that’s the case with any sauna, not just the Clearlight. To find out if you want to buy one that’s used, you need to determine the answer to specific questions. Here are just a few:\n\nHow old is the sauna? It can be so old that it’s cusping on its shelf-life. You don’t want to buy a sauna just for it to fail on you soon after for the simple fact that it’s worn out.\n\nHow much is it compared to a new one? Are you saving enough to make it worth it? You might not want to forgo a warranty and a brand-new product for the sake of a few hundred bucks off.\n\nAre you sacrificing something to get a deal? You need the space that you need. You want the add-ons that you want. These are things that make a HUGE difference, and can be very much worth the extra money.\n\nLet’s Chat!\n\nIf you’ve read through the comments below or on any of my pages, you’ll see people testify to the fact that this can be a very daunting process to pick the right sauna. Rest assured, I put out several videos on YouTube that cover many of the fine details on this, and regularly answer questions below.\n\n>> 2023 Update: joint he private Facebook group for more reviews\n\nBuying a sauna can be a legitimately life-changing purchase, giving your home a tremendous addition to your self-care ritual. The potential health benefits are numerous, and the extremely low EMF of the Clearlight sauna Premier IS-2 model means total peace of mind. I couldn’t recommend it enough, and I look forward to getting into specifics geared toward your unique needs, wants, and goals.\n\nIn general, I highly encourage you to post your question in the comments below. No matter how specific, there’s a good chance someone else is wondering the same thing. Further, I can include it in my video review so you can see your question get answered live in real-time if you’d like, and they can be anonymous also.\n\nAlternatives to Clearlight?\n\nYou can check out the Radiant Health Elite Series if the Clearlight ends up not being for you."
