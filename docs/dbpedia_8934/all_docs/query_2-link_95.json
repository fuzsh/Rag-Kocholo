Step inside and you’ll find a haven where most people, depending on size and height, can fully stretch out, or even lay down, for the ultimate relaxation. It’s no surprise that this sauna is a fan favorite, boasting one of the most popular selling points in our lineup. Picture this: a width of 66 inches on the interior, giving you room to breathe, stretch, and maybe even sneak in a few exercises if you’re feeling extra motivated.\n\nBut the Clearlight Sanctuary 3 isn’t just about space. It’s a sleek stunner, too! With its polished appearance, this sauna becomes the ideal canvas for adding halo therapy and red light therapy. Sure, all our saunas can rock these features, but the Sanctuary 3 takes it to the next level. The extra space not only accommodates but enhances the flow, making it the perfect choice for those looking to elevate their sauna experience. Clearlight Sanctuary 3, where spacious comfort meets sleek style for the ultimate relaxation haven. Thank you for considering us on your wellness journey!"
