        "text": "Seattle – June 10, 2011. Seattle based LED Lighting Manufacturer, Evluma, announces the installation of the first test units at the United States Naval Air Station, Patuxent River, Maryland. Evluma provided its 40W EcoSpot and 50W Beacon Clearlight models for evaluation and has worked with the base Energy Manager for the last 9 months to prepare for the evaluation. Evluma Clearlights are designed to easily install in existing NEMA Type V security light fixtures and can operate either with or without the legacy ballast in the circuit, providing very cost effective installation.\n\n“We are very pleased to see the first US Navy installation of Evluma Clearlights,” said Dave Tanonis, Vice President of Sales and Marketing of Evluma. “NEMA fixtures are utilized in many settings on the base including building mounts, parking lots, and marina roadway lighting. The first test installation in the parking lot adjacent to the radar test range replaced six 100 watt High Pressure Sodium lamps with two 50 watt Beacon Clearlights and provided great illumination along with significant energy reduction.”\n\nKarl Bryan, Energy Manager for NAS Patuxent River, utilized a focus group evaluation along with electrical and illumination measurements to characterize the performance of the Evluma Clearlights.\n\n“Evluma has worked with us for several months and has provided a great solution for NEMA Type V upgrades,” said Karl Bryan. “The radar test range Clearlight installation actually provides more illumination than the original High Pressure Sodium lamps with 1950 watts lower input power.”\n\nAbout Evluma\n\nEvluma is a division of Express Imaging Systems, LLC (EIS), a company that has been designing award winning, high-power LED applications for the photographic industry since 1995. Formed in 2008, Evluma is committed to developing environmentally low impact lighting solutions that are affordable and long lasting.
