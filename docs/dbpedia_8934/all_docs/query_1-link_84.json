        "text": "Well, it's not easy to describe the beauty of the six long instrumental songs, which are rich of free flowing structures where every instruments plays equal to the others. So I want to start with some facts about TMKoC. This five-piece is based in the Louisiana area, and the most well-known musician of this line-up is Jimmy Bower. He's (or was) playing drums for Crowbar, Down and COC and he plays guitar in Superjoint Ritual and, of course, EyeHateGod. TMKoC is another band, where he plays with four other very talented musicians together and the result is absolutley amazing.All the music is instrumental and a hammond is giving this jammings something like a early 70's heavy progressive vibe. But don't misunderstand me, this isn't one of those boring cheesy retro bands, that wants to sound like Uriah Heep or Deep Purple.\n\nAnd you can't compare them with newer Spiritual Beggars, because TMKoC are more Blues, instead of Metal. Just listen to \"El Nino Brown\" that clocks in 17:29 minutes or the energetic \"Ride Out\", or.... I could go on and on, there isn't one boring song on this CD. All tracks were born out of jams, because that's the way all songs have been created. The thick and powerful production is awesome, it sounds as if the band would play right beside your seat and it underlines the mighty heaviness of TMKoC. This is only one of the few albums, where you can sit down and you take a musical trip through deft changes in tempo, very relaxed moments but when this band starts to rock, you had to stand up and play the air-guitar. I love this album to much and I can write on and on and on, but nobody needs that so it's better for me to stop and give you the advice, to order this highly recommandable masterpiece from TEE PEE RECORDS.\n\n(KK)"
