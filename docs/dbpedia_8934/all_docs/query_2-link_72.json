        "text": "“Good things come to those who sweat”\n\nI am incredibly excited to be affiliated with Australia’s best sauna company, Clearlight Saunas.\n\nSauna has played an intrinsic part in my health and wellbeing the last few years, especially after my recent spinal injury. Having been forced to step away from exercise, sauna was my saving grace – when I could get to one.\n\nThat’s why I decided to put investing in a quality sauna at the top of my priority list and since coming across Clearlight Saunas, I have not looked back.\n\nTheir quality, non-toxic, eco-friendly and cost effective materials ticked all the boxes. Plus, they make a great variety of saunas including the Dome Portable Sauna - perfect for my minimalist traveller lifestyle!\n\nScroll to the bottom of the page for your $50 discount code.\n\nWhy I use sauna\n\nSince starting to exercise again 2 months ago, daily infrared sauna has played a huge role in my healing and recovery protocol.\n\nTraditionally sauna is used for relaxation, but for me increasing blood flow and sweating through this method has reduced muscle soreness, provided comfort and improved mobility in my once stiff neck, given me more energy and helped me completely de-stress at the end of my day.\n\nThe Benefits of Clearlight Infrared Saunas\n\nBelow are some of the features behind why I chose to buy a Clearlight Sauna.\n\nState of the Art Technology\n\nOur far infrared heaters have been specifically developed to produce optimal wavelengths between 6-12 microns that match that of the human body.\n\n360 Infrared Heat\n\nOur saunas have heaters on the front wall, back wall, side walls and underneath the bench, heating your body from every direction. This surrounds your body and targets your core, rather than heating the sauna cabin air.\n\nEnergy Friendly and Cost Efficient\n\nWhen used indoors, our saunas take 10-15 minutes to heat up. They have been designed to run off the household mains power. Costs for running one of our infrared saunas are between 20-45 cents per hour.\n\nCompletely Non-toxic Materials\n\nAll our saunas use only non-toxic glues and varnishes, making our saunas ideal for people who are chemically sensitive. The Eco Certified solid wood frame is healthier for you than plywood frames, which emit toxic fumes when heated.\n\nNo EMF And Low ELF Technology\n\nOur True Wave II infrared heaters - a patent pending method - are also the only carbon-based infrared heaters with virtually no EMF (Electromagnetic Fields).\n\nDesigned for Easy Assembly\n\nAssembly of your sauna usually takes 2 people about an hour and a half. Premier and Essential saunas require no tools, and only an allen wrench (which is included) and a screwdriver are required for our Sanctuary saunas. Your infrared sauna is pre-wired and clips and latches together with ease.\n\nLifetime Warranty On Residentially Used Sauna\n\nYour Jacuzzi infrared sauna purchase is a once in a lifetime investment in your health and your lifestyle. We paid close attention to every detail to ensure the highest quality sauna available and we back these words with our exclusive Lifetime Warranty on the entire sauna. This warranty covers the entire sauna - the wood cabin, heaters, controls and even the audio system.\n\nGet $50 off your Sauna\n\nVisit Clearlight Infrared Sauna website OR\n\nVisit the Portable Dome Sauna website\n\nUse my referral code ‘WILDTHINGLEAH’ in the message box or when talking to the team\n\nGet $50 off your sauna. Simple!\n\nNote: As an affiliate of Clearlight Saunas, Leah receives a small commission on every sale via the link on her website."
