        "text": "â\n\nPartnership With New Zealand Campus of Innovation and Sport\n\nClearlight Saunas International Announce Partnership with the New Zealand Campus of Innovation and Sport: Providing Custom Infrared Sauna and Red Light Chamber For Elite Sports Recovery Wing.\n\nClearlight Saunas International are happy to announce that they are partnering with the New Zealand Campus of Innovation and Sport (NZCIS) by providing a state-of-the-art infrared sauna and recovery red light and near-infrared light chamber for some of the best athletes in the world.\n\nThe NZCIS campus houses, globally, some of the most well-known sports teams and will be, without a doubt, a new generation recovery centre for the worldâs most elite athletes.\n\nSports Performance Director for the NZCIS, Mr. Jamie Tout, has said âIn the recovery wing we have gone for a custom team infrared sauna supplied by Clearlight Saunas International and capped it off with a MECOTEC Cryotherapy Chamber, global leaders in Cryotechnology.â\n\nEver since Co CEOâs Sebastian Mierau and Johannes Kettelhodt started Clearlight Saunas Internationalâs journey together over seven years ago, they had a dream to be involved with the professional sports industry in New Zealand.\n\nMr. Kettelhodt states âNew Zealand is a leading country in terms of its innovation in the field of professional sports, performance, and also recovery as a major driver for elite performance. We are so grateful to be a part of this project and proud to be acknowledged as the global infrared sauna of choice for elite athletes.â\n\nNew Zealand Campus of Innovation and Sport boasts over 350 accommodation rooms and is a one stop shop for global sports teams to train, eat, sleep and repeat.\n\nClearlight Saunas International is excited about the next stage in the campus development, with four new sand based fields, 1,000m2 strength room, recovery center, Watt Bike Studio and 70x50m indoor field, all part of a significant development opening in 2022.\n\nâ\n\nLocal Manufacturing\n\nClearlight Saunas International Progresses To Manufacture Locally In Australia with the Support of Business Australia\n\nClearlight Saunas Australia would like to announce their successful intake into Business Australiaâs Entrepreneur Program and decision to pursue manufacturing locally in Australia.\n\nJoining Business Australiaâs bespoke Growth Roadmap, and GrowCFO mentoring program, Clearlight Saunas International Co-CEO Sebastian Mierau is committed to innovating and manufacturing in regional Brunswick Heads, Northern NSW with the support of Business Australia.\n\nâWe had identified a growth opportunity and developed IP for a unique portable IR sauna to add to our upcoming range which is a game changer for the wellness sector. Itâs our mandate to make quality IR wellness technology and other wellness modalities more accessible and portable to those in needâ stated Mr. Mierau.\n\nImplementing a broad range of recommendations and making the most of free services outlined in the bespoke Growth Roadmap through the Entrepreneurs Programme the first step was to engage Growth facilitator Maria Collyer to develop a Growth Roadmap and seek advice on expert manufacturing in Brunswick Heads.\n\nCo-CEO Mr. Mireau also joined Business Australiaâs exclusive 10-month CEO Masterclass through the Entrepreneur Program, combining peer learning with ASX level leadership coaches to ensure effective and authentic leadership for Clearlight in the next chapter ahead.\n\nClearlight are very proud to be selected for this programme and grateful for the continuous advancement through the various support received.\n\nThe journey continues for Clearlight Saunas International to achieve their bold aspirations as they progress to manufacture locally in Australia and expand their wellness technology offerings to the global market.\n\nâ\n\nInnovation of Clearlight Saunas in partnership with Business Australia\n\nSaunas heat up through innovation\n\nSauna retailer levels up as innovator and manufacturer in regional Brunswick Heads, implementing a broad range of recommendations in their bespoke Growth Roadmap and making the most of free services through the Entrepreneurs Programme.\n\nBold aspirations\n\nClearlight Saunas Pty Ltd is the leading APAC reseller of Clearlight infrared cabin saunas. The company identified a growth opportunity and developed IP for a portable IR sauna, The Dome, to add to their range. They came into EP with the aspiration to commercialize The Dome and set up manufacturing facilities to produce locally.\n\nHowever, these plans needed to be more embedded in the team to ensure strategic alignment, and the business required urgent advice on manufacturing technology to progress the commercialization plan. The team took the tailored recommendations onboard and embarked on strategic work through a series of Business Design workshops. They immediately developed production forecasts and engaged the EPâs Technology adviser to map out a tiered plan for automated manufacturing.\n\nLeading to excel\n\nEager to make the most of the free mentoring, they engaged their Growth Facilitator in some company think-tanks. It was highlighted that culture is one of the strongest determining factors behind successful high-growth companies, so Clearlight used a sophisticated EP tool, âClimate for Growthâ, to assess their leadership and culture. CEO Sebastian Mireau also decided to join a 10-month free CEO Masterclass series dedicated to leadership.\n\nTheir first step was to engage Growth facilitator Maria Collyer to develop a Growth Roadmap. The process uncovered bold aspirations to become world leaders in the wellness industry, with sophisticated strategic plans in place.\n\n\"We at Clearlight are thrilled about the opportunity to learn from world-class coaches and share with thriving fellow CEOs, as it will strengthen our company in many ways.â\n\nâ Sebastian Mireau\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ"
