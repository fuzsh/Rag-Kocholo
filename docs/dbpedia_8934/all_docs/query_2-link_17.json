        "text": "Jacuzzi Clearlight Licensing Agreement Details\n\nJacuzzi did not purchase Clearlight saunas. Jacuzzi wanted to expand its product offerings to include infrared saunas and in May 2017, they agreed to form a partnership with Clearlight. Jacuzzi selected Clearlight after conducting over 2 years of due diligence. We explain the decisions and details behind the partnership to help you make a good purchase decision.\n\nWhat Does this Jacuzzi Clearlight Partnership mean for Us?\n\nTheir decision should give you a great deal of confidence in choosing this brand for your own home. We have a full Jacuzzi® Clearlight infrared sauna review based on research starting in 2012. The purchase did not change the clearlight sauna price. We have rated this brand as a top choice since 2014 and are encouraged to see a company with the standards of Jacuzzi to choose them as a partner.\n\nIt was this reputation for extreme quality that prompted the hot tub manufacturer to consider this company, which was the first to pioneer the blending of ceramic and carbon heater. This resulted in a heater able to deliver a more penetrating wavelength and a deeper healing, detoxification and warmth. All of this was available to the user at the lowest EMFs, or electromagnetic fields, available at the time. It continues to lead with near zero EMF heaters.\n\nJacuzzi pioneered the hydrotherapy industry and is still the leader in hot tubs. It also manufactures walk in showers, pool equipment and everything needed to create your own bathtub and in home spa retreat. Its hot tubs use what they refer to as hydromassage for competitive athletes and the everyday weekend warrior athlete. Warm water has long been known to help the body and mind to relax and promote internal health and healing. It can relieve stress, lower back pain, muscle cramps and sleeplessness.\n\nClearlight Infrared and Jacuzzi Inc. today announced an exclusive licensing partnership for infrared saunas. Clearlight Infrared will manufacture and market a premium line of infrared saunas under the Jacuzzi ® brand.\n\n“We are pleased to be working with such a great company,” said Dr. Raleigh Duncan, founder of Clearlight Infrared. “Infrared therapy is a natural fit to help people live more vibrant, productive and balanced lives.”\n\nThe Importance of Greater Health and Wellness\n\nInfrared saunas are effective at improving one’s overall health and wellness by helping to boost the immune system, aiding with detoxification, improving sleep, reducing stress, increasing metabolism, and improving heart health among other health and wellness benefits.\n\nDesign, Quality, and Effectiveness. From trend-setting design, exceptional furniture grade sauna cabins and state-of-the-art infrared heater technology, Jacuzzi® saunas deliver the ultimate infrared therapy experience. Clearlight infrared and Jacuzzi Inc. Partnership\n\nAs the above article clarified, there was no purchase. It was a licensing agreement reached after months of discussions. The same quality that has been the backbone of this top rated brand’s Premier and Sanctuary models is the same that is still being designed into them today. The effectiveness of the True Wave II heaters and the long standing commitment to the highest quality was behind the decision as shared here:\n\n“The partnership with Clearlight Infrared fits well with our company’s focus on well-being, and commitment to improving the lives of our customers,” states Jacuzzi Group Worldwide CEO Bob Rowan.\n\nJacuzzi Brands LLC, d/b/a/ Jacuzzi Group Worldwide, through its subsidiaries is a global manufacturer and distributor of high quality and innovative branded bath, plumbing and backyard products for the residential, commercial and institutional markets.\n\nJacuzzi® product offerings include outdoor hot tubs, bathtubs, showers, sanitary ware, fixtures, aftermarket products and accessories.\n\nEach Clearlight Infrared Sauna™ model is manufactured with the finest Grade-A Clear Western Red Canadian Cedar or hypo-allergenic Basswood. Moreover, they are the only infrared sauna in the world to offer a full lifetime warranty for home use. Clearlight Infrared and Jacuzzi Inc. Form a Licensing Partnership for Jacuzzi® Infrared Saunas\n\nBoth of these companies individually have received numerous awards over the years. As CEO Bob Rowan has expressed, their company has as its focus the well-being and improvement of their customers’ lives. Their brand is known for the highest level of quality. One such example is their winning of the following spa of the year award:\n\nAs part of the Equip’Hotel show that will take place in Paris from 16th to 20th November , the Equip’Innov awards – which aim to reward the most innovative products amont the suppliers of hotels and restaurants – have just been unveiled.\n\nAt a ceremony held in Paris on Thursday 30th October, a jury of 16 professionals has selected the best products among 8 categories involved in the competition. Out of 68 shortlisted products (more than 200 products considered) Jacuzzi® won the “spa” award with its professional spa Enjoy, a 6-seater hot tub dedicated to professional use. Jacuzzi® awarded by the hotel industry!\n\nAt Healing Heat Therapy, we are fortunate enough to be able to talk with the owners of several industry leaders on a regular basis. This access keeps us informed as to the details of agreements such as this, as well as model changes and improvements. We have seen this brand add some great additions to its lines as well as adding new features although this has not greatly affected the clearlight sauna price.\n\nProducts and Models Added After Partnership\n\nOutdoor Sanctuary 5\n\nOne very interesting addition has been the 5 person outdoor Sanctuary 5 model that can be controlled from indoors via a smart phone or tablet app. We anticipate even more additions during the rest of 2018 and into 2019. (2024 update: they have continued the same quality standards and have added new products and made some improvements to others).\n\nClearlight® HALO ONE® Halotherapy\n\nAnother interesting new product is the HALO ONE® Halotherapy. The first version diffused salt particles into the air. The current second generation HALO ONE® uses a liquid saline solution of micronized salt particles that it then diffuses into the air.\n\nimages courtesy of:\n\ninfraredsauna.com\n\njacuzzi.com"
