        "text": "The sauna company I get asked the most about (outside of Clearlight) is Radiant Health Saunas. For the record, I think Radiant is a great company and they’re making a safe sauna. They’re also the closest apples to apples comparison to Clearlight’s Premier Saunas so I always invite the conversation to help people make an informed decision. To be totally transparent and fair though, there are a few important, notable differences and I highlighted them below for you:\n\nClearlight Saunas & Radiant Health Saunas – here are the differences:\n\n1) Clearlight created a hybrid carbon-ceramic heater offering the best of both worlds of carbon and ceramic infrared. Clearlight infuses high quality carbon heaters with 100’s of 1000’s of ceramic particulates to create a high performance infrared heater unrivaled in the sauna industry. Radiant Health uses carbon only, which can often feel less hot/intense.\n\n2) A leader in innovation, Clearlight pioneered the industry as the first company to remove the EMF (electro-magnetic fields) exposure in infrared saunas. They were also the first sauna company to have 3rd party laboratory testing verifying the low EMF levels. So many companies/websites market the importance of low EMF, but don’t actually share their testing results. Their site states “Radiant Health Saunas are independently tested by a government certified lab and the entire sauna is shown to have zero VOC’s” – but I have yet to find the report on their site – so where is the proof?? In my experience, if a company makes a claim, but won’t back it up with the facts, is it really true? I know their levels are much lower than many others on the market, but it raises a red flag when they don’t support it in writing.\n\n3) Clearlight is the only infrared sauna company to shield ELF (extremely low electrical frequencies), a kind of energy pollution that radiates from electrical wiring. Radiant Health does not shield ELF.\n\n4) Sanctuary saunas include 2 vertical 500-watt Full Spectrum heaters emitting all 3 wavelengths of infrared heat – near, mid and far infrared. Premier models also have the option of adding a Full Spectrum heater as a door accessory. Radiant Health does not offer Full Spectrum, they are far infrared heat only.\n\n5) Radiant Health heaters extend above the head. Clearlight CEO and my personal friend, Dr. Raleigh Duncan, not only has an engineering background, he’s also a Chiropractor. In designing Clearlight saunas he consulted with health practitioners of different paths for their wisdom and suggestions. His research included consulting with Ayurvedic practitioners and Doctors of Oriental Medicine where he learned that the heaters should, ideally, not be placed at the level of the head. In addition, infrared heat travels in a direct, straight line and is designed to elevate your core body temp, so that you sweat from the inside out. They’re not to be wasted on empty airspace. Overall, heaters above the head are typically wasting energy and an indication of a weaker heating system.\n\n6) All Clearlight saunas are equipped with Chromotherapy lighting and a Bluetooth sound system with Nakamichi speakers. This is so you can enjoy your music, guided meditations, podcasts or Audible books while in the sauna. Radiant Health saunas come with an old-school car CD/AM/FM player.\n\n7) The Radiant Health is made with Canadian Hemlock. Clearlight saunas are your choice of Okoume Mahogany or North American Basswood. All woods are FSC Certified and sustainably-harvested – no particleboard or veneer are used.\n\n8) The sauna cabin sizes are quite different. For example: a Premier IS-2 is 50Wx44Dx76H compared to Radiant’s E-2H at 48Wx40Dx77H. A few inches may not seem like a lot, but if you’ve ever flown on an airplane, you know that 4 extra inches of legroom can feel quite significant.\n\n9) The warranty on a sauna is very important. Radiant Health’s website states, “Lifetime warranty on heaters and wood, 5 year warranty on electrical components”. Clearlight saunas include a 100% Lifetime Warranty for the entire sauna and all its components for the life of the original owner. They offer this in writing and have been in the sauna business for nearly 3 decades – one of the earliest companies in the industry. They feel that protecting your investment with a solid warranty is important and valuable – and a lifetime speaks volumes.\n\n10) Overall, my focus and goal is always centered around quality, integrity and the best interest of my community. I strive to provide superior customer service, help you make an informed decision about what best fits you/family and never be pushy or aggressive with sales.\n\nClearlight is based in the US (Northern California) and proud to be trusted by a roster of health/wellness experts, organizations, medical facilities, and professional athletes around the world.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this! And again, full disclosure, I’m a fan of Radiant Health Saunas – I just think Clearlight is better. Reach out anytime for clarity/questions, I’m happy to help."
