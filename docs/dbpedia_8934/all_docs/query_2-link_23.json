Clearlight Premier Saunas include Standard Chromotherapy with 15 LED Lights. Clearlight Sanctuary Saunas include Medical Grade Chromotherapy lighting with 96 LED Lights.\n\nHow long does it take to assemble the sauna?\n\nIt takes 1 – 3 hours depending on which sauna model you have. The heaters are already attached to the walls, so you just need to slot the walls, floor and roof parts into place. The sauna is pre-wired so you will need to connect some cables and then it’s ready to plug into a standard plug socket. You can download the assembly and user manual here.\n\nWhat tools are needed?\n\nFor our Essential and Premier ranges you’ll need a screwdriver to attached the doorknob, but that’s it! For the Sanctuary saunas, you’ll need an Allen key, which we provide.\n\nHow much electricity does it use?\n\nMost people will have a sauna session for between 30 – 60 minutes which costs on average 70p per sauna session. These saunas are energy efficient to run.\n\nHow heavy is it?\n\nThe sauna weighs 290kg.\n\nHow safe are the saunas?\n\nInfrared is very safe, it is used to keep newborn babies warm in hospital. The Clearlight saunas have been tested for low EMF and ELF so are very safe to use.\n\nWhats the difference between the Premiere and Sanctuary Range?\n\nThe Clearlight Sanctuary is a luxury sauna which uses Full Spectrum Infrared (Near, Mid and Far), Canadian Cedarwood and Medical Grade Chromotherapy. The Clearlight Premier ranges uses Far Infrared heater technology, grade 'A' Cedarwood and standard Chromotherapy with 15 LED Lights.\n\nWhat are the benefits of Near, Mid and Far Infrared light therapy?\n\nFar Infrared waves produce detoxification benefits because of the resonant frequency they have with the water molecules in our bodies. Near and mid infrared waves are linked with skin rejuvenation and muscle relaxation, and they are able to penetrate more deeply and raise core body temperature more quickly.\n\nClearlight Far Infrared heaters produce long wavelengths at around 10 microns. The human body emits on average, infrared at around 9 - 11 microns. When the wavelength comes in at 9 - 10 microns, it’s a 'resonant frequency,' which means it’s the same frequency as our bodies. This is due to the fact that our body is mainly water (70%) and the resonance frequency of water is at 9.4 microns. It feels familiar to the body, and is more readily absorbed, which is why it’s known as a ‘healing wavelength.’ With combining carbon and ceramic you get the best out of both materials: perfect resonance wavelengths with a high intensity.\n\nClearlight Full Spectrum saunas offer the full spectrum of infrared therapy, so you can experience the health benefits of Near, Mid and Far infrared therapy. These saunas use two variably controlled front Full Spectrum heaters that are 500 watts each. By doing this, you experience exceptional infrared heat to the front of your body in the intensity you choose. The share of our full spectrum heaters is 1/3 near infrared heat, 1/3 mid infrared heat and 1/3 far infrared heat. Near infrared waves are particularly good for skin, wound healing and immune function; Mid infrared waves are linked with muscle relaxation and increased circulation. The addition of the Near and Mid infrared waves with Far Infrared boosts the speed and effectiveness of the infrared therapy by about 15-20%.\n\nWhat is the current lead time for Clearlight Saunas?"
