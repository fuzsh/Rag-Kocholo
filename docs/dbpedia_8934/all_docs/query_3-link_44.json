        "text": "Originally Posted by\n\nThe first recording of this song is normally credited to the Shelton Brothers in the early 1930s. They started as the Attlesey Brothers, and recorded \"Deep Elm Blues\" under the name \"Lone Star Cowboys\" in 1933. They then changed their name to the Shelton Brothers (after their mother's maiden name) and recorded several further versions under the title \"Deep Elem Blues.\" It was subsequently covered by a variety of other artists, including the Prairie Ramblers in 1935, Jerry Lee Lewis in the 1950s, and Frank Wakefield in the early 1960s. I'm not sure whose version Jerry Garcia learnt the song from.\n\nThe title \"Deep Elem\" originates from Elm Street, which was the red-light district in Dallas. The song is known variously as \"Deep Elm Blues\", \"Deep Elem Blues\" and \"Deep Ellum\" blues.\n\nSeveral early blues luminaries spent time in and around Deep Ellum. Blind Lemon Jefferson moved there as a street musician around 1917, and met and played with Leadbelly there. Lightning Hopkins also played with Blind Lemon there. But it doesn't seem that any of them had a hand in writing this song (even though Blind Lemon Jefferson is sometimes cited as the author)."
