There’s a heated dialogue between two coworkers that’s all ADR. The shot actually seems to be an outtake where neither is talking and one of actors is mostly out of frame.\n\n2. In the midst of a flirtatious back-and-forth we cut to another scene—with the same two characters—in a different location. That moment plays with the sound from the first shot overlapping. Oh, also, the cutaway seems to be another outtake.\n\nAmazing.\n\nShe was my wife, Brooke. She died of cancer.\n\nThis movie is completely insane. Not an ounce of it makes any sense at all and the leads have 0 chemistry. But it also has everything you could ever want: single dads, ghost reveals, 2 narrators, misused Shakespeare quotes, and a script trying to force emotion on you so hard it starts to get uncomfortable.\n\nBut you’ll laugh. Oh how you’ll laugh.\n\nthis movie is my favorite christmas movie. the laughter this masterpiece brings. not a single element of this film is done correctly and it is the funniest most entertaining christmas movie. i show it to all my friends and my family watches it every christmas. if you’re in need of laughter and confusion at how something like this exists so freely, christmas at the chateau is the movie for you. absolute favorite film of mine."
