        "text": "An inmate toughs out a lap around the yard, which, eight times a year, is converted into a 5K, 10K, and/or half marathon course on which convicts race outsiders.\n\nIN 1866, WHEN THE FIRST INMATES ARRIVED, the Oregon State Penitentiary did not have a wall. It was a tricky situation, operating a prison that was still under construction, so the warden outfitted each of his new charges in an iron ankle shackle. This unforgiving device, which weighed as much as 28 pounds, quickly became known as the “Oregon Boot.” Anyone who tried to run in the Oregon Boot wasn’t going anywhere very quickly. Even after the 14-foot-high wall went up, the warden felt safer with the entire population of the OSP dragging one of their legs around. Soon, the inmates began to suffer the kind of permanent agony we associate with the medieval ages. Iron wore holes through their actual boots and into their ankles. Ex-cons were marked by lifelong limps.\n\nIn 1878, the governor finally addressed this barbarism, declaring that the boot should be saved for situations involving discipline or transportation. It eventually became a relic of a simpler, crueler time.\n\nBy the summer of 2014, when I began running races at the penitentiary, not only had the boot been out of use for close to 75 years, inmates could buy running shoes at the commissary. Over the years, running had become one of the most sought-after privileges for the men inside. The wall, incidentally, was now 26 feet high.\n\n“I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THOSE SHORTS,” the correctional officer says. “They’re supposed to go to the knee.”\n\n“They do go to the knee—” I say, tugging at my waistband until it’s riding precariously low, “—to the top of the knee. Look, I wore these last time and nobody said anything.”\n\n“Be that as it may,” she says, “do they go any lower?”\n\nWhile the other outsiders slip off their shoes and pad toward the metal detector, I have to monkey around with my clothes. I’m reminded of the first few times I went clubbing, when it seemed that the only thing separating me from all of life’s mysteries was a long once-over from a bouncer. Maximum security, of course, is not the kind of club you typically argue your way into. Among others, the Happy Face Killer lives here, the latest in a long and storied history of serial killers to wind up in the OSP. Most of the people waiting for us have been convicted of violent, person-on-person crime; the dress code is ostensibly for our own protection. The message is, show too much skin and there’s no telling what could happen. So I pull my shorts down an eighth of an inch, and another, until she finally nods.\n\nOtherwise, the rituals are the same as on my previous visit: the “you may be taken hostage” speech, the stamp of invisible ink, the gates opening and closing. I’m half-expecting to feel eyes on me, on my apparently too-bare legs, but the main area is nearly empty this early in the morning, and before I know it we’ve passed the cell blocks, and the nurse’s station, and all the other passageways shooting off like commuter lines from Grand Central Station, and we’re back outside, heading for the yard.\n\nThe Oregon State Penitentiary over time: The Oregon Boot (below) restrained prisoners even after a wall (second image below) was erected around 1866; the yard as it is today (above).\n\nA row of pay phones—never operational during any of the races—stretches off to our right. Just beyond, two well-groomed baseball diamonds are wedged inside a quarter-mile track. Despite the expanse of grass, and a surprising number of flowers, there’s an overwhelming sense of gray. My eyes hit concrete in every direction, with the occasional flourish of razor wire.\n\nOut on the asphalt track, the runners are warming up in sweatshirts and jeans. Even with our mandatory extra layer—an orange vest, to make it easier for the guards to pick us out from the blue-clad inmates—we’re shivering and momentarily underdressed. The sun hasn’t quite cleared the top of the wall, and in its long shadows, the place feels as cavernous as a football stadium.\n\nAs soon as the gate closes behind us, a small group of inmates approaches, holding out safety pins. There’s a shortage of them, they explain, and they want to make sure our race numbers won’t be flapping around for 13.1 miles. “This is Gary,” I tell the group of guys. “My boss. Watch out.”\n\n“Morning,” Gary says.\n\nGary Geist owns the brewpub where I bartend in Portland. Even though he’s nearly 50 years old, he has a 2:29 marathon to his name and is going to run circles around everyone today except for Jeff, the fastest inmate. [For privacy and at the request of many inmates, we’ve used only their first names and, in some cases, pseudonyms. Out of consideration for their victims, we’ve elected not to include any details of person-on-person crimes.] Gary’s never been inside a prison before. It’s not hard to imagine what he’s thinking: I was the newbie last time, and my friends Rebecca and Hopi were the veterans introducing me to the crew. But as soon as I saw how respectfully the inmates treated women, my anxieties were quelled.\n\nOne of the guys pulls me aside. “I’m glad you came back,” he says, then confides that he woke up in tears before realizing that today was race day. We’re the only visitors he gets.\n\nWe shake hands and pat each other on the shoulder, but to be honest, I feel a little weird about it. A few nights ago I looked up his record. I’m not sure what came over me, but all of a sudden I wanted to learn what everyone had done. I stopped myself before it got very far. I wonder if he thinks I now know. “It’s good to see you,” I say.\n\nI’m keeping an eye out for Scott, the inmate I’m hoping to keep up with today. I don’t see him among those already warming up on the track. He’s not among those stretching on the infield, and even though there’s a handful of inmates warming up and a crew setting up the water station and PA system at the other end of the track, they’re all too big to be him. Scott must be in the barn. The speakers crackle to life and we’re swept up in the easy shuffle of Wilco’s “Jesus, Etc.” All around me, people are discussing pace groups, how hot it’s going to get, whether too much was eaten at breakfast or not enough. It doesn’t sound any different than the anxious pre-race chatter you’d hear at any road race. My first time inside, I didn’t even notice the guards with their guns up on the wall until it was time to leave.\n\n“Tall buildings shake, voices escape singing sad, sad songs—”\n\n“Twenty minutes!” the inmate doing the announcing says. “Twenty minutes till the second annual High Wall Half Marathon!”\n\nAS EVERY RUNNER KNOWS, this sport has a way of shaping one’s identity. The self-discipline involved in getting out there can be applied to pretty much everything you do. For many of the inmates, particularly those who have been derailed by addiction, running offers a fundamentally different blueprint for how to live.\n\nLocated an hour south of Portland in the capital city of Salem, the OSP is male-only, but both women and men from the outside are welcome to compete against inmates in the monthly race series, which runs one day a month, a Friday or Saturday, from March to October—seven 5Ks and 10Ks (run concurrently) and one half marathon. Out of 2,000 inmates, 130 are part of the running club. More than four decades old, organized and funded by inmates, the program’s very existence suggests that prison can be rehabilitative. Eighteen months of good behavior are required to join the club, and it can take years for space to open up to those on the waiting list. In addition to the race series, club members are eligible for “running turnout,” which allows for daily access to the yard for the sole purpose of training, a vastly preferable alternative to “main yardlines,” when nonrunning inmates clog up the track.\n\n“Were you already runners?” I asked a pair of inmates named Todd and James when I visited the prison on a nonrace day. I was hoping to learn a little bit more about their lives. “Like when you were…younger?” I sputtered. It was hard not to feel like I was asking them how long they’d been inside.\n\n“I ran,” James said, “but I wouldn’t have called myself a runner.”\n\n“It’s terrible sedentary in here,” Todd said. “I’d be 285 pounds without daily exercise. I’d get fat drinking water.”\n\nHow the feature appeared in the June 2015 issue.\n\nIt makes all the difference, they told me, to be able to set goals, to have races to train for. They’re a few years older than I am: late 30s, early 40s, but due to their crimes, they no longer have relationships with their families. Barring bad behavior—or worse luck—the two of them will be living together until Todd gets out in 2028. And then James will have four more years without his closest friend. “We’re running marathons in here,” he said, “not 5Ks.”\n\nThey are, as he put it, part of the “one bad day” club. The implication being that they had been leading respectable lives and loving their families and most of the time remembered to vote and recycle until one bad day they just snapped. I imagined bar fights gone ugly, DUIs, a made-for-TV medley of drug-induced stupidity.\n\n“When I run,” James said, “I don’t see the walls. There’s a tremendous amount of realization that life has to go on. It can get pretty rough and dark in here. But we’re not just going to be here.”\n\n“That’s why race day is so important,” Todd said. “Bringing outsiders in here. It’s a chance to show that we’re normal. A chance to feel normal. Ninety-three percent of us are coming back to your communities. We’ll be running alongside you, just not wearing blue.”\n\nHOW IN THE WORLD DID WE GET HERE? From the Oregon Boot to prison-sanctioned half marathons?\n\nAs is so often the case with distance running, the story begins with Steve Prefontaine. When the legendary Oregon runner died in 1975, among those devastated by the news were inmates at the OSP. But they weren’t just Pre’s fans; the former American record holder had been coaching them for several years. “I’m going for a run by myself today,” he would tell his teammates, then drive an hour north up I-5 to visit his other family in Salem. Pre may have cultivated an outlaw persona on the track, but he apparently kept his relationship with actual outlaws under wraps.\n\nIn 1997, inmates raised funds for a mounting stone and penned the words on the iconic headstone which, ever since, has marked the curve on Skyline Boulevard in Eugene where he died. Imagine if Johnny Cash, as well as performing in Folsom Prison, had also taught several songwriting workshops and kept the whole thing secret for years, before passing away in a tragic accident, and you’ll begin to understand how profound the connection is between the running club and Pre.\n\nSteve Bence, one of Pre’s teammates at the University of Oregon, believes that Pre’s hardscrabble background was the driving force behind his relationship with the OSP. “Growing up,” Bence told me, “he knew he had a choice: running and college, or a path that would have led to trouble. I think he knew that it could well have been him in there.”\n\n“He was taking a sociology class,” former roommate Pat Tyson told me, “and the professor took them to the prison on a field trip. And he just kept going back.”\n\nMary Marckx Creel, Pre’s girlfriend back in college, added, “It was the gospel to him, that running could save you. By spreading it to prisoners, he was showing that they could be redeemed.”\n\n“It wasn’t just Pre,” Ben Andrews, another former Oregon Duck, said over coffee. “You know who also went in? Dellinger. Bill’s a very stoic, life-of-the-party guy. A contradiction, I know—but he is. And so it’s hard to know what’s going on deep inside him.”\n\nBill Dellinger has the distinction of being one of the last American men to medal in the 5,000 meters in the Olympics, winning bronze 51 years ago in Tokyo. (His teammate Bob Schul won gold, finishing exactly one second ahead.) Despite his accomplishments on and off the track—Dellinger is unquestionably one of the all-time great coaches in the sport, having trained everyone from Prefontaine to Alberto Salazar to Mary Slaney—he isn’t quite a household name.\n\nFor several decades, Dellinger quietly fanned the flames under Pre’s legacy at the OSP, bringing U of O runners up to Salem to conduct clinics and run races at the penitentiary.\n\n“There was an inmate who would write to him for advice,” Art Boileau, the two-time Olympic marathoner, told me. “And Coach Dellinger would write up workouts for the guy. There was no fanfare, nobody knew anything about it. And then one day at practice he told us we were going running in Salem. And eventually I realized we’re going to the state pen. But I would do anything for Coach Dellinger. It was an amazing experience. I felt so appreciated.”\n\nDellinger’s tenure at the University of Oregon, which lasted for more than three decades, ended in the late ‘90s. Ben Andrews was on his final team. “I was sitting in Coach Dellinger’s house one day,” Andrews told me. “We were talking about the good old days, and I told him I’d gone inside and run with the prisoners. He popped up and said, ‘What do you mean?’ And I said, ‘I went inside. I went running with those guys.’ And he gave me a hug. He’s not a real huggy guy. And he said, ‘I’m so proud of you. That is the biggest thing you can do for people in their lives. Love on them when they’re not loved.’“\n\n“RUNNERS! FIFTEEN MINUTES!” I suppose I shouldn’t be surprised that only four outsiders have shown up today. How many people are able to take a Friday off work to run a half marathon in a prison? How many would want to, especially on a day that’s supposed to hit 90? I ask inmate Todd, who works as the Running Program Coordinator, how today’s turnout compares to last year.\n\n“There’s about twice as many inmates running,” he says.\n\n“And outsiders?”\n\n“Actually, there weren’t any.”\n\nA crowd has gathered at a sign where lap splits for every finishing time from 1:30 up to two hours have been posted. Mickey, a shirtless, tan, youthful 51-year-old, asks Gary and me how fast we’re planning on going. When I tell him I’d be happy with 1:35, which translates to 3:05 per lap, he fights off a frown. “Well,” he says, “I might be able to keep up with you for a while.”\n\n“I’m going out easy,” I assure him.\n\n“What about you?” he asks Gary, making the mistake of judging my boss by the lines on his face.\n\nGary confesses that his likely finishing time is, in fact, “off the charts”—somewhere in the 1:20s.\n\n“You’ll be right there with Jeff,” Mickey whistles.\n\n“Is Jeff still hurt?” I ask.\n\n“Does he look hurt?”\n\nWe all turn and face the infield. As usual, Jeff is on his own, on the grass, stretching. He pulls out his earbuds as we approach. (Inmates are able to purchase prison-approved MP3 players.) Like Mickey, he is already shirtless. On a potential scorcher like today, stuck in my two layers (the orange vest would be too risque to wear on its own), I’m a little envious…until I remember that this clothing is my ticket out.\n\nJeff enjoys a 10K victory; an inmate (right) celebrates his final race before release.\n\nJeff gets to his feet. The fastest inmate is bigger than I remember. He must be six-five, six-six.\n\n“I don’t know why exactly,” he says, “but I’m feeling better.” He tests his Achilles tendon, which is when I notice that his shoes look more like cross-trainers than running shoes. Could be the reason behind his injury, but I bite my tongue. Jeff makes more than a hundred dollars a month doing laundry, which is actually one of the best-paying jobs available. But he can’t just zip by the shoe store on the way home from work. “Last week I ran a 1:26 in practice,” he says.\n\nI go looking for my own rival. The “recreation building,” the large structure in the middle of the yard, is divided into three sections. It is the least charming “barn,” as inmates call it, I’ve ever been inside. Although it houses an indoor basketball court and a giant bathroom, the front room isn’t particularly athletic-feeling. Picture a cafeteria, except instead of food, runners’ sweats are folded neatly on top of nearly every table. I notice a guy pinning a photo of his family to his shorts. I pick up my bib and give my name to the guys who are in charge of the results. Below every race number is the running club’s motto: “Run for Your Life.”\n\nI finally spot Scott, whose jeans and hoodie threaten to swallow him whole. He’s alone at a table along the far wall, looking over a printout of his splits from last year. While watching him win the 10K last month, I noticed a particular lightfootedness that I figured could only come from a background in cross country. Turns out he ran at Beaverton High School. Right now he looks extraordinarily focused. “Michael,” he says. “Ready for this?”\n\n“I don’t know about this heat. But I think I can PR.”\n\n“Oh yeah?” he says.\n\nI’m a little embarrassed to admit that I have only a single half marathon under my belt, an unofficial route out on the coast this past April. Just me and five friends, and more than 1,000 feet of elevation gain. Anything under 1:35 today, and I’ll be proud of myself.\n\n“After last time,” he says, “I realized I’d read your story about the group in Arizona trying to make the Olympics.”\n\n“So you get Runner’s World in here,” I say. “That’s wild.”\n\n“The guy in the cell next to mine has a subscription. What are you writing about next?”\n\nWhat am I writing about next? I rack my brain, trying to recall our conversation from my first visit. Obviously I mentioned the magazine, but did I not explain what was happening here? Did he just think I was here for the race?\n\nNot that I hadn’t felt at ease with other inmates, but my first time inside, with Scott, a lot of personal stuff had just seemed to naturally come up. He’s got this sort of gentle easiness about him. But now, he’s probably playing back everything he already shared with me: the six kids, the wife who visits daily, the 6,000 miles he’s run, the 8,000 on the elliptical, the 7,000 on the exercise bike. (“If you add it all up,” he said about the distance he’s covered since getting locked up in 2007, “I’ve nearly gone around the world in here.”) The last thing I want to do is blindside him. “So yeah,” I say. “I was hoping to write about you…all of this.”\n\n“Oh!”\n\n“Sorry that wasn’t clear.”\n\n“I thought you were just here for the race,” Scott says.\n\n“I mean, I’m here for that, too,” I reply. “I want to run well.”\n\nOutside the announcer gives the 10-minute warning. Scott pulls off his sweatshirt. “3:05s,” he says.\n\n“What?”\n\n“That’s the split. For your PR.”\n\nI can’t tell if he’s pleased or upset. It’s difficult, trying to get to know someone who doesn’t have a phone number or email address. After the first race, I briefly considered writing a letter but discovered a real reluctance in giving up my address, opening myself up to who knows how many years of correspondence. And then there’s the whole question of why he’s here, and whether or not the answer will change everything I think about him.\n\nSO WHY EVEN ASK THE QUESTION? You are either someone who believes that people—even those who have committed grievous acts of violence—can recover… or you aren’t. Regardless, it’s worth considering the case of Kelley Slayton.\n\nFor former inmate Kelley Slayton, running changed everything.\n\nLocked up at 24, Kelley didn’t get sober until six years into his 14-year sentence. “My dad was a big influence,” he told me recently, when we went running along the Willamette River. “He won the masters division of the Portland Marathon when I was 19. At the time, I would run races with him after getting loaded the night before, but I didn’t see myself as a runner. Once I was inside, I eventually realized that running was a way of bringing us closer.”\n\nI asked him what the relationship was between his running and his sobriety.\n\n“With those races in there,” Kelley said, “I hated losing. I could tell right away that drinking wasn’t doing me any good in life. My last drink was out of a mop bucket.”\n\nKelley lives with the kind of full-hearted joy that comes from beating the odds. Known as “Rock” to the men on the inside, the former middleweight boxing champ of the prison would look tough if his smile weren’t constantly shoving the hardness aside. It’s difficult to believe this is the same man who, at his sentencing, was called a “monster” by the judge, who went on to say that he wished he could put Kelley away forever.\n\nWith violent crime, forgiveness and understanding—especially from victims—is almost always out of the question. When confronted with the facts of their past, most people, no matter how open-minded they might regard themselves, will retreat emotionally. The marks of incarceration might be less obvious than those left by the Oregon Boot 150 years ago, but they can be just as permanent.\n\nNow 47, Kelley was released in 2006, having completed his first marathon on the unforgiving blacktop of the OSP. Since then, he’s run Boston and NYC, with a lifetime best of 2:50. More important, despite his background, he’s also managed to find a meaningful career. After struggling for years to find work, he spent time as a custodian at the Portland Timbers’ soccer stadium and eventually landed his dream job as a residential counselor at a rehab facility. “Every day I get to help people,” he told me, incredulous at his good fortune.\n\nKelley is unique among former inmates in that he actually goes back into the prison and races the people he used to live with. Undefeated for the final five years of his sentence, it’s still a source of pride for him to finish first.\n\nKelley Slayton looks back on his 14 years inside.\n\n“What it’s like, going back?”\n\n“The first time I went in,” Kelley continued, “it was weird, because when I came through the door, a correctional officer asked me what I was doing. And I was like, ‘I’m here for the race.’ I had some runners with me—I’d brought like four people—and he was like, ‘What are you really doing here?’ Like I had some ulterior motive. There are people who smuggle drugs. I had no intention of doing something stupid like that.”\n\n“But he was looking at you the same old way,” I said.\n\n“I don’t blame him. He doesn’t know my motives. He doesn’t know that I’ve changed my life.”\n\nTHE LOOP AROUND THE YARD IS 2,250 FEET LONG, not quite half a mile. Thirty-one loops adds up to a half marathon, meaning that we’ll get thirty water stops—making this perhaps the best-supported half marathon in the country. On top of that, energy gels are making the rounds. Everyone else seems to be carrying theirs, but I stash my double espresso at the foot of the water station and figure if it’s not there in an hour, oh well. The inmates paid for it, and considering how little they make, I can’t really complain.\n\n“Runners on your marks—”\n\nThirty-seven of us toe the line. The rest of the running club is either manning the water station (three giant coolers of Gatorade, lemonade, and water), serving as our lap counters, or simply cheering us on for the next couple hours. “Get set—” says the announcer.\n\nThere is, of course, no gun.\n\nJeff and Gary zip off. I settle into a pack with Scott and Mickey and a guy named Trapper. As a special bonus for going 13.1, or perhaps simply an effort to keep the boredom at bay, the guards have opened up an extra part of the yard under the wall, where we continue off the track onto a well-trod dirt path. The faded tangle of green and white next to the path eventually reveals itself to be a miniature golf course. After a couple 90-degree turns, we zip past the horseshoe pit and back onto the track. This extra bit is far and away my favorite part of the loop. It’s a break from the blacktop and the only time I have the chance to feel nimble and light on my feet like I do on the trails back home in Forest Park. It’s also stupidly entertaining to imagine the golf course and horseshoes in use.\n\nThe most interesting other respite is the “swamp,” a squishy strip of overwatered grass we cross every time we leave the track and start heading around the barn. Otherwise we just keep putting the same blacktop behind us, and even with the music playing, it feels pretty empty out here, and increasingly hot, especially behind the barn. The guards, of course, do not clap or ring cow bells. Every time we round the back corner of the barn and reach the shade under the wall, the announcer’s play-by-play is once again audible and there’s a tangible lift in energy. “Six down for Gary Geist!” we hear him say. Which means Gary’s already got a half lap on us. And Jeff’s got even more than that. Before long they’ll come speeding past us.\n\nMickey tells me that the quick turns around the horseshoes are throwing him off. “I’m used to running in straight lines,” he says. “My muscles don’t know what to do with turns like these.”\n\nIN 2003, OUTSIDE MAGAZINE PROFILED JONATHAN GILL. At the time, Gill, 34, was an inmate at a minimum security facility run by the Oregon Department of Corrections. He made waves by announcing that he was training for the 2004 Olympic Trials, where his goal was to qualify for the Athens-bound team in the 1,500 meters. Even though it made for a good story, almost nobody gave him a chance, except for his coach, Dick Brown.\n\nThe former head of Athletics West, Brown had already guided 13 athletes to the Olympics and world championships. Brown had also taken over Dellinger’s role at the penitentiary after Dellinger’s stroke in 2000. The towering, soft-spoken Brown had been at the forefront of recovery research for decades, and many of his findings influenced other coaches, including one of the sport’s most successful coaches, Alberto Salazar.\n\nBrown was forced to stop going to the prison in 2010, after being diagnosed with cancer. When I visited him at his home in Eugene, I found it strangely comforting to chat about the men we both knew in the running club. I was curious to find out what happened to Gill, but there were plenty of other memories to discuss.\n\n“My first time,” Brown told me, “like every time—I felt totally safe. I felt appreciated. I do remember the guards telling us, ‘If anything happens, just lay on the ground.’ I don’t know if they still say that.”\n\n“These days it’s more like, ‘You may be taken hostage,’“ I said\n\n“Do you know why they make you wear orange?” A wry smile played across his face.\n\n“I just assumed that they’re trying to make it harder for someone to sneak out with us.”\n\n“Not exactly,” Brown said. “It’s so if they have to start shooting, they know not to shoot you.” He shook his head. “But it was always a safe, friendly atmosphere.”\n\nThere was, alas, no Hollywood ending for Gill, who lived and trained with Brown for eight months after being released in the summer of 2003. Things fell apart when it became clear that he was still drinking. “It was painful, but I held him to our contract,” Brown told me. “He had to go to a halfway house.” Instead of making the Trials, Gill made a series of bad decisions that led to him being locked up once again for about six months. But over the past decade he’s finally turned things around and was recently named squad boss of his wildlife firefighting unit in Washington. “He was so proud when he called me up,” Brown told me.\n\n“How do you open your life up like that?” I asked.\n\n“How do you mean?”\n\n“Take somebody in like that.”\n\n“It takes time. You have to get to know them. Take Kelley, for instance. He wanted to know if he could call me when he was getting out, and ask questions about running, and I said that was fine. And there were others that would send me Christmas cards—”\n\n“You would give out your address?”\n\n“To the ones I became friends with,” he said. “There was a saying in the prison—maybe you’ve heard it? There’s the mad, the bad, and the sad. There’s about 70 percent sad—they’re decent people that got hooked up with drugs or alcohol or made a dumb choice. There’s 15 percent that are mad—that are just mentally ill. And there are 15 percent that are just bad to the bone.”\n\n“Do you think those numbers—the 70/15/15—are reflected in the population of the running club?” I asked.\n\nBrown paused. “The runners feel—and maybe justifiably so—that it is a privilege to be in the club. What I always come back to is this: I never saw anybody make fun of any runner there. Even when you had somebody that was overweight, or not very athletic—even if they just walked most of it, but finished—the guys encouraged them. There is such a sense of pride. Not just in them-selves. But in one another. And when you’re talking about people who might be in for life—even though they might not show it, the thought must be in the back of their minds. I’m gonna die here.”\n\nAMONG THE CROWD OF BLUE AT THE FINISH LINE IS A MAN WEARING A RED SHIRT. Scott tells me that this man is a prison employee—the only employee to cheer on the runners today. I’m not surprised to learn that he’s also a marathoner. The most dedicated spectator, however, is an older inmate, standing alone by the horseshoes, who claps heartily every time we come by. “Yeah!” he says. “Yeah!”\n\nThe pace is just this side of conversational, which means that a couple times per lap I’m able to summon the breath to chat. Even as Mickey and Trapper begin to fall back, Scott tells me how pleased he is to see other inmates in the mix. “So many people have improved,” he says. “Last year I was the only one under 1:50.” He finished in 1:33, so he was literally miles ahead—where Jeff is this year.\n\nI asked him why he joined the running club.\n\n“I was facing 25 years,” Scott says, “and I knew there was going to be limited access to healthcare in here. I wanted to take care of my heart. And emotionally, I just wanted to run.”\n\nOver the next few miles, Scott tells me about his first marathon. This was back in 2011. He’d been dreaming of tackling one for ages but was worried that he wouldn’t have quite enough time to finish it. He realized that his best chance would come on race day, because the guards always gave the running club a little extra time. If he stayed outside after the race and kept going through the main yard line, there would, he calculated, be just enough time to cover 26.2 before the guards cleared the yard. But he would have to break four hours.\n\nScott’s marathon started the instant he was brought outside that spring day in 2011. He got in two miles before the official race even started, then fought the impulse to speed up at the end of the 10K with his running buddies. He kept running through all the postrace relaxing. A little before halfway, the running club went back inside, and the general population was let out, and he began dodging through the nonrunners while steeling himself for any resulting distractions.\n\nThe worry set in at mile 12, the cramps at mile 14. He was behind pace, but just a little. He pressed on, his calf muscles seizing up, his brain misfiring while he attempted to calculate the new mathematical realities that arrived with each lap. It wasn’t until mile 23 that he knew he wasn’t going to do it. At mile 25, the guards cleared the yard. Barely able to walk, Scott was determined to finish his marathon back inside. He hobbled to his cell block, and after 10 blinding minutes on the elliptical, crossed the line with a 4:01:47. Since then, he’s run three more marathons—all arranged around the yard schedule—with a PR of 3:25. He could throw in a sub-four-minute mile right now and I’d probably still be marveling at that 4:01.\n\nIT WAS DICK BROWN WHO BROUGHT BEN ANDREWS, a four-minute miler he was coaching, inside for the first time in 2000. As it happened, their visit coincided with Kelley Slayton’s final loss. “I don’t remember being nervous,” Andrews, who now runs a real-estate company, told me. “More just curious about all of it. What had happened to these people? I’ll never forget the first time I saw Kelley out in the yard. He was so amped. He looked like he had headphones on but he didn’t. He was just getting ready to race.”\n\n“And that first time, you were in there to race?”\n\n“The first time,” Andrews said, “I ran with them. I was like, I’m not gonna be the a--h--- that comes in here and kicks these guys’ asses. And someone five meters back yelled, ‘Hey, Pretty Boy! You better run! You didn’t come here to talk!’ They called me Pretty Boy because I shaved my legs—”\n\n“Oh boy.”\n\n“Yeah! Just chirping, ‘Pretty Boy, Pretty Boy!’ and I’m thinking, I’m dead! What do I do? So I went back into the pack and introduced myself, and the guy was like, ‘I wanna tell you something. If you don’t run hard, you won’t be welcome back. They might let you in, but you won’t be welcome back.’“\n\n“What’d you do?”\n\n“What do you think?” he said. “After I won, that’s when I saw the real race is for second. Rock and Johnny Ace are racing. Johnny Ace? Skinny black guy—he’s been in and out—you’ve probably seen him. He’s not as fast these days. Good guy—from what I know—”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“So I’m kind of rooting them both on. And Rock’s leading leading leading, and then Johnny just outkicks him. You’ve seen Rock, he’s tatted up, he looks like a bad dude. And he was crying. He wasn’t hiding. It was just raw emotion. He was just stripped. So I went over to tell him, ‘Hey man, good race. What’s the matter?’\n\n“He said, ‘I hate losing!’\n\n“And I said, ‘I can help you to never lose again.’\n\n“And he just looked up, and it was like his tears went szzwwhhoop—” Andrews makes the sound of a vacuum cleaner, “right back into his eyes. And he said, ‘What can you teach me, man?’“\n\nAnd with that, Andrews was the next elite runner to coach prisoners.\n\nBen Andrews (above, on left) and Dick Brown, both of whom coached runners at the prison, sharing thank-you cards from inmates (below).\n\nPre’s parents at a prison function circa 1997.\n\n“I went from a $400 phone bill my freshman year of college calling my mommy and daddy,” Andrews says, “to $400 of collect calls with Kelley a few years later. The way our lives changed—I went through some tough times—and he was one of the friendly voices in my life, telling me, ‘Hey man, it’s gonna be all right.’ We’re from the same part of town. It could have all gone differently had he not been using. It changed my life forever, meeting Kelley. To think that me—” Andrews tapped a finger on his chest, “—that I could have an impact on someone…”\n\n“Did you have any anxiety as his release date neared?”\n\n“No. This was my friend about to enter a new chapter of his life. That’s all it came down to. Recently, I hired someone with a record—all because of my relationship with Kelley. I view people differently now.\n\n“I went in with Kelley, his first time back. That was powerful. I remember holding his hand, walking down that hallway after they take your ID. I remember squeezing it, saying, ‘You’ve put in the work, man.’ And he looked at me. Tears. And he was like, ‘I’m doing it, I’m doing it.’“\n\n“THESE RUNNERS TODAY,” the announcer says, “on average, are burning 120 calories per mile.” Throughout the race, he dispenses fun facts along with race updates. In the background, Paul Simon gives way to Bruce Springsteen gives way to Pharrell Williams. Scott and I average a little less than one song per lap.\n\nThe other runners—the runners we’re passing—always have something encouraging to say. “Keep it up! You’re flying.”\n\n“You too!” we say.\n\n“The oldest person ever to finish a marathon was 101 years old,” blares the announcer.\n\nJust about every body type possible is represented out on the course, with inmates ranging from their 20s to their 60s. Some, like Jeff, are remarkably fit. Others are carrying a bit more around the middle. When each runner reaches a noteworthy lap, the announcer says that so-and-so is “halfway there,” or “two-thirds of the way there,” and there is a resulting cheer. I wonder if any of this can be heard on the other side of the wall, out on the sidewalk.\n\n“During the race,” the announcer blares, “these runners will lose approximately one pint of water out of their feet.”\n\nMy feet, incidentally, are feeling lighter and lighter. This is not how my races usually go. Our splits start to dip down under three minutes. I’m starting to think 1:33 is possible. Wait…what? A pint of water out of my feet? Did I hear that right? That can’t be true…I’d be squishing around like crazy. I turn to Scott, to see if maybe I’ve misheard, but he’s not there. I catch sight of him maybe seven, eight meters back. Still looking smooth, still smiling big. “Come on, Michael,” he says. “Get that PR.”\n\nI continue alone, each lap slightly faster than the one before. The cheering gets louder and louder. My lap counter holds up 10 fingers. Then nine fingers, then eight. Beneath the water station, my energy gel is right where I left it. Everything is going my way. I’m beginning to dream of a 1:31.\n\nBefore too long, I hear Jeff’s footsteps a second time. “You’re killing it,” I say.\n\n“Looking good yourself.”\n\nAlong comes Gary. “You gonna get him?” I ask, nodding at Jeff’s receding figure.\n\n“He’s pretty fast,” Gary says, pulling ahead of me effortlessly. “I don’t know.”\n\nBut Gary’s an understated guy, and he probably does know, and I’m stoked to have a front-row seat as he continues to reel Jeff in. But I know that no matter how good I’m feeling, theirs is not a pace I should be running, so I force myself to slow down. Before long they’re across the yard, and my head is semi-permanently turned so I don’t miss the big moment, the moment we’ll talk about all the way back to Portland.\n\nGary catches Jeff around the horseshoes. They race side by side through the swamp. Just ahead of them are two pairs of guys they’re about to lap. And just beyond those guys is the narrowest section of the course, the beginning of the loop around the barn, where a guard stands next to an open gate. Gary realizes that he has just enough time to get around the slower runners before the gate, so he throws in a surge. Jeff can’t quite cover the move. Gary gets through the gate first.\n\n“F---!” Jeff bellows.\n\n“IT WAS A LITTLE SCARY,” Gary admits to me on the ride home. “At the time I thought Jeff was yelling at me.”\n\n“Oh, man.”\n\n“When he finished, I felt a little sheepish going up to him. I still wasn’t sure, you know? But he was so nice. What had happened was, he’d gotten hung up behind the other guys. So I think he was yelling at them, in frustration, or maybe himself. He wanted to win.”\n\n“But for that one split second—”\n\n“I thought I had an angry convict chasing me.” He laughs. “Could you believe all the fruit at the end?”\n\nI confessed I was not expecting to be served mango.\n\n“Those guys put on a great race,” Gary says. “I felt like a rock star out there. Everybody was just—” He shakes his head.\n\n“When was the last time you won a race?” I ask.\n\n“Maybe…high school?”\n\n“Next year?”\n\n“Yeah,” Gary says. “I’d do that again.”\n\nWe make good time on I-5 until the Terwilliger curves, where early rush-hour traffic threatens to scramble up our plans. “Friday,” Gary sighs. He’s got a full afternoon of work ahead of him. Today also happens to be his son’s 15th birthday, which means—yikes—learner’s permit time. As for me, I have a wedding to get to out on the coast, and I’m starting to worry that I won’t have enough time to shower before I collect my friends. And how in the world are these legs going to function on the dance floor?\n\n“It’s gonna be a long day,” I say.\n\n“Oh, back to the free world,” Gary says. “Free world problems, here we come.”\n\n“WHEN I WAS IN THERE,” Kelley Slayton told me, “and I knew people from the outside were coming, it was a day of greatness. Those were special days of the year. I’ll go back again.”\n\n“Ben Andrews says he’ll come in with us for the half,” I said. “That he wants to break 90.”\n\n“I’ll believe that when I see him on the line.”\n\n“Well, I’m in,” I said. “You versus Jeff? I wouldn’t miss that.”\n\n“I’ve been hearing things,” he said. “The guys call me from the yard. ‘Rock, you coming in next month? This new guy is fast. You think you can take him?’“\n\n“And you think you can?”\n\n“After I got out,” he said, “there were times I would tell myself I was never gonna go back. And run with that wall there. It seems like my whole life I was running with that wall there. When you’re out here, running in the community, you’ve got stuff on your mind. You’re planning your day, stuff like that—but in there, when I was running every day, sometimes I’d go through this stage, like, What do I have to look forward to? I hate that wall. And I’d imagine flying over that wall and never having to see it again. Then when I came back for the first time, and ran—before the race even started, just warming up around the track, I went over to it and I was just—running my hand down the side of the wall. Like, wow. I don’t know if it was a spiritual experience, but this wall, that had been here for so long—and I hated it, I used to hate it, when I was in there—I was crying about it. I was happy. I was happy that I’d come back.”\n\n“Is it hard to say goodbye when it’s time go?”\n\n“Still. Every time I go in. I care about those guys. I grew up there. I truly feel like I grew up as a person there. When I go back,” he swallowed, his voice scuffed with emotion, “the toughest thing for me is leaving. That first time, when it was time to leave, I got this kind of eerie feeling. And ever since then, every time, it’s the same thing. It’s hard for me to leave.\n\n“I don’t understand it. It’s awkward saying goodbye. “\n\nAT MIDNIGHT, STROLLING DOWN TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN, my legs still feel light. We leave our shoes in a pile and head for the water. Cold waves break over our feet and someone pops the cork on the champagne. “To Mollie and Russ!” we holler. The stars are toasting them overhead. All of this—rather than distancing me from what happened this morning—brings it back, with a sobering new focus.\n\nThose men I ran alongside today: How many nights like tonight have they kept from happening? How many joyful moments have they destroyed? For so many of their victims, the losses—of loved ones, of trust, of a sense of safety—are ongoing. The notion that this story might inadvertently reawaken somebody’s trauma makes me catch my breath.\n\nBut I keep coming back to something James told me. “There are three reasons we run in here,” he said. “We’re running from our past—and from the stress and depression that come from being in here. We’re running to something, doing what we can to feel normal and healthy. And we’re running for something—to show the world outside that we’re improving, in honor of our victims.” The miles may never add up, but that doesn’t make the effort any less noble.\n\nMy feet are numb. I go back to the shore with my old pal Dempsey while the rest of our friends wade further out. I stifle the urge to yell out a warning.\n\n“Think you’ll be up for a run in the morning?” Dempsey asks.\n\n“Unlikely,” I say.\n\n“You know who won’t be taking the day off—”\n\nHe’s joking, but he’s probably right. Tomorrow morning, every one of the prisoners—even the slowest, Kip—will likely be waiting in their cells, shoes on, anticipating the moment the guards come by for running turnout.\n\nDuring the race, Kip was just one more man in blue. I have no idea how many times I lapped him; he didn’t stand out in any way. In fact, I don’t think I heard his name until an hour after I finished, long after my sweat had dried and my IT bands were as stiff as two wet towels left out in the sun. That’s when I heard the announcer saying, “Kip has two laps left.”\n\nSomeone was still out there? Here we were, gorging on fruit and lounging in the grass and feeling generally terrific, and there was Kip, 37th out of 37, shuffling along in the shade of the 26-foot wall. We got to our feet.\n\nI saw that Kip was the inmate who’d pinned the photo of his family to his shorts.\n\nWhile we watched him circle the yard for the second-to-last time, the guys told me his story. Kip had been a meth addict. One day he got himself into a high-speed chase and crashed into a cop car on the freeway. So he got sent here, and not long into his sentence, he was diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma. Cancer. In this place. Can you imagine? But he beat it. He beat cancer. And so, earlier this year, just a few months ago, he and his wife decided to become runners. They wanted to clean up for their kids and work toward something together. And here he was, about to finish his first half marathon.\n\nCome on, Kip.\n\nWe cast aside our Dixie cups and settled in behind him. Everyone was a runner, even the people who didn’t run, the people in blue jeans—the lap counters, the water station volunteers, the guy standing alone by the horseshoes. Kip didn’t acknowledge us. He just stuck his head forward and led us past all the old landmarks. Goodbye, golf course. Goodbye, horseshoes. Goodbye, swamp. By the time we rounded the barn, I was almost expecting the wall not to be there.\n\nStory Update · October 20, 2016\n\nSince this story was published, runners from around the country have come to participate in the prison’s monthly race series, says writer Michael Heald. Nine visitors ran the third High Wall Half in September (up from four in 2014), including Olympian Ian Dobson, who edged inmate Jeff for the victory in a time “right around 1:20,” Heald says. This year, the series kickoff in March drew about 20 outside participants, roughly as many as the prison will allow, and there’s a waiting list for future races. Dick Brown died in February, but his daughter, Jenny DeLuca, and Dobson perpetuate his legacy as coaches for the inmate runners. (They recently presented DeLuca with a plaque in honor of her father.) Kelley Slayton is currently sidelined from running by basketball injuries, but continues to work as a rehab counselor and is doing well, says Heald. Inmate Scott has since run two more marathons, and he and Mickey now outpace Heald, who’s a regular at the OSP races. “There are certain guys I have a lot of affection for, and that’s a big reason why I go in,” says Heald. “I am comfortable with a limited relationship that involves racing. I think those of us who go in and race will admit that it’s not just this happy occasion. You find yourself examining human nature, and I think that’s part of why you do it.” –Nick Weldon"
