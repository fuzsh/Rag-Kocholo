        "text": "(Above Left) Your race for the Power Spark will take you behind some buildings, through an alley and along the rooftop of the old factory before you finally drop down to the ground for a grassy finish. (Above Right) Pick up the Ice Cream Cake from Clarabelle, which you'll need to deliver to Horace when you return to Mean Street.\n\nYour first task is provided just ahead of the entrance. Gilda is now hanging around in OsTown and if you have her axe, she'll reward you with a Power Spark. She also presents you with a new race. This one is much more difficult than the previous one. You'll have to race along the streets, wind your way behind the houses, pass through a couple of houses, leap up to tag the ball of light as it rests on an eave, then follow it across the street and bounce up from a mailbox to reach the high area atop the factory. From there, leap down to the grassy area beyond and follow the bouncing ball of light to the wall just beyond. It's easiest to win this race once you've memorized the path, and if you cut corners whenever possible. You should actually be able to finish with close to 10 seconds left, if you don't get caught wrangling with the camera along the way. Your reward for winning is another Power Spark."
