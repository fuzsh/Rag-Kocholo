        "text": "There is no reason to believe that Queen Victoria was a wild-eyed devotee of horse racing. However, Her Majesty granted the petition of the little turf club in the boisterous Upper Canada community (the population of Toronto was 44,425) and offered as an annual prize, “a plate to the value of Fifty Guineas.”\n\nCanadian horse-racing had fallen on evil days in 1881, when Joseph Duggan, owner of the Woodbine race course, decided that the only person who could save the situation was Toronto’s postmaster T. C. Patteson, a remarkable man who was recovering from the financial disaster of funding the old Toronto Mail. When he died, the Toronto World described him as “the man of the most distinct personality ever known to Toronto and probably to all Canada.”\n\nPatteson was a paradox – a courtly Etonian and Oxonian who insisted upon transplanting the gracious living of upper class England to rowdy Toronto although for personal protection, he carried a pair of brass-knuckles in his jacket pockets. (Twice, he was knocked senseless by footpads in the Toronto streets.)\n\nPatteson attacked the racing problem with his customary vigour. He called the formation meeting of The Ontario Jockey Club at the Queen’s Hotel in June, 1881. Sir Casimir promptly subscribed $500 and attempted to leave the chair, saying, “There, that’s all I expect that you want of me.”\n\nBut Patteson had other plans which he confided to Sir Casimir. They agreed that horse racing would be established for all time as a Canadian institution – not alone as a sport – if a member of the Royal Family could be persuaded to attend the races at Woodbine. In his personal writings, Patteson envisioned the day “when the Queen herself would be present for the running of The Queen’s Plate.”\n\nThe plot was hatched guilefully. The incumbent Governor-General of Canada was the Marquis of Lorne. The Marchioness of Lorne was Princess Louise, daughter of Queen Victoria. In his capacity as aide-de-camp to the Queen, Sir Casimir invited the Lornes to be his house guests in Toronto. Remarkably, their visit coincided with the spring racing meeting at Woodbine. Remarkably, too, they agreed to accompany their host to the races.\n\nIt was perhaps, typical of Patteson that, writing of the event under a pen-name in The Mail, he remarked testily that “it was unfortunate that Her Royal Highness delayed the start of the racing by being 15 minutes late.”\n\nSir Casimir and Mr. Patteson had turned the trick. Canadian racing was established as “the sport of royalty”.\n\nIn 1974 Queen Mother Elizabeth attended the 115th running of The Queen’s Plate, her fourth official visit to an Ontario race track. The Queen’s Plate was won by Amber Herod, owned by Stafford Farms and trained by Gil Rowntree. He was ridden by Robin Platts.\n\nQueen Mother Elizabeth made her fifth visit to The Queen’s Plate in 1979. This time she attended the 120th running of the three-year-old classic and watched Kinghaven Farms’ Steady Growth defeat Windfields Farm’s Bold Agent over a sloppy track.\n\nIn 1981 The Queen Mother congratulated Mr. and Mrs. Jack Carmichael, trainer Jim Bentley and jockey David Clark after Fiddle Dancer Boy eked out a nose decision.\n\nHer Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother made her sixth appearance at Woodbine in 1985. She made the presentation to Charles Taylor, of Windfields Farm, whose brilliant filly, La Lorgnette won handily. La Lorgnette is the second filly in history to capture both the Canadian Oaks and The Queen’s Plate.\n\nIn 1989 Her Majesty Queen Mother Elizabeth celebrated the 50th anniversary of her first visit to Toronto and the Royal Race. The Queen Mother presented the Gold Cup to With Approval’s proud owner, Mr. “Bud” Willmot."
