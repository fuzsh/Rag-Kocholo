        "text": "Britain has a Paralympic 100m champion for the first time in more than a decade and the era of Tanni Grey-Thompson after Mickey Bushell took a convincing victory in the T53 class wheelchair sprint, leading from almost the first push.\n\nThe Shropshire-born 22-year-old, the world record holder, collected silver in the same event in Beijing and said he had been desperate to go one better. \"Gold was the only thing I wanted, really. I knew I had to work for it and it's been a long, hard four years.\"\n\nBritain's fifth athletics gold medal of Paralympics 2012 saw Bushell set a Paralympic record of 14.75sec, more than 0.3sec ahead of China's Zhao Yufei and Yu Shiran, the defending champion.\n\nBushell knew from the start that victory was likely. \"At the first push someone was in front of me but after that I was confident I was pulling away,\" he said.\n\nLike just about every British athlete who has raced in the Olympic Stadium he credited the partisan 80,000 crowd with a significant role, also praising his team-mate David Weir for his triumph in Sunday's T54 5,000m.\n\n\"The crowd were fantastic. That was the big point for me. They definitely pushed me on,\" Bushell said. \"I watched Dave Weir and, as he crossed the line, I was bouncing off the walls in my room. I didn't know what to do. He's been massive for me, as a team-mate. He's been there for me and he was in Beijing even with all the stuff he had to deal with. He's a fantastic guy and a great role model.\"\n\nA member of the GB team since the age of 15 he took to racing after a school visit by Debbie Brennan, who won silver and gold in the T34 200m and 100m in Athens in 2004.\n\nIn the race before Bushell's there was disappointment for Britain's Stephen Osborne, who finished less than half a second outside the medals, claiming fifth in the T51 classification 100m, an event for wheelchair athletes who also have some impairment to their arms and hands.\n\nMost 49-year-old athletes in their first Paralympics just a year after taking up sprinting – he previously spent a decade playing wheelchair rugby – would be pleased with the result. But Osborne was aware that he finished more than a second outside his personal best which, if matched, would have won him silver.\n\n\"I should have been in the top three,\" he said. \"My best times would have done it. I think I got a bit excited by the crowd. I didn't expect it. I should have stopped looking around at everybody.\"\n\nIt was perhaps understandable that the 80,000 crowd was distracting: in his one year of racing, the biggest crowd he had experienced was \"maybe 30 to 50 people\". Whatever the reason, he never looked in contention in a race that was led from start to finish by Finland's Toni Piispanen.\n\nOsborne said: \"With that crowd I'd have come out and pushed round, just for the experience. But I've totally enjoyed it and I'm going to be around for another four years.\"\n\nThe only other Briton competing in a final, 23-year-old Dean Miller, dropped back to finish seventh in the T37 1500m, a classification often taking in athletes who, like Miller, have cerebral palsy. Ireland's Michael McKillop stormed home to win by more than six seconds.\n\nIn the morning session at the stadium Weir squeaked into Tuesday's final of the 1500m, one of four titles he is competing for in the T54 classification, finishing third little more than 12 hours after his 5,000m triumph.\n\nWeir tracked the leaders for much of the heat but was almost boxed in at the finish. He said there was no need to worry: \"I had so much more in the tank. It's all right. It took a little bit of time to come up on the scoreboard, so I was a bit worried.\n\n\"I only got a few hours' sleep. I've got a lot of recovering to do and I'm glad it's on tomorrow night.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 4 September 2012 because it said Bushell's was the first British win in any discipline of the 100m since 2000, when Hannah Cockroft won gold earlier in these Games."
