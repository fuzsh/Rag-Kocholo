Notices of passing can be sent to nhra@nhra.com.\n\nDan Olson, a longtime NHRA nitro-racing crew chief and former NHRA Director, Top Fuel and Funny Car Racing, passed away recently.\n\nBefore joining NHRA in December 2006, Olson had been a manufacturer and racer for more than 40 years, his most recent before then was helping to guide operations of all teams at Don Schumacher Racing, which he had done since 1998.\n\nDan Olson Racing Products has been designing and manufacturing components for all types of racing since 1969. In Olson’s early years as an engine builder, he realized that the oil pan did far more than just hold oil. He discovered the importance of controlling the oil with proper baffling while it was in the oil pan. He learned that by adding a kick-out, more power could be gained by keeping oil away from the crank assembly. Dan began tuning race cars and boats for legendary owner “Mr. Ed” Wills in the early '60s, then\n\nHe went on to crew chief the Pay-N-Pak hydroplane boat. In the ‘70s, Dan tuned many Top Fuel drag boats, winning many titles as well as tuning the first drag boat to break 200 mph. It was during this time he expanded his product line to include custom oil pans, zoomie headers, wings, and marine oil coolers.\n\nOlson also has served as crew chief for a number of other nitromethane teams including in the 1980s with Larry Minor's team, serving as crew chief for driver Cruz Pedregon, and before that, an assistant crew chief for driver Ed \"Ace\" McCulloch.\n\nIn ’93 he teamed up with Rance McDaniel in a two-year effort, which produced a NHRA national event win and made McDaniel the seventh member of the exclusive 300 mph Club. After two years as crew chief for Top Fuel pioneer Eddie Hill, Olson helped Tony Schumacher to the 1999 Top Fuel championship. In 2000, Olson tuned Schumacher to the first 330-mph run in Top Fuel and in 2004 tuned Gary Scelzi to the first 330-mph Funny Car run.\n\n***\n\nMartee Xakellis, wife of former Division 1 Director Greg Xakellis, passed away peacefully at home on July 19.
