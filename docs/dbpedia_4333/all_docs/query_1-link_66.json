One of the horses, Conquest Cavalry, had to be euthanized. Da Silva was slapped with a 15-calendar-day suspension at the start of the 2018 campaign. The Brazilian-born jockey was so distraught, he almost hung up his tack.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nRejuvenated Da Silva da-livers the goods Back to video\n\n“I was (thinking of retiring) mostly because I was afraid something happened to the jocks (Hernandez and Contreras). But thank God they were OK,” said Da Silva.\n\nThe personable rider also thought the 15-calendar day suspension was too severe, a suspension which resulted in his missing the first six days of the 2018 Woodbine meet.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I was very, very unhappy. I think it (the suspension) was very dishonest. I think it was too hard a suspension, but I didn’t have the stomach to appeal and to watch that race again (on tape),” he said. “But then I put my mind together and set my goals (for 2018) and said to myself, ‘I’m going to do everything to make this my best year.’ I worked a lot on my meditation. I was even more disciplined about what I eat and my (fitness), breathing exercises, everything.”\n\nThe result? Only one of the greatest years ever put together by a jockey at Woodbine. A record-breaking season.\n\nOn Saturday at the west end track, Da Silva recorded his 222nd victory to break the previous record of 221 established by Mickey Walls in 1991. The 43-year-old Da Silva earned the record in the 10th race aboard two-year-old filly Souciologist, trained by Kevin Attard and owned by Al and Bill Ulwelling. Da Silva manoeuvred the maiden-breaking daughter of Gemologist through the 10-horse field. He leads all Woodbine jockeys for earnings ($10.3 million) and stakes wins (28) in 2018. Da Silva also surpassed the 2,000 mark for North American career wins this past September. He added another win on Sunday and is seven away from his goal of 230 victories this season. Riding in North America, specifically at Woodbine since 2004, Da Silva has won 229 stakes including 62 graded stakes.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIf he had walked away from racing, it would have been a huge loss to the Woodbine community. A fan favourite, Da Silva is known for his great riding, his electric smile and his “Good luck to everybody!” catch phrase. If he has any faults, it’s that some of the other jockeys complain that he’s over aggressive at times. But Sandy Hawley, the greatest jockey Canada has every produced, is a huge fan.\n\n“He’s a tremendous rider,” said the retired Hall of Fame jock. “Horses really seem to run for him. And I’ll tell you what, he’s as fit as any athlete I’ve ever seen. I love the riding that he does. He’s got a great seat on a horse and his personality is second to none. I asked (legendary jock) Bill Shoemaker one time, ‘If you could give me one tip that would help make me a great rider, what would that be?’ And he said, ‘Just be a good passenger’. Eurico looks like he’s a good passenger.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“And he’s an amazing guy, a very charitable guy as well, a very giving guy,” Hawley added.\n\nDa Silva holds a 62-win lead ahead of runner-up Rafael Hernandez.\n\nThis is the fourth straight year he has topped the 200-win mark and fifth time as the overall meet leader. Da Silva credits all the trainers he rides for, the grooms, and his agent Mike Luider for his success.\n\n“These last couple of months it’s unbelievable how many trainers want to give me horses to help me break this record,” said Da Silva. “You feel it in their heart that they want me to make it.”\n\nKingsport won Sunday’s $100,000 Sir Barton Stakes for trainer Sid Attard and owners Goldmart Farms and Royal Laster Racing Inc. Jesse Campbell was scheduled to ride but was hurt earlier when he was unseated by his horse Tru Dat in the paddock. Campbell was taken to the hospital with a suspected concussion. He was replaced by Contreras.\n\n“I feel so bad for (Campbell),” said Attard. “He was dying to ride this horse. But Luis did a great job.”\n\nSBuffery@postmedia.com\n\nTwitter @Beezersun\n\nMcKnight wins three\n\nWoodbine trainer Norm McKnight scored three wins at the Rexdale track on Sunday, giving him a record 120 on the season. The record for most wins by a conditioner at Woodbine was 119, set in 2011 by Mark Casse. McKnight’s 120th came in the ninth race with Gold Lace, a four-year old dark bay filly owned by Bruno Schickedanz and ridden by apprentice jockey Kazushi Kimura.\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
