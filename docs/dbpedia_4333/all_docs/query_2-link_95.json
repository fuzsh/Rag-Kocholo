        "text": "Orville Peck with Margo Price - âYou're an Asshole, I Can't Stand You (and I Want a Divorce)'\n\nLabel: Warner Records\n\nRelease Date: August 2, 2024\n\nAlbum: Stampede\n\nProducers: Beau Bedford\n\nSongwriters: Margo Price\n\nWhen Orville Peck released Stampede, a two-part duets album, the masked troubadour unleashed some of music's most unexpected and yet instantly lovable collaborations.\n\nStampede includes rollicking romps with cross-genre stars like Elton John, Noah Cyrus, Beck, Kylie Minogue and Diplo. The album also spotlights some of Peck's fellow country hitmakers, such as Willie Nelson, Mickey Guyton and Midland. There is one pairing on the album, though, that shines among them all.\n\nFor the release, Peck joined forces with straight-shooting Margo Price; and together, they recorded a laughably relatable, deliciously tongue-in-cheek tune that will have you belting, \"You're an asshole, I can't stand you, and I want a divorce!\"\n\n'You're an Asshole, I Can't Stand You (and I Want a Divorce)' kicks off with a swift drum beat before a light shower of shimmering strings. From there, the Western-textured tune becomes flecked with moaning steel and crisp, shuffling rhythms.\n\nThe Price-penned song has layers, building from a faraway warble of weepy strings and softened tempo into a sturdy waltz of trilling keys and brilliant steel.\n\nIt's a striking arrangement, beautifully complimenting both artist's singular vocals, and the perfect foil for a couple's quarrel to unfold.\n\n\"I woke up this morning\n\nIn our king-size bed\n\nEveryday you get further away\"\n\n\"The silence is louder\n\nThan what you ain't said\n\nBut I hear the words you can't say\"\n\n'You're an Asshole, I Can't Stand You (and I Want a Divorce)' opens with Price delicately crooning about a love grown distant. She's been waking up to find her and her partner are increasingly further away from one another.\n\nPeck joins in on the opening verse, echoing something similar. Not only have they grown apart, they're not speaking and much is being left unsaid. They both seem to read the writing on the wall, singing:\n\n\"You're goin' down on love / And everybody knows / Ride the high-country wherever you go / If you want to fly, grab hold of the reigns,\" or rather, \"we all know you're planning to go, so just leave.\"\n\nThe pair doubles down on such a sentiment in the biting yet brilliant chorus:\n\n\"Get back in the saddle\n\nRide away on your horse\n\nYou're an asshole, I can't stand you\n\nAnd I want a divorce\"\n\nBoth artists appear to be in committed relationships â Price to her husband and bandmate Jeremy Ivey and Peck to his partner William Mikelson â so this song seems far from autobiographical. However, the tune falls beautifully into the canon of country divorce songs, an age-old staple in the genre.\n\nRelatable and wounded yet humor-flecked and full of sharp wit, 'You're an Asshole, I Can't Stand You (and I Want a Divorce)' makes for the perfect addition to such a distinction.\n\n\"The light is fading\n\nAnd the day is gone\n\nNothing much left in this one-light town\"\n\n\"You borrow your freedom\n\nOn the back of the dawn\n\nYour making me look like a rodeo clown\"\n\nThroughout the song, Peck and Price make it clear that the relationship is done for. There's nothing left to salvage, so there is no use in pretending anymore. Eventually, they give up the ghost and sing, \"Tell me goodbye / Grad hold of the reigns,\" but not before getting in there last jabs at each other.\n\nThe pair spar with spoken word toward the end of the tune, Peck poking fun at her spelling bee win, Price taking aim at the trademark mask the crooner always dons. Eventually, he tells her: \"Margo, you sure do take the 'O' out of country,\" with her retorting, \"And you put the 'L' in stupid.\"\n\n\"Get back in the saddle\n\nRide away on your horse\n\nYou're an asshole, I can't stand you\n\nAnd I want a divorce...\"\n\nI woke up this morning\n\nIn our king-size bed\n\nEveryday you get further away\n\nThe silence is louder\n\nThan what you ain't said\n\nBut I hear the words you can't say\n\nYou're goin' down on love\n\nAnd everybody knows\n\nRide the high-country wherever you go\n\nIf you want to fly grab hold of the reigns\n\nGet back in the saddle\n\nRide away on your horse\n\nYou're an asshole, I can't stand you\n\nAnd I want a divorce\n\nThe light is fading\n\nAnd the day is gone\n\nNothing much left in this one-light town\n\nYou borrow your freedom\n\nOn the back of the dawn\n\nYour making me look like a rodeo clown\n\nYou're goin' out on me\n\nAnd everybody knows\n\nYou'll come out smelling like a rose\n\nTell me goodbye\n\nGrad hold of the reigns\n\nLook, I don't care it was forty years ago when you won the high school spelling bee\n\nWhat are you even talking about?\n\nNot everybody can spell \"hippopotamus\" and that's at least something you can hang on to\n\nI can't even understand you with that thing on your face\n\nMargo, are you sure do take the \"O\" out of country\n\nAnd you put the \"L\" in stupid\n\nGet back in the saddle\n\nRide away on your horse\n\nYou're an asshole, I can't stand you\n\nAnd I want a divorce\n\nGet back in the saddle\n\nRide away on your horse\n\nYou're an asshole, I can't stand you\n\nAnd I want a divorce\n\n--\n\nFor more on Orville Peck, see below:"
