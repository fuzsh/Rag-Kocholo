Data were collected from October 2019 to July 2021. Statistical analysis was performed from May 2022 to March 2023.Exposures: Hypothesized institutional and individual determinants of occupational well-being.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was ITL, defined as having at least a moderate intention (a score of 2 on a 0-4 scale) to leave one's institution within the next 2 years. Additional outcomes included burnout and professional fulfillment, defined using published Professional Fulfillment Index cut points.Results: Of 18 719 academic physician survey respondents (8381 [44.8%] male; 2388 [12.8%] Asian, 10 599 [56.6%] White, 1039 [5.6%] other race, 4693 [25.1%] unknown race; 294 [1.6%] Hispanic or Latina/Latino/Latinx), 6903 of 18 217 (37.9%) met criteria for burnout and 7301 of 18 571 (39.3%) for professional fulfillment; 5177 of 15 890 (32.6%) reported moderate or greater ITL. Burnout, professional fulfillment, and ITL varied across specialties. After adjusting for demographics, each 1-point increase (range 0-10) in burnout was directly associated with ITL (odds ratio [OR], 1.52 [95% CI, 1.49-1.55])c, and each 1-point increase in professional fulfillment was inversely associated with ITL (OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.63-0.65]). After adjusting for demographics, burnout, and professional fulfillment, each 1-point increase (range 0-10) in supportive leadership behaviors (OR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.82-0.84]), peer support (OR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91-0.95]), personal-organizational values alignment (OR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.80-0.82]), perceived gratitude (OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.92-0.97]), COVID-19 organizational support (OR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.85-0.91]), and electronic health record helpfulness (OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97]) were inversely associated with ITL, whereas each 1-point increase (range 0-10) in depression (OR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.05-1.10]) and negative impact of work on personal relationships (OR, 1.09 [1.07-1.11]) were directly associated with ITL.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of academic physicians, 32.6% indicated moderate or higher ITL within 2 years. Burnout, lack of professional fulfillment, and other well-being factors were associated with ITL, suggesting the need for a comprehensive approach to reduce physician turnover.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.47894\n\nView details for PubMedID 38100103\n\nAbstract\n\nTo assess associations of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and adverse occupational experiences (AOEs) with depression and burnout in US physicians.We performed a secondary analysis of data from a representative sample survey of US physicians conducted between November 20, 2020, and March 23, 2021, and from a probability-based sample of other US workers. The ACEs, AOEs, burnout, and depression were assessed using previously published measures.Analyses included data from 1125 of the 3671 physicians (30.6%) who received a mailed survey and 6235 of 90,000 physicians (6.9%) who received an electronic survey. The proportion of physicians age 29-65 who had lived with a family member with substance misuse during childhood (673 of 5039[13.4%]) was marginally lower (P <.001) than that of workers in other professions (448 of 2505 [17.9%]). The proportion of physicians age 29-65 who experienced childhood emotional abuse (823 of 5038 [16.3%]) was similar to that of workers in other professions (406 of 2508 [16.2%]). The average physician depression T-score was 49.60 (raw score ± SD, 6.48±3.15), similar to the normed US average. The AOEs were associated with mild to severe depression, including making a recent significant medical error (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.33 to 2.02, P<.001), being named in a malpractice suit (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.07 to 1.59, P=.008), and experiencing one or more coronavirus disease 2019-related AOEs (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.56 to 1.99, P<.001). Having one or more ACEs was associated with mild to severe depression (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38 to 1.79, P<.001). The ACEs, coronavirus disease 2019-related AOEs, and medical errors were also associated with burnout.Assessing ACEs and AOEs and implementing selective primary prevention interventions may improve population health efforts to mitigate depression and burnout in physicians.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2023.03.021\n\nView details for PubMedID 38043996\n\nAbstract\n\nTo determine the effects of a popular opinion leader (POL)-led organizational intervention targeting all physicians and advanced practice providers (APPs) working within clinic groups on professional fulfillment (primary outcome), gratitude, burnout, self-valuation, and turnover intent.All 20 Stanford University HealthCare Alliance clinics with ≥5 physicians-APPs were matched by size and baseline gratitude scores and randomly assigned to immediate or delayed intervention (control). Between July 10, 2018, and March 15, 2019, trained POLs and a physician-PhD study investigator facilitated 4 interactive breakfast or lunch workshops at intervention clinics, where colleagues were invited to discuss and experience one evidence-based practice (gratitude, mindfulness, cognitive, and behavioral strategies). Participants in both groups completed incentivized annual assessments of professional fulfillment, workplace gratitude, burnout, self-valuation, and intent to leave as part of ongoing organizational program evaluation.Eighty-four (75%) physicians-APPs at intervention clinics attended at least 1 workshop. Of all physicians-APPs, 236 of 251 (94%) completed assessments in 2018 and 254 of 263 (97%) in 2019. Of 264 physicians-APPs with 2018 or 2019 assessment data, 222 (84%) had completed 2017 assessments. Modal characteristics were 60% female, 46% White, 49% aged 40 to 59 years, 44% practicing family-internal medicine, 78% living with partners, and 53% with children. Change in professional fulfillment by 2019 relative to average 2017 to 2018 levels was more favorable (0.63 points; effect size = 0.35; P=.001) as were changes in gratitude and intent to leave among clinicians practicing at intervention clinics.Interventions led by respected physicians-APPs can achieve high participation rates and have potential to promote well-being among their colleagues.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2022.06.035\n\nView details for PubMedID 36464536\n\nAbstract\n\nThe National Academy of Medicine's 2019 consensus study on clinician burnout identified a need for research evaluating the impact of clinician distress on health care quality. This study examined the association between clinician distress and the inappropriate use of antibiotic prescriptions for acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) in adult outpatients.A retrospective cohort study was conducted using electronic health record visit data linked to annual wellness surveys administered to all clinicians at Boston Medical Center from May 4 to June 20, 2017, and June 5 to July 6, 2018. Included were outpatient visits occurring in Family Medicine, General Internal Medicine, or the emergency department in which an acute RTI for an otherwise healthy adult was listed as a primary diagnosis. The study examined the association of clinician depression, anxiety, and burnout with the visit-level odds of a clinician inappropriately prescribing an antibiotic for an acute RTI.Out of the 2,187 visits eligible for inclusion, 1,668 visits were included in the final sample. Overall, 33.8% and 51.0% of clinicians reported depression/anxiety and burnout symptoms, respectively. Each 1 standard deviation increase in a clinician's composite depression and anxiety score was associated with a 28% increase (odds ratio = 1.28, 95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.61) in the adjusted odds of an inappropriate antibiotic prescription for an acute RTI. Clinician burnout had no significant association with inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for acute RTIs.These findings suggest that clinician depression and anxiety may be important indicators of health care quality in routine outpatient care.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jcjq.2022.01.011\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000805833000006\n\nView details for PubMedID 35489803\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of suicidal ideation (SI) and attitudes regarding help seeking among US physicians relative to the general US working population.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A secondary analysis of a cross-sectional survey of US physicians and a probability-based sample of the US working population was conducted between October 12, 2017, and March 15, 2018. Among 30,456 invited physicians, 5197 (17.1%) completed the primary survey. Suicidal ideation in the last year, attitudes regarding help seeking, symptoms of depression, and burnout were assessed by standardized questions.RESULTS: Among the 4833 physicians who responded regarding SI, 316 (6.5%) reported having suicidal thoughts in the last 12 months. Most physicians (3527 [72.9%]) reported that they would seek professional help if they had a serious emotional problem. Physicians with SI were less likely to report that they would seek help (203/316 [64.2%]) than physicians without SI (3318/4517 [73.5%]; P=.001). On multivariable analysis, symptoms of depression (odds ratio [OR], 4.42; 95% CI, 1.89 to 11.52), emotional exhaustion (OR, 1.07 each 1-point increase; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.11), and self-valuation (OR, 0.84 each 1-point increase; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) were associated with SI. Among individuals aged 29 to 65 years, physicians were more likely than workers in other fields to report SI (7.1% vs 4.3%; P<.001), a finding that persisted on multivariable analysis.CONCLUSION: In this national study conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic, 1 in 15 US physicians had thoughts of taking their own life in the last year, which exceeded the prevalence of SI among US workers in other fields.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.01.033\n\nView details for PubMedID 34301399\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To compare physicians with workers in other fields on measures of self-valuation (SV) and determine the effect of adjusting for SV on the relationship between being a physician and risk for burnout.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A random sample of physicians from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile and a probability sample from the general US population were used. Data were collected for this cross-sectional study between October 12, 2017 and March 15, 2018. Burnout was indicated by a score of 27 or higher on Emotional Exhaustion or 10 or higher on Depersonalization, using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. Self-valuation was measured with Self-valuation Scale items.RESULTS: Physicians (248/832=29.8%) more than workers in other fields (1036/5182=20.0%) \"often\" or \"always\" felt more self-condemnation than self-encouragement to learn from the experience when they made a mistake. Physicians (435/832=52.3%) more than workers in other fields (771/5182=14.9%) \"often\" or \"always\" put off taking care of their own health due to time pressure. Physicians had greater odds of burnout before (odds ratio [OR], 1.51; 95% CI, 1.30 to 1.76) but not after adjusting for SV responses (OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.11). After adjustment for SV, work hours, sex, and age, physicians had lower odds of burnout than workers in other fields (OR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.99).CONCLUSION: Self-valuation is lower in physicians compared with workers in other fields and adjusting for SV eliminated the association between being a physician and higher risk for burnout. Experimental design research is needed to determine whether the association of SV with burnout is causal and the degree to which SV is malleable to intervention at individual, organization, and professional culture levels.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2020.12.032\n\nView details for PubMedID 34210511\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Physician burnout is often assessed by healthcare organizations. Yet, scores from different burnout measures cannot currently be directly compared, limiting the interpretation of results across organizations or studies.OBJECTIVE: To link common measures of burnout to a single metric in psychometric analyses such that group-level scores from different assessments can be compared.DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.SETTING: US practices.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1355 physicians sampled from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile.MAIN MEASURES: We linked the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI) and Mini-Z Single-Item Burnout (MZSIB) scale to the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) in item response theory (IRT) fixed-calibration and equipercentile analyses and created crosswalks mapping PFI and MZSIB scores to corresponding MBI scores. We evaluated the accuracy of the results by comparing physicians' actual MBI scores to those predicted by linking and described the closest cut-point equivalencies across scales linked to the same MBI subscale using the resulting crosswalks.KEY RESULTS: IRT linking produced the most accurate results and was used to create crosswalks mapping (1) PFI Work Exhaustion (PFI-WE) and MZSIB scores to MBI Emotional Exhaustion (MBI-EE) scores and (2) PFI Interpersonal Disengagement (PFI-ID) scores to MBI Depersonalization (MBI-DP) scores. The commonly used MBI-EE raw score cut-point of ≥27 corresponded most closely with respective PFI-WE and MZSIB raw score cut-points of ≥7 and ≥3. The commonly used MBI-DP raw score cut-point of ≥10 corresponded most closely with a PFI-ID raw score cut-point of ≥9.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings allow healthcare organizations using the PFI or MZSIB to compare group-level scores to historical, regional, or national MBI scores (and vice-versa).\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11606-021-06661-4\n\nView details for PubMedID 33791938\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Although misalignment of values between physicians and their organization is associated with increased risk of burnout, actionable organizational factors that contribute to perceived values alignment are poorly understood.Objective: To evaluate the association between the leadership behaviors of immediate supervisors and physicians' perception of personal-organizational values alignment.Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study of faculty physicians and physician leaders at Stanford University School of Medicine was conducted from April 1 to May 13, 2019. The survey included assessments of perceived personal-organizational values alignment, professional fulfillment, and burnout. Physicians also evaluated the leadership behaviors of their immediate supervisor (eg, division chief) using a standardized assessment. Data analysis was performed from May to December 2020.Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between mean leadership behavior score (range, 0-10) of each supervisor and the mean personal-organizational values alignment scores (range, 0-12) for the physicians in their work unit.Results: Of 1924 physicians eligible to participate, 1285 (67%) returned surveys. Among these, 651 (51%) were women and 729 (57%) were aged 40 years or older. Among the 117 physician leaders evaluated, 66 (56%) had their leadership behavior independently evaluated by at least 5 physicians and were included in analyses. The mean (SD) personal-organizational values alignment score on the 0 to 12 scale was 6.19 (3.21). As the proportion of work effort devoted to clinical care increased, values alignment scores decreased. Personal-organizational values alignment scores demonstrated an inverse correlation with burnout (r=-0.39; P<.001) and a positive correlation with professional fulfillment (r=0.52; P<.001). The aggregate leader behavior score of the 66 leaders evaluated correlated with the mean values alignment score for physicians in their work unit (r=0.53; P<.001). Aggregate leader behavior score was associated with 21.6% of the variation in personal-organizational values alignment scores between work units. After adjusting for age, gender, academic rank, work hours, physician-leader gender concordance, and time devoted to clinical care, each 1-point increase in leadership score of immediate supervisor was associated with a 0.56-point (95% CI, 0.46-0.66; P<.001) increase in personal-organizational values alignment score.Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study's results suggest that physicians experience their organization through the prism of their work unit leader. Organizational efforts to improve values alignment should attend to the development of first-line physician leaders.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.35622\n\nView details for PubMedID 33560424\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Sleep-related impairment in physicians is an occupational hazard associated with long and sometimes unpredictable work hours and may contribute to burnout and self-reported clinically significant medical error.Objective: To assess the associations between sleep-related impairment and occupational wellness indicators in physicians practicing at academic-affiliated medical centers and the association of sleep-related impairment with self-reported clinically significant medical errors, before and after adjusting for burnout.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used physician wellness survey data collected from 11 academic-affiliated medical centers between November 2016 and October 2018. Analysis was completed in January 2020. A total of 19 384 attending physicians and 7257 house staff physicians at participating institutions were invited to complete a wellness survey. The sample of responders was used for this study.Exposures: Sleep-related impairment.Main Outcomes and Measures: Association between sleep-related impairment and occupational wellness indicators (ie, work exhaustion, interpersonal disengagement, overall burnout, and professional fulfillment) was hypothesized before data collection. Assessment of the associations of sleep-related impairment and burnout with self-reported clinically significant medical errors (ie, error within the last year resulting in patient harm) was planned after data collection.Results: Of all physicians invited to participate in the survey, 7700 of 19 384 attending physicians (40%) and 3695 of 7257 house staff physicians (51%) completed sleep-related impairment items, including 5279 women (46%), 5187 men (46%), and 929 (8%) who self-identified as other gender or elected not to answer. Because of institutional variation in survey domain inclusion, self-reported medical error responses from 7538 physicians were available for analyses. Spearman correlations of sleep-related impairment with interpersonal disengagement (r=0.51; P<.001), work exhaustion (r=0.58; P<.001), and overall burnout (r=0.59; P<.001) were large. Sleep-related impairment correlation with professional fulfillment (r=-0.40; P<.001) was moderate. In a multivariate model adjusted for gender, training status, medical specialty, and burnout level, compared with low sleep-related impairment levels, moderate, high, and very high levels were associated with increased odds of self-reported clinically significant medical error, by 53% (odds ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.12-2.09), 96% (odds ratio, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.46-2.63), and 97% (odds ratio, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.45-2.69), respectively.Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, sleep-related impairment was associated with increased burnout, decreased professional fulfillment, and increased self-reported clinically significant medical error. Interventions to mitigate sleep-related impairment in physicians are warranted.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.28111\n\nView details for PubMedID 33284339\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Addressing physician suicide requires understanding its association with possible risk factors such as burnout and depression.Objective: To assess the association between burnout and suicidal ideation after adjusting for depression and the association of burnout and depression with self-reported medical errors.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was conducted from November 12, 2018, to February 15, 2019. Attending and postgraduate trainee physicians randomly sampled from the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile were emailed invitations to complete an online survey in waves until a convenience sample of more than 1200 practicing physicians agreed to participate.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the association of burnout with suicidal ideation after adjustment for depression. The secondary outcome was the association of burnout and depression with self-reported medical errors. Burnout, depression, suicidal ideation, and medical errors were measured using subscales of the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index, Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel, and Mini-Z burnout survey and the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System depression Short Form. Associations were evaluated using multivariable regression models.Results: Of the 1354 respondents, 893 (66.0%) were White, 1268 (93.6%) were non-Hispanic, 762 (56.3%) were men, 912 (67.4%) were non-primary care physicians, 934 (69.0%) were attending physicians, and 824 (60.9%) were younger than 45 years. Each SD-unit increase in burnout was associated with 85% increased odds of suicidal ideation (odds ratio [OR], 1.85; 95% CI, 1.47-2.31). After adjusting for depression, there was no longer an association (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.63-1.17). In the adjusted model, each SD-unit increase in depression was associated with 202% increased odds of suicidal ideation (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 2.30-3.95). In the adjusted model for self-reported medical errors, each SD-unit increase in burnout was associated with an increase in self-reported medical errors (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.28-1.71), whereas depression was not associated with self-reported medical errors (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.88-1.16).Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this cross-sectional study suggest that depression but not physician burnout is directly associated with suicidal ideation. Burnout was associated with self-reported medical errors. Future investigation might examine whether burnout represents an upstream intervention target to prevent suicidal ideation by preventing depression.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.28780\n\nView details for PubMedID 33295977\n\nAbstract\n\nAlthough leadership behavior of physician supervisors is associated with the occupational well-being of the physicians they supervise, the factors associated with leadership behaviors are poorly understood.To evaluate the associations between burnout, professional fulfillment, and self-care practices of physician leaders and their independently assessed leadership behavior scores.This survey study of physicians and physician leaders at Stanford University School of Medicine (n = 1924) was conducted from April 1 to May 13, 2019. The survey included assessments of professional fulfillment, self-valuation, sleep-related impairment, and burnout. Physicians also rated the leadership behaviors of their immediate physician supervisors using a standardized assessment. Leaders' personal well-being metrics were paired with their leadership behavior scores as rated by the physicians they supervised. All assessment scores were converted to a standardized scale (range, 0-10). Data were analyzed from October 20, 2019, to March 10, 2020.Association between leaders' own well-being scores and their independently assessed leadership behavior.Of 1924 physicians invited to participate, 1285 (66.8%) returned surveys, including 67 of 117 physician leaders (57.3%). Among these respondents, 651 (50.7%) were women and 729 (56.7%) were 40 years or older. Among the 67 leaders, 57 (85.1%) had their leadership behaviors evaluated by at least 5 physicians (median, 11 [interquartile range, 9-15]) they supervised. Overall, 9.8% of the variation in leaders' aggregate leadership behavior scores was associated with their own degree of burnout. In models adjusted for age and sex, each 1-point increase in burnout score of the leaders was associated with a 0.19-point decrement in leadership behavior score (β = -0.19; 95% CI, -0.35 to -0.03; P = .02), whereas each 1-point increase in their professional fulfillment and self-valuation scores was associated with a 0.13-point (β = 0.13; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26; P = .03) and 0.15-point (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.29; P = .03) increase in leadership behavior score, respectively. Each 1-point increase in leaders' sleep-related impairment was associated with a 0.15-point increment in sleep-related impairment among those they supervised (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.02-0.29; P = .03). The associations between leaders' well-being scores in other dimensions and the corresponding well-being measures of those they supervised were not significant.In this survey study, burnout, professional fulfillment, and self-care practices of physician leaders were associated with their independently assessed leadership effectiveness. Training, skill building, and support to improve leader well-being should be considered a dimension of leadership development rather than simply a dimension of self-care.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.7961\n\nView details for PubMedID 32543700\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To measure self-valuation, involving constructive prioritization of personal well-being and a growth mindset perspective that seeks to learn and improve as the primary response to errors, in physicians and evaluate its relationship with burnout and sleep-related impairment.METHODS: We analyzed cross-sectional survey data collected between July 1, 2016, and October 31, 2017, from 5 academic medical centers in the United States. All faculty and medical-staff physicians at participating organizations were invited to participate. The self-valuation scale included 4 items measured on a 5-point (0-4) Likert scale (summative score range, 0-16). The self-valuation scale was developed and pilot tested in a sample of 250 physicians before inclusion in the multisite wellness survey, which also included validated measures of burnout and sleep-related impairment.RESULTS: Of the 6189 physicians invited to participate, 3899 responded (response rate, 63.0%). Each 1-point score increase in self-valuation was associated with-1.10 point lower burnout score (95% CI,-1.16 to-1.05; standardized beta=-0.53; P<.001) and 0.81 point lower sleep-related impairment score (95% CI,-0.85 to-0.76; standardized beta=-0.47; P<.001), adjusting for sex and medical specialty. Women had lower self-valuation (Cohen d=0.30) and higher burnout (Cohen d=0.22) than men. Lower self-valuation scores in women accounted for most of the sex difference in burnout.CONCLUSION: Low self-valuation among physicians is associated with burnout and sleep-related impairment. Further research is warranted to develop and test interventions that increase self-valuation as a mechanism to improve physician well-being.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2019.04.040\n\nView details for PubMedID 31543254\n\nAbstract\n\nFollowing national calls to address burnout among U.S. physicians, healthcare systems across the nation are integrating measures of physician well-being into institutional assessments. In this paper, we review important conceptual and methodological considerations for selecting self-reported physician well-being measures to monitor health system performance and to screen individual physicians for symptoms of distress. First, we discuss the importance of selecting any given measure of physician well-being based on the degree to which evidence supports the validity of the measure within the context of its intended use. Second, we present a conceptual model explaining the relationship between physician well-being and the larger healthcare context, to assist health systems in identifying the intended goals of physician well-being assessment. Well-being assessments are metrics of individual-level physician wellness/distress and may be indicators of system-level performance. We highlight proposed roles of physician well-being as a performance metric (i.e., as a downstream effect of the medical practice environment, as a predictor of health system outcomes, and as a mediator of the practice environment's effect on health system outcomes). Using this framework, we review the evidence supporting the validity of four of the most commonly used measures of well-being in U.S. physicians, identify gaps in the literature, and present practical recommendations for healthcare organizations' selection of appropriate measurement tools. We conclude by offering directions for future research to advance the measurement of physician well-being outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.cppeds.2019.100662\n\nView details for PubMedID 31562054\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Awareness of the economic cost of physician attrition due to burnout in academic medical centers may help motivate organizational level efforts to improve physician wellbeing and reduce turnover. Our objectives are: 1) to use a recent longitudinal data as a case example to examine the associations between physician self-reported burnout, intent to leave (ITL) and actual turnover within two years, and 2) to estimate the cost of physician turnover attributable to burnout.METHODS: We used de-identified data from 472 physicians who completed a quality improvement survey conducted in 2013 at two Stanford University affiliated hospitals to assess physician wellness. To maintain the confidentially of survey responders, potentially identifiable demographic variables were not used in this analysis. A third party custodian of the data compiled turnover data in 2015 using medical staff roster. We used logistic regression to adjust for potentially confounding factors.RESULTS: At baseline, 26% of physicians reported experiencing burnout and 28% reported ITL within the next 2years. Two years later, 13% of surveyed physicians had actually left. Those who reported ITL were more than three times as likely to have left. Physicians who reported experiencing burnout were more than twice as likely to have left the institution within the two-year period (Relative Risk (RR)=2.1; 95% CI=1.3-3.3). After adjusting for surgical specialty, work hour categories, sleep-related impairment, anxiety, and depression in a logistic regression model, physicians who experienced burnout in 2013 had 168% higher odds (Odds Ratio=2.68, 95% CI: 1.34-5.38) of leaving Stanford by 2015 compared to those who did not experience burnout. The estimated two-year recruitment cost incurred due to departure attributable to burnout was between $15,544,000 and $55,506,000. Risk of ITL attributable to burnout was 3.7 times risk of actual turnover attributable to burnout.CONCLUSIONS: Institutions interested in the economic cost of turnover attributable to burnout can readily calculate this parameter using survey data linked to a subsequent indicator of departure from the institution. ITL data in cross-sectional studies can also be used with an adjustment factor to correct for overestimation of risk of intent to leave attributable to burnout.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30477483\n\nAbstract\n\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Professional Fulfillment Index (PFI), a 16-item instrument to assess physicians' professional fulfillment and burnout, designed for sensitivity to change attributable to interventions or other factors affecting physician well-being.A sample of 250 physicians completed the PFI, a measure of self-reported medical errors, and previously validated measures including the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), a one-item burnout measure, the World Health Organization's abbreviated quality of life assessment (WHOQOL-BREF), and PROMIS short-form depression, anxiety, and sleep-related impairment scales. Between 2 and 3 weeks later, 227 (91%) repeated the PFI and the sleep-related impairment scale.Principal components analysis justified PFI subscales for professional fulfillment, work exhaustion, and interpersonal disengagement. Test-retest reliability estimates were 0.82 for professional fulfillment (α = 0.91), 0.80 for work exhaustion (α = 0.86), 0.71 for interpersonal disengagement (α = 0.92), and 0.80 for overall burnout (α = 0.92). PFI burnout measures correlated highly (r ≥ 0.50) with their closest related MBI equivalents. Cohen's d effect size differences in self-reported medical errors for high versus low burnout classified using the PFI and the MBI were 0.55 and 0.44, respectively. PFI scales correlated in expected directions with sleep-related impairment, depression, anxiety, and WHOQOL-BREF scores. PFI scales demonstrated sufficient sensitivity to detect expected effects of a two-point (range 8-40) change in sleep-related impairment.PFI scales have good performance characteristics including sensitivity to change and offer a novel contribution by assessing professional fulfillment in addition to burnout.\n\nView details for PubMedID 29196982\n\nAbstract\n\nTo examine the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) on suicidal ideation among Veterans with insomnia.Longitudinal data collected in the course of an uncontrolled evaluation of a large-scale CBT-I training program.Outpatient and residential treatment facilities.Four hundred five Veterans presenting for treatment of insomnia.Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I).At baseline, 32% of patients, compared with 21% at final assessment, endorsed some level of suicidal ideation [χ(2)(df = 1) = 125; P < 0.001]. After adjusting for demographic variables and baseline insomnia severity, each 7-point decrease in Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score achieved during CBT-I treatment was associated with a 65% (OR = 0.35; 95% CI = 0.24 to 0.52) reduction in odds of suicidal ideation. The effect of change in insomnia severity on change in depression severity was also significant. After controlling for change in depression severity and other variables in the model, the effect of change in insomnia severity on change in suicidal ideation remained significant.This evaluation of the largest dissemination of CBT-I in the United States found a clinically meaningful reduction in suicidal ideation among Veterans receiving CBT-I. The mechanisms by which effective treatment of insomnia with CBT-I reduces suicide risk are unknown and warrant investigation. The current results may have significant public health implications for preventing suicide among Veterans.\n\nView details for DOI 10.5665/sleep.4410\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000348757800014\n\nView details for PubMedID 25515115\n\nView details for PubMedCentralID PMC4288607\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper examines the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) in Veterans and the effects of two process measures on CBT-I outcomes: 1) therapist ratings of patient adherence and 2) patient ratings of therapeutic alliance. Data are from 316 therapists in the Department of Veterans Affairs CBT-I Training Program and 696 patients receiving CBT-I from therapists undergoing training. Mixed effects model results indicate Insomnia Severity Index scores decreased from 20.7 at baseline to 10.9 (d = 2.3) during a typical course of CBT-I. Patients with highest tercile compared to those with lowest tercile adherence achieved, on average, 4.1 points greater reduction in ISI scores (d = 0.95). The effect of therapeutic alliance on change in insomnia severity was not significant after adjusting for adherence to CBT-I. These results support the effectiveness and feasibility of large-scale training in and implementation of CBT-I and indicate that greater focus on patient adherence may lead to enhanced outcomes. The current findings suggest that CBT-I therapists and training programs place greater emphasis on attending to and increasing patient adherence.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.brat.2013.11.006\n\nView details for PubMedID 24412462\n\nAbstract\n\nPatients with cardiovascular disease who stop smoking lower their risk of subsequent morbidity and mortality. However, patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction (MI) are more likely to be depressed than the general population, which may make smoking cessation more difficult. Poor social support may also make smoking cessation more difficult for some patients. This study examines the effect of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for depression, low perceived social support or both on smoking behavior in post-MI patients.Participants were 1233 patients with a history of smoking enrolled in the Enhancing Recovery in Coronary Heart Disease Patients (ENRICHD) trial who provided 7-day point-prevalence smoking behavior information at baseline and at two or more follow-up assessments. The ENRICHD trial enrolled post-MI patients with depression, low perceived social support or both. Participants were randomly assigned to either CBT intervention or usual care. We used mixed effects models to accommodate data from multiple smoking point-prevalence measures for each individual participant.CBT did not significantly reduce post-MI smoking across all intervention patients with a history of smoking. However, CBT did reduce post-MI smoking among the subgroup of depressed patients with adequate perceived social support (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.47-0.98).CBT for depression without more specific attention to smoking cessation may have little overall value as a strategy for helping post-MI patients refrain from smoking. However, use of CBT to treat depression may have the gratuitous benefit of reducing smoking among some post-MI patients.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PSY.0b013e3181842897\n\nView details for Web of Science ID 000260401100006\n\nView details for PubMedID 18842753\n\nAbstract\n\nPhysiatry is a specialty with high rates of burnout. Although organizational strategies to combat burnout are key, it is also important to understand strategies that individual physiatrists can use to address burnout.To identify changes that resulted in improvement of occupational well-being of physiatrists over a 6- to 9-month period.We employed two quantitative surveys spaced 6 to 9 months apart to identify physiatrists who experienced meaningful improvement in occupational burnout and/or professional fulfillment between the two survey timepoints. These physiatrists were subsequently recruited to participate in a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews to identify changes that respondents felt contributed to improvements in burnout and professional fulfillment.Setting: Online surveys and interviews.Participants: Physiatrists in the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPM&R) Membership Masterfile.Main Outcome Measure: Burnout and professional fulfillment were assessed using the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index.One hundred twelve physiatrists responded to the baseline and follow-up surveys. Of these, 35 were eligible for interviews based on improvements in the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index, and 23 (64%) agreed to participate. Themes from the qualitative interviews highlighted the importance of personal lifestyle choices, approaches to improve professional satisfaction, and strategies to foster work-life harmony. Personal lifestyle strategies included investing in wellness and mental health. Efforts to improve professional satisfaction included decreasing work intensity, prioritizing meaningful aspects of work, and building relationships with colleagues. Fostering work-life harmony also included making trade-offs in both domains, setting boundaries at work, setting expectations at home, and overcoming personal challenges.Our findings illustrate that, in addition to organizational strategies demonstrated to be effective, there are actions that individual physiatrists can take to recover from burnout and foster professional fulfillment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PHM.0000000000002555\n\nView details for PubMedID 38838100\n\nAbstract\n\nPhysiatry is a specialty with high rates of burnout.

Satisfaction with WLI, social isolation, and IWPR were assessed using standardized instruments. Burnout and professional fulfillment were also assessed using standardized scales.The mean IWPR score on the 0-10 scale was 4.39 (standard deviation was 2.36; higher scores were unfavorable). On multivariable analysis to identify demographic and professional factors associated with the IWPR score, each additional hour worked per week decreased the likelihood of a favorable IWPR score. The IWPR, feeling isolated, and satisfaction with WLI were independently associated with burnout after adjusting for other personal and professional factors. On multivariable analysis, healthcare administrators were more likely than U.S. workers in other fields to indicate work had adversely impacted personal relationships in response to the item \"In the past year, my job has contributed to me feeling more isolated and detached from the people who are most important to me.\"Experiencing an adverse IWPR is common among U.S. healthcare administrators, who are more likely than the general U.S. working population to indicate their job contributes to isolation and detachment from the people most important to them. Problems with WLI, isolation, and an adverse IWPR are associated with increased burnout and lower professional fulfillment. Intentional efforts by both organizations and administrative leaders are necessary to address the work characteristics and professional norms that erode WLI and result in work adversely impacting personal relationships.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/JHM-D-23-00134\n\nView details for PubMedID 38467024\n\nAbstract\n\nVacation has been shown to be an important restorative activity in the general population; less is known about physicians' vacation behaviors and their association with burnout and professional fulfillment.To examine the number of vacation days taken per year and the magnitude of physician work while on vacation and their association with physician burnout and professional fulfillment, by individual and organizational characteristics.This cross-sectional survey of US physicians was conducted between November 20, 2020, and March 23, 2021. Data analysis was performed from March to July 2023.Burnout was measured using the Maslach Burnout Index, and professional fulfillment was measured using the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index. Number of vacation days taken in the last year, time spent working on patient care and other professional tasks per typical vacation day (ie, work on vacation), electronic health record (EHR) inbox coverage while on vacation, barriers to taking vacation, and standard demographics were collected.Among 3024 respondents, 1790 of 3004 (59.6%), took 15 or fewer days of vacation in the last year, with 597 of 3004 (19.9%) taking 5 or fewer days. The majority, 2104 respondents (70.4%), performed patient care-related tasks on vacation, with 988 of 2988 (33.1%) working 30 minutes or more on a typical vacation day. Less than one-half of physicians (1468 of 2991 physicians [49.1%]) reported having full EHR inbox coverage while on vacation. On multivariable analysis adjusting for personal and professional factors, concern about finding someone to cover clinical responsibilities (odds ratio [OR], 0.48 [95% CI, 0.35-0.65] for quite a bit; OR, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.21-0.43] for very much) and financial concerns (OR, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.36-0.66] for quite a bit; OR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.27-0.54] for very much) were associated with decreased likelihood of taking more than 3 weeks of vacation per year. Taking more than 3 weeks of vacation per year (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.45-0.98] for 16-20 days; OR, 0.59 [95% CI, 0.40-0.86] for >20 days vs none) and having full EHR inbox coverage while on vacation (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.88) were associated with lower rates of burnout on multivariable analysis, whereas spending 30 minutes or longer per vacation day on patient-related work (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.22-2.04 for 30-60 minutes; OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.41-2.77 for 60-90 minutes; OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.36-2.73 for >90 minutes) was associated with higher rates of burnout.In this cross-sectional study of 3024 physicians, the number of vacation days taken and performing patient-related work while on vacation were associated with physician burnout. System-level efforts to ensure physicians take adequate vacation and have coverage for clinical responsibilities, including EHR inbox, may reduce physician burnout.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.51635\n\nView details for PubMedID 38214928\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the career plans of US physicians at the end of 2021 relative to 2011 and2014.METHODS: Physicians in the United States were surveyed from December 9, 2021, to January 24, 2022, using methods similar to prior studies in 2011 and 2014. Responding physicians in active practice (n=1884) were included in the analysis. At all time-points, physicians indicated the likelihood they would (1) reduce clinical work hours in the next 12 months and (2) leave their current practice within 24 months.RESULTS: In 2021, 542 of 1344 (40.3%) indicated that it was \"likely\" or \"definite\" they would reduce clinical work hours in the next 12 months compared with 1120 of 6950 (16.1%) and 1275 of 6452 (19.8%) in 2011 and 2014. In 2021, 466 of 1817 (25.6%) indicated it was \"likely\" or \"definite\" they would leave their current practice in the next 24 months compared with 1284 of 6975 (18.4%) and 1726 of 6496 (26.6%) in 2011 and 2014. On multivariable analysis pooling responders from 2011, 2014, and 2021, physicians who responded in 2021 had higher odds of reporting intent to reduce clinical work hours compared with those who responded in 2014 (OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.73 to 3.57), whereas those responding in 2011 had lower odds relative to 2014 (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.74 to 0.89).CONCLUSION: Roughly two of every five US physicians intend to reduce their clinical work hours in the next year, more than double previous rates. These findings have potentially profound implications for the adequacy of a US physician workforce already facing substantial shortages.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2023.07.006\n\nView details for PubMedID 37923521\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of politicization of medical care with burnout, professional fulfillment, and professionally conflicting emotions (eg, less empathy, compassion; more anger, frustration, resentment).PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Physicians in select specialties were surveyed between December 2021 and January 2022 using methods similar to our prior studies, with additional assessment of politicization of medical care; moral distress; and having had to compromise professional integrity, workload, and professionally conflicting emotions.RESULTS: In a sample of 2780 physicians in emergency medicine, critical care, noncritical care hospital medicine, and ambulatory care, stress related to politicization of medical care was reported by 91.8% of physicians. On multivariable analysis, compromised integrity (odds ratio [OR], 3.64; 95% CI, 2.31 to 5.98), moral distress (OR, 2.82; 95% CI, 2.16 to 3.68), and feeling more exhausted taking care of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.63 to 4.54) were associated with burnout. Compromised integrity, moral distress, and feeling more exhausted taking care of patients with COVID-19 were also statistically significantly associated with lower odds of professional fulfillment and professionally conflicting emotions. Stress related to conversations about non-approved COVID-19 therapies (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.89), patient resistance to mask wearing (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35 to 2.55), and working more hours due to COVID (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.89) were associated with professionally conflicting emotions.CONCLUSION: Most physicians experienced intrusion of politics into medical care during the pandemic. These experiences are associated with professionally conflicting emotions, including less compassion and empathy, greater frustration, and resentment. COVID-19-related moral distress and compromised integrity were also associated with less professional fulfillment and greater occupational burnout.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2023.07.007\n\nView details for PubMedID 37923520\n\nAbstract\n\nAs health care organizations in the United States move toward recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, physicians and clinical faculty are experiencing occupational burnout and various manifestations of distress. To mitigate these challenges, health care organizations must optimize the work environment and provide support for individual clinicians using a variety of approaches, including mentoring, group-based peer support, individual peer support, coaching, and psychotherapy. While often conflated, each of these approaches offers distinct benefits. Mentoring is a longitudinal one-on-one relationship, typically focused on career development, usually with an experienced professional guiding a junior professional. Group-based peer support involves regular, longitudinal meetings of health professionals to discuss meaningful topics, provide mutual support to one another, and foster community. Individual peer support involves training peers to provide timely 1-on-1 support for a distressed colleague dealing with adverse clinical events or other professional challenges. Coaching involves a certified professional helping an individual identify their values and priorities and consider changes that would allow them to adhere to these more fully, and providing longitudinal support that fosters accountability for action. Individual psychotherapy is a longitudinal, short- or long-term professional relationship during which specific therapeutic interventions are delivered by a licensed mental health professional. When distress is severe, this is the best approach. Although some overlap exists, these approaches are distinct and complementary. Individuals may use different methods at different career stages and for different challenges. Organizations seeking to address a specific need should consider which approach is most suitable. Over time, a portfolio of offerings is typically needed to holistically address the diverse needs of clinicians. A stepped care model using a population health approach may be a cost-effective way to promote mental health and prevent occupational distress and general psychiatric symptoms.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000005276\n\nView details for PubMedID 37220390\n\nAbstract\n\nSystematic reviews by the WHO have shown an increased risk of morbidity and mortality related to ischemic heart disease and stroke among individuals working an average of ≥55 hours/week.A cross-sectional survey of U.S. physicians and a probability-based sample of the general U.S. working population (n=2,508) was conducted between November 20, 2020, and February 16, 2021 (data analyzed in 2022). Among 3,617 physicians who received a mailed survey, 1,162 (31.7%) responded; among 90,000 physicians who received an electronic survey, 6,348 (7.1%) responded. Mean weekly work hours were assessed.The mean reported weekly work hours for physicians and U.S. workers in other fields were 50.8 hours and 40.7 hours, respectively (p<0.001). Less than 10% of U.S. workers in other fields (9.2%) reported working ≥55 hours/week compared with 40.7% of physicians. Although work hours decreased among physicians working less than full time, the decrease in work hours was smaller than the reported reduction in professional work effort. Specifically, for physicians who worked between half-time and full-time (i.e., full-time equivalent=50%-99%), work hours decreased by approximately 14% for each 20% reduction in full-time equivalent. On multivariable analysis of physicians and workers in other fields adjusting for age, gender, relationship status, and level of education, individuals with a professional/doctorate degree other than an MD/DO (OR=3.74; 95% CI=2.28, 6.09) and physicians (OR=8.62; 95% CI=6.44, 11.80) were more likely to work ≥55 hours/week.A substantial proportion of physicians have work hours previously shown to be associated with adverse personal health outcomes.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.amepre.2023.03.020\n\nView details for PubMedID 37178097\n\nAbstract\n\nMultiple national studies suggest that among physicians, physiatrists are at increased risk for occupational burnout.The aim of the study is to identify characteristics of the work environment associated with professional fulfillment and burnout among US physiatrists.Between May and December 2021, a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach was used to identify factors contributing to professional fulfillment and burnout in physiatrists.Online interviews, focus groups, and survey were conducted.The participants are physiatrists in the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Membership Masterfile.Burnout and professional fulfillment were assessed using the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index.Individual interviews with 21 physiatrists were conducted to identify domains that contributed to professional fulfillment followed by focus groups for further definition. Based on themes identified, scales were identified or developed to evaluate: control over schedule (6 items, Cronbach α = 0.86); integration of physiatry into patient care (3 items, Cronbach α = 0.71); personal-organizational values alignment (3 items, Cronbach α = 0.90); meaningfulness of physiatrist clinical work (6 items, Cronbach α = 0.90); teamwork and collaboration (3 items, Cronbach α = 0.89). Of 5760 physiatrists contacted in the subsequent national survey, 882 (15.4%) returned surveys (median age, 52 yrs; 46.1% women). Overall, 42.6% (336 of 788) experienced burnout and 30.6% (244 of 798) had high levels of professional fulfillment. In multivariable analysis, each one-point improvement in control over schedule (odds ratio = 1.96; 95% confidence interval = 1.45-2.69), integration of physiatry into patient care (odds ratio = 1.77; 95% confidence interval = 1.32-2.38), personal-organizational values alignment (odds ratio = 1.92; 95% confidence interval = 1.48-2.52), meaningfulness of physiatrist clinical work (odds ratio = 2.79; 95% confidence interval = 1.71-4.71), and teamwork and collaboration score (odds ratio = 2.11; 95% confidence interval = 1.48-3.03) was independently associated with higher likelihood of professional fulfillment.Control over schedule, optimal integration of physiatry into clinical care, personal-organizational values alignment, teamwork, and meaningfulness of physiatrist clinical work are strong and independent drivers of occupational well-being in US physiatrists. Variation in these domains by practice setting and subspecialty suggests that tailored approaches are needed to promote professional fulfillment and reduce burnout among US physiatrists.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/PHM.0000000000002216\n\nView details for PubMedID 37076955\n\nAbstract\n\nA growing body of evidence for digital interventions to improve sleep shows promising effects. The interventions investigated so far have been primarily web-based; however, app-based interventions may reach a wider audience and be more suitable for daily use.This study aims to evaluate the intervention effects, adherence, and acceptance of an unguided app-based intervention for individuals who wish to improve their sleep.In a randomized controlled trial, we evaluated the effects of an app-based short intervention (Refresh) to improve sleep compared with a waitlist condition. Refresh is an 8-week unguided intervention covering the principles of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) and including a sleep diary. The primary outcome was sleep quality (insomnia symptoms) as self-assessed by the Regensburg Insomnia Scale (RIS). The secondary outcomes were depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score) and perceived insomnia-related impairment.We included 371 participants, of which 245 reported poor sleep at baseline. About 1 in 3 participants who were allocated to the intervention group never accessed the intervention. Active participants completed on average 4 out of 8 chapters. Retention rates were 67.4% (n=250) at postassessment and 57.7% (n=214) at the 6-month follow-up. At postintervention, insomnia symptoms in the intervention group had improved more than those in the waitlist group, with a small effect (d=0.26) in the whole sample and a medium effect (d=0.45) in the subgroup with poor sleep. Effects in the intervention group were maintained at follow-up. Perceived insomnia-related impairment also improved from pre- to postassessment. No significant intervention effect on depression was detected. Working alliance and acceptance were moderate to good.An app-based, unguided intervention is a feasible and effective option to scale-up CBT-I-based treatment, but intervention uptake and adherence need to be carefully addressed.ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN53553517; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN53553517.\n\nView details for DOI 10.2196/39052\n\nView details for PubMedID 36943337\n\nAbstract\n\nMultiple national studies suggest that, among physicians, physiatrists are at increased risk for occupational burnout.Identify characteristics of the work environment associated with professional fulfillment and burnout among U.S. physiatrists.Between May and December 2021, a mixed qualitative and quantitative approach was used to identify factors contributing to professional fulfillment and burnout in physiatrists.Online interviews, focus groups, and survey PARTICIPANTS: physiatrists in the AAPM&R Membership Masterfile MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Burnout and professional fulfillment assessed using the Stanford Professional Fulfillment Index RESULTS: Individual interviews with 21 physiatrists were conducted to identify domains that contributed to professional fulfillment followed by focus groups for further definition. Based on themes identified, scales were identified or developed to evaluate: control over schedule (6 items; Cronbach's alpha=0.86); integration of physiatry into patient care (3 items; Cronbach's alpha=0.71); personal-organizational values alignment (3 items; Cronbach's alpha=0.90); meaningfulness of physiatrist clinical work (6 items; Cronbach's alpha=0.90); teamwork and collaboration (3 items; Cronbach's alpha=0.89). Of 5760 physiatrists contacted in the subsequent national survey, 882 (15.3%) returned surveys (median age 52 years; 46.1% women). Overall, 42.6% (336 or 788) experienced burnout and 30.6% (224 of 798) had high levels of professional fulfillment. In multivariable analysis, each one-point improvement in control over schedule (OR=2.00; 95%CI=1.45-2.69), integration of physiatry into patient care (OR=1.77; 95%CI=1.32-2.38), personal-organizational-values alignment (OR=1.92; 95%CI=1.48-2.52), meaningfulness of physiatrist clinical work (OR=2.79; 95%CI=1.71-4.71) and teamwork and collaboration score (OR=2.11; 95%CI=1.48-3.03) was independently associated with higher likelihood of professional fulfillment.Control over schedule, optimal integration of physiatry into clinical care, personal-organizational values alignment, teamwork, and meaningfulness of physiatrist clinical work are strong and independent drivers of occupational well-being in U.S. physiatrists. Variation in these domains by practice setting and sub-specialty suggests tailored approaches are needed to promote professional fulfillment and reduce burnout among US physiatrists.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1002/pmrj.12961\n\nView details for PubMedID 36794660\n\nAbstract\n\nPhysicians are experiencing symptoms of burnout at unprecedented rates. It is essential to assess programmatic factors contributing to physician burnout as actionable items for work climate improvement. Creation of an evidence base of strategies and methods to cultivate a culture of wellness requires iterative assessment, program development and implementation, and evaluation. To serve their function optimally, assessment tools need to be reliable, valid, and sensitive to change. In this Invited Commentary, the authors discuss Vermette and colleagues' report on the Residency Program Community Well-Being (RCWB) instrument. The authors examine the utility of the RCWB, a novel, validated tool that quantifies the subjective community well-being of an individual residency program and has 3 subscales that measure key aspects of interpersonal interactions among residents, with emphasis on those within the program leadership sphere of influence. The commentary authors recommend further validation of the RCWB, but acknowledge the instrument is a useful contribution to currently available measures in the domains of community well-being, workplace climate, and culture of wellness. Workplace interventions focused on community well-being or culture of wellness are particularly salient ethical and educational priorities for medical training programs. Prioritizing community well-being will help nurture trainees as an investment in the future of medical care, rather than an exploitable resource valued primarily for short-term work demands.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000005163\n\nView details for PubMedID 36745876\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Student Bodies-Eating Disorders intervention (SB-ED), a digital cognitive behavior therapy-guided self-help intervention for college women with an eating disorder, is effective for reducing eating disorder psychopathology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate moderators and mediators of the SB-ED intervention. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of clinical mediators of a digital intervention for women with eating disorders.This is an exploratory secondary analysis of a cluster randomized trial comparing the SB-ED intervention to referral to usual care among 690 women at 27 United States colleges. Moderators included body mass index (BMI), race, ethnicity, weight/shape concerns, eating disorder impairment, thin ideal internalization, depression, anxiety, and motivation for treatment, assessed at baseline. Thin ideal internalization and depressive symptoms were tested as predictors at postintervention and mediators at 2-year follow-up. Outcome was change in global eating disorder psychopathology.BMI moderated the effect of the intervention at follow-up (but not posttreatment), with individuals with a lower BMI experiencing more continued improvements in eating disorder psychopathology following the intervention than individuals with a higher BMI. Thin ideal internalization mediated the effect of the intervention at follow-up, and depression partially mediated the effect of the intervention at follow-up.Results of the mediator analyses suggest that helping college women reduce inflated internalization of the thin ideal and improve depressive symptoms leads to improvements in eating disorder psychopathology. Results also suggest opportunities to optimize the intervention so individuals across the BMI spectrum experience ongoing improvements over time.

Many organizations are committed to this work and have clarity on how to address general, system-wide issues and provide resources for individual clinicians. While such top of the organization elements are essential for success, many of the specific improvement efforts that are necessary must address local challenges at the work unit level (department, division, hospital ward, clinic). Uncertainty of how to address variability and the unique needs of different work units is a barrier to effective action for many health care delivery systems. Overcoming this challenge requires organizations to recognize that unit-specific improvement efforts require a system-level approach. In this manuscript, we outline 7 steps for organizations to consider as they establish the infrastructure to improve professional well-being and provide a description of application and evidence of efficacy from a large academic medical center. Such unit-level efforts to address the unique needs of each specialty and occupation at the work unit level have the ability to address many of the day-to-day issues that drive clinician well-being. An enterprise approach is necessary to systematically advance such unit-level action.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2022.10.031\n\nView details for PubMedID 36603944\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of burnout and satisfaction with work-life integration (WLI) in US physicians at the end of 2021, roughly 21 months into the COVID-19 pandemic, with comparison to 2020, 2017, 2014, and2011.METHODS: Between December 9, 2021, and January 24, 2022, we surveyed US physicians using methods similar to those of our prior studies. Burnout, WLI, depression, and professional fulfillment were assessed with standard instruments.RESULTS: There were 2440 physicians who participated in the 2021 survey. Mean emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores were higher in 2021 than those observed in 2020, 2017, 2014, and 2011 (all P<.001). Mean emotional exhaustion scores increased 38.6% (2020 mean, 21.0; 2021 mean, 29.1; P<.001), whereas mean depersonalization scores increased 60.7% (2020 mean, 6.1; 2021 mean, 9.8; P<.001). Overall, 62.8% of physicians had at least 1 manifestation of burnout in 2021 compared with 38.2% in 2020, 43.9% in 2017, 54.4% in 2014, and 45.5% in 2011 (all P<.001). Although these trends were consistent across nearly all specialties, substantial variability by specialty was observed. Satisfaction with WLI declined from 46.1% in 2020 to 30.2% in 2021 (P<.001). Mean scores for depression increased 6.1% (2020 mean, 49.54; 2021 mean, 52.59; P<.001).CONCLUSION: A dramatic increase in burnout and decrease in satisfaction with WLI occurred in US physicians between 2020 and 2021. Differences in mean depression scores were modest, suggesting that the increase in physician distress was overwhelmingly work related. Given the association of physician burnout with quality of care, turnover, and reductions in work effort, these findings have profound implications for the US health care system.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2022.09.002\n\nView details for PubMedID 36229269\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of imposter phenomenon (IP) experiences among physicians and evaluate their relationship to personal and professional characteristics, professional fulfillment, burnout, and suicidal ideation.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: Between November 20, 2020, and February 16, 2021, we surveyed US physicians and a probability-based sample of the US working population. Imposter phenomenon was measured using a 4-item version of the Clance Imposter Phenomenon Scale. Burnout and professional fulfillment were measured using standardized instruments.RESULTS: Among the 3237 physician responders invited to complete the subsurvey including the IP scale, 3116 completed the IP questions. Between 4% (133) and 10% (308) of the 3116 physicians endorsed each of the 4 IP items as a \"very true\" characterization of their experience. Relative to those with a low IP score, the odds ratio for burnout among those with moderate, frequent, and intense IP was 1.28 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.58), 1.79 (95% CI, 1.38 to 2.32), and 2.13 (95% CI, 1.43 to 3.19), respectively. A similar association between IP and suicidal ideation was observed. On multivariable analysis, physicians endorsed greater intensity of IP than workers in other fields in response to the item, \"I am disappointed at times in my present accomplishments and think I should have accomplished more.\"CONCLUSION: Imposter phenomenon experiences are common among US physicians, and physicians have more frequent experiences of disappointment in accomplishments than workers in other fields. Imposter phenomenon experiences are associated with increased burnout and suicidal ideation and lower professional fulfillment. Systematic efforts to address the professional norms and perfectionistic attitudes that contribute to this phenomenon are necessary.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2022.06.021\n\nView details for PubMedID 36116974\n\nAbstract\n\nGOAL: The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of burnout and professional fulfillment among healthcare administrative leaders and examine the association between burnout and professional fulfillment and personal and professional characteristics.METHODS: Between June 7 and June 30, 2021, we performed a national survey of CEOs and other senior operational leaders to evaluate their personal work experience. Burnout and professional fulfillment-as well as a sleep-related impairment and self-valuation-were assessed using standardized instruments.PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Of the 5,994 members of the American College of Healthcare Executives who were sent an invitation to participate, 1,269 (21.2%), including 279 CEOs, submitted usable responses. The mean overall burnout score was 2.71 (range: 0-10), and 33% of participants had burnout scores that fell in the high range (unfavorable). Mean professional fulfillment score was 7.29 (range: 0-10), with 56.6% scoring in the high range (favorable). Burnout and professional fulfillment scores varied by role. On multivariable analysis, sleep-related impairment (OR for each 1-point increase = 1.29, 95% CI [1.19-1.41]; p < .001) and self-valuation (OR for each 1-point increase = 0.63, 95% CI [0.57-0.68]; p < .001) were independently associated with burnout after adjusting for all other variables.APPLICATIONS TO PRACTICE: Results of this study suggest that healthcare leaders had lower burnout and professional fulfillment scores than clinicians. Nonetheless, one-third of healthcare leaders had burnout scores that fell in the high range. At the individual level, sleep health and self-valuation appear to reduce risk of burnout and promote professional fulfillment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/JHM-D-22-00012\n\nView details for PubMedID 35984407\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Reducing physician occupational distress requires understanding workplace mistreatment, its relationship to occupational well-being, and how mistreatment differentially impacts physicians of diverse identities.Objectives: To assess the prevalence and sources of mistreatment among physicians and associations between mistreatment, occupational well-being, and physicians' perceptions of protective workplace systems.Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study was administered in September and October 2020 to physicians at a large academic medical center. Statistical analysis was performed from May 2021 to February 2022.Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary measures were the Professional Fulfillment Index, a measure of intent to leave, and the Mistreatment, Protection, and Respect Measure (MPR). Main outcomes were the prevalence and sources of mistreatment. Secondary outcomes were the associations of mistreatment and perceptions of protective workplace systems with occupational well-being.Results: Of 1909 medical staff invited, 1505 (78.8%) completed the survey. Among respondents, 735 (48.8%) were women, 627 (47.1%) were men, and 143 (9.5%) did not share gender identity or chose \"other\"; 12 (0.8%) identified as African American or Black, 392 (26%) as Asian, 10 (0.7%) as multiracial, 736 (48.9%) as White, 63 (4.2%) as other, and 292 (19.4%) did not share race or ethnicity. Of the 1397 respondents who answered mistreatment questions, 327 (23.4%) reported experiencing mistreatment in the last 12 months. Patients and visitors were the most common source of mistreatment, reported by 232 physicians (16.6%). Women were more than twice as likely as men to experience mistreatment (31% [224 women] vs 15% [92 men]). On a scale of 0 to 10, mistreatment was associated with a 1.13 point increase in burnout (95% CI, 0.89 to 1.36), a 0.99-point decrease in professional fulfillment (95% CI, -1.24 to -0.73), and 129% higher odds of moderate or greater intent to leave (odds ratio, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.75 to 2.99). When compared with a perception that protective workplace systems are in place \"to a very great extent,\" a perception that there are no protective workplace systems was associated with a 2.41-point increase in burnout (95% CI, 1.80 to 3.02), a 2.81-point lower professional fulfillment score (95% CI, -3.44 to -2.18), and 711% higher odds of intending to leave (odds ratio, 8.11; 95% CI, 3.67 to 18.35).Conclusions and Relevance: This survey study found that mistreatment was common among physicians, varied by gender, and was associated with occupational distress. Patients and visitors were the most frequent source, and perceptions of protective workplace systems were associated with better occupational well-being. These findings suggest that health care organizations should prioritize reducing workplace mistreatment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.10768\n\nView details for PubMedID 35522279\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Burnout is common among physicians and is associated with suboptimal patient outcomes. Little is known about how experiences with patients, families, and visitors differ by physician characteristics or contribute to the risk of burnout.Objective: To examine the occurrence of mistreatment and discrimination by patients, families, and visitors by physician characteristics and the association between such interactions and experiencing burnout.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey was conducted from November 20, 2020, to March 23, 2021, among US physicians.Exposures: Mistreatment and discrimination were measured using items adapted from the Association of American Medical College's Graduation Questionnaire with an additional item querying respondents about refusal of care because of the physicians' personal attributes; higher score indicated greater exposure to mistreatment and discrimination.Main Outcomes and Measures: Burnout as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory.Results: Of 6512 responding physicians, 2450 (39.4%) were female, and 369 (7.2%) were Hispanic; 681 (13.3%) were non-Hispanic Asian, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander; and 3633 (70.5%) were non-Hispanic White individuals. Being subjected to racially or ethnically offensive remarks (1849 [29.4%]), offensive sexist remarks (1810 [28.7%]), or unwanted sexual advances (1291 [20.5%]) by patients, families, or visitors at least once in the previous year were common experiences. Approximately 1 in 5 physicians (1359 [21.6%]) had experienced a patient or their family refusing to allow them to provide care because of the physician's personal attributes at least once in the previous year. On multivariable analyses, female physicians (OR, 2.33; 95% CI, 2.02-2.69) and ethnic and racial minority physicians (eg, Black or African American: OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.13-2.23) were more likely to report mistreatment or discrimination in the previous year. Experience of mistreatment or discrimination was independently associated with higher odds of burnout (vs score of 0 [no mistreatment], score of 1: OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.55; score of 2: OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.38-2.08; score of 3: OR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.89-2.57). There was no difference in the odds of burnout by gender after controlling for experiencing mistreatment and discrimination score and other demographic factors, specialty, practice setting, work hours, and frequency of overnight call.Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, mistreatment and discrimination by patients, families, and visitors were common, especially for female and racial and ethnic minority physicians, and associated with burnout. Efforts to mitigate physician burnout should include attention to patient and visitor conduct.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.13080\n\nView details for PubMedID 35587344\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: The questionnaire \"Professional Fulfillment Index\" (PFI) was validated to assess emotional exhaustion, interpersonal disengagement, and professional achievement among physicians. This study presents the process of cross-cultural adaptation of the PFI to the Brazilian context.DESIGN: Analytical cross-sectional study carried out between July and October 2020. Settings: For conceptual equivalence, a panel of experts was constituted who conducted analyzes on the translation and back-translation processes from English to Brazilian Portuguese.SUBJECTS: For the operational equivalence, 432 physicians in the field of Occupational Medicine were invited.MEASURES: They answered the PFI in an online platform. Analysis: Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were performed to seek evidence of the hypothesized structure of PFI item responses. Reliability was assessed using three indicators.RESULTS: The Brazilian version can be considered similar to the original. Most of participants were female (57.6%) and mean age 49.6years-SD 14.0. The mean time since graduation was 18.5years-SD 9.67. Most of them had a full-time job (88.0%) and were trained through post-graduation courses 83.8%. The most frequent job task was to perform workers clinical evaluations (84.9%). Exploratory and confirmatory analyzes showed the adequacy of the items in measuring the instrument's construct, with stability for use in other populations and samples.CONCLUSION: The PFI was developed to evaluate positive and negative aspects of physicians' role and performance. The process described in this article was the first cross-cultural adaptation of the questionnaire. The PFI can help in mapping potential risk situations for negative impacts on physicians' occupational well-being and performance at work, in order to propose interventions that reduce exhaustion and expand professional fulfillment.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1177/08901171221086945\n\nView details for PubMedID 35417258\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: We conducted an exploratory study to identify risk factors of dropout in an 8-week e-mail-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (REFRESH) to improve sleep among university students with insomnia symptoms.METHODS: University and graduate students in Hong Kong and Korea who scored higher than 10 on the Insomnia Severity Index participated in REFRESH.RESULTS: Of 158 participants from Hong Kong (n = 43) and Korea (n = 115), 90 (57%) did not complete all 7 sessions, while 52 of 90 (57.8%) dropped out prior to the fourth session. ROC analysis was conducted on the entire sample of 158 participants with intervention completion vs. dropout (non-completion) as the outcome variable. Predictors of dropout were wake time after sleep onset (WASO)<7.1min on the weekly sleep diary and expectations for sleep (a subscale of dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep; DBAS)<18 at baseline.CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that shorter WASO and less expectations for sleep at baseline were associated with risk of dropout from e-mail delivered self-help CBT-I-based intervention. Our results highlight the importance of identifying and tailoring treatment formats to students based on their presenting sleep characteristics.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1007/s11325-022-02609-y\n\nView details for PubMedID 35412222\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of burnout and satisfaction with work-life integration (WLI) among physicians and US workers in 2020 relative to 2011, 2014, and2017.METHODS: Between November 20, 2020, and March 23, 2021, we surveyed US physicians and a probability-based sample of the US working population using methods similar to our prior studies. Burnout and WLI were measured using standard tools. Information about specific work-related COVID-19 experiences was collected.RESULTS: There were 7510 physicians who participated in the survey. Nonresponder analysis suggested that participants were representative of US physicians. Mean emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores were lower in 2020 than in 2017, 2014, and 2011 (all P<.001). However, emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scores did not improve in specialties most heavily affected by COVID-19. Overall, 38.2% of physicians reported 1 or more symptoms of burnout in 2020 compared with 43.9% in 2017, 54.4% in 2014, and 45.5% in 2011 (all P<.001). Providing care without adequate personal protective equipment (odds ratio [OR], 1.53; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.72) and having suffered disruptive economic consequences due to COVID-19 (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.32 to 1.69) were independently associated with risk of burnout. On multivariable analysis, physicians were at increased risk for burnout (OR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.25 to 1.58) and were less likely to be satisfied with WLI (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.79) than other working US adults.CONCLUSION: Burnout and satisfaction with WLI among US physicians improved between 2017 and 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on physicians varies on the basis of professional characteristics and experiences. Physicians remain at increased risk for burnout relative to workers in other fields.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.11.021\n\nView details for PubMedID 35246286\n\nAbstract\n\nThis study examined the effects of an e-mail-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), validated in Western countries, on insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression in young adults with insomnia in Eastern countries, particularly Japan. This prospective parallel-group randomized clinical trial included college students with Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) scores of ten or higher. Participants were recruited via advertising on a university campus and randomized to an e-mail-delivered CBT-I (REFRESH) or self-monitoring (SM) with sleep diaries group. The primary outcomes were insomnia severity, anxiety, and depression; secondary outcomes were sleep hygiene practices, dysfunctional beliefs, sleep reactivity, and pre-sleep arousal. All measurements were assessed before and after the intervention. A total of 48 participants (mean (SD) age, 19.56 (1.86) years; 67% female) were randomized and included in the analysis. The results of the intent-to-treat analysis showed a significant interaction effect for insomnia severity, anxiety, depression, sleep hygiene practice, and pre-sleep arousal. Compared with the SM group, the REFRESH group was more effective in reducing insomnia severity (Hedges' g = 1.50), anxiety (g = 0.97), and depression (g = 0.61) post-intervention. These findings suggest that an e-mail-delivered CBT-I may be an effective treatment for young adults with elevated insomnia symptoms living in Japan.\n\nView details for DOI 10.3390/ijerph19010186\n\nView details for PubMedID 35010445\n\nAbstract\n\nThin ideal internalization is a risk factor for disordered eating behaviors, poor body image, and eating disorders (EDs). This paper evaluated the psychometric properties of a novel measure, the Perceived Benefits of Thinness Scale (PBTS), which assesses how individuals feel being thinner would affect various aspects of their lives. Three separate studies with unique samples of college-aged women over 18 years were conducted to assess reliability and validity. In Study 1, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggested all PBTS items loaded onto one factor that was distinct from a measure of weight and shape concerns. A large correlation between changes in PTBS scores and changes in ED psychopathology scores over 8 months (r=.57, p<.01) suggested sensitivity to change. Greater severity in ED pathology was also associated with higher scores on the PBTS. In Study 2, the PBTS showed good test-retest reliability (r=.84, p<.001) and, in Study 3, expected correlations with existing measures of thin ideal internalization (rs=.38-.60, ps<.001). Overall, the PBTS displayed good factor structure, reliability, concurrent validity, and sensitivity to change. By emphasizing social, emotional, and quality of life benefits, the PBTS may serve clinicians, researchers, and patients in understanding thin ideal internalization and associated ED risk.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.bodyim.2021.11.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 34896896\n\nAbstract\n\nPURPOSE: To compare acute effects of 2 dietary interventions with usual dietary habits on physician trainees' alertness during overnight shifts.METHOD: This registered, controlled, block-randomized crossover trial (NCT03698123) was conducted between October 2018 and May 2019 at Stanford Medicine. Physician trainees working at least 3 overnight shifts during a 1-week period were recruited. During the first overnight shift, participants followed their usual dietary habits. During the intervention nights (low carbohydrate-to-protein ratio and high carbohydrate-to-protein ratio interventions), participants received healthy dinners, snacks, water, and, upon request, caffeinated beverages, at the beginning of their shifts and were instructed to eat meals before 10 p.m. The sequence of interventions on the second and third nights were block-randomized across study weeks. Outcome measures (a priori) were overnight changes in validated measures of specific neurobehavioral dimensions: psychomotor vigilance, sensory-motor speed, working memory, and risk decision-making, as well as self-reported sleepiness and work exhaustion.RESULTS: Sixty-one physician trainees participated in this study. Compared to usual dietary habits, overnight changes in psychomotor vigilance scores (scale 0-1,000) improved by 51.02 points (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.08, 89.96); sleepiness (scale 1-7) improved by 0.69 points (95% CI: 0.33, 1.05) under the low carbohydrate-to-protein ratio intervention. Compared to usual dietary habits, overnight changes in sleepiness (scale 1-7) improved by 0.61 points (95% CI: 0.25, 0.96) under the high carbohydrate-to-protein ratio intervention. Neither intervention had beneficial effects relative to usual dietary habits with respect to sensory-motor speed, working memory, risk decision-making, or work exhaustion. There were no differences in outcomes between low carbohydrate-to-protein ratio and high carbohydrate-to-protein ratio interventions.CONCLUSIONS: Dietary interventions may mitigate negative effects of physician trainee sleep deprivation during overnight shifts. Future studies are warranted to further examine the effectiveness of nutritional strategies on physician alertness during overnight shifts.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1097/ACM.0000000000004509\n\nView details for PubMedID 34753859\n\nAbstract\n\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate how variation in the way patient satisfaction feedback is delivered relates to physician well-being and perceptions of its impact on patient care, job satisfaction, and clinical decision making.PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional electronic survey was sent to faculty physicians from a large academic medical center in March 29, 2019. Physicians reported their exposure to feedback (timing, performance relative to peers, or channel) and related perceptions. The Professional Fulfillment Index captured burnout and professional fulfillment. Associations between feedback characteristics and well-being or perceived impact were tested using analysis of variance or logistic regression adjusted for covariates.RESULTS: Of 1016 survey respondents, 569 (56.0%) reported receiving patient satisfaction feedback. Among those receiving feedback, 303 (53.2%) did not believe that this feedback improved patient care. Compared with physicians who never received feedback, those who received any type of feedback had higher professional fulfillment scores (mean, 6.6±2.1 vs 6.3±2.0; P=.03) but also reported an unfavorable impact on clinical decision making (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 4.7; P<.001). Physicians who received feedback that included one-on-one discussions (as opposed to feedback without this channel) held more positive perceptions of the feedback's impact on patient care (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.0; P=.003), whereas perceptions were less positive in physicians whose feedback included comparisons to named colleagues (OR, 0.5; 95% CI, 0.3 to 0.8; P=.003).CONCLUSION: Providing patient satisfaction feedback to physicians was associated with mixed results, and physician perceptions of the impact of feedback depended on the characteristics of feedback delivery. Our findings suggest that feedback is viewed most constructively by physicians when delivered through one-on-one discussions and without comparison to peers.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.mayocp.2021.03.039\n\nView details for PubMedID 34479736\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Disparities in US physician burnout rates across age, gender, and specialty groups as measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey for Medical Personnel (MBI) are well documented. We evaluated whether disparities in US physician burnout are explained by differences in the MBI's functioning across physician age, gender, and specialty groups.METHODS: We assessed the measurement equivalence of the MBI across age, gender, and specialty groups in multi-group item response theory- (IRT-) based differential item functioning (DIF) analyses using secondary, cross-sectional survey data from US physicians (n=6577). We detected DIF using two IRT-based methods and assessed its impact by estimating the overall average difference in groups' subscale scores attributable to DIF. We assessed DIF's practical significance by comparing differences in individuals' subscale scores and burnout prevalence estimates from models unadjusted and adjusted for DIF.RESULTS: We detected statistically significant age-, gender-, and specialty- DIF in all but one MBI item. However, in all cases, average differences in expected subscale-level scores due to DIF were<0.10 SD on each subscale. Differences in physicians' individual-level subscale scores and burnout symptom prevalence estimates across DIF- adjusted and unadjusted IRT models were also small (in all cases, mean absolute differences in individual subscale scores were<0.04 z-score units; prevalence estimates differed by <0.70%).CONCLUSIONS: Age-, gender-, and specialty-related disparities in US physician burnout are not explained by differences in the MBI's functioning across these demographic groups. Our findings support the use of the MBI as a valid tool to assess age-, gender-, and specialty-related disparities in US physician burnout.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1186/s41687-021-00312-2\n\nView details for PubMedID 34089412\n\nAbstract\n\nImportance: Poor work-life integration (WLI) occurs when career and personal responsibilities come in conflict and may contribute to the ongoing high rates of physician burnout. The characteristics associated with WLI are poorly understood.Objective: To identify personal and professional factors associated with WLI in physicians and identify factors that modify the association between gender and WLI.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study was based on electronic and paper surveys administered October 2017 to March 2018 at private, academic, military, and veteran's practices across the US. It used a population-based sample of US physicians across all medical specialties. Data analysis was performed from November 2019 to July 2020.Main Outcomes and Measures: WLI was assessed using an 8-item scale (0-100 point scale, with higher scores indicating favorable WLI), alongside personal and professional factors. Multivariable linear regressions evaluated independent associations with WLI as well as factors that modify the association between gender and WLI.Results: Of 5197 physicians completing surveys, 4370 provided complete responses. Of the physicians who provided complete responses, 2719 were men, 3491 were White/Caucasian (80.8%), 3560 were married (82.4%), and the mean (SD) age was 52.3 (12.0) years. The mean (SD) WLI score was 55 (23). Women reported lower (worse) mean (SD) WLI scores than men overall (52 [22] vs 57 [23]; mean difference, -5 [-0.2 SDs]; P<.001). In multivariable regression, lower WLI was independently associated with being a woman (linear regression coefficient, -6; SE, 0.7; P<.001) as well as being aged 35 years or older (eg, aged 35 to 44 years: linear regression coefficient, -7; SE, 1.4; P<.001), single (linear regression coefficient, -3 vs married; SE, 1.1; P=.003), working more hours (eg, 50 to 59 hours per week vs less than 40 hours per week: linear regression coefficient, -9; SE, 1.0; P<.001) and call nights (linear regression coefficient, -1 for each call night per week; SE, 0.2; P<.001), and being in emergency medicine (linear regression coefficient, -18; SE, 1.6, P<.001), urology (linear regression coefficient, -11; SE, 4.0; P=.009), general surgery (linear regression coefficient, -4; SE, 2.0; P=.04), anesthesiology (linear regression coefficient, -4; SE, 1.7; P=.03), or family medicine (linear regression coefficient, -3; SE, 1.4; P=.04) (reference category, internal medicine subspecialties). In interaction modeling, physician age, youngest child's age, and hours worked per week modified the associations between gender and WLI, such that the largest gender disparities were observed in physicians who were aged 45 to 54 years (estimated WLI score for women, 49; 95% CI, 47-51; estimated WLI score for men, 57, 95% CI, 55-59; P<.001), had youngest child aged 23 years or older (estimated WLI score for women, 51; 95% CI, 48-54; estimated WLI score for men, 60; 95% CI, 58-62; P<.001), and were working less than 40 hours per week (estimated WLI score for women, 61; 95% CI, 59-63; estimated WLI score for men; 70; 95% CI, 68-72; P<.001).Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that lower WLI was reported by physicians who are women, single, aged 35 years or older, and who work more hours and call nights. These findings suggest that systemic change is needed to improve WLI among physicians.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.11575\n\nView details for PubMedID 34042994\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence indicates an association between physician electronic health record (EHR) use after work hours and occupational distress including burnout. These studies are based on either physician perception of time spent in EHR through surveys which may be prone to bias or by utilizing vendor-defined EHR use measures which often rely on proprietary algorithms that may not take into account variation in physician's schedules which may underestimate time spent on the EHR outside of scheduled clinic time. The Stanford team developed and refined a nonproprietary EHR use algorithm to track the number of hours a physician spends logged into the EHR and calculates the Clinician Logged-in Outside Clinic (CLOC) time, the number of hours spent by a physician on the EHR outside of allocated time for patient care.OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to measure the association between CLOC metrics and validated measures of physician burnout and professional fulfillment.METHODS: Physicians from adult outpatient Internal Medicine, Neurology, Dermatology, Hematology, Oncology, Rheumatology, and Endocrinology departments who logged more than 8hours of scheduled clinic time per week and answered the annual wellness survey administered in Spring 2019 were included in the analysis.RESULTS: We observed a statistically significant positive correlation between CLOC ratio (defined as the ratio of CLOC time to allocated time for patient care) and work exhaustion (Pearson's r=0.14; p=0.04), but not interpersonal disengagement, burnout, or professional fulfillment.CONCLUSION: The CLOC metrics are potential objective EHR activity-based markers associated with physician work exhaustion. Our results suggest that the impact of time spent on EHR, while associated with exhaustion, does not appear to be a dominant factor driving the high rates of occupational burnout in physicians.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1055/s-0041-1731678\n\nView details for PubMedID 34261173\n\nAbstract\n\nCognitive task load can affect providers' ability to perform their job well and may contribute to burnout.The researchers evaluated whether task load, measured by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Task Load Index (TLX), correlated with burnout scores in a large national study of US physicians between October 2017 and March 2018 with a 17.1%"
