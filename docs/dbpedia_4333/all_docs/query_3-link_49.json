        "text": "The body plies are perpendicular to the bead on radial tires. On bias and bias belted tires, they are at an angle (bias) to the bead, which greatly increases sidewall strength and durability. The belt on a bias belted or radial tires improves tread stability and helps reduce rolling resistance which is the radial tires main feature. M/T’s construction sandwiches the belts between the body plies, which improves ride and virtually eliminates belt and ply separations. Sandwiched belt construction is unique to M/T tires only.\n\nThis is a question that has no real specific answer, as there are too many variables. Note: You will have to keep in mind that overall diameter of a tire will affect ABS brake systems, speedometer readings and final gear ratios. You will also have to measure side to side clearance to keep the tire away from inner fenders and other sheet metal.\n\nOur tires are not designed for street racing while they do have a softer compound than regular street tires, the street provides a sand paper like feel to the tire with rocks and dirt on the surface of the road making it hard to help with launching and hook. The drag strip provides VHT and rubber on the surface in most cases giving the softer compound an aide to help them stick to the better surface. Mickey Thompson does not produce product or condone for street racing.\n\nOverall diameter will affect the amount of growth that you will have. There are many variables that contribute to tire growth as well. Unless otherwise noted, Mickey Thompson drag slicks are considered a low growth tire. Mickey Thompson slicks will grow approximately 1 to 1-1/2 @ 150mph (Note: Radial slicks do not grow). Please phone us and we can help you in determining tire growth for your specific application.)\n\nThe advantage of a stiff sidewall is less tire wrap or sidewall distortion, thus reacting better at launch. Note: This is good for heavy cars, or cars with a suspension, that can absorb the initial launch. If you are running a fixed suspension car like a dragster or an altered, you would need the tire to absorb the launch, thus a softer sidewall. There are two ways to stiffen the sidewall. 1. Run tubes to help support the sidewall. 2. Matching the tread width with the wheel width, or going 1 wider on the wheel width, will stiffen the sidewall.\n\nAll Mickey Thompson racing tubes have an off center valve stem. Some wide wheels have a valve stem hole that is nowhere near the center of the wheel. This can make it difficult to mount your tube, if your tube is new here are some things you can try: First inflate the tube with a small amount of air to make sure the valve stem is pointing up. Secondly: Over inflate the tube (within reason) to stretch it out some. This will enable the tube to stretch and should allow the tube to fill all voids of the tire. If you should still have problems after attempting these two steps, then Mickey Thompson suggests the following: Drill another hole in the racing rim 5/8 in diameter near the center of the rim. Mickey Thompson strongly suggests you consult the rim manufacturer before doing this. Remember to clean the rim and debur the hole, we also suggest that you place duct tape over the original hole inside the rim, should you choose to do this.\n\nYes. We suggest static or Bubble balancing. Dynamic or Spin balancing, a bias ply slick will work best only if the slick does not deform. In racing the tire goes through many changes in shape. Launching, the tire wrinkles and squats. As the car goes towards the top end, the tire begins to egg shape. A static balance assures the tire is balanced around the circumference as it deforms.\n\nThis will vary from car to car. Inconsistent 60′ and 330′ times caused by tread wear or carcass break down will be your signals to change the tires. Your tires have wear indicators in the tread to give you an idea of how much rubber is left on the tire. Cars that launch hard can cause the carcass material to break down. You should inspect your tires every 30 passes. More frequently in high horsepower cars."
