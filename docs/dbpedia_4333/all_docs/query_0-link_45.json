        "text": "The following horses died at U.S. racetracks in 2023. Please note, however, that there are piles of data – dead horses, that is – not available to us: horses injured racing or training and euthanized off-site (i.e., not reportable); the too-badly-damaged euthanized after being taken in by rescues; the dead who simply fall through the cracks of apathetic or slipshod reporting to and from racing commissions.\n\nWhat’s more, not every state gives us all the information we request. Louisiana, for example, only gives us racing deaths, arguing that training and stall deaths are beyond their purview. Even worse, we currently receive nothing from the Florida Gaming Commission, with their argument being HISA collects death data now. The problem with that, of course, is that HISA is not subject to FOIA, and has heretofore not released any information on dead horses beyond a non-confirmable “fatality rate.” So, kills in Florida are now effectively being hidden. For context, though, consider that in the nine years our FOIAs were honored, we documented 850 kills in that state – or about 94 per year.\n\nMost significant, however, is that we have zero access to the horses killed at the over 200 private training facilities strewn across the land. In short, we estimate that some 2,000 racehorses perish in America every year. That’s 2,000 beautiful, intelligent, sensitive beings destroyed – for $2 bets.\n\nHorses Killed at U.S. Tracks, 2023 (R: Racing; T: Training; S: S)\n\nIn My Heart, Jan 1, Los Alamitos R – “[multiple]
