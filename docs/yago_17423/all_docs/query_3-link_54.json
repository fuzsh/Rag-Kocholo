        "text": "From “Magnets, Bitch” to the iconic pizza slinging scene – which, interestingly, was shot in one take – and every other jaw-dropping moment, Breaking Bad is undoubtedly a show for the ages. But, just like all exceptional TV series, it had to come to an end. While we’re pro for infinite reruns, we’ve also put together a list of movies that breathe the essence of Breaking Bad. Action-packed and full of suspense, this list of movies on Netflix and YouTube covers the full extent of the crime and drug world, and our favourite performances from Aaron Paul (Jesse Pinkman) and Bryan Cranston (Walter White), check it out below.\n\nHere are 7 movies on Netflix and Youtube every Breaking Bad fan would love\n\n1. El Camino – Netflix\n\nThis recommendation tops our list and if you’re a true fan then you’ll need no reason why. El Camino, which released in 2019, was a reprieve for all the Breaking Bad fans reeling from the fake rumours of a sixth season for the show. Aaron Paul reprises his role as Jesse Pinkman, as the movie explores his life after the conclusion of the show. Pinkman was seen driving off in an “El Camino” in the closing scene, and that’s where this one picks up from. If you haven’t already, this is a movie every Breaking Bad fan must watch.\n\n2. Sicario: Day of the Soldado – YouTube\n\nFollowing the life of an FBI agent, Sicario is about the dangers and difficulties involved in tracking a drug kingpin and taking him down – like that time when Walter White was being tracked. The movie, similar to Breaking Bad, also focuses on a powerful drug cartel that operates on the US and Mexico border. Featuring Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro, Josh Brolin and Victor Garber, Sicario is the perfect offering for every Breaking Bad fan craving an action-thriller.\n\n3. The Irishman – Netflix\n\nIf you fell in love with the gangster genre while watching Breaking Bad, The Irishman is the perfect fit for you. Directed by Martin Scorsese, this epic crime drama features stalwarts like Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Joe Pesci to name a few and is based on Charles Brandt’s book I Heard You Paint Houses. The movie takes us through the life of Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), as he recollects and narrates his younger days when he was a mafia hitman working for Russell Bufalino (Joe Pesci) and his crime family, and his friendship with Jimmy Hoffa (Al Pacino). It is a slightly long binge (three and a half hours), but definitely worth it.\n\n4. Collateral – YouTube\n\nCollateral, released in 2004, is probably the only film where you’d be slightly disappointed about rooting for Tom Cruise. This movie revolves around a taxi driver (Jamie Foxx) whose passenger (Cruise) is a hitman going from point to point killing the men on his hit list. Even after portraying the antagonist in the story, you can’t help but root for his escape when he is caught. Cruise’s hitlist will remind you of Gustavo Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) and his unforgiving killings.\n\n5. The Drug King – Netflix\n\nApart from Breaking Bad, The Drug King is sure to give you a flashback of Parasite too; thanks to the lead, Kang-Ho Song (Lee Do-Sam). This fast-paced South Korean crime drama, directed by Woo Min-ho, features Lee Do-Sam with Heisenberg-like energy, who starts out as a small-time narcotics dealer, but then ventures into the dark drug world and eventually sits at the peak as “The Drug King”. The movie is about his journey, and Breaking Bad fans can draw various parallels in it.\n\n6. The Infiltrator – Netflix\n\nThis one’s for all the fans invested in Bryan Cranston’s character, Walter White, and developed a liking for the actor. In The Infiltrator, however, the actor plays a role different from White, yet well engulfed in the crime and drug world. Cranston plays an undercover agent, who attempts to bring down a drug empire, by acting as a fake money launderer. The actor-centric movie also looks at the character’s issues as he struggles to cope with the dual life.\n\n7. Scarface – Netflix\n\nRepresenting the classics, Scarface, if compared to a recent pop culture show, is very similar to Breaking Bad. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) and his friend, Manny, cement a drug empire in Miami but as his business starts to grow, so does his ego; and then begins the paranoia. While his empire crumbles slowly, you will be low-key praying for all of it to stop. The OG crime drama movie encased in the drug world, Scarface is a must-watch.\n\nHere are 7 movies on Netflix and Youtube every Breaking Bad fan would love"
