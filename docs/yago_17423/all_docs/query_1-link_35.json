        "text": "Every great story deserves to be told. And that of one of the most popular places of pilgrimage in the world, along with the Vatican or Jerusalem, could not be for less.\n\nThe Camino de Santiago is the main scenario of many films and cinematographic works. And no wonder, because hundreds of thousands of pilgrims walk this pilgrimage route every year. Alone, as a couple, with friends… each one with their own motives and a story to tell.\n\nCinema is an entertaining way to learn, discover and seek inspiration. So, if you are planning to do the Camino de Santiago; if your friends have told you about the route and you want to know more about it; if you want to know what is the Camino de Santiago; if you have already lived the Camino experience in your own flesh and want to relive it; you have come to the right place.\n\nIn this list of movies about the Camino de Santiago you will find films for all tastes. For those who are looking for inspiring stories. For adventurers and dreamers. For the romantics. Those looking for a few laughs. Or those who never get scared. Get the popcorn ready and make yourself comfortable on the couch.\n\nThe movie “The Way” is probably the most acclaimed and well-known adaptation by the viewers. This is not a surprising fact, since it stars Martin Sheen, a Hollywood film legend.\n\nThe film has managed to promote the pilgrimage among the American population and The Santiago Way all over the world. It was filmed in Spain, in real Camino scenery. The viewer will enjoy in first person the landscapes and villages of Spain and Galicia along the French Way. Roncesvalles, León or Muxía, among others.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe protagonist of The Way is Tom Avery, played by acclaimed actor Martin Sheen, who is also the director’s father in real life. Tom is an ophthalmologist who receives the sad news of the death of his son while walking the Camino de Santiago. Immediately, this breaking news makes him embark on the journey that will change his life completely. The main character will travel the Camino de Santiago with the aim of resuming the pilgrimage his son could not finish. However, he will set out on a personal journey that will reflect and change his perspective on life.\n\nHailed as “deeply moving” (NOW Magazine) and “marvelous” (Globe and Mail), Strangers on the Earth explores the mental landscapes of the intrepid wayfarers who search for meaning on the paths of Europe’s most popular pilgrimage, the Camino de Santiago. One such pilgrim is Cleveland Orchestra cellist Dane Johansen, who ventures to walk the 600-mile route with his instrument on his back, performing Bach for his fellow travelers along the way. Strangers on the Earth examines the physical and spiritual aspects of the concept of ‘journey’ and the vital role it can play as part of the human experience.\n\nAt Galiwonders we had the opportunity to interviy Tristan Kook. The Director. There we go with it:\n\nWhat led you to make “Strangers on the Earth”?\n\nIn 2012, a friend by the name of Dane Johansen told me about a fabled and ancient pilgrimage in Spain that he wanted to walk (1000km!) while carrying his cello, stopping along the way to play music for his fellow pilgrims.\n\nThis, of course, was the Camino de Santiago, and the film we went on to make, Strangers on the Earth, completely outgrew our initial concept of making a film about Dane’s journey: instead we focused on the journey of the universal pilgrim, of the hundreds of thousands of people who walk this path every year and have done so since the Middle Ages.\n\nThat exceptional energy that flows westward along the Camino was something we couldn’t ignore, and it drove the entire project forward as soon as we settled on telling this universal story, as opposed to a more limited story about a specific person.\n\nThere are different movies and documentaries about the Camino de Santiago, what is special about Strangers on the Earth?\n\nIn choosing not to highlight individuals in the film and to instead focus on what makes us all similar as pilgrims (who share in common joys, struggles and crises/catharses of spirit), Strangers on the Earth is a more experiential, meditative film that places the viewer inside the head of the universal pilgrim.\n\nThe film has no onscreen interviews, thus creating the effect of hearing an internal monologue while making the pilgrimage, just as if you were alone with your thoughts halfway through a day’s walk on the Camino. We also focus on the act of pilgrimage in the modern world, and how it has changed from what it once was, both physically and spiritually.\n\nThe story of Dane Johansen, is it a real story?\n\nEvery frame of Dane’s story in the film is real, from him carrying his cello from France to Finisterre, to the fact that he would play a concert almost every night for six weeks at the end of a long day of walking (and play beautifully from memory, no less).\n\nIt was very difficult for him at times to balance his musician’s role with his role as a pilgrim, and this is captured in the film. Some people ask why he would do this seemingly crazy venture, but when you hear the music in the film (the Cello Suites of Johann Sebastian Bach), you get the sense that he was motivated by sheer love of music and in particular this very special composer.\n\nWas it difficult to film on the Camino? How long did it take to make the documentary?\n\nIn addition to the physical challenges (professional camera and sound equipment can weigh more than an average pilgrim’s backpack), shooting the film on the Camino was mostly a challenge of organization.\n\nWe always had one team on the path, consisting of a cinematographer, a camera assistant, and a sound person, while the rest of the crew would shuttle ahead to the next destination and record interviews with tired pilgrims or plan to shoot one of Dane’s concerts in an old church.\n\nKeeping track of our accommodations, researching our fellow pilgrims (the old-fashioned way: talking to them!), keeping our gear clean and tidy, giving crew members staggered rest, and downloading and organizing footage were just some of the tasks we had to perform on a daily basis.\n\nWe shot on the Camino for six weeks, traveling from Roncesvalles to Finisterre. But just like the pilgrim’s journey that doesn’t end in Santiago, nor did our film’s journey end when we finished shooting: it took about 18 months to edit (we had 100+ hours of footage), not to mention the work that goes into bringing the film to festivals and our upcoming commercial release in the US, for which we are very excited."
