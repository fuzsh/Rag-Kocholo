        "text": "FILMS OF\n\nSANTIAGO'S ROAD\n\nThe Way - 2010\n\n.\n\nThe Way is possibly the most popular Hollywood adaptation in the American country. Well, it is not that the film had a great impact, but it did manage to bite many inhabitants of the United States to travel the Camino de Santiago.\n\nThe film tells the story of Tom Avery - Martin Sheen -, a renowned ophthalmologist who receives the sad news of the death of his son Daniel in the Pyrenees. In order to travel to the place to prepare for the burial, Tom discovers that Daniel was on the Camino de Santiago, although unfortunately he did not pass the first stage. As you may already be imagining, Avery decides to complete the Route that her late son could not.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThree on the Road - 2004\n\n.\n\nDuring its almost two and a half duration, Tres en el Camino exceptionally portrays part of the essence of the Ruta Xacobea: the journey, experience and spiritual charge that it is capable of leaving people.\n\nThis Spanish / English production immerses us in the experiences of three characters: Madoka Mayuzumi, a renowned Japanese poet; Rob Jorritsna, a Dutch social worker; and Milena Salgado, Brazilian yoga teacher. All of them will look back on their experience on the Camino from the French Pyrenees to Santiago de Compostela, a route carried out by millions of pilgrims since the Middle Ages.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAt the end of the road - 2009\n\n.\n\nHumor has also not been lacking in productions based on the Camino de Santiago. This is the case of Al final del Camino, a film that in the key of a romantic comedy has two of the most fashionable actors in those years in the Spanish field: Fernando Tejero and Malena Alterio, and whom you will recognize from the popular series Aqui No There Is Who Live.\n\nNacho - Fernando Tejero - and Pilar - Malera Alterio - are photographer and journalist respectively, although with a relationship between that leads to ending worse than good. That for his boss Inma - Ana Milan - does not matter, since both will have to make a report about a supposed guru who charges 20,000 euros to solve the couple crisis by doing the Camino de Santiago. As you may already be imagining, from here on, comic and crazy situations will happen, with the occasional romantic touch. It will not be the best movie about the Ruta Xacobea, but it is quite entertaining.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFootprints: the path of your life, 2016\n\n.\n\nA documentary film about the Camino de Santiago directed by Juan Manuel Cotelo that premiered in 2016 by the production company Infinito + 1. As a curiosity, the film was bought by the giant Netflix content platform, making it available to 83 million subscribers around the world, previously released in 7 countries and having gone through many cinemas.\n\nInteresting right? Well, let's see what it is about, because this movie will surely leave you a \"mark.\"\n\nPlot: It is about a provocative invitation from a group of pilgrims from Arizona to embark on the Camino de Santiago del Norte and at the same time appear in the documentary Footprints, 12 men with their different pasts and their different lives do not hesitate to accept this challenging but unforgettable trip. They assure that it was hard that they learned to walk in life.\n\nA very deep documentary film, which makes the values ​​of the Camino very clear and explains how this Jacobean journey transforms you. Their suffering, the blisters, the joys and above all the ease of self-knowledge of each person, is like \"a kind of laboratory of life\" they assure.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nO Apostolo (The Apostle), 2012\n\n.\n\nO Apostolo is a Spanish film directed by Fernando Cortizo that was nominated in 2012 for the Goya Awards for best animated film. It was the first Stop-Motion production with plasticine made in Spain.\n\nPlot: A recently escaped prisoner tries to recover the loot that he hid a few years earlier in a remote and lonely village; but what is found there supposes a sentence worse than jail. Sinister old men, strange disappearances, spirits, a peculiar priest and even the Archpriest of Santiago himself star in a story of terror, humor and fantasy. It has the voices of Luis Tosar, Geraldine Chaplin, Manuel Manquiña, Jorge Sanz and Paul Naschy among others.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHoliness Flower, 1972\n\n.\n\nGenre / Drama film of 109 min from the 19th century.\n\nDirector: Adolfo Marsillach\n\nSynopsis: In the middle of the 19th century, an impoverished and hungry Galicia saw its already painful existence aggravated by the vicissitudes of the Carlist war. In this desolate and harsh environment, a pilgrim to whom no one gives shelter is picked up by Ádega, an adolescent shepherd, in a miserable stable. Some mystical rites make the girl believe that she is in front of a divine being. Superstition and fanaticism induce the villagers to see in him a diabolical being ...\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Milky Way, 1969\n\n.\n\nLa Vía Láctea (La Voie Lactee) is a French film directed by the Spanish director Luis Buñuel in 1969. Like many of his films, it deals with themes such as Catholicism, communism and surrealism. Using surrealism and non-linear narrative, Buñuel recounts the history of Christian heresy from the time of the Romans.\n\nSynopsis: Jean and Pierre are two pilgrims, one elderly (~ 60 years old) and the other much younger, who share a life of poverty and the desire to travel the Camino de Santiago together, to prove their faith in some case, and as a formula for survival, in addition, in a route traditionally given to the picaresque. They are beggars of perhaps doubtful morals, who meet in Parisian rue de Saint Jacques on their way to Compostela. Their disagreements began shortly after starting the march. A man dressed in a black cape tells them some very strange, unintelligible things, perhaps as God spoke to the prophet Hosea in the Bible. The stranger encourages them to take the road because if they meet a prostitute on the way, do not make them disgusted, but rather children.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nCotolay (The Boy and the Wolf), 1965\n\n.\n\nDirection: Jose Antonio Nieves Conde\n\nDuration: 108 minutes (color)\n\nSynopsis: Early 13th century.

In this task, Cotolay will help them, a Galician boy, friend of the lumberjacks of the region, intelligent, funny, almost an imp, but with a huge heart. There is no company that can resist him.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSaint-Jacques… La Mecque (Pilgrims), 2005\n\n.\n\nThe film entitled \"Peregrinos\" (Spanish version) is a romantic comedy produced in France directed by Coline Serreau.\n\nDuration : 110m.\n\nSynopsis: Three brothers receive bad news at the time of their mother's death: the only way they have to obtain the family inheritance is to make a pilgrimage on foot from Le Puy-en-Velay, in France, to Santiago de Compostela. The problem increases for two reasons, the first that none of them like to walk, the second that the three profess a deep hatred. However, greed is stronger than resentment and they decide to make the trip led by a guide, who has to lead six other people to the same destination.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nGood Way! , six pilgrims, one destination (Documentary)\n\n.\n\nIn 2013, this documentary directed and produced by the North American Lydia B. Smith was released. The film follows the story of six pilgrims of different ages, nationalities and beliefs. It tells the essence of the journey through stories of improvement, camaraderie, hospitality and a sense of humor.\n\nGood way! Six pilgrims, a destination has been recognized with a number of awards, such as the Best Documentary Award at the Camino de Santiago Film and TV festivals, Fort Lauderdale International Film Festival, Hollywood Film Festival, Mt. Hood International Film Festival and Rainier Independent Film Festival.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe Portico of Glory, 1953\n\n.\n\n92-minute black and white film directed by Rafael J.

Americano is the staging of two of the most outstanding events in our country, San Fermín and Camino de Santiago.\n\nChris will run into the party in Pamplona, ​​where he will meet the beautiful Adela. His journey through Spain will not end here, as this American will fall asleep before the charm of the Ruta Xacobea. A film that, although not bad at all thanks to its romantic and comedy touches, will make us have an entertaining time.\n\n.\n\nYOU CAN SEE IT HERE\n\n."
