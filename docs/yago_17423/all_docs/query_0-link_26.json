There are some nice mountain views (I love mountains) and like every camino has it's own character, but.... there are considerable sections of road walking: there's the long curvy road from the dam to Salame, walks literally along a busy highway up to windmills, a pretty mountain pass (nice views/strong winds) - but also substantial paved road and a long heavily traffic road into Lugo, etc.\n\nEverything is relative ; ) but it's fair to say walking a camino is not a wilderness experience (although caminos are profoundly amazing). I'm meeting more and more pilgrims these past few years recommending various GR routes in Spain - . and hope to explore these soon. For myself, sections of the Olvidado, Lebaneigo (in the beautiful Pico de Europa mountains), Sanabres and the \"over much too quick\" San Salvador stand out for areas that are especially beatutiful with some \"proper\" hiking trails.\n\nPafayac\n\nOn the way...\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nAugust-September 2024 : Norte\n\nNov 26, 2023\n\n#5\n\nIt is perhaps the Camino de San Salvador.\n\nAnamya\n\nKeeping it simple\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nFrances (2015)\n\nPortugues (2017)\n\nLebaniego (2019)\n\nNov 26, 2023\n\n#6\n\nExcept for one morning of walk by the highway, the short Camino Lebaniego is an amazing experience, and very, VERY wild if you opt for the variants.

Although it is quite short - a little under 70km - it is the most scenically dramatic and physically demanding Camino route I have walked. From sea level to sea level climbing to well over 1700+m elevation in between. Very varied in terrain and vegetation. Arid semi-desert canyons in the south, steep rocky mountains with pine forest in the centre, then green pasture hills in the north. Finishing with a stroll past banana plantations on the edge of town. Only a few short sections on sealed roads and those are largely in the final 12km. For historical reasons the church of Santiago in Gáldar has a special status as a proxy for the cathedral in Santiago.\n\nDTCamino\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino de Madrid 2023\n\nNov 26, 2023\n\n#9\n\nIf you’re looking for less concrete and more scenery I’d make a plug for the Camino de Madrid(having just finished the Madrid myself).

I have walked some of the more remote camino routes, but each one comes with its fair share of road walking. The Salvador has a lot of asphalt into Mieres and from Mieres into Oviedo, but that road walking is combined with a long stretch of mountain glory from Buiza to Pajares and beyond. The Olvidado has some of the most beautiful mountain scenery I’ve seen on a camino, and more days of beautiful mountain scenery than any other camino I’ve walked, but right after one of those jaw-dropping stages from Boñar, you have 6-8 long hard slogging kms on the side of the road. The Baztán has some glorious high hill walking, but there are stretches of road walking in between. As Quietways says, that just inevitably comes with walking village to village. “Proper” thru-hiking trails with no roads are likely to require tents/huts and way fewer services.\n\nUntraveled caminos don’t necessarily come with less road walking (e.g., Invierno, very untraveled, lots of roads). Lots of dirt paths on a camino doesn’t mean remote (e.g., Madrid, least road walking of any camino I’ve walked, but only one “remote” day from Cercedilla). Remote doesn’t mean no road walking (e.g., Olvidado or Salvador). But that’s what the camino is — going from whatever Point A you choose to the same Point B, Santiago.\n\nFor interestng historical sites, you will find them on any camino. The short Salvador, for instance, has the gorgeous pre-romanesque Santa Cristina de Lena about a two minute walk uphill from the camino, but many just walk by. For churches, the Catalán from Llançá to Montserrat was amazing, as is the Castellano-Aragonés. Also lots on the Lana. The Mozárabe and the Levante have tons and tons of castles. Lots of Roman ruins on the Vdlp, some on the Lana too. You may need to take a few detours and do some planning to work them into a walking schedule, but once you settle on a route, it’s just a matter of becoming familiar with the area and checking out what’s nearby.\n\nI think the problem is that there are too many choices, so long as you’re ok with the fact that no matter which camino you walk, you will be walking on the side of a road (most usually on the side of an untraveled road) for a chunk of the time.\n\nJerryStroebele\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino Frances Fall 2023\n\nNov 26, 2023\n\n#18\n\nCamino Mozarabe from Almeria to Granada and the Camino Aragones from Col de Somport both have very little road walking.

Caminos were intended to go from village to village and, since the 1950s, most of these paths or country roads have been paved. If you really really want to skip asphalt, the Camino Francese has got the greatest proportion gravelled. As another poster noted, walking the Camino is not a wilderness experience-- among its great virtues is an experience en profondeur of Spain (and France and Portugal) in a way unimaginable to most travellers.\n\nWhile the above posters' recommendations are all worth looking at, I would also recommend the Camino Catalan from Huesca to San Juan de Pena, and through along the Aragonese to Puenta la Reina. The Castle of Loarre is remarkable (it features in the film Gates of Heaven) & San Juan de la Pena is easily among my top ten-ever travel experiences. The latter is a time machine from a thousand years ago.\n\nThat having been said, I think that you will find the Vadiniense (from San Vicente de la Barrquera to Mansilla) might be the best for splendid and breathtaking wildness-- it is rarely traversed by pilgrims and support sparse, so plan your route carefully (note well that some of the passes are dangerous in wintertime so Pay Attention to what the locals or the Guardia tell you)--San Miguel de Escalada north of Mansilla is worth five days of lectures in showing you Visigothic Christianity.\n\nThe Castellano Aragonese has some incredible stretches, especially on the stage from Gallur to Soria, and toward Santo Domingo de Silos, and you will find them unforgettable. This is a Spain rarely encountered.\n\nward4e\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n'13-French Way\n\n'18-Via de Plata\n\n'23-Gibraltair\n\nNov 26, 2023\n\n#26\n\nI read @jungleboy ’s daily posts with gorgeous pictures of this route (not sure how to link to it).

I am hoping to walk the CF in '24. Can you suggest the best resources for these alternative routes? Walking a few extra kms is preferable to the road. I have used Gronze but maybe you have other suggestions. Thanks.\n\nI'll jump in here: The one alternative i know that is not on Gronze is the Dragonte route from Villafranca del Bierzo to Las Herrerias. Likely the most remote/untravelled of the alternatives. It does involve a fair bit of paved roads, but also some pretty wild dirt trails. However, it likely is the hardest section that one can walk on the Camino Frances due to its extreme elevation profile.\n\nSo if you are well into the Frances and find yourself looking back on the first day in the Pyrenees with fond memories of a beautiful mountain walk, i suggest you look it up. I found it a very rewarding experience, but it sure was exhausting. (And if you do it, consider pre booking in Las Herrerias. We didnt find a bed and had to continue uphill to La Faba. My Log says we walked 30,5km this day, 1520m uphill and 1130m downhill. )\n\nM2ME\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVía de la Plata ‘23\n\nLe Puy ‘25\n\nNov 27, 2023\n\n#31\n\nI'll jump in here: The one alternative i know that is not on Gronze is the Dragonte route from Villafranca del Bierzo to Las Herrerias.

I am hoping to walk the CF in '24. Can you suggest the best resources for these alternative routes? Walking a few extra kms is preferable to the road. I have used Gronze but maybe you have other suggestions. Thanks.\n\nThe Briarly guidebook includes most of the alternate trails. You might check a few other guidebooks, too.\n\nThe only alternate path I traveled not in my edition of the Briarley guidebook was the path into Burgos to avoid the industrial zone. I found this documented in this forum.\n\nAlternate paths are marked, just not a well as the main Camino path. You need to be more observant for markers.\n\nRoad walking is unavoidable in some place, but you can minimize it by choosing the alternate paths when available.\n\nAlways know where you are going and don't just follow the herd!\n\n-Paul\n\nRJM\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino's Frances, Fisterre, Portuges.

You need a good guidebook and be able to walk a few extra Kms over uneven ground.\n\nSadly, most people just follow the herd and walk alone the road.\n\n-Paul\n\nI wouldn't say there's anything sad about it. I think that it's because simply most people don't walk the Camino as a wilderness/wild/traditional backpacking experience. They walk it for other reasons. I've done my share of real backpacking and time in the wilderness and love it, but I don't walk the Camino to experience that and 90% of the time I am part of \"the herd\" and I like being part of it.

(Many pilgrims then continue with the Camino Primitivo) This Camino is more mountainous but take about 5-7 days. It was mostly dirt and the mountains ascend and descend more smoothly than many mountain hikes. It’s well marked and many get a certificate in Oviedo upon completing it. You can get the Salvador credential to be stamped from different places in Leon. The infrastructure is there but there are a few days with great distances between towns.\n\nAttachments\n\n54D245C9-39DE-4CAD-ABC3-8443AAFEC2E9.jpeg\n\nDavid Tallan\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n1989, 2016, 2018, 2023, 2024...\n\nNov 30, 2023\n\n#42\n\nThe infrastructure is there but there are a few days with great distances between towns.\n\nI guess it depends on how many days you take to walk it. I did it in 6 days this summer, with a stop in Bendueños (highly recommended!) and didn't find any days with notably great distances.\n\nBut some days you will want to phone ahead to ensure there is food and a bed waiting for you. Not because the route is so busy but because it isn't necessarily busy enough for restaurants or hospitaler@s to be preparing meals for unexpected guests and you want the albergue to be ready for you.\n\nNov 30, 2023\n\n#43\n\nThe infrastructure is there but there are a few days with great distances between towns.\n\nI disagree with that comment — Ender’s guide has many ways to break up the distances, with the longest walk being 9 days! That’s not even 15 km a day. And this guide was written before the albergue in Llanos de Somerón was up and running.\n\nI think that most of us who look back on our walks on the Salvador remember the mountain trails and spectacular views, but there is a lot of asphalt from Mieres to Oviedo, and a fair amount on the walking/bike path into Mieres.

After the latter stages of the walk into Mieres, I was really not looking forward to continuing the road walking from Mieres to Oviedo. It is all part of the package. But we had come to the Salvador from the Madrid/Frances - and did not have much time. We had the choice of walking that stage or spending the time in Oviedo, a town we love. We decided to take a morning bus from Mieres to Oviedo. I know it's anathema to some to do this, unless injured, but we did not regret our decision - and relished every moment in Oviedo.\n\nLast edited by a moderator: Nov 30, 2023\n\nJazsWay\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nOctober 2023\n\nNov 30, 2023\n\n#45\n\nI disagree with that comment — Ender’s guide has many ways to break up the distances, with the longest walk being 9 days!

I walked the Madrid in 2019 (in August, I wouldn't recommend that part), it was solitary and beautiful. I found it challenging (not always a lot of food and water), but always a place to sleep and the people were very friendly. I just finished the Camino Sanabres (September 2023). It has some paved roads (a couple of larger towns and one small City), but is also rural, quiet, and a little more obscure than I anticipated. Both the ones I've mentioned do not typically have many Pilgrims on them, and the services are sketchy at times. If you are looking for comradery, or an abundance of services, these two may not fit the bill. Also, I would have benefited greatly on both of those Caminos if my ability to speak Spanish was more conversational. If you can speak and understand Spanish fluently, these two would be fantastic. If you take the Sanabres, start in Zamora (short train from Madrid), and walk to La Granja (where it starts officially). Also, stay in Rionegro del Puente, so as not to miss \"Me Gusta Comer\", a ridiculously delicious and complex dining experience IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE (2 closed bars, 1 market-2 kilometers away, and breakfast is out of a vending machine), what is that Chef doing there!? The Madrid is almost worth doing just to get to Segovia alone. Both of these Caminos have their charms, but with MUCH wonderful nothingness in between.

Camino Ingles\n\nDec 7, 2023\n\n#60\n\nI agree completely with @Quietways. I have walked some of the more remote camino routes, but each one comes with its fair share of road walking. The Salvador has a lot of asphalt into Mieres and from Mieres into Oviedo, but that road walking is combined with a long stretch of mountain glory from Buiza to Pajares and beyond. The Olvidado has some of the most beautiful mountain scenery I’ve seen on a camino, and more days of beautiful mountain scenery than any other camino I’ve walked, but right after one of those jaw-dropping stages from Boñar, you have 6-8 long hard slogging kms on the side of the road. The Baztán has some glorious high hill walking, but there are stretches of road walking in between. As Quietways says, that just inevitably comes with walking village to village. “Proper” thru-hiking trails with no roads are likely to require tents/huts and way fewer services.\n\nUntraveled caminos don’t necessarily come with less road walking (e.g., Invierno, very untraveled, lots of roads). Lots of dirt paths on a camino doesn’t mean remote (e.g., Madrid, least road walking of any camino I’ve walked, but only one “remote” day from Cercedilla). Remote doesn’t mean no road walking (e.g., Olvidado or Salvador). But that’s what the camino is — going from whatever Point A you choose to the same Point B, Santiago.\n\nFor interestng historical sites, you will find them on any camino. The short Salvador, for instance, has the gorgeeous pre-romanesque Santa Cristina de Lena about a two minute walk uphill from the camino, but many just walk by. For churches, the Catalán from Llançá to Montserrat was amazing, as is the Castellano-Aragonés. Also lots on the Lana. The Mozárabe and the Levante have tons and tons of castles. Lots of Roman ruins on the Vdlp, some on the Lana too. You may need to take a few detours and do some planning to work them into a walking schedule, but once you settle on a route, it’s just a matter of becoming familiar with the area and checking out what’s nearby.\n\nI think the problem is that there are too many choices, so long as you’re ok with the fact that no matter which camino you walk, you will be walking on the side of a road (most usually on the side of an untraveled road) for a chunk of the time.\n\nCan anyone compare ALL the Caminos mentioned above to the Ingles.?

The route doesn't get much above 400 metres. I've walked the Ingles twice and found some fairly stiff hills like the climb out of Pontedeume but nothing I would describe as mountains. Most of the main Camino routes have sections far higher and with more difficult walking underfoot than the Ingles which is one of the least demanding paths.\n\nDTCamino\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nCamino de Madrid 2023\n\nDec 8, 2023\n\n#62\n\nCamino de Madrid on the Roman road over the pass at Fuenfria, the highest point on any Spanish Camino at 1796 meters.

Modest in height by Scottish standards - they only reach 721m - but punching above their weight visually as they rise as an steep escarpment from a flood plain only 10m above sea level. A good stiff test of the legs and lungs but no one local would ever refer to them as \"mountains\" - they were simply \"the hills\" or \"the Ochils\". The highest point in the UK is Ben Nevis which is 1,345m. People are rightly urged to treat it with respect and be well prepared when walking to the summit. Getting there is regarded as something of an achievement. But even Ben Nevis is a pimple by European mountain standards. Just over a week ago I was walking the Camino route on Gran Canaria and crossed over a mountain pass 400m higher than the summit of Ben Nevis only to find young children wandering about hand-in-hand with their parents on a Saturday morning stroll! @PProffitt asked for comparisons between the Camino Ingles and other routes being mentioned in the thread. If he/she considers the Ingles to be \"mountain walking\" then routes such as the Primitivo, the Sanabres, the Salvador or even the Camino Frances are a far more substantial challenge in that respect.\n\nPProffitt\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nSeptember 2022.

There are definitely steep hills along the way on the Ingles but most of the route is on very gently undulating terrain.

If the hill only reaches 800 m but you start at sea level, that's more than if it goes up to 1800 m but you start the climb from 1300 m. It isn't like we are in the Himalayas and reaching altitudes where the altitude itself makes a difference.\n\nVNwalking\n\nOut walking\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nVarious 2014-19\n\nVia Monastica 2022\n\nPrimitivo 2024\n\nDec 9, 2023\n\n#75\n\nVasco or Tunnel route through Basque Country\n\nLots of road walking, especially days 2-4 - but it's a fantastic camino.\n\nCanche\n\nVolcano Climber\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nNorte/Frances 2016, San Salvador & Primitivo 2021\n\nDec 15, 2023\n\n#76\n\nCheck out the Camino Primitivo.

I haven’t walked yet, I’ve almost got over there a few times. It will happen this year or next.\n\nOh - and for truly wild/less travelled routes, bring lots of money due to lack of pilgrim accommodations.

Sorry for the confusion.\n\nFor example the Camino Lebaniego Castellano from Palencia had a serious lack of accommodation options. I had a few nights outdoors. Many indoor options would have involved pricey taxi rides to tourist hotels.\n\nAttachments\n\nScreenshot 2023-12-15 at 3.32.56 PM.png"
