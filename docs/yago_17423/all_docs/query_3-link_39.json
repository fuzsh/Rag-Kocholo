        "text": "Alot of off and on down time has me watching my Name is Earl.\n\nLooking up the 1973 El camino it seems to be only one car used but I kinda doubt it??\n\nIt's badged as a 454 but when you look at the Mecum pic's it sure looks like a small block.\n\nThe doors on the tv show have SS emblems on them but not on this for sale car. Theres also alot more wear and tear..\n\nCuriousity has me thinking how many cars were used but this car really never was put through the ringer.\n\nAlso why in the world do Chevys from the day have the AC compressor on the driver side with the hoses running across the whole front to the passenger side then bent toward the fire wall??\n\nCouldn't they just of cast the bracket threads on the right side heads?\n\nThey probably had more than one of the same el camino for the shoot. Though it wasn't Dukes of Hazzard, I can't see them having that many extras. Wouldn't surprise me if it wasn't a 454. It was a tv comedy and not a collector car show. Close enough is often good enough for tv.\n\nWow, that car needed some work, looks like they kept it going by little repairs at a time.\n\nThe engine doesn't look right to me, even in 1973 I thought the BBC had those big wide valve covers which doesn't look like it in the pics?\n\nYeah the show just seemed to stop. I think corporate greed like usual was the reason.\n\nThe same producer's had that little knock off show \"Raising Hope\" for a while.\n\nLook at Ethen Suplee \"Randy\" now, he is muscular now, it's un believable, still needs some skin tightening surgery but he was 500 pounds at some point.\n\nHe was that good as Pro skateboarder huh?\n\nJaime Pressly. OMG!!!! You are not kidding\n\nI think she made her first appearance on Earl on the 2nd episode when she ransacked his room looking for his lottery money.\n\nTry looking up the 2nd show and refresh yourself to just how hot she was and still is. She can act too\n\nShe was actually a calendar model before she was famous for a bunch of motorcycle calendars in the late 90s which is how I was \"introduced\" to her. Had them hanging in the shop I worked at in high school. One of my all time crushes.\n\nShe also posed for Play Boy..\n\nShe is a real blond\n\nThat pic of Jason Lee sure looks like he can skate.\n\nHe just seemed on the tall for a skate boarder? but I don't know much about the sport..\n\nThat engine bay sure looks like a small block. Maby the valves covers are throwing me off or its a replacement big block."
