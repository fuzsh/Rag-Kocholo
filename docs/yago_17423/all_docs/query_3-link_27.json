For those unfamiliar, the movie tracks 17-year-old Paul Bäumer (Kammerer), who is compelled to enlist to serve in the Imperial German Army for the First World War. He enters the battlefield with a mind filled with propaganda but soon realizes his dreams of being an iconic hero reached too far.

While Baumbach has fared well in fractured family tales before, this film stands out for deftly telling both sides of the chaotic divorce at its core. Of course, that would mean little without strong acting, and the leading performances of Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver make the emotional trauma real for all watching. In short: watch to understand the meme of the film's stars arguing, keep watching to engage with one of the best Netflix movies.\n\nGenre: Romantic drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nStars: Adam Driver, Scarlett Johansson, Laura Dern\n\nDirector: Noah Baumbach\n\nWatch now\n\nThe Irishman (2019)\n\nForget all of the Scorsese vs comic book movies debate, the only drama you need to know about in this conversation is how good the famed director's latest film, The Irishman, is. One of the best movies on Netflix is long enough to be broken into 4 digestible 'episodes' that are about 52 minutes each. And this crime thriller utilizes each and every moment to build suspenseful situations for Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Al Pacino, with the latter portraying Jimmy Hoffa, a good friend of De Niro's character.\n\nGenre: Crime drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nStars: Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese\n\nWatch now\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)\n\nBreaking Bad fans have had it good. First, they got a prequel in the series Better Call Saul. Then, they got a sequel in this one-off movie, which follows Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) after the events of the Breaking Bad series finale. Last we saw Jesse, he was driving off after being held captive. But breaking free is just the first step in a fraught journey for Jesse, who has to figure out how to leave his life behind and start over. Does this movie need to exist? No, but it's deeply satisfying to hang out with Jesse again and to see so many Breaking Bad cameos.\n\nGenre: Crime/Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\n\nStars: Aaron Paul, Jesse Plemons, Bryan Cranston\n\nDirector: Vince Gilligan\n\nWatch now\n\nThe Power of the Dog (2021)\n\nAn adaptation of Thomas Savage's novel of the same name, The Power of The Dog is another film that Netflix can use to say \"we're not all Adam Sandler comedies and big action movies.\" An intense western set in 1925 Montana, the film is focused on two ranch-owning brothers: Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George (Jesse Plemons). George marries Rose (Kirsten Dunst) who has sent her son Peter (Kodi Smith-McPhee) to college to study medicine.\n\nUnfortunately, Phil's the mean-spirited and cruel type, and he loves to be meant to Rose and Peter. Stellar performances from the whole cast are heightened by the film's gorgeous beauty and a phenomenal score from Johny Greenwood (whose also composed for The Phantom Thread, among others). It's one of Netflix's latest Oscar-nominated movies.\n\nGenre: Western/Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 96%\n\nStars: Benedict Cumberbatch, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Kodi Smit-McPhee\n\nDirector: Jane Campion\n\nWatch now\n\nRoma (2018)\n\nThis beautifully-shot black-and-white film gives director Alfonso Cuarón a chance to show a slice of his past. Taking place in Mexico City in the early 1970s, Roma focuses on an indigenous woman who serves a white family, as they all fight to survive calamity after calamity. From betrayals to natural disasters, Roma throws the kitchen sink at this family, and then tacks on the Corpus Christi Massacre of 1971. Emotionally harrowing, this Academy Award-nominated film (and one of the best dramas on Netflix) demands you watch with tissues or some other coping mechanism.\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 96%\n\nStars: Yalitza Aparicio, Marina de Tavira\n\nDirector: Alfonso Cuaron\n\nWatch now\n\nMudbound (2017)\n\nBlack soldiers have fought alongside white soldiers for America in many wars, but come home only to find they have to fight for their lives in a different way. That's the message of Dee Rees' powerful drama, set after World War II. White soldier Jamie McAllen (Garrett Hedlund) and black soldier Ronsel Jackson (Jason Mitchell) return to their small Mississippi town. Jamie's brother owns a struggling farm, where Ronsel's parents work as tenants. The two former soldiers begin to build a friendship, but the racist attitudes of Jamie's family and the community lead to a devastating confrontation.\n\nGenre: Historical drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 97%\n\nStars: Carey Mulligan, Jason Clarke, Mary J. Blige\n\nDirector: Dee Rees\n\nWatch now\n\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018)\n\nThe Coen Brothers do it again, with a sumptuous short story slab of Western storytelling. Starring a whole host of A-list actors, and James Franco, the anthology has been nominated for three Academy awards and is a movie that wriggles through both comedy and blood-speckled violence seamlessly. Yes, it’s a satire on Westerns, and yes there’s plenty of Coen-esque characters involved, but beneath the pastiche this is a love letter that tips a cowboy hat to the movies of old.— Marc Chacksfield\n\nGenre: Western drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\n\nStars: Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco, Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan\n\nDirector: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen\n\nWatch now\n\nTigertail (2020)\n\nA delicate, elegant love story that spans continents and decades, Tigertail comes from writer/director Alan Yang, an Emmy winner and co-creator of Master of None. Pin-Jui is a poor young man from Huwei (\"tiger tail\") who falls for a wealthy girl, Yuan Lee, but ends up losing touch with her. Pin-Jui jumps on an opportunity to go to America, but years of grueling work leave him a shell of himself and unable to connect with his daughter. When a chance to revisit the past comes along, he takes it, hoping to change his life into the one he always wanted.\n\nGenre: Drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 79%\n\nStars: Hong-Chi Lee, Tzi Ma, Christine Ko\n\nDirector: Alan Yang\n\nWatch now\n\nBeasts of No Nation (2015)\n\nCary Joji Fukunaga directed Beasts of No Nation: a wartime drama based on the 2005 novel by Uzodinma Iweala. In a fictional African country, a war breaks out, which separates the young Agu (Abraham Attah) from his family. Now, he must navigate the war-torn country, evading hostile militia forces and coming face-to-face with senseless violence. This one's not just one of the best movies on Netflix but an original to boot.\n\nGenre: War drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 92%\n\nStars: Idris Elba, Abraham Attah\n\nDirector: Cary Joji Fukunaga\n\nWatch now\n\nThe Trial of the Chicago 7 (2020)\n\nWriter/director Aaron Sorkin brings his signature rapid-fire, sharp and witty dialogue to this story of the 1969 trial of seven people charged by the federal government with conspiracy and more, arising from the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The star-studded cast is more than up to the task of delivering Sorkin's words.\n\nGenre: Historical drama\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 91%\n\nStars: Eddie Redmayne, Sacha Baron Cohen, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Jeremy Strong\n\nDirector: Aaron Sorkin\n\nWatch now\n\nDa 5 Bloods (2020)\n\nSpike Lee's newest joint wasn't intended to be so timely, but then again, the director has always been ahead of his time in speaking to the truths that underpin our society. The story follows four African-American Vietnam veterans who reunite in Ho Chi Minh to retrieve the remains of their fallen squad leader Stormin' Norman (the late Chadwick Boseman).

In fact, I think you should see this film on Netflix, rather than spend time and money to see Benoit Blanc's latest mystery in theaters. This sequel finds the southern sleuth on a private island in Greece where a wealthy tech mogul is pretending to get killed to set up a murder mystery for his friends, a group of influencers who call themselves disruptors.

It all starts when an evil colonialist steals a girl after tricking her family into a \"sale\" they didn't know was happening.
