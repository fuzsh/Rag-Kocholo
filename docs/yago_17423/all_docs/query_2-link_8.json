        "text": "The final moments of I Saw the TV Glow hit like a gut punch. Sweet, anxious Owen (Justice Smith) emits an existential wail while facilitating a kid’s birthday party, after which he stumbles into a bathroom. Peering into the mirror, he slices open his chest to reveal the blue light of a TV screen. Then he seals himself back up and staggers through the noisy arcade where he works, apologizing over and over. But the customers can’t hear his sorries; they don’t even return his gaze. With a jolt, the movie fades to black.\n\nOn my first viewing of I Saw the TV Glow, I left the theater in a daze, shattered by the bleakness of Owen’s isolation. But director Jane Schoenbrun sees it through a slightly more optimistic lens—a humorous one, even. “His first instinct is to just close himself back up, button up his shirt, and go back to apologize to everyone for making a scene,” Schoenbrun says of Owen’s meltdown. “It’s almost funny. It’s sort of absurd.”\n\nSchoenbrun, who uses they/them pronouns, devised the film as a metaphor for gender dysphoria; to embrace the TV’s glow is to actualize one’s true identity, which Owen’s friend Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine) does via The Pink Opaque—the Buffy the Vampire Slayer analogue that galvanized the pair’s relationship and gave them a way to disassociate from their adolescent troubles. After years away, she returns with a new name, a new look, and a petition for Owen to join her, including a sidewalk-chalk message declaring that “there is still time.” She knows their narrow-minded suburban hometown will smother him if he can’t escape like she did.\n\nMaddy has become Tara (Lindsey Jordan), one half of The Pink Opaque’s heroic duo. All Owen has to do is bury himself underground to escape Mr. Melancholy, the celestial ‘big bad’ villain who embodies the adult world’s lethal limitations. If he does, Owen will become Isabel (Helena Howard), Tara’s accomplice. If not, Owen will remain stuck in the purgatorial Midnight Realm, where he doesn’t even realize he’s been withering away. “You can’t trust anybody in your life; they’re all working for him, Mr. Melancholy,” Maddy implores. Ultimately, Owen is too scared to find out if she’s right.\n\nThe physical connection Maddy forms with The Pink Opaque after fleeing suburbia is her way of affirming her queerness, harkening back to what she told Owen when they hung out in her basement for the first time: “Sometimes The Pink Opaque feels more real than real life.” Schoenbrun treats that fusion as more than just a metaphor. At the end of the film, Owen has “seen something he can’t unsee,” they say, referring to the TV that’s still radiating inside him. “What’s he going to do with that? For me, you imagine people who are maybe figuring out that they’re trans watching this movie, and it’s literally true that if you’re seeing this message, ‘There is still time,’ then there is still time and you haven’t suffocated to death.”\n\nWhile writing the script, the director considered a rosier conclusion in which Owen works up the courage to bury himself within The Pink Opaque—to acknowledge his purest self, no matter the cost. But that route felt too Hallmark for Schoenbrun. When Owen rewatches the Pink Opaque pilot on streaming for the first time in years, the series seems cheesier and more lo-fi than he’d remembered. He’s not sure how he found it so seductive in the first place. Owen can’t see the show’s value anymore because he’s too far removed from the bliss it brought him. He’s submerged his personal expression—and his kinship with the media that defined his youth—beneath the cloak of cisgender normativity. (“It was time for me to become a man, a real adult, a productive member of society,” he says in voice-over near the end of the movie.) Giving Owen some sort of lucid third-act awakening would have been the easy way out.\n\n“Anytime I get to an ending that feels tilted too much toward a happy-ending or sad-ending extreme, I start to feel like I’m not doing my job,” says Schoenbrun, who also made 2022’s We’re All Going to the World’s Fair. “The things my movies are about are too emotionally complex and ambivalent to fall into that comforting, American, linear narrative—like, ‘The character started with a problem and then the problem got solved.’ Transition leaves you traumatized for the rest of your life. Trans people will be unpacking pretransition for as long as they live, as well as many other things out of their control. If the movie is giving you a feeling at the end of emancipation or transcendence, that’s a lie—and then I start to feel gross as an artist.”\n\nI Saw the TV Glow derives its enigmatic tenor from the blurring of fiction and reality, of life onscreen and off. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy (Judy Garland) goes over the rainbow and into Oz, a separate domain where she learns to appreciate her humble life in Kansas. In Mulholland Drive, Rita (Laura Harring) unlocks the blue box and ends the fantasy Diane (Naomi Watts) had created to avoid her demons. In their own film, Schoenbrun wanted the disparity between one universe (the “real world”) and another (the show) to be more slippery. There’s no rug pull, no singular M. Night Shyamalan twist, no clear-cut binary. Maddy delivers her overture to Owen at the Double Lunch, the concert venue from The Pink Opaque, while Phoebe Bridgers and Sloppy Jane’s Haley Dahl perform an ambient song that contains the lyrics “I think I was born wanting more.” Double Lunch is TV Glow’s answer to Mulholland Drive’s Club Silencio, a bridge between the real and the surreal.\n\n“Reality shifting under your feet is very core to my life,” Schoenbrun says. “That’s kind of what being alive feels like to me. It’s more ephemeral, and much more of a slow crawl. Hollywood has trained us to think about narrative benchmarks, and I think in this film, the idea was that everything was sort of real and everything was also sort of ’90s television, including Owen and Maddy. It’s this Möbius strip or paradox that collapses on itself. It’s more interested in complicating your understanding of these things.”\n\nWhile completing the edit and screening the film at festivals like Sundance and South by Southwest, Schoenbrun realized their interpretation of the ending was “simpler and more peaceful” than others’. Even though Owen doesn’t relinquish his shame in those final moments, he has confirmed that The Pink Opaque is still accessible. Slicing himself open might resemble an act of Cronenbergian mutilation, but it’s actually his potential salvation.\n\n“People don’t want to watch the film in such a simple frame of mind, but it’s like, ‘Bro, 100% bury yourself underground,’” Schoenbrun says. “Hopefully it works on both levels, but there’s not supposed to be much ambiguity about the need for the character to escape—and not just emotionally, but he is quite literally in the Midnight Realm. So when he opens himself up at the end of the movie and sees this glowing TV static, [we realize that] the ‘big bad’ tricked him into this life where he’s suffocating. The ending says something about the mentality where we, as queer people, and especially as trans people, were taught from the youngest age to think of our true selves as inconveniences to everyone around us, or as something to protect the world from. I think it’s a very understandable reaction, to close yourself back up and apologize for existing.”"
