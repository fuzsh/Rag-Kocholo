        "text": "Vicente Aranda, who has died aged 88, was a Spanish film maker described by one critic as “an incorrigible erotomaniac”.\n\nAranda was a late starter, directing his first film in middle age. He emerged during the 1960s as a key member of the Barcelona School of Film, a group of Catalan avant-garde directors who eschewed realism for the more free-form cinema of the French New Wave. Aranda’s Fata Morgana (“Left-Handed Fate”, 1965) is one of their defining feature films: a kitsch science-fiction fable drawing on Pop Art and comic book aesthetics.\n\nInternationally Aranda was best known for Amantes (“Lovers”, 1991), a film noir set in 1950s Madrid, centred on a love triangle between a young man (played by Jorge Sanz), his fiancée and a slightly older woman. Aranda cast his longtime collaborator Victoria Abril in the role of the temptress; he made 12 films with her. Based on a case that happened in Northern Spain in the late 1940s, the story was a hot-blooded mixture of lust and murder. Even by contemporary standards it was shocking .The film won Goya awards (the Spanish Oscars) for best director and best film.\n\nVicente Aranda Ezquerra was born into a poor and sprawling family on November 9 1926 in Barcelona. His father, an itinerant photographer, died when Vicente was seven. The family was Republican and Vicente’s early years were shaped by the upheavals of the Spanish Civil War. His mother shuttled her children from Barcelona to the village of Penalba in Aragon and then, with the front line encroaching, back to the city.\n\nAranda’s love of the cinema began after the war, when as a teenager he spent much of his time in the shell-pocked movie houses of Barcelona. His disapproving mother would smell his clothes to detect the aroma of the cinemas’ disinfectant. He left school at 13 and worked in a variety of temporary jobs before political oppression towards families loyal to the Republican cause drove him to emigrate to Venezuela in 1952. There he worked for the NCR Corporation, an American electronics company.\n\nBy the time he returned to Spain several years later he was wealthy and married. His politics had not changed, however. In the late 1950s he toured southern Spain, providing photographs of the poverty-ridden region for the writer Juan Goytisolo .\n\nAranda’s initial plan was to write novels but he was soon drawn to film-making. An autodidact – he was rejected by the Madrid School of Cinema – he self-financed his debut, Brillante Porvenir (“Promising Future”, co-directed by Román Gubern) in 1964.\n\nThe film, loosely inspired by The Great Gatsby, flopped. Aranda turned to experimental cinema and, with directors such as Jaime Camino and Gonzalo Suárez, founded the School of Barcelona. Following the huge success of Fata Morgana, Aranda took on projects that embraced comedy, eroticism and even vampirism (The Blood Spattered Bride, 1972). Working during the Franco dictatorship was an exercise in compromise. “We had lived in a state of consensus and this is fatal for cinema,” Aranda said. “We have become our own censors and all we want to do is forget, be silent, not speak.” After Franco’s death he dealt with the troubled years of transition with the detective story Asesinato en el Comité Central (“Murder in the Central Committee”, 1982).\n\nAranda often turned to Spanish literature for inspiration; his Carmen (2003) returned to Prosper Mérimée’s original novella for its source. The shadow of the Spanish Civil War loomed over much of his work. In Libertarias (1996), another box office success, a nun flees her convent as war breaks out, finding refuge in a brothel .\n\nAmantes, Intruso (“Intruder”, 1993) and Celos (“Jealousy”, 1999) formed a trilogy on the theme of the love triangle. His later films include the erotic thriller Canciones de Amor en Lolita’s Club (2007) and Luna Caliente (his final film, in 2009).\n\nAranda married twice. His second wife, Teresa Font, was his long-standing editor. She survives him along with their two daughters."
