        "meta_description": "Un instante en la vida ajena/A Glimpse of Other Lives, directed by José Luis López-Linares as an 80-minute documentary, chronicles the cosmopolitan modernity of the Catalan upper classes. The Madronita Andreu film also invites the spectator to reflect at the direct evidence of the Civil War and postwar hardship and repression. Documentary cinema in Spain, nearly dormant during the years of the Franco dictatorship when non-fiction filmmaking fell under the control of the organism created to produce the official newsreel, the NO-DO, has seen a rebirth that has accelerated since the year 2000. Any analysis of A Glimpse must take into account the growing attention being paid to domestic cinema as a genre. While no doubt falling short of the profound sense of historical irony generated by the work of Péter Forgács, A Glimpse also carries its own melancholy awareness of the mortality of individuals and nations.",
