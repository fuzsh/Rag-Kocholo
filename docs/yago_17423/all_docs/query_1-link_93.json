        "text": "The Homing Season\n\nLeonardo Kocking’s film from Chile, La Estacion del Regreso, concerns a woman whose husband is abducted and who, while trying to find him, resumes a relationship with an old boyfriend. With Maria Erica Ramos and Alejandro Cohen (1987).\n\nThe Bodyguard\n\nR • 1 hour 28 min\n\nThe Ballad of Ari Verderchi\n\nEitan Londner wrote and directed this 2001 slice-of-life drama about a pregnant teen runaway in Tel Aviv (Olga Getmanski) who strikes up a friendship with a slow-witted bike messenger (Tzachi Hanan). The first half follows the girl’s seduction into the druggy rock scene, the second her rescue by the messenger, who’s mocked by passersby because […]\n\nJour de Fete\n\nJacques Tati’s first feature (1947), a euphoric comedy set in a sleepy village. As in all of his features, the plot is minimal: during Bastille Day festivities, the local postman (Tati) encounters a newsreel about streamlined postal delivery in America and attempts to clean up his act accordingly. But the exquisite charm of this masterpiece […]\n\nThe Deal\n\nA locally produced feature directed by Vito Brancato about a “low level mobster tangled in a deadly web of corrupt Chicago cops, the FBI, and organized crime.”\n\nThe Kingdom\n\nI’m tempted to call this 279-minute 1994 Danish miniseries by Lars von Trier (Breaking the Waves) a Scandinavian Twin Peaks, but that would be a serious injustice to David Lynch. The arch, smart-ass humor of this supernatural soap opera set in an allegorical hospital tends to be a lot less droll (though it has its […]\n\nTestamento\n\nA lusty Cape Verde entrepreneur and confirmed bachelor dies, leaving everything, including an audiotape memoir, to his daughter, who’d known him only as her benefactor. She listens to the recording in contrived increments, learning more about her father as we’re shown flashbacks set in the late 1920s to the mid-80s and accompanied by his self-important […]\n\nButterfly\n\nFrom 1997 until 1999 Julia Butterfly Hill lived on a six-by-eight-foot platform in a 1,000-year-old redwood in a forest owned by Pacific Lumber. Her complex relationship to Earth First!, whose members supported her effort, and to the primary goal of her action—to protect the tree if not the forest from being felled—is masterfully and subtly […]\n\nWho’s That Knocking at My Door?\n\nMartin Scorsese’s first feature (1968), set in New York’s Little Italy and starring Harvey Keitel in his first role, can be read as a rather rough draft of Mean Streets, down to the use of rock music and Catholic guilt. With Zina Bethune and Anne Collette. 90 min.\n\nThe Swimmer\n\n1981\n\nSweet Dreams\n\nThe life and hard times of country singer Patsy Cline, divided into two easy-to-digest sections: an hour of bright, irresistible romantic comedy (as Patsy meets and marries her freewheeling second husband) followed by an hour of glum, masochistic melodrama (as the freewheeling turns to alcoholism, violence, and abandonment). Director Karel Reisz (The French Lieutenant’s Woman) […]\n\nThe Final Solution\n\nA 1985 documentary about the Holocaust produced by Arthur Cohn, who will be present at the screening.\n\nOutskirts\n\nA handful of farmers in the Urals band together to hunt down, torture, and murder the men who took their ancestral land, pursuing their exploiters upward through a chain of command and forward in time through a compressed political history of the region. In this nuanced black-and-white parody of cinematic styles and techniques, the horrifying […]\n\nOpen from Six to Midnight\n\nTwo bored spinsters give dance lessons every night in their home until someone named Julio comes into their life. Victor Dinenzon directed this Argentinean feature.\n\nMasks\n\nA journalist and detective novelist (Robin Renucci) is hired to ghostwrite the memoirs of a famous TV-game-show host (Philippe Noiret) in a Hitchcockian thriller and guessing game devised by Claude Chabrol, working with coscreenwriter Odile Barski. This isn’t up to the level of Chabrol’s slightly earlier Poulet au vinaigre, but Chabrol fans should still beat […]\n\nRegeneration\n\nThis recently rediscovered silent was one of the 16 features directed by Raoul Walsh the first year (1915) he stepped behind the camera. No one seems to know what it’s about, but the stars are Rockliffe Fellows, Maggie Weston, and John McCann.\n\nThree Comrades\n\nErich Maria Remarque’s novel of post-World War I Germany was filmed in 1938 by Frank Borzage. Though it’s one of Borzage’s best-known films, the higher flights of his romantic sensibility seem cramped by the bright and glossy MGM house style. Against a background of loss and defeat, Borzage spins themes of emotional permanence: things vanish, […]\n\nFear\n\nSee Critic’s Choice.\n\nCrime and Punishment\n\nLev Kulidjanov’s 220-minute adaptation of the Dostoyevski novel, with Georgi Taratorkin as Raskolnikov, Innokenti Smoktunovsky as Inspector Porfiri, and Tatyana Bedova as Sonia. Shot in black and white (1970).\n\nGrowing Up\n\n1 hour 40 min • 1983\n\nTropic of Cancer\n\nJoseph Strick botches yet another major literary work (after reducing Ulysses to cinematic mush and thoroughly draining Genet’s The Balcony of any coherence). Updating Henry Miller’s classic of sexual ecstasy, love of art, and prewar Parisian high jinks, and casting the fine but totally inappropriate Rip Torn as a smirking, not visibly talented Miller, Strick […]\n\nWorking Girls\n\n1 hour 31 min • 1991\n\nTolerance\n\nA Hungarian feature by Pal Erdoss (The Princess) about the social difficulties of a jack-of-all-trades and model-ship builder who is arrested for stealing (1986).\n\nThe Best of Times\n\nRobin Williams as a middle-aged failure who convinces an old high school football teammate (Kurt Russell) to help him relive the moment that marked his downfall—when he dropped the crucial pass in a city championship game. With Pamela Reed, Donald Moffat, M. Emmet Walsh, R.G. Armstrong, Dub Taylor, and Carl Ballantine; the director is Roger […]\n\nHumoresque\n\nBased on a Fanny Hurst story, Frank Borzage’s 1920 melodrama about Jewish ghetto life—specifically the career of a talented violinist who fights in World War I and his troubled relationship with his childhood sweetheart—has been newly restored by the UCLA Film Archive after having been thought lost for many years. Vera Gordon plays the hero’s […]"
