        "text": "\"Imagine's storytelling lens has always been about highlighting inspiring stories of human achievement – or put another way – underdog stories. And there's no better setting for underdog stories than sports.\" – Marc Gilbar, President of Imagine's Brand division speaking at a panel last week alongside Jim Rome, Angel M., Therese Andrews, Dave Easton, and Angela Michelle Ellis moderated by Michelle Beadle at Variety's + Sportico Sports and Entertainment Summit. Imagine has created iconic films and series in the worlds of football, basketball, boxing, F1 Racing, surfing, figure skating and have some exciting projects in development in baseball, golf, NASCAR, motocross and bass fishing... where should we look next?\n\n\"Imagine has always believed that great stories are all around us and the next generation of filmmakers are more likely to be discovered on social platforms than anywhere else,” said Imagine Brands, IP & Partnerships President Marc Gilbar. Placing a spotlight on these stories and their creators, we're thrilled to announce that we've partnered with Adobe and The Film Zone to create the From Minutes to Movies ShortFest! This social-first, short film festival provides an opportunity and platform for filmmakers and creators looking to cross over into longer formats. Learn more about the festival, and how to enter at fromminutestomovies.com\n\n\"The Santa Stories\", a magical collaboration between The Coca-Cola Company, Imagine Entertainment, VML, WPP and PRETTYBIRD, won a Tribeca X award! A special congrats to our directors Bryce Dallas Howard (The Note) and Steven Caple Jr. (Ho Ho Heist). For the past 3 years, Tribeca X has celebrated the best in filmmaker-brand partnerships, and we're thrilled to be recognized for blending heartfelt storytelling with Coca-Cola's iconic holiday spirit. Proud of this amazing team and we look forward to more Christmas adventures together. Marc Gilbar Islam ElDessouky Ali Brown Mike Rosen Selman Careaga Elif K.

Amazon has greenlit our Untitled Earnhardrt Documentary, a four-part series. The history of the Earnhardt family is the history of NASCAR—you can’t tell the story of one without the other—and at the center of the Earnhardt family was Dale Earnhardt Sr., the most influential figure the sport has ever known. https://lnkd.in/gUvZ9HgZ"
