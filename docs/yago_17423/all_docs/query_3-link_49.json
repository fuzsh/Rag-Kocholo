It’s difficult to find the time off and money, but I had a bit of a YOLO moment and bought my flights to Porto.\n\nI have never hiked longer than 4 hours. I have the worn-in shoes, and will be buying more gear (the pack). I will have my rough itinerary, which includes the last 100-125KM of the Portuguese coastal/Variante route. I’ll likely have a list of accommodations and sights to see, but not booked in advance (as I don’t know how long it’ll actually take me)\n\nI’ll pack light. I’ve read that it’s easier to walk in the early mornings, and do about 20-25KM a day. But I will let myself go easy and do it at a pace that my body will feel comfortable with, stopping whenever needed. I’ll take precautions for bedbugs.\n\nFor food/water, I assume there will be plenty on the road? But will bring some snacks and a water bottle.\n\nIs that good enough of a plan? I want to go with the flow. That is the point right?\n\nWhat is life like on the Camino?\n\nFourSeasons\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2013, 2016, 2019, 2024\n\nJun 12, 2023\n\n#2\n\nI’m very excited for you. Life on the Camino is grand and your plan, IMHO, is a good one. You’re going to love it.

Just kidding. It all sounds good except that make sure you really do have enough water and food to keep you going.

Your 'no plan' sounds like a great plan. And as for 'what is life like on the Camino'. You're about to find out how it is for you.

(f you like your trail runners buy a new pair of the same ones). I will be walking the variante later this year and I would just check out about the boat situation. Lots of information regarding this.\n\nMore importantly I think is your question of what the Camino is like. Lots of people have expectations and some fears which are all normal. You don't seem to have any fear. I know we must be of different generations and see much of life through different lenses. But I can tell you after walking more than 7,000 kilometers on different caminos, just like you said, \"go with the flow\". Clear your mind of expectations. All you have is the step you are taking in that moment. Let the bulls*%t of your life out, as it flows in, let it flow out. Then who knows maybe some beautiful stuff you least expect can flow into your heart, mind and spirit. Talk when you want to talk, really listen when someone you may have met for just a few minutes before wants to talk, and be silent when you need and want that too. Walk your camino and not someone else's. Keep an open head and heart and the people you need to meet may walk into your life, even if it is just for a coffee by the sea. Everyone says be mindful and purposeful. I think be mindless and purposeless, only then can what you need to see, hear, feel and say can happen. Most of all accept the rain, wind, sun, heat, cold, whatever hits you smile and say I am on the camino and I am free, what can be better than this? Finally maybe you will realize the Camino is really \"real\" life and you realize you have finally come home.\n\nginniek\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nfrances 2017\n\nJun 12, 2023\n\n#15\n\nPlease take some Portuguese with you.

For some people, their experience is enhanced by planning, and for others, they gain more from not planning. It also depends on the route you’re doing.\n\nWhenever I travel to another country, I read up some on the history and culture, especially as it relates to the places I’ll be. I learn some basic phrases in the language, and I familiarize myself with food traditions and words I’m likely to see on menus. As I learn about cultural things, I might make “plans” to be sure to eat or drink certain things when I’m in a given region.\n\nI’m on the Camino now, and I’m very glad to have gotten to see some things I wouldn’t have known about without my advance reading. (Certain sights/museums.)\n\nAnd the fact that you do any planning and advance research does NOT mean that you’re taking all the unpredictability out of it. Plenty of totally out-of-control things keep happening anyway, trust me.\n\nI think one question to ask yourself is how much you want to experience and learn about Spanish/Portuguese culture while you’re doing this. It’s possible to exist in kind of a Camino bubble, where everyone you interact with is either a pilgrim or somehow involved in the Camino-supporting apparatus. (Always eating the pilgrim menu, always staying in albergues and eating in places right on the Camino, etc.) If you also want to experience the culture of the country, some advance planning is helpful. The Camino kind of has its own culture.\n\nI haven’t done the route you’re considering, but I’d also add that although the main drag Camino might be possible with little planning, others differ. The less trafficked routes have less support, and there’s good reason to read up and not just wing it. You could get stuck with no water in dangerous heat or stretches that require a lot of exertion, for example. There aren’t always easy ways to shorten a day if you need to or there’s an emergency. On the main drag, there are always other pilgrims around, and you’re never far from a major road or bus line or taxi. And lots of places take credit cards. That’s not true on all routes, and people should plan accordingly.\n\nThere’s a balance to be struck between planning and just letting things transpire.\n\nC clearly\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost years since 2012\n\nJun 12, 2023\n\n#23\n\nThat is the point right?\n\nI wouldn't say so.

Or the ability to make do with what is available.\n\nFor food/water, I assume there will be plenty on the road? But will bring some snacks and a water bottle.\n\nDon't assume that about water.

That is the point right?\n\nThe \"point\" differs for everyone. Only you have the ability to know why you're doing this.\n\nIt's perfectly alright to not know and answer the call. Maybe you'll figure it out along the way. Maybe not.\n\nEither way, it's an experience. What you get out of it is up to you.\n\nI have developed a habit of stopping every now and then and absorbing where I am. I'll tell myself where I am, and remind myself how lucky I am. Sometimes, what I'm seeing or feeling is reason enough to be there.\n\nWhat is life like on the Camino?\n\nIt's whatever you make of it. Some people can drop right into it, others resist. Two people can walk the same way on the same day and have very different perceptions.\n\nIt really depends on you.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(And maybe come back and give an update?

Good luck and Buen Camino!\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nPortuguese\n\nJun 17, 2023\n\n#38\n\nEver since I read about the Camino de Santiago last year, I’ve wanted to do it. It’s difficult to find the time off and money, but I had a bit of a YOLO moment and bought my flights to Porto.\n\nI have never hiked longer than 4 hours. I have the worn-in shoes, and will be buying more gear (the pack). I will have my rough itinerary, which includes the last 100-125KM of the Portuguese coastal/Variante route. I’ll likely have a list of accommodations and sights to see, but not booked in advance (as I don’t know how long it’ll actually take me)\n\nI’ll pack light. I’ve read that it’s easier to walk in the early mornings, and do about 20-25KM a day. But I will let myself go easy and do it at a pace that my body will feel comfortable with, stopping whenever needed. I’ll take precautions for bedbugs.\n\nFor food/water, I assume there will be plenty on the road? But will bring some snacks and a water bottle.\n\nIs that good enough of a plan? I want to go with the flow. That is the point right?\n\nWhat is life like on the Camino?\n\nSpot on. Pilgrims are killing the Caminos by booking well in advance. No adventure. Go with the flow. Do as much as you feel like doing for the day. The spark of adventure. Not sure what YOLO means though!\n\nBuen Camino to you.\n\nDoughnutANZ\n\nKa whati te tai ka kai te tōreapango\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2019, 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 & 2028.\n\nJun 17, 2023\n\n#39\n\nNot sure what YOLO means though!\n\nIt means we all die at some point so may as well enjoy doing what I am doing now.\n\nC clearly\n\nModerator\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMost years since 2012\n\nFlatlander\n\nActive Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\n2015\n\nJun 18, 2023\n\n#41\n\nPropper Planning Prevents (Piss) Poor Performance!\n\nIf you have never walked more than 4 hours, what makes you think that you can walk longer in Spain over multiple days without injury to yourself?\n\nDo you know anything about travel skills in Europe, so you won't get pickpocketed?\n\n-Paul\n\nSince the OP hasn't been back I hope they haven't read this!\n\nThe OP probably won't need to walk much further than 4 hours per day.\n\nBy multiple days you mean about 5?\n\nDo people prepare for the Camino by walking 30 days of 30km? In a row? Do marathon runners run a marathon before running The Marathon? I don't think so.\n\nI think the skills to avoid being pickpocketed in Europe are pretty much the same as anywhere else in the world. Such a dark and scary thing to say. Far better to suggest the OP pick up a few words of Portuguese or Spanish.\n\nSome people prefer a more spontaneous approach to things. I've certainly come around to that way of thinking. It would be helpful if they weren't scared off from attempting it.\n\nLast year, I met a man who had travelled in places I can only dream of. Excited, I started a conversation. I was told how many kms he had travelled, how many meters climbed, the types and percentages of different surfaces he had travelled on. When asked him how he felt, what spoke to him of these places, he just looked at me blankly.\n\nI take the view that our head only has limited space to store things, Fill it up too much with detail and plans there is little left over experiences. Too detailed a plan leaves us ticking off boxes in a mental checklist, or worse, getting anxious when we don't get to add that tick.\n\nA few days walking in a first world country on a well serviced route with lots of company?

We had no real information, no knowledge of the forum or other information.\n\nOur plan was to plan how to get to St Jean, book the first night and then get up and head toward Santiago.\n\nAfter that it was walk...eat....sleep and then do it again the next morning. A simple plan without expectations made everything new and exciting with no let down or disappointment'\n\nIt worked great. I still use the same basic concept with the addition of GPS on the lesser traveled routes.\n\nEnjoy your adventure....you got it!\n\nWow! Well hopefully after 10+ years of additional online blogs and resources invested it’s even easier now but that’s amazing, you accomplished that!\n\nWorldwithamy\n\nNew Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nJune/July 2023\n\nJun 23, 2023\n\n#44\n\nNothing like a bit of excitement to shake things up!\n\nBuen Camino!\n\n4 hours will take you a good way towards your daily goal of 20-25 km. You have the rest of the day to make up the difference.\n\nLet's be straight here. We're talking a 125 km walk spread over several days on a popular route with lots of services. Lots of fallback options. It'll be fine.\n\nSome can do this, some can't and some can learn to do it. The trick, I have found, for spontaneous travel in strange places is not to pack any expectations.\n\nSometimes, that cold glass of water can be nicer than the finest wine vintage, that bunk under a snorer can be more like \"home\" than the fancy four poster overlooking a swimming pool.\n\nTo quote from a country song \"The days I keep my gratitude higher than my expectations I have pretty good days\".\n\nSmart.\n\nSometimes there just isn't a place to stop right when you need it. At those times it's no harm to have a few mental tricks to get you to the next rest place or the facility to see how far it is to the next rest place. Or the ability to make do with what is available.\n\nDon't assume that about water. And always carry some food. Whatever about nutrition, a bit of food can be a great mood lifter. A little food or water to share along the way is a great way to make friends!\n\nIt sounds perfect to me......... but it really depends on you!\n\nThe \"point\" differs for everyone. Only you have the ability to know why you're doing this.\n\nIt's perfectly alright to not know and answer the call. Maybe you'll figure it out along the way. Maybe not.\n\nEither way, it's an experience. What you get out of it is up to you.\n\nI have developed a habit of stopping every now and then and absorbing where I am. I'll tell myself where I am, and remind myself how lucky I am. Sometimes, what I'm seeing or feeling is reason enough to be there.\n\nIt's whatever you make of it. Some people can drop right into it, others resist. Two people can walk the same way on the same day and have very different perceptions.\n\nIt really depends on you.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(And maybe come back and give an update? Most of this forum is filled with plans, a counterpoint would be interesting to digest)\n\nThank you!

If you’ll be walking during the shoulder months - April/May or late September/October, you’ll probably need to pack a little bit more. You might need a 30L. Otherwise, if you’re walking in the summer months, you’ll pack much lighter, hence, 22L I think will work. Buen Camino"
