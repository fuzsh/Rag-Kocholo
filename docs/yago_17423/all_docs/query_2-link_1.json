He is an arrogant man with bad manners and is fired from his job after pushing the head coach during a game over a disagreement over team strategy. After driving drunk into the back of a police car, Marco is ordered to either spend two years in prison or ninety days of community service, in the form of coaching Los Amigos, a team of basketball players with disabilities. At first, Montes complains about coaching the disabled players calling them subnormales (below normal). However, as he continues to coach the team, he realizes that each of the players has a unique background and they are extremely persistent in working together and playing well.[7]\n\nMeanwhile, Marco and his wife Sonia are fighting with each other because Sonia wants a child and Marco is not ready yet. In particular, Iván, one of Marco's friends, meets Sonia at a bar and tells her that he is meeting with Marco over the weekend and that she can come to confront Marco then. Iván then proceeds to tell Marco that he is not going to go out with him in an attempt to get some alone time with Sonia because he finds her attractive. However, Marco still shows up and discusses with Sonia, they leave the bar still upset with each other. After Los Amigos's first away game, Marco realizes that it is incredibly difficult to travel with the team given their abrupt and often annoying interactions with the other people on public transportation. Marco tells Sonia about these difficulties, and she helps loan a camper van from her coworker at a sports gear shop. She then joins Marco and his team over several games and their relationship improves.\n\nIn the end, Los Amigos place second in the National Series, and Marco agrees to have a child with Sonia. As Marco leaves the Los Amigos team to go back to coaching professionally, he is thanked by all the team members for changing their lives.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film is a Películas Pendelton, Rey de Babia AIE, Morena Films, and Telefónica Studios production.[8]\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nDistributed by Universal Pictures International Spain,[9] the film was theatrically released in Spain on 6 April 2018.[10]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film is the highest-grossing Spanish language film of 2018 in Spain, with a box-office taking of €19.1 million from 3.3 million admissions.[11]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nChampions has an approval rating of 75% on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 12 reviews, and an average rating of 6.4/10.[12]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 91st Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.[13][14] The film won three Goya Awards, including Best Film,[15] Best New Actor (Jesús Vidal),[16] and Best Original Song (\"Este es el momento\", by Coque Malla).[17]\n\nThe film received five nominations for the 6th Platino Awards, including Best Ibero-American Film and Best Director.[18]\n\nYear Award Category Nominee(s) Result Ref. 2019 24th Forqué Awards Best Film Won [19][20] Best Actor Javier Gutiérrez Nominated 6th Feroz Awards Best Comedy Film Won [21] Best Director Javier Fesser Nominated Best Actor in a Film Javier Gutiérrez Nominated Best Trailer Nominated 33rd Goya Awards Best Film Won [22] Best Director Javier Fesser Nominated Best Original Screenplay Javier Fesser, David Marqués Nominated Best Actor Javier Gutiérrez Nominated Best Supporting Actor Juan Margallo Nominated Best New Actress Gloria Ramos Nominated Best New Actor Jesús Vidal Won Best Editing Javier Fesser Nominated Best Production Supervision Luis Fernández Lago Nominated Best Original Song \"Este es el momento\" by Coque Malla Won Best Sound Arman Ciudad, Charly Schmukler, Alfonso Raposo Nominated 28th Actors and Actresses Union Awards Best Film Actor in a Secondary Role Juan Margallo Won [23] 6th Platino Awards Best Ibero-American Film Nominated [24] Best Director Javier Fesser Nominated Best Screenplay David Marqués, Javier Fesser Nominated Best Actor Javier Gutiérrez Nominated Cinema and Education in Values Won\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nDocumentary\n\n[edit]\n\nA documentary called Ni distintos ni diferentes: Campeones, which tells the true stories of the protagonists of the film, premiered on November 16, 2018 in Spanish theaters.[25]\n\nSequel\n\n[edit]\n\nA sequel called Championext was released on August 18, 2023 in Spanish cinemas.[26]\n\nRemakes\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2020, shooting began for an Arabic-language remake under the same name which was released commercially on March 10, 2022 in theaters in Saudi Arabia.[27][28] On April 5, 2022, a German-language remake titled Weil wir Champions sind directed by Christoph Schnee was released.[29] On March 10, 2023, an English-language remake of the same name directed by Bobby Farrelly was released.[30][31] Aamir Khan announced an Indian cinema remake of this film,[32] and shooting will commence in February 2024.[33] It would be entitled \"Sitaare Zameen Par\".
