        "text": "Booking a film festival is about whittling. This year, the SXSW Film Festival staff received about 1,500 narrative features and 1,000 documentaries, and narrowed that down to about 150 titles. Now the Fest has announced 10 of the most eagerly awaited movies: the gory, gross, and engrossing list of Midnighters.\n\nThey're just part of today's list of films added to the Festival schedule (running March 11-19), which includes extra titles in the already announced 24 Beats Per Second, SXGlobal, and Visions categories, plus a long list of Festival Favorites (where hot titles from other gatherings get an Austin screening) and the shorts that will be scattered throughout the Fest.\n\nBut the Midnighters hold a special place in the hearts of genre fans: Especially after last year, when the team scheduled the breakout trifecta of Pod, He Never Died, and We Are Still Here. So how does SXSW producer and senior film programmer Jarod Neece attempt to top that? He doesn't, because down that path madness lies. He said, \"As a programmer, you never try to one-up yourself, because you'll kill yourself.\"\n\nAfter all, the Midnighters have a long history of putting underground titles on the map. \"Attack the Block, how do you ever get better than that? Or Cheap Thrills? Every year, it's a different batch of films we're choosing from, the world's different.\"\n\nGood news for those that aren't insomniacs: SXSW isn't restricting the genre works to the late night slot. The \"previously-announced\" list includes the creepy pasta-inspired Beware the Slender Man, while today's Festival Favorites announcement includes Sundance smash The Greasy Strangler and Operation Avalanche, a found-footage film that uses the form so delicately that Neece said he didn't even realize it was found footage for days afterwards. \"It's the evolution of a genre,\" he said.\n\nBut Neece remains proud of the Midnighter's willingness to push more buttons and go that little bit further. He said, \"There's tons of crazy stuff in the other sections, but this is the bloodiest, the craziest, the most sick and twisted, the stuff everyone wants to see.\"\n\nFew titles arrive this year with more buzz than Under the Shadow, which was Sundance's must-see horror this year. Neece noted that it's been dubbed \"The Jordanian Babadook, but that short-changes it. It's more than that.\" The supernatural terror juxtaposes the eerie presence of the djinn with the imminent terror of the Iran-Iraq War. Neece said, \"The backdrop of the film is cool and inventive, a good way to use home invasion without people, but with bombs.\"\n\nHome invasions and true crime are a motif this year, spearheaded by two SXSW alums. First, Mickey Keating (Pod) returns with his Sundance-approved slow burn Carnage Park, while Simon Rumley (Red, White and Blue) gets dusty with Johnny Frank Garrett's Last Word, which Neece called \"a Texas crime thriller, set in Amarillo on Halloween.\"\n\nThere's some real twists in the tropes, including three titles featuring differently abled protagonists. Hush features Kate Siegel as a deaf woman under siege in her own home, while the latest (and so far untitled) home invasion horror from Fede Alvarez (Evil Dead) features a blind man as the victim of a burglary that goes very awry. Then there's My Father, Die, the debut feature by director Sean Brosnan, whose father Pierce (you may have heard of him for a little character called James Bond) produced. Presumably the father-son collaboration about a young deaf boy seeking revenge on his father isn't inspired by real life but, Neece said, \"There's maybe some subtext to that.\"\n\nFor anyone looking for something a little less down to Earth, the big news is the arrival of the new 4k restoration of Don Coscarelli's surrealist screamer Phantasm (overseen by one of the latest additions to the SXSW Interactive roster, J.J. Abrams). Neece said, \"With the passing of Angus Scrimm (AKA Phantasm's nightmare inducing Tall Man), it's good to have Don here.\"\n\nAdding to the craziness is the big screen adaptation of bloody zombie manga I Am a Hero, which Neece called \"super-bloody, super-whacky and wild and fun. That's the quintessential midnight film. Have fun, drink beer, watch a lot of people get blown up.\"\n\nThe SXSW coming attractions stack also includes a couple of special events: Eagle Pennell's newly restored Last Night at the Alamo gets a chance to establish the reputation it deserved, while local cinema baiters/haters Master Pancake will join with stoner-comedy king Doug Benson for a long overdue interruption of Leprechaun 4: In Space.\n\nAnd if you're badgeless or passless, don't despair. Today's list includes three nights of free outdoor screenings, including a return screening of SXSW 2006 doc Darkon, new episodes of The Powerpuff Girls, and an unmissable night with a true movie legend. Burt Reynolds (subject of documentary spotlight title The Bandit) will intro a screening of the unmatched madness of Smokey and the Bandit.\n\nSXSW Film runs March 11-19: more info at www.sxsw.com.\n\nFollow all our coverage, including news, reviews, interviews, hints, tips, and gossip, at austinchronicle.com/sxsw.
