On the ruins he once fought, the modern city of Barcelona has sprung up. Foster goes searching for Maria, a nurse who nurtured him back to health after he was wounded in battle. Instead of finding Maria, the doctor encounters her daughter who looks just like her mother. Despite Foster's attempts, the clock of time just can't be turned back"
