        "text": "With the purport of making career in the showbusiness world, Paco : Juan Luis Galiardo and Lucia : Sonia Bruno, flee to Barcelona by driving a robbed car. After that, the same car is stolen by another thief and they are seeking unsuccessfully employments, at last she gets a job as a cover girl and he becomes a second-class actor in minor roles or as a stunt in Paella or Spaghetti Westerns shot in Almeria or Esplugas de Llobregat, Barcelona .Finally, she ends up to prostitute herself to get some money.\n\nThis is a drama made in the wake of the French Nouvelle Vague, about two young people who seeek works but things go wrong, eventually getting jobs, she as a model and he playing brief film roles or stunts in Spaghetti Westerns and even performing Rodrigo de Triana in a movie about Christopher Columbus, however, they become immersed in dark delinquency. Acceptable performances from duo starring, Juan Luis Galiardo who had a long cinematic career, however Sonia Bruno got a short career due to her marriage to known footballer Pirri, and she then disapperared of the spectacle world. Passable support cast with very brief intervention by secondaries as Luis Ciges, Sergio Mendizabal and Julieta Serrano.\n\nIt contains an atmospheric cinematography shot in semi-documentary style, showing faithfully the streets, squares, and population in a noisy Barcelona well photographed by Luis Cuadrado who's deemed to be one of the best Spanish cameramen and Carlos Saura's regular photographer . However, being extremely necessary a perfect remastering because of the film copy is worn-out. It packs a catching and choral musical score in 60s years style by Victor Capblanquet. The picture was middlingly written along with Roman Gubern and directed by Jaime Camino, being a flop at the Spanish box office . He was a good writer/director who belonged to the prestigious Barcelona school and created his own production company : Tibidabo Films . He directed various dramas and documenentary films. As he made the documentary: La vieja memoria, España otra vez that won Syndicate Spectacle Award , and his last one : Los niños de Rusia. He directed nice films about Spanish Civil war as Las largas vacaciones del 36, El Largo Invierno and Dragon Rapide about dictator Francisco Franco. And other films as El Balcon Abierto about Federico Garcia Lorca, Un Invierno en Mallorca about George Sand and Chopin in island of Mallorca, La Campanada about the adult crisis and also starred by Juan Luis Galiardo, among others . Rating 5/10. Mediocre."
