        "text": "There’s the sleepy village of Hospital de Órbigo, a jewel on the Spanish plain boasting an ancient arched bridge, where Spanish knights once jousted. Or there’s the cobbled, bric-a-brac village of El Acebo, clinging haphazardly onto the side of the highest mountain on the route.\n\nSome of the larger towns are as beautiful. León’s grace and peaceful beauty has been mentioned, but 55km later you approach the lofty, walled town of Astorga, with an expansive town square where one of Gaudí’s more whimsical creations wrestles for visual supremacy with the older, austere cathedral.\n\nBest of all was the exquisite Villafranca del Bierzo, a dazzling collection of medieval churches and cobbled streets cradled by the surrounding mountains. My heart belonged to it the moment I crossed a peak and saw it glittering in the sunset below me.\n\nThere is probably no better way to meet such a variety of people than on the Camino. Whether it’s in the extremely affordable albergues (hostels), where pilgrims carrying their credencial (pilgrim’s passport) can stay, or in the many cafés that have sprung up to service the pilgrims, almost everyone is friendly and only too delighted to exchange Camino stories or help out.\n\nAmong my travelling companions were a Portuguese doctor who had cycled from Porto, a retired NASA engineer from Texas, a young Polish priest-to-be, a gregarious Scot fuelling himself with regular beer stops, and what seemed like at least half of Canada. I had little in common with most of them except the Camino, but that was enough for long, generous-spirited and reverent conversations.\n\nWithin hours of setting off you feel yourself surrender to the Camino, becoming part of its ancient westwards flow. The stresses, deadlines and technological clutter of the modern world fall away. Many pilgrims set out with detailed itineraries, but few stick to them; a favourite expression passed between pilgrims is ‘you think you have plans for the Camino, but the Camino has plans for you’.\n\nIt was in this spirit that I found myself doing things contrary to my usual habits and instincts, such as setting off on my bike at 5am so I could cruise through forests in utter darkness and solitude, the stars dazzlingly clear and close above me. Little wonder that back when the Romans used the Camino as a trade route they called it the Milky Way.\n\nAlso out of character was my stay at the unique and irresistible Casa de los Dioses, an old barn just before Astorga that has been turned into a commune-like albergue by the generous-hearted Davide. The lack of toilet and electricity briefly horrified me. Yet it was here that I lay in a hammock as the sun set bloodily over the mountain, and herded sheep flooded the plain like a noisy and dusty sea, and I thought I might well be the happiest I’d ever been.\n\nThere was plain old luck involved, too. There were a thousand ways my bike could have gone wrong, yet I didn’t get even one puncture. And the weather was unseasonably perfect: eight days of glittering sunshine with enough cool breeze to make the ride comfortable. Still, I like to think that even if my bike had fallen apart within an hour and I’d had to walk 350km through rainstorms, I’d still have loved every moment.\n\nThere was much more to the experience than I’ve managed to capture here: the pristine tranquillity of the village of Molinaseca; explosions of colour in the fields of Galicia; the joy of swooping miles downhill at exhilarating speeds; kind strangers sharing food; joking with nuns; the jubilance of arriving at the spectacular Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela. But you’ll just have to experience it for yourself. Maybe I’ll see you there – I’m already booked to return this September.\n\nTake a trip for under £250\n\nGeneral information:\n\nAccess city: Various; León\n\nCurrency: Euro (€)\n\nLanguage: Basque, Spanish\n\nWhen to go: April-June and September are recommended for decent weather and less-crowded paths\n\nGetting there & around:\n\nA pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela can start from various cities. Jaime flew with his bicycle on a Ryanair flight to Valladolid (one way from £24; flight time 2hrs 10mins); the train from Valladolid to León costs £12.40 (www.renfe.com). He flew back from Santiago to London Stansted with Ryanair.\n\nAccommodation:\n\nThere are albergues (pilgrim hostels) all along the Camino; a bed will cost £4-8 a night, and washing and kitchen facilities are included. To stay at one you must prove you are a pilgrim (ie walking or cycling); for this you need a credencial (pilgrim passport), which should be stamped daily. For more information visit www.caminosantiagodecompostela.com.\n\nHealth & safety:\n\nDrink plenty of water; pack a sun hat and sun cream for protection. If cycling, consider padded shorts; if walking, test-drive your walking boots well before you set off.\n\nI wish I’d known…\n\nThat the weather was going to co-operate so I could have left all my jumpers and waterproofs at home"
