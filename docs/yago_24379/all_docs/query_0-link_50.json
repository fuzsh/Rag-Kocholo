        "text": "The Von Trapp Family—whose story is embellished and recounted in The Sound of Music, moved to America in 1942 and settled in Stowe, Vermont.\n\nToday their estate includes 2,500 acres and the Von Trapp Family Lodge, which is a base for skiing in the winter and hiking/mountain biking in the summer.\n\nThey also have a working farm, produce maple syrup and other commodities, and have 3 excellent restaurants, one where we had a delicious German lunch with apple strudel for dessert. We love German cuisine!\n\nIt was 46° inside our camper the morning we visited, and even colder outside, with a bone-chilling wind blowing across the hills that were alive with memories from The Sound of Music.\n\nAlan and I sat huddled outside in a circle of about twenty while enjoying a 45-minute recounting of the true tale behind the family that stars in The Sound of Music, as told by one of the Baron’s own granddaughters. The real story is much less dramatic—but I think even sweeter!\n\nThankfully, there was no Elsa Schräder to beguile Captain Von Trapp or further confuse Maria. However, the captain was twenty-five years older than Maria . . . who was just six years older than his oldest child and intent on becoming a nun, so she’d not thought of him romantically! Maria was sent from her convent for one year to tutor the captain’s daughter (also named Meria, although the names of the children were changed for the movie) who was weakened through Diptheria and scarlet fever. (Scarlet fever had killed their mother four years prior.)\n\nAt the end of the year, the kids loved Maria and conspired to persuade their father to marry her so she wouldn’t go back to the abbey. Baron Von Trapp was dubious and said, “I don’t even know if she likes me.”\n\nThe kids went immediately and asked Maria, “Do you like our father?” She said (to be kind and polite, and because he was kind and good), “Of course I like your father!” The kids conveyed this to their father, who later said, “So, we’re engaged.” Maria was dusting an expensive vase when he made that casual comment and was so shocked she dropped it and broke it into a hundred pieces!\n\nMaria had intended to go back to the abbey, so she asked Georg for permission to return and mull the matter over with her superior, Mother Abbess. He approved, but after consulting with others and praying, Maria was sent back to the Von Trapp Villa and did marry the Baron. Happily, they also had three children together, and I’m guessing she had a much more fulfilling (and busier!) life caring for her family of ten than she might have had at the abbey (where she truly was a problem!).\n\nAlthough many details were changed for dramatic and humorous effects, the family left Austria in 1938 due to the Baron’s disapproval of the Nazi regime and eventually relocated to America. They settled in Stowe but traveled throughout America and later internationally, singing songs and bringing hope to millions distraught by the horrors of war. In fact, their legacy has continued via some of their grandchildren and even great-grandchildren who recorded albums up until 2016! All this is due to Maria’s selfless commitment to serving God, who directed her to care for a family in need of a mother. Her story makes me think of Ruth, who married an older man—not for passion but for love—and blessed the world by becoming the grandmother of David and progenitor of Jesus!\n\nFeeling a lack of passion in your marriage? Remember, real love is deeper than passion. Its source is God and its results are enduring goodness. Don’t give up! God will bless you for faithfully loving Him and loving those He’s given you to care for.\n\n“You were called to freedom, brothers and sisters; only don’t let this freedom be an opportunity to indulge your selfish impulses, but serve each other through love.” (Galatians 5:13, CEB)"
