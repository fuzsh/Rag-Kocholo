        "text": "Life and facts\n\nMaria Augusta von Trapp was an Austrian singer and writer who emigrated to the United States after Austria’s connection (“Anschluss”) to the “Third Reich” and applied for American citizenship in 1944.\n\nShe was born Maria Augusta Kutschera in humble circumstances in Vienna.\n\nThe family came from the Zillertal valley in Tyrol. Her mother died a few days after her birth, and she lost her father three years later. After that she grew up with her grandmother and with a guardian.\n\nShe became a teacher and worked as an educator at the convent school of Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg and wanted to enter the order as a postulant.\n\nIn 1925, the abbess sent her as a tutor to the convalescent Maria, daughter of the famous Austrian corvette captain Georg Ludwig von Trapp. On November 26, 1927, she became the second wife of the widower Trapp, to whom she bore daughters Rosemarie and Eleonore in 1929 and 1931.\n\nThe children from his first marriage addressed her as “Mother” to distinguish her from their biological Mamá (emphasis on the second syllable).\n\nSince the family lost all its assets in 1935, she and her husband’s children (five daughters, two sons) formed a family choir.\n\nFranz Wasner, the house chaplain of the Trapp family, took over the musical direction. Already in 1937, the choir won the first prize of the folk singing competition of the Salzburg Festival.\n\nAs a monarchist-minded officer, Georg Ludwig von Trapp expected the greatest difficulties as a result of the connection of Austria to the “Third Reich” in 1938.\n\nAfter renting their property in Aigen to a religious order, the family emigrated to the USA in the same year, where Franz Wasner accompanied them.\n\nThere their son Johannes was born in 1939. The family settled in Stowe, Vermont, where they built a house called Cor Unum.\n\nThe family also made concert tours in the USA, performing mostly under the name Trapp Family Singers.\n\nThey organized a relief effort after the end of World War II under the name Trapp Family Austrian Relief Inc. and collected clothing and food for Austria.\n\nAfter the death of Georg Ludwig von Trapp in 1947, Johanna left the family choir, and later Werner († 2007) left. Martina died early, Eleonore started her own family, and Rosemarie was no longer available for tours due to stage fright.\n\nThe choir went on several tours, including South America and Australia. In 1950 Maria Augusta von Trapp performed with her choir at the Salzburg Festival. In 1956 the choir, which had given about 2000 concerts all over the world, was disbanded.\n\nThe surviving “children” still live in America on the ranch.\n\nMaria Augusta von Trapp wrote down her memoirs in 1952 under the title “From Convent to World Success”. The book was filmed in 1956 under the title The Trapp Family and in 1958 The Trapp Family in America with very great success.\n\nIn 1959, the story was brought to the stage – somewhat embellished – in the musical “The Sound of Music” and enjoyed astounding success in North America for many years.\n\nAt the age of 82, Maria Augusta von Trapp died in Morrisville on March 28, 1987. She left behind two daughters and a son."
