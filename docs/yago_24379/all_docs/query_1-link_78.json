        "text": "The Sound of Music\n\nNotes\n\nThe Nonnberg Abbey (Benedictine) in Salzburg was founded AD 714; current buildings are from the XVI century.\n\nMaria von Trapp was born Maria Augusta von Kutschera; born January 25, 1905, in Vienna; graduated from college; presented herself at Nonnberg as a candidate for the Novitiate.\n\nMarried Georg von Trapp November 26, 1927; founded family choir in early 1930s; fled Austria in 1938 to Italy, then to the United States, with 10 children; died March 28, 1987, Stowe, Vermont.\n\nGeorg Ludwig Ritter von Trapp; born April 4, 1880, in Zara (Zadar), Croatia (then part of Hungary); father a naval captain; attended naval academy at Fiume (Rijeka); married Agathe Whitehead, 1910; commanded U-boat \"U6\"; sank French sub \"Leon Gambetta\"; promoted Korvettenkapitän (Lt Cdr) in 1918; in recognition of his wartime service, he was permitted to put \"von\" in his name, and given the title Ritter (knight); Agathe died 1924, having borne him 7 children; left Austria 1938. died May 30, 1947, Stowe, Vermont.\n\nFr Wasner became family chaplain, 1935; fled Austria with them.\n\nThe Anschluss occurred March, 1938.\n\nThe original plan for this show was to use only songs sung by the Trapp family on their concert tours. That proved unsuitable, so it was decided to write entirely new songs and use no songs from their tours.\n\nA nun is a religious sister that lives in a cloister. A sister that lives in a convent, is strictly speaking, not a nun.\n\nA woman who wishes to join a community of nuns is first accepted as a postulant, in which her vocation is tested. She is not under vows. After a period of time, if she appears to have a vocation to the cloistered life, she takes temporary vows, for three to six years, and becomes a novice, and receives a habit. At the end of that period, if she is still determined to remain in the cloister, she takes solemn, permanent vows, and is now a full member of the community.\n\nTrapp Children\n\nChildren of Georg & Agathe\n\nRupert (1911-1990) practiced as a medical doctor until the mid-80s and died at the age of 80. He had six children.\n\nAgathe (1913-2010) lived near Baltimore, Maryland, and ran a kindergarten.\n\nMaria Franziska (born 1914) now lives in Stowe, Vermont, after 27 years of missionary work in New Guinea. She went back Salzburg from time to time, and every time she would not miss the \"Sound of the Music Tour\"...\n\nWerner (1915-2007) became a farmer and had six children; lived in Waitsfield, Vermont.\n\nHedwig (1917-1972) worked at the lodge until her death.\n\nJohanna (1919-1994) married in 1948 and left America to return to her homeland Austria. She lived in Vienna until her death and had six children.\n\nMartina (1921-1951) stayed with her family until she married in 1949. She died in childbirth.\n\nChildren of Georg & Maria:\n\nRosemarie (born 1929 in Salzburg) lives in Stowe, Vermont.\n\nEleonore (born 1931 in Salzburg) stopped singing in 1952, got married in 1954 and raised seven children.\n\nJohannes Georg (born 1939 in Philadelphia) graduated from Dartmouth, has a masters degree in forestry (Yale) and is now president of the Trapp Family Lodge. He has two children.\n\nIn 1941, the Trapp family bought a large farm in Vermont, in a countryside very similar to the Austrian landscape near Salzburg that they missed. The house they lived in was called Cor Unum, which means \"one heart\".\n\nMore information (and the source of much of the information above)\n\nAct I\n\nPraeludium - The Nuns\n\nThe Sound of Music - Maria\n\nHow do you solve a problem like Maria? - The Nuns\n\nMy Favorite Things - Maria and the Mother Abbess\n\nDo-Re-Mi - Maria and the Children\n\nSixteen Going On Seventeen - Rolf and Liesl\n\nThe Lonely Goatherd - Maria and the Children\n\nHow Can Love Survive - Max and Elsa\n\nThe Sound of Music (Reprise) - Maria, the Captain and the Children\n\nLändler\n\nSo Long, Farewell - The Children\n\nClimb Ev'ry Mountain - Mother Abbess\n\nAct II\n\nNo Way to Stop It - Max, the Captain and Elsa\n\nAn Ordinary Couple - Maria and the Captain\n\nProcessional - The Nuns\n\nSixteen Going On Seventeen (Reprise) - Maria and Liesl\n\nDo-Re-Mi (Reprise) - Maria, the Captain and the Children\n\nEdelweiss - The Captain, Maria and the Children\n\nSo Long, Farewell (Reprise) - Maria, the Captain and the Children\n\nFinale (Climb Ev'ry Mountain) - The Nuns"
