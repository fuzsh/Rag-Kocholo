        "text": "Have you ever watched The Sound of Music and wondered about the real von Trapp family? While the film is a classic, remember that it’s — a work of fiction in part. But don’t let that dampen your love for the movie — the true story of the von Trapp family is just as fascinating and inspiring.\n\nIn reality, the von Trapp family had a total of 10 children, and Rupert, not Liesl, was the eldest.\n\nMaria von Trapp, who was portrayed by Julie Andrews in the film, didn’t come into the von Trapp family’s life as a governess for all of the children. Instead, she was originally hired as a tutor for one of the children — a young girl named Maria who was recovering from scarlet fever.\n\nThe portrayal of Captain von Trapp, played by Christopher Plummer, as a cold-hearted patriarch who disapproves of music is far from the truth. In reality, Georg von Trapp was a warm and loving parent who enjoyed participating in musical activities with his family.\n\nThe film depicts Maria as responsible for introducing music into the von Trapp family’s life and teaching the children to sing. While Maria did play a role in the family’s musical development, the von Trapp family was already musically inclined before her arrival.\n\nThe romance between Maria and Captain von Trapp in the film is heartwarming, but the true story of their relationship is more complex. Maria was not in love with the captain when he proposed. She agreed to marry him because she loved the children.\n\nThe von Trapp family’s escape, as depicted in the film, is an iconic and dramatic scene, but the true story is a little less dramatic. Instead of hiking over mountains with suitcases and instruments, the family took a train to Italy."
