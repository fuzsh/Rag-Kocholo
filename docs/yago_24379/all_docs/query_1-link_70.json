        "text": "*In 1938, as political refugees, the family was forced to abandon their home and belongs to seek asylum in the U.S.A. After WWII, when the family received their house back during reparations, they sold it to an Order of monks. In 2008, it was leased and opened as a hotel. In the movie, ‘Villa von Trapp’ was filmed at Schloss Frohnburg, a 17th century country house, now the Mozarteum Music Academy.\n\n**Baron Captain Georg Riiter (Knight) von Trapp was elevated to Baron from Knight with his 1918 'Maria Theresa Military Order', awarded during WWI by the Austro-Hungarian Imperial & Royal War Navy; he was officially granted his title in 1924, when he submitted the proper paperwork and application. This entitled him, his wife and his descendants to carry the title Baron and Baroness.\n\n​1965 Hollywood Movie version:\n\nSimilarities- Baron Captain Georg von Trapp was a widowed, WWI Navy hero with seven children, living near Salzburg, Austria.\n\nDifferences - In the movie, his children's name's were changed, as well as the birth order of his first two children; in the movie, the eldest is Liesl von Trapp (real name Agathe von Trapp & actually the second child, eldest daughter), Friedruich von Trapp (real name Rupert von Trapp & first child, eldest son), Lousia von Trapp (Maria von Trapp), Kurt von Trapp (Werner von Trapp), Brigitta von Trapp (Hedwig von Trapp), Marta von Trapp (Johanna von Trapp) and Gretl von Trapp (Martina von Trapp). Also, a key difference was Georg's portrayal as stiff, distant and strict; in reality, his children all describe him as loving, humorous, their 'rock' in the family and highly engaged & interested in his children's lives.\n\nTutor Arrives: At the start of a new school year, Baron Captain Georg von Trapp's (1880-1947) daughter Maria (1914-2014) was suffering from heart issues connected with contracting scarlet fever five years before. The issue caused her much fatigue and made it difficult to attend school full-time. In October, Georg inquired with the Ursuline High School to see if they had any qualified students to assist; the Director recommended 'Gustl' Maria Augusta Kutschera* (1905-1987), a fifth-grade teacher at the local Nonnberg Abbey ('Gustl' is short for Augusta). Gustl had recently graduated from the State Teacher's College of Progressive Education. Georg was grateful for the recommendation and agreed to hired Gustl; she came to Villa von Trapp as a live-in school tutor for his daughter Maria.\n\n*Gustl was the basis for the \"Maria\" character in \"The Sound of Music\", which was inspired by Gustl's 1949 book, \"The Story of The Trapp Family Singers\".\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie Version:\n\nSimilarities - When Gustl arrived at Villa von Trapp, the children did ranged in age from 5 to near 16.\n\nDifferences - In the movie, the widowed Baron Captain Georg von Trapp hired Gustl's character 'Maria' as a nanny for all of his children in 1936; in real life, 'Maria' was known as Gustl (short for her middle name Augusta) and came to Villa von Trapp as a school tutor for his 3rd daughter, Maria (12), ten years earlier in 1926.\n\n​​​​Yacht Captain Request: After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.... After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.... After the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire....Although busy with his Rhein-Donau-Express shipping company [see year 1921] and at home chicken-egg farm [see year 1925], Baron Captain Georg von Trapp accepted a request by Mr. Hankey (an American) to captain and sail Mr. Hankey’s yacht from Bremerhaven, Germany to Genoa, Italy.\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie version:​ N/A - not mentioned in the movie\n\n​​Salzburg Schools & Music: The von Trapp children were now all of school age, the girls enrolled into the Ursuline convent school and the boys the local public school. When his children were home, Baron Captain Georg von Trapp (1880-1947) sang with his children, old navy songs & ballards accompanied by his guitar. He also taught his son Rupert (####-####) & daughter Maria (####-####) how to play the accordion, his daughter Agathe (####-####) the guitar and daughter Johanna (####-####) & Maria (####-####) the violin. Musical evenings were a daily occurrence practising marches and folk dances; Georg played first violin, Rupert or Maria played the accordion, Agathe accompanied with guitar, with later Johanna joining with second violin. This arrangement is called \"The Schrammel Quartet\" - a Viennes specialty.\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie version:\n\nSimilarities - Georg did play the guitar.\n\nDifferences - In the movie, Georg did not initially make music with his children; in real life, music was central to much of the time he spent with his children. He taught them songs and how to play musical instruments, as well as provided them with formal music lessons.\n\n​​Captain's Whistle:Baron Captain Georg von Trapp (1880-1947) did use a captain's whistle to call his children, with each child having a different whistle sound.\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie version:\n\nSimilarities - Georg did use a whistle to call his children; he learned the skill as a Navy Captain.\n\nDifferences - However, the whistle was used for practicality & fun, the estate they lived on was quite large and the whistle was a convenient way of calling his children when needed. Unlike the movie, his children enjoyed having their own whistle sound and saw it as a sign of affection from their loving father, the Captain.\n\nChicken-egg Farming: While still a Director for his Rhein-Donau-Express shipping company [see year 1921], Baron Captain Georg von Trapp (1880-1947) also embarked on chicken-egg farming, located on part of the Villa von Trapp property. He sold eggs to the local Salzburg hotels. It lasted for several years, ending when a chicken flu epidemic killed off most of the birds.\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie version:​ N/A - not mentioned in the movie\n\nMusic in the Mountains: The summer of 1926, Prince Karl Auersperg (####-####) and wife Priness Eleonore von Breunner (####-####)(Agathe's Uncle & Aunt), with their children, arranged a three-week camping trip for his extended family in the \"Die Nideren Tauern\" Austrian mountain range. He invited Baron Captain Georg von Trapp (1880-1947) with his four eldest children, Frank Whitehead (####-####) (Agathe's brother) with his wife & son, Countess Johanna von Auersperg (####-####) (Agathe's cousin) with her husband, Count Rudolf Meran (####-####) & their children and the Auersperg's music teacher, Mr. Mastalier. Making music played an internal part to the camping itinerary, Georg played the violin, Karl the accordion, Mr. Mastalier the guitar and all the rest participated in song. This experience had a long last effect on the von Trapp child, who when they returned to Salzburg. As his eldest daughter Agathe wrote in her autobiography \"... the music remained and became part of our repertoire. With Rupert on the accordion, Papa on the first violin, Maria on second violin and me on guitar. We made music whenever we could find time!\"\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie version:​\n\nDifferences - Georg and his 1st wife Agathe Whitehead's family introduced music, musical training and group music making to all their seven children from small on. Their eldest daughter wrote in her autobiography, \"In the play and film, it appears that our second mother was solely responsible for teaching us the joys of music. In reality, not only did we play instruments and sing with Papa in our house in Salzburg before we had even met our second mother, but we also sang very early in our lives at the [Zee am See house] during WWI, when Mama [Baroness Agathe Whitehead (1880-1922)], Gromi [Grandmother Countess Agathe von Bruenner (####-1945)] and the Aunts sang and played piano.\"\n\n1934 - Lotte Lehmann's Encouragement\n\nBy 1934 the von Trapp family had lost a large part of their wealth due to a global depression and a banking failure. Their fortune had consisted of monies inherited from the children's great-grandfather, Robert Whitehead, (from his invention of the torpedo) and the other half from Georg's successful decade-long shipping businesses on the Rhein-Danue Rivers (1919-1930). To stabilize their financial situation Georg worked on several endeavors including writing his WWI memoir, lecturing, and exploring some engineering ideas. As a result, the family was able to stay at their home in Aigen, near Salzburg, Austria, but they took on boarders to help cover expenses. In the summer of 1934 the famous German/Austrian opera singer, Lotte Lehmann, visited Villa Trapp and the family entertained her with their music. She was so impressed and touched by the family's performance that she told them, \"You have gold in your throats. You are not allowed to keep this for yourselves, you have to share your voice with people. This is something so beautiful, they will go home with filled souls.\". Georg later recalled, \"We were astonished when she seemed seriously interested. She told us we were great artists whose the world should hear. I thought she was joking.\" [October 23, 1942 The Gallup Independent, New Mexico]. It was Lotte who encouraged them to enter a local Folk Singing Competition.\n\n​​​​Born February 8:Baroness 'Illi' Rosmarie von Trapp (b.1929, eighth child, sixth daughter) born in Salzburg, Austria to parents Georg & Gustl. Later, Illi was a member of the Trapp Family Singers; however, Illi is not represented in \"The Sound of Music\"​.\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie Version:\n\nDifference - In the movie, Georg & Gustl's character 'Maria', meet, marry & leave Austria between 1936 and 1938. However in real life, Georg & Gustl meet in 1926, marry in 1927, have two children in 1929 & 1930 and leave Austria, together with all the nine children, in 1938. In order for the movie to span less years, the movie timeline is shortened and therefore, Illi is not featured in the movie.\n\nSold 2nd Shipping Company - Rhein-Donau-Express: In 1921, Baron Captain Georg von Trapp (1880-1947) founded his second merchant shipping enterprise the “Rhein-Donau-Express-Schiffahrt’s-A.G.” [1st company see year 1919, 2nd company see year 1921]. For nine years, Georg built up a successful and lucrative business, capturing so much of the Rhein and Donau shipping market that his fellow competitors bought him out.\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie Version:\n\nDifference - Since the movie version takes place between 1936-1938, Georg's success with his shipping business is not featured as it takes place between 1919-1930, after his Naval career ends in 1918 due to the aftermath of WWI [see year 1918].\n\nBorn May 14: Baroness 'Lorli' Eleonore von Trapp(b.1931 ninth child, seventh daughter) born in Salzburg, Austria to parents Georg & Gustl. Later, Lorli was a member of the Trapp Family Singers; however, Lorli is not represented in \"The Sound of Music\".\n\n​1965 Hollywood Movie Version:\n\nDifference: In the movie, Georg & Gustl's character 'Maria', meet, marry & leave Austria between 1936 and 1938. However in real life, Georg & Gustl meet in 1926, marry in 1927, have two children in 1929 & 1930 and leave Austria in 1938, together with all the nine children. In order for the movie to span less years, the movie timeline is shortened and therefore, Lorli is not featured in the movie.\n\nSpring High School Graduation & United Kingdom Trip: As a high school graduation gift, Baron Captain Georg von Trapp (1880-1947) sent his two eldest, Rupert (19) and Agathe (18), to the United Kingdom. It was to visit to their Great-uncle 'Bertie' Robert Bovil Whitehead (1867-1945)* and his wife, 'Rosie' Rosalie Emily Lecky Phelps (1872-1941). While there they, also visited their Great-aunt the Honorable Maria Cecilia Broderick (####-####); unfortunately, her husband & the von Trapps Great-Uncle 'Bede' Sir James Beethom Whitehead (1858-1928)* had passed away a few years earlier. ​*Sons to British engineer Robert Whitehead (1823-1905), the inventor of the underwater, self-propelled torpedo [see year 1905] and Uncles to their mother Agathe Whitehead (1891-1920).​\n\n1965 Hollywood Movie Version: N/A not mentioned in the movie"
