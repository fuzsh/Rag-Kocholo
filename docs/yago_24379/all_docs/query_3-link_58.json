        "text": "The Von Trapp Family\n\nThe von Trapp saga begins in 1910, when distinguished naval commander Georg von Trapp met Agathe Whitehead at a ball. Not only was it love at first sight, it was an almost royal match. Captain von Trapp was as distinguished a war commander in Austria as Eisenhower was in America following World War II. And the von Trapp-Whitehead marriage had the same mythical aura as that of the Kennedy-Bouvier union. When Agathe died, von Trapp was inconsolable. According to Johannes von Trapp, his father was as devastated by the end of his naval career as by the loss of his wife: \"My father's life was the navy.\" explained Johannes, \"He was uncomfortable doing anything else. He was simply lost.\" After the loss of their mother, the children had an endless parade of governesses. One would be hired for the older children, one for the younger, and one to run the household. But the children wanted to have just one governess, and Maria seemed to be a perfect fit. Maria married Captain Von Trapp on November 26, 1927. This is the story that has been made immortalized by the \"The Sound of Music\". When Captain von Trapp lost his fortune after the Austrian national bank folded, the children had to learn how to work, doing laundry and other household chores. They looked at their misfortune as an adventure, but their father was hit hard by the loss. This new life was abruptly halted when Hitler invaded Austria.

Not only was it love at first sight, it was an almost royal match. Captain von Trapp was as distinguished a war commander in Austria as Eisenhower was in America following World War II. And the von Trapp-Whitehead marriage had the same mythical aura as that of the Kennedy-Bouvier union. Both Georg and Agathe came from privileged families, and the von Trapps were able to live comfortably off the interest from Whitehead's inheritance. The fairy tale started to take a turn when the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I. {Hirsch] Now without a coast, Austria no longer required a navy, and the Captain lost his post. When Agathe died, von Trapp was inconsolable. According to Johannes von Trapp, his father was as devastated by the end of his naval career as by the loss of his wife: \"My father's life was the navy.\" explained Johannes, \"He was uncomfortable doing anything else. He was simply lost.\"\n\nGovernesses\n\nAfter the loss of their mother, the children had an endless parade of governesses. One would be hired for the older children, one for the younger, and one to run the household. But the children wanted to have just one governess, and Maria seemed to be a perfect fit. The children's real names were Hedwig, Agathe, Rupert, Werner, Johanna, Martina, and Maria. One observer claims that Maria the governess actually only came to really take care of Maria, who was very sick. I'm not sure if that is correct. Even before Maria arrived, introducing madrigals and other complex music, the children were musically inclined. Encouraged by the Captain, they sang all the time, and he often accompanied them on guitar, mandolin, and violin. Maria, along with Father Wasner, a neighborhood Priest, brought a sophistication to the family's singing, but according to Johannes, the Captain's naval stature helped the family forge their careers. Even before they began singing the Captain was very well known, and his name lent a certain air of importance to their group. One of the children was upset over the way her father was depicted in the movie. She says he was not the strict martinent depicted in the film and was always loving and caring. [A. von Trapp.]\n\nMaria\n\nMaria's mother died when she was two years old. Her father left her with an elderly cousin so that he could be free to travel. She experienced a lonely and very strict upbringing without any siblings or other children in the household. Maria as a youth had no religious beliefs. She was converted by a chance religious encounteted and entered a convent. Though Maria was intensely devoted to her convent, she was taken away from the outdoor activities she once thrived on. Her doctor was concerned her health was failing due to a lack of fresh air and exercise. This was when the decision was made to send Maria to the home of retired naval captain Georg von Trapp. Her position was not governess to all the children, as the movie portrayed, but specifically to the captain's daughter who was bedridden with rheumatic fever. The rest is truly history. Maria never returned to the convent.\n\nMarriage\n\nMaria married Captain Von Trapp (November 26, 1927). This is of course the story that has been made immortalized by the \"The Sound of Music\", although the film's time-line is a little off.\n\nChange of Fortune\n\nWhen Captain von Trapp lost his fortune after the Austrian national bank folded, the children had to learn how to work, doing laundry and other household chores. They looked at their misfortune as an adventure, but their father was hit hard by the loss. He had nine children to support, and no money. When the von Trapps began to earn money by singing in public, the Captain faced another conundrum. For a man in his position, earning a living on stage was considered dèclassè. But they had little choice. As the head of the family, the Captain would come out and introduce the group after they had performed a few numbers, and then at the end of the show he would come back out and take a bow. The photo of the real von Trapp children was taken in the mid-1920s, around the time Maria first came as a governness (figure 1). Their ages correspond to the look of the children. Maria and Mr. von Trapp were married about 1928 and their first child, Rosemarie, was born a couple years later. When they were performing in Austria, prior to World War II, most of the \"children\" were young adults. Maria von Trapp in her autobiography mentions that people returned to traditional wear after World War I because of a clothing shortage.\n\nThe NAZIs\n\nThis new life was abruptly halted when Hitler invaded Austria as part of the Anschluss (March 1938). [Hirsch] Many Austrians were estatic. Captain von Trapp was not. He had met Hitler and thought him crude and vulgar. He brought his family together and said, \"We are standing at the open grave of Austria.\" He asked them if they wanted to stay or to leave. Despite the hardships sure to face them, they had no moral choice but to depart. Although it was a terrible blow to leave their home and all their belongings behind, when they learned that Himmler himself had taken over their house, their grief was almost unbearable. The movie we are all familiar with only hinted at the terrifying struggle that lay ahead of the Trapp Family. In 1938 The Trapp family left their belongings, friends and home to escape Hitler's reign. Maria was pregnant with their tenth child, Johannes, now president of the Trapp Family Lodge. We are not entirely sure about how they left Austria. One account describes a departure similar to the one depicted in the movie. In order to avoid suspicion, the family appeared to be going on one of their frequent mountain hikes, and left only with the packs on their backs. Accompanied by the family priest, Monsignor Franz Wagner, they climbed over the Austrian Alps into a tiny mountain village in Italy and never turned back. Here the movie ends as a result, most people are less familiar with the rest of the Trapp family saga. One of the children recalls simply getting on a train. [A. von Trapp.]\n\nAmerica\n\nThe von Trapps arrived in America in 1938, just before war broke out in Europe. They had virtually no money and set out to make their living through performing. They spent the next 18 years on the road. Because they traveled so much, the children basically had to put their personal lives on hold. Every time they made a stop during a tour, Maria made all of the family visit a nunnery. A strong figure, Maria would not hear of any of the children leaving the family to strike out on their own, even after some married and had families. She also seemed torn between what she thought God wanted her to do and what she felt to be most important--which caused her to lash out at her family. When the Captain died on May 30, 1947, the children started to rebel. They were tired of living on the road, and they wanted to start families and settle down. All of the children eventually broke away, and the von Trapps stopped touring in 1956. The family corporation bought an old farm house in Stowe, Vermont, with everyone helping to build the home and take care of the farm. They soon found out that this was not enough to support the whole family, so while they were away on tours they rented their home to skiers. This was the beginning of the von Trapp hotel business.\n\nStage Play\n\nThe Sound of Music appeared on the Broadway stage years before the movie was made in 1965. Mary Martin played Maria. There was also a long-running production on London. The children in the srage play always wore white sailor suits. It is also an often done play by community and school theater groups.\n\nMovies\n\nThere are a number of films depicting the experiences of the Trapp family. The most famous is the Julie Andrews musical based on the Broadway play. There were also films made in Germany after the War. The family received no royalties from the film, having sold the rights for a small amount years earlier.\n\nGerman films\n\nThe film version of the Trapp family saga was first made in Germany. Actually there were two films: \"Die Trapp-Familie\" (1956) and \"Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika\" (1958). These films were made some years before the U.S. film--the musical version \"The Sound of Music\" was made. (The Broadway version appeared several years ealier.) Michael Ande Michael played Werner in the Trapp-films. (In \"The Sound of Music\" the boy's names were different.)\n\nSound of Music\n\nThe Sound of Music is one of the most popular musicals ever made. The message is how love can change everything. It is the musical version of the trap family saga. The film is based on a true story, but the Trapps thought the film was rather soppy. It was a block buster long-running hit on Broadway with Mary Martin before finally being made into a film musical with Julie Andrews. The children first appear in identical grey sailor suits with green trim. I'm not sure how common that combination was. I'm also not sure how common this was in Austria, it is likely that blue and white suits were more common. Some boys did wear sailor suits in Austria and Germany into their early teens, especially before the NAZI era.\n\nReader Comments\n\nA reader writes, \"I don't really know what to say. I've watched 'Sound of Music' maybe close to 1000 times since I was a little girl, it's still the most interesting movie ever, Cpt Von Trapp an Maria are just two amazing people, not only the character in the movie but also the little I've learned about them, I just wish I could be more like that or just to meet an Von Trapp. To the rest of the Von Trapp family today, take it from me that doesn't like history but the family I think in 1910 was great I have respect for them, for what they did, was and still is just amazing.\"\n\nSources\n\nHirsch, Julia.
