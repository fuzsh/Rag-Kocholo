        "text": "When The Sound of Music debuted on cinema screens in April 1965, audiences fell hard and in huge numbers for the joyous celebration of music, dance, patriotism, and familial and romantic love. The adoration propelled the movie to become one of the world’s most beloved cinematic musicals and turned the story of the von Trapp family into lore. The movie received five Academy Awards—including Best Picture—and is the third highest-grossing film of all time when adjusting for inflation in the United States.\n\nWatch The Sound of Music on\n\nLike many true stories filtered through Hollywood’s often overly sentimental lens, The Sound of Music on-screen differs significantly from the true tale of Maria Kutschera, the novice nun who takes a job as a governess in the Austrian household of the von Trapps, only to find herself falling in love with widower and retired naval captain Georg von Trapp and his seven children.\n\nThe movie stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer as Maria and Georg and features enduring songs such as “Do-Re-Mi,” “How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria,” “Climb Ev’ry Mountain,” and “Edelweiss.” Now, fans can listen to their favorites, plus more than 40 unreleased tracks and 11 alternate takes that haven’t been heard before, on the newly released . The reissued and expanded soundtrack, a four-CD, 1-Blu-Ray audio box set, came out Friday. It’s the latest proof of The Sound of Music’s enduring imprint on pop culture.\n\nA cinematic recreation of the 1959 Broadway musical featuring music and lyrics by Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein, the Robert Wise–directed movie is based on the early chapters of Maria’s 1949 memoir, . The book chronicles the von Trapp family’s beginnings in Salzburg, Austria, through their escape from Nazi-occupied Europe to the family’s eventual relocation to America.\n\nTo use lyrics from “Do-Re-Mi,” when it comes to alterations and omissions contained in the movie version of The Sound of Music, “let’s start at the very beginning.”\n\nThe real Maria described herself as “horrid”\n\nMaria von Trapp\n\nMaria Augusta Kutschera was born in January 1905 and, after being orphaned at a young age, was reportedly sent to live with an abusive uncle. She attended teachers’ college where she discovered religion and converted to Catholicism before becoming a candidate for the novitiate in Salzburg.\n\nPortrayed on film by Julie Andrews as demure and self-effacing, the real Maria was, in fact, a real problem while at the convent, describing herself as “horrid, the worst you can imagine,” in a 1980 article that includes a list of transgressions such as breaking china, speaking during periods of silence, running in the courtyard, whistling Gregorian chants, and climbing on the convent roof.\n\nThe number and names of the von Trapp children were changed in the movie\n\nIn 1926, Maria was sent from the convent to tutor only one of Captain von Trapp’s seven children from his first marriage. Georg’s second eldest daughter, Maria, had contracted scarlet fever—the same disease that took his first wife’s life four years prior—and could no longer travel the distance to and from school.\n\nYes, one of Georg’s daughters was named Maria, though it won’t be familiar to many. In fact, all the names and sexes of the seven von Trapp children represented in the movie were changed. The real von Trapp children were, in age descending order: Rupert, Agathe, Maria, Werner, Hedwig, Johanna, and Martina.\n\nSign up for our free newsletter to learn the true stories behind other popular movies\n\nOn-screen, Rupert became Liesl, a 16-going-on-17-year-old girl. In real life, by the time the family fled Austria, Rupert was in his late twenties and a practicing physician.\n\nEven the number of children wasn’t correct in the movie. When the von Trapps escaped Austria, there were nine children: seven from Georg’s first marriage and two from his marriage to Maria, Rosmarie and Eleonore. The tenth child, Johannes, was born in America in 1939.\n\nThe real family wasn’t as wealthy as portrayed on screen\n\nChristopher Plummer as Captain Georg von Trapp sings to his children in The Sound of Music (1965).\n\nAlthough money didn’t appear to be of concern to the family depicted in the movie, in real life, the fortunes of the von Trapp family had faltered during the global depression of the early 1930s to the extent that, at the time the film is set, most of the household servants had been dismissed and the family had begun taking in boarders.\n\nThe lack of funds also prompted the von Trapps to consider turning their love of singing together into a profession. “It almost hurt [my father] to have his family on stage, not from a snobbish view, but more from a protective one,” Eleonore is quoted as saying in a 1978 Washington Post interview.\n\nThe von Trapps were a musical household well before Maria entered their lives\n\nThe von Trapp family sings in a London radio show in December 1937.\n\nBoth in real and reel life, the family singers won first place in the Salzburg Music Festival. But the sound of music was already well established within the household before Maria arrived. In a reversal of the stern, music-forbidding retired naval officer depicted in the film, the real Georg and his first wife encouraged song in their home years before Maria arrived.\n\n“In reality, Georg was a warm and loving if somewhat overwhelmed father,” author Tom Santopietro writes in . “It was actually Maria herself, with her emotionally stunted upbringing, who needed thawing.”\n\nMaria was hesitant about marrying Captain von Trapp\n\nLike in the movie, Maria and Georg were married only a year after the novice arrived as governess. Unlike the movie, they were actually married in 1927, more than a decade before fleeing Austria in 1938. Georg was 25 years older than Maria, and the match wasn’t love at first sight.\n\nAlthough Georg had fallen for Maria and asked her to stay with him and become a second mother to his children, Maria wasn’t as sure of the union, reportedly saying, “God must have made him word it that way because if he had only asked me to marry him I might not have said yes.”\n\nThe real von Trapp family didn’t secretly cross the alps by foot\n\nThe family’s exit from Austria under Nazi occupation was also given a glossy Hollywood treatment, depicting the von Trapps as having to cross the alps on foot to avoid detection. In reality such a journey would have brought them directly into Germany, not Switzerland as in the film. “Don’t they know geography in Hollywood? Salzburg does not border on Switzerland!” complained Maria to a reporter in 1967.\n\nAlthough they left Austria only a day before the borders were sealed, their actual departure lacked the drama contained in the movie according to documents and interviews contained in the U.S. National Archives. “We did tell people that we were going to America to sing,” daughter Maria told Opera News in 2003. “And we did not climb over mountains with all our heavy suitcases and instruments. We left by train in broad daylight, pretending nothing.”\n\nThe von Trapps traveled with their musical conductor, Reverend Franz Wasner, and secretary Martha Zochbauer. On film, Wasner became the fictional Max Detweiler, who remained in Austria."
