        "text": "The home of the Sound of Music Family\n\n“It was Maria’s biggest wish to someday be able to return to the house where she had spent most of her youth. This was not at all easy, because Maria never really recovered from a disease she had suffered from in her early childhood. She had always been weaker than her brothers and sisters. But today she is not tired at all. On the contrary Maria von Trapp is looking back on her time at the Trapp Villa and thinking of her roots, here in Austria, in Salzburg.”\n\nAt the age of 94 years, Maria von Trapp flew from America to Salzburg. Going back to her family home with all the memories in the house was a very emotional experience for her.\n\nStanding in the hallway she remembered sliding down the banisters with her brothers and sisters. She looked out of the window and remembered them all climbing the apple trees outside.\n\nAs the oldest von Trapp daughter, Agathe’s impeccable recall of her childhood brings fresh life to the events that forged enduring bonds within her devoted family. Her memories of her idyllic Austrian home transport readers back to the time before the von Trapps came to America and reveal a close knit group of siblings who adored their gentle father and mourned the tragic loss of their mother.\n\nThe von Trapps were Austrian nobility whose musical gifts enabled them to escape the Nazi threat during World War II and to entertain thousands of audiences in Europe and the United States.\n\nAgathe von Trapp assisted in the operation of a Kindergarten near Baltimore, Maryland for thirty five years.\n\nMaria was teaching children at Nonnberg, when Captain Georg von Trapp needed a teacher for one of his daughters, who was of delicate health.\n\nHer book, The Story of the Trapp Family Singers was adapted to create The Sound of Music.\n\nThe Real Story of the von Trapp Family\n\nNonnberg was established during the eight century and became the first Benedictine Abbey north of the Alps. Maria was a qualified teacher, when Captain von Trapp requested a governess for several months for his daughter, who was bedridden with rheumatic fever. She expected to remain with the von Trapp family for 10 months, at the end of which she would return to Nonnberg.\n\nTeacher training in Austria was deeply influenced by the ideas of Friedrich Froebel. Singing and nature walks were part of this training to nurture each child to be active and develop an interest in nature.\n\nMaria developed a caring and loving relationship with all the children. She enjoyed singing with them and getting them involved in outdoor activities. During this time, Georg fell in love with Maria and asked her to stay with him and become a second mother to his children. Maria married Captain von Trapp on November 26, 1927.\n\nGeorg Johannes Ritter von Trapp (4 April 1880 – 30 May 1947) was born in Zara, Dalmatia, then a Crown Land of the Austro Hungarian Empire (present day Zadar, Croatia). His father was a naval officer, who had been elevated to the Austrian nobility in 1876, which entitled him and his descendants to the style of “Ritter von Trapp” for sons and “von Trapp” for daughters.\n\nRitter (knight) was an hereditary title of nobility. In order of precedence Ritter ranked above the lowest rank of the nobility, Edler (nobleman), and below Freiherr (baron).\n\nThe great grandchildren of the Captain and Maria von Trapp; Sofi, Melanie, Amanda, and August von Trapp have been singing on stages around the world to critical acclaim and packed houses.\n\nTake down those old drapes and make some play clothes. A new production of The Sound of Music began touring in September 2015 to mark the 50th anniversary of the film version, which continues to be the most successful movie musical in history."
