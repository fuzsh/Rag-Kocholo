        "text": "Istrian Holiday\n\nIn Chapter 8 of Maria's book (\"Uncle Peter and his Handbook\"), she describes a trip taken by the von Trapp family, together with the Captain's cousin, Peter, and his family. They bicycled from Salzburg, through the Alps, and all the way to Pola where they had previously lived. From the evidence given in the book, it seems to have been around 1931. She writes:\n\n\"There were not many cars on the highways at that time, and the country through which we cycled was so unearthly beautiful -- we had a wonderful, wonderful time.\" They had sent the luggage ahead to Pola; she writes, \"Pola, situated on the southernmost point of the Istrian peninsula, was the former Austrian Naval Base, which is now Italian, and the island [Veruda, their destination] was a few miles offshore.\"\n\nThey made it to Pola in five days' time: \"there, eating the most delicious fried fish and drinking the dark native wine, we sat together until deep into the night, telling of our adventures.\"\n\nThey then set out for the nearby island of Veruda:\n\n\"The island had no pier; one had to wade ashore. ...Veruda is one of the many small islands off the shore of Istria and Dalmatia, which on one side emerges gently out of the sea, rises gradually up to about 150 or 200 feet, and ends abruptly on the other side in a steep cliff. In an hour one could walk around it. The sea had eaten deep into its shoreline, forming many little bays as big as a large room. One part of the island, about fifty acres, was covered with dense pine groves. The rest was fields and pastures. Franciscan Fathers had once owned this beautiful spot. On the highest point of the island the ruins of the church and the convent were still standing. The monks had planted a garden with medicinal herbs. Long after the Fathers had been driven out by Napoleon, the herbs had spread all over the land, and during the hot summer nights they exhaled the most wonderful fragrance, which one could smell for miles and miles out at sea: thyme and lavender, dill and sage, mint and sweet geranium and rosemary, and many more which we couldn't name. The old walls were overgrown with honeysuckle, wild roses, oleander, and laurel. A walk through this little paradise in the full moonlight was unearthly beautiful.\"\n\nGeorg (the Captain) had known Veruda since his boyhood days. He had been born in Zara, half-way down the Dalmatian coast, into a family of an Austrian Navy officer. They had lived in Trieste awhile and, until 1918, in Pola. He also knew Signor Pauletta, who owned a hardware store in Pola before the war. Afterwards (Signor Pauletta) had acquired Veruda and retired there. He had fixed himself a couple of rooms in the old monastery, and there he lived now, as his island's only inhabitant, very contentedly on the fish he caught and vegetables he planted, needing next to no money. Very rarely he went \"downtown\", which meant Pola. He had invited us to camp on Veruda, and now - here we were.\"\n\nWhen Signor Pauletta, who owned \"a couple of pots and pans, a Sunday suit, and fishing tackle\" saw the familes come ashore, laden with all sorts of modern and sophisticated camping gear and luggage, he clucked his tongue many times and said \"Varra, varra!\" which, Maria explains, means \"What do you know about that!\".\n\nThe chapter ends with her calling Veruda \"that hidden pearl of the sea.\" [There is nothing in this book about their going to Lussin although that is remembered from personal accounts by some of our Lussignani.]\n\nTurning Points\n\nThe economy crashed in 1932 (the European side of the Great Depression), and then Captain von Trapp lost his fortune after the Austrian national bank folded in 1933. The children had to learn how to work, doing laundry and other household chores. They looked at their misfortune as an adventure, but their father was hit hard by the loss. At that point, he had nine children to support, and no money. When the von Trapps began to earn money by singing in public, the Captain faced another conundrum. For a man in his position, earning a living on stage was considered dÃ¨classÃ¨. But they had little choice. As the head of the family, the Captain would come out and introduce the group after they had performed a few numbers, and then at the end of the show he would come back out and take a bow.\n\nMaria, along with Father Wasner, brought a sophistication to the family's singing, but according to Johannes, it was the Captain's naval stature that had helped the family forge their careers. Even before they began singing the Captain was very well known, and his name lent a certain air of importance to their group. When they were performing in Austria, prior to World War II, most of the \"children\" were already young adults. As for the folk costumes they wore, Maria von Trapp mentiones in her autobiography that people returned to traditional wear after World War I because of a clothing shortage.\n\nThey began singing as a way to raise some money. They performance at the Salzburg Music Festival in 1935 (or 1936) won them first prize in a choral competition, and thus were invited to give concert tours throughout Europe: France, Belgium, Netherlands, Italy, Denmark, Sweden and Norway.\n\nAccording to Hirsch's book, their musical touring life was abruptly halted when Hitler invaded Austria. The Captain brought his family together and said, \"We are standing at the open grave of Austria.\" He asked them if they wanted to stay or to leave. Despite the hardships sure to face them, they had no moral choice but to depart. Although it was a terrible blow to leave their home and all their belongings behind, when they learned that Himmler himself had taken over their house, their grief was almost unbearable.\n\nIn 1938, Austria was annexed to Adolf Hitlerâs German Empire - the Anschluss of 1938 - and unlike many Austrian aristocrats, the Von Trapps were horrified. Georg made no secret of his feelings; allegedly, the Gestapo ordered the von Trapps to display the Hakenkreuzflagge (swastika flag) for Hitler's visit to Salzburg, but Georg replied, \"I can do a better job with one of my Persian carpets.\" \"Three times he refused the Nazis,\" said Renaud Doucet, the director of the Sound of Music show in Vienna. Twice he refused to become the commander of a U-boat, and command of a submarine base. \"I have sworn my oath of loyality to only one Emperor\" was his answer, and von Trapp rejected the offer.\n\nAnd then he refused to sing at Hitler's birthday party. With that third refusal, the family realised they had to leave the country. They took a train and crossed into Italy, and at midnight on the same day, Hitler closed the borders.\"\n\nEmigration to U.S.A.\n\nAt that time, Maria was pregnant with her third child (Georg Ritter von Trapp's tenth), Johannes (now the president of the Trapp Family Lodge) when an offer to give a series of concerts in the United States provided their opportunity to escape. In June 1938, in order to avoid suspicion, the family appeared to be going on one of their frequent mountain hikes. In broad daylight, the family exited the gate at the rear of their villa and crossed the railroad tracks that ran behind it to board a train to Italy, where the family had citizenship once Captain Georg von Trappâs birthplace became Italian territory in 1920. Salzburg residents saw off the captain, a pregnant Maria and the nine von Trapp children who were traveling with suitcases in tow under the guise of a family vacation in Italy. They left just in time; the next day the Austrian borders were sealed.\n\nThe family took a train to Italy, With the Baron having dual Italian and Austrian citizenship, the von Trapps first stayed in Trieste then sailed to the United States for their first concert tour, arriving at New York in September of 1938 under six month visitors' visas. Their first public American concert was in New York's City Hall in December 1938. That Christmas concert brought the Trapp Family Singers to national attention. Well received and reviewed, the singers performed for their audiences in traditional Austrian dress. A typical reaction to their performances was reported in the New York Times: \"Their work was delightfully intimate, rhythmically secure, and, above all, expressive\" ( Dec. 11, 1938).\n\nThey then began a concert tour in Pennsylvania, arriving virtually penniless at 252 Merion Road in Merion, an unincorporated community in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that borders Philadelphia to its west. They settled in that comfortable house lent by Merion lawyer and music patron Henry S. Drinker, Jr., an authority on Bach. The familyâs tenth and last child Johannes (who became the clanâs chiarismatic leader) was born there in January 1939. While living there, the family also learned to become self-sufficient and regained its financial stability, which enabled them to buy the Vermont farm where they moved fulltime in the mid 1940s, and which is still owned by the family today.\n\nThe family traveled throughout the United States on concert tours. Their US-visa expired after six months and the family was forced to leave the country. Thanks to concert invitations, however, they managed to get new visas for Scandinavian countries. They were thus able to go back to Europe in 1939 to perform their concert tours in Scandinavia, then to return to Salzburg for a few months before returning to Sweden to finish their tour.\n\nFrom there, they traveled to Norway where their American manager sent them tickets for their next trans-Atlantic crossing - again on a visitor's visa - so that they could fulfill their contracts with him. Accompanying the von Trapp family on that voyage from Oslo, Norway, was Rev. Wasner and Martha Zochbauer, their secretary, as indicated on the September 27, 1939 Ship's Manifest.\n\nThe Trapp Family Singers\n\nUnder the direction of Rev. Wasner, the family's recreational singing had turned into a profession and the family became known as \"The Trapp Family Singers\". In her book Mari, Maria von Trapp describes those early days:\n\n\"Overnight we had become really poor; we had become refugees. A refugee not only has no country, he also has no rights. He is a displaced person. At times he feels like a parcel which has been mailed and is moved from place to place.\" But there were nine children and the tenth on the way. According to Maria, \"The only thing we could do well together was sing, so we had to turn a hobby into a way of living.\"\n\nThe Trapp Family Singers toured the United States with a bus with \"The Trapp Family Singers\" painted on the side of the bus, their only physical home during their first two years in the United States. They struggled to establish themselves as a choral singing group in the United States. They sang mostly in German, had a repertoire of difficult classical music, and dressed in old native costumes. But Maria would not let them fail. She hired a top manager and a publicist. Before long, the family singing group became quite a phenomenon. First American, and then European, audiences were impressed by the group as they performed year after year. In New York the Trapp Family Singers holiday concerts became yearly traditions.\n\nThe group enjoyed widespread success as they sang, played instruments, and re-enacted their customs on stage. The family toured the United States, as well as Europe, even as the Western nations prepared for war. The von Trapp family formally lived in Merion, Pennsylvania, for three years (1939-1942). Johannes, the tenth von Trapp child was born during a concert tour of Philadelphia. By 1940 the Trapp Family Singers consisted of Baron and Baroness von Trapp and their seven daughters and three sons.\n\nThe von Trapps had discovered Stowe, Vermont, a tiny mountain hamlet that reminded them of the home they left behind in Austria, so in 1942 Georg and Maria von Trapp took their $1,000 in savings, purchased part of the old Gale Farm on 600 acres, and converted a barn into their first formal home in the U.S.A. Maria named it Cor Unum meaning \"One Heart\". The now famous family continued to tour the world for another fifteen years but their home and hearts remained in Stowe. The family delighted in farm living. From cooking, gardening and maple sugaring to beekeeping and cross-country skiing, each found a fulfilling life on the farm.\n\nIn January 1947, Major General Harry J. Collins turned to Georg and Maria von Trapp in Stowe, Vermont, pleading for help for the Austrian people, having seen the residents of Salzburg suffer when he had arrived there with the famed 42nd Rainbow Division after World War II. The Trapp Family founded the Trapp Family Austrian Relief Inc. on impulse, with the headquarters in Stowe, Vermont. Founders Georg and Maria von Trapp took on the posts of first and second chairpersons, while Monsignore Dr. Franz Wasner was appointed treasurer.\n\nSince Johannes was born in the U.S.A. he was a natural-born American citizen. in 1944, except for Georg, part of the family applied for U.S. citizenship - Maria, Johanna, Martina, Maria, Hedwig, and Agathe. Rosemarie and Eleonore also became citizens by virtue of their mother's citizenship, whereas Rupert and Werner became citizens by serving in the military in during World War II.\n\nOn 30 May 1947, Georg Ritter von Trapp passed away in Stowe, Vermont from lung cancer. He was buried in a meadow behind the family's lodge. In the summer of 1950, the Trapp family began welcoming guests to their rustic, 27-room family home/lodge. After a devastating fire in 1980, the original structure was replaced by the new Trapp Family Lodge, a striking, 96-room alpine lodge situated on 2,600 acres offering magnificent indoor and outdoor resort amenities.\n\nThe Trapp Family Singers disbanded in 1957 and went their separate ways. In 1987, nearly forty years after her husband's death, Maria Augusta likewise passed away in Vermont. She rests next to her husband in what is now the family cemetery at the Lodge. Also interred there are five of the children from the first marriage: Hedwig, Martina, Rupert, Werner, and Agathe von Trapp.\n\nSee Also:\n\nMaria Augusta Kutschera von Trapp\n\nThe Ten Von Trapp Children\n\nVon Trapp Family Singers after 1947\n\nMovie vs. Reality: The Real Story of the von Trapp Family\n\nGeorg & Agathe Foundation - https://www.georgandagathe.org/home.html\n\nTrapp Family Lodge (Stowe, Vermont) - http://www.trappfamily.com\n\nK.u.K.

Memories of an Austrian U-Boat Commander. Translated and with an introduction by Elizabeth Campbell Peters of the University of Nebraska), 2009.\n\nOverview: The Sound of Music endeared Georg von Trapp (1880â1947) and his singing family to the world, and it also showed how desperately the Nazis wanted Captain von Trapp for their navy. In To the Last Salute we learn why. Trappâs own story of his exploits as a submarine commander during the First World War is as exciting as it is instructive, bringing to stirring life a little-known chapter in the naval history of that war.\n\nIn his many guises, Trapp describes life as captain of Austro-Hungarian U-boats in the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, emerging by turn as the Imperial Austrian naval officer, the witty observer of international politics, and the indefatigable and ultimately heartbroken patriot opposing the Allied enemy. He relates deadly duels with submarine sweepers, narrow escapes and excruciatingly close calls, and the spectacular sinking of cargo and war ships â all while maintaining a keen sense of the camaraderie of seamen from every corner of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Trappâs story, in English for the first time, offers a rare combination of human interest, historical insight, and true life-and-death adventure.\n\nPublish Works (by others):\n\nMaria Augusta Kutschera von Trapp, The story of the Trapp Family Singers.
