        "text": "Grandfather of the von Trapp children\n\nCaptain August Johann Ritter (Knight) von Trapp (1836-1884)\n\nAustro-Hungarian Imperial Naval Captain\n\nMulti-National: Captian August von Trapp was born in the Grand Duchy of Hesse, an independent country and free state of the German Confederation*. He emigrated to the Austrian Empire for a career in the Austrian Imperial Navy, later the Austro-Hungarian Royal War Navy. His ancestors 'Trapp', who originated in Steiermark/Styria and Tyrol (today Austria), had moved to Hesse 200 years earlier during the Counter-Reformation to escape religious persecution for their Lutheran belief.\n\nMusic/Art:Accomplished amateur pianist with the ability to recall and play music from ear\n\nHistoric Merits: Under Admiral Tegethoff's command, August was an Officer Lieutenant on the screw frigate SMS Schwarzenberg at the 1866 'Battle of Lissa'; in 1874, he was knighted for saving his crew from a Mediterranean typhoon on the Goèlette SMS Saida.\n\nNaval Service\n\nAfter 1848 as part of the Austrian Empire's naval improvements, both the Austrian Imperial Naval Academy was moved from Venice to Trieste (today Trieste, Italy) and the new ship arsenal to Pola (today Pula, Croatia). The official language of command and study was changed from Italian to German, phasing out dependence on Italian officers. Then a call went out for young, able-bodied, German-speaking men throughout the German Confederation* to sign up. This new career opportunity offered young men from inland Europe a chance for employment and adventure.\n\nIn the mid-1850s, at age 14, August Trapp was part of a wave of young men from the Duchy of Hesse who enlisted into the Austrian Imperial Navy, based in the Adriatic Sea at Trieste. August's schooling was on wooden sailing ships (frigates, corvettes, and schooners) plying the waters of the Mediterranean Sea in defense of the Empire’s Adriatic coastline. He graduated Cadet 2. Class, moving through the ranks from Cadet 1. Class, Officer Cadet (Linienschiffsfaehnrich), Frigate Lieutenant (Fregattenleutnant), Officer Lieutenant (Linienschiffsleutnant) to Corvette Captain (Korvettenkapitaen) by 1866. From 1864-1866, August was Commandant of the Goèlette SMS Saida, an impressive schooner with state of the art rigging and sails. With her imposing presence, she was considered the pride of the Austrian navy. Under his command, she patrolled the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nIn 1864, the Austrian Imperial Navy's Commander-in-Chief, Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, became Emperor of Mexico and sailed to South America. With this, the Navy lost its strongest advocate and the planned improvements to its fleet were interrupted. On July 20, 1866, under Admiral William Tegethoff's command of their multi-national navy, a hastily assembled fleet, consisting partly of wooden ships fortified with scrap metal, set off in defense of the island of Lissa. As an Officer Lieutenant of the converted sailing frigate SMS Schwarzenberg, August took part in the four-hour fierce wooden frigate ship-to-ship battle at the 'Battle of Lissa' between the Kingdom of Italy and the Austrian Empire. The Austrians were victorious, and August was awarded the Military Merit Cross II for his bravery. A year later, the navy became the Austro-Hungarian Navy after the formation of the Dual Monarchy of Austria and Hungary.\n\nIn 1874, August was knighted and awarded the hereditary title \"Ritter von\" (Knight) with a Coat-of-Arms as the result of saving his 73 person-crew during a deadly Mediterranean typhoon while commanding the SMS Saida near the Sicilian coast. The typhoon had destroyed 20 other ships with a heavy death toll. Tragically, ten years later, August died of typhoid fever leaving behind his young family.\n\nGrandfather of the von Trapp children\n\nJohn Whitehead, Austro-Hungarian Ritter (Knight) (1854-1902)\n\nEngineer, Assisted with Invention of Torpedo\n\nMulti-National: A citizen of Great Britain, but born in Trieste, Austrian Empire (today Trieste, Italy), as a youngster he moved and settled with his family to Fiume, Austro-Hungarian Empire (today Rijeka, Croatia). Later, he became known as \"Cavaliere* John Whitehead of Fuime\".\n\nMusic/Art: Accurate technical engineering draftsman, as well as carved wood for a hobby\n\nHistoric Merits: Engineer; assistant to his father, Robert Whitehead, with the invention of the first self-propelled, underwater torpedo; later added improvements granted a United States patent for a torpedo launching apparatus; and Ambassador to Argentina at Fiume.\n\n​​\n\nEngineer\n\nIn 1854, John Whitehead was born to British engineer Robert Whitehead and Marie Johnson in Trieste, a port city of the Austrian Empire (today Trieste, Italy). Two years later, Robert moved his family to Fiume, an up and coming free port on the Adriatic Sea, under the Austrian Empire (today Rijeka, Croatia) to take on the Chief Engineer role at the metal foundry, Stabilmento Tecnico di Fiume.\n\nAlready at age 4, John could be found on the shop floor. At age 12, with his keen inherited engineering talent, he helped his father, along with their trusted mechanic Annibale Plöch, and day laborer Mr. Gonza, to develop the first prototype of a self-propelled, underwater torpedo. He went on to study at Zürich Hochschule (Zurich Highschool) and graduated in 1878 from the University of Leipzig in the Germany Confederation with a degree in engineering. In 1883, John Whitehead became Consul to the Republic of Argentina at Fiume. In 1887, he was awarded an Imperial Austrian Knighthood of the Franz Joseph Order. That same year he married Countess Agathe Gobertina von Breunner-Enkevoirth. Together they had six children: John Jr., Frank, Agathe, Robert Jr., Mary, and Joan.\n\nHis father made him Partner at the family-owned Whitehead Torpedo Factory in Fiume, together with Robert's son-in-law, Corvette Captian Count Georg Hoyos (who had married Alice Whitehead). Under John's direction, as head engineer, together with Tal Jones (the future technical director of their Whitehead Weymouth Torpedo Factory in England) and a young American engineer, Karl Hassenteufel, many experiments (acoustics and gas dynamics) and improvements to the torpedo (Gyroscope and its engine) were effected through the next 20 years. For his brother-in-law, Count Georg Hoyos, John drafted plans for a private sailboat. This 13-ton cutter was built in the Whitehead Torpedo Factory and christened: “Drache” (Dragon) named after the Austrian Imperial Navy ship that Count Georg Hoyos had served on in the 1866 'Battle of Lissa'.\n\nTragically, his life was cut short after his 2-year valiant battle with cancer; he passed away in Vienna, on April 9, 1902, at the age of 47, leaving behind his young family. His funeral was attended by many dignitaries, friends, family, and the extended Whitehead Torpedo Factory employees; he was buried with honors.\n\nGrandmother of the von Trapp children\n\nCountess Agathe Gobertina von Breunner-Enkevoirth (1859–1945)\n\nAustro-Hungarian Nobility\n\nMulti-National: Her international heritage includes Austrian nobility and historic Croatian and Hungarian noble families of Széchenyi, Esterházy, Erdődy, Batthyány, Rákóczy, Pálffy, Zrínyi/Zrinska, and Frangepán/Frankopan. They include honored freedom fighters, patrons of the arts, Viceroys of Hungary and Croatia, and personal counsels to the Habsburg Monarchy.\n\nMusic/Art: Accomplished amateur pianist, singer, and architect/designer\n\nHistoric Merits: Part of the Austro-Hungarian nobility and she played a supporting role at the Whitehead Torpedo Factory as wife to John Whitehead, a Partner in the family-owned business.\n\nBackground\n\nCountess Agathe von Breunner-Enkevoirth was born at the family seat, Castle Grafenegg, in the Austrian Empire, the third child and second daughter of Count August von Breunner-Enkevoirth and Countess Agathe Széchenyi. Her childhood was spent in the close embrace of her extended family, in which making music was a favorite past time. Some of these occasions were spent in Zselíz, Hungary (today Želiezovce, Slovakia) at her grandmother's estate, where she played on the piano that the composer Franz Schubert had tutored her grandmother and great-aunt on. In 1887 she married British engineer John Whitehead at the Votiv Church, in Vienna, Austria. They settled in Fiume, on the Austro-Hungarian Empire's Adriatic coastline (today Rijeka, Croatia), where she became instrumental in helping her husband in matters of business correspondence relating to the Whitehead Torpedo Factory. It is here she and John started their family. They had six children: John Jr., Frank, Agathe, Robert Jr, Mary, and Joan.\n\nIn her own right, she was an accomplished musician, amateur watercolorist, architect, and designer. She played an active role in the building and designing of three residences. Her love of music was passed on to her children, carrying on the family tradition of spending hours together making music. After 15 years of marriage, with the premature death of her husband in 1902 to cancer, she became a young widow. As a single parent, she raised their six children between her home in Fiume and her vacation house, 'Erlhof', in Zell am See, Austria. Agathe never remarried and continued to wear the English widow’s Whipple (head covering) for the remainder of her life. With her love, support, and guidance, she saw her children grow up, marry, and start families of their own.\n\nIn 1911, her daughter and namesake, Agathe Whitehead married Captain Georg von Trapp. In November of that year, Agathe became a grandmother to Georg and Agathe's first son Rupert; later she was affectionally known as 'Gromi' to all her grandchildren. In 1914 when Europe was plunged into World War I, their coastal homeland was emptied of civilians into inland Austria for their safety. Agathe offered a safe harbor to her family, including the von Trapps, at her 'Erlhof' home. The family was in the unique and unenviable position of holding different citizenships that placed their men fighting on opposite sides in the war. Agathe's eldest son John Jr. was a Second-Luitenent in the British Royal Flying Corps (Allied side) and her son-in-law Georg von Trapp was an Austro-Hungarian Submarine Captian (Central Powers side). It was a real testament to the closeness and love in her family, that they all were able to support each other and endure the war together, despite this fact.\n\nWithin the next 8 years, tragically, Agathe would lose two of her children too young. During the war years, her 27-year-old son, John, died in an airplane accident in England. A few years after the war, her 31-year-old daughter, Agathe passed way from Scarlett-fever contracted by taking care of her children who had been stricken with the disease. Countess von Breunner's life, lived with dignity, natural charm, inner-strengthen, and an independent spirit, spanned the height of the Habsburg Empire to the last days of World War II. She passed away near Vienna, Austria in 1945, only 11 months before WWII ended.\n\n​The von Trapp family's 1938 heroic story of leaving Austria, prior to WWII, inspired the musical and film, The Sound of Music. It is ironic that the most famous 'Austrian' family, due to geopolitics after WWI, carried Italian citizenship not Austrian (for details see the year 1918 under 'Georg & Agathe'). The exception was the eldest, Rupert, who carried Austrian citizenship to attend medical school in Austria prior to WWII and Johanna, the sixth child, who later in her life moved back to Austria.\n\nCountries\n\nAs one can see from the country list below, the family lived through turbulent and tumultuous times. Prior to World War I, they were citizens of the Austro-Hungarian Empire living on the Adriatic coast where both Georg and Agathe were born. When the Empire collapsed they were given Italian citizenship because the Adriatic coast area was annexed to Italy; due to Georg's Naval career, he was not welcomed to stay in the Adriatic since Italy had opposed Austria in the war, the family moved to inland Austria from their coastal home. While living in Austria, the country went through many shifts in power. For its first year, it was the Republic of German-Austria; then it changed to the First Republic of Austria and remained so for fifteen years; later due to internal power struggles, it reorganized as the Federal State of Austria for four years. In 1938, with the 'Anschluss', it was annexed by the German Reich and became one of its States. During this time the family became endangered as they openly opposed the Nazi regime and had to look for ways to leave the country. Fortunately, their pre-established musical career allowed them to tour Europe and then America. They were first refugees and then ultimately immigrated to the United States of America, where most of their descendants remain.\n\nAustria\n\nAustria has existed in many forms from 927–present. From 1526–1804, it was ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy. From 1804–1867, it was known as the Austrian Empire and then the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867–1918. Within its territory during this time, the free port of Fiume existed (today Rijeka, Croatia). At the end of WWI, the Austrian monarchy dissolved and a large portion of their territories lost, including their holdings on the Adriatic Coast which were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy. (Italy later lost the coastal areas to Yugoslavia after WWII; and after the collapse of communism, these coastal lands were ceded to Croatia and Slovenia in 1991.) Between 1918 and 1919, the remaining area became part of the Republic of German-Austria. In 1919 the First Austrian Republic was established, which was 1/5th of its original size. In 1934, internal political strive lead to the formation of the Federal State of Austria. From 1938-1940, Austria was annexed and became a State of the German Reich. From 1940–1942, under the German Reich, the area was the Reichsgaue of the Ostmark and from 1942–1945 it was the Alpine and Danube Reichsgaue. After WWII, it was Allied-occupied Austria for almost 10 years. In 1955, the modern Republic of Austria was established."
