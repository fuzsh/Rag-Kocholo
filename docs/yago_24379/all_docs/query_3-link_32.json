        "text": "Do you think you know everything there is to know about the von Trapp family from the cult classic movie, The Sound of Music? As Hollywood is bound to do, the film took some liberties with the history of the von Trapp family when they transferred the members of the von Trapps to Hollywood blockbuster status. Surprisingly many Austrians haven’t even seen the The Sound of Music. Shocking!! I must have seen it at least a dozen times because it is one of the firm favourites of the Christmas television season.\n\nThe Hollywood Version of Baron von Trapp\n\nOne of the most successful movies of all time, The Sound of Music won 5 Oscars on its release in 1965. In the intervening years, the movie has earned billions of dollars if you adjust for inflation.\n\nThese 7 fascinating facts about the real Georg von Trapp, the patriarch of the family von Trapp, and the George von Trapp family, show how Hollywood embellishes the truth to create a better story. Engimatic and handsome as portrayed by Christopher Plummer, Georg was the ultimate dreamboat – loving husband, father and man of principle.\n\nI was completely in love with Baron Georg von Trapp as a child but I also wanted to be the oldest daughter, Liesl von Trapp. In retrospect, I clearly had movie daddy issues. So, possibly did Maria von Trapp.\n\nThe von Trapp Love Story\n\nHow old was Maria von Trapp when she married Captain von Trapp?\n\nMaria von Trap was 22 when she married Georg who was aged 47 in 1927.\n\nWhat was the age gap between Maria von Trapp and her husband?\n\nTo clarify, that’s an age gap of 25 years between the real Baron von Trapp and Maria. Christopher Plummer brought out such a dishy-widower-Mr. Rochester vibe to the character, the age discrepancy seemed a minor footnote in the movie.\n\nThe Real Baron von Trapp\n\nWere the von trapps real? Absolutely, but let’s separate Georg van Trapp, the man, from the Hollywood creation shall we?\n\nThe Georg Von Trapp House in Austria\n\nThe Villa Trapp, the original home of the von Trapp family is now a hotel. Georg bought the Villa Trap in 1924 for his family after his first wife died.\n\nThe family lived at the villa from 1923-1938 which was built in the mid 19th century. It never was the von Trapp ancestral family home as depicted in the movie.\n\nAfter the von Trapp’s left in 1938, no less than Heinrich Himmler, one of Hitler’s most trusted men and leader of the SS Nazi secret police, used the Villa Trapp as his summer home. Georg would not have been amused.\n\nThe Hollywood von Trapp House\n\nThe Villa Trapp was in private use when the movie was being made and so the film makers had no access to it. The front and the back of the house used in the movie are two different houses, Schloss Frohnberg and Schloss Leopoldskron. The interiors were film sets created in Hollywood.\n\nHow Did Captain Von Trapp Make His Money?\n\nThe von Trapps were wealthy because Georg von Trapps’s first wife, Agathe Whitehead, inherited a substantial fortune. Her grandfather, James Whitehead, a British engineer, was the inventor of the torpedo. The von Trapp family wealth was made the traditional way – inheritance!!\n\nWhen the British government turned down his invention, Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph took James Whitehead under his wing in 1864. Today the Georg and Agathe Foundation, (Georg von Trapp first wife) runs a nonprofit to promote peace and the arts.\n\nThe von Trapps, however, were not as wealthy or as aristocratic as the movie made them out to be. In fact, Georg technically wasn’t even a baron. He was possibly only just about a baronet if Austria hadn’t abolished titles after World War I.\n\nVon Trapp Family Father Out of Sorts\n\nAfter the end of the first World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was broken up. The new Austria was left as a land-locked country after they lost access to the Mediterranean va the north eastern part of Italy in 1918.\n\nDespite having racked up lots of honours as a World War 1 hero, and having been the Austro-Hungarian’s most successful U-boat commander, Georg found himself unemployed. It’s hard to be a naval commander if your country doesn’t have a navy. Presumably he occupied himself churning out little von Trapps.\n\nWas the von Trapp family wealthy?\n\nGeorg was indeed stuffy about his family singing in public. On the other hand, the Great Depression had decimated the fortune his first wife had left him.\n\nHow did the von Trapp family make their money?\n\nAfter they ran into money troubles Maria von Trapp led the family on singing tours in order to keep them financially afloat.\n\nIn need of money, Maria sold the rights to the von Trapp memoir she had written for $9000 in 1955 which was more money than they had ever earned singing. The von Trapps never saw any royalties from the millions earned from the movies or the Broadway musicals.\n\nDid the von Trapp family lose everything?\n\nYes, they did. But technically, in real life, the von Trapp net worth had dwindled long before they abandoned Austria.\n\nGeorg was tempted to join the Nazis who had made him an attractive offer in the German Navy long before the invasion of Austria by Germany. The Nazis needed someone with his naval experience and Georg had no other occupational skills.\n\nIn the end, though, he decided he couldn’t agree with Nazi ideology. Maria and the kids would just have to keep singing to keep a roof over their heads.\n\nWhy did the von Trapp family leave Austria?\n\nNot only did Captain von Trapp refuse to join the Germany Navy, he refused permission for his family to sing at a concert in honour of Hitler’s birthday. It was definitely time for them to be on their way.\n\nAlthough Austrian by ethnicity, Georg was born in what became Italy after World War I. As a result, the family were all Italian citizens. Technically he was born in Croatia if you go along today’s geographic lines.\n\nWhen they left Austria in 1938, the took a day train to Italy from the station which was at the edge of their estate. Not nearly as exciting as being chased by Nazis through the cemetery at night as the movie depicts.\n\nWhere did the Von Trapp family live in America?\n\nThe family spent a short time in Pennsylvania, before settling in Stowe Vermont. They bought a farm that became known as the Trapp Family Lodge.\n\nDid Von Trapp family return to Austria?\n\nIn 1939, the von Trapps did a musical tour of Scandinavia. During this time, they stopped by to visit Salzburg as well. They returned to the USA just as World War II was starting.\n\nHow many children did Captain von Trapp have?\n\nGeorg von Trapp and his first wife had 7 children together.\n\nDid Maria von Trapp have children of her own?\n\nGeorg and Maria had 3 children together. Unlike the movie version, Georg and Maria had been married for years before the Anschluss (forced union of Austria into Germany) occurred.\n\nTheir first two children, Rosemarie von Trapp and Eleanore von Trapp, were born in Salzburg. Their youngest child, Johannes von Trapp, was born in Pennsylvania in 1939 because the family had settled in the USA by then.\n\nSo in total, Captain von Trapp had a grand total of 10 little von Trapps.\n\nHow many von Trapps are there in the movie?\n\nThere are 7 children and the Captain and Maria von Trapp in the movie.\n\n***"
