        "text": "I'm sure some of you are familiar with DP Shane Hurlbut. He has been close to Canon for years and have been given early access to cameras like the 1Dc and C500. He was one of the early adopters of the 5D mkII in feature film. Shane has done many comparisons between many cameras. Among the popular ones are the C500 vs Alexa. Hurlbut liked the C500.\n\nIn a series of tweets recently he has stated that he is currently testing the RED Dragon. He now says it's \"the best camera he's ever used, period.\"\n\nHe says it's \"nice to not have all the hassle as with the C500\" and that it is fresh with \"a camera company that listens\".\n\nI am paraphrasing here a bit, but they are close quotes (check on twitter if you like). He will soon do a writeup on his blogâ€”that will be interesting.\n\nAs someone replied on Twitter: this doesn't look too good for Canon come NAB. Shane might potentially have some insight, but if he is bailing now, what does that mean? Some frustration with Canon can be felt between the lines of Shane's tweets.\n\nThis does specifically concern the C500 and its continuation. I don't feel all of this is relevant to the C300 mkII, but it's interesting nonetheless. There's more to say here, but I'll leave it at that to get the ball rolling. =)\n\nInteresting, but price should still be a consideration, and there's a pretty big price gap between the two, right?\n\nWhat's annoying to me isn't that Canon's failing to make their cameras good enough, it just seems like they don't even want to bother trying to compete at the top-tier. Annoying for completely selfish reasons of course, because I like my c100 just fine and wouldn't be sinking $40k on a new camera+accessories anyway, but until Canon comes out with a powerhouse, clients are still going to be asking for \"That RED camera\" without respect to their actual project. Get the Canon name out there on high profile work and maybe we'll see a few more \"RED or Canon camera\" requirements"
