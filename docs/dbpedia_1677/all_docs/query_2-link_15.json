        "text": "Cinematographer Shane Hurlbut's diverse resume includes projects with interesting logistical challenges. The handsomely mounted 2005 adventure \"Into the Blue,\" starring Paul Walker, Jessica Alba, and Scott Caan, required him to film 80 percent of the action underwater. Meanwhile, with the lesser known Shia Labeouf drama, \"The Greatest Game Ever Played,\" he tried to apply a kinetic sense of excitement to the game of golf for the true story of a caddie who qualified to play in the 1913 United States Open. Hurlbut graduated to the movie DP game the way many have before him, via music videos and then commercials. One of the movie assignments for which this background came in most handy is the 2009 action sequel \"Terminator Salvation,\" starring Christian Bale. Hurlbut has also collaborated on successive projects with director Charles Stone III (\"Drumline,\" \"Mr. 3000\") and previously worked with \"Into the Blue\"'s John Stockwell on the 2000 romantic drama \"Crazy/Beautiful.\" He received an American Society of Cinematographers nomination in 1999 for his work on the 1998 HBO movie \"The Rat Pack,\" in which Ray Liotta played Frank Sinatra."
