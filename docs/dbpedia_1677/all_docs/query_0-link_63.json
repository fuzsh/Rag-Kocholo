        "text": "Sony NEX-VG10 Firmware .02 available in US - possible Mac issues\n\nThe firmware update for the Sony NEX-VG10 is now available on Sony's U.S. website. There's versions for Mac and PC: Firmware Update (version 02) NEX-VG10V2_Update1011a.dmg Firmware Update (version 02) NEX-VG10V2_Update1011a.exe Sony's support site goes to different pages for different OS's (i.e. 10.6 Mac is here ) but I think there are only two installers. One Snow Leopard (Mac OS 10.6) user at the dpreview forum encountered a problem when he tried to run the installer: I followed the instructions for Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and proceeded to update the firmware. During the update (Sony runs a small installer program that has an interface that shows the update being applied) the Mac Mini (new 2010 version) suffered a Kernel Panic and drew a grey screen and froze still! The Mac was able to restart but the VG10 was dead- nothing I could do would cause the VG10 to operate (removed battery and restarted, removed SD card etc....camera was dead!) dpre\n\nRED Epic Camera - Top Ten Questions\n\nFresh off the Asia Red Epic Tour, Ted Schilowitz \"Leader of the Rebellion\" of RED Digital Cinema and Tonaci Tran get together in Vietnam to talk about the Red Epic camera. Here's a quick summary of the questions/answers, though watch the video for the full details. When will it ship? - When it's ready How much does it weigh? - Body only about 5lbs. Typical configuration about 9lbs. How do you take stills and motion at the same time? - Not sure I followed the answer...press a preset button? What accessories from the Red One will work with Epic? - Short answer is almost everything Does HDRX work in camera - There's an easy HDRX mode that works in-camera. - HDRX mode extends the usable range from a little over 13 stops to 18 stops. Talk about the redesign and cooling he does Can you have two on-board LCDs at the same time? - Yes Is there a 5.5K mode coming? - Never say never. What happens if you put a non-Canon lens in? - It goes to a default\n\nPOV.HD - $600 by Dec 22nd\n\nV.I.O has a new HD POV camera coming that will capture 1080. Priced at $599, it should be shipping just before Christmas. The recording unit features a 2-inch LCD screen to view footage in the field, edit video and make exposure control adjustments. A simple set of controls allows the user to easily “tag” the best footage in the field, so final editing is finished quickly back in the studio. The 2-oz wearable camera head captures 142 degree FOV, at 1080p 30fps—the widest point-of-view camera angle available on the market. The camera head also features video capture at 720p 60fps, a high-quality 6-element glass lens and a native 1080p CMOS sensor designed specifically to produce optimal-quality, Full HD video.

System Version 1.7 now let's you set the recording level of INPUT1 and 2 individually.

That’s probably because when we sit down at the TV, we want to be passive, with brains turned off, and when we surf the Web, we’re in a different mind-set: more active, more directed - Pogue The quest to bring the full range of Internet video to your TV in a\n\nSony PMW-F3L listed at B & H for $16,000\n\nYou can't even pre-order it (just ask to be notified when it's in stock) but B & H has a page up for the PMW-F3L : Sony PMW-F3L Super 35mm Full-HD Compact Camcorder\n\nSony NEX-VG10 firmware Ver.02 available\n\nWARNING: This is on the New Zealand Sony site. It's unknown if this update supports U.S. cameras, and the software is not yet on the Sony U.S. site. Sony promised an update to the NEX-VG10 that would add support for auto-focus with A-mount lenses, and they seem to now be making the firmware update available. The update does not appear to add any other functionality. Note that there are different Mac and PC versions, and you must also update the firmware in the LA-EA1 Mount Adaptor (link to that update is on the page.)

Meanwhile, at Film And Digital Times , Seth Emmons reports on Sony’s recent Super 35mm event at the George Lucas Building at the University of Southern California. While this meeting was ostensibly about the PMW-F3, the NXCAM 35mm camera was also touched on. Although there were those who questioned the choice of a 35 Mbs codec [ in the PMW-F3 ], Crithary answered with what we thought was the biggest surprise of the night. SR Memory is closer than you think, and more affordable. Although he declined to put a price tag or delivery date on the SR Memory recorder, called SR-R1, he did expect it to be within reach of many cinematographers. The ability to record up to 440 Mbs (and higher) onto solid state, RAID-5 protected cards of up to 1Tb should meet the needs of any of any high-budget,\n\nNews from Here & There\n\nSony PMW-F3 Camera Test Another video shot with the Sony PMW-F3. This camera test was produced by Stargate Studios : Sony PMW F3 Camera Test from Stargate Studios on Vimeo . People watching more web video ads? A report on video ad monetization quoted in Adweek claims that people are watching more ads, and watching more of them: \"Much early reporting on the issue focused on short clips of user-generated content and showed extremely low completion rates for pre-roll ads,\" the report states. \"Clearly behavior is different with professional content, especially long form.\" Adweek : More Videos Ads, More User Acceptance ARRI Alexa A Hit The ARRI Alexa is proving popular in Hollywood and worldwide with almost 1,000 orders and 400 already delivered, including 200 in North America. “It’s a no brainer.

He also reports that the NXCAM 35mm camera will have \"exactly the same sensor\" as the PMW-F3, which is a bit of a surprise ( it's certainly the same size as the PMW-F3 camera, but it was unclear if it's the same physical sensor. ) Launch of Sony F3 and NXCAM in London [UPDATE 11:01PM] - CreativeVideo says it's not the same sensor as the PMW-F3: Sony HXR-NX35 NXCAM HD camcorder with s35mm sensor and AVCHD...\n\nMartin Scanlan & Steve Lawes get to play with a PMW-F3\n\n....we get to watch. \" The first short film in the world shot on the new Sony PMW-F3 \" is now on Vimeo. Martin Scalan and Steve Lawes got to play with the camera and have posted this video. Check out the video, and then go to read the blog about it: Hands on review of the new Sony PMW-F3 I think that Sony have something very interesting here, I think the camera will be a success. There are things that I would like to see different on the camera, but I could say that about an Alexa, Red or DSLR. I feel the image quality that you will be able to get out the back of this camera is it’s main attribute. If Sony, or somebody else for that matter such as AJA come up with a compact, possibly solid state off board recorder that can take advantage of this, you have a very interesting prospect. Convergence - Short Film shot on Sony PMW-F3 from Martin Scanlan on Vimeo .\n\nAmazon offering money for scripts and movies\n\nAmazon has started \" Amazon Studios \" and is offering money for scripts and movies through a series of \"contests.\" The first contest runs through January 31, and there's a $100,000 award for Best Movie, and two $20,000 awards for Best Script. The Best Movie part is a little confusing, as they are asking for a movie that's not necessarily finished, and yet... An Amazon Studios test movie should be an inexpensive , full-length movie that tells the whole story of the script in a compelling way, has very good acting and sound , but that doesn't necessarily have polished production values . So unless your crane shot is essential to telling the story, skip it or do it in storyboard. The purpose of the movies at Amazon Studios is to show how scripts are working up on their feet. Inexpensive, but with good acting and sound? Production values don't have to be polished, but the sound has to be good? Seems a bit oxymoronish to me! Note too that by upload\n\nMore on the Sony NXCAM 35mm\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a name for this camera yet, so for the moment, I'm going to use the name NXCAM 35mm as it's the hash-tag that Peter Crithary of Sony is using for it. Alistair Chapman is at InterBEE ns Japan, where a camera prototype is being shown, and on dvinfo.com he reports : It is of a modular design with removable microphone holder, hand grip and many other parts. I don't think this will use the same sensor as the F3. The F3 is from the Atsugi factory and this is from the Shinagawa factory and they rarely share sensors. I suspect it will use an Alpha/NEX sensor but with an optical low pass filter specifically for video applications as opposed to the VG10's OLPF which has to work for both video and stills. On the rear of the camera body there is a huge opening that looks too big to be just a battery compartment so I suspect that some kind of media or recording section will dock into the rear of the camera. No genlock apparently, but other sync m\n\nBlue's Mikey finally shipping\n\nAnnounced several months ago, Blue's Mikey for iPhone is finally available: The all-new Mikey is the perfect tool for mobile recording. Featuring two custom-tuned Blue capsules for stereo recording, a line-input, USB pass through and a stylish updated 230-degree rotating design. Mikey's three gain settings allow for a versatile recording experience for everything from a loud concert to a whisper. Record lectures, voice notes, live music, interviews, and more. Mikey also comes with its own soft carrying pouch for convenient storage and protection while on the go. Mikey turns your iPod into the coolest mobile recording device around! It's $79.99 at Amazon : Blue Microphones Mikey 2.0 iPod Recording Microphone Another alternative for those looking for small, portable recording is the $99 Zoom H1 Handy Portable Digital Recorder . There's something about the idea of using one device - your iPhone - to do everything, that is very appealing. On the other hand, if\n\nSony NXCAM Professional Large-Sensor Camera On It's Way...\n\nWell that didn't take long... just a week and a bit after announcing the PMW-F3 , Sony is now semi-announcing an NXCAM large sensor camcorder (think of it as the professional version of the NEX-VG10 perhaps?!) It's probable that this camera will compete with the Panasonic AG-AF100 . NXCAM is Sony's designation for professional cameras using the AVCHD compression format, and at the moment consists of one other camera, the Sony HXR-NX5u . This new addition to Sony's professional NXCAM line will be available in the middle of 2011 and will have the same E-mount as the NEX cameras and support A-mount lenses. The recording format of the camera will be AVCHD, and they plan to implement 1080p (60p / 30p / 24p*2 or 50p / 25p) recording modes. (MPEG4-AVC/H.264 compression will be used for these modes.) *2: 59.94p / 29.97p / 23.98p respectively.

In some cases, video and audio content may not be recorded during initial use. Users may not recognize this problem during shooting, but may discover it when attempting to playback the content. This condition is not recoverable. If the camcorder/VTR is found to have head clogging after using an affected tape, it can be easily corrected by using a cleaning cassette. However, if the cassette functioned normally the first time, the head clogging problem will not occur. In order to ensure customer satisfaction, Sony has decided to replace the affected cassette production lots, which can be identified by the Production Lot Numbers listed below The affected cassettes are: Model Numbers: DVM63HDR, DVM63HDR/2, 3DM63HDR Production Lot Numbers : xxxxxxx5L, xxxxxxx6L, xxxxxxx7L, xxxxxxx8L The Production Lot Numbers\n\nNews From Here & There\n\nMocha Pro Released Imagineer Systems has announced the availability of its newest 64-bit VFX software, mocha Pro .
