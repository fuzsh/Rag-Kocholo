        "text": "RCDS continued its long-standing tradition of hosting the ACTION Program during the month of July, an academic enrichment program for highly motivated students from neighboring schools entering seventh, eighth, or ninth grade.\n\nThroughout the four week-program, 64 students took project-based courses in core academic disciplines including art, history, physical education, math, science, and spoken word. Students also took their learning outside of the classroom, with trips to Boundless Adventures in Purchase, NY and the Discovery Science Center in Bridgeport, CT.\n\nThe ACTION program is made possible through the generous support of RCDS donors and our teachers, staff, and co-directors Jason Leath and Ethan White."
