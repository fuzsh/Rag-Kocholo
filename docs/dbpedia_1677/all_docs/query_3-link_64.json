        "text": "Tickets to the Film Festival on Sale Now\n\nDURHAM, July 21, 2022 — The Carolina Theatre of Durham presents the OUTSOUTH Queer Film Festival August 11-14.\n\nOUTSOUTH celebrates a worldwide glimpse of today’s LGBTQ+ life through entertaining and sophisticated films and filmmaking and helps bring the community together for a “Durham Signature Event,” the highest honor bestowed on a cultural event or attraction by Discover Durham.\n\nNot only has OUTSOUTH garnered local recognition, but the festival has also received national and international accolades by consistently being ranked as one of the “Top 10 Queer Film Festivals in the U.S.,” and being named one of “20 Fantastic LGBTQ+ Film Festivals Around the Globe,” by Moviemaker Magazine in 2021.\n\nBeginning in 1995 as QFest and running from 1996-2019 as the North Carolina Gay + Lesbian Film Festival (NCGLFF), the festival was renamed OUTSOUTH in 2020. The event has always featured a diverse array of shorts, documentaries and feature films, and this year will feature 18 feature films and 106 shorts films from 25 countries.\n\nThis year’s highlights include award-winning true crime documentary “Gemmel and Tim,” decade-spanning drama “Two Eyes,” and the star-studded comedy short “Brutal.”\n\n“OUTSOUTH is thrilled to return to an in-person format at the historic Carolina Theatre! The past two years as a virtual affair kept the festival going strong, but with an in person festival this year, we will once again have the opportunity to gather together,” says Chuck Wheeler, OUTSOUTH Queer Film Festival Coordinator. “We are a vibrant community of many voices, but we must remain as one in our fight against the recent challenges to our rights and liberties. OUTSOUTH reflects that statement, that is, both our diversity and our unity. There can be no turning back the clock.”\n\nIndividual tickets for the OUTSOUTH Queer Film Festival are $12.53 per film and 10 passes are $85. Individual tickets may be purchased online at carolinatheatre.org or at the theater’s box office. Passes will only be available at the box office.\n\nAn après-fest will follow the festival with re-screenings August 15-18.\n\nAbout The Carolina Theatre of Durham:\n\nCarolina Theatre of Durham, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which manages the city-owned Carolina Theatre at 309 W. Morgan Street, Durham, NC 27701.
