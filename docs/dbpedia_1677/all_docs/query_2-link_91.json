        "text": "A Mycenaean presence in the Northeast (NE)Aegean, especially at Troy, has been the topic of a number of scholarlypapers for many years. A Minoan presence, in contrast,especially on the littoral islands, has been acknowledged only recently and sheds new light on the whole region. Whereas even a permanent physical presence of Mycenaeans istaken almost for granted, the emerging picture of the degree and nature of Minoan involvement in the NE Aegean, as well as recent developments in the field of post-colonial studies, urges us to take a fresh look not only at how we deal with “Minoans” abroad, but also with “Mycenaeans” abroad, especially in consideration of the differing core-regions from which these groups began.Thispaper considers the interaction of the NE Aegean with Crete and the Greek Mainland as a process comprising several stages that reflect different degrees of involvement in Aegean networks. By commenting on the composite material culture assemblages, we approach the question of cultural dynamics fromseveral perspectives: from the consideration ofdirect interaction bya given community to a central-core area of the Aegean (and the consequent adoption and limitation of certain aspects of the foreign material culture), to the exploration of active selection, adoption, and adaptation of innovations. The incorporation of such innovations into the local landscape is evaluated along two lines: 1) to what extent thisis a “simple” adoption (emulation), and 2) to what extent it generates new (hybrid) material and social constructs with its own coherence (transculturation).\n\nMikhail Zenkevich (1886-1973), a poet, prose writer, literary critic, translator, and the longest surviving Acmeist, together with Vladimir Narbut (1888-1938), represented Adamism, the left wing of Acmeism. The association of these poets with Acmeism has been often referred to as one of a societal and rather conventional nature. Narbut, however, had no doubts about his own and his friend’s importance for Acmeism. In his letters to Zenkevich, he wrote, “I am sure, there are only two Acmeists: you and I”. Narbut called himself and Zenkevich “naturo-realisty” (“naturo-realists”) and “zemliaki” (“the earthly ones”), stressing their connections to Baudelaire, Gogol’, and Skovoroda but, at the same time, trying to dissociate themselves from the “older Acmeists.” Unlike their famous sojourners, “these minor Acmeists” have been under-read and under-studied. Their names were surrounded by controversy as critics have often viewed their literary activity through the negative prism of their service to the authorities, or in the light of their particular behaviour towards their Acmeist friends. Indeed, while propagating general Acmeist principles, such as the innovative treatment of the poetic word, deliberate craftsmanship, clear and concise imagery, creation of a new language and a new culture, Zenkevich and Narbut went in a direction quite different from the rest of Acmeists – namely, the one of extreme glorification of the earthly world in all its manifestations. They pronounced the coming of the “New Adam”, praised not only the life of the body itself, but also life in general, a life that “knows everything, – God, and vice, and death, and immortality” (Gumilev, 1968). A number of their works of Acmeist period is as an amalgamation of crude naturalism, explicit eroticism with unusual fantastic elements and displays, especially in Narbut’s case, an abundance of the ugly, the unnatural, and the deformed. In recent years, there has been a growth of interest in their poetry due to the newly published volumes of their selected verse, and a number of critical publications pertaining to their oeuvres. These are still rare in Russian and even scarcer in English. A detailed study of Zenkevich’s and Narbut’s literary biographies and their roles in the 20th-century literary process has, thus, become imminent. In my presentation, I will to provide an overview of Zenkevich’s poetry within and beyond Acmeism and pinpoint his works crucial for understanding of the role he played within it."
