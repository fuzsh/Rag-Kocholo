        "text": "Bringing back the sweltering sun of the hollywood basement, an everlasting American glow perpetuating an American (xclusive) dream of love and freedom. Giving you the pieces isn't cool though, overexpose it and blast it from your toaster speakers, that is the plan(attack), light and sound will beat you with sticks until you hand over your crumpled notes, now we buy the liquor. We won't need ears where we're going. One of the finest uses of loose narrative you'll ever see, reinventing as we move, filling up the never-ending mosaic. This is a thousand films to a thousand different people, the independent under-a-rock shot-through-a-fridge film aesthetic never looked better than when the canvas is the immortal landscapes of the American backdrop…\n\nA relative Benning novice (I've seen and hugely enjoyed Los and RR, not so much Twenty Cigarettes), but various mutterings digital's sapped his rigor may have some basis. Slightly less magisterial than the films I've seen but no less compositionally acute, Benning's views of Chicago and the Midwest strikingly well-composed. (One shot — the view of a plane landing from a sidewalk just before the runway — is repeated with slightly more gravitas in Los.) Read up on before and after, but — some half-recognizable faces aside — the aggressively caesura'd narrative eluded me. (Though Jonathan Rosenbaum's Benning write-up from 1983 seems to suggest that watching 8 x 11 first would help a lot.) Staggering shots throughout, but to single…\n\nIt’s difficult to explain the hold that Benning’s 70’s work has over me, although I suppose a good start might be to specify that my earliest memory of entering the Midwest (this taking place fairly recently - I have childhood memories of being in Chicago, but not getting there) is of approaching a massive smokestack east of Kansas City by train - Benning’s films are a mode of “being in” America that I am intimately familiar with and find deeply comforting. Like all of his 70’s movies, it’s self-similar variations on the same pet images and stagings - vehicles pass, factories belch pop tunes, dry conceptual gags are wordlessly told and trick shots abound, my favorite being a toss up…\n\n\"Seems like every time you turn around\n\nThere's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear\n\nAnd there's really nothing anyone can say\"\n\n--Black Diamond Bay, B. Dylan/Levy Jacques, 1975\n\nA lovely mish-mash of backgrounds, shambling actors in partial narratives, traffic, trains, strangers, bars (Mickey's on Thornton), a Chicago Cubs 3rd baseman punching his mitt in anticipation, Lesbian soft strokes in a basement bed where a new vinyl LP spins an accompanying screenplay. cows, giraffes, undercranked smokestacks of steam in the bluest of skies, motels, service station attendants, and a guy who can't keep his shirt on. It's up to us mostly, the story. That's if you think you need one. It's a road trip through the coming age and the…"
