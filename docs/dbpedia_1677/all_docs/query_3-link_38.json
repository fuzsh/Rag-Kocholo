        "text": "TheatreMaker (n): an artist who specializes in creating theatre as a whole, not focusing in only one area\n\nLearn about methods of theatrical storytelling, ignite a creative fire, and see the world through new eyes. In this innovative experience, young artists are invited to “explode stories,” looking at every aspect of the theatre development process, including performance, design, writing, building, and so much more.\n\nThese classes are for the young artist who loves creating – no prior theatre experience is necessary, but everyone from the seasoned professional to the newbie will learn, connect, and grow.\n\n2024 Theatremakers Summer Camps\n\nAsolo Rep Theatremakers Camps use theatrical skills from all elements of the artform to encourage campers to use their imaginations, to express their ideas, and to explore their world through theatre. Whether performing a story of their own design or developing a quest for characters they developed themselves, campers experience theatre from many different angles: performance, design, storybuilding, and collaboration.\n\nTheatremakers Summer Camps are available at two locations:\n\nAsolo Rep (June 24-August 9)\n\nOut of Door Academy (June 10-21).\n\nScroll down for more information."
