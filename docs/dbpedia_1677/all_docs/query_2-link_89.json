And of course, throughout this 500 years there were \"wars and rumors of wars\"; crises and tidings of impending doom, contrived by numerous power-mad Little Men. reigning or ruling with or without the consent of their fellowmen, as King, Lord Protector. Prime Minister, Chancellor, Reichs- fuehrer. Dictator, Generalissimo. President and Indispensable Man. All soon to be forgotten in the shining light of those everlasting per- sonalities, such as Moses, the great law giver; Jesus Christ, the humble Christian; Washington, the modest saviour of the New World, and Mahatma Gandhi, who proved that freedom can be won without war. While the power-mad Little Men have all gone â we hope â to their just deserts, they have left behind a new secret army of our most insidious enemies â the tax collectors. The biblical extortioner of the \"poore wyddowe's myte\" was magnani- mous compared to the suave, artful Machiavellian of this age, who bores like a termite, many times, into every segiment of industrial and social life. for a \"David\" to slay this arch-enemy before he and his tribe suckle the life-breath of our Industrial Freedom.

Fol. 62. can be found the following: 'Robert Attwater, with his wife Isabella, brings an Assize of Novel Dissiezin, . . . touching tenements in Rotherhethe.\" The above mentioned property was located on the south bank of the Thames, two and one-quarter miles south-east from St. Paul's Church. London. Another interesting notation associated with our family name and also establishing the family relationship with \"Ickford,\" is found in a folio pub- lished in the 16th Century and called Nomina Villariim. This volume con- tained the names of Cities, Boroughs, Villages, and Hundreds, including therewith the lords of all the manors throughout all the counties of England from the year 1316 to 1559. including: \"Johannes Atte Water certified pursuant to writ tested at Clipston. 5 March, 1316. as one of the Lords of the Township of Ickford. in the county of Bucks.\" We also find in the History of Buckinghamshire. Vol. I. the following interesting Attwater references: \"Ickford, Hickford. Iksford (in Saxon, Teemzaford. from a watery way or passage through the Thames. ) \"Robert Earl, of Morton, half-brother of William. The Conqueror (1066- 1087 A.D.I granted this manor, with Marsh, to the Abbey of Grestein. founded by Harlewin de Conteville. his father, and Ickford was by the Abbot and Convent granted to a family deriving its name from this place. . . . How long Grestein Abbey continued to enjoy the estate in Ickford is unknown, but having been seized by the Crown during the Wars of Edward II. (deposed by Parliament January 7, 1327) and again restored, it was a second time forfeited and family of Ickford is no longer mentioned, unless their descendants are to be identified with persons denominated Atte Water de Ickford, who afterward possessed a considerable estate here.\" \"William Atte Water de Ickford died in 1311. seized of the Manor of Great Ickford, held of the King in capite. and in 1325 Nicholas Ryhall.

Christopher had four sons and a daughter, Joanna, who married Stephen Cooke. Their children brought in the Atwood and Best families. But we are only concerned with John Attwater, who married Susan Narsin. Of this union, there were three children â Joshua, Ann and David, who were to be the first Attwaters to land in and assist in a very important part of colonizing a portion of the New World. Father John neglected to leave a will â dying in October 1636. Susan, mother of Joshua, had him appointed to administer the estate. Three months later, Susan died during January of 1637. She was buried next to John in the Lenhani Church yard. Burrialls \"Nov. 1 (1636) John Attewatter. pater familias. \"Jan. 9 (1637) Susan Attewatter. Wid.\" The register also shows Marriages and Christenings. Under the latter heading during the period from 'Michaelmas, 1610, unto Michaelmas, 1611' there is the following entry: \"June 2. Josuae, the sonne of John Attwater. \"George Hudson, Vicar \"Thomas Heriman Churchwardens.\" \"William At-Water The administration papers indicate that Josuae, at the age of twenty-six was a 'Mercer' in Ashford. a market town near Lenham. Now, these, our direct ancestors, Joshua, David and Ann Attwater, embarked on 'The Great Adventure.' Beginning with that unpredictable, long and treacherous ocean voyage, of many weeks, to eventually found a different habit in the 'New World.' which would be temporarily referred to as the 'Republic of Newhauen.' There is much speculation but no authentic data as to why and how our Attwater ancestors joined up with the Davenport-Eaton Expedition. While their parents had passed away during the year, Joshua and David must have been part of this cabal for a considerable time. Apparently Joshua was a man of capital in his own right, while David had recently inherited several properties from an Attwater relative. So it was natural for John Davenport to seek out these young men of capital to help finance his expedition. He had recently returned from the Continent â it is said â disguised with a long beard. Be that as it may, he was a non-conformist at odds with the authorities, in which our Attwaters must have joined. Ashford was the seat of this group of non-conformists. So it is reasonable to suppose that Joshua induced his brother and many from the market town to join the expedition. It is reported that the Expedition included over two hundred men, women and children.

The first act of the 'Seven' was to decide that the 'right of suffrage shall be conferred on church members only.' On the 22nd of August 1639, the 'Seven' had 'instituted the Church by a solemn and formal covenant one with another.' On the 25th of October, they granted the right of suffrage to 'all those that have been received into the fellowship of this Church, since the gathering of it, or who being members of approved churches, offer themselves.' In this manner, the 'Republic of Newhauen' was organized, with the election of Theophilus Eaton, Magistrate for the term of one year. Robert Newman. Matthew Gilbert, Nathaniel Turner and Thomas Fugill were closen Deputies 'to assist the Magistrate in all Courts called by him for the occasions of the plantation, for the term of one year.' Thomas Fugill was appointed Secretary and Robert Seeley as Marshal for the Colony. After the 'Townsite' had been laid out by John Brockett, house lots had been given to each of 'The Planters,' according to his or her family size and the amount of taxes each one was willing to pay. In General Assembly during January of 1640, it was ordered that the land outside the 'two-mile-square.' be divided and taxed as follows: '. . . all the upland in the first division, with all the meadows in the plantation, yielding to the public treasury four pence an acre yearly, and all the land in the second division two pence an acre yearly.' On the first day of September 1640. by order of the 'Court.' the name of the settlement was changed from Quinnipiac to New Haven. It must be remembered that this 'Church State' had been organized by a superior, Puritan culture group, with a background of literary London. It was the hey-day of Shakespeare, Spencer, Thomas Dekker and Ben Johnson. A few of the 'Separatists' had fled to Holland. The great majority stood their ground and the 'New World' gave many their chance for freedom.

'And by his order safely kept in the stocks till he might be brought to a due tryall. 'And the Indian who had attempted his escape was whipped by the marshall his deputy.' 'The Quillipieck Indian Sagamour\" on the following day. 'wth diurs of his Indians wth him were examined before the magistrate and the deputyes for this plantatio concerning Nepaupuck. They generally accused him to haue murdered one or more of the English, and that he had cutt of some of their hands & had presented them to Sassacuse the Pequott sachem, boasting thatt he had killed them wth his owne hands. Mewhebato a Quillipieck Indian, kinsman to the aforesaid Nepaupuck, comeing att the same time to interceed for him was examined: . . . att first he pretended ignorance, butt wth a distracted countenance, and in a trembling manner: being admonished to speake the truth he did acknowledge him guilty according to the charge the other Indians had before made. 'AH the other Indians withdrawing, Nepaupuck was brought in and examined, he confessed that Nepaupuck was guilty, . . . but denyed thatt he was Nepaupuck. Mewhebato . . . charged him to his face after some signes of sorrow, thatt he had assisted the Pequotts in murdering the English, this somewhatt abated his speritt and boldenesse; butt Wattoone the sonne of Carrahoode a councellor to the Quillipieck Indian sagamour comeing in, charged him more perticularly thatt he had killed Abraham Finch an English man att Weathersfield and thatt he himselfe. the said Wattoone. stood vpon the island att Weathersfield and beheld him the said Nepaupauk now present acting the murder.' 'Nepaupuck being by the concurrence of testimony convinced, he con- fessed he was the man namelt Nepaupuck. and boasted he was a great captaine, had murdered Abraham Finch, and had his hands in other English blood, he said he knew he must dye, and was nott afraid of itt. butt layd his neck to the matletree of the chimmey, desireing thatt his head might be cutt of. or thatt he might dye in any other manner the English should appoynt, onely he said fire was God, and God was angry wth, therefore he would not fall into his hands. After this he was retourned to the stocks and as before a watch appoynted for his safe custody.' At 'Generall Courte' on the third day. . . . Finally. Nepaupuck. 'confedded thatt he had his hand in the murder of Abraham Finch, butt yett he said there was a Mohauke of thatt name thatt had killed more then bee. Wattoone affirmed to his face thatt he, the said Nepaupuck. did nott onely kill Abraham Finch, butt was one of them thatt killed the 3 men in the boate or shallop on Connectecutt riuer and thatt there was but one Nepaupuck and this was he, and that same thatt tooke a childe of Mr. Swaines att Wethersfield. Then the said Nepaupuck being asked if he would not confess yt he deserved to dye. he answered, it is weregin. The Court haue had such pregnant proofe. proceeded to pass sentence vpon him according to the nature of the fact and the rule in thatt case, he thatt sheds mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed, accordingly his head was cutt off the next day and pittched vpon a pole in the markett place.'

Training in the Market-Place and keeping watch were two duties of all Church-Court members, unless exempt. \"\"John Benham informed the courte that he was fined by the courte for neglecting to warn Dauid Attwater to watch. It was by the secretarie that then was, entred 5s, but it was but 2s:6d, and seing diners doe remember it was but 2s:6d. the courte agreed that he should paye no more.\" \"Dauid Attwater entred an action against Mathias Hitchcocke, for 10 pounds wch the said Mathias Hitchcocke receaved of Dauid Atwatter, for the service of Thomas Whitehead for four years and eighte moneths, wch Mathias Hitchcocke could not performe. he not haueing a full right to dispose of the saide Thomas . . . but now the said Thomas declareth himeselfe willing to abide w'h his master David Atwatter, till he maye heare from his vnkell, so he maye haue just satisfaction for the time to come, so longe as he stayeth wth hime. They bothe agreed before the courte. that he should haue 3 pounds a yeare, meate, drinke and clothes.\" \"David Atwater, Richard Mansfield, is to finde each of them a man to watch at the towne in regarde of ther house lots heare.\" Why the 'Courte' required owners of vacant house lots, to supply a man for watch is beyond our comprehension. This original precaution was insti- gated to be ready for any emergency. However, our Colonists were more fearful of the Dutch than the Indians or other catastrophy. There was a fight with the Dutch over Stamford. \"The Dutch authorities at New Amsterdam reported to their superiors in Holland that 'Rodenberg' or New Haven, contained, eleven years after it was founded, about 1,340 families. But, though affirmed of New Haven town, it must have been . . . their informant's estimate of the population of the Colony.\" He died in 1692. He had out-lived most of the original planters who arrived on the Hector in 1637. David's farm â known as Attwater East Farms â was on the west side of Quinnipiac or New Haven. The Colleg-iate School Later to be known as Yale College On Christmas Day, in 1641, at Town Meeting, a proposal was made to establish 'schools for all, where the rudiments of knowledge might be gained, schools where learned languages might be taught: a public library: and to crown all, a college in which young might be fitted for public service in Church and State.' Livermore states in his 'Republic of New Haven': 'Schools, public and private, which were always maintained in New Haven, probably found their prototypes and models in the collegia which existed or had existed, in the mother towns of Ashford, Coventry and London.'

At this time. New Haven was part of Connecticut. Seven of the ministers came from sections that had formed the original 'New Haven Republic' It was natural, therefore, with the Rev. James Pierpont as leader, that New Haven was choosen. as the site for the college, by the majority. As remarked by one member of the Assembly: 'We on purpose gave your academy as low a name as we could, that it might better stand in wind and weather.' The Trustees met at Saybrook and organized on November 11. 1701. Jacob Heminway was the first student. The first graduate was Nathaniel Chauncey of Stratford. Eight students registered under one tutor in Septem- ber of 1702. During the next fourteen years much discord arose thru the lack of proper meeting arrangements. In the beginning, students were forced to travel to Milford to Pierson's home. And in the second rector's period, the home of Samuel Andrew had to be visited for lectures. At the last commence- ment held in Saybrook (1716) the only tutor resigned. Students were distributed throughout the entire Colony.

Now let us review the facts to ascertain the truth or absurdity of this claim. The Collegiate School had been in existence for many years before Elihu Yale made any response to the numerous requests that had been made for his assistance. As an Atwater descendant, you shciLl know that Elihu was the third child of David \\ale, one of the original planters of the New Haven Colony. Apparently, David Yale must have considered the 'Church-State hierarchy' in New Haven not to his liking, as we find him established in Boston as early 1641. And there is no doubt about his civil and religious difficulties in the home of the 'bean and the cod.' Not being in sympathy with local laws, nor religious dogma of the colonists, David took personal action, as a member of the established Church of England. Inducing six others to join him, a revolutionary petition was presented to the General Court of Massa- chusetts Bay. The appellants objected to the 'non-admission to the churches, of those who acknowledged the established religion of England, and at the non-participation of the inhabitants, who were not members of the colony church, in the management of civil affairs, as voters and office holders.' 'The authorities of Massachusetts' were not ready for such a revolu- tionary change. The petition's most offensive clause was a threat of appeal to the parliamentary government in England. And they were not satisfied with a carefully drawn argument but included a fine of $600. which David Yale had to pay. He returned to England in 1651. His second son. Elihu, born in Boston on April 5. 1649, returned with his mother and brother David, to England in 1652. As a young gentleman, Elihu lived thru one of the most turbulent periods of England's checkered history. There was the rise and fall of Oliver, Croniwell's regime; the Restoration; the plague and the Great Fire. It was also the heyday of Milton. Dryden, Jeremy Taylor, Richard Baxter, George Fox and Wm Penn. The East Indian Company racket, which had been established by a grant from that notorious Elizabeth, the First, now attracted the interest of Elihu Yale. The interesting story of his reign, as Governor, for five years, at Madras, accumulating a fortune of '500,000 pagodas'; his removal from office by the Company; and numerous trials, including one for murder\"; does not picture 'the founder of Yale' as a very worthy hero for such an honor. ( â \" Had one of his grooms hung for riding a favorite horse of his without permission. ) It was thru the efforts of Jeremiah Dummer, agent in London, for Province of Massachusetts Bay and the Colony of Connecticut, that Gov. Yale became interested in the Collegiate School. During 1711, Mr. Dummer wrote the Rev. James Pierpont, the actual founder of Yale College, suggesting the possibility of securing funds from the 'former Governor of Fort St. George.'

Mr. 22 ATWATER GENEALOGY Dummer. despite his justifiable pleas, failed to induce the heirs to recognize it as a valid legacy. The Yale Genealogy refers, here and there, to the Governor's marital status. While Elihu married Catharine Elford Hynmers at Madras, in 1680, the Genealogy 'admits â that he also was living' there, \"in immoral relations with a Mrs. Nicks and a Mrs. Pavia. the latter a Portuguese Jewess.' Mrs. Hynmers is described as 'a copper-colored native of India.' But recent his- torians have placed Mrs. Hynmers as English, even though they admit she might have been Portuguese and a Jewess! There were many men, during those early years of the Collegiate School, who gave much time and substance to the success of the College project: Joshua Attwater. John Davenport. Governor Hopkins and many others. And finally, there was the Rev. James Pierpont. who influenced the Assembly. managed the Trustees, with perseverance and diplomacy, and finally brought about the action that culminated in the building in New Haven. Rev. James Pierpont should have been recognized as the founder of Yale. The name 'Yale College' was changed to 'Yale University' in 1887, by authority of the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut. The Charter Oak Incident Until about 1658 New Haven had apparently not given much thought to obtaining a charter from England, but about that time some thought was given this matter. It did not seem too urgent and as the situation in England at that time was not favorable the matter was dropped. About 1660 the Connecticut colony, which comprised of Hartford, Windsor, and Wethersfield, felt that it was highly desirable that a charter be obtained, giving them title to the land they had settled. Consequently in July. 1661 their Governor. John Winthrop. Jr. was sent to England to attempt to obtain a charter for Connecticut. On his way he stopped at New Haven to discuss the matter with its leaders. There appears to be no record of any understanding having been reached, but there seems reason to believe that New Haven's Governor. William Leete, was in favor of having the Charter include both colonies, Winthrop was successful in obtaining a favorable charter from King Charles II in 1662. However, when the New Haven Colony learned that it embraced both the Connecticut and New Haven colonies, much opposition was voiced and an appeal was made to the King. By late 1664 much of the opposition had been quieted and certain compromises made by both colonies so that on December 13, 1664 New Haven held its last Court, for the purpose of terminating the colony.

He was probably a married man at the time of his emigration, as his family is numbered as two persons in the list of planters. If this be so, he soon lost his wife, for he married Mary Blackman, the daughter of a clergyman in Stratford, May 6, 1651, by whom he had two sons and one or more daughters . . . Previous to 1665, or early in that year, he removed to Boston, as in a deed dated in that year, by which he conveyed to his brother David his house and lands in New Haven, he describes himself as 'Joshua Atwater of Boston, New England.' \"If it be true that the family of Joshua in the male line became extinct, all in America who bear the name of Atwater are descendants of David. None have yet been found who could not trace their lineage, by means of this register, to him.\" This 1851 volume lists six males in the second generation, seventeen in the third, thirty-four in the fourth, and fifty-four in the fifth generations. In the 1871 revision of this document the compiler adds a few items of family history, but in a very modest way. The Rev. Mr. Atwater visited England twice during the later years of his life, once in 1875 and again in 1887, with a purpose \"to ascertain with as much exactness as possible what relation of consanguininity there was between Robert Atwater of Royton Chapel and the other Atwaters in his neighborhood. My first study was of the diocesan register at Canterbury. As my eyes ran over the list of baptisms in Lenham, my attention was arrested by the name of Anthony Thompson ... I recognized the name as belonging to one of my ancestors . . . But what was my surprise to find . . . that the blood of the Atwaters and the Thompsons, which had become commingled in my own veins . . . had been commingled two centuries before in the veins of Anthony Thompson, whose mother was, I believe, the granddaughter of Robert Atwater of Royton Chapel.\" Edward E. began the compilation of the record of descent of the Atwaters in England in the expectation that he might publish his findings, but he died before the task was well under way. It was advanced by Robert Henry Atwater of Washington, D. C. and published by Francis Atwater of New Haven. Reverend Edward, however, wrote several volumes, one at least on a theological subject, and two valued volumes, one on the history of the New Haven Colony ( 1880) and the other on the History of the City of New Haven (1887). He must have had a prodigious memory and he proved a delightful companion as he made contacts with members of the family in his travels. (See Atwater History. Vol. 1, Pg. 432-436, for Rev. Amzi Atwater's account of a trip in and near New Haven in 1880 with Edward E.) â IMWMgnnxp mimmmtimmmimmumnlmmimmmmmmmm I WU I MWHU (liEi^EALOGlUAL MIJiSIER lil':8(;EMÂ»AAT8 li\\ lilE MALE LINE or DAVID ATWATER, ON P. or (; 1 N A L 1' !, A .\\ TEKS <A NEW HAVF\"^' ^''^w TO Till F I r T II a r. s jK ii a t i <Â» ^ KD BV J ; I Â« 28 ATWATER GENEALOGY This opportunity afforded to the writer to review the record of Rev. Edward E. Atwater has made him appreciate more than ever the debt which those who bear this name owe him as the first systematic compiler of the family records. It took much time and faithful research to produce the volume of 1851. Today that volume seems primitive in contrast with the latest volumes about the family like this one and those published by Francis Atwater. But such a genealogical record was not born in a day. Only patient and per- severing work produced the very adequate record which we and our children now enjoy. Edward E. chose to begin his studies at a time when priceless records and memories were failing. Let us hope that in our generation there may be others with similar industry to carry on the task. â Reginald M. Atwater, M.D. Clara Barton A Friend of the Family The present generation of Atwaters will have little acquaintance with the esteem in which phrenologists were once held. In the period of say 1830 to 1860 they were popularly believed to possess scientific powers and to be able to prescribe the best line of endeavor for one to pursue. In an impressive manner the phrenologist would \"examine\" the person before him, announce his characteristics, and advise which had best be developed and which corrected. Such a one was L. W. Fowler who. when on a visit to the home of Stephen and Sarah Barton at Oxford. Massachusetts, was asked what their daughter Clara, ought to do in life, answered., \"The sensitive mature will always remain. She will never assert herself for herself; she will suffer wrong first. But for others she will be perfectly fearless. Throw respon- sibility upon her.\" Fowler's advice was that she should become a school teacher. Perhaps other children of fifteen have had expressed the manner in which their character could develop in future years but this prophesy was to be fulfilled through a lifetime of service to others that is outstanding. Here was a woman who was destined to 'stand before Kings' and receive the honors of many countries. No American born in the 1920's can live to know as many presidents as knew her and gave her praise. Born on Christmas Day in 1821 she was in her 60th year when the American Red Cross was formed and was 83 when she retired. A small, erect person, only five feet tall, she preserved a remarkably youthful manner until well beyond the years when many would have been saving their energy. In Miss Barton's efforts to assist families in tracing soldiers who had been reported missing after battles in the South, she was assisted by Dorence ATWATER GENEALOGY 29 Atwalti nl I (I I \\ \\ illf.

During the late 12tli ant! throughout the entire 30 ATWATER GENEALOGY 13th centuries arms appeared increasingly on shields. Within a short time most of the great houses in England and upon the Continent were displaying them. ' ^ ^ Writers attribute the sudden emergency of heraldry at this time to the need of knights and lords for some mark of identification. When they were in full armor, they were unrecognizable. Few could read so instead of usmg a nanieplate each man adopted a distinctive insignia, known as a \"coat of arms.\" He displayed this on his shield, banner and horsecloth, as well as on his coat, and wore it in civil life as well. The hereditary character of heraldry owed its existence to the feudal social system in which society on its secular side was held together by personal allegiance of each man to his lord. The coat of arms became not only a symbol of the owner's identity but also his status as well. The great increase in the number of coats of arms eventually made some kind of control necessary. By the end of the 13th century, about 1.500 arms had been adopted in England. Evidence points out that in the 14th century ownership of arms had acquired legal recognition. By the 15th century, it became the duty of the \"King of Heralds,\" later known as the Kmg of Arms and also the Garter, to register the arms of noble gentlemen and still later to give patents of arms to applicants. The King of Arms or Garter was assisted by a number of heralds. The output of patents steadily mcreased from the reign of Henry VI to that of Elizabeth, after which there began some decline. Those to whom patents to coats of arms were issued were corporate bodies, higher ecclesiastics and all classes of new men. How- ever, with the discontinuance of tournaments and the change in the character of war. emphasis in the use of heraldry shifted from military to civilian use. During the Tudor period, the symbolic use of arms at funeral increased while Its use in war diminished. With the passing of the Tudors, heraldic art generally declined. The English and Continentals drew upon the entire animal kingdom and garden for heraldic devices. Some of the more common were the lion, leopard, stag, wolf, eagle, falcon, the rose, fish, fleur-de-lys, swan and the ass head! Other well-known devices from other sources frequently used were the sun, crescent, mullet, escallup, shells and sheaths of grass. In certain instances' the wearers selected symbols suggesting their names. Examples of these are as follows: The House of Griffon bore the griffin The House of Drake bore the fire-drake or dragon The Cockfields bore silver three cocks gules The Pelhams bore azure three pelicans silver The Lucys bore gules three luces (or pikes) silver The Herons bore azure three herons silver The three swans, likewise, in the Atwater coat of arms, together with the wavy bars, suggest 'Svater,\" ATWATER GENEALOGY 31 Certain cii^Imhi- div cloind in |Iic u^r n| ihc cu;!! of arm<.

Unrelated families, therefore, who have the same surname are given a dissimilar plain coat of arms. The Atwater coat of arms was worn on several important State occasions in the history of England. It is first recorded as being borne by John Water, York Herald at Arms, at the funeral of King Edward IV in 1483. His arms were described as \"sable, on a fesse wavy argent, between three swans of the second, two bars, wavy azure, crest a demi-talbot argent, in the mouth an arrow gules.\" These arms belonged to the \"Atwaters of Kent.\" with variations of the fesse for difference. The arms with the same crest were confirmed to Robert Atwater of Kent by Clarencieux Harvey in 1564. with ''the colors of the crest being transposed for difference.\" Robert Atwater being without male heirs, it is found that his daughter Mary, who married Robert Hony- wood, inherited several of her father's manors and bore his coat of arms. At the entrance of one of the Honywood manor houses, a contemporary writer in the late 16th century described the carved quarterings of the family's arms. One of these was the \"Sable, wavy, bendy, of four, in fesse argent, between three swans proper, for Waters.\" In preparing this article, the writer obtained his information from the following: Oswald Barron, F.S.A., Volume 13 The Encyclopedia Britannica, 11th Edition (New York. 1910): Anthony Wagner, Heraldry in England (Baltimore. 19511 : Iain Moncreiffe of Easter Moncreiife and Don Pottinger, Simple Heraldry (London. 1953 Â»: C.

Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster.

In order to satisfy the demands of the growing population and incidentallv meet the superior requirements of some of the more 'Opulent' members of the Colony, it was found necessary to go far afield to meet these demands. Ships that were built in the Colony were soon sailing the seven seas. In order to appreciate the extent of these enterprising traders, one should read the account of my direct ancestor. Jonathan, seventh son of David the First. Known as 'The Merchant Prince of New England,' Jonathan traded throughout the world. His will, as outlined on pages 99 to 110. of Atwater History of 1901, proves his diversified and far-reaching contacts. ATWATER GENEALOGY 33 Facctimislx .
