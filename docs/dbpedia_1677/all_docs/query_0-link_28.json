        "text": "For narrative, for sure anything goes. If you worked on those films in your post above, what camera and lighting did you use? If those aren't your work, perhaps post some examples from vimeo.com/path88/videos?\n\nHere's a GH4 example which I feel shows good skin tones (Natural profile, Panasonic 12-35 F2.8 lens), overcast with indirect reflected brown light:\n\n5D3 RAW, 24-105 F4L, LCW Fader ND v1, overcast daylight, processed with ACR+AE (color shifts during playback courtesy of ACR):\n\nA7S, stock PP6, Sony 18200 lens, LCW Fader ND v1, overcast daylight (poster image; different lenses, light throughout video):\n\nIn the first video, the skin looks good with a warm/orange tint. In the second video, skin looks pinker (more magenta; higher color temp source light, though it sometimes swings to green due to ACR), and to my eye (and the actor's) natural and pleasing. The final video (poster) looks good on it's own, but when compared to the 5D3 and GH4 looks greener though still pleasing (during playback there's magenta bias, green bias, yellow bias, etc.). Now viewing these images on different monitors will make some look better and some look worse, depending on which way out of calibration they go. For example, on a monitor with too much green, the middle video (still frame) will look less magenta but still good, however the bottom video (still frame) will look too green and less pleasing.\n\nI'm still learning and appreciate feedback from every angle. It's art so some will like and some won't. What is helpful is understanding why.\n\nAfter shooting and editing extensively with the 5D3 (H.264 + RAW), Sony FS700, GH4, and A7S, based not only on my personal opinion, but on feedback from actors/models/clients, cameras which produce better skin tones are preferred. I found this out by shooting the same scenes with multiple cameras and reviewing the results with others. Doing research online I found that skin tones were the single most important element for cameras used to make money. Resolution, frame rates, viewfinders, ergonomics, etc., are all very important too, but skin tones are number one. Skin tones affect emotion, and emotion is used to tell a story or sell a product.\n\nWhat cameras provide the best skin tones? ARRI and Canon. What cameras are used the most professionally? ARRI and Canon. What cameras are used the most in Oscar winning films (last few years)? ARRI. What DSLR was used most in feature films? Canon (5D, 7D, 1D): http://shotonwhat.com/?s=5D. Why did the C100/C300 far outsell/outrent the FS700, even though the FS700 has way more features (and can even look full frame with a SpeedBooster)? C100/C300 produce better skin tones with less effort.\n\nIn the end, it's possible to get similar, sometimes even better (rare/unusual lighting conditions) skin tones from the GH4 and A7S vs. the 5D3, however on average, the 5D3 requires a lot less time and work.\n\nHow do we know when skin tones are better, when it's so subjective? Shoot the same scene with multiple cameras then show the results to multiple people for feedback. Some DPs do a ton of testing to figure this out before shooting a feature: http://www.hurlbutvisuals.com/blog/2013/10/arri-alexa-vs-canon-c500/\n\nYes, FuzzyNormal, I wouldn't say ever had a \"problem\" with skin tones until I shot some RAW with a Canon 50D. That is, most video had a \"video\" look which I felt I was stuck with. But RAW changed everything for me. Then I went to an EOS-M, then a BMPCC and feel that both camera deliver great looks. I never get tired of RAW (just the workflow). Anyway, I've always wanted the nice crisp image, small file sizes, and video ergonomics of Panasonic cameras. What happened is that I wanted the high dynamic range, flat look, of my BMPCC with the GH4. So I used Cine-D and dialed down the contrast and changed the hue TOO MUCH. What I didn't realize is that the low-contrast look I was getting was AT THE EXPENSE of color, which meant the skin tones went to crap. So I can understand how this problem seems silly to you Fuzzy because you don't shoot RAW, far as I know, and you haven't pushed the GH4 too far as I did (and should have known better). The good thing for me, is that it has awaken me to much of the stuff JCS has been writing about for a long time here. I agree with him, people are biologically sensitive to good skin tone. If you're doing a very busy video, with many cuts, and high contrast, etc., you don't notice. But if you're going for a natural look it ain't easy. If you take a family member, and sit them down for an \"interview\" where the person has to look at their face for minutes on end I think you'll go through the same thing as other people--the image may not do justice to the person in front of you.\n\nI was recently at the Shane Hurlbut tour thing and all day long he used Canon cameras, which, obviously have nice colors, but to me it looks like TV, high end TV. Then later in the day he switched to a BMCC without telling us and I was like damn, that looks awesome. It instantly looked more like a movie to me. Canon probably had better skin tones, but the BMCC looked more cinematic to me, which I realize is very subjective.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I agree with Fuzzy. I think you choose the camera/lens combo that give you the look your after. If your shooting a glamour piece or beautiful people TV show, go with a Canon. If you're looking for an edgier look maybe a Sony or Blackmagic will get you there.\n\nEDIT: In the end, though, I think your audience wants to be engaged in the story or content, and I just don't feel like the skin tones are going to make or break that, unless they're way off. And all of the above cameras can get you there if used properly, and post can help too.\n\nIt's like Jonesy said, once you shoot RAW (like BM), it makes you fall in love with a certain look. At least me. Again, Fuzzy, I never said the color was bad with my GM1, for example. Again, the problem I had, and which I believe others have had is You do some RAW shooting, love it, then try to get that flat look in 8-bit, and end up ruining your colors, by using data to capture DR (at the expense of color depth), which is noticeable when you shoot faces because we're biologically sensitive to complexion. The great thing about the GX7 and GM1 is they don't have Cine-D\n\nYou're playing devil's advocate a bit here I didn't say that we have a biological need to see faces with a certain color / skin-tone. Many films have a look that are not \"natural\" but the \"fake\" colors achieve an emotional effect. What I said is that in a setting where the viewer expects the person to look a certain way they are sensitive to colors that are off. That's why JCS explained how he could get background colors one way but they ruined the skin tones, or the other way around. Skin tone is about context. If you're shooting everything with a GX7 no one is going to notice the skin tones. Consistency always works. However, if you were to mix that footage with BM footage, say, there's a good chance you would prefer the RAW but wouldn't be able to get the GX7 to match it. You would be able to get the RAW to match the GX7, but then you'd lose what you liked in the image in the first place. AGAIN, if the viewer doesn't know better, no harm no foul!\n\nFuzzy, sorry if my posts are coming off pedantic. You're making a case that skin tones aren't that important. I'm providing many facts (which you can verify for yourself) to make the case that skin tone color is indeed the most import element in your thread \"the skin tone holy grail\". Back when the 5D3 was released the big issue was it was too soft. I showed that with post sharpening it was pretty good (lots of folks disagreed; many felt post-sharpening was invalid and the camera should be sharp straight from the camera). I spent a lot of time looking for a camera that provided better native resolution and went with the FS700 when the SpeedBooster came out. After many projects with feedback from many people, it was clear that people preferred the look of the Canon over the Sony. There were indeed comments on the 5D3 being too soft for some shots, but overall people love the look of the 5D3 over the FS700+SB. The FS700 still provides value with up to 240fps 1080p (ish) slomo.\n\nAs I read about lots of different cameras, the recurring pattern for what people love the most is skin tones. We are emotional beings and we evolved color vision, at least in part, to read emotion through skin tone color. Researching the best cameras, I found the same pattern: they produce skin tones which evoke a positive emotional response: \"I like it.\" \"I love it!\". In narrative and commercials too, color sets the mood, helps tell the story, and conveys emotion at a deep level.\n\nHi Jonesy- Blackmagic cameras have indeed gotten good reports for skin tones, though I haven't used them. A big part of the filmic look is highlight behavior of the camera/sensor and even more important: lighting for narrative (emotion). I have started paying very careful attention to scenes that look really 'filmic'. Even that ARRI Alexa and Red Dragon can look 'videoish' with bright lighting and resulting harsh highlights. Combine such lighting with an oversharp image and you've got the video look. Notice how often narrative scenes have very little lighting, with the most lighting on the face and eyes.\n\nThe challenge I've had with Sony cameras, especially the FS700, is that after setting proper WB and exposure, even tweaking WB in post (including 3-way), parts of the face can look good/correct, but other parts are too yellow/orange/green/blue and don't look right. So now you have to do secondary color correction for those areas. Time consuming. The final results tend not to look as good as Canon or Panasonic. The A7S is better, but still requires more work vs. the 5D3 or GH4. For video, in my experience Panasonic cameras work pretty well for skin tones, to the point that I didn't worry about them. They just worked. For stills, in my experience Canon looks much better than Panasonic. It wasn't until using Sony cameras and getting feedback from others regarding skin tones that I started looking at skin tones in more detail.\n\nI was curious why so many top productions used ARRI cameras when it was only 2.8K/3.4K max resolution. The result of much reading was that ARRI provides the best color and skin tones. How do we know it's the best? We look at what people use when cost is not an issue, which cameras were used in the top grossing/award-winning films, etc. This lead to learning more about color and skin tones.\n\nSo while many cameras can look great, cameras which look great with the least effort are the most useful and cost effective. It's also why Canon drives Andrew crazy releasing cameras with very limited features which outsell all the other brands with more features. Canon hasn't had to compete on features so much as they compete mostly on (skin tone) color.\n\nYou always use post, but the material you take into post affects where you can go, and how far.\n\nCanon starts off very over warm, but there's a lot of wiggle room to remove that, so I like it. With others I find it hard to convincingly add that warmth if I want it, so I like Canon quite a lot.\n\nArri just nailed it for natural \"do anything go anywhere\" skin, amazing. So really the Alexa and Amira are the winners, at a price. That's one reason why so much film, TV, advertising, drama, so much everything are shot on them.\n\nRed is good too, though there's sometimes a funny green/magenta tint that I find hard to knock out in a consistent way in post. I find it less forgiving.\n\nSony is very cool feeling but quite Kodak'y so not at all bad I don't think, just different. The rest I don't really have the experience to call.\n\nThat's my two pence from my experience, but YMMV of course!"
