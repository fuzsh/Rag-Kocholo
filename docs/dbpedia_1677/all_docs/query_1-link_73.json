They knew each other since they were 3, and ever since their first date at 10th grade in McDonald’s, Shane knew that Lydia was the woman he was going to marry.\n\nInitially, Shane didn’t even want to be a DOP, he thought he was going to be a producer, being very persuasive and good with money. However, he had to face the rough reality after freshly graduating from college.\n\nIndeed, so many young people think that great job opportunities are served on a silver platter right after they graduate, but that’s not what it takes to be successful. It’s a long journey and you need to start small and work really hard.\n\nShane’s first job in the film industry was far from the spotlight. He had to pack film trucks first, then he started driving those trucks, and it was for his huge amount of energy that he got a chance higher up the ladder – be a truck driver for a B-horror-film producer.\n\n➡ Don’t stop exploring and saying “yes” to opportunities that come up your way. And always bear in mind that the environment you choose, the people you surround yourself with will start to define you.\n\n➡ Shane went through being a jock, to DJ-ing, to studying “Mass Communication” before he started considering film as a career path, and every venture he took made him learn more about himself and what he wanted to do.\n\nAs you can see, we had a thrilling episode with lots of inspiring stories, especially for our younger or just-starting-up-with-new-career readers. In part two, we will share some of the work principles that Shane learned while working on many sets with hundreds of people in different departments. How do you manage that?"
