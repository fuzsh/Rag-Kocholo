        "text": "with Pacific Symphony\n\nOverview\n\n✮✮✮✮✮\n\n'EXHILARATING AND RAVISHINGLY EXPRESSIVE'\n\n- The Guardian\n\n“Hypnotic” - TimeOut\n\nYou know it is Spring when the superstar dancers of American Ballet Theatre are home at Segerstrom Center performing a never-before-seen-program.\n\nFollowing in the tradition of such critical and creative successes as Whipped Cream, Of Love and Rage, and Like Water for Chocolate, we are thrilled to announce ABT will be performing the North American premiere of Woolf Works. Inspired by the writings of Virginia Woolf, Woolf Works is an ambitious three-act ballet stunningly choreographed by Wayne McGregor, with a luminous original score by Max Richter.\n\nWidely considered one of the most important 20th century novelists, Virginia Woolf’s works have continued to speak to generations and her themes of social class, female (dis)empowerment, and death have gained even more resonance in recent times. Her stature in our society, and her influence on other artistic creators, can be seen in so many works throughout popular culture: In film with Orlando starring Tilda Swinton or The Hours starring Nicole Kidman, Meryl Streep, and Julianne Moore, in plays like Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? by Edward Albee, and, most recently, in opera with The Hours starring Renee Fleming, Kelly O’Hara and Joyce DiDonato.\n\nWoolf also gave inspiration to the award-winning British choreographer and director, Wayne McGregor. Internationally renowned for trailblazing innovations in performance that have radically redefined dance, McGregor’s insatiable curiosity about movement and its creative potentials, along with his embrace of technology, have ensured McGregor’s position at the cutting edge of contemporary arts for over twenty-five years.\n\nIn Woolf Works, McGregor has recreated the emotions, themes and fluid style of three of Virginia Woolf’s novels: Mrs Dalloway, Orlando and The Waves. Much like her novels, letters, essays and diaries, Wayne McGregor’s ballet triptych moves away from a traditional narrative structure, capturing the spirit of Woolf’s writing while delighting audiences with its sheer beauty. Woolf Works is structured into three acts: ‘I now, I then’, ‘Becomings’ and ‘Tuesday’, each starkly distinct in visual design and choreography.\n\nOriginally commissioned by the Royal Ballet, Woolf Works premiered in London to outstanding critical acclaim, going on to win McGregor the Critics’ Circle Award for Best Classical Choreography and the Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production. The Observer described it as “a compellingly moving experience” and The Independent raved that it “glows with ambition… a brave, thoughtful work.”\n\nBe the first in the United States to experience Woolf Works, only at Segerstrom Center for the Arts!\n\nCasting for Woolf Works:\n\nThursday, April 11 – Devon Teuscher*, James Whiteside*\n\nFriday, April 12 – Hee Seo*, Aran Bell*\n\nSaturday, April 13, 2:00 PM – Gillian Murphy*, Joo Won Ahn*\n\nSaturday, April 13, 7:30 PM – Devon Teuscher, James Whiteside\n\nSunday, April 14 – Hee Seo, Aran Bell\n\n*Debut in the role"
