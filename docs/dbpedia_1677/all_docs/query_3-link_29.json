        "text": "Here is a multi-perspective black comedy of violence in the manner of Tarantino or Doug Liman's little-remembered Go. A car crash at precisely 11:14 is told and re-told from the points-of-view of five people involved, and there is some satisfaction in seeing how the pieces are made to fit together (with a bit of squeezing) and also in recognising central, foregrounded events from one scene popping up in another, but shifted to the background and the periphery.\n\nHilary Swank plays a convenience store clerk whose buddy needs her to let him stage a robbery there to get the money he needs for his girlfriend's abortion: for reasons we can't go into, Swank also needs to make the larceny look convincing and asks him to shoot her in the fleshy part of her upper arm - a wince-making scene in itself, but you have to wonder how Tarantino could have milked it. Patrick Swayze is the harassed father of slinky Rachael Leigh Cook, who has secrets galore, and Ben Foster - Angel in the X-Men - suffers a Bobbitt-like severance of the member. This sort of ensemble is a very familiar trope now, and certainly contrived, but there is some carpentry and craftsmanship in the script by writer-director Greg Marcks, just 27 when this was made in 2003."
