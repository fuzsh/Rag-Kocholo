        "text": "I remember being creative from the time I was little. Perhaps it was from growing up in the middle of nowhere on a farm in central New York and the fact that I was an only child.\n\nI had to create my own fun. What I clearly recall is being fascinated by the ordinary and thinking of ways to make it extraordinary.\n\nOne day I took my banana bike and pretended to be Evil Knievel by trying to jump over a large number of kids with a special ramp that I designed.\n\nThe contest was to see if I could top my record with each jump.\n\nQuickly, I discovered that six kids were the maximum without killing myself with that banana seat or destroying them.\n\nFinding a Working Balance\n\nI value creativity because I understand that it is the vital force behind great art.\n\nIt is critical to find time to nurture your creative spirit. We can all find excuses that get in our way. My biggest one is guilt at spending more time away from my family.\n\nHowever, if I skimp and cheat myself out of creative time just for me, everything suffers.\n\nRestoring Your Creative Juices\n\nTravel is my favorite way to boost creativity. I am stimulated and amazed by the visual landscapes around the world.\n\nEach year, I take a few weeks just to reconnect with myself and my creative drive.\n\nIt is time that is non-negotiable and is the commitment that I make to decompress and fuel my creative reserves.\n\nI also take time to dream and visualize in my head every evening for 15-20 minutes. I unplug, go into the sauna, and practice dreaming.\n\nAbout Filmmakers Academy Cinematographer Mentor Shane Hurlbut, ASC\n\nDirector of photography Shane Hurlbut, ASC works at the forefront of cinema as a storyteller, innovator, and discerning collaborator, who brings more than three decades of experience to his art. He is a member of the American Society of Cinematographers, the International Cinematographers Guild/Local 600, and The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nHurlbut frequently joins forces with great directors: McG’s Netflix Rim of the World and The Babysitter, plus Warner Bros. We Are Marshall and Terminator: Salvation; Scott Waugh’s Need for Speed and Act of Valor; and Gabriele Muccino’s There Is No Place Like Home and Fathers and Daughters. His additional film credits include Semi-Pro; The Greatest Game Ever Played; Into the Blue; Mr 3000; Drumline; 11:14, which earned Hurlbut a DVDX nomination; and The Skulls. Notably, his television credits include the first season of AMC’s Into the Badlands."
