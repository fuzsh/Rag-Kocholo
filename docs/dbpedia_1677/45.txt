GEORGE BILLINGER

George Billinger stands as a towering figure in the realm of Hollywood filmmaking, revered for his unparalleled expertise as a Steadicam operator. With a career spanning decades, his name has become synonymous with cinematic excellence, leaving an indelible mark on a plethora of iconic films.

From navigating the bustling terminals of The Terminal to capturing the ethereal allure of Twilight, and embarking on adrenaline-fueled adventures in Prey, Billinger’s mastery of the Steadicam has breathed life into some of cinema’s most memorable moments.

Billinger is also acting President of the Society of Camera Operators heralding a new chapter of leadership and innovation within the organization. Elected during the February 28th Board of Governors meeting in 2016, Billinger brings a wealth of experience and a profound dedication to the organization. His tenure as President continues the SOC’s upward trajectory, fueled by his vision for growth and community enrichment.

THE JOB OF STEADICAM OPERATOR

Operating a Steadicam is a physically demanding feat. The rig itself consists of an arm with a vest worn by the operator. The camera is mounted on a gimbal at the end of the arm, isolated from the operator’s movements by springs and gyroscopes.

The operator uses their core strength and subtle adjustments to keep the camera level and gliding smoothly through a scene. It’s like becoming an extension of the camera itself, translating the walk or run of the operator into a silky smooth shot.

Invented in the late 1970s, the Steadicam revolutionized filmmaking. Early adopters like Stanley Kubrick used it to create those iconic, floating hallway sequences in The Shining. For decades, Steadicam operation remained a highly specialized skill. The bulky rigs required a lot of upper body strength and precise control.

However, Steadicam technology has come a long way in recent years. Electronic gimbals have emerged as a more accessible alternative, offering similar stabilization on a smaller scale. Additionally, Steadicam rigs themselves have become lighter and more user-friendly.

These advancements have opened up the world of Steadicam operation to a wider range of filmmakers, allowing for even more creative and dynamic camerawork. The future of Steadicam is likely to see further miniaturization and integration with electronic aids, making that signature smooth glide even more accessible and versatile for storytellers.

SEIZE THE MOMENT: EVEN IF YOU AREN’T 100% READY

Billinger recounts the pivotal moment when his career took a monumental leap forward, courtesy of a serendipitous connection and an unexpected phone call. Reflecting on his journey, Billinger reminisces about his collaboration with Janusz Kaminski and Steven Spielberg on The Terminal as a defining milestone.

It all started with a chance encounter on the set of Ray, where he crossed paths with Jimmy Kwiatkowski, a seasoned key grip whose recommendation would alter the course of Billinger’s career. Jimmy’s endorsement led to an interview with Janusz, a prospect that both thrilled and intimidated Billinger.

“Jimmy says, ‘Okay, I’m recommending you for this job.’” Billinger reminisces. “And I’m like, ‘I don’t think I’m ready.’ He says, ‘You’re ready, you can do it. I’ve seen what you can do.’ So, he says, ‘You’re going to have an interview with Janusz.’ So, I’m figuring [like] okay, I’m going to rehearse, I need to say something really good. I’m super intimidated by this guy. I’m a nobody. And I’m on Riverside Boulevard at La Salsa getting a burrito in the car, I’m in between some stupid camera shit, and burrito in one hand, and the phone [rings]. And Jimmy’s like, ‘Hey, George, it’s Jimmy and Janusz wants to talk to you.’ I said, ‘I can’t do it, not now.’ And he said, ‘Screw it, get the phone.’ And so Janusz gets on and starts his interview.”

Navigating the unpredictable waters of Janusz’s unique interview style, Billinger found himself unexpectedly hired within minutes, his nerves giving way to elation and a newfound sense of responsibility.

As he stepped onto the sprawling set of The Terminal, Billinger recognized the magnitude of the opportunity before him, embracing the challenge with unwavering determination and a commitment to deliver his best work.

This defining moment underscored Billinger’s belief in the power of perseverance and seizing opportunities when they arise, marking the beginning of a remarkable chapter in his journey as a camera operator.

BRING YOUR A-GAME

Landing the job is one thing, but bringing your A-Game is what ensures you keep it. For Billinger, his first big job was where luck, fate, and circumstance converged. The opportunity happened after a lot of hard work and he had to make the most of it.

He was now stepping onto a set lit by David Devlin with 250 soft suns and six Cat generators outside with a fuel truck that came twice a day.

“I mean, you’ve never seen a set that’s so huge and intimidating,” recalls Billinger. “I went out there to check it out, and after my first day out there, I said, “I don’t feel so good.” —George Billinger III

On Day 1 of filming, Billinger embarked on an early morning excursion to Malibu to unwind before their shoot at LAX’s office building. Amidst the anticipation and nerves, Billinger found himself in the presence of Steven Spielberg, casually perusing his script on a nearby couch.

“Janusz goes, ‘Georgie, come over here.’ He goes, ‘let me introduce you to Steven.’ And I’m like, ‘Okay.’ And Janusz goes to Steven, ‘Steven?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘This is George, this is Jimmy’s friend. I don’t know anything about him, but if he’s no good, we can get rid of him by lunch. George meet Steven.’ And Steven just kind of sheepishly was like, ‘Hey, George, how are you?’”

As Janusz reassured Steven that Billinger’s capabilities would be swiftly evaluated, Billinger couldn’t help but feel a blend of humor and apprehension at the prospect.

Steven’s friendly greeting served as a reassuring gesture, albeit laced with the weight of Janusz’s implied assessment. Reflecting on the moment, Billinger recognized the duality of humor and genuine scrutiny underlying the interaction, a dynamic that both eased and intensified the pressure of the occasion.

FROM STEADICAM TO DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY

Billinger reflects on his evolution as a Director of Photography (DP), acknowledging his journey from mastering camera operation to delving into the intricacies of lighting, a skill he cultivated through absorbing insights from renowned DPs.

Despite his initial hesitations about his proficiency in lighting, Billinger’s passion for the craft drove him to embrace the challenge. He vividly recalls his formative experiences shooting inserts, including memorable moments on projects like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, where he honed his skills under the guidance of seasoned professionals. However, it was his foray into second-unit work, particularly on Paramount’s Lioness, that marked a pivotal shift in his career trajectory.

Tasked with overseeing second-unit photography alongside Jeff Dashnaw, Billinger found himself grappling with newfound responsibilities and expectations. The pressure intensified as he navigated the unfamiliar terrain of lighting setups and directing local crews.

Stepping into the role of second unit DP, Billinger faced a daunting challenge on the first day of shooting in Baltimore. With minimal time for preparation and the added complexity of night work, Billinger found himself pushed out of his comfort zone, a feeling compounded by the unfamiliarity of working with a local crew.

The Value of Mentors in the Film Industry

Despite the initial trepidation, Billinger leaned on his instincts and the knowledge gleaned from his mentors to navigate the daunting task ahead. With limited resources and a tight schedule, Billinger embarked on the arduous task of lighting the scene, relying on his intuition to guide him through the process.

As the moment of truth arrived, with Paul Cameron and John Hillcoat scrutinizing his work, Billinger held his breath, unsure of the outcome. However, his meticulous planning and resourcefulness paid off as Paul gave his seal of approval, affirming Billinger’s abilities and cementing his place in the realm of DPs.

Reflecting on the experience, Billinger acknowledges the invaluable lessons learned from working alongside industry luminaries like Paul Cameron, Shane Hurlbut, ASC, and Januscz Kaminski. Despite the initial uncertainty, Billinger’s willingness to embrace challenges and learn from his peers propelled him forward, reaffirming his belief in the transformative power of perseverance and determination in the face of adversity.

ALWAYS COP TO YOUR MISTAKES AND LEARN FROM THEM

When it comes to addressing mistakes, Billinger stresses the importance of speaking up as an operator when there’s uncertainty regarding the director or DP’s intentions. He emphasizes the need to demonstrate value by delivering more than just excellent framing. Billinger advises against fixating on a single shot, advocating instead for curiosity and flexibility to adapt to evolving creative needs.

In reflecting on his professional growth, Billinger highlights the importance of communication and collaboration within the filmmaking process, particularly from the perspective of both an operator and a cinematographer. Over time, Billinger has learned the value of speaking up and addressing any issues or misunderstandings that may arise between himself, the director, and the director of photography (DP). Rather than passively accepting a situation, Billinger emphasizes the need for open dialogue and finding common ground to ensure that artistic visions align seamlessly.

Billinger underscores the significance of understanding each other’s artistic perspectives and navigating potential conflicts that may arise due to differing interpretations or communication breakdowns. He emphasizes the necessity of genuine collaboration among the highly visual and creative individuals involved in filmmaking, acknowledging the complexity that arises when merging various artistic sensibilities.

The Importance of Clear Communication

Drawing from his experiences working with directors like Steven Spielberg, Billinger acknowledges the importance of clarity in direction and the trust placed in the creative execution of shots by the operators. Spielberg’s precise blocking allows for a seamless transition from direction to execution, with operators like Billinger and his colleague, Mitch Dubin, granted the autonomy to bring the director’s vision to life.

Billinger also recognizes the varying degrees of guidance required by different directors, noting that while some may prefer a hands-off approach, others may seek more input and collaboration. This diversity underscores the need for operators to adapt to the preferences and working styles of each director, ensuring a harmonious and productive working relationship.

Ultimately, Billinger emphasizes the multifaceted nature of an operator’s role, extending beyond merely framing shots and capturing performances. He highlights the importance of demonstrating value through proactive problem-solving, adaptability, and a deep understanding of the director’s vision and the DP’s technical requirements. Through effective communication and collaboration, Billinger believes that operators can elevate their contributions to the filmmaking process and establish themselves as indispensable members of the creative team.

OVERCOMING EGO AND MANAGING MINDSET

Billinger reflects on the pervasive role of ego in the film industry. He acknowledges that while everyone possesses an ego, its recognition and management are crucial, especially in the collaborative environment of filmmaking.

Billinger notes that while it might be tempting to bask in the glory after a project’s completion, asserting one’s ego during the process is detrimental. He emphasizes the importance of humility and teamwork, stating that artists evolve significantly when they set their egos aside.

Billinger recounted a personal story that illustrated his perspective on ego. He shared an experience from the end of filming The Terminal in Mirabel, Canada. After spending months working closely with Steven Spielberg, he felt compelled to express his admiration and gratitude. In the control room, amid the wrap-up celebration, Billinger approached Spielberg and his brother George, mustering the courage to share a deeply personal anecdote.

He recounted to Spielberg how, in 1975, he was a young surfer in Ventura, California, who watched Jaws at the Ventura Theater with his friends. The film had left a profound impact on them, instilling a fear of the ocean that lingered for weeks. Billinger expressed his awe at how he had gone from being a fanboy of Spielberg’s work to collaborating with him on a film set. He conveyed how surreal and significant this journey had been for him.

Spielberg, in response, was genuinely moved. He appreciated hearing that Jaws had resonated so strongly with Billinger and his friends, calling it “the best shit” he had ever heard.

For Billinger, this moment of connection and the realization of his journey from a young admirer to a collaborator was both humbling and extraordinary. Reflecting on it, he marveled at the unexpected paths his life had taken, cementing the experience as a highlight of his career.

STAYING ON TOP OF THE LATEST TECH & TRENDS

Billinger admits that staying current with technology is indeed daunting and requires a concerted effort. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the tools without letting them detract from the artistry of cinematography.

He acknowledges that he is still learning, especially compared to seasoned professionals like Shane, who have decades of experience. Billinger highlights that learning from experienced colleagues helps him gain confidence and improve his craft. He values the insights and techniques he picks up from others, as they enhance his capabilities and allow him to apply new methods in his work.

Shane shares his own journey of learning to delegate and collaborate. He used to feel the need to solve all problems himself, from grip rigs to VFX setups. Over time, Shane realized the importance of trusting his team and involving them in problem-solving. By doing so, he reduced his own stress and allowed his team to contribute their expertise. Shane describes how he now focuses on asking the right questions and relying on his team’s knowledge, rather than micromanaging every detail.

Both Billinger and Shane agreed on the importance of embracing collaboration and continuous learning. By doing so, they enhance their roles as cinematographers and create a more effective and less stressful working environment.

MAINTAINING FAMILY WITH A BUSY SCHEDULE

According to Billinger, there’s a trade-off to maintaining such a busy schedule. He explains that his work has deeply defined him, and the industry strikes made him realize just how much he missed working. The inability to work during those times led to feelings of depression and forced him to reflect on his life and priorities.

Balancing multiple projects is incredibly demanding, especially on his family life. Billinger shares that he often took his daughter with him on various projects to ensure they spent time together, despite the extensive travel. This gave her an amazing upbringing but also meant significant time away from her. Despite the challenges, he notes that she turned out great, which he considers a blessing.

Billinger emphasizes the importance of maintaining a strict routine to manage the demands of his job. He is regimented, focusing on his work and taking care of his physical health. He adheres religiously to a daily gym routine to ensure he is prepared for the day’s work.

While some days are harder than others, he finds equilibrium by resting and regenerating on weekends, eating well, and avoiding unhealthy lifestyle choices such as partying or late-night outings.

For Billinger, doing what he loves is a luxury, and he takes his responsibilities seriously. He is proud of his work and strives to deliver exceptional results consistently. By making careful life choices, he ensures that nothing interferes with his ability to perform at his best.

CONTENDING WITH AN UNPREDICTABLE FILM INDUSTRY

Shane Hurlbut expresses his surprise at the unpredictability of the industry, mentioning how he followed trade updates daily, only to see continuous setbacks. Billinger resonates with this sentiment, sharing his own struggles during the industry’s tumultuous periods. He described the frustration of feeling like he had done something wrong, even though he hadn’t, and how hard it was to process the impact of the strikes.

Billinger admits that he’s his own worst critic as he proclaims the importance of owning one’s mistakes, both to oneself and to others, as a way to learn and grow. Despite not having done anything wrong during the strikes, he couldn’t shake the feeling that he had. This was compounded by financial stress, as he watched his investments closely and tried to stay calm amidst the uncertainty.

During this challenging time, Billinger humorously recalls using the Calm app, as recommended, while simultaneously checking his Schwab account. The app’s advice to “be calm” didn’t quite alleviate his anxiety, leading him to make some phone calls instead.

Work, for Billinger, is a form of security, and the inability to work was deeply unsettling. He stressed how much he loves his job, likening it to a passion rather than just a means to make money. He contrasted this with his previous career as a firefighter, noting that while he loved both roles in different ways, his work in the film industry had become a significant part of his identity.

While being well-paid is important and reflective of the effort put in, it has never been Billinger’s primary motivation. For him, the joy lies in creating and doing what he loves. The inability to work due to the industry disruptions was a significant hardship, underscoring the vital role his work plays in his life.

WELLNESS HABITS TO OVERCOME HARDSHIP

Billinger coped during these challenging times by finding solace in maintaining his health and staying active. Exercise became a crucial part of his routine, helping him navigate through the rough spots.

Shane also shared his experience, noting that his son, Myles, had become a personal trainer during the pandemic. Shane decided to join the gym and train with his son, which turned into a bonding experience. He appreciated the endorphin and dopamine boost from working out, which helped him cope with the stress.

Exercise provided a much-needed release for Billinger, helping him manage his mental health. He also turned to reading and catching up on movies to keep himself occupied. Despite these efforts, the period felt like a repeat of the pandemic, with the added stress of industry shutdowns.

During this time, Billinger sought out colleagues to check on them and found that many were experiencing similar struggles. This sense of shared hardship highlighted the importance of community and being open about one’s struggles. Lydia adds that loneliness had become a significant health crisis since the pandemic, emphasizing the need for community support and real conversations about mental health.

Billinger worked with director Kelly Madison on a small short film during the challenging period. This project, which focused on the isolation caused by social media, was a timely and dramatic narrative that helped him reconnect with his creative work. It provided a much-needed outlet for him and the team, helping them find a better place mentally and professionally.
