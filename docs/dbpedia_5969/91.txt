Paramount Television has signed David Manson to an exclusive two-year overall deal, with the first project for the House Of Cards writer and executive producer being a series adaptation of Jacques Audiard’s 2001 French feature Read My Lips (Sur Mes Levres).

Manson will develop the adaptation – about an ex-convict and a deaf secretary navigating the worlds of blue- and white-collar crime – with Nic Sheff, a writer on Paramount’s 13 Reasons Why series and the US version of The Killing.

The overall deal calls for Manson – an Emmy nominee for House Of Cards whose other writer and executive producer credits include Ozark, Big Love and Saved, which he also created – and his Sarabande Productions to develop new projects and work on select existing Paramount TV projects.

Paramount TV president Amy Powell said: “We are big fans of David and have connected over our shared vision for identifying cinematic and prestigious projects. His vision and experience fit perfectly with what we do and we are excited to have him as part of the Paramount TV team.”

Manson added: “When I looked at the smart, literate slate of projects that Amy and her team have developed, I knew there was a mutuality of taste. I’m excited to begin a collaboration with them.”

Paramount TV’s current programming slate includes Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, set to premiere in August on Amazon, Hulu’s upcoming Catch-22 and TNT’s The Alienist.
