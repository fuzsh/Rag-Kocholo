        "text": "A new trailer for Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood” dropped Tuesday, the same day the director’s ninth film makes its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nTarantino’s latest offering stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt as aging leading man Rick Dalton and stunt double Cliff Booth, respectively, as they struggle to hold on to their careers in 1969 Hollywood, a year that marked immense change in the entertainment industry — not least of all because of famed cult leader Charles Manson, whose gruesome crimes sent shock waves throughout Los Angeles.\n\nWhile the Manson family’s connection to the plot of the film is still somewhat unclear, the new two-and-half minute trailer offers a glimpse at Manson and his followers, as well as the compound they called home. Also featured heavily is “Suicide Squad” actress Margot Robbie as Sharon Tate, the up-and-coming Hollywood starlet whose life and career came to a tragic, abrupt end when the Manson family murdered her and her unborn child.\n\nThe Cannes premiere of “Once Upon A Time In Hollywood” coincides with the 25th anniversary of the Cannes premiere of “Pulp Fiction,” a film that would go on to earn Tarantino the Palme d’Or, the highest honor that can be awarded at the festival, Entertainment Weekly reports.\n\nTarantino said last year that the script for his latest film took him years to finish, Deadline reports.\n\n“I’ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was 7 years old,” he explained. “I’m very excited to tell this story of an LA and a Hollywood that don’t exist anymore. And I couldn’t be happier about the dynamic teaming of DiCaprio & Pitt as Rick & Cliff.”\n\nTrue crime fans may not want to get too invested in the idea of a film focused on the Manson family murders, however. Last month, producer David Heyman confirmed to Entertainment Weekly that the film is not about the bloodshed the cult became known for, explaining, “It’s about the loss of innocence that came about in 1969 with the Manson family.”"
