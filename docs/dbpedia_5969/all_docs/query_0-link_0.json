        "text": "American film producer\n\nFor persons of a similar name, see David Manson.\n\nDavid Manson (born 1952) is a Peabody Award-winning American film and television producer, screenwriter and director.\n\nHe is perhaps best known for his work on a trio of acclaimed Netflix series: House of Cards, Bloodline, and Ozark, for which he has received multiple Emmy Award and Writers Guild Award nominations.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nManson was born in New York City to two musicians who had met as students at the Juilliard School. His father, Eddy Manson (né Eddy Lawrence Manson; 1919–1996), a harmonica virtuoso, moved the family to Los Angeles in 1965 to pursue his career as a film composer.\n\nManson attended the University of California at Santa Cruz on full scholarship before transferring to the University of California at Irvine, where he graduated magna cum laude.\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nManson began his career in the theater and worked in various capacities for such venues as the Mark Taper Forum, Playwrights Horizon and the Manhattan Theater Club.\n\nHe started in the film business at Dick Berg's Stonehenge Productions where he produced his first film, The Spell (1977), for NBC, at the age of twenty-four. As Senior Vice President of Stonehenge, he produced several movies and miniseries including the first major television miniseries about Vietnam, A Rumor of War (1980), which The New York Times called \"unusually ambitious and admirable\"[1] and the Washington Post referred to \"as true as a movie is going to get\".[2]\n\nIn 1980, Manson formed his own company, Sarabande Productions, aimed at creating a platform for prestigious writers. He has since worked with Pulitzer Prize winners including Michael Chabon, Donald Margulies and Jules Feiffer, and acclaimed screenwriters such as Joan Tewkesbury, Barbara Turner, John Sacret Young, and National Book Award recipient Denis Johnson.\n\nIn features, he executive-produced and developed the Cannes Film Festival Special Jury Prize Winner Birdy (1984) starring Matthew Modine and Nicolas Cage. He then produced the Sting documentary, Bring On the Night (1985), directed by Michael Apted, which earned a Grammy Award for best long form video; he also executive-produced The Cemetery Club (1993), starring Ellen Burstyn, and produced the Drew Barrymore film, Mad Love (1995), both for Disney/Touchstone Pictures where his company was housed for several years.\n\nSarabande has also inked overall deals with MGM/UA, Sony, 20th Century Fox, FX Productions, and most recently Paramount Television Studios. Through the 1980s and 1990s, Manson, through Sarabande, executive-produced a number of television movies, including Rising Son (1990) starring Matt Damon in his first major role, the Christopher Award-winning NBC film, Eye on the Sparrow (1987), and Nightjohn (1996), directed by Charles Burnett, which was the recipient of a Special Citation Award from the National Society of Film Critics and which The New Yorker named the best American movie of the year.\n\nManson entered into the series business as co-creator/executive producer of Against the Law (1990) for FOX and made his directorial debut with the ABC television movie, Those Secrets (1992). He then co-created, produced, and directed the controversial drama, Nothing Sacred (1997), about an irreverent Catholic priest, which was the subject of an advertiser boycott instituted by the conservative pressure group, The Catholic League.[3] The series won not only the Peabody Award, but also a Humanitas Award, the Writers Guild Award, and the Viewers for Quality Television Founders Award.[4]\n\nLater in the 1990s, he produced several films with his wife, writer/producer Arla Sorkin Manson, including the highly rated CBS telefilm, The Wedding Dress (2001). He also executive-produced two films for TNT: Thicker Than Blood (1998) with Mickey Rourke, based on Bill Cain's award-winning play, Stand-Up Tragedy; and Baby (2000), starring Farrah Fawcett and Keith Carradine, for which Manson received his first Writers Guild Award nomination. After 2000, Manson focused more on showrunning television series. He served as a consulting producer/writer on the hit HBO series, Big Love (2006), was the showrunner on the FX series, Thief (2006), starring the Emmy Award-winning Andre Braugher, and created, wrote, directed and executive produced the EMT drama, Saved (2006), for TNT.\n\nManson was the showrunner and wrote several episodes of the FOX series New Amsterdam (2008), directed multiple episodes of Law & Order: Criminal Intent (2009), and then executive-produced a pilot for FX, Outlaw Country (2011), starring Mary Steenburgen and John Hawkes.\n\nIn 2013, Manson became co-showrunner on the celebrated series, House of Cards, starring Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright. He received Golden Globe Award, Writers Guild Award, and Emmy Award nominations for his work. This began an association with Netflix which included executive producing/writing on both the critically hailed Kyle Chandler series, Bloodline, and the hit series, Ozark, starring Jason Bateman and Laura Linney, for which he received Emmy Award and Writers Guild Award nominations.\n\nMore recently, he was an executive producer/writer on the Apple TV+ series, Shantaram, starring Charlie Hunnam, based on Gregory Roberts’ best-selling novel.[5]\n\nName TV/Film Year Position Awards Notes Shantaram TV 2022 Executive Producer/Writer Ozark TV 2017-2018 Executive Producer/Writer Emmy Nomination: Outstanding Drama Series, Writers Guild Award Nomination: Episodic Drama (The Precious Blood of Jesus), Producers Guild Nomination: Outstanding Producer of Episodic Television, Drama Bloodline TV 2015-2017 Executive Producer/Writer/Director Hoke TV 2014 Executive Producer House of Cards TV 2013 Executive Producer/Writer Emmy Nomination: Outstanding Drama Series, Golden Globe Nomination: Best Television Series, Drama, Producers Guild Nomination: Best Drama, Writers Guild Nomination: Best Drama The Divide TV 2012 Executive Producer/Writer Outlaw Country TV 2011 Executive Producer Damages TV 2011 Consulting Producer Law & Order: Criminal Intent TV 2009 Director Life TV 2009 Consulting Producer/Writer New Amsterdam TV 2008 Executive Producer/Writer Saved TV 2006 Creator/Executive Producer/Writer/Director Thief TV 2006 Executive Producer/Writer Big Love TV 2006 Consulting Producer/Writer Golden Globe Nomination: Best Television Series, Drama John Doe TV 2003 Consulting Producer/Writer The Wedding Dress Film 2001 Executive Producer Baby Film 2000 Executive Producer/Writer Writers Guild Nomination, Christopher Award Mind Games Film 1998 Executive Producer Thicker Than Blood Film 1998 Executive Producer ALMA Award Nothing Sacred TV 1997–1998 Co-Creator/Executive Producer/Writer/Director Peabody Award, Humanitas Award, Producers Guild Nomination, Viewers for Quality Television: Founders Award Nightjohn Film 1997 Executive Producer National Society of Film Critics: Special Citation Mad Love Film 1995 Producer Original Sins Film 1995 Executive Producer The Cemetery Club Film 1993 Executive Producer Those Secrets Film 1992 Executive Producer/Director Against The Law TV 1990–1991 Co-Creator/Executive Producer/Writer Rising Son Film 1990 Executive Producer Eye on the Sparrow Film 1987 Executive Producer Christopher Award The King of Love Film 1987 Executive Producer Bring On the Night Film 1985 Producer Grammy Award: Best Long Form Video Birdy Film 1984 Executive Producer Cannes Film Festival: Special Jury Prize Best Kept Secrets Film 1984 Producer Sessions Film 1983 Producer A Rumor of War TV 1980 Producer The Word TV 1978 Producer A Love Affair: The Eleanor and Lou Gehrig Story Film 1978 Producer Night Cries Film 1978 Producer The Spell Film 1977 Producer\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
