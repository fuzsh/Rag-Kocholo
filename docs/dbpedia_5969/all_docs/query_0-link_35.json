        "text": "I ended up through a series of chance circumstances as musical director of the Royal Court Theatre, Sloane Square in London. And while I was doing the work at the Royal Court, with Max Stafford-Clark, there was a young Assistant Director there called Antonia Bird and that's how we met. We did some work together and it was good work.\n\nIt really forged a relationship and then when she went to the BBC as a trainee I did a lot of things with her at the BBC and did a drama series called 'Thin Air' which was very successful and the 'The Men's Room' which was a serial about middle class sex basically which went very well because it had a lot joyful nudity and she had developed 'Priest'. Originally Jimmy had written it as a television four parter and it got changed over time to a single drama on film and Antonia was always in there to direct it. And at that point it was natural for her to ask me to do the music, particularly because of the Liverpool connection."
