        "text": "FULL-TIME MENTORS\n\nKool Marder | Senior Lecturer\n\nMarder began her industry career as an assistant to the Emmy® and Academy Award®-winning director and cinematographer Haskell Wexler. She quickly worked her way up the Hollywood ladder, becoming a production coordinator on numerous films including THE BIG EASY, MOON OVER PARADOR and DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS.\n\nMarder rose to the position of unit production manager on NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, THE DREAM CHILD and David Lynch’s WILD AT HEART (1990 Palme d’Or winner). She was also the associate producer on the original motion picture HALLOWEEN.\n\nMarder spent the next 11 years as Vice President of Production for Universal Studios, where she oversaw more than 50 feature films, including FRIED GREEN TOMATOES, CASINO, CARLITO’S WAY, OUT OF SIGHT, MAN ON THE MOON, AMERICAN PIE, THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS, ERIN BROCKOVICH and THE BOURNE IDENTITY.\n\nShe has collaborated with such filmmakers as Steven Spielberg, Brian De Palma, Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, Miloš Forman, Robert Zemeckis, Peter Jackson, Ang Lee, Terry Gilliam and Kathryn Bigelow.\n\nMarder has filled the role as Head of Production for numerous production companies including Incentive Film Entertainment, where she oversaw three films including Derek Cianfrance’s BLUE VALENTINE. Marder also operated as Head of Production for a bond company with the responsibility of overseeing approximately 60 feature films, five of them in China. They include: THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM; Ang Lee’s LUST, CAUTION; and John Woo’s RED CLIFF. Other films that Marder bonded are 3:10 TO YUMA, THE IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS (Heath Ledger’s last film), WHITE RIBBON (2009 Palme D’Or winner) and the 2010 Academy Award®-winning film THE HURT LOCKER.\n\nVanessa Hayes\n\nWith over three decades of production and post-production experience, Hayes landed as a post producer through her love of editing (the final re-write) mixed with the alchemy of image capture, sound design, CGI/visual effects and music — ingredients that transform narrative storytelling into the world of moving action. Most recently, she was the visual effects producer on season one of SHADOWHUNTERS and served as co-producer on season one of KINGDOM (DirectTV), THE DIVIDE (AMC), RINGER (CW), NEW AMSTERDAM and AGAINST THE LAW (Fox), LOVE BITES and RAINES (NBC), SAVED (TNT), NOTHING SACRED (ABC) and the Robert Altman-executive-produced pilot GUN. All told she has post-produced and delivered over 375 hours of network and cable programming including television movies, miniseries and two “fat” reality shows, AMERICA’S NEXT TOP MODEL and STARTING OVER. Additionally, Hayes post-supervised features for Warner Brothers, Miramax, New Line Cinema, LIVE Entertainment, HBO Films including writer/director John Ridley’s first feature COLD AROUND THE HEART, Oliver Stone’s FREEWAY and the Pate Brothers’ THE GRAVE — the latter two premiering at the 1996 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nFurtherance to her long career in post-production, Hayes was Production Executive for Dove Entertainment, where she oversaw international feature and miniseries co-productions in Canada and Croatia. At one point she injected herself into a more corporate landscape as Vice-President/Post Production for the Kushner Locke Company, where she directly supervised post on a laundry list of television and feature film projects shot in Canada, Europe, New Zealand and Mexico. Working with many A-level producers and directors, she counts David Manson, John Landgraf, Robert Lovenheim, Barbara Bloom, Pam Veasey, Preston Fischer, Steve Schott, Tony Goldwyn, Richard Pearce, Frank Pierson and Abel Ferrara as mentors and influencers.\n\nSince she first entered the production business, Hayes has experienced the shift and growth of a film-based world to a completely digital landscape that included the amazing morphing of moviolas to AVIDs, celluloid opticals/stop-motion effects to the most advanced forms of CGI/2D and 3D visual effects. She has a deep and abiding interest in how technology has and can continue to advance the art of filmmaking with a passion for discovering new alternate paths to content creation and distribution. Her motto: “Post is not above or below the line… it is on the line!”\n\nCREATIVE THESIS MENTORS\n\nAmedeo D’Adamo | Lecturer & Creative Thesis Mentor\n\nJacob Forman | Senior Lecturer & Senior Creative Thesis Mentor\n\nJacob Forman’s first feature film, ALL THE BOYS LOVE MANDY LANE, screened at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival, where it was acquired by The Weinstein Company for worldwide distribution.
