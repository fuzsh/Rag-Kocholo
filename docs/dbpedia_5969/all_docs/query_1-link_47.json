        "text": "Rhapsody In Blue Merrick Chamber Orchestra Richard Gilley Piano (No. 37 No. 38) Agitato mf Molto marcato Analysis This section starts out at (No. 37) marked agitato, with the same melodic motif that was introduced the first time that the piano played at the beginning of the Rhapsody. This melody was also developed in the poco agitato section earlier. It consists of a 16th rest followed by three 16th notes and two eights. This familiar theme is used a different places throughout the Rhapsody, but in this section, it is developed with great speed and intensity, as it is actually a recap of the poco agitato section. At (No. 38) the music progresses with greater intensity and keeps building, and leads us to the molto marcato section which is six measures long. Molto means much or very, and Marcato means to perform with emphasis. Here, the orchestra plays a chromatic scale in contrary motion. Half of the orchestra ascends, while the other half of the orchestra descends chromatically. As the orchestra plays the chromatic scale with each note accented, as the scale continues it dramatically slows down to a final B-flat chord followed by a fermata before the last section of the Rhapsody.\n\nGOOD EVENING WITH MUSIC OF KHATIA BUNIATISHVILI KHATIA BUNIATISHVILI CONCERTO NO 11 IN D MAJOR ON PIANO Khatia Buniatishvili Joseph Haydn Piano Concerto No 11 in D major, Hob XVIII 11 https://lnkd.in/eWQ2MvQw https://lnkd.in/gfFUbNRp I am so thankful to Western Classical Music for discovering Khatia Buniatishvili. Many thanks for discovering this gem. I've never seen it or heard of it. KB's performance is a refreshing change from the run-of-the-mill performances one usually hears of this piece. Unfortunately, Richter's performance is another example of the norm - heavy and ponderous - right from his initial entrance in the first movement you can feel the imposed force of gravity trying to give weight to a piece which doesn't need it. We rarely get to hear Khatia play Haydn and this is the first time we have had a live recording of her playing Haydn's Piano Concerto No 11 in D major, Hob XVIII-11. Because this is a rare gem I have let Khatia go first, but we still get to compare her performance with Sviatoslav Richter's version. Khatia's recording was with the Chamber Orchestra Kremerata Baltica and Richter's with the Minsk Chamber Orchestra. J. Haydn - Piano Concerto No. 11 in D major, Hob. XVIII/11, 1. Vivace https://lnkd.in/eDygngHN 1 Vivace 2 Un poco adagio 3 Rondo all'ungarese Khatia's performance, by contrast, is fluent and free from unneeded gravitas. The music floats on air, unimpeded by any unnecessary weight. KB's performances reveal, however, a possible negative influence on her playing - her technical ability is so great, that sometimes it's possible to detect a certain glibness in her playing, a feeling of condescension towards the material. I may be off base here, but this is a problem which one can detect in musicians with her extraordinary technical faculty. This was a problem with Gould, for instance, one which he never fully resolved, in my opinion. At times I can detect signs of it in KB, a feeling of superiority in relationship to the music. This attitude can cause a severe limitation in deepening the understanding of the music of a composer like Haydn, whose surface simplicity conceals an underlying complexity. It will be interesting to see how Khatia deals with this in the future. Thanks Khatia !! God Bless you !! Sudhanshu"
