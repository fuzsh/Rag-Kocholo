A new film called Street Level features many cast members of the show, including David Labrava (who is also the film’s director) and Mark Boone Junior. At the very end of the video, here’s also a cameo from Sons… cast member Danny Trejo that references his starring role in the film series Machete. Another fellow S.O.A. cast member featured in this film is Marilyn Manson, as well as Godmack vocalist Sully Erna. There seems to be little information about this film, other than it appears to be slated for a December 25, 2015 release date. Christmas Day seems to be an interesting choice for a movie about drug culture, especially one seemingly produced by a company called “Junkie Films LLC.” Not to mention, Lucasfilm might want to consider suing for the logo."
