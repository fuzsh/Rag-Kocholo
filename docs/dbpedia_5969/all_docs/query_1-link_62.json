        "text": "Quentin Tarantino has finally gone public with casting and title details of his forthcoming Charles Manson film.\n\nThe project will be called Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and will look at Tinsel Town at the height of its hippie era in the late Sixties.\n\nBoth Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio have been confirmed to star in the film, which studio Sony Pictures said would be released on August 9, 2019. It is the first film Tarantino has released without Harvey Weinstein, his long-term producer.\n\nSet in 1969 Los Angeles, the project has become widely known as Tarantino's Charles Manson film – especially following the controversial revelation that a young Roman Polanski, who was left widowed by the cult leader's planned killing spree, had been written into the script.\n\nNeither DiCaprio nor Pitt will be playing Manson however. Tarantino says they will play a pair of struggling actors. DiCaprio will appear as former Western TV series star and Pitt as his stunt double. \"Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don’t recognise anymore,\" Tarantino said. Their characters live next door to Sharon Tate.\n\nA longtime resident of Los Angeles, Tarantino has been working on the script for five years. \"I’ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was seven years old,” Tarantino said in a statement. “I’m very excited to tell this story of an L.A., and a Hollywood that don’t exist anymore. And I couldn’t be happier about the dynamic teaming of DiCaprio & Pitt as Rick & Cliff.”"
