Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman and More\n\nPractical Magic’s spellbinding tale of the Owens sisters’ quest to break their family curse isn’t just a film for the Halloween season — although it’s a must watch during the fall. The 1998 film starred Sandra Bullock as Sally Owens and Nicole Kidman as Gillian Owens, both of whom are unlucky in love thanks to a curse placed on the women of their family because of their witch roots. While Sally mourns the death of her husband, Michael (Mark Feuerstein) — and moves her daughters in with her aunts, Frances (Stockard Channing) and Jet (Dianne Wiest) — Gillian gets into an abusive relationship. The siblings must come together to rid themselves of Gillian’s boyfriend Jimmy (Goran Višnjić) and his ghost while embracing their witch side. The cast’s bond — and famous midnight margaritas scene — has continued to resonate with moviegoers for decades. “We’re really good sisters,\" Kidman said on the 2018 Oscars red carpet after running into Bullock, who replied, “I think we are. And we’re really good drinkers too!” Scroll down to see what the cast of Practical Magic has been up to since the ‘90s — and don’t forget to plant lavender for luck at your home:\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nSandra Bullock\n\nBullock played the quiet and more reserved sister, Sally Owens, who falls in love twice before breaking the curse on her family. The actress then starred in 28 Days, Miss Congeniality, Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, Two Weeks Notice, Crash, The Proposal, The Blind Side, Gravity, Ocean’s Eight and Bird Box. The Virginia native has more than 15 producer credits, including Miss Congeniality 2: Armed & Fabulous, Our Brand Is Crisis, Lost City of D and the George Lopez show.

Randall died in August 2023 after a three-year battle with ALS.\n\nCredit: Shutterstock (2)\n\nNicole Kidman\n\nKidman’s Gillian Owens was the wild sister who falls in love with a bad boy who threatens to kill her on multiple occasions.
