        "text": "Dead to the World Video by Marilyn Manson Released February 10, 1998 Recorded 1996 during the Dead to the World tour Genre Alternative metal, heavy metal, industrial metal Length 58:54 Label Nothing, Interscope Director Joseph F. Cultice Producer Marilyn Manson IMDb View at IMDb Professional reviews\n\nAllmusic link\n\nMarilyn Manson video chronology\n\nDead to the World is the first video album by Marilyn Manson, released on February 10, 1998 by Interscope Records. It primarily contains a live performance from the Dead to the World tour, but also delves into backstage and archival footage of the band. Dead to the World has since gone out of print, but a possible reissue has been alluded to in recent years.\n\nNotable features are extensive protests by right-wing Christian groups, spoken relations of meaning and intent by Manson himself and the brutal, immense theatrics presented by the band in the live setting. Based from Antichrist Superstar, this video features six songs from the album as well as hits from earlier releases Portrait of an American Family and Smells Like Children. Naturally this tour reflected the album it was built upon - Manson's criticisms of organized religion in this video and otherwise are ironically proven in the very actions of the people featured protesting his credibility.\n\nBlurb[edit]\n\n\"Society has traditionally always tried to find a scapegoat for its problems. Well, here I am.\"\n\nMarilyn Manson October 1996\n\nThe controversial events from the Antichrist Superstar\n\ntour serve as the backdrop for this amazing document,\n\nall as seen through the video eye of the band's own cam-\n\neraman. The picketing zealots, the fulminating moralists,\n\nthe disingenuous politicians, the tens of thousands who\n\ncame to see for themselves and, of course, gazing out-\n\nward from the very heart of the storm, Manson himself.\n\nOne hour of live concert performances intercut with\n\nbehind the scene and backstage footage that will help\n\nyou to understand what it must have been like to be at\n\nthe center of these extraordinary occurrences.\n\nChapter listing[edit]\n\n\"Angel with the Scabbed Wings\"\n\n\"Lunchbox\"\n\n\"Kinderfeld\"\n\n\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\"[1]\n\n\"Apple of Sodom\"[1]\n\n\"Antichrist Superstar\"[1][2]\n\n\"The Beautiful People\"[1][2]\n\n\"My Monkey\"\n\n\"Irresponsible Hate Anthem\"[3]\n\n\"Rock n' Roll Nigger\"\n\n\"1996\" (Spoken)\n\nRe-release[edit]\n\nManson stated in November 2005 that he was interested in re-releasing Dead to the World and its follow-up God Is in the T.V. on DVD, though this has yet to be followed up on. In March of 2008 a petition was started for this re-release. The petition could be signed here (the petition has closed).\n\nCredits[edit]\n\nDirector: Joseph F.

The reasons, wanted to give a better production to recording what was actually because, naturally the quality was not efficient enough or good for the market. Not otherwise rerecorded, it was as it was originally recorded on the show.\n\nSee Also[edit]\n\nGroupie\n\nDead to the World (film transcription)\n\n[edit]\n\nDead to the World on 's YouTube channel\n\nReferences[edit]"
