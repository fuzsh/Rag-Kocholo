        "text": "By all accounts, Charles Manson was a master manipulator. In the late 1960s, he seduced a small army of young people into joining him on a communal makeshift ranch outside of L.A., where they rejected society’s rules and prepared for an apocalypse that Manson assured them was imminent. His grip on his followers would lead to numerous murders in the greater Los Angeles area in 1969, most famously of Sharon Tate and four of her friends at the home Tate shared with her husband, Roman Polanski.\n\nBut Manson also manipulated his arrest, his incarceration and, even now, three years after he died in prison at age 83, the insatiable appetite for articles, books and films about him. It seems that no matter how many times we revisit the sordid, gruesome details of the Manson Family murders, we remain endlessly fascinated by the man who somehow managed to lure so many people into his web and compel them to commit acts that exceeded the bounds of most people’s worst nightmares.\n\nA half-century after his conviction and death sentence (the California legal system declared execution unconstitutional in 1972 and commuted Manson’s sentence to life without the possibility of parole), comes a new six-part docuseries on Epix. Helter Skelter: An American Myth, from director Lesley Chilcott, may be the most exhaustive telling on film or video produced yet, drawing not only on archival footage and well-documented facts about the cases associated with Manson, but also on lengthy testimony by former members of the so-called Manson Family cult and even people who knew him when he was growing up in Appalachia.\n\nThe basic story is well known. Manson spent his youth as a nomad, first being dragged around the American middle-southeast by his negligent mother and then, darting between various reform schools, juvenile detention facilities and prisons. He moved west, got arrested again and spent the majority of the 1960s in California prisons. When he got out, in 1967, he found the perfect environment to cultivate his sociopathy in San Francisco, then the center of the antiwar counterculture. Gurus were common, drugs were plentiful and young people were flocking to the area from all around the country searching for something. Many didn’t know what, exactly. That’s where Manson came in.\n\nHelter Skelter, named for the Beatles song that Manson allegedly coopted to become a central part of his belief that a race war was coming and that his “family” could only survive if they helped to start it and thereby be seen as allies of the “black man,” covers all of that, and then some. There are numerous details about Manson and his followers that have often been subsumed by the laser focus on the Tate murders: The time they spent living with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, for instance. Manson’s not-inconsiderable musical talents and close brush with a recording contract. The family’s time living in a fake town that had been a movie set for Westerns.\n\nAnd, of course, the murders Manson orchestrated that had nothing to do with Ms. Tate, including a young musician named Gary Hinman and Leno and Rosemary LaBianca.\n\nMuch of the retelling comes from former members of the Manson Family themselves. Stephanie Schram and Catherine Share offer extensive reflections on their time with “Charlie,” as they still call him today. They describe the immediate spell he was able to cast on them, what they allowed him to do and what they would have done for him. Now in their 70s, these women’s harrowing accounts are belied by the collected, calm affect with which they relate them. Either they’ve grown so bored telling these stories that they’re now just following a well-worn script, or they were so disassociated during their time with Manson that now, more than 50 years later, they recount that time as if the memories belong to someone else. It’s eerie, but in an odd way, it reinforces both narrators’ reliability.\n\nIf there is a criticism to be made of Helter Skelter, it may be that it can be redundant. Entire scenes from early episodes in the series are replayed in later episodes, presumably to more clearly establish their significance in the larger narrative of the nearly six-hour-long documentary. While sometimes disorienting, the strategy also allows the filmmakers to build on previously established details once other aspects of the story have been revealed. We learn about Hinman’s murder, for instance, in the first episode. But it’s even more unsettling when we come back to it in episode five, after we’ve learned about Hinman’s killer, Bobby Beausoleil, and the circumstances around the murder.\n\nIf the past 50 years have proved anything, it’s that Helter Skelter is unlikely to be the final word on Charles Manson. “There’s never been a lack of interest in the Manson story,” says the author Deborah Herman at the end of the series, “because it was such an aberration. It changed society.”\n\nOr maybe, it’s simply because Manson was so extraordinarily skilled at manipulating people. Stephanie Schram, the former family member, offers her own explanation for why we can’t seem to get enough: “That little thing that Charlie had, whatever it was, that made people go to him,” she says in the film. “Maybe that’s part of the reason we’re still talking about it. That almost supernatural, whatever the heck it was about him. Maybe that’s it. I don’t know.”\n\nHelter Skelter premieres on Epix on July 26th."
