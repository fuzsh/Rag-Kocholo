Hollywood stars the dream pairing of Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio, has a generous budget of $95-$100 million, and will no doubt be one of the biggest films of 2019.\n\nHere’s everything we know about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood:\n\nThe plot\n\nOUATIH keeps being referred to as the “Manson movie”, but its scope looks to be wider than that. It will certainly not be a biopic on cult leader and serial killer Charles Manson, and, instead, the Tate-LaBianca murders look to be more of a backdrop to the narrative.\n\nAs Deadline put it, calling the film a Manson movie “is akin to calling Inglourious Basterds a movie about Adolf Hitler, when the Nazi leader was only in a scene or two\".\n\nTarantino described it in a statement as “a story that takes place in Los Angeles in 1969, at the height of hippy Hollywood.\n\n35 great films that bombed at the box office\n\nShow all 35\n\n“The two lead characters are Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio), former star of a Western TV series, and his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt),” he explained. “Both are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don’t recognise anymore. But Rick has a very famous next-door neighbour … Sharon Tate.\"\n\nTarantino is a cinephile with a keen interest in film history, and the title Once Upon a Time in Hollywood suggests this will be his portrait of a town he knows very well.\n\n“I’ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was seven years old,” Tarantino added. “I’m very excited to tell this story of an LA and a Hollywood that doesn't exist anymore.\"\n\nThe tone\n\nTarantino has said that OUATIH is “probably the closest [film] to Pulp Fiction that I have done,” suggesting that it will have a tapestry-like quality, and possibly a non-linear narrative.\n\nWatch Apple TV+ free for 7 days\n\nNew subscribers only. £8.99/mo. after free trial.

It’s not easily describable.\"\n\nThe trailer\n\nYou can find the first teaser trailer here.\n\nBack in June, DiCaprio (below) and co-star Margot Robbie (above) both shared “first looks” from the set:\n\nThe cast\n\nOUATIH’s cast is one of the greatest and most eclectic ever assembled, involving everyone from Al Pacino to Lena Dunham, and involving portrayals of Hollywood figures like Roman Polanski and Bruce Lee.\n\nThe full cast list is as follows:\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio as Rick Dalton\n\n- An actor who starred in the Western television series Bounty Law from 1958 to 1963. His attempt to transition to movies did not work out and in 1969, he is struggling, guesting on other people’s shows while contemplating going to Italy – which has become a hotbed for low-budget Westerns. He is neighbours with Sharon Tate.\n\nBrad Pitt as Cliff Booth\n\n- Rick’s longtime stunt double and close friend.\n\nMargot Robbie as Sharon Tate\n\n- A pregnant actress married to Roman Polanski, who was murdered in her home by followers of Charles Manson.\n\nBruce Dern as George Spahn (the part originally belonged to Burt Reynolds, but he died in September 2018 before filming his scenes)\n\n- An 80-year-old near-blind man who rented his LA ranch out to be used as the location for Westerns. Manson convinced Spahn to allow him and his followers to live on the ranch, in the months before they murdered Sharon Tate and six others. In exchange for rent, Manson coerced his female followers into hopping into bed with the ranch owner and serving as his seeing eye guides.\n\nDamian Lewis as Steve McQueen\n\n- An actor and friend of Jay Sebring, who was invited by him to the home of Sharon Tate for a dinner party, but he was unable to show up.\n\nLuke Perry as Wayne Maunder\n\n- An actor who co-starred on the western television series Lancer.\n\nThe 65 best movie insults of all time\n\nShow all 49\n\nDamon Herriman as Charles Manson\n\nEmile Hirsch as Jay Sebring\n\n- A Hollywood hairstylist and friend of Sharon Tate who was murdered in the home of Tate by followers of Charles Manson.\n\nDakota Fanning as Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme\n\n- A member of the infamous Manson family who obtained her nickname whilst living on George Spahn’s ranch.\n\nClifton Collins Jr as Ernesto “The Mexican” Vaquero\n\nKeith Jefferson as Land Pirate Keith\n\nNicholas Hammond as Sam Wanamaker\n\n- An actor-director who, in 1969, began a campaign to rebuild the Shakespeare’s Globe in London.\n\nAl Pacino as Marvin Shwarz\n\n- Rick Dalton’s agent.\n\nScoot McNairy as Business Bob Gilbert\n\n- A fictional cowboy character on Bounty Law.\n\nSpencer Garrett as Allen Kincade\n\n- The television personality and interviewer to Hollywood’s elite.\n\nMike Moh as Bruce Lee\n\n- The international actor-stuntman who choreographed fight scenes for The Wrecking Crew, which starred Sharon Tate. Following her murder, he attended her funeral and was also privately investigated.\n\nLena Dunham as Catherine Share:\n\n- A member of the Manson family who was not directly involved with the Tate murders.\n\nAustin Butler as Charles “Tex” Watson:\n\n- A central member of the Manson family who, alongside three other members, was directly involved in the Tate murders.\n\nRafal Zawierucha as Roman Polanski:\n\n- An acclaimed filmmaker and husband of Tate, who was in Europe working on a film when Tate was murdered.\n\nSamantha Robinson as Abigail Folger:\n\n- Wojciech Frykowski‘s lover, as well as heiress to the Folger coffee fortune. She was murdered in the home of Sharon Tate by followers of Charles Manson.\n\nRumer Willis as Joanna Pettet\n\n- A famous English actor\n\nWhich recent movies will become classics?\n\nShow all 21\n\nDreama Walker as Connie Stevens\n\n- An American actor who starred in Hawaiian Eye .\n\nMaya Hawke as Flower Child\n\nMargaret Qualley as Kitty Kat\n\nVictoria Pedretti as Lulu\n\nMadisen Beaty as Katie\n\nLorenza Izzo as Francesca Cappuci\n\nEddie Perez as Land Pirate Eddie\n\nMaurice Compte as Land Pirate Mao\n\nCosta Ronin as Voytek Frykowski\n\nIn undisclosed roles:\n\nZoë Bell, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Kurt Russell, Timothy Olyphant, James Marsden, Julia Butters, James Remar, Martin Kove, Brenda Vaccaro, Nichole Galicia, Craig Stark, Marco Rodríguez, Ramón Franco, Danny Strong, Sydney Sweeney, Mikey Madison and Raul Cardona.\n\nThe script\n\nTarantino is known for his novelistic scripts and peerless talent for writing dialogue. Sony Pictures chairman Tom Rothman said of the director’s latest script: “It’s the best screenplay that I have had the privilege to read.\"\n\nDiCaprio added: “As an LA native, having read the script, it’s one of the most amazing screenplays. We are going to do our best job to make it fantastic.\"\n\nThe release date\n\n26 July, 2019.\n\nThe film was originally set for release on 9 August 2019, the 50th anniversary of the Manson Family murders, but Sony has since brought the date forward slightly (26 July).\n\nPrincipal photography began in Los Angeles, California on 18 June 2018 and wrapped on 1 November 2018.\n\nThe poster\n\nA new poster for the movie was released on Monday, 18 March 2019, featuring Pitt and DiCaprio.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
