        "text": "British singer-songwriter and guitarist (born 1946)\n\nFor other people called Dave or David Mason, see David Mason (disambiguation).\n\nMusical artist\n\nDavid Thomas Mason (born 10 May 1946)[3] is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist from Worcester, who first found fame with the rock band Traffic, and went on to play and record with [4] many notable pop and rock musicians, including Paul McCartney, George Harrison, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, Michael Jackson, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Steve Winwood, Fleetwood Mac, Delaney & Bonnie, Leon Russell, and Cass Elliot.\n\nOne of Mason's best known songs is \"Feelin' Alright\", recorded by Traffic in 1968 and later by many other performers, including Joe Cocker, whose version of the song was a hit in 1969. For Traffic, he also wrote \"Hole in My Shoe\", a psychedelic pop song that became a hit in its own right. \"Only You Know and I Know\" became a signature song for Delaney and Bonnie, and \"We Just Disagree\", Mason's 1977 solo U.S. hit, written by Jim Krueger, has become a staple of U.S. classic hits and adult contemporary radio playlists.[5][6]\n\nIn 2004, Mason started a new electric guitar company with business partner and industrial designer Ravi Sawhney,[7] the same year as he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a founding member of Traffic.[8]\n\nMusical career\n\n[edit]\n\nTraffic\n\n[edit]\n\nMason's tenure with Traffic was disjointed. He was a founding member of the group, but left following the release of their debut album, Mr. Fantasy (1967), only to rejoin halfway through the sessions for their next album, Traffic (1968), after which he left again. Last Exit (1969), a compilation of odds and ends, features little material by Mason apart from his song \"Just for You\". Traffic later re-formed without Mason, although he briefly began working with the band for a third time, touring with them in 1971 and playing on Welcome to the Canteen. In his brief spells with the group, Mason never did quite fit in; Steve Winwood later recalled, \"We all [Winwood, Jim Capaldi and Chris Wood] tended to write together, but Mason would come in with a complete song that he was going to sing and tell us all what he expected us to play. No discussion, like we were his backing group.\"\n\nSession work\n\n[edit]\n\nMason was a friend of guitarist Jimi Hendrix, whose rock career was launched in England in 1966. Hendrix first heard the song \"All Along the Watchtower\", from Bob Dylan's album John Wesley Harding, with Mason at the apartment of a friend who had acquired a prior release of the album. Hendrix recorded his own version at Olympic Studios, South West London, with Mason playing 12-string acoustic guitar. The song was released on the album Electric Ladyland in September 1968.[9] Mason also sings backing vocals on \"Crosstown Traffic\". When it came out as a single in October, it hit No. 5 in the UK Singles Chart and reached the Top 40 in the US. Mason later recorded his own version of the song for his 1974 album, Dave Mason, with Bob Glaub on bass. Mason appears on the Rolling Stones' 1968 album Beggars Banquet, playing the Shehnai and bass drum on Street Fighting Man.[10][11] Mason's connection was Jimmy Miller, who served as producer for the Stones and Traffic. In 1969â€“1970, Mason toured with Delaney and Bonnie and Friends, along with Eric Clapton and George Harrison. Mason appears on George Harrison's 1970 solo set All Things Must Pass. In 1970, Mason was slated to be the second guitarist for Derek and the Dominos. He played on their early studio sessions, including the Phil Spector production of \"Tell the Truth\", which was withdrawn from sale and eventually released on Eric Clapton's 1988 box set Crossroads. He also played at their first gig at the London Lyceum but left the group soon after that. He co-wrote the song \"Big Thirst\" on Oh How We Danced, by Jim Capaldi (Mason's bandmate in the Hellions, Deep Feeling, and Traffic), and played the guitar solo on \"Don't Be a Hero\".\n\nSolo career\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter Traffic, Mason pursued a moderately successful solo career. His first single was \"Just for You\"; on the B-side, \"Little Woman\", he was backed by the band Family, following his production of Family's first album, 1968's Music in a Doll's House (which included \"Never Like This\", an original Mason song). He released his first solo album in 1970 Alone Together[12] featuring \"Only You Know and I Know\", which reached No. 42 on the Billboard chart, as well as the lesser hit \"Look at You, Look at Me\". A collaboration with Cass Elliot followed in 1971. In the early 1970s Mason enlisted his friend, singer-songwriter Ray Kennedy, to tour and write for his next album. In the mid- to late 1970s, he toured and recorded with guitarist Jim Krueger, keyboardist Mike Finnigan, bassist Gerald Johnson and drummer Rick Jaeger. Mason followed up with the album, Let It Flow, released in April 1977. The album peaked at only No. 37, but was in the charts for 49 weeks and went platinum as a result carried by the success of the album single \"We Just Disagree\", which was written by Mason's backup guitarist, Jim Krueger. The single topped at #12, and other album singles \"So High (Rock Me Baby and Roll Me Away)\" and \"Let It Go, Let It Flow\" also charted in the U.S. Mason's next album was Mariposa de Oro, released in 1978. The album contained a cover of \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow,\" which became a Top 40 single; the album itself reached number 41 and went gold. Mason played himself in the film Skatetown, U.S.A., performing two songs in a roller disco as well as writing and performing the film's theme song. In 1980 Mason released Old Crest on a New Wave; the album stalled at number 74 and had one single make the charts, \"Save Me.\" This failure of the album resulted in Mason leaving his label Columbia. Mason struggled to attract another major label but continued to tour in an acoustic duo with Krueger. In 1987, he released two albums, Some Assembly Required on the Canadian label Maze Records and Two Hearts on MCA Records; the latter album featured the single \"Dreams I Dream,\" a duet with Phoebe Snow that reached number 11 in the adult contemporary charts.[13]\n\nIn 1997, Mason was scheduled to be a member of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band, performing \"Only You Know and I Know,\" \"We Just Disagree\" and \"Feelin' Alright,\" but he was dropped from rehearsals before the tour started.\n\nIn 1998, Mason reunited with his former Traffic bandmate Jim Capaldi for The 40,000 Headmen Tour; a live album followed the tour. In 2002, he released the DVD Dave Mason: Live at Sunrise, a recording of a live performance at the Sunrise Musical Theater in Sunrise, Florida,[14] backed by Bobby Scumaci on keyboards, Johnne Sambataro on rhythm guitar (who rejoined Mason for the DVD, after previously touring with him in 1978), John Lundahl on rhythm guitar, Richard Campbell on bass and Greg Babcock on drums. In 2008 Mason released his first studio album in more than 20 years, titled 26 Letters 12 Notes. He followed up with another album in 2014 called Future's Past.\n\nAs of 2018, Mason was continuing to perform in the US, including a 2018 tour with Steve Cropper.[15][16]\n\nTenure in Fleetwood Mac\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a brief period in the mid-1990s, Mason joined Fleetwood Mac and released the album Time with them in 1995. He toured with them over the course of 1994â€“95, including opening for REO Speedwagon and Crosby, Stills & Nash.[17]\n\nMason was never entirely comfortable during his time in Fleetwood Mac. He has said several times since leaving the band: \"Being one of two and at times three guitarists to replace Lindsey Buckingham says more about Buckingham's genius than my guitar playing\".[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMason moved permanently to the United States in 1971, and lived in the Ojai Valley in California for 16 years. As of September 2017 he had homes in Carson City, Nevada and Hawaii.[18]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\n[edit]\n\nMason is a proponent of music education for children. In 2005, he signed on as an official supporter of Little Kids Rock, a non-profit organization that provides free musical instruments and lessons to children in American public schools. He sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary member.\n\nMason also is a founding board member of Yoga Blue, a non-profit organisation devoted to teaching yoga and other holistic practices to those recovering from substance abuse and other self-destructive disorders.\n\nMason and his longtime friend Ted Knapp have founded Rock Our Vets, an all-volunteer 501(c)3 charity supported by many other musicians, helping military veterans and the families of law enforcement and firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty.[19] The charity has focused on providing food and clothing to homeless veterans, laptop computers for veterans aspiring to continue their education, as well as suicide prevention.\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nSolo\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nDave Mason studio albums Year Album US[20] CAN[21] Certification Label 1970 Alone Together 22 24\n\nUS: Gold[22]\n\nBlue Thumb Records 1971 Dave Mason & Cass Elliot 49 â€” Blue Thumb Records 1972 Headkeeper 50 â€” Blue Thumb Records 1973 It's Like You Never Left 25 â€” Columbia Records 1974 Dave Mason 27 31\n\nUS: Gold[22]\n\nColumbia Records 1975 Split Coconut 37 85 Columbia Records 1977 Let It Flow 41 36\n\nUS: Platinum[22]\n\nColumbia Records 1978 Mariposa de Oro 74 46\n\nUS: Gold[22]\n\nColumbia Records 1980 Old Crest on a New Wave 74 â€” Columbia Records 1987 Two Hearts â€” â€” MCA Records 1987 Some Assembly Required â€” â€” Chumley Records 2008 26 Letters - 12 Notes â€” â€” Out the Box/Sony 2014 Future's Past â€” â€” Something-Music 2017 Pink Lipstick (EP) â€” â€” Barham Productions 2020 Alone Together, Again â€” â€” Barham Productions\n\nLive albums\n\n[edit]\n\n1973: Dave Mason Is Alive (ABC/Blue Thumb/MCA) (recorded at the Troubadour, West Hollywood, CA, 1971) â€“ US #116[23]\n\n1976: Certified Live (Columbia) (recorded on tour, 1975) â€“ US #78[23]\n\n1999: Live: The 40,000 Headmen Tour (with Jim Capaldi) (Receiver Records) (recorded at various locations, Feb-April 1998)\n\n2002: Live at Perkins Palace (Pioneer) (recorded 1981)\n\n2002: Dave Mason: Live at Sunrise (Image Entertainment)\n\n2004: XM Radio (Barham Productions) (recorded May 2003)\n\nReissued with bonus tracks in 2007 as Dave Mason Live at XM Satellite Radio (Friday Music)\n\n2015: Traffic Jam (Barham Productions)\n\nCompilation albums\n\n[edit]\n\n1972: Scrapbook (Island Records)\n\n1974: The Best of Dave Mason (Blue Thumb) â€“ US #183[23]\n\n1974: At His Best (ABC Records) â€“ US #133[23]\n\n1978: The Very Best of Dave Mason (ABC/Blue Thumb) â€“ US #179[23]\n\n1978: Skatetown, U.S.A.
