On an April afternoon, I arrived at the Hollywood Art Deco building that has long served as Fincher’s base of operations, where he was about to look at footage from his 10th feature film, “Gone Girl,” then in postproduction. We headed upstairs and found the editor Kirk Baxter assembling a scene. Fincher watched it once through, then asked Baxter to replay a five-second stretch. It was a seemingly simple tracking shot, the camera traveling alongside Ben Affleck as he entered a living room in violent disarray: overturned ottoman, shattered glass. The camera moved at the same speed as Affleck, gliding with unvarying smoothness, which is exactly how Fincher likes his shots to behave. Except that three seconds in, something was off. “There’s a bump,” he said.\n\nNo living director surpasses Fincher’s reputation for exactitude. Any account of his methods invariably mentions how many takes he likes to shoot, which can annoy him, not because this is inaccurate but because it abets a vision of him as a dictatorially fussy artiste. Fincher, who is 58, argues that this caricature misses the point: If you want to build worlds as engrossing as those he seeks to construct, then you need actors to push their performances into zones of fecund uncertainty, to shed all traces of what he calls “presentation.” And then you need them to give you options, all while hitting the exact same marks (which goes for the camera operators too) to ensure there will be no continuity errors when you cut the scene together. Getting all these stars to align before, say, Take No. 9 is possible but unlikely. “I get, He’s a perfectionist,” Fincher volunteered. “No. There’s just a difference between mediocre and acceptable.”\n\nBaxter played the sequence again, and this time I spotted a little artifact of the camera operator’s hand — a hiccup before the shot came to rest. Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer on “Gone Girl” and several other Fincher features, told me later that Fincher stays vigilant for any distractions onscreen that might pull audiences off “the ride” he’s constructing. “It could be unconscious — you could come out of a movie that had 10 soft shots, meaning they’re out of focus, and say, ‘That was pretty good.’ But David’s thought process is to eliminate all of that — to fight to make sure that there aren’t any of those mistakes.” Brad Pitt, who has starred in three Fincher films, recalled times when they would “be doing a shot, and there would be the slightest imperceptible wiggle from the camera, and you could see Finch literally tense up — like, it physically hurts him.”\n\nFincher put an encouraging hand on Baxter’s shoulder: “Looks great otherwise,” he said. We returned to Fincher’s office, where fabric swatches suspended overhead softened the sun pouring in from a skylight. I hadn’t realized it, but Fincher was at something of a crossroads. “Gone Girl” was due out that October, and although he had adapted it with the author Gillian Flynn from her enormously popular thriller, the film’s commercial success was in no way guaranteed. His previous feature, “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” — a lavish, lurid $90 million adaptation of another best seller, meant to kick off a trilogy — came in fourth at the box office on its opening holiday weekend, underperforming such competitors as “Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked.” The trilogy was put on ice.\n\nFincher had worked in Hollywood long enough to take this in relative stride. He was familiar with the business’s unpredictability, not to mention its venality. In recent years, though, studios had grown ever hungrier for blockbusters and ever less likely to finance the mid-budget movies Fincher excelled at, like his masterpiece, “Zodiac” (2007) or “The Social Network” (2010). Or, for that matter, an unmade project called “Mank,” the screenplay of which, written by Fincher’s journalist father, Jack, sat on a shelf in his office among Taschen tomes and other bric-a-brac. “Mank” told the story of how the screenwriter Herman Mankiewicz came to write “Citizen Kane” (the landmark 1941 Orson Welles film, about a loosely fictionalized version of the American tycoon William Randolph Hearst) while slowly drinking himself to death.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
