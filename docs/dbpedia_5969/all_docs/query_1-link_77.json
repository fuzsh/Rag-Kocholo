        "text": "Dave Grohl said today at the Sundance Film Festival that he almost put convicted serial killer Charles Manson in his music documentary Sound City, which premiered here over last week. “Manson recorded at Sound City and at one point we considered talking to him about music because how f***ing insane would that be,” the first-time director and Foo Fighters frontman said Tuesday. “But we decided not to because we didn’t want it to take over the beautiful message of the movie — but we considered it.”\n\nManson recorded demos in the late 1960s at the famed San Fernando Valley recording studio that’s the subject of Sound City. Found guilty of murdering Sharon Tate and others in 1970, Manson has been in prison ever since and has repeatedly been denied parole. “He was a musician before he got busted. He was friends with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, and Dennis Wilson said ‘Here, go record some demos, I’ll pay for it, there’s this place called Sound City,” Grohl said this morning during an appearance with Prince Avalanche director David Gordon Green at Sundance’s Cinema Café. A number of bands have covered Manson’s songs over the years.\n\nRelated: Sundance: Dave Grohl’s ‘Sound City’ Concert Rocks Park City\n\nAs the Sound City documentary shows, Grohl’s former band Nirvana also recorded at the Van Nuys studio, as did Guns’N’Roses, Rick Springfield, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac, Cheap Trick, Neil Young, Red Hot Chili Peppers and many more. A star-studded Sound City concert in Park City followed the film’s premiere Friday. Before the festival, Gravitas Ventures acquired worldwide VOD rights to Sound City."
