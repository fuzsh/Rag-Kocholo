        "text": "Here an update about the first deployment of the brand new Dutch F-35s. I wrote this article a month ago; but still nice to share it here\n\nHere a video of the first deployment.\n\nFrom Monday, November 9, 2020, the exercise Frisian Lightning II started at Volkel Air Base. During this exercise, the new F-35A Lightning II fighter aircraft from Leeuwarden Air Base were sent to a domestic deployment for the first time in the Dutch history of this aircraft. At the end of the afternoon, the four brand new F-35A Lightning II fighters landed at Volkel Air Base. The landing of these aircraft attracted the attention of aircraft spotters who were ready to welcome the aircraft.\n\nThe exercise would last until Friday November 20, when the aircraft will fly back to Leeuwarden. The aircraft will fly two waves per day during the exercise. The first wave will take place in the afternoon and will be flown in daylight. The second wave is flown in the darkness of the evening. The flights will take about an hour and a half each time. The intention is that during these flights as many F-35s as possible will be launched in order to train as much as possible.\n\nThe entire detachment from Leeuwarden consists of about 150 men and women. The pilots who participate in this exercise are all qualified; they are all trained on the F-35 and all have years of experience on the F-16. Previously, the logistics, IT and security departments of the squadron already practiced at Leeuwarden Air Base during the exercise Frisian Lightning I. Here they trained in packing and preparing ground equipment and spare parts. therefore this exercise was a dry run in preparation for a real move. The experiences and lessons learned from that exercise are now applied in this second exercise. This time it concerns a transfer to another air base within the Netherlands.\n\nDuring this exercise, the 322 Squadron from Leeuwarden will be based temporary at Volkel. This exercise focuses on the logistical relocation of the unit and is part of the step-by-step plan that will lead to an initial deployment capacity of the squadron at the end of 2021.\n\nThe exercise, called Frisian Lightning II, is the second in a series of exercises. The exercise is therefore part of the so-called “Road To Initial Operational Capability” (R2IOC). Where the Royal Netherlands Air Force knows exactly what to bring along with the F-16 Fighting Falcon and what the packing plan looks like, this is all new with the F-35A Lightning II.\n\nWhat should personnel do with it during the deployment, does it fit in a container and is everything in order administratively? During this exercise, one will try out how to do this with this new weapon system in practice. A roadmap has been prepared by the Royal Netherlands Air Force for the full introduction of the F-35 to the unit.\n\nThis roadmap started from the arrival of the first aircraft at Leeuwarden at the end of 2019 and will continue until the IOC is achieved at the end of 2021. One of the steps is this relocation exercise that takes place at Volkel. In addition, the Royal Netherlands Air Force is continuously taking steps, such as further building up the squadron and continuous training of personnel (pilots, technicians, armaments, IT staff).\n\nThe facets of flying such as night flying ops, loading and dropping training bombs are also part of the R2IOC. If the unit achieves Initial Operational Capability (IOC) by the end of 2021, it means that the 322 Squadron will be able to deploy a unit of four F-35s including personnel and equipment for a short period of time anywhere in the world. The next step is a similar deployment exercise abroad. Then personnel will find out whether the RNLAF has everything ready when the national borders are crossed.\n\nRNLAF 313 Squadron stops F-16 activity and starts conversion to the F-35A.\n\nHere a video of the F-16s\n\nAt the end of December 2020, the 313 Squadron at Volkel Air Base will cease its current activities with the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The unit is released from operational duty to begin its conversion to the F-35A Lightning II. The conversion will start in early 2021. The pilots will leave to the United States to Luke Air Force Base in the state of Arizona. At this American airbase, the Royal Netherlands Air Force currently has eight F-35As that are used for the training of the pilots. The pilots will be trained in the course of the following year. The ex F-16 pilots no longer have to go through the entire program, because they are, after all, already qualified fighter pilots. This is therefore only a conversion training on the Lockheed-Martin F-35A Lightning II. The fact that the pilots already have experience on the F-16 is a plus, but that does not mean that the conversion training is immediately an easy training, because the F-35A is an advanced aircraft and cannot be compared with the F-16. The ground crew will receive the necessary training at the American Eglin Air Force Base in the state of Florida. All American ground personnel for the F-35 are also trained at this American airbase. The Dutch personnel here only receive the necessary basic lessons on the new fighter type of air force. They will follow the real “on the job” training at Leeuwarden Air Base later in 2021. Here they will learn the job by learning from more experienced colleagues from the 322 Squadron. This unit of the Royal Netherlands Air Force has been using the F-35A since October 2019. people learn from experienced colleagues and will take this knowledge back to Volkel Air Base at a later date in 2022.\n\nOnce the pilots have completed their conversion training in America, the 313 Squadron will temporarily reside at Leeuwarden Air Base, probably in the second half of 2021. Here, too, the main goal is that the pilots of the 313 Squadron will learn from their experienced colleagues from the 322 Squadron. At Leeuwarden, the 313 Squadron will therefore start its road to initial operational status as a squadron. If everything goes according to plan, the 313 Squadron will not be relocated to Volkel Air Base until 2022. How this timeline will develop has not yet been fully determined, because the conversion to the F-35 depends on many different factors such as deliveries of aircraft and progress of training etc. After a period of 32 years, the 313 Squadron will stop flying the legendary F-16 Fighting Falcon. The unit received its first F-16s in 1988, when the unit was still based at Twenthe Air Base. From December 2005, the first F-16s from 313 Squadron were moved to Volkel. Since then, the Brabant airbase has been home to the 313 Squadron, which is known for its emblem depicting the tiger. The 313 Squadron is the second operational unit after the 322 Squadron to fly the F-35A. About 25 F-16s are currently based on Volkel. The best airframes with the fewest flight hours on the clock will be transferred to the 312 Squadron. Now that the 313 Squadron is about to start its conversion to the F-35A, from January 2021, the 312 Squadron will be the only operational unit on the F-16 left in the Netherlands. A few F-16s still fly at Leeuwarden every day, but those operations will also disappear in 2021, making Leeuwarden the first airbase in the Netherlands to be fully operational on the F-35A.\n\nI made a post for the navy part earlier. But what does the defensienota 2022 mean for the air force?\n\nWell, a whole six F-35 and four Reapers will be added to the existing orders. It might not seem like a lot, but in Dutch we say something about een gegeven paard...\n\nZo is het maar net.... een gegeven paard moet je nooit in de kont kijken!\n\n\"Voor deze elite-eenheden wordt ook een helikoptereenheid ingericht.\"\n\nDoes this mean that for this upgraded Luchtmobiele Brigade eenheid, KLu will get more helicopters?\n\nHere we can find some more information:\n\nNetherlands Defence Note\n\nNetherlands Defence Note On 1 June 2022, the Dutch Minister of Defence, Kajsa Ollongren, officially presented the Defence Note 2022. The government is allocating an additional budg...\n\n- an order for six additional F-35A Lightning IIs, increasing the total number of F-35As to 52\n\n- establishing a third F-35A squadron next to 322 Squadron at Leeuwarden air base and 313 Squadron at Volkel air base\n\n- an order for four additional MQ-9A Reaper Unmanned Combat Aerial System, increasing the capacity to eight Reapers\n\n- all Reapers will be armed, the Parliament will be informed in 2023 with a Statement of Needs (so-called A letter)\n\n- upgrading the AS532 Cougar squadron to support special operations\n\n- replacing the AS532 Cougar with a Medium Utility Helicoper, the Parliament will be informed in 2023 with a Statement of Needs (so-called A letter)\n\n- replacing the C-130H/C-130H-30 air transport capacity *) and adding an extra aircraft, the Parliament will be informed this year on the research phase (so-called B letter)\n\n1. So probably these 52 F-35 gives KLu the possibility to convert the last F-16 squadron into a full F-35 squadron.\n\n2. The AS532 Cougars will be upgraded (into CSAR configuration?) to support the LB, but...\n\n3. The AS532 Cougars will be also replaced by a new type of helicopters. Adding more NH90s will be logic, if the Netherlands is satisfied about the performance and reliability of the NH90."
