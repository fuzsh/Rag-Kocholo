Have an account? .\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Now it is time for the Embraer C-390'\n\nIn July, the Dutch Ministry of Defense acquired nine C-390 Millenium aircraft in a joint deal signed at the Farnborough Airshow in the UK, allocating five to the Netherlands and four to Austria.\n\n\"This aircraft is the best choice in the market, offering an unbeatable combination of high performance, advanced technology, and low life cycle costs,\" Bosco da Costa Jr., president and CEO of Brazilian defense firm Embraer, said.\n\nThe new C-390s would replace the Austrian Air Forces' aging fleet of three C-130s, which have an average age of 56 years after the country acquired secondhand from the UK's Royal Air Force.\n\n\"Since 2003, the three Hercules aircraft have completed many missions and have always been a reliable transport device for our soldiers,\" Austrian Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner said last September. \"Now it is time for the Embraer C-390.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSpacious cargo hold and fast speeds\n\nThe C-390 offers some advantages over the C-130: roomier cargo capacity and high airspeeds.\n\nThe twin-engined C-390 aircraft measures just over 115 feet in length and 38 feet tall, with a wing span of 115 feet.\n\nThe C-390's cargo hold is about 60 feet long and can carry a maximum payload of 26 metric tons (about 57,000 pounds) — with space to accommodate light vehicles, heavy vehicles, and helicopters.\n\nThe C-390 can fly at a maximum altitude of 36,000 feet and reach speeds of about 614 miles per hour. It also has a range of 1,080 nautical miles at full capacity.\n\nBy comparison, the C-130 has a slightly smaller cargo hold and travels at slower speeds, but newer variants have a longer range than the C-390.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA multi-mission workhorse\n\nThe C-390 Millenium is a versatile military transport aircraft that can be configured for a range of missions in three hours or less.\n\nIt can be deployed for cargo and troop transport, medical evacuations, aerial firefighting, search and rescue missions, and rendering humanitarian aid.\n\nFeaturing air-to-air refueling equipment, it can operate as both a tanker to refuel other aircraft or be refueled by another C-390.\n\nSimilarly, the C-130 functions as an aerial refueling aircraft as well as a tactical passenger and cargo airlift.\n\nWith the longest, continuous military aircraft production run in history, the Hercules is produced in over 70 variants. The latest of them, the C-130J Super Hercules, has logged more than 1 million flight hours carrying out combat, humanitarian, special ops, and refueling missions since it entered service in the late 1990s.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nC-390 around the world\n\nThe joint C-390 acquisition by the Netherlands and Austria comes after South Korea — a longtime operator of the C-130 — became Embraer's first customer in Asia last year.\n\nIn December, the country's Defense Acquisition Program Administration acquired three C-390s in a $544 million deal, or 710 billion won.\n\nThe C-390 first entered the Brazilian Air Force in 2019, later joining the Hungarian Defense Forces in 2020 and the Portuguese Air Force in 2023. Other countries have since been eyeing the C-390, including Sweden, Egypt, India, and Singapore.\n\nBy contrast, more than 2,500 C-130 aircraft have been ordered or delivered to 63 countries to date, according to Lockheed Martin, and 70 countries are known to operate them, including Canada, the UK, Japan, and Israel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe C-390 in development\n\nDevelopment of the C-390 first began in the late 2000s after Embraer was contracted to develop two prototypes of the medium-sized transport aircraft.\n\nIn its third attempt to build the aircraft, the first production of the C-390 made its maiden flight in October 2018. The Brazilian Air Force received its first C-390 in September 2019, and two months later, the cargo plane debuted at the Dubai Airshow, entering the global market with a new name: the C-390 Millenium.\n\nThe current C-390 fleet in operation has since completed more than 13,000 flight hours.\n\nRiding in the cargo hold\n\nThe cargo hold can accommodate up to 80 troops or up to 64 paratroopers. The cabin has temperature control and reduced vibration and noise, as well as a complete toilet and heated floors for passengers' comfort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMedical evacuations\n\nWhen deployed to support ground operations or disaster relief missions, the Millenium's cargo hold can be configured to carry up to 80 stretchers to transport survivors or casualties, or less litters to provide room for up to eight medical attendants and equipment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHigh-tech avionics\n\nThe C-390 is equipped with advanced tactical radar, threat detection systems, and aiming software that uses an algorithm to determine optimal drop points while giving the pilot an option to manually or automatically release cargo.\n\nThe interior, exterior, and cockpit systems have night vision capabilities for night flights, aerial refueling operations, or low-vision search and rescue missions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPitching the C-390 in the US\n\nWhile there haven't been any public negotiations by the Pentagon to add any C-390s to its fleet, Embraer has made moves to pitch the plane to the US market.\n\nIn an inaugural visit earlier this year, the Brazilian defense firm showcased the C-390 at its facilities in Melbourne, Florida, to \"an important and diverse audience,\" the company said in a March statement.\n\nAccording to a press release, the event hosted a \"diverse guest list of government authorities, military officials, prospects, and partners\" and featured the A-29 Super Tucano, a turboprop light attack aircraft flown by some South American militaries.\n\nThe Embraer president da Costa Jr. said the A-29 was built \"just hours away in Jacksonville, Florida,\" hinting that the C-390 could be manufactured in the US as well — a common requirement for foreign aircraft operated by the US military.\n\n\"The A-29 Super Tucano has been an important part of our manufacturing footprint in Florida for over 10 years,\" da Costa Jr. said at the time, \"and we see big opportunities for both aircraft in the market with perhaps the potential to bring the C-390 here as well.\"\n\nRead next\n\nBrazil US Air Force\n\nAdvertisement"
