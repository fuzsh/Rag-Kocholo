        "text": "Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group (Marshall ADG) has been awarded a long-term contract by the Netherlands Defence Material Organisation (DMO) to sustain the Royal Netherlands Air Force’s fleet of Hercules C-130s, which have recently received extensive Cockpit Upgrade (CUP) and Cabin Safety Improvements (CSIMP) modifications.\n\nUnder a CUP and CSIMP Sustainment Programme (CCSP), Marshall ADG will provide the Netherlands DMO with airworthiness, maintenance and reliability information gathered from the many OEMs whose equipment was installed during the modifications and which were embodied by Marshall ADG.\n\nThe Netherlands DMO will have a single point of contact for sustaining the availability of the many items that comprise the systems installed, and the information, advice and guidance Marshall ADG provides will be input into the airworthiness procedures of the Netherlands Military Airworthiness Authority.\n\nSteve Fitz-Gerald, CEO of Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group, comments: “We are thrilled to have won this contract to support the fleet of the Royal Netherlands Air Force C-130s. This innovative long-term sustainment contract follows on from the recent successful modification, refurbishment and upgrade of the fleet where we designed, integrated, installed, tested and certified the Cockpit Upgrade Programme (CUP) and Cabin Safety Improvement Programme (CSIMP) which make the RNLAF’s aircraft some of the most capable C-130Hs in the world.”\n\nMarshall’s relationship with the C-130 platform and its OEM, Lockheed Martin, dates back to the early 1960s and, in addition to standard MRO and deeper maintenance work, the company has performed more than 1,500 modifications and upgrades for over 35 C-130 military and civil operators worldwide."
