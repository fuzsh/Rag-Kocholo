        "text": "The Royal Norwegian Air Force (RNoAF) has received back from Lockheed Martin the first C-130J-30 Super Hercules transport aircraft to have received a Block 8.1 upgrade, the company announced on 21 February 2024.\n\nThe RNoAF operates a fleet of four C-130J-30s, which it received between 2008 and 2012. All four are receiving the Block 8.1 upgrade, with the work being conducted at Lockheed Martin’s site in Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nThe first upgraded Norwegian Super Hercules was recently ferried from Greenville by an RNoAF crew back to Norway, where the C-130J-30 fleet is operated by the RNoAF’s 335 Squadron out of Gardermoen Air Station.\n\nThe Block 8.1 upgrade contains software and hardware expansions that deliver greater global reach, enhanced navigation and additional defensive capabilities. Specifically, the upgrade includes: a new flight management system that complies with CNS/ATM mandates, and includes vertical navigation with coupled auto throttle; civil GPS; ground power modes; an updated identification friend or foe (IFF) system; a CNS/ATM datalink; an enhanced inter-communication system; enhanced approach and landing systems; expanded diagnostics; an improved PA system; additional covert lighting; and International Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue (IAMSAR)-compliant search pattern programming.\n\nThe Super Hercules Block Upgrade Program is driven by the C-130J Super Hercules Joint User Group (JUG), of which Norway is a member and which Lockheed Martin claims is “the most mature tactical airlift operators’ group in the world”.\n\nBlock 8.1 is now the standard for all new production model Super Hercules aircraft and operators include, or will include, the US Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, as well as Australia, France, Germany and New Zealand.\n\nThe RNoAF was the first Foreign Military Sales customer for the C-130J Super Hercules."
