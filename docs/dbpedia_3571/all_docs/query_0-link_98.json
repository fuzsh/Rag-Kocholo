        "text": "The Australian Department of Defense (DoD) decided to buy more Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules freighters to replace the current fleet of aircraft of the same model.\n\nIn a statement about phase 1 of the AIR 7404 Project, the DoD clarifies that it is “replacing and expanding its current medium air mobility fleet of 12 C-130J Hercules aircraft.” The department further claims that it spoke with “various aircraft manufacturers and received information on all medium air mobility options available\".\n\nDespite not giving details of which other aircraft were evaluated, it is known that the Embraer C-390 Millennium, the Kawasaki C-2 and the Airbus A400M Atlas competed for the contract with the C-130, which won. “The relative merits of each aircraft type were assessed against Australia's capability requirements”, adds the department.\n\nThe DoD also did not disclose the number of aircraft to be acquired. According to Australian Defense Business Review, it is possible that 24 C-130J-30, the longest version of the turboprop, will be ordered. There is also a possibility that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has requested some KC-130J units for in-flight refueling, notes the portal.\n\nWith the selection, the United States Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) should soon publish a statement on the sale of Australian freighters, including the number of aircraft, equipment, cost and logistical support services.\n\n“Defence has identified that the new C-130J aircraft represents the only option that meets all of Australia's capability requirements and ensures Defense's medium air mobility capability without introducing substantial cost, schedule and capability risks. As a result, new C-130J aircraft will be the only option Defense will move forward for Government approval under Project AIR 7404 Phase 1 in 2023.”\n\nThe RAAF currently has 12 C-130Js, all operated by 37 Squadron from Richmond Air Force Base. It is possible that the new Super Hercules will also replace the C-27J Spartan, light freighters operated by 35 Squadron from Amberley base. The selection of the Super Hercules by the RAAF is seen as a victory for Lockheed after the Netherlands selected the Brazilian C-390 to replace its C-130s.\n\nRAAF C-130J-30 Super Hercules technical data"
