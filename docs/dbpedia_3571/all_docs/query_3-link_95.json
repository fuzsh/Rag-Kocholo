        "text": "The first KC-130J Hercules tanker-transport aircraft for Germany was rolled out of Lockheed Martin's Marietta production facility in Georgia on 26 January. (Lockheed Martin)\n\nThe first Lockheed Martin KC-130J tanker-transport aircraft for Germany was rolled out of the company's Marietta production facility in Georgia on 26 January.\n\nThe Luftwaffe has to date received two ‘stretched' C-130J-30 airlifters that it operates with the French Air and Space Force (Armee de l'Air et de l'Espace: AAE) as part of the joint C-130 air-transport squadron.\n\nWith the Luftwaffe contributing three KC-130J and three C-130J-30 aircraft, the AAE is providing two KC-130Js and two C-130J-30s for a combined fleet of five KC-130Js and five C-130J-30s. France has received all of its aircraft, while Germany's deliveries are due to be complete by the end of 2024.\n\nThe C-130 air-transport squadron at Évreux-Fauville Air Base in northern France will have unrestricted exchange of aircraft, aircrews, and maintainers, as well as technical and logistical support based on a common pool of spare parts and a common service support contract. “Ten aircraft, two nations, one association – there has never been anything like this in Europe,” the Bundeswehr has previously said.\n\nThe joint air-transport squadron is scheduled to achieve full operating capability in 2024–25."
