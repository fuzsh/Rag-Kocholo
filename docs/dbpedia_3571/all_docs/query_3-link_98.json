        "text": "The Albanese Government will purchase 20 new C-130J Hercules aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force for $9.8 billion. The new acquisitions will replace and expand upon the 12 Hercules aircraft currently operated by Air Force with delivery of the first aircraft expected from late 2027.\n\n“The Government is ensuring the Australian Defence Force is equipped with brand new C-130J Hercules aircraft, and more of them, to respond to the wide range of challenges our nation will face in the future,\" Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon Pat Conroy MP said.\n\n“Having 20 aircraft, up from 12, will mean more opportunities for local industry to sustain the aircraft, creating more Australian jobs. There’ll also be jobs associated with infrastructure redevelopments at RAAF Base Richmond.”\n\nThe Australian Defence Force relies on the C-130J Hercules aircraft for the deployment of personnel, equipment and humanitarian supplies. It is regularly used in search and rescue missions, disaster relief and medical evacuation.\n\nThe C-130J has been involved in almost every major Defence operation in recent decades, from Bougainville assistance and Timor-Leste peacekeeping through to conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n“The C-130J Hercules is an important capability for our defence force, but also for Australia as a nation. From bushfire and flood emergencies across the country, the delivery of crucial supplies to the region during the COVID-19 pandemic and more than two decades supporting peacekeeping operations, this has and will continue to be a crucial asset,\" Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, the Hon Richard Marles MP said.\n\n“The Albanese Government is committed to ensuring the ADF is equipped with the capabilities it needs to keep Australians safe, and this targeted expansion of the fleet size will do just that.”\n\nThe C-130J Hercules are made by Lockheed Martin and are being purchased from the United States. The aircraft will continue to be operated by No. 37 Squadron at RAAF Base Richmond in NSW.\n\n“Lockheed Martin Australia and New Zealand congratulates Defence on its commitment to procure a new and expanded C-130J fleet. These aircraft will add to the 65-year legacy of continuous C-130 operations by Australia,” Warren McDonald, Chief Executive of Lockheed Martin Australia and New Zealand said.\n\n“The C-130J has proven its ability to meet all of Australia’s medium air mobility requirements and is an excellent choice to support operations in Northern Australia, the importance of which was highlighted in the Defence Strategic Review.”\n\nADM Comment: The acquisition of more C-130J-30’s for the RAAF comes as no surprise – the potential sale being first reported by ADM in December 2021 and confirmed by government in November 2022.\n\nWhat is a surprise however is that the Commonwealth has elected to acquire just 20 additional Hercules, following its request to Washington for ‘up to 24’ aircraft. The contract value is also surprising, insomuch as the notification of the initial request by the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) put the estimated cost at US6.35 billion – or $9.47 billion Australian dollars at the conversion rate at that time. Today’s announcement reports a cost of $9.8 billion ($US6.9 billion) just eight months later and for four aircraft less than the original estimate.\n\nThe additional Hercules are being acquired under the RAAF’s Air 7404 Phase 1 (Medium Air Mobility Aircraft, or MAMA) program.\n\nADM also understands that two additional Airbus KC-30A Multi Mission Tanker Transport (MRTT) aircraft for the RAAF will soon be announced by government. These additional aircraft will bring the fleet up to nine aircraft."
