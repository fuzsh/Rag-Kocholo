        "text": "WinAir Presents: The Lockheed C-130 Hercules Infographic—image highlights key information on the aircraft commonly referred to as “The Herc;” one of the world’s most powerful and versatile military transport aircraft\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 Hercules Infographic was created using information obtained from Wikipedia’s “Lockheed C-130 Hercules” article. It showcases information on the C-130s vital statistics, general specifications, performance outputs, and avionics.\n\nThe C-130 Hercules is an extremely robust and multipurpose four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft, developed by Lockheed Martin. It is capable of performing a variety of military, civilian, and humanitarian functions, which is due in part to its ability to use unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings. Couple this with a wingspan of over 132 ft, and a payload that surpasses 44,000 lbs, and you have what many consider to be a “cargo hauling beast.” This aircraft achieved first flight on August 23, 1954, and has been in service since this date. It is currently operated by approximately 70 countries worldwide.\n\nIn addition to troop, medevac, and cargo transportation, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules can participate in an array of challenging missions. It can act as a gunship, perform airborne assault, assist with search an rescue (SAR), facilitate aerial delivery, lead weather reconnaissance missions, take part in aerial firefighting, perform aerial refueling, and so on. During the 2018 Farnborough Airshow in Hampshire, United Kingdom, Lockheed Martin displayed the latest civilian variant of its C-130J Super Hercules, the LM-100J. The LM-100J showed off its advanced capabilities by flying a demonstration routine that featured an incredible loop maneuver that wowed the Farnborough Airport crowd.\n\nFor ease of reference, an infographic summary is located below the image.\n\n(Click on the image to zoom into the material)\n\nWinAir Presents: The Lockheed C-130 Hercules Infographic Summary\n\nIntroducing the Lockheed C-130 Hercules:\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military aircraft designed and built by Lockheed Martin.[2]\n\nThe aircraft is extremely versatile due to its ability to use unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings.[5]\n\nTypical Aircraft Uses[5]\n\nTransportation (Troops, medevac, and cargo)\n\nGunship\n\nAirborne Assault\n\nSearch and Rescue (SAR)\n\nScientific Research\n\nWeather Reconnaissance\n\nAerial Refueling\n\nMaritime Patrol\n\nAerial Firefighting\n\nParatrooper\n\nAerial Delivery\n\nVital Statistics[20]\n\nRole: Military transport aircraft\n\nNation of Origin: United States of America\n\nManufacturer: Lockheed; Lockheed Martin\n\nFirst Flight: August 23rd, 1954\n\nCurrent Status: In Service\n\nProduction Period: 1954–present\n\nNumber Built: Over 2,500 as of 2015\n\nUnit Cost: C-130E: $11.9 Million; C-130H $30.1 Million\n\nVariants: Lockheed AC-130; Lockheed DC-130; Lockheed EC-130; Lockheed EC-130H Compass Call; Lockheed HC-130; Lockheed Martin KC-130; Lockheed LC-130; Lockheed MC-130; Lockheed RC-130; Lockheed WC-130; Lockheed L-100 Hercules; Lockheed Martin C-130J Super Hercules\n\nMilitary Operators of the C-130 Hercules Aircraft[23]\n\nCurrent Operators\n\nAfghanistan\n\nAlgeria\n\nArgentina\n\nAustralia\n\nAustria\n\nBangladesh\n\nBelgium\n\nBolivia\n\nBotswana\n\nBrazil\n\nCameroon\n\nCanada\n\nChad\n\nChile\n\nRepublic of China (Taiwan)\n\nColombia\n\nDenmark\n\nEcuador\n\nEgypt\n\nEritrea\n\nEthiopia\n\nFrance\n\nGabon\n\nGreece\n\nHonduras\n\nHungary\n\nIndia\n\nIndonesia\n\nIran\n\nIraq\n\nIsrael\n\nItaly\n\nJapan\n\nJordan\n\nKuwait\n\nLiberia\n\nLibya\n\nMalaysia\n\nMexico\n\nMorocco\n\nNetherlands\n\nNew Zealand\n\nNiger\n\nNigeria\n\nNorway\n\nOman\n\nPakistan\n\nPeru\n\nPhilippines\n\nPoland\n\nPortugal\n\nRomania\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nSingapore\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Korea\n\nSpain\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSudan\n\nSweden\n\nThailand\n\nTunisia\n\nTurkey\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited States\n\nUruguay\n\nVenezuela\n\nYemen\n\nZambia\n\nFormer Operators\n\nAngola\n\nSouth Vietnam\n\nSpecifications (C-130H)[26]\n\nCrew: five (two pilots, navigator, flight engineer and loadmaster)\n\nCapacity:\n\nC-130E/H/J cargo hold: length, 40 ft (12.19 m); width, 119 in (3.02 m); height, 9 ft (2.74 m).
