        "text": "Embraer has received a contract to deliver nine C-390 Millennium transport aircraft for a joint military acquisition program between the Dutch and Austrian governments.\n\nSigned at an aerospace convention in England, the agreement stipulates five systems for the Royal Netherlands Air Force and four for the Austrian Air Force.\n\nEmbraer wrote that the procurement supports the nations’ efforts to expand their logistics capabilities for international warfighter deployment and evacuations under austere conditions.\n\nThe planes are expected to amplify the Dutch and Austrian air forces’ operational flexibility and availability for tactical, medical, and humanitarian operations.\n\nAdditionally, the planes will enable Amsterdam and Vienna to streamline their cargo aircraft training and associated programs with other Millennium users in NATO countries, promoting “maximum operational readiness,” interoperability, and future growth of the platform.\n\n“This is a good example of collaboration in Europe between countries,” Dutch Armaments Director Vice Admiral Jan Willem Hartman said.\n\n“The constructive support of Embraer has played a crucial role in the successful realization of this agreement. We appreciate the contribution of Embraer and look forward to a successful cooperation.”\n\n‘Best Choice’\n\nThe Netherlands Ministry of Defence first revealed its intent to purchase the C-390 in 2022 to replace the Dutch armed forces’ aging Lockheed C-130H Hercules.\n\nAustria then selected the Millennium to replace its own C-130Hs the following year, making the country the fifth international customer of the Brazilian aircraft.\n\nThe Dutch government noted that the first three planes under this effort will be delivered by 2027.\n\n“We welcome the Netherlands and Austria as the newest members of the growing group of nations that have ordered the C-390 Millennium, the most efficient and modern military tactical transport currently in operation,” Embraer Defense & Security CEO and President Bosco da Costa Jr. commented on the contract announcement.\n\n“This aircraft is the best choice in the market, offering an unbeatable combination of high performance, advanced technology and low life cycle costs.”\n\nEmbraer’s C-390\n\nThe C-390 Millennium is a 35.2-meter (115.6-foot) aircraft with a wingspan of 35.05 meters (115 feet) and a maximum fuel capacity of 35,000 kilograms (77,160 pounds).\n\nIt is powered by a twin IAW V2500-E5 turbofan engine for a top speed of 533 knots (988 kilometers/614 miles per hour), a range of approximately 5,000 kilometers (3,106 miles), and an operational altitude of 11,000 meters (36,000 feet).\n\nThe plane is operated by two personnel and a loadmaster. It can carry up to 80 soldiers or 26,000 kilograms (57,000 pounds) of payload."
