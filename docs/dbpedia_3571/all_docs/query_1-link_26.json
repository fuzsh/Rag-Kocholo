        "text": "Marshall Aerospace and Defence Group (Marshall ADG) has secured a long-term contract for sustainment of the Royal Netherlands Air Force’s (RNLAF) recently upgraded C-130 Hercules transport aircraft fleet.\n\nAwarded by the Netherlands Defence Material Organisation (DMO), the contract requires the company to maintain the C-130 fleet, which underwent extensive cockpit upgrade (CUP) and cabin safety improvements (CSIMP) modifications.\n\nUnder the CUP and CSIMP Sustainment Programme (CCSP), the company will provide the DMO with airworthiness, maintenance and reliability information gathered from several original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), whose equipment was installed on the aircraft during modifications.\n\n\"The company will provide the DMO with airworthiness, maintenance and reliability information gathered from several original equipment manufacturers.\"\n\nMarshall Aerospace and Defence Group CEO Steve Fitz-Gerald said: ”This innovative long-term sustainment contract follows on from the recent successful modification, refurbishment and upgrade of the fleet where we designed, integrated, installed, tested and certified the cockpit upgrade programme (CUP) and cabin safety improvement programme (CSIMP) which make the RNLAF’s aircraft some of the most capable C-130Hs in the world.\"\n\nThe information, advice and guidance provided by Marshall ADG is expected to be incorporated into the airworthiness procedures of the Netherlands Military Airworthiness Authority.\n\nManufactured by Lockheed Martin, the C-130 Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft designed to support airborne assault, search and rescue, scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, maritime patrol and aerial firefighting missions.\n\nPowered by four Allison AE2100D3 turboprop engines, the heavy-lift aircraft features a glass cockpit, digital avionics and a new propulsion system with a four-bladed propeller, and is capable of accommodating a payload of up to 20t, or more than 90 passengers.\n\nIn addition to RNLAF, the aircraft is operated by Australia, Indonesia, Canada, Denmark, India, Italy, Norway, Qatar, and the US and UK."
