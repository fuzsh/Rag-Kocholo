        "text": "Thales and Rheinmetall have been tasked with certifying the future training centre organization for the Franco-German C-130J transport aircraft fleet. The two companies are participating in the project as subcontractors (50/50) to Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor of the France/Germany Multinational Training Centre and manufacturer of the C-130J Super Hercules transport aircraft.\n\nAwarded in March 2021, Rheinmetall and Thales will provide personnel and services related to the certification of the training centre organization. The training centre qualification is to be completed in Q1 2024, and the training operation will commence in 2024. The initial establishment and certification phase may be followed by an optional operating phase. If the operating phase is awarded, Thales and Rheinmetall will provide all management personnel, qualified flight and ground crew instructors as well as maintenance personnel for the operation of all training devices.\n\nThe training centre is to be established at Évreux in Normandy, home to the French Air Force’s 62nd Transport Squadron, and will host the new French and German C-130J Super Hercules aircraft as a joint transport squadron. The accompanying training centre is to be certified as an Approved Training Organization (ATO), certified by the French civil aviation authority (DGAC).\n\nThe Franco-German transport aircraft project is one of Europe’s key air force programmes. In Évreux, Germany and France intend to jointly operate a total of 10 C-130J Super Hercules aircraft starting this year. The plan calls for joint cockpit crews as well as mixed teams on the ground. France has already taken delivery of a total of four Super Hercules, whereas Germany will contribute six aircrafts to the squadron, with deliveries starting in 2022. These six aircrafts will replace the German Transall C-160."
