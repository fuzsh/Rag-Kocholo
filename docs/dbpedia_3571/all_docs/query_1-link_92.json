Capable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, medical evacuation, and cargo transport aircraft. The versatile airframe has found uses in a variety of other roles, including as a gunship (AC-130), for airborne assault, search and rescue, scientific research support, weather reconnaissance, aerial refueling, maritime patrol, and aerial firefighting. It is now the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide. Over forty models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60 nations.",

It is now the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide. Over forty models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 60 nations.\n\nThe C-130 entered service with U.S. in the 1950s, followed by Australia and others. During its years of service, the Hercules family has participated in numerous military, civilian and humanitarian aid operations. The family has the longest continuous production run of any military aircraft in history. In 2007, the C-130 became the fifth aircraft—after the English Electric Canberra, Boeing B-52 Stratofortress, Tupolev Tu-95, and Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, all designs with various forms of aviation gas turbine powerplants—to mark 50 years of continuous use with its original primary customer, in this case, the United States Air Force. The C-130 is one of the only military aircraft to remain in continuous production for over 50 years with its original customer, as the updated C-130J Super Hercules.\n\nUsers[edit | edit source]\n\nAfghanistan\n\nAfghan Air Force\n\nAlgeria\n\nAlgerian Air Force\n\nAngola\n\nAngolan Air Force\n\nArgentina\n\nArgentine Air Force\n\nAustralia\n\nRoyal Australian Air Force\n\nAustria\n\nAustrian Air Force\n\nBangladesh\n\nBangladesh Air Force\n\nBahrain\n\nRoyal Bahrain Air Force\n\nBelgium\n\nBelgian Air Component\n\nBolivia\n\nBolivian Air Force\n\nBotswana\n\nBotswana Air Force\n\nBrazil\n\nBrazilian Air Force\n\nCameroon\n\nCameroon Air Force\n\nCanada\n\nRoyal Canadian Air Force\n\nChad\n\nChad Air Force\n\nChile\n\nChilean Air Force\n\nRepublic of China\n\nRepublic of China Air Force\n\nColombia\n\nColombian Air Force\n\nDenmark\n\nRoyal Danish Air Force\n\nEcuador\n\nEcuadorian Air Force\n\nEgypt\n\nEgyptian Air Force\n\nEritrea\n\nEritrean Air Force\n\nEthiopia\n\nEthiopian Air Force\n\nFrance\n\nFrench Air Force\n\nGabon\n\nGabonese Air Force\n\nGreece\n\nHellenic Air Force\n\nGuatemala\n\nGuatemalan Air Force\n\nHonduras\n\nHonduran Air Force\n\nIndonesia\n\nIndonesian Air Force\n\nIran\n\nIslamic Republic of Iran Air Force\n\nIsrael\n\nIsraeli Air Force\n\nItaly\n\nRegia Aeronautica\n\nJapan\n\nJapan Air Self-Defense Force\n\nJapan Maritime Self-Defense Force\n\nJordan\n\nRoyal Jordanian Air Force\n\nRepublic of Korea\n\nRepublic of Korea Air Force\n\nKuwait\n\nKuwait Air Force\n\nLiberia\n\nLiberian Air Force\n\nLibya\n\nLibyan Air Force\n\nMalaysia\n\nRoyal Malaysian Air Force\n\nMexico\n\nMexican Air Force\n\nMorocco\n\nRoyal Moroccan Air Force\n\nNetherlands]\n\nRoyal Netherlands Air Force\n\nNew Zealand\n\nRoyal New Zealand Air Force\n\nNiger\n\nNiger Air Force\n\nNigeria\n\nNigerian Air Force\n\nNorway\n\nRoyal Norwegian Air Force\n\nOman\n\nRoyal Air Force of Oman\n\nPakistan\n\nPakistan Air Force\n\nPeru\n\nPeruvian Air Force\n\nPhilippines\n\nPhilippine Air Force\n\nPoland\n\nPolish Air Force\n\nPortugal\n\nPortuguese Air Force\n\nRomania\n\nRomanian Air Force\n\nSaudi Arabia\n\nRoyal Saudi Air Force\n\nSingapore\n\nRepublic of Singapore Air Force\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth African Air Force\n\nSpain\n\nSpanish Air Force\n\nSri Lanka\n\nSri Lankan Air Force\n\nSudan\n\nSudanese Air Force\n\nSweden\n\nRoyal Swedish Air Force\n\nThailand\n\nRoyal Thai Air Force\n\nTunisia\n\nTunisian Air Force\n\nTurkey\n\nTurkish Air Force\n\nUnited Arab Emirates\n\nUnited Arab Emirates Air Force\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nRoyal Air Force\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited States Air Force\n\nUnited States Coast Guard\n\nUnited States Marine Corps\n\nUnited States Navy\n\nUruguay\n\nUruguayan Air Force\n\nVenezuela\n\nVenezuelan Air Force\n\nVietnam\n\nVietnam People's Air Force\n\nYemen\n\nYemen Air Force\n\nZambia\n\nZambian Air Force\n\nSee Also[edit | edit source]\n\nRelated Development[edit | edit source]"
