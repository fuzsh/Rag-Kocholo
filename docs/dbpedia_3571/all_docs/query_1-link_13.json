        "text": "What Air Force’s Around the World Use the C-130 Hercules Aircraft?\n\nDesigned originally for transporting troops and equipment to war zones, the C-130 Hercules aircraft has been used for civilian and military applications around the globe. Of course, some of its most notable uses stem from its role in U.S. military might since its inception.\n\nHowever, the versatility, fuel efficiency, and advanced technology have made the “Herc” an ideal choice for foreign Air Forces on nearly every continent, including the following.\n\nNorth America\n\nCanada operates 17 C-130 aircraft, and Mexico has a total of 11 C-130s, including two C-130J models.\n\nHonduras also uses the C-130, but exact aircraft numbers remain unknown.\n\nThe United States leads the pack with nearly 100 C-130 Hercules aircraft.

Only time will tell how truly expansive the use of future generations of the C-130 will become, but continued maintenance will take the C-130 deep into this century.\n\nSources\n\nhttp://www.military.com/equipment/c-130-hercules\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lockheed_C-130_Hercules_operators\n\nhttp://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19920926-1\n\nhttp://boeing.mediaroom.com/2010-04-20-Boeing-Team-Delivers-C-130H-Aerial-Refueling-Tanker-to-Japan\n\nhttp://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2012/december/121212ae_c-130_iraq-delivery.html\n\nhttp://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1159199.ece"
