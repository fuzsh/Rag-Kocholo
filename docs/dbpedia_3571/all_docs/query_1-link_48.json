        "text": "C-130 Hercules Transport\n\nC-130 Hercules Design & Mission\n\nThe Lockheed C-130 Hercules is a four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft designed and built originally by Lockheed, now Lockheed Martin.\n\nCapable of using unprepared runways for takeoffs and landings, the C-130 was originally designed as a troop, medical evacuation, and cargo transport aircraft.\n\nC-130 Model Evolution\n\nC-130E Hercules, S/N 63-7868, Museum of Aviation, Robins Air Force Base, Georgia (Staff Photo)\n\nFour decades have elapsed since the U.S. Air Force issued its original design specification, yet the C-130 remains in production.\n\nThe initial production model was the C-130A, with four Allison turboprop engines. A total of 219 were ordered and deliveries began in December 1956.\n\nThe C-130B introduced Allison T56-A-7 turboprop engines and the first of 134 aircraft of this model entered USAF service in May 1959. Introduced in August of 1962, the 389 C-130Es that were ordered used the same Allison T56-A-7 engine, but added two 1,290 gallon external fuel tanks and an increased maximum takeoff weight capability.\n\nIn June of 1974, the first of 308 C-130Hs were delivered, with the more powerful Allison T56-A-15 turboprop engine. Nearly identical to the C-130E externally, the new engine brought major performance improvements to the aircraft.\n\nThe latest C-130 to be produced, the C-130J, entered the inventory in February 1999. With the noticeable difference of a six-bladed composite propeller coupled to a Rolls-Royce AE2100D3 turboprop engine, the C-130J brings substantial performance improvements over all previous models. The C-130J-30, a stretch version with a 15-foot fuselage extension, increases the capabilities even more.\n\nThe Hercules is similar is size and role to the Airbus A400M.\n\nMajor C-130 Variants\n\nModel\n\nPurpose\n\nC-130A/B/E/F/G/H/K/T\n\nTactical Airlifter\n\nC-130J Super Hercules\n\nTactical Airlifter\n\nAC-130 Spectre/Spooky/Stinger II/Ghostrider\n\nGunship\n\nEC-130\n\nAirborne Battlefield Command and Control Center\n\nKC-130\n\nAerial Tanker\n\nWC-130\n\nWeather reconnaissance (\"Hurricane Hunter\")\n\nC-130 Hercules Deployment\n\nAC-130 gunship, USAF Armament Museum, Eglin, AFB, Florida\n\nToday, the C-130 Hercules primarily performs the tactical portion of the airlift mission. The aircraft is capable of operating from rough, dirt strips and is the prime transport for airdropping troops and equipment into hostile areas.\n\nThe C-130 operates throughout the U.S. Air Force, serving with Air Mobility Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, Air Combat Command, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, Pacific Air Forces, Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve Command, fulfilling a wide range of operational missions in both peace and war situations.\n\nThe C-130 is also a key aircraft in the air forces of many allied countries, including France, Egypt, Pakistan, Spain, Kuwait, the UAE and more.
