        "text": "Many victims\n\nThere is considerable pressure on Turkish and international relief agencies because of the many fatalities and casualties caused by the major earthquakes that struck last Monday. The toll currently stands at 20,000 dead and many more injured.\n\nCML will provide 2 regular aeromedical evacuation teams. Each team consists of 1 doctor and 3 nurses and has medical supplies to care for casualties. The deployment will also include a medical officer tasked with coordinating and directing the flights.\n\nRelief flights\n\nThe Lockheed C-130H Hercules is a medium transport aircraft. It is primarily intended for the transport of military personnel and materiel. The aircraft is also used to conduct humanitarian relief flights. A loading ramp at the rear of the fuselage means that the aircraft does not depend on special loading facilities at airports. The Hercules can use very primitive airfields with short runways."
