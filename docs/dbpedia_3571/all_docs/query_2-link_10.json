        "text": "Royal Netherlands Air Force C-130 Hercules training exercise\n\nStarting on 23 November 2020, the Koninklijke Luchtmacht (KLu, Royal Netherlands Air Force) 336 Squadron will see an increase in their flying activities.\n\nThe squadron, based at Eindhoven air base and equipped with four Lockheed C-130H/C-130H-30 Hercules transport aircraft, intensifies their training activities with the Dutch 11th Air Mobile Brigade, Dutch Marines and the Netherlands Army Commando unit.\n\nFor a period of two weeks, 23 November 2020 untill 10 December 2020, 336sq will train on tactical flying, low altitude operatons, paradroppings, and cargo airdroppings.\n\nInitially, the KLu bought two stretched Lockheed C-130H-30 Hercules transporters in 1992. In 2005, two former United States Navy EC-130Qs were bought and after a major overhaul with Marshal Aerospace and Defence Group (MADG) at Cambridge/Teversham (UK) the transporters were delivered as C-130H variant in 2008.\n\nAs mentioned in our news item of 21 September 2020, all Hercules aircraft will be replaced earlier than originally planned. It is reported that the KLu will purchase five new Super Hercules transporters.\n\nPhotos: Niels Quist and Johan Havelaar (both Scramble Magazine Archive) and Hans van Herk"
