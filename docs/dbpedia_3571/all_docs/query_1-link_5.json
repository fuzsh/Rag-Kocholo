        "text": "Activated in September 1961, 336 Squadron, Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), was equipped with six Douglas Dakota transport aircraft. Active during the Netherlands’ conflict with Indonesia over Dutch New Guinea, it was deactivated in October 1962. On August 1, 1981 the unit was re-activated at Hato air base on the Dutch Caribbean island of Curaçao, operating two Fokker F27 Maritime aircraft.\n\nResponsible for search and rescue missions, surveillance against smugglers, oil pollution control and transporting Dutch Marine Corps soldiers permanently based on the island, the squadron provided useful service until political decisions saw it disbanded in 1999 and the Fokkers sold. Meanwhile, 334 Squadron had become a Lockheed C-130 Hercules operator, after receiving a pair of C-130H-30 aircraft in 1994. In 2005, the Dutch government decided to double Hercules capacity and 336 Squadron was reactivated as the C-130 unit at its present station, Eindhoven, in the south of Holland, on October 23, 2007."
