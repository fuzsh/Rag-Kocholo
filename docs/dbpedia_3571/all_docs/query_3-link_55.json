        "text": "WASHINGTON, September 25, 2012– The Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress September 21 of a possible Foreign Military Sale to the Government of Mexico for two C-130J-30 aircraft and associated equipment, parts, training and logistical support for an estimated cost of $412 million.\n\nThe Government of Mexico has requested a sale of 2 C-130J-30 aircraft, 10 AE2100D3 engines (8 installed and 2 spares), aircraft modifications, Government Furnished Equipment, communication equipment, spare and repair parts, support and test equipment, publications and technical documentation, personnel training and training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor engineering, technical and logistics support services, and other related elements of logistical and program support. The estimated cost is $412 million.\n\nThis proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national security of the United States by providing presidential support and potentially supporting missions in Mexico’s fight against criminal organizations, drugs, and gang activities. This proposed sale directly supports the Mexican government and serves the interests of the Mexican people and the United States.\n\nThe proposed sale of C-130Js to Mexico will primarily be used for presidential support, but may also be used to support drug interdiction and other security missions by providing airlift support for its forces. Mexico, which already operates a mix of legacy C-130s, will have no difficulty absorbing these additional aircraft into its inventory. Mexico has also requested that the sale include three years of training and sustainment support.\n\nThe proposed sale of these aircraft and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.\n\nThe prime contractor will be Lockheed Martin-Aerospace in Marietta, Georgia. There are no known offset agreements in connection with this potential sale.\n\nImplementation of this proposed sale will require the assignment of four contractor representatives and four Field Service Representatives (two from Lockheed Martin and two from Rolls Royce) for a period of three years. Also, U.S. government personnel will be assigned to for a period of three years to assist the purchaser in establishing a supply system in support of flight operations, supply management, inventory control, and documentation procedures.\n\nThere will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness as a result of this proposed sale.\n\nThis notice of a potential sale is required by law and does not mean the sale has been concluded."
