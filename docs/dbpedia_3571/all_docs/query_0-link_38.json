        "text": "Marshall is recognised as a global authority on maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) for the Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules, having built unrivalled experience on the platform since 1966.\n\nAround the world, 18 government fleet operators rely on our capabilities to remain mission-ready and mission-capable - regardless of whether they are operating a 60-year-old C-130B or the latest C-130J Super Hercules. In 2023 alone, Marshall completed over 23,000 MRO tasks across 450,000 hours of aircraft work.\n\n\"The unique capabilities, services and response time that Marshall provides for deployed aviation squadrons, in addition to their contractual planned maintenance interval work, are an immense added value and directly contribute to the sustainment of the United States’ fleet of C-130 aircraft.”\n\nLt Col Kevin M. Ryan\n\n(fmr) Commanding Officer, Fleet Readiness Center Western Pacific, US Navy\n\nWe continue to set the industry standard for accurate scheduling and management of maintenance inputs, delivering high-quality, low-risk C-130 depth maintenance with dependable turnaround times. Our exceptionally skilled team of qualified fitters and technicians is supported by our unique authorisation to produce parts in-house, as well as our resilient supply chain and component repair and overhaul network.\n\nOur dedicated Repairs Group supports aircraft during maintenance at our facilities and at forward locations when required, calling on Marshall’s decades of platform experience to resolve any on-aircraft issues as quickly and effectively as possible.\n\n“Marshall is known for its unwavering commitment to the global Hercules community, providing proven support to the world’s workhorse.”\n\nGeorge Shultz\n\n(fmr) Vice President & General Manager, Air Mobility & Maritime Missions, Lockheed Martin\n\nDrawing from their familiarity of Lockheed Martin’s C-130 drawings and documentation, the team rapidly determines whether an issue can be resolved through a standard repair approach, or whether a non-standard repair is necessary.\n\nIn the latter case, Marshall is able to design and substantiate non-standard repairs C-130B through H aircraft without the need to reach back to Lockheed Martin as OEM; to date, we have completed over 10,000 repairs of this type.\n\nWe are extremely proud to be the only MRO in the world approved by Lockheed Martin to manufacture C-130J parts in-house, enabling us to significantly de-risk emerging findings during maintenance inputs and provide unmatched support for difficult-to-obtain and long-lead-time items.\n\n\"Throughout the years, we have transformed the relationship into one of cooperating and partnering. The Royal Netherlands Air Force provides the operational input, while Marshall delivers the engineering solutions – a proven and rock solid combination.\n\n“If technical problems arise, Marshall is immediately around to support the Royal Netherlands Air Force. This focus on the customer’s true needs really distinguishes Marshall in the aerospace industry.”\n\nMajor General Sotthewes\n\nDeputy Commander, Royal Netherlands Air Force\n\nCase study – delivering for the United States Marine Corps\n\nIn 2020, Marshall was awarded a ten-year contract to provide maintenance for the fleet of KC-130J aircraft operated by the United States Marine Corps (USMC) outside the continental United States.\n\nThe contract was one of the biggest in the company’s history and rapidly opened the door for scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) work on one of the world’s largest C-130 fleets.\n\nSince then, Marshall has steadily grown and sustained its strong relationship with the USMC by providing an unmatched level of quality, efficiency and reliability.\n\nRead our case study\n\nFlight test and ground running enclosure\n\nMarshall is approved to conduct extensive ground testing and all categories of military and civil flight test, from experimental and developmental testing through to production and operational trials.\n\nQualification and Experience\n\nOur CAA/EASA/MAA Cat 1 test pilots and lead flight test engineers have extensive experience of military and civil fixed wing aircraft operations and testing. The team’s range of front line experience includes fast jet, tactical and strategic air transport, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and maritime operations.\n\nMarshall is a member of numerous accredited professional bodies including the Royal Aeronautical Society, the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and the Society of Flight Test Engineers.\n\nOEM-certified parts manufacture\n\nThanks to our unique OEM-authorised in-house manufacturing and special processes capability, Marshall can support customers by manufacturing parts quickly, easily and independently.\n\nWe can also undertake urgent aircraft repair parts manufacture and support the rapid prototyping of new products, overseeing the full process from planning and purchasing through to manufacture, special processes, inspection and release.\n\nSpecial processes work is an essential part of our capability offering: our manufacturing support facility is NADCAP-accredited and holds prime contractor approvals from Boeing and Lockheed Martin for welding, testing, chemical processing and heat treatment of materials."
