        "text": "Lockheed designed the C-130 Hercules in the late 1950s as the first purpose-built troop carrier, and the aircraft has been a workhorse for the US Air Force ever since. Historically, C-130s have displayed their rugged versatility and have been modified for a variety of roles, ranging from troop transport to weather reconnaissance to Cold War satellite retrieval. The C-130 is one of the most widely used, adaptable, all-purpose cargo aircraft that the United States and other nations around the world still employ.\n\nA Herculean Task\n\nSince the C-130 entered service, Hill Air Force Base has played a key role in keeping the Hercules in tiptop flying shape. On 15 October 1958, the men and women of Hill Air Force Base took on maintenance and support responsibilities for C-130 landing gear components. The Ogden Air Logistics Complex on base continues to support this airframe through maintenance, overhaul, and repair.\n\nReconnaissance Retrieval Aircraft\n\nThis C-130 has a storied history, beginning as the second B model manufactured by Lockheed. Starting in 1960, this C-130 served at Edwards Air Force Base, California, where it supported jet-assisted take-off (JATO) testing. Then, in May 1973, it served at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii. While there, this aircraft performed aerial retrieval of classified reconnaissance satellites as they floated back to Earth via parachute. After its time at Hickam, the Air Force assigned this airframe to Hill in 1987. At Hill, the aircraft served as an electronic test platform and as a cargo transport. In January of 1994, the aircraft made its final move to the Hill Aerospace Museum.\n\nThis aircraft is on loan from the U.S. Air Force Heritage Program."
