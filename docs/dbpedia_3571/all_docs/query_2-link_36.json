As in many other countries and air forces, the Lockheed C-130 Hercules has also been the workhorse within the Belgian Air Force for many years. This military transport aircraft has proven its value several times during numerous military missions and humanitarian deployments and was an essential part of military logistics and tactical transport within the Belgian armed forces",

        "text": "Global Aviator\n\nTaking Flight On Another World\n\nThe Mars Helicopter, Ingenuity, is a technology demonstration model to test powered, controlled flight on another world for the first time. It hitched a ride to Mars on the Perseverance rover. Once the rover reached a suitable \"airfield\" location, it released Ingenuity to the surface so it could perform a series of test flights over a 30-Martian-day experimental window.\n\nGlobal Aviator\n\nThales Completes Successful First Flight Of New UAS With Range Capabilities Of Over 100 Km\n\n• With a hybrid propulsion system for optimum safety, endurance and discretion, Thales's UAS 100 long-range unmanned air system for civil, government and military users will be able to operate at ranges of more than 100 km. • UAS 100 combines world-class flight safety performance with the compact design required for unmanned air systems, and complies with future European regulations for drone flights over populated areas. • The system will meet the requirements of a broad range of missions, including infrastructure inspection, coastal surveillance, border surveillance, event security, search-and-rescue and military operations.\n\nGlobal Aviator\n\nDutch Squadron Finalises F-16 Operations\n\nThe Royal Netherlands Air Force 322 squadron based at Leeuwarden air force base terminated its operations on the F-16 “Fighting Falcon” early July (2021). With the gradual ongoing new deliveries of its successor, the Lockheed Boeing F-35A “Lightning II”, it was time for the squadron to focus only on the embedding of the new jet in the unit.\n\nGlobal Aviator\n\nDouble Ended Project: Where Is It Now\n\nTraditionally, bush and STOL aircraft have been little more than modified certified trainers, with engine and prop upgrades, or the addition of fatter tyres. However there have been attempts to improve the safety aspect of this type of flying.\n\nGlobal Aviator\n\nAirbus showcases the A350-1000 for the first time in Russia at the MAKS 2021 International Aerospace Show\n\nAirbus demonstrated its latest technological innovations and projects implemented in Russia at the International Aerospace Show which took place in Zhukovsky from 20 to 25 July."
