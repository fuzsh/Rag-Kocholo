        "text": "The Lockheed C-130 Hercules is the most numerous transport aircraft in the West and has been in production longer than any other aircraft in history. The prototype flew in August 1954 and since then over 60 nations have ordered the Hercules. Those in use by the RAF are C-130K versions (known as Hercules C1 and C3) and initial deliveries (of a total of 66 ordered) were made during the mid-1960s and many are destined to remain in service for some years to come, although about half of the fleet have been replaced by the updated C-130J (Hercules C4 and C5). Crew of five or six and up to 92 or 128 troops, 64 paratroops, or 74 stretchers; a maximum payload of up to 43, 399lb (19, 685kg). The fleet is based at RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire and operated by crews from Nos 47 and 70 Squadrons - Nos 24 and 30 having changed to the C4 and C5 versions. One aircraft is also based at Mount Pleasant Airfield in the Falklands Islands with 1312 Flight. The Hercules is used primarily to carry troops, passengers and freight. The C1 is capable of carrying 92 passengers whilst the C3 (15ft/4.58m longer than the original C1) can carry 128 passengers or 30% more cargo. The maximum payload is 20 tonnes or 45, 000lbs which can be carried over 2, 000 miles. Following the Falklands War, all RAF Hercules were fitted with an air-to-air refuelling probe which can extend their range to over 5, 000 miles. The freight bay can accommodate a range of wheeled or tracked vehicles or 5 - 7 pallets of general freight. In the Aeromedical Evacuation role either 64 or 82 NATO standard stretchers can be carried. A small number were also fitted out as air-to-air refuelling aircraft, but are no longer used by the RAF. The aircraft can operate from unprepared & semi-prepared surfaces by day or night if required."
