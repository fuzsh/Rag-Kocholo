The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) purchased 16 in total to replace aging C-1 and YS-11P aircraft. The C-130Hs were received from 1984 to 1998.\n\nJASDF C-130Hs were active in Iraq from 2004 to 2008. Two C-130Hs (95-1080 and 95–1083) have been equipped with aerial fuel-receiving and refueling functions, making them of KC-130H standard.[7][8] This provides the JASDF with the ability to refuel the UH-60J search and rescue helicopters of its Air Rescue Wing.\n\nJapan Maritime Self-Defense Force[1]\n\nAir Transport Squadron 61 – JMSDF Atsugi Base\n\nThe JMSDF bought six used KC-130R aircraft that were in storage, having been previously operated by the US Marines. There was some speculation that they may be used as gunships with the Harvest HAWK kit.[9] In actuality they were purchased to replace three aging YS-11M/M-A aircraft of Air Transport Squadron 61.\n\nTheir air to air refueling equipment was removed, making them of C-130R standard. Corrosion repair was done and the aircraft were refitted with new landing gear supports, cargo door supports and center wing rainbow fittings. In addition to structural modifications, Japan received thirty overhauled Allison T56-A-16 engines and digital cockpit upgrades to include a digital GPS. Regeneration of the first aircraft began in November 2012 and was planned to be completed by Fall 2013.[10] The six C-130Rs were supplied from 2014 to 2016.[11]\n\nJordan - Venezuela\n\n[edit]\n\nJordan - Royal Jordanian Air Force[1]\n\nKuwait - Kuwait Air Force[1]\n\nLibya - Libyan Air Force.[1] Previously operated by the Libyan Air Force under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's rule until 2011.

All 158 people on board were killed, including eight foreign nationals.[16]\n\nNorway - Royal Norwegian Air Force[1]\n\nOman - Royal Air Force of Oman[1]\n\nPakistan - Pakistan Air Force[1]\n\nPeru - Peruvian Air Force[1]\n\nPhilippines - Philippine Air Force[1]\n\nPoland - Polish Air Force[1]\n\nPortugal - Portuguese Air Force[1]\n\nQatar - Qatar Emiri Air Force[1]\n\nRomania - Romanian Air Force[1]\n\nSaudi Arabia - Royal Saudi Air Force[1]\n\nSingapore - Republic of Singapore Air Force[1]\n\nSouth Africa - South African Air Force[1]\n\nSouth Korea - Republic of Korea Air Force[1]\n\nSri Lanka - Sri Lanka Air Force[1]\n\nSudan - Sudanese Air Force[1]\n\nSweden - Swedish Air Force[1]\n\nTaiwan - Republic of China Air Force[1]\n\nThailand - Royal Thai Air Force[1]\n\nTunisia - Tunisian Air Force[1]\n\nTurkey - Turkish Air Force[1]\n\nUnited Arab Emirates - United Arab Emirates Air Force[1]\n\nUnited States\n\nInternational Air Response[17]\n\nUnited States Coast Guard[1]\n\nUnited States Air Force[1]\n\nUnited States Marine Corps[1]\n\nUnited States Navy[1]\n\nCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection\n\nUruguay - Uruguayan Air Force[1]\n\nVenezuela *Venezuelan Air Force[1]\n\nFormer operators\n\n[edit]\n\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan - Afghan Air Force[18]\n\nBelgium - Belgian Air Component[19]\n\nBrazil - Brazilian Air Force[20]\n\nHonduras - Honduras Air Force[21]\n\nSouth Vietnam - South Vietnam Air Force[21]\n\nSpain - Spanish Air Force[22]\n\nUnited Kingdom - Royal Air Force - 15 C-130J.
