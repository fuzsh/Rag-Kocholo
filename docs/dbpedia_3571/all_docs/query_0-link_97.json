It is the main tactical airlifter for many military forces worldwide.\n\nOver 40 models and variants of the Hercules serve with more than 50 nations. In December 2006 the C-130 became the fifth aircraft — after the English Electric Canberra, B-52 Stratofortress, Tupolev Tu-95, and KC-135 Stratotanker — to mark 50 years of continuous use with its original primary customer, in this case, the United States Air Force. The C-130 is also the only military aircraft to remain in continuous production for 50 years with its original customer, as the updated C-130J Super Hercules.\n\nAircraft help\n\nKey Function ⇧ Shift+D Open/close back door d Open/close crew door ⇧ Shift+S Start engine smoke u Stop engine smoke Ctrl+j Release parachutist\n\nAir to Air Refueling\n\nThe C-130 is capable of receiving fuel by air-to-air refueling (AAR). You can do AAR by lining up behind the tanker and coming in contact with it as you would with any other AAR aircraft.\n\nLiveries\n\nRoyal Air Force Livery from the No. 47 Squadron.
