        "text": "But the centre for the arts said they can't add anything else to what the comedian has already said in her apology.\n\nRemarks made on the BBC Radio 4 programme Heresy on Tuesday night led to public criticism, including from Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, and broadcasting watchdog Ofcom receiving 65 complaints.\n\nA spokesperson for the Courtyard said: \"Jo Brand has been an honorary patron and supporter of The Courtyard for many years. In her own words she has recognised that her comments were 'crass and ill-judged'.\n\n\"Jo has made it clear that she would not condone any act of violence and has apologised to anyone who may have taken offence to her comment.\n\n\"Therefore, there is nothing further that we can add at this time.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the Metropolitan Police said they were assessing Brand's comment following an allegation of incitement to violence.\n\nAppearing at an event in Henley, Oxfordshire, on the same day, the comedian apologised for making a \"crass and ill-judged\" joke. But she reportedly told the audience she did not think that she had made a \"mistake\", adding that she had not mentioned Mr Farage.\n\nUPDATE, FRIDAY 9.20pm: Police will take no further action against Jo Brand after she joked about throwing battery acid at politicians, Scotland Yard has said.\n\nThe comedian was reported over an allegation of incitement to violence after comments made on Radio 4 programme Heresy on Tuesday, with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage among her critics."
