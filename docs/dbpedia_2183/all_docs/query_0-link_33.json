        "text": "Mondo Generator (USA)\n\nMondo Generator, formed in 1997 by Nick Oliveri of Queens of the Stone Age, unleashed their brand of criminal insanity with the classic “Cocaine Rodeo” in 2000. Transitioning from a solo project to a full band, they’ve traversed Stoner/Psych sounds to Heavy Psychedelic Progressive, earning acclaim with albums like “A Drug Problem That Never Existed” and “Shooter’s Bible”. After a hiatus during Oliveri’s Kyuss reunion, they returned in 2012 with “Hell Comes To Your Heart” and are now back with a new lineup, album “Fuck It” and a reissue spree through Heavy Psych Sounds. Amidst the stoner rock landscape, Mondo Generator’s thunderous return promises a renewed assault on the senses.\n\nGet to know them:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nBandcamp\n\nAcid Row (CZ)\n\nHailing from Prague, Acid Row blends stoner rock, punk, doom metal, psychedelic rock, noise rock, and grunge into a unique sonic brew since 2012. Their music, reminiscent of a modern-day collaboration between Robert Johnson and electric guitar enthusiasts, embodies a devilish spirit that echoes the legacies of rock and heavy metal.\n\nGet to know them:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nBandcamp\n\nOmega Sun (SLO)\n\nSlovenian heavy fuzz rockers Omega Sun emerged in 2013 as an instrumental duo, quickly evolving into a formidable four-piece band with vocals. Since then, they’ve rocked numerous stages, sharing billing with acclaimed acts like Dopethrone, Unida, and Kylesa, while releasing their debut full-length ‘Opium For The Masses’ in 2017 and their second album ‘Roadkill’ in 2022."
