For detailed information, please see Part 2 of TDG Regulations. If the dangerous good is an explosive or radioactive material, it must be classified as required by other regulatory authorities.\n\nNote: The information below is provided as guidance only. Always check the TDG Act and Regulations to ensure compliance.\n\nPlease also see the following documents in this series for road transportation of dangerous goods:\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) – Overview (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - Training (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - 9 Classes\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - \"Special Case” and “Special Provision” Exemptions (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - Dangerous Goods Marks (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - Means of Containment (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - Segregation of Means of Containment (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - Shipping Documents (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - Emergency Response (Road)\n\nTransportation of Dangerous Goods (TDG) - Reporting Requirements (Road)\n\nWho is responsible for classifying a dangerous good?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe consignor is responsible for determining the classification of dangerous goods. However, if the dangerous goods are explosive, the consignor must use the classification determined by Natural Resources Canada. If the dangerous goods are radioactive, the consignor must use the classification determined by the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission. If the dangerous goods are biohazardous substances (Class 6.2), the consignor may use the classification determined by Health Canada or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.\n\nWho can classify my dangerous good?\n\nBack to top\n\nClassification can be done by a consultant or a competent employee who has been trained in TDG classification. Classification is normally done by (or in consultation with):\n\na person capable of understanding the nature of the dangerous good (e.g., manufacturer's professional employees such as a chemical engineer, chemist, scientist, etc.);\n\na person who formulates, blends or otherwise prepares mixtures or solutions of goods (e.g., chemist); or\n\nin the case of infectious substances, a doctor, scientist, veterinarian, epidemiologist, genetic engineer, pathologist, nurse, coroner, or laboratory technologist or technician.\n\nHow does the consignor determine the classification of a dangerous good?\n\nBack to top\n\nIf you are the manufacturer of the product, the product must be tested according to Part 2 of TDG Regulations. If the product has already been classified, the consignor may use the TDG classification of the manufacturer or a previous consignor. Although a consignor may also use the classification of the manufacturer or a previous consignor, the consignor is still responsible for making sure the classification is correct, and for making a proof of classification available to the Minister.\n\nWhat is proof of classification?\n\nBack to top\n\nA proof of classification is a document that the consignor must provide, upon request, to the federal Minister of Transport. This document may be:\n\na test report,\n\na lab report, or\n\na document that explains how the dangerous goods were classified.\n\nThe proof of classification must include the following information:\n\nthe date on which the dangerous goods were classified,\n\nif applicable, the technical name of the dangerous goods,\n\nthe classification of the dangerous goods, and\n\nif applicable, the classification method used under Part 2 of the TDG Regulations or under Chapter 2 of the UN Recommendations.\n\nWhere can I get my product analyzed for classification?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe TDG Directorate keeps a list of laboratories that provide dangerous goods analysis and classification. Note that the TDG Directorate has not examined or certified any of the laboratories. Being on this list does not mean Transport Canada or the TDG Directorate endorses or approves their services. However, it would be prudent to hire a laboratory with appropriate accreditations.\n\nWhat information is needed for classification?\n\nBack to top\n\nBased on the definition for classification, a competent person must determine the following before a classification can be assigned to a dangerous good:\n\nShipping name\n\nHazard class (the primary class and possible subsidiary class/es)\n\nIdentification number (the UN number)\n\nPacking group, compatibility group, or the infectious substance category for biohazardous substances\n\nand, if applicable,\n\nthe compatibility group letter;\n\nthe subsidiary class(es)\n\nWhere or how do I find the above information?\n\nBack to top\n\nUse all three schedules as listed in the TDG Regulations.\n\n1. Determine the shipping name: Check if the product name or chemical technical name is listed in Schedule 1 or Schedule 3. If the product's name is listed only in Schedule 3, use the UN number from Column 3 in this schedule to look up the product in Schedule 1. Use the descriptive text written in lowercase letters following a shipping name (see the examples for UN2789 and UN2790 below) to determine the shipping name that most precisely describes the dangerous goods. See the extracted data from Schedule 3 below for “Gasoline” and “Acetic acid solutions.”\n\n2. Determine the other classification elements (i.e., class, packing group, etc.)\n\nIf the product's name is listed in Schedule 1 or you located it by using the listed UN Number in Schedule 3, use the shipping name and its corresponding data (UN number, class, packing group/category) from that row. The data below is an example showing UN1203, GASOLINE. See the extracted data below from Schedule 1 for gasoline, and the acetic acid solutions.\n\nFor example, based on the above information from Schedule 1, we have the following data for the classification elements for UN1203:\n\nSHIPPING NAME (in Column 2 of Schedule 1): GASOLINE; MOTOR SPIRIT; or PETROL (when selecting the shipping name, you can use one of the three listed names, such as “gasoline”)\n\nThe Class (in Column 3 of Schedule 1): 3\n\nIdentification Number (in Column 1 of Schedule 1): UN1203\n\nPacking Group (in Column 4 of Schedule 1): II\n\nColumn 3 in Schedules 1 and column 2 in Schedule 3 will also indicate if a dangerous good is forbidden by all routes of transportation. Schedule 1 also includes information if transportation of a dangerous good is forbidden by a specific route of transportation (e.g., marine vessel/water). Examples of such products are:\n\nUN1096 SIGNALS, SMOKE which is not allowed to be transported on a ship\n\nCHLORINE DIOXIDE hydrate, frozen or not hydrated are examples of products that are forbidden by all routes of transportation as indicated in Schedule 3 with an entry of Forbidden in Column 2 - Primary Class. Note that these types of products do not have a UN Number.\n\nUN0196 SIGNALS, SMOKE which is not allowed to be transported on a Passenger Carrying Road Vehicle or Passenger Carrying Railway Vehicle.\n\n3. If the product is not listed by a specific name in Schedule 1 or 3, check if it meets any of the criteria for the hazard classes in Part 2 - Classification. Laboratory tests are required for pure substances, solutions, and mixtures. When test results and the hazard class criteria are compared, there are three possible conclusions:\n\na) The laboratory test results show the product does not meet any of the criteria for the hazard classes. In this case, the product is not TDG regulated and the product does not need to comply with the TDG Regulations.\n\nb) The laboratory test results show the product falls into one class and one packing group. See Section 2.4. Consult Schedule 3 for a shipping name that most precisely describes the dangerous goods as follows:\n\nFirst check if the substance’s formal chemical name or synonyms, or article’s specific name, are listed in Schedule 3. If present, use the corresponding UN number in Schedule 1 to determine the shipping name and its corresponding data (UN number, class, packing group/category) in Schedule 1 to assign the classification to the dangerous good. Note that the data for the classification elements in Schedule 1 for the selected shipping name and that from the laboratory must match, and the shipping name’s descriptive text accurately describes the dangerous good. For example: UN1090, Acetone Class 3 Packing Group II and UN2789, ACETIC ACID SOLUTION, more than 80% acid, by mass Class 8(3) Packing Group II.\n\nIf there are several UN numbers associated with the shipping name, select the UN Number that the laboratory data matches the classification criteria for the classification elements and the shipping name’s descriptive text. See above for the two UN numbers that are listed for Acetic acid solutions.\n\nIf more than one packing group appears for a shipping name (e.g., UN1987 ALCOHOLS, N.O.S.), select the packing group that matches the laboratory data most closely with the classification criteria for the class or division.\n\nIf the substance’s or article’s specific names or synonym names are NOT listed on Schedule 3, then select the shipping names based on the hierarchical order listed below that match the dangerous good’s laboratory data with the classification criteria for the shipping name’s classification elements and descriptive text.\n\nI. Check for generic entry names for well defined group of substances by usage (e.g., adhesives, perfumeries, pesticides, peroxides) that matches the laboratory data. For example, UN1133, ADHESIVES Class 3 Packing Group I\n\nII. If there are no generic entry names for defined group of substances by usage, check for particular chemical family name or technical nature (e.g., nitrates, hypochlorites, alcohols, etc.) that matches the laboratory data. For example, UN1987, ALCOHOLS N.O.S. Class 3 Packing group II.\n\nIII. In absence of generic names for defined groups of substances or chemical family names technical nature, select a name that represents the hazard of the class (e.g., (e.g., self-reactive, oxidizing, toxic, etc.) or division and that matches the laboratory data. For example: UN1993, FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S. Class 3 Packing Group III.\n\nc) The laboratory test results show the product falls into more than one class or packing group. See Section 2.5. Determine the primary class, subsidiary class(es) and packing group by using section 2.8 - Precedence of Classes in Part 2, Classification. Consult Schedule 3 for the shipping name that most precisely describes the dangerous goods. Use the shipping name and its corresponding data (UN number, class, packing group/category) in Schedule 1 to assign the classification to the dangerous good. For example: UN3086, TOXIC SOLID, OXIDIZING, N.O.S. Class 6.1 (5.1) Packing Group I.\n\nNote: when there are several options for a shipping name, the shipping name should be assigned in a hierarchical order (described further below).\n\nHow do I determine the shipping name when there are several possible shipping names?\n\nBack to top\n\nShipping name is the name of the dangerous good as it appears in column 2 of Schedule 1. There may be occasions when several different shipping names can be used. Generally, the shipping name should be selected in the following hierarchical order:\n\nSpecific chemical name (e.g., acetone, sulfuric acid, etc.)\n\nSubstance or product usage (e.g., pesticide, adhesive, fuel, etc.)\n\nChemical family name (e.g., alcohol, ketone, etc.)\n\nProduct usage (e.g., pesticide, adhesive, fuel, etc.)\n\nGeneric hazard/risk followed by N.O.S. (e.g., flammable, toxic, etc.)\n\nWhen the shipping name is not a specific name such as a family name, then these shipping names are followed by N.O.S. N.O.S. means Not Otherwise Specified. It is used for dangerous goods that do not have a specific entry by name in Schedule 1. For example:\n\nNorbornene or Bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (formal chemical name) is not specifically listed in Schedule 3. So, the next step is to check if there is a shipping name based on usage. This substance is not part of a well-defined group of substances for a particular usage or family group in the TDG Regulations. Thus, a shipping name is selected based on the generic hazard. This product could be shipped as UN1325, Flammable solid, organic, N.O.S.\n\nHow are product mixtures or solutions, and wastes classified?\n\nBack to top\n\nSolutions or Mixtures: When a solution or a mixture consists of one dangerous good mixed with non-dangerous goods (e.g., water) and the properties for the solution are the same as for the pure substance, the shipping name of the pure substance is followed by the word “solution” or “mixture” as applicable. The concentration of the solution or mixture may be included. Example: ETHANOL SOLUTION with more than 24% ethanol, by volume (UN1170).\n\nProduct mixture or solution that consists of multiple dangerous goods: If there is no specific name for the mixture or solution in Schedule 1, then the shipping name is determined according to the hierarchical order below that most precisely describes the mixture or solution. In addition, the technical name of the most dangerous substance needs to be provided in brackets as required in Special Provision 16 in Schedule 2. Special provisions are specified in Column 5 of Schedule 1.\n\nChemical family name followed by N.O.S. (e.g., alcohol, ketone, etc.)\n\nGeneric hazard/risk followed by N.O.S. (e.g., flammable, toxic, etc.)\n\nFor example:\n\nBoth gasoline and diesel are listed by their name in Schedule 1. However, if these two substances were mixed, the resulting mixture or solution of these two products would still be regulated as a dangerous good. The mixture could no longer be described as \"Gasoline\" or \"Diesel\" since it would no longer have a specific name in Schedule 1 or 3. A mixture that consists of 80% gasoline and 20% diesel will be assigned to the following shipping name: FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S. (gasoline), which is based on a Class 3 flammability hazard/risk.\n\nDefinition for a mixture – a product that contains two or more ingredients.\n\nDefinition for a solution – When the ingredients in a mixture are completely dissolved. For example: the mixture is liquid and homogeneous and the ingredients will not separate (e.g., no visible solids or two different phases such as you would observe when oil and water are mixed).\n\nWastes: If the product is a waste, then the shipping name is either preceded or followed by the word “waste” if the text “waste” is not already part of the shipping name. Examples: COTTON WASTE, OILY (UN1364), or REGULATED MEDICAL WASTE, N.O.S. (UN3291)\n\nMust I use the exact shipping name as it appears in Schedule 1 or Schedule 3?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe following variations of the listed shipping name are allowed:\n\nIt can be written in the singular or the plural.\n\nIt can be written with or without punctuation marks.\n\nIt can include any descriptive text associated with the shipping name in column 2 of Schedule 1.\n\nIf the person writes the shipping name with the descriptive text associated with that shipping name and the descriptive text includes a concentration range, the person may write, instead of the concentration range, the actual concentration of the dangerous goods.\n\nIt can be spelled in the same manner as it is spelled in 49 CFR, the UN Recommendations, the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code.\n\nIt can be written in upper- or lower-case letters.\n\nIt can be written in a different word order if the word order does not change the meaning of the shipping name.\n\nIt can include the qualifying words “stabilized” and “temperature controlled” provided:\n\nThese words are not already part of the shipping name,\n\nThe dangerous goods are not “self-reactive” or “organic peroxides”, and\n\nFor safety reasons, the dangerous goods must be stabilized, or temperature controlled when transported.\n\nHow do I determine the class?\n\nBack to top\n\nIf the product's name (e.g., chemical name) is listed in Schedule 1 or 3, the primary hazard class is listed in Column 3 of Schedule 1 as well as in Column 2 of Schedule 3 for that shipping name.\n\nHowever, if the product's name is not listed in Schedule 1 or 3, then the product must be tested at a laboratory. Once the material has been tested at a laboratory, the test results are compared to the classification criteria in Part 2. Your product may meet the criteria for one or more of the following nine TDG hazard classes:\n\nClass 1 Explosives\n\nClass 2 Gases\n\nClass 3 Flammable Liquids\n\nClass 4 Substances/Products include: Flammable Solids; Substances Liable to Spontaneous Combustion; Substances That on Contact with Water Emit Flammable Gases (Water-reactive Substances)\n\nClass 5 Oxidizing Substances, including Organic Peroxides\n\nClass 6 Toxic and Infectious Substances\n\nClass 7 Radioactive Materials\n\nClass 8 Corrosive Substances\n\nClass 9 Miscellaneous Products, Substances or Organisms\n\nIf your product meets the criteria for several hazard classes, the primary class must be determined. The primary class of dangerous goods is the hazard class that poses the highest hazard and takes precedence over any other class that poses a lower hazard. It is determined according to the specification in section 2.8 and the “Precedence of Classes Table,” which is provided in Part 2.\n\nThe class posing a lower hazard will be identified as a subsidiary class. More than one subsidiary class is possible. Subsidiary classes are provided in brackets and are only listed in Column 3 of Schedule 1 (not Schedule 3). For example, “UN3518 ADSORBED GAS, TOXIC, OXIDIZING, CORROSIVE, N.O.S.” has three hazard classes assigned to it in Column 3 of Schedule 1. These are the primary class, 2.3, and two subsidiary hazard classes, 5.1 and 8.\n\nSCHEDULE 1\n\nHow do I determine the identification number / UN Number?\n\nBack to top\n\nOnce you have determined the shipping name for the dangerous good in Schedule 3 then look up the UN number in Column 1 of Schedule 1 (see above). If the product's name (e.g., chemical name) is listed in Schedule 1 or 3 then the primary class is in Column 3 of Schedule 1 and in Column 2 of Schedule 3 for that shipping name.\n\nHowever, if the product's name is not listed in Schedule 1 or 3, then the product must be tested at a laboratory.\n\nDo patient specimens need to be classified as UN3373?\n\nBack to top\n\nIt depends on the professional assessment of the patient’s specimen, which is based on medical history. See Transport Canada publication “Classification of patient specimens.”\n\nCan I use a UN number that is not included in the Canadian TDG Regulations?\n\nBack to top\n\nYes. Subsection 2.2(4) and Parts 9 and 10 of the TDG Regulations authorize you to use the classification from the:\n\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the transport of dangerous goods by air,\n\nInternational Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) Code for the transport of dangerous goods by ship or\n\nCode of Federal Regulations (49 CFR) (U.S. Regulations) for the transportation of dangerous goods by road. Note: The NA numbers in the 49 CFR are not permitted in Canada.\n\nHow do I determine the packing group?\n\nBack to top\n\nMany substances in Schedule 1 are assigned one or more packing groups. See Column 4 in Schedule 1. The packing group for a dangerous good is determined by using the laboratory test data and comparing it to the criteria in Part 2. For example, if you have a product for which you determined that the shipping name will be “FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S. (gasoline),” and the laboratory provided the following test result:\n\nInitial boiling point is greater than 35°C at an absolute pressure of 101.3 kPa\n\nFlashpoint[]\n\nux less than 23°C\n\nUsing this data and comparing it to that in Section 2.19, it is determined that this dangerous good needs to be assigned to Packing Group II.\n\nHow do I determine the compatibility group?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe compatibility group is only assigned for explosives. Consequently, the compatibility group will be already assigned by Natural Resources Canada. Information on compatibility groups is provided in Appendix 2 of Part 2 in the TDG Regulations.\n\nHow do I assign Categories A and B for the infectious substances?\n\nBack to top\n\nInformation on how to do the assignment is provided in Section 2.36 of Part 2. Meanwhile, the actual assigned category is obtained from Appendix 3 in Part 2.\n\nHow do I report the classification or shipping description on a shipping document?\n\nBack to top\n\nThe classification or shipping description is reported in the following order as per Part 3.5:\n\n(i) the UN number,\n\n(ii) the shipping name and, immediately after the shipping name unless it is already part of it,\n\n(a) for dangerous goods that are subject to special provision 16, the technical name, in parentheses, of at least one of the most dangerous substances that predominantly contributes to the hazard or hazards posed by the dangerous goods, and\n\n(b) for a liquefied petroleum gas that has not been odorized, the words “Not Odourized” or “Not Odorized” or “Sans odorisant”,\n\n(iii) the primary class, which may be shown as a number only or under the heading “Class” or “Classe” or following the word “Class” or “Classe”,\n\n(iv) for dangerous goods with a primary class of Class 1, Explosives, the compatibility group letter following the primary class,\n\n(v) the subsidiary class or classes, in parentheses, which may be shown as a number only or under the heading “subsidiary class” or “classe subsidiaire” or following the words “subsidiary class” or “classe subsidiaire”, except that, for transport by aircraft or by ship, the subsidiary class or classes may be shown after the information required by this paragraph,\n\n(vi) the packing group roman numeral, which may be shown under the heading “PG” or “GE” or following the letters “PG” or “GE” or following the words “Packing Group” or “Groupe d'emballage”, and\n\n(vii) for dangerous goods that are subject to special provision 23, the words “toxic by inhalation” or “toxic – inhalation hazard” or “toxique par inhalation” or “toxicité par inhalation”;\n\nNote that a dangerous good description will only include the requirements that are listed above that apply to it. So, if temperature control is not required for a dangerous good that is being transported then this information is not included. However, the order of information must be as presented above.\n\nExamples of classification descriptions of dangerous goods are:\n\nUN1203, GASOLINE, 3, II\n\nUN1203, GASOLINE, Class 3, PG II\n\nUN1214, ISOBUTYLAMINE, Class 3, Subsidiary Class (8), II\n\nUN1214, ISOBUTYLAMINE, Class 3(8), Packing Group II\n\nUN3381, TOXIC BY INHALATION LIQUID, N.O.S., Class 6.1 PG I\n\nUN 1075 LIQUEFIED PETROLEUM GASES (propane); Not odourized, Class 2.1\n\nUN 2902 PESTICIDE, LIQUID, TOXIC, N.O.S. (drazoxolon) Class 6.1\n\nUN 1993 WASTE FLAMMABLE LIQUID, N.O.S. (toluene and ethyl alcohol), 3, II\n\nAre the classifications for other modes or international shipments the same?\n\nBack to top\n\nAs per subsection 11.1(1) of the TDG Regulations, the IMDG Code must be consulted for international transport by ship.\n\nFor transport from the United States into Canada by road vehicle or railway vehicle, the shipping name used must be one that is recognized in Schedule 1 of the TDG Regulations or in the UN Recommendations.\n\nThe ICAO Technical Instructions, as well as Part 12, Air, of the TDG Regulations, must be consulted for all shipments by air.\n\nFact sheet last revised: 2024-04-09"
