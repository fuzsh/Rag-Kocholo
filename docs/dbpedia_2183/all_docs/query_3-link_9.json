        "text": "The acid dissociation constant, Ka\n\nYou can get a measure of the position of an equilibrium by writing an equilibrium constant for the reaction. The lower the value for the constant, the more the equilibrium lies to the left. The dissociation (ionization) of an acid is an example of a homogeneous reaction. Everything is present in the same phase - in this case, in solution in water. You can therefore write a simple expression for the equilibrium constant, Kc. Here is the equilibrium again:\n\n\\[HA + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + A^- \\tag{5}\\]\n\nYou might expect the equilibrium constant to be written as:\n\n\\[]K_c = \\dfrac{[H_3O^+][A^-]}{[HA][H_2O]} \\]\n\nHowever, if you think about this carefully, there is something odd about it.\n\nAt the bottom of the expression, you have a term for the concentration of the water in the solution. That's not a problem - except that the number is going to be very large compared with all the other numbers.\n\nIn 1 dm3 of solution, there are going to be about 55 moles of water.\n\nIf you had a weak acid with a concentration of about 1 mol dm-3, and only about 1% of it reacted with the water, the number of moles of water is only going to fall by about 0.01. In other words, if the acid is weak the concentration of the water is virtually constant. In that case, there isn't a lot of point in including it in the expression as if it were a variable. Instead, a new equilibrium constant is defined which leaves it out. This new equilibrium constant is called Ka.\n\nYou may find the Ka expression written differently if you work from the simplified version of the equilibrium reaction:\n\nThis may be written with or without state symbols.\n\nIt is actually exactly the same as the previous expression for Ka! Remember that although we often write H+ for hydrogen ions in solution, what we are actually talking about are hydroxonium ions. This second version of the Ka expression is not as precise as the first one.\n\nTo take a specific common example, the equilibrium for the dissociation of ethanoic acid is properly written as:\n\n\\[CH_3COOH + H_2O \\rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^- + H_3O^+ \\tag{7}\\]\n\nThe Ka expression is:\n\nIf you are using the simpler version of the equilibrium . . .\n\n\\[CH_3COOH \\rightleftharpoons CH_3COO^- + H^+ \\tag{8}\\]\n\n. . . the Ka expression is:\n\nThe table shows some values of Ka for some simple acids:\n\nacid Ka (mol dm-3) hydrofluoric acid 5.6 x 10-4 methanoic acid 1.6 x 10-4 ethanoic acid 1.7 x 10-5 hydrogen sulphide 8.9 x 10-8"
