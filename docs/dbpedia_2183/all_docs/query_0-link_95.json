        "text": "4 different techno tracks with acid touch und vielem mehr\n\nDublin musician and producer Daniel Jacobson aka ZOiD makes his debut on Winthorpe with 4 tracks of intricate melodies over jazz chords powered by eurorack drum modules and tb303 sequencing. The Pin Row Acid EP is the latest release from the Dublin techno-electro stalwart whose roots stretch back to the 90's. Introduced to techno by two DJs who lived in his neighbourhood, he hooked up with the cities legendary D1 label recording tracks in their studio and forming his own label - Diatribe - where he released the his debut 12\" -Subinersoll EP. 3 albums and several EP's later he follows up last years release on Dan Curtin's Metamorphic label with the first Winthorpe proper of 23. Kicking off proceedings with the MC-202 bounce of \"2-oh-Techno\" a short, snappy and break neck schizoid funky opener followed by the jazz chord progression of \"Winthorpe Acrid\". The baleriac pads of \"Sunrise Acid\" kick off the B side with extra grit added for good measure and the EP closes out with the exercise in chord sequencing that is \"Megajazz Acidchops\", an opus that's been forming in his head for some time."
