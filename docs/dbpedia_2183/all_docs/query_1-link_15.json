Megajazz Acidchops\n\nDublin musician and producer Daniel Jacobson aka ZOiD makes his debut on Winthorpe with 4 tracks of intricate melodies over jazz chords powered by eurorack drum modules and tb303 sequencing. The Pin Row Acid EP is the latest release from the Dublin techno-electro stalwart whose roots stretch back to the 90&#39;s. Introduced to techno by two DJs who lived in his neighbourhood, he hooked up with the cities legendary D1 label recording tracks in their studio and forming his own label - Diatribe - where he released the his debut 12&quot; -Subinersoll EP. 3 albums and several EP&#39;s later he follows up last years release on Dan Curtin&#39;s Metamorphic label with the first Winthorpe proper of 23. Kicking off proceedings with the MC-202 bounce of &quot;2-oh-Techno&quot; a short, snappy and break neck schizoid funky opener followed by the jazz chord progression of &quot;Winthorpe Acrid&quot;. The baleriac pads of &quot;Sunrise Acid&quot; kick off the B side with extra grit added for good measure and the EP closes out with the exercise in chord sequencing that is &quot;Megajazz Acidchops&quot;, an opus that&#39;s been forming in his head for some time.",
