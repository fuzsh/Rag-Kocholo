        "text": "List of statements that appear to contradict themselves\n\nThis is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness. You can help by adding missing items with reliable sources.\n\nThis list includes well known paradoxes, grouped thematically. The grouping is approximate, as paradoxes may fit into more than one category. This list collects only scenarios that have been called a paradox by at least one source and have their own article in this encyclopedia. Although considered paradoxes, some of these are simply based on fallacious reasoning (falsidical), or an unintuitive solution (veridical). Informally, the term paradox is often used to describe a counter-intuitive result.\n\nHowever, some of these paradoxes qualify to fit into the mainstream viewpoint of a paradox, which is a self-contradictory result gained even while properly applying accepted ways of reasoning. These paradoxes, often called antinomy, point out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.\n\nBarbershop paradox: The supposition that, \"if one of two simultaneous assumptions leads to a contradiction, the other assumption is also disproved\" leads to paradoxical consequences. Not to be confused with the Barber paradox.\n\nWhat the Tortoise Said to Achilles: If a presumption needs to be made that a specific result can be deduced from premises, then the result can never be deduced. An inference rule, which is valid (or not), cannot be a premise, which is true (or false), otherwise one has an infinite regress. Also known as Carroll's paradox and is not to be confused with the \"Achilles and the tortoise\" paradox by Zeno of Elea.\n\nCatch-22: A situation in which someone is in need of something that can only be had by not being in need of it. A soldier who wants to be declared insane to avoid combat is deemed not insane for that very reason and will therefore not be declared insane.\n\nDrinker paradox: In any pub there is a customer such that if that customer is drinking, everybody in the pub is drinking.\n\nParadox of free choice: Disjunction introduction poses a problem for modal inferences, permitting arbitrary modal statements to be inferred.\n\nParadox of entailment: Inconsistent premises always make an argument valid.\n\nLottery paradox: If there is one winning ticket in a large lottery, it is reasonable to believe of any particular lottery ticket that it is not the winning ticket, but it is not reasonable to believe that no lottery ticket will win.\n\nRaven paradox: (or Hempel's Ravens): Observing a green apple increases the likelihood of all ravens being black.\n\nRoss' paradox: Disjunction introduction poses a problem for imperative inference by seemingly permitting arbitrary imperatives to be inferred.\n\nTemperature paradox: If the temperature is 90 and the temperature is rising, that would seem to entail that 90 is rising.\n\nUnexpected hanging paradox: The day of the hanging will be a surprise, so it cannot happen at all, so it will be a surprise. The surprise examination and Bottle Imp paradox use similar logic.\n\nThese paradoxes have in common a contradiction arising from either self-reference or circular reference, in which several statements refer to each other in a way that following some of the references leads back to the starting point.\n\nBarber paradox: A male barber shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? (Russell's popularization of his set theoretic paradox.) Not to be confused with the Barbershop paradox.\n\nBhartrhari's paradox: The thesis that there are some things which are unnameable conflicts with the notion that something is named by calling it unnameable.\n\nBerry paradox: The phrase \"the first number not nameable in under ten words\" appears to name it in nine words.\n\nCrocodile dilemma: If a crocodile steals a child and promises its return if the father can correctly guess exactly what the crocodile will do, how should the crocodile respond in the case that the father guesses that the child will not be returned?\n\nParadox of the Court: A law student agrees to pay his teacher after (and only after) winning his first case. The teacher then sues the student (who has not yet won a case) for payment.\n\nCurry's paradox: \"If this sentence is true, then Germany borders China.\"\n\nEpimenides paradox: A Cretan says: \"All Cretans are liars\". This paradox works in mainly the same way as the liar paradox.\n\nGrelling–Nelson paradox: Is the word \"heterological\", meaning \"not applicable to itself\", a heterological word? (A close relative of Russell's paradox.)\n\nHilbert–Bernays paradox: If there was a name for a natural number that is identical to a name of the successor of that number, there would be a natural number equal to its successor.\n\nI know that I know nothing: Purportedly said by Socrates.\n\nKleene–Rosser paradox: By formulating an equivalent to Richard's paradox, untyped lambda calculus is shown to be inconsistent.\n\nKnower paradox: \"This sentence is not known.\"\n\nLiar paradox: \"This sentence is false.\" This is the canonical self-referential paradox. Also \"Is the answer to this question 'no'?\", and \"I'm lying.\"\n\nCard paradox: \"The next statement is true. The previous statement is false.\" A variant of the liar paradox in which neither of the sentences employs (direct) self-reference, instead this is a case of circular reference.\n\nNo-no paradox: Two sentences that each say the other is not true.\n\nPinocchio paradox: What would happen if Pinocchio said \"My nose grows now\"?[1]\n\nQuine's paradox: \"'Yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation' yields a falsehood when appended to its own quotation.\" Shows that a sentence can be paradoxical even if it is not self-referring and does not use demonstratives or indexicals.\n\nYablo's paradox: An ordered infinite sequence of sentences, each of which says that all following sentences are false. While constructed to avoid self-reference, there is no consensus whether it relies on self-reference or not.\n\nOpposite Day: \"It is opposite day today.\" Therefore, it is not opposite day, but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day, which contradicts the fact that it has previously been stated that it is an opposite day.\n\nRichard's paradox: We appear to be able to use simple English to define a decimal expansion in a way that is self-contradictory.\n\nRussell's paradox: Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?\n\nShip of Theseus: It seems like one can replace any component of a ship, and it is still the same ship. So they can replace them all, one at a time, and it is still the same ship. However, they can then take all the original pieces, and assemble them into a ship. That, too, is the same ship they began with.\n\nSee also List of Ship of Theseus examples\n\nSorites paradox (also known as the paradox of the heap): If one removes a single grain of sand from a heap, they still have a heap. If they keep removing single grains, the heap will disappear. Can a single grain of sand make the difference between heap and non-heap?\n\nAll horses are the same color: A fallacious argument by induction that appears to prove that all horses are the same color.\n\nAnt on a rubber rope: An ant crawling on a rubber rope can reach the end even when the rope stretches much faster than the ant can crawl.\n\nCramer's paradox: The number of points of intersection of two higher-order curves can be greater than the number of arbitrary points needed to define one such curve.\n\nElevator paradox: Elevators can seem to be mostly going in one direction, as if they were being manufactured in the middle of the building and being disassembled on the roof and basement.\n\nInteresting number paradox: The first number that can be considered \"dull\" rather than \"interesting\" becomes interesting because of that fact.\n\nPotato paradox: If potatoes consisting of 99% water dry until they are 98% water, they lose 50% of their weight.\n\nRussell's paradox: Does the set of all those sets that do not contain themselves contain itself?\n\nSee also: Category:Statistical paradoxes\n\nAbelson's paradox: Effect size may not be indicative of practical meaning.\n\nAccuracy paradox: Predictive models with a given level of accuracy may have greater predictive power than models with higher accuracy.\n\nBerkson's paradox: A complicating factor arising in statistical tests of proportions.\n\nFreedman's paradox: Describes a problem in model selection where predictor variables with no explanatory power can appear artificially important.\n\nFriendship paradox: For almost everyone, their friends have more friends than they do.\n\nInspection paradox: (Bus waiting time paradox) For a given random distribution of bus arrivals, the average rider at a bus stop observes more delays than the average operator of the buses.\n\nLindley's paradox: Tiny errors in the null hypothesis are magnified when large data sets are analyzed, leading to false but highly statistically significant results.\n\nLow birth weight paradox: Low birth weight and mothers who smoke contribute to a higher mortality rate. Babies of smokers have lower average birth weight, but low birth weight babies born to smokers have a lower mortality rate than other low birth weight babies. This is a special case of Simpson's paradox.\n\nSimpson's paradox, or the Yule–Simpson effect: A trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined, and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data.\n\nWill Rogers phenomenon: The mathematical concept of an average, whether defined as the mean or median, leads to apparently paradoxical results—for example, it is possible that moving an entry from an encyclopedia to a dictionary would increase the average entry length on both books.\n\nSee also: Category:Probability theory paradoxes\n\nBertrand's box paradox: A paradox of conditional probability closely related to the Boy or Girl paradox.\n\nBertrand's paradox: Different common-sense definitions of randomness give quite different results.\n\nBirthday paradox: In a random group of only 23 people, there is a better than 50/50 chance two of them have the same birthday.\n\nBorel's paradox: Conditional probability density functions are not invariant under coordinate transformations.\n\nBoy or Girl paradox: A two-child family has at least one boy. What is the probability that it has a girl?\n\nFalse positive paradox: A test that is accurate the vast majority of the time could show you have a disease, but the probability that you actually have it could still be tiny.\n\nGrice's paradox: Shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination.\n\nIntransitive dice: One can have three dice, called A, B, and C, such that A is likely to win in a roll against B, B is likely to win in a roll against C, and C is likely to win in a roll against A.\n\nMonty Hall problem, also known as the Monty Hall paradox:[2] An unintuitive consequence of conditional probability.\n\nNecktie paradox: A wager between two people seems to favour them both. Very similar in essence to the Two-envelope paradox.\n\nProebsting's paradox: The Kelly criterion is an often optimal strategy for maximizing profit in the long run. Proebsting's paradox apparently shows that the Kelly criterion can lead to ruin.\n\nSleeping Beauty problem: A probability problem that can be correctly answered as one half or one third depending on how the question is approached.\n\nThree Prisoners problem, also known as the Three Prisoners paradox:[3] A variation of the Monty Hall problem.\n\nTwo-envelope paradox: You are given two indistinguishable envelopes, each of which contains a positive sum of money. One envelope contains twice as much as the other. You may pick one envelope and keep whatever amount it contains. You pick one envelope at random but before you open it you are given the chance to take the other envelope instead.\n\nBurali-Forti paradox: If the ordinal numbers formed a set, it would be an ordinal number that is smaller than itself.\n\nCantor's paradox: The set of all sets would have its own power set as a subset, therefore its cardinality would be at least as great as that of its power set. But Cantor's theorem proves that power sets are strictly greater than the sets they are constructed from. Consequently, the set of all sets would contain a subset greater than itself.\n\nGalileo's paradox: Though most numbers are not squares, there are no more numbers than squares. (See also Cantor's diagonal argument)\n\nHilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel: If a hotel with infinitely many rooms is full, it can still take in more guests.\n\nSkolem's paradox: Countably infinite models of set theory contain sets that are uncountable in the sense of the model.\n\nZeno's paradoxes: \"You will never reach point B from point A as you must always get half-way there, and half of the half, and half of that half, and so on.\" (This is also a physical paradox.)\n\nSupertasks may result in paradoxes such as\n\nBenardete's paradox: Apparently, a man can be \"forced to stay where he is by the mere unfulfilled intentions of the gods\".\n\nGrim Reaper paradox: An infinite number of assassins can create an explicit self-contradiction by scheduling their assassinations at certain times.\n\nGrandi's series: The sum of 1−1+1−1+1−1... can be either one, zero, or one-half.\n\nRoss–Littlewood paradox: After alternately adding and removing balls to a vase infinitely often, how many balls remain?\n\nThomson's lamp: After flicking a lamp on and off infinitely often, is it on or off?\n\nBanach–Tarski paradox: A ball can be cut into a finite number of pieces and re-assembling the pieces will get two balls, each of equal size to the first. The von Neumann paradox is a two-dimensional version.\n\nParadoxical set: A set that can be partitioned into two sets, each of which is equivalent to the original.\n\nCoastline paradox: the perimeter of a landmass is in general ill-defined.\n\nCoin rotation paradox: a coin rotating along the edge of an identical coin will make a full revolution after traversing only half of the stationary coin's circumference.\n\nGabriel's Horn: or Torricelli's trumpet: A simple object with finite volume but infinite surface area. Also, the Mandelbrot set and various other fractals are covered by a finite area, but have an infinite perimeter (in fact, there are no two distinct points on the boundary of the Mandelbrot set that can be reached from one another by moving a finite distance along that boundary, which also implies that in a sense you go no further if you walk \"the wrong way\" around the set to reach a nearby point).\n\nHausdorff paradox: There exists a countable subset C of the sphere S such that S\\C is equidecomposable with two copies of itself.\n\nHooper's paradox: An image with many pieces whose size is 32 m², but drops down to 30 m² when its pieces are rearranged\n\nNikodym set: A set contained in and with the same Lebesgue measure as the unit square, yet for every one of its points there is a straight line intersecting the Nikodym set only in that point.\n\nSphere eversion: A sphere can, topologically, be turned inside out.\n\nAbilene paradox: People can make decisions based not on what they actually want to do, but on what they think that other people want to do, with the result that everybody decides to do something that nobody really wants to do, but only what they thought that everybody else wanted to do.\n\nApportionment paradox: Some systems of apportioning representation can have unintuitive results due to rounding\n\nAlabama paradox: Increasing the total number of seats might shrink one block's seats.\n\nNew states paradox: Adding a new state or voting block might increase the number of votes of another.\n\nPopulation paradox: A fast-growing state can lose votes to a slow-growing state.\n\nArrow's paradox: Given more than two choices, no system can have all the attributes of an ideal voting system at once.\n\nBuridan's ass: How can a rational choice be made between two outcomes of equal value?\n\nChainstore paradox: Even those who know better play the so-called chain store game in an irrational manner.\n\nDecision-making paradox: Selecting the best decision-making method is a decision problem in itself.\n\nEllsberg paradox: People exhibit ambiguity aversion (as distinct from risk aversion), in contradiction with expected utility theory.\n\nFenno's paradox: The belief that people generally disapprove of the United States Congress as a whole, but support the Congressman from their own Congressional district.\n\nFredkin's paradox: The more similar two choices are, the more time a decision-making agent spends on deciding.\n\nGreen paradox: Policies intending to reduce future CO2 emissions may lead to increased emissions in the present.\n\nHedgehog's dilemma: Despite goodwill, human intimacy cannot occur without substantial mutual harm.\n\nInventor's paradox: It is easier to solve a more general problem that covers the specifics of the sought-after solution.\n\nKavka's toxin puzzle: Can one intend to drink the non-deadly toxin, if the intention is the only thing needed to get the reward?\n\nMotivation crowding theory: Adding incentives for some behavior can sometimes backfire and actually result in less of that behavior.\n\nMorton's fork: a type of false dilemma in which contradictory observations lead to the same conclusion.\n\nNavigation paradox: Increased navigational precision may result in increased collision risk.\n\nNewcomb's paradox: How do you play a game against an omniscient opponent?\n\nNo-show paradox: A situation in some voting systems where voting for one's candidate could cause them to lose, as opposed to not showing up to vote-\n\nParadox of tolerance: A tolerant society that tolerates intolerant ideas becomes less tolerant overall.\n\nParadox of voting: Also known as the Downs paradox. For a rational, self-interested voter the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits, so why do people keep voting?\n\nParrondo's paradox: It is possible to play two losing games alternately to eventually win.\n\nPreparedness paradox: After preparing to avoid a catastrophe and lessening the damage, the perception regarding the catastrophe would be much less serious due to the limited damage caused after.\n\nPrevention paradox: For one person to benefit, many people have to change their behavior – even though they receive no benefit, or even suffer, from the change.\n\nPrisoner's dilemma: Two people might not cooperate even if it is in both their best interests to do so.\n\nVoting paradox: Also known as Condorcet's paradox and paradox of voting. A group of separately rational individuals may have preferences that are irrational in the aggregate.\n\nWillpower paradox: Those who keep their minds open are more goal-directed and more motivated than those who declare their objectives to themselves.\n\nFurther information: Physical paradox\n\nCool tropics paradox: A contradiction between modelled estimates of tropical temperatures during warm, ice-free periods of the Cretaceous and Eocene, and the lower temperatures that proxies suggest were present.\n\nIrresistible force paradox: What would happen if an unstoppable force hit an immovable object?\n\nThe moving rows: Suppose two rows are moving past a stationary row in opposite directions. If a member of a moving row moves past a member of the stationary row in an indivisible instant of time, they move past two members of the row that is moving in the other direction in this instant of time.\n\nParadox of place: If everything that exists has a place, that place must have a place, and so on ad infinitum.\n\nParadox of the grain of millet: When a grain of millet falls it makes no sound, but when a thousand grains fall they do, thus many of nothing become something.\n\nAlgol paradox: In some binary star systems the partners seem to have different ages, even though they are thought to have formed at the same time.\n\nFaint young Sun paradox: The contradiction between existence of liquid water early in the Earth's history and the expectation that the output of the young Sun would have been insufficient to melt ice on Earth.\n\nOlbers' paradox: Why is the night sky dark if there is an infinity of stars, covering every part of the celestial sphere?\n\nGZK paradox: Extreme-energy cosmic rays (like the Oh-My-God particle and several others after it) have been observed that seem to violate the Greisen–Zatsepin–Kuzmin limit, which is a consequence of special relativity.\n\nParadox of youth: Compared to theory, there is an overabundance of young stars close to the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Center.\n\nAchilles and the tortoise: If the tortoise is ahead of Achilles, by the time Achilles reaches the tortoise's current position, the tortoise will have moved a bit further ahead, which goes on indefinitely.\n\nArcher's paradox: An archer must, in order to hit his target, not aim directly at it, but slightly to the side. Not to be confused with the arrow paradox.\n\nArrow paradox : If we divide time into discrete 0-duration slices, no motion is happening in each of them, so taking them all as a whole, motion is impossible.\n\nAristotle's wheel paradox: Rolling joined concentric wheels seem to trace the same distance with their circumferences, even though the circumferences are different.\n\nCarroll's paradox: The angular momentum of a stick should be zero, but is not.\n\nD'Alembert's paradox: Flow of an inviscid fluid produces no net force on a solid body.\n\nKnudsen paradox: Based on the Navier–Stokes equations, one would expect the mass flux in a channel to decrease with increasing Knudsen number, but there is a distinct minimum around Knudsen number 0.8.\n\nDenny's paradox: Surface-dwelling arthropods (such as the water strider) should not be able to propel themselves horizontally.\n\nDichotomy paradox: To reach its target, an airborne arrow must first reach an infinite number of midpoints between its current position and the target.\n\nElevator paradox: Even though hydrometers are used to measure fluid density, a hydrometer will not indicate changes of fluid density caused by changing atmospheric pressure.\n\nFeynman sprinkler: Which way does a sprinkler rotate when submerged in a tank and made to suck in the surrounding fluid?\n\nHydrostatic paradox: A massive battleship can float in a few litres of water.\n\nNorton's dome: Are there non-deterministic systems in Newtonian mechanics?\n\nPainlevé paradox: Rigid-body dynamics with contact and friction is inconsistent.\n\nTea leaf paradox: When a cup of tea is stirred, the leaves assemble in the center, even though centrifugal force pushes them outward.\n\nUpstream contamination: When a fluid is poured from a higher container onto a lower one, particles can climb up the falling water.\n\nBentley's paradox: In a Newtonian universe, gravitation should pull all matter into a single point.\n\nBoltzmann brain: If the universe we observe resulted from a random thermodynamic fluctuation, it would be vastly more likely to be a simple one than the complex one we observe. The simplest case would be just a brain floating in vacuum, having the thoughts and sensations an ostensible observer has.\n\nFermi paradox: If there are, as various arguments suggest, many other sentient species in the universe, then where are they? Should their presence not be obvious?\n\nHeat death paradox: If the universe were infinitely old, it would be in thermodynamic equilibrium, which contradicts what we observe.\n\nOlbers' paradox: Why is the night sky dark if there is an infinity of stars, covering every part of the celestial sphere?\n\nFaraday paradox: An apparent violation of Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction.\n\nTwo capacitor paradox: an apparent violation of energy of an electric circuit composed of two ideal capacitors\n\nAharonov–Bohm effect: A charged particle is affected by an electromagnetic field even though it has no local contact with that field.\n\nBell's theorem: Why do measured quantum particles not satisfy mathematical probability theory?\n\nDouble-slit experiment: Matter and energy can act as a wave or as a particle depending on the experiment.\n\nEinstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox: Can far away events influence each other in quantum mechanics?\n\nExtinction paradox: In the small wavelength limit, the total scattering cross section of an impenetrable sphere is twice its geometrical cross-sectional area (which is the value obtained in classical mechanics).[4]\n\nHardy's paradox: How can we make inferences about past events that we have not observed while at the same time acknowledge that the act of observing it affects the reality we are inferring to?\n\nKlein paradox: When the potential of a potential barrier becomes similar to the mass of the impinging particle, it becomes transparent.\n\nMott problem, also known as the Mott paradox:[5] Spherically symmetric wave functions, when observed, produce linear particle tracks.\n\nQuantum Zeno effect: (Turing paradox) echoing the Zeno paradox, a quantum particle that is continuously observed cannot change its state\n\nSchrödinger's cat paradox: According to the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, a cat could be simultaneously alive and dead, as long as it remains unobserved.\n\nUncertainty principle: There is a fundamental limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties of a particle, known as complementary variables, such as position and momentum can be known. This is often confused with a similar effect in physics called the observer effect.\n\nBell's spaceship paradox: About the stress on a rope under the effects of length contraction.\n\nBlack hole information paradox: Black holes violate a commonly assumed tenet of science that information cannot be destroyed.\n\nEhrenfest paradox: On the kinematics of a rigid rotating disk.\n\nLadder paradox: Introductory relativity problem about a ladder, a barn, and simultaneity.\n\nMocanu's velocity composition paradox: Which formula should be used to transform velocities between non-collinear reference frames in special relativity?\n\nParadox of radiation of charged particles in a gravitational field: An accelerated charge should radiate, yet such radiation is not observed for stationary particles on gravitational fields.\n\nSupplee's paradox: The buoyancy of a relativistic object (such as a bullet) appears to change when the reference frame is changed from one in which the bullet is at rest to one in which the fluid is at rest.\n\nTachyonic antitelephone: Einstein's thought experiment about how faster-than-light communication could cause a causality paradox.\n\nTrouton-Noble or Right-angle lever paradox: Does a torque arise in static systems when changing frames?\n\nTwin paradox: The theory of relativity predicts that a person making a round trip will return younger than their identical twin who stayed at home.\n\nGibbs paradox: In an ideal gas, is entropy an extensive variable?\n\nLoschmidt's paradox: Why is there an inevitable increase in entropy when the laws of physics are invariant under time reversal? The time reversal symmetry of physical laws appears to contradict the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nMaxwell's demon: The second law of thermodynamics seems to be violated by a cleverly operated trapdoor.[6]\n\nMpemba effect: Hot water can, under certain conditions, freeze faster than cold water, even though it must pass the lower temperature on the way to freezing.\n\nAntarctic paradox: In some areas of the oceans, phytoplankton concentrations are low despite there apparently being sufficient nutrients.\n\nC-value enigma: Genome size does not correlate with organismal complexity. For example, some unicellular organisms have genomes much larger than that of humans.\n\nCole's paradox: Even a tiny fecundity advantage of one additional offspring would favor the evolution of semelparity.\n\nGray's paradox: Despite their relatively small muscle mass, dolphins can swim at high speeds and obtain large accelerations.\n\nHormesis: Exposure to small doses of toxins can have beneficial effects.\n\nLek paradox: Persistent female choice for particular male trait values should erode genetic variance in male traits and thereby remove the benefits of choice, yet choice persists.\n\nLombard's paradox: When rising to stand from a sitting or squatting position, both the hamstrings and quadriceps contract at the same time, despite their being antagonists to each other.\n\nParadox of enrichment: Increasing the food available to an ecosystem may lead to instability, and even to extinction.\n\nParadox of the pesticides: Applying pesticide to a pest may increase the pest's abundance.\n\nParadox of the plankton: Why are there so many different species of phytoplankton, even though competition for the same resources tends to reduce the number of species?\n\nSherman paradox: An anomalous pattern of inheritance in the fragile X syndrome.\n\nTaxonomic boundary paradox: The concept for a taxon can overlap in the past.\n\nTemporal paradox (paleontology): When did the ancestors of birds live?\n\nExercise paradox: The finding that individuals with an active lifestyle have a relatively similar caloric expenditure to individuals in a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nFrench paradox: The observation that the French suffer a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease, despite having a diet relatively rich in saturated fats, which are assumed to be the leading dietary cause of such disease.\n\nGlucose paradox: The large amount of glycogen in the liver cannot be explained by its small glucose absorption.\n\nHispanic paradox: The finding that Hispanics in the United States tend to have substantially better health than the average population in spite of what their aggregate socio-economic indicators predict.\n\nIsraeli paradox: The observation that Israelis suffer a relatively high incidence of coronary heart disease, despite having a diet very low in saturated fats, which are assumed to be the leading dietary cause of such disease.\n\nMexican paradox: Mexican children tend to have higher birth weights than can be expected from their socio-economic status.\n\nObesity paradox: In some medical conditions, obesity is associated with increased survival, although there is a strong association with shortened lifespan in the general population.\n\nPeto's paradox: Humans and other small-to-medium-sized mammals get cancer with high frequency, while larger mammals, like whales, do not. If cancer is essentially a negative outcome lottery at the cell level, and larger organisms have more cells, and thus more potentially cancerous cell divisions, one would expect larger organisms to be more predisposed to cancer.\n\nPulsus paradoxus: A pulsus paradoxus is an exaggerated decrease in systolic blood pressure during inspiration. It can indicate certain medical conditions in which there is reduced cardiac output, such as cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis.
