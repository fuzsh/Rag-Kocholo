        "text": "Key Concepts\n\nSubstances react chemically in characteristic ways.\n\nA set of reactions can be used to identify an unknown substance.\n\nSummary\n\nStudents will use test liquids on different known powders and observe their reactions. Then students will use these characteristic chemical changes to help them identify an unknown powder.\n\nObjective\n\nStudents will be able to identify and control variables to develop a test to identify an unknown powder. Students will be able to explain that a substance reacts chemically in characteristic ways and that these characteristics can be used to identify an unknown substance.\n\nGive Each Group a Testing Chart.\n\nMake one copy of the testing chart, found at the end of the downloaded activity sheet, for each group. Either laminate this testing chart or have students lay a piece of wax paper over it.\n\nGive each student an activity sheet.\n\nLesson 6.6 Student Activity Sheet PDF | DOCX | Google Doc\n\n(Includes Testing Chart)\n\nLesson 6.6 Activity Sheet Answers PDF | DOCX | Google Doc\n\nDownload the student activity sheet, and distribute one per student.\n\nAll Downloads\n\nThe activity sheet will serve as the “Evaluate” component of each 5-E lesson plan. The activity sheets are formative assessments of student progress and understanding. A more formal summative assessment is included at the end of each chapter.\n\nStudents will record their observations and answer questions about the activity on the activity sheet. The Explain It with Atoms and Molecules and Take It Further sections of the activity sheet will either be completed as a class, in groups, or individually depending on your instructions. Look at the teacher version of the activity sheet to find the questions and answers.\n\nExplain that each powder will react in a certain way with each solution used to test it. Each powder and solution pair is one set of reactants. Let students know that in some cases, no chemical reaction will occur.\n\nStudents will need to observe and record the reactions the liquids have with each powder.\n\nHave students look at the testing chart. Point out that the names of the four test solutions are on the left and the names of the different powders are on the top.\n\nThere is also one column for an unknown powder. Explain that after testing all four known powders and recording their observations, you will give students an unknown powder to identify.\n\nExplain that each substance is made up of certain molecules which interact with the molecules in each test liquid in a characteristic way. Some of these interactions result in a chemical reaction and others do not. However, each observation students made is based on the way the molecules of each powder interact with the molecules of each test solution.\n\nRemind students that baking powder was the only substance that bubbled when water was added to it. Bubbling in a chemical reaction is a sign that a gas is one of the products. Tell students that baking powder is a combination of different powders—baking soda, cream of tartar, and cornstarch. Two of these three react with one another and produce a gas when water is added. Students will need to test all the possible combinations of two powders with water. This way they can figure out which two powders cause baking powder to bubble with water."
