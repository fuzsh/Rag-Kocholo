According to the respective product specification, different dangerous goods (hazmat) classifications apply, which can be found in the following table.\n\nAccording to the a. m. transport regulations and depending on properties of the specific grade, our products are classified either as oxidizers belonging to hazard class 5.1 (UN 3149) or as organic peroxides belonging to class 5.2 (UN 3109, UN 3105). Our peracetic acid grades are transported in specially approved containers. They are not subject to transport under temperature control and hence do not require cooling during transportation."
