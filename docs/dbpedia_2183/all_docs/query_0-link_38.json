        "text": "Enhance nutrient uptake, nutrient efficacy, tolerance to abiotic stress, and overall crop quality.\n\nFront Row Si is a 10% Silicic Acid that uses new polylol stabilizing technology, and contains no PEG (polyethylene glycol) meaning better solubility and less precipitates. Used as a root or foliar feed, it helps enhance nutrient uptake, nutrient efficacy, and overall crop quality while protecting against drought, temperature flux and other stresses.\n\nThe presence of silicic acid within the plant and rhizosphere provides many benefits including structural strength, plays an active role in physiological processes i.e. regulating uptake of other nutrients, and a role in proper plant development.\n\nFoliar: 0.5 ML/Gal\n\nReservoir: 0.13 - 0.5 ML/Gal\n\nStock Concentrate:\n\n50 ML/Gal - 250 ML/Gal\n\nFront Row Si dilutions must decrease as feed strength increases to avoid precipitates. See Feed Charts for baseline recommendations.\n\nLearn about Monosilicic Acid in our blog article Stabilized MSA Products in Horticulture: Unlocking The Power of Silica\n\nUSAGE NOTES\n\n• Si in batch tanks or reservoirs must be fully used within 48 hours - if this isn’t possible, foliar application is preferred."
