        "text": "Jo Brand has stated that she believes freedom of speech is extremely important in comedy after receiving a backlash for comments about throwing acid at politicans.\n\nThe comedian and presenter of Great British Bake Off's spin-off An Extra Slice made the comments when approached by journalists from Sky News.\n\nIt was clear the 61-year-old didn't want to make a comment but was repeatedly asked how important having free speech was.\n\nShe eventually replied just before entering a building with a man who was keeping her apart from those asking the questions.\n\nJo's original comments came during an appearance on BBC Radio Four show Heresy.\n\nThe 61-year-old was speaking to Victoria Coren Mitchell and said that she fantasised about throwing acid at 'unpleasant characters'.\n\nVictoria said: \"Would you not say Jo, that we are absolutely united in feeling we are living through a terrible time from a parliamentary point of view?\"\n\nJo replied: \"Well yes I would say that because certain unpleasant characters are being thrown to the fore, and they’re very, very easy to hate, and I’m kind of thinking, why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?\n\n\"That’s just me, sorry, I’m not gonna do it, it’s purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do. Sorry.\"\n\nShe has faced a backlash for making the statement, with leader of the Brexit Party Nigel Farage stating that the police should get involved.\n\nHe was 'milkshaked' when touring the country ahead of the European elections last month as were a number of other high profile people.\n\nOutgoing Prime Minister Theresa May has also now got involved in the row with her spokesman saying: \"The prime minister has consistently said politicians should be able to campaign without harassment, intimidation and abuse.\n\n\"It is for the BBC to explain why it was appropriate content to broadcast.\""
