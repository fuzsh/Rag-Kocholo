Just a cheap way to behave badly then shelve responsibility by putting the onus on the other person to be forgiving.”\n\n― Minette Walters, The Chameleon's Shadow\n\n“Life is pure farce from beginning to end, with a little\n\nblack comedy thrown in for shade. If it was anything\n\nelse, mankind would have stuck his collective head in\n\nthe gas oyen years ago. No one could tolerate seventy\n\nyears of tragedy. When I die - probably of cancer -\n\nJane has prornised to put on my tombstone: \"Here\n\nlies Anne Cattrell who laughed her way through it.\n\nThe joke was on her but at least she knew it.\" (The Ice House)”\n\n― Minette Walters\n\n“We all know it's safer to beat up on people who won't retaliate,' he told her, 'but it's a quick way to lose friends. You need to find ways of dealing with confrontation when it happens.”\n\n― Minette Walters\n\n“I happen to think the relationship between the police and society is drifting out of balance. The police have forgotten that they are there only by invitation, while society has forgotten that because it chooses the laws which regulate it, it has a responsibility to uphold them. The relationship should be mutually supportive.”\n\n― Minette Walters, The Scold's Bridle\n\n“I bless God daily for the bonds of affection that have held us together and brought us through the pestilence. To be loved and honored for who we are, and not what our status represents, is surely the lesson He wanted us to learn when he sent His son to live as a carpenter and not as a king. The future will be bright indeed when even the humblest are given the chance to prove their worth.”\n\n― Minette Walters\n\n“After being shown the demesne by Pikeman, and consulting with him at length, the elders had expressed their willingness to bring their fellows to live and work in Bourne on the same terms that My Lord had agreed with his own serfs. Hugh watched in disbelief as Bourne signed a writ, prepared by Thurkell, which not only granted them extra land but rights of access to education, medicine and a meal of meat every seven days. It was a word in disarray when base-born men, sworn to obedience through their oaths of fealty, could expect rewards in return for their labour.\n\nPg 135”\n\n― Minette Walters, The Turn of Midnight\n\n“After being shown the demesne by Pikeman, and consulting with him at length, the elders had expressed their willingness to bring their fellows to live and work in Bourne on the same terms that My Lord had agreed with his own serfs. Hugh watched in disbelief as Bourne signed a writ, prepared by Thurkell, which not only granted them extra land but rights of access to education, medicine and a meal of meat every seven days.
