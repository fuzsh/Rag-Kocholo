        "text": "What is inflammation?\n\nInflammation is your body’s response to an illness, injury or something that doesn’t belong in your body (like germs or toxic chemicals). Inflammation is a normal and important process that allows your body to heal. Fever, for example, is how you know your body’s inflammatory system is working correctly when you’re ill. But inflammation can harm you if it occurs in healthy tissues or goes on for too long.\n\nWhen an invader (like a virus) tries to enter your body, or you get injured, your immune system sends out its first responders. These are inflammatory cells and cytokines (substances that stimulate more inflammatory cells). These cells begin an inflammatory response to trap germs or toxins and start healing injured tissue. Inflammation can cause pain, swelling or discoloration. These are signs your body is healing itself. Normal inflammation should be mild, and pain shouldn’t be extreme.\n\nBut inflammation can also affect parts of your body you can’t see. Inflammatory responses that occur behind the scenes can help you heal, but other times, they can harm your health.\n\nWhat’s the difference between acute and chronic inflammation?\n\nThere are two main types of inflammation: acute and chronic. Acute inflammation is sudden and temporary, while chronic inflammation can go on for months or years.\n\nAcute inflammation\n\nThis is your immune system’s response to a sudden injury or illness. Inflammatory cells travel to the site of injury (like a cut on your finger) or infection and start the healing process.\n\nInfections in different parts of your body can cause sudden, and usually short-lived, inflammation. For example, bacterial infections like strep throat and viral infections like the flu can cause throat inflammation. Other bacterial and viral infections can cause inflammation of your small intestine (enteritis).\n\nAcute inflammation may last for a few hours to a few days, depending on your condition.\n\nChronic inflammation\n\nThis is when your body continues sending inflammatory cells even when there’s no danger. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory cells and substances attack joint tissues. This leads to inflammation that comes and goes and can cause severe damage to your joints.\n\nWith chronic inflammation, processes that normally protect your body end up hurting it. Chronic inflammation can last for months or years. You may have periods where it improves and other times when it gets worse.\n\nResearchers have linked chronic inflammation to a wide range of conditions (inflammatory diseases).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat are the symptoms of acute inflammation?\n\nWhen an injury to a specific part of your body occurs, you may notice:\n\nDiscolored or flushed skin.\n\nPain or tenderness that should be mild and only in the area of the injury.\n\nSwelling (for example, knee inflammation).\n\nSkin that feels hot to the touch.\n\nInability to use that part of your body as you normally would (for example, reduced range of motion).\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic inflammation?\n\nChronic inflammation symptoms may be harder to spot than acute inflammation symptoms. You may have:\n\nAbdominal (belly) pain.\n\nChest pain.\n\nFatigue and/or insomnia.\n\nFever.\n\nJoint pain or stiffness.\n\nMouth sores.\n\nA skin rash.\n\nDepression, anxiety and other mood disorders.\n\nGastrointestinal (GI) issues, like diarrhea, constipation and acid reflux.\n\nWeight gain or weight loss.\n\nFrequent infections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat conditions are associated with chronic inflammation?\n\nChronic inflammation is involved in the disease process of many conditions, including:\n\nAutoimmune diseases, like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis (AS).\n\nCardiovascular diseases, such as heart disease and high blood pressure.\n\nCertain cancers.\n\nGastrointestinal diseases, like Crohn’s disease and inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nLung diseases, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nMental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety.\n\nMetabolic diseases, like Type 2 diabetes.\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.\n\nTogether, inflammatory diseases account for more than half of all deaths globally.\n\nHow do you reduce inflammation in the body fast?\n\nInflammation doesn’t always need treatment. For acute inflammation, you can usually relieve discomfort in a few days by:\n\nResting that part of your body.\n\nApplying ice or a cold pack to the affected area for 15-20 minutes every four hours or so.\n\nPracticing good wound care for any cuts, scrapes or burns.\n\nIf you have chronic inflammation, your provider may recommend:\n\nSupplements. Some supplements — like zinc, certain vitamins and omega-3 — may reduce inflammation and enhance repair. Always talk to your provider before taking any new supplements.\n\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These over-the-counter (OTC) medicines reduce inflammation. Your provider may recommend ibuprofen (Advil®), aspirin (Bayer®) or naproxen (Aleve®). Don’t take NSAIDs for more than 10 days in a row without talking to your provider.\n\nCorticosteroids. Your provider may give you an injection to decrease inflammation at a specific joint or muscle. Or they may prescribe medications you take by mouth. Be sure to follow your provider’s instructions on how to take your medication.\n\nIs prednisone used for inflammation?\n\nYes. Prednisone is a type of corticosteroid. Healthcare providers prescribe it to treat many conditions that cause inflammation, including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and vasculitis.\n\nWhat foods reduce inflammation?\n\nMany foods fight inflammation in your body. These include fatty fish (like salmon), fresh fruits and leafy greens, just to name a few. You may also use spices with anti-inflammatory properties, like turmeric, ginger or garlic.\n\nFollowing an anti-inflammatory diet can help reduce and prevent inflammation in your body. An anti-inflammatory diet is a general term that refers to a broad pattern of well-balanced eating. You choose some foods over others and adapt the diet to your needs.\n\nIf you want to make changes to your eating habits, it’s a good idea to talk to a dietitian. They can help you create a plan that’s best for you. They may recommend approaches like the Mediterranean Diet, which research shows can lower levels of inflammation in the body. Or, they might suggest the DASH Diet as a way to reduce your sodium intake and increase your potassium.\n\nA dietitian will work with you to craft a plan that’s doable in the long term.\n\nWhat are examples of foods that cause inflammation?\n\nWhile some foods help reduce inflammation, others do the opposite. Some inflammation-causing foods include:\n\nFoods containing trans fat.\n\nFried foods, including many fast food items.\n\nCured meats with nitrates, like hot dogs and some deli meats.\n\nFoods high in salt.\n\nRefined carbohydrates, like sugar, pastries or white bread.\n\nHow can I prevent inflammation?\n\nYou can’t modify many of the factors that cause inflammation. However, you may be able to lower your risk for chronic inflammation in some cases. Here are some things you can do:\n\nAim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity (like walking) per week.\n\nAvoid smoking and all tobacco products. Talk to your provider about resources to help you quit.\n\nEat mostly fresh or minimally processed foods and avoid highly processed foods.\n\nMaintain a weight that’s healthy for you.\n\nLimit how much alcohol you drink.\n\nTalk to your provider about ways to lower your risk of harmful effects from pollution or toxic chemicals."
