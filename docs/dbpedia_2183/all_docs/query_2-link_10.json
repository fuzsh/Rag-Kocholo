Any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, or another cereal grain is a grain product. Bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, grits, and tortillas are examples of grain products. Foods such as popcorn, rice, and oatmeal are also included in the MyPlate Grains Group. Grains are divided into 2 subgroups: Whole Grains and Refined Grains.",

        "text": "Make half your grains whole grains.\n\nWhat foods are in the Grains Group?\n\nFoods made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, or another cereal grain is a grain product. Bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, grits, and tortillas are examples of grain products. Foods such as popcorn, rice, and oatmeal are also included in the Grains Group.\n\nGrains have two subgroups: whole grains and refined grains.\n\nWhole grains have the entire grain kernel, which includes the bran, germ, and endosperm. Some whole-grain examples are whole-wheat flour, bulgur (cracked wheat), oatmeal, and brown rice.\n\nRefined grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to give grains a finer texture and improve their shelf life. But it also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B vitamins. Some examples of refined grain products are white flour, corn grits, white bread, and white rice.\n\nRefined grains should be enriched. This means adding back certain B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic acid) and iron. However, fiber is not added back to enriched grains. Check the ingredient list on refined grain products. The word \"enriched\" should appear in the grain name.\n\nSome food products are made from mixtures of whole grains and refined grains. Only foods that are made with 100% whole grains are considered a whole grain food.\n\nHow many grain foods are needed daily?\n\nThe amount of grains you need to eat depends on your age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity. Your amount can also depend on whether you are pregnant or breastfeeding/ lactating.\n\nMost people living in the United States eat enough total grain foods. However, the balance is off – many eat too much refined grains and not enough whole grains. At least half of the grains we eat should be whole grains. When reading food labels, look for the words “whole grain” in the ingredient list. When choosing what grains to eat it is also important to limit added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat by checking the Nutrition Facts label and ingredient list on the package.\n\nFind the right amount of whole grains for you by getting your MyPlate Plan. For general recommendations, see the table below.\n\nWhat counts as an ounce-equivalent (oz-equiv) of grains?\n\nThe following are some grain food portions that are equal to one ounce:\n\n1 slice of bread\n\n1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal\n\n½ cup of cooked rice, cooked pasta, or cooked cereal\n\nThe table below lists specific amounts that count as 1 ounce-equivalent of grains.\n\nWhy is it important to eat grains, especially whole grains?\n\nEating grains, especially whole grains, can provide health benefits. People who regularly eat grains that are low in added sugars, sodium, and saturated fats as part of an overall healthy diet may have a reduced risk of some diseases. Grains provide many nutrients that are vital for the health and maintenance of our bodies.\n\nFood Group Gallery\n\nDo you want to know more about the foods in the Grains Group?
