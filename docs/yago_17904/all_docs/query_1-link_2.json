        "text": "Maxim goes from carefree youth to St Petersburg Bolshevik.\n\nI find the moments in these propaganda films when the people are idealizing “the cause” staring off into space like drugged cult members very creepy. I found this film a bit on the... shall we say... less significant side? It’s a boy who discovers his love of being part of the state and its all a bit much. I enjoyed the moments when he was singing and playing the guitar and just being a person rather than being a tool for whatever the cause is.\n\nAs is the case with a lot of soviet propaganda movies, I had expected a somewhat weak storyline. What I hadn’t expected though was such a high-calibre of acting, and aesthetic beauty that is - at times - greater than that of Eisenstein’s masterpieces.\n\nMAXIM’S YOUTH (Kozintsev, USSR, 1935, 5)\n\nShostakovich’s music sizzles, as Bolshie propaganda takes the form of traditional Russian peasant airs. But as the earliest Soviet sound film I’ve seen, its interest is purely historical and critical. It’s a Bolshevik Bildungsroman as a worker becomes radicalized. But compare the Odessa Steps sequence in POTEMKIN with the structurally and dramatically identical scene here ... a worker’s funeral becomes a political rally becomes a police raid ... and it’s very easy to see why so many 1930s film theorists and critics thought talkies the Death of Cinema. The imposed realism, combined with the crude sound reproduction, makes the whole sequence feel second-rate. And sound definitely makes the speechifying come off badly now even though this is a film with title cards. In that and other ways, including the morality-play melodrama, it feels very much like one of those hybrid films Hollywood was making in 1928-30, and it stands up about as well.\n\nThere's a story about the first time Stalin watched it and once he had finished, he asked one of his ministers about his opinion and he replied : \" when we made revolution we didn't play guitar .\" As a reference to one of the scenes in the movie... That moment the director's face was undescribable and he felt down.\n\nKnowing this funny story while watching the movie made it more valuable , cause directors at that time were not only sacrificing their careers but also their lives ...and this is the charm of the 7th art...♡\n\nJust like the communist party, the film is primarily held up by the people working in it. At it's core it's a character driven drama with grand emotional depth.\n\nOverall, the bourgeois street drunkard had the best character development don't @me."
