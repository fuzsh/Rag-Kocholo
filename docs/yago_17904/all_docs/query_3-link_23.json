        "text": "I have this romanticized view of the Paris Commune of 1871 that I keep around in my head. It might be one of the most inspiring moments of history that I know anything about. I will naturally embrace any film with a positive portrayal of it, and this film exceeded my expectations. I can't help compare it to La Commune (Paris 1871), which was, because it had the luxury of time, much more detailed. Both were somewhat experimental, and the latter film hewed closer to the facts. New Babylon finds time for a love story within its commentary, using almost archetypal characters at times.\n\nIt is notable for featuring a story that does not relegate its female lead to a…\n\nWhat a powerful, throughout cinematic experience! Idea, dream, comes alive on the only possible screen that can turn it into some sense. The film feels structurally like a musical; from grotesque shopping sequence to similarly over-the-top bar scene and all the way to ending drinkings, the bourgeoisie is described in the very Moulin Rouge sense. These are only one example of the film's musical ideas. Another scene would be the one where bourgeois starts singing ironically Le Marseillaise right before its armies are about to fill the commune in blood. Of course there's musical moments within the commune people as well: one would be without a doubt the piano moment at the end of the battles and one scene again…\n\nOperatic Impressions and Montage\n\nI caught this one before it expired on \"the silent stream\" section of Le Giornate del Cinema Muto website, where they temporarily revive past screenings from the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. Mark it down as one of the classics of Soviet montage and the late silent era. This version, by the way, is the 92-minutes restoration with the original score; reportedly, there's a longer cut that was discovered in Germany in the 1980s, but which co-director Leonid Trauberg disavowed as extra footage that they'd intentionally discarded and not censored material. Regardless, as it is, \"The New Babylon\" is a spectacular synthesis of Impressionistic images, rapid and rhythmic editing and a score by renowned composer Dmitri Shostakovich,…\n\n(The Soviet classics and obscurities marathon continues...)\n\nThe New Babylon sits squarely in the chronological middle of the 14 film collaborations of the directors Grigory Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg. For many, it's their greatest film together, though at this neophyte stage in my vintage Soviet movie viewing I can't make that assessment.\n\nIts fate has been somewhat similar to that of Abel Gance's Napoleon: cut heavily after its premiere and not shown for decades with the modernistic score intended for it, as written by Dmitri Shostakovich. The movie was partially reconstructed in the 1980s and then fleshed out again with more footage in 2006, with Shostakovich's orchestral score properly added. Praise for the movie has snowballed in the last couple…"
