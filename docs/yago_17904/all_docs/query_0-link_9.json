        "text": "The realistic style of Russian cinematography finds a striking and powerful expression in \"The Youth of Maxim,\" the new Muscovite screen drama at the Cameo Theatre. Together with \"Chapayev\" ??? the as yet unreleased \"Peas???\" this document of revolutionary stirrings in Czarist Russia won first prize for the Leningrad Studios at the recent festival in Moscow which celebrated the fifteenth anniversary of the Soviet cinema. In its original form \"The Youth of Maxim\" impressed this alien reporter as somewhat too diffuse for complete comfort. For its presentation at the Cameo the management has wisely cut the film so as to give it a greater speed and directness. Thus that deliberate and tedious narrative style which is the chief defect of Russian films according to American standards has been improved, enabling us to savor all the brilliant qualities of the Russian screen at its best.\"The Youth of Maxim\" is the first part of a trilogy which will form a documentary history of the development of a typical Russian youth through the years of oppression and the rise of the modern proletarian State down to our own times. It begins by immersing the carefree Maxim in the insufferable truths of the worker's condition at that period and abandons him at the point where he is imbued with the doctrines of the underground Social Democrat movement. During Maxim's progress from peasant ignorance to social consciousness, one of his friends is killed in a factory accident which results from the superintendent's callous refusal to inspect the machinery. The second member of the happy trio, arrested with Maxim in a street brawl which occurs when the angry workers defy the police, dies before a firing squad. Maxim himself emerges from prison with that utter hopelessness which Dostoievsky describes in his \"House of the Dead.\"Peopled with authentic characters and dramatized with that superb sense of humanity which identifies the Muscovite cinema, the photoplay achieves an almost terrifying reality. The street riot is developed with a deliberate air which makes for both suspense and excitement and brings the spectator finally into active emotional participation in the battle between the troops and the unarmed laborers. There is a similar mastery of mass movement in the raid of the secret police upon the party meeting in the forest near the end of the film. The rich humor of the Russians is in evidence throughout, rising naturally out of the remarkable sense for individual characterization which is one of the film's distinguishing merits.The performances are flawless, not only in the principal parts but among the anonymous workers who win only a casual glance from the camera. Boris Chirkov, who plays the title r√¥le, you may recall for his acting in \"Chapayev.\" Stepan Kayukov is completely winning as the good-natured peasant who stumbles bewilderedly to his execution without understanding how or why. There should be a word, too, for the pig-eyed overseer of the factory, a splendid bit of acting.\n\nTHE YOUTH OF MAXIM, written and directed by Gregory Kozintzev and Leonid Trauberg; music by Dmitri Shostakovitch; produced by Lenfilm; released by Amkino.
