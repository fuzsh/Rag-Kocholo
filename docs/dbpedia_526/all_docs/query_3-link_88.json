        "text": "The head-type station plan, in which all passengers entered and left through the head-building across the end of the lines, proved to be the most long- lived scheme for terminals. Numerically important even in the experimental period, they were of continuing significance. A single building was erected across the ends of the tracks with platforms lying between the tracks and perpendicular to the building. This was the plan of the Brighton Station by David Mocatta, 1840-41. At York in 1840-41 a \"U\" or \"stirrup\" plan was employed with wings extending back from the head building to surround the end of the spur tracks on three sides. Other variations occurred, even in large stations: \"L's,\" for example, and a \"T\" plan at Stuttgart in 1863-68, where the returned wing lies between two sets of spur tracks.\n\nTwo British stations . . . made the shed the dominant feature. The first was the Liverpool Central Station built by the engineer John Fowler in 1874, and the second was the Manchester Joint Central Station, begun two years later. Both sheds were arched, and without visible ties. They are striking examples of refined technology. The profiles are reversed catenaries in shape, exceedingly subtle and worthy of their prominent role on the exterior. The high sheds reduce the wings and marquees to inconsequence, thereby reminding us of the earlier Fenchurch Street Station in London and of the numerous American arched train-barns. Coming so long after the Crystal Palace, they can hardly be considered an example of its influence, though they represent the lesson which might have been learned from it. â Carol Meeks, pp, 33, 86.\n\nMixing Iron and Stone\n\nIntroduction: A Selection of Great Victorian Railway Stations\n\nThe Crown Street station of Liverpool and Manchester Railway, 1830\n\nWylam Station, Northumberland, 1835\n\nDoric Arch, Euston Station, London and Birmingham Railway, 1839\n\nRailway Station, Brighton, 1841\n\nGreat Joint Station of the Croydon, Brighton, and Dover Railway Company, Southwark, 1843\n\nRailway Station, Bradford-on-Avon, 1848\n\nNeedham-Market Station on the Norwich and Ipswitch Railway, 1849\n\nWindsor & Eton Riverside Station, Datchet Road, Windsor, 1849\n\nLime Street Station, Liverpool, 1849\n\nKing's Cross Station, Great Northern Railway, 1852\n\nCentral Station, Newcastle, 1853 â \"the first covered station in the world\"\n\nThe Great Western Railway Terminus, at Paddington, 1854\n\nCrystal Palace Station, London, 1854\n\nPlatforms, Durham, 1857\n\nThe Metropolitan Railway, London, 1862\n\nThe Ludgate Hill Station of the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, 1865\n\nThe High-Level Station at the Crystal Palace, 1865\n\nCannon-street Station, South-Eastern Railway, 1866\n\nTrainshed beams, St, Pancras, London, 1868-77\n\nSt. Pancras, London (sitemap : two dozen photographs), 1868-77\n\nThe Juxtaposition of Engineering and Architectural Elements in the Trainshed, St. Pancras, London, 1868-77\n\nStation wall with beams supporting the train shed, St. Pancras, London, 1868-77\n\nKew Gardens Station, 1868-70\n\nWaterloo Station interior, 1869, 1878, 1885; rebuilt between 1900 and 1922\n\nLiverpool Street Station, 1874\n\nDerby Gothic on the Settle-Carlisle Railway, 1876\n\nSouth Kensington Station, Metropolitan and District Railways, London\n\nTynemouth Station, 1882\n\nLiverpool Street Station, London, 1884\n\nNorwich Station, 1886\n\nSheringham Station, Norfolk, 1887\n\nEastbourne Station, Sussex, 1886\n\nHigh Street Kensington Station, Metropolitan and District Railways, London\n\nLancaster Station: iron beams, glass panels and stone supports\n\nSuburban Station on the South Eastern Railway, 1885\n\nLlandudno Railway Station, North Wales, 1892\n\nWindsor & Eton Central Station, George Road, Windsor, 1897\n\nThe Marylebone Street Station (Great Central Railway), London, 1899\n\nFormer Metropolitan Railway entrance (near Liverpool Street Station)\n\nThe Midland Railway Station, Sheffield (1905 with elements from 1870)\n\nBarons Court Station on the District Line (formerly District Railway), London, 1905.\n\nVictoria Station, eastern side (the former London, Chatham and Dover Railway Station frontage), c. 1908-1910\n\nPort Erin, Isle of Man Railway\n\nHuddersfield Station, West Yorkshire, 1850\n\n(Former) Pocklington Station, Yorkshire\n\nFirst stone station, York, 1841\n\nOld station outbuildings, York\n\nYork Station, 1877\n\nTrainshed at York Station, 1877\n\nStations in Former British Colonies\n\nFormer Victoria Terminus, Mumbai\n\nFormer Churchgate Terminus, Mumbai\n\nFor Comparison: European Railway Stations\n\nGare d'Orsay, Paris (now converted to the Musée d'Orsay)\n\nCentral Station, Porto, Portugal [will open in new window]\n\nSNCF Station in Roubaix (Greater Lille area)\n\nSNCF Station, Lille Flanders\n\nGare de Rouen-Rive-Droite, Rouen, France\n\nEliel Saarinen's Central Station, Helsinki, Finland\n\nCentral Station, Amsterdam, the Netherlands\n\nRelated Material\n\nVictorian Railway Bridges and Viaducts\n\nSignal Box, Lewes and Uckfield Railway, Station, East Sussex\n\nBibliography\n\nCrook, J.
