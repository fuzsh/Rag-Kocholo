With that in mind, the organisers are encouraging alternative forms of transport to cars. It is an ideal opportunity to travel by train to the venue.\n\nTide Mills is a short – and scenic – walk from Bishopstone railway station and a slightly longer walk from Newhaven Town/Newhaven Harbour stations.\n\n– Words and photos by Paul Bromley, Community Rail Officer, Seaford to Brighton Line"
