        "text": "This is my Grandfather on my mother's side, Harold Victor Mason\n\nwith a very large flatfish he caught in Newhaven Harbour c1950\n\nHe was known to most as 'Billie' a name given to him by his friend Rudyard Kipling who thought him, his diminutive size and his\n\nstory of being lost in a far away land, was like that of the character Billie Fish in Kipling's tale ' The man who would be King.'\n\nDuring WWII he was stationed in Africa and spent 2 years with an\n\nindigenous group of nomadic Pigmies who taught him to hunt, forage and be part of nature responsibly and sustainably.\n\nThereafter he always wore a suit and tie when fishing to remind himself to be as respectful as possible when taking the life of\n\nanother creature in order to feed himself and his family.\n\nWhen I was just 10 yrs old Grandad woke me very early one morning to go look for a legendary Pike with sharp pointy teeth that lived in the stream beyond the woods, across the sugar beet field, at the back of his house in Bognor Regis.\n\nWhat I was about to experience was completely new to me, another world that I had no idea existed, it changed my life and made me who I am today.\n\n​\n\nI dressed as fast as I could and we passed through the back door and into the 4am darkness of a summer's dawn. The air was heavy with scents of damp earth, wet grass and honeysuckle blossom; and all enveloped by a cathedral of bird song.\n\n\"Talk if you must\" he said. \"but in a whisper or you'll l break the spell that is the magic hour.\"\n\nI stood speechless for a moment.\n\n\"Don't just listen to things, 'hear' them and don't just look at things, 'see' them\" he said.\n\nThose words were etched into my mind.\n\n​\n\nWe crossed the field towards the trees under a dark royal blue star studded sky.\n\nThe woodland floor was almost the same! A carpet of Bluebells studded with white wood anemones. \"Roll your feet gently as you walk so as not to make a sound\" he said;\n\n\"Slowly slowly, catch ye monkey\"\n\n​\n\nThe sky had lightened a little and my eyes adjusted as we reached the far side of the wood.\n\nOut in the water meadow yet another fantastic scene. A sea of ground mist, purply pink from the coming sunrise. Cows, seemingly with no legs, 'floating' on the mist. The moment is still hard to describe but at the time I said it all by just facial expression to Grandad, those same facial expressions he later taught me to use if I wanted to stop a Fox in it's tracks for a while.\n\nHe paused, then nodded for me to look to my left, a fence post not ten feet away, it had eyes!\n\nA fabulous barn owl sat there, almost a part of the sun bleached wood, it's eyes staring straight into my brain. It turned, leaned forward and dropped, with wings open, into the pink 'sea' and outward, the tips of its wings flicking up little spirals of the mist. My life was changed forever.\n\nWe never did see the giant Pike but I think that might just have been a trick\n\nto lure that little boy me, out of my bed."
