        "text": "Sussex is renowned across the country for many things that define its character.\n\nWhether that's the rolling hills of the South Downs, the alluring woodlands of the High Weald, or the vibrant culture exhibited by our coastal towns.\n\nBut one thing Sussex lacks, unlike its neighbours, is a major port town.\n\nThe economies in our neighbouring counties of Kent and Hampshire have been reliant throughout history on Britain's maritime success.\n\nPortsmouth, Southampton and Chatham have proved to be vital ports through their use by the Royal Navy and major industry, while Dover and Folkestone act as important transport hubs connecting the UK to continental Europe.\n\nBut thus far this reputation has alluded Sussex.\n\nHowever it was not always destined to be this way.\n\nNewhaven is Sussex's closest version to these great ports - and at one point in it was arguably the most important port in Britain.\n\nAlthough it is suffering under the substantial restrictions brought in to curb the impact of coronavirus, the port town remains as the county's key maritime transport hub.\n\nThere are some signs of the port's decreasing importance with a number of derelict facilities situated in the port that serviced former train ferry operations.\n\nInternational ferries still run to the French port of Dieppe, with freight and passenger movements usually occurring twice a day - once in the morning and in the evening.\n\nDespite this, the port has a fascinating history that has played its part in shaping Britain into what it is today.\n\nHistory\n\nUntil the opening of the railway line to Lewes in 1847 the village was of little maritime importance.\n\nIt was at this point when its potential was starting to be recognised that the exiled French King Louis Philippe I landed in disguise at the port's docks after fleeing in the midst of the 1848 French Revolution.\n\nFrom this point onwards the port began to thrive.\n\nThe London, Brighton and South Coast Railway company constructed their own wharf and facilities on the east side of the River Ouse, and opened Newhaven Harbour railway station.\n\nThis led to funding being obtained for the improvements of the port to enable it to be used by cross channel ferries.\n\nIn 1863 the Newhaven-Dieppe passenger service was launched between the two seaside towns, and the harbour was eventually recognised as 'The Port of Newhaven' 19 years later in 1882.\n\nMajor French imports to pass through the docks were farm products, timber, granite and slates.\n\nThe onset of the First World War saw the town reach its peak significance.\n\nIt was designated as the principal port for the movement of men and materiel to the European continent during World War I and was taken over by the military authorities and the ferries requisitioned for the duration of the war.\n\nThis resulted in the port being closed to the public as the port and town was made a 'Special Military Area' under the 'Defence of the Realm Regulations'.\n\nNewhaven's port and harbour facilities, rail sidings and warehousing saw even greater expansion during this period with electric lighting installed to enable 24-hour operation.\n\nThe major operation ended after Germany surrendered in November 1918, but its military significance reemerged during the Second World War.\n\nLarge numbers of Canadian troops were stationed in Newhaven throughout the conflict, and the failed Dieppe raid in 1942 was mainly launched from the harbour."
