        "text": "On the 19th May 2013 a plaque was unveiled in Newhaven on the anniversary of Ho Chi Minh’s birth in 1890. The plaque was gifted by the Vietnamese embassy in London to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his time working in the kitchens on the Dieppe-Newhaven ferry. The memorial is sited close to Newhaven Marina (formerly Sleepers Hole) on Riverside, a pedestrian way which runs along the West Quay side of Newhaven Harbour. Intriguingly it is placed not far away from constituency office of the local Conservative MP, Maria Caulfield.\n\nWhile it is not suggested that you are necessarily an admirer of Ho Chi Minh, you might be intrigued enough to make a little detour to look at this curiosity. Newhaven does have enough interest to merit at least one visit in your life which does not involve getting on or off a car ferry.\n\nThere are several options to the approach to the memorial including:\n\nThe Ouse Valley Way crosses the Ouse via the swing bridge over the river at Newhaven. There is a turning off the one-way system into Riverside immediately you come off the bridge coming from Denton and Seaford. You could walk/run down the Ouse on the western bank from Lewes along the Ouse Valley Way. http://www2.westsussex.gov.uk/leisureandtourism/prow/pdfs/OuseValleyWay.pdf\n\nThe Vanguard Way which goes from Newhaven to East Croydon starts or finishes, depending on your point of view, at Newhaven Harbour railway station. You may think that this is a rather eccentric suggestion, but the stage from Seaford across the Tide Mills area makes an interesting approach to Newhaven. [Currently, i.e. October 2020, the path is redirected so perhaps this is something for the future] http://www.vanguardway.org.uk/ ]\n\nThe Seahaven Coastal Way between Saltdean and Exceat goes straight past the Ho Chi Minh commemorative plaque. https://www.seahavencoastaltrail.org.uk/maps.cfm The walk described in this post is effectively a part of this route.\n\nGetting a train to Newhaven Town, or driving and parking at the carpark just before the Riverside becomes a pedestrian way. This is round the back of Bickerstaff’s if you fancy some fish. http://www.riverside-lewes.co.uk/riverside-shops/bickerstaffs/ . For the literary-minded Ian Marchant’s Parallel Lines or journeys on the railway of dreams or Every girl’s big book of trains (Bloomsbury 2003) is recommended preparation for the railway experience.\n\nNewhaven\n\nThree physical things have influenced the Newhaven. One is Castle Hill, the substantial hill close to the sea which has had inhabitants since the stone ages. Then there is the mouth of the river Ouse which was finally stabilised in 1539 near the village of Meeching. This created the makings of a harbour and Meeching gave itself a new name, Newhaven. Finally there is crossing place over the river allowing communications along the coast, which originally was a ferry, and from 1784 a bridge.\n\nThe Walk\n\nThis walk took place on Friday 9th September 2020 which was a thankfully sunny. It was a day when I had planned to be setting off on the Newhaven-Dieppe car ferry for a holiday in the Loire region of France. But Covid-19 restrictions put a stop to that, so I went for a stroll with some of my former work colleagues to have a look at the Ho Chi Minh plaque. This was a subset of the group who embarked on the Shoreham Beach jaunt in August.\n\n1. Newhaven Town railway station\n\nJoe and I arrived by train. Joe travelled from Burgess Hill. I got on at Lewes. The railway line we travelled on had reached Newhaven via Lewes in 1847, care of the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR).\n\nNewhaven was – and still is – one of only two substantial harbours on this part of the south coast. The other was, of course, Shoreham. It was also the means by which Lewes could be reached by water. Engineering projects, the most important of which were commenced 1791, effectively canalised the Ouse. In 1835 John Elland junior – the son of the great agricultural genius – wrote that the improvements had cut the journey time between Newhaven and Lewes from 2-4 days to the same number of hours. Vessels used to need strong able bargemen, but now lads of 16-18 year could now guide them.\n\nThe railway link broadened the reach of Newhaven as a port, as beyond Lewes was a railway network giving access to London and beyond. The Newhaven-Dieppe crossing was longer than Dover-Calais, but Newhaven was closer to London, and once in France the passengers were closer to Paris. Important developments in the 1860s cost over half a million pounds. The harbour was deepened and the moles at harbour mouth were strengthened. Crossings were no longer affected by tides and times of connecting trainst could be fixed. The London and Paris Hotel was built close to the current Newhaven Harbour station. Like much else it is no longer there.\n\n2. Newhaven Bridge.\n\nHaving verified that our two other walking companions were to be collected near the carpark behind Bickerstaff’s. Joe and I turned left outside the station, crossed over the feeder road to the Newhaven-Dieppe Ferry and crossed the bridge to the west bank. I reflected that by rights I should have already have driven down to the ferry approach and should have been actually on the ferry. Covid-19 is just a more vicious version of Brexit – discuss.\n\nThe first bridge built in 1784 was replaced by an iron swing bridge in 1866. This survived until it was replaced by the current bridge in 1974.\n\nIn 1848, less three months after the railway was completed, it had the patronage of the exiled King Louis-Philippe, the ruler of France since 1830 until there was a revolutionary uprising. Fearing for his life he left Le Havre on the English steamship Empress and arrived at Newhaven on 2nd of March. One of his aides, General Dumas, rowed ashore and booked accommodation for ‘Mr Smith’ at the Bridge Inn. The Bridge Inn building still exists and is currently owned by Harveys Brewery who have been carrying out extensive restoration work. Fingers are crossed that it opens again as a pub.\n\nPicture above by Andrew Gilbert taken in 2008 from Our Newhaven website www.ournewhaven.org.uk/page/the_bridge_hotel\n\nThe royal party then disembarked at Sleepers Bottom, which is the old name for the bay-like feature on the west side of the harbour, very near to today’s Ho Chi Minh memorial. They would have proceeded along the west side of the harbour, the route that we will shortly be taking ( but in the opposite direction). They stayed overnight at the Bridge Hotel as it was called in those days.\n\nThey were supposed to be incognito, but news got out and they were soon surrounded by a welcoming crowd of locals. The next day they got on a specially chartered royal train that took them to East Croydon. They were cheered by crowds of locals in Newhaven and then again when the train stopped at Lewes.\n\nMeanwhile Louis-Napoleon who had taken refuge in England in 1846, was going in the opposite direction back to France. He was elected President, and then declared himself Emperor Napoleon III in 1851. When he had to flee France after the unsuccessful Franco-Prussian War he was back in England. His son died fighting in the British army in Africa. Making England a second home is at odds with his being the bogey-man who caused the building of the Palmerston forts such as Newhaven’s.\n\n3. The Riverside\n\nJoe and I admired the view from the bridge. Our eyes were caught by the sculpture of a cormorant fastened to a stake in the Ouse which at first you think is the real thing – more about this later. We then crossed the bridge and turned left on the other side and went down Riverside North and passed the Ark public house.\n\nWe did not look at this, but opposite the turning off to Riverside North there is a turning along Bridge Street, which if you are walking can be reached via a pedestrian crossing. Here there is a modest memorial garden. In addition to a memorial for the 210 Newhaven folk who gave their lives in the two world wars is a memorial, originally erected in 1920, to the 99 Newhaven-based merchant seamen killed in the First World War. There is also a memorial to the 27 Royal Canadian Engineers who lost their lives in the Dieppe Raid of August 1942. Overall, out of a force of around 5000, 907 Canadians were killed and 2460 wounded during the raid. Ian Marchant in Parallel Lines recalls his stepfather describing how, aged seventeen, he watched from the bridge as hundreds of dead Canadian soldiers were unloaded from barges and put on trains at Newhaven Harbour station.\n\nWe met up with Richard and David, who had already bought some fresh fish from Bickerstaff’s.\n\nThe trail now went southwards alongside the harbour. While the main train-line approached Newhaven on the eastern side of the Ouse, a tramway was built along the West Quay where we were now walking. It is unclear whether this carried any passengers. Its main roles were to carry the materials needed to build the West Mole, and to take away the products of the Meeching Quarry.\n\nPhoto: Anthony McIntosh www.publicsculpturesofsussex.co.uk . I recall looking at terrace houses in the background in Chapel Street and thinking you could be happy living there.\n\nThe start of the semi-pedestrianised way was marked by another statue of a cormorant. This was created by the splendidly-named Christian Funnell and in keeping with the royal theme a plaque says it was unveiled by the Duke of Kent on the occasion of his visit to Newhaven in 2003. Funnell originally made a cormorant from old tyres on a steel frame and with the help of his friend the local river pilot sited it in the harbour. He might have got himself into trouble as he did not have permission. However, the council decided they actually liked it so much they commissioned a second cormorant that we can now see on West Quay. The cormorant now seems to have been adopted as a Newhaven symbol and can be seen in other places in the town.\n\n4. West Quay\n\nWe continued along the quay where vehicles belonging to fishing boats are allowed access. Most of the moorings were empty: perhaps the boats were at sea.\n\nThe Society’s premises were further down Riverside.\n\nAccording to the Newhaven Port Authority 30 registered operational smaller fishing boats have moorings at West Quay. Most belong to the Newhaven (Sussex) Fish and Flake Ice Society. This has supplies services such as fueling. It has the capacity to generate up to 10 tonnes of ice a day.\n\nOne prominent building was Malpass Markets. As a passing local pointed out the decorative tiles on the building’ exterior give a clear impression this was another outlet for fish, but in fact it is part of the Malpass butchery empire.\n\n5. Lifeboat Station\n\nWe now passed the Newhaven lifeboat station. As the website says: Established in 1803, Newhaven Lifeboat Station covers from Beachy Head to Brighton. It’s a modern afloat station and operates an all-weather Severn class lifeboat. The crews have been awarded 19 medals for gallantry.\n\nThe Newhaven lifeboat actually predates the founding of the RNLI in 1824.\n\nIn 1800, during the wars with France, an 18 gun sloop of war HMS Brazen was wrecked beneath the cliffs of Newhaven. HMS Brazen had originally been a French Privateer called Invincible Generale Buonaparte – that name again – which was captured and repurposed by the Royal Navy. It was on duty in the Channel against preying French privateers whose presence was the preventing the Newhaven fishing fleet setting out to sea.\n\n105 men lost their lives. Local people found 95 bodies on the shore over several days. The bodies were buried in the graveyard of the local church, St Michael.\n\nOnly one man, Jeremiah Hill, survived. He was was taken from the sea and winched up the cliffs by two brave local men improvising with a wheeled crane from a nearby farm. The weather was so atrocious that further attempts to reach the men in the water failed even though figures could still be seen clinging to the ship’s upturned hull.sh\n\nThis tragedy inspired a local committee to look into the provision of a lifeboat at Newhaven. In May 1803 a lifeboat was acquired, partly paid for by Lloyds of London and partly by money raised locally. This was 21 years before the formation of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in 1824.\n\nPhoto: David Hawgood / Newhaven lifeboat / CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n6. Sleepers Hole and Ho Chi Minh memorial\n\nJust past the RNLI shop, the walkway opened out into a space that overlooked Newhaven Marina. On the right was a row of commercial properties with the collective name of Villandry. One of them was the constituency office of Mrs Maria Caulfield, the local Conservative MP.\n\nPart of the promenade protrudes into the harbour. The area now occupied by the marina was formerly known as ‘Sleepers Hole’ – where Louis Philippe landed. The name comes (for Sleepers Hole not LP) from it being the place where wooden sleepers for railways and dock infrastructure were soaked in sea water to remove sap as part of the seasoning process.\n\nAs well as the Newhaven-Dieppe gig, he claimed to have lived in Ealing where he worked at the Drayton Court Hotel and later in Crouch End. This blog’s opinion is that these claims have the ring of truth. There is documentary evidence of his time in Britain and it is difficult to see why he would want to lie about these details of a modestly lived early life. (The claim that he was trained as a pastry chef by Escoffier at the Carlton Hotel is a different matter).\n\nAnd so it was that on the 19th May 2013 a plaque was unveiled in Newhaven on the anniversary of Ho Chi Minh’s birth in 1890. The plaque was gifted by the Vietnamese embassy in London to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his time working in the kitchens on the Dieppe-Newhaven ferry. We have already noted the opposition of Mrs Caulfield MP to this gesture, but Newhaven Town Council which is overwhelmingly Liberal Democrat went ahead anyway.\n\nThere has not been, to my knowledge, in any campaign for a plaque commemorating first day of exile of the last king of France.\n\nThe Riverside pedestrian way merged with the West Quay road which is flanked by recently developed residential properties – this part of Newhaven is being gentrified – and a row of shops which is home the local Conservative MPs constituency office.\n\nThe block is named ‘Villandry’ which one of our number was adamant should be ‘Villainy’. In any case why this commercial property should be named after a chateau on the Loire with a wonderful garden is a mystery.\n\nThe other units were a café, a convenience store, a shop selling skate and surf boards and an Italian restaurant, Lina Rossa. We sat outside the Lina Rossa in the September sunshine having chosen from an array of coffees, paid for by Joe whose birthday it was. After we had our coffee, David C made his excuses.\n\n7. Fort Road and Fort Newhaven\n\nThe rest of us proceeded along Fort Road towards the aforesaid fort.\n\nOn our right was the main Newhaven recreation ground, home to Newhaven FC (‘The Dockers’), Newhaven Tennis Club, the Scouts and much else, including a Public Convenience with the sign ‘Last public toilets before France’. Some of us took advantage of the facility.\n\nWe pressed on until we came to the pedestrian route up to Newhaven Fort. We ascended.\n\nWhen we got to the top we looked back and saw a panoramic view of the harbour. Castle Hill dominates the sea and also the land around, and seems always to have been a place for some kind of defensible structure. There was a fort there in the Iron Age. Its importance was increased by the stabilisation of the mouth of the Ouse. There was now a harbour to defend. Whenever there was an external threat (as in 1585, 1596, 1759 and during the Napoleonic wars), artillery would be hauled up there.\n\nNewhaven Fort is said to be ‘the largest work of defence ever built in Sussex’. As we saw on Shoreham Beach, Louis-Napoleon, who had been exiled in England, returned in 1848. By 1851, he was Emperor Napoleon III. Lord Palmerston decided that the Emperor posed a threat to Britain and initiated the building of a chain of fortifications along the South coast. This included Newhaven Fort. Its design commenced in 1862 under the leadership of the twenty-two year old Lieutenant John Charles Ardagh. (You might want to look him up on Wikipedia to see his lifetime record of service to the British Empire. He and Ho Chi Minh were part of two different global systems that were in mortal combat).\n\nHis design of the fort was innovative as it exploited the contours of the site, rather than being built on a levelled base. It was also the first military fortification to use concrete.\n\nPhoto:Richard Griffiths\n\nThe Great War saw reinforcement and re-equipment, but it was in the Second World War that the challenges were greatest. In response gunnery to deter E-boats and three gun emplacements outside the fort were installed.\n\nBecause of Covid-19 were unable to go into the Fort- which was a real shame – but we were able make a detour around the fort onto the top of the cliffs.\n\n8. Castle Hill\n\nWe were now in the Castle Hill Nature Reserve, a 16.4 hectare area managed by Lewes District Council. It is crisscrossed by footpaths. On top of the cliffs the grass is short thanks to the grazing of rabbits – it would be too dangerous for sheep. The LDC website says this allows carpets of carpets of yellow Birds-foot-trefoil and pink Thrift to bloom. Behind the cliffs the hill slopes down towards the north and are covered gorse and scrub. Birds love this area, and if our bird-watching friend Brian had been with us he might have looked out for Lesser Whitethroats who have come all the way from Africa where they over-winter.\n\nThe route we took followed Seahaven Coastal Path. https://www.seahavencoastaltrail.org.uk/maps.cfm\n\nFrom the top of the cliffs is a view of the entry to the harbour. On the west side is an extensive breakwater that you used to be able to walk along. These is also a sandy beach, created over the decades by the existence of the breakwater (or mole), that one is no longer allowed to go on.\n\nThe breakwater and beach belong to the Newhaven Port & Property (NPP) a UK registered company owned by the French Seine-Maritime local authority . There is irony in the port of Newhaven being bought the French as the result of a money transaction after centuries of conflict – basically it seems because no-one in Britain cared about Newhaven. In 2008 they closed access to the beach and the breakwater for safety reasons, much to the anger of the locals, many of whom had happy childhood memories of days on the beach (as immortalized by Wreckless Eric in ‘Lureland’ – thanks for that, Spence).\n\nWhen we were there was a massive platform in the bay formed by the western breakwater. This was a jack-up rig (probably WaveWalker 1) which is a general purpose structure that can be towed out to a location and then lowered on its stilts to create a platform for engineering tasks such as the maintenance of off-shore wind turbines.\n\nBefore we had gone far, we came across the remains of the three gun emplacements completed by 1941 which had housed BL 6-inch Mk 24 coastal guns. Somewhere near there would have been the entrance to an underground tunnel which connected the battery to the fort.\n\nA look-out post had been built on top of one of the gun emplacements. The station is staffed by volunteers belonging to the National Coastwatch Institution (NCI). This should not be confused with the HM Coastguard. The NCI was formed to continue watching areas of the sea after the withdrawal of manned coastguard stations in many parts of the country. NCI coast watchers can act as ‘eyes along the coast’ but would pass on responsibility for taking action if needed to professionals.\n\nIt was here that our party paused to have their packed lunches. The September sun was shining, and the view was invigorating.\n\n9. Newhaven Heights\n\nWe then continued along the cliff-top path towards Peacehaven. There was another party of three going the same way. I spoke briefly to one of them, whose accent I thought was French but she turned out to be Hungarian. She and her two companions were coming back from a trip to Wales which they loved. I am always gratified when someone from overseas and seems to genuinely like something about us or our country.\n\nAt some point we had to turn around. The way back took us on a path that ran between the new estate of bungalows known as Newhaven Heights on the right and a more conventional estate of more substantial houses on the left in another estate based around Court Farm Road. The Newhaven Heights builds are designed for the over 50s. While the brochure talks about views of the channel, the housing, though physically near the cliffs, is on a north-facing slope down from the cliff-top. It may be a good thing to be sheltered from the prevailing winds. The bungalows seemed to be crammed in. As you get older you may want to avoid the demands of a large garden but could this proximity with your neighbours be uncomfortable? Rather strangely, the estate is made up of several roads all of which are called Newhaven Heights – which must make visiting friends and relations on the estate rather challenging the first time you go.\n\n10 Court Farm Road and the way back.\n\nThe passageway came out near the exit from Newhaven Heights into Court Farm Road and back towards West Quay. From here we walked back the way we had come from Bickerstaffe’s and beyond that Newhaven Town railway station.\n\nSome resources used\n\nButler, Chris.
