        "text": "Newhaven lies at the mouth of the River Ouse, in East Sussex in England. The town was formerly known as Meeching, but after the establishment of a harbour in medieavel times, the area became known as \"New Haven\", and \"Meeching\" gradually fell out of use. Newhaven continued as a small port town until the opening of the railway line to Lewes, in 1847. The railway company their own wharf and facilities by the river, and opened the Newhaven harbour railway station and funded improvements to the harbour that enabled it to be used by cross channel ferries. Newhaven launched it's Marconi Radio Station in 1904, achieving regular ship-to-shore radio communications by about 1912. The site of Newhaven Fort, on the cliffs overlooking Seaford Bay, has been used as a coastal defense since the Iron Age with more men and guns positioned there in times of national crisis such as the Spanish Armada and the Napoleonic Wars. Following a visit from the Duke of Wellington in 1855, and by the late 1850s Prime Minister Lord Palmerston, perceiving a threat of invasion by the French built seventy-two coastal forts, including the one at Newhaven. Today, Newhaven remains a lively seaside town, with great links from France to the South of England.\n\nTravelling to Newhaven Ferry Terminal\n\nNewhaven: Port Facilities\n\nThis information is provided for guidance only."
