        "text": "This year there will be no train services stopping at Lewes or any of the surrounding stations for the Lewes bonfire due to the strike. Apparently they are not stopping any trains there because of safety reasons and to prevent overcrowding. This event is one of the biggest bonfire events in the UK and attracts thousands of people every year. The whole town of Lewes is always absolutely packed. Every year most passengers visit by train so this will have a huge major impact.\n\nThere will be no trains (or rail replacement buses) calling at any of these stations from after 12:00 on 5/11/2016:\n\n Falmer\n\n Glynde\n\n Lewes\n\n London Road (Brighton)\n\n Moulsecoomb\n\n Southease\n\nThere will be no trains calling at any of these stations for the whole day on 5/11/2016:\n\n Ashurst\n\n Buxted\n\n Cooksbridge\n\n Cowden\n\n Crowborough\n\n Eridge\n\n Hever\n\n Plumpton\n\n Uckfield\n\nThere will be rail replacement bus services operating from Brighton non stop to all these four stations on 5/11/2016:\n\n Bishopstone\n\n Newhaven Harbour\n\n Newhaven Town\n\n Seaford\n\nThis will mean that the nearest stations for passengers travelling to and from the Lewes bonfire to use will be the following stations:\n\n Balcombe\n\n Berwick\n\n Brighton\n\n Burgess Hill\n\n Eastbourne\n\n Hampden Park\n\n Hassocks\n\n Haywards Heath\n\n Preston Park\n\n Wivelsfield\n\nAll of these stations will probably be guaranteed to be much busier than usual. Basically out of all of these the nearest station that will be open is Berwick which is likely to be extremely busy because of this. So this will probably be the largest amount of passengers that Berwick has ever seen.\n\nAlmost all of the roads around Lewes will be closed as well so people are likely to park far out of Lewes and walk in. Local bus services will still be running (except for Compass Bus who will finish running early) which are likely to be extremely busy and very overcrowded. Brighton & Hove (Go Ahead Group) will still be running the 28 / 29 / 29B / 29X / N29 services. Various other bus companies will be running shuttle services to and from various places in Sussex. Passengers may have a very long wait just to get on a bus.\n\nSo basically Lewes will be utter chaos this year.\n\nPersonally i think that this is very bad planning from Southern as usual. I am sure if they tried and could be bothered than they could find enough management Guards to operate a very frequent service (just like what normally happens every year) to and from Lewes.\n\nI don't think you'll see many, if any, additional people at Berwick. It is 8.2 miles from Lewes so a good 2 hour walk and almost exactly the same distance as Lewes is from Brighton station. Anyone with a car will be able to park much closer than 8 miles away.\n\nLikewise many of the rest in the list. It would, for example, be patently absurd to end up using Balcombe to walk to Lewes Bonfire (or even get a taxi or, and I shouldn't think there's anything handy, a bus).\n\nMy understanding is that the affected stations in the Lewes area will, where possible, be closed, locked and potentially guarded (by TOC employees, Land Sheriffs et al). Part of the concern is also that people may attempt to walk down the track, particularly from small/more remote stations, so securing access to the railway is also an issue here, rather than just crowd control at the stations themselves.\n\nI should think that the only open stations of any use to passengers in that list will be the ones with bus services running towards the general Lewes area. Even that, of course, is potentially an unreliable way to get there.\n\n(As a side note on such celebrations, I normally end up at local or family events around 5 November which generally take place some way away from Lewes, and I've never been to the 5 November celebrations there. However, I understand that the attitude that Lewes residents take is that they would all ideally prefer there only to be fairly local people there, and that customs dictate that the swathes of visitors from afar are sometimes unwelcome. I should imagine the rail situation this year has acted as a favourable tipping point in line with this sort of thing, and as a result people will be forced to turn to other events. Fortunately these are numerous across the South. If I had to recommend just one amongst them, I think it has to be Brockham, which will probably see at least a few ex-Lewes visitors this year, although it is a considerable way away; this is one of the only events I can think of which can cater for a huge number of people, and which welcomes any outside visitors too. Special buses will run which will connect with such trains as do operate from Redhill and Reigate, as well as a limited service or a longish walk from Dorking stations too.)\n\nOnce upon a time there used to be a special bonfire train service about every 10 minutes to and from Lewes and Brighton with other trains strengthened with some other extras on Haywards Heath Eastboure axis.\n\nThen there were complaints about over crowding in Lewes so the service was reduced to service trains only to reduce the visiting numbers. After that they started saying that they didn't want masses of spectators coming into the town so it stopped being overly promoted and now we have no trains and that's even wrong.\n\nLast year on the news they say that they only wanted the bonfire societies and locals at the event, but now they are worried that no one will turn up and thus lose charity money, you couldn't make it up. I think it's a little too easy to make the railway and unions the villains when they don't really know what numbers want to attend the event without overcrowding Lewes to the dangerous numbers of the past.\n\nI've attended Lewes Bonfire Celebrations many times over the years. I only live a few miles away and have many friends who live in the town, so I can usually stay over which removes the travel issue for me.\n\nThis idea that the celebrations are intended for \"The people of Lewes and surrounding Villages\" is a tricky one - yes, if only these people attended it would be more comfortable for everyone, but a number of charities rely on the street collections, obtained during the many processions for donations and obviously fewer people means less donations, so it has become a bit of a double edged sword.\n\nI have no idea what the answer is, but do admit something needed to be done. I was on the bridge outside of Harvey's brewery a couple of years ago and the number of people actually made it quite scary to move anywhere. I was getting crushed and pushed in one direction (whether I wanted to go there or not). I am a 6' tall bloke who doesn't usually get bothered by crowds. If something bad had happened or if the emergency services had needed to get to someone I dread to think what could have happened.\n\nA Lewes based friend of mine always wants it to rain on November 5th as this really helps to keep the crowds down!\n\nAs others have said there are plenty of other celebrations around Sussex on the 5th, so this year it may be worth going to another one for a change. I'm thinking of taking my kids up to Lindfield."
