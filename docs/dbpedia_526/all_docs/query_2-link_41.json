        "text": "A fault with the signalling system between Seaford and Lewes is causing disruption to trains between these stations. Trains may be delayed or cancelled until approximately 07:00.\n\nCustomer AdviceÂ\n\nTrain services are currently unable to run between Seaford and Lewes. Services due to run to and from Seaford at present will terminate and restart from Lewes.\n\nTrainsÂ are currently unable to serve Southease, Newhaven Town, Newhaven Harbour, Bishopstone and Seaford. If you are waiting at one of these stations please press the help point for alternative travel. If you are travelling to one of these stations please travel to Lewes and speak to station staff there\n\nCan you tell me more about the incident?\n\nIn this particular situation the fault has been confirmed as a 'Track Circuit Failure'. This means the signalling system is unable to automatically verify if the next section of track past the affected signal is clear.\n\nThe rail network is designed so that if a signal stops working, trains will stop before they reach it. Whilst this issue is ongoing, train crew will stop at the affected signal and contact the signalling centre to confirm their location. At this point the signaller will verbally authorise the driver to continue towards the next signal. This process adds time to every train's journey, which means services can experience short delays.\n\nCheck before you travel:\n\nYou can check your journey using the National Rail Enquiries real-time Journey Planner\n\nTwitter:\n\nIf you would like to follow this incident on Twitter, please use #Seaford\n\nCompensation:\n\nYou may be entitled to compensation if you experience a delay in completing your journey today. Please keep your train ticket and make a note of your journey, as both will be required to support any claim."
