        "text": "NVM has been removed (years back) from the database. Are there tickets left that can force Southern to run a replacement taxi? If so, can this be at any time of day or only mirroring the empty train that runs?\n\nPossible tickets might include Downloader, Daysave, All Line Rover?\n\nPurely theoretical. I have no immediate plans to visit the area, and if I did I would probably do the sensible thing and walk!\n\nAIUI the ferries still operate but with the foot passenger terminal in a different part of the docks. So there's no longer any need or purpose to travel to the Marine (or Harbour) station, because for foot passengers they would have gone too far past where they need to be:\n\nQ6. What train station do I need to alight from, Newhaven Harbour or Newhaven town station?\n\nA6. You need to get off at Newhaven Town station and then you have a 3 minute walk to the terminal.\n\nhttp://newhavenferryport.co.uk/faq.htm\n\nIt doesn't seem the closure of NVM is intended to reduce the ability to use the ferries...\n\nIt's slightly depressing, this whole closure of stations by stealth thing. It just seems odd how there are stations like this and Norton Bridge that will probably never be re-opened, and yet have not been closed.\n\nThe ferry terminal was moved to about 300 yards walk from Newhaven Town Station nearly 10 years ago.\n\nThe is no reason to use Newhaven Marine anymore it's a car park.\n\nNewhaven Harbour now serves a small industrial estate and nothing much else.\n\nIts very likely with the withdrawal of the French Local Government Subsidy that the ferry service will be discontinued at the end of the summer season and quite likely that the Port of Newhaven itself will close since the ferry is the majority of its business.\n\nThen why wasn't Tunbridge Wells West kept open? Or does multiple stations mean more chance of closure. There again Reddich South and Denton are still going.\n\nThat's not to say your not correct Eagle, just seems odd. May be closure costs were cheaper in 1985.\n\nTunbridge Wells West had everything going for its closure. The main Hastings Line was being electrified and it saved the cost of resignalling Grove junction.\n\nThe closure released a huge parcel of premium land at the Western end of Tunbridge Wells town centre. The line had been run down and in the couple of times I managed to visit there were hardly any passengers by then most people had changed to bus when the Uckfield Lewes line had closed."
