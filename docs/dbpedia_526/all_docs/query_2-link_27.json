        "text": "Chalky white cliffs, beautiful beaches and even a ferry to France - you’d be forgiven for assuming it’s Dover that’s being described. But there’s actually another underrated seaside town that shares all of these same qualities with this famous UK location.\n\nLike Dover, Newhaven is a harbour town and port located on England’s southern coast, with views over the English Channel. However, you’ll find it at the mouth of the River Ouse, in East Sussex not Kent. To reach it from London, meanwhile, you’ll want a train via London Waterloo rather than St Pancras or Victoria - and can get there in only 75 minutes.\n\nThe Newhaven to Dieppe ferry is operated by DFDS Seaways, with up to 21 passenger services per week. It Newhaven’s West Quay beach and takes you to the picturesque French city of Dieppe. The duration of sailings is approximately four hours - find more information or to book here.\n\nREAD MORE: Britain's longest ferry ride where you can take your car to Spain but it takes 35 hours\n\nNewhaven also has a number of other unique coastal features to recommend it, including its lengthy harbour arm and isolated old-fashioned lighthouse. The latter sits at the exposed end of the arm and makes for splendid photo opportunities.\n\nPlus, fashion fans will also be excited to know that Newhaven’s beach was also the site of a recent Alexander McQueen photo shoot. As SussexLive reported, the luxury designer brand chose the site’s stunning white cliff backdrop and mix of shingle and pebble to photograph its pre-Spring/Summer 2021 resort collection.\n\nHowever, there’s plenty else to do in Newhaven besides visiting the beach. For starters, the harbour town is perfectly poised if you want to take on the Seven Sisters cliff hike. This popular UK coastal walk extends between Seaford and Eastbourne and offers breathtaking views over several famous sites, including the Birling Gap and Beachy Head Lighthouse.\n\nThe route can be walked in either direction, with Seaford only an eight minute drive or train ride from Newhaven. To and from Eastbourne, meanwhile, it's about 40 minutes by rail or 30 to drive.\n\nAnother must-visit for history fans is Newhaven Fort, a historic Victorian coastal fortress which overlooks Seaford Bay. The ancient monument formerly played an important role defending the UK’s coastline from the threat of German invasion during the two World Wars. Nowadays, it’s a military heritage attraction with exhibitions, displays and even an adventure playground.\n\nAs for where to eat and drink, Newhaven has a few good old traditional pubs and restaurants, including some right by the sea. The Hope Inn, on the West Quay of Newhaven’s harbour, is one such example. Head here for decent ales and delicious roast dinners.\n\nOr if you’re after fresh fish in particular, well, you’re in luck. You can pick up shellfish rolls, seafood salads and pan-fried scallops or prawns from The Shellfish & Fish Shed, located on Newhaven’s West Beach. For an Italian spin, Luna Rossa Cafe and Bar has got you covered with a wide-ranging menu that includes seafood spaghetti and platters.\n\nYou won’t be short of places to stay when in Newhaven, either. There’s lots of hotels, B&Bs and private rentals to choose from, via Booking.com and Tripadvisor. This includes plenty with ocean views, such as the spacious three-bed holiday home Seaview Beach House. Alternatively, there’s also Barn Owls’ cottages and The Old School Guest House both come well-recommended by Tripadvisor users.\n\nREAD MORE: Pretty village 40 minutes from London with a beautiful ex-royal castle you can stay in and a stunning wild swimming spot nicknamed the 'best kept secret'\n\nHow to get there\n\nThe port town of Newhaven is easy to reach from London, whether by train or car. Driving the journey takes a little over two hours. If you want to go by rail, meanwhile, you can get there in as little as 75 minutes from London Victoria to Newhaven Town station, via Lewes. It's also possible to go from either London St Pancras or London Blackfriars, with a change at Brighton. More information and book tickets here.\n\nUK staycation deals for half term and beyond\n\nWhether you're looking for a trip to the seaside or a chance to get away from it all in the wilds of Scotland, holiday companies are keen to make sure UK travellers aren't tempted abroad this summer.\n\nCompanies such as Sykes Cottages, Snaptrip, Airbnb, Rural Retreats and Coolstays have deals and discounts on every kind of holiday cottage and home throughout 2022.\n\nFrom romantic last-minute getaways to planning ahead for a big family holiday later in the year, there are already plenty of options to explore to find your dream break.\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.Learn more\n\nAnd there’s actually a second station, Newhaven Harbour, which is closer to the coastline if you’d prefer. Either way, book train tickets or find out more at Trainline.\n\nIs there a story you think we should be covering? If so, please email whatson@mylondon.news or at tilly.alexander@reachplc.com"
