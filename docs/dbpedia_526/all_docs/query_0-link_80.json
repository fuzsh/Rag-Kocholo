        "text": "Arriving in Newhaven Town\n\nEvery day, up to 36 trains depart from Lewes and arrive in Newhaven Town, with the shortest journey taking 9m minutes.\n\nBook the cheap train tickets from Lewes to Newhaven Town\n\nIt doesn’t need to be difficult to find cheap train tickets from Lewes to Newhaven Town. If you know where to look and how to take advantage of available discounts and travel options, then saving money with Trip.com becomes second nature. Here are some of our top tips to help you save money on your train travel.\n\nUsing the Railcard for 1/3 off\n\nVarious Railcards are available for different groups and can save you up to 1/3 on fares from Lewes to Newhaven Town. You can choose the 16-25 Railcard or Senior Railcard based on your age. Additionally, the Family & Friends Railcard or Two Together Railcard are good options for group travel.\n\nTravelling in the off-peak time\n\nTaking advantage of Off-Peak train tickets is another effective way to save money on your train journey from Lewes to Newhaven Town. These tickets are generally cheaper than peak-time tickets and can be used during less busy periods, typically outside of the morning and evening rush hours. If your schedule allows for flexibility, opting for off-peak times can lead to substantial cost savings. It's important to note that in most cities and large towns, off-peak time usually starts at 09:30 from Monday to Friday, while in other areas, it typically begins at 09:00.\n\nSplit Tickets to save an average extra 30%\n\nSplitting your tickets involves purchasing separate tickets for different segments of your journey instead of a single ticket for the entire trip. This method is legal and can often result in cheaper fares. For example, if you are travelling from A to B, you might discover that buying a ticket from A to C, and then another ticket from C to B, is more economical than purchasing a direct ticket."
