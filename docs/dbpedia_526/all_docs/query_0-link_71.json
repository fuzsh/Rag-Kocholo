The Saxons on their invasion of England in 480AD settled in the area now occupied by the town. They named their village Meeching or Myching. The railway was brought to Newhaven in the mid 1800âs where the London, Brighton & South Coast Railway constructed a wharf. This made the town an important port for the shipping of freight. The harbour was dredged and made deeper around 1870 and so making suitable for cross-channel ferries to berth in the port. Newhaven was the major embarkation point for troops and equipment going to the Flanders battlefields during World War I. A large number of Canadian soldiers were stationed in the town before they were sent on the ill-fated World War II âDieppe Raidâ in 1942.\n\nFamous People\n\nCharles Deville Wells â The âMan Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo.â â Made famous in a song of that name.
