        "text": "One of the things I love most about moving to a new town is getting to explore new places. This time, I donâ€™t just have a new town to explore, but a whole new county.\n\nWith this weekend being my only free weekend over the next few weeks, it was time to pack up my camera and head out to do some adventuring.\n\nWe might not be having the best summer here in the UK but EVERYWHERE is always busier during the summer months, and even more so on the British coastline. I wasnâ€™t looking for hustle and bustle this weekend and I wasnâ€™t particularly searching for a beach, but I did want to be by the sea.\n\nSo after doing some Googling, I decided on a small port town on the East Sussex coast.\n\nNewhaven is a town full of history and played a key part in both the First and Second World Wars. Itâ€™s also home to the mouth of the River Ouse which starts its life near Lower Beeding in West Sussex. Itâ€™s also just a short 9-minute train ride from Lewes or a 20-minute drive.\n\nI decided to jump on a packed train instead of driving, and spent the 9-minute journey hoping and praying that everyone on board wouldnâ€™t be getting off at the same stop as me! Thankfully, only a handful of us disembarked at Newhaven Town.\n\nNavigating Newhaven\n\nItâ€™s worth noting that there are two train stations in Newhaven. Newhaven Town and Newhaven Harbour. Newhaven Harbour is predominantly used for passengers catching the ferry from Newhaven to Dieppe.\n\nI had no real plan before arriving in Newhaven, but I was interested in checking out the views from Castle Hill.\n\nOnce I jumped off the train, I took a left out of the station, headed past the Ferry Port entrance, and took a turning which followed the River Ouse towards the Marina. I wandered along the walkway which sits high above the river, with remnants of fishing gear to my left and housing to my right. I walked by buildings where fresh fish was being sold as well as meat wholesalers. I continued along the river, walking by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution Shop and onwards to the Marina.\n\nEncounter with a Distressed Seagull\n\nAs I made my way towards the Ho Chi Minh Memorial, I spotted a distressed seagull which had caught its foot in some fishing wire. Although I was tempted to rescue the bird myself, I knew I didnâ€™t have anything with me to cut through the fishing wire, so I rang the RSPB. Unfortauntely their local team were all out rescuing other animals, so they passed me on to a local wildlife charity. Unfortauntely their lines were busy, but I left a voicemail explaining where the seagull was. Still not happy with leaving the poor gull, I headed back to the RNLI shop and left a message with a lovely old boy who was manning the shop, letting him know what I had done and where the bird could be found if anyone came along looking for the injured gull.\n\nAt this point, having exhausted all my possible options, I continued on my walk, hoping that someone would be along to see to the injured bird.\n\nExploring the Marina and Beach\n\nFrom the Ho Chi Minh Memorial, I continued my walk along the West Quay, passing the small but bustling Marina. Continuing along Fort Road, I was getting closer to the mouth of the Ouse and continued along the path until I reached Newhaven West Beach. To my surprise, Newhaven West Beach was full of beautiful sand, but unfortauntely there is no way of reaching the beachâ€¦possibly why it looked so clean! To the right of the beach is the harbour wall and Newhaven Breakwater Lighthouse. Unfortauntely the harbour wall is also closed off so youâ€™re unable to walk to the lighthouse, but it looks like a great spot to come back to on a stormy day for some photography!\n\nIt was lunchtime by this point and my belly reminded me it was time to stop for a snack. But having decided I would like lunch with a view, I walked back on myself and headed towards the Fort and Castle Hill. I had spotted a few roadside cafes on my walk to the beach, and a good few pubs, but nothing that tickled my fancy. So feeling grateful that I had packed a bag full of snacks, I made my way towards Castle Hill.\n\nClimbing Castle Hill\n\nWhilst most of the walk up until this point had been flat, the walk up Castle Hill definitely isnâ€™t that! Once off the main road, I didnâ€™t think the footpath up the hill was very well signposted and found myself walking up a road for most of it. Halfway up the hill, I found the Fort. Unfortauntely itâ€™s currently closed until 2025 due to restoration workâ€¦looks like Iâ€™ll have to save that one for next year. So, I continued my walk up the hill. Spotting the National Coastwatch lookout, I also found a path which led onto the Nature Reserve itself.\n\nEnjoying the Views\n\nThe views from Castle Hill are beautiful. It was so peaceful up there. I found a lovely spot looking out across the English Channel to enjoy my snacks and other than the coastguards, I only saw one or two other people the whole time I was there. With many tourists preferring to head to nearby Eastbourne or Brighton on a sunny July day instead, I was grateful to have chosen somewhere a bit less touristy and off the beaten track.\n\nAs I headed back towards the train station, I started to think of the trapped seagull again, desperately hoping it had been rescued or had somehow managed to untangle itself. Unfortauntely there was not to be a happy ending for the seagull.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Newhaven\n\nBefore heading home, I wandered into the town centre to see what I could find, but other than more pubs and a Boots, thereâ€™s not much there. There are a few larger stores by the train station with a Range, Iceland, McDonalds and KFC.\n\nWith two trains an hour back to Lewes, I didnâ€™t have long to wait for my train home.\n\nOverall, I would say Newhaven is a town for visiting rather than staying, and one for the hiker, rather than the shopper. But if youâ€™re not into super commercial coastal towns, enjoy walking, history and visiting somewhere thatâ€™s a little bit different, Newhaven could be the perfect day trip for you. I for one will definitely be back."
