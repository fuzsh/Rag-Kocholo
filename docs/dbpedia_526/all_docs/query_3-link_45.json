        "text": "The best places to live in Sussex are of course completely subjective but what is indisputable is that Sussex (East and West) is blessed with a myriad of beautiful towns and villages that offer a great way of life and a strong sense of community. On our travels around the county, we’ve been lucky enough to visit many of these (if not yet all) and we’re often left with a sense of, “Wow, I wish I lived here.” So using a fairly basic criterion (which includes curb appeal, property prices, transport links, local amenities and schools) combined with a gut instinct and what the locals we’ve talked to have said, this is our list of 20 of the best places to live in Sussex.\n\nYou may not agree with our choice. You may have your own favourite or criteria or you may think we’ve missed somewhere very special. And if that’s the case, let us know and we’ll get back on the road and go and visit it for you.\n\nSeaford\n\nSeaford is a coastal town in East Sussex between Newhaven and Eastbourne. It has a long history that dates back to the Middle Ages and it sits on a sweeping bay at the foot of the South Downs. To the east of the town is the distinctive Seaford Head and views of the Seven Sisters cliffs. To the west of the town are Newhaven Harbour and Fort. Between the centre of the bay and Seaford Head, there is a Martello Tower that is now a museum and a row of beach huts that in the summer house various shops and boutiques. Seaford has two golf courses, a cricket club, a rugby club and a football club. The town is also home to two bowling clubs and a leisure centre. Seaford Sailing Club is slightly to the west of the town and the town is ideally placed for walking with some fantastic local landmarks such as Cuckmere Valley and the South Downs.\n\nThere are regular buses along the coast to Eastbourne and Brighton, as well as north to Alfriston, and Seaford also has a mainline station that connects the town to London via Lewes or via Brighton. Independent schools nearby include Eastbourne College and Bedes at Upper Dicker. According to Rightmove average property prices have fallen here recently and at the end of 2023, the average price was £397,955.\n\nMidhurst\n\n50 miles from London, 20 miles from the coast, and just north of the South Downs, Midhurst is a pretty market town that dates back to the 12th century. It’s an easy commute from Midhurst to Chichester, Guildford and Portsmouth, and the main secondary school, Midhurst Rother College, is an Academy secondary school with an outstanding Ofsted report. Seaford College is the nearest private school about 7.5 miles to the south east.\n\nThe town has a bustling high street with a good selection of shops, restaurants, and cafés and it has a variety of local sports clubs. One of the other greatest attractions of Midhurst is the Cowdray Estate with its magnificent Tudor ruins, regular polo, shooting, golf, farm shop and walks. After a tough year in 2023, with a major fire in the town centre, Midhurst is now bouncing back. The average cost of a property in 2023 was £460,155 (10% down on last year).\n\nShoreham\n\nShoreham is a surprisingly hip, up-and-coming place to be. Despite being home to a modern port, the town dates back to pre-Roman times, and there are lots of historic buildings that hint at its long and interesting past. At just over 50 miles from London, it’s also within easy reach of Brighton and Chichester, and of course, sits just south of the South Downs. It’s got its own museum, airport and beach, and has a backstory that includes Charles II and his escape to France, British filmmaking history and a collection of the most extraordinary houseboats.\n\nAccording to Rightmove, house prices averaged at £463,155 (2023) and local private schools include Lancing College and Shoreham College. Shoreham Academy was rated outstanding by Ofsted.\n\nHaywards Heath\n\nOne of the newer towns of Sussex, Haywards Heath benefits from being on the main London to Brighton railway line, with journey times to London of 45 minutes to an hour and the quickest train to Brighton taking just 15 minutes. In the town centre is the attractive Broadway where cafés, bars and restaurants spill out onto the pavement.\n\nHaywards Heath is also just a short drive from Ashdown Forest, the South Downs, and Ardingly Reservoir. There are lots of things to do in the surrounding area including golf at nearby Cuckfield, the Bluebell Railway heritage line, Wakehurst, Sheffield Park and local vineyards. The town has two state secondary schools and for private schools, Burgess Hill Girls, Ardingly College and Hurstpierpoint College are within easy reach. According to Rightmove, average prices last summer (2023) were £526,305.\n\nRobertsbridge\n\nRobertsbridge is a pretty East Sussex village in between Hastings and Tunbridge Wells. It has its own railway station which is on the London Bridge to Hastings line so although it feels very rural, it only takes just over an hour to be in central London. The town dates back to the 12th century and the high street is lined with period properties with many from the 14th and 15th centuries. It’s also just off the main A21 (which these days by-passes the town) and the town centre is bustling with a parade of shops, pubs and a restaurant.\n\nRobertsbridge is also set within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and as you’d expect, there are lots of great local walks, with Darwell Reservoir and Bedgebury Pinetum not far. This is an area that is oozing with history and you can also walk to nearby Battle and Bodiam Castle. Robertsbridge has its own secondary school and local prep school and at neighbouring Bodiam, you’ll find Claremont Senior School and Sixth Form which won Independent School of the Year for Performing Arts in 2021. Bucking the trend, according to Rightmove, average house prices in 2023 in Robertsbridge increased by 6% to £558,882.\n\nUckfield\n\nRight on the edge of Ashdown Forest and centrally located in East Sussex, Uckfield is a historic town with a bustling town centre and average house prices in 2023 of £445,002, making it an affordable place to live. With its own cinema, the town is surrounded by nature reserves and fabulous countryside with trains to London making it a good choice for commuters.\n\nFor private schools, you have Cumnor House near Croydon, Mayfield School and Roedean School.\n\nDitchling\n\nJust north of Brighton, pretty Ditchling has excellent links to London but sits within the South Downs National Park. Better still you might say, it has two pubs, cafés, a post office, and a delicatessen. It even has its own Film Society and the Ditchling Singers. It’s another Sussex village that can trace its origins back to well before the Romans although Ditchling was first recorded in 765. Later, the manor and its lands were apparently held by King Alfred the Great.\n\nIt has a number of points of interest including the Old Meeting House, Ditchling Museum of Art and Craft and two Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the parish. The local state school is Downlands Community School in Hassocks, and Hurstpierpoint College and Burgess Hill School for Girls are both excellent private schools in close reach. According to Rightmove, prices here increased in 2023 by 41% to £1,123,935 making it one of the most desirable places to live in Sussex.\n\nStorrington\n\nStorrington is a rural town in the Horsham District of West Sussex. It’s a short drive from the main A24 in between Horsham and Worthing. Part of the parish is within the South Downs National Park and a large part of the town is a conservation area. Storrington was listed in the Domesday Book and a walk around reveals lots of interesting architecture. St Mary’s Church was originally built in the 11th century although was much altered and rebuilt in the 13th, 15th, 18th and 19th centuries. Next to the church is St Joseph’s Hall in Greyfriars Lane, a Grade II listed former residence of the Bishop of Arundel and Brighton look out for the gorgeous carved door in Browns Lane.\n\nIn the town centre, there is a great selection of shops, restaurants, coffee shops and pubs. There is a butcher, electrical store, supermarket, clothes and fashion boutiques, dog grooming, nail parlours, a bike shop, antiques, a Post Office, a chemist and more. They also have football and cricket pitches as well as a leisure centre. There are lots to do in the surrounding area and you are only a short drive from Worthing, Horsham and the city of Brighton. That said, one of the big attractions of Storrington has to be its rural location and proximity to the South Downs and the South Downs Way and in fact, Storrington is the closest town to the halfway point of the South Downs Way.\n\nMainline train services are at nearby Pulborough or Amberley and trains to London take an hour and a quarter. Trains to Gatwick Airport take about 25 minutes. If you’re thinking about local schools, you have a great choice in Storrington, with Windlesham House School (prep school) just outside the town and nearby independent schools at Lancing College, Seaford College, Farlington School, Christ’s Hospital and Hurstpierpoint College. Last year (2023), the average property price for property in Storrington was £553,390. For more information about local properties visit: At Home Estate and Letting Agency.\n\nWadhurst\n\nThe market town of Wadhurst almost certainly dates back to before the 13th century and has its own castle (a 19th-century castellated mansion) which featured in the season finale of “The Crown”. Wadhurst’s attractive high street has a good selection of shops and pubs and some interesting period properties. Wadhurst is not far from Royal Tunbridge Wells and also has its own station with trains to London in under an hour. Set within the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, nearby you’ll find Bewl Water (the largest stretch of open water in the South East) and home to sailing, windsurfing, canoeing, kayaking, fishing, walking, and cycling.\n\nWadhurst has its own Catholic prep school, nearby Mayfield School for girls (a leading Catholic independent boarding and day school) and the outstanding Tonbridge School for boys not far away. For private co-ed options, Benenden School in Cranbrook is also not too far. Last year the average price for a house in Wadhurst was £618,165 (2023).\n\nWorthing\n\nWorthing in West Sussex is ten miles west of Brighton, just to the south of the South Downs and sits on a stretch of sandy and shingle beach. Its Art Deco pier has twice been named Pier of the Year and it’s a town that has a rich and diverse history and a fascinating mix of architectural styles. It has three theatres and a beautiful cinema. The town itself can be traced back to the Domesday Book although there have been settlers in the area for thousands of years. As a result of a regeneration project, Worthing is a town that is very much on the up. It has an artistic and literary heritage and a slightly bohemian vibe, with a bustling town centre that includes supermarkets, clothes boutiques, art galleries and antiques, restaurants, cafés and pubs. With fantastic walking at nearby Cissbury Hill, Highdown Hill and the South Downs as well as coastal walks, it’s a great town for the active and it’s also a haven for watersport, has two golf clubs, as well as football, rugby and hockey clubs.\n\nThere are a number of good schools in the area including a sixth-form college and one college of higher and further education. There is an independent school within the town and Lancing College and Seaford College are within easy reach. The town has good transport links as it sits at the end of the main A24 to London and just south of the A27 which runs from east to west. It also has five train stations with direct trains to Gatwick and London. In 2023, the average property price was £388,494 making it one of the more affordable towns in Sussex.\n\nEastbourne\n\nThis seaside town has undergone a bit of a revival since the 1980s and is now a stylish and cosmopolitan place to live with a busy cultural scene that includes two theatres, the outstanding Towner Art Gallery and a regular programme of seafront performances. It has a Brighton-esque vibe but is far more accessible and intimate.\n\nEastbourne sits at the gateway to the South Downs and is a short drive from Beachy Head, Birling Gap and Cuckmere Haven, while the town itself is dotted with original Victorian architecture and historical points of interest. Just over 60 miles to London, the commute takes about an hour and half but it’s an easy drive to Brighton and Hastings. The town is home to Eastbourne College an independent school and not far from Bede’s at Upper Dicker. It also has an Academy school. And perhaps the best part of Eastbourne is that the average property price in August 2023 was just £332,559 making it very affordable.\n\nBexhill On Sea\n\nJust to the west of Hastings, this seaside town has lots to love. With a history that stretches back to before the Norman Conquest, it also has an affinity with motor racing. There is an Old Town where you’ll find the ruins of the 13th century manor, and on the seafront, you’ll find the impressive De La Warr Pavilion and art gallery and the exotic Colonnade and promenade. There is also a museum, sailing and rowing clubs, a large park and two golf courses.\n\nFor transport, Bexhill is on the A259 which runs the length of the county and Bexhill has train lines to Brighton, London and Ashford. According to Rightmove, the average property price in 2023 was £331,990. Private schools in the area include Battle Abbey School, Eastbourne College and Bede’s.\n\nMayfield\n\nSet in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Mayfield is about 45 miles from London (about 1 ½ hrs by train). The village was mentioned in the Domesday Book and has an interesting history. It benefited from the local iron industry in the 16th and 17th century and much of the historic architecture reflects this time. By the 18th century, it was a centre for smugglers. All sorts of legends abound about Mayfield, including one that in the late 900s, St Dunstan confronted the devil here disguised as a young woman and then pinched the devil’s nose with hot tongs. The devil then fled to Tunbridge Wells and doused his burnt nose with the spring water.\n\nMayfield has two pubs, a number of shops, its own bonfire carnival and is home to the well-known celebrity retreat, Fair Oak Farm. It’s also close to the Cuckoo Line (an old steam train railway line). You’ll also find an independent Roman Catholic girls school here with Benenden and the prestigious Tonbridge School close by whilst the “well above average” Beacon Academy is in neighbouring Crowborough. All of this is reflected in the slightly more expensive average house prices in Mayfield of £740,952 (2023), down on the previous year.\n\nSteyning\n\nNot ideal for commuting but only four miles from the coast and in the very heart of the South Downs, Steyning oozes history and character. The town dates back to Anglo Saxon times and is home to timber-framed and historic buildings, legends, twittens, and curiously named streets and homes. Apart from being a very pretty little town, it also has a thriving community with its own art scene, festival, Heritage Trail and lots and lots of local walks. Cafés and boutiques line the high street, and cricket is played to the stunning backdrop of the South Downs and it hosts a fabulous yearly food and drink festival.\n\nThe average house price in 2023 was £535,930 (slightly more than the previous year) and Steyning has an excellent school. There are also a number of highly rated private schools nearby which include Lancing College and Shoreham College.\n\nAlfriston\n\nThe exceptionally pretty village of Alfriston is just south of the A27 and almost halfway between Eastbourne and Newhaven. It’s in the stunning River Cuckmere Valley and oozes charm with views of the South Downs and lots of interesting old buildings. There’s heaps of history here and Alfriston used to sit on the Medieval pilgrim’s way from Battle Abbey to Chichester. The Alfriston Clergy House was the first building in Britain brought by the National Trust for conservation in 1896.\n\nAlfriston may be small but it has three pubs, several hotels, and a number of restaurants. The average price of a home here in 2023 was £539,100 (according to Rightmove), which is 37% less than the previous year. Train links to London require a trip to nearby Polegate but the Sussex coast and Eastbourne are within easy reach. The village has its own primary school and a good nearby secondary school in Eastbourne. Just down the road at Upper Dicker is Bedes, an excellent private school.\n\nHurstpierpoint\n\nHurstpierpoint has a long, pretty and bustling high street lined with period properties, including many from the 18th century. It’s a large village with a strong sense of community that dates back to at least the Domesday Book and has a total of five churches (although not all of them are open these days). It’s also only 1.5 miles from Hassocks which has a mainline station on the London to Brighton line from which you can be in London in under an hour. To the south of Hurstpierpoint, you have the South Downs, Brighton, and the coast in easy reach. The village has its own amateur dramatics society, football club, and magazine and not only hosts its very own two-week festival but is also apparently home to the oldest English village fair in the country.\n\nAlthough the nearest state secondary school is in Hassocks, the village has Hurstpierpoint College (a private secondary and sixth form with a great reputation) right on its doorstep as its name suggests. The average house price in 2023 was £716,023, 7% more than the previous year but still making it good value for the combination of country life but access to London.\n\nLewes\n\nAnother beautiful Sussex town that has oodles of history, charm, and curb appeal is Lewes. Apart from its glorious and central castle, Lewes is home to artisan markets, a flea market, and a craft market and has its own brewery. It has narrow cobbled streets, views of the South Downs, and a thriving community. Trains to London take just over an hour and the Sussex coast and dynamic town of Brighton are just over the South Downs. Surrounded by beautiful Sussex countryside and in between Haywards Heath and Eastbourne, Lewes also has one of the most famous fireworks parades in the country and Glyndebourne Opera House is within reach.\n\nLewes Old Grammar School is an independent, co-educational day school in the town and there are a number of other independent schools nearby such as Brighton College and Roedean School. Properties in Lewes had an overall average price of £581,474 last year (2023).\n\nHorsham\n\nThe historic market town of Horsham is popular with London commuters because of its good train links to the capital. It’s got a pretty central square known as The Carfax and lots of interesting period features and history. It’s also a great base for sport with rugby, football and cricket clubs, and has lots of independent boutiques, cafes, bars and restaurants.\n\nThe town is home to four state secondary schools (Tanbridge House School, Millais School, Forest School and the recently opened Bohunt School) and it’s also not far from a number of excellent private schools including Farlington School and Christ’s Hospital. The town’s Collyer’s is one of the leading sixth-form colleges in the country. Over the last year, the average house price in Horsham was £463,863 (2023). Beyond the town, there are some great local footpaths including the West Sussex Literary Trail and the High Weald Landscape Trail, as well as nearby St. Leonards Forest.\n\nNewhaven\n\nIf you’re looking for a seaside location that is affordable and also near the South Downs and Brighton, then Newhaven may be the answer. According to Rightmove, in October 2023, average property prices were just £303,668 and if you don’t want to live in the town there are lots of surrounding villages.\n\nNewhaven dates back to the Middle Ages and with a harbour and port has always been a busy town. There is a good bus network linking the town to other coastal towns such as Seaford and Brighton and regular ferries to France! For private schools, it’s not far to Roedean School, Brighton College and Bede’s.\n\nRye\n\nRye has to be one of the prettiest towns in Sussex if not the prettiest and Mermaid Street is one of the most photographed streets on Instagram. A Cinque Port with fantastic views, Rye is a little labyrinth of cobbled streets and corners overlooked by its castle and church. It has enormous amounts of charm and history, and if you don’t mind the summer tourists, it’s an idyllic place to live. The town does not have the best train service to London with trains going via Ashford or Hastings but it does have a fabulous selection of shops and restaurants which include art galleries, quirky boutiques, coffee shops, pubs, historic hotels and all sorts of curiosities. Perched on a hill, there are views across the surrounding marshlands to the sea where Rye Harbor Nature Reserve offers fantastic walking and an abundance of wildlife.\n\nSurprisingly, last year (2023) the average property price was a modest £414,675 but these were undoubtedly not properties within the fortified centre. Nearby private schools include award-winning Claremont Senior School and Sixth Form at Bodiam.\n\nIf you like this post about the Best Places to Live in Sussex, you may also like:\n\nThe 25 Best Places to Visit in Sussex"
