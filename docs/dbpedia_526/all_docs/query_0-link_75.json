        "text": "Sussex is a glorious county, the so-called garden of England and for very good reason. I've lived in Sussex most of my life, including: Brighton, Eastbourne, Seaford, Newhaven, Hadlow Down, and of course Herstmonceux.\n\nThere is so much of interest to see and do in the United Kingdom, and I hope to expand the local geography section as time allows, to cover the most interesting aspects of this wonderful country.\n\nNewhaven is a town in the Lewes District of East Sussex in England. It lies at the mouth of the River Ouse, on the Sussex Coast, and is a car ferry port for services across the English Channel to Dieppe in Normandy. The port handles industrial traffic and there is also a small marina.\n\nNewhaven lighthouse - Photos Â© COF Ltd\n\nThe town is linked to Lewes by rail; there are two stations: Newhaven Town and Newhaven Harbour. The line terminates at nearby Seaford. The port of Newhaven is now entirely owned by the French authorities.\n\nThe huge Newhaven Fort, built on Castle Hill in the 1860s, is only the last of several built here since Bronze Age times. It is now a visitor attraction.\n\nWhilst the commercial and industrial communities of Newhaven have declined, the town has been granted quite extensive regeneration programmes for several years, to varying degrees of success. These have included a huge increase in properties built in the town over the past decade or so. Recent developments have sought to increase economic prosperity in the area, but have on the whole failed, with the recent closure of several of the town's major shops. One of the business closures was, in part, a protest at the mismanagement of the town.\n\nNewhaven used to be named Meeching until the 16th Century when a great storm diverted the course of the Sussex Ouse so forming a New Haven.\n\nFor the record - although Newhaven is the postal town of South Heighton & Denton, they are separate villages. They are NOT Newhaven.\n\nNewhaven harbour\n\nArcheological Sites\n\nTo the east of Newhaven is the derelict village of Tide Mills which is the remains of workers' cottages, a tide mill, and a large saline lagoon which was the storage pond for high water to power the mill on the outgoing tide.\n\nAlmost within the same site is the set of foundations for the Heritage Marine Hospital [3] which was founded in the mid 19th century to cater for disabled boys who had undergone surgery.\n\nTide Mills is also associated with the pioneering Newhaven Seaplane Base\n\nIntrigue\n\nWhen Lord Lucan vanished in 1974, his car was found in Newhaven, in Norman Road, with two types of blood in it.\n\nNewhaven marina\n\nNewhaven lifeboat\n\nNewhaven ferries\n\nNewhaven Fort\n\nTrain times and station information for Newhaven Harbour railway station from National Rail\n\nMap of Newhaven Harbour railway station from Multimap.com\n\nSUSSEX INDEX A - Z\n\nALFRISTON\n\nARUNDEL CASTLE - WETLANDS WILDFOWL TRUST\n\nBATTLE\n\nBATTLE ABBEY\n\nBATTLE OF HASTINGS\n\nBEACHY HEAD - BELL TOOT (BELLE TOUT) LIGHTHOUSE\n\nBEXHILL\n\nBIRLING GAP\n\nBISHOPSTONE\n\nBODIAM CASTLE\n\nBRIGHTON\n\nCHICHESTER\n\nCHIDDINGLY - HORSE SHOW and GYMKHANA\n\nCROWBOROUGH\n\nCUCKMERE VALLEY - EXCEAT\n\nDISTRICT AND BOROUGH COUNCILS\n\nDRUSILLAS\n\nEAST SUSSEX\n\nEASTBOURNE - EASTBOURNE PIER\n\nFIRLE\n\nFIRLE BONFIRE SOCIETY\n\nGLYNDE\n\nGUY FAWKES\n\nHADLOW DOWN\n\nHAILSHAM\n\nHASTINGS - NET SHOPS - PIER\n\nHEATHFIELD\n\nHERSTMONCEUX - CASTLE - CE SCHOOL - LINKS - FESTIVAL - MUSEUM\n\nKNOCKHATCH\n\nLEWES\n\nLEWES DISTRICT COUNCIL\n\nLIME PARK - HERSTMONCEUX - AUGUSTUS HARE\n\nNEWHAVEN\n\nPEVENSEY CASTLE\n\nRYE\n\nSEAFORD\n\nSEVEN SISTERS\n\nSHOREHAM - PORT\n\nSUSSEX - SUSSEX BAY, MARINE REWILDING PROJECT\n\nSUSSEX THINGS TO DO GUIDE\n\nTHE BATTLE OF HASTINGS\n\nTRUGS\n\nTWISSELLS MILL, OLD HEATHFIELD\n\nUCKFIELD\n\nWEALD\n\nWEALDEN DISTRICT COUNCIL - COUNCILLORS 2023\n\nWORLD GEOGRAPHY\n\nSolar Cola drinkers care about planet earth\n\n..
