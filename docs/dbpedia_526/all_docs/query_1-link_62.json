        "text": "First Train Service at Newhaven Marine Aggregates Terminal\n\nThe first DB Cargo operated aggregates train has served Newhaven Marine aggregates terminal this week as the new plant opens to railfreight traffic.\n\nThursday 18th June 2020 saw DB Cargo’s class 66 locomotive number 66113 work the Acton Yard to Newhaven Marine service, running via the Brighton Mainline, Cooksbridge and Lewes. The service was formed of empty box wagons, which are loaded at Newhaven Marine sidings. 66113 was recently applied Key Worker vinyls to show their support.\n\nNewhaven Marine, once a station which served Newhaven’s ferry port, has been closed to the public for a number of years and until recently, saw only several Empty Coaching Stock non-passenger services a week.\n\nThe new aggregates terminal at Newhaven East Quay branches off from the Lewes to Seaford branch at Newhaven Harbour. The platform and old station area serves as a run around loop for locomotives, before backing the train into 1 of 2 parallel sidings. The rake of wagons is loaded with marine-dredged aggregates and sand, imported by a suction dredger such as Brett-operated Britannia Beaver boat. Following loading of half of the rake of wagons, the consist is split, and those loaded wagons are moved into the adjacent siding, out of the way. The remainder of the empty wagons is then shunted into the loading siding.\n\nWhilst a number of trains have used the Marine platform area for reversals , including Southern class 313s and 377s, as well as a variety of engineering trains and tampers to renew the sidings, today was the first official commercial rail service into the new yard.\n\nCorrespondents of the Rail Record website have been following the development progress of Newhaven Marine sidings, showing a selection of photographs from the area over the past few months.\n\nYou can watch the video of the first train arriving into Newhaven Marine on Youtube and below:\n\nTimings for the first aggregates train into Newhaven Marine:\n\nThere are paths into and out of Newhaven Marine Monday through to Saturday, but all paths are in the Working Timetable and run only when they are required. Therefore, whilst there are multiple schedules for each day of the week, only some will run. Live train times can show when a service is running – just search for “Newhaven Marine Ag Tml Dbc”.\n\nTrain 6O13 runs SX from 18/05/20 to 11/12/20 Type WTT Diesel Loco Timed at 060mph Sector 5 Train service code 57121920 Acton T.C. 1029 Acton Wells Jn 1034 Willesden S.W.S. 1036 Willesden Sw Goods Lines 1040 Mitre Bridge Jn 1042 North Pole Jn 1044 Kensington (Olympia) 1049 Latchmere Jn 1057 Clapham Junction 1100-1106 Balham 1111 Streatham North Jn 1113 Streatham Common 1116 Selhurst 1125 Windmill Bridge Jn 1127 East Croydon 1129 South Croydon 1133-1151 Purley 1157 Stoats Nest Jn. 1201 Redhill 1214 Earlswood (Surrey) 1218 Gatwick Airport 1227 Three Bridges 1233 Balcombe Tunnel Jn 1239 Copyhold Jn 1245 Haywards Heath 1246 Keymer Jn 1250 Lewes 1307 Southerham Jn 1309 Newhaven Town 1319 Newhaven Harbour 1320 Newhaven Marine Ag Tml Dbc 1322\n\nTimings for the first train out of Newhaven Marine:\n\nCarrying marine dredged materials for unloading at Neasden.\n\nTrain 6V16 runs THO from 18/06/20 to 18/06/20 Type VAR Diesel Loco Timed at 060mph Sector 5 Train service code 57121920 Newhaven Marine Ag Tml Dbc 2118 Newhaven Harbour 2120 Newhaven Town 2121 Southerham Jn 2131 Lewes 2134 Keymer Jn 2153 Haywards Heath 2158 Copyhold Jn 2159 Balcombe Tunnel Jn 2209 Three Bridges 2211 Gatwick Airport 2214 Earlswood (Surrey) 2220 Redhill 2222 Stoats Nest Jn. 2235 Purley 2236 South Croydon 2241 East Croydon 2243 Windmill Bridge Jn 2244 Norwood Junction 2248 Bromley Jn 2252 Crystal Palace 2254 West Norwood 2307 West Norwood Junction 2307 Streatham Hill 2312 Balham 2315 Clapham Junction 2320-2325 Latchmere Jn 2328 Kensington (Olympia) 2335 North Pole Jn 2338 Mitre Bridge Jn 2340 Willesden Sw Goods Lines 2343 Willesden S.W.S. 2344 Acton Wells Jn 2346 Acton T.C. 2352-0550 Acton Wells Jn 0555 Acton Canal Wharf 0557 Neasden Jn 0601 Neasden Engineers Sdgs 0604"
