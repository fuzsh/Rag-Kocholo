Despite that both sailings each day from Newhaven to Dieppe in France warranted Boat Train services to and from London. There were two pairs of trains in either direction connecting with the Sealink ferry sailings 7 days a week. Rolling stock was generally a pair of Brighton allocated 4-CIG EMU's as seen above. Unlike the Kent Coast boat trains these workings made intermediate stops at Gatwick Airport and East Croydon between the port and London so could be used by non international ticket holders.\n\t\n\tNewhaven  Marine station was somewhat unusual for the fact it was a short branch into the port beside the ferry berth off the main branch line from Lewes to Seaford. Despite having a station name in its own right it was so close to Newhaven Harbour station it was designated as the latter's platform 3. The photo depicts 4-CIG EMU's 1805 and 1264 waiting departure with 1F39 the 17.20 Newhaven Marine to London Victoria. There was another path for 1F39 at 18.20 but this was only used for five weeks of the year in September-October when British Summer time was in sync with mainland Europe so the ferry on paper appeared to take an hour longer.\n\tThe routing of these trains was also somewhat unusual as despite being BR South Central division rolling stock they were in effect hired by BR International so terminated in the South Eastern side of London Victoria station where all the BR Europe facilities were located. To do this they were the only booked passenger services to traverse the Pouparts Junction - Stewarts Lane Junction - Battersea Reversible Line - Battersea Pier Junction non passenger line. Although this then put them back onto the up slow Brighton line on the south central division side of the station the train then used a rare crossover linking the two halves of Victoria station called 219 points to terminate in platform 8. For this reason the Newhaven boat trains always got an entry in the Branch Line Society publication called PSUL (Passenger Services over Unusual Lines).",
