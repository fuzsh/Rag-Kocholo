        "text": "AUGUST 2024\n\nFLEXIBUS CONFUSION\n\nThe East Sussex Flexibus, which allows you to book a trip on a minibus from some stops in Lewes to almost anywhere nearby not served by public transport but outside Lewes, is a wonderful facility.\n\nBut the publicity is abysmal. Just recently, the Flexibus zones were abolished. You can now book from Lewes to anywhere within a roughly 14 mile zone. For details see the map here\n\nThe map suggests that you can book from anywhere in Lewes, and that you can travel within Lewes.\n\nBut information from Flexibus says that this is not the case:\n\nYou can still only pick up the flexibus from the following points:\n\nThe railway station\n\nSchool Hill bottom\n\nTesco\n\nThe Gallops (for the Victoria Hospital)\n\nYou still cannot get a flexibus to Telscombe Village.\n\nYou cannot use a flexibus if there is an alternative train or bus route, even if the bus only goes once a day and the bus for the day has gone already!\n\nAccording to the publicity adult fares are £1 single throughout August, reverting to £2 thereafter.\n\nHo Hum. This is a really useful and mal-publicised service. For full details see here.\n\nTHE LABOUR GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC TRANSPORT\n\nThe incoming government has promised to nationalise the railways. In the short time this seems to involve setting up a body called Great British Railways which will control the track and infrastructure. The current franchises to run trains will continue, but as they come to an and they will not be renewed.\n\nIt is not clear how this will affect our local lines, which are currently run by Govia Thameslink use the Southern and Thameslink brands. The service is already run on behalf of the Government, with Govia Thameslink charging a fee to operate the trains and the government taking any profit or loss.\n\nThe government has announced a scheme it has called a bus revolution. The key point is that transport authorities (including Brighton and East Sussex) will be able to set up systems where they control the number and frequency of routes and private companies operate the service for a fee.\n\nConservative East Sussex is unlikely to do that at present, although the Conservatives will lose control if they lose just one seat. Brighton council has a good relationship with Brighton buses which it may wish to keep, although in Brighton anything can happen. This seems to be a largely urban initiative and the government has not yet said what it proposes for rural buses. The cap on bus fares is due to run out at the end of the year and the funding for the current enhanced level of service runs out at the end of 2015.\n\nGood news from the new government is the scrapping of the Arundel bypass, but bad news is the scrapping of the reinstating of a number of rail lines the Conservatives had promised to rebuild.\n\nNEVILL TIMETABLE\n\nA timetable of all the buses serving the Nevill estate can now be found on the Nevill residents association web site at https://nevillresidentsassociation.org/welcome-pack/\n\nA CRITIQUE OF THE “CHEAP” FLIGHTS INDUSTRY\n\nFascinating Aida Cheap Flights\n\nContains strong language and moderate threat.\n\nSUMMER BIKE RIDES\n\nSome bike rides of varying lengths, suiting riders of varying abilities.\n\nLewes- Barcombe Bike Ride\n\nA cycle ride through Peachaven to Brighton\n\nLewes/Newhaven to Seaford/Berwick Bike ride\n\nNewhaven to Seaford beginners Bike Ride\n\nSUMMER WALKS\n\nPaths less travelled- Ringmer to Berwick\n\nA traverse of the lonely Laughton levels. Savour the joys of solitude and a surprising variety of scenery. 13.34 Km / 8.29 miles on level ground,\n\nNewhaven Panorama\n\nFishing boats, a historic fort, cliff walks, sea views, wildflowers plants, downland views, secret woodland, an historic village and a giant cockroach. This walk round Newhaven’s harbour and surrounding countryside has it all. 6.5 miles\n\nAway from it all in Hooe\n\nThe walk starts and ends at Normans Bay station. Seaside, marshland, biodiversity, big sky and panoramic views, tranquil farmland, gentle hills, a lost village, a hidden church, a nearly forgotten prison, smugglers trails – a walk of contrasts where you are likely to have the walk to yourselves. An opportunity for a drink or a swim at the end. 10km/ 6.5 miles"
