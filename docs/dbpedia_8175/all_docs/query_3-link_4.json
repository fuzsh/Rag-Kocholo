        "text": "Edmund John Eyre was the son of Rev. Mr. Eyre who was the Rector of Leverington. Edmund was born on May 20, 1767 in Leverington located on the Isle of Ely. He was given a classical education and entered into Pembroke-Hall, Cambridge. He later dropped out to pursue his acting career. He left his friends and family to join a company near Windsor. Eyre did not concern himself with money; he was concerned with practice. He later began to write his own plays, most of which were unsuccessful. Scholars are unsure of his personal life. It is known, however, that he was married to the the former Mrs. Bolton (1791), an actress who continued to act under the name Eyre even after he eloped with a Miss Smith in 1804. Miss Smith is known to most as Henrietta Eyre who acted in Edinburgh with Edmund John Eyre until his death in 1816. Scholars disagree on the date of Eyre's death, stating that it could be on April 11th, 1816 or on April 23, 1816. The Dictionary of National Biography dates his death on the 11th.\n\nPerformances:\n\nMost of Eyre's performances occured in the 1790's. He acted in the provinces of Leominster (1794), Bristol (1794-1795), Theatre Royal, Edinburgh (1803-1804), Bath (1804-1805), and again in Edinburgh (1805-1806). After acting at Drury Lane (1806/7-1808/9), he acted at Newcastle and Worcester. Then he performed with the Drury Lane Troupe (1809/10-1810/11), later returning to Edinburgh (1811-1816).
