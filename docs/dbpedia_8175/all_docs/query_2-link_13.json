        "text": "Conducted by Scott Stroman\n\nThis album inspirational trumpeter Alison Balsom and conductor Scott Stroman fuses jazz and classical seamlessly to explore music written during America’s jazz age. The disc features music by Copland and Bernstein and a new arrangement of Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, plus Rodrigo’s Concierto d’Aranjuez and music written collaboratively by Miles Davis and Gil Evans.\n\nBUY ONLINE\n\nThis album recreates on disc a remarkable 1905 event at which Ben Jonson’s 1621 masque was performed, interspersed with music by Vaughan Williams featuring the Choir of Clare College, Cambridge alongside soloists Mary Bevan and Sophie Bevan, and conducted by William Vann. Here the dialogue is performed by the brilliant Sam and Timothy West.\n\nBUY ONLINE\n\nA rare recording of Il Paria, one of Donizetti’s most innovative and daring scores, conducted by Sir Mark Elder. In partnership with Opera Rara, Britten Sinfonia presents a work that brings a new exotic colour to Italian opera of the period, inspired by its setting in ancient India.\n\nBUY ONLINE\n\nFew living composers communicate with the emotional directness of James MacMillan. It’s no secret that MacMillan’s profound religious belief drives his creativity, but music this powerful conveys a universal message, and the title of his new symphony 'Le grand Inconnu' suggests many possible interpretations. Featuring The Sixteen and Britten Sinfonia.\n\nBUY ONLINE\n\nSOMM Recordings’ The Deeper the Blue offers an intriguing exploration of colour and timbre in music and a revealing investigation of the connections between four very different composers over a near-100-year period. Music by Vaughan Williams, Ravel, Dutilleux and Hesketh.\n\nBUY ONLINE\n\nReleased on Decca Records, this album is dedicated to all who have suffered or perished during the conflicts in the Middle East over the last 70 years. Featuring Britten Sinfonia and Polyphony conducted by Stephen Layton.\n\nBUY ONLINE\n\nAn hour of unknown but lovely music from the early maturity of Vaughan Williams, recorded for the first time.\n\nStrictly necessary cookies\n\nThese are cookies that are required for the operation of our website.
