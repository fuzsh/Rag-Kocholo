        "text": "Wordsworth wrote an endless poem in blank verse on” the growth of a poet’s mind.” I shall attempt a more modest feat for a more distracted age: a blog, “Things which a Lifetime of Trying to Be a Poet has Taught Me.”\n\nHe who would write traditional poetry in this degenerate age treads a lonely path. One finds oneself looking for companionship in the past. At least there one can find actual Poets instead of purveyors of fractured prose!\n\nTO MY PREDECESSORS\n\nSonnet XLV\n\nTheir glory has not faded! Though the years\n\nHave been kind to barbarians, and, worse,\n\nHave yielded to their hands the realm of verse;\n\nThough students cannot scan; though I have fears\n\nThat Keats may cease to be read by my peers\n\nExcept as an assignment and a curse;\n\nYet still this melody I will rehearse:\n\nI come to sing the English sonneteers.\n\nTheir glory cannot fade! My tongue repeats\n\nThe words with wonder, hour after hour,\n\nOf Sidney, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, Keats,\n\nOf Wordsworth, Hopkins—tastes within their bower\n\nRich viands, cates, and soul-sustaining meats:\n\nEach line a world of wit compressed to power.\n\nRemember: for more poetry like this, go to https://lanternhollow.wordpress.com/store/ and order Stars Through the Clouds! Also look for Inklings of Reality and Reflections from Plato’s Cave, Williams’ newest books from Lantern Hollow Press: Evangelical essays in pursuit of Truth, Goodness, and Beauty.\n\nDonald T. Williams, PhD\n\nWordsworth wrote an endless poem in blank verse on” the growth of a poet’s mind.” I shall attempt a more modest feat for a more distracted age: a blog, “Things which a Lifetime of Trying to Be a Poet has Taught Me.”\n\nIt is now 1981-82, my second and last year as Temporary Lecturer in English at the University of Georgia, teaching a full load of Freshman Composition while writing my dissertation. The dissertation was on Edmund Spenser. Can you tell? Dr. Ewbank was my faculty adviser for my undergraduate degree in English.\n\nOn Spenserian Stanza\n\nFor Two Teachers: Edmund Spenser and Frances Ewbank.\n\nWhen Spenser wrote The Faerie Queene, he made\n\nA brand new stanza up in which to frame\n\nThe glorious knights and ladies he portrayed\n\nTriumphant over villains full of shame.\n\nEver different, yet still the same,\n\nIt had to hold up through the spacious land\n\nOf Faerie from end to end, and flame\n\nMore bright with virtue there than e’er the hand\n\nOf author had achieved, in verses quaint or grand.\n\nOttava Rima had the flow he needed,\n\nBut seemed in live a lady far too light\n\nTo shadow forth the gallant knights who heeded\n\nThe Code of Maidenheed and served the bright\n\nAnd gracious Gloriana truly. Might\n\nA pensive sonnet cycle then avail?\n\nBut that would never serve to show the flight\n\nOf narrative events in time. The tale,\n\nIt seemed, must then be dight in wholly different mail.\n\nYet if the two could somehow be combined—\n\nCould move with supple dignity, but yet\n\nBe not in short, concise quatrains confined\n\nNor have its forward movement always let,\n\nCaught in the closing couplet’s double net;\n\nAnd yet still pause for needed contemplation—\n\nWith light impediment, enough to whet\n\nThe reader’s appetite for exploration—\n\nNow that would truly be a gallant innovation!\n\nSuppose we take Ottava Rima, add,\n\nTo slow its headlong plunge, a single line,\n\nRhyming with the last, but subtly clad\n\nWith just one extra foot to be a sign\n\nOf need to sip with care such heady wine—\n\nSo came The Fairie Queene. And there has been\n\nNo poem in which the Glory seemed to shine\n\nMore brightly since the storied epoch when\n\nThe Sweet Singer of Israel wielded the sword and the pen.\n\nAnd thou, doctor mihi carissima,\n\nWho showed me how to look with eyes undim\n\nUpon the bright, the ars dulcissima\n\nOf sacred Poesy, and thence to skim\n\nCream, not of just aesthesis, nor of whim,\n\nBut of the Truth well imaged forth, displayed,\n\nFilling the cup of wisdom to the brim;\n\nIf worthily I now wield Spenser’s blade,\n\nThe praise is thine, who long hast labored, taught, and prayed.\n\nRemember: for more poetry like this, go to https://lanternhollow.wordpress.com/store/ and order Stars Through the Clouds!

Williams, PhD\n\nWordsworth wrote an endless poem in blank verse on” the growth of a poet’s mind.” I shall attempt a more modest feat for a more distracted age: a blog, “Things which a Lifetime of Trying to Be a Poet has Taught Me.”\n\nHaving already fallen in love with the form and become intrigued with its possibilities, (surely not all already explored!) for modern verse, I was enraptured in my studies of Medieval and Renaissance literature by what I was learning about the history of the Sonnet. I was also becoming intrigued with the possibilities of using a form to explain or expound that form itself—something I would try many times with the Sonnet and other forms too. Was I volunteering for the job called for at the end? You bet.\n\nSONNET XXVI: THE SONNET\n\nIn Petrarch’s soul there bloomed a song whose name\n\nWas Laura; so with laurel wreath the Muse\n\nCrowned song and singer, and to us the fame\n\nOf both comes down in lines we cannot use.\n\nBut Wyatt and Surrey heard them from afar\n\nAnd with bold, though perhaps yet unsure, hands,\n\nThey plucked the laurel, careful not to mar\n\nIts form, and planted it in their own lands.\n\nIn that richer soil it grew full green,\n\nTended by husbandmen of highest skill\n\nWho coaxed it into blossoms yet unseen.\n\nIt withers now, but could yet flourish still\n\nWere but one gardener left to carry on\n\nThe work of Sidney, Spenser, Milton, Donne.\n\nRemember: for more poetry like this, go to https://www.createspace.com/3562314 and order Stars Through the Clouds!

I have graduated from seminary with a Masters of Divinity degree and am now pursuing my PhD in Medieval and Renaissance Literature at the University of Georgia, where I will transition from sneaking off to read Dante, Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton when I was supposed to be studying theology to sneaking off to read Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, and Hodge when I was supposed to be studying literature. I cannot think of a better approach to education. But first there is a transitional summer job, which produced the following:\n\nJOHN 1:14\n\nA COMMENTARY\n\nSweet to the nose, but rough to the hands, the pine\n\nBoards must be sawed just so and stacked in line\n\n(Not resting, lest they warp, upon the ground),\n\nUntil their turn has come to be nailed down\n\nWith all their fellows, framing floor or wall.\n\nHere will be the kitchen, there the hall,\n\nAnd here a bedroom with its bath, and there\n\nA porch on which to breathe the summer air,\n\nAll laced with starlight when the night is warm,\n\nAnd wonder if the distant thunder storm\n\nOr one of its wild kin will come and pay\n\nA boisterous visit e’er the break of day.\n\nBut that is weeks off yet. For now, the wide-\n\nSpaced workmen must be all kept well supplied\n\nWith lumber, hauled up from the pre-sawed stack\n\nBy means of someone’s hands and someone’s back.\n\nWhen palms grow tender, fingers stiff, back sore,\n\nThe job has just begun. You carry more.\n\nAnd so the summer passed. I often stopped\n\nAt close of day when the last load was dropped\n\nAnd thought, “In this, I’m not alone: my Lord’s\n\nHands also were worn raw by rough pine boards.”\n\nRemember: for more poetry like this, go to https://www.createspace.com/3562314 and order Stars Through the Clouds!

We end this symphony of protest about the condition of the Poetic Arts with a serious statement of an Alternative. (It is a Spenserian Sonnet, naturally.) As one of Flannery O’Connor’s characters says in response to the objection that “People have quit doing that,” “They ain’t quit doing it as long as I’m doing it.” Amen, say I. And maybe Lantern Hollow Press and its readers are proof that I am not alone in trying to keep real Poetry alive in this decadent world. Long live the Faithful Remnant, and may their tribe increase!\n\nARS POETICA\n\nA Musical Suite in Four Movements\n\n(Continued)\n\nIV\n\nHymn to the Logos\n\n(For Solo Non-Conformist)\n\nMy search for Freedom always led to Form,\n\nAnd only there could I find liberty.\n\nInside myself, I found a raging storm\n\nThat had to be bound e’er I could be free.\n\nI sought a channel for my energy\n\nThough which my will could then direct its flow\n\nThat it not splash into eternity\n\nAnd dissipate itself, but rather go\n\nToward some goal. My soul was my own foe\n\nAnd often tried to break out, marring all.\n\nAnd yet, by God’s grace, I have come to know\n\nWho my Redeemer is, and what my fall.\n\nHe it is who harnesses the storm\n\nAnd gives, in life and verse, Freedom and Form.\n\nRemember: for more poetry like this, go to https://www.createspace.com/3562314 and order Stars Through the Clouds!
