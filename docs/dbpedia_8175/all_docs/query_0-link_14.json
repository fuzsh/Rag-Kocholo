        "meta_description": "This essay explores two variations of the commonplace allegorical identification between poetry and the music of the spheres in the English Renaissance. In Edmund Spenser’s Bower of Bliss episode from The Faerie Queene, Book II (pub. 1590), and John Milton’s “Nativity Ode” (pub. 1645), it highlights the inversion of the trope, by which poetry is contrasted, rather than identified, with the music of the spheres. That practice is traced back to Geoffrey Chaucer’s “poetics of noise”, and it is further argued that Spenser and Milton invert the trope in an effort to Christianize it. Their variations are discussed in terms of the formal relationship between cosmic harmony (suggesting a homogeneous whole comprising the heavens and earth) and the inaudibility of the music of the spheres in this fallen world (suggesting a qualitative difference between the two realms and thus, a binary hierarchy). In Spenser’s Bower of Bliss, the knight of Temperance encounters an alluring semblance of heavenly music, which he must recognize as deceitful and overcome in order to achieve his end. Spenser here self-consciously presents poetic mimesis and the transgression of ontological boundaries as dangerous; Christian poetry must in good faith warn readers of its own “flawed” mimetic nature. Milton, on the other hand, offers an epiphanic vision of cosmic harmony in an ambitious attempt to inspire his readers to strive for moral perfection. He hedges his mimetic practice in the conditional to signal that he accepts, but also moves beyond, the mimetic principle suggested by Spenser.",

        "text": "Notes\n\nThe description of poetic creation in terms of viewing the heavens is something of a commonplace in the period ; see Florian Klaeger, “Golden Worlds and Brazen Lies : Comparing Astronomy and Poetry in English Renaissance Poetics”, in Anja Müller-Wood et al. (ed.), Translating Renaissance Experience, Móntreal, Éditions québécoises de l’œuvre, 2021, p. 45-66.\n\nPhilip Sidney, An Apologie for Poetrie, London, 1595, sig.

Iuvenalis and Aulus Persius Flaccus, Juvenal and Persius, George Gilbert Ramsay [trans.], Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 2001, p. 340).\n\nMarcus Tullius Cicero, De Re Publica, ed. Konrad Ziegler, Leipzig, Teubner, 1969, p. 132 (VI.19). “The ears of mortals are filled with this sound, but they are unable to hear it. Indeed, hearing is the dullest of the senses : consider the people who dwell in the region about the Great Cataract, where the Nile comes rushing down from lofty mountains ; they have lost their sense of hearing because of the loud roar. But the sound coming from the heavenly spheres revolving at very swift speeds is of course so great that human ears cannot catch it ; you might as well try to stare directly at the sun, whose rays are much too strong for your eyes” (transl. from Ambrosius Macrobius, Commentary on the Dream of Scipio, William Harris Stahl [trans. and ed.], New York, Columbia University Press, 1990, p. 74).\n\nThis difference is made explicit in Macrobius’s commentary on the Dream : “Then, too, we must not overlook the fact that we do not catch the sound of the music arising in the constant swirl of the spheres because it is too full to be taken into the narrow range of our ears. Indeed, if the Great Cataract of the Nile withholds the ominous thunder of its falls from the ears of the inhabitants, why is it surprising that the sound coming from the vastness of the universe surpasses our hearing ? No idle words were these [in the Dream] : What is this great and pleasing sound that fills my ears ? Cicero would have us understand that if the ears of a man who deserved to participate in the heavenly secrets were filled with the vastness of the sound, surely the hearing of other mortals would not catch the sound of celestial harmony” (Macrobius, Commentary, op. cit., p. 199-200).\n\nAnne-Marie Miller-Blaise, “« The name of Psalmes will speak for me ». Le rôle des psaumes dans la conception sidnéienne de la musique de la poésie”, Études Épistémè, 18, 2010, https://journals.openedition.org/episteme/646 (last accessed 24 July 2022), par. 11 : “C’est celui de la mimésis, de la représentation, qui dit qu’il demeure toujours un écart indépassable entre musique des sphères et chant humain”.\n\nSimeon K.

On the identification between music and poetry in a tract that was near-contemporary to Sidney’s Apologie, George Puttenham’s Arte of English Poesie, see Laïla Ghermani, “L’enargeia musicale ou les modalités d’une ut musica poesis dans The Arte of English Poesie de George Puttenham (1589)”, Études Épistémè, 18, 2010, https://journals.openedition.org/episteme/645 (last accessed 18 October 2021). The very fact that Shakespeare could re-state the identification in a popular comedy like The Merchant of Venice (in the last scene’s famous “touches of sweet harmony” speech) shows how commonplace it was (William Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice, ed. John Drakakis, London, Bloomsbury, 2010, 5.1.55-65).\n\nWolfram R. Keller, “‘Therout com so gret a noyse’ : The Harmony of the Spheres and Chaucerian Poetics”, in Jacomien Prins and Maude Vanhaelen (ed.), Sing Aloud Harmonious Spheres : Renaissance Conceptions of the Pythagorean Music of the Universe, New York, Routledge, 2018, p. 80-98, here p. 81.\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, The Riverside Chaucer, ed.

A. C. Hamilton et al., rev. second edition, London, Routledge, 2013. This passage, FQ VII.vii.9, directly refers to Chaucer’s Parlement of Foules. Spenser constructs his own poetic authority here by reference to Chaucer, who in turn references Cicero and Macrobius (see Craig A. Berry, “Propagating Authority : Poetic Tradition in The Parliament of Fowls and the Mutabilitie Cantos”, in Rachel Stenner, Tamsin Badcoe, and Gareth Griffiths (eds.), Rereading Chaucer and Spenser : Dan Geffrey with the New Poete, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2019, p. 212-223).\n\nJohn Dryden first attests to this relationship between the three poets : “Milton was the Poetical Son of Spencer […] : Spencer more than once insinuates, that the Soul of Chaucer was transfus’d into his Body ; and that he was begotten by him Two hundred years after his Decease. Milton has acknowledg’d to me, that Spencer was his Original” (Preface to Fables Ancient and Modern […], London, 1700, sig. *A.1.r.). In Areopagitica (1644), Milton acknowledged, perhaps with some irony, “our sage and serious Poet Spencer, whom I dare be known to think a better teacher then Scotus or Aquinas” (Areopagitica, in Complete Prose Works of John Milton : 1643–1648, ed. Ernest Sirluck, vol. 2 of Complete Prose Works of John Milton, New Haven, Conn., Yale University Press, 1959, p. 480-570, here p. 516). Further specific references by Spenser to Chaucer, and by Milton to Chaucer and Spenser, will be discussed below. On the relationship between the three poets, see, for instance, A. K. Hieatt, Chaucer, Spenser, Milton : Mythopoeic Continuities and Transformations, Montreal, MQUP, 1975, and Judith H. Anderson, Reading the Allegorical Intertext : Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, Milton, New York, Fordham UP, 2008. On Chaucer and Spenser, see Patrick G. Cheney, Spenser’s Famous Flight : A Renaissance Idea of a Literary Career, Toronto, University of Toronto Press, 1993, and Stenner, Badcoe, and Griffiths (ed.), Rereading Chaucer and Spenser, op. cit. ; on Spenser and Milton, see Maureen Quilligan, Milton’s Spenser : The Politics of Reading, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1983, and John Guillory, Poetic Authority : Spenser, Milton, and Literary History, New York, Columbia University Press, 1983. See Annabel M. Patterson, Reading between the Lines, Madison, Wis., University of Wisconsin Press, 1993, p. 36-56, for some qualifications of the “Spenser-and-Milton” pairing. For a comparative discussion of the three poets’ “cosmopoetics”, see Florian Klaeger, Reading into the Stars : Cosmopoetics in the Contemporary Novel, Heidelberg, Winter, 2018, p. 122-169.\n\nFor reasons of space, the issue of emulation or the imitation of poetic precedent, often raised in early modern reflections on mimesis, must be left aside here.\n\nSidney, Apologie, op. cit., sig. H.2.r. See Kenneth Borris, “Platonism and Spenser’s Poetic : Idealized Imitation, Merlin’s Mirror, and the Florimells”, Spenser Studies : A Renaissance Poetry Annual 24, 2009, p. 209-268, and Kenneth Borris, Visionary Spenser and the Poetics of Early Modern Platonism, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2017.\n\nPeter C. Herman, Squitter-Wits and Muse-Haters : Sidney, Spenser, Milton, and Renaissance Antipoetic Sentiment, Detroit, Wayne State UP, 1996.\n\nSee, for instance, Noam Reisner, Milton and the Ineffable, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2009.\n\nSee Caroline Levine, Forms. Whole, Hierarchy, Rhythm, Network, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2015. Levine argues that often “when forms meet, their collision produces unexpected consequences, results that cannot always be traced back to deliberate intentions or dominant ideologies” (ibid., 8).\n\nIbid., 39.\n\nThus, Stephen Gosson, in his 1579 attack against contemporary plays and poetry, The Schoole of Abuse (dedicated to Sidney), had stated : “Pythagoras […] condemnes them for fooles, that iudge Musike by sound and eare. If you will bee good Scholers, and profite well in the Arte of Musike, shut your fidels in their cases, and looke vppe to Heauen [to see illustrated there] : the order of the Spheres, the vnfallible motion of the Planets, the iuste course of the yeere [etc.]. The politike lawes, in wel gouerned common wealthes, that treade downe the proude, and vpholde the meeke [...] are excellent maisters to shewe you that this is right Musicke, this perfecte harmony” (The Shoole [sic] of Abuse, London, 1579, sig. 8.r-8.v.). Gosson presents the Renaissance cliché of the harmony of the spheres as an aesthetic and social ideal, based on the correspondence between macrocosm and microcosm. In the context of his treatise, it contributes to his appeal for art’s proper use and function – that is, to be socially and spiritually instructive (see Catherine Bates, On Not Defending Poetry, New York, Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 237). Harmonious order is deemed evident from the heavens, and this evidence is taken as proof for the legitimacy of social and aesthetic order, as well. Gosson’s inversion, by which political order is turned into an aesthetic ideal, only highlights the circular logic informing the correspondence (or homogeneity) between “above” and “below”.\n\nJohannes Kepler, Harmonice mundi, ed. Max Caspar and Walther v. Dyck, Gesammelte Werke 6, Munich, C. H. Beck, 1940, p. 328.\n\nIn his discussion of the trope in Sidney’s Apologie, Berley relates it to “conflicting biblical notions of the creation of man : one based on analogy, one based on synecdoche” (After the Heavenly Tune, op. cit., p. 54-55).\n\nBerley, After the Heavenly Tune, p. 56-57.\n\nThe modern association of Spenser’s style with musicality goes back to Coleridge (David S. Wilson-Okamura, “The Formalist Tradition”, in The Oxford Handbook of Edmund Spenser, ed. Richard A. McCabe, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 718-732, here p. 724).

Brown, The Art of The Faerie Queene, Manchester, Manchester University Press, 2019.\n\nSee John Hollander, “Music”, in A. C.

The 2009 volume of Spenser Studies, edited by Kenneth Borris, Jon Quitslund and Carol Kaske, constitutes a crucial reckoning with earlier approaches to “Spenser and Platonism” as much as a new departure.\n\nA. C. Hamilton, The Structure of Allegory in The Faerie Queene, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1961, p. 104-105. The use of structural doubles with a parodic function has long been identified as a key strategy in The Faerie Queene. Building on the work of Harry Berger (The Allegorical Temper. Vision and Reality in Book II of Spenser’s Faerie Queene, Yale, Yale University Press, 1957), Angus Fletcher (The Prophetic Moment. An Essay on Spenser, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1971), and Carol V. Kaske (Spenser and Biblical Poetics, Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press, 1999), critics have discussed the functions of various doublings or pairings, divisions, repetitions, echoes, etc. as narrative devices for “self-parody” and negotiations of selfhood as well as of poetics. As Linda Gregerson puts it, “The poem’s characters, […] unlike its readers, are not privy to the secrets of malicious disguise or false creation ; they encounter even the most blatant antitype or simulacrum as a fresh interpretive conundrum. Within the poem, virtue must learn its own nature by navigating the complex terrain of antipathy and alliance. Outside the poem, with a partial, but only a partial, interpretive advantage, the reader is invited to do the same. From either perspective, the image in the mirror is a cumulative composite” (“The Faerie Queene (1590)”, in The Oxford Handbook of Edmund Spenser, ed. Richard A. McCabe, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 198-217, p. 210). Most recently, this function of “discipline” has been discussed by Catherine Nicholson, Reading and Not Reading The Faerie Queene : Spenser and the Making of Literary Criticism, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2020.\n\nFQ I.i.1, editor’s note on line 8.\n\nOn the history of the term “musica coelestis”, see Reinhold Hammerstein Die Musik der Engel : Untersuchungen zur Musikanschauung des Mittelalters, 2nd, rev. ed., Berne, Francke, 1990, p. 135.\n\nEdmund Spenser, The Minor Poems, Part One, ed.

What begins promisingly with the harmonious hierarchy of the participating birds, ends disharmoniously in the parliamentary proceedings” (Wolfram R. Keller, “Disharmonic Spheres : Metapoetic Noise in Geoffrey Chaucer’s Parliament of Fowls”, in id. and Cornelia Wilde (eds.), Perfect Harmony and Melting Strains : Transformations of Music in Early Modern Culture between Sensibility and Abstraction, Berlin, de Gruyter, 2021, p. 11-37, here p. 33.\n\nJudith Anderson has stressed the ubiquitous presence of the Parlement in The Faerie Queene (Reading the Allegorical Intertext, op. cit., p. 135-153), identifying this passage as well and concluding that “[r]ecognizing such a benign source behind Spenser’s Bower confirms and complicates still further our response to its undeniable attractions, making all the more shocking the reductive violence of Guyon’s wrath” (p. 137-138).\n\nThis is part of Spenser’s negotiation, in the Bower, of the contrast between art and nature, encapsulated in stanzas 58 and 59, discussed below and widely from Berger’s Allegorical Temper, op. cit., to Angela D. Bullard, “Tempering the Intemperate in Spenser’s Bower of Bliss”, Spenser Studies : A Renaissance Poetry Annual 31-32 (2018), p. 167-187.\n\nHollander characterizes the “mixture of “natural music” with the artificial musical sounds of human voices and instruments” as a “morally unwholesome blending of […] musical categories” (“Mingled Measure”, art. cit., p. 229-230). On the ancient links between birds and winged musician angels, via Plato’s sirens and others, see Kathi Meyer-Baer, Music of the Spheres and the Dance of Death : Studies in Musical Iconology [1970], Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2015, p. 47-57.\n\nIn a passage that anticipates Sidney’s definition of “phantastic” poetry, the headmaster of Spenser’s school, Richard Mulcaster, explained the Puritan objections to music as “to[o] great a prouoker to vaine delites, still laying baite, to draw on pleasure : still opening the minde, to the entrie of lightnesse”, adding that “in matters of religion also, to some it seemes offensiue, bycause it carieth awaye the eare, with the sweetnesse of the melodie, and bewitcheth the minde with a Syrenes sounde, pulling it from that delite, wherin of duetie it ought to dwell, vnto harmonicall fantasies, and withdrawing it, from the best meditations, and most vertuous thoughtes to forreine conceites, and wandring deuises” (Positions, London, 1581, p. 38). Mulcaster dismissed these objections, but Spenser seems to explore them in this passage.\n\nSee the discussion of the same passage in John Hollander, The Untuning of the Sky : Ideas of Music in English Poetry : 1500—1700, New York, Norton, 1970, p. 112-113.\n\nCompare also the beast-men the Palmer transforms back into human shape at the end of the canto : these victims of Acrasia’s spell disturb the boundary between human and animal not only physically but also mentally, as their brute bodies are shaped “According to their minds like monstrous” (FQ II.xii.85). Concluding the book on this note drives home the point, as Guyon observes : “See the mind of beastly man, / That hath so soone forgot the excellence / Of his creation, when he life began, / That now he chooseth, with vile difference, / To be a beast, and lacke intelligence” (FQ II.xii.87). The “vile difference” that mixes perfection and fallenness stems from a free choice between excellence and monstrosity.\n\nSee, e.g., Richard A. McCabe, Spenser’s Monstrous Regiment : Elizabethan Ireland and the Poetics of Difference, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002, p. 121-141, and recently, Thomas Herron, “Mixed Up : Race, Degeneration, and Irish ‘Old English’ Politics in Spenser’s Castle Joyous and Bower of Bliss”, Spenser Studies : A Renaissance Poetry Annual 35, 2021, p. 69-105. I discuss the historiographical aspects of Book II’s “Irish dimension” in Florian Kläger, Forgone Nations. Constructions of National Identity in Elizabethan Historiography and Literature : Stanihurst, Spenser, Shakespeare, Trier, WVT, 2006, p. 141-172.\n\nStephen Greenblatt, Renaissance Self-Fashioning : From More to Shakespeare, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1980, p. 183. See the important qualifications to Greenblatt’s argument in Harry Berger, Resisting Allegory : Interpretive Delirium in Spenser’s Faerie Queene, ed. David L. Miller, New York, Fordham University Press, 2020, p. 137-139.\n\nThis is borne out by the proem to Book V, in which the poet laments that the very order of the heavens as observed from earth (the constellations making up the zodiac), is “wandred farre from where it first was pight” (FQ V.i.4) : “So now all range, and doe at randon rove / Out of their proper places farre away, / And all this world with them amisse doe move, / And all his creatures from their course astray, / Till they arrive at their last ruinous decay” (FQ V.i.6).\n\nConsider, in this context, Spenser’s own stanzaic form, invented for The Faerie Queene : each stanza runs to nine lines, recalling the number of the Muses, the Ptolemaic spheres, and the angelic orders (Borris, Visionary Spenser, op. cit., p. 53). What is more, the first and last lines were set apart typographically ; with seven lines indented between them. The first eight lines are pentameters, the final line is an alexandrine. The seven indented lines recall the seven classical planets, the outermost lines might then represent the sphere of the fixed stars at the top and, at the bottom, earth. This last line differs metrically from the other eight, inscribing the difference between the sublunary and superlunary worlds into the very fabric of the poem, as each stanza offers a “little world” or image of the cosmos in itself. The rhyme scheme is ABABBCBCC : there are thus two A rhymes, three C rhymes, and four B rhymes. These numerical attributes thus cover almost all numbers on the “Platonic lambda” of heavenly harmony (“the mixture arising out of these seven numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 27] brought about the generation of the World-Soul at the behest of the Creator” [Macrobius, Commentary, op. cit, I.vi.46, p. 109]), but stop short of completing it fully – the third uneven number, 27, is left out. The very fabric of the poem, its stanzaic form, offers a glimpse of Platonic harmony, but purposefully does not undertake to complete it, thus maintaining the boundary between the perfect heavens and the flawed sublunary realm.\n\nThe problematic relationship between entertainment and instruction is spelled out in Spenser’s “Letter of the Authors” (1590), in which the poet concedes that “historical fiction” is delightful to the readers of his day, but he stresses that he chose this form (as a kind of honeyed pill) for that reason – to achieve his goal of “fashion[ing] a gentleman or noble person in virtuous and gentle discipline” (Faerie Queene, ed. cit., p. 714-718, here p. 714). Entertainment, then, is clearly in the service of instruction. Cp. Berger, Resisting Allegory, op. cit., 141-142.\n\nAcrasia is not killed, but enchained by Guyon – temptation cannot, and must not, be done away with here below. Contrast to this complex meta-poetic use of the trope in a colonial context Ben Jonson’s rather more conventional application, in his Irish Masque at Court (first performed 1613). Here, a bard of Ireland is introduced to the king (James himself, for whom the masque was performed) : “This is that James of which long since thou sung’st / Should end our country’s most unnatural broils ; / And if her ear, then deafened with the drum, / Would stoop but to the music of his peace, / She need not with the spheres change harmony” (Ben Jonson, The Irish Masque at Court, ed. David Lindley, in David Bevington et al. (gen. ed.), The Cambridge Edition of the Works of Ben Jonson 4, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 243-250, here p. 249 [ll. 129-133]). The colony is unable to hear the music of the spheres, not because it is inaudible or too loud, but owing to the noise of war. However, submitting to the monarch’s pacifying “music” would suffice to “tune” Ireland into celestial harmony, which is identified with political accord. James apotheotically turns into a mediatory figure, channelling the music of the spheres to the sublunary realm. The bard’s role here is reduced to prophetic approval.\n\nKeller, “Disharmonic Spheres”, art. cit., p. 12.\n\nNicholas McDowell, Poet of Revolution : The Making of John Milton, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2020, p. 14 and p. 143.\n\nJohn Milton, In Scholis Publicis : De Sphaerarum Concentu, London, 1674, p. 83-87, here p. 83. “I beg you, my hearers, not to take this theory as seriously intended” (Delivered in the Public Schools : On the Harmony of the Spheres, in Complete Prose Works of John Milton 1, ed.

Wolfe, New Haven, Yale University Press, 1953, p. 234-239, here p. 234).\n\nMilton, Harmony, ed. cit., p. 234-236.\n\nIbid., p. 239.\n\nIbid.\n\nDavid Ainsworth, Milton, Music and Literary Interpretation : Reading Through the Spirit, New York, Routledge, 2020, p. 88. Ainsworth compellingly links this idea to the nature of the Holy Spirit, which “Milton understands […] as God’s means of filling in those gaps within the hearts of believers. And music, poetry, and prophecy blend together to allow a similar substitution for that which awaits fulfillment ; by incompletely expressing the inexpressible, these modes of thought permit humanity to reach toward salvation through an attempt to comprehend in part God’s ineffable design and, thus, attune themselves better as parts of it” (ibid., p. 91-92). Ainsworth’s book thus situates the present topic in the important context of Milton’s anti-trinitarianism.\n\nSee, for instance, Diane K. McColley, Poetry and Music in Seventeenth-Century England, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 175-217 ; Berley, After the Heavenly Tune, op. cit., p. 141-205 ; Andrew Mattison, “Sweet Imperfection : Milton and the Troubled Metaphor of Harmony”, Modern Philology 106.4, 2009, p. 617-647 ; Seth Herbst, “Milton and Music”, Essays in Criticism 66.1, 2016, p. 96-116 ; Erin Minear, Reverberating Song in Shakespeare and Milton : Language, Memory, and Musical Representation, London, Routledge, 2016, p. 165-256 ; Ainsworth, Milton, Music, op. cit., passim.\n\nJohn Milton, “On the Morning of CHRISTS Nativity : Compos’d 1629”, in Poems of Mr. John Milton, London, 1645, p. 1-12. The poem is quoted in the following, by line, after John Milton, “On the Morning of CHRISTS Nativity. Compos’d 1629”, in The Shorter Poems, ed. Barbara K. Lewalski and Estelle Haan, The Complete Works of John Milton 3, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012, p. 5-13. Among the early poems utilizing the trope of the music of the spheres, the Ode is most fruitfully compared to “At a Solemn Music”, with its emphatic celebration of earthly music imitating celestial music (see, e.g., Ainsworth, Milton, Music, op. cit., p. 32-37).\n\nNoam Reisner, “The Poetic Promise of ‘On the Morning of Christ’s Nativity’”, in Thomas N. Corns (ed.), A New Companion to Milton, Chichester, John Wiley & Sons, 2016, p. 230-240, here 237.\n\nReverberating Song, op. cit., p. 183.\n\nPoet of Revolution, op. cit., p. 173. For an in-depth discussion of the debt to Spenser in the Ode (“something of a summa of Milton’s experiments with Spenserian closure”), see Kenneth Gross, “‘Each Heav’nly Close’ : Mythologies and Metrics in Spenser and the Early Poetry of Milton”, PMLA : Publications of the Modern Language Association of America 98.1, 1983, p. 21-36, here p. 29 (but see passim).\n\nEach stanza of the Hymn consists of eight lines : “two iambic trimeter couplets that are interrupted by a pentameter, and […] a final rhyming couplet that joins one tetrameter line and a longer closing hexameter” (Maggie Kilgour, “Harnessing Angels : The Pattern of Rhyme in Milton’s Nativity Ode”, Milton Quarterly, 54.1, 2020, p. 41-53, here p. 44). Recalling what has been said above about the Platonic lambda informing the Faerie Queene stanza, cp. Røstvig’s claim that “the structure of Milton’s Nativity Ode is patterned after this Platonic lambda, its 27 8-line stanzas representing the two impulses issuing from the One. This presupposes that the poet, before setting pen to paper, conceived an archetypal pattern in his mind, a pattern whose numerical proportions were those of the harmonious universe itself” (“The Hidden Sense”, art. cit., p. 44).\n\nOn Milton’s use of music, “as a communal exercise of harmonious association”, to “both inspire[] and metaphorically represent[] heavenly rapture”, see David Ainsworth, “Rapturous Milton and the Communal Harmony of Faith”, Milton Quarterly 47.3, 2013, p. 149-162, here p. 149.\n\nCatherine Belsey points out that “unexpressive” signifies, not only inexpressibility, but also that the song is “not expressive, not, that is, a sign of a presence which is elsewhere” – it is not, itself, mimetic (John Milton : Language, Gender, Power, New York, Blackwell, 1988, p. 4).\n\nSpitzer, Classical and Christian Ideas, op. cit., p. 103. For a fuller discussion, see McColley, Poetry and Music, op. cit., p. 185-192.

Shawcross (eds.), Language and Style in Milton. A Symposium in Honor of the Tercentenary of Paradise Lost, New York, Frederick Ungar, 1967, p. 154-192, here p. 161-162.\n\nThe archaic prefix in “ychain’d” (l. 155) signals Milton’s debt to Spenser and his medieval model, Chaucer. The “horrid clang” (l. 157) of sinful reality intrudes upon the perfect music, disrupting it and suspending it until the final judgment. As Teskey points out, the polymath Milton would have been well aware of the Latin and Greek root of the term “clang” signifying “noise” (Poetry, op. cit., p. 60).\n\nAs the “old Dragon” slithers away, he “Swindges the scaly Horrour of his foulded tail” (ll. 168, 172) ; Apollo leaves “With hollow shreik” (l. 178), the spirits of the heathen dead “moan” (l. 191) and “A drear, and dying sound” is heard in the temples (l. 193) ; Moloch’s cymbals ring “In vain” (l. 208), as do the “Timbrel’d Anthems dark” of Osiris’s priests (l. 219). Moreover, the mountains resound with “A voice of weeping […] and loud lament” (l. 183) as “The parting Genius is with sighing sent” and the nymphs “mourn” (ll. 186, 188).\n\nKilgour, “Harnessing Angels”, art. cit., p. 47.
