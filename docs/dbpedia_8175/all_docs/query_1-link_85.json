        "text": "Edmund Charles Blunden CBE (1 November 1896 - 20 January 1974) was an English poet and literary critic.\n\nLife[]\n\nOverview[]\n\nLike his friend Siegfried Sassoon, Blunden wrote of his experiences in World War I in both verse and prose. For most of his career, Blunden was also a reviewer for English publications and an academic in Tokyo and later Hong Kong. He ended his career as Professor of Poetry at the University of Oxford.\n\nLife[]\n\nYouth and World War I[]\n\nBorn in London, Blunden was the eldest of the 9 children of Georgina Margaret (Tyler) and Charles Edmund Blunden (1871-1951) and his wife, , who were joint-headteachers of a London school.[1][2]\n\nBlunden was educated at Christ's Hospital and Queen's College, Oxford.[3]\n\nIn August 1915 Blunden was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant in the Royal Sussex Regiment[1] and served with them right up to the end of World War I, taking part in the actions at Ypres and the Somme, and winning the Military Cross in the process. Unusually for a junior infantry officer, Blunden survived nearly 2 years in the front line without physical injury, but for the rest of his life bore mental scars from his experiences.[1] With characteristic self-deprecation he attributed his survival to his diminutive size: he made \"an inconspicuous target\".[4]\n\nAlthough he wrote war poems, he avoided the graphic edge that characterises the work of Sassoon or Wilfred Owen, and his memoirs of war service, though beautifully written, lack the immediacy of those of Sassoon or Robert Graves . His own account of his frequently traumatic experiences was published in 1928 under the title Undertones of War.[2]\n\nCareer[]\n\nBlunden left the army in 1919 and took up the scholarship at Oxford that he had won while still at school.[1] On the same English Literature course was Robert Graves, and the two were close friends during their time at Oxford together, but Blunden found university life unsatisfactory and left in 1920 to take up a literary career, at first acting as assistant to Middleton Murry on the Athenaeum magazine.[2] An early supporter was Siegfried Sassoon, who became a lifelong friend. In 1920 Blunden published a collection of poems, The Waggoner, and with Alan Porter edited the poems of John Clare (mostly from Clare's manuscript)[1][2]\n\nBlunden's next book of poems, The Shepherd, published in 1922 won the Hawthornden Prize, but his poetry, though well reviewed, did not provide enough to live on, and in 1924 he accepted the post of Professor of English at the University of Tokyo. He returned to England in 1927, and was literary editor of Nation magazine for a year. In 1927 he published a short book, On the Poems of Henry Vaughan, Characteristics and Intimations, with his principal Latin poems carefully translated into English verse (London: H. Cobden-Sanderson, 1927), expanding and revising an essay that he had published in November 1926 in the London Mercury.\n\nIn 1931 he returned to Oxford as a Fellow of Merton College, where he was highly regarded as a tutor.[1] During his years in Oxford, Blunden published extensively: several collections of poetry including Choice or Chance (1934) and Shells by a Stream (1944), prose works on Charles Lamb; Edward Gibbon; Keats's publisher; Percy Bysshe Shelley; John Taylor; and Thomas Hardy; and a book about a game he loved, Cricket Country (1944).[2] He returned to full-time writing in 1944, becoming assistant editor of the Times Literary Supplement. In 1947 he returned to Japan as a member of the British liaison mission in Tokyo. In 1953, after three years back in England he accepted the post of Professor of English Literature at the University of Hong Kong.[1]\n\nBlunden retired in 1964 and settled in Suffolk. In 1966 he was nominated for the Oxford Professorship of Poetry in succession to Robert Graves; with some misgivings he agreed to stand and was elected by a large majority over the other candidate, Robert Lowell. However, he now found the strain of public lecturing too much for him, and after 2 years he resigned.[1]\n\nHe died of a heart attack at his home at Long Melford, Suffolk, on 20 January 1974, and is buried in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford.\n\nPrivate life[]\n\nBlunden was married 3 times. While still in the army he met and married Mary Daines in 1918. They had 3 children, the eldest of whom died in infancy. They divorced in 1931, and in 1933 Blunden married Sylva Norman, a young novelist and critic. That marriage, which was childless, was dissolved in 1945, and in the same year he married Claire Margaret Poynting, a former pupil of his; they had four daughters. Blunden then met Aki Hayashi in Japan, and Aki moved to England with Blunden. The relation later changed from a partner to a friend, but they remained in contact for the rest of her life.[1]\n\nBlunden's love of cricket, celebrated in his book Cricket Country, is described by the biographer Philip Ziegler as fanatical. Blunden and his friend Rupert Hart-Davis regularly opened the batting for a publisher's eleven in the 1930s (Blunden insisted on batting without gloves).[5] An affectionate obituary tribute in The Guardian commented, \"He loved cricket ... and played it ardently and very badly\",[4] while in a review of Cricket Country, George Orwell described him as \"the true cricketer\":\n\nThe test of a true cricketer is that he shall prefer village cricket to 'good' cricket [.... Blunden's] friendliest memories are of the informal village game, where everyone plays in braces, where the blacksmith is liable to be called away in mid-innings on an urgent job, and sometimes, about the time when the light begins to fail, a ball driven for four kills a rabbit on the boundary.[6]\n\nBlunden had a robust sense of humor. In Hong Kong he relished linguistic misunderstandings such as those of the restaurant that offered \"fried prawn's balls\" and the schoolboy who wrote, \"In Hong Kong there is a queer at every bus-stop.\"[7]\n\nHis fellow poets' regard for Blunden was illustrated by the contributions to a dinner in his honour for which poems were specially written by Cecil Day-Lewis and William Plomer; T.S. Eliot and Walter de la Mare were guests; and Siegfried Sassoon provided the burgundy.[8]\n\nWriting[]\n\nIn a 2009 appreciation of Cricket Country and its author, Bangalore writer Suresh Menon writes:\n\nAny cricket book that talks easily of Henry James and Siegfried Sassoon and Ranji and Grace and Richard Burton (the writer, not the actor) and Coleridge is bound to have a special charm of its own. As Blunden says, \"The game which made me write at all, is not terminated at the boundary, but is reflected beyond, is echoed and varied out there among the gardens and the barns, the dells and the thickets, and belongs to some wider field. Perhaps that is what all books on cricket are trying to say.\"[9]\n\nRecognition[]\n\nBlunden's public honors included Commander of the Order of the British Empire, 1951; the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry , 1956; The Royal Society of Literature's Benson Medal; the Order of the Rising Sun, 3rd Class (Japan), 1963; and Honorary Membership of the Japan Academy.[3]\n\nOn 11 November 1985, Blunden was among 16 Great War poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Poet's Corner in Westminster Abbey[10] The inscription on the stone was written by fellow Great War poet, Wilfred Owen. It reads: \"My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.\"[11]\n\nPublications[]\n\nPoetry[]\n\nPoems, 1913 and 1914.
