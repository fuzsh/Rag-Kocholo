        "text": "I had the privilege to take part in an International Leaders Seminar in Maui, Hawaii, in January, 1998.\n\nIt was a very blessed and intense experience in my life. After that, my ministry was so impacted then I started to multiply the Haggai International teaching through of several leader seminaries in my country, Brazil.\n\nNow I’m living in USA and I keep teaching and training leader to the Kingdom of God.\n\nI’m so grateful to Dr. John Haggai and his courage in carrying his vision with faithfulness and compassion!\n\nJohn Edmund Haggai – A time to cry or Rejoice?\n\nThis day (November 18 in US, November 19 in few other places) marks the end of a man named Dr. John Edmund Haggai.\n\n“Attempt something so great for God, that it’s doomed to failure unless God be in it!”\n\nThe most famous quote of Dr. Haggai, keeps ringing in the ear and in the walls of the Mid Pacific Centre. When I first heard the news of his demise, there were a few thoughts ringing in my mind.\n\nShould I be sad??? Cry?? Mourn? Be happy? Or Rejoice! (Even worse!)\n\nSome people are uncertain where they may go after their death. But a few group of people who identify themselves as Christians (those who believe in Lord Jesus Christ) are not shaken when it comes to their final stage of life. It is because they are ready to meet their maker, the creator of Heaven and Earth!\n\nAlso, they leave with a sense of satisfaction, leaving behind a vision which has been shared, and their responsibility on Earth is over. Basically their job on earth is over and they have received an eternal promotion!\n\nDr. Haggai did leave behind a legacy, he sowed the seeds of his vision to multiple young men and women. There are thousands of people being equipped to share the word of God and to share the Love of Christ.\n\nMatthew 13:31-32\n\n“He told them another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.”\n\nVision is like a small seed. But it has the power to grow a BIG empire of people! I am sure Dr. Haggai did that.\n\nWhen we approach our final seconds of this mortal life (our dying moments), Do we regret all the things we could have done? Or have the satisfaction that we return to the grave empty? Finishing all the works assigned to us.\n\nWhen Dr. Haggai has left us on this “International Mens day” though Earth mourns, Heaven would rejoice. He would have taken his flight to the heavenliness in the Chariots of fire, with his visa being approved by the blood of the lamb and his name found in the book of life!!!\n\nDo we cry or rejoice?"
