        "text": "Just As I Am\n\nThe copyright for this piece is 1895, a time in which Aldous was the director of the Hamilton School of music (1889-1908).\n\nThe final page of the score includes samples for other sacred works published by Whaley, Royce & Co's.\n\nThe inscription on the score appears to be a name, followed with, \"with the composer's kind regard\". The piece is dedicated to Miss G. Counsell; thus, a relationship between the two is possible. The inscription suggests a personal but professional relationship.\n\nGrant we Beseech Thee\n\nThe stamp “Ascension Church Hamilton” links this copy of the work to Church of the Ascension. According to the Canadian encyclopedia, Aldous was never employed here, but the church did obtain the organ that was installed in St. Thomas’ Anglican Church. Aldous was employed both in St Thomas, Ontario and at a church called St. Thomas in Hamilton. The organ, which had 1734 speaking pipes, would have had tremendous appeal to someone with J.E.P’s musical interests. Because of the reconstruction of the church and the financial difficulties, finding the installation date of the organ in St. Thomas was proved unsuccessful; however, speculation that these two churches are linked through an organ of interest to J.E.P is possible.\n\nThe work has no publishing or copyright date, but sports “Hamilton, Canada” as well as the title “B.A” after his name. He earned his BA in 1876, thus the work’s publication was likely after this date, before he earned his credentials as an educator (sometime between 1876 and 1884, when he founded the Hamilton Orchestral Club). The text is a collect for the 21st Sunday after Trinity, which can be found in The Book of Common Prayer. Anglican churches often use the text and service material from the Book of Common Prayer; thus, its composition was likely inspired by Aldous’ position at St. Thomas.\n\nAn Entry from the Hamilton Herald\n\nIn the year of 1876, J.E.P Aldous, A.B, was appointed organist and choirmaster of Trinity College, Cambridge: previous to accepting that position he had been honorary secretary of the Cambridge University Musical Society and also organist of the British embassy, Paris. In 1877 an advertisement appeared [illegible] an organist for Central Presbyterian Church, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Mr. Aldous applied for and secured the appointment. He was not long in the city before inaugurated a series of pianoforte recitals, there taking place in St. James' Reformed Episcopal Church and in the hall of the Y.M.C.A West King Street: the vocalist was called Miss Barr. In 1879, Mr. Adamson and Mr. Aldous arranged to give a series of six concerts; these took place in the school rooms of St. Thomas' Church and Ascension Church respectively. Mrs. Adamson was an accomplished violinist, and her playing was greatly appreciated.\n\nIf the reader has pursued the life of Charles Dickens he will doubtless remember that the famous writer when on his way to give a series of readings from his own works in the United States passed through this neighborhood. He refers to the fact that he never saw so many \"meat markets\" and \"merchants\" in small towns before. Every village store was either one or the other of the class mentioned. A similar idea possibly struck Mr. Aldous with regard to \"professors\", they were so prolific in this city. Tailors, barbers and corn extractors were all known by this term. It was not long before the new arrival found his name appearing in the city papers as Professor Aldous. He at once wrote an open letter to the journals disclaiming the title, and this caused a little gossip for the \"professors\"\n\nTaken from: Hamilton Herald, author unlisted, September 3,1901"
