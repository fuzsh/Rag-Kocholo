        "text": "What a treat to encounter Rubbra’s glorious Violin Concerto played by the work’s Budapest-born dedicatee Endré Wolf (1913-2011). This February 1960 broadcast from Maida Vale under Rudolf Schwarz’s baton was only its second performance, the world premiere having taken place three days previously at the Royal Festival Hall. A memorably unforced display it proves, too, plumbing the genuine depths of rapt expression particularly in the ravishing central ‘Poema’ which evinces such a striking kinship with the sublime’ Canto’ slow movement of the Sixth Symphony from 1954. There’s the odd tiny slip and some occasional background swish to contend with but it remains a cherishable document and must be deemed an essential supplement to the concerto’s three commercial recordings from Krysia Osostowicz -(Naxos, 11/05), Carl Pini (Unicorn-Kanchana, 1/87 – nla)- the last -named’s marvellously lucid alliance with Vernon Handley and the RPO being especially praiseworthy (any chance of a reissue, I wonder?)\n\nThere’s more buried treasure in the shape of a spirited account of the imposing Sinfonia concertante for piano and orchestra that Rubbra originally completed in 1936 and comprehensively overhauled in the early 1940’s. The composer himself participated in the first performance with Adrian Boult and the BBC SO at an August 1943 Prom and the present BBC broadcast from May 1967 with the CBSO under Hugo Rignold serves as a splendid reminder of his interpretative skills. What a powerful work it is, too, culminating in a deeply felt prelude and fugue inscribed to the memory of Holst (with whom Rubbra had studied at Reading University and the Royal College of Music).\n\nIt’s followed here by another Prelude and Fugue, this time for solo piano and based on a theme from the First Piano Sonata by Rubbra’s boyhood teacher, Cyril Scott (1879-1970). Rubbra affords it affectingly serene treatment, as he does Scott’s searching Consolation (1918). Both these items come from a recital transmitted by the BBC in August 1967. Transfers from Richard Itter’s off-air mono tapes have been most judiciously managed and Paul Conway’s copious notes are a real boon. All in all, an issue to savour.Gramophone\n\nLyrita have been digging down again in the mine that is the Itter Broadcast Collection and they have returned with more buried treasure in the form of these Rubbra performances. The two major works have been recorded in modern times and with the advantage of up to date sound but there is nonetheless great interest in these archive performances, not least in the presence of Rubbra himself at the keyboard. As is evident from his performances here, Edmund Rubbra was no mean pianist and we learn from Paul Conway’s invaluable notes that as a teenager he had fallen under the spell of the music of Cyril Scott to such an extent that he organised a concert of music by that composer."
