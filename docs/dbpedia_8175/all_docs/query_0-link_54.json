She even volunteered as a music teacher in her children’s school. Her patients encouraged her to join the Cabrillo Symphonic Chorus, where she has been a singer for 30 years.\n\nSinging with the Santa Cruz Symphony exposed Deborah to the value of local symphonic music, and after becoming a docent for the Symphony’s musician visits to schools she was hooked on the Symphony’s mission.

His thoughts about the Symphony and its mission: \"We are both a governing body for a community organization and a part of a magical artistic experience. When I attend a concert, I enjoy the camaraderie of my fellow board members. They are creative and collegial, problem solvers with smiles. And there is then the magic created by Daniel Stewart and his fellow musical artists in their exacting interpretations of the Masters. Being a part of that phenomenon, even a small and attenuated part, is a joy and a fulfillment of an enjoyable life.”\n\nMary Ann Orr\n\nSymphony League Co-President\n\nMary Ann Orr moved to the Santa Cruz area in the late 1980s when she and her husband Peter started a strawberry company, Pacific Gold Farms.

She is a flag officer of the Santa Cruz Yacht Club, Vice Commodore in 2021, and was Commodore in 2022.\n\nShe has served on several boards in Santa Cruz County. She was co-chair of the Cabrillo College Foundation President’s Circle Committee in 2020-2022; President of the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History, where she greenlighted the Abbott Square Market project in 2012; Vice President of Big Brothers Big Sisters Santa Cruz Chapter where she recommended petitioning to take over the Day on the Monterey Bay Regatta; the UC Santa Cruz Alumni Association; and the Case Management Society of America. Vance holds a BA degree in Psychology from UC Santa Cruz and a MA degree in Marriage, Family and Child Counseling from Azusa Pacific University.\n\nHer favorite quotes are from Plato: “Rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places in the soul,” and from Maya Angelou: “Music was my refuge. I could crawl into the space between the notes and curl my back to loneliness.”\n\nRon Sekkel\n\nAfter his family moved to the U.S. from Argentina when Ron Sekkel was 8, he carved a pathway to success by earning a BA from UCLA, Lieutenant stripes in the US Navy Supply Corps, a second BA and an MA from Cal State in Long Beach. His education and service experience enabled him to become an Enrolled Agent in the early 1980’s.\n\nAs an Enrolled Agent (EA) he could represent taxpayers to the IRS. Ron not only established his own Income Tax and Representation Practice, in the 1990s he served on a task force of EAs tasked with benefitting taxpayers.\n\nHe is always service-minded and today volunteers as the Santa Cruz County Treasury Oversight Committee Chair. Equally important to Ron, he joined Rotary in 1977 and is currently active in the Rotary Club of Scotts Valley. He has been a District Governor and worked to make significant improvements and changes to the international organization. He is also on the Board of RotaCare Bay Area that delivers free medical services.\n\nRon and his wife Cindy have been regulars at Santa Cruz Symphony performances since 1986. He calls Cindy his “better three-fourths” and she supports all of his activities. Ron joined the Board of the Symphony in 2018\n\nDennis St. Peter\n\nDennis St. Peter joined the Santa Cruz Symphony Board in 2023. Dennis St Peter first discovered the joys of symphonic music with his wife, Alice Kollman, when they lived in Santa Barbara in 1977. Four times a year, Zubin Mehta and the Los Angeles Symphony would visit the historic Mission Revival style Arlington Theater, where one could imagine being in a Spanish courtyard, complete with houses, staircases, balconies, and the stars above! It was truly magical. Later, when Dennis and Alice moved to Santa Cruz in 1980, they were delighted to become ardent fans of the Santa Cruz Symphony, first under the tutelage of Larry Granger and now blessedly under Daniel Stewart for the past 10 years. It has been amazing to see the extraordinary growth in talent and repertoire, thanks to the musicians and their maestro.\n\nDennis grew up in the Northeast. His love of chemistry and mathematics led him to choose chemical engineering as a major in college, only to discover that he really wanted to work more with people. He chose medical school so that he could become a psychiatrist and attend to people’s emotional needs and hopefully make a difference in people’s lives. He spent seven years doing general/family practice, thinking that was a broader societal need, only to realize in the end that psychiatry was his true calling. And so, 42 years later, he still enjoys working as an outpatient psychotherapist, adding in a little medication when needed. That time spent in general practice turned out to be most useful!\n\nOther than the symphony, Dennis’ primary passion is hiking. He has led hiking tours with Alice and their son Michael over the last 30 years to Switzerland, Norway, Argentina, and Morocco. He has also become an enthusiastic supporter of Music in May, Family Service Association, Survivors Healing Center, and the Santa Cruz AIDS Project. And to make sure he isn’t too sane, he closely follows national and world politics.\n\nDennis agreed to join the Board because he regards the Symphony to be one of the finest treasures in Santa Cruz County. He very much wants to help turn on those who are missing out, so the magic can continue to expand. He is, after all, still a child of the ’60s!\n\nNancy Van Natta\n\nNancy Van Natta grew up in Connecticut where she loved exploring the natural beauty around her childhood home. She earned her BA at Case Western Reserve University, her MA at Simmons College, and nine-tenths of an MBA at Santa Clara University. She has two now-grown children with families of their own and four wonderful young adult grandchildren. She and her husband live three doors away from their daughter and her family.\n\nNancy began her career as a corporate marketing executive where she could employ her love for clear communication and beautiful design. As Vice President of Corporate Marketing at Logitech during its startup years, Nancy created the company’s corporate identity and launched its consumer product line into the market. Later, as Vice President of Marketing at consumer software company Mindscape, she launched products for LEGO, National Geographic, Doonesbury, and others.\n\nIn 2001 Nancy opened her interior architecture and design practice focused on home design and commercial projects including office, hospitality, and senior living projects. She and her dedicated team continue to work on wonderful projects throughout the Bay Area.\n\nNancy’s work life has been based on careful listening and a love for beauty – qualities she brings to her work with the Santa Cruz Symphony. She is dedicated to the success of the symphony as an arts organization and to supporting the artistry of its musicians.\n\nMatt Wetstein\n\nMatt Wetstein moved to the Santa Cruz area in 2018 when he was named President of Cabrillo College. A native of East St. Louis, Illinois, he earned his PhD in political science in 1993 from Northern Illinois University. He followed his partner (now spouse) Cindy Ostberg to California when she took a teaching job at University of the Pacific in Stockton.\n\nMatt secured a teaching job at Delta College in Stockton, and later became a Dean and Vice President of Instruction there. He and Cindy are active researchers who write about the politics of judicial decision-making, especially in the Supreme Court of Canada and U.S. appellate courts. Even though they are not Canadians, they have written several books and more than a dozen articles on judicial behavior in Canada.\n\nWhen he is not working at Cabrillo College or serving on the Santa Cruz Symphony Board, Matt devotes his time to many causes in the community, including the United Way, Rotary Club of Capitola-Aptos, Santa Cruz County Business Council, Chamber of Commerce, Sutter-PAMF Community Advisory Board, and Agri-Culture, a nonprofit dedicated to agricultural education.\n\nMatt started listening to orchestral music as a teenager and today likes all forms of music. He says, “I especially enjoy the symphony concerts because of the incredible teamwork and musicianship, and because they deliver such a powerful emotional feeling when it all comes together.” Matt joined the Symphony Board in 2018 and is active on the Education Committee. “I love the connection the Symphony has with local schools through the Link Up Program.”"
