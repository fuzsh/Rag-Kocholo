        "text": "Sample Podcast\n\nWhat is a “podcast”?\n\nSimply put: a podcast is an audio program, just like Talk Radio, but you subscribe to it on your smartphone or other device (like a laptop or desktop computer), and listen to it whenever you like.\n\nHow do they work? And how do you listen to them?\n\nIn a little more detail, a podcast is a series of spoken word, audio episodes, all focused on a particular theme, in our case, our orchestra and topics pertaining to the orchestra and the music scene. You can subscribe to the Summerville Ochestra podcast show on your phone or computer with an app.\n\nFor more information on how to listen to a podcast, click here.\n\nThe easiest way to listen? Go to whichever of these apps is your preferred one, and search for “Get to Know Your S.O.!” or simply go here. From there, you can listen to any episode, past or present, by scrolling to it and hitting play! It is that simple! By hitting “Subscribe,” you will automatically be updated as to when new episodes are released, so you never have to miss one."
