        "text": "Verify, verify, I say unto you\n\nMuch spin surrounded the launch of BBC Verify which fact-checks and counters disinformation in external sources. So let's hope the same forensic analysis is applied to the BBC's own contributors .\n\nMaster musician who experienced the pain of genius\n\nOn that sleeve for his 1985 recording of the Goldberg Variations , Scott Ross is seen standing in the grounds of Château d'Assas in Languedoc. It was here that many of the harpsichordist's great recordings were made. Then, as today, the château dwelt in the twilight zone between grandeur and dereliction, and thirty years ago the recording sessions were regularly interrupted by the sound of rats scurrying across the floor. Scott Ross was born in Pittsburgh in 1951, and moved to France with his mother following the death of his father in 1964. He studied at the conservatoires in Nice and Paris, and first came to Château d'Assas in 1969 to give music lessons to the grandson of its owner Mme. Simone Demangel . When an early music academy was established at the Château d'Assas, Scott Ross gave masterclasses and became a frequent visitor. At first he stayed in a room in one of the towers, but from 1983 he rented a small house across the road from the château. The photos b\n\nAll aboard the Martinu bandwagon\n\nDepressing, but predictable, to see the mainstream media scrambling aboard the Bohuslav Martinů bandwagon as soon as BBC Radio 3 announces a cycle of his superb symphonies . Equally depressing, but a sign of the times, to see the Independent publishing an appreciation of the composer's symphonies by a writer who confesses elsewhere to never having heard a single note of them. As Norman Lebrecht famously wrote in the Evening Standard back in 2006: ‘... until bloggers deliver hard facts … paid for newspapers will continue to set the standard as the only show in town’. Sadly the hard facts now show that Norman is no longer at the Evening Standard , and, as from next Monday, the Evening Standard will no longer be a paid for newspaper . But you can find pre-bandwagon appreciations of Martinů here and here . Any copyrighted material on these pages is included as \"fair use\", for the purpose of study, review or critical analysis only, and will be removed at the request of\n\nTo be a musician is to live life to the full\n\nThese days if reader numbers are down all you need do is write an article which uses a photo of Wilhelm Furtwängler with Hitler. Stereotyping and prejudices satisfied, readership up, more work from the BBC; job done. But there is a different perspective which looks beyond cheap click bait. In my archive material seen above there is a 1964 BBC Third Programme listing. In that year Christopher Nupen compiled and introduced a tribute on the tenth anniversary of Furtwängler's death. This included recordings made during his performances and contributions from Vladimir Ashkenazy, Daniel Barenboim, Szymon Goldberg, Leon Goosens, Eugen Jochum, Paul Kletzki, Rafael Kubelik, Walter Legge, Frida Leider, Yehudi Menuhin, Gareth Morris, Gregor Piatigorsky, Elizabeth Schwarzkopf, and Friedlind Wagner. In those glorious pre-click bait days the listing explains how \"Both in music and politics Furtwängler was the subject of controversy and the programme will attempt to tell more about him a\n\nWe had to destroy it to save it\n\nThat photo was taken by me a few days ago in Morocco's High Atlas Mountains . My soundtrack for time spent at altitude was the reissue Music of Morocco recorded by Paul Bowles as archived in the Library of Congress. As my photo shows Morocco still has a unique ambience in the mountainous areas. But overall Morocco was a very different country when Bowles made his recordings in 1959. As the Italian writer and traveller Tiziano Terzani explains in A Fortune Teller Told Me : A country at the crossroads between modernization cum destruction and an isolation that would preserve its identity has no real choice: others have chosen on its behalf. Businessmen, bankers, experts from international organizations, officers of the UN and half the world's governments and passionate prophets of 'development' at all costs. They believe unanimously in a kind of mission not far removed from that of the American General in Vietnam who, after razing a Vietcong-occupied village t\n\nWhatever happened to the long tail of composers?\n\nReader Antoine Leboyer writes to point out that the New York Philharmonic has made its programme archive available online and that the archive shows how past programmes were far more varied than those played today. Here are just some of the composers that Antoine highlights from past concerts by the orchestra: Siniaglia, Busoni, Bosi, Chadwick, Stanford, Loeffler, McDowell, Hadley, Goldmark, Pfitzner, Enesco, Vieuxtemps and Grétry. Antoine also remarks on how Webern's music has virtually disappeared from New York concerts in recent years. One of the many confidence tricks of the digital era is how a long tail of cultural riches was promised , but a short head immaculately coiffed by audience whoring celebrities was actually delivered. I suggest that one of the key search criteria for the New York Philharmonic's new music director should be a passion for giving audiences permission to like unfamiliar music . Graphic is grabbed from the New York Philarmonic archive lan\n\nBecoming a great conductor is the ultimate trap\n\nAttention focused by the #MeToo movement on high profile conductors including Daniele Gatti and Charles Dutoit has once again raised the question of whether alleged activities away from the podium should negate the value of what a musician achieves on the podium. This is certainly not a new question; but in the past it was ideology rather than intimacy that blighted musical legacies ; with Wilhelm Furtwängler, Herbert von Karajan, Hans Knappertsbusch, Karl Böhm and Clemens Krauss among those whose reputation suffered due to ill-advised political dalliances . Classical music is a transcendent art, so it is no surprise it shares with spiritual teachers a history of debunked leaders. Among the many spiritual leaders who have been found to have toes, if not feet, of clay are Cardinal Donald Wuerl , Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh , Chögyam Trungpa and Shimano Roshi . But in a memoir touching on the life of the controversial mystic and Sufi teacher Reshad Feild , author Bruce Miller makes th\n\nWhy CDs make sound sense for classical music post-COVID\n\nLife under COVID is a bitch for classical musicians and for everyone else. But, as the Buddha told us, life's a bitch then you reincarnate. He also told us that your reincarnation depends on past deeds - karma. This period of enforced inactivity offers a valuable opportunity for the classical industry to reflect on its post-COVID reincarnation; but that opportunity is being spectacularly missed. Even allowing for the artform's passionate love affair with self-promotion, classical music's lockdown obsession with Zoom selfies coupled with a total lack of introspection is puzzling and disappointing. So this post is an attempt to in some small way to redress that imbalance. When Benjamin Britten accepted the first Aspen Award in 1964 he set out his vision of the holy triangle of composer, performer and listener. The 1960s through to the advent of the digital age was the age of dominant musicians such as Karajan, Klemperer, Rostropovich, Menuhin, and Britten himself. Britte\n\nGood enough for the Berlin Philharmonic but not for the BBC\n\nThat evocative photo above shows Rudolph Dunbar in the US war correspondent battledress he wore in 1945 when he became the first black conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic. The photo* appears in an article on the website of San Francisco classical station KDFC . This article is linked to my 2007 post which first drew attention to the remarkable story of Rudolph Dunbar who was born in British Guiana, now Guyana, in South America. Subsequent posts by me highlighted the disturbing allegations that Dunbar's career was derailed by a a 'producer/director' of music at the BBC . KDFC picks up this theme and concludes by saying 'To this day, there is still mystery surrounding Dunbar’s blacklisting from concert appearances. Although for Dunbar, it wasn’t mystery, it was racism'. But now the fate of Rudolph Dunbar is no longer a mystery. Because while preparing this new post I discovered research from the BBC archives that details how the Guyanese conductor's caree"
