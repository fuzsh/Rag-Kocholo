        "text": "Andante from the Pathetic Symphony\n\nPrice: £29.99 (inc VAT)\n\nQuantity:\n\nAbout This Work\n\nThe celebrated Russian composer Peter Illych Tchaikovsky's sixth and last Symphony was written in 1893 - the year of his death. The title ‘Pathetic' was given to it by the composer after the first performance because he felt that the meaning of the work was not fully understood.\n\nThis excerpt, the beautiful ‘Andante' from the 1st Movement is heard after a rather gloomy and restless opening and seems to breathe a message of consolation. This is one of Tchaikovsky's greatest melodies and one that has been much loved my concert goers throughout the ages. Simply scored by Geoff Kingston this offers a reflective moment in any concert performance.\n\nFeaturedNew ComposerPeter Ilyich Tchaikovsky ArrangerGeoff Kingston CategoryConcert Work DurationCirca 4 mins 30 secs DifficultyThis piece has difficulty rating of 3 on a scale one through 6, with 6 being the hardest.
