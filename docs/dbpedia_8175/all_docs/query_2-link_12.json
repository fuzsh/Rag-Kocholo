        "text": "These works are adaptations of the first and second parts of the third movement of the Symphony: Estrangeiro, Feito de Ferro, Revestido de Nobreza (Foreigner, Made of Iron, Coated with Nobility). The Symphony was inspired by the life and death of my father, Ademir da Silva. He was a pedagogue and teacher, a handsome, old-fashioned good man who came from extreme poverty and against absolutely all odds managed to overcome it. He was born in 1947 and passed away in 2016.\n\nIt was a sad time, but it was an inspiring one. I had to learn about compassion to make worth of all my efforts and my ancestors’. My parents were real heroes in a very socially and racially unequal Brazil. Their lives deserve a book. Indeed, I have just written it, to be published soon.\n\nDespite the fact his father abandoned him and his family, he did not follow that cruel example. He was a wonderful dad. His death forced me to ponder the meaning of my life. I took two and a half sabbatical years from my job as a diplomat and started writing the symphony in his honour.\n\nIt was a rewarding and rather challenging experience. The only thing I knew was that the second line in G clef represented a G, and the fourth one in a F clef stood for an F. I also knew the relation between the duration of notes, chords, keys and time signatures; nevertheless, only the basics. I did not know the nature, role, and range of Classical Instruments. In fact, I had to learn how to write from the beginning. I only had inspiration, tons of melodies in my heart, and a little help from my friends.\n\nAs I was previously familiar with letter notation, I created a system mixing it to modern staff writing. Only after studying by myself and with private teachers, I managed to write music in programs such as Encore and Finale. Melodies and arrangements were ready.\n\nLike my father, I had to come from nothing and rise to a comfortable level. I keep studying music and I am about to finalize the reviewing of the entire symphony. Meanwhile, I present this short adaptation for string quartet.\n\nSonho (Dream)\n\nIt is how I imagined my dad as a Maharaja in a previous lifetime in India.\n\nMOR\n\nIt is about the moment when family and friends were at my dad’s funeral. On the way to the burial site, I sang this lullaby. It just says how much I love him and how he always protected all of us. By the way, in Portuguese, “MOR” is the first letters of the word morte — meaning death — and the last letters of the word amor, which means love.\n\n— Amintas A. C. S. Silva\n\nPiano Etude No. 2, a study of the tritone, comes from a book of etudes called Maladies. Composed in 2005, this piece is part of a set of 18 piano etudes that are to be performed in sets of three: Maladies, Philosophies, and Histories. While I was composing the first set, many of my friends were beset with medical issues, so I named each work after their medical condition. This work is dedicated to my adopted father, Anthony J. Carollo, who was considered legally blind up to his death in 2001.\n\nSightless is a work of pure tritones. Knowing that the diminished fifth has had a stirring effect on audiences and has been seen as a dark interval used for chilling effect, I wanted to create, nonetheless, a work of beauty where every harmonic interval from beginning to end was a tritone. Back in the Middle Ages, the tritone was considered unpleasing, and perhaps the work of the devil. And according to some sources, leading church authorities banned its use in ecclesiastical music. The historically sinister case surrounding the use of the tritone was put to rest, and I found the end results to be most pleasing to the ear.\n\n— John A. Carollo"
