        "text": "British poet\n\nEdmund John (27 November 1883 â€“ 28 February 1917) was a British poet of the Uranian poetry school. His verses were modeled on the Symbolist poetry of Algernon Charles Swinburne and other earlier poets. Much of his work was condemned by critics for being overly decadent and unfashionable. He fought in the First World War but was invalided out in 1916. He died a year later in Taormina, Sicily.[1]\n\nBibliography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Flute of Sardonyx: Poems (1913)\n\nThe Wind in the Temple: Poems (1915)\n\nSymphonie Symbolique (1919)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
