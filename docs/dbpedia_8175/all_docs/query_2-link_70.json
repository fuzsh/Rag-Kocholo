        "text": "Have you ever listened to—or, better yet, read—the lyrics of “It Came Upon the Midnight Clear”?\n\nAs holiday tunes tend to go, it has become a typical Christmas bauble, the stuff of coruscating soft-jazz renditions or tidal choral arrangements. Norah Jones cut a gorgeous version of it in 2012, her soprano curling with a sly country cool, while Frank Sinatra interrupted a fireside chat with Bing Crosby on Sinatra’s own television show to deliver a definitive take in 1957. The song sounds comforting, its seasonal calm the musical equivalent of a warm blanket and a dram of strong eggnog.\n\nBut “It Came Upon the Midnight Clear” is a devastating tune. Written in 1849, as the United States recovered from a war and teetered at the brink of another, one that would split the country in two, “Midnight” presents the apocalypse as the only peaceful solution left. The end is the redemption, wrote Massachusetts minister Edmund Sears, offering relief from “life’s crushing load,” “the woes of sin and strife,” and “man, at war with man.” This isn’t a Christmas trifle; it’s a Christian’s prayer for a merciful exit, or at least a restart.\n\nThe guitarist John Fahey got this correct in 1968 on The New Possibility—his landmark first Christmas album, or the Fahey record people tend to know if they don’t know much Fahey. Released during one of the most productive portions of his career, just as his cult and commercial appeal began to converge, The New Possibility collects 14 diverse holiday tunes, from his tinny and pensive strum through “Auld Lang Syne” to a frenetic introductory take on “Joy to the World.” There’s a discursive ten-minute original called “Christ’s Saints of God Fantasy,” every bit as imaginative as Fahey’s most heralded work, and a brilliantly moaning blues slide through the antediluvian slave spiritual “Go, I Will Send Thee.”\n\nIt’s his 90-second “Midnight,” though, that is the record’s real stunning bit of emotional sophistication—and, by extension, a proclamation that we should all expect more from Christmas music. Fahey plays the hymn with painstaking slowness, peeling apart the chords until you can make out each halting note and even the shifts of his hands between them. He bends some of the notes until they’re hollow and flat, while he plucks others until they shine like stars. Fahey’s thoughtful technique subtly, wordlessly expresses the tension of Sears’ original hymn—a vision of despair, cut by a hope for redemption. The playing is not technically perfect, the production not at all polished. It is, instead, an honest admission of a complex admixture of joy and depression, rendered for a season that often demands we just smile and listen to Sinatra sing again about Santa Claus.\n\nIn the 40 years since Fahey reimagined the depths Christmas music could reach, the holiday oeuvre has remained largely static—dominated by late crooners, ostentatious symphonies, and glittering megastars. Sure, there’s been the occasional 8-bit curiosity, an impressionistic seasonal genre-bender, the requisite ’90s alternative nation compilation, and even a new-wave oddities assortment. At least one band, Low, has traced the craters and peaks of holiday moods with a surprising Christmas masterpiece of its own.\n\nMostly, though, independent and especially experimental musicians have ceded an entire season that overflows with immense sadness, delight, intimacy, alienation, gluttony, and charity—not to mention a wealth of shared vernacular music—to singers who either flatten those feelings or make melodrama of them. For decades, Fahey has inspired flocks of younger musicians, who have either aped his sense of melody and meter altogether or drawn deep influence from his substance and style. But they’ve mostly ignored and sometimes even scoffed at what may be the most consistent and broadly appealing element of his career—Christmas music. Maybe it’s time to fix that.\n\nCritics often represent Fahey as a monolithic genius, a savant of syncopated six-string brood and little else. But his career was a sidewinding rollercoaster, prone to shuttle him anywhere a mix of narcotics and nostalgia, alcohol and obsessions dictated. He did Dixieland jazz and hardline blues, mimetic pop and immersive ragas, psychedelic rock and aloof drone.\n\nOne of the few true threads through his career was religious music. From centuries-old hymns he learned as a kid in the Episcopal church to the spirituals he rediscovered while hunting for rare records in the South’s deepest hollers, Fahey vacillated between faithful renditions and irreverent adaptations, the songs bent into chimeras of his idiosyncratic will. Church, after all, had been his musical incubator, nurturing his skills outside of a home so difficult he later mythologized it. As Steve Lowenthal’s excellent Fahey biography, Dance of Death, suggests, religious songs were a vital connection to the childhood Fahey spent his life trying to reconcile and recapture. Christmas songs epitomized this tenuous tie.\n\nIn all, Fahey made five Christmas albums, releasing at least one during every full decade of his career. By the time he died in 2001, he’d infamously dismissed his early, influential acoustic work as saccharine claptrap. But he kept with Christmas music even after he’d come to that conclusion, playing annual holiday concerts and releasing a (very uneven) seasonal finale in the early ’90s. He recorded so much holiday music, in fact, that he would frequently revisit songs he’d previously recorded. The differences between the versions are telling about how far afield the same material can move and, more broadly, by how much can be expressed with a small clutch of standards.\n\nBy the time Fahey recut the bulk of The New Possibility for 1982’s Christmas Guitar, Vol. 1, the doubt and worry he expressed in his first “Joy to the World,” where he seemed anxiously emphatic, resolved into graceful acceptance. On his rendition of “White Christmas,” from his 1975 seasonal sequel, Fahey constantly stunts the melody and slides it just so, letting the song’s structure implode until he picks up a piece at random; the narrator, it seems, is too drunk on regret and whiskey to finish writing those Christmas cards. Two decades later, on an album of duets with Portland guitarist Terry Robb, Fahey buffed those feelings clean as he looked back on the past like an aging sentimentalist smiling at the good times. Likewise, his 1975 version of “O’ Holy Night” is confident and guileless, with Fahey pulling hard against the strings as if he were himself responsible for Jesus’ birth announcement. He knew better by the early ’90s, when he delivered the song with a quiet awe, as though trying to avoid waking the same baby. For Fahey, holiday music allowed for a sort of evolving emotional inventory and a dependable corrective for heavy feelings. It, like him, could change.\n\nAfter all, Christmas can be as woeful as it is wonderful. There’s family drama and heartbreaking nostalgia. There are few harder times to miss a lost friend or lover, and, if you happen to not ride the yuletide for religious reasons, there is no holiday that’s more culturally isolating. There’s even the long-standing myth that suicide increases during the holidays.\n\nThe modern Christmas canon already bears this out. “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” which Fahey could never get quite right, is a monumentally sad transmission from an abyss of loneliness. Darlene Love’s “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” and Charles Brown’s “Please Come Home for Christmas,” now both classics, scan crowds of happy revelers and realize they can’t share that elation. Santa Claus is neither always coming to town, nor are the angels always giving glory to the newborn king.\n\nSo why have so many musicians who aren’t pop or country stars turned their backs on that body of work, refusing to acknowledge the way it dominates our shared space for two months and challenge how it sounds? Maybe it’s too mawkish or too cynically commercial, a cold way to cash out in perpetuity.\n\nThat’s too bad, because blockbuster Christmas music isn’t going anywhere. It sells too well, providing a prospective sales boon for sometimes-faltering companies for decades to come. Bing Crosby’s take on “White Christmas” has sold 50 million copies , making it the best-selling record ever, while Elvis’ first Christmas record long ago waltzed beyond Diamond status. A Very She & Him Christmas has sold more than any of the pair’s other albums. Christmas maximalist Sufjan Stevens charted on the Billboard 200 both times he released five-disc box sets of Christmas music, featuring both excellent traditional takes and original songs. Fahey wasn’t immune to the Christmas bump, either: After The New Possibility stunned everyone with six-figure sales and helped fund his work for decades, he participated in a dozen reissues and re-recordings (and even a guitar tablature guide), trying to tap back into that financial magic. Fahey played the game and at least suggested its rules could be rewritten.\n\nThey still can. The experimental possibilities for holiday tunes are endless and, sometimes, admittedly ridiculous. The recursive structure of “Twelve Days of Christmas,” for instance, is a standing invitation to a modern composer’s reappraisal, like a Sarah Kirkland Snider song cycle or a pointillist symphony that echoes the ideas of Steve Reich. The stately stillness of “Silent Night” and a dozen other Christmas hymns begs for an ambient interpretation, perhaps with Daniel Lanois’ steel guitar tracing the melodies through a snowy haze, as he did long ago for Brian Eno. If “My Favorite Things” is off limits for improvisers since John Coltrane redefined it, no one told the likes of Tony Bennett or Rod Stewart, who continue to cut it for redundant Christmas records. Let’s hear the aggressive saxophone quartet Battle Trance give it a go.\n\nIn the world of solo guitar, Fahey is nothing short of a godhead. Still, very few of his descendents have tried to best Fahey’s own seasonal accomplishments. Imagine guitarist Steve Gunn and drummer John Truscinski digging into the emotional folds of “It Came Upon the Midnight Clear,” or Marisa Anderson wrestling her own truth from “Go, I Will Send Thee.” And imagine the Fahey faithful who could provide outré interpretations of new Christmas classics, like Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You” or Kelly Clarkson’s “Underneath the Tree.” Promising pop-punk bands and sharp country singers have had fun remaking such songs in their own images, but experimental musicians remain painfully hesitant to make this music reflect their experiences. That seems like an opportunity that the mischievous Fahey, who made his career recontextualizing the accessible alongside the esoteric, might have relished.\n\n“When people hear his music, they’re let into a world that is still connected to theirs but has gone farther, taken more chances, had more highs and lows than they will ever have,” Jim O’Rourke said of Fahey. “It’s the expression of a human being who has gone through extremes in his life, but when he expressed these feelings, it comes direct from the heart.”\n\nThat’s the perfect encapsulation of John Fahey’s Christmas music and its surprising depth. He made standard, familiar songs resonate anew, because he filtered them through a life of difficulty and delight. Is there any other reason to make music, in this or any other season?"
