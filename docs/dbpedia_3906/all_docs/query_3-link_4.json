        "text": "May 7, 2019\n\nThis novel centres on Bili Morguhn and the events just after those related in \"The savage mountains\" the earthquake has hit and everyone was running for their lives.\n\nBili is now dying and is journeying in his mind to over 70 years back to that time and how after he and his band joined Prince Byruhn and his crew of half man, half giants. Aid is given in the aftermath of the quake but is it free or does Byruhn want something off Bili in return...?\n\nOctober 29, 2010\n\nBili the Axe again. Can't get enough.\n\nApril 5, 2019\n\nThis novel centres on Bili Morguhn and the events just after those related in \"The savage mountains\" the earthquake has hit and everyone was running for their lives...\n\nBili is now at the end of his days and is journeying back in his mind to over 70 years before to the time of that quake and how afterwards he and his band joined Prince Byruhn and his crew of half man, half giant.\n\nAid is given in the aftermath of the quake but is it freely given or does Byruhn want something off Bili in return...?\n\nAugust 1, 2013\n\n(There are 18 books, and I read until Book 10, Bili the Axe)\n\nI read a bunch of these books, and eventually I got bored of it, but man, what a ride. The story is set in a post-apocalypse world. Everything has gone wrong, from nuclear warfare to plagues, so nothing remains from our time. This new world is run by barbarians and swords. In the new world, there are a few changes. Some clans have the ability to mindspeak to a few select animals, such as big cats (which are more like panthers), and a select few have the power of immortality. Such as our main character, the Undying High Lord Milo!\n\nMilo starts up as a small clan leader, and eventually his clan starts growing bigger as the novels progress.\n\nThe series is a manly fantasy story with none of the silly dancing elves stuff. Every few pages, someone gets either killed or raped, and the good guys usually are responsible for both. There isn’t a really strong plot or characters to speak off, but if you have to want to pretend you are a man and raping some villagers and chopping off heads, then it can be fun.\n\nJune 16, 2011\n\nI'd like to give this 3.5 stars. The original parts are very good but too much is cut and paste from earlier books. This may not have been as much of a problem when you had a couple years between book releases and were reading them as they came out, but it's really irritating when you read them back to back going through the series.\n\nNovember 17, 2014\n\nI think this was the one that dealt with the death of Bili The Axe, but I'm going from memory of a series read decades ago. They are all more of a fantasy work than anything else. The stories fall into the ripping tales sort of genre, but I really enjoyed them at the time.\n\nJanuary 22, 2016\n\nThe Horseclans series is probably the best blend of fantasy and SiFi I have ever read. Pretty much something for everyone in these books. Great characters, epic storyline, fantastic writings. My highest recommendation\n\nAugust 18, 2020\n\nGood but not the best\n\nThis book is good but not the best in series. Needed more polishing and focus. Too many diversions just ads things are getting interesting story shifts to another point\n\nJuly 26, 2010\n\nMy second favorite Horseclans book, although very very close to Bili the Axe. I loved it. This one kind of made me tear up a bit.\n\nFebruary 3, 2024\n\na lot of re-telling and a lot of info-dump..."
