        "text": "This documentary film by Bill Mason is about wolves and the negative myths surrounding the animal.\n\nReleased in 1971, Death of a Legend exhibits exceptional footage portraying the wolfâ€™s life cycle and the social organization of the wolf pack. It was also the ever documentary to feature wolves being born in the wild and their first year of life. This classic nature documentary takes us into the forest where we also see some amazing footage of caribou, moose, deer, and buffalo.\n\nMason later made a feature documentary on wolves (Cry of the Wild, 1973) that played theatrically throughout North America and grossed over $5 million at the box office."
