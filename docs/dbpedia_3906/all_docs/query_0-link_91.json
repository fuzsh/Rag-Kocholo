        "text": "Mason Locke Weems (born Oct. 11, 1759, Anne Arundel county, Md. [U.S.]—died May 23, 1825, Beaufort, S.C.) was an American clergyman, itinerant book agent, and fabricator of the story of George Washington’s chopping down the cherry tree. This fiction was inserted into the fifth edition (1806) of Weems’s book The Life and Memorable Actions of George Washington (1800).\n\nWeems was ordained in the Anglican church in 1784 and served as a pastor in Maryland until 1792. From 1794 he hawked books throughout the country as an agent for the publisher Mathew Carey. Weems also wrote a biography (1809) of General Francis Marion that, like that of Washington, was more noted for its apocryphal anecdotes and readability than its accuracy."
