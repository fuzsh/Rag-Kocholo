It is possible that the score was not included on the list because of a few songs included in the movie, which has been a common reason some of the best score of recent years weren't included, while others (BABEL, anyone???!) won despite the fact that the original score was only the tiny part of music included in the movie.\n\n2011: December 19: Marco Beltrami wins!!\n\nCongratulations to Marco Beltrami, who won Satellite Award last night for his score for SOUL SURFER. You can watch nice montage of behind the scenes photos from Soul Surfer sessions below. The video also features alternate version of Hald Pint Boards starting at 2:00.\n\n2011: December 15: New project announced WORLD WAR Z\n\nMarco Beltrami has recently signed to score upcoming Marc Foster's WORLD WAR Z.

The story revolves around United Nations employee Gerry Lane (Pitt), who traverses the world in a race against time to stop the Zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments and threatening to decimate humanity itself.

Paramount Pictures will be releasing the movie on December 21, 2012.\n\n2011: December 15: THE SURROGATE completed\n\nMarco Beltrami recently recorded his score for upcoming Ben Lewin movie THE SURROGATE, which tells the story of Mark O'Brien, a 36-year-old poet and journalist with an iron lung, decides he no longer wishes to be a virgin. With the help of his therapist and the guidance of his priest, he contacts a professional sex surrogate to take him on a journey to manhood. The film, starring Helen Hunt, William H. Macy and John Hawkes in the leading role, will be released at Sundance Festival. Marco Beltrami's score incorporates group of 8 instruments including string quartet, guitar, flute, oboe and piano backed by electronics.\n\n2011: December 02: First SOUL SURFER nomination\n\nMarco Beltrami has been nominated on Satellite Award in Best Original Score category.

Congratulations to all nominees and good luck to Marco at the ceremony on December 18th.\n\n2011: November 27: DIE HARD 5 confirmed\n\nAccording to multiple sources Marco Beltrami has signed to score upcoming A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD, fifth movie in Die Hard franchise directed by John Moore. The plot of new movie is set in Russia and begins with John McClane heading to Moscow to sweet talk some cops into letting his apparently-wayward son out of jail for something he did, but when he gets there, things surrounding his son's arrest are not as they appear and world-threatening terrorist hijinks ensue. The shooting starts in January 2012 and the movie will be released on February 14th, 2013. Marco Beltrami will be working on the score in the second half of 2012 and the movie will mark his fourth collaboration with director John Moore following such iconic scores as FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX, THE OMEN and MAX PAYNE.\n\nOn the other hand, Marco Beltrami won't be scoring upcoming TOTAL RECALL remake directed by Len Wiseman, which is currently listed as one of upcoming projects of Harry Gregson-Williams.\n\n2011: October 28: DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK CD cancelled, THE THING complete score bootleg\n\nNumerous sources suggest that planned CD release of DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK is now cancelled. No statement was published by Lakeshore Records. There is still slight chance the score will get released eventually at the time of Blu-Ray / DVD release of the movie later this year, but at this moment, it's just wishful thinking.\n\nOn the more positive note, THE THING complete score recently leaked and it will be probably available all over the internet within the next few weeks.

There's definitely a reference to the Morricone [score]. One of the things I'm really having fun with is using the orchestra as a complete organism to itself. It almost expands and contracts like breathing...like going from a single note expanding out to the full range of the orchestra then going back down. That's the motif for the thing. It's a very tough thing to mock up and show how it's going to be. It's sort of an experiment. Hopefully the filmmakers aren't too nervous. It should be a lot of fun.\"\n\n2011: April 16: Marco Beltrami & Wes Craven will participate in ASCAP panel\n\nMarco Beltrami and Wes Craven will be interviewed by Variety's Stephen Gaydos in \"The Scream Team: A Discussion with Scream 4 composer Marco Beltrami and Director Wes Craven\", which will take place on April 29 at 2:30PM PST at Hollywood Ballroom 1 (2nd Mezzanine).
