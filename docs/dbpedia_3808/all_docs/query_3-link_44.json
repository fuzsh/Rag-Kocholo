        "text": "The topic of people working for cheap rates ruining the industry applies all over, not just in music, and there isn't a good answer to it.\n\nMy day job is website design, another very overcrowded profession, and I work in a small design agency. We charge £90/hr for website design and build work. We are losing more and more work to people working from their bedrooms and happy to charge £10/hr because they have no overheads and still live at home.\n\nObviously clients get what they pay for, and many who have gone the cheap route eventually come back when they realise why we charge what we do, but it's tough competing against people happy to work for very low rates. Can only see this getting worse.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFkHbDd3qMs\n\nThe Deus EX: HR soundtrack by Michael McCann is hands down my favorite game soundtrack. It easily blows many movie scores out of the water. Especially how perfectly the music jives with the environment, sound effects, and most importantly the emotions of the game.\n\nI cannot wait to hear his next game score!!\n\nI only listened to the main title. Based on only that while it may be, and probably is judging from the screenshot, absolutely perfect for the game, as music it is just like a thousand other things out there, very cliche. Certainly nothing I would choose to listen to away from the game.\n\nOnce again, however, it may be perfect for what it is intended and I did only listen to the main title.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFkHbDd3qMs\n\nThe Deus EX: HR soundtrack by Michael McCann is hands down my favorite game soundtrack.

Certainly nothing I would choose to listen to away from the game.\n\nOnce again, however, it may be perfect for what it is intended and I did only listen to the main title.\n\nDeus Ex is by far my favourite game! The original which was out in 99/00 blew me away when I played it! And Human Revolution was just as good.\n\nJay; the music by Michael McCann fits the Cyber Punk universe that Deus Ex is set in perfectly. If you ever have time (not sure if you're a gamer or not?) play a demo of it. It's very good. He also did Splinter Cell; Double Agent. Another great score in my eyes. But I'm a sucker for the dark, mysterious style scores like Michael McCann, Joel Richard and Michael Suby.\n\nIm sorry but... anyone who think 200$ a min is big league stuff needs to get a family and try to get that to work financially.\n\nIm pretty sure sweden is not the only ones who have taxes?\n\nIm inhouse composer nowadays though but I would have never take on a job when i was freelance with that budget, unless i really saw something special with the project... and if I could afford it.\n\nIm in no way the big league of game composers.\n\nIve done movies as well and I find them apples and oranges, I cant say the other one is harder or easier.\n\nNot to bring this too far off topic, but I just thought of something quite entertaining... imagine if someone such as Richard Wagner were alive today... would you think he'd be scoring games/films? I'd certainly think so. I wonder why they use Wagnerian Tubas and Contrabass Trombones in many scores. :D\n\nPerhaps it would be interesting to discuss the factors why the various industries related to composition are becoming crowded since it is obviously and undoubtedly clear that they are crowded from all that has been said... at least then there is something to talk about relevant to the OP's topic.\n\nIs it that for a few hundred bucks anyone can get an decent virtual orchestra? Is the interconnected nature of our global world? The wonders of not having to use an \"analog notation program\" (notation paper and a piano) to write music? One thing's for sure- live orchestras and musicians are not any cheaper, even if the parent's basement composer is.\n\nAre there any benefits to a more filled industry? Perhaps the spread of knowledge (more people understanding, for example, the range of a clarinet, or the transposition of a Bb Trumpet), or a heightened focus in Romantic-era notions such as programmatic music or using symbolic motifs in music? Revival of interest in medieval instruments (how many medieval games now incorporate the sounds of medieval instruments?)? Open careers in music education?"
