        "text": "In this portfolio of compositions, I have explored the concept of musical ambiguity. I perceive this kind of ambiguity as an interesting and purposeful instability, created by employing a variety of techniques to arrange and manipulate complex compositional materials. Interrupting the narrative flow with unexpected, disturbing fragments should increase the expressive tension of the musical structure and narrative, thereby obliterating ‘habitual’ hierarchies of perception and eradicating a false sense of stability in the listener. My techniques include the simultaneous juxtaposition of several aural ‘viewpoints’, such as dense versus lucid textures, as well as the fragmentation and repositioning of chosen elements. In the analyses of my compositions I have made use of some ideas and terms from the visual arts, architecture and philosophy to clarify my arguments. Every musical element from tonality, texture and rhythm to structure and narrative is questioned and reinterpreted by means of fragmentation and juxtaposition with the aim of creating layers of textures and timbres. Prior to this treatment, a composition is generally begun with a musical idea, derived from my mental ‘sound library’, which already alludes to timbre, instrumentation, atmosphere, modality and provides motivic impetus. Furthermore, a lively collaboration with musicians plays an important role during the compositional process and has enabled me to find my own voice through the shaping of the experimental materials into the two orchestral works, a few ensemble pieces and solo works.\n\nJohn Williams is perhaps best known for his film music themes, most of which are based on eight-bar models that divide into discernible halves of 4+4 bars, each half usually containing two short ideas of two bars each. Though this type of thematic structuring has been the norm for the majority of Hollywood film history, Williams’s themes include variation more frequently than is typical for Hollywood films. After dividing Williams' film scores into four style periods, this chapter demonstrates that these variation-based themes occur mainly in his second period (the mid 1970s through the early 1990s) when the association includes an element of fantasy. It is argued that this thematic structure, in which the initial idea is not merely repeated or contrasted with, but varied, is a musical expression of fantasy. In this way, Williams strengthens the bond between theme and association by translating a fundamental element of the association into strictly musical terms.\n\nThis essay explores some of the influences on the ultra modernist composer Ruth Crawford Seeger’s compositional process in the years between her study with Adolf Weidig of the American Conservatory (of music) in Chicago and her studies in New York after September of 1929 with Charles Seeger, and how they affected the composition of her piece Music for Small Orchestra (1926). Many of the ideas that Crawford encountered through her contacts in Chicago formed the artistic basis for the strong compositional style that distinguished her as an American innovator well before her studies in New York. Music for Small Orchestra is representative of this period prior to her immersion in the rigorous compositional aesthetics of “dissonant counterpoint” and the beginning of her long association with Charles Seeger that began in the 1930s.\n\nThis dissertation follows the history of functional ideas and their pedagogy, illuminates with many examples the implementation of my updated system of Functional Analysis, and discusses the pedagogical implications that this updated system implies. The main goal is to update a system of labeling to be as pedagogically friendly as possible, in order to assist students and teachers of harmony to more easily and enjoyably learn, teach, and engage with common-practice tonal harmonic practice. Example syllabi, assignments, classroom demonstrations, and long projects are also included, and each aspect of the labeling is carefully discussed as it is presented. By surveying the history of functional thinking in music theory, we find that desire to analyze for function is not a new idea, and has been a goal of many theorists and harmony teachers for centuries. However, the current methods for instructing in function still leave students confused or baffled, as they struggle to match functional concepts to labels that do not exemplify their analysis goals and methods that insist on starting from tiny detail instead of coming from a more complete musical perspective. The elaboration of each detail of my Functional Analysis system shows how each part of Functional Analysis has been designed to help make harmonic analysis quicker, easier, more intuitive, and more personalized. The greater pedagogical implications on a larger scale involving courses and curricula are also covered, informed by my experience both as a teacher of today’s standard system and from teaching Functional Analysis in the classroom."
