        "text": "LOS ANGELES — BMI expects to sign a deal with YouTube within the next few weeks over rights payments, BMI president and CEO Del Bryant cryptically announced Wednesday at the BMI Film and TV awards gala.\n\nBryant did not identify YouTube or its parent company Google by name, but sources confirmed YouTube was the website he was referring to when he said “popular video site.”\n\nAnnouncement of the settlement brought cheers inside the Beverly Wilshire hotel ballroom as did Bryant’s declaration that the performing rights organization would continue to pull in more than $100 million per year. After his speech and a tribute to the recently deceased composer John Berry, awards were handed out to the composers associated with high-grossing films and popular TV shows.\n\nOscar-winner Atticus Ross and Brian Tyler were among the multiple winners on hand at the gala. Harry Gregson-Williams was honored four times — for scoring “The Town,” “Unstoppable,” “Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time” and “Shrek Forever After.” Pete Townshend, Blake Neely, Steve Jablonsky, David Buckley, Daniel Licht, Keb’ Mo’, Doug Bossi, Matt Koskenmaki, Andy Kubiszewski and Michael Suby also received multiple prizes as BMI celebrated the composers of music featured in the past year’s top-grossing films, top-rated prime-time network television series and highest-ranking cable network programs.\n\nDoreen Ringer Ross, vice president, Film/TV Relations, joined Bryant in handing out the trophies. The ceremony also featured the presentation of the Richard Kirk Award to David Arnold. The Richard Kirk Award is bestowed on composers who have made significant contributions to the realm of film and television music. Arnold’s films include the James Bond installments “Tomorrow Never Dies,” “The World is Not Enough,” “Die Another Day,” “Casino Royale” and “Quantum of Solace.”\n\nFILM MUSIC AWARDS\n\nTHE A-TEAM\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\nTHE ADJUSTMENT BUREAU\n\nThomas Newman\n\nBATTLE: LOS ANGELES\n\nBrian Tyler\n\nBLACK SWAN\n\nClint Mansell\n\nTHE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER\n\nDavid Arnold\n\nDIARY OF A WIMPY KID: RODRICK RULES\n\nEdward Shearmur\n\nDINNER FOR SCHMUCKS\n\nTheodore Shapiro\n\nTHE EXPENDABLES\n\nBrian Tyler\n\nFAST FIVE\n\nBrian Tyler\n\nGET HIM TO THE GREEK\n\nLyle Workman\n\nHARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS: PART 1\n\nAlexandre Desplat (SACEM)\n\nHOP\n\nChristopher Lennertz\n\nTHE KING’S SPEECH\n\nAlexandre Desplat (SACEM)\n\nLIFE AS WE KNOW IT\n\nBlake Neely\n\nTHE LINCOLN LAWYER\n\nCliff Martinez\n\nA NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET\n\nSteve Jablonsky\n\nPRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams\n\nSEX AND THE CITY 2\n\nAaron Zigman\n\nSHREK FOREVER AFTER\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams\n\nTHE SOCIAL NETWORK\n\nAtticus Ross\n\nTAKERS\n\nPaul Haslinger\n\nTANGLED\n\nAlan Menken\n\nTHE TOWN\n\nDavid Buckley (PRS)\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams\n\nTRON: LEGACY\n\nDaft Punk\n\nUNKNOWN\n\nJohn Ottman\n\nUNSTOPPABLE\n\nHarry Gregson-Williams\n\nACADEMY AWARD WINNER\n\nTHE SOCIAL NETWORK\n\nAtticus Ross\n\nTELEVISION MUSIC AWARDS\n\nAMAZING RACE\n\nChristopher Franke\n\nVaughn Johnson\n\nLee Sanders\n\nAMERICA’S GOT TALENT\n\nJos Jorgensen\n\nAndy Love\n\nTHE BACHELOR\n\nRob Cairns\n\nBLUE BLOODS\n\nMark Morgan\n\nRob Simonsen\n\nBODY OF PROOF\n\nDaniel Licht\n\nBONES\n\nScott Kirkland\n\nCRIMINAL MINDS\n\nMark Mancina\n\nCSI\n\nPete Townshend (PRS)\n\nCSI: MIAMI\n\nKevin Kiner\n\nPete Townshend (PRS)\n\nCSI: NEW YORK\n\nBill Brown\n\nPete Townshend (PRS)\n\nTHE DEFENDERS\n\nDanny Saber\n\nDESPERATE HOUSEWIVES\n\nDanny Elfman\n\nSteve Jablonsky\n\nTHE GOOD WIFE\n\nDavid Buckley (PRS)\n\nGREY’S ANATOMY\n\nCarim Clasmann (PRS)\n\nGalia Durant (PRS)\n\nHARRY’S LAW\n\nMichael Fratantuno\n\nTerence Yoshiaki\n\nHAWAII FIVE-0\n\nKeith Power (SOCAN)\n\nBrian Tyler\n\nHOUSE\n\n3D (PRS)\n\nDaddy G (PRS)\n\nMushroom (PRS)\n\nLAW & ORDER: LA\n\nMike Post\n\nTHE MENTALIST\n\nBlake Neely\n\nMIKE & MOLLY\n\nKeb’ Mo’\n\nNCIS\n\nBrian Kirk\n\nSECRET MILLIONAIRE\n\nDoug Beiden\n\nDoug Bossi\n\n$#*!
