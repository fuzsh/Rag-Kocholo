        "text": "The scars of military service for many veterans can often be felt beyond their tour of duty. The physical and psychological wounds often carry over into the transition from military to civilian life. As a result, many find it challenging to transition into civilian life and often experience difficulties paying bills.\n\nThe mission of the Purple Heart Foundation is to enhance the quality of life of Purple Heart recipients and other honorably discharged veterans and their families through:\n\nCritical Assistance Grants\n\nProviding Resources Related To TBI, PTS, Mental Health, and Suicide Prevention\n\nAcademic Scholarships\n\nService Dogs\n\nOur efforts are only as strong as the support we receive from donations, corporate sponsorships, and partnerships with veteran-owned and veteran-friendly organizations. The more support we receive, the greater the number of those in need we can help!\n\nIn addition to accepting financial donations, we have a national vehicle donation program and a clothing donation program through Go Green Drop. We also hold several fundraising events throughout the year."
