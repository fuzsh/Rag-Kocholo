Also, as these medals turn up and someone attempts to research the veteran, a search of their name will appear on our site, alerting the owner that their is a family actively looking for the medal.\n\nPlease view the list below, or, if youâ€™d like to have your lost heart appear on this list, fill out our lost heart form here.\n\nTo quickly search for a name, use Ctrl+F on Windows (or Command+F on a Mac) to search the list."
