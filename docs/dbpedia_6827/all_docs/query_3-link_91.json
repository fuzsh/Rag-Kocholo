        "text": "levi14\n\nThank you for posting your question on History Hub!\n\nThe Textual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR) has custody of several series that can be searched for possible records of interest. This includes the Records of the American Expeditionary Forces (World War I) (Record Group 120) series entryRecords of Divisions, ca. 1918 - 1942 (P 1241) and the Records of U.S. Regular Army Mobile Units (Record Group 391) series Records of the 1st Through 338th and the 559th Infantry Regiment, 1916-1921. Additionally, within the Records of the War Department General and Special Staffs, 1860 - 1952 (Record Group 165) we have a series entry Records Relating to the History of the War Department, 1918 - 1941 (NM84 310). For more information about these non-digitized records, and to request a search please contact the National Archives at College Park - Textual Reference (RR2R) via email at archives2reference@nara.gov.\n\nWe are also aware of a series within the Records of the Adjutant General's Office, 1905 - 1981 (Record Group 407) under entryCentral Files, 1926 - 1939 (PI-17 37-H). Box 1089 of this series has files for decimal number 220.5 (which according to theWar Department Decimal File System relates to awards) and holds documentation regarding the upgrade of Wound Chevrons to Purple Hearts in the early 1930’s. Please be aware that these files are nearly 300 pages in length and not name indexed or described at the document level. It is possible that a page-by-page search of these files might garner some information related to Mr. Hilgenhold’s award.\n\nWe invite you to continue the conversation with community members on History Hub, but should you have follow up questions for the staff at Archives II, please email us at archives2reference@nara.gov so that we can assist you further.\n\nWe hope this assists you with your research!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTextual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR)\n\n[RR2RR 24-25403-VVT]\n\nThank you for your response! I took a deep dive into more catalog listings and have a few record groups identified that I plan on requesting soon or have pending requests currently.\n\nThe Central Files, 1926-1939 that you mention, I couldn't find the reference to Box 1089 or any box with a 22.05 prefix, only 210. Could you point me towards that item?\n\nTo update other readers of this post. The 210 series boxes I examined from the Central Files were interesting, 210.52 Military Merit had a lot of memos pertaining to the Purple Heart, but not individual records. 210.52 Military Medals had an interesting design for the Purple Heart that was never implemented. The record groups in this series appear to primarily be focused on higher level awards, Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Stars, etc. All items that require citations. Although I did run across a compiled list of Purple Heart applications that had been mailed from a Veterans of Foreign Wars post, so it may be possible to find a few applications scattered in, I still have a lot more to search. Definitely not a comprehensive list.\n\nIn case anyone is interested in a previous search of the below record group for Purple Hearts, my great-grandfather was not listed. According to the researcher “[N]one of them held applications for Columbia Wound certificates, WWI Victory Medals, or Purple Hearts. The documents in those files appear only to pertain to requests for service badges and medals.\" However, I would still try this Record Group as to not leave a stone unturned.\n\nRecord Group 407 Entry (NM-3) 416 Records of the Adjutant General's Office. Approved and Disapproved Applications for Decorations and Awards, 1905 - 1951 https://catalog.archives.gov/id/7513370\n\nlevi14\n\nThank you for posting your question on History Hub!\n\nPlease note that the Record Group 407 seriesCentral Files, 1926 - 1939 (PI-17 37-H) is only partially available in the Catalog and it appears not all file units are presently listed either. Therefore there is no full box/file unit available for that series in the Catalog. Also, keep in mind that the Catalog can only take you so far with this type of research. In other words, archival research is labor intensive and time consuming. Searches such as this involve an iterative process, identifying decimal numbers of interest and tracking down related records. We have had similar inquiries in the past related to wound chevron upgrades and this is one place we were able to locate potential documentation. As these files have not been digitized they are only available to be consulted with in person.\n\nWe invite you to continue the conversation with community members on History Hub, but should you have follow up questions for the staff at Archives II, please email us at archives2reference@nara.gov so that we can assist you further.\n\nWe hope this assists you with your research!\n\nSincerely,\n\nTextual Reference Archives II Branch (RR2RR)\n\n[RR2RR 24-26944-VVT]"
