        "text": "Eli James Webb Jr. (Jim), age 90, passed away of complications due to Covid-19 on January 19, 2021.\n\nJim was born May 13, 1930 to Eli James Webb and Isabel Gonzalez Webb in Southton, San Antonio, TX, where he was also raised until graduating from Sidney Lanier High School. Jim went on to graduate from Del Mar College in Corpus Christi, TX, with a degree in communications, as well as Texas A&M University, where he earned his bachelor’s degree in English and History many years later.\n\nJim enlisted in the U.S. Army on October 18, 1948 and served with the 27th Infantry Division 8th Army. He went to combat in Korea and was wounded in action in Cho-Chi-Won Korea. He re-enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in October of 1950, when he served with the 5th Air Force in Korea. He served in the Vietnam War as an advisor in 1964 and went on to serve as an Air Force advisor in the Ohio Air Force National Guard for 5 years. Being in the Air Force allowed Jim to travel the world; he retired as a Technical Sgt. after 25 years of active service. During that time, Jim received the Purple Heart and numerous other decorations, ribbons, and awards. He was proud to serve our country.\n\nJim married his wife, Yolanda G. Webb, on May 22, 1976. The couple remained happily married for 45 wonderful years. Together, they enjoyed going to the Moody High School Baseball games, dancing, and traveling the world with each other during summer months. They also loved going to the casinos with their daughter Julia. He frequently said the best part of his day was having a cup of his wife’s coffee. After receiving his COVID-19 diagnosis, Jim’s only thoughts were for the well-being of his wife. “I love her more today than the day we married. If anything happens to me and I don’t make it back from the hospital, take good care of your mama for me. I love her so much.”\n\nOutside of the Air Force, Jim was one of the first welders and fabricators for Ed Friedrich, of Friedrich Air Conditioning. He also worked for Montgomery Ward as a service engineer in San Antonio, TX and in the service and maintenance department at Sears Roebuck for 15 years.\n\nUpon his retirement from Sears, he followed a life dream of completing his college degree. He went to work for CCISD as a substitute teacher at Tom Browne Middle School, teaching In School Suspension (ISS) in Corpus Christi, TX. After going back to school at Texas A & M to receive his bachelor’s degree, he continued to work for CCISD at Moody High School, teaching the children in ISS. It was a job he loved, as he could encourage his students and provide them guidance. The students loved him in return, frequently stopping to talk with him whenever they saw him. After a short retirement, he continued his strong work ethic under the employment of the U.S. Postal Service, where he enjoyed meeting many fellow service brethren and new friends.\n\nJim was a loving father, brother, husband, and son. He enjoyed hunting with his brother and friends and was active in sports as a young man. He was a Scout Master for Troop 216 in Corpus Christi, TX with the Boy Scouts of America, devoting many volunteer hours to the organization. He enjoyed 50s and 60s Classics, Classical Music, and Tejano. He could always be found outside working in the garden, feeding and watching the birds, feeding his stray cat Eli and watering the yard. He enjoyed watching Bob Ross’s “The Joys of Painting” and “M*A*S*H” on television. He also enjoyed watching the fish in his aquarium. Jim was always available for his family and friends. He often volunteered his assistance with fixing their air conditioners, refrigerators, and televisions. There wasn’t much that he didn’t know about engineering and technology. He enjoyed talking about his Military days and telling jokes. He was friendly and enjoyed making friends. He was a huge Dallas Cowboy Fan, never missing a game and watching whether they won or lost. He always volunteered in the community as a member of the Knights of Columbus and of Christ the King Church. He enjoyed scratch-off lottery tickets and had a knack for winning second chance drawings. Above all, he loved his family with all his heart.\n\nJim is preceded in death by his daughter, Terry Short; his son, Jose Anthony (Tony) Salazar; his brothers Sam G. Talamantez, Woodard “Woody” Webb; and his sisters, Peggy T. Ruiz, Evelyn Carter, and Mary Briseno. Left to cherish his memories are his wife, Yolanda Webb; sister, Emma Pearl Rodriguez of Los Angeles, CA; and children, Gary L. Webb (Ellie) of Austin, TX, Eli James Webb III (Jimmy) of Corpus Christi, TX, David Stephen Webb and Dale Scott Webb of Ohio, Tom Salazar (Joan) of Corpus Christi, TX, Norma Quarnstrom of Corpus Christi, TX, Mary Little of Friendswood, TX, Michael Salazar of Corpus Christi, TX, and Julie Young of (Darrell) of Denton,TX.\n\nA Funeral Mass will be held at Christ the King Catholic Church on February 1, 2021 at 10 a.m."
