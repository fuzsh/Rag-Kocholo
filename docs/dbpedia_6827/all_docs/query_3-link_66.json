        "text": "August 7, est. 1782\n\nPurple Heart Day is a day of observance to commemorate the creation of the Purple Heart in 1782. Do you know the history behind the Purple Heart?\n\nThe Purple Heart was first created on August 7, 1782 by General George Washington, the commander-in-chief of the Continental Army. Originally known as the Badge of Military Merit, it was awarded to three revolutionary soldiers in 1783. After the end of the American Revolution no medals were awarded until 1932 when the medal was revived on the bicentennial anniversary of George Washington’s birth. According to a paper dated February 22, 1932, the Purple Heart Medals were to be awarded to those wounded or killed while serving in the United States Armed Forces as a result of enemy action on or after April 5, 1917 as the United States officially joined World War I on April 6 of that year.\n\nThe Purple Heart is a heart shaped purple medal with a gold border. The front features a profile of George Washington while the back has the words “for military merit” inscribed on it. The medal is attached to a piece of purple silk with a silver border.\n\nCurrent estimates show at least 1.8 million Purple Heart Medals have been awarded since it was reinstated. Today, in addition to being awarded to those who fought in wars overseas, the Purple Heart is also given to military personnel who display bravery and valor while fighting certain types of domestic terrorists and as prisoners of war.\n\nThis observance is also called Purple Heart Appreciation Day, Purple Heart Recognition Day, and National Purple Heart Day. This day is an unofficial observance, meaning that businesses, government offices, schools, and other services remain open. Veterans and military organizations hold remembrance meetings for fallen heroes and special events to thank soldiers, veterans, and Purple Heart recipients on this day. Many people also choose to fly the American flag at their homes and businesses to show their solidarity with the troops."
