        "text": "CITY OF JACKSONVILLE HOSTING PURPLE HEART RECOGNITION DAY ON AUG. 7, 2024\n\nOn August 7, 2024, the City of Jacksonville’s Military Affairs and Veterans Department will honor Purple Heart recipients who were wounded or killed during their time in the U.S. Armed Forces.. The event will take place at the Jacksonville Veterans Memorial Wall (located at 1145 E. Adams Street) starting at 6:30 p.m. It’s open to the public, and those awarded the Purple Heart, and their families, are encouraged to attend and be recognized.\n\nThe program will conclude with attendees walking the Purple Heart Trail, a quarter-mile path from the Veterans Memorial Wall to the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, decorated by Navy Wives and the Daughters in Dixie. City Council members and representatives of the Military Order of the Purple Heart will then unveil the signage designating Jacksonville a Purple Heart City.\n\nf you need additional information, feel free to contact the Military Affairs and Veterans Department at (904) 255-5550.\n\nThe Purple Heart is the United States military's oldest military decoration, dating back to 1782. It is awarded to members of the armed forces of the United States who have been wounded or killed while serving in the line of duty with the U.S. military after April 5, 1917.\n\nCriteria for Purple Heart Award\n\nThe Purple Heart is awarded in the name of the President of the United States to any member of the Armed Forces of the United States who, while serving under competent authority in any capacity with one of the U.S. Armed Services after April 5, 1917, has been wounded or killed. Wounds must be the result of gunshot, fragmentation from an explosive device, or other injuries sustained while engaging enemy forces.\n\nThe Purple Heart is the only military decoration that can be awarded posthumously to next of kin of those who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action.\n\nDesign and Symbolism\n\nThe Purple Heart is a pentagon-shaped medal with a white border and a purple center. In the center of the medal is a shield with an inscription of \"For Military Merit.\" Above the shield is a figure of George Washington.\n\nThe purple color of the medal represents the blood shed by those who have been wounded in battle. The shield represents the defense of the nation, and the inscription of \"For Military Merit\" honors the service and sacrifice of those who have received the award.\n\nSignificance of the Purple Heart\n\nThe Purple Heart is a highly prestigious decoration that is awarded to those who have demonstrated courage, sacrifice, and loyalty to the nation. It is a symbol of honor and respect for those who have served their country in the armed forces.\n\nWhat communities and local government can do to honor Purple Heart recipients:\n\nCommunities and local government can honor Purple Heart recipients in a variety of ways, big and small. Here are a few ideas (The City of Atlantic Beach actions are highlighted):\n\nEstablish a Purple Heart Community designation. This designation recognizes the community's commitment to honoring and supporting Purple Heart recipients. To earn this designation, a municipality must have a living or deceased Purple Heart recipient, issue an official proclamation, and recognize National Purple Heart Day.\n\nOffer special services to Purple Heart recipients, including designated parking, free dog park membership, and utility bill discounts.\n\nEducate the community about the Purple Heart and its significance. This can be done through newsletters and online resources.\n\nName a street after a Purple Heart recipient.\n\nPartner with local veterans' organizations. The City can work with veterans' organizations to host events, provide support services, and raise awareness of the needs of Purple Heart recipients.\n\nCreate a Purple Heart Recipient Registry. This registry can help connect Purple Heart recipients with community resources and support services. The registry can also be used to identify recipients who may need assistance with things like housing, food, or transportation.\n\nEstablish a Purple Heart Memorial. This could be a statute, plaque or other memorial dedicated to Purple Heart recipients.\n\nEstablish a Purple Heart Memorial Garden. This park or garden can be a place for reflection and remembrance for veterans and their families.\n\nSimply say thank you. A simple \"thank you\" can go a long way in showing Purple Heart recipients that their service is appreciated.\n\nNo matter what approach a community takes, the most important thing is to show Purple Heart recipients that their sacrifice is valued and appreciated. By honoring these brave men and women, we can help to ensure that their legacy lives on.\n\nVetCare, City of Atlantic Beach, honor Purple Heart recipients\n\nOCTOBER 23, 2018 – Roberts Mt. Pisgah (RPM) VetCare Ministry is assisting the City of Atlantic Beach in honoring local Purple Heart recipients for their valor and patriotism.\n\nFollowing the City’s recent designation as a “Purple Heart City,” VetCare presented the City a check on Oct. 23 paying for a “Purple Heart City” street sign. The sign will be erected on Mayport Road in Atlantic Beach near Naval Station Mayport.\n\nThe City of Atlantic Beach was designated as a Purple Heart City earlier this year and adopted a proclamation, accordingly, expressing residents’ appreciation for Purple Heart recipients valor and patriotism.\n\nRMP VetCare Ministry was established to support local veterans and their families; the Purple Heart is awarded to individuals wounded in action against an enemy or as a direct result of an act of the enemy.\n\nThe Oct. 23 check presentation was made as part of the City of Atlantic Beach’s Florida City Government Week activities.\n\n“It is an honor to service those who have sacrificed so much for our nation. The little we do has the ability to change much,” said Rev. Vaseal Montgomery, director of RMP VetCare Ministry.\n\nAtlantic Beach has a large, highly decorated active-duty and veteran population, including many Purple Heart recipients. The City was designated a Purple Heart City by the Military Order of the Purple Heart, a Congressionally chartered organization that supports combat-wounded veterans and works to ensure that Americans never forget the sacrifices made by U.S. military personnel.\n\n“The City of Atlantic Beach is grateful the sacrifices of our Purple Heart recipients made for our freedoms,” said Mayor Ellen Glasser. “It’s important that we acknowledge all service members – active, former and those who have passed -- for their courage, along with never forgetting those who paid the price on our behalves.”\n\nThe Purple Heart is a medal awarded to any member of the U.S. armed forces who is either wounded or killed in combat. Ten recipients of the prestigious medal were in attendance at Monday’s City Commission meeting, along with other retired and current military personnel who were on hand to express their support to these heroes and their spouses."
