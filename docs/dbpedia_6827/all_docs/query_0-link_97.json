        "text": "Sen. Jim Webb is everywhere these days, in that kind of politician-as-celeb way that makes people ask “so what’s he running for?”\n\nOh sure, the Virginia Democrat is hawking his new book, but that begs the age-old chicken-egg question: Is he out there because he wrote a book or did he write a book to get out there because he has an agenda and that agenda includes at least making Barack Obama’s short list of vice presidential contenders?\n\nThe well-timed bio/campaign treatise – Webb’s is called “A Time to Fight” – is an essential step on the road to political advancement.\n\nAn excerpt from the book ran in last Sunday’s nationally syndicated Parade magazine, but even better, Webb’s photo was on the cover with the headline, “What It Means To Be a Leader.” (Sen. Obama eat your heart out!)\n\nHe did “Meet the Press” Sunday, giving him the opportunity to make the obligatory – if less than Shermanesque – denial that he was interested in the vice presidential nomination (“No one’s asking. No one’s talking and I’m not that interested,” he told host Tim Russert.)\n\nAnd he followed that with a Monday night spot on David Letterman.\n\nBefore his national tour began, Webb had a kind of out-of-town tryout before a Massachusetts crowd in D.C. for Niki Tsongas’ Fifth District Day last week.\n\nHe opened with tales of a 1981 visit to South Boston for the dedication of the local Vietnam vets memorial – Webb had earned the Navy Cross, a Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and two Purple Hearts as a Marine commander during the war.\n\nHis old friend, veterans advocate Tom Lyons, who was organizing the dedication, told him that just about every government official in town wanted to speak and if he chose one, well, the other two dozen would be grumpy and wouldn’t Webb please bail him out of this?\n\nWith his auburn hair and ruddy complexion Webb could easily pass for a son of Southie and confessed the visit included quite the Southie pub crawl.\n\nWebb’s election to the Senate in 2006 was part stroke of genius by Democrats who helped recruit him (reportedly that included former Clintonista and current Congressman Rahm Emanuel) and part fluke when Sen. George Allen helped defeat himself with his YouTube “macaca” moment.\n\nHe was an unlikely choice – especially as a Democratic candidate – having served as an assistant secretary of Defense under President Reagan and later as his secretary of the Navy. He has even added journalist to his impressive resume, earning an Emmy for his work for PBS on the Marines in Beirut and in 2004 went into Afghanistan as an embedded journalist with the U.S. military.\n\nAdd to his own story that of his Vietnam-born wife – who escaped on her father’s fishing boat and worked in a shrimp factory here as a teen but went on to graduate from Cornell – and a son serving in the Marines (including duty in Iraq) and you have a pretty interesting package.\n\nHe would bring to an Obama ticket military and foreign policy expertise, but with solid anti-Iraq war credentials. However, he has been in the Senate even less time than Obama himself.\n\nAnd a lot of liberal Democrats simply don’t trust him.\n\n“Isn’t he kind of crazy?” said one.\n\nWebb earned his reputation as a hothead before he was even sworn in by being testy with President Bush in a White House receiving line when Bush inquired about Webb’s son.\n\nAnd he’s a dreadful campaigner, insisted another leading Democrat. Entirely wonky on the stump – a side he showed to the Massachusetts crowd as he explained the minutiae of his new GI Bill for those who have served in the military since 9/11 – a bill he filed immediately after being sworn in, but which is only now picking up steam.\n\nBut his quirkiness, even his awkwardness on the stump were part of what independents in Virginia found so endearing – endearing enough to give him the win over Allen.\n\nIt’s said there’s not a person who has ever sat in the Senate who didn’t think he could be president. It’s likely Webb is no different. And at age 62 Webb doesn’t have a lot of time to waste."
