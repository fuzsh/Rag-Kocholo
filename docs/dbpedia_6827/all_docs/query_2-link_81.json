On 15 September 1968, the Third Platoon was advancing along a heavily wooded trail in Quang Tri Province when an explosive device was suddenly command detonated and the Marines simultaneously came under intense small arms and automatic weapons fire from an enemy ambush force, killing two Marines and wounding two others. Observing a man pinned down behind a tree with one of the wounded, Corporal Wargo completely disregarded his own safety as he fearlessly moved twenty-five meters along the fire-swept trail to reach his two comrades. Undaunted by the heavy volume of hostile fire, he was assisted in the evacuation of the injured Marine when he was critically wounded by a burst of enemy automatic weapons fire. Concerned only for the safety of his men, he ignored his painful injuries and maneuvered across the hazardous area to a covered position in order to prevent any of his men from being wounded in an attempt to render assistance. Shortly thereafter, Corporal Wargo succumbed to his injuries. His resolute determination and heroic actions inspired his fellow Marines to advance and successfully accomplish their mission. By his courage, bold initiative and unwavering devotion to duty, Corporal Wargo upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.

Webb, Jr. (0-106180), First Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Platoon Commander with Company D, First Battalion, Fifth Marines, FIRST Marine Division in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On 9 May 1969, during Operation Muskogee Meadow, a six-man reconnaissance patrol from First Lieutenant Webb's platoon was ambushed and temporarily pinned down by a large North Vietnamese Army force concealed in a tree line four hundred meters in front of Company D's night defensive position. Immediately upon learning of the dangerous situation, First Lieutenant Webb organized a reaction force and proceeded to the point of contact to aid his beleaguered Marines. When his reaction unit came under enemy automatic weapons and rocket fire as it approached the ambush site, he executed a skillful evasive maneuver, established a base of fire, and continued to advance across the fire-swept terrain to the patrol's position. Rallying and encouraging his men, he directed his base of fire forward to a more advantageous position and led his assault team one hundred and fifty meters across on an open rice paddy in a bold attempt to recover several casualties lying in an open area directly in the line of enemy fire. As his Marines delivered a heavy volume of fire at hostile positions, First Lieutenant Webb repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire as he dashed into the open and pulled the casualties, one at a time, back to friendly lines. Then, consolidating his platoon, he initiated a sudden, vigorous attack which routed the enemy soldiers from their bunkers, disorganized their fire plan, and forced them to retreat from the area. His determination and bold fighting spirit inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in saving the lives of at least two Marines and undoubtedly thwarting the enemy's plan to launch a major attack against his unit's night position. By his leadership, extraordinary courage, and unflagging devotion to duty at great personal risk, First Lieutenant Webb upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.\n\nBorn: February 9, 1946 at St. Joseph, Missouri\n\nHome Town: St. Joseph, Missouri\n\nPersonal Awards: Navy Cross (Vietnam), Silver Star (Vietnam), 2@ Bronze Stars, 2@ Purple Hearts\n\nWEGENER, JOSEPH B., II\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Joseph B.

On the morning of 10 October 1968, Lance Corporal Wegener launched as Aerial Gunner aboard a CH-46 transport helicopter assigned to insert a reconnaissance team deep in enemy controlled territory near Thuong Duc in Quang Nam Province. Arriving over the designated area, the aircraft sustained battle damage from a heavy volume of hostile fire, and when the helicopter crashed, it commenced to burn violently. Despite sustaining a painful wound, Lance Corporal Wegener resolutely commenced assisting personnel out of the wreckage, and as the intense heat of the fire caused machine gun ammunition within the aircraft to begin exploding, he steadfastly remained in the helicopter until all of the passengers had escaped. After departing the aircraft, he discovered that the other crew members were still in the helicopter and, fearlessly returning to the burning wreckage, assisted the injured pilot to a position of relative safety. Undaunted by enemy fire, he resolutely continued his determined efforts and, again returning to the aircraft, obtained first aid equipment which he utilized to treat the aircraft commander's wounds. By his courage, resolute determination and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of great personal danger, Lance Corporal Wegener was instrumental in saving the lives of several Marines and upheld the finest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.\n\nHome Town: Phoenix, Arizona\n\nWEISS, PETER WILLIAM\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Peter William Weiss (0-103881), Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps (Reserve), for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Platoon Commander with Company B, First Battalion, Twenty-Sixth Marines, THIRD Marine Division, in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 30 March 1968, Company B launched an attack on a well entrenched, numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force near the Khe Sanh Combat Base and immediately came under intense automatic weapons, mortar, and anti-tank rocket fire. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Second Lieutenant Weiss quickly deployed his men and, with complete disregard for his own safety, fearlessly led a determined assault across seventy-five meters of fireswept terrain. Exposing himself to the intense fire, he delivered a heavy volume of fire into the fortified positions, enabling his platoon to maneuver forward and forcing the North Vietnamese soldiers to flee in panic and confusion. Observing an enemy mortar position, he accurately hurled a hand grenade into the emplacement, destroying the hostile weapon. Undaunted by the enemy fire, he calmly supervised the evacuation of all casualties and personally carried several injured Marines to positions of relative safety. His resolute determination and heroic actions inspired all who served with him and were instrumental in accounting for 115 North Vietnamese soldiers confirmed killed.

Wester (0-91086), Captain, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer of Company L, Third Battalion, Third Marines, THIRD Marine Division in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the evening of 13 September 1969, while moving toward its night objective, Captain Wester's company came under heavy fire from an enemy force concealed in well-fortified bunkers. The initial burst of fire killed the company executive officer, severely wounded a platoon commander, and pinned down his platoon. Ignoring the hail of enemy fire, Captain Wester moved forward to the platoon and quickly assessed the situation. Skillfully maneuvering another platoon on line with the first, he organized and led an attack on the enemy position. Disregarding his own safety, he moved among his men shouting encouragement and directing their fire on the enemy. As a result of Captain Wester's heroic actions, his men rapidly gained fire superiority and increased momentum in the attack until they captured the objective. Immediately following this, the enemy began a steady bombardment of the objective with 82-mm. mortar rounds. Although seriously wounded, Captain Wester continued to direct the movements of his unit and to keep higher headquarters informed of the situation. Refusing medical attention, he insisted that the corpsmen go to the aid of the other men in his company and continued directing his men until the objective was consolidated and the enemy defeated.

(KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to James H. Whisenhunt (2247981), Lance Corporal, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Rocket Squad Leader with Company M, Third Battalion, Third Marines, THIRD Marine Division, in the Republic of Vietnam, on 30 April 1967. While conducting a search and destroy mission northwest of Khe Sanh, Quang Tri Province, Company M was assigned the task of securing Hill 881, a strategic terrain feature commanding the northern approaches to the Khe Sanh complex. Although previously fought battles in the area indicated that enemy strength was exceedingly high, Lance Corporal Whisenhunt was well-trained and equipped for fighting from heavily fortified emplacements. As the assault upon the hill commenced, he advanced with the lead elements. Approaching the crest of the hill, Marine units became subjected to a heavy volume of surprise enemy fire. Intense small arms, automatic weapons and mortar fire temporarily halted the advance. Movement in the fire-swept area became extremely hazardous and was undertaken at great risk. An enemy automatic weapons emplacement, situated directly on the route of advance, seriously hindered any advance by Marines. Realizing the necessity of eliminating the position, Lance Corporal Whisenhunt on his own initiative, unhesitatingly advanced into an exposed area to clear a field of fire. Dangerously exposed, he commenced to deliver accurate, effective fire toward the enemy. Scoring a direct hit, he then moved forward toward the enemy position to destroy it completely. Heedless of his own personal safety, Lance Corporal Whisenhunt advanced across an open exposed area to secure the bunker but was mortally wounded by enemy machine gun fire. By his valorous actions and selfless devotion to his fellow Marines, he significantly contributed to the success of Marine operations in the bitterly contested conflict. Lance Corporal Whisenhunt's heroic acts upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.

On 18 August 1968, during Operation MAMELUKE THRUST, Company E was conducting a reconnaissance in force in Quang Nam Province when the Marines came under intense small arms and automatic weapons fire and a hand grenade attack from a large enemy force and sustained several casualties. Reacting instantly, Corporal Wicks reorganized his men and directed the fire of his machine gun on the hostile soldiers. Although painfully wounded, he steadfastly refused medical aid and directed the corpsmen to assist the more seriously injured Marines. Realizing his weapons were becoming dangerously low of ammunition, Corporal Wicks fearlessly exposed himself to the heavy volume of enemy fire and boldly crossed one hundred meters of fire-swept terrain to obtain additional ordnance. Swiftly returning to his Marines, he distributed the vital ammunition and, shouting words of encouragement to his men, directed an increased volume of fire against the enemy positions. Alertly observing that one of his machine guns had malfunctioned, he swiftly moved to the aid of the gunner, and ignoring the hostile rounds impacting near them, he expertly cleared the stoppage and returned the weapon to action. Continuing his determined efforts, Corporal Wicks exposed himself to the enemy fire as he individually assaulted a hostile sniper position, and hurling a hand grenade into the emplacement, killed the enemy soldiers. His daring initiative and resolute determination inspired all who observed him and contributed immeasurably to the accomplishment of his unit's mission.

In the early morning hours of 8 July 1968, during Operation SCOTLAND II in Quang Tri Province, Company A was counterattacking a large North Vietnamese Army force which had penetrated the Marines' defensive perimeter on Hill 689. Informed that one platoon was pinned down by intense automatic weapons fire delivered from an enemy occupied bunker, Lance Corporal Williams and another Marine unhesitatingly volunteered to destroy the position with light antitank assault weapons. Disregarding his own personal safety, Lance Corporal Williams fearlessly commenced maneuvering across the fire- swept terrain toward the hostile emplacement when the enemy suddenly pinpointed his position and attempted to halt his attack with hand grenades and a heavy volume of automatic weapons fire. Ignoring the hostile rounds impacting near him, he resolutely continued his determined assault and, fearlessly exposing himself to the intense fire, employed his weapon with maximum effectiveness, silencing the hostile fire and killing approximately eight North Vietnamese soldiers. While attempting to withdraw from the hazardous area and rejoin his squad, Lance Corporal Williams was mortally wounded by enemy fire. His bold initiative and resolute determination inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in his company ejecting the hostile force from the Marines' perimeter. By his courage, aggressive fighting spirit and unwavering devotion to duty, Lance Corporal Williams upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.

On 15 March 1966, First Lieutenant Wilson was commanding the point of a patrol as it entered a mountain pass west of the village of Duc Bo. As the Marines were moving along a trail beside a river, they were subjected to violent concentrated automatic weapons fire and the first seven men, including First Lieutenant Wilson, were pinned down in an open area. With exceptional presence of mind in the tense situation, First Lieutenant Wilson maneuvered his men one at a time to covered positions from which they could return the hostile fire. As the last man with him attempted to reach the cover of a nearby trench, he was seriously wounded. Although the withering fire continued to pelt the area from three directions, First Lieutenant Wilson courageously ran to the stricken man and proceeded to administer medical aid. Unmindful of his personal danger, he remained in the exposed position, gallantly covering the wounded man's body with his own at times when the volume of Viet Cong fire intensified. With the help of two others, he eventually succeeded in moving the man to the trench. He continued to direct the fire of his men with extreme accuracy while artillery and air strikes were in progress and the remainder of his Company maneuvered to drive the Viet Cong from their positions. His aggressive and daring effort undoubtedly prevented extensive casualties among his men, and contributed significantly to the eventual success of the engagement. By his extraordinary concern for the welfare of his fellow man at great risk of his own life, coupled with outstanding leadership and unfaltering dedication to duty, First Lieutenant Wilson upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.\n\nHome Town: Rapid City, South Dakota\n\n*WITT, JAMES PATRICK (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to James Patrick Witt (0-106078), Second Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Platoon Commander with Company D, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 14 February 1969, during a company-sized patrol in Quang Nam Province, the point element took the command post of a North Vietnamese Army company by surprise. One enemy soldier was killed, and the others hastily retreated to the security of fortified positions under cover of protective fire from a bunker emplacement 15 meters to the Marines' front. Realizing the advantage of immediate action, Second Lieutenant Witt deployed the lead squad on line and, while initiating an aggressive assault on the enemy bunker, received multiple wounds as he moved across the fire-swept terrain to direct the fire of his men. When another Marine started to his aid, he yelled for the man to get down as a hostile hand grenade detonated nearby, injuring him again. Although painfully wounded, Second Lieutenant Witt calmly briefed the Marine and delivered explicit directions regarding the course of action to be followed by his men. Subsequently, he was medically evacuated and succumbed to his wounds. His heroic and timely actions inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in his unit's killing three hostile soldiers while overrunning the North Vietnamese Army position.

In the defense of hill complexes south of Hill 881 North, Company E was attacked by a fierce and determined enemy force, overrunning some of the Second Platoon's positions. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Lance Corporal Womble unhesitatingly rushed from his position, retrieved ammunition from the overrun positions and proceeded to redistribute badly needed machine gun and 60-mm. mortar ammunition. With complete disregard for his own safety, he continued to move through extreme automatic weapons fire until positions in critical need of ammunition were re-supplied. Then, observing several Marines pinned down in the Second Platoon Command Bunker, he opened fire with his M-14 and single-handedly engaged the enemy, drawing fire upon himself so that the Marines in the bunker could gain fire superiority. As he daringly delivered a large volume of well-aimed accurate fire into the enemy, he was mortally wounded by heavy automatic weapons fire. Lance Corporal Womble's initiative, courageous actions and loyal devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.

On 31 January when an enemy force launched an attack on the sixteen-man Bulk Fuel Detachment on Colco Island in the Song Huong River near Hue in Thua Thien Province, the constant small arms fire isolated the installation from friendly forces for two days. Despite continuous enemy sniper fire throughout this period, Sergeant Wood moved throughout the compound, supervising the construction of supplementary defensive positions while simultaneously maintaining radio contact with higher headquarters to keep them informed of the rapidly changing situation. On the night of 2 February 1968, the enemy launched a fierce attack against his position, using rockets, mortars and automatic weapons. Completely disregarding his own safety and although painfully wounded in the neck, Sergeant Wood moved throughout the compound, repositioning his men to reinforce the most severely attacked sectors of the perimeter. When the enemy penetrated the defensive perimeter, he quickly rallied his men and lead them in an aggressive counterattack which forced the enemy from the compound. Suddenly, enemy fire struck the 120,000 gallon fuel storage tank, causing it to burst into flames and forcing Sergeant Wood from his position. Braving intense enemy fire, he quickly moved to an advantageous position where he delivered accurate suppressive fire on the enemy and detonated two well-positioned Claymore Mines, killing and wounding approximately thirteen of the enemy soldiers. Subsequently, he directed the successful evacuation of his men from the blazing compound aboard two United States Navy river patrol boats.

(KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to John B. Woodall (0-93518), First Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Platoon Commander with Company K, Third Battalion, Ninth Marines, THIRD Marine Division, in the Republic of Vietnam, on 30 April 1967. As First Lieutenant Woodall led his men in an assault on Hill 881, north of Khe Sanh, the Platoon was taken under devastating fire from machine guns and automatic rifles. The initial burst of enemy fire felled the two point men who were closest to the hidden bunker. Several attempts to reach the two critically wounded Marines were thwarted by a hail of deadly fire from the enemy position. Immediate medical attention was necessary to save their lives. With a total disregard for his own safety, First Lieutenant Woodall grabbed a rifle and placed accurate fire into the bunker. He then charged the bunker and killed both of its enemy occupants. From this position he laid down covering fire enabling the two Marines to be carried to safety. As he covered their withdrawal, First Lieutenant Woodall was mortally wounded by an enemy sniper. His heroic actions and unselfish devotion to the welfare of his men were in keeping with the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life for his country.\n\nBorn: June 26, 1943 at Chicago, Illinois\n\nHome Town: Naperville, Illinois\n\nWOODHAM, TULLIS J., JR.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Tullis J. Woodham, Jr. (0-53444), Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Commanding Officer of the Third Battalion, Twenty-Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On 13 May 1968 the Third Battalion launched Operation Allen Brook against a numerically superior North Vietnamese Army force occupying well prepared defensive positions on Go Noi Island in Quang Nam Province. When the advance company became heavily engaged with the enemy on 17 May, Lieutenant Colonel Woodham unhesitatingly led the remainder of his battalion in a heliborne attack to assist the besieged unit. Undaunted by a heavy volume of automatic weapons and mortar fire, he repeatedly advanced to dangerously exposed positions as he aggressively deployed his companies and engaged the hostile force. Displaying outstanding professional knowledge and superior tactical ability, he ably planned and directed supporting arms fire and air strikes, which inflicted heavy losses on the enemy and enabled his battalion to accomplish its mission with a minimum number of friendly casualties. His bold initiative and exceptional tactical ability were instrumental in his battalion accounting for over 200 North Vietnamese soldiers confirmed killed and the seizure of a large number of weapons. By his courage, superb leadership and steadfast devotion to duty in the face of great personal danger, Lieutenant Colonel Woodham upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.\n\nHome Town: Jacksonville, Florida\n\nWRAY, ROBERT B.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Robert B. Wray (2098565), Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as Supply Sergeant of Combined Action Company 1-3, III Marine Amphibious Force in connection with combat operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 13 September 1969, a battalion of the Twenty-First North Vietnamese Army Regiment, utilizing mortars, automatic weapons, and small arms, attacked tile village of An Phong, in Quang Ngai Province, which was defended by Combined Action Platoon 1-3-9. Unhesitatingly volunteering to accompany a reaction force formed to reinforce the beleaguered unit and deliver ammunition and other vitally needed supplies, Sergeant Wray subsequently arrived in the battle area and fearlessly maneuvered from one position to another as he supervised the expeditious distribution of the ammunition. Having completed this task, he led an element of the platoon in a daring envelopment of a hostile stronghold. As the friendly unit maneuvered forward, Sergeant Wray alertly observed a squad of enemy soldiers armed with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons. Completely disregarding his own safety, he initiated an assault and single-handedly killed three of the hostile soldiers while his companions accounted for three additional enemy casualties. Locating the North Vietnamese Army units command post, he skillfully coordinated the movement of his men with that of an adjacent friendly element and directed an assault upon the position which resulted in five enemy killed and the destruction of enemy supplies before they could be removed by the retreating forces. By his courage, bold leadership and unwavering devotion to duty at great personal risk, Sergeant Wray was instrumental in his unit accounting for 116 enemy killed and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.\n\nHome Town: Winston-Salem, North Carolina\n\nWRIGHT, EDWARD F. JR.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Second Lieutenant Edward F. Wright, Jr., United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action against the enemy as a Platoon Leader assigned to Company L, Third Battalion, Third Marines, in the Republic of Vietnam. On 21 August 1967, Lieutenant Wright led a 30-man reaction force against a well-entrenched North Vietnamese force that had just ambushed an Army convoy and pinned down his company commander's relief force. Lieutenant Wright expeditiously organized his platoon and led them on a rapid two-mile combat march to the ambush site. Recognizing contact with the enemy was imminent, he tactically deployed his force into concealed positions moments before the enemy unleashed a ferocious attack with automatic weapons, rockets and grenades. Despite the onslaught, Lieutenant Wright tenaciously assaulted, clearing enemy positions as he advanced. As the battle came to close combat, he rallied his men and ordered them to fix bayonets and then continued his aggressive assault. His tactical skills and placement of fire support enabled his force to steadily advance and rescue the besieged Soldiers and Marines located at the main convoy site. Second Lieutenant Wright's bold action, unwavering courage under fire, and complete devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service and the United States Marine Corps.\n\n*WYMAN, MICHAEL JAMES (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pride in presenting the Silver Star Medal (Posthumously) to Michael James Wyman (2404772), Lance Corporal, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a machine gunner with Company D, First Battalion, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division, in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 14 February 1969, during a company-sized patrol in Quang Nam Province, the point element took the command post of a North Vietnamese Army company by surprise. One enemy soldier was killed and the others hastily retreated to the security of fortified positions under cover of protective fire from a bunker emplacement fifteen meters to the Marines' front. Wounded in the hip after he left his relatively secure rear position to maneuver to the point of heaviest combat, Lance Corporal Wyman resolutely continued to advance through the intense hostile fire to aid his fellow Marines. When he was within five meters of the enemy bunker, he received an injury to his other hip which knocked him to the ground and jarred his weapon loose from his hand. Ignoring his wounds, he attempted to reach his weapon and, unable to do so, calmly directed the accurate fire of his comrades. Subsequently, he was medically evacuated and succumbed to his wounds. His heroic and timely actions inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in his units killing 3 hostile soldiers while overrunning the North Vietnamese position. By his courage, aggressive fighting spirit, and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of grave personal duty, Lance Corporal Wyman upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.\n\nHome Town: Buckner, Illinois\n\nYATES, JOHN CHARLES (KIA)\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to John Charles Yates (0-108133), Sergeant, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Radio Operator with Company A, First Amphibian Tractor Battalion, THIRD Marine Division in connection with operations against insurgent communist (Viet Cong) forces in the Republic of Vietnam. On 14 July 1967 during Operation Hickory II, Company A was advancing toward Hill 31 in Quang Tri Province when it came under intense enemy small arms, mortar and recoilless rifle fire from enemy positions in a tree line [ed. Note: it was a ridgeline on a sand dune, not a tree line] only thirty meters to its front. Under the initial barrage of enemy fire, Sergeant Yates and the command group were forced to disembark their amphibian tractor and move to a covered position. As enemy fire increased, the company moved back leaving the command tractor in front of company lines. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, Sergeant Yates gave his radio to a companion and, braving heavy machine gun fire, ran twenty meters to the damaged command tractor. With complete disregard for his own safety, he fearlessly climbed to the top of the vehicle and manned the machine gun. Subsequently forced to abandon his position because of the intense enemy fire, Sergeant Yates threw a 60 mm mortar tube to the ground, obtained four boxes of ammunition and disembarked the beleaguered vehicle. Retrieving the mortar, he returned across the exposed area to his former position, held the weapon in his bare hands and commenced to direct accurate suppressive fire against the enemy. When the mortar became hot, he wrapped a cloth around it [ed. Note: the cloth was actually the green towel from around his neck] and continued to fire at the enemy, pinning them down until their positions were destroyed by an air strike. His daring actions in the face of extreme danger inspired all who observed him and were instrumental in saving many Marines from death or serious injury. By his courage, bold initiative and selfless devotion to duty, Sergeant Yates upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and of the United States Naval Service.\n\nHome Town: Fergus Falls, Minnesota\n\nPersonal Awards: Navy Cross (Vietnam), Silver Star (Vietnam), Purple Heart\n\nZIMMERMAN, ROBERT E.\n\nCitation:\n\nThe President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star Medal to Robert E. Zimmerman (0-95176), First Lieutenant, U.S. Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action while serving as a Platoon Commander with Company L, Third Battalion, Fifth Marines, First Marine Division in connection with operations against the enemy in the Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 22 February 1968 during Operation Hue City, First Lieutenant Zimmerman's company was assigned the mission of seizing an enemy-held village in the city. As the leading elements crossed a bridge which separated the unit from its objective, the Marines suddenly came under intense automatic weapons fire from concealed North Vietnamese Army positions. The heavy volume of enemy fire inflicted numerous casualties and pinned down the main body of the company on the opposite end of the bridge. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, First Lieutenant Zimmerman unhesitatingly left his position of relative safety with the leading elements and ran back across the fire-swept bridge to assist the beleaguered Marines. Fearlessly exposing himself to the hostile fire, he quickly reorganized the remaining two platoons and supervised the evacuation of the wounded. Then, coordinating the fire of a supporting tank with the fire of his men on the enemy emplacements, he effectively suppressed the enemy fire, enabling the Marines to continue the attack and seize their objective. By his courage, aggressive leadership and unwavering devotion to duty in the face of great personal danger, First Lieutenant Zimmerman was instrumental in the accomplishment of his unit's mission and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\n\nHome Town: New York, New York"
