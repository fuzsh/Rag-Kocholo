        "text": "\"The Hall of Honor marks the true price of freedom and democracy, the precious blood of our men and women spent defending them. We honor the heroes by reminding ourselves, and future generations, of their sacrifices and then acting worthy of them.”\n\n\"It seemed obvious to me that, as a country, we needed a place to learn about and honor the people who have sacrificed so much for us. As a member of the Genesis Group, who worked for over eleven years to establish the Hall of Honor, I am proud to be able to have a small part in ensuring the sacrifices of these brave men and women will not be forgotten.”\n\n\"All of us owe our freedom and our prosperity to the sacrifices of immigrants who gave of themselves so that we might have more. We are fortunate and we are forever indebted to those who have gone before.”\n\n\"I just couldn’t sit on the sidelines as a spectator watching the fight for freedom unfold on television.” And, “if I’m going to join the service, I’m going to aim for the highest and the best: the Marine Corps.”\n\n\"Later, in my senior years of command, it was my duty and my honored privilege, to present Purple Hearts to our wounded veterans. Unfortunately, too many of them were presented posthumously to their families. Those were the hard ones.”\n\n\"The Purple Heart medals “are not just a piece of metal,” Fike said. “Yes, it’s a symbol, but for a lot of these families, it’s the last tangible item they’ve ever received from their loved one. It actually brings closure to a lot of these families”"
