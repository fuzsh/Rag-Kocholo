        "text": "Congress designated the country's first federal holidays in 1870: granting paid time off to federal workers in the District of Columbia for New Yearâs Day, Independence Day, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. In 1888, it created Decoration Day, now known as Memorial Day.\n\nThe practice of honoring soldiers fallen in battle dates back thousands of years. Both the Greeks and Romans held annual days of remembrance each year for fallen soldiers, decorating their graves with flowers and holding public festivals and feasts in their honor. In Athens, public funerals for war dead were held after each battle. One of the first such public tributes took place in 431 B.C., with the Athenian general and statesman Pericles offering a funeral oration praising the sacrifice and valor of those killed in the Peloponnesian War, in a speech often compared to Lincolnâs Gettysburg Address.\n\nArlington National Cemetery, Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nIn the years following the end of the Civil War increasing numbers of American communities began ritually tending to the remains and graves of an unprecedented number of fallen soldiers. (All of the previous wars and conflicts fought by the United States combined barely add up to the body count the country suffered in the Civil War.)\n\nA few local springtime tributes to Civil War dead began even before hostilities had ceased. In Columbus, MS., April 25, 1866, it has been recorded that a group of women visited a cemetery to decorate the graves of Confederate soldiers who had fallen in battle at Shiloh. Nearby were the graves of Union soldiers, neglected because they were the enemy. Disturbed at the sight of the bare graves, the women placed flowers on their mounds as well.\n\nThree weeks after the Confederate surrender, on May 1, 1865, more than 1,000 people recently freed from enslavement, accompanied by regiments of the U.S. Colored Troops (including the Massachusetts 54th Infantry) and a group of white Charlestonians, gathered at a former war prisoner detention camp in Charleston, SC to consecrate a burial site for Union dead.\n\nNear the war's end, thousands of Union soldiers held as prisoners of war had been herded into a series of hastily assembled camps on the site of a former racetrack in Charleston. Conditions at one camp were such that more than 250 prisoners died from disease or exposure and had been buried in a mass grave behind the trackâs grandstand.\n\nThe gatherers sang hymns, gave readings and distributed flowers around the cemetery, which they dedicated to the \"Martyrs of the Race Course.\"\n\nCities in the North and South who claim to be the birthplace of Memorial Day.\n\nFor almost as long as thereâs been an observance, thereâs been a rivalry over who celebrated it first. All told, more than 20 towns claim to be the holidayâs birthplace. One has even received federal recognition. In 1966, 100 years after the town of Waterloo, New York, first shuttered its businesses and took to the streets for the first of many continuous, community-wide celebrations, President Johnson signed Congressional legislation declaring that tiny upstate village the âofficialâ birthplace of Memorial Day\n\nSome other contenders include the following:\n\nWarrenton, VA on June 3, 1861. The first Civil War soldier's grave ever to be decorated, according to a Richmond Times-Dispatch article in 1906, for the first soldier killed in action during the Civil War. (John Quincy Marr at the Battle of Fairfax Courthouse.\n\nSavannah, GA in July 1862. Women decorated the graves at Laurel Grove Cemetery of comrades who died at Battle of Manassas (First Battle of Bull Run).\n\nJackson, MS in April 26, 1865. One Sue Landon Vaughan is said to have decorated the graves of Confederate and Union soldiers. However, the earliest recorded reference to this event did not appear until many years after. Regardless, mention of the observance is inscribed on the southeast panel of the Confederate Monument in Jackson, erected in 1891.\n\nGettysburg, PA in 1863. The National cemetery dedication there included a ceremony of commemoration at the graves of dead soldiers. Some have therefore claimed that President Abraham Lincoln was the founder of Memorial Day.\n\nCarbondale, IL in 1866. Returning veterans, inspired by the sight of a young woman with infants at a small, unmarked grave in a church yard cemetery placing flowers and kneeling in prayer next to it, organized a memorial service to honor those who had died in the Civil War. Colonel E. J. Ingersoll, and General John A. Logan of the Union Army, led a procession to the town's Woodlawn Cemetery, where a number of Civil War soldiers had been interred.\n\nColumbus, GA in March 1866. Another Southern city named Columbus is credited by the United States National Park Service and numerous scholars for beginning Memorial Day observances in the South. The Ladies Memorial Association of Columbus members in a letter to newspapers in March 1866 asked for assistance in establishing an annual holiday to decorate the graves of soldiers throughout the South. It was reprinted by papers in several Southern states, and the plans were noted in newspapers in the North as well. On the chosen date, April 26, observances were held in Atlanta, Augusta, Macon, Columbus and elsewhere in Georgia as well as Montgomery, Alabama; Memphis, Tennessee; Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nBoalsburg, PA in October 1864. Only 100 miles away from Gettysburg, this small abolitionist community suffered multiple causalities throughout the Civil War. According to local historians, three local women, Emma Hunter, Elizabeth Meyer, and Sophie Keller, shared a bouquet of flowers on an autumnal Sunday and decorated the graves of their family members and friends. There are doubters of the veracity of Boalsburg's claim and its timing, but if true, the federal government might need to wrestle with the logistics of having to repurpose Memorial Day into a fall holiday.\n\nOn May 5, 1868, Maj. Gen. John A. Logan, by then head of the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), an organization of Union veterans, called for a nationwide day of remembrance later that month, declaring it \"Decoration Day,\" a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the war dead with flowers. Logan is generally considered the leading figure behind the effort to recognize Memorial Day as an official holiday. (He would in time serve as a U.S. Congressman and Senator from Illinois and in 1884 was a candidate for the vice presidency.)\n\nHeadquarters Grand Army of the Republic,\n\nWashington, D.C., May 5, 1868.\n\nGENERAL ORDERS\n\nNo. 11\n\nThe 30th day of May, 1868 is designated for the purpose of strewing with flowers or otherwise decorating the graves of comrades who died in defense of their country during the late rebellion, and whose bodies now lie in almost every city, village, and hamlet churchyard in the land. In this observance no form or ceremony is prescribed, but posts and comrades will in their own way arrange such fitting services and testimonials of respect as circumstances may permit\n\nThat first year, more than 27 states held some sort of ceremony, with more than 5,000 people attending a ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. General James Garfield made a speech and 5,000 participants decorated the graves of the 20,000 Civil War soldiers buried there.\n\nThe country embraced the notion of Decoration Day. Many Northern states held similar commemorative events and reprised the tradition in subsequent years; by 1890 each one had made Decoration Day an official state holiday. Southern states, on the other hand, continued to honor the dead on separate days until after World War I.\n\nIt was yet not an official holiday, but many local municipalities and states adopted resolutions over the following years that recognized Decoration Day as an official holiday in their areas. By 1890, every former state of the Union had adopted it as an official holiday.\n\nThe first Memorial Day observation at Arlington National Cemetery was held on the portico of Arlington House. Photographers used cameras with two lenses to capture twin images and these were then printed side-by-side on card stock in a format known as âstereoview cards.â When viewed through a Holmes stereoscope (invented by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr., father of the US Supreme Court justice), these cards yielded three dimensional images similar to 3D movies and images today. Arlington House, a stately mansion with a commanding view of the nationâs capital just across the Potomac River, was the former home of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his family, confiscated by the federal government after the war. (Library of Congress)\n\nFor more than 50 years, the holiday was used to commemorate those killed just in the Civil War. With Americaâs entry into World War I the tradition was expanded to include those lost in all wars.\n\nMemorial Day was not officially recognized nationwide until the 1970s, with America then embroiled in the Vietnam War. In 1968, the U.S. government passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act, which put major holidays on specific Mondays to give federal employees three-day weekends. Memorial Day was one of those holidays, along with Washington's Birthday, Labor Day and Columbus Day. The act also codified the name \"Memorial Day\" into law. The act officially went into effect in 1971\n\nPreparing to decorate graves, May 1899 (Library of Congress)\n\nIn the years following the Civil War, Lincoln's aspiration that we should be a nation characterized by malice toward none and charity for all visibly manifested itself in the magnanimity of Americans on both sides of the conflict. After having fought so fiercely over the country both loved, each side collectively extended an olive branch to mourn and to honor the estimated 620,000 men who gave \"the last full measure of devotion\" in that bitter conflict. (We should do so well today.)\n\nposted 5/28/22\n\nA Note to Our Readers\n\nAfter 80 years of serving veterans, and more than half a century of helping veterans and their dependents obtain the finest quality care and assistance in filing claims, the American Ex-Prisoners of War has made the difficult decision to cease certifying service officers as well as accepting new claims. The Veterans Administration OGC has agreed to put a notice on their website, and we are doing the same on ours with this notice. To our loyal NSOs, please accept our heartfelt gratitude for your years as accredited service officers with AXPOW. Many thousands of veterans and their families are also grateful for your help. Current, active claims will continue under our certification for the next couple of years as we wind down operations. Please let your claimants know that a new POA will need to be signed allowing you to continue representing them under another VSOâs accrediting authority.\n\nAgain, thank you for your service to the American Ex-Prisoners of War and all veterans.\n\nCheryl Cerbone\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nAmerican Ex-Prisoners of War\n\nposted 1/24/22\n\nRecollections of Christmases Past\n\nWhat are your fondest Christmas memories, made so many years ago? Mental images you carry with you even today, burned into your very identity. Likely, some from as far back as the impressionable years of early childhood. Warm and happy recollections, of moments that even today make the holiday season one of the more joyful events in your life each year.\n\nMany of our AXPOW members carry different, and darker, Christmas memories with them from the dispiriting, and sometimes seemingly endless, times thrust upon them as incarcerated prisoners of war in foreign lands far from their homes.\n\nNational Archives at College Park\n\nPublic domain, via Wikimedia Commons\n\nSome members felt compelled to recall those memories in the first-hand biographies they wrote out for our POW Biography database. Still fresh enough in their minds so long after the fact. Memories they could not let go of, and which no doubt shaped them just as did those happy Christmas recollections absorbed in innocent years. (Although most were not that removed from those innocent years when they went off to serve their country and fight for its freedoms. The burdens of war are borne disproportionately by the young.)\n\nThese stories are ones of deprivation, fear and uncertainty, dislocation and discouragement, but also of abiding hope and a very American will to endure, outlast and overcome their present circumstances.\n\nThis year as you pause to pray, give thanks or just enjoy this happy seasonal lull in our daily routines, take a moment to recall and offer a prayer of thanks for the men and women, some still living in our midst, many now in our memories, for the courage and commitment they showed in the field and in prison camps to secure that way of life we remain free to live today.\n\nHerewith, camp memories at Christmas time by POWs who fought in the European theater during World War II, as they themselves recorded them, drawn from the annals of our members' biographies.\n\nPowers, Harry, Army Air Force, 390 Bomb. Group, 571 BS, captured Sept. 14,1943, Dulag Luft, Germany, Stalag 17B, Krems, Austria, Braneau, Austria, Interned 247 days, Age 20.\n\n\"I think the uncertainty of what the next day would bring, along with the starvation, cold temperatures, fleas, and the second Christmas of still being there and constant threats of being shot was the worst. We dug a few tunnels but somehow the guards always found out about them, so there were no escapes. We were there for twenty months until our eighteen-day march west to Braneau, Austria. We were liberated on April 5th by Gen. George Patton. My weight was down to about 114 pounds—we were always hungry.\"\n\nLiner, Ernest G., Army Air Corps, captured Aug. 22,1944 in Germany, Stalag Luft 4, Interned 247 days, Age 23.\n\n\"Twenty-two men in our room and all of the rooms were alike. Each room had a little coal stove, and we got three bricks of coal a day. Bunks were built around the room, each three high and two wide. Peterson and I slept together, as most of us had one partner with whom we divided food, shared clothes and ate together.\n\nChristmas time was coming, which made it harder for everyone. One guy in our room suggested that we start saving our food for the holidays. Then the idea came to make a cake for Christmas day. Each one of us would give something from our parcels such as powdered milk, chocolate, sugar, or salt. When the day came we had lots of food and a beautiful, big cake. Some men in another room had fermented sugar, raisins and other things to make alcohol, and we traded some of our cake for enough alcohol for all of us to have a couple of swigs. The alcohol was very potent, especially on our empty stomachs with that rich cake. Years later there an article about our cake appeared in The American Legion Magazine, December 1957.\n\nSome of the men in our room had received musical instruments from home or they were able to get the guards to get instruments for them. These musicians would get together and play. At Christmas the Germans allowed us to use a large hall and the men with instruments gave a wild party. You should have seen the crazy dancing that was done. Until the last song, 'White Christmas,' was played. After that each one of us went back to our room with tears rolling down our cheeks.\n\nWe were getting some war news from a small radio, the size of a pack of cigarettes that had been smuggled in a piece at the time and kept secret all the time we were there. We could receive the BBC once a day on a certain wavelength. One person listened, and told some other men who, in turn, told other men in each of the other barracks to spread the news of the day.\"\n\nClark, John R, Army, captured Dec. 21. 1944 at Battle of the Bulge, Stalag 8A And 4B, Interned 113 days, Age 19.\n\n\"Clark's ordeal began with a three-day march from St. Vith, Belgium to Prum, Germany. They were given no food during the march. Finally, they reached a railhead, where they were loaded onto box cars, headed for POW camps. They had only been on the train for a part of the day before it had to stop because the American Air Force had bombed the trestles. The boxcars were moved to a siding. Later, an American P-51 shot up the train killing six and wounding 47. The soldier sitting on Clark's left and the one sitting on his right were both killed. Clark said the prisoners then broke the doors down and laid in the snow linking their bodies together to form the words 'USPW.' The plane came back and rolled its wing (in salute). This was the day before Christmas. We spent the night back in the rail cars. On Christmas, we got a half-loaf of bread and a spoon of jam. This was for two days.\n\nAfter marching for three days they were put on another train. Again, they were bombed by their own planes but finally reached the prison camps. During in processing, a German officer took all of Clark's possessions, handing him a receipt for the few dollars and francs he carried. Clark managed to hide two things from the officer, which would become crucial to him as times got tougher. Inside the pocket of his field jacket, Clark hid a tiny note paid he had picked up at an USO canteen. He used this note pad to keep a diary of his captivity and record his thoughts during his ordeal. He also managed to hide a small New Testament.\"\n\nCrawford, John J., Army, captured Dec. 19, 1944 at St. Vith, Stalag 9B, Bad Orb, Interned 104 days, Age 19.\n\n\"It was quiet for a few days. On the morning of December 19th they were shelled heavily. They were in a valley surrounded by trees. As John came out of the woods, his unit was told to throw down their guns.\n\nLuckily John ran back and got his overcoat, as they marched for three days in the bitter cold. At night they slept huddled together to keep warm. They were finally packed into boxcars for more traveling. The group was bombed one night by their Allies who did not know they were in the cars. Their Sergeant managed to climb out open the doors and they all scrambled for cover until it was over.\n\nOn Christmas day, they arrived at their destination, Stalag 9B, Bad Orb, Germany. John's first meal was grass soup. Later they received potato soup, which was a little better. There was very little food, showers were few, and body lice were plentiful.

After much walking and being loaded in 40X8 boxcars and bombed by the RAF on Christmas Eve, Hank arrived at Stalag IXB on December 25, 1944. He was transferred to Stalag IXA on January 25, 1945. After being liberated, Hank spent 3 to 4 weeks in hospitals in France. He had lost 55 pounds as a POW.\"\n\nJones William D., Army Air Corps, captured May 2, 1944 near Steyer, Austria, Dulag Luft, Stalag 17b, Interned 16 months, Age 20.\n\n\"To keep halfway sane I would count the grain in each board in the room. I spent a lot of time remembering the numbers on each board. Occasionally an ant or a bug would appear—it was a way to pass the time. When my last interrogation session had come, I sensed something was different, as I was given a 'Babe Ruth' candy bar, a 'Camel' cigarette from a fresh pack and seated before an SS officer. His English was excellent. He took a loose-leaf binder from a shelf behind him and announced, 'I know who you are—your mother's name is Blanche.' and you came from Manchester, Iowa. He showed me the newspaper item from the Manchester Press, my hometown paper.\n\nI was later led to an open area awaiting the trip to 17-B. On arriving at 17 -B, we were photographed and assigned a number. My German prison number was 106244. I was issued two blankets—one was a lace curtain, the other part of a carpet. It was several weeks before I got my first pair of resoled GI shoes and the blankets replaced. For our 1944 Christmas Day meal we had our usual cup of hot water for breakfast, I had five potatoes, all the size of a quarter or less and hot water for supper. Each Combine of 10 men got a loaf of bread, which was divided into 10 slices. Trying to divide oddly shaped loaves of bread 10 ways was one of many problems.\n\nI assembled a small crystal radio set. The powers in the camp wanted this outside source of information so I had help in getting needed items. The headset came into camp by a German guard for the price of a few cigarettes, as did the crystal. A coil was made by wrapping a Pepico tooth powder tube with wire and thread. The larger you made it, the greater the range, and a magnetized needle. Wiring in the barracks was such that we could unravel it. On barracks checks, etc., I carried the headset, which consisted of one earphone, around my waist. My set was working the night that news of D-Day came in. Each radio operator reported to a news team who in turn delivered the news to each barracks after all news was confirmed.\"\n\nKravetz, Frank A., Army Air Corps, captured Nov. 2, 1944 at Hanover, Germany, Dulag Luft, Obermassfeld, Nuremburg, Moosburg, Stalag VIIA, Interned six months, Age 21.\n\n\"There would be no Christmas joy for Frank A. Kravetz in 1944, That Dec. 25, Kravetz was recovering from burns and shrapnel wounds to his legs in a makeshift hospital for Allied prisoners of war in Obermassfeld, Germany.\n\nHe had been a POW since Nov. 2, 1944 when his B-17 bomber went down over Hanover, Germany. When he had first reached the hospital, set up in an old school, conditions were bearable. But by Christmas Day, 1944, the hospital was jammed with new patients, most of them young American soldiers wounded and captured in the Battle of the Bulge, Hitler's last-gasp effort to turn the tide of World War II in Western Europe.\n\nThen the hospital was overwhelmed with patients. The newly wounded were laid on stretchers on the floor between the bunks. Supplies of food and medicine were running low. 'In fact, you had guys literally dying left and right,' Kravetz remembered. The new patients brought with them devastating news. Prior to Hitler's massive winter offensive, launched Dec. 16, 1944, it was widely believed that Allied forces would quickly bring Germany's war machine to its knees. But information brought by the new patients dashed any hopes that the Nazis were ready to quit fighting. 'The Germans were overrunning our troops,' Kravetz said.\n\nRed Cross packages arrived in time for Christmas. Kravetz received a pipe and took tobacco from cigarettes to smoke it. Pitchers of beer were provided, and the Germans arranged for a midnight Mass to be celebrated in Kravetz's ward. Still, news of Germany's surprise offensive, which caught Allied commanders off guard, over-shadowed the gifts. 'Our morale at the hospital really went to a low ebb,' Kravetz admitted.\n\nAt one point I thought surely they were going to amputate my left leg because it was turning black,' Kravetz said, but a German surgeon saved the limb. Hanover's rail yards and train station were the targets of air raids by British and American planes. During the raids, Kravetz remained in bed instead of being taken to an underground shelter. 'Windows would shatter. Glass would fly. Beds would jump and everything else, it was just a horrible time to be alone. It would have been different if I had somebody with me to communicate with. I didn't have anybody,' Kravetz said.\n\nFrom Hanover, he was taken to the hospital staffed by the Allies in Obermassfeld. By the end of January 1945, Kravetz was scheduled to come home on a Swedish repatriation ship. But after the Battle of the Bulge 'There were a lot more higher priority people so I went way down on the list,' he said. He was sent next to a POW Camp called Stalag XIIID. After several weeks, he and other captives embarked on a 15-day forced marched to Stalag VIIA in Moosburg, Germany.\n\n'In the middle of February I arrived in Nuremburg, and was there until April 1 when we left by foot for Mooseburg (approximately 150 kilometers). We got there on April 15 and were liberated on April 29th.\n\nThe march was difficult. 'When you did stop to sleep, you slept in barns or under any kind of roof, whatever the Germans gave you. Or you just huddled together with someone else in the woods and just tried to sleep,' he explained. American forces liberated the Moosburg Camp on April 29, 1945. By then, Kravetz—who at the time of his enlistment had to lose weight to come in under the 175-pound limit—weighed just 125 pounds.\n\nI remember the Stars and Stripes going up over the barracks, the swastika coming down' Kravetz recalled. '(U.S. Gen. George) Patton came in and told us, \"Everybody stay put. Don't go roaming around the countryside because there are mines around. You fellas aren't in any kind of shape to be traipsing around a lot.\" For the first time in months, Kravetz ate a slice of white bread. The liberated POWs were also treated to hot chocolate. 'It made guys sick because it was too rich for them,' Kravetz recalled.\"\n\nHoag, Ralph E., Army, captured 12/23/42 at Long Stop Hill, Tunisia, Campo 98 Sicily, Campo 59 Italy Stalag 4B, 2B, 3B, 3A, Interned 851 days, Age 21.\n\n\"After motor patrols and a 600 mile truck ride across Algeria and Tunisia our Battalion met the German 10th Panzer Division at Long Stop Hill, near Medjez el Bab, Tunisia. We attacked at night, took the hill and found our unit was isolated when dawn came. Though a Corporal, I was a rifle squad leader due to the illness of our Sgt. On December 23, 1942, after several hours of rifle and grenade fire, low on ammunition and with several casualties, we surrendered . We were made to leave our wounded behind and instead made to carry German wounded to the rear. I was interrogated in Tunis by a German who had been a butcher in Chicago and returned to fight for the fatherland. On Christmas day, I was put into the anchor chain locker of an Italian destroyer which made the run to Palermo, Sicily. Spent a month at Campo 98, cold and with little food. Moved to Campo 59, Servigliano, Italy. After nine months, Italy capitulated, on Sept.10,1943, and I was free.

Until then, we'll have to muddle through somehow.\"\n\nMerry Christmas to all, and to all a good night.\n\nposted 12/20/21\n\nSong Book\n\nIn 1697 the British poet and playwright William Congreve penned what would become the most misquoted famous line in the history of English literature. In his play The Mourning Bride he makes a broad characterization of the power of music over the human condition: Musick has Charms to sooth a savage Breast, To soften Rocks, or bend a knotted Oak.\n\nWhat has come down to us today from that elegant phrasing, literally more often than not, is \"Music has charms to soothe the savage beast.\" And this is a not just a casual disservice.\n\nFirst, truncating the line loses the full scope of its meaning, vastly constricting the broad arc of the author's intent. He wasn't just trying to say music is a good sedative, he was saying music has multifarious, almost magical charms. Acting as a soporific for a creature's dyspeptic excesses is only one of them and probably not even the most magical.\n\nAnd second, he wasn't talking about animals.\n\nA writer of his pedigree deserves more punctilious treatment by posterity. You may never have heard of William Congreve, but he was no fluke. Later in the same play he offered up another gem with enduring luster. \"Heaven has no rage like love to hatred turned, / Nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.\" Two in one play! Positively Shakespearian. You knew who he was without even knowing who he was.\n\nBut mankind down through the ages did not need poetry to discern the ineffable interaction between the human psyche and the transformative power of music. It always had been and always will be recognized as a tonic for every range of circumstances confronting the human condition, even—maybe especially—war.\n\nIn America our wars have begotten catalogs of melodies that spoke to us, from rousing hymnals to both cheering and consoling ditties, and served to help both soldiers and their loved ones left at home to endure the struggles and uncertainties of their times.\n\nAttention Amazon Shoppers!\n\nMake any purchase through the Amazon Smile charity portal, and they'll make a donation to AXPOW—at no cost to you!

Lost in the human clutter of time. After all, music as a business grew up pretty much alongside our country. There may have been catalogs but there was little hard copy storage at first. Before the American Revolution, popular music was pretty much an oral tradition. Most people's exposure to published music was confined to church, occasional concerts and local stage productions, and family and communal traditions.\n\nThe world's oldest known musical score, Hurrian Hymn to Nikkal, discovered in the 1950s on a clay tablet inscribed with Cuneiform text. You can hear it played on YouTube at Hurrian Hymn\n\n(Photo author unknown. Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons)\n\nMusical notation, written-down notes and tunes, was developed even before parchment or paper. A cuneiform tablet of musical notation dating back to 2000 BC was discovered in what is today modern Iraq and/or Syria. But until the 15th century all musical notation was produced by hand and obviously not very widely distributed. The first printed sheet music wasn't pulled off the presses until 1473.\n\nThe late 19th century saw a massive explosion of \"parlor music,\" which generated growing interest in popular music, not to mention ownership of pianos and the wide dissemination of sheet music. And also piano lessons for children.\n\nThomas Edison invented the phonograph in 1877, but by the early 20th century recorded music and its broad popular consumption hadn't yet arrived. Then in the 1920s came commercial radio broadcasting. People knew not only all the songs but how they were really supposed to sound. This improved their singing but also encouraged a finer appreciation for just plain listening to music and enjoying its benefits on an intimate, personal level.\n\nNot surprisingly, that evolution can be traced through steady changes in the role and style of popular songs in American culture, from one war to the next.\n\nThe Civil War\n\nTwo songs most closely associated today with the Civil War, possibly thanks to Elvis Presley, are \"Dixie\" and \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" Maybe even back then.\n\nThe former is now broadly associated with the Confederate cause, although the song was written as a minstrel piece well before the onset of the war and enjoyed broad popularity on both sides of the Mason-Dixon Line. It was a personal favorite of Abraham Lincoln, who had it played frequently at political rallies and also following the White House announcement of Lee's surrender. Lincoln, born in Kentucky, called it \"one of the best tunes I ever heard.\"\n\nThe latter was an unabashed paean to the Union's opposition to the institution of slavery, written in 1861 for that purpose. The lyrics were the work of the abolitionist writer Julia Ward Howe put to the tune of \"John Brown's Body.\"\n\nCivil War Sing-Along\n\nDixie\n\n2nd South Carolina String Band (1850)\n\nBattle Hymn of the Republic\n\nOak Ridge Boys' William Lee Golden and others (1862)\n\nWhen Johnnie Comes Marching Home\n\nMitch Miller (1863)\n\nThe Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\n\nJoan Baez (1969)\n\n(Click song title to play.)\n\nBoth songs could be, indeed were at the time, seen as anthems for their respective sympathies, \"cause-related\" songs espousing the existential ideals of their respective sides, and, at least in the case of \"Battle Hymn,\" brimming with rectitude. \"Dixie\" was seen more as a song about pride of place, but just as serious an expression of sectarian loyalty and constancy.\n\nAmerican composer and bandmaster Patrick Sarsfield wrote \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\" in 1863, early in the war, while serving in the Union Army. Like many people at the time, the author expected the Civil War to end much sooner than it did. The song was immensely popular and was also sung by both sides, but as the war dragged on, its relevance faded.\n\nBut by the time of the Spanish American War (1898) it was a national hit again, its triumphal temper no doubt easier to savor in a war where the enemy's naval fleet was entirely destroyed in a single battle.\n\nSongs of a more personal nature, reflecting on the war's cost, casualties and personal loss certainly existed, but the thematic musical mainstream of America in the mid-19th century tended towards the martial and aspirational.\n\nA very popular song outside of this mainstream, expressing grief over the price of patriotism, was written by a southern sympathizing Canadian musician. But \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\" was penned in 1970. Not so many philosophical odes like it written at the actual time of the war. Distress in that time was more likely to take the form of rage than sorrow, in the public square at least. Joan Baez's version peaked at #3 on the Hot 100 on October 2, 1971. She had nothing to do with the original composition and even got the lyrics wrong in a couple of spots. But pretty voice.\n\nWorld War I\n\nThe U.S. was slow to enter the First World War. Fighting first broke out in the summer of 1914 between the \"Central Powers,\" led by Germany and Austria-Hungary, and the \"Allied Countries,\" Britain, France, and Russia. America was on the sidelines at the start. President Woodrow Wilson, elected two years before, was committed to American neutrality. He campaigned for reelection in 1916 on the slogan \"He kept us out of war.\"\n\nWorld War I Sing-Along\n\nPack Up Your Troubles in Your Old Kit-Bag\n\nNathan Lay (1912)\n\nIt's a Long Way to Tipperary\n\nAlbert Farrington (1912)\n\nKeep the Home Fires Burning\n\nJohn McCormack (1914)\n\nBless 'Em All\n\nD Day Darlings (1912)\n\nOh!

(1918)\n\n(Click song title to play.)\n\nOn May 7, 1915, a German U boat sank the British ocean liner Lusitania, killing more than 1,100 people including 128 Americans. In 1917, early in Wilson's second term, Germany greatly increased its attacks on American merchant ships and also attempted to meddle in U.S.-Mexican relations. This was enough to draw Wilson into the war on the side of the Allies. He called on Congress to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.\n\nUnderstandably, the war songs Americans heard on their Victrolas and newly acquired living room radio consoles at first bore a distinctly British or even French influence. The British style of war song was typically martial and upbeat, bursting with jaw-thrusting optimism. America's favorite songwriting patriot, George M. Cohan shortly rang up an American entry that did them all one better.\n\n\"Over There\" typified Cohan's personal brand of super-confident, unflappable, \"can-do\" Yankee patriotism. It was an instant hit and galvanized the nation. It boosted enlistments and had sold two million copies of sheet music and one million recordings by war's end. Cohan was later awarded a special Congressional Medal of Honor.\n\nBut in an age when popular music in general was blossoming, America's wartime musical tastes were beginning to change. \"Till We Meet Again\" tells the story of a soldier and his sweetheart parting as he heads off to the front. It became a sentimental favorite towards the close of the war. It was recorded by Henry Burr and Albert Campbell and in 1919 was declared the number one song of that year. And it had legs. It was subsequently recorded by at least 77 artists, including Doris Day, Bing Crosby and Patti Page.\n\n\"Keep the Home Fires Burning,\" called by some War Iâs greatest anthem, gained the hearts of the British public from its first public performance. By February 1916 over a million copies of the sheet music had been sold, and the song had been translated into at least six languages.\n\nThe words to \"Bless 'Em All\" were written by one Fred Godfrey from his experiences while serving with the Royal Naval Air Service in 1916 at Dunkirk during the First World War. At least that's his story. More likely he just wrote the words down. In point of fact, records suggest he didn't even join the RNAS until the following year. The song is thought to have originated in different versions, some quite salacious, as a popular protest song among airmen serving on India's Northwest Frontier.\n\nFar from being the cheerful expression of good wishes to the military bureaucracy they're often taken for, the lyrics offer a derisive \"so long\" from jaded \"time-expired\" men to the officers and non-coms who made their lives miserable during their just-completed tour and a sarcastic \"good luck\" to their innocent, dewy-eyed replacements.\n\nIt wasn't recorded until 1940 and gained wide popularity, with some sanitized lyrics, among troops throughout the British Commonwealth and the general public during World War II. Others have also claimed authorship of the lyrics. The music, it is generally agreed, was composed by Robert Kewley.\n\nWorld War II\n\nBy the 1940s America's musical mood was clearly turning much more up-close and personal. World War II's wartime music began to lean more toward feelings and emotion, romance and just \"smiling through\" in lieu of patriotic memes and morale-boosting. Not that patriotic and institutional songs disappeared from the scene.\n\nHe'd already made a songwriting name for himself in WWI with \"Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning,\" but Irving Berlin would become World War II's George M. Cohan, memorably adding \"God Bless America\" and \"This is the Army\" to the national playlist. The former he, too, had penned back in 1918 as a young recruit but set it aside. In 1938, he revised it as a peace song (and what he called a prayer of thanks from a grateful immigrant), and it was introduced on a 20th anniversary WWI Armistice Day celebration radio broadcast, sung by Kate Smith.\n\nWorld War II Sing-Along\n\nGod Bless America\n\nKate Smith (1918)\n\nWe'll Meet Again\n\nVera Lynn (1939)\n\nBoogie Woogie Bugle Boy\n\nAndrews Sisters (1941)\n\nThis is the Army Mr. Jones\n\nIrving Berlin (1942)\n\nWhite Cliffs of Dover\n\nVera Lynn (1942)\n\nTill Then\n\nThe Mills Brothers (1944)\n\nI'll Be Seeing You\n\nFrank Sinatra with Tommy Dorsey & His Orchestra (1944)\n\nLili Marlene\n\nMarlene Dietrich (1944)\n\n(Click song title to play.)\n\nSmith and the patriotic fervor she stirred during World War II contributed mightily to the sale of over $600 million ($10.6 billion in today's terms) in war bonds during her marathon radio broadcasts. No other show-business star came near her as a War Bond revenue producer. And there were many trying.\n\nSmith's star was dimmed in 2019 by criticism that songs done earlier in her career were racist in character. One was a 1931 rendition of \"Thatâs Why Darkies Were Born.\" The other, a 1933 recording of \"Pickaninny Heaven,\" made reference to watermelons. The New York Yankees discontinued playing her rendition of \"God Bless America\" during the seventh inning stretch of home games, and the Philadelphia Fliers removed the statue in Smith's honor that stood in front of their ice arena.\n\nBoth the revelation and the response may have been an overheated case of political correctness. The songs, while clearly patronizing by today's standards some 90 years later, hardly oozed racial disparagement. The first had been popularized by Paul Robeson, who, granted, may have been in a better position to carry it off. The second was from the movie Hello, Everybody! one of whose writers was Fannie Hurst.\n\nIt never remotely occurred to anyone to call either of those artists bigoted. The offending lyrics in retrospect appear more a reflection of an era than of racial animus. Smith herself gave an address espousing racial tolerance on CBS Radio in 1945. O tempora o mores.\n\nThen there were the Andrews Sisters: Maxene, LaVerne, and Patty. They were already popular music headliners when the war began who remade themselves as Uncle Sam's boogie-woogie ambassadors extraordinaires, entertaining Allied forces extensively on bases in Africa, Italy and the U.S.\n\nThey too promoted war bond sales, with a rendition of Irving Berlin's song \"Any Bonds Today?\" They also helped actress Bette Davis and actor John Garfield found California's famous Hollywood Canteen, volunteering their time to sing and dance for visiting servicemen. They volunteered their time at the New York Servicemen's Canteen as well.\n\nTheir signature wartime hit, \"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,\" introduced in the 1941 Abbott and Costello film Buck Privates reached number six on the U.S. pop singles chart and is ranked No. 6 on the Recording Industry Association of America's \"Songs of the Century\" list.\n\nIn 1944, the U.S. Office of Strategic Services (OSS) initiated a series of musical propaganda broadcasts designed to demoralize enemy soldiers. They asked Marlene Dietrich to record a number of songs in German for the project and she readily agreed.\n\nDietrich, German-born but living in America since 1930, was by the time of the war a well-established Hollywood star. She had become an American citizen in 1939 and was appalled by Nazism.\n\nOne of her songs, \"Lili Marleen\" as it was titled then, became a massive success, not least on German-language OSS radio, where it was the station's theme song.\n\nIn addition to her OSS recordings, during 1944 and '45 Dietrich performed \"Lili Marlene\" extensively abroad while entertaining some half a million allied troops and war prisoners across North Africa and Europe, including in Germany. Filmmaker Billy Wilder once quipped she was on the front lines more than Eisenhower.\n\nShe re-recorded the song in 1944, and versions were released on Decca Records in the US and internationally, in both English and German, as \"Lili Marlene, like her own name. She spread the tune all over the United States and Europe, via both radio performances and live shows. (Her original OSS recording remains to this day unissued.)\n\nBut Dietrich was actually late to the party with Lili Marlene. The first to record it, as \"Lili Marlen,\" was a German singer, Lale Andersen, in 1939. Initial sales were not encouraging: only 700 copies. But that was to change, albeit by chance. After the Nazis overran Yugoslavia, Radio Belgrade, recommissioned as the German forces' radio station, commenced to playing the song over and over, primarily because of a lack of other recordings. And it quickly caught on with German soldiers throughout Europe and North Africa.\n\nAll except with Nazi propaganda Chief Joseph Goebbels. He didn't care for the song, the story goes, because it wasn't a march (how like a Nazi) and because he didn't like the German songstress, who, it was rumored, associated with Jews and openly criticized the Nazi regime. Gossip like that did a girl's musical career no good in Germany at that time.\n\nBut Radio Belgrade was getting bushels of letters from Axis soldiers all over Europe and Africa asking them to play it again. Allies, too, heard the broadcasts and were just as captivated. Many Allied soldiers made a point of tuning into Radio Belgrade just to listen to \"Lili Marlen\" at the end of each day.\n\nWhoever that girl back home was that it reminded them all of, she must have really been something.\n\nBut Goebbels, undaunted, still wanted the song banned. However, the story continues, it turned out General Erwin Rommel, commander of the Afrika Korps, Germany's \"Desert Fox,\" was one of \"Lili Marlen's\" many, many fans and \"requested\" of the radio station that it be played for his troops every night. So Goebbels backed off, and the song became Radio Belgradeâs signature sign-off, every night at 9:55 p.m.\n\nAnd so it was that by the end of World War II, \"Lili Marlene,\" thanks to two unlikely \"Krauts\" and one unlikely \"Yank,\" was said to be, by whatever name, the most popular song in the world.\n\nVietnam\n\nWartime music in the '60s was a different affair. It was a frenetic time: civil rights struggles (sometimes tragically violent), generational mistrust, Watergate, unusually rebellious youth for whom Vietnam was an unpopular war, a disaffected drop-out culture and rampant mind-altering drug usage. In the words of Bob Dylan, \"There was music in the cafes at night and revolution in the air.\"\n\nHow frenetic really? Consider that the Moon Walk, Chappaquiddick, the Manson murders and Woodstock all took place within weeks of each other in the summer of 1969. A year later, four students were killed and nine others wounded at Kent State University by Ohio National Guard troops. As it always does, the music of the times largely reflected those times. Often hostile and antagonistic. (When it wasn't about surfing and fast cars: this is popular music we're talking about.)\n\nA hint of what was in store came in a little noted and probably poorly remembered 1966 song by Simon and Garfunkel. This uncomplicated and melodious young duo was hardly a protest act, and \"7 o'clock News / Silent Night\" was hardly a protest song. It provided an ironic interplay between the events of a typically disconcerting (and real) daily news report and the dreamy mood of a peaceful Christmas Carol.\n\nThe disjunction might be cheekily described in modern times as a \"woke\" moment. It was a harbinger of where we were going with Vietnam and the other thorny concerns of those tense times. Merry Christmas.\n\nCreedance Clearwater Revival was a hot vocal group throughout the '60s and '70s and reputedly a huge favorite among servicemen in Vietnam as well as young people back home. A number of its songs, like \"Who'll Stop the Rain,\" \"Run Through the Jungle,\" \"Bad Mood Rising,\" and Fortunate Son,\" were received by fans as more or less coded allegories about the war in southeast Asia.\n\nJohn Fogerty, the band's front man, lead guitarist and principal songwriter, dispelled those beliefs. His songs often evoked an air of apocalyptic unease, but the source of the angst wasn't generally Vietnam. The first was about Fogerty's fears, eventually confirmed, over his band breaking up; the second was an alarmum about growing gun violence in America; and the third he was inspired to write after watching the movie The Devil and Daniel Webster.\n\nThe fourth song, \"Fortunate Son,\" actually dealt with class distinctions in American society. In much the same vein as Bruce Springsteen's \"Born in the USA,\" released in 1984. Both songs had inferential ties to Vietnam (as in, the fortunate sons were not in Vietnam fighting) but those inferences were tangential to the core message of either song.\n\n\"Galveston,\" a song written by Jimmy Webb and popularized by American country music singer Glen Campbell, was unarguably about Vietnam, without ever mentioning the war by name. In 2003, it ranked number 8 in the 100 Greatest Songs in Country Music and number 1 on the country music charts. It reached number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the \"Easy Listening\" charts. It was certified gold by the RIAA in October 1969. Not bad for an unnamed war song.\n\n\"Ballard of the Green Berets\" was a popular song that unabashedly cast both Vietnam and the military in a positive light. And was well-received for it. In 1966 it reached the No. 1 spot for five weeks on the Hot 100 and four weeks on Cashbox. It also reached No. 1 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart and No. 2 on Billboard's Country survey. \"Ballard of the Green Berets\" and \"California Dreamin'\" by the Mommas and the Papas were tied for #1 in the Cashbox end-of-year survey for 1966.\n\nTony Orlando and Dawn's \"Tie a Yellow Ribbon 'Round the Old Tree\" is about a man returning from prison, not Vietnam. But soldiers in-country appeared to relate to it in a big way just the same. The shoe fit, so to speak.\n\nThe origin of the yellow ribbon as a badge of constancy likely dates back to the 19th-century practice of women wearing a yellow ribbon in their hair to signify devotion to a husband or sweetheart serving in the U.S. Cavalry, which may have inspired the John Wayne movie \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon.\"\n\nVietnam War Sing-Along\n\n7 o'clock News / Silent Night\n\nSimon and Garfunkel (1966.)\n\nBallard of the Green Berets\n\nSgt.

The tradition didn't surface broadly until 1980, when 52 American embassy workers were taken hostage in Iran.\n\nOne theory argues that the yellow ribbon as a modern sympathetic symbol began in 1975 with Gail Magruder, wife of Watergate figure Jeb Magruder. She put yellow ribbons around her porch to welcome her husband home from prison.\n\nA senior member of Richard Nixon's Committee to Reelect the President, Magruder pled guilty to a single-count indictment for his role in the botched Watergate Hotel burglary and ensuing cover-up. He was sentenced by Judge John Sirica to a term of ten months-to-four years, of which he served seven months. And his wife was at home waiting for him, with a lot of yellow ribbon. Nobody really thought Magruder was the brains of the operation. He went on to become a Presbyterian minister.\n\nAnother song favorite of soldiers in Vietnam was \"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\" by raucous British rockers The Animals, fronted by the booming-voiced Eric Burton.

Another Animals recording, \"The House of the Rising Sun,\" was also very popular in the camps in the Delta. Same with Jimmy Hendrix, who reputedly avoided Vietnam by pretending he was gay.

Minds will automatically start racing ahead to daydreams of holiday cheer, family reunions, good times with friends and a general bon ami of good will towards men and peace on earth.\n\nSo it is every year as days grow short and the air grows chilly. And so it was as winter approached in 1944. Particularly vibrant that year was that last daydream: peace on earth. At long last, the second great war in the first half of the twentieth century was grinding towards an end. Like Christmas, drawing palpably close.\n\nNow would be a good time to reflect back on that dawning Christmas season, which instead turned out to presage one the darker periods of World War II, dashing hopes and holiday reveries.\n\nIn early December 1944, German resolve was seen to be near exhaustion. The Soviets, for all of the mutual mistrust and growing rivalry among the Allies, was steadily moving in from the east, vivified by the Nazis' humiliating retreat from the very doorstep of Moscow. The western Allies, having liberated France, were advancing on the Brandenburg gate. The feeling was growing that the war in Europe was almost at its end.\n\nThen, on December 16, 1944 Germany sprang its Ardennes Counteroffensive, The Battle of the Bulge. The end of the war was just the beginning of the end of the war, it turned out. The \"Bulge\" was the largest and bloodiest battle fought by the United States in World War II and the third-deadliest campaign in American history.\n\nThe battle's name came from of the westward-bulging shape of battle lines drawn on a map. The fighting lasted six weeks, from mid-December until the end of January. It was the largest land battle of World War II that the United States directly participated in. More than a million men fought in the counteroffensive: 600,000 Germans, 500,000 Americans, and 55,000 British. It would turn out to be the last major German offensive campaign on the Western Front.\n\nWinston Churchill called The Battle of the Bulge \"the greatest American battle of the war.\" But that's not what it felt like at the start. The allied command was caught completely of guard, and the surprise German attack broke through the front on its very first day.\n\ncredit: Public domain\n\nClick on map to enlarge\n\nThe Germans launched their attack in the densely forested Ardennes region comprising eastern Belgium, northeast France, and Luxembourg. American forces bore the brunt of the melee, which created higher casualties than any other operation of the war.\n\nHitler's hope was that the counteroffensive would both halt Allied use of the Belgian port of Antwerp and split the Allied lines, thus allowing German forces to encircle four Allied armies and force the West to negotiate a peace treaty more favorable to the Axis powers.\n\nApproximately 250,000 soldiers took part in the initial assault, 14 German infantry divisions guarded by five panzer divisions-against a mere 80,000 Americans\n\nThe Battle of the Bulge was fought in frigid weather conditions, with some 30 German divisions attacking battle-fatigued American troops across 85 miles of thick woods. It would be the costliest battle ever fought by the U.S. Army, which suffered nearly 100,000 casualties. The Ardennes was hacked into chaos by the fighting as GIs dug in against the German advance at St.-Vith, Elsenborn Ridge, Houffalize and Bastogne.\n\nThe timing of the attack was no accident. Freezing rain, snow drifts and record-breaking low temperatures gave an added stinging aspect to the Counteroffensive. \"I was from Buffalo, I thought I knew cold,\" baseball Hall of Famer and WWII veteran Warren Spahn wrote in his book, The Love of Baseball. \"But I didn't really know cold until the Battle of the Bulge.\"\n\nAnother Nazi stratagem was to attempt to infiltrate the Allied troops and spread confusion and disarray. German paratroopers had been dropped behind US lines dressed like American soldiers. They changed road signs, cut telephone lines and fed U.S. troops false directions.\n\n\"The Nazis were carefully groomed for their dangerous mission,\" Life magazine reported in 1945. \"They spoke excellent English and their slang had been tuned up by close association with American prisoners of war in German camps.\" To combat infiltrators, U.S. troops learned to challenge suspected Germans with American trivia questions.\n\nOn the morning of December 16, the German divisions struck, in heavy fog, along a 50-mile front. They were outfitted in white uniforms to blend in with the snow. They pushed American forces west, back nearly to the Meuse River, and surrounded the town of Bastogne in Belgium.\n\nThe German offensive lasted for more than a month, yet the first four days accounted significantly for the outcome. The battle of the Bulge actually comprised a series of distinct separate regional battles as might be expected along such a long front.\n\nThe Siege of Bastogne: The goal of the German offensive was the harbor at Antwerp. In order to reach it before the Allies could regroup and bring their superior air power to bear, German mechanized forces had to seize the roadways through eastern Belgium. Because all seven main roads in the Ardennes mountain range converged on the small town of Bastogne, control of its crossroads was vital to the German attack. The siege ran December 20-27 at which point the besieged American forces were relieved by elements of General George Patton's Third Army.\n\nThe Battle for Clervaux: The battle for this town in northern Luxembourg lasted from December 16-18. German forces encircled numerically inferior American forces, and, after heavy fighting, forced them to surrender. The battle has been referred to as the Luxembourg \"Alamo.\" The first tank battle of the Ardennes offensive ended in disaster for the Allies, who lost nearly 60 tanks to the Germans' four. Still, the stubborn resistance of the military units involved greatly slowed the German advance.\n\nBattle of Lanzerath Ridge: Fought on the first day of the Counteroffensive, near the town of Lanzerath, Belgium, this day-long conflict matched 18 men belonging to an American reconnaissance platoon, four U.S. Forward Artillery Observers, against a battalion of about 500 German paratroopers. The American reconnaissance men inflicted dozens of casualties on the Germans and bottled up the advance along a key route planned for the German SS Panzer Division that was spearheading the entire German 6th Panzer advance. The Germans finally flanked the American forces at dusk and captured them. One American, an artillery observer, was killed and 14 others wounded, while German casualties totaled 92. The Germans then fatally paused their advance, believing the woods were filled with more Americans and tanks.\n\ncredit: Public domain\n\nTanks and infantrymen of the Company G, 740th Tank Battalion, 504th Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division, push through the snow near Herresbach, Belgium, January 28, 1945.\n\nBattle of St. Vith: The town of St. Vith stood at a vital road junction on the way to Antwerp. It was also close to the western end of the Losheim Gap, a critical valley through the densely forested ridges of the Ardennes Forest and a focal point of the entire German Counteroffensive. Allied troops eventually fell back from their defense of the town on December 21. Given that the Germans' plan was to capture St. Vith by December 17, the prolonged action in and around the town presented yet another major blow to their objectives.\n\nThe Elsenborn Ridge: A ridge line east of the town of Elsenborn, Belgium was the main line of advance for Hitler's prized 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. However, units of First U.S. 1st Army held the ridge preventing German forces from reaching a vast array of supplies near the cities of Liége and Spa, Belgium and the road network leading west to the Meuse River and Antwerp. This was the only sector of the American front line where the Germans failed to advance during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\ncredit: Braun, USA / Public domain\n\nAmerican 290th Infantry Regiment infantrymen fighting in snow during the Battle of the Bulge.\n\nLosheim Gap: Accounts of the Battle of the Bulge generally focus on the Siege of Bastogne and the Battle of St. Vith. But the Germans' primary ambitions were focused on taking the Losheim Gap, a narrow five-mile long valley on the border of Belgium and Germany. It is the only region conducive to military movement. In this region of thick forests, US troops halted the best of German war machine, including the 12th SS Panzer and the 3rd Fallschirmjager Divisions.\n\nOperation Bodenplatte: On January 1, the Luftwaffe attempted a campaign to cripple Allied air forces in the Low Countries. The goal was to gain air superiority during the stagnant stage of the Battle of the Bulge so that the German Army and Waffen-SS forces could resume their advance. It was originally planned for December 16 but delayed repeatedly due to bad weather until New Year's Day, the first day that happened to be suitable. Secrecy for the operation was so tight that not all German ground and naval forces had been informed of the operation and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire.\n\nIn point of fact, while delivering harsh doses of reality to Allied Christmas hopes of a pending victory, ultimately the Battle of the Bulge was probably doomed from its inception. By that point in the war, Germany simply lacked the manpower and resources to maintain such an ambitious offensive for any sustained period of time, much less muster what would be required to reverse their by-then untenable defensive posture. As it turned out, the Counteroffensive wound up costing the Nazis more in lost men and expended matériel than it did the Allies, as expensive as it was to the latter.\n\nLen Fullenkamp, a retired U.S. Army Colonel and a professor of military history and strategy at the Army War College, postulates that Hitler mistakenly believed American commanders would not be able to respond the German Counteroffensive with necessary rapidity.\n\nFullenkamp writes that the success of the German attack relied heavily on the presumption of temporary paralysis within the Allied high command. Hitler presumed his enemy's generals would have to clear counterattack plans through higher military and political channels as would have been the case within Germany's command structure.\n\nBut General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Supreme Allied Commander, had long enjoyed the authority to act on his own initiative, which he did. On December 16, the first day of the Counteroffensive, Eisenhower ordered Armored divisions posted to the north and south of the Bulge into the flanks of the German offensive.\n\nAlso, notwithstanding surprise, unpreparedness and early setbacks, Allied forces fought well enough to slow the German drive to secure the road network at Bastogne and to defend St. Vith and other key Nazi objectives. They held off German attackers for almost seven days, effectively stalling the German command's strategic timetable.\n\nOn December 23, American forces began their first counterattack on the southern flank of the \"Bulge,\" The encirclement of Bastogne finally broke with American units pushing from the north and south, and the German advance stopped. In addition, British paratroopers and infantry units began an attack on the western tip of the German advance.\n\nThe Library of Congress website features an informative interactive timeline depicting key dates of \"The Battle of the Bulge\" as told through the actual daily situation maps made for the US Military VIII Corps. It can be reached by clicking on this map.\n\nOn January 1, the Germans launched two new operations aimed at opening second fronts in Holland and northern France. The Luftwaffe launched its bombing campaign against Allied airfields and succeeded in destroying or severely damaging more than 460 aircraft. But in the process it suffered massive losses of its own: 277 planes. While the Allies recovered quickly from their losses, the Luftwaffe could not.\n\nThe Battle of the Bulge was more than an embarrassing setback for the Allied military command. It proved a very expensive one for the country in general and in a very personal way for the men who fought in it. Early in the war the bulk of American POWs in Europe were pilots and bomb crews. While in the European theatre 93,941 Americans in total would be held as prisoners of war in all of World War II, in the Battle of the Bulge alone 23,554, mainly infantrymen, were taken prisoner by Germans —4,000 in one day.\n\nThe most infamous massacre of American troops in World War II took place during the Battle of the Bulge: The Malmedy Massacre. On December 17, 1944, halfway between the town of Malmedy and Ligneuville in Belgium, an American battalion was captured by an SS force. About 150 POWs were disarmed and sent to stand in a field. About 80 men were killed by gunfire, and their bodies were left where they fell. Many prisoners escaped into nearby woods.\n\nCost of the Battle of the Bulge in Lost Manpower and Matériel U.S. U.K. Nazi Germany 89,500 killed, wounded, missing or captured 1,408 (200 killed, 969 wounded, and 239 missing) 63,222 - 98,000 killed, wounded, missing or captured) 733 tanks and tank destroyers lost 554 tanks, tank destroyers and assault guns lost 1,000 aircraft lost, over 647 in December and 353 during Unternehmen Bodenplatte 800 aircraft lost, at least 500 in December and 280 during Unternehmen Bodenplatte Approximately 3,000 civilians killed\n\n(Statistics compiled by Wikipedia)\n\nThe Malmedy Massacre is regarded as the worst atrocity committed against American troops during the course of the war in Europe. Why it happened is not entirely clear. No record of any order by an SS officer was ever found. The shooting of POWs was common on the Eastern front, but rare on the Western front.\n\nAmerican forces recaptured the site where the killings took place in mid-January and recovered the bodies of the murdered soldiers. After the war, the SS soldiers were tried in the Malmedy Massacre Trial. Forty-two former SS officers were sentenced to death, although no death penalty was ever carried out. Most served sentences varying from 10 years to life imprisonment.\n\nPOWs from the Battle of the Bulge were often among the lower ranks and generally not accorded the benefits of proper shelter during that winter. To make matters worse, many were subjected to long death marches as their captives maneuvered them away from advancing American and Russian armies.\n\nMen who were underfed and inaequately clothed, some without even shoes, sleeping in barns or open fields, succumbed in great numbers from exposure to the natural elements of the winter of 1944-45 and froze to death or died of dysentery during the forced marches.\n\nFrom a total of 257,000 western Allied prisoners of war held in German military prison camps, over 80,000 POWs were forced to march westward across Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany in extreme winter conditions, over about four months between January and April 1945.\n\nPOWs from Luft IV marched 800 miles in 86 days from the Eastern to the Western Front and then back again. Estimates of the total who perished in the marches run to 3,000 or more.\n\nOn January 7, Hitler began pulling back from the Ardennes. The last of the German reserves were gone, the Luftwaffe had been broken, and Russian troops were casting their shadows on Germany's eastern edge. Her defeat at last loomed, mere months away. But won at far greater expense than had been envisioned by Allied leaders, and a hopeful American public, in the waning days of 1944.\n\nOn April 30, during the Battle of Berlin, the last major offensive of the European theatre, Adolf Hitler committed suicide in his bunker.\n\nOn May 8, the Allies accepted Germany's unconditional surrender, and 7.6 million soldiers began the ritual of demobilization. It took about four months, and many GIs complained about the slowness of the process.\n\nAll that were coming home made it in time for Christmas 1945.\n\nposted 11/14/20\n\nIn Their Own Words ....\n\nPersonal accounts by POWs of their last—or first—moments of freedom and the personal challenges of capture and captivity that fell in between.

William W. Williams III\n\nI n the summer of 1942 I was the signalman aboard the SS Carlton, a Merchant Marine vessel bound for Murmansk, Russia with military supplies. She was sunk by a torpedo from a German U Boat on the morning of July 5 in the devastation of convoy PQ 17, 350 miles north of Norway.\n\n[Editor's Note: William W. Williams III was sailing as a member of the Navy Armed Guard. Armed Guard units were established in the early days of World War II in an attempt to provide defensive firepower to merchant ships traveling in convoy or alone. The ships and men of the merchant marine were what transported the war materiel, supplies, equipment and even troops needed to fight and win the war.\n\nThe Merchant Marine suffered a casualty rate higher than any other branch of the military, losing 9,300 men. Most of the losses occurred in 1942. The United States Navy Armed Guard (USNAG) were U.S. Navy-enlisted gun crews (Gunner's Mates, Coxswains and Boatswains, Radiomen, Signalmen, Pharmacist's Mates and, toward the end of the war, radarmen serving at sea on merchant ships.\n\nThe vessels in the Carlton's convoy was proceeding under a close British and US naval escort but were left unguarded and then scattered after covering cruiser forces withdrew to intercept a German raiding flotilla. The convoy subsequently lost 24 of its 35 ships in a week of daylight attacks by German U-boats and aircraft, and the Carlton was one of those lost.]\n\ncourtesy Peabody Essex Museum, Salem, Massachusetts.\n\nSS Carlton\n\nI was one of 24 \"rescued\" by German seaplanes (the rest of the crew drifted, rowed and sailed for nearly three weeks, landed in Norway, and joined us in Milag-Marlag Nord much later.)\n\n(Copyright unknown)\n\nSS Carlton aflame after being torpedoed in Arctic Ocean.\n\nWe who were picked up landed in Kirknes, Norway, and were incarcerated in Stalag 322, a camp for dissident Norwegian schoolteachers. I was given a dog tag hammered out of a tin can with the number: 322/1927, my identification for the entire time—I still have it!\n\nOn a German cargo ship we reached Oslo, Norway. On a larger and faster ship we came to Aarlborg, Denmark, and by train to Wilhelmshaven, Germany. Because we were the first Americans to be captured, and there were no American camps at the time, we were taken to Milag-Marlag Nord, in Tarmstedt, a short way from Bremen, a stalag for British Navy prisoners.\n\nNon-commissioned officers were not required to work, and I could have remained there for the rest of the war, but I wished to escape. So, I exchanged identity with a British seaman who was being forced to work. In April 1943, posing as Henry Rose of England, I went by train to Charlottenhof, Obersilesia, to work with a small group of prisoners repairing an irrigation canal.\n\nFive days later, another prisoner and I walked off the job. We thought we had everything planned, except that we didn't know about the tracking dogs in the next village. They soon found us, and we surrendered and were separated. I was taken to Stalag 8B in Lamsdorf.\n\nA short time after, I was called to headquarters, presented with my original dog-tag (322/1927), and sentenced to five days solitary confinement on bread and water for escaping and trying to confuse my kind \"rescuers.\" I never found out how they discovered the switch in identity.\n\nAt that time (April 1943), an American Army sergeant and I were the only Americans in 8B. Because we were non-British, we were housed in compound 10 with prisoners from India, Australia, New Zealand, North Ireland, Greece and Canada. The Canadians were from the Black Watch Division and had been captured in the failed landing at Dieppe, France. Because of circumstances surrounding their capture, they were forced to wear handcuffs day and night.\n\n[Editor's note: As the only sailor in camp Bill was affectionately given the nickname \"Seaweed,\" which stayed with him for the rest of his days and is inscribed on his gravestone.]\n\nWhile in 8B, I began attending church services and was called into the Christian ministry. After the war, I returned home, went to college and seminary, and am now a retired American Baptist minister.\n\nIn February of 1944, I was transferred to Stalag 2B in Hammerstein, Pommerania, an all American camp. I became the acting chaplain when the present chaplain was repatriated. In this capacity, I went out of the camp for many weekends to hold services at the various arbeits kommandos.\n\nI was in the city of Danzig in January of 1945 when the Russian army broke through on the Eastern Front. The city was evacuated, and I was on the last train to leave the city.\n\nBy early February, the Russians were approaching Stalag 2B, and the camp was abandoned by the Germans. We were placed in groups of three hundred or more and headed west on foot.\n\n[Editor's Note: In the final stages of World War II in Europe, as the Soviet Army advanced into Germany, Allied POWs, without adequate rest, shelter, food, clothing and medical supplies, were force-marched westward in groups of 200 to 300 in the so-called \"Long March.\" German authorities had decided to evacuate their POW camps in order to delay liberation of the prisoners.\n\nFrom a total of 257,000 western Allied prisoners in German military prison camps, over 80,000 were forced to walk across Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Germany in extreme winter conditions over a period of some four months.\n\nAt the same time, hundreds of thousands of German civilian refugees, most of them women and children, as well as civilians of other nationalities, were also making their way westward on foot.\n\nJanuary and February 1945 were among the coldest winter months of the 20th century in Europe. The march from Stalag VIII-B (referred to as the \"Lamsdorf Death March\") was similar to the better-known Bataan Death March (1942) in terms of mortality rates. Official sources estimate that 1,121 U.S. POWs did not survive.]\n\nAfter wandering around for sixty days, we crossed the Elbe River at Domitz. On April 14, we were strafed by American planes and I ran away. I was lucky to come upon an American outpost and was free at last!\n\n[Editor's Note: (The following account was provided by Rev. Williams's daughter.) \"After he escaped and made it to the American army encampment, Bill played an instrumental role in rescuing the 300 prisoners he had left behind. He led an army truck convoy back to where his fellow marchers had become pinned down in a firefight with German soldiers. He was in the front seat of the first truck waving frantically to his friends, who at that point must have figured they had pretty much run out of luck.\"]\n\nBy truck I went to Hildesheim, by plane to LeHavre and Camp Lucky Strike, where I rejoined some of the men from my ship whom I had not seen since my first escape. By plane together, we went to England and by ship to Boston, MA and home.\n\nEpilogue:\n\nFor many years after my return, I entertained the hope of revisiting the sites where I had been held as a prisoner of war. Finally it became possible. My son William W. Williams IV and I flew out of Logan airport in Boston on Oct. 10, 2000 at noon and landed at Tegel in Berlin.\n\nWe picked up our rental car and headed for Bremen where we stayed the first night. In the morning we traveled east to Tarmstedt, the location of Milag-Marlag Nord, just eighteen miles away. It had been a camp for enemy Navy and Merchant Marine sailors and was where I spent the first nine months of my captivity.\n\nDuring my 33 1/2 months I was also in Stalag 344/8B in Lamsdorf, Obersilesia for ten months, and lastly in Stalag 2B, Hamerstein, Pomerania for twelve months, followed by a sixty-day march in the winter of 1945, from which I escaped.\n\nTo conserve travel time, we decided to go to 2B next and then to 8B before returning to Berlin for the trip home.\n\nMILAG-MARLAG NORD: Our first stop in Tarmstedt was at a bank to exchange some currency, and begin our inquiry to locate the camp. No one in the bank could speak English, but as I am still conversant in Deutsch, I said I had been a \"Kriegsgefangener\" there in 1942, and wanted to visit the area.\n\nAn elderly farmer was in the bank cashing a check. When he heard the word \"Kriegsgefangener\" he came right over to us and said \"Warten sie hier, bitte\", and then went to the telephone.\n\nWilliam W. Williams III, USNAG Signalman, at ease\n\nHe had asked me to wait while he called the Burgermeister (Mayor), who knew all about the prison camp and would like to meet us. We got in the car and followed him to the mayor's house.\n\nWhat a stroke a luck! We could never have found it by ourselves. The entire area had been demolished and obliterated and planted to forest some forty years ago.\n\nThe mayor took us in his own car down an old logging road to one lone barracks that had been preserved in the middle of the forest. It was now a private dwelling.\n\nThat is all there is left of a compound that held Royal Navy sailors and Merchantmen since 1940 and the crew of my ship which had been sunk in 1942. Incidentally, the area is now called \"Westertimke.\"\n\nA single barracks: all that is left.\n\nThe mayor told us of the editor of a nearby newspaper who had collected a documentary of the camp. After good-bye to the mayor and the farmer, we headed for the town of Zeven, and found the newspaper office. The editor himself was not available, but had left word for one of the staff to take us upstairs to the archives and show us newspaper size photographs of the camp taken through the years. On the table was a documentary brochure that had been printed and was for us to take home.\n\nSTALAG 2B HAMERSTEIN: Our next destination was Stalag 2B. That was the last camp I was held from Feb. 1944 to Feb. 1945, when it was abandoned in the face of the Russian advance from the East. The camp was broken up into groups of three or four hundred men and marched on foot westward, wandering seemingly aimlessly until we reached Saltzwedel some sixty days later. That's where I left the column and liberated myself into the hands of an American gun emplacement.\n\nI remembered most of the towns through which we had passed: Stargard, Stettin, Neubrandenburg, Teterow, Gustrow, Parchim, Ludwigslust, Domitz.\n\nStarting with Saltzwedel, my son and I retraced my footsteps in reverse, crossing the Elbe River at Domitz, where we spent the night at a country inn. I was anxious to see again the town of Parchim where our march group passed the end of an airport runway lined with fire engines manned by women, and from which experimental jets took off. After the war, it was occupied by the Russian military who used it as a military air base. Now it again is a Polish town. The airport has been completely modernized and has scheduled weekly international flights to Spain.\n\nAs we wound our way eastward to Stettin, where we stayed overnight, I recalled we had been herded into barns at night to sleep and were now passing the very ones in which we had stayed.\n\nHamerstein is no longer on the map. It is now a town called \"Czarne.\"\n\nReverend Williams in Czarne, formerly Hamerstein\n\nWe inquired at Town Hall, and one of the employees graciously drove us to the campsite. Like Marlag, it had been leveled and planted to trees. Because thousands of Russian soldiers had been imprisoned there too and had perished through disease and neglect, during the Russian occupation the mass graves had been dug up and the bodies reburied with markers.\n\nIn a small park there is a tall memorial marker and as far as the eye can see there are the grave markers with the hammer and sickle emblem. The town has a public relations booklet which contains a short history of Stalag 2B and a picture of the memorial park.\n\nCredit: MOs810 / CC BY-SA (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0)\n\nOkonecczyzna (Stalag IIB Hammerstein) marker in Czarne Memorial Park,\n\nCzarne Memorial Park, plaque at base of monument\n\nCzarne Memorial Park, with Hammer and Sickle gravemarkers\n\nSTALAG 344/8B LAMSDORF, OBERSILESIA: Before going to Stalag 8B, Bill and I took a side trip to Gdansk. I was there on a preaching mission out of 2B in Jan. 1945 when the Russian army broke through on the eastern front. Because of the Russian advance, the entire civilian population was evacuated. I was on the last train to leave the city on my way back to 2B.\n\nAfter spending the night in Gdansk, Bill and I headed south to Lamsdorf, now Lambinowisce, the site of Stalag 8B. The Lamsdorf camp complex was created during the Franco-Prussian war and operated during the First and Second World Wars. Soldiers from all the armies fighting Germany were imprisoned there. During WWII, around 300,000 prisoners of 50 nationalities passed through Lamsdorf. It is now an elaborate POW museum similar to our Andersonville.\n\nCredit: Julo / Public domain\n\nCentral Prisoner of War Museum (Centralne Muzeum JeÅcÃ³w Wojennych)\n\nNearby there is a huge public park where thousands of Russians had been housed, and where they died by the thousands. In the midst of the park there is a huge monument commemorating all the prisoners of all the wars. The site where the British (4,000) and the Americans (2) were held is now a Polish army artillery range and not accessible to the public.\n\nThe staff at the museum was glad to see me as the first confirmation that there had been any Americans there at all. I was there for ten months from May 1943 to January 1944, where I did 5 days solitary on bread and water for having escaped originally. The museum has publications and videos and a website well worth visiting. www.cmjw.pl/en/lambinowicki-rocznik-muzealny\n\nBefore returning home, Bill and I spent two nights and a day seeing the sights of Berlin.\n\nThe trip: both ways.\n\nWestbound march, on foot (1945); Eastbound stops, by car (2000).

This act ensures that a veteran shall receive full military honors if the veteran (1) is first interred or inurned in Arlington National Cemetery, (2) was awarded the medal of honor or the prisoner-of-war medal, and (3) is not entitled to full military honors because of such veteran's grade. This was a long time coming and is just recognition for those heroes who gave so much for their country, regardless of rank.\n\nThe second allows this nation to live up to the promise that we will never forget those still missing in action. Prominent federal buildings and national war memorials will now fly the iconic POW/MIA flag alongside the American flag throughout the year thanks to legislation signed into law in November. The proposal, passed without objection in the House and the Senate earlier in 2019, is designed to help highlight the continued sacrifice of military families whose loved ones are still unaccounted for overseas, estimated at about 82,000 individuals.\n\nAnd importantly for the surviving partners of our veteran heroes: The National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2020 completely eliminates the Widow's Tax after three years. No changes will take place in calendar year 2020. In 2021, one-third of the SBP will be restored. In 2022, two-thirds will be restored. On January 1, 2023, the SBP will be completely restored and surviving spouses will receive their SBP and DIC payments in full. Again, this was a long time coming and will positively affect nearly 65,000 surviving military spouses.\n\nThank you for your efforts.\n\nUnfortunately, an equally important initiative has been overlooked by Congress for nearly three decades. The flat rate Dependency and Indemnity Compensation has not been increased since 1993.Compared to other Federal survivor programs, DIC lags behind almost 12%. The current DIC flat rate is 43% of the compensation of a fully disabled single veteran. Other Federal survivor programs provide a survivor annuity of 50-55% of retirement pay to the surviving spouse. We propose a 12% increase once or a \"Sunset Provision\" of 3% each for 10 years for DIC to become equitable with other Federal survivor programs.\n\nIn 2020, DIC is $1,340.14 a month, or about $16,082 per year. Pretty close to the poverty level for our most fragile citizens.\n\nWe receive calls from widows who, because DIC is so low, they must abandon the homes where they lived with their veteran spouse. We get calls from our surviving spouse members who want to \"cancel the magazine. I can't afford to pay for it.\" When we tell them that the magazine is paid for by their life membership dues, they are grateful. For most, the magazine is their only connection to the Ex-POW experience. We also get calls from the children of ex-POWs. They want to know what benefits are available over the stipend they get through DIC. Their mothers are nearly destitute. That is not fair to all veterans and certainly not fair to widows of EXPOWs.\n\nBelow is a letter received as this testimony was being written: Dear Cheryl (CEO Cheryl Cerbone)\n\nAs a dependent of a former Ex-POW, I am reaching out to you after reading your most recent letter in the bulletin.\n\nMy mother, Theresa Hoffmann, is a widow and soon to be 98 years old. My dad, Edward I Hoffmann was a POW for 42 months during WW II. He was with the 59th Coast Artillery and captured on Corregidor. Dad passed away in February 1998 from malignant tumor behind his eye. He was 100% disabled Veteran.\n\nI moved my mom to Scottsdale, AZ from Omaha, NE four years ago when she could no longer care for herself. Here in Phoenix we have \"assisted care homes\" which are much more affordable than those larger care facilities. Mom ran out of her Long Term Care Insurance in 2018. At that time I had to negotiate with the owner of the care home a cost that mom could afford which then I had to move her into a shared room. Mom had some money in her savings which I have been supplementing to cover her room, board & care.\n\nIn August, I had to find a different assisted care home because the owners decided to build a bigger brand new home on the same site. The cost was going from $3,600/month to $5,500/month, so I no choice but to find another care home that would care for her at $3,600/month.\n\nMom is bedridden and although she is somewhat mentally aware, her body has given up on her. Fortunately, the new care home is just around the corner from where my husband and I live. My brother also lives with us who has multiple myeloma and we transport him to doctor appointments and kidney dialysis 3x a week. I walk over daily to help feed mom dinner.\n\nCurrently, I am supplementing mom's monthly care from her remaining savings of $8,900. Her current DIC is $1,956.00; SS is $1,180 and she has a small pension of $285.00/month which = 3,421.00/month. The difference is $179.00 a month. She will run out of her savings in 49 months. Upon her death, I will most likely need most of that savings to transport her body back to Omaha to be buried with my dad at the cemetery where he is placed. No cremation as she wishes.\n\nMy plea is an increase in her DIC for $179.00 a month more for her. I had to move her from Omaha to one assisted living home and three different rooms negotiating costs. Then negotiating again with another assisted care home because she doesn't have the funds for the care she needs this time in her life. This shouldn't be the scenario for a widower of a former POW.\n\nMy parents were very involved and volunteered their time at the VA hospital as well as organized the POW Chapter in Omaha. Mom was adjunct secretary of the POW Chapter as well as chairperson for many, many years. Both are life time members.\n\nIn hopes of Congress listening at your March testimony, perhaps this letter will help. All she needs is $179.00 a month to continue her care. If this plea should fall on someone else's ears, please let me know. I'm afraid Congress couldn't care less as they are more involved with impeachment hearings than a 97 year old widow of a former POW and disabled veteran.\n\nThank you for taking the time to hear me out and for all that you do for our Ex-POW's. Sincerely,\n\nMary (Hoffmann) Rumer\n\nDo your mothers have to live like this? Could your mothers live on this? don't think so.\n\nThere are two bills currently before this Congress: HR3221 with 14 cosponsors and S1047 with just 4 cosponsors. Both of these bills were referred to YOUR committees in April 2019. One year ago, with no action except shuffling to subcommittees. You owe it to these most vulnerable of our citizens to do more and do it now. We should not and can not be a nation who abandons the surviving spouse of its veterans.\n\nAnd along this line, did you know that in order to be eligible for DIC, the veteran must have been rated as 100% totally disabled for a period of 10 years? Many years ago, this requirement was changed for ex-POWS to 1 year, but the vast majority of the 778,000 who currently are rated at 100% still had to meet that 10-year requirement. It takes years — sometimes decades — to increase disability ratings to 100%. And by that time, the veteran is usually in poor health overall. We want this Congress to look at reducing the period from 10 years to 1 year for ALL veterans.\n\nThere are other concerns we have as well. In 1981, Congress passed Public Law 97-37 entitled \"Former Prisoners of War Benefit Act.\" This law accomplished several things. It established an Advisory Committee on Former Prisoners of War and mandated medical and dental care.\n\nAs Past Chairman of the Advisory Committee, I am concerned that the FACA (Federal Advisory Committee Act) term limits has resulted in the VA Advisory Committee on Former POWs being populated by well-meaning people with no real understanding of or passion for former POWs. That, coupled with the virtual lack of attention from the last several VA Secretaries, has relegated this Committee to the back burner of VA attention back burner of VA attention by moving it from the Secretary's office and placed several levels down under the Veterans Benefit Administration. That placement has made it easy to ignore and its recommendations easy to lose. Some of the unresolved issues when I timed out as Chairman.\n\nthe failure, inability, or unwillingness of the VA to coordinate its list of \"former POWs\" with the DoD list, with many more names on the VA list than is justified\n\nthe poor outreach efforts of the VA to find and include known (by DoD) POWs into the VA disability and healthcare system\n\nthe failure of the VA to insure the initial and ongoing training of a medical team (to include MD, PA, NP, RN, social worker) to treat and care for former POWs in each and every VAMC\n\nthe failure of accountability of the VA for APPROVED VAPOW Committee recommendations made over the course of the last 25-30 years.\n\nEvery committee member with long experience and strong connection to the former POW community has been removed from the Committee, along with their corporate knowledge. I never received any report from the VA about the approved recommendations and where they stood in current practice and enforcement. In our opinion, the Committee should be exempt from term limits and its membership should be limited to former POWs, their spouses or children, members of the Pensacola Mitchell Center team, and a certified VA POW doctor.\n\nWe strongly recommend that Congress pass legislation (possibly titled the John S. McCain Disability Act) to declare all former POWs, as verified by the DoD, to be rated by the VA at 100% disabled from the point at which the legislation is enacted, without further protocol exams. This is totally consistent with the POW list of presumptives passed by Congress over 30 years ago.\n\nFor the veteran population as a whole, I would also ask for assistance.\n\nDecades ago, Congress looked to increase the disability compensation percentages for World War I veterans as they became aged. It is time to again look at this for veterans of WWII, Korea, and Vietnam. All veterans rated at more than 50% disability would automatically be rated at 100%. This Congress is young for the most part. There are only two members of this Committee older than I am; only four members who are my age. The average age of the World War II veteran is 97. Korean War veterans are 88 and Vietnam veterans are well past retirement age at 73. From nearly 25 million who served during these three conflicts, fewer than 3 million are still alive. We need to look closer at \"caring for those who have borne the battle.\"\n\nAdditionally, the \"veterans means test\" for access to health care must be eliminated. Should a veteran who worked two or three jobs to provide better for his family later be deprived of healthcare? Each has served his country and earned the same benefits so let us not deprive any deserving veteran of healthcare.\n\nIt is most insulting to us when we hear the use of the word entitlements regarding any benefits to the veteran. These are all earned benefits where the veteran has served and sacrificed. Calling them \"entitlements\" relegates the program to a handout and needs to be eliminated from the language used for veterans.\n\nDuring wartime, there have been civilian POWs held in enemy prison camps, often side by side with our military prisoners of war. In WWII, wives and children were also held with their husbands and fathers. The parents were often individuals working on government contracts building facilities for the military which lead to their capture. To date, they do not receive any compensation nor health benefits other than dental resulting from their imprisonment. Over time, the numbers of these individuals has reduced dramatically yet, there is time to do the right thing and include them within the VA healthcare system. This is deserving treatment for those civilians imprisoned because they were supporting our military operations. It has been decades since a bill has been introduced to correct this long overdue injustice. We ask that you take action in this Congress.\n\nWe are a small organization. Since our founding on April 14, 1942 after the Fall of Bataan, we have worked to bring attention to and support for Ex-Prisoners of War. At the height of our membership, we had 33,000; today it is less than 9,000. In fewer years than we would like, our concerns will not be heard: our needs will not merit attention by Congress.\n\nLooking toward that future, The American Ex-Prisoners of War chose Andersonville National Historic Site and the National POW Museum at Andersonville, Georgia as our legacy. We have been intimately involved with the creation of the museum since the 1980s and are the lead organization in providing assistance—both financial and physical—to that site. In 1994, we lobbied Congress to legislation authorizing the US Mint to create a commemorative silver dollar. The proceeds went to construction of the National POW Museum, with an endowment for future maintenance. The museum is one of the largest in the National Parks system. Along with the National POW/MIA Memorial at Riverside, California, we feel secure that the sacrifices made by American prisoners of war will never be forgotten. And we thank past Congresses' actions in designating these as national sites, assuring they will serve unique positions in history honoring our heroes.\n\nAdditionally, we strongly support the efforts of Honor-Release-Return and The Ride Home, but challenge you to increase results. Since the early days of the 20th Century (WW I) the United States has left more than 100,000 Military personnel either in the hands of our enemy or unaccounted for on the field of battle. Despite the well-publicized/ verbalized policy \"Leave No Man Behind,\" we have only accounted for approximately 10,000 of those over the last eight decades. Honor-Release-Return is committed to bringing the accounting of the remaining Missing in Action to a close. The Ride Home, Inc. pays tribute to Former American POWS and the families of those Americans still Missing in Action. National POW/MIA Recognition Day, the third Friday in September, reminds us of the sacrifices our soldiers and their families make for our country every day and our responsibility to let them all know that WE WILL NOT FORGET. Combined conflict totals in the last century equal more than 120,000 prisoners of war repatriated and more than 83,000 still listed as MISSING IN ACTION.\n\nEfforts in North Korea have stalled; the last unilateral turnover of remains was in 2018. There were 10 recovery missions in Southeast Asia in 2019, 4 in Vietnam, 5 in Laos, 1 in Cambodia, but the work is slow and time is running short. It has been 45 years since hostilities ceased.\n\nThe vast majority of those missing from World War II may never be recovered. And we don't even pursue World War I.\n\nWe can and must do better. You must make it so.\n\nWe also work closely with the P.O.W Network. The P.O.W. Network was originally formed 30 years ago as an educational group to maintain the focus on the POW/MIA issue. Over the years, maintaining the almost 4000 biographies of those prisoners or missing during Vietnam has taken a backseat to answering daily questions on false claims of heroism or POW captivity. The mission now is to see that those recording history will be held accountable. Facts, not cover-up or fairy tales must be the most important basis for these historical efforts, be it POW/MIA or veterans military claims. According to The New York Times, the Department of Veterans Affairs paid disability benefits to more than six hundred people falsely claiming to have been POWs in the Vietnam and Persian Gulf wars. The number of stolen valor cases reported to the FBI has tripled in the last decade. In fact, more imposters lie about earning high military declarations for battlefield bravery than the actual number of real-life hero recipients. These imposters trade on tales and the trappings of military valor to secure privileges such as career advancements and even unearned veterans' benefits.\n\nThis is unacceptable on virtually every level. Before awarding benefits to anyone claiming to be recipients of military medals, particularly Medal of Honor, Purple Heart, or Prisoner of War, the VA must check first with the Department of Defense for verification of such claims. Only after verification shall benefits be granted.\n\nSeveral pieces of new legislation are important and continually improving all facets of the Veterans Administration operation is necessary. We often speak at this hearing about how the VA needs to improve and model its methods about particular successful and efficient industries. We need to get to where we use the term operational excellence and VA in the same sentence. For an organization that large it takes time, but we need to focus on select areas to build some successes to point at. As an attachment to this statement, I am including the latest VA Pocket Guide. I don't know how many of the members of this committee have seen or read it. Please take a few minutes and imagine the people who depend on both the VA system and you.\n\nThank you for your time and attention in support of ex-POWs and all veterans—deserving heroes every one."
