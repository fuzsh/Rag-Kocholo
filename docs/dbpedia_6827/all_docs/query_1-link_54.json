        "text": "The Purple Heart Medal is our country's oldest military decoration. It was originally designated as the Badge of Military Merit and established by General George Washington from his headquarters at Newburgh, New York, on August 7, 1782. So far as the known surviving records show, this honor badge was granted to only three men, all of them noncommissioned officers.\n\nFollowing the Revolution, the Order of the Purple Heart fell into disuse and no further awards were made. It was revived by President Herbert Hoover on the 200th Anniversary of George Washingtonâ€™s birth on 22 February 1932 out of respect to his memory and military achieve-ments. The Purple Heart is awarded to members of the Armed Forces of the United States who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands of the enemy and posthumously to the next of kin in the name of those who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action. It is specifically a combat decoration. At this time it has been awarded to over 1.8 million Americans."
