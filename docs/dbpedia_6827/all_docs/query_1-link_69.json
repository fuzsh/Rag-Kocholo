It is the nation’s oldest military medal still in use dating back to the days of the American Revolution.\n\nFormerly known as the Badge of Military Merit, it was created by General George Washington in 1782 and used to honor merit among enlisted soldiers. The award was soon forgotten after the Revolution. In 1932, the Purple Heart was revived to recognize George Washington’s principles and to celebrate the bicentennial of his birth. Nearly 2,000,000 Purple Heart medals have been awarded since World War I.\n\nWorld War II\n\nRichard J.
