        "text": "What is the Purple Heart Award?\n\nWe often think of the Purple Heart Award as a modern-day military honor. Even though it’s officially linked to General Douglas MacArthur kicking things off in 1932, the roots of this medal extend back to the Revolutionary War!\n\nThe Purple Heart Award, celebrated each year on August 7th, holds the title for the oldest awarded badge in the US Military and the 1st military honor to be awarded to lower-ranking enlisted, non-commissioned soldiers.\n\nThe Origin of the Purple Heart Award\n\nGeorge Washington awarded the 1st Purple Heart shape badge to soldiers who fought in the Continental Army.\n\nThe criteria for Washington’s award was more about valor than injury therefore it was called the “Badge of Military Merit.” Washington’s motivation behind the award was to “fire up” the troops since morale was in sharp decline in 1782 due to disease and lack of supplies.\n\nOnly 3 soldiers were awarded the Badge of Military Merit, a hand-sewn simple purple cloth heart to be worn over the soldier’s left breast.\n\nThis non-descript no frills award may explain why it was forgotten for 150 years!\n\nResurgence of the Purple Heart Award in the 1930s\n\nSo in 1930, with the appointment of General MacArthur, came an announcement to revive the Washington merit badge to align with the bicentennial celebration of Washington’s birth.\n\nTwo years later on February 22, 1932, the Army announced the “Purple Heart” established by General Washington in 1782, would be “awarded to persons, who while serving in the Army of the United States, perform any singularly meritorious act of extraordinary fidelity or essential service.” In addition to extraordinary service, the award included those who were wounded in action as well… but it had to be a serious wound!\n\nThe other branches of the Armed Services need not apply, because only Army soldiers were eligible for the award!\n\nIn addition to snubbing the Navy and Air Force, MacArthur announced like Washington’s Badge of Merit, the Purple Heart, was “not intended to commemorate the dead, but to inspire the living.”\n\nOriginally, no posthumous acts of bravery were awarded.\n\nThe Evolution into Two Seperate Awards\n\nThe Army did have some serious catching up to do. From 1932 to 1941, they awarded a whopping 78,000 Purple Hearts to living veterans and active duty soldiers from World War 1, the Civil War, the Indian Wars, and the Spanish-American War.\n\nEligibility of the award continued to evolve.\n\nAfter the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the US involvement in WWII, the Army decided to reevaluate the Purple Heart criteria.\n\nIn the end, in 1942, the War Department established 2 different awards.\n\nThe Legion of Merit honored those who demonstrated extraordinary bravery and the Purple Heart became exclusively an award for those “wounded or killed in action.”\n\nA Bittersweet Honor for True Heroes\n\nIt is a sad reality that many families are touched by this award. “Winning” it – and I say that loosely, is not a goal when a young man or women raised their right hand for service. It is an award every soldier and sailor would prefer not to own. It is a symbol of sacrifice , and it is a heavy one at that.\n\nI reached out to several friends I knew who had family members who received this award. There was a dad who survived and a nephew who tragically died. But neither were up for talking about it. Just too darn painful.\n\nFor the dad, war memories were not exactly a place he wanted to visit. And the aunt was still feeling the sting of her nephew not making it back home. Despite the fact these recipients are the very definition of heroes, some wounds are just too raw to open up about.\n\nOur company mission of “Protecting Those Who Protect Us” really hits home when I think about the sacrifice these Purple Heart recipients have made. Since 1932, over 1.8 million American men and women have been awarded the Purple Heart. These heroes who have been wounded or given their lives in service embody the very essence of protection."
