        "text": "The Texas Veterans Land Board salutes all those Veterans and Active Duty Military Members who have earned the right to wear a Purple Heart medal. This is the oldest medal to still be awarded to those who are injured or killed in service to the country.\n\nGeneral George Washington created the original Purple Heart medal, known as the Medal of Military Merit, shortly before the end of the American Revolution on August 7, 1782. Only three men received this award before it fell into disuse. However, it was purple cloth cut into a heart shape, which is where the term “Purple Heart” originated.\n\nIn World War I, the award was resurrected to honor Doughboys returning from the war, and some who never came home. It was a heart-shaped medal with a bust of Washington on a purple field, suspended from a purple ribbon, the same design that is used today.\n\nOver 1.8 million Purple Hearts have been awarded since 1918. Military members can receive more than one since they can be injured multiple times in the same and different conflicts.\n\nThere are special benefits for those who have received a Purple Heart. In Texas, awardees can belong to the Military Order of the Purple Heart, can have personalized Purple Heart license plates, can receive medical priority upgrades at the Veterans Administration, and also can obtain preferential government hiring status. Recipients and their families can also benefit from the Forever GI Bill, which entitles them to 100% benefits for 36 months, making three years of college completely free. Purple Heart recipients who are disabled veterans can also qualify for property tax exemptions, based on the percentage of their disability.\n\nThe VLB offers our thanks, the gratitude of the state of Texas, and the proud heart of a nation, to our members who proudly earned a Purple Heart or had one given to them for their loved one’s greatest sacrifice. We are honored by you, and the heart of service you offer to America.\n\nThe VLB is happy to provide any needed help for these American heroes. The mission for the VLB is “to ensure that we offer the very best package of Veterans benefits in the country and those of us who work for the VLB strive to meet those goals every day. For more than 70 years, we have had the honor to serve Veterans, Military Members and their families in Texas, and we look forward to keeping that promise in the years to come.” Call 1–800–252–8387, email VLBinfo@glo.texas.gov, or visit vlb.texas.gov to see the different benefits available."
