I have personally been a fan of Mr. Webb’s for a long time.\n\nHere is a short run down of who he is: Mr. Webb graduated from the Annapolis in 1968 and accepted a commission in the USMC at the height of the Vietnam War. He deployed to Vietnam where he served a Platoon and Company commander. During his service in Vietnam, Webb was awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts.\n\nAfter leaving the Corps due to injuries sustained in combat in 1972, Webb enrolled in Georgetown Law School. By the time he graduated, he had also written the transcript for Fields of Fire, one of the definitive novels about Vietnam. Webb was instrumental in the creation of the Vietnam Memorial and was the driving force behind the statues that are part of that monument. Webb served as Secretary of the Navy under Ronald Reagan, but resigned when policies calling for reduction of the Navy were forced on his position. Webb is an accomplished warrior, author, reporter, executive, and lawyer. Additionally, Webb has championed the rights of veterans and Vietnamese refugees for decades.\n\n[quote]toddjacobs13 wrote:\n\nJames Webb has entered the race to receive the democratic nomination for the 2006 Senate race in Virginia.

Someone who has given thousands of hours pro bono on behalf of America’s veterans and those Vietnamese who fled their homeland after the Communist takeover in 1975. Indeed, imagine a Senator who writes his own books.”\n\nI love him already!\n\nJames Webb is a hero, the Navy Cross is second only to the Medal of Honor for the Marines. Read The Nightingale’s song if you have any interest in Vietnam, it’s the story of Webb, McCain, John Poindexter, Budd McFarlane, and Oliver North, all Annapolis grads in the mid '60s. Webb wrote a good article, I think the Post, a couple of weeks back, talking about how the Bush administration uses surrogates to attack the patriotism of Vietnam vets who oppose the war in Iraq. Says something about how far the Republican Party has fallen that a guy who once said “I wouldn’t cross the street to watch Jane Fonda slit her wrists” is now running as a Democrat.\n\n[quote]GDollars37 wrote:\n\nJames Webb is a hero, the Navy Cross is second only to the Medal of Honor for the Marines.

I certainly agree. I am extremely turned off by the collective actions of BOTH parties. However, there are individual politicians on both sides whom I respect and admire. James Webb certainly ranks high on my list in that respect.\n\nTodd\n\n[quote]Zap Branigan wrote:\n\nGDollars37 wrote:\n\nJames Webb is a hero, the Navy Cross is second only to the Medal of Honor for the Marines.

This one, of Veterans turning on a Republican Party led by chickenhawks like Bush and Cheney (“other priorities” during Vietnam, no wonder he can’t shoot straight) is a new one."
