        "text": "On Feb. 11, 2014, Killeen Mayor Dan Corbin read and signed a proclamation designating Killeen as a Purple Heart City. The designation was initiated from a request by the Military Order of the Purple Heart.\n\nWhat is a Purple Heart City?\n\nA Purple Heart City is a designation given to a municipality or locality in the United States that honors and recognizes the sacrifices of military personnel who have been wounded or killed in combat. The title is often accompanied by initiatives or ceremonies to commemorate Purple Heart recipients, raise awareness about their service and sacrifice, and express gratitude for their contributions to national security.\n\nWhat is the Purple Heart?\n\nThe Purple Heart is the oldest military decoration in present use and was initially created as the Badge of Military Merit by General George Washington in 1782. It was the first American service award or decoration made available to the common soldier and is specifically awarded to members of the United States Armed Forces who have been wounded or who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in combat with a declared enemy of the United States of America.\n\nThe Badge of Military Merit was a purple, heart-shaped piece of silk with the word \"Merit\" embroidered in silver. It was awarded to only three soldiers during the Revolutionary War. After the war, the award fell into disuse.\n\nIn 1932, on the 200th anniversary of George Washington's birth, General Douglas MacArthur revived the award. Renamed the Purple Heart, its design was updated to a purple heart-shaped medal with a profile of George Washington on the front and the words \"For Military Merit\" inscribed on the back.\n\nOver the years, the criteria for awarding the Purple Heart has expanded to include injuries sustained as a result of enemy actions, including those from terrorist attacks.\n\nOriginal Purple Heart City Proclamation\n\nOriginal Request For Purple Heart City Status"
