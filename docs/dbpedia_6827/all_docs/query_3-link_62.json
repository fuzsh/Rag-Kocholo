        "text": "PHOTO INFORMATION\n\nGen. Allyn presents Purple Heart\n\nSoldiers receive Purple Hearts\n\nBy Rebekah Almquist Brooke Army Medical Center Public Affairs\n\nFor injuries received in combat, Sgt. Stephen W. Jackel and Pfc. Cicely C. Holmes were honored with Purple Heart medals during a ceremony at the Warrior and Family Support Center Aug. 13.\n\nMaj. Gen. Jimmie Keenan, commander, Southern Regional Medical Command, hosted the ceremony while Gen. Daniel B. Allyn, commanding general, U.S. Army Forces Command, was the guest speaker and presented the medals.\n\nAllyn commended the Soldiers for their courageous service and said the Purple Heart is more than an honor - it is a reminder to our nation of what it means to serve.\n\n\"Everyone in our Army who has ever served knows what the Purple Heart represents,\" Allyn said. \"It represents somebody who was there when the nation called, who did their duty and sacrificed above and beyond.\"\n\nJackel was wounded while serving in Afghanistan in August 2011 as a combat engineer with Company C, 73rd Engineering Battalion, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division.\n\nHis vehicle struck an improvised explosive device while on patrol resulting in a double amputation. Jackel said with continuing help, he is improving every day.\n\n\"It is very humbling working with the guys in the Center for the Intrepid to give you that motivation to push through days that you don't think that you could,\" he said.\n\n\"It is truly a blessing to be able to come back from combat, to be able to see your family and to know that God has given you the many blessings that he has.\"\n\nHolmes was also awarded the Combat Medical Badge and Combat Action Badge during the ceremony. She was wounded in July in Afghanistan while serving as a combat medic with the 59th Engineer Company, 20th Engineer Battalion, 36th Engineer Brigade.\n\nHer vehicle encountered an IED during a route clearance mission. Holmes asked guests to direct thoughts and support to her platoon still serving in Afghanistan.\n\n\"Please pray for them to make it back safe,\" Holmes said. \"I thank my family and I thank God - it could have been worse.\"\n\nAllyn also thanked and encouraged the Soldiers' families for their support not only during these difficult times, but for the rest of their lives.\n\n\"There are a lot of us who sacrifice whenever we serve - none more than our families,\" Allyn said.\n\n\"Your commitment to these great Soldiers and their courageous service is part of what we honor here today. I commend you for standing behind your Soldier today and for all the days in the future.\"\n\nFollowing the ceremony, Allyn visited with wounded warriors at the Center for the Intrepid and San Antonio Military Medical Center.\n\nThe Purple Heart is awarded to members of the Armed Forces of the United States who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands of the enemy and posthumously to the next of kin in the name of those who are killed in action or die of wounds received in action. It is the oldest military honor in the world still in use."
