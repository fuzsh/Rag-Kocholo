The American flag must be flown in a conspicuous place. . . . 2. In the absence of the artifacts of war, the monument itself must contain a strong inscription denoting the values for which our countrymen fought and died. . . . 3.

The Commission of Fine Arts meeting at which real trouble begins.\n\nstatement by Tom Carhart: \"I don't care about artistic perceptions, I don't care about the rationalizations that abound. One needs no artistic education to see this design for what it is, a black trench that scars the Mall. Black walls, the universal color of shame and sorrow and degradation. Hidden in a hole in the ground, with no means of access for those Vietnam veterans who are condemned to spend the rest of their days in a wheelchair. Perhaps that's an appropriate design for those who would spit on us still. But can America truly mean that we should feel honored by that black pit?\" [PDF]\n\nstatement by Jan Scruggs: \"In 1979, I had a dream, that regardless of the controversy and divisivness centered around Viet Nam, the American people could come together to build a memorial to honor the sacrifices of Vietnam vets. That dream is a reality today because we meet here to select the stone for building that memorial. My final key point is that there is a lot of unfinished business left for our country because of Vietnam. This memorial is a part of that unfinished business, but it remains for the country to absorb and resolve the many difficulties that remain from Vietnam.\" [PDF]\n\n10/14/1981.

A design with pure intentions.\n\n\"Vietnam: In Memoriam,\" [Cleveland] Plain Dealer, 10/15/81: A28. \"The intent can only be to honor the dead, who gave their country the ultimate gift, without unduly glorifying the conflict about which many Americans still have such painfully conflicting emotions. There is no dark, hidden motive, no conspiracy to humiliate.

Such memorials gather moss in every village square from Mobile to Manchester. Washington is full of suitable sculptures, and with perhaps half a dozen exceptions they are dreadful -- pedestrian examples of the stonecarver's skill.

I believe that the design selected for the memorial in an open competition is pointedly insulting to the sacrifices made for their country by all Vietnam veterans. By this will we be remembered: a black gash of shame and sorrow, hacked into the national visage that is the Mall. . . . The proposed design is defended on artistic grounds, but the issue is not one of art: if Americans allow that black trench to be dug, future generations will understand clearly what America thought of its Vietnam veterans. . . . Black walls, the universal color of sorrow and dishonor. Hidden in a hole, as if in shame. Is this really how America would memorialize our offering?\" [FullText]\n\n10/26/1981. \"Reexamining the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Project,\" by Francis M. Watson.\n\n\"By whatever mechanism, and through whoever's influence, the site chosen for the Vietnam memorial is that of the massive rallies against the war, the specifications for the design of the memorial were antiwar in nature, and the jury which made the selection of the winning design was weighted with men possessing antiwar sentiments, or actually involved with the movement -- including one with long-standing connections with the Communist Party which, of course, had its hands in the antiwar movement whenever and wherever it could. . . .

A neutral and soft-spoken monument.\n\n\"Memories That Shape Our Futures,\" by William Greider, Washington Post, 11/08/81: C1-2. \"When one thinks of what might authentically capture the national feeling about Vietnam, there is no clear and obvious answer, none that would not restart the old arguments. Thus, the memorial committee rightly chose a neutral and soft-spoken monument, one which will give each visitor enormous freedom to ruminate on private memories. Only revisionist fools still insist that Vietnam was Gettysburg or the Ardennes; if the government built such a statue, it would be worse than amnesia.\" [FullText]\n\n\"Viet Vets: Doing It Ourselves,\" by William Vogt, Washington Post, 11/08/81, C1. \"It is past time to educate the American public to the fact that we [veterans] made great personal sacrifices in good faith by serving in Vietnam, and that the tempering our ordeal imparted has not destroyed us, but left us stronger.\" [FullText]\n\n11/9/1981.

Kilpatrick, Washington Post, 11/11/81: A27. \"The injustice suffered by Vietnam veterans can never be remedied. Those who served in Vietnam did not start the war; it was not their failure that led to the miserable ending. They lived up to the code: duty, honor, country. No belated apology will erase the contumely the survivors experienced. But at least we are now well along in providing deserved tribute to those who did not survive. . . . this will be the most moving war memorial ever erected.\" [FullText]\n\n\"Honoring Veterans of War, and Anti-War,\" letter to the editor, New York Times, 11/11/81: A30. \"The memorial will not be the black hole that Mr. Carhart describes, but rather a subtle yet powerful statement honoring the memory of those who were lost and recognizing the sacrifices of all who served in a war in which there was neither victor nor vanquished.\" [FullText]\n\n\"How to Remember Vietnam,\" New York Times, 11/11/81: A30. \"The impetus for a memorial springs not from contemporary pride but from later guilt about the men and women who served. Were they heroes or victims? . . . . The nation remains in deep conflict about the war. But with time, all Americans have joined at least in a sense of pain for those who died. A memorial that emphasizes the names without offering any conclusion about the war reflects the truth about how the nation remembers Vietnam. Critics of the memorial would like something more assertive -- a Vietnam version of marines raising the flag at Iwo Jima, perhaps. That would create a shallow monument to politics.

Even if this black gash is not a statement of dishonor and shame, it is clearly at least a statement of sorrow. . . . I am a combat Vietnam veteran with two Purple Hearts and I feel no sorrow. I regret the deaths of brothers in arms, but they died noble, principled deaths, and I salute them and honor them.\" [FullText]\n\n11/16/1981.

Letter to James Watt, Secretary of the Interior, by several members of the House of Representatives.\n\n\"The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund (VVMF) seems to have somewhat twisted things. . . . The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund sought and selected a design that would be built as a memorial to the dead. . . . How did such an obvious variation on the intentions of Congress occur? . . . Clearly, this is not what Congress intended when it authorized a memorial 'in honor and recognition of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States who served in the Vietnam war.'

He withdrew from VVMF as a volunteer specifically to enter and never expressed objection to the composition of the jury prior to his decision.\" 2) \"As someone who spent 14 months in Vietnam, I find the proposed design for the memorial personally repugnant. To me, it represents the black gash that ripped our country apart in dissent and the black memories of what I saw over there waiting for me to close my eyes so they can come back to haunt me. . . . I will never go to see it.\" 3) \"As one intended to memorialize Americans fallen or lost in Vietnam, I seriously question the honor the design is supposed to render.\" 4) \"The cruelest joke yet.

Sir, we know the risks. In all competitions, few can be chosen, and many are the losers. Not all who lose can do so with grace. Not all winning designs can please everyone.
