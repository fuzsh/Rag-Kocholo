        "text": "The Purple Heart Medal (PH) is a decoration presented in the name of the President of the United States to recognize members of the U.S. military who have been wounded or killed in battle. It differs from other military decorations in that a \"recommendation\" from a superior is not required, but rather individuals are entitled based on meeting certain criteria found in AR 600-8-22. This criteria was expanded on March 28, 1973 to include injuries received as a result of an international terrorist attack against the U.S. and while serving outside the territory of the U.S. as part of a peacekeeping force. Personnel wounded or killed by friendly fire are also eligible for this award as long as the injuries were received in combat and with the intention of inflicting harm on the opposing forces. The Purple Heart is not awarded for non-combat injuries and commanders must take into account the extent of enemy involvement in the wound."
