        "text": "National Purple Heart Day is celebrated annually on August 7 to honor U.S. service members who were wounded or killed as a result of enemy action while serving in the military. The Purple Heart is the oldest active military medal in the United States, with more than 1.8 million medals awarded to men and women who sacrificed for our nation.\n\nOn Aug. 7, 1782, George Washington established the award, originally called the Badge of Military Merit, to commend soldiers who secured victories in battle. Continental Army soldiers William Brown and Elijah Churchill were the first to receive the Badge of Military Merit.\n\nThe Badge of Military Merit, one of the first military awards presented to enlisted soldiers and non-commissioned officers, was reinstated in 1932 on Washington’s 200th birthday as the Purple Heart Medal and continues to be awarded to qualifying service members today.\n\nPurple Heart Day was established in 2014 to honor and recognize those awarded the decoration. The heart-shaped badge is purple because the color represents courage and bravery.\n\nIn honor of Purple Heart Day, HFOT would like to recognize the military members who bravely sacrificed for our nation."
