His father was a career Army man, and Adkins enlisted at Fort Oglethorpe’s Civilian Cadet Training Camp in 1936. This camp trained him for the cavalry, and while he was determined to fly, his training aided his development as a soldier. Adkins joined the Army Air Corps in 1940 and became a rear turret gunner on B-18 bombers. He then learned to work on B-17s as “floating crew,” filling in where needed. He operated the gun turrets aboard the Memphis Belle for several missions until he was injured in the line of duty. He later reenlisted in the Air Force and flew as a crew chief during the Korean War.\n\nRichard T.
