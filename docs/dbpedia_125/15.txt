Objectives

To celebrate the 50th Anniversary of Hip Hop in August of 2023, Call of Duty partnered with the Queen, Nicki Minaj, the legendary Snoop Dogg, and icon 21 Savage – who lent his persona to the Call of Duty universe through a playable Operator bundle.

As the launch of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III approached later in the year, the world needed more 21 Savage x Call of Duty, and we needed to show the world just how good the game looks.

If you have one of the world’s biggest rappers in your offices, you have to record a banger.

So we worked with Call of Duty to create a bespoke in-game music video to launch 21 Savage’s new MWIII-themed track “Call Me Revenge” and help drive mass awareness around the upcoming launch.

Strategy and Execution

We did what we do best: played Call of Duty. Only half kidding there.

With 21 Savage’s “Operator”, experimental editing, and visual effects, we produced a fully in-game music video that captured the essence of the track. The video showcases the rapper making his way across iconic Call of Duty locations, dispatching enemies with his unique Weapon skins, and all around looking like a complete badass. At the same time, with highly stylized shots of gameplay, we were able to shine the spotlight on the impressive visuals that are a trademark of the Call of Duty franchise.

Once we were done bobbing our heads to the video about 1,000 times, fans reacted in kind.

Results

A quick visit to 21 Savage’s YouTube upload of the music video is all you need to see the community reaction to our work. The sheer surprise of the collab, as well as the uniqueness of using all in-game captured visuals, boosted the music video well past expectations, cemented 21 Savage as a legendary Call of Duty operator, and gave players and fans a chance to see what MWIII is made of.
