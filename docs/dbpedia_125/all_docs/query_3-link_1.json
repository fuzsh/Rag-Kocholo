        "text": "Directed by John Francis Dillon\n\nBow hijacks this pulpiest of all Pre-Code sagas as a hot-headed Texas heiress whose fortunes fall and rise as she confronts perversion, prostitution, venereal disease and other social ills while finding time to brawl in a Greenwich Village gay bar.\n\nFox Film Corp. Screenwriter: Edwin Burke Cinematographer: Lee Garmes. Editor: Harold Schuster. Cast: Clara Bow, Gilbert Roland, Thelma Todd, Monroe Owsley, Estelle Taylor.\n\n35mm, b/w, 88 min.\n\nDirected by Frank Lloyd\n\nA racy Pre-Code tale of love, revenge, and redemption on the carnival midway, Clara Bow’s final role, at age 28, showcases her comedic snap and dramatic talents as well as her physical allure. As a circus dancer who takes a wager to seduce the show manager’s son, only to find herself falling for him, Bow’s portrayal is a winning swan song.\n\nFox Film Corp. Producer: Al Rockett. Screenwriter: Bradley King, Joseph Moncure March. Cinematographer: Ernest Palmer. Editor: Margaret Clancy. Cast: Clara Bow, Preston Foster, Richard Cromwell, Herbert Mundin, James Gleason.\n\n35mm, b/w, 80 min."
