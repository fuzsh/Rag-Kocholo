        "text": "By Crystal McGough, Associate Editor\n\nTRUSSVILLE – ACTA Theatre opened performances of their latest play, John Patrick’s “The Curious Savage,” last weekend, with performances at 7 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, and 2:30 p.m. on Sunday. For anyone who missed opening weekend, it’s not too late to see the show as there are still three more performances this weekend. This is one show you do not want to miss.\n\nWith a perfectly chosen case, and directed by Angie McGowan, “The Curious Savage” brought its opening-night audience to both laughter and tears.\n\nThis play tells the comedic and yet heartwarming story of Mrs. Savage, a widow who inherits $10 million dollars, but is declared insane and put into a group home by her greedy and self-centered stepchildren after she uses the money to start a memorial fund in honor of her late husband.\n\nWhile her formal name for the fund is the “Jonathan Savage Memorial Fund,” her personal name for it is “The Happiness Fund,” because she uses the money to make people’s dreams come true, no matter how silly the dreams may seem.\n\nIn Mrs. Savage’s words, “There are plenty of charities for foolish people in desperate need, and none for people with a desperate need to be foolish.”\n\nThroughout the play, theater-goers get to be metaphorical flies on the walls as they observe the beautiful relationships Mrs. Savage forms with the residents and staff of The Cloisters Sanatorium, who ultimately come to her aid in the conflict with her stepchildren.\n\nHow this story unfolds, however, is a secret only to be revealed by purchasing a ticket and filling a seat at one of the remaining shows.\n\nThis weekend’s show times are:\n\nFriday, Feb. 17 – 7 p.m.\n\nSaturday, Feb. 18 – 7 p.m.\n\nSunday, Feb. 19 – 2:30 p.m."
