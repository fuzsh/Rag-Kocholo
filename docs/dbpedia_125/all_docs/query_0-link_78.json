Morshed coerced non-residents to register to vote and submit absentee ballots using forms that Morshed had filled out for the June 2019 Democratic primary election, which Morshed won (and then went on to win in the November 2019 general election). When a resident of Galloway questioned the legality of signing the absentee ballot request, Morshed presented other absentee ballot request forms he was submitting and offered the individual a job in the Atlantic City government if Morshed was elected. After submitting the absentee ballot, Morshed instructed the individual to change his voter registration back to Galloway. When the individual was contacted by law enforcement, Morshed told him to lie and say that he lived part-time in Atlantic City and that Morshed had not filled out the forms. Morshed also lied to the FBI claiming he never provided anyone with voter registration or absentee ballot request documents, helped fill them out, or collected any documents from prospective voters. Three other individuals were solicited by Morshed to falsely register and submit an absentee ballot; two of the ballots were accepted and one ballot was rejected. He pleaded guilty to one count of fraudulent procurement and submission of voter registration applications in exchange for dismissal of the other charges and is awaiting sentencing.\n\nSource: herit.ag/3WuiA76 , herit.ag/3Y8mW4T , herit.ag/3LrEfWT , herit.ag/4f8wenC , herit.ag/3zM6mOa , herit.ag/4d7P3VV\n\nStateTexasYear2024NameHarris County 180th District Court…Case TypeJudicial FindingFraud TypeFalse Registrations, Fraudulent Use Of Absentee Ballots\n\nThe result of the 180th district court judicial election was overturned in Harris County, Texas, after a state judge concluded that over 1,400 illegal votes had been counted. The margin of victory was only 449 votes in an election in which over one million votes were cast. However, the judge found clear and convincing evidence that 983 votes were cast by individuals who did not actually reside in Harris County, did not correctly list their residence, or listed non-residential addresses such as post offices as their residence on their voter registration; 40 absentee ballots lacked the required signatures and 8 ballots were not mailed in a timely manner; 445 voters did not provide proper identification or substitute documentation to prove their identity; 5 provisional ballots lacked a signature and one lacked a photo ID or an acceptable substitute. In total, the court ruled that 1,482 illegal votes were cast in the election, far outweighing the 449-vote margin between the two candidates. The court ordered a new election.\n\nSource: herit.ag/3Y4e2VV\n\nStateWisconsinYear2024NameKimberly ZapataCase TypeCriminal ConvictionFraud TypeFraudulent Use Of Absentee Ballots\n\nKimberly Zapata, the former Milwaukee Election Commission Deputy Director, was charged by the state with one felony count of misconduct in public office and 3 misdemeanor counts of absentee ballot fraud after requesting military absentee ballots under false names and sending them to a Wisconsin state legislator's home during the 2022 election.

She used Wisconsin's online voter registration website to request the military absentee ballots and had them sent to the home of Rep. Janel Brandtien (R-Menomoneee Falls). Upon receiving the ballots, Brandtien contacted authorities and the media, and Zapata was fired from her position on the Milwaukee Election Commission.

He was hired by a Democrat candidate to gather 1,000 ballot petition signatures to be eligible to run in the 2017 New Haven Probate Judge primary election. Cuevas and his co-conspirators fraudulently obtained ballot petition signatures by forging signatures of registered voters as well as forging the name and signature of a petition circulator to falsely authenticate voter signatures. When Cuevas and his co-conspirators were under investigation by the state election board for their forgery, Cuevas pressured the person whose signature he falsified as a circulator to sign a false affidavit. He pleaded guilty to the felony charge and was sentenced to 8 months in prison, 3 years of supervised probation, and ordered to pay $5,750 in restitution as well as a $100 special assessment.\n\nSource: herit.ag/4falG7e , herit.ag/3y2wtQk , herit.ag/3Yevg2S , herit.ag/4676Fis\n\nStateConnecticutYear2023NameBridgeport Municipal Mayoral Democratic…Case TypeJudicial FindingFraud TypeFraudulent Use Of Absentee Ballots\n\nThe results of the City of Bridgeport, Connecticut Democratic mayoral primary election, which was held on September 12, 2023, were overturned due to absentee ballot fraud in an election where only 251 votes separated the winner (Joseph Ganim) and the loser (John Gomes). Superior Court Judge William Clark ordered that a new primary election between Ganim (the party-endorsed candidate) and Gomes (the challenger) should be held because an unusually large number of absentee ballots that were counted had been illegally placed in drop boxes by two unauthorized ballot distributors who were Ganim supporters: Wanda Geter-Pataky (a Democratic Town Committee member and the Leader of Voting District 136) and Eneida Martinez (a candidate for City Council). The court determined that videos of Geter-Pataky and Martinez illegally dropping off stacks of votes into various drop boxes “provided evidence of ballot harvesting, in violation of state law.” Geter-Pataky made 10 drops either directly or indirectly, and Martinez made 5 separate drops of multiple ballots. The court also found “the volume of ballots mishandled is such it calls the result of the primary election in serious doubt and unable to determine the legitimate result of the primary.”\n\nSource: herit.ag/3TBYUNy\n\nStateDistrict of ColumbiaYear2023NameVanessa RubioCase TypeOfficial FindingFraud TypeDuplicate Voting\n\nVanessa Rubio (a D.C.
