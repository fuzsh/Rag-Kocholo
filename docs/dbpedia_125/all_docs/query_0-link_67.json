        "text": "Below is a full list of our 2022 Official Selections. This list is organized in alphabetical order. First by category, then by the film title. We strongly suggest that you use the find feature on your computer by pressing Command + F (For MAC users) and Control + F (For PC users). After pressing this combination of keys enter the name you are looking for. PLEASE NOTE: AAHSFF may change a submission category if we feel a film is a better fit or has a better chance of being selected in a different category - so your film may not appear in the original category you submitted to.\n\nWhat is an Official Selection? Official Selections are films that will be screened at the 2022 All American High School Film Festival on October 22nd and 23rd, 2022 at the AMC Empire 25 Theater in Times Square, NYC. Every year we receive thousands of films submitted by student filmmakers from around the world. All of our Official Selections are the best of the best, and have been selected by our panel of industry judges. All Official Selections are eligible to be nominated for an award. All award nominees and winners will be announced at the Teen Indie Awards on Sunday October 23rd at The Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nWant to know more about festival events? Follow us on social @hsfilmfest and check out our 2022 Festival Page featuring: complete festival schedule of events, screening schedule, planning guides, FAQ and more...\n\nIf your film was selected, congratulations! Please be sure to review the information below carefully. If you see any information that is incorrect please let us know as soon as possible by emailing info@aahsff.com. August 19th is the deadline to inform us of any errors before we print our festival programs.\n\nPlan on coming to the fest to see your film? Get your tickets, find out when your film will be screening, and check out our Festival Planning Guide.\n\nIf your film was not selected, know this: We started this festival nine years ago, and every year it gets more competitive. Every year we receive more submissions that illuminate higher quality storytelling and film technique and we simply cannot screen them all. Of course, this reinforces our belief that the future of film is brighter than ever before and we know you want to be a part of it. But stay focused, not getting in is just another moment in your journey. If you really love filmmaking (and we know you do!) the best thing you can do to improve is to attend the festival and soak in all of the resources we bring together... See what other high school students are creating and where the bar is set, attend panels and workshops designed to specifically help you grow, learn what colleges and universities are looking for, explore the latest technology, and most importantly, form relationships with other young filmmakers that share your dreams and who can help you as you develop your skills. Whatever you decide, don’t give up on your passion.\n\nKeep filming.\n\nKeep following your dreams.\n\nNever Stop Creating.\n\nSee you in New York City!\n\nDocumentary\n\n“$oova” by Anthony Martinez, Jose Jimenez & Bijaan Noormohmaed, Dallas, TX\n\n“A Broken Record” by Jevon McKinney, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“A Perception of Identity” by Luke Bracco, Alamo, CA\n\n“A Piece of Ranch” by Jiayang Liu\n\n“A Second Chance” by Arden Pala, San Diego, CA\n\n“Aaron and the Train” by James Hsieh Bylinsky, Brooklyn, NY\n\n“Aging” by Alison Whiteside, Danville, CA\n\n“Alex's Saints Foundation” by Brianna Johnson, Troy, MI\n\n“Are We American?” by Ria Khehar, Alexis Applebaum & Yezy Suh, San Diego, CA\n\n“Art Saves the Soul Bowl” by Madeleine Birnbaum, Saugerties, NY\n\n“Ask a Filmmaker Maddie McBride” by Miles Krofcheck\n\n“BaoBei” by Josh Li\n\n“Behind the Masc” by Ni’Asia Ali, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Behind the Performance” by Jessica Ensel, Miramar, FL\n\n“Between Two Worlds” by Jalen Lindh, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Beyond Skin Deep” by Hanna Le\n\n“Bird Lady” by Carter Rostron\n\n“Black Prayers Matter” by Angus Ebeling, Venice, CA\n\n“Breathe” by Finian Duffard, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Bubba” by Isaac Hobbs Littleton, Argyle, TX\n\n“Bullets in Paradise” by Violet J Dempsey\n\n“Chile, Happiness is Coming” by Francisco Vera & Eva Garcia, Doral, FL\n\n“Climate Climax: Evergreens Don't Stagnate” by Romal Mitr, Dublin, CA\n\n“Corduroy” by Mia Da Silva\n\n“Counter Conformity” by Isabella Chiappini, Kimberly Blum & Lu Rodriguez, Weston, FL\n\n“COVID-19” by Chiara Annabelle Collin-D'Augelli, Larchmont, NY\n\n“Crandall's Orchards” by Isaac Leonard\n\n“DAN THE MAN” by Drew Rosania, Cinnaminson, NJ\n\n“Dear Mr. Estes” by George Breaker Traylor, Houston, TX\n\n“Delhi Days” by Eshaan Mani\n\n“Dilapidated: The Fall of Rural Iowa” by Adrian Guan, Ames, IA\n\n“Dolphin Diaries” by Dao Wang, Weston, MA\n\n“Dungeons And Quarantine” by Aiden Dean Nelson, Sacramento, CA\n\n“Endemic” by Jerry Marnell & Elias Osorio, Pebble Beach, CA\n\n“Erik Rides The Bus” by Garrett Merbach & Matthew Gawthrop, Troy, MI\n\n“Family Therapy” by Ethan Frederick, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Fighting for Environmental Justice: The Health Crisis at the US-Mexico Border” by Ilan Jinich, La Jolla, CA\n\n“Final Goodbye” by Giovannie Spampinato\n\n“Fort Visalia: The Beginning of Visalia” by Ian Cook\n\n“Four Tracks” by Kian Doughty, Portland, OR\n\n“fresh memories” by Christian Lee, Alpharetta, GA\n\n“From the Teacher’s Desk” by Millie Bramschreiber, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“GONE” by Kyle Ward, San Antonio, TX\n\n“Grandma” by Tim Toliver, Pepper Pike, OH\n\n“Happy Here” by Jacqueline Franco & Nadia Borja, Armonk, NY\n\n“Healthiest Kid Alive” by James Peng, Chestnuthill, MA\n\n“Home” by Sarah DeWitt, McKinney, TX\n\n“Home Like Mine” by Shyam S Rama, Springfield, MO\n\n“How Roundabouts Changed Urbanization Across America” by Lucca Su Mo, Alex Mu Tang & Christopher Xu, Carmel, IN\n\n“I have a dream, a movie dream” by ShiJie Weng\n\n“In the Pit” by Meg Hartung, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“In The Trenches” by Ian Denshaw, Gianna Laurita & Liz Sankey, Pittsburgh, PA\n\n“Invasive An Environmental Epidemic” by Lucas Figueroa\n\n“Isla Nena” by Maya Zeidman\n\n“It's About What You Can Do” by Emily Sedgwick, Old Greenwich, CT\n\n“Just Like Me” by Blake Backes\n\n“Kik-Me” by Karizma Rivera, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Laddoo” by Sanay Saboo, Irvine, CA\n\n“Lakeside Loves” by Liam Adrian Oseguera, Chase Campbell & Liam Phillips\n\n“Las Hijas” by Allyson Penadeniz, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Leaving Africa” by Rose Nseya, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Leaving Home” by Julien Fagel, Calabasas, CA\n\n“Legacy” by Dre Whitney, Dallas, TX\n\n“Let's Do Better” by Amanda Chen\n\n“Loading Addiction...” by Eric Hernandez, Miami, FL\n\n“Madam Mayor” by Luis Alejandro Castaneda & Michelle Alexandria Sousa\n\n“Match Point” by Sanay Saboo, Irvine, CA\n\n“Mayhem At Monrovia” by Gable Nealon\n\n“mEAT” by Chiara Annabelle Collin-D'Augelli, Larchmont, NY\n\n“Muffl’d” by Jules Navaratne, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“My Story: Diabetes” by Zaya Johnson, Pleasant Grove, UT\n\n“Ol Chap” by Reed J Farkas, Los Angeles, CA\n\n“On Pointe” by Matthew Benjamin Warter\n\n“Our Baile” by Alexa Felipe, Annajulia Quintero & Angelica Perez De Camino, Hialeah, FL\n\n“Painting Humanity” by Tyler Hom, Irvine, CA\n\n“Pelham Bit” by Angeline Yeh, San Ramon, CA\n\n“Persuasion Over Force: The Clouded Legacy of the Sunshine Policy” by Dongin Matthew Chun, Seoul, Korea\n\n“Power to the People” by Nicole Pasto & Shakuntala Balusu, Wixom, MI\n\n“Pressure” by Winson Yang\n\n“REFRAMING” by Delaney Mauve, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Ridgers Forever” by Nic Chang, Glen Ridge, NJ\n\n“Right Here, Right Now” by Taylor Saulsbury, Colorado Springs, CO\n\n“Ryan Takes New York” by Ryan Matthew Montgomery, Coppell, TX\n\n“S.O.S.
