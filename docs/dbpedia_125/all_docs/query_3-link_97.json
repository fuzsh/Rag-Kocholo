        "text": "It's me, Michelle.\n\n​\n\nI’m a writer, editor and author mentor with a penchant for amplifying good things in the world. While you’re no doubt dying to guess how old I am (a lady never tells), if I have any children (3), and if I’m married (1 at a time), you might also be wondering why I'm so obsessed about working with aspiring authors.\n\n​\n\nI have seen, first-hand, how quickly and dramatically becoming a published author transforms the lives and businesses of my clients.\n\n​\n\nFrom growing a thriving client-based business to stepping into prominent speaking opportunities, writing a book gives you the authority and visibility you need to open new doors (I’m talkin’ about big, heavy double doors!).\n\n​\n\nWarning: writing a book isn’t for weenies!\n\n​\n\nThat’s why it’s my honor and joy to mentor you, encourage you and kick your ass when the finish line feels too far away. Book writing is all about the buddy system! I meet you where you are and become your closest ally, confidant and warrior when you need it. When you write yourself into a corner and need to cut your way out, I’m there with a machete and coffee (because caffeine is my secret writing weapon).\n\n​\n\nI’ll work with you to create your online author platform and an overall strategy to leverage your current network. Together, we’ll clarify your goals, your expectations for the book and what kind of sales funnel feel most natural and fun for YOU! As a copywriter with over 12 years of experience, I can help you create smokin’ hot website copy, engaging email campaigns and a press release that will get you noticed.\n\n​\n\nI believe with my whole heart everyone has a story worth telling. Are you ready to quit being an aspiring author so you can become a published author? Let’s jump on a 15-minute call to see if we’re a good fit and talk about next steps.\n\n​\n\nI'd love to help you tell your best story and let you take all the credit!\n\n​\n\nTalk soon!\n\nLove,\n\n​"
