        "text": "Gloversville, NY (12078)\n\nToday\n\nCloudy early, then off and on rain showers for the afternoon. High 68F. Winds W at 10 to 15 mph. Chance of rain 40%..\n\nTonight\n\nClear skies. Low 53F. Winds WNW at 5 to 10 mph.\n\nUpdated: August 12, 2024 @ 6:39 am\n\nPaul was born November 7, 1941 in Ephrata, NY to the late Allen H. Savage and Thelma Savage Lusk. He graduated from Johnstown High School in 1960 and he grew up on the family farm in Ephrata. Paul worked for local farmers, and set pins at the bowling alley in Johnstown. Paul was very proud to have served in the United States Air Force during the Vietnam War. He retired from General Electric as a sheet metal worker after 35 years. Paul was well known for his love of antique cars, which he owned too many to count. It was not unusual to see him at the classic car show in town, in Vermont, or anywhere else he thought would be fun to go to. Paul took great pride in all of his cars, especially his '57 Bellaire and his '37 Hot Rod pickup he restored himself. Paul was preceded in death by his 24-year-old son, Lt. Christopher Savage who was tragically killed in the Line of Duty while serving with the Sir William Johnson Fire Department in Johnstown, NY, as he was responding to a call.\n\nSurvivors include his son Stephen Matthew (Jenny) Savage of Johnstown and his daughter Lisa (Michael) French of Essex; his siblings Allen Savage of Johnstown, Delbert Savage of Gloversville, and Ralph Savage of Johnstown, Thelma Chamberlain of Johnstown, Linda VanDuesen of Ephratah, Sheila Savage of Ephratah, and Shirley Aguilera of Gloversville; grandchildren, Stephen Christopher Savage and Hunter French; and several nieces and nephews. A Memorial Service will be held at the Johnstown Church of Christ, 107 Stoller Road, Johnstown, NY at 1 p.m. on Saturday, April 13, 2024.\n\nThe family would like to thank Dr. Hassam for all his great care through the years and his gentle push for dad to move up north to be cared for by the great staff at CVSC. Dad you always had a beautiful smile all the time and were always happy to visit for hours. You will be missed more than words can say and were loved by all.\n\nServices were entrusted to Heidrick Funeral Home, 7521 Court St., Elizabethtown, NY."
