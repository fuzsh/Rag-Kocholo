        "text": "On the Savage Side is inspired by a true crime case known as the Chillicothe Six out of Chillicothe, Ohio. Chillicothe is a town I have known since I was a child. Part of my research in writing the novel, was to revisit those familiar ghosts. The Chillicothe Inn, the street that cuts through downtown, the river, and the paper mill that exhales its smoke like an old dragon on the edge of town.\n\nIt was on paper from that mill that I wrote my stories on when I was a child. Writing is the first thing I remember doing as a kid without being told to do so. There was an innate urge to grab the crayon and write down what was in my head. I would make my own homemade books using cardboard as the covers and bind them together with my mother Betty’s crochet yarn.\n\nI published these homemade books under a publishing house named Sunshine, Sammy, & Fancy Paw Stories Publishing House, which was named after my cats at the time.\n\nI have always wanted to be a writer and I was lucky enough to be brought up in a house full of books and by a mother who stressed the importance of reading. I was raised in Southern Ohio, which is a place of myth and legend. It is there that the dense woodlands hang with mist and twisting grapevines. Where the rock, as old as anything juts out from the hillsides to remind you that the land had once known dinosaurs. From the time I was a kid, I found story in everything. A fork could be a wizard’s wand, the leaf fallen at my feet was the footprint of a brontosaurus, and the river was the long tongue of the jaguar stalking the trees that I climbed to the very top of.\n\nAppalachian Dream\n\nI quicken my pace across the open and bewildered\n\ndance hall. The yard, monstrous, heaped with fists and\n\nstars. I gaze out through the holes in your handkerchief.\n\nThe finest soft milky moon, balances upon our\n\nshoulders. I remember the springs, like a fever of red\n\nclover. The old plow marks, filling up each rain. The\n\nwild rabbits are witchy, beyond hearts and hills,\n\ncontinents above, they eat the white paper notices.\n\nWhen grandfather was twenty, the plants grew for him.\n\nNow the notices stick on the windowpanes\n\nlike snowflakes caught from old winters\n\npast.\n\nGrandmother begs to stay. She eats her chocolate\n\nand thinks of better days. She now jumps over\n\nthe tub, fearful of the moving hands in front of\n\nthe mirror.\n\nI’m married to the moon, she says. I can’t leave my husband.\n\nBut the coat’s pocket is empty, and the fields are barren.\n\nA goodnight sails across the darkness.\n\nUnder old trees, in the crystal path, we\n\nmust carefully place the memories.\n\nI shiver into the firm beating of the dirt.\n\nMy bones hidden amongst the promise of the Appalachian dream.\n\nI twist away until I am taller,\n\naway from the ventriloquist to break my wires.\n\nI open my own mouth to say, Here\n\nis my song.\n\nI was fortunate to be raised not only in the Cherokee culture, but in nature, surrounded with gardens bursting with plants, in woods full of wildlife, and in the hills that were ripe with legends of their own. Standing on the banks of the river, where the gars emerged with their heads up like alligators, my father once told me a zoo had gone belly up and released its lions, tigers and bears into the woods. I walked with the dragons of lore. It is that same stirring of mist and myth that I returned to as I wrote On the Savage Side.\n\nNewspaper Announcement\n\nFolklore is fierce.\n\nBeloved and ignited\n\nIn folk devotion I take my body to\n\nthe rich bottom lands in the foothills\n\nof the Ohio valley. It is tradition here\n\nto make the furniture for the\n\nwedding bed. Like a crown or a\n\nsuperstition, the hillbillies are ragged\n\nand the customs are twinkling out\n\nagainst modern cures and tokens.\n\nCrime is king. Drug is centered. In\n\nthe pasture, victims lay with the\n\npigs, wondering when the doe got\n\nso violent and bullet holes were the\n\neasiest way to be buried by our\n\nfathers who drank too much milk\n\nand butter.\n\nI have over twenty novels written and in many, I flip through my personal memories. In the case of the characters of Aunt Clover and Addie in On the Savage Side, I remembered those moments I spent with my aunts Fraya and Flossie. I wrote of them in my previous book, Betty.\n\nMy aunts were women who each dealt with addiction in their lives. The savage side of life exists. For some of us, it exists a little more.\n\nMy Aunt Was a Witch\n\nThe frog stiffened into a flinty lure.\n\nBeyond the buried spells we invite\n\nsparks and squeals, piteously ignorant\n\nof the dumb thanks we ferry across the\n\nshore. We tried to catch the rain that\n\nflooded your life, drop by drop. They\n\nsay when you drowned, it was a curse.\n\nBut this is a mortal story, unseen\n\nexcept by the dust spelling forth, like\n\nthe hatred of your burial. They hung\n\nher for revenge. She would pay your\n\ndeath, they said, her legs swinging\n\nback and forth over the dandelions.\n\nBright yellow. And a crack in the\n\nflesh. We can blossom out of protest to\n\nyour hanging, Auntie.\n\nWe can pray you\n\ninto a lady, but you’ll still\n\nbe jagged under the cape\n\nand the urn will still be\n\nfull\n\nof your ashes we have yet to spread. We\n\nfear the flowers that grow. This pious\n\ntown has already lit the match, believing\n\nthe devil is in your daughter, too.\n\nIn many ways, going back to Chillicothe with this story was also rewinding the years. I had grown up in communities impacted by drugs and generational addiction in both south central and southern Ohio.\n\nI played with kids like Arc and Daffy, the twin sisters in the novel. I knew these kids were coming from different homes than my own. Their homes were broken by addiction and they often suffered emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. One of these kids, I have remained friends with throughout our lives. Though her path has led her down a road similar to Arc and Daffy’s, she shares their survivor spirit.\n\nSaid the Girl on My Street\n\nMy mouth is wide and has no name, but\n\nI am shiny and ride among the stars.\n\nCausing a flood with my tears,\n\nI follow the galaxy line, past the planets\n\nAnd their festivals of men. In a metal\n\nUniverse, I catch the iron butterflies\n\nTheir wings like a wormhole I travel\n\nTo the reflection of myself. At the speed\n\nOf light, I refine my generation into a sculpture\n\nThat is not without thought. In a room Full of\n\nauthors, there is one god.\n\nResting in the heavens, the sky black,\n\nBut detailed in violet, I can smell the odors\n\nOf power. There is science in my heart, but savages\n\nOn my body. Kicking and screaming, I tell them\n\nI am a god. They write hieroglyphics with the smoke\n\nOf their cigarettes, while I wear an eclipse\n\nOn my complexion, shading out the sun For\n\nanother night.\n\nAs I wrote the characters of Arc and Daffy, short for Arcade and Daffodil, I knew I wanted to explore the entire arc of their lives, from childhood to adulthood, so that they are fully formed, and not just the shadows of the headlines from the crime. Together they form a small band of friendship with local women. They call themselves the Chillicothe Queens. They escape to their distant mountain by the river where they speak in their own language of myth and legend.\n\nGirl, Be Good\n\nLittle sister? Did you boil\n\nthe sugar in the kitchen?\n\nUntil it’s crystal clear enough\n\nto see our futures in? I am\n\nthe shape of someone’s\n\nmother. I don’t know her. I\n\nthink she lives in the\n\nshadows, or works only\n\nweekdays when the\n\nmornings are parted by\n\nhymns and nylons.\n\nMy bed is preface to blame.\n\nDespite decisions already made,\n\nI toy with trouble. Give me a\n\nfew seconds to put my flesh\n\nback on. I love feeling the\n\ngrimy power\n\nof old and good\n\nwonders.\n\nLittle sister, here’s my wisdom, few\n\nunderstand how sweet honey is.\n\nDo not be one of them.\n\nAs I wrote in the essay for Waterstones special edition, I have always lived by a river. Anyone who has grown up by water has likely learned how to skip a stone. An important lesson, passed down through the generations. Because if something as heavy as a rock can skip across the delicate path of water without sinking, then there is hope that we, too, may skip across the tides to the shelter on the other side.\n\nLost Ohio"
