        "text": "Let's Chat! Upon entering this tier you get access to tiers 1-3, and once a month we can schedule a Skype call or video chat to talk about writing, storytelling, or anything else that you want! You can use this time to ask my professional opinion on certain matters of editing or just have a nice conversation.\n\n*Call will be 20 minutes\n\nNOTE: Should you opt in for a higher tier, this call is not an hour-long feedback call/coaching consultation. We can use this time to talk about your work if you so choose, but it will be capped at the 20-minute mark.If you are interested in a coaching consultation please see my website for contact information.\n\nAlong with everything from tiers 1-5, you get discounted editing services! You receive 30% off all editing services after one month of patronage, and one 30-minute career development call a month. If youâ€™re looking to create a YouTube channel or push your writing or editing career and you want someone along with you every step of the way, this is a great option for you.\n\nDepending on what type of editing you want, this tier could actually save you hundreds of dollars! Just message me for the available services."
