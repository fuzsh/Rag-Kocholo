        "text": "Mark Robinson, the owner of Savage Marine, has been in the boat repair business for over 35 years. Mark is certified in all Mercruiser products and all other major brands.\n\nHe started his career in 1986 right out of high school when he went to Lake Powell working on their rental boats. During that time, he discovered that the boating industry would be his destiny. Coming back to Lake Havasu, Mark went to work with one of the few true Mercury master techs doing marine repairs.\n\nOver the years, Mark has attended multiple invite-only, factory training schools, which include some of Mercury's highest-awarded certificates.\n\nThrough the years, Mark has also had his hands on some circle boat racing all the way up to the top drag boat racing.\n\nAs the main tech for 7 years at Savage Marine, Mark's dream of owning Savage Marine with his son by his side has come true. He is excited to bring Savage Marine to a new level of service with keen attention to detail and customer needs."
