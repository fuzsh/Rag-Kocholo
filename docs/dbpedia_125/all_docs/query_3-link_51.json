        "text": "J Scott Savage is the author of twenty-three published novels. His books have received starred reviews from Kirkus and Publishers Weekly, been a Jr. Library Guild selection, Amazon Book of the Month, and Barnes and Noble Select book, and received awards including a Whitney Award, Young Hoosier finalist, Louisiana Young Readers nominee, and others. He has taught at many writing conferences including: Storymakers, ANWA, League of Utah Writers, WIFYR, LTUE, SCBWI, Lone Star Writing Conference, Teen Author Boot Camp, The Teen Writing Conference, and others.\n\nThis course will include three two-hour intermediate to advanced level craft classes and one two-hour class focused on standing out in the market with Scott’s Penguin editor, Alex Wolfe, and artist Brandon Dorman, plus a 25 minute Zoom call with Scott scheduled at your convenience.\n\nThe current plan is to schedule the four class on Thursday evenings from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM MDT. But I’ll do a poll before we start to make sure that is the most convenient time for everyone.\n\nAll class will be held over Zoom and recorded, so you can watch live or stream anytime you want over a private YouTube link. All slides and notes will be available via a shared Google Docs folder.\n\nSchedule is as follows:\n\nNote: While Scott has taught versions of these classes before, they will all be significantly upgraded from previous versions.\n\nJune 27th: Do More With Every Scene\n\nOne of the biggest changes in book publishing over the last five years is how much the cost of paper has gone up. That means publishers are paying a lot closer attention to word count. This means that you need to pack more into every scene of your story.\n\nWe will look at six different elements of story and how you can blend them all into each scene you write. This allows you as an author to not only do more with fewer words, but also makes your scenes more compelling to the reader.\n\nJune 11th: Why World-building Isn’t Just For Fantasy\n\nOne of the hardest things to do as an author is balancing what you’d like the reader to know, what they need to know to become immersed in the story, and what you’re holding back for later in the story. Give too much information too early and the reader gets bored. Give too little and they get frustrated. Fail to recognize their questions and they will assume you’re a bad writer.\n\nIn this class, we will examine how to break down the world-building elements, separate them, and present them to the reader in the flow of the story. This will cover elements of all genres, both speculative and not.\n\nJuly 18th: Scene and Sequel. What it is, How You Use it, and Why it’s Probably Not What You Think\n\nIn their essence, S&S seem pretty straight forward. You character wants something, and they either do or don’t get it. Followed by their reaction to the previous result and creating a new plan. Honestly, it’s pretty true to how we live our lives every day. I want that. I didn’t get that. Oh, snap, what now?\n\nSo why do so many people struggle with these two key elements of story-telling? In my experience, it’s because they haven’t had the lightbulb moment where they suddenly see Scene and Sequel not as an element of a chapter, but as the underlying foundation of conflict, try-fail, character arc, plot arc, and almost every key element to their story. Unlike many writing tools, Scene and Sequel isn’t something you use as needed, but a key element of every successful story. Once you discover its true power, you’ll find yourself seeing it in everything you write.\n\nJuly 25th: Standing Out in a Book Market That’s More Crowded Than it’s Ever Been in the History of Publishing\n\nWhen my newest book, Quantum Interstellar Sports League went to auction, my illustrator and co-creator, Brandon Dorman, and I had phone calls with all of the editors bidding on our new series. They were all wonderful, but the minute I started talking to Alex Wolfe, I immediately knew she was the one I wanted to work with.\n\nAs a children’s book pro for many years, Alex understands not just what makes books unique, but how to channel that difference in a way that will make her books read–and sell–differently than any other book in the market, while also fitting into a space the salespeople can understand and work with. You are going to love hearing what she has to say and asking her questions.\n\nFAQs\n\nAre there age requirements to attend the class?\n\nThis class is aimed at intermediate to advanced fiction writers, because of this, I’d like to limit registration to no younger than teens.\n\nHow can I contact the organizer with any questions?\n\nAny questions can be e-mailed to Jennifer at info@jscottsavage.com\n\nWhat’s the refund policy?\n\nRegistrations may be refunded up to three days before the event. No refunds will be available after that.\n\nIs my registration fee transferrable?\n\nYou may resell or transfer your registration to another attendee.\n\nIs it ok if the name on my registration doesn’t match the person who attends?\n\nYes. Just let us know the e-mail address of who should be contacted with class info.\n\nCan I stream the class if I can’t attend?\n\nYes. All classes will be recorded, including Q&A. We will send out recording links after the class."
