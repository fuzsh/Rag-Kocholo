        "text": "What Can You Expect in Call of Duty Season 5 Reloaded?\n\nSeason 5 Reloaded is adding three new Operators: 21 Savage, Lara Croft, and Mace. Players will also have new weapon and vehicle challenges to complete, and a new map called Fort Resurgence will be added to the rotation. Armored Royale mode is returning, and there will be bug fixes and updates. This is a great time to prepare for Modern Warfare 3 by engaging with the Carry Forward mechanic.\n\nAlso Read| Xbox game pass $1 trial no longer available ahead of Starfield release\n\nWill Modern Warfare 2 Cosmetics Continue to Modern Warfare 3?\n\nCall of Duty fans will be happy to know that they can bring their weapons, Operators, and completion camos from MW2 and Warzone to Modern Warfare 3. This means that players can continue to progress their weapons and camos even after Modern Warfare 3 launches. This is great news for players who are still playing MW2 and Warzone, and it means that any rewards they earn in Season 6 will not be obsolete when Modern Warfare 3 launches."
