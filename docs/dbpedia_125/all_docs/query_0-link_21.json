        "text": "1 BACKGROUND\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, has been ranked as the sixth leading cause of death in the United States and the fifth leading cause of death in older people (≥65 years old). Although the role of genetic factors in the development of AD has been widely recognized, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) typically identify regions or loci rather than specific genes and/or variants. Additionally, the loci identified by GWAS only explain a small portion of the total heritability of AD (h2AD = [0.58–0.79]).1 Next-generation sequencing technology applied in diverse populations as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP) may help to elucidate the genetic architecture of AD, and thus, aid in the development of effective strategies to diagnose, prevent, and treat AD.2\n\nA recent large GWAS totaling 111,326 clinically diagnosed/“proxy” AD cases and 677,663 controls has identified over 70 loci associated with AD and related dementias.3 However, the characterization of these loci remains incomplete. Leveraging whole genome sequence (WGS) data that encompass the full spectrum of genetic variation including common and rare variants might identify important AD genes within these GWAS loci and provide a better understanding of the biological mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of AD.\n\nPrevious studies that used WGS to identify genetic loci associated with AD performed genome-wide association with limited sample sizes.4-7 These prior WGS studies include a family-based study conducted in 2247 subjects from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)/National Institute on Aging (NIA) with replication in 1669 independent participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)/ADSP.4 More recently, the same team investigated the association of groups of rare variants in the same datasets using a sliding-window approach.5 Additional studies conducted in Asian populations highlighted the importance of increasing the representation of understudied population groups and the potential of WGS to uncover population-specific genetic loci.6, 7 We posit that until WGS is available in much larger samples, this data type is better suited for interrogation of previously identified loci rather than identification of novel loci.\n\nIn this work, we performed a deep interrogation of known AD GWAS loci using the ADSP WGS data. We focused the scope of the current study by only considering the AD GWAS loci identified in the GWAS with the largest number of AD cases to date.3 The ADSP aims to identify protective or risk genetic contributors for AD in populations with diverse ancestry. The ADSP has generated single nucleotide variant and insertion/deletion (indel) calls based on WGS data from 4789 participants, which are publicly available (R1 data release https://dss.niagads.org/datasets/ng00067-v1/). The goal of the current study is not the replication of prior GWAS findings as we are underpowered to do so. In addition, it is important to note that the ADSP sample in the current analyses is not independent of the sample used in Bellenguez et al.3 Although independent samples are critical for replication, the goal of the current study is to provide a more comprehensive look at GWAS loci using more detailed data via WGS. Hence, it is appropriate to utilize a dataset that includes overlapping samples but novel genomic data.\n\nWe conducted single variant association analyses and rare variant aggregation association tests using the R1 WGS data of ADSP to identify specific genetic variants, genes, and non-coding regions associated with AD within previously identified AD loci. We also examined multi-ancestry evidence for AD associations through population-specific analyses in White/European-ancestry (EA), Black/African-American (AA), and Hispanic/Latino (HI) subgroups, and a multi-population meta-analysis. The insights gained from our analysis will contribute to a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and potentially identify new targets for AD drugs and treatment.\n\n2 METHODS\n\n2.1 Study participants\n\nData from the ADSP are available to qualified investigators via the NIA Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS) (https://dss.niagads.org/). This study was done under an approved NIAGADS research use statement and local Institutional Review Board approval. The current analyses focused on participants with WGS data in the NIAGADS file set named “R1 5K WGS Project Level VCF.” WGS data have been generated in multiple cohorts as part of the ADSP. The ADSP data included in this study are comprised of distinct phases including the Discovery, Discovery Extension, and Augmentation phases. The Discovery phase WGS was generated from individuals of multiplex AD families as previously described.8-10 The Discovery Extension phase consisted of a family component and a case-control component. The Discovery Extension family component WGS was generated on additional members of selected families from the Discovery phase as well as members of 77 additional families. A set of 114 Hispanic control individuals was also sequenced with the family component.\n\nA focus of the Discovery Extension case-control component was to increase the diversity of the ADSP samples. The ADSP Discovery Extension WGS was generated on 3082 individuals, with approximately one-third each from EA, AA, and HI populations. In the ADSP Discovery and Discovery Extension phases, sequencing was performed at three sequencing centers via the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). Sequence data for ADSP Augmentation Studies were supported by NIA and private funding and are shared with the research community via NIAGADS. The ADSP data coordinating center, the Genomic Center for AD (GCAD), produced a jointly called and quality controlled (QC'ed) dataset for WGS10 that included the ADSP WGS Discovery, Discovery Extension, and from the Augmentation phase, the ADNI study. Details of studies included in the ADSP can be found at NIAGADS under the following dataset: NG00067 ADSP Umbrella Study (https://dss.niagads.org/datasets/ng00067/).\n\n2.2 WGS quality control\n\nLow-quality variants were filtered out based on the GCAD-provided flags, which were generated separately for the Family, Case-Control, and ADNI sub-studies.10 In addition, GCAD provided the ABHet ratio computed as (the total reference reads over all heterozygous genotypes)/(total alternative and reference reads over all heterozygous genotypes). A variant was excluded if it failed the GATK Variant Quality Score Recalibration (VQSR) filter, if all genotypes were missing, if it was monomorphic, or if it had a low call rate across all studies. Additional filtering was implemented within each sub-study. If a variant had high read depth (>500 reads) within a sub-study or had ABHet < 0.25 or ABHet > 0.75 within a sub-study, all the genotypes within that sub-study were set to missing. After these filters were applied, a final call rate filter of 95% across all sub-studies was implemented.\n\n2.3 AD phenotype definition\n\nThe ADSP provides different AD status variable definitions for participants included via case-control versus family-based studies. AD case status in the current analyses was clinician-determined. The criteria varied by study and may have been based on cognitive testing, neuropathological examination, or physician diagnosis. In the current analysis, for individuals in the ADSP case-control study, we defined AD cases as individuals with either prevalent or incident AD. Case-control individuals with no prevalent or incident AD were defined as controls and those with missing status were defined as unknown. In the ADSP family phenotype file, possible values for the AD status variable include no dementia, definite AD, probable AD, possible AD, family-reported AD, other dementia, family reported no dementia, and unknown. For family-based individuals, we defined an AD case as either possible, probable, or definite AD. AD controls were defined as individuals coded as having no dementia. We redefined individuals with family-reported AD, other dementia, or unknown status as missing AD status. The ADNI phenotype data, which is part of the ADSP Augmentation study, provides information on mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in addition to AD status. Individuals with a current diagnosis of MCI (N = 320) were included as AD controls in the current study. After selecting genetically unique individuals with AD status available, a total of 4567 participants (2383 controls and 2184 cases) with WGS were included in the analyses.\n\n2.4 Analysis overview\n\nFigure 1 provides an overview of our analysis workflow. Single variant association analysis was performed on common variants in both the pooled sample and population-specific samples. Two types of rare variant aggregate association analyses were performed in the pooled sample: gene-based testing and non-coding rare variant testing. To meet the goal of interrogating previously identified GWAS loci, we only considered analysis results for variants within 100 kb of the lead GWAS variants from Bellenguez et al.3 Analysis details are provided below.\n\n2.5 Pooled sample single-variant association analysis\n\nSingle-variant association analysis of AD was performed on variants within GWAS loci for participants with both phenotype and genotype data available using GENESIS.11 Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed as described in the supplemental methods to assess and adjust for the genetic ancestry of the study participants (Figure S1). The WGS samples included in the ADSP R1 WGS dataset were sequenced across four sequencing centers (Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center, The Broad Institute, McDonnell Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, and Illumina) and two sequencing platforms (Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500, and Illumina HiSeq X Ten). To control for the effects of study design and technical differences, we generated indicator variables (study × sequencing center × sequencing platform) with 10 categories based on Table 1. We considered these indicator variables as technical covariates and defined case-control × Broad × HiSeq X Ten, which had the largest number of observations, as the reference group. We used a generalized logistic mixed-effects model to account for relatedness through a genetic relationship matrix (GRM). The GRM was estimated based on the same variants used in the PCA. We included sex, the technical covariates, and PC2 (based on a Bonferroni corrected significant p < 0.0016 for testing 32 PCs) as covariates in the null model. We performed the analysis across autosomes and kept variants satisfying the following criteria: a call rate higher than 95%, and a minor allele count (MAC) higher than 20.\n\nAll (N = 4567) AA (N = 995) HI (N = 1516) EA (N = 2043) Other (N = 13) Age (SD) 76.9 (8.3) 79.2 (7.6) 75.1 (8.5) 77.1 (8.4) 77.3 (6.6) Alzheimer's disease (%) Case 2184 (47.8%) 463 (46.5%) 795 (52.4%) 921 (45.1%) 5 (46.2%) Control 2383 (52.2%) 532 (53.5%) 721(47.6%) 1122 (54.9%) 8 (53.8%) Sex (%) Female 2822 (61.8%) 710 (71.4%) 1020 (67.3%) 1086 (53.2%) 6 (38.5%) Male 1745 (38.2%) 285 (28.6%) 496 (32.7%) 957 (46.8%) 7 (61.5%) Study (%) ADNI 797 (17.5%) 26 (2.6%) 10 (0.7%) 750 (36.7%) 11 (84.6%) ADSP- case-control 2963 (64.9%) 944 (94.9%) 1107 (73.0%) 911 (44.6%) 1 (7.7%) ADSP- family 807 (17.7%) 25 (2.5%) 399 (26.3%) 382 (18.7%) 1 (7.7%) Sequencing center (%) Baylor 1241 (27.2%) 0 (0) 1103 (72.8%) 138 (6.8%) 0 (0) Broad 1263 (27.7%) 2 (0.2%) 286 (18.9%) 974 (47.7%) 1 (7.7%) Illumina 797 (17.5%) 26 (2.6%) 10 (0.7%) 750 (36.7%) 11 (84.6%) WashU 1266 (27.7%) 967 (97.2%) 117 (7.7%) 181 (8.9%) 1 (7.7%) Platform (%) HiSeq X Ten 3227 (70.7%) 965 (97.0%) 1186 (78.2%) 1074 (52.6%) 2 (15.4%) HiSeq2000/2500 1340 (29.3%) 30 (3.0%) 330 (21.8%) 969 (47.4%) 11 (84.6%)\n\nTo determine if the significant variants identified were distinct from the lead GWAS variants,3 we computed linkage disequilibrium (LD; r2) between the significant variants and the lead GWAS variants within each population based on the ADSP genetic data.\n\n2.6 Population-specific association analysis\n\nWe conducted population-specific analyses (null model and association analyses) for AD using GENESIS, accounting for genetic relatedness using a GRM. We defined three population groups (EA, AA, and HI). We selected a total of 2144 EA participants based on PCA analysis performed using both the ADSP and the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP). Only participants who were not outliers based on six standard deviations (SD) from the mean for PCs 1 through 4 calculated in the European HGDP groups (Adygei, Basque, French, BergamoItalian, Orcadian, Russian, Sardinian, and Tuscan) were retained. We selected a total of 1028 AA and 1548 HI participants based on reported race and ethnicity. A total of 38 participants who identified as both African-American and Hispanic were placed in the Hispanic population. We included in the null model, in each population group, covariates associated with AD status at p ≤ 0.05. The EA null model included sex, ADSP family study status, Illumina sequencing center, HiSeq X Ten platform, PC 2, PC 9, and PC 15. The HI null model included sex, all sequencing centers, HiSeq X Ten platform, PC 13, PC 16, and PC 17. The AA null model included sex, Illumina sequencing center, and PC 1. We performed association analyses, in each population group, and retained the results with a call rate higher than 95% and a MAC higher than 20. In addition, we performed a multi-population meta-analysis using three different models (fixed-effect, random-effect, and Han & Eskin's modified random-effect) implemented in Metasoft12 by combining the population-specific results satisfying the criteria of a within-population MAC higher than 10. We then kept the meta-analysis results passing a total MAC across population groups higher than 20.\n\n2.7 Gene-based tests\n\nWe tested the association of aggregate groups of low frequency (minor allele frequency [MAF] < 5%) or rare (MAF < 1%) genetic variants with AD status. Annotation for all called variants was generated using Ensembl VEP91 by the ADSP annotation working group. We selected missense or loss of function (lof) genetic variants based on the most severe variant consequence according to the ADSP Annotation Working Group Ranking Process and listed in the annotation file (frameshift variant, inframe deletion, inframe insertion, missense variant, protein-altering variant, splice acceptor variant, splice donor variant, start lost, stop gained, and stop lost). We conducted the Sequence Kernel Association Test (SKAT, mmskat) and burden tests (combined multivariate and collapsing [CMC], emmaxCMC) with EPACTS (Efficient and Parallelizable Association Container Toolbox) using mixed-effect models adjusted for sex, technical covariates, and PCs significantly associated with AD status (PC2) while accounting for relatedness using a GRM.\n\n2.8 Non-coding rare variant analysis\n\nFor non-coding rare variant analysis, we used annotations from WGSA v0.813 including annotations from ANNOVAR, VEP, SnpEff, COSMIC, and SPIDEX. We conducted rare variant analysis using the variant-Set Test for Association using Annotation infoRmation (STAAR) method,14 which was developed to boost the power of rare variant analyses by effectively incorporating both variant functional categories and multiple complementary functional annotations while accounting for relatedness and population structures. We used the same covariates (sex, technical covariates, and significant PCs) in the model as in the single-variant analysis. The GRM was incorporated to account for relatedness among samples.\n\nWe aggregated sites that overlap enhancers and promoters around gene transcription start sites (TSS). The promoters within 5 kb of a TSS that overlap DNase hypersensitivity sites (DHS) are defined as at least one WGSA H3K4me3 annotation for brain tissues (E067, E068, E069, E070, E071, E072, E073, E074, E081, E082), and the enhancers within 20 kb of a TSS are defined by EnhancerFinder in Brain. We incorporated annotations from WGSA in the analysis, which include MAF, functional scores (GERP, GenoCanyon, RegulomeDB, FUNSEQ, CADD, Fathmm, EIGEN-PC), and the ENCODE score (DNASE). We then transformed the annotation scores to phred-scaled scores using −10 × log10(rank[score]/M), where M is the total number of variants tested in the analysis.\n\n2.9 Focus on GWAS loci\n\nGiven the limited power to detect novel loci with the current sample size, we focused on exploiting WGS to provide insights on previously reported AD GWAS loci. We used the variants listed in Bellenguez et al. as the previously reported AD GWAS top variants.3 For single variant association analyses, we looked up these lead variants in the ADSP WGS data. We then assessed ADSP WGS associations within 100 kb of each lead GWAS variant. For gene-based and non-coding rare variant analysis, we obtained the results for genes or regions in the 100 kb window around each lead variant. We included genes or non-coding regions for which any portion overlapped with the specified window. Using this paradigm, we identified 303 genes within 100 kb of the index single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).\n\nIn general, we defined a threshold for statistical significance equal to 0.05/number of statistical tests and a suggestive threshold as 1/number of statistical tests. Within a 100 kb window, many single variant tests were highly correlated. Therefore, we computed the effective number of independent tests using the simpleM approach15 and used the effective number of tests in the denominator when computing a window-specific threshold for single variant association testing. Effective numbers of tests were computed across the pooled sample and within each population subgroup (Table S1).\n\nWe leveraged publicly available multi-omic resources, from quantitative trait locus (xQTL) analyses applied to RNA sequence and DNA methylation from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 411 older adults from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Memory and Aging Project (MAP) studies16 to look up the main genetic variants from the pooled association analysis.\n\n3 RESULTS\n\n3.1 Description of the ADSP data\n\nAfter the QC check of the ADSP data release NG00067.v2, there were over 95 million variants across 4733 participants. A total of 4567 individuals (2383 controls, 2184 cases) have available AD status and contributed to the analyses, among which 807 are from the ADSP family study, 2963 are from the ADSP case-control study, and 797 are from ADNI. The participants included in the analyses were more likely to be women (61.8%) than men. The distribution of study design membership, sequencing centers, and sequencing platforms is summarized in Table 1.\n\n3.2 Pooled sample single-variant association analysis\n\nGenome-wide, there were about 20 million variants with a call rate higher than 95% and a MAC higher than 20 in the pooled sample analysis. Our model that included GRM and PC adjustments showed acceptable type-I error control (λ = 1.05, Figure S2). As expected, the strongest association was observed at the apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus, where the major APOE variant rs429358 (p = 7.2 × 10−77) was the top hit.\n\nAmong the specific lead GWAS variants from Bellenguez et al.,3 none reached the strict significance threshold (p < 6 × 10−4, Bonferroni correction for the total number of variants tested) in the pooled sample association analysis. Full results for the 83 lead GWAS variants are provided in the supplement (Table S2).\n\nApplying the significance thresholds based on the effective number of tests within 100 kb windows around the lead GWAS variants (Table S1), we identified 17 significant variants in the single variant association analysis in the pooled sample (Table 2). Sensitivity analysis performed removing the MCI individuals (N = 320) showed negligible change in p-values or effect size estimates (Table S3). These 17 variants occur in five genomic regions on chromosomes 6, 7, 14, and 16. Forest plots for the top variant in each of these five regions are presented in Figure 2. Examination of LD patterns shows near-perfect LD among the variants identified on chromosome 6, on chromosome 7, and for the one region on chromosome 14 with multiple variants. Only a single variant was identified on chromosome 16 and in one region on chromosome 14. Detailed LD information is provided in the supplement (Figure S3).\n\nPooled single variant association analysis Chr:Pos:A2:A1a rsid Gene Location GWAS variantsb GWAS locib MAF p-value Beta 6:41067923:C:T rs115774857 OARD1 (close gene APOBEC2) intronic rs143332484, rs75932628, rs10947943 TREM2, UNC5CL 0.0080 1.0E-04 1.016 6:41077355:A:G rs145520578 OARD1, NFYA intronic 0.0080 9.9E-05 1.018 6:41077511:A:C rs115202236 intronic 0.0081 9.9E-05 1.018 6:41082030:G:A rs12200736 intronic rs143332484, rs75932628, rs60755019, rs10947943 TREM2, TREML2, UNC5CL 0.0080 1.0E-04 1.018 6:41083056:C:T rs10947945 intronic 0.0080 1.0E-04 1.018 6:41088533:T:C rs12210716 intronic 0.0080 1.0E-04 1.018 6:41147490:T:G rs12199328 intergenic (close gene TREML1) 0.0080 1.0E-04 1.018 6:41173956:G:Ac rs10947950c intergenic intergenic rs143332484, rs75932628, rs60755019 TREM2, TREML2 0.0128 1.4E-04 0.783 7:28034934:T:A rs73683942 JAZF1 intronic rs1160871 JAZF1 0.0188 7.5E-05 −0.627 7:28034935:C:G rs78789160 intronic 0.0188 7.5E-05 −0.627 7:28035459:GAGAT:G no rsids intronic 0.0188 1.9E-05 −0.677 7:28037452:A:C rs73683943 intronic 0.0191 3.8E-05 −0.644 7:28042506:C:G rs60825597 intronic 0.0196 7.8E-05 −0.607 14:52885670:T:TA rs1310103853 FERMT2 intronic rs17125924 FERMT2 0.0174 4.5E-06 0.806 14:52932032:A:G rs60609189 intronic 0.0189 7.4E-06 0.768 14:52992239:A:G rs12431954 intergenic 0.0205 3.8E-06 0.763 14:92467728:C:T rs7155002 SLC24A4 intronic rs12590654, rs7401792 SLC24A4 0.4460 1.4E-05 −0.198 16:31117787:C:G rs201871085 KAT8 (close gene BCKDK) missense variant, non-coding transcript exon variant rs889555 BCKDK 0.0108 2.4E-05 0.926\n\nLD patterns were examined to assess if these associations represented the same signal as the lead GWAS variant from Bellenguez et al. or distinct signals. In the SLC24A4 region, rs7155002 (14:92467728:C:T) was in high LD (r2 = 0.99) with the lead GWAS variant rs7401792 (14:92472511:G:A) in the EA population. The LD was moderate in the other populations (r2 = 0.44 and 0.74, for AA and HI, respectively) at the SLC24A4 region. LD with the lead GWAS variant was not observed in any other region included in Table 2 (r2 < 0.02) across all populations considered (Figure S3).\n\n3.3 Population-specific single-variant association analysis and multi-population meta-analysis\n\nWe conducted population-specific association analyses in the three main subgroups (N = 2043 EA; N = 995 AA, and N = 1516 HI participants). There was an acceptable type-I error in the population-specific analyses and the multi-population meta-analysis (Figures S4-S7). We confirmed the significant association of the APOE locus (rs429358) in both the population-specific analyses and the multi-population meta-analysis. However, as found in previous studies17, 18 the association was weaker in the HI population (beta = 1.17 in EA, 1.02 in AA, and 0.59 in HI).\n\nPopulation-specific single-variant analyses identified 23 significant variants in 11 loci within 100 kb of the lead GWAS variants (Table 3). Of these, 15 variants (eight loci) were identified in the EA population and eight variants (three loci) in the AA population. No significant variants were identified in the HI population. The only overlap in significant variants between the pooled sample and the population-specific single-variant analyses was a missense variant in KAT8, which was very rare in the AA and HI subsamples (Table S4).\n\nWhite/European Ancestry Black/African American Hispanic/Latino Chr:Pos:A2:A1a N Freq MAC p value Beta N Freq MAC p value Beta N Freq MAC p value Beta 4:11052797:T:C 2040 0.0002 1 3.04E-01 2.069 984 0.137 270 8.37E-05 −0.534 1513 0.059 180 4.94E-01 0.113 4:11053332:C:T 2043 0.0002 1 3.04E-01 2.068 995 0.137 273 8.66E-05 −0.530 1516 0.059 179 4.83E-01 0.116 5:180211637:C:T 2042 0.143 584 7.14E-05 0.385 995 0.052 104 8.00E-02 −0.351 1514 0.110 333 9.48E-01 0.009 5:180214978:G:A 2042 0.143 586 5.37E-05 0.392 994 0.051 101 1.45E-01 −0.296 1514 0.109 330 9.39E-01 0.010 5:180216117:C:T 2041 0.143 582 3.69E-05 0.400 995 0.050 100 1.72E-01 −0.278 1512 0.096 289 6.05E-01 0.073 5:180222862:G:A 2042 0.144 590 3.70E-05 0.398 995 0.079 157 3.94E-01 −0.144 1516 0.124 377 9.75E-01 0.004 5:180224704:C:T 2041 0.145 591 2.85E-05 0.403 989 0.081 160 3.81E-01 −0.147 1511 0.124 375 9.48E-01 −0.008 8:11868930:C:G 2043 0.007 27 6.52E-05 1.627 995 0.003 6 5.52E-01 −0.494 1516 0.009 26 3.26E-01 −0.414 11:86068255:T:G 2042 0.810 774 6.19E-01 0.044 992 0.886 226 5.53E-05 0.576 1516 0.811 572 8.58E-01 −0.019 11:86068268:A:G 2042 0.810 774 6.19E-01 0.044 990 0.887 224 2.49E-05 0.607 1515 0.811 572 8.45E-01 −0.021 11:86072833:A:G 2042 0.815 755 6.67E-01 0.038 992 0.888 222 5.37E-05 0.577 1516 0.816 559 7.35E-01 −0.037 11:86186529:G:A 2038 0.142 577 8.10E-02 0.169 993 0.264 525 1.21E-04 −0.403 1516 0.245 742 1.52E-01 0.137 14:105740487:C:T 1863 0.524 1772 2.12E-05 −0.479 981 0.308 605 5.33E-01 0.074 1446 0.430 1244 7.48E-02 0.204 15:63375962:G:A 2042 0.0002 1 2.53E-01 2.318 994 0.101 200 1.18E-04 0.591 1514 0.035 105 9.71E-01 0.008 15:63376200:A:G 2042 0.0002 1 2.53E-01 2.317 994 0.106 210 1.24E-04 0.576 1515 0.040 122 7.96E-01 −0.052 16:31117787:C:G 1917 0.020 76 1.11E-04 0.961 991 0.004 7 1.77E-01 1.033 1489 0.004 12 5.16E-01 0.412 16:86357432:T:C 2043 0.088 359 3.53E-05 −0.497 995 0.132 262 7.55E-01 −0.043 1516 0.097 293 4.62E-01 0.100 17:46724128:T:C 2043 0.007 30 3.58E-05 1.607 995 0.002 3 5.80E-01 −0.643 1515 0.006 17 3.75E-01 0.514 17:46747538:C:T 2043 0.007 28 3.69E-05 1.649 994 0.002 3 5.79E-01 −0.645 1515 0.006 17 3.76E-01 0.513 17:58269710:G:A 2042 0.016 67 7.96E-05 1.069 995 0.004 8 7.23E-01 0.256 1515 0.005 14 7.84E-01 −0.169 20:56407698:G:A 2037 0.004 16 3.43E-05 2.328 991 0.001 2 8.15E-01 0.339 1516 0.002 6 8.86E-01 −0.172 20:56490678:G:T 2041 0.005 19 4.74E-05 2.021 995 0.002 4 4.93E-01 −0.703 1516 0.002 6 8.86E-01 −0.172 20:56505267:G:A 2041 0.005 20 1.57E-05 2.095 995 0.002 4 4.93E-01 −0.703 1513 0.002 6 8.83E-01 −0.177\n\n3.4 Gene-based tests\n\nQQ plots for the SKAT and burden tests are provided in Figure S8. Using the multiple-testing correction threshold for 303 genes (p < 1.7 × 10−4), KAT8 (p = 2.2 × 10−5, MAF < 5%) lying within 100 kb of a GWAS variant was detected to be significantly associated with AD status by SKAT, and it was also shown as a suggestive association (p < 3.4 × 10−3) using CMC (p = 9.2 × 10−4). Within 100 kb of GWAS variants, SKAT detected suggestive associations in LAIR1 (p = 0.0023, MAF < 5%) and ATF5 (p = 5.7 × 10−4, MAF < 5%), and CMC identified TREM2 (p = 3.3 × 10−3 for MAF < 1% and 8.9 × 10−4 for MAF < 5%).\n\n3.5 Non-coding rare variant analysis\n\nQQ plots showed deflated type-I error (λ = 0.75), most likely due to the small sample size, in the STAAR rare-variant analysis (Figure S9). No regions were identified as significant using the STAAR approach. The top STAAR results overlapping GWAS loci are shown in Table S2.\n\n3.6 xQTL analysis lookup\n\nWe did not identify significant mQTL or eQTL associations for the main genetic variants identified in the pooled analysis. We could not look up some of the less frequent variants on chromosomes 7, 14, and 16 in the QTL results as these analyses were restricted to common variants. Suggestive associations have been reported between rs10947950 (chromosome 6) and cg25473438 (beta = 0.24, p = 1.4 × 10−8) and between rs7155002 (chromosome 14) and cg12072028 (beta = 0.19, p = 5.8 × 10−6), Table S5. The CpG cg12072028 is located in the intron 1 of RIN3 and modest associations have been described between rs7155002 and RIN3 expression in the brain (beta = 0.04, p = 0.01), Table S5.\n\n4 DISCUSSION\n\nGWAS have been essential in identifying genetic loci associated with AD. However, GWAS loci typically contain scores of genes and thousands of variants. Additional studies are needed to pinpoint specific genes or variants as the ones influencing the risk for AD. WGS provides complete genomic sequences and hence enumerates both common and rare variants. WGS therefore has the potential to provide information beyond common variants that are the cornerstone of GWAS. In the current study, we have examined WGS from the ADSP R1 dataset focusing on previously implicated regions to better understand important variants within AD GWAS loci in a diverse study sample. We identified 17 significant variants in five genomic regions using single-variant association analysis in the pooled sample. The majority of these variants were intronic, although two intergenic and one missense variant were also identified.\n\nBellenguez et al.3 identified multiple lead GWAS variants on chromosome 6, which yielded overlapping 100 kb windows defined by our approach. We identified seven significant variants on chromosome 6 that are in nearly complete LD. Six of these variants are located within intronic regions of the OARD1 and NFYA genes, and one variant is very close to APOBEC2. One variant was intergenic with the closest gene being TREML1. This region contains TREM2, for which several rare coding variants have been implicated as conferring risk for AD.19-22 TREM2 showed suggestive evidence of association in gene-based analyses indicating multiple variants in this region are likely to play an important role in AD. The missense variant rs75932628 was one of the lead GWAS variants from Bellenguez et al. and has been identified as a functional variant for AD.22-24 The variant rs75932628 has an MAF = 0.0035 in the ADSP pooled sample and p = 0.003 for single-variant association with AD. This suggestive association is driven by the EA population (MAF = 0.007) as this variant is less frequently observed in the AA (MAF = 0.001) or HI (MAF = 0.0003) populations. Examination of LD suggests that the variants we identified implicating OARD1/NFYA/TREML1 have an effect distinct from rs75932628. OARD1 encodes a deacylase with a function to catalyze O-acetyl-ADP-ribose during multiple cellular processes. A homozygous mutation could lead to cell death and cause a form of childhood neurodegenerative disorder.25 NFYA encodes a subunit of nuclear transcription factor Y, which is a ubiquitous transcription factor. The gene is involved in post-transcriptional regulation with tissue-specific preference, and it is suppressed in the brain of model mice with Huntington's disease26 and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy.27 TREML1 encodes a protein belonging to the family of triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells-like (TREM). A deficiency of TREML1 might result in hemorrhage due to localized inflammatory lesions.28\n\nThe five significant variants on chromosome 7 are in a strong LD block and all variants are intronic for JAZF1, which encodes a transcriptional repressor. The gene has been linked with diabetes mellitus and cancer, but also has a role in lipid metabolism supporting the connection between lipid levels and AD.29 The JAZF1 GWAS variant (rs1160871) is a strong eQTL in microglia and is considered a Tier 1 (highly plausible) AD gene.3 The block of variants identified in the current study is not in LD with the lead GWAS variant rs1160871 (7:28129126:GTCTT:G) suggesting a distinct effect on AD.\n\nWe identified two regions on chromosome 14, with significant variants intronic to FERMT2 and SLC24A4. The intronic variant rs7155002 for SLC24A4 was in strong LD with the lead GWAS variant in the EA population, indicating a likely shared effect. Lookup in brain xQTL data shed light on potential biological regulatory mechanisms in RIN3 that have also been implicated in AD.30, 31 FERMT2 encodes plekstrin homology domain-containing family C member 1 and is known to be involved in amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) metabolism.32 The under-expression of FERMT2 was associated with mature APP level increment in the cell surface.32 Previous studies reported that FERMT2 is also involved in cardiac and skeletal muscle development33 and cancer progression.34, 35 SLC24A4 encodes a member of the potassium-dependent sodium/calcium exchanger protein family and is associated with neural development.36 A homozygous mutation in SLC24A4 may cause amelogenesis imperfecta,37, 38 but the function of SLC24A4 in AD is not clearly understood.\n\nA rare missense variant (rs201871085, MAF = 0.0108 in the pooled sample) within KAT8 (lysine acetyltransferase 8) on chromosome 16 was significantly associated with AD. KAT8 was also significant in the low-frequency variant gene-based analyses. KAT8 encodes a member of the MYST histone acetylase protein family that has a characteristic MYST domain containing an acetyl-CoA-binding site, a chromodomain typical of proteins that bind histones, and a C2HC-type zinc finger. This gene has been recently identified by two large-scale GWAS of clinically diagnosed AD and family history of AD39, 40 and by a novel knockoff method when applied to the ADSP data.41 Aberrant expression patterns of KAT8 might be associated with AD progression.42 KAT8 appears to be a promising candidate gene that is involved in cerebral development43 and may play a role in neurodegeneration in both AD and Parkinson's disease.44, 45 We were not able to look up the variant rs201871085 in the brain xQTL data. This variant might not have been analyzed due to a low frequency or a low quality of imputation, thus highlighting the importance of leveraging WGS data.\n\nThe ADSP represents a diverse population sample, although in this early release of ADSP WGS data, the sample size within a specific population is limited (NEA = 2043, NAA = 995, NHI = 1516). Population-specific analyses provide information about patterns of allele frequency for AD-associated variants among populations. Among the five loci identified as significant in the pooled single-variant association analysis, two regions (chromosomes 6 and 16) displayed EA-specific associations and corresponded to low-frequency variants in EA that were rare in other population groups. One signal (chromosome 7) was driven by a variant common in AA with a low frequency in HI, and rare in EA. Finally, two regions (chromosome 14) were driven by HI signals with one variant common in all population groups, and one variant common in HI but rare in EA and AA. All these results are summarized in Table S4.\n\nThe signals identified only in AA in the population-specific analyses (chromosomes 4 and 14) corresponded to SNPs common in AA that were less common in HI and rare in EA. A few signals identified only in EA corresponded to variants that were rare in all population groups (chromosomes 8, 17, and 20). Two low-frequency signals identified only in EA (chromosomes 16 and 17) corresponded to SNPs that were rare in AA and HI. Finally, three signals identified only in EA (chromosomes 5, 14, and 16) corresponded to SNPs that were common in different population groups. All these results are summarized in Table 3.\n\nA strength of this study is the analysis of WGS data jointly called and QC'ed by a single data coordinating center. The diversity in the genetic ancestry of the participants included is another strength. Despite this diversity, a limitation of the study is the moderate sample size, particularly within each population analyzed. To overcome this limitation, the main analyses were focused on the pooled sample. However, even within the pooled sample, we acknowledge that the power of the analyses was limited. For this reason, our goal was not to seek novel loci in a genome-wide search but to interrogate previously identified loci with the detailed data provided by WGS. With the limited sample size, single rare-variant associations that are close to the significance threshold should be interpreted with some caution. But we note that in all five genomic regions, there are significant low-frequency (0.01 ≤ MAF < 0.05) or common (MAF ≥ 0.05) variants rather than only rare (MAF < 0.01) variants.\n\nThe ADSP is ongoing with larger WGS datasets being publicly released and planned. Future analyses with larger sample sizes may yield additional insights, especially for population-specific effects. The current study demonstrates the importance of leveraging WGS data to gain insights into loci identified via GWAS and highlights the contribution of low-frequency variants to AD risk.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank the contributors who collected samples used in this study, as well as patients and their families, whose help and participation made this work possible.
