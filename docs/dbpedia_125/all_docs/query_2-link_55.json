        "text": "First, I would like to say thank you very much for reaching out to me! Contacting an editor for assistance is a big decision for a writer, so I am honored that you are interested in the services that I can provide you for the work you have finished so far.\n\nMy Style of Editing\n\nI am very passionate about editing, and I also just happen to have a lot of fun doing it, so therefore I usually dive very deep into the details when editing written work. I try to never simply give an edit without an explanation; my goal is for my client to improve their skills in writing to the point where they can operate without my (or any editor’s!) assistance being a necessity. However, the only way that can happen is if the client learns what their mistake is on a conceptual level, and then learns the techniques to fix such mistakes and why those fixes work.\n\nWill you agree with all of my critiques? Perhaps, but probably not. And that is perfectly fine. All I am meant to do is bring to light the aspects of your written work that I believe can be improved. I am not the end-all-be-all authority on writing. Your work is your work, and I implore you to continue with it as you best see fit.\n\nA SAMPLE of my approach to written edits can be FOUND HERE!\n\nSPECIFICS:\n\n-Payments\n\nAll payments and services will be agreed upon and paid beforehand in USD. This way, there will never be any surprise charges for you. Payments will be processed through Pay-Pal.\n\n­-Refunds\n\nFor a Coaching Consultation, a client may request a full refund and cancellation at any point prior to 24 hours before the call. Ex: a call scheduled for Tuesday at 3pm must be cancelled by Monday at 3pm to receive a refund.\n\nFor Manuscript Consultations and written edits, a client may request a full refund and cancellation up to five days after the payment was made.\n\nIn the instance that I cannot complete an editing service after receiving payment, the client will receive a full refund.\n\n-Word count Calculations\n\nManuscript word counts will be rounded down to the nearest thousand to avoid any unnecessary charges. For example, if a manuscript is 21,630 words, the word count will be rounded down to 21,000 words for pricing purposes.\n\n-Word count Minimums\n\nThe Services section will detail various word count minimums. These are not restrictions on what you can submit; they are simply indications of the base cost of editing services. You are more than welcome to submit a piece below the word count minimum if you are willing to pay the base price.\n\n-Turnaround Estimates\n\nAs each manuscript submitted is unique, I will be able to provide an estimate for completion of edits once a word count and editing service is decided upon. Usual turnaround times generally varies between 2-8 weeks.\n\n-Confidentiality\n\nWhile I do not personally offer any documentation that guarantees the privacy and confidentiality of a client’s work, I am generally more than happy to agree to any Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or similar document that a client provides.\n\nSERVICES\n\nClick Headings Below For More Info!\n\n1) COACHING CONSULTATION:\n\nIf you are interested in learning about the concept of writing, the process of writing a full novel, what to look for when editing, or just generally improving your knowledge of storytelling and story structure, the Coaching Consultation is ideal for you. We can discuss any number of topics pertaining to writing in a friendly, laid-back manner.\n\nSome clients have even used the time to email me pieces of their work and go through specific sections of concern to be given feedback (like a live reading). Basically, the phone calls allow clients the opportunity to get a professional opinion about their literary work, weaknesses, and goals. In fact, many clients have told me it is the best service I offer. Calls can be handled either through cellular or internet communication.\n\nPricing: $30 for 30-minutes or $50 for 60 minutes.\n\n2) Manuscript RE-WRITE:\n\nIn some instances, a writer might want to gain insight into how to best continue with their manuscript by seeing it in its most polished form. In other cases, a writer simply might want a manuscript they finished to be reinterpreted and refined. The Manuscript Re-Write service is perfect for such writers.\n\nWith your guidance and direction, I will endeavor to rewrite either a piece, or the entirety, of your manuscript as best as I see fit. If you would like to see firsthand how I would approach the rewriting of your material, clients are welcome to submit three paragraphs from their manuscript and request them to be rewritten as a sample, free of charge. (Rewrites not available for scripts or comics)\n\nPricing: $65.00 per thousand words. 3,000 word minimum (equivalent to a $195.00 minimum)\n\nThe edits will be returned to you written out as a document in PDF form.\n\nYou are welcome to submit a manuscript under 3,000 words, however, you will still be charged the $195.00 minimum.\n\n3) MANUSCRIPT CONSULTATION:\n\nFor those clients looking for a professional opinion and critique of their work, this is the service for you. With this editing service, I will read through your submitted work, and then with an included 60-minute Coaching Consultation, discuss my criticisms, concerns, and praises of the manuscript. This consultation will include considerations of the plot structure, overall narrative, marketability, level of entertainment, and many other key factors.\n\nIt is also highly helpful that when a client submits their manuscript, they also provide a list of items for me to pay attention to/assess during my read through. Likewise, I recommend clients come to the included Coaching Consultation with questions prepared in order to get the most out of the discussion.\n\nNOTE: This Manuscript Consultation in its base form is best suited for polished manuscripts that do not need serious structural or internal changes. For those clients looking for a more comprehensive, written edit of their work, make sure to look through the Focuses service below.\n\nPricing: (The more you submit, the cheaper it becomes!)\n\nThe first 1000 - 10,000 words: $25.00 per thousand words. 5,000 word minimum (equivalent to a $125 minimum)\n\nThe next 10,000 - 50,000 words: $17.50 per thousand words\n\nThe next 50,000 - 100,000 words: 15.00 per thousand words\n\nAfter 100,000 words and above: $12.50 per thousand words\n\nClients who purchase this editing service are also able to add additional 30-minute segments to their Coaching Consultation for $25 each.\n\nAs an example, if a client were to submit 125,000 words, the breakdown would be as follows:\n\n** -$250** for the first 10,000 words ($25 rate x 10,000 words)\n\n** -$700** for the next 40,000 words ($17.50 rate x 40,000 words)\n\n-$750 for the next 50,000 words ($15.00 rate x 50,000 words)\n\n-$312.50 for the next 25,000 words ($12.50 rate x 25,000 words)\n\nTotalling: $2012.50 for all 125,000 words.\n\n4) Focuses:\n\nA client may choose a single or multiple focuses to go along with what is discussed in their purchased Manuscript Consultation. These Focuses will be detailed, written edits that specifically address the topic of the Focus and how it appears in your manuscript. Focuses are great for clients who know exactly what strengths and weaknesses they would like edited in their work. In this way, the editing service is tailor-made to target your areas of greatest desire, rather than aspects you may not be concerned about. This fosters a more precise editing experience and significantly faster turnaround.\n\nFor clients who do not know what strengths and/or weaknesses lie within their manuscript, and therefore have a difficult time choosing a Focus, you are more than welcome to submit 1000 words of your work so that I might suggest what Focus you should choose.\n\nPricing:\n\nDialogue Focus: 30% of the Manuscript Consultation cost\n\nProse and Voice Focus: 30% of the Manuscript Consultation cost\n\nExposition/Worldbuilding Focus: 25% of the Manuscript Consultation cost\n\nCharacter Development Focus: 25% of the Manuscript Consultation cost\n\nFight Scene Focus: 20% of the Manuscript Consultation cost\n\nExample: If the cost of your Manuscript Consultation is $500, adding on a Dialogue Focus will increase the cost by 30%, bringing the cost to $650. For the same $500 Manuscript Consultation, adding a Dialogue Focus and a Fight Scene Focus will increase the cast by 50%, bringing the cost $750.\n\nYou are welcome to add as many or as few Focuses to your Manuscript Consultation as you please.\n\n5)Proofreading\n\nWhere other options are more focused on narrative and larger scale edits, these options are specifically for those look for line by line, word by word edits on their manuscript.\n\nWith the proofreading service, you will be provided with a comprehensive check of grammar, punctuations, mispellings, and syntax throghout the whole of your manuscript. Keep in mind, this service is for manuscripts that are narratively polished and complete. With the proofreading service, you will be left with a manuscript that is submission ready!\n\n(NOTE: THIS SERVICE CAN BE BUNDLED WITH LINE-TEDITING FOR A DISCOUNT. CONTINUE READING FOR DETAILS)\n\nProofreading Pricing\n\nThe first 1000 - 10,000 words: $6:50 per thousand words. 5,000 word minimum charge (equivalent to a $32.50 minimum)\n\nThe next 10,000 - 50,000 words: $4:50 per thousand words\n\nThe next 50,000 - 100,000 words: $3.50 per thousand words\n\nAfter 100,000 words and above: $3.00 per thousand words\n\n6)Line-editing\n\nThis service provides the most traditional form editing with attention to line by line changes. Here, we will look to improve your prose and dialogue through word choice, sentence lenght, pacing, theme, and much more. the line-editing service is perfect for clients who wish to have their manuscript polished. Keep in mind, though, line-edits are not meant to address narrative problems. Please be directed to the Manuscript Consultation for that.\n\nLine-editing Pricing\n\nThe first 1000 - 10,000 words: $18.50 per thousand words. 5,000 word minimum charge (equivalent to a $92.50 minimum)\n\nThe next 10,000 - 50,000 words: $13.00 per thousand words\n\nThe next 50,000 - 100,000 words: $11.00 per thousand words\n\nAfter 100,000 words and above: $9.50 per thousand words\n\nLine-editing and Proofreading Bundle\n\nFor those clients who feel they need both, these services can be purchased together at a discounted rate!\n\nThe first 1000 - 10,000 words: $21.50 per thousand words. 5,000 word minimum charge (equivalent to a $107.50 minimum)\n\nThe next 10,000 - 50,000 words: $15.00 per thousand words\n\nThe next 50,000 - 100,000 words: $13.00 per thousand words\n\nAfter 100,000 words and above: $11 per thousand words"
