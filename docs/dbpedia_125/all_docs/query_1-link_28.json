        "text": "The last few days almost broke me. I’ve NEVER fought before. To go from knowing everything in the weight room, to knowing nothing in the ring… It’s like asking Messi to slam dunk. You might be there a while 🤣 (And yes, I just compared myself to the 🐐 of football) As I turned my alarm off at 7am, all cosy and warm in my bed… I almost convinced myself I wasn’t well enough to train today. Almost 🤏 It’s funny the mental gymnastics your brain will perform to try and get out of uncomfortable situations. Fortunately, 8+ years of gymming has helped build a mental wall of resilience. Without that wall, I would’ve crumbled today. Before you can see progress in ANYTHING… You NEED to master your mind. This applies to all aspects of life; - Choosing healthy food over junk food - Getting yourself into the gym - Saying no to after work drinks - Getting pounded by professional fighters You know what needs to be done. No one else is going to do it for you. You have the power to bend reality to your will. If you say you can, you CAN. You’ve got this 💪🏻 - (Want to follow my Muay Thai journey day by day? Follow my Instagram - @jmbfitness__ Link in bio! 📸) #muaythai #fitnessmotivation #fitness #fitnessjourney\n\n🥊💻 As a tech-founder, I recently decided to diversify my fitness routine by joining a Muay Thai gym. For those unfamiliar, Muay Thai, also known as Thai boxing, is a combat sport that utilizes stand-up striking and various clinching techniques. What struck me was the diversity of the trainees - gender, size, or stature didn't matter. Here's why I believe joining a fighting gym is beneficial to you: 1️⃣ Stress relief: The training acts as a reset button, reducing stress and anxiety levels to zero. 2️⃣ Confidence boost: It teaches you about your body's limits, enhancing self-confidence. 3️⃣ Comprehensive exercise: It revealed my deficiencies in flexibility, cardiovascularity, and mental strength that weight training alone couldn't address. 4️⃣ Fun!!: Sparring is like a strategic game of chess, predicting and countering your partner's moves. However, it's important to note the risk of brain damage from repeated powerful blows to the head. Responsible supervision, proper equipment, and controlled sparring are crucial to mitigate this risk. #TechFounder #MuayThai #Fitness #StressRelief #ConfidenceBoost #Exercise #Fun\n\nI tried something new for the first time today, Muay Thai boxing. Stepping into the humid boxing gym, adrenaline pumped through my veins. It was time for my first-ever Muay Thai lesson. Back home, I regularly used exercise to manage the daily stresses and boost my mood. But taking classes in the birthplace of this sport felt special. As I learned basic punches, elbows, knees and kicks, I was fully immersed in the present moment. My mind couldn't wander to past worries. The demanding workout required total mental focus on proper technique. Thoughts about future stressors evaporated. Releasing pent-up energy through powerful strikes felt cathartic. Frustrations melted away with each sweaty combination. When the class finished, I felt mentally refreshed and accomplished. Using movement for emotional release works wonders. However, experiencing a new style of training in Thailand took it to the next level. The cultural immersion amplified the benefits. Stepping outside my comfort zone re-energised my outlook. While it was intimidating learning a new skill in a foreign language, putting myself out there boosted my confidence too. Whether you're travelling or at home, physical activity is medicine for the mind and soul. But variety and new challenges maximise results. Don't just go through the motions. Look for ways to inject energy into your fitness routine. You'll feel excitement along with the usual post-workout calm. Let's get creative in using movement to nourish mental health. I’m totally exhausted, but it was great fun. Looking forward to the next session. Mindcanyon - Mental Health In Your Workplace #mentalhealth #mentalhealthmatters\n\nEveryone has big plans...for next year. But why wait? Why not start today? It's November 28. We still have over a month left in 2023. This is a friendly reminder that you don't have to wait for next year to start building better habits. This month, I signed up at a Martial Arts gym in the neighbourhood. For now, I practice Boxing and Muay Thai. Maybe Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu soon, too. Think of the compounding effect. By the year's end, you'll already be at a different level. The truth is, there's no perfect time to start. The time is now. The time is always now. Got a book you want to read? → Start today. Want to learn a new skill? → Start this week. Need to improve your health? → Start right now. And if you fail or falter, don't worry! Just get back to it. Because the truth is, most people never even start. You're already ahead of the pack. Keep going. Stay consistent. Build the habit. Happy habit-building, friends! P.S. What new habit do you want to start?\n\nSo, what’s your “#1 thing” to release stress? Ali Reza Azmi always jog/play tennis in the morning, while Li Chong Lim always hit the gym after work at night. Work can be super overwhelming and stressful. We know, so It’s important to have an outlet to let it all out. Exercising is one of the best ways to so, it doesn’t really matter of what you do, it’s the process that matters. Taking a walk, practicing Muay Thai, playing badminton, or going to the gym — there are so many ways to work out that are fun and relaxing. We think the key is to find something you enjoy. Make time for yourself and take action. Start small, but stay consistent. Consistency is often overlooked. Keep it at a pace where you can consistently commit. There’s no point in overexerting yourself once, getting burnt out, and feeling discouraged. We are super curious, how do you release stress?\n\nI want to share at least 3 MENTAL benefits of boxing as a form of exercise and why I came to ❤️ it, because it made my head + body stronger: ✅BE PRESENT: 🥊 boxing makes you fully concentrate and switch off from the outside world. Is fast, furious and fun, leaving little room in your head for anything else. This focus can translate to your personal life: when you learn to channel your thoughts, you can tune out distractions and sources of stress. ✅ SELF CONFIDENCE: 🥊boxing can help to make you feel more powerful mentally and give you the fighting spirit to deal with any of life’s challenges. The mental skills that you will learn by boxing can also be used in your everyday life such as understanding your opponents and being able to stand for yourself can help you at work or in social situations. ✅STRESS RELIEF: 🥊boxing increases the production of endorphins, the neurotransmitters that create FEEL GOOD thoughts. It also helps to relieve muscle tension that can build up when you get stressed.
