        "text": "After nearly 17 years my time with Activision has come to an end. From being cherrypicked out of College by Neversoft working on Guitar Hero to being Associate Art Director leading the Vehicle Art team at Infinity Ward on Call of Duty. It was a wild adventure that took many twists and turns. Not only was I an artist, but I did some motion capture acting and stunts many years ago. We also scanned my body and face and used them in game for nearly every Call of Duty since 2017 in some shape or form. It has been an absolute pleasure to work on teams with some of the best, brightest and most creative in the industry. I have a lifetime of memories and stories to tell from my time in the game industry so far. Hanging from a metal I-Beam in the Neversoft mocap stage being a zero-gravity soldier. Having bloody makeup applied before sitting in a dome of a hundred cameras while making every goofy expression imaginable for facial animations. Photographing cars on fire and even firing off emails that the gist encompassed “Go buy this specific vehicle, scan it. Then I want you to light it on fire, scan it. Then I want you to drive that excavator over the burned-out husk, scan it.” My career thus far has ranged from being a wide-eyed intern sitting next to developers who created games that defined my teen years. To leading a large team of internal and external artists, spread out across the world where we raised the technical and artistic bar game after game. Working on COD has been a pleasure but also a very personal challenging time for me. My days at work trained me to know the difference when being shot at, where a hiss means it’s close and a snap/crack means you’re being directly shot at. I never expected that knowledge to kick into action, but on Oct 1st, 2017 in the first volleys of gunfire at the Las Vegas Massacre it sure did. There’s a lot to say about my experience working on Call of Duty since Vegas, but that’s better discussed another time. Maybe in a book or at a conference in the future. To my old co-workers who were instrumental in helping me through the tough days, I thank you for everything. Empathy and compassion go a long way and I won’t forget it. Just under 17 years, I’ve been privileged to work on and be credited in 15 shipped AAA games. This industry is incredibly small, and I know for a fair number of folks I’ve had the pleasure to work with, our paths will cross again. It’s time for me to take a step in a new and exciting direction. If you know of a studio that would benefit from my expertise, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I'm just beginning to apply to various studios that I would love to work with. • COD Modern Warfare 3 (2023) • COD Warzone 2 • COD Modern Warfare 2 (2022) • COD Warzone • COD Modern Warfare (2019) • COD Infinite Warfare • COD Advance Warfare • COD Ghosts • COD Black Ops 2 • Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock • Band Hero • Guitar Hero 5 • Guitar Hero Metallica • Guitar Hero World Tour • Guitar Hero Aerosmith"
