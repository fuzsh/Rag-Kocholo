        "text": "10.2K\n\nOne of the buzziest male mods these days is Walter Savage, the latest guy on the rise to answer our deep questions as we wind down the week. What was he like as a kid? How’d he spend his first paycheck as a mod? What’s his secret talent? Let’s get to it. Plus! Count how many times one of his answers pertains to food.\n\nHometown: North End Wilkes Barre, PA\n\nCurrent City: Manhattan\n\nInstagram: TheWalterSavage\n\nSingle/Married/Dating? Single\n\nNickname: Most of my friends and family call me Wally. I get the occasional Savage from time to time, but my favorite nickname is Walt; my Pop Pop used to call me that.\n\nWhat was your first modeling job ever? My first modeling job was for Treats Magazine with photographer Chiun Kai Shih, or Chunky, as everyone knows him. My first professional paid job was for the Ralph Lauren presentation/campaign.\n\nHow did you spend the money you made? I used half of it to put a down payment on an apartment, and the rest I gave to my mother. (Ed. Note: Awwwwwww…)\n\nWhere are we least likely to find you? McDonald’s\n\nWho are your best male model buddies? All of the Soul guys are pretty close, but the ones I hang out with he most are Tarik Kaljanac, Tyson Beckford, Brian Shimansky, Josh Truesdell, Kevin Johnson, and Deric Mickens.\n\nWhat would we be surprised to know about you? I have a degree in Forensic Chemistry.\n\nWhat’s your guilty pleasure? Are we talking about food? Definitely almond butter!\n\nWhat time do you wake up every day? What time do you typically go to bed? My internal clock is 9 a.m. and 2 a.m. I try to get to sleep by midnight, but I’m a night owl.\n\nWhat scares you? Deep, dark water. I hate that feeling you get when you don’t know what’s underneath you!\n\nWhat do you always eat? Bananas\n\nWhat was your best and worst subject in school? Math and economics.\n\nWhat kind of student were you in high school? I was a great student! I was loud and energetic, but I still got my work done. I loved studying and I’d always stay to 8th period to practice my math homework over with Ms. Macri, or to just get my work done in general. If I wasn’t studying, I was playing volleyball. I played football, too, but I loved volleyball and my team. Some of my favorite memories of my high school years was the time I spent with my volleyball team. I owe a lot to my coach, Mr. Lapinski, for developing my character on and off the court.\n\nWhat’s your least favorite food? Boring-ass salad.\n\nWhen are you in the best mood? When I make someone happy.\n\nWhen are you in the worst mood? When I’m hungry or as we call it “hangry.”\n\nWho do you admire most in the world? My grandfather\n\nAny secret talents? I can cut hair. My pop taught me at the age of 12.\n\nWhere do you travel to most? To my fridge. Kidding! When I have free time, I try to go home to see the family.\n\nWhat word do you say too much? YES\n\nWhere do you think you’ll retire? Alaska…Maybe\n\nWhat’s your favorite thing about being in fashion? The experience. I like the challenge of the fashion world. If it were so easy, every great-looking guy and girl would be supermodels! The art of becoming this ideal image is the beauty of it all. As my agent Jason Kanner says, it’s the return of the male supermodel.\n\nWho’s your favorite female model? Treveen Stewart.\n\nWhat advice would you give your 13 year old self? Keep being you, kid."
