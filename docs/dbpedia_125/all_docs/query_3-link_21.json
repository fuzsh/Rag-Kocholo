        "text": "The Henry Savage papers consists of writings, correspondence, and other papers relating to English author and editor Henry Savage. Writings feature printed versions of shorter works by Savage and several drafts. Printed versions of essays and reviews appear to have been assembled for possible publication as a collection or selection of writings. Other writings by Savage include drafts of a late work of reminiscences, \"Promenade picaresque,\" and page proofs for a work of verse entitled Winged phallus.\n\nSeries II. Correspondence includes correspondence with authors, booksellers, publishers, literary scholars, friends, and family. The Henry Savage Correspondence includes all incoming and outgoing letters between Savage and others. There are incoming letters from Armin Arnold, William Heinemann Ltd., Ren√© MacColl, Burns Singer, Wilfrid C. Thorley, and Colin Wilson, and outgoing letters to \"Bess\" Greville, Guy Rayne Savage (Henry's son), and Valentine Watts. Some letters to and from Guy Rayne Savage document his service as executor of his father's literary estate. Additional correspondents include Bertram Rota Ltd. and E. L. McAdam.\n\nOther Papers contains clippings, journals, photographs, printed material, and personal papers. The series features a run of 26 handwritten journals spanning three full decades from 1933 to 1963. A photograph album and photographs contain images of Savage, family, and unidentified others.\n\nCollection material is chiefly in English; with some materials in Spanish."
