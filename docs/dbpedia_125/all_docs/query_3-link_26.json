I much preferred spending my time outdoors, climbing trees and digging my hands in the earth. Reading was a punishment for me. If I got in trouble, I’d have to sit at my mom’s desk and read 20 pages aloud from a book of her choosing. These were never fun books, either--nothing like Percy Jackson or Inkheart. Things changed for me in the fifth grade when I found the first book I ever loved and read by choice—The Tale of Despereaux. It wasn’t until two years later, when I read Inkheart for the first time, that I truly fell in love with reading. I haven’t looked back since.\n\nIn my free time, I enjoy writing, reading, rewatching comfort movies, and hanging out with my dogs.\n\nAt work, I edit. I specialize in fantasy, contemporary fiction, and literary fiction for both YA and adult audiences. I provide an array of services including developmental and structural editing, copy editing, line editing, proofreading, and tutoring. I studied creative writing at Full Sail University and hold several certifications in both editing and proofreading.\n\nContact:\n\nhttp://msavageediting.wixsite.com/msavageediting"
