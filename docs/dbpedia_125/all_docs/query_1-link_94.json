        "text": "Nicki Minaj and 21 Savage will reportedly be playable characters in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone 2.\n\nAccording to renowned data miner HeyImAlaix, the rap stars will be operators in the game’s upcoming Season 5 update.\n\n“21 Savage & Nicki Minaj are supposedly coming to MWII/WZ2,” he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday (July 12).\n\nIn response to a follower who speculated that Nicki and 21 could team up for a Call of Duty-exclusive song, Alaix confirmed that they’d be “100 percent” in the game as operators.\n\nWith the Season 4 update going live earlier this month, Season 5 isn’t expected to arrive until August 9 and fans’ eyes will be peeled to see if the “No Flag” collaborators will indeed be involved.\n\nNicki Minaj is no stranger to the Call of Duty universe as she appeared in a commercial for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 alongside Lil Baby and Pete Davidson last year.\n\nNicki and 21 won’t be the first Hip Hop stars to appear in Call of Duty as Snoop Dogg became a playable operator in April 2022.\n\n“The D O Double G is back in Call of Duty and this time I’m in the freakin’ game,” Snoop wrote on Instagram at the time. “Excited to be working with the COD team to bring some fly features for you all to enjoy. It’s dope….. y’all can play as me and get these sick items that have Snoop written all over them.”\n\nWhile there are no plans to add them to the game yet, Lil Uzi Vert is also a huge Call of Duty fan and recently invited Narduar to their house for a crash course in COD during their recent interview.\n\n“You could just come to my house and have dinner,” Uzi told the Human Serviette. “I’ll give you my number, and then I can teach you how to play Call of Duty.”\n\nUzi previously plugged the first-person shooter while on the red carpet at the 2023 Grammy Awards in February, saying that after the show they planned to simply go home and play video games.\n\n“Actually I’m probably just gonna go in the crib and play some video games,” he told a reporter. “Eat some Pop Tarts, Gushers. I’ve been playing a lot of COD. I got some friends on COD that I’ve been connecting with. I’ve been playing a lot of COD. I just got back on Fortnite.”\n\nHe also shared his Xbox gamertag, saying: “My username is UziiiiiiiPink — like seven I’s, though.”"
