        "text": "It was nine o’clock in the morning on Super Bowl Sunday when brand strategist Tammy Brook got the call: Her client, She’yaa “21 Savage” Bin Abraham-Joseph, had been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. As it turned out, the Atlanta-based hip-hop star was actually a U.K. citizen who’d come to the U.S. as a minor and had overstayed his visa.\n\nBrook quickly went to work quarterbacking a response, coordinating a coalition of social justice groups with 21’s management and legal teams. First, they aimed to reclaim his narrative—the ICE episode initially spawned scores of cheeky posts about the 26-year-old rapper's heritage—and second, they wanted to raise awareness of the 30 Under 30 alum’s status as a Dreamer, hoping a groundswell of public support could help get him released. And it did, after nine harrowing days.\n\n“I really appreciate all of the coalition coming together on my behalf to fight for me,” 21 Savage tells Forbes via electronic message. “It's rare to meet people who don't want anything from you other than to help you.”\n\nHis release was far from a given, and that coalition—to be sure, one whose scale certainly isn’t available to the average detainee—showed one way of countering aggressive immigration enforcement in the current climate. Some of the most prominent names in the social justice world were involved. Shortly after the news of 21's detention broke, Brook received a call from the office of her client Patrisse Cullors, cofounder of Black Lives Matter, and started texting with Alida Garcia, vice president of FWD.us (the immigrant advocacy outfit founded by Mark Zuckerberg). By the following morning, the groups backing 21 Savage swelled to include UndocuBlack, Define American, United We Dream and the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, in addition to Black Lives Mater.\n\nMany of Brook's contacts came from working with the Obama administration's Office of Public Engagement, and now she had aligned with them on a different sort of call to action. The coalition helped circulate graphics on 21's situation and get them into the hands of influential figures with massive social followings. Within 48 hours, celebrities from Cardi B to Jay-Z were raising awareness for 21’s cause; the latter even hired another lawyer, Alex Spiro, for 21's team. Cullors, meanwhile, started a petition on Color of Change that quickly racked up hundreds of thousands of signatures thanks to the coalition's social amplification.\n\n“The conversation was: He's been detained wrongfully, and we are hoping to quickly resolve this,” says Brook. “We are hoping that this will be swift, and if it's not, then we're going to have a very long road ahead of us.”\n\nAs the coalition mobilized mainstream support for 21 Savage, who has lived in Atlanta for two decades and has three children in the area, his growing team of lawyers plugged away on the legal side. Veteran Los Angeles attorney Dina LaPolt had already been working with a local immigration lawyer in Atlanta, and she brought in reinforcements in the form of another attorney, Charles Kuck, to help run operations on the ground.\n\n21 Savage already had what’s known as a U visa pending. According to his team, ICE was aware of his status and hadn’t tried to detain him—until he made an appearance on Jimmy Fallon’s show in early February, performing his song “A Lot” with a new verse that took shots at U.S. immigration policy. He was pulled over driving home from a concert in Atlanta less than a week later; Kuck says 21 overheard an officer say “We got him” as the rapper was transferred to an ICE vehicle.\n\n“You don’t have to have probable cause to detain somebody,” says LaPolt. “That's the problem with these immigration laws. They're terrible … if I'm a local law enforcement agency and I don't like what you're driving, your car looks better than mine, I don't like your music, I don't like what you stand for, I'm just going to call ICE and pull you over.”\n\nAccording to Kuck, ICE agents told 21 he’d be deported over a prior drug conviction, despite the rapper’s protests that the crime had been vacated—expunged from his record—and therefore wasn’t grounds for deportation (an ICE spokesperson declined to comment on the matter). Kuck and the legal team made a similar argument in the days following the Super Bowl, but the rapper remained in custody.\n\nOnce 21’s co-manager Kei Henderson figured out where he was being held, she drove with 21's mother and legal team to the facility, four hours from Atlanta—it “looked like a jail,” she says—for a visit. Henderson wasn’t allowed in; she had to wait in the car while the others spoke with 21. The rapper’s mother focused on keeping him in a positive mindset while the legal team talked over the state of his case, hoping to get him out ahead of a planned performance at the Grammys. That didn't seem to move the authorities.\n\n“On Friday, they made a final decision—which they apparently made in headquarters at ICE—not to release him,” says Kuck. “We found that out like six o’clock on a Friday night. So at that point, there's nothing we can do, and during that week, there was no hearing.”\n\nWith 21 Savage still in detention, he couldn’t perform “Rockstar,” his duet with Post Malone that was up for Record of the Year and Best Rap/Sung Performance. Yet it seemed the Grammys could be another opportunity to raise awareness, and Brook organized a public service announcement called “21 Ways You Could Be Detained If You’re Undocumented In America” ahead of the ceremony, featuring musicians from Kendrick Lamar to DJ Khaled—and a call to sign the Color of Change petition.\n\n“At first I was like, ‘Are these [petitions] really important?’” Henderson recalls asking the coalition’s members. “But … they humanized immigration because it was like, ‘Oh, anyone can be detained. Even someone as big as 21 Savage.’”\n\nOutside of a peaceful protest at the Grammy Museum, though, music’s biggest night could have been bigger for 21. Post Malone performed “Rockstar,” but his 21 Savage shirt wasn’t visible on the telecast. 21’s co-manager said his team was only given tickets last-minute and didn’t attend. Neither did Donald Glover, who won Song of the Year for “This Is America,” another track on which 21 appeared (albeit briefly). The most prominent mention came from Glover's cowriter, Ludwig Göransson, who said “21 Savage should be here right now” while being played off the stage.\n\nThe ongoing grassroots push behind 21 would prove more potent than the Grammys. Shortly after the ceremony, with 21 Savage still in detention, dozens of cardboard file boxes filled with some 450,000 Color of Change petition signatures were delivered to ICE’s Atlanta headquarters while protesters, including 21 Savage’s team and scores of fans, rallied through a downpour.\n\n“That was incredibly important because it was not just about the petition-gathering, but it was also about getting more awareness out about what was happening to 21,” says Black Lives Matters’ Cullors. “And getting more awareness out about what's happening with black immigrants and the history of criminalizing black people … black immigrants are criminalized two times, both by their immigration status and because of racial injustice.”\n\nAt the same time, Kuck and the legal team went back to work, discovering that 21 had been set for a bond hearing the Tuesday after the Grammys. When they showed up, they received relatively good news: The judge agreed to set a bail bond—fairly high, at $100,000—but one that 21, richer than most detainees, was able to pay. He was released after nine days in custody, buoyed by the help of a coalition with a scope unheard of for just about anyone in his position.\n\n21’s case is still pending; given the state of U.S. immigration courts, it could languish for months or years. He has emerged from detention as something of a cause célèbre in the entertainment industry, and one of the more high-profile Dreamers in the country. So why didn’t he just come out and publicly declare his immigration status earlier on? Brook believes he knew his paperwork was pending and trusted the process.\n\n“I think he was just trying to do everything privately,” says Brook, who with her firm FYI Brand Group recently helped 21 launch Bank Account, a financial literacy campaign for teens. “It's a blessing if this all shakes out and he's this free Dreamer that can stay in America and be with his children and be in the only country he knows.”\n\nFor now, 21 Savage is free—sort of. Though he can move about the United States, he can’t travel abroad, limiting his earning opportunities. He has resumed playing gigs, with an average nightly gross sitting north of $50,000, according to Pollstar; his paychecks for large festivals like Lollapalooza, where he’s scheduled to play in August, are likely much higher.\n\nIn any case, 21 feels the entire episode may have been worthwhile because of the attention it called to others in his position, the sort of detainees who can’t pay a $100,000 bond or spark the mobilization of activists and celebrities in droves.\n\n“I'm hopeful that some things will actually change,” says 21. “Not just for me but for everyone in my shoes. It's all about wanting a better life, we should all be entitled to seek that.”"
