Otherwise, thank you SO much for all your questions and support, and I hope to see some of you in person at Brain Candy Live or one of the upcoming comic-cons! In the meantime, take a listen to the podcasts I just did for Syfy, and let me know on Twitter (@donttrythis) what you think: http://www.syfy.com/tags/origin-stories\n\nThanks, everyone!\n\nORIGINAL TEXT: Since MythBusters stopped filming two years ago (right?!) I've logged almost 175,000 flight miles and visited and filmed on the sets of multiple blockbuster films (including Ghost in the Shell, Alien Covenant, The Expanse, Blade Runner), AND built a bucket list suit of armor to cosplay in (in England!). I also launched a live stage show called Brain Candy with Vsauce's Michael Stevens and a Maker Tour series on Tested.com.\n\nAnd then of course I just released 15 podcast interviews with some of your FAVORITE figures from science fiction, including Neil Gaiman, Kevin Smith and Jonathan Frakes, for Syfy.\n\nBut enough about me. It's time for you to talk about what's on YOUR mind. Go for it."
