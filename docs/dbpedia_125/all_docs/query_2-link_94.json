        "text": "New Oklahoma license plate left off some key 'icons'\n\nThe word “iconic” can be used to describe many great things. To be an icon is to be the purest form of representation; a condensation of a given subject’s elements into a single image. Branded as “Iconic,” the new Oklahoma license plate could be described as just that, or perhaps it could be described as something else.\n\nLawsuit: Behenna violated Open Records Act after police-shooting case dismissals\n\nIn the fast lane of the American news highway, it’s easier than ever to pass the big stories of yesterday in pursuit of the next nightmare coming down the road. In late 2020, mere months after protests about police violence and accountability erupted across America, a pair of deadly law enforcement encounters played out like bad dreams in Oklahoma City. OKCPD officers shot and killed 17-year-old Stavian Rodriguez on Nov.\n\nWhen DA Vicki Behenna refused to release her contract with a use-of-force expert she hired to review 3 police-shooting cases, it raised a red flag. Now we're headed to court for the contract and reports, which were partially disclosed in a press release. https://nondoc.com/2024/08/05/lawsuit-behenna-violated-open-records-act-after-police-shooting-case-dismissals/ …"
