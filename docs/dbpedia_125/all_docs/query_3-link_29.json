        "text": "The March 2020 issue included a special section on the anthropology of global white supremacy, which contained an article by Junaid Rana about Margaret Mead’s conversation with James Baldwin called “A Rap on Race.” We chose an image that would critically reflect on that essay in order to show that despite the anti-racism of Boasian anthropology, and especially of such a public figure like Margaret Mead, she participated in the very racist practices that she was decrying. Within the context of the issue, we felt it made sense for us to use that cover. Of course, we recognized the image was racist; our intention was to call attention to that very fact.\n\nI should admit I didn’t realize that the skulls in that image were actually skulls. I thought they were reproductions or masks, as did the editors of the special section. I didn’t mention this in my original statement because I didn’t want to claim ignorance as a way of absolving myself of responsibility. But if anything, that lack of knowledge is just a further instantiation of how saturated our discipline is with the logics of white supremacy that the special issue is actually attempting to tackle. I realize that not knowing what was depicted in the image, I should have gotten feedback from peers before making the decision to use the image, but I didn’t, and that was a mistake.\n\nOnce we realized the problem, we removed the cover from our website, and it will soon be removed entirely from the Wiley page. Also, in my September 2020 editor’s remarks there will be a statement and a permanent record in the journal of the change that was made and why.\n\nYB: Someone on Twitter remarked that the violence caused by that image was similar to that caused when images of Black bodies are circulated, whether its lynching photographs or viral videos of Black women and men killed by the police. And I do think there’s something to that in the sense that there is a kind of trauma that is produced and triggered by seeing these images, even when they’re put out with a clear political intent. So I think there’s a lesson to be drawn from this about how to do anti-racist work with images, and how those images need to be contextualized, how they should be manipulated and altered, and to think about how they function not just in the analog world, but in the digital world where they can go viral in so many different ways.\n\nDT: I think that’s true. I think often images are put to good use in terms of witnessing. But I don’t think this image did that. So, I recognize that this does not serve that purpose. I wouldn’t make an argument that this was meant to witness. It was more to instantiate the history of anthropology as a racist history\n\nYB: So, one of my friends wanted me to ask you: What’s it like to fuck up as a woman of color?\n\nDT: Well, I think the stakes are higher in some ways because, you know, if I think of how I’ve responded to people’s mistakes or people’s apologies when it involves white men— to some extent there’s a greater expectation that it will happen, but when it’s a person of color, people feel you should know better, and in that sense it hurts more. There is very little margin for error.\n\nYB: As part of the board of AA, part of what I found so upsetting about this moment was that this was one of the most powerful issues ever put out by the journal, with the section on white supremacy and your own editorial statement about reparations. And the issue also comes near the end of your tenure as editor, where you have not only brought issues of racial inequality and white supremacy to the pages of the journal, but also on the back end you have worked so hard to diversify the board in terms of race, gender, generation, institutional and geographic location, etcetera. You have consciously attempted to make long term institutional change.\n\nDT: Yeah, I mean, institutions don’t change until new people come into them. And so part of my goal as the first nonwhite editor of this journal was to try to transform it—not to decolonize it in that simple metaphorical way, but to actually transform the people who were at the table, the shape of the issues, the reach of the issues. And it’s upsetting that the outrage over the cover, justified as it is, erases a lot of that work that everybody on the board has done.\n\nYB: Well, it seems like this could be an opportunity to think more about the constitutive relationship between anti-Blackness and Native dispossession and how white supremacy is founded not just on anti-Blackness but also on anti-Indigeneity. Anthropology, in particular, as the savage slot, is the discipline most profoundly rooted in the dehumanization and objectification of Indigenous people, and that is something that needs to be brought to bear in debates about anti-Blackness and white supremacy. I think there’s still a chance for us to use this moment to open that dialogue and to connect it to the conversation that the white supremacy issue was trying to generate.\n\nDT: Yeah, I think that those conversations about anti-Black racism, Native dispossession, and decolonization rarely come together, and this is something I’m often encouraging my graduate students to do. I think just now there’s a scholarship that’s trying to do some of that work, like Tiffany Lethabo King’s The Black Shoals, or Shanya Cordis, who has recently published an essay called “Settler Unfreedoms” in the American Indian Culture and Research Journal. And then there was the “Culture at Large” session during last year’s AAA on (anti)Blackness and (anti)Indigeneity with Christina Sharpe. Obviously, activists have been thinking together about this for a long time. And in fact, over the last couple years we’ve been planning a conference that will happen next fall at the Penn Museum called “Settler Colonialism, Slavery, and the Problem of Decolonizing Museums.” Through that conference, we are trying to bring together the conversations about NAGPRA (The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act) and other agreements about the repatriation and use of Native materials, and the conversations about imperialism and slavery that are happening somewhat more robustly in European and South African contexts. I think more of these kinds of conversations will be important. And Twitter is not necessarily the space where they can be had.\n\nYB: Well, you know I love Twitter; I’ve written about it and I see a lot of value in it. I realize that there can be moments where it can become a performative space— a lot has been written about “virtue signaling,” for example—and I know that the kind of slow, careful, and invisible labor of diversifying the discipline is not what goes viral or gets retweeted. But, as I’ve written about in the past, I do think it can be an extremely important platform to make political claims that are hard to denounce in an institutional space. I’m thinking, for example, of the controversies around HAU, and how Twitter created a space to have a conversation that was simply impossible in other arenas. It can have a significant impact. But in this instance, I picked up the phone, I texted you and said let’s talk about this because there are things that require dialogue and careful engagement, and in some ways Twitter is most powerful when it serves as a catalyst for conversations and engagement beyond its platform. Twitter is both the best and the worst of the public sphere: it can provide a space for critique—and in many ways made this very conversation possible—but it can also dehumanize the target of critique. And it has been widely shown that this is especially true for women, and particularly for women of color.\n\nDT: I don’t use much social media. I’m not going to say it’s generational because many of my friends are experts at it and use it in many different kinds of ways, but it’s just not my preferred medium for interaction. Yet, I see how it can be very positive and useful. Obviously, it brought this to a broader audience and has started a conversation in a way that would not have otherwise happened. However, I do wonder sometimes why people who were originally raising concerns that were then brought to my attention didn’t feel they could just email me directly. I think it’s great that Twitter has really raised the profile of the problem in a way where we can actually understand better what the mistakes were and how to make amends for them.\n\nYB: Yes, and it’s true that most folks weren’t really evaluating this in relationship to your work as editor or the work you’ve done over your career, but rather in relationship to the history of AA and the history of the discipline. Because the fact is, when one sees that image on the cover of AA it’s easy to assume that it was meant as a very earnest representation of what the discipline is. . .\n\nDT: And that has been the case in the past.\n\nYB: Absolutely. And precisely what you were trying to do was to get us to think more critically about these canonical figures that are so often celebrated. With Margaret Mead, specifically, I mean, there’s still a ton of prizes in her name. There are probably lecture halls. . .\n\nDT: Film festivals. . ."
