        "text": "James Savage, O.D., is a trusted and experienced optometrist at Maine Optometry. He brings decades of experience with him, no matter if he’s following up with a primary eye care appointment or helping patients find their perfect prescription.\n\nDr. Savage obtained his Bachelor of Arts in zoology from the University of Maine. He then earned his Doctor of Optometry at the New England College of Optometry. After earning his degree, he returned to Maine to practice with Dr. Will Hamilton — the father of our very own Dr. Todd Hamilton — for several decades. Additionally, Dr. Savage has served on the Maine State Board of Optometry, and the board of the Maine Optometric Association.\n\nDr. Savage was born and raised in Caribou, Maine, and graduated from Caribou High School. Recently, he and his wife moved to southern Maine to be closer to family. When he’s not working with patients, you can find Dr. Savage enjoying the outdoors by biking, hiking, and exploring the beaches, forests, and lakes with his grandchildren."
