        "text": "The new Hulu series Tell Me Lies follows a tumultuous but intoxicating relationship as it unfolds over the course of eight years. When Lucy Albright and Stephen DeMarco meet at college, they are at that formative age when seemingly mundane choices lead the way to irrevocable consequences. Although their relationship begins like any typical campus romance, they quickly fall into an addictive entanglement that will permanently alter not only their lives, but the lives of everyone around them. The series — which premiered last month — stars Grace Van Patten, Jackson White, Branden Cook, Sonia Mena, Catherine Missal, Benjamin Wadsworth, Spencer House and Alicia Crowder.\n\nMeaghan Oppenheimer serves as executive producer and showrunner of Tell Me Lies. Emma Roberts and Karah Preiss executive produce under their Belletrist Productions banner along with Matt Matruski, Laura Lewis and Stephanie Noonan, who executive produce for Rebelle Media, and VICE Studios’ Shannon Gibson and Sam Schlaifer who executive produce for Vice-owned Refinery29. Jonathan Levine also serves as executive producer and pilot director. Adapted from author Carola Lovering’s novel of the same name, Lovering also serves as a consulting producer for the series.\n\nOn October 11, 2022, I had the pleasure of speaking with Tell Me Lies star Grace Van Patten via Zoom, as embedded below along with interviews I recently conducted with producers Meaghan Oppenheimer, Emma Roberts and Karah Preiss. More on the series can be found here and here.\n\nTweet"
