        "text": "Uninstalling EAC is quite forward: Usually EAC lists itself under Start, All Programs in a folder called Exact Audio Copy. In that folder there is an entry called Uninstall. Click on this entry and follow the dialogs that are shown on the screen, confirm that you really want to uninstall EAC from your computer.\n\nIf you don’t have any start menu entry for EAC (or can’t find it), for Windows XP go to Start, Control Panel and then double click Add or Remove Programs. For Windows Vista go to Start, Control Panel and then click Programs and Features. In the Currently installed programs box, choose “Exact Audio Copy” and press the Change or Change/Remove button. Follow the dialogs that are shown on the screen, confirm that you really want to uninstall EAC from your computer.\n\nYes, but not using EAC and though it’s more manual work. For an unprotected DVD, the only hardware you will need is a DVD drive and a software to demultiplex the VOB files into the audio streams (usually compressed in AC3 or DTS). Then you need a programm to decompress these compressed files (a AC3 decompressor or a DTS decompressor).\n\n“Real” Audio DVDs and SACD have a compression scheme that is not yet by software decodeable (MLP from Audio DVDs should be playable with some Creative hardware though).\n\nMake sure you start EAC from an admin account, as some functions need a to access low level system routines, which are not accessable from user accounts. If you use the “Native SCSI Interface”, try the “ASPI Interface” instead, perhaps it will already help.\n\nA user send this suggestion, feel free to try it out :\n\nIn administrator mode, Start, Run, MMC\n\nConsole Menu, Add/Remove Snap-in\n\nAdd.\n\nGroup Policy\n\n(Group Policy will be shown as “Local Computer Policy”. Actually, if your computer receives its policies from a network server, it won’t show and you’ll have to set it directly on the server, ask your admin then. )\n\nOk\n\nOn the tree, Console Root, Local Computer Policy, Computer Configuration, Windows Settings, Security Settings, Local Policies, Security Options\n\nFind “Restrict CD-ROM access to locally logged-on user only”. It should be disabled by default. Enable it.\n\nNo need to reboot, when quitting MMC, no need to save.\n\nWhat this does is allow any local software to lock the drive for exclusive use. What this removes is the ability to use the CD-Rom as a Terminal Services client. With this, EAC works seamlessly. It also makes it possible to use a CD-Writer as restricted user with whatever software you choose.\n\nEAC needs a driver called “ASPI”, it is an SCSI driver, but works also with IDE CD-ROM drives (not a single file, but a complete package, so installing just the DLL won’t help). It is included in Win95/98, but not in Windows NT/2000. The newer versions of EAC should not absolute need ASPI anymore, but ASPI would be nevertheless the most stable. ASPI is available from different manufacturers (of SCSI interface cards), but it seems that the only working one with EAC is coming from Adaptec.\n\nFirst of all you should upgrade to a newer version of EAC, as ASPI is not absolutely necessary any more.\n\nEAC communicates directly with the CD-ROM drives. For this EAC make use of several interfaces which do the low level work. You can choose the interface by your own in the EAC options (depending which interfaces are installed in your computer).\n\nASPI is from Adaptec, it comes preinstalled in Win95/98. In all other Windows it needs to be installed, but in these OS the installer tests if any Adaptec hardware is in your computer. Nevertheless you can try to install it, download for Windows 95 only and all other windows versions.\n\nVOB produced a replacement called ASAPI. It is freely available from here.\n\nIn WinNT/2000/XP EAC is able to use a native interface in that OS. This is still buggy and only recommended when you don’t want to install 3rd party software. Nevertheless, this will only work if you are logged in with admin rights. If you encounter problems, it is strongly recommended to download ASAPI and to change the interface to that.\n\nIt is possible also to extract copy protected tracks, as the copy protection is only a flag on the CD, and all CD-ROM drives will ignore it on reading. Some month ago there are now also real copy protections for audio CDs, but this information is not given in the table. If there is such a CD, it will show garbage, not extract tracks or probably insert errors in the extraction.\n\n700 MB is the storage space for data CDs. Data has a third layer of error correction which need more storage space. So sector size is 2048 bytes for data and 2352 bytes for audio. There are around 360000 sectors on a 700 MB CD-R, that is 737280000 bytes = 703 MB for data sectors. On audio CDs this is 846720000 bytes = 807 MB. This is why the files are too big to write them as data files, but it should be possible to write them as audio CD instead.\n\nSometimes EAC will autodetect a wrong read command. Try to manually select a read command. In the Drive Options, go to Read Commands page and select the Read Command MMC1 manually (or any other that works). Test it with burst mode. If you tested all of them, but none of them worked, try to extract with another program like WinDAC or CDEx. If both also fails, make sure that your drive is capable of extracting digital audio at all.\n\nSometimes EAC will autodetect a wrong read command. In this case it is possible that only silence is returned. Try to manually select a read command. In the Drive Options, go to Read Commands page and select the Read Command MMC1 manually (or any other that works). Test it with burst mode. If you tested all of them, but none of them worked, try to extract with another program like WinDAC or CDEx. If both also fails, make sure that your drive is capable of extracting digital audio at all.\n\nUsually this error occurs when not using the ASPI interface of Adaptec. So try at first to install it on your computer. When you use Windows NT/2000, the native SCSI interface could also make some problems, so also install the Adaptec interface in that case.\n\nSecond, it has also happened that an illegal audio codec let EAC crash on enumerating all audio codecs. In that case try to disable (not deinstall) each codec and try again, you could enable the codecs then again piece for piece to find out which one causes the problem. Mainly some versions of LAME and OggVorbis ACM codecs cause this behaviour (included in e.g. Nimo Codec Pack).\n\nThis mode is the oldest read mode in EAC, it exists from version 0.1b on. It will read every sector twice, but in very small blocks. This will slow down extraction, no drive features are used. If the drive does caching the option below should be activated, but this could create problems on some drives. This mode is stressing the drive very much and should not be used, if one of the other secure modes works ok. The “disable CD-ROM drive cache” will disable the drive cache when using Paranoid mode, by resetting the drive after a read command. On some drives this will take several seconds and should not be used in that case.\n\nIf you don’t like to use the secure modes, and the burst mode does not have error correction, the best possibility to check if an error occured is to copy and test the track. For each read and each track, the appropriate CRC column is filled with the actual CRC code. One CRC code is unique for a set of data. So by comparing the CRC values you could be quite sure that both reads resulted in the same file.\n\nOn all CD-ROM media are at least two levels of error correction, called C1 and C2. If both fail, the output is probably not correct anymore. Most drives are not able to report if audio reads failed or not, so each block had to be read twice and be compared to make sure that everything is fine. But some newer drives are able to report if C1/C2 failed on specific samples on a read, making it possible to read only once and see if a read error occured. But there is still a problem, as some drives do not report these errors correctly, so you should test it thoroughly before trusting the results.\n\nWhen you get 99.7% and so on, that means that a bad sector was found, but the secure mode has corrected it – from 16 times of grabbing the sector, there were 8 or more identical results. So it only indicates read problems. It is the ratio between the number of minimum reads needed to perform the extraction and the number of reads that were actually performed. 100% will only occur when the CD was extracted without any rereads on errors. ONLY when there are suspicious positions reported, there are really uncorrectable read errors in the resulting audio file.\n\nEAC does not insert the gaps. These gaps are inserted by the writing program. There are two possibilities how these gaps could occur. Once if you write in TAO (Track At Once), there have to be a gap between tracks, so use DAO (Disc At Once) instead. Second, if you already use DAO, you should examine that program options, somewhere will be a flag where the standard 2 second gap could be deactivated.\n\nIf you have selected “Allow Speed Reduction” and the speed box also shows different possible speeds, then the problem lies within the reader. It could help to use the cool down feature (let it cool down every 15-30 min for several minutes, perhaps this already solves it). Otherwise don’t use the flag “Allow Speed Reduction”, but of course then it won’t read anymore that accurate on bad sectors.\n\nWhen finished extracting, EAC will tell you if there were errors in the extraction. If there were, when you click the “Possible Errors” button, it will give you a time range that the error occured in. If it doesn’t report errors, it will not have a range, you will be able only to choose the whole track and not the specific positions (as there are none).\n\nBest possibility would be to extract all tracks with a read offset of -5000 and then load each track into the EAC WAV editor and use “Remove leading and trailing silence”. Then you should be able again to write them without gaps. It would be possible to remove them also by offset correction and gap detection, but for that you would need and use the exact combined offset of the writer.\n\nThese are all different methods for retrieving the index markers (gaps, etc.). Some methods will work with some drives, the others won’t, you should test all of them which works best for you. None of them is by used method better or worse than the other, but by used method the A is the fastest one and C the slowest (if it works correctly!).\n\nOne of the biggest mistakes that could be made in 0.85beta (from 0.9beta3 on I prevented it automatically) is to have selected “Remove Leading And Trailing Silence”. If the image file contains silence at the beginning (e.g. 1 second) it will be removed and everything get moved by one second. So you should deactivate this option for 0.85b4. If this is not the problem, try a different gap detection mode and compare the generated CUE sheets manually.\n\nIt is still not known what causes this problem, there are Afreey users without any problems and some others have this problem. It is possible to continue the extraction by pressing the eject button on the drive. Try to play around a little bit with your options (DMA or deinstall busmaster drivers), probably it won’t help, but perhaps it does.\n\nFrom EAC version 1.0 beta 2 on, you can use the following placeholders in the filename settings on how filenames for tracks are being created by EAC:\n\n%title% – Track title\n\n%artist% – Track artist\n\n%composer% – Track composer\n\n%tracknr1% – Track number (at least 1 digit)\n\n%tracknr2% – Track number (at least 2 digits)\n\n%tracknr3% – Track number (at least 3 digits)\n\n%lengthmin% – Track duration (minutes part)\n\n%lengthsec% – Track duration (seconds part)\n\n%year% – Release year\n\n%albumtitle% – CD title\n\n%albumartist% – CD artist\n\n%albumcomposer% – CD composer\n\n%albuminterpret% – CD performer\n\n%comment% – CD comment\n\n%totalcds% – Number of CDs in a set\n\n%cdnumber% – Number of the CD within a set\n\n%numtracks% – Total number of tracks on the CD\n\n%genre% – ID3 music type\n\n%cddbid% – freedb ID\n\n%cddbtype% – freedb music type\n\n%% – The ‘%’ character\n\nAs an example, you could use\n\n(%tracknr2%) %title% – %artist%\n\nwhich would result in such a filename (as an example)\n\n(02) Nothing else matters – Metallica\n\nRemember that EAC does not supply a MP3 codec; you may use the LAME, Gogo or the BladeEnc DLL’s (or FAAC Dll for AAC compression) by copying them into the same directory where you copied EAC. Then you will be able to choose the installed DLLs in the compression option dialog box. Of course the quality of MP3 is based on the encoder and the bitrate you use. Beside the DLLs you could also specify external command line compressors that will be executed after an entire track was read (and not on-the-fly).\n\nThere are two groups of audio data, compressed and uncompressed data. The compressed group could also be splitted to lossless and lossy compression. Lossless compression is like having uncompressed data, only that the file is only around 70% of the uncompressed size (Comparable to compression with WinZIP). To the group of lossy compression also belongs MP3, it is not possible to recreate the original audio file 100%, there are frequencies missing, etc. Now, MP3 is ONE lossy compression format, there are others like AAC, MP2, TAC, etc. The nice side on WAVs is that it could be wrapped on any compression for which an audio codec exists in Windows. So if you own the Fraunhofer Codec (or the LAME/Blade/Gogo DLL) you could produce MP3-WAVs. These are standard MP3 files, but having a small header preceeding the actual data telling the player what codec to use for playing/decompression. So these files could be played with any media player or any other sound tool. As the header does not matter on MP3 compression, you could even rename the MP3-WAVs from .wav to .mp3 without loosing playability by a MP3 player.\n\nIt is short for “Variable Bitrate”. Some MP3 encoder support this. When enabled the compressor will use a bitrate that would fit the actual passage. If it is a very complex part it will use a quite high bitrate and e.g. on silence or easy parts it will use a lower bitrate. So usually the average bitrate will be not as high as a MP3 of same quality with constant bitrate.\n\nEAC will write WAVs when using codecs (EAC emulates a codec for the MP3 DLLs). This has the advantage that it will play with any media player, when any version of the Fraunhofer codec is installed (even the free one, called “advanced”). If you want “pure” MP3 files (without the WAV header in front of it), just select the option “Do not write WAV header” and specify the appropriate file extension below (“.mp3”).\n\nIn the field “Additional command line options” you could use replacements for the selectable options :\n\nFor versions before 1.0 beta 2\n\n%s – Source filename\n\n%d – Destination filename\n\n%h…%h – Text “…” only when “High quality” selected\n\n%l…%l -Text “…” only when “Low quality” selected\n\n%c…%c – Text “…” only when “CRC checksum” selected\n\n%j…%j – Text “…” only when storing cd cover is enabled\n\n%i – Filename of CD cover image\n\n%r – Bitrate (“32”..”320″)\n\n%e – Comment\n\n%a – Track artist\n\n%t – Track title\n\n%v – CD artist\n\n%g – CD title\n\n%y – Year\n\n%n – Track number\n\n%x – Number of tracks on album\n\n%m – MP3 music genre\n\n%o – Original filename (without temporary renaming)\n\n%e – Comment (as selected in EAC)\n\n%b – CRC of extracted track\n\n%f – freedb ID\n\nSo a command line would look like (for l3enc)\n\n%s %d -br %r000 %h-hq%h %c-crc%c\n\nFor versions from 1.0 beta 2 on (some placeholders might only be available in the latest version!)\n\n%source% – Source filename\n\n%dest% – Destination filename\n\n%original% – Original filename (without temporary renaming)\n\n%ishigh%…%ishigh% – Text “…” only when “High quality” selected\n\n%islow%…%islow% -Text “…” only when “Low quality” selected\n\n%haslyrics%…%haslyrics% – Text “…” only when lyrics exist\n\n%hascover%…%hascover% – Text “…” only when storing cd cover is enabled and cover exists\n\n%crcenabled%…%crcenabled% – Text “…” only when “CRC checksum” selected\n\n%title% – Track title\n\n%genre% – MP3 music genre\n\n%year% – Year\n\n%cddbid% – freedb ID\n\n%artist% – Track artist\n\n%lyrics% – Lyrics\n\n%lyricsfile% – Filename of lyrics text file (ANSI)\n\n%bitrate% – Bitrate (“32”..”320″)\n\n%comment% – Comment (as selected in EAC)\n\n%tracknr% – Track number (same as %tracknr2%)\n\n%tracknr1% – Track number (at least 1 digit)\n\n%tracknr2% – Track number (at least 2 digits)\n\n%tracknr3% – Track number (at least 3 digits)\n\n%totalcds% – Total number of CDs in the given CD set\n\n%cdnumber% – Number of the CD\n\n%composer% – Track performer\n\n%trackcrc% – CRC of extracted track\n\n%coverfile% – Filename of CD cover image\n\n%numtracks% – Number of tracks on album\n\n%albumtitle% – CD title\n\n%albumartist% – CD artist\n\n%albumcomposer% – CD composer\n\n%albuminterpret% – CD performer\n\n%% – The ‘%’ character\n\nSo a command line would look like (for l3enc)\n\n%source% %dest% -br %bitrate%000 %ishigh%-hq%ishigh% %crcenabled%-crc%crcenabled%\n\nThe extension can also be selected within these settings.\n\nThere is a test routine included in EAC that will determine the offset for a drive using a library of predefined commercial CDs. It is important that you use exactly the same pressing as the creator, otherwise another offset could be occured on remastering. So you should at least receive twice the same offset on two individual CDs. If you have a Plextor 40X CD-ROM drive (or know somebody who owns one), you could even help to extend that database of included offset CDs to help others to determine the offsets. If this does not bring a good result, the last option is to ask the other persons in the mailing list if anybody already determined the offset for the specific CD-ROM drive model.\n\nThe combined read/write offset is only valid for the special combination of exactly one reading drive and exactly one writing drive. If you use another reading, you would most probably need a different combined offset. To determine this offset, you would need to write a CD-R/CD-RW. At first prepare WAV files you want to write to the CD. Then write it to a CD (either with any burning program, or with EAC using write offset 0). Do not delete the written WAV files. Afterwards you have to extract one or more tracks from the freshly burned CD, using the specific reader and using read offset 0. Of course you should not overwrite the original WAV files. Now you have to use the WAV Compare feature in EAC to compare the first WAV (original) with the second (reextracted one). Usually EAC will report either missing samples or extreneous samples. The number that is reported by that will be your combined offset, only be changed to positive or negative. If your original file has extreneous (repeated) samples or the copied file has missing samples the offset should be positive, otherwise it should be negative. (I hope this is correct) To double check the found offset, use that offset as sample offset for reading. Now The reextracted file and the original should be the same without missing or extreneous samples.\n\nThis happen sometimes, when the writer starts loosing the ability to find the correct positions for writing and the actual gaps are not 100% on the correct positions. Usually this happens to Yamaha writers sooner or later. So try to lower the writing speed and try different CD-R media. But it is also possible that a writer is not able to write very short gaps, so make sure that in the CUE sheet each gap is bigger than at least 100 sectors (1 1/3 second).\n\nEAC does not support all writers yet, so it is possible that EAC just do not work correctly with that drive. Further it would be possible that something in your system will break the stream to the writer, resulting in a buffer underrun. Make sure that there are no other applications are running while writing.\n\nIf could try to switch the sync data transfer on for the writer, you could find that option in the Windows Device Manager (System Properties), there select the writer and show up and edit the properties of that drive.\n\nNormalization is used to bring up the sound level on songs that were not recorded very loud. It is use full when making a compilation disc as the songs that you use may have been recorded at all different levels. But be aware that on some discs the volume was choosen to create a special effect, on these CDs normalization would destroy that effect.\n\nAfter created the noise profile (selecting a range, create noise profile, save noise profile) you are able to load the wav to denoise (or keep the actual one). There you have to load a noise profile first (noise profile/load), or keep the noise profile you created from that audio file, then you are able to remove the noise of it. You have to select first a range of the audio data that should be denoised before the menu option will be activated.\n\nI assume that you are recording the CD to WAV and then using the WAV to burn a rw-cd. There’s an extra step in the middle to edit the clicks out of the WAV file. More complex pops that occur on analog recording (tapes, etc.) should be found by listening to the WAV roughly to find the positions with +/- 3 seconds accuracy. Then select such a range and choose “Pop Detection”. Usually EAC will find them automatically. If not, switch to “Spectral View” and look for any anormalities. Then you have different options to remove the pop."
