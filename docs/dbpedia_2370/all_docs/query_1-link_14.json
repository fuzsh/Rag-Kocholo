        "text": "Tell Me Lies explored some major toxic relationships, steamy sex scenes and shocking deaths — and the second season will keep throwing obstacles at the main characters.\n\nThe Hulu series, which is based on a novel by Carola Lovering, introduced a story about Lucy’s (Grace Van Patten) troubling connection with Stephen (Jackson White) during her freshman year of college. During an eight-year time period, the couple wreaked havoc in their own lives and created chaos for their friends as well.\n\nAccording to showrunner Meaghan Oppenheimer, the plan for season 2 is to kick everything up a notch.\n\n“I think there will be some revenge plots in Season 2,” the writer told TVLine in October 2022, referring to Lucy knowing Stephen’s secret about the car accident. “I don’t think that [Lucy] can tell people about [Stephen] being in the car because he made it so clear to her that if she were to tell that, she also have to admit all these other things, and I don’t think she’s at a place where she’s willing to risk that social annihilation and admit how badly she behaved, especially now that she’s seen that it wasn’t even worth it.”\n\nOppenheimer noted that the various romances will expand, adding, “I want to see a new love interest for Lucy: a new, complicated, messy thing to go alongside her never-ending thing with Stephen. Also, I hope to see a lot more of the ensemble characters.”\n\nScroll down for everything to know about Tell Me Lies season 2:"
