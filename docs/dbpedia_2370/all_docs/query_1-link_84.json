        "text": "“Tell Me Lies,” the salacious adaptation of Carola Lovering’s novel with the same name, has captured audiences left and right with its juicy relationships, hidden secrets and sinister twists.\n\nIf you need to catch up on who’s who in the steamy romance series, now airing weekly on Hulu, or if you’re wondering where you’ve seen its actors before, look no further.\n\nGrace Van Patten as Lucy Albright\n\nGrace Van Patten stars as Lucy, an incoming freshman at Baird College who is eager to escape the grasp of her overprotective mother. The New Englander meets her roommate, Macy, and enthusiastic hallmates Pippa and Bree. Despite insecurities of not easily connecting with others, which earned her the nickname “ice queen” in high school, when Stephen catches her eye at a party, her feelings are anything but subtle.\n\nWith roles in “Under the Silver Lake” and “Maniac,” Patten was a breakout star in “Nine Perfect Strangers,” also on Hulu.\n\nJackson White as Stephen DeMarco\n\nJackson White co-stars as Stephen DeMarco, an upperclassman at Baird who weaves himself into a love triangle — or maybe even a quadrangle — as he gets involved with Lucy while still balancing a tumultuous relationship with his ex, Diana. Coming from a middle class background, Stephen can’t relate to his peers’ extravagant trips abroad or ability to take an unpaid internship, so he instead lies, building an intricate web of manipulation to keep everyone happy — except himself.\n\nWhite’s previous credits include “Mrs. Fletcher,” “Ambulance” and “The Middle.”\n\nSonia Mena as Pippa\n\nSonia Mena plays Pippa, a precocious freshman who seems to know a bit too much about everything. Pippa pretty much immediately begins a relationship with Wrigley, giving her access to upperclassmen parties and drawing her away from Lucy and Bree. The distance between her and her friends is widened when Wrigley tells her a secret she must keep from her new best friends.\n\nYou might have seen Mena before in “Freezerburn,” “Feral” and “Search Party.”\n\nCatherine Missal as Bree\n\nCatherine Missal plays Bree, an inexperienced and humble freshman whose love life and struggles are frequently overshadowed by Pippa and Lucy’s dramatic relationships. Bree finds it easier to keep her personal matters to herself – until she finds herself confiding in upperclassman Evan, that is.\n\nMissal has had roles in “The Blacklist,” “Vacation” and “Law & Order: SVU.”\n\nSpencer House as Wrigley\n\nSpencer House joins the “Tell Me Lies” cast as Wrigley, a loveable football player who quickly gets swept into a relationship with freshman Pippa. Despite his seemingly free-spirited nature, Wrigley keeps his deepest worries for he and his younger brother, Drew, to himself — even if that means pushing Pippa away.\n\nHouse broke out in 2019’s “The Society” and has acted in titles like “Space Force” and “Teenage Bounty Hunters.”\n\nAlicia Crowder as Diana Linder\n\nAlicia Crowder plays Diana, a prim and proper upperclassman with ambitious plans who seems to do it all. Her only fault: She keeps getting dragged back into a toxic relationship with Stephen, who secretly maintains a relationship with Diana as he begins to see Lucy.\n\nCrowder can also be seen in “The Society,” as well as “Instinct.”\n\nBranden Cook as Evan\n\nBranden Cook plays Evan, an upperclassman from a wealthy family who’s unsure of what he wants to do after graduation. As Stephen’s roommate, he quickly becomes involved in his lies despite trying to steer clear of the drama. Evan also bonds with Bree as things with his long-term girlfriend head south.\n\nAs an acting newcomer, Cook has had roles in “Chicago P.D.,” “The Lost Boys” and “Industry.”\n\nBenjamin Wadsworth as Drew\n\nBenjamin Wadsworth joins the cast as Drew, Wrigley’s younger brother and an incoming freshman. Despite initially hitting it off with Bree, Drew becomes consumed by a secret that threatens his new life.\n\nWadsworth has had roles in “Your Honor,” “Deadly Class” and “Teen Wolf.”\n\nLily McInerny as Macy\n\nLily McInerny plays Macy, Lucy’s roommate who passes away after an accident during the first week of college. Although we don’t know much about Macy, besides that she grew up in a neighboring town to Lucy where Stephen also lived, we know that she was holding onto a secret she tried to tell Lucy before she passed.\n\nThis acting newcomer played Lea in “Palm Trees and Power Lines.”\n\nJessica Capshaw as CJ Albright\n\nJessica Capshaw joins the cast as CJ Albright, Lucy’s mom. While CJ admits that the two might need some space while driving Lucy to college, it’s clear she still loves Lucy, as she sends her care packages and calls to check in. However, Lucy is still holding onto a grudge related to something her mom did, likely in relation to her father, who we are not certain is alive.\n\nYou might have seen Capshaw in “Holidate,” “Grey’s Anatomy” or “The L Word.”"
