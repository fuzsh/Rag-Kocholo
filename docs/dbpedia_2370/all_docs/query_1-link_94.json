        "text": "What made Hulu’s highly addictive drama Tell Me Lies a standout when it first premiered in September 2022 was its unfiltered deep-dive into first love and heartbreak.\n\nThis twisted, sexy series was adapted for television by Meaghan Oppenheimer, who also serves as executive producer and showrunner. Based on Carola Lovering’s 2018 bestselling novel of the same name, the ten-episode first season was an immediate hit. Oppenheimer teamed up with Emma Roberts and Karah Preiss, who executive produce under their Belletrist Productions banner with Matt Matruski.\n\nThey reunited for the upcoming eight-episode second season, which premieres with two episodes on September 4. The story picks up as Lucy Albright (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen DeMarco (Jackson White) return to Baird College. The two are not speaking after their painful breakup at the start of the summer.\n\nWith heartbreak as its central theme, Tell Me Lies immediately resonated with its massive fanbase. As Oppenheimer said in an interview timed to the first season’s premiere, “Dating is hard; it’s hell. I went through hell. I have been a Lucy in the past. Heartbreak is timeless and universal.”\n\nShe also said how important it is to show young love. “We tend to downplay the importance of relationships at that age. In reality, those relationships are as emotionally significant as any relationships we have. They teach us how to love and how to be loved.”\n\nShe described Lovering’s novel as painful and honest. “It showed this female character behaving in ways we don’t often see. Lucy is doing things that are quite embarrassing. She’s undermining her happiness and allowing herself to be belittled.”\n\nThat love-gone-bad experience is one we can all relate to and this is why viewers gravitated to the series. If we are to be honest with ourselves, we have all acted in ways we wish we hadn’t in the name of toxic love.\n\nThese themes remain prevalent in the second season. Lucy and Stephen are still at odds, but now that everyone is back on campus the no-contact situation comes to an end when their paths cross. They find themselves in a new version of their addictive, toxic dynamic, which remains infuriating and inescapable.\n\nMeanwhile, the story expands deeper into the lives of Lucy and Stephen’s friend group, as the fallout from season one impacts all of their lives in unexpected ways. Cat Missal, Spencer House, Sonia Mena, Branden Cook, and Alicia Crowder return with new castmates including Oppenheimer’s husband Tom Ellis, and Thomas Doherty, who is a recurring guest star.\n\nIn a new interview, Oppenheimer talks about what fans can expect with season two. “I think this season is going to catch a lot of people off guard, largely because we were starting completely from scratch,” she explains, adding that season one was sourced mostly from Lovering’s novel.\n\n“Everything that happens this season is entirely new. One big shift is that we dug deeper into the lives of the ensemble cast. Every single character has a richer, more emotionally intricate storyline this year, but it all still weaves together in a way that feels cohesive. In terms of content, I think we take a lot more risks this season. There are storylines that live in a moral gray area that is really scary and exciting to me. This caused a lot of heated debates in the writers' room and I’m sure there will be similarly heated debates amongst the audience.”\n\nShe also explains how the timing of this story impacts these characters. “Our show is set in a time when the culture around sex was a lot more toxic than it is today, and unacceptable things were accepted, resulting in acts of profound desperation, often because young people felt they had no power. I think we look at that through a much blunter lens this season. The result is something that feels a lot more personal, vulnerable, and emotionally messy to me. All of that said, I do think we have a lot more humor and heart this season. It’s an inherently dark show, but we dug deeper into the moments of redemption and friendship in a way that I think gives some respite from the toxicity. I laughed out loud a lot more in the editing room this year!”\n\nWhen Oppenheimer spoke about the first season’s shocking finale, she said she wanted to make a series that explored how we undermine ourselves when we fall for the wrong people. When Lucy meets Stephen, she sees all the red flags but ignores them. “I wanted to write a show that captures, for lack of a better word, how humiliating love can be.”"
