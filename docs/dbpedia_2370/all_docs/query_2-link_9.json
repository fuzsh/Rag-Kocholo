( permalink )\n\npeterblaisephotography says:\n\n.\n\nAs a programmer, I see no problem or special challenge for Flickr to convert operating system \"directories/folders\" into Flickr \"sets\", just as I see no great challenge for Flicker to translate operating system \"filemnames\" into Flickr \"titles\". This is no-brainer stuff.\n\nJust as I see no special challenge or problem for Flickr to convert any input image file format, including any Raw format, into Flickr JPGs.\n\nWhile I appreciate that existing Flickr tools do none of those things now, all I'm saying is: is anyone here in this forum actually from Yahoo? And are you taking notes from me, your paying customer, and reporting back to marketing, to project management, to programming offerings, and to customer service?\n\nThanks to all who feel the need to inform me of things I already know: that Flickr is incapable of automatically accomplishing the upload conversions/translations I seek.\n\nI'm not trying to bait you or catch you in an argument. I'm only trying to register my wish list for future Flickr offerings. I'm not asking anyone to try to convince me as to why I should not expect these services, why I should not even ask, and especially I'm not looking for anyone to dissuade me from criticizing what I perceive to be Yahoo's lack of customer service - that is, Flickr missing the exact, simple translation of my pictures into Flickr pictures! Why is it so hard, Flickr? Why can't I share my pictures on paid Flickr as easily as I can through free Picasa and free IrfanView?\n\nUmm ... I also appreciate that this thread has devolved away from \"How to batch upload and KEEP original filename as Flickr filename?!?\"\n\nI'll close this thread when I find a solution or when I give up.\n\nSo far, I've removed and reinstalled Flickr Uploader, cleaned the Windows XP Pro SP2 registry, rebooted, yada yada. I can upload one picture using the Uploader, but not multiple pictures. I can drag pictures into the Uploader, but the uploader cannot load a directory of JPGs when I point to it, just returning me to a previous menu as if I had not selected the files. Argh.\n\nIn another Yahoo venue, Yahoo mail cannot send if I edit and hold an email open too long during composing - I have to cut and paste my new writing into an immediately opened new window and then send within a moment or two otherwise the newly opened Yahoo email window also times-out and prevents me from sending, and I have to cut and paste and start again.\n\nAny other problems, Yahoo?\n\nPS - Earlier: \"... Flickr Ideas ...\"\n\nGot a LINK? Thanks!\n\n.\n\nPosted ages ago. ( permalink )\n\npeterblaisephotography edited this topic ages ago.\n\npeterblaisephotography says:\n\n.\n\nEarlier: \"... while I appreciate that 6 million images uploaded each day without the problem you describe isn't actually a disqualification for possible problems with the uploader, the fact that you alone, out of millions of users are experiencing this, certainly is suggestive of a software or workflow inconsistency ...\"\n\nTHANK YOU! Finally someone gets it. However,\n\n(a) 6 million successful uploads daily does not mean they are accomplishing what I want to accomplish, namely, preserving my filenames and directory structure as Flickr titles and sets. I appreciate I may be below the radar of the Flickr Uploader programmer's assigned targets. What I'm trying to do is get my goals on their radar. And I am not alone, I am a solo voice on these forums, but I am not alone in desiring the services I mention. My customers have investigated Mozy. Carbonite, SOS, and so on, instead of Flickr. I'm trying to maximize the opportunity for Flickr to compete for my customer's attention - this lack of easy, automatic mirroring is a show stopper against Flickr for them.\n\n(b) \"workflow inconsistency\" is EXACTLY what I am trying to resolve, but, sadly, blindly, and apparently I am, we are, trying to figure this out without the active presence and help and involvement with Yahoo Flickr Uploader programmers - argh!\n\nEarlier: \"... the software that came with your camera ... If you're using their software to manage your content, adding captions and such, then that's the first place to look in terms of editing the data out or putting the correct data into the fields ...\"\n\nI use IrfanView to batch edit IPTC for an entire group of photos at once. I will search Flickr Help forums for IrfanView coordination. Thanks for the suggestion.\n\nMore importantly for me is the independent IPTC standardization, and someone at Flickr Uploader programming bringing THEIR choices of IPTC field interpretations to the fore so we can manage them within the Flickr Uploader without all this guesswork.\n\nI do not have a Sony Alpha DSLR-A700, but only downloaded image files from an in-store demo, saving Raw for my use later, and uploading JPGs from in-camera capture. I'd like the Flickr Uploader workflow to be generic and automatic, and to be camera and source image file format independent.\n\nHold off, everyone, since I'm not at my computer to try the next iteration. I'll report back when I have tried again.\n\nPosted ages ago. ( permalink )\n\npeterblaisephotography edited this topic ages ago.\n\npeterblaisephotography says:\n\n.\n\nEarlier: \"... You cannot have an empty set on flickr ...\"\n\nDang - naive programmers. Of course we need empty sets, like perhaps a set called \"TODAY\" where I might put shots from TODAY only, and I'd have to clean out yesterday's and put in today's, so it would have to be empty, maybe even until tomorrow if I had no shots from today. Or a set called \"These I'm Going to Delete Unless You Can Find Something Nice To Say About Them\", or whatever.\n\nGeesh - it's just not hard for me to imagine building a container before putting things in, and certainly my experience shows me I might want to replace the contents of any set at any time (perhaps I got a new Raw interpreter and like it so much I want to replace my older Raw interpretations), and before the new goes in, the old must come out, and so it's empty in between (and removing the old AFTER putting in the new just BEGS for mistakes!)!\n\nAs it is, I'd need to trick the \"set\" and keep something in there, maybe even a blank 1 pixel JPG or a text JPG explaining my \"TODAY\" project, or whatever is the name and purpose of the set. C'mon, people - we all do this all the time to get around silly limitations unanticipated by the designers with everything in our lives, right? How do we hold the elevator open long enough for us to put ALL our groceries in? Has nobody DOUBLE PARKED in their lives? We all have used a screw driver to open a can of paint, but THAT'S not in the owner's instruction manual for the screw driver, is it? These are all tricks to get around limited designs and designer's self-centered myopia. But hey, on Flickr, it's just programming - easy to re-design, given appropriate customer feedback, like we are doing here.\n\nYeah, yeah, I know, remove yesterday's shots AFTER putting in today's shots ... but, as I said, aside from the mess, what if I have no shots today? My fans come to visit and see the folder gone and then I loose continuity of my community! Who ever heard of not permitting an empty container? All the programmers have to do is start \"set\" content counting at 0 (zero) instead of at 1 (one). Simple, no?\n\nSo, you got me started on yet another wish list - EMPTY FLICKR SETS! Thanks!\n\nBy the way, there was no warning about the set being automatically deleted when it became empty, so I lost all the details from the original description - another naive Yahoo Flickr programming stunt where they toss precious user data without warning! This is what I'm talkin' about!\n\nEarlier: \"... If you want a staff reply, use Help by Email ...\"\n\nWhew. Thank goodness. I thought it was ME getting these dialogs all wrong, and now I see, finally, that it wasn't me at all!\n\nIf I had asked, \"How do I contact Yahoo Flickr staff?\", then it makes sense to get the responses above. But I didn't ask that. I asked something else, specifically, something else. I asked, \"Are there any Yahoo Flickr EMPLOYEES on these forums, or \"just\" users?\". The responses help me deduce an answer - \"no\", there are no Yahoo Flickr employees here, at least not regularly, and definitely not in an engaging, dialogic way. This surprised me, considering the name on the forum:\n\nflickr Help / The Help Forum\n\nIn spite of the name, I now see that it's really:\n\nflickr Help / User to User Help Forum\n\nHey, Flickr is not the first to get their headlines inaccurate! Ever read a newspaper where the headline really made sense as an accurate descriptor of the body text of what was going on in the story? Me neither! Headline writing - a lost art.\n\nSo, when I suggest Raw as an importable image file format source for the Flickr Uploader to consider on the way to Flickr JPGs, and people tell me \"no site stores Raw\" (not what I thought I was asking for, but a neat idea now that I consider it: have FLickr store the Raw and only convert it on demand, and converter it smarter and smarter with each new generation of Flickr programmers), or people suggest that Raw is inappropriate (that Raw is ambiguous, complex, time consuming, expensive, again, opposite of my experience and not what I was asking for help with) anyway, I thought I was going crazy.\n\nBut, just like my \"any employees here?\" question, it was just a few readers who extrapolated beyond my inquiry and offered indirect, tangential insights. Thanks!\n\nThanks for the side chat and exploration, but I really meant what I wrote and asked.\n\nIn a way, though, this is a really good vetting process here at the Flickr (User to User) Help forum, where we toss ideas around and rip them apart and really challenge them in every way possible. I appreciate it, I really do. No hard feelings. Please, keep it up with every one of my wacky, newfangled ideas that I present here. Without going through the gauntlet of such challenges, I admit that my ideas were significantly less well thought out, less mature, and in need of polishing to get them ready for prime time presentation.\n\nNow, thanks to your help, I feel I've got not only a few really useful ideas, but I also understand waay more how varied and dynamic is the Flickr community. We have all types here, simple and complex users, straight forward and creative users, play and striving-professional users, and so on.\n\nGREAT community, Flickr!\n\n.\n\nPosted ages ago.
