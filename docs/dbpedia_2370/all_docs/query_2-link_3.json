        "text": "The error, TS2307: Cannot find module '../images/kitten-header.jpg', is highlighting that the TypeScript compiler does not understand the import of a .jpg file.\n\nThe webpack configuration is fine, as evidenced by the image file being copied to the dist folder successfully despite the compile error.\n\nThere are two ways that we can resolve the issue.\n\nFirstly, we could bypass the TypeScript import by using a 'require' statement. To do this, the import...\n\nimport kittenHeader from '../images/kitten-header.jpg';\n\n...can be replaced with a require...\n\nconst kittenHeader = require('../images/kitten-header.jpg');\n\n...and that should be all that's needed.\n\nNote that, in my case I also needed to install some typings to support the 'require' statement. Without these, I was getting a TS2304: Cannot find name 'require' error.\n\nOriginally I used @types/node, as described in this SO answer, but @EvanSebastian pointed out that node is intended to support writing NodeJS modules, which is not what I'm doing (see comments on the question).\n\nI tried @types/webpack-env, as suggested, but this resulted in a TS2322: Type '{ src: {}; }' is not assignable to type 'HTMLProps<HTMLImageElement>'. error against the src property of my image tag.\n\nMost recently, I've switched to using @types/requirejs, which I'm hoping is focused enough to avoid including a load of inappropriate additional types. It is currently working:\n\nnpm install @types/requirejs --save-dev"
