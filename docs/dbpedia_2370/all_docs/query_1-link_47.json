        "text": "Spoilers for the Tell Me Lies finale ahead.\n\n“You only know what someone shows you,” Tell Me Lies creator Meaghan Oppenheimer tells Vanity Fair in a recent Zoom. She’s detailing how her writers room played with the idea of access when creating Hulu’s soapy, seductive series—that is, withholding a character’s deepest secrets until after you’ve already judged who they are. But her words could also double as a thesis statement for the show, which just wrapped its twisty first season.\n\nExecutive produced by Emma Roberts and based on the 2018 novel by Carola Lovering, the series centers on doomed romance between Lucy Albright (Grace Van Patten), and Stephen DeMarco (Jackson White), a pair of college students who fall headfirst into a fairy tale built on falsehoods. Oppenheimer says that while she had Lovering’s “blessing” to divert from the novel, she wanted to retain the source material’s beating, breaking heart. “You really feel that obsession,” Oppenheimer explains. “When you just have someone in your fucking blood.”\n\nThe season finale finally reveals how Macy (Lily McInerny) died and just how involved Stephen was with her death. It also contains a major complication for the show’s resident nontoxic couple, Bree (Catherine Missal) and Evan (Branden Cook), and perhaps the best onscreen use of The Killers’ “Mr. Brightside” since 2006’s The Holiday. Then, there’s that cliff-hanger.\n\nOppenheimer spoke to VF about the finale twist she’s feeling most “nervous” about viewers’ reactions to, which major red flag you’re missing, and what’s brewing for season two.\n\nVanity Fair: We’re in an era where people are consumed by celebrity drama. Instagram gossip broker DeuxMoi was even an early champion of Tell Me Lies. Do you think the saturation of celebrity gossip and analysis has made us better or worse at detecting red flags in our own relationships?\n\nMeaghan Oppenheimer: That’s a good question. It’s very easy with DeuxMoi and celebrity stuff when we’re not attached to it, to see a lot of red flags—even ones that aren’t there, because we’re overanalyzing everything. I think people are usually worse at seeing red flags in their own lives, when it pertains to things that they care about. Because we might not want to, or emotions are just very, very blinding. I would love to say people are better at spotting the bullshit, but when I actually talk to my friends who are still dating and single, you’re still missing a lot of the red flags.\n\nWhile making the show, did you learn of any red flags that people may not be spotting?\n\nI wouldn’t have been able to write this show if I was not in a healthier place with relationships. When you’re in it and in the drama and toxicity, you’re not as aware of it—sort of. It’s only been in the last few years that I’ve been able to truly recognize some of the toxicity in my earlier relationships. So I feel like I came into the show with a pretty clear understanding of what it was like to be manipulated and gaslit, and the intricate ways people can do that. One thing that I’m always surprised about—and this show kind of reaffirmed it to me—is just what good liars people are when they need to be. I think that anyone is capable of really lying and lying well, if something is on the line.\n\nBut one red flag that most people ignore or don’t think of as a red flag—I don’t think Stephen is someone who ever has platonic female friends. And if you are dating a man who does not have any platonic [female] friends, who doesn’t look at women that way, I think that’s a red flag. Looking back in my life, all the people that were the most toxic men, none of them had female friends. Because they see women only as an opportunity for one thing. And the best guys I know, and the guys who have treated me the best and my husband, they’re so comfortable with female friends.\n\nI guess someone who believes in When Harry Met Sally’s age-old question is a red flag in 2022.\n\nI mean, I have so many platonic male friends. I think it’s how you grew up also. But I people who are like, “Oh, guys and girls can't be friends,” I’m like: “You’re fucked up. That’s ridiculous. You’re cutting out half the population that could be your friend.”\n\nSo much of the finale is told from Macy’s perspective and her final words, “I feel like you’re a bad person—you do all the things a bad person would do,” are powerful. What was it like digging into that character?\n\nThe way to tell the story of how she really died had to be in her shoes and that was the only way to do it. I knew I wanted it to open with a bang. And I love that you like that line. I feel like that line is sort of the audience’s experience with Stephen. Because we’re wondering the whole season, “How bad is he?” And we tried our best to humanize him. But then with that scene with Macy, it’s such an unforgivable thing, it’s like, “Oh, we have our answer right now.” We know that he’s a certain level of bad that maybe we hadn’t accepted before.\n\nStephen isn’t romanticized, but you can see why Lucy would be lured in by his actions. How did you thread that needle and avoid—even unintentionally—making him an Internet Boyfriend?\n\nI’m glad that you thought it was done well. The thing that I wanted to be really clear about is that people who are emotionally abusive and narcissistic, and when you get into these relationships with them, it’s not like you don’t see the red flags all the time. Sometimes you see all of them and you ignore it. There’s some misconception that only people that are completely blindsided or naive or stupid or whatever fall for these kind of things. But it’s not the case.\n\nAttraction is a very powerful thing, and delusion is a very powerful thing. And sometimes if your trauma fits really well with another person’s trauma, it’s like a perfect storm. But a huge part of it was just in casting. Jackson has so much sex appeal and he’s so dynamic, but he’s not the typical Hollywood guy on a poster. He’s specific and different and that’s, to me, what makes him more realistic. If we had someone that was just overly suave and charming, that is going to glamorize it.\n\nThe scenes between Stephen and his mother, played by Jackson’s real-life mom, Katey Sagal, really complicated how we view that character without letting him off the hook. How did you get them on screen together for the first time?\n\nWe were trying to figure out who Nora was, and we finally got the script in a place that we wanted it to be. But on the page, she’s still up in the air. An actress is going to have to come in and say who this person is. She obviously has some mental health issues, but we were trying not to label her as one specific thing. Then I just had the thought, “What if his mom played his mom?” I texted him first, because I wanted to make sure he was okay with it. And he waited a while to text me back. An hour later he was like, “Yeah, that would be great.” He later told me that he first freaked out and was like, “Oh my god, that’s a crazy idea.” Then he came around to it, but I never saw that part of it. I just thought he was really excited from the beginning [laughs].\n\nShe’s such an icon and I hadn’t seen her do a role like this. But there wasn’t any rehearsal time. We didn’t really know what she was going to do when she showed up to set, and Jackson didn’t know. Jackson was a little excited-nervous, he’d never worked with her before. And they have a very, very, very healthy relationship. I think it’s always just a lot more vulnerable when you’re working with someone that you care so much about, that knows you so well. But they both did such a great job. And that vulnerability that doing it with his real mom gave Jackson, it’s one of his best performances the whole season.\n\nDiana (played by Alicia Crowder) is a more minor character in the book, but her on-off relationship with Stephen becomes a major part of the series. Their finale exit from the party is shocking, but weirdly funny. Did you always know that would be their end?\n\nI knew that that scene was going to be the end of the college years in season one because it was in the book and I thought, “That scene is so visual, I can see it and it has to be in there.” But it ended up being much different. When we initially were imagining it, I thought it would have more somber music. And it just wasn’t working. Because it’s such an over-the-top thing to do to someone, if you put music that’s taking it too seriously on top of that, it just becomes melodramatic and almost cheesy.\n\nI wanted to use “Mr. Brightside” in an earlier episode and we didn’t end up using it. So I said to my editor, “Just put in ‘Mr. Brightside’ to see what that feels like.” She played it, and we were both just giggling gleefully. We were like, “This makes the scene evil now in a fun way.” I was always talking about the tone of the show because the characters are doing bad things, but you still need it to be fun without glamorizing it. I was like, “It needs to always feel like there’s an evil God looking down on these people and just grinning at everything they’re doing.” And that is what that song felt like to me. That scene ended up being one of my favorites.\n\nLearning about Lucy and Evan’s hookup made me see all of their interactions so differently. How did you approach that reveal?\n\nI just felt like it’s a great plot twist. People wouldn’t expect it. I feel so badly for Bree and I feel even worse now, because the audience loves their relationship so much. But I needed Evan to have a “fuck you” moment, to retaliate in some way. Because that’s realistic. He’s been so mistreated by Stephen and he was so squeaky clean a lot of the time, that I was like, “He needs to have a fuck up.” But I’m nervous of what the reaction is going to be, because people really felt very precious about that relationship in a nice way.\n\nIf anything, it just proves that everyone has secrets; Lucy and Evan shielding that from Bree is very Stephen-esque. Sex is used as a point of manipulation and deflection with many of the characters. What was it like crafting those scenes?\n\nOur intimacy coordinator, Dr. Tiff [Tiffanie Davis Henry]—she’s amazing. I was like, “I want to feel like we can smell the bedsheets.” Because sex is so often overlooked as something that’s just sexy, or gratuitous, or glossy, and people miss such an opportunity because in reality there’s so many conversations going on in sex. I find it very interesting that someone is, in bed, very different from how they might be in real life.\n\nI just really wanted to have sex be dealt with as a continuation of the conversation, and not feel pressured to make it look good all the time. And that’s why those moments of getting the condom on, we don’t often see that stuff. It’s like there’s just this moment of magical gliding in and it’s like, was there a condom? Any kind of lubricant situation? It’s always so rushed through. But there have been a lot of shows recently that have done sex really well and opened the door. I thought Normal People dealt with sex beautifully; I May Destroy You obviously dealt with sex really well.\n\nWe don’t see Stephen and Diana after their exit or Lucy and Max (Edmund Donovan) reconcile. Was there anything that you were tempted to show more of?\n\nWell, the goal is to hopefully have a second season. So those are all things that I hope to explore if we get a second season, because the engagement party and the staircase scene when they break up, that’s not the last time [Lucy and Stephen] saw each other. There’s been many breakups and [moments of] getting back together. We just haven’t seen them yet. But in terms of what I wanted to show more of, I mean, we had such a big ensemble. I really, really hope that we get a season two so that we can explore more of the ensemble.\n\nThat’s so exciting. I didn’t even know that season two was on the table.\n\nI wouldn’t have left such a cliff-hanger, asshole ending.\n\nMany shows do that, so I resigned myself to thinking we’ll never know. I did want to ask about that cliff-hanger: Stephen getting engaged to Lucy’s hometown friend, Lydia. Was that also a part of your pitch?\n\nIt was a part of my initial pitch. I don’t know why I got the idea. Sometimes I’m just a bit of an asshole, and I’m trying to think of the worst, most shocking thing I could put into a story. So I was like, “What could he do that he hasn’t already done? What would the audience not see coming?” And I realized, she’s the one character that you haven’t seen interact with him at all. I don’t think anyone is going to predict it. So it felt like the perfect thing to do.\n\nIt implies all of these other chapters between Lucy and Stephen that we haven’t seen. If you get a second season, what can you tease about it?\n\nI can’t say the name, but we do have a very, very exciting actor that has said they would come on to do a season arc as Stephen’s boss. [I’m] just imagining Stephen at his internship being tortured, which I think everyone wants to see. And we would bring in a new love interest for Lucy—not to take Stephen’s place, but to complicate matters more. That would be really fun.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."
