You will automatically be taken to the new gallery and you can start uploading your first files.\n\nLightroom\n\nImportant info about the Lightroom plugin.\n\nUpload via Lightroom is automatically enabled for picdrop accounts registered before June 2022. If your account was created after June 2022, you won't find the plugin in your account settings. But don't worry: if you can't do without the Lightroom plugin for your work, please email us at hello@picdrop.com and we'll be happy to help.\n\nFTP access\n\nonly for accounts created before June 2022\n\nIn your FTP program, log into your picdrop FTP account and create a folder. Ready! The gallery is created with it and you can upload files to the gallery at any time via FTP, Lightroom or in your browser.\n\nDon't forget your gallery settings!\n\nFor all three ways, you should remember to check the gallery settings afterwards and if necessary set what your client is allowed to see and do in the gallery.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow to upload my first files?\n\nAfter you'veÂ signed upÂ for your free picdrop account there are many ways to upload your files to picdrop:\n\nDrag & Drop\n\nSimply mark the files you want to upload in Apple Finder or Windows Explorer and drag themÂ anywhereÂ in your open gallery. (No need to drag them on theÂ hint field for the \"Drag & Drop\" upload.) Then release your mouse button. Your upload starts immediately without you having to do anything else. You can check the status of your upload on the bottom right.\n\nUse the upload button\n\nIn the hint field for the \"Drag & Drop\" upload you will also find a classic upload button (yellow). By clicking on it, you can search in your Finder or Explorer and also select several files at the same time.\n\nVia FTP\n\nonly for accounts created before June 2022\n\nYou can also manage and organize your galleries and files via FTP. You will find the login data in your registration mail and instructions on how to set up your FTP program in the FAQ section \"How do I set up my FTP program correctly?\"\n\nLightroom export\n\nImportant info about the Lightroom plugin\n\nUpload via Lightroom is automatically enabled for picdrop accounts registered before June 2022. If your account was created after June 2022, you won't find the plugin in your account settings. But don't worry: if you can't do without the Lightroom plugin for your work, please email us at hello@picdrop.com and we'll be happy to help.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do my clients get to their galleries? Do they need an account?\n\nYour clients do not need an account or login.\n\nNevertheless, there are two different, easy ways to send galleries to your clients.\n\nDirectly\n\nSend your clients the direct URL to your gallery - they don't need to log in unless you have set a gallery password in the gallery settings. This is the fastest, most convenient and most used way.\n\nYou can send the address to them by e-mail, messenger, etc. Or conveniently via picdrop by clicking on \"Share\" in your gallery.\n\nVia client login\n\nYou can create clients logins in your account settings. You can set a login and assign it to one or more galleries to which your client will have access. Afterward, you point your client to your picdrop URL (https://www.picdrop.com/your-username). There he/she will find a login field in which he/she only has to enter his/her password. After the successful login, your client will see an overview of all the galleries that have been activated for him/her. It is important to understand that the client login has nothing to do with the password of a single gallery.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to know that noone is able to see your gallery overview. This overview is reserved for you, as the account owner only. Therefore, it makes no sense to refer clients to your own picdrop URL unless you have created a client login for them.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I set the functions and look for a gallery?\n\nIn each of your galleries, you can activate or deactivate all functions individually. You can tailor your galleries perfectly to every client and every project. You are able to do this in each gallery in the upper right corner under âGallery Settingsâ.\n\nGeneral settings\n\nWelcome Message:Â Here you can welcome your clients to their picdrop gallery or give them specific instructions along the way. The text will always be displayed on top of the gallery.\n\nDownloads: Here you can specify whether your clients may or may not download your original files.\n\nArrangement:Â Here you select how your files will be sorted: by file name, capture time, upload time, file type, file size, and image dimensions. You can also group all images by color flags or file type.\n\nYou can also decide if your clients should be able toÂ navigate to sub-galleries and vice versa.\n\npicdrop is available in English and German, here you can define in whichÂ languageÂ your clients should see picdrop. If you do not set anything, picdrop automatically detects the browser language of your clients and then displays the gallery in German or in English.\n\nIf you want to change the header image you can find detailed instructions right here.\n\nEdit Mode\n\npicdropâs Edit Mode is for collaborating and communicating with your clients. Here you can decide what your clients can do.\n\nLayout:Â Here you define the appearance of your gallery and how your files should be arranged.\n\nFile information:Â Choose what your clients can see when clicking on a single file.\n\nPicture selections:Â With the picture selection function you can set specific photos in a gallery. With a click on the blue + at the upper left edge of the preview picture, the file is added to a set of selections. After completing an image selection, it must be saved and named.\n\nColor flags:Â Color flags allow you to quickly and easily make assessments and decisions with your clients. You can find the color flags in two places: at the top right of the small preview images in the gallery and in the large single image display directly below the image. Click to open the color flag menu. Here you can choose from the colors red = no, orange = maybe, green = yes and black = FINAL. You can also customize the names for the color flags.\n\n(Pro-Tip:Â Sort the images in the âAppearanceâ area by color markers and downwards. This automatically sorts your images in the overview according to color and displays them separately, which makes it extremely easy to filter out favorites.)\n\nComments:Â By activating the comments your clients have the possibility to write comments on each file in the gallery. The comments will be displayed at the bottom left of the files and can be created in the same place.\n\nImage annotations: Scribbles let your clients draw their comments into the images.\n\nClient upload:Â If you want your clients toÂ uploadÂ files to the gallery as easily as you can, then activate the client upload.\n\nPrint contact sheet:Â For further coordination, you can also activate the option for your clients to print a contact sheet.\n\nPresentation Mode\n\nTheÂ Presentation ModeÂ is a specific way for you to deliver a gallery to your clients. It focuses on the beautiful presentation of your pictures and videos and puts the practical picdrop functions in the background. The Presentation Mode is available for you in someÂ plansÂ (starting with Pro). All features of the Presentation Mode are also available in detail in ourÂ FAQ.\n\nStarting the gallery in Presentation Mode:Â The essential setting for the Presentation Mode is its activation/deactivation.\n\nSince some of the familiar picdrop functions are not active in the Presentation Mode, if you would still like to use these functions with your clients, you should activate theÂ switch to Edit Mode.Â You can apply this change by entering a 4-6 digit PIN number.\n\nYou can hideÂ red marked images / videos in the Presentation Mode from the gallery,Â so you can only present the best results.\n\nBelow these three functions, you find are all the settings with which you can customize theÂ appearanceÂ of the gallery in Presentation Mode: beingÂ background color,Â appearance of the header image, as well asÂ size,Â spacingÂ andÂ edgesÂ of yourÂ thumbnails. All other gallery components such as buttons and social links conveniently adapt to your settings for the appearance of the gallery.\n\nYou can find more detailed information in our separate FAQ articles aboutÂ gallery design,Â background color,Â title settings, setting a galleryâs header imgage andÂ thumbnail settings.\n\nSecurity\n\nHere you are able to protect your pictures with aÂ watermarkÂ andÂ password. But above all, you can specify the address at which your gallery should be accessible.\n\nGallery Links: There are several ways your gallery links can look. For each gallery, we always create an externally available, secure link first, which consists of a randomly generated string of letters and numbers. In addition, you have the opportunity to edit the link individually and enter the wording that you would like to use for the custom link to the gallery instead of using the random string. By clicking on the \"Insert gallery path as custom link\" button, you can also select the gallery name and gallery path as link wording. If you set your gallery as private, it will only be visible to you as an account owner and to client logins.\n\nPassword:Â Regardless of the shape of the gallery link, you can create or have an additional gallery password created for each gallery. We generally recommend this additional step to secure the gallery to all our users.\n\nWatermark:Â To protect your pictures, you can activate the picdrop watermark function. For this purpose, enter one or more desired watermarks in your account settings, for example with your logo. These can then be selected in the gallery settings.\n\nPlease note: Activating and disabling watermarks for a gallery can take some time. Please be patient while the function is applied before making any other adjustments to the gallery settings. It is also important to know that we do not overwrite the watermarks on your original pictures since we will never change your files. Instead, we put the watermark over the thumbnails so they are protected from screenshots. Even though watermarks are enabled, the original files can be downloaded. Make sure to deselect download as a function in the gallery settings.\n\nDonât forget to save!\n\nIf you have set everything, you can save your settings by clicking on âApply Changesâ. To make sure that your clients gets exactly the settings you expect, selectÂ âClient Viewâ in the top right corner to see how your clients will see the gallery!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I change the order of my images & videos?\n\nYou can define the criteria by which your files are sorted and grouped in each gallery. You can do this in the gallery settings under \"Genera Settingsl\".\n\nYou can sort your files by the following criteria:\n\nFile name\n\nCapture time\n\nTime of upload\n\nFile size\n\nImage dimensions\n\nIn order to be able to sort images according to the time they were taken, this information must be stored in the Exif data of your images.\n\nYou can also group files in your gallery. They will then be displayed in the gallery in individual sections.Â\n\nYou can group your files by these attributes:\n\nColor flag\n\nFile type\n\nFor example, all files marked with the green color flag will be displayed in a separate section. Within this section they will be sorted according to your desired settings.Â\n\nEach sorting and grouping can also be displayed in reverse order (e.g. files sorted by file name from Z to A instead of from A to Z) by activating \"Reverse order\".\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow to copy or move files to another gallery?\n\nYou can easily move or copy files from their current gallery to another gallery in picdrop.\n\nThis is a step by step guide on how to do this.\n\nFirst select the files you want to move or copy. To do so, click on the blue plus sign that appears in the upper left corner of the file when hovering the mouse over it.\n\nPro tipp: You can also quickly select any number of files to copy or move from a saved selection or any filter set in the filter bar.\n\nWhen you have selected all files, click on the Move / Copy icon located in the export bar at the bottom of the screen.\n\nIn the opening menu you can now choose whether you want to move or copy the files.\n\nSelect the desired target gallery in the list of your galleries or simply create a new gallery in the lower left corner.\n\nConfirm the selected action with the button at the bottom right.\n\nThe success message shows you that all files have been copied or moved.\n\nWith a click on the button \"Go to target gallery\" you will be taken directly to the target gallery.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow can I see what's happening in my galleries?\n\nIn your picdrop account you will always find the Activities in the top right-hand corner so you can see what is happening in your galleries at any time.\n\nThe red number indicates that there is news in your account.\n\nIn the Activities you will find\n\nall visits\n\nall uploads and downloads\n\ninformation on updated (= re-uploaded) files\n\nComments and Scribbles\n\nnew and changed Color Flags\n\nchanges to Selections / Sets\n\nnew and changed Likes\n\nthe creation date (at the bottom)\n\nin your galleries.\n\nNo matter where you are currently working in your account, when you call up the Activities, you will always see the events for all your galleries.\n\nIf you are in a gallery, you can restrict the display to the current gallery using the button at the top right (\"Show current gallery only\").\n\nWith the three options to the left, you can specify whose actions you want to see: all your own actions, actions from your Team Members or actions from all other visitors to your gallery. You can combine these filters as you wish to get the overview you need.\n\nTwo more practical tips:\n\nIn your own actions, for example, you can find the upload dates for each image and track the creation date of the gallery.\n\nMove the mouse over the relative date displayed (e.g. yesterday, 2 weeks ago) and you will see the exact time for the event.\n\nThe Activities will keep you updated about whatâs happening in your galleries. You can also get notifications via email for some of those Activities.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nTrial Month & Contract\n\nWhat happens to my files after the trial month?\n\nAfter the trial month you are free to choose one of our plans or continue to use the free plan.\n\nIf you don't decide for one of our affordable plans, but choose the limited free plan, all your galleries created so far and all uploaded files will of course be preserved. If the uploaded files exceed the total amount of data or the number of galleries in the free plan however, all exceeding files and galleries can no longer be downloaded and accessed by third parties, such as your clients.\n\nOf course, you can always switch to a Lite, Pro or Business plan to continue working without any restrictions.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nAre there minimum contract terms or periods of notice?\n\nWe'll make it easy for you:\n\nIf you pay monthly, you can also cancel monthly. (monthly payments are possible in our Lite, Pro and Business plan)\n\nIf you take advantage of the semi-annually payment, you can cancel semi-annually.\n\nThis means that you can cancel an annual payment with all its benefits every year.\n\nWhat does termination mean?\n\nTermination means that your contract will not automatically be renewed for the same period at the end of the current billing period. In the event of termination, the current billing period can, of course, be used in full until the end. A proportional repayment of the current billing period is not possible.\n\nNo period of notice\n\nYou will always have until the last day to object to an automatic renewal, i.e. to cancel your plan. We want you to stay with us because of our great service - not because of a adhesion contract. If you no longer need picdrop, you can leave us painlessly at any time and download all your data without any problems.\n\nWhat happens in the event of termination?\n\nYour account will be automatically reduced to the free plan at the end of the current, already paid billing period. All your galleries and files will of course remain. Existing galleries and files that exceed the maximum of 3 galleries or the 1 GB storage of the free plan are no longer available for third parties and cannot be downloaded anymore.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhere can I find my invoice(s)?\n\nYou can find all your invoices at any time directly in your picdrop account.\n\nTo find them, click on the Account Preferences at the top right when you are logged in to your picdrop account. Then go to the Payments & Legal section.\n\nHere you can find all invoices and the current payment status. You can download all your invoices as PDF files.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I switch between different plans?\n\nOf course you can!\n\nIf you switch to a higher plan, you can start using the new plan immediately. We will deduct the remaining credit from your old plan from your first bill for the new plan. This way you don't pay a cent too much.\n\nIf you switch to a lower or our Free plan, you will keep the plan you have already paid for until the end of your current billing period. The new plan will then be activated at the end of the billing period.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow can I pay you?\n\nThere are multiple ways to pay for your invoices:\n\nYou can pay all plans at picdrop monthly, semi-annually or annually â conveniently by SEPA direct debit (also simply called direct debit) or with your credit card.\n\nYou can use SEPA direct debit if you have your bank account in a country that uses the Euro as its currency and your bank account is therefore also held in Euros.\n\nWith a credit card that supports transactions in euros, you can pay for picdrop from anywhere in the world.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWill I be notified before my Pro-Plan is renewed?\n\nNo.\n\nWe don't want to annoy you with emails every month. In your account settings under \"Your plan\", you will always find all the information about yourÂ current plan and when your subscription will be automatically renewed.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nI need more storage space. Is that possible?\n\nYes, of course!\n\nIf you reach the storage limit in your Pro plan or your Business plan, you can book additional storage space for your picdrop account:\n\nIn the Pro plan, you can expand your storage space at any time and as often as you like in 250 GB increments.\n\nFor each 250 GB you pay 7.99 â¬ net per month in addition to the basic price of your Pro plan.\n\nFor your picdrop account in the Business plan, you can expand your storage space in 1 TB increments.\n\nYou pay 50,00 â¬ net per month for each 1 TB storage expansion.\n\nPlease send us an email to hello@picdrop.com and let us know how much additional storage you need.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I deduct picdrop for tax purposes?\n\nBut of course! For every direct debit, you will receive a proper invoice with VAT and you can book picdrop as an expense at the tax office. You can call up and print out older invoices at any time in your account.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I install picdrop on my own server?\n\nUnfortunately, this is not possible. picdrop is a very complex program that we constantly maintain and improve for you. This also includes perfectly adapted servers and the interaction of several functions. A use on other servers is therefore not possible.\n\nInstead, you can use picdrop with our Web Integration under your domain, so your clients won't even notice that picdrop isn't on your server.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I get a discount as a student?\n\nFor students of certain degree programs and photography schools, we offer discounted conditions in the Pro plan.\n\nSo if you have a lot to do with photos and videos during your studies, please send us an email to hello@picdrop.com. Please enclose a current certificate of enrollment with your email and we will check it for you! You are also welcome to register for a picdrop account if you don't have one yet.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan we get a special price for our company at picdrop?\n\nIn general, there are no individual prices at picdrop, but a transparent price structure for our affordable plans. You can view this in our plans overview: https://www.picdrop.com/web/pricing\n\nIf you need a quote for one of our plans or are interested in a Business XL plan, please send us an e-mail to hello@picdrop.com with the key data of your planned usage and we will gladly create the corresponding quote document for you.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nI need an offer before I can book a plan. Can picdrop create one for me and send it to me?\n\nWe would be happy to provide you with a formal quote for your desired plan at picdrop. Simply send us an e-mail to hello@picdrop.com. Tell us your desired plan and the address details to which you'd like us to issue the quote and we'll create and send the corresponding document for you directly.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nI would like to make more videos playable per month â can you increase my limits?\n\nIf you reach your monthly limit for video conversion in the Pro plan, you can book additional conversion minutes for your picdrop account with us at any time.\n\nFor just â¬5.00 + VAT per month, we can activate an additional 60 video minutes for your account. The amount will simply be added to your existing invoice amount each month.\n\nPlease send us an e-mail to hello@picdrop.com and let us know how many additional video minutes you need. We'll be happy to set it up for you!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nOur pricing model for the video function\n\nOur video function with streaming, preview image & quick preview is included in the Pro and Business plans. Users of the (old) Studio plan and users in the Test month can also use the video functions to the same extent as Pro plan users. Lite and Free users can continue to upload and download video files to their account.\n\nEach video must first be processed so that it can be played directly in picdrop. It is important to know that once a video has been processed, it can be played again and again in the account without any restrictions. There is a monthly processing volume for the Pro and Business plan:\n\nThe Pro plan includes 60 minutes of processing volume per calendar month.\n\nThe Business plan includes 120 minutes of processing volume per calendar month.\n\nIn addition, the length of streamable videos is limited:\n\nto 15 minutes length in the Pro plan and\n\nto 30 minutes in the Business plan\n\nAll longer videos get the preview image, the animated preview and can be up- and downloaded, but are not directly playable in picdrop.\n\nThis pricing model is the attempt to not raise prices for our plans but also cover the costs of the new video function in picdrop. We reserve the right to make further adjustments in the future.\n\nIf you have reached your monthly conversion limit on the Pro plan, you can find information on how to increase your monthly conversion volume here.\n\nThank you for your understanding!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nThe Business L plan is not enough for us, how can we book a Business XL according to our wishes?\n\nWe are happy to help you book a Business XL plan and set up your account according to your wishes with the appropriate number of team members and storage.\n\nTo book a Business XL plan, please send us an e-mail to hello@picdrop.com with the key details of your planned usage. We will then quickly provide you with the corresponding price or create the corresponding quote if required.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nGeneral\n\nWhat is picdrop?\n\npicdrop is an online service that lets you as a photographer create flexible galleries for your clients in a flash.\n\nYou don't need more than anÂ internet browser and your own picdrop account. The installation of software on your computer or server is not necessary - but possible.\n\nAs a photographer, you upload your image and video files at picdrop, where they are stored absolutely securely and permanently. Your clients will then only need the link to the picdrop galleries you have created to view, select, download, etc.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhat file formats does picdrop support?\n\nYou can upload these file formats to your picdrop gallery. We create a preview image for (almost) all of these formats and your customers can download them if you have enabled downloads in the gallery:\n\nFile Format File Extension Preview? Up- and Download?

Your uploaded original files however are not affected by this!\n\nThe technical reason for this is that most camera manufacturers do not publish their \"RAW recipes\". However, we do our best to analyze the raw data and still display a reasonably correct preview image in your galleries as quickly as possible.\n\nYou are missing a file format completely in this table?\n\nFeel free to write us at hello@picdrop.com!\n\n___\n\n* For Photoshop and TIFF files, we recommend disabling the alpha channels in the file so that the image preview can be displayed in picdrop.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan picdrop handle RAWs, TIFFs and PSDs?\n\nThe vast majority of formats\n\nOf course JPGs, TIFFs, PSDs and most RAW formats are displayed cleanly in picdrop. An exact list of displayable formats that picdrop can handle can be foundÂ here.\n\nRAW formats\n\nWith RAW formats, unfortunately, each manufacturer makes his own type, so that the formats of some manufacturersÂ canÂ lead to color shifts and other effects. This is especially true for brand-new camera models, which we don't always support immediately. However, we can display most formats without any problems. To make sure that picdrop can also display your RAWs well, you can simply output them as DNGs in your RAW editing program like Lightroom. This has no influence on the quality of your RAWs.\n\nPSD format\n\nEverything works perfectly fine in 99% of all cases. However, with very complex Photoshop files (.PSD), errorsÂ canÂ occur when working with many layers and various layer modes, etc. For example, we recommend to deactivate the alpha channels so picdrop is able to show a clean picture preview. Flat, simple PSDs without thousands of layers are no problem at all.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I change the look of a gallery?\n\nOf course!\n\nYou can customize your logo (for the whole account), the header image of each gallery and the text above each gallery at any time. Starting from the Pro plan you can use three different layouts (grid, masonry and list) in picdropâs edit mode.\n\nYou can also format the welcome text of each gallery and embed Youtube or Vimeo videos there.\n\nTip: Use the welcome text to explain to your customers how to use the color flags and selections or to link to an individual tutorial.\n\nStarting with the Pro plan, the features of your gallery also include the Presentation Mode, where you can make a lot of design settings for each of your galleries. For example, you can adjust the background color or the font according to the style of the gallery.\n\nDetailed information about Presentation Mode can be found here.\n\nAlso, starting with the Pro plan, you can customize the color flags in your galleries account-wide: you can assign individual names to your color flags and (de-)activate individual color flags.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhich characters does picdrop support in gallery names?\n\nThe operation of picdrop is simple and intuitive, as is the naming of your galleries. However, in some special cases it may be helpful to know which characters picdrop supports when naming your galleries.\n\nYouÂ can useÂ the following characters in your picdrop gallery names without any problems:\n\nA-Z (lower & uppercase)\n\nÃ¤Ã¶Ã¼ (lower & upper case)\n\n0-9\n\n_ - ( ) .\n\nAs well as spaces if they are not at the beginning or end of the gallery name\n\nThe following characters areÂ automatically converted or reducedÂ by picdrop into your gallery name:\n\nYou enter: & or +Â Â Â Â Â picdropÂ changes to: und\n\nYou enterÂ in: ÃÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â picdropÂ changes to: ss\n\nYou enter: Ã¡Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â picdropÂ changes to: a (letters with diacritical characters are reduced to the basic letters if possible - with the exception of German umlauts)\n\nAll other special characters in the gallery name areÂ not supportedÂ by picdrop andÂ will be removedÂ from your gallery name.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhat are team members in a picdrop account?\n\nTeam Members allows you to work together with several people in one picdrop account. Each Team Member uses his own login data and can access galleries and settings of the picdrop account with individually adjustable access rights.\n\nTeam members can be used in Pro+ and and in our Business Plans. All details about setting up and using the team member function can be found here: Team Members in picdropâs FAQ\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhat are the differences between the three layouts in the Pro-Plan?\n\nIn your trial month as well as plans starting from the Pro plan you will have three different gallery layouts to choose from.\n\nGrid layout\n\nThe grid layout is the layout that will automatically be used when a new gallery is created. Unless you have changed this in your own default settings. This layout gives your clients a quick, orderly overview of all images. Thus, making it the ideal layout for working with professionals such as picture editors or corporate clients who want to quickly make a selection and get an overview of all images.\n\nMasonry layout\n\nThe main difference between the Masonry layout and the grid layout is that the images are displayed much larger and the arrangement is \"fluid\". One preview image after the other â this makes the gallery look prettier overall, but may also be a bit more confusing. The layout is therefore perfect for private clients, e.g. weddings, where presentation is more important than selection and quick comparison of similar images. Especially in combination with the large header image (also included in the Pro plan) your galleries will look much more impressive.\n\nList layout\n\nThe list view is intended for fast file exchange between professionals working together on a project. If you're looking for a file with specific attributes such as dimensions or file type, this view is great for sharing with post-producers or staff who know exactly what they're looking for and need quick access to it. We recommend that you sort the view in the gallery settings so that the last upload is always on top.\n\nGet the layouts\n\nYou can switch between the layouts in each gallery in the Pro and Business Plan.\n\nUpgrade your account to one of those plans right here!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWho can see my entire gallery overview?\n\nJust you. No one else.\n\nTo share galleries with third parties, you should always send the direct link to the desired gallery.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I integrate picdrop on my website?\n\nOf course, you can use picdrop under your domain and with your logo etc. If you want, none of your clients will notice that you use our service for your work. You can find more information in your account settings.\n\nWeb-integration: your picdrop galleries under your domain\n\nWith picdropâs web-integration you can run picdrop under your own domain so that we remain invisible to your clients.\n\nThe web integration will transform your picdrop URL www.picdrop.com/maxmiller/gallery to your own domain, e. g. maxmiller.com/client/gallery.\n\nYou can finde the neccessary files right here. And here is our instatllation manual for the web-integration.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhy does picdrop cost money?\n\nWith picdrop we would like to offer you a reliable service on which you can depend 100%.\n\nWe ourselves have seen, used and loved many tools that unfortunately had to stop working after a while because they only concentrated on popularity or great features rather than on how they can finance themselves and pay the next server bill. We do not speculate on being bought by an internet giant for millions of euros on day. Instead, we want to offer you a great service that you like to pay for. This is the only way to ensure that picdrop will remain for many years to come. Therefore, that's why picdrop costs money.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nDetails about the picdrop Business Plan\n\nOur Business plan is the best way to work together with all your image and video files as a team.\n\nOur Business plan includes all the advanced features of picdrop. Additionally, this plan allows you to invite multiple team members into your picdrop account to be able to work together, smarter and more effectively.\n\nYour advantages with the Business plan:\n\nCollaboration:Â Invite specific team members to your picdrop account and manage your files together.\n\nIntegration of third parties:Â Give your image & video suppliers, agencies and freelancers individual access for smooth collaboration.\n\nControl:Â With individual access rights, you can control who can access which data and collaborate on your projects.\n\nReal-time communication:Â Work together internally and externally with selections, comments, agreements on color flags etc.\n\nAvailability:Â Give your team access to your data from anywhere. Coordinate with colleagues - mobile or on desktop, without any installation.\n\nSmooth transfer:Â Send and receive all common image formats - simply by dragging & dropping them in your browser.\n\nExternal provision:Â Send image collections e.g. for PR/press purposes.\n\nTime saving:Â Smart voting tools save valuable time for your team.\n\nAutomatic archive:Â Store all assets permanently on up to 1 TB of storage, expandable at any time.\n\nSecurity:Â Your data is protected in the cloud. Insecure, local installations are no longer necessary.\n\nGerman data protection:Â Of course picdrop works DSGVO compliant.\n\nThe picdrop Business plan S already includes 3 team members, Business M includes up to 10 team members and Business L up to 15 team members. Further team member accesses and more storage can be booked flexibly with the Business XL plan at any time. You can find an overview of our Business plans here.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I set up multiple admin logins (e.g. for my employees or team members)?\n\nYou can use team members to invite other people to collaborate in your picdrop account.\n\nYou can invite one team member on the Pro+ plan. With our Business plan, it's possible to work with even more people in one picdrop account.\n\nYou can find more information about how team members work here.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I sell pictures or order prints via picdrop?\n\nNo. With picdrop we want to offer a lean, perfect service for the selection and transfer of image and video files. Selling images / videos and ordering prints is a very large, complex area that other vendors are already doing well and is not on our agenda.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do my clients get to their galleries? Do they need an account?\n\nYour clients do not need an account or login.\n\nNevertheless, there are two different, easy ways to send galleries to your clients.\n\nDirectly\n\nSend your clients the direct URL to your gallery - they don't need to log in unless you have set a gallery password in the gallery settings. This is the fastest, most convenient and most used way.\n\nYou can send the address to them by e-mail, messenger, etc. Or conveniently via picdrop by clicking on \"Share\" in your gallery.\n\nVia client login\n\nYou can create clients logins in your account settings. You can set a login and assign it to one or more galleries to which your client will have access. Afterward, you point your client to your picdrop URL (https://www.picdrop.com/your-username). There he/she will find a login field in which he/she only has to enter his/her password. After the successful login, your client will see an overview of all the galleries that have been activated for him/her. It is important to understand that the client login has nothing to do with the password of a single gallery.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to know that noone is able to see your gallery overview. This overview is reserved for you, as the account owner only. Therefore, it makes no sense to refer clients to your own picdrop URL unless you have created a client login for them.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan you design and program a portfolio website for me?\n\nNo, unfortunately we don't offer such a service.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I set the functions and look for a gallery?\n\nIn each of your galleries, you can activate or deactivate all functions individually. You can tailor your galleries perfectly to every client and every project. You are able to do this in each gallery in the upper right corner under âGallery Settingsâ.\n\nGeneral settings\n\nWelcome Message:Â Here you can welcome your clients to their picdrop gallery or give them specific instructions along the way. The text will always be displayed on top of the gallery.\n\nDownloads: Here you can specify whether your clients may or may not download your original files.\n\nArrangement:Â Here you select how your files will be sorted: by file name, capture time, upload time, file type, file size, and image dimensions. You can also group all images by color flags or file type.\n\nYou can also decide if your clients should be able toÂ navigate to sub-galleries and vice versa.\n\npicdrop is available in English and German, here you can define in whichÂ languageÂ your clients should see picdrop. If you do not set anything, picdrop automatically detects the browser language of your clients and then displays the gallery in German or in English.\n\nIf you want to change the header image you can find detailed instructions right here.\n\nEdit Mode\n\npicdropâs Edit Mode is for collaborating and communicating with your clients. Here you can decide what your clients can do.\n\nLayout:Â Here you define the appearance of your gallery and how your files should be arranged.\n\nFile information:Â Choose what your clients can see when clicking on a single file.\n\nPicture selections:Â With the picture selection function you can set specific photos in a gallery. With a click on the blue + at the upper left edge of the preview picture, the file is added to a set of selections. After completing an image selection, it must be saved and named.\n\nColor flags:Â Color flags allow you to quickly and easily make assessments and decisions with your clients. You can find the color flags in two places: at the top right of the small preview images in the gallery and in the large single image display directly below the image. Click to open the color flag menu. Here you can choose from the colors red = no, orange = maybe, green = yes and black = FINAL. You can also customize the names for the color flags.\n\n(Pro-Tip:Â Sort the images in the âAppearanceâ area by color markers and downwards. This automatically sorts your images in the overview according to color and displays them separately, which makes it extremely easy to filter out favorites.)\n\nComments:Â By activating the comments your clients have the possibility to write comments on each file in the gallery. The comments will be displayed at the bottom left of the files and can be created in the same place.\n\nImage annotations: Scribbles let your clients draw their comments into the images.\n\nClient upload:Â If you want your clients toÂ uploadÂ files to the gallery as easily as you can, then activate the client upload.\n\nPrint contact sheet:Â For further coordination, you can also activate the option for your clients to print a contact sheet.\n\nPresentation Mode\n\nTheÂ Presentation ModeÂ is a specific way for you to deliver a gallery to your clients. It focuses on the beautiful presentation of your pictures and videos and puts the practical picdrop functions in the background. The Presentation Mode is available for you in someÂ plansÂ (starting with Pro). All features of the Presentation Mode are also available in detail in ourÂ FAQ.\n\nStarting the gallery in Presentation Mode:Â The essential setting for the Presentation Mode is its activation/deactivation.\n\nSince some of the familiar picdrop functions are not active in the Presentation Mode, if you would still like to use these functions with your clients, you should activate theÂ switch to Edit Mode.Â You can apply this change by entering a 4-6 digit PIN number.\n\nYou can hideÂ red marked images / videos in the Presentation Mode from the gallery,Â so you can only present the best results.\n\nBelow these three functions, you find are all the settings with which you can customize theÂ appearanceÂ of the gallery in Presentation Mode: beingÂ background color,Â appearance of the header image, as well asÂ size,Â spacingÂ andÂ edgesÂ of yourÂ thumbnails. All other gallery components such as buttons and social links conveniently adapt to your settings for the appearance of the gallery.\n\nYou can find more detailed information in our separate FAQ articles aboutÂ gallery design,Â background color,Â title settings, setting a galleryâs header imgage andÂ thumbnail settings.\n\nSecurity\n\nHere you are able to protect your pictures with aÂ watermarkÂ andÂ password. But above all, you can specify the address at which your gallery should be accessible.\n\nGallery Links: There are several ways your gallery links can look. For each gallery, we always create an externally available, secure link first, which consists of a randomly generated string of letters and numbers. In addition, you have the opportunity to edit the link individually and enter the wording that you would like to use for the custom link to the gallery instead of using the random string. By clicking on the \"Insert gallery path as custom link\" button, you can also select the gallery name and gallery path as link wording. If you set your gallery as private, it will only be visible to you as an account owner and to client logins.\n\nPassword:Â Regardless of the shape of the gallery link, you can create or have an additional gallery password created for each gallery. We generally recommend this additional step to secure the gallery to all our users.\n\nWatermark:Â To protect your pictures, you can activate the picdrop watermark function. For this purpose, enter one or more desired watermarks in your account settings, for example with your logo. These can then be selected in the gallery settings.\n\nPlease note: Activating and disabling watermarks for a gallery can take some time. Please be patient while the function is applied before making any other adjustments to the gallery settings. It is also important to know that we do not overwrite the watermarks on your original pictures since we will never change your files. Instead, we put the watermark over the thumbnails so they are protected from screenshots. Even though watermarks are enabled, the original files can be downloaded. Make sure to deselect download as a function in the gallery settings.\n\nDonât forget to save!\n\nIf you have set everything, you can save your settings by clicking on âApply Changesâ. To make sure that your clients gets exactly the settings you expect, selectÂ âClient Viewâ in the top right corner to see how your clients will see the gallery!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhere can I find the picdrop app for smartphones?\n\nA picdrop app is not necessary. Instead, you can use our mobile version and place it on your smartphone as an app icon. (This way offers the same functions as an app would offer, but saves us the effort of developing several apps for different smartphone operating systems in parallel. Also you as a photographer don't have to install another app.\n\nJust put the link to your gallery overview or to a single gallery directly with a shortcut on your smartphone. After that you can call picdrop with one \"click\" and it feels like an app.\n\nIs there an app for my clients?\n\nYour clients can \"drop\" their galleries on their phone in the same way. All they need to do is open their gallery and follow the instructions below for their Android or iOS device.\n\nInstructions: picdrop quick access on Android\n\nJust follow these 4 steps:\n\nOpen overview or gallery\n\nOpen the menu in the upper right corner and click on \"Add to home screen\".\n\nGive the icon a name and click on \"Add\".\n\nPosition the icon on your home screen by pressing and holding it or click on \"Automatically add\".\n\nInstructions: picdrop quick access on iOS (only with Safari Browser)\n\nJust follow these 3 steps on when you are on your dashboard:\n\nClick on the Share icon at the bottom center of the screen\n\nFrom the options, select \"Add to Home Screen\"\n\nGive it a name and click on \"Add\"\n\nLink to this entry\n\nBye bye, Plain Links! Hello, Custom Links!\n\nWith today's update (16.11.21), you can create individual \"custom links\" independently of the gallery name. Sharing new galleries via the previous \"plain links\" linked to the gallery names will no longer be possible. Existing galleries with active plain links can still be opened until December 15th. To increase the security of your galleries, we take a logical step here.\n\nRead more about what you can and should do to ensure that your clients can still access their galleries in this article.\n\nPlain links? What are Plain Links?\n\nPlain Links are links that don't look like this: picdrop.com/username/3zj7uG6ZR, but for example like this: picdrop.com/username/grandmas-birthday.Â\n\nIn the security settings of your galleries you could choose between both variants. The Plain Link variant was used to get more readable URLs. However, for the last 4 years the second variant, the \"secure link\", is the default setting for all new picdrop users.\n\nSo if you are part of the majority of our users who always use the \"secure link\" to share galleries, you can stop reading here. Nothing will change for you!\n\nYou are using Plain Links?\n\nIf you use Plain Links regularly or have used them in the past, please note that these plain links will STOP working as of Wednesday, December 15th. This also applies to links that have already been sent. If you currently sent out links to clients, you have 2 options:\n\nYou can send a new (secure) link to your clients. Or â¦Â\n\nYou can create a new Custom Link for the gallery.Â\n\nGo to the gallery settings and edit the Custom Link according to your wishes. You can e.g. use the gallery name as before or enter a completely individual name. Please note, however, that this link is then again less secure than the randomly generated link. To increase security, we strongly advise you to always set a password as well.\n\nThe security of your data is important to us\n\nAt picdrop we regularly take security precautions, check our application for improvement possibilities and implement them. In the security settings of each gallery we inform you that Plain Links are not as secure as the \"secure links\" and can be \"guessed\". Until now, we have relied more on your personal responsibility in deciding which link you choose and let all photographers decide for themselves what type of link you want to use for your galleries. In the future, we want to support you even more and hope that users will use this function much more consciously than before.\n\nHow can I still send pretty, more readable links?\n\nYes, the time of automatically generated links Plain Links is over - unless you consciously decide to keep using them. In this case you can now edit the address of the link by clicking into the address field and name it individually. This is a new option with a similar result: a readable text link. So you can still create nice URLs for galleries that should be public, for example. But now you are no longer locked into automatically using the name of the gallery as the link! This way you can make sure that a link you sent to your clients in the last days remains available after the change on December 15th.Â\n\nI have a lot of plain links that need to remain accessible. What now?\n\nOf course, we know that in some cases there are a lot of plain links that need to continue working under their old address. In cases where the number of links is too large to check the settings yourself, or where you do not have an exact overview, we are happy to help. Please contact us atÂ hello@picdrop.comÂ so that we can work with you to convert your old plain link galleries to the new custom links. We are happy to help you!\n\nThe upcoming changes in a nutshell\n\nYou are using only secure links for your galleries?Â Everything stays as it is and there is nothing for you to do!\n\nYou have been using Plain Links for your galleries?Â As of December 15th your galleries will no longer be accessible via the Plain Link.\n\nWhat do I have to do now?Â The easiest way is to send your clients the new randomly generated link to the gallery.Â Alternatively you can edit this link in the security settings of each gallery (and thus make the old link usable again). It's best to set a password for the gallery at the same time, if it doesn't have one yet.\n\nI still have questions.\n\nNo problem! Write us at hello@picdrop.com and we will be happy to answer all your questions.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhich notifications do I receive by e-mail?\n\nGeneral notifications\n\npicdrop will send you a notification for\n\nnew comments on your files\n\nnew or changed color flagsÂ\n\nsaved sets\n\ndownloads\n\nnew invoices\n\ngeneral news about picdrop\n\nNotifications are always sent to the email address that is used to sign-in to your picdrop account. You can customize your notification settings right here: Notifications\n\nUpload notifications\n\nWe also send notifications about uploads to your galleries.\n\nNotifications for uploads cannot be deactivated. We donât want to spam your inbox with e-mails about every quick upload, though. We will only send you an e-mail for your own uploads if the upload took more than 10 minutes.\n\nWhen clients upload files to one of your galleries (the client upload must be activated for this to work), we always send an e-mail to you â no matter how long the upload took. We want you to know about it in any case!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nI have received an email and I am not sure if it's from picdrop\n\nYou have received an email and you are not sure if it was really sent by picdrop?\n\nHere you will find everything you need to know and steps on how best to proceed:\n\nPlease check the sender of the email first. Is it the same sender that you typically receive picdrop notifications and news from? Our emailsÂ alwaysÂ come fromÂ hello@picdrop.com or no-reply@picdrop.com.Â Please be careful that it's not an unusual email address that you haven't seen before.\n\nAre you prompted to enter your picdrop login details?Â We willÂ neverÂ ask you to enter your login information on any site other thanÂ https://www.picdrop.de or https://www.picdrop.com.\n\nAre you still unsure?Â Please contact our support atÂ hello@picdrop.com, we can assure you which emails we have sent and which we have not.\n\nWhy should I even doubt emails that look like picdrop?\n\nOn November 2018, picdrop became aware of emails and a fake website trying to pick up user data on our behalf. These were so-called phishing emails.\n\nWhat are phishing emails?\n\nWith phishing, users are lured to fake websites by receiving emails that are often confusingly similar to emails from well-known providers. On these pages, which usually have exactly the same look as the pages and emails they are supposed to imitate, login data is queried. This serves the purpose of \"fishing\" this data so that the perpetrator can then use it elsewhere. Hence the term \"phishing\".\n\nKeywords: email, phishing, security, password\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhich browsers are compatible with picdrop?\n\nIn principle, you don't really need to worry about it. picdrop always supports theÂ last three versionsÂ of the most popular browsers. These versions include all modern and up-to-date browsers that are currently in circulation and are used by a very large proportion of users. The used browser should, therefore, be compatible with picdrop for you and your clients.\n\nA detailed list of the browsers picdrop gets along with, you can still find here:\n\nTheÂ desktop versionÂ works with:\n\nGoogle ChromeÂ version 109 or higher\n\nSafariÂ version 15.6 or higher\n\nEdgeÂ version 121 or higher\n\nFirefoxÂ version 122 or higher\n\nThe following browsers can be used in theirÂ mobile versionÂ with picdrop:\n\nSafari iOSÂ version 16.6 or higher\n\nChrome for AndroidÂ version 124 or higher\n\nFirefox for AndroidÂ version 125 or higher\n\nSamsung InternetÂ version 21 or higher\n\nand theÂ UC Browser for AndroidÂ version 15.5 or higher\n\nLink to this entry\n\nIs there an English version?\n\nYes, of course!\n\nFor yourself, as the admin of a picdrop account, you can switch the language of your account right here in your settings: Userdata & Password\n\nWhen sending a gallery link to your clients the language of the gallery will automatically switch between English and German depending on the browser of your clients.\n\nIf they use a non-German browser, the gallery will be automatically displayed in English. You don't have to do anything. If you want to be on the safe side, you can also set the language in your gallery settings and your clients will always see the galleries in English, no matter what language their computer or browser is set to.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow can I see what's happening in my galleries?\n\nIn your picdrop account you will always find the Activities in the top right-hand corner so you can see what is happening in your galleries at any time.\n\nThe red number indicates that there is news in your account.\n\nIn the Activities you will find\n\nall visits\n\nall uploads and downloads\n\ninformation on updated (= re-uploaded) files\n\nComments and Scribbles\n\nnew and changed Color Flags\n\nchanges to Selections / Sets\n\nnew and changed Likes\n\nthe creation date (at the bottom)\n\nin your galleries.\n\nNo matter where you are currently working in your account, when you call up the Activities, you will always see the events for all your galleries.\n\nIf you are in a gallery, you can restrict the display to the current gallery using the button at the top right (\"Show current gallery only\").\n\nWith the three options to the left, you can specify whose actions you want to see: all your own actions, actions from your Team Members or actions from all other visitors to your gallery. You can combine these filters as you wish to get the overview you need.\n\nTwo more practical tips:\n\nIn your own actions, for example, you can find the upload dates for each image and track the creation date of the gallery.\n\nMove the mouse over the relative date displayed (e.g. yesterday, 2 weeks ago) and you will see the exact time for the event.\n\nThe Activities will keep you updated about whatâs happening in your galleries. You can also get notifications via email for some of those Activities.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nOur pricing model for the video function\n\nOur video function with streaming, preview image & quick preview is included in the Pro and Business plans. Users of the (old) Studio plan and users in the Test month can also use the video functions to the same extent as Pro plan users. Lite and Free users can continue to upload and download video files to their account.\n\nEach video must first be processed so that it can be played directly in picdrop. It is important to know that once a video has been processed, it can be played again and again in the account without any restrictions. There is a monthly processing volume for the Pro and Business plan:\n\nThe Pro plan includes 60 minutes of processing volume per calendar month.\n\nThe Business plan includes 120 minutes of processing volume per calendar month.\n\nIn addition, the length of streamable videos is limited:\n\nto 15 minutes length in the Pro plan and\n\nto 30 minutes in the Business plan\n\nAll longer videos get the preview image, the animated preview and can be up- and downloaded, but are not directly playable in picdrop.\n\nThis pricing model is the attempt to not raise prices for our plans but also cover the costs of the new video function in picdrop. We reserve the right to make further adjustments in the future.\n\nIf you have reached your monthly conversion limit on the Pro plan, you can find information on how to increase your monthly conversion volume here.\n\nThank you for your understanding!\n\nLink to this entry\n\npicdrop Likes - use our voting feature\n\nWhat is our Like feature in picdrop?\n\nThe likes are intended to help you and your clients - or you and your team - to vote on which image is rated best by a larger number of people. If several people are working in a gallery and an image or several images with the \"highest common denominator\" need to be found, the likes are the thing to work with!\n\nFor a quick coordination where only one person in a gallery determines their favorites, however, the color flags are better suited.\n\nHow do likes work in picdrop?\n\nTo activate the likes, simply proceed as follows:\n\ngo to the settings of your gallery and you can activate the likes, this can be done in the tab of the edit mode under the item Likes & Voting (1) - don't forget to save the gallery settings afterwards (2).\n\nOnce you have done this, your pictures can now be given likes. A small heart symbol will appear on each image when you or your clients hover over it with the cursor. With every picture that is liked, the number of likes for this picture increases and your clients' favorites quickly become visible.\n\nAnd afterwards?\n\nExport selected images to Lightroom, Capture One, Finder, Explorer and more\n\nAs usual, selected images can be exported to Lightroom, Capture One, Finder or Windows Explorer with just a few clicks. This saves valuable time! You can find more information in our article on the export function.\n\nNotifications about new likes\n\nTo find out if your clients like your pictures, simply click on the notifications in the top bar of your account. We've added the likes there to make it as easy as possible for you to stay up to date.\n\nSorting by number of likes\n\nTo make it even easier for your clients to find their way around, activate automatic sorting by likes in your settings in addition to the likes. Your images in the gallery are then sorted in real time with each like. The more likes a photo receives, the higher its position in the gallery. We recommend that you let your clients know if you have switched on real-time sorting to avoid misunderstandings due to the \"moving\" images. Of course, you can also sort or filter by likes as usual in the filter bar on the left-hand side without having preset this arrangement in the settings.\n\nOnly show pictures with likes\n\nIb the left-hand filter bar, you can now not only filter by pictures with likes and only display these, but also sort all pictures by their number of likes. To do so, simply click on the heart in the filter bar or select \"Likes\" in the sorting.\n\nAs you can see, working with Likes is easy as pie and if you still have any questions about this feature, just get in touch with our support team and we'll be happy to help you!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nThe picdrop video function: Video streaming, quick preview and thumbnail - the most important at a glance\n\nOur picdrop video function with streaming, quick preview & preview image is included in the Pro and Business plans, as well as in the Test month and the (old) Studio plan. Lite and Free users can upload and download videos to their account.Â\n\nHere you can find an overview of all supported video formats.\n\nFurthermore, you can find more information about the different limits of the video function in our plans here.\n\nVideo streaming allows you and your clients to play video files directly in picdrop. Each video must be processed first to be playable. Once uploaded and processed, your videos can be played as many times as you and your clients want. Processing your video file into a playable video in picdrop takes about one minute per minute of video. So have a little patience please.\n\nYour video files also display a preview thumbnail that we create directly from the file.Â\n\nAnd that's not all: we also show a quick preview for your video files when you or your clients move the mouse over the file. From left to right, you can scroll through the quick preview by moving the mouse. The quick preview and the thumbnail give you and your clients a good impression of your files and make it easy for everyone to (re)find a desired video file quickly in the gallery.\n\nIf you have problems playing a video, we have compiled an article on possible causes here.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact our support team. Simply send us an e-mail to hello@picdrop.com\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhy can my video not be played?\n\nThere are many different reasons why a video cannot be played in your picdrop account.\n\nBelow you will find a list of possible reasons:\n\nyour video has not finished processing and is therefore not ready to be played yet.\n\nyour monthly processing volume for videos has been reached for your account. You can check in your account preferences if this is the case.\n\nit is a video from the time before the introduction of the video support. To make the video playable, you need to re-upload it.\n\nyour video is too long and exceeds the playability limit for your plan.\n\nyour video file comes in a format that we don't support. Here you can find a list of all file formats supported in picdrop.\n\nanother error has occurred.\n\n1. your video has not been processed yet\n\nIf you upload a new video and your plan limit allows the processing of a streamable video, picdrop will automatically process different versions of your video, which can then be streamed in your gallery with one click.Â\n\nThis process is very time-consuming and takes about 1 minute per minute of uploaded video material. After the processing is finished, your video is automatically updated and streamable with one click.\n\n2. your monthly processing volume has been exceeded\n\nYour plan includes a maximum monthly volume of video minutes that can be automatically processed into a streamable video after an upload. The maximum amount of video minutes that can be processed within your plan can be checked in your account preferences. Here you will also find information about the minutes you have already used. If you have already used all your video processing minutes included in your plan, your volume will be topped up again on the 1st of the next calendar month â or you can simply book more monthly video minutes.\n\n3. it is a video from the time before the introduction of the video support\n\nThe video feature in picdrop was introduced in November 2022. Videos uploaded before that date cannot be streamed. If you want an existing video to be streamable and you are on a plan that includes video streaming you can easily download the video using the download button and then re-upload it. It will then be considered a new video and will be newly processed and made streamable. Please note that the processing of the streamable version will then be deducted from your monthly volume of video processing minutes (see 2.).\n\n4. your video is too long and exceeds the streaming limit for your plan\n\nDepending on which picdrop plan you use, there is a time limit on how long a video can be to be playable in picdrop. This limit lies at 15 minutes for the Pro plan and 30 minutes for the Business plan. If your video file exceeds this time limit, streaming in picdrop is not possible. In order to watch the video your clients will then have to download it from picdrop first.\n\n5. the file format of your video does not belong to the supported file formats in picdrop\n\nIn our list of supported file formats you will find an overview of all video formats that picdrop currently supports. Please note that a file extension does not necessarily indicate which codec was used to encode a video.Â\n\n6. another error has occurred\n\nNobody is infallible - not even us. If none of the given solutions fit your problem, please write us at hello@picdrop.com and tell us the link to the gallery and the file name directly. We will then take a closer look. Thank you!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nUsing picdrop\n\nHow can I activate Scribbles to leave comments in an image?\n\nGo to the settings of your gallery. There you will find the option to activate scribbles in the following location:\n\nEdit Mode â Comments â Image annotations\n\nYou must first activate the comments so that you can activate Scribbles, as each Scribble needs a comment to be saved.Â\n\nAfter that, Scribbles in this gallery can be used in Edit Mode in the desktop version of picdrop. In the mobile version of picdrop on smartphones and tablets, you can see the comments and Scribbles, but you cannot currently change them or create new ones.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow to use Scribbles in picdrop?\n\n1 â activating Scribbles & starting Scribble Mode\n\nActivate Scribbles in the gallery settings under Edit Mode â Comments â Image annotations. Back in the gallery, click on an image to open the large single image view.Â\n\nBelow the image you will find the Scribble button to activate Scribble Mode.Â\n\nYou can also press X on your keyboard to start Scribble Mode.Â\n\nThe blue frame around the images indicates that Scribble Mode is activated.\n\n2 â creating Scribbles\n\nNow click with your mouse on a spot in the image to create a small circular shape in the image.Â\n\nOr hold down the left mouse button and freely draw any shape in the image.Â\n\nYou can undo the last steps of your Scribble by using the Undo button at the bottom left.Â\n\nOr you can use the backspace key on your keyboard.\n\n3 â saving Scribbles\n\nClick on the Comment and Save button at the bottom right to save your Scribble.Â\n\nYou still need to enter a name and a comment and confirm the whole thing with Save Scribble at the bottom right.\n\nTada: The Scribble is saved on the image and visible to all visitors to the gallery.\n\nYou will find the comment on the scribble in the comment bar on the left.Â\n\n4 â working with Scribbles\n\nIf you move the mouse over the scribble in the image, the corresponding comment will be highlighted. And of course it works the other way around too: if you move the mouse over a comment that belongs to a scribble, the scribble in the image will be highlighted.\n\nIf you are bothered by the scribbles in the image, for example because they are covering important areas, you can show or hide them by clicking the button at the top left of the comment column. Don't worry, the scribbles will not be deleted.Â\n\nIf you want to delete scribbles, you can do so using the trash can icon next to the scribble comment.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nCan I draw annotations directly into my images? or: What are scribbles?\n\nWith Scribbles, you and your customers can draw comments and annotations directly into the images in a gallery. Scribbles are displayed on the image and saved together with a comment, making them visible to all visitors to the gallery.\n\nScribbles are the perfect tool for marking retouching requests in an exact location, leaving post-production instructions for certain areas of the image or simply for drawing ideas and thoughts into the image.Â\n\nYou can either place a circle in the image or draw your own shapes freely with the pen tool.Â\n\nThis is what Scribbles look like:\n\nScribbles can be created and changed in the desktop version of picdrop.Â In the mobile version of picdrop on tablets and smartphones, you can view scribbles and their comments.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I prevent visitors from seeing the sub-galleries of a gallery?\n\nTo ensure that visitors of a gallery do not have access to existing sub-galleries, the item \"View Sub-Galleries\" in the parent gallery must be inactive. Thus no one in the parent gallery can see the lower galleries - and vice versa.\n\nSee also: How do I prevent visitors to a gallery from accessing the parent gallery?\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I prevent visitors to a gallery from accessing the parent gallery?\n\nTo ensure that visitors to a sub-gallery in the left menu do not have access to the parent gallery, the option \"Navigation to sub-galleries and vice versa\" must be inactive in this parent gallery. Therefore, no one in the parent gallery can see the sub-galleries - and vice versa.\n\nAre you using Custom Links for your gallries? In order to additionally prevent a \"clever\" visitor from shortening the address of a sub-gallery by one level and still being able to access the parent gallery, we recommend only using the automatically generated random link. This link consists of only one random code and does not allow any conclusions on your folder structure. You can find it in the \"Send\" section.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I use color flags?\n\nYou can find the color flags above each preview in the edit mode of your galleries. You also find them below each preview in the large single file view.\n\nColor flags can support the different stages of your editing or selection process. Just like you are used to in other photography apps and tools.\n\nFor example, you can use the color âgreen = yesâ to mark files that you consider to be finished, and your clients can set them to âblack = finalâ if they agree. Or they can mark files âorange = maybeâ again if there are still changes to be made. Of course, this is just one example of the many ways you can use the color flags.\n\nIt is possible to give the color flags their own names. You can also hide individual color flags if you and your clients don't need them.\n\nWith these flexible settings you can set up your workflow exactly the way it suits you and your clients.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nColor flags or selections â which one is better?\n\nWhen is the best time to use color flags?\n\npicdropâs color flags are a very simple and quick way to mark those files that you want to use or select in the end.\n\nThey are primarily suitable â¦\n\nWhen onlyÂ one person should workÂ on a selection. To get started, it requires no training and you can mark files directly. However. that also means color flags can be overridden at any time - and by every visitor to the gallery. So it's a good idea to use the color flags if you are only working with one client in the gallery.\n\nTo \"narrow down\"Â a selection. For example, the client can mark his first favorites \"orange\", use \"green\" as the favorites of that selection and \"red\" for pictures that should not be used. Therefore your client gets through the selection step by step and can approach the final decision.\n\nPro Tip #1:Â You can set the gallery up in a way that all the files get grouped by color. This way the color flags will also be visually separated for your clients.\n\nForÂ fast, real-time voting,Â for example, while on the phone or via Skype. Color flags are immediately visible on any computer or smartphone on which the gallery is open. This makes them very well suited to make direct arrangements that the counterpart should see in real time.\n\nThey are not suitable â¦\n\nToÂ map selections of multiple people in a gallery.Â If several people are to express their opinion on a set of files, the color flags often get in the way.Â One file can only have one color flag at the time. This means that multiple people using color flags in one gallery will always overwrite each others color flags. Â Therefore, we advise against the use of color flags when working with several people in a gallery.\n\nWhen is the best time to use the selection function?\n\npicdrop's selection function helps you capture and store multiple views of your clients in a gallery. Your clients use them best to set final favorites in a gallery. One of the most important things in creating a picture selection is remembering to save and name them. Therefore nothing stands in the way of further work with the selection.\n\nIt is best suited â¦\n\nIfÂ several clientsÂ shouldÂ select pictures.Â You have shared the picdrop gallery link with several clients and they should each give their assessment of the pictures. Each picture can be selected several times.\n\nTo setÂ several selections for different purposes.Â An endless number of selections can be created in a gallery do not affect the overall gallery. However, the selections should then be named accordingly, so that you can identify them to the respective client or purpose.\n\nPro Tip #2:Â Selections can be moved and copied to a different gallery with just a few clicks.\n\nToÂ finalizeÂ a selection. By creating a selection your clients can easily tell you which files are for final editing or go to print.\n\nIt is not suitable â¦\n\nAs aÂ step by step selection.Â However, the color markings and their filter options are simply clearer and intuitively understandable for your clients due to the color scheme.\n\nForÂ real-time coordinationÂ with your client. In order to make arrangements with your client in real time, the selection tool is a bit cumbersome, better to use the color flags.\n\nPro Tip #3: With the Shift key held down, you can click the left mouse button anywhere in the voting mode and draw a blue selection frame. Any file inside the frame will automatically end up in your selection bar at the bottom. More shortcuts can be found here.\n\nWhy shouldn't both be activated at the same time?\n\nIn general, we recommend to enable only one of them (either color flags or selections) per gallery for your clients. This prevents misunderstandings and confusion when using picdrop.\n\nIn conclusion, the color flags should be used as temporary markers. Selections are saved file sets that you can recall at any time to continue working in the gallery.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow can I rename a color flag?\n\nThe color flags are available in green, orange, red and black. In the default settings, they are named yes, no, maybe and final.\n\nStarting with the Pro plan, you can customize the color flags to fit your own workflow and make it perfectly clear to your clients what a color flag means: to do this, you can change the name of the color in the Color flags section of your Default Gallery Settings.\n\nA possible version could look like this:\n\nPlease do not forget to save the new names for your color flags.\n\nThe name you assign to your color flags will then be displayed to you and your clients on every file that has that color flag.\n\nPlease note: Renaming your color flags will affect all color flags in your picdrop account. Even existing color flags in previous galleries will be labeled with the new name after saving.Â\n\nYou don't want to use all four color flags? You only want to activate some of them? This is also possible! You can find more information here.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I hide individual color flags in my account?\n\nThe default settings for your picdrop account include four color flags: red, orange, green and black. They are named no, maybe, yes and final.\n\nIf you want to use color flags in your workflow, e.g. only for a simple YES or NO for individual files, you can always deactivate those colors you don't need in the gallery preferences:\n\nUncheck the blue checkbox in front of the color flag, like done in the screenshot for the orange and the black color flag. They will then no longer be displayed in all your galleries (including existing ones).\n\nDon't worry: if you have accidentally hidden a color flag, you can of course re-activate it. All files that already had this color flag will keep this color flag.Â\n\nYou want to change the names of the color flags like in the screenshot? You can find the instructions here.\n\nBy the way, you can use the function for hiding individual color flags - just like Presentation Mode - starting with the Pro plan.\n\nPS: The red color flag cannot be deactivated. It is needed so that your clients can hide red marked files in Presentation Mode. You can find out how to do this here.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I download images to an iPad or iPhone? (iOS)\n\nUnfortunately, storing files on Apple mobile devices is not as easy as it is on Android devices. Unfortunately, we have no influence on that. But we want to make it as easy as possible for you and your clients with this guide. Basically, we recommend downloading rather on PC/Macs and not necessarily on mobile devices because our preview function in the galleries on mobile devices is good enough and it makes no difference for your clients if they have downloaded the pictures or not, as long as their mobile device is online and you leave the gallery online for them.\n\nOption 1: Save a single file\n\n1. open the file in the gallery\n\n2.Â click on the download button\n\n3. the download screen opens and tells you what's next\n\n4. tap and hold to save it (Haptic Touch) and then press \"Add to Photos\".\n\nThe file is now automatically saved in your \"Photos app\". You can then find and open it at any time using the Photos app.\n\nOption 2: Save all files of a gallery as ZIP\n\n1. open the gallery\n\n2. click on the 3 dots in the bottom right corner and choose \"Download all files as ZIP\"\n\nor choose \"Download all files\" in the client view\n\n3. confirm the ZIP download in the pop-up menue\n\n4. go to the Downloads folder in the Files app on your Apple device.\n\nOpen the downloaded zip file with one click. In the same place, a folder will now open containing all the downloaded files.\n\nOpen this folder and click the Select button - you can now select all the files and save them from the Files app to the Photos app.\n\n(These steps apply for all downloads with devices that use iOS 13 or later versions. For all previous iOS versions, the following note still applies:\n\nafter downloading, your files contain a ZIP file. For further processing a ZIP file you or your client need an appropriate app to unpack the files into the Photos app. Winzip is a free tool, which we recommend :-)\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I change the default sharing text to send my galleries?\n\nIf you want to send a gallery to your clients, you can either copy & paste the link to the gallery and send it via any channel. Or you can send a mail using the \"Send\" button within the gallery. Here picdrop gives you a default general text, which fits every situation, but doesn't look very individual.\n\nIf you would like to make this text more personal, you can adjust it in theÂ account settings. Open the part \"Your sharing templates\" and click on \"Create new template\".\n\nThere you will see the standard text in an editor. In this editor you can customize the mail as you like and save it under a name. Beside the (only visible for you) name of the template and the subject the e-mail is divided into 4 areas:\n\nGreeting and beginning of the message\n\nNote to the gallery password\n\nNote on the PIN in the presentation mode\n\nEnd of the mail and farewell\n\nYou can freely edit points 1 and 4 and be creative. It is important that you do not forget to insert the placeholder for the gallery link. All placeholders are already included in our template. However, if you have deleted them and want to insert them again afterwards, you can place them again in the text at any time using the \"Insert placeholders\" function. Make sure that the placeholders for the \"Password\" and the \"PIN\" end up in the respective areas 2 and 3.\n\nYou can also freely edit the already mentioned areas 2 and 3.\n\nBut: It is important to know that these areas areÂ onlyÂ inserted into your mail when the respective function is active in the gallery to be sent. The sentence \"The password is \"password123\". (without quotation marks)\" is only inserted if a password is active in the gallery. This ensures that you will never forget to send the password for a gallery. picdrop takes care about it for you. The same applies to the PIN to switch to the Edit Mode. So it doesn't make sense to put these topics in item 1 or 4. Just keep them separate and leave the rest to picdrop.\n\nOf course you can create as many templates as you want. Afterwards you can open your templates in the \"Share\" area of each gallery with one click and save a lot of work with each gallery you send out. When sending, you can then decide whether you want to send the mail via your own mail program or via picdrop.\n\nThis function can be used from the Pro plan onwards.\n\nPlease note that many mail programs have a maximum character limit and these limits vary quite a bit. The length of the mail usually consists of recipient, subject and body. If your sharing template does not open in your mail program, it is possible that your template is too long - please shorten your sharing template text in this case.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow can I protect my images with watermarks?\n\nIn your account settings (\"Your watermarks\") you can upload your logo or other graphics and create multiple watermarks with just a few clicks. You can set the place for the watermark and adjust its size and opacity to your needs.\n\nDonât forget to \"Save & Close\" your new watermark settings.\n\nTo apply watermarks to all the images in a gallery just navigate to the gallery settings of each gallery. You can activate your watermarks in the \"Security\" section of your gallery settings.\n\nAfter you hit \"Apply Changes\" wait for a few seconds to see the watermarks appear on each preview image in your gallery. It couldn't be easier.\n\nNote: the watermarks will âonlyâ protect the thumbnails and previews in picdrop, so your clients canât take screenshots or steal the pictures in other ways. If you activate the download of the original images at the same time, these will not be protected by watermarks because picdrop will never modify your originally uploaded images.\n\nFind a German introduction video to our watermarks here:\n\nClick here to display this video from Youtube. This will load and transfer data from Youtube. For details, please check our Privacy Policy.\n\nIf contents from Youtube should always be displayed, please confirm this by ticking the checkbox.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhich keyboard shortcuts does picdrop support?\n\nWith picdrop you can also use shortcuts. This saves you a lot of time and it is also much easier for your clients to make a selection quickly. Here are the most important shortcuts and key combinations:\n\nIn single image view\n\nYou can use these keyboard shortcuts in the large image view:\n\n0 remove color flag 1 add red color flag 2 add orange color flag 3 add green color flag 4 add final flag L add / remove like S add file to selection X Scribble Mode D Download file M Magnifier R + Enter Delete file\n\nIn the overview of your gallery\n\nIn the overview of all files within a gallery, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts if you hover yourÂ mouse over a fileÂ at the same time without clicking on it.\n\n0 remove color flag 1 add red color flag 2 add orange color flag 3 add green color flag 4 add final flag i Show file info S Add file to selection D Download files Cmd + A Add all currently displayed files to selection Cmd + D Deselect all currently selected files\n\nPlease note, the mouse is not used for selecting/deselecting all files (last two shortcuts).\n\nSelect multiple images in combination with the left mouse button\n\nShift select files alt deselect files\n\nWith the Shift key held down, you can click the left mouse button anywhere in the voting mode and draw a blue selection frame. Any file inside the frame will automatically end up in your selection bar at the bottom.\n\nWith the alt key pressed, you can draw a red frame with the mouse, which works the other way around: all files in the red frame are removed from the current selection at the bottom of the screen.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I rename a gallery?\n\nThere are several ways to rename a gallery:\n\nOpen the gallery and click on the three dots right next to the gallery name on the left side of the screen. Click on \"rename\".\n\nIn the gallery overview (listing A-Z) move your mouse over one of the gallery previews on the right. Three dots will appear on the lower left side of the gallery. Chosse \"rename\" in this menu.\n\nOn the left side of your gallery overview, you will find a list of all your galleries. Hover above a gallery namen with your mose and the same three dots will appear. Simply clicke on \"rename\".\n\nPlease note that renaming a gallery will not change the external link of your gallery. If you want to change the external link you can find all the options in the gallery settings in the Security tab. You can find all the details here: The gallery settings in detail.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I delete a gallery?\n\nThere are three ways to delete a gallery from your picdrop account:\n\nOpen the corresponding gallery. At the top left you will find the gallery name and next to it a menu with three dots. Click on the three-dot menu and select \"Delete\".\n\nOn your dashboard you will find an alphabetically sorted list of all your galleries on the left. Hover over the name of the gallery you want to delete. On the right, you will find a three-dot menu where you can delete the gallery.\n\nOn the right-hand side of your gallery overview, you will see thumbnails of your galleries. Move the mouse over the preview of the gallery you want to delete. At the top right you will find the three-dot menu in which you can delete the gallery.\n\nImportant: You must be logged in to your picdrop account in order to delete galleries. It is not possible to delete a gallery as a visitor.\n\nHave you accidentally deleted a gallery? Don't worry! At the bottom left of your gallery overview you will find a recycle bin from which you can restore deleted galleries for a short period of time.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I change the gallery image?\n\nWhat are gallery images?\n\nEach gallery you create in picdrop can have a gallery image.\n\nYou see the gallery image as an icon for the gallery â just like a cover page.\n\nWhere are gallery images displayed? Who can see them?\n\nYou are logged in as admin in your picdrop account.\n\nThen you can see the gallery images here:\n\nfor each gallery in your gallery overview\n\nfor all sub-galleries within a gallery\n\nIn a gallery that contains subgalleries, visitors will see the gallery images for those subgalleries.\n\nIt looks like this for your customers:\n\nDo you work with client logins?\n\nThen your customers will also see the gallery images in their personal gallery overview after they have entered their access code.\n\nHow is the gallery image set automatically?\n\nWe always take the first image loaded into the gallery and automatically set it as the gallery image for you.\n\nGalleries that do not contain images therefore do not get an automatic gallery image. They will be displayed with a folder icon instead.\n\nThis happens e.g. with galleries that you use for better organization and that do not contain any images themselves, but only sub-galleries.\n\nHow can I change the gallery image?\n\nYou can set the gallery image yourself for each gallery â this means you overwrite the automatically created gallery image or you replace the folder icon for empty galleries with a better fitting image!\n\nYou can change the gallery image in these places:\n\n01 - Directly in the gallery\n\nClick on the three dots at the bottom of the desired image â select \"Set as gallery image\", confirm with the green Save button, done!\n\nIn the same menu you can also click on \"Upload image\" and set an image from your computer directly as a gallery image. You don't have to upload the image to the gallery.\n\nAs a gallery image you can use a picture that is not in the gallery itself.\n\n02 - In the gallery overview\n\nIn your gallery overview, click on the three dots at the bottom right of a gallery or next to the gallery name and select \"Set gallery image\". You can now upload an image from your hard drive as a gallery image â you don't have to upload the image to the gallery to do this.\n\nIf you want to use an image that is already in the gallery as a gallery image, see the description above at 01.\n\nOne more tip:\n\nIn the menu with the three dots of the gallery you can also delete an already existing gallery image â then the folder icon will be displayed. If you want to chose another gallery image you can do so as described in the sections 01 and 02 above.\n\nCan I change the crop for my gallery image?\n\nWe automatically choose a section directly from the center of the image for the gallery image. With a little trick you can create the exact fitting image and upload it as gallery image:\n\nExport from Lightroom (or any other program) an image with a crop in 16:9 format and at least 800px width - upload it as gallery image for your gallery directly from your computer. This way it will fit perfectly into the frame for the gallery image!\n\nOf course, this does not only work with photos: You can also upload your own designs, lettering, etc. as JPG or PNG and use them as gallery images!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I delete multiple images at once?\n\nTo delete multiple files at once, select the files and click on the delete icon in the lower right corner.\n\nTo select multiple files at once, press Shift, click the left mouse button and draw a blue selection frame anywhere in edit mode. Any file that is inside the frame will automatically go into your selection. The files in the selection can then be deleted with one click.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow can I change the order of my sub-galleries in the menu?\n\nThe sub-galleries of a gallery are automatically sorted alphabetically. In many cases it can be helpful to sort the sub-galleries indivdually. For weddings and other events, you may want to reflect the chronological sequence of events in the order of the sub-galleries.\n\nTo set the order of the sub-galleries, open the main gallery in which the sub-galleries are located.\n\nAs soon as the gallery has more than one sub-gallery, you will find a button for sorting right below the navigation window. Simply change the mode from \"Sort alphabetically\" to \"Sort manually\".\n\nNow you can freely determine the order of the sub-galleries using drag & drop.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nWhich link can be used to access my galleries externally?\n\nThe galleries in your picdrop account can be either private or externally available.\n\nPrivate galleries\n\nIf you set a gallery to private, this gallery will only be visible to you as the owner of the picdrop account when you are logged in.\n\nâ¦ or externally available galleries\n\nIf you set the gallery to be available externally (and this will be true in most cases, because you want your customers to be able to see their galleries), then we will always automatically create a randomly generated link for each gallery. This link consists of a random combination of numbers and letters.\n\nFor example, an externally available link may look like this: https://www.picdrop.com/username/sKdzPJbtGD\n\nYou would rather use a custom link for your gallery?\n\nNo problem - you can change the randomly generated link for a gallery at any time!\n\nJust type the desired name into the field for the custom link. Save the custom link with the button Apply Changes and from now on the gallery is only accessible via this custom link.\n\nThis is how a custom link can look like: https://www.picdrop.com/username/2021-12-XMAS-Shooting-outdoor\n\nYou can use the button Insert gallery path as custom link, which you will find directly below the field for the custom link, to automatically insert the name or the entire path to your gallery as a custom link.\n\nATTENTION The simpler the structure of your custom link, the higher the probability that third parties can get access to your galleries by mere guessing of the link.\n\nThat is why we advise you to use only the automatically created, randomly generated links for your galleries.\n\nIf you do decide to use custom links, please always use a password for your galleries so that no one can get into your gallery by simply guessing the gallery link.\n\nWhere can I find the link for a gallery?\n\nYou can find the current gallery link in three places:\n\nvia the send button at the very top of the gallery\n\nin the gallery settings in the section labeled Security\n\nin the address bar of your browser\n\nIf you have set a password for the gallery, you will find it in the gallery settings or via the send button!\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I change the order of my images & videos?\n\nYou can define the criteria by which your files are sorted and grouped in each gallery. You can do this in the gallery settings under \"Genera Settingsl\".\n\nYou can sort your files by the following criteria:\n\nFile name\n\nCapture time\n\nTime of upload\n\nFile size\n\nImage dimensions\n\nIn order to be able to sort images according to the time they were taken, this information must be stored in the Exif data of your images.\n\nYou can also group files in your gallery. They will then be displayed in the gallery in individual sections.Â\n\nYou can group your files by these attributes:\n\nColor flag\n\nFile type\n\nFor example, all files marked with the green color flag will be displayed in a separate section. Within this section they will be sorted according to your desired settings.Â\n\nEach sorting and grouping can also be displayed in reverse order (e.g. files sorted by file name from Z to A instead of from A to Z) by activating \"Reverse order\".\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I filter color-coded images in Lightroom, Capture One, Photo Mechanic, Finder and Explorer?\n\nYou've probably seen how to filter out your clients' image selections in Lightroom, Capture One, Photo Mechanic, Finder, and Explorer. The whole thing is not only possible with image selections but also with all color-coded images.\n\nMany image editing programs allow you to use the file search to display exactly the images of an image selection you or your clients made in picdrop. This saves you the trouble of searching for each individual file.

Now you see only the images with the desired color flag.\n\nClick on \"select all images\" (bottom left) or use the keycombination of cmd-A or Ctrl-A to select all currently displayed images.\n\nYou have now created a selection that you can use to filter out the images locally on your mac / PC.\n\nClick on the \"Export selection\" icon in the selection menu, bottom right. When you are logged in to your account you will find the various filter texts to filter out this selection in Lightroom, Capture One or in your Finder / Explorer.\n\nOptionally, you can save this selection permanently in picdrop to make it easier to find it again later.\n\nOnce you have copied the list of filenames to your clipboard, please continue on your computer in your tool of choice:\n\nFiltering the images in Lightroom Classic\n\nOpen the folder of the shooting in Lightroomâs Library mode.\n\nPress the \"<\" key (to the left of the Z) to display the filters at the top.\n\nSelect the \"Text\" category there.\n\nSelect \"Filename\" and \"Contains\" from the drop-down menus.\n\nPaste the filenames from your clipboard into the search field.\n\nNow you will only see the images you have saved in the selection.\n\nYou can now save the filtered images in a new collection or mark them with stars / colors for your further workflow.\n\nFiltering the images in Capture One\n\nIn Capture One, you can search for your images in multiple places using the exported folter text.

Then you have three options:\n\n1st option: Search in Browser\n\nPress cmd-F or ctrl-F to open the search in the browser.\n\nPaste the text from the clipboard directly next to the magnifying glass.\n\nThe images you searched for will be displayed in the browser.\n\n2nd option: Filter-tool\n\nOpen the Filter tool in the toolbar.\n\nPaste the text from the clipboard next to the magnifying glass.\n\nOnly the searched images will be displayed in the browser.\n\n3rd option: Select by file name list\n\nOpen in the menu bar the item Select > Select by > File name list ...\n\nPaste the text from the clipboard into the search field.\n\nSelect \"Space\" as separator under the search field and \"Ignore file extension\".\n\nClick OK.\n\nOnly the searched images will be displayed in the browser.\n\nDone! You can now save the displayed images as your own collection or mark them with a color / stars.\n\nFiltering the images in Photo Mechanic\n\nOpen the corresponding project folder in Photo Mechanic.\n\nPaste the filter text from your clipboard into the search box (via Edit > Find... menu or cmd-F on Mac or Ctrl-F on Windows) and set the following search options:\n\nFind: Any of the words\n\nIn: All items\n\nSearching: Filenames\n\nAfter clicking \"Find\" in the lower right corner, Photo Mechanic will now select all photos of your choice from picdrop and you can continue working with them.\n\nPlease note that the search in the upper left corner of Photo Mechanic (\"Search my Mac\") cannot be used for these steps.\n\nFiltering your images in macOS Finder and Windows Explorer\n\nOpen the folder containing your images\n\nClick into the regular search field\n\nCopy the list of filenames into the search field\n\nYou will now only see the images that were previously saved in the selection.\n\nPlease note that the filter text in Explorer can only hold a maximum of 259 characters.\n\nThe filter text in Finder is limited to 2048 characters or 99 files.\n\nLink to this entry\n\nHow do I filter selections in Lightroom, Capture One, Photo Mechanic, Finder and Explorer?\n\nMany image editing programs allow you to use the file search to display exactly the files of a selection you or your clients made in picdrop.
