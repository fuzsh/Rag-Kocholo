        "text": "We're not telling any lies here: The Hulu co-stars are officially an item, a dream come true for many of the steamy series' fans and White, who previously admitted to having feelings for Van Patten.\n\n\"I hope that happens,\" he said during an appearance on the Oct. 25 episode of Not Skinny But Not Fat podcast. \"Our lives are built in together. It's crazy, we have so much to do together.\"\n\nPlus, as he continued, \"She is the f--king coolest, most grounded, amazing person IRL that you'll ever meet. She was the fearless leader on our show. She's 25 years old and runs a set like she's been doing this for 30 years. She's so consistent and good at this.\"\n\nIt feels fitting that the co-stars fell for each other while filming one of TV's sexiest shows. The pair went public with their IRL romance in December 2020 and aren't shy about professing their love for each other on social media.\n\n\"I said, 'Well, that's a tall drink of water,'\" Shahi explained to People at the time. \"When I first met Adam, I was really blown away with him. We met in the makeup trailer and we just got on instantly. We had the exact same taste in music. We had the same taste in whiskey and tequilas, and I was really blown away by him just as a person and all I knew was that I wanted more.\"\n\nThe actors, who played popular pair Jughead and Betty, dated on and off for nearly four years before Sprouse announced they had \"permanently split\" in 2020.\n\n\"What an incredible experience I had, I'll always feel lucky and cherish that I had the chance to fall in love,\" he wrote on Instagram. \"I wish her nothing but the utmost love and happiness moving forward.\"\n\nThey'll always have summer.\n\nThe pair's off-camera three-year relationship was arguably as beloved as their on-screen dynamic as Seth and Summer. So, their 2006 split was devastating for millennials. But Brody and Bilson remain friends, with their unexpected airport run-in delighting the Internet in 2019 and Brody appearing on his ex-girlfriend's rewatch podcast last year.\n\n\"Watching the show and, like, going back into that time and everything else, you taught me how to act well,\" Bilson told him. \"I was like, 'Dude, I was never better than when I was acting with you.'\"\n\nNow, Brody has two kids with Gossip Girl star Leighton Meester, whom he wed in 2014. Yes, Seth Cohen married Blair Waldorf. \"It's not bizarre. To be perfectly honest, it was a little embarrassing,\" Brody told GQ in 2019 of the reaction to the cross-teen drama pairing. \"I guess love knows no bounds?\"\n\nWhile his character Jon Snow knew nothing, Harington was sure Leslie, who played the Wilding Ygritte, was the one for him when she joined the HBO fantasy series.\n\n\"If you're already attracted to someone,\" Harington shared in a 2016 interview with Vogue Italia, \"and then they play your love interest in the show, it's becomes very easy to fall in love.\"\n\nThe couple tied the knot in 2018 in Scotland and welcomed a baby boy in February 2021.\n\nDamon and Elena (a.k.a Delena) shippers were delighted when Dobrev and Somerhalder began dating in 2010. Alas, unlike the supernatural beings they played, their love was not immortal and they amicably called it quits three years later.\n\n\"I've said this before, that we didn't break up because anything bad happened or because there wasn't love or friendship,\" Dobrev told E! News in 2015. \"I love him and the friendship is still strong and I think he's great and I care about him. And that didn't change. Yes, we're professional and that's fine. We were friends long before we dated and we still are now.\"\n\nSpotted: Lonely Boy landing the Upper East Side's golden girl.\n\nLively and Badgley struck up a romance while filming the first season of the CW hit series, ultimately going on to call it quits in 2010.\n\nAsked to name his best onscreen kiss years later, Badgley responded on Watch What Happens Live, \"I'll say Blake \"I'll say Blake [was the best onscreen kiss] because we actually had a relationship at the time. And worst? Maybe Blake after we broke up.\"\n\nWhile their characters continued to date on and off before getting married in the series finale, Badgley said he and Lively were \"actually consummately professional, to be honest,\" in the wake of their breakup. \"I think we should both pat ourselves on the back for getting through it—because, you know, anything is complicated in that way, and we handled it.\"\n\nThey found love in a hopeless place.\n\nFans of The 100 were in for a surprise when Morley and Taylor announced that, not only were they together, but that they were married in July 2019.\n\n\"It is with such a full heart that I call [Eliza Taylor] my wife,\" Morley tweeted at the time. \"This is something we both cherish very deeply and are beyond happy. Please remember to be respectful and kind to one another. Be well be kind.\"\n\nBut in an interview with E! News after their wedding, Morley noted there was a clear distinction between his relationship with Taylor and the dynamic between their characters on the dystopian drama.\n\n\"The correlation between Bellamy and Clarke has nothing to do with Eliza and I,\" Morley explained. \"Fact and fiction, huge vast difference. You know, just to make that clear. But it's funny to to see some speculation and stuff, but need to be mindful that fact and fiction are two very different things.\"\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child in May.\n\nIn a case of life imitating art, Bledel began dating Ventimiglia—who joined the series as Rory's new love interest Jess in 2001—following her split from Padalecki.\n\nThe couple dated on and off for several years before splitting for good in 2006, though they had discussed marriage.\n\n\"I think everybody who has been dating for more than a couple of years probably talks about it at some point,\" she told People in 2005. \"It's a fun thing for us to talk about, but that's it.\"\n\nThe exes reunited onscreen for the Netflix revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, in 2016.\n\nDespite the ongoing love triangle constantly shifting on the WB show, Ben and Felicity fans could take comfort in knowing Russell and Speedman dated for years IRL, though Speedman has admitted he wasn't the best boyfriend at the time.\n\nWhen the former couple appeared together on Jimmy Kimmel Live in 2017, Speedman said he was a \"disaster of a boyfriend\" when he was younger, but refused to give any details. \"This is not the time, Dr. Phil!\" he told a curious Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nRussell wasn't spilling either, generously saying, \"A young twenties boyfriend is called a disaster of a boyfriend.\"\n\nTheir fake relationship as Russian spies on-screen led to a real romance between the actors while filming their critically acclaimed FX drama. But the pair actually met years earlier.\n\n\"I very drunkenly asked her for her number when she was a young, single, slip of a thing,\" Rhys confessed on Watch What Happens Live in 2017. \"I sort of knew then when I was 26.\"\n\nRhys and Russell—who is also mom to son River, 15, and daughter, Willa, 10, from a previous marriage—welcomed their first child together, son Sam, in 2016.\n\nAfter meeting on the set of the CW drama, the co-stars wed in 2005, less than a year after getting engaged. But Bush and Murray split after just five months of marriage, with Bush filing for an annulment, citing fraud. (Her request was denied.) Granted a divorce in December 2006, they continued to work together until Murray left One Tree Hill in 2009.\n\n\"There was no space to self-reflect,\" Bush explained on the Armchair Expert podcast in 2018, adding that she felt the producers were \"really deeply inappropriate\" to both her and Murray after their breakup.\n\n\"They ran like TV ads about it, it was really ugly,\" she explained. \"They made practice of taking advantage of people's personal lives, and not just for me and for my ex, for other actors on the show who would share as you do when you get close to people. Deeply personal things that were happening in their lives and they would wind up in storylines. It wasn't OK.\""
