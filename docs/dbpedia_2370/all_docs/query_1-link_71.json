        "text": "Hopefully art doesn’t imitate life in this case.\n\nJackson White confirmed at the 2022 CFDA Awards on Monday night that he is dating his “Tell Me Lies” co-star Grace Van Patten by sharing a strip of photos that included one of them kissing.\n\nWhite, 26, jokingly covered the smooch snap with a peeking face emoji on his Instagram Story, but it wasn’t enough to keep the secret contained, as he and Van Patten, 25, also posed for photos together at the event while holding hands.\n\nThe pair have teased their rumored relationship for weeks, but never confirmed it — until now.\n\n“I have such a crush on her. … I hope [us dating] happens. I don’t know,” White said on Dear Media’s “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast last month. “Our lives are built in together. We have so much to do together.”\n\n“She’s the f–king coolest, most grounded, amazing person IRL [in real life] that you’ll ever meet,” he added. “It’s crazy. … She’s the best. I had a huge crush on her. … I’m obsessed with her because she’s f–king amazing.”\n\nIn “Tell Me Lies,” White’s character, Stephen, and Van Patten’s character, Lucy, enter into an extremely toxic relationship that involves gaslighting, manipulation and infidelity while in college together. The Season 1 finale of the Hulu drama flashed forward multiple years to reveal Stephen had gotten engaged to Lucy’s lifelong best friend, Lydia (Natalee Linez).\n\n“[Van Patten] is 25 years old, and she runs a set like she’s been doing this for f–king 30 years. She’s so consistent and grounded and f–king good at this,” White, whose mother is “Married… with Children” alum Katey Sagal, gushed on the podcast.\n\n“I felt like I just followed her lead. … Stephen is so intense, he’s so manipulative, he’s so crazy at times that I had a hard time being that guy, and then they yell, ‘Cut!’ and then I have to be myself,” he continued. “That was really hard for me. Grace was so good at compartmentalizing the character and then herself.”"
