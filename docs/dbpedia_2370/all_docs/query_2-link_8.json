        "text": "JPEG is a popular image format used in digital cameras, phones, and several other devices. Due to this popularity, JPEG files are more susceptible to corruption than other image file types.\n\nThere are different types of JPEG corruption out there, such as cannont open, edit but lose quality or invalid JPEG marker type, etc., and JPEG header corruption is one of them. If you’re facing this issue, you’re in the right spot. This quick guide will reveal exactly how to fix broken or corrupt JPEG headers in simple methods. The solutions shared will help you gain access to the broken JPEGs by repairing them. Now that you know what we’ll cover, let’s dive right in.\n\nPart 1: Abstract of Corrupt JPEG Header?\n\nJPEG means Joint Photographic Experts Group. It is a common image file type because of how little space it consumes, especially compared to other file formats. Its small size makes it easier to share this image file type across different platforms and devices.\n\nSometimes when you try to open a JPEG file, you might get an error message ‘no preview available.’ When this happens, it shows that the header information is corrupt or damaged. When a JPEG header is corrupt, it becomes unreadable by any image-reading software. In addition, editing your JPEG photos becomes almost impossible. However, ‘no preview available’ is not the only symptom that proves that your image file is corrupt and needs fixing. Other signs of a corrupt JPEG header include:\n\nWhen any of these messages pop up on your screen, then you know it’s time to fix the broken or corrupt JEPG header.\n\nReasons Why JPEG Files Become Corrupt\n\nBefore learning the different methods to easily fix broken or corrupt JPEG headers, you should first understand how the files become corrupt. There are several reasons why the JPEG files may have become corrupt, and below are some of them.\n\nAs we have stated, the most common reason for a JPEG no longer opening is the JPEG header which is the file's name. There are many causes out there for a corrupt JPEG file, and all these causes result in image files that are no longer open. Nevertheless, there’s no reason to panic. We’ll be discussing the methods to fix broken or corrupt headers easily in the next section; let’s begin.\n\nPart 2: 3 Methods to Fix Broken or Corrupt JPEG Header\n\nNow that you’re aware of what the problem with your file could be, you’ve taken the first step. The next step becomes finding out how to fix broken or corrupt JPEG headers in easy ways. This section shows you manual solutions to your problem; let’s get started.\n\nMethod 1: Using the Hex Editors\n\nA Hex Editor is software that shows you the raw data off a file in alphanumeric and hexadecimal values. It also allows the editing of the binary data that the file consists of. When you check a JPEG header, it starts with three hexadecimal digits like FF D8 FF. These digits represent the camera information of the JPEG file. The fourth digit usually varies from DB to E0, E1, and so much more. If you notice that your JPEG header begins with other hexadecimal values, then the JPEG header is corrupt.\n\nYou can easily find out if this is the case with a hex editor. If your files don’t open, you have to check the JPEG header information of other JPEG files. The image you check needs to be from the same device and also of the same format. You can utilize a hex editor to change or add information to your JPEG heather. You can then replace the header of the affected JPEG file with that of a healthy JPEG file to fix it.\n\nMethod 2: Create a new JPEG file and check the header information\n\nSometimes you don’t get the perfect JPEG file from the same camera, which doesn’t give an error message when you try to open it. In such a situation, the best option is to create a new jpeg file and check its header details using the hex editor. This method is an effective way to fix broken or corrupt JPEG headers easily. To create a new JPEG file, follow the steps we outline below:\n\nNow that you have a new JPEG file without corrupt header information, the next step is using its header information to fix your corrupt JPEG file’s header information. To do this, follow the steps below.\n\nAlthough the process sounds like a walk in the park, it can be pretty stressful to complete. The first issue lies in discovering an efficient hex editor. Then you have to figure out the header information of the affected file. It could take hours to complete sometimes. If it all sounds cumbersome, then the following method is for you.\n\nMethod 3: Using a Professional Tool – Wondershare Repairit – To Fix Broken or Corrupt JPEG Header\n\nHex editors are not the best option when you’re trying to repair a severe corruption case.

There’re a couple of steps you can take to ensure it never happens; check them out below.\n\nBackup\n\nBackup is the best way to save yourself from issues of corrupt JPEG header. Simply backup your files once you create them. It will save you from the loss of your files and make things easier for you when they’re corrupt, damaged, or lost. When you have backup files to turn to, you can just restore your files from the backup whenever you want, the software such as Ubakcit can give you the help. Creating a backup is like having a data bank that comes through for you whenever you have a crisis.\n\nSafely Eject Memory Card\n\nWhen trying to eject the memory card, you have to be careful how you do it. Don’t just pull out the card without ejecting it first from its slot. Also, taking out the memory card while it is in use could cause damage to your JPEG files. You should always take safety precautions before you take out the memory card.\n\nApply caution when deleting files\n\nWhen you’re deleting files you no longer want, you should apply caution. Being cautious helps you avoid deleting critical files or damaging your JPEG files’ header information. One way to apply caution is by avoiding using the ‘delete all’ button on your camera.\n\nDon’t shoot with a low battery.\n\nAnother tip to avoid JPEG header getting corrupt is by not shooting pictures with a low battery. When your camera’s battery is running low, the best thing is to prevent shooting photographs. Doing this could damage your JPEG files, especially if the device goes off during the saving process. Only shoot pictures when you have enough battery or after a full charge. This way, you’re assured of the device not shutting down in the shooting process.\n\nTo Sum Up\n\nThis article introduces you to corrupt JPEG header files and the reasons why this occurs. If you’re facing this issue, you can simply fix broken or corrupt JPEG headers easily using any of the three methods we shared above. A hex editor allows you to correct the header information and one way you can do that is through our second method."
