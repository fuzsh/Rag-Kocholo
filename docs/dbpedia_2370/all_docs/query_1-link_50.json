        "text": "Summer is headed toward an inevitable cooldown, but the upcoming slate for fall TV is just starting to heat up, and Hulu's upcoming series Tell Me Lies is leading that new roster.\n\nThe anticipated drama is based on Carola Lovering's 2018 book of the same name and premiering early next month with actress Emma Roberts signed on as an executive producer.\n\nPer an from Hulu, the television adaption will follow \"a tumultuous but intoxicating relationship\" between the two main characters, Lucy Albright (Grace Van Patten) and Stephen DeMarco (Jackson White), \"as it unfolds over the course of 8 years.\" The series sees the pair endure a relationship that can't be described as anything other than toxic and how being at a \"formative age when seemingly mundane choices lead the way to irrevocable consequences.\"\n\nThe new trailer (seen below) promises a lot of sex, drama, and mystery. Ahead, everything we know so far about the upcoming series.\n\nWhat's the plot?\n\nThe series follows main character Lucy—a self-declared \"icy\" teen—as she heads to college in Southern California and unexpectedly falls for dark and mysterious upperclassman Stephen DeMarco. Their relationship is fueled by their undisputed and shared lust, but is also filled with lies and apparent gaslighting.\n\nPer Hulu, the series will see the couple as they \"quickly fall into an addictive entanglement that will permanently alter not only their lives, but the lives of everyone around them.\"\n\nAuthor Carola Lovering told Cosmopolitan in a statement, \"Tell Me Lies is an exploration of toxic relationships and the ways we undermine ourselves when we fall for the wrong people. When Lucy meets Stephen she sees all the red flags, but she ignores them—and it sets her down a path that completely derails her.\"\n\nWatch the first trailer for the series below.\n\nWho's in the cast?\n\nGrace Van Patten (Nine Perfect Strangers) stars as Lucy, while Jackson White (Mrs. Fletcher) will portray the infamous Stephen DeMarco. Jade Fernandez and Catherine Missal also star.\n\nWhen is the release date?"
