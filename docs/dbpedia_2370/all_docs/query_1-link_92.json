        "text": "Fans of Carola Lovering's novel Tell Me Lies should anticipate some changes when Hulu's TV adaptation hits the small screen.\n\nWell, at least, that's what the show's stars Grace Van Patten and Jackson White—who play Lucy Albright and Stephen DeMarco, respectively, in the steamy new drama—exclusively teased to E! News ahead of the Sept. 7 premiere. As Grace and Jackson detailed, Hulu's take on Tell Me Lies does follow its source material, but expands the story to focus on more of the supporting players, played by Spencer House, Sonia Mena, Alicia Crowder, Benjamin Wadsworth and Catherine Missal.\n\n\"The show really delves into each character,\" Grace explained to E! News, \"and each character has such a distinct journey and inner turmoil that they're going through. You really get to know Lucy and Stephen in the book, but the show really dives into every character and it makes it so much more of an ensemble.\"\n\nGrace promised that this pivot will have viewers \"so invested in each character and their friendships.\"\n\nFor those who haven't read Tell Me Lies and are unfamiliar with the plot, Hulu offers up the following description: \"Tell Me Lies follows a tumultuous but intoxicating relationship as it unfolds over the course of eight years. When Lucy Albright and Stephen DeMarco meet at college, they are at that formative age when seemingly mundane choices lead the way to irrevocable consequences. Although their relationship begins like any typical campus romance, they quickly fall into an addictive entanglement that will permanently alter not only their lives, but the lives of everyone around them.\"\n\nTell Me Lies premieres Sept. 7, with new episodes dropping Wednesdays on Hulu."
