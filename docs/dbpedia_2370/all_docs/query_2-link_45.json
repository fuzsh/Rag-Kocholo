        "text": "@Falco1211 : finally did you managed to fix the issue , im experiencing that too\n\n@Berion\n\n@aldostools : I try to install Berion covers but im experiencing the same issue than Falso1211.\n\nFirst I need to start that I was able to erase/re-install all my PS2 ISO (not splitted anymore , single piece ISOs) via FTP\n\nbut as soon i installed webman 1.47.37 (i dont even know if its linked to giving/installing PS2 cover automatically or if its mmcm that do this part ?!) but quickly i had PS2 covers installed automatically.\n\nI wanted to erase them from to start from ground zeroes and installing Berion ones (more definition in covers and custom ones too that please me a lots)\n\nQUESTION 1 : but when i go to dev_hddo / PS2ISO / the automatically installed ones DONT APPEAR there...\n\nso im wondering whats the path to see / erase them. ?\n\nQUESTION 2 : I installed approx +/- 30 PS2 cover arts made by Berion that i CAREFULLY renamed the covers with the EXACT game titles.\n\nExemple :\n\nFATAL FRAME I [SLES_508.21].iso\n\nFATAL FRAME I [SLES_508.21].png\n\n....but even after a restart console , webman refresh XML & XMB , refresh XML , refresh HTML\n\nthe damn cover dont show up ???\n\nit super mysterious since somes (of the +/- 30 covers installed) show up and somes dont !\n\nCompared to another Game that correctly matched on webman the game & cover :\n\nGENJI Dawn of the samurai [SCES_533.28].iso\n\nGENJI Dawn of the samurai [SCES_533.28].iso\n\nThis one show the cover flawlessly on the webman my game PLAYSTATIONr2 Folder.\n\nInitally i thought OK since Pinky mention 194x194 maybe i have cover in different resolution , but i checked them all in my usb folder and they are ALL 268x268 32 color !?!?!\n\nThe only difference i can see is that FATAL FRAME I png = 106 ko vs GENJI png = 112 ko\n\nRecently I remember that after having erased my PS2 (splitted /mess) ISOs a friend of mine told me it should be a good iday to \"rebuild data base\" if i remember correctly , maybe it changed my webman memory size selection. wich i honestly dont remember what i have choose years ago...\n\nBerion explained to me :\n\n\"Try to increase memory size from default to larger. To be honest, I never test this extensively (I have put few covers, they worked so I didn't bother to test it more; high probably You are first who use WMM set ). I've used larger size possible (268x268 px) because in SMAN and some of cover views in multiMAN/IRISMAN, they looks best natively, instead of scaled from smaller to larger. For XMB alone 128x128 is the best choice if I'm correct. Maybe some covers isn't show because there is not enough left free space for LV2? Try to ask aldostools or search forum. I believe I saw some similar issue few years ago also with covers (but not mine).\"\n\nDid i have to change the option here ? (Highlighted in red circle on the picture)\n\nwish one i should select between :\n\nStandard (896KB)\n\nMin (320KB)\n\nMin+(512KB)\n\nmax (1280kb)\n\nmax PS3+ (1088K PS3)\n\nmax PSX+ (368K PS3 + 768K PSX)\n\nmax BLU+ (368K PS3 + 768K BLU)\n\nmax PSP+ (368K PS3 + 768K PSP)\n\nmax PS2+ (368K PS3 + 768K PS2)\n\n?\n\n...and right aside this select option i see desactive (desactivated)\n\nshould i left this alone untouched or i should select something between :\n\n4 - bg\n\n3 - fg\n\n2 - debug\n\n1 - app\n\n?\n\nMy setup :\n\nPS3 CECH-2001a CFW Cobra Rebug CEX 4.86\n\nHDD available free space : 424.14 GB / 931 GB (1TB)\n\nWebman MOD 1.47.37\n\n100 PSX ISOs on a USB stick including various roms/iso/bin-cue 110 Gb on 115 (4.92 Gb left for Irisman config/saves/screen)\n\n100 PS2 ISOs ( 317 Gb) on dev hdd0\n\n100 PS3 ISOs on external HDD Fat32\n\nNormally I left my USB stick plugged and i only plug the PS3 ISOs HDD to install the game utilitaire (dont know the name in english) to play the game then erase it quickly after to not stock pile them unnecessarily.\n\nSo what you would suggest Aldostools ?\n\nAttached Files:\n\nIMG_8521.JPG\n\nFile size:\n\n2.1 MB\n\nViews:\n\n56\n\nIMG_8522.JPG\n\nFile size:\n\n3 MB\n\nViews:\n\n55\n\nHi Dear friend.\n\nI selected maximum option for the memory and refresh everyting = no result at all\n\nI downloaded your XnviewMP but ohhh my god i dont understand the program , sooo many option!\n\nI tried 3x time to resize a single cover art i choose 194x194 and in the end it start at 268x268.... i dont know what im doing and how to proceed correctly...\n\nI will make something with you\n\nwhen you will have more time on your side Monday , could you send me this cover arts resized 2x time\n\n1x 128x128\n\n1x 194x194\n\n1x 268x268 a 2th time , maybe you changed something in the process the 1st i have\n\nI will try them all individually in my mmcm and will give you the result.\n\nSound like a plan ?\n\nI wish you a very nice week\n\nwaiting for your next update\n\nEDIT : oh I think i got something 194x194 , I will do the 128x128 and test them immediatelly\n\nAttached Files:\n\nFatal Frame (SLUS-20388).png\n\nFile size:\n\n105.2 KB\n\nViews:\n\n29\n\nI managed to be able to have 268x268 (like yours others) + 194x194 & 128x128 images\n\nI tested them all one by one individually before erasing and copy/paste the others one by one like this :\n\nFATAL FRAME I [SLES_508.21].iso\n\nFATAL FRAME I [SLES_508.21].png\n\nGuess what ?\n\nNO COVER appear....?!\n\nI start thinking that the name of the iso must have the right region title\n\nin this case i name the game with the NTSC format while the game is PAL (for my french dubbing purpose while i live in North America) or that i should NOT include a number BEFORE or AFTER the game title like for exemple : 007 NIGHTFIRE or MANHUNT 2 .... but no , it change strictly nothing because somes of your 268x268 cover arts you made APPEAR.\n\nWHY somes DONT left me scratching my head hard....\n\n@aldostools , please ....did you know why ?\n\nTry this approach to figure out \"who or what is the problem\":\n\n- Take an ISO that is shown, make a copy of iso and its png\n\n- Rename copied files as iso and PNG not showed (FATAL FRAME ..bla bla bla... for example)\n\nPut fake ISO and PNG where they should be putted and restart PS3\n\nFake game is showed?\n\nAn alternative is to just change the png not shown to one shown, with the name changed according to the ISO.\n\n@aldostools @Crystal , @Algol : Nope the approach didnt changed anything\n\nI copied a game that is show : Metal Slug Anthology in this case + its associated .png image and renamed them :\n\nFATAL FRAME I [SLES_508.21].iso\n\nFATAL FRAME I [SLES_508.21].png\n\nAnd copied it in the PS2ISO folder\n\nI turned the console off\n\nI turned it on\n\nusing webman I made a XML & XMB / XML / HTML Refresh\n\nGuess what ... ? the Newly Fatal Frame I (Metal Slug Anthology) completely ERASED my original genuine Fatal Frame I off the HDD0 to REPLACE IT with the fake one and NO Fatal Frame I.png show.\n\nEDIT : Like i explained at the start , all my image are in .png format , same resolution\n\nSOMES appear/show OTHERS simply dont want to show ?!?\n\nALSO For the one that Berion DIDNT make , the console created SOMES of them (approximatelly 15% of my 100 PS2 ISO installed) in the console ?\n\nwhat is the path for me to find them please...because they dont show in the mmcm HDDO PS2ISO folder..... so where they are ? the path...?\n\nI dont understand\n\nI truly need help here please (anyone with even a little clue who are able to explain what happen with this problem is welcome\n\nTry different test.\n\nRename i.e \"PS2ISO\" to i.e \"PS2_old\" (name doesn't matter ;]).\n\nCreate PS2ISO folder.\n\nCopy game for which cover isn't displayed from \"old\" to \"new empty one\"; do the same with cover itself.\n\nRestart (full cycle) console.\n\nIf cover will be displayed, it means that there is some problem with WMM and I cannot help You.\n\nIf cover will be not displayed, add another game and its cover but the one which was displayed before and again, restart console. If new one will appear and old will stay not read, it means that problem lies in PNG format (just like JPEG, it is quite complicated format and libpng used by PSP/PS3 are piece of shit ;]). This means I need to prepare some variations to test for You. It is possible anyway, that my gfx have some flaws because I removed every metadata and maximally compressed them to be as simple as possible, and ass much as possible small.\n\nOk Berion , thanks I will make this new test right now and get back with result"
