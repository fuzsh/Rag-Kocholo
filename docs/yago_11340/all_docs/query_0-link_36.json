        "text": "Sirikit (Thai language: สิริกิติ์; Thai pronunciation: [sì.rì.kìt]; (help·info); born Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara (Thai language: สิริกิติ์ กิติยากร; rtgs: Sirikit Kitiyakon) on 12 August 1932) is the queen dowager of Thailand. She was the queen consort of King Bhumibol Adulyadej (or Rama IX) and is the mother of King Vajiralongkorn (or Rama X). She met Bhumibol in Paris, where her father was Thai ambassador. They married in 1950, shortly before Bhumibol's coronation. Sirikit was appointed queen regent in 1956, when his Majesty the King entered the Buddhist monkhood for a period of time. Sirikit has one son and three daughters with the king. Consort of the monarch who was the world's longest-reigning head of state, she was also the world's longest-serving consort.[citation needed] Sirikit suffered a stroke on 21 July 2012 and has since refrained from public appearances.\n\nEarly life and family[]\n\nSirikit was born on 12 August 1932, at the home of Lord Vongsanuprabhand, her maternal grandfather. She is the eldest daughter and the third child of Prince Nakkhatra Mangkala Kitiyakara, the son of Prince Kitiyakara Voralaksana, and Mom Luang Bua Snidvongs (1909–1999). Her name, which was given by King Prajadhipok, means \"the greatness of Kitiyakara\".\n\nShe had three siblings, two elder brothers and a younger sister:\n\nProf. Mom Rajawongse Kalyanakit Kitiyakara, M.D. (20 September 1929 – 15 May 1987)\n\nMom Rajawongse Adulakit Kitiyakara (2 November 1930 – 5 May 2004)\n\nMom Rajawongse Busba Kitiyakara (born 2 August 1934)\n\nSirikit was raised by her maternal grandparents for a year after her birth, since her father was in the United States to work as the secretary of the Siamese Embassy at Washington, D.C. Her mother joined her husband three months later. When she was one year old, her parents returned to Thailand. Sirikit lived together with her family in Deves Palace, near the Chao Phraya River, Bangkok.\n\nAs a child, Sirikit often visited her paternal grandmother. Once in 1933, she travelled with Princess Absornsaman Devakula following King Prajadhipok's tour in Songkhla.\n\nEducation[]\n\nAt age four, Sirikit attended the Kindergarten College at Rajini School (sometimes called the Queen's College), where she studied at the primary level. During that time the Pacific War was being fought. Bangkok was bombed many times, especially the rail lines, making travel unsafe. She therefore moved to Saint Francis Xavier Convent School, since it was near the palace. She studied at Saint Francis Xavier from her second primary year through the early secondary level.\n\nIn 1946, with the war now over, her father moved to the United Kingdom as the ambassador to the Court of St James's, taking his family with him. Sirikit was then 13 and completed her secondary education. While in England she learned to play the piano and became fluent in English and French. Because of her father's work as a diplomat, the family moved to other countries, including Denmark and France. While in France, she studied at a music academy in Paris.\n\nAlso in France, Sirikit met King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who was related to her, since both were descendants of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V). At that time, Bhumibol had ascended to the throne and was studying in Switzerland. Bhumibol and Sirikit (as well as a few other students) were staying at the Thai Royal Embassy in Paris. Sirikit accompanied the king as he visited various tourist attractions, and they found that they had much in common.\n\nMarriage[]\n\nOn 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol was driving a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he collided into the rear of a braking truck 10 km outside of Lausanne. He injured his back and incurred cuts on his face that cost him most of the sight in one eye.[1] He subsequently wore an ocular prosthetic. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, The Princess Mother Sangwan, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that the king could get to know her better. Bhumibol selected a boarding school for her in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949,[1] and the couple married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation.\n\nEstablishment of the Queen[]\n\nThe marriage took place at Srapathum Palace. Queen Sri Savarindira, the Queen Grandmother presided over the marriage ceremony. Both the king and Sirikit signed on line 11 of their certificate of marriage. As she was not yet 18, her parents also signed, on line 12 directly under her signature. She later received the Order of the Royal House of Chakri, and became queen. After the coronation ceremony on 5 May 1950, both went back to Switzerland to continue their studies, and returned to Bangkok in 1952.\n\nIssue[]\n\nName Birth Marriage\n\nDate | Spouse Their Children Their Grandchildren Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya 5 April 1951(1951-04-05) (age 73) 29 July 1981\n\nDivorced 1998 Peter Ladd Jensen Ploypailin Jensen Maximus Wheeler\n\nLeonardo Wheeler Poom Jensen Sirikitiya Jensen King Maha Vajiralongkorn, Rama X of Thailand 28 July 1952(1952-07-28) (age 72) 3 January 1977\n\nDivorced 12 August 1991 Soamsawali Kitiyakara Princess Bajrakitiyabha February 1994\n\nDivorced 1996 Yuvadhida Polpraserth Juthavachara Vivacharawongse Vacharaesorn Vivacharawongse Chakriwat Vivacharawongse Vatchrawee Vivacharawongse Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana 10 February 2001\n\nDivorced 11 December 2014 Srirasmi Suwadee Prince Dipangkorn Rasmijoti Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn 2 April 1955(1955-04-02) (age 69) Never married Princess Chulabhorn Walailak 4 July 1957(1957-07-04) (age 67) 1982\n\nDivorced 1996 Virayudh Tishyasarin Princess Siribhachudabhorn Princess Aditayadornkitikhun\n\nRegency[]\n\nWhen the king undertook the traditional period as a Buddhist monk in 1956, Queen Sirikit acted as regent.[2] She performed her duties so well that she was officially named the Regent of Thailand and the King gave her the title \"Somdet Phra Nang Chao Sirikit Phra Borommarachininat\" on his birthday, 5 December 1956. She became the second Siamese queen regent in Thai history. The first was Queen Saovabha Phongsri of Siam, who served as regent when her husband King Chulalongkorn travelled to Europe, and later became Queen Sri Patcharindra.\n\nHealth[]\n\nAt dawn on 21 July 2012 Queen Sirikit felt unsteady and staggered while exercising at Siriraj Hospital where King Bhumibol Adulyadej resided. A team of physicians determined after performing magnetic resonance imaging that she had incurred an ischemic stroke.[3]\n\nThe queen has been treated and has refrained from public appearances since, including the grand audience granted by her husband on his 85th birthday from the Ananta Samakhom Hall on 5 December 2012.[4]\n\nOn 29 November 2016, the palace announced that the queen was discharged from the hospital and has returned to the Chitralada Royal Villa due to her recovery.[5]\n\nCultural status[]\n\nQueen Sirikit's birthday, as is the king's, is a national holiday, and is also Mothers' Day in Thailand. She is particularly revered in the more remote and traditional parts of the country, where the monarchy is regarded as semi-divine. Her work in promoting tolerance and understanding for the Muslim minorities in the southernmost provinces of Pattani, Yala and Narathiwat have made her especially popular amongst Thai Muslims.[citation needed] The queen has a strong bond with southern Thailand, and she formerly spent months in the Muslim-majority provinces every year. She is considered to be one of the more quiet diplomats.[6]\n\nBooks and writing[]\n\nQueen Sirikit published In Memory of my European Trip in 1964, which described her time in Europe with the king. It was this book that revealed that she was a talented writer. Moreover, she has composed songs for performance by The Handsome Band, the band of the palace.\n\nThe songs she composed were:\n\nChao Chom Khwan (เจ้าจอมขวัญ)\n\nThat Thoe (ทาสเธอ)\n\nSai Yut (สายหยุด)\n\nNang Yaem (นางแย้ม)\n\nTitle, styles, honours and awards[]\n\nTitles[]\n\nHer formal name and title is Somdet Phra Nang Chao Sirikit Phra Borommarachininat Thai language: สมเด็จพระนางเจ้าสิริกิติ์ พระบรมราชินีนาถ; \"Her Majesty Queen Regent Sirikit\".
