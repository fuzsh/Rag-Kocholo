Thank you.\n\nIn reaction to the colonization of Southeast Asia by England and France, the actions of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V; r. 1868-1910) show how Siam resisted colonization both by enacting reforms to modernize the government and by projecting a “modernized image” of the country and its monarchy. This campaign consciously used not only art and architecture but also royal costumes as political tools for projecting to the West a modern image of the kingdom and of the royal family. While the King himself adopted contemporary English fashions (e.g., Victorian and Edwardian styles of costumes) for official events with foreigners, the Queens and other high-ranking female royalty created hybrid costumes that combined traditional Siamese textiles and royal garbs with European garments (e.g., men’s style jackets and women’s blouses, shoes, and tiaras). This paper investigates the costumes of the two chief queens of King Chulalongkorn, Her Majesties Queen Saovabha Phongsri and Queen Savang Vadhana. Each Queen had a different style that clearly projected their contrasting attitudes toward such topics as women’s rights and careers. They also utilized and promoted traditional Siamese textiles to an international level.\n\nM.L.
