When her husband was deposed (1687) she was forced to retire from the court to the dower palace of the Old Saray, but with the accession of her elder son Mustafa II (1695), Rabia was accorded the title of Valide Sultan. With Mustafaâs removal from power (1703) she retained this rank into the reign of her younger son Ahmed III (1703 â 1736). Sultana Rabia did not achieve any particular political status during the reigns of her sons, though she was considered the senior representative of the Ottoman dynasty. It was in this capacity that she was consulted to approve the removal of her elder son from power because of his erratic behaviour, and his replacement with her younger. For the good of the empire the queen mother agreed to this arrangement. Sultana Rabia Gulnus Ummetullah died (Nov, 1715) in Constantinople.\n\nRabiâah al-Adawiyyah â (712 â 801)\n\nArab poet and religious scholar\n\nRabiâah was born a peasant member of the Suni al-Atik tribe.

The six year old child was found bludgeoned and strangled to death in the basement of her parentsâ home in Boulder, Colorado (Dec 26, 1996) with a ransom note left in the kitchen, which made it look like a ransom abduction gone wrong. The parents remained suspects mainly because of the lack of any unidentifiable intruder. Also the FBI noted that this was the only murder case in US history in which the body of an alleged kidnap victim was discovered in the same house as the ransom note. The case engendered enormous national and international media attention and when a tape of JonBenet dressed in pink and performing the song I Wanna be a Cowboyâs Sweetheart was played on national television it created further and continued interest in the case. A grand jury convened to consider the case (1998 â 1999) later adjourned it without making any charges due to lack of evidence.
