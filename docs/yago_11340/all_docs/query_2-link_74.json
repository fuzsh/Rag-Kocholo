        "text": "Thailand’s 21st century political conflict is a clash between those who believe all human beings are entitled to equal rights, and those who still refuse to accept this.\n\nFor hundreds of years, Thai society has been characterised by extreme inequality. The medieval Siamese kingdom of Ayutthaya was built upon rigid social hierarchy, with a despotic king and various ranks of status obsessed aristocrats exploiting and abusing ordinary people, who were treated like slaves and tattooed with numbers and symbols to show which nobleman they belonged to and had to serve.\n\nBritish scholar H.G. Quaritch Wales, who was an advisor to King Vajiravudh and King Prajadhipok in the Thai royal court during the 1920s, wrote a frank account of traditional Thai society in his book Siamese State Ceremonies:\n\nFive and a half centuries ago, King Trailok of Ayutthaya produced a voluminous set of laws governing Siamese society, which included an elaborate codification of the rigid social hierarchy. The status of each person in the kingdom was expressed in terms of a numerical score — with the exception of the king, because his status was infinite.\n\nThe crown prince had 100,000 points, other members of the royal family had up to 50,000, and various ranks of nobles had a score that ranged from 10,000 down to 400 points for the least powerful. Administrative officials had between 50 and 400 points, artisans 50, ordinary people 25, and slaves just 5 points. Unmarried peasant women were deemed lowlier than slaves, with no points at all.\n\nMaintaining such a dystopian society requires plenty of force and coercion, but that’s not enough to sustain such savage exploitation and inequality for centuries. Ideology and social engineering are also necessary to persuade the downtrodden that they don’t deserve anything better, and to deter them from seeking to overthrow the system.\n\nThis was the purpose of royal propaganda and ritual. Legitimising a society built on subjugation and hierarchical status requires convincing people that those at the top really are superior beings, and that those underneath should be grateful to serve them.\n\nSo a royalist theology was constructed via a fusion of Hindu and Buddhist beliefs to present the king as a living god with supernatural powers. The nobility could then seek to justify their elevated status through their proximity to the divine monarch, and ordinary people were taught that it was a privilege to be exploited by such celestial beings.\n\nThais were trained to prostrate themselves at the feet of those of higher social status. They were forbidden to look directly at the king, or even to know his real name. And in a further extraordinary development, a separate language called rajasap was developed which had to be used when addressing or discussing the royal family.\n\nIt was a language designed for subjugation — when addressing the king, Thais had to state the phrase “ขอเดชะฝ่าละอองธุลีพระบาทปกเกล้าปกกระหม่อม”, which literally means: “May the power of the dust under the dust under the dust under the soles of your royal feet protect my head and the top of my head.”\n\nAs Paul Handley says in The King Never Smiles: “Coupled with prostration, this implies a deep sense of inferiority, but also high honor for being able to place the highest possible part of one’s body, the head, in proximity to the holy king’s most inferior part, his feet.”\n\nThe use of ideology, ritual and language to entrench inequality and exploitation was, of course, not unique to Thailand. Monarchies everywhere have always sought to pretend that those with royal blood are somehow special and superior to the rest of us.\n\nThey do this, for example, via special clothing and regalia for royal ceremonies, as well as “invented traditions” and fake historical narratives. A particularly common linguistic strategy, used across multiple cultures and languages, is for royals to refer to themselves using plural pronouns. This is called the “majestic plural” or the “royal we”.\n\nBut rajasap is a particularly striking example of a linguistic strategy for making the king seem special because it’s a totally different language, mainly based on Khmer. To speak the language one needs to learn a totally new vocabulary.\n\nKing Chulalongkorn officially abolished the custom of grovelling on the ground in 1873. “The practice of prostration in Siam is severely oppressive,” he stated in comments published in The Royal Gazette. “The subordinates have been forced to prostrate in order to elevate the dignity of their superiors. I do not see how the practice of prostration will render any benefit to Siam.”\n\nChulalongkorn also officially abolished slavery. But despite these gestures, Siam remained a caste ridden society, with an absolute monarch and nobility that exploited ordinary people with impunity.\n\nThis cartoon, published in the Siam Review in 1926, lampoons the attitudes of elite Thais.\n\nThe caption is: “Our custom of crawling.” The cartoon shows a foreigner and a wealthy Thai seated at a table with female servants grovelling at their feet alongside several dogs.\n\nThe foreigner asks: “Aren’t they Thai too?”\n\n“Yes,” replies his host, “but they have less money than me.”\n\nBy the 20th century, the rest of the world had changed. In several places, the oppressed had risen up and overthrown their oppressors. It was becoming increasingly accepted that all human beings should have equal rights. This belief is central to the concept of democracy. A truly democratic society is one in which all voices have a right to be heard and everybody has an equal say in how their country should be governed.\n\nIn June 1932 a group of Thai officials and soldiers launched a revolution that ended the absolute monarchy. In their first proclamation, they explicitly declared their intention to “provide the people with equal rights” ( สิทธิเสมอภาคกัน) “so that those of royal blood do not have more rights than the people as at present” (ไม่ใช่พวกเจ้ามีสิทธิยิ่งกว่าราษฎร). They also made clear that “the country belongs to the people, not to the King, as he has fraudulently claimed” (ประเทศเรานี้เป็นของราษฎรไม่ใช่ของ กษัตริย์ตามที่เขาหลอกลวง).\n\nTragically, in the decades after the revolution, elite royalists and the military have conspired to stifle democracy and human rights, and drag the country back towards its despotic past.\n\nFrom the late 1950s onwards, prostration and rajasap were reintroduced. Thais are exposed to the ancient and obsolete language daily, in the royal news broadcasts at 8 p.m. each evening. Thongchai Winichakul observes that via the rigid format of these broadcasts which always begin with the seniormost royals and then cover the others in descending order of rank, “Thais are reminded every day of the hierarchical social order”.\n\nThe palace propaganda machine continues to pretend that the royals are superior to ordinary people. Even the royal dogs are revered.\n\nOrdinary Thais, meanwhile, are taught to take pride in their subservience, which they are told is an intrinsic part of their national culture. The state celebrates and encourages “Thainess”, a set of behavioural norms including obsequious deference to authority, unquestioning acceptance of official propaganda, and worship of the royal family. Those who object to such slavish behaviour are denounced as being unThai.\n\nThe persistence of archaic rituals of subjugation and royal worship has become toxic for Thailand. The education system is blighted: the elite fear teaching people how to think, because an educated populace would surely reject royalist propaganda. The rich routinely treat the poor with contempt. The justice system is utterly corrupt, with verdicts invariably going in favour of the highest bidder.\n\nThe system survives only thanks to stringent enforcement of the draconian lèse majesté law which outlaws challenges to the royalist culture of deference and social hierarchy.\n\nAs Thongchai says: “In effect, instead of protecting the monarchy, the law is a measure to control public culture concerning the monarchy by stipulating the boundary of what may be expressed and acted upon. The unpredictability of enforcement and the dubious interpretations serve this purpose even more effectively than a clear and consistent application of the law because the former induces self-censorship and a climate of fear.”\n\nThainess and democracy are utterly incompatible. Democracy is based on accepting that all people are equal and deserve equal rights. Thainess requires people to be grateful for being the dust under the dust under the feet of the king. This is why the Thai elite keeps trying to impose systems of “democracy with the king as head of state” or “Thai-style democracy” which are not democratic at all. They have never accepted the equality of all human beings.\n\nThainess is dying. In the 21st century, with a global culture that takes it for granted that all people deserve equal rights and that those with royal blood are just ordinary human beings just like the rest of us, the rituals and traditions that once reinforced reverence for royalty now have the opposite effect — their absurdity breaks the spell of deference.\n\nKing Bhumibol Adulyadej is dying too, and indeed his death will be a killer blow for the toxic ideology of Thainess — it is difficult to see how extreme royalism can survive when Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn is Rama X.\n\nBhumibol’s health problems illustrate another perennial problem for the palace propaganda machine to deal with — according to royalist ideology kings are superhuman figures, so when illness and old age expose how human they really are, it risks undermining the myths of monarchism.\n\nAs H.G. Quaritch Wales pointed out in Siamese State Ceremonies: “Illness and death are perhaps the greatest dangers that Divine Kingship had to face.” This was because acknowledging that “the King could be subject to the ills of the flesh as were ordinary mortals” contradicted the mythology that royals were godlike beings. For this reason, it was forbidden to discuss the health of the king, or to mention that one day he would die.\n\nWhen King Chulalongkorn died due to kidney failure in October 1910, it came as a shock to most Thais who had been unaware how serious his condition was. Because it was taboo to discuss Chulalongkorn’s medical issues openly, his condition had been kept secret. Just 48 hours before his death, his most senior queen, Saovabha Phongsri, had reported: “His Majesty has improved in all respects.”\n\nEven in the 21st century, the taboo on saying that kings eventually die — just like the rest of us — partially persists. Thai media tend not to mention that Bhumibol will die one day, while foreign media mostly use euphemisms such as “passing from the scene” or “leaving the scene”. And although the palace now issues regular health updates when the king is ill — in contrast to past reigns — they are mostly fictional, concealing the seriousness of his condition and always claiming that Bhumibol’s health is improving.\n\nLeaked diplomatic cables show how readily the palace lies about Bhumibol’s health. When the king was hospitalised in October 2007, the palace said the problem was “inadequate blood flow to his left cerebral cortex, resulting in weakness on the right side of his body”. In fact, as palace officials acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador, Bhumibol suffered a stroke. The palace also lied when the king was hospitalised on September 16, 2009 — it waited four days to make a statement, and then gave September 19 as the date he entered hospital.\n\nBy now, however, Bhumibol is so ill that even when sugarcoated, his health bulletins make grim reading. The last three health updates issued by the palace have all noted that Bhumibol is suffering from acute kidney failure. Many Thais believe his death is imminent.\n\nThe recent health bulletins have mentioned that Bhumibol has been unable to produce sufficient urine due to his kidney problems. And because all discussion of royal matters has to be conducted in the rajasap language, the palace statements use a special word for Bhumibol’s urine.\n\nThe usual Thai word for urine is ปัสสาวะ, pronounced pasawa.\n\nBut the king’s urine is พระบังคนเบา, or phra bang kon bao.\n\nIt is absurdities like this that make exaggerated reverence for royalty untenable in the 21st century. People are smart enough nowadays to see that a crown is just a ridiculous and impractical hat. And regardless of what you call it, royal urine is no more special than anybody else’s. In life, in illness, and in death, we are all human. No more, and no less."
