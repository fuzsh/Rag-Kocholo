        "text": "You recently read my account of the 1897 visit of the Siamese King Chulalongkorn (Rama V) to St. Petersburg, where he was the guest of Tsar Nicholas II, whom he had met a few years earlier in Bangkok. The visit heralded the beginning of diplomatic relations between Siam and Russia, but the close friendship that had developed between these two monarchs had even more consequences.\n\nOffer from the Tsar\n\nTsar Nicholas II made a proposal to King Chulalongkorn to send one of his sons to the Tsarist court in St. Petersburg. The tsar would then personally commit himself to the upbringing and a good education of that son. The Siamese king agreed and chose his favorite son Chakrabongse for this unique occasion. This story is about the prince himself, in a second article the also interesting life of his Russian wife Katja is discussed.\n\nPrince Chakrabongse\n\nThe Siamese prince was then 14 years old and stayed in England to perfect his knowledge of the English language. Together with his college friend Nai Poum Sakara, who was not of noble birth, he moved to St. Petersburg. On their arrival they were welcomed by the Tsar, who advised them to enjoy the White Nights (see Wikipedia) and the short summer in the city, because soon a rigorous education program would start at a prestigious military academy, of which they would become a member. would become of the “Corps des Pages. The boys were housed in the luxurious palace, which was a huge change from their humble accommodation in England.\n\nCorps des Pages\n\nOnly sons of high-ranking military personnel, renowned statesmen and of Russian or foreign nobility were recruited for this elite education. Prince Chakrabongse was the first Asian to be admitted to this prestigious military academy. Although he was given a Russian tutor, the prince initially found the studies very strenuous. A rigorous system of intensive education, which was designed to enable the students to gain entry into the Imperial Guard regiments.\n\nIn a final examination, a result of at least nine points out of twelve was essential. If the result was less, a student was, as it were, demoted to a regiment of the regular army. It was all the more difficult for the Siamese prince, because he was placed with children his own age, who had already received five years of education at that academy. To make up for that backlog, he received a lot of extra lessons from a number of teachers. He also had to study subjects such as classical music, dance, horseback riding and even learn to play musical instruments. Game hunting was also a subject, but as a Buddhist he objected to that.\n\nAn ambitious prince\n\nPrince Chakrabongse gradually excelled in his studies and was therefore eligible for the special title 'Page de la Chambre', which gave him an even deeper insight into the world of the Tsar and his family. He received an excellent military education and completed his studies with flying colors. The Corps des Pages was followed by the Guard of Hussars and the Prince continued his education at the academy known as the General Staff. He was then promoted to Colonel of the Russian Army.\n\nLiving in Saint Petersburg\n\nThe prince and his friend were eventually all \"Russified\" and part of the city's \"golden youth\". They were very visible in the cultural circuit and took part in dance parties, masquerades, premiere performances including plays by Shakespeare. Prince Chakrabongse developed a special predilection for ballet.\n\nIn addition, there was “His Majesty's Hussar Bodyguard Regiment: an elite cavalry brigade, where the prince and his friend were admitted. Once both friends were members, they could experience what it meant to be a hussar in an elite environment with a stylish military tradition. The Hussars had the most lavish and extravagant parties and a lavish lifestyle. So it was not only the regular military obligations, but social life also demanded a lot of stamina.\n\nRoyal Obligations\n\nAs the favorite son of both King Chulalongkorn and Queen Saovabha Bongsri, Prince Chakrabongse regularly represented his father at special occasions in Europe. He attended the wedding of Crown Prince Wilhelm and Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia, the funeral of King Umberto I of Italy and the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary of Great Britain.\n\nIn love with Katya\n\nPrince Chakrabongse's happy life in Russia would culminate in a meeting with Ekaterina 'Katya' Desnitskaya, a nurse who was living in Saint Petersburg at the time. The couple met in the house of a noble woman in 1905. The Siamese prince quickly fell in love with - as it was described - the young girl with beautiful red gold hair who appeared in the doorway in a shy and demure manner. The prince was charmed by \"every intonation of her youthful voice, every fleeting glance of her frank eyes, and the movement of her small but good hands.\"\n\nDespite pleas from the Siamese prince, Katya left for the Russian Far East to serve as a nurse during the closing stages of the Russo-Japanese War. The young couple kept in touch with each other through letters. The prince wrote: \"I don't want anyone but you. It would be wonderful to have you with me and nothing could disturb my happiness.” Katya read those letters and was convinced that the dear prince was serious about sharing life with her.\n\nWedding\n\nKatya came back from the war front and Prince Chakrabongse was desperate to marry her. However, there was a major obstacle, because a marriage would cause major family problems in Siam. The prince adhered to Buddhism and Katya was not of noble birth and moreover Orthodox. A marriage was prepared in great secrecy and took place in 1906 in a Greek Orthodox church in Constantinople.\n\nFinally\n\nThe young couple celebrated their wedding on the Nile River in Egypt on their way to Siam. It was agreed that the prince would first travel alone to Bangkok to tell his father and mother the news. How that went on and more about Katya's life will be in the next article. .\n\nSource: Article on the website “Russia behind the headlines” (RBTH), which is based on the book “Katya and the Prince of Siam” by Narisa Chakrabongse (granddaughter of the prince and Eileen Hunter."
