        "text": "\"The position of affairs in Siam, meanwhile, was becoming critical. A peremptory intimation was given by the French Government to the Siamese authorities that the boundary of Annam would be brought up to the eastern bank of the Mekong, and a demand was made for the withdrawal of the Siamese forces from the disputed territory. The Siamese protested against this assertion of territorial rights over an area which had hitherto been regarded as belonging to Siam, and insisted that any delimitation must be based upon actual possession. They suggested that the disputed points should be referred to arbitration. The French Government declined to entertain this idea, and replied to the Siamese protest by pushing their posts further into the debatable land. Positions were taken up at Stung-Treng and the island of Khoneboth being posts of great strategical importance. The Siamese retired without firing a shot, but they made up for their inactivity on this occasion by an act of aggression which was to cost them dear.\n\nA French convoy on its way to Khone was attacked by a body of Siamese soldiers and the officer in command, Captain Thoreux, was made prisoner and taken to Bassac. This incident tended very considerably to aggravate an already overcharged situation. Its immediate result was to induce the French Government to order up reinforcements into the disputed area and to conduct a more vigorous initiative all along the line. The Siamese were not at all intimidated by these measures. At the capital active steps were taken to prepare for the worst, and on the Annam border a Siamese attack was made on a body of French troops, with the result that a French sergeant and some seventeen soldiers were killed and all their property destroyed. In regard to the latter incident there was, it is true, at first a disavowal of responsibility on the part of the Siamese Government, but no one attached importance to this plea at the time, and it was eventually abandoned. It was daily becoming clearer to every one at Bangkok that the war cloud was on the point of bursting.\n\nAmongst the British commercial community the outlook was viewed with grave misgiving. British interests were enormously preponderant at Bangkok, and the chief force of any blow which might be delivered would necessarily fall upon British traders. Moreover, with a vast floating population, composed largely of low-class Chinese, there was serious danger of a rising in the event of an attack by the French. Urgent representations were made to Lord Rosebery by the Borneo Company and other great trading firms of the dangers of the position, and the Government were requested to send warships to meet any eventuality that might arise. The ministry, responding, as they were bound to do, to this demand, issued the necessary orders to the naval authorities, and two small British warships soon dropped anchor at the mouth of the Menam. Their appearance on the scene excited not a little irritation in France, as the measure was accepted as a confirmation of the suspicions, held quite unjustly, that the British Government was backing the Siamese Government up in its resistance to French demands.\n\nThe sentiments entertained by the French Government at the period are outlined in this despatch, dated July 3, 1893, from Lord Rosebery to Mr. Phipps, who was in charge of the British Embassy during Lord Dufferin's temporary absence :\"I received a visit to-day from the French Charge d'Affaires, who called to furnish me with a spontaneous explanation from M. Develle respecting the course of affairs in Siam. He said, with some strength of language, that for the last ten years France had been suffering a series of paltry wrongs and encroachments on the part of Siam, which she had hitherto been too much occupied by the difficulty of organising her administration in Tonkin to resent. Of late, however, she had thought it necessary to do so, as well as to assert her right on the left bank of the Mekong. The Siamese had resisted these proceedings, had fired on the French troops, and had also captured a French officer, whom they had promised to deliver up, though they had not done so.\n\n\"I asked if it were not the fact that Captain Thoreux was coming from the Mekong by land, and whether it did not take a long time to make the journey.\n\n\"M. d'Estournelles said that was the fact, and that this prolonged journey was a further aggravation. In any case, the Siamese had shown backwardness and tardiness in offering satisfaction for this outrage, and the French Government could wait no longer. He then went on to complain of the language of Sir E. Grey in the House of Commons, as tending to give an impression in Siam and in France that Great Britain was giving her support to the Siamese.\n\n\"This view I at once contested, stating that I did not think Sir E. Grey's words could be so interpreted. The despatch of British ships to Siam was rendered necessary by the fact that our merchants loudly demanded protectionnot against France, but against a native rising which they feared was imminent. Complaints had already been made that I was too supine in the matter, but if a rising were to take place, and British life and property were to be injured, I should be very seriously and justifiably attacked. I reminded M. d'Estournelles that the official map published in France showed that the places recently invaded by the French were in Siamese territory. But I had always sedulously kept aloof, and I authorised him to tell M. Develle that from the very inception of this business I had never seen the Siamese minister or any one connected with him. On the other hand, through Sir T. Sanderson, and through H.M.'s minister at Bangkok, I had inculcated the desirability of coming to a prompt understanding and peaceful settlement with France, which should include all pending difficulties, and settle the frontier question on a permanent basis.\"\n\nIt is manifest from this despatch that French opinion at the time was very much excited against Siam, and that a strong disposition existed to push matters to extreme limits. The French Charge d'Affaires was eloquent in his interview with Lord Rosebery about the \"wrongs\" inflicted by the Siamese; and no doubt there were some irritating incidents in the past relations of the French and the Siamese to exacerbate feeling in France. But the real motive force at the back of the French claims was an earth hunger on the part of the forward school of French colonial politicians, who at that period, owing to various causes, had a predominant voice in the direction of the external policy of the Republic.\n\nWhile the position of Siam in the face of the French demands was, as we have seen, engaging the serious attention of the British and French Foreign Offices, the war spirit in Siam was daily rising higher. The patriotic feeling was stirred to its depths by what was regarded as the unjust claims of France to territory which it was claimed had long been Siamese, and it was deemed a point of national honour to resist to the utmost these attempts at aggression. Critics of the Siamese Government censured it severely for this bellicose attitude, and no doubt its resistance beyond a certain point was in the eyes of the world sheer folly ; but it has always to be remembered that an Oriental Power has to consider seriously the effect that a tame surrender, even in the face of overwhelming odds, will have on its subjects.\n\nMoreover, it must not be overlooked that British intervention, however chimerical the idea might have seemed in Whitehall, was regarded on the spot at the time, and not merely by the Siamese, as quite within the bounds of possibility.\n\nWhatever the truth may have been on this point, the Siamese Government had no doubt in its mind as to the necessity of preparing for the crisis which was obviously approaching. The defences at Paknam were overhauled, and the king himself spent some days there personally superintending the operations. Simultaneously measures were taken, not very successfully, as it turned out, to block the channel of the river.\n\nThe preparations were barely completed ere the French cruiser Inconstant and the gunboat Comete appeared at the mouth of the Menam. An intimation of the fact of their arrival was given to the Siamese Government, with a notification that they would cross the bar on the evening of July 13th. To this announcement Prince Devawongse, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, replied\n\nthat the reasons advanced by France for sending warships were neither valid nor founded on facts ;\n\nthat the Siamese Government objected to an interpretation of the treaty which would give any Power an absolute right to send into the territorial waters of Siam and to the capital of the kingdom as many war vessels as they should like.\n\n\"The spirit of the Treaty cannot be,\" it was added, \"that Siam should be deprived of the natural right of any nation to protect itself, and the French Government will easily understand, under present circumstances, we cannot, without abdicating our right to exist as an independent State, adopt such interpretation.\"\n\nM. Pavie, the French representative at Bangkok, replied to this with a statement that he had not failed to inform his Government of the Siamese objections to the Inconstant's entry into the river, and an intimation that he had equally made known that \"I have insisted with your Highness that the Inconstant, while waiting a reply, anchors at Paknam conformably to the Treaty.\"\n\nPrince Devawongse in turn wrote in answer to this : \"I feel obliged to state without delay that my objections against the Inconstant passing the bar are of a general nature, and apply to its anchoring at Paknam as well as its going up to Bangkok. . . . Indeed, the reasonable interpretation which I think ought to be given to the Treaty, as not depriving Siam of the essential right of any State to watch over its own safety and independence, is applicable to any part of our territorial waters.\" This firm attitude taken up by the Siamese authorities was proof against a strong verbal protest which M. Pavie made at an interview he had with Prince Devawongse on July 12th. After the meeting the Prince wrote to the French representative as follows : \"Notwithstanding your insistence in our interview to-day on having the Inconstant and the Comete admitted to anchor at Paknam, it is my duty to maintain my peremptory objections which I made in my preceding letter, against their entering the waters of the Menam, and to declare that under present circumstances the Government of his Majesty is unable to consent to the presence in this river of more than one warship of any State. All necessary instructions to that effect have been given to our naval and military authorities.\"\n\nObviously the position was now such that unless one party receded hostilities were inevitable. At Paris the news of the uncompromising character of the Siamese opposition had made an impressionthe greater, no doubt, because opinion in Great Britain at the time was greatly excited at the course of events in Siam, and strong pressure was being brought to bear by Lord Rosebery upon the French Government to take no action which would precipitate hostilities. Orders were sent out to the admiral in command of the French Indo-Chinese squadron to issue instructions that the French ships should remain outside the bar. Unfortunately the instructions did not reach the Menam in time to prevent the step which was fraught with so much danger to peace.\n\nOn the evening of July 13th the two French warships hauled up their anchors, and the Inconstant, with the master of a small French coasting ship, the J. B. Say, acting as pilot, proceeded up the river. What further happened is narrated by Captain Jones in a despatch to Lord Rosebery of the date July 17, 1893 :\"It was now approaching dusk, the tide was rapidly rising, and some trading-vessels were passing through the channel to the south. As soon as they had cleared it the commander of the Inconstant gave the signal to enter, the J. B. Say (which had already provided itself with a local pilot) leading the way. A heavy thunder-cloud, with torrential rain, helped to conceal the vessels from the batteries, and as soon as they were abreast of the outer fort the Inconstant steamed ahead, going on the flood tide at the rate of twelve knots, and exchanged shots with the forts and Siamese ships which had begun to take part in the engagement.\n\n\"The firing on both sides seems to have been of the wildest, as comparatively few casualties happened to ships or men. The French have lost three men killed and the same number wounded ; the Siamese return fifteen killed (solely by the machine-guns in the tops) and about twenty wounded. The J. B. Say was struck by a shot alter leaving the channel, and foundered shortly after. The ships were under fire altogether about twenty-five minutes.\n\n\"The intelligence that the French ships had succeeded in forcing their way had scarcely reached Bangkok before the vessels themselves arrived and anchored near to the French Legation. The Siamese fleet followed closely after, intending to bring them to action in the river, but fortunately orders arrived from the King to abstain from attack, and the night passed by both parties in making preparations for the morrow.\n\n\"As those charged with the defence of the river had repeatedly assured the King that the passage of the bar had been rendered absolutely impracticable by the measures takensinking of ships, torpedoes, &c.the news of the French success fell on the Court like a thunderclap, as no preparations had been made in case of insuccess, but everything was at once done by the King's command to secure and maintain order, and although great excitement and alarm prevailed among the European merchantscaused chiefly by the menacing conduct and hostile demonstrations of the French ships during the night-yet nothing happened to provoke riot or revolution, and tranquillity has continued until the present time.\n\n\"All danger was to be feared from the King putting into execution his original resolution of abandoning his capital and retreating into the interior, taking with him his troops, Court, and chief functionaries, under which circumstances anarchy would follow at once, and the whole city be abandoned to the criminal classes and their work of fire and plunder.\n\n\"Happily, also, nothing has occurred from stoppage of trade, &c, to force the principal traders to close their rice or teak mills up to the present time, which would have thrown out of work many thousands of Chinese coolies, the most turbulent and reckless class of the population.\n\n\"The arrival of her Majesty's ship Linnet early on the 14th inst. tended most materially to reassure those who feared immediate riot and destruction. The presence of a Dutch gunboat also went far to restore confidence.\n\n\"Many causes have been assigned by the chief actors themselves to explain away their failure in preventing the French vessels passing the barthe approaching dusk, hastened by the sudden thunderstorm, obscured the view of the vessels from the forts ; the obstacles in the channel were insufficient to impede their progress, and of the two torpedoes fired, one exploded too soon and the other too late.\n\n\"The officer in charge of the defence wished to close the channel effectually and altogether on the morning of the 13th, but in view of the generally favourable and reassuring political prospects at that moment, and the expected arrival of the Austrian Crown Prince, his advice was overruled in the King's Council.\"\n\nHaving made good their entrance to the river, the French were content to rest on their laurels for a few days and await events. As, however, it soon became evident that their successful coup had brought them no nearer a solution of the difficulty, the French Government, on July 20, sent through M. Pavie the following ultimatum to the Siamese authorities :\n\n\" Recognition of the rights of Cambodia and Annam to left bank of river Mekong and the Islands.\n\n\"The Siamese shall evacuate, within one month's time, any posts which are there held by them.\n\n\"Satisfaction for the various acts of aggression against French ships and sailors in the river Menam and against French subjects in Siam.\n\n\"Pecuniary indemnities to the families of the victims and punishment of the culprits.\n\n\"For various damages inflicted on French subjects indemnities of 2,000,000 fr.\n\n\"As a guarantee for the claims under clauses 4 and 5 the sum of 3,000,000 fr. in dollars shall be at once deposited, or, in default, the farming of the taxes of Siemrep and Battambong shall be assigned to the French.\n\n\"In the event of the non-acceptance of these terms the French Minister will leave Bangkok and the blockade of the coast will at once take place.\n\n\"The Siamese Minister for Foreign Affairs, in view of the French demands for immediate surrender of the country to the east of Mekong, calls the attention of her Majesty's Government to conditions on which Kiang Chiang was transferred to Siam.\"\n\nThe following reply was returned by Siam to the French ultimatum :\n\n\"The King of Siam declares that no explicit definition has as yet ever been made to the Siamese Government as to what constitutes the rights of Cambodia and Annam on the Mekong. But as H.M. is anxious at once to secure peace and security for his people, he agrees to cede to France the country lying to the south of the 18th parallel of latitude and to the east of the Mekong.\n\n\"The withdrawal of all Siamese posts within the above-mentioned territory to take place forthwith.\n\n\"The loss of life which has occurred in the recent actions between the French and the Siamese forces is regretted by the King, and the satisfaction required by France will be given in accordance with ordinary justice and the independence of Siam, which the French Government affect to respect.\n\n\"Those found guilty of illegal aggression will receive condign punishment, and the sufferers will receive due reparation.\n\n\"The King agrees to pay the indemnity demanded on account of the claims advance by French subjects, although the justice of many of them has been denied by the Siamese. H.M., however, suggests that a joint commission should first investigate these claims.\n\n\"The sum of 3,000,000 fr. required as guarantee will be deposited, concurrently with the exchange of notes between the representatives of France and Siam. After the equitable adjustment of all reasonable claims, the King trusts that French justice will restore to Siam any sum which may remain over.\n\n\"This compliance with the demands of France will, the King trusts, be looked upon as a proof of his sincere desire to live with the French Republic on terms of friendship.\"\n\nThis submission, though it conceded almost everything, did not satisfy the French. M. Pavie sent in reply a letter in which he announced that in conformity with instructions from his Government he was transferring the protection of French nationals and protected persons to the Netherlands Consul-General, and that on July 26th he intended to embark on the Inconstant. Acting up to this declaration, M. Pavie left Bangkok and settled at the island of Koh-si-chang.\n\nOn July 28th Admiral Humann, who had just arrived with some ships of the French squadron from Saigon, issued a notice that a strict blockade would commence on July 29. The proclamation excited the greatest consternation in British commercial circles, and the wires were set in motion to avert what was feared would prove a disastrous blow to trade. The representative mercantile bodies at home took up the question in earnest. In forcible language the Leeds Chamber of Commerce represented to the Government the great concern they felt at the action of France towards Siam action which they regarded \"as threatening both the independence and the stability of a friendly and unaggressive neighbour and the large trading interests in this country.\" Other not less urgent representations were made by other bodies.\n\nThe blockade continued with some exciting incidents until August 3rd, when, much to the relief of everybody, it was raised and diplomatic relations were restored between Siam and France. The event which had brought about this much to be desired change from the atmosphere of war to peace was the conclusion of an agreement between the British and the French Governments to make the frontier question a matter of diplomatic arrangement between themselves.\n\nThe negotiations were commenced at Paris at the end of July, when Lord Dufferin, the British ambassador, had an interview with M. Develle, the French Foreign Minister.\n\nNarrating the circumstances of this interview, Lord Dufferin, writing on July 23, says :\"After a preliminary conversation, I informed M. Develle that I had been sent with instructions to enter upon a friendly interchange of ideas with him in reference to the Siamese question, and more especially with regard to the interpretation which the French Government intended to place upon the first article of their ultimatum, namely, the demand that Siam should recognise 'the left bank of the Mekong ' as the western boundary of the French possessions in Indo-China. I then communicated to his Excellency in very exact and careful language the entire substance of your Lordship's instructions to me as contained in your despatch of July 20th, and I insisted at some length on the various considerations which had induced your Lordship to suppose that in using the term 'the left bank of the Mekong' his Excellency could not have intended to claim for France the immense tracts of Siamese territory extending not to the east; and abutting upon Annam, but to the northwards of the Upper Mekong, and conterminous with China, not to mention the districts lying beyond which had been incorporated with her Majesty's Empire of India after the conquest of Burmah.\n\n\"M. Develle replied that as it was with Siam, and with Siam alone, that France was dealing, there could be no question of her laying claim to any territory outside the kingdom of Siam, no matter how situated, and he incidentally gave the the further assurance that there was no truth in the report that his Government had any intention of taking possession of the Siamese provinces of Battambang and Angkor.\n\n\"I then produced a map which I had brought with me, and, pointing out the way in which the Mekong makes a sudden bend just above the 18th parallel of latitude to the southward and westward and the subsequent bend in the same direction at the 20th parallel, I asked M. Develle whether the extensive territories at these points between the Mekong and the actual French boundary depicted upon the existing French maps, comprising the Principality of Luang Prabang and other districts, were also claimed by France as lying on 'the left bank of the Mekong.' M. Develle said that they were intended to be included under that definition, and that France claimed a right to Luang Prabang and the adjacent countries as being ancient and historic dependencies of Annam ; and that, furthermore, she had always insisted that her territorial sovereignty extended all along the left bank of the Mekong. I ventured to express my extreme surprise at this latter statement, and I called M. Develle's attention to the fact that on several occasions M. Waddington, in his communications with the Marquis of Salisbury, had in the most explicit terms repudiated any such pretensions on behalf of his Government. . . .\n\n\"I further remarked that even if France has persistently advanced such a claim as M. Develle has supposed, which certainly she had not done through any authoritative channel, a claim by no means proved a right, and that many claims advanced both by nations and by individuals had been found on examination to be unsubstantial and unjust.\n\n\"I then recurred to the proposed absorption by France of Luang Prabang and the adjacent districts, an area comprising nearly 100,000 square miles, which had been universally recognised for years past as integral parts of the Siamese kingdom, and I recalled M. Develle's attention to that part of your Lordship's instructions in which you desire me to insist on the incompatibility of the confiscation by France of so considerable a proportion of the kingdom of Siam with M. Develle's and the French Government's previous assurances that they had no intention to allow their dispute with Siam on the Lower Mekong to entail any measures which would jeopardise her integrity or her independence. How could these professions, I asked, which I knew had been made in perfect sincerity, be reconciled with the slicing off of what amounted to nearly a third of the kingdom ?\n\n\"M. Develle listened to me with his usual courtesy and attention, and it was impossible not to feel that he was giving a very anxious consideration to my arguments. He seemed particularly struck with what I told him about M. Waddington's communications to Lord Salisbury on the subject.\n\n\"I then proceeded to touch upon another aspect of the question. I said that our two Governments were pretty well agreed upon one very important point, namely, that it was desirable that France and England should not become limitrophe in Asia, and that Siam as an independent State should be left as a buffer between them. Again referring to the map, I pointed out that were France to take possession of the left bank of the Upper Mekong, it would bring her into direct contiguity with Burmah, in consequence of the two rapid bends which the northern Mekong takes to the westward, and that the approach of a great military Power like France to a frontier at present lying naked to attack could not be regarded by us with indifference, even if the previous considerations I had submitted to him were for the moment to be left out of account. And in this connection I called M. Develle's attention to the fact that in our recent cession to Siam of a Shan State which has hitherto been subject to Burmah, we had expressly stipulated that it should never be allowed to pass under the jurisdiction of another Power, and that, consequently, we ourselves possessed a reversionary interest in this portion of Siamese territory 'which was situated on the left bank of the Mekong.'\n\n\"Although there are some further considerations which it may be desirable to submit to M. Develle, I thought that I had said enough for the present, and I therefore concluded by impressing upon him in as earnest terms as I could command the extreme gravity which the situation might assume were the French demands to be pressed upon Siam beyond what was just and reasonable and in conformity with the legitimate interests of other Powers. Was it worth while, I asked, for the sake of a violent acquisition of territory to which France herself must know she had no legal right, to risk such grave complications as must inevitably arise were the claim to the left bank of the Mekong to be interpreted in an unrestricted and literal sense ? But I said that if I rightly understood the terms of the first article of the ultimatum as verbally communicated to Mr. Phipps (for we had never received a copy of it), it had itself contained some sort of qualification in a geographical reference to Cambodia and Annam. In any event M. Develle could not have failed to understand that, although at the outset of the dispute the English Government had considered the misunderstanding between France and her Siamese neighbour in regard to obscure questions of delimitation on the Lower Mekong as beyond their purview, the situation was entirely changed when the expanding claims of the French Government jeopardised the integrity of the entire kingdom of Siam, brought France nearly half-way down to Bangkok and into actual juxtaposition with ourselves and Burmah. Such a transformation of the French pretensions was undoubtedly calculated to excite alarm in England and the most serious apprehensions in the mind of her Majesty's Government.\n\n\"After again listening with the most courteous attention to this further exposition of our views, M. Develle observed that the terms of the first article of his ultimatum having been published to the world, and all France being acquainted with them, he could not now alter them, especially under manifest pressure from us. Public opinion in France was equally excited. The Siamese had been guilty of various outrages and had committed considerable wrongs on French subjects. They had fired upon French ships of war, and we must not be surprised at France pursuing a line of conduct which England herself would have adopted in similar circumstances. But he himself was quite ready to recognise the force of my observations in regard to the necessity of leaving a 'buffer' between the Asiatic possessions of France and England and thus leave a door open for future negotiations. I thought it prudent to ask H.E. to give me an assurance that an acceptance on the part of the Siamese of the first article of the ultimatum should not militate against a settlement of this part of the question in the sense desired by us. He was good enough formally to promise that it should not, inasmuch as it referred to a different order of idea and was a matter of joint interest to Great Britain and to France. In any event, he added, he must consult his experts. This observation filled me, I confess, with considerable misgivings. Of course, I could raise no objection to such a course, but in as courteous a manner as was possible I ventured to observe that subordinates in a public office were often fanatically anxious about special points and were prone to sacrifice the larger interests of their country in pursuit of their own narrow preoccupations, and that it was his Excellency who was responsible for the peace of Europe and the world, about which these experts generally cared but little.\"\n\nLord Dufferin a day or two later had a second interview with M. Develle, when the discussion on the question of a territorial arrangement was renewed. In a despatch of the date July 26th the British ambassador recounts the results of this further exchange of views :\" We proceeded to renew our discussion on the main question, during the course of which we went over a good deal of the ground which we had covered at our interview on Saturday, M. Develle still maintaining his two previous theses :\n\nfirst, that Luang Prabang was an actual dependency of Annam, and,\n\nsecondly, that France ab antiquo had vindicated her right to the left bank of the Mekong.\n\nUpon my part I urged that to adduce Annam's historical claim to Luang Prabang was a dangerous line of argument, for we might on almost equally tangible grounds demand the retrocession of Normandy, Gascony, and Guierine. M. Develle knew as well as I did that in every French Annuaire, in every French map, in every French geographical gazetteer Luang Prabang, until a year ago, had been described as an integral part of Siam. It was true that within the last twelve months a mysterious revolution had occurred in the minds of French geographical authorities, but as an honest man he must be convinced, as I was, that the district in question was and had been for nearly a century bona fide Siamese territory, and that it could not be confiscated by France without a flagrant infringement of the formal assurances he had given us not to impair the integrity of Siam. As for the pretension advanced by France ab antique to the left bank of the Mekong, such a supposition was not only contradicted by M. Waddington's express declarations on the subject, but by the further fact that under the Franco-Siamese Convention of 1886 the French had claimed the right of sending a Vice-Consul to Luang Prabang. This in itself was an absolute proof that the locality belonged to Siam. M. Develle objected that the Convention in question had been refused ratification by the French Chambers. That, I said, did not in any degree affect my contention. The draft Convention distinctly showed in what light Luang Prabang was at that time regarded by the French Government.\n\n\"M. Develle then proceeded to reinforce his previous arguments by various other considerationsamongst them that the tribes on the western borders of Tonquin had been lately giving a good deal of trouble, and that it was necessary therefore that they should be subjected to French authority, and he endeavoured to minimise the character of the contemplated annexation.\n\n\"At this point M. Develle put up the shutters on this compartment by saying that the ultimatum having once been published to France and to Siam, it was impossible for the Government, in the excited state of public opinion, to withdraw or modify it.\n\n\"After expressing my great regret at so untoward an intimation in regard to the ultimatum, which I could not help thinking had been launched somewhat 'a la légère,' I suggested to M. Develle that we should proceed to a discussion of the further aspect of the question, namely, as it affected English interests apart from those of Siam, and I again reminded him that it was quite out of the question that we should accept an arrangement which made France conterminous with our Indian Empire. France herself had always advocated the policy of introducing an independent State as a 'buffer' between the two countries, and it was evident that it was for the advantage of both France and England that a neutral territory should intervene between them. To this M. Develle cordially assented. He said that he fully recognised our right to intervene in the Franco-Siamese question on these grounds, and that he was most anxious to consult our wishes and interests in the matter, whether as regarded our predilectionin favour of the 'buffer' principle or our desire for facilities for trade with China in that neighbourhood. I then asked him whether he had in his own mind considered the width of the area which should be left between our respective frontiers, and as we bent over the map together I pointed out the Namu, which flows into the Mekong a little to the west of Luang Prabang, as affording a suitable line of demarcation, if we were driven to a solution on this basis and our views in regard to Luang Prabang were to be ignored. His Excellency did not seem to be averse to this suggestion, though he subsequently said he would prefer to substitute its western watershed for the river itself, on the understanding that a parallel line should demarcate the Burmese frontier between the Salween and the Mekong. On this I told him that, to the best of my belief, such a line already existed. In right of Burmah the jurisdiction of England had been extended over the Shan province of Kyaing Chaing, which lay on both sides of the Mekong, but with the view of consulting French susceptibilities, and in order to avoid the appearance of advancing too far eastwards, we ourselves had already re-enforced the ' buffer' principle by handing this province over to Siam, and retiring to a considerable distance westwards from the Mekong.\"\n\nTo facilitate matters the British Government sent to Captain Jones instructions to recommend the Siamese authorities to make an immediate and unconditional compliance with the French demands. The advice thus given was taken, with the consequence that the blockade was raised, as already related, and the way paved for an amicable discussion of the territorial question. The arrival at Bangkok at the beginning of August of M. le Myre de Velers as a special Minister Plenipotentiary indicated the importance which the French Government attached to the negotiations. M. le Myre de Velers was a former Governor-General of Indo-China, and a man of much experience in the ways of Oriental diplomacy. He had not been long in the Siamese capital before he found that the settlement of outstanding questions was not to be an easy one.\n\nThe Siamese Government was sore under the series of humiliations which had been inflicted upon it, the last and not the least of which was the forced acceptance by it of a series of conditions embracing the occupation by French troops of the river and port of Chantabun and a prohibition against the stationing of Siamese troops anywhere within twenty-five kilometres of the Mekong river.\n\nThe king, under the depression of the situation, had retired to his Summer Palace, a considerable distance from the capital, and was disinclined to return to receive the French representative. M. de Velers, however, insisted on a full measure of respect being shown him, and eventually an arrangement was made by which he was received at the palace at Bangkok on the same day that a court function was held which necessitated the king's presence there.\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations had been entered upon, on the Siamese side in a half-hearted, dilatory fashion. The king retired once more to his Summer Palace, and his ministers found it practically impossible to induce him to give his attention to the pressing question of the moment. M. de Velers' eager spirit chafed under the delay. At length, after repeated and ineffectual protests, he on September 27th formally handed to Prince Derawongse a convention drawn up by the French Foreign Minister in Paris, with an intimation that he would leave Siam in four days whether the conditions set forth in the document were accepted or not. This had the desired effect. At the last moment the terms were accepted by the Siamese Government unconditionally, and on October 3rd the treaty and convention were duly signed.\n\nWhile the pressing dangers of the situation had been removed by this surrender on the part of the Siamese Government, there yet remained for adjustment the delicate question of the arrangement of the frontier and the determination of the limits of the British and French spheres of influence in the watershed of the Mekong.\n\nIn the long and important despatch of Lord Dufferin of July 23rd quoted above it is shown that at that time the British and French Governments had practically reached an agreement to accept the principle of a buffer Siamese State between British Burma and French Indo-China. The somewhat stormy controversy which arose out of the enforcement by the French of a blockade of the Menam river thrust the frontier question for a time into the background, and it was not until the storm clouds which seemed to threaten a rupture between Great Britain and France had cleared away that the threads of the negotiations were once more seriously taken up. An agreement was now reached without much difficulty.\n\nOn September 2nd Lord Rosebery was able to write in the following satisfactory terms to Lord Dufferin :\" The difference between France and Siam, which at one time assumed so threatening an aspect, has happily been brought to a peaceful settlement. It was one in the later and more serious phases of which Great Britain could not be otherwise than greatly concerned, on account of her preponderant commercial intercourse with Siam, of her friendly relations with that kingdom, her desire to preserve its independence, and in view of the expediency, in the interests both of France and Great Britain, of maintaining a neutral territory between the British and French possessions in those regions.\n\n\"The French Government have shown themselves equally alive to the importance of this last consideration, and your Excellency has been able to come to an agreement with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs as to the general principle of an arrangement for securing the object in view ; and I do not doubt that on your return to Paris you will find M. Develle ready to negotiate with you the details of that arrangement.\"\n\nThe agreement to which Lord Rosebery referred in his despatch settled merely the principle of the establishment of a buffer State, and the exact boundaries had still to be fixed. For this purpose a joint commission was appointed by the Governments concerned. There was considerable delay in the taking of the preliminary measures, and it was not until December, 1894, that the commissioners got to work. Many more months passed before they had fully completed their labours.\n\nFinally, on January 15, 1896, an understanding was reached by Great Britain and France under which the two Powers agreed to the special treatment of that portion of Siam which is comprised within the drainage basin of the Menam and of the coast streams of a corresponding latitude. Within this area the two Powers undertook that they would not operate by their military or naval forces, except so far as they might do it in concert for any purpose which might be required for maintaining the independence of Siam. They also undertook not to acquire within that area any privileges or commercial facilities which were not extended to both of them.\n\nLord Salisbury (who had by this time once more taken charge of foreign affairs), in a despatch of January 15, 1896, thus summarised the points of the agreement :\n\n\"It might be thought that because we have engaged ourselves, and have received the engagement of France, not under any circumstances to invade this territory, that therefore we are throwing doubt upon the complete title and rights of the Siamese to the remainder of their kingdom, or, at all events, treating those rights with disregard. Any such interpretation would entirely misrepresent the intention with which this agreement has been signed. We fully recognise the rights of Siam to the full and undisturbed enjoyment, in accordance with long usage or with existing treaties, of the entire territory comprised within her dominions ; and nothing in our present action would detract in any degree from the validity of the rights of the King of Siam to those portions of his territory which are not affected by this treaty. We have selected a particular area for the stipulations of this treaty, not because the title of the King of Siam is less valid, but because it is the area which affects our interests as a commercial nation. The valley of the Menam is eminently fitted to receive a high industrial development. Possibly in course of time it may be the site of lines of communication which will be of considerable importance to neighbouring portions of the British Empire. There seems every prospect that capital will flow into this region if reasonable security is offered for its investment, and great advantage would result to the commerce and industry of the world, and especially of Great Britain, if capitalists could be induced to make such an application of the force which they command. But the history of the region in which Siam is situated has not in recent years been favourable to the extension of industrial enterprise, or to the growth of that confidence which is the first condition of material improvement. A large territory to the north has passed from the hands of the Burmese Government to those of Great Britain. A large territory to the east has passed from the hands of its former possessors to those of France. The events of this recent history certainly have a tendency to encourage doubts of the stability of the Siamese dominion ; and without in any degree sharing in these doubts, or admitting the possibility within any future with which we have to deal of the Siamese independence being compromised, her Majesty's Government could not but feel there would be an advantage in giving some security to the commercial world that in regard to the region where the most active development is likely to take place no further disturbances of territorial ownership are to be apprehended. . . . Her Majesty's Government hope that the signature of this agreement will tend to foster the industrial growth of all these extensive districts ; and they have been sufficiently impressed with this belief to be willing to attest it by admitting the French claims to the ownership of the Mong Hsing district of Keng Cheng, a triangular portion of territory on the eastern side of the Upper Mekong. Its extent and intrinsic value are not large, and, on account of its unhealthy character, it has no great attractions for Great Britain, though her title to it as formerly tributary to Burmah appears to us evidently sound ; but its retention by her might prove a serious embarrassment to the cheap and effective administration by France of her possessions in that neighbourhood.\"\n\nLord Salisbury's views as to the satisfactory character of the settlement were supported by the Government of India. In a despatch of May 6, 1896, referring to the cession of Mong Hsing, the Indian authorities wrote : \"We were prepared to cede this district to Siam in 1893 and include it in a buffer State in 1894, and though we were reluctantly compelled to occupy it in 1895, we have all along recognised that this small excrescence on the other side of the Mekong could be of no advantage or profit to us.\n\n\"... We accept the settlement now made with France as advantageous to the interests of Burma and the Shan States, and the limitation of our frontiers to the Mekong as making for economy and efficiency in the civil and political administration of the border. Under some circumstances a possible loss of prestige amongst the Shan chiefs might have been involved in the renouncing of territory formerly belonging to Burma, and so recently claimed as part of the dominions of the Queen Empress. This, however, had been discounted by the previously announced cession of Keng Cheng to Siam and the consequent doubt and uncertainty as to the future of the State. Moreover, we have now a convenient opportunity of compensating the Keng Tung State, which will gain in Cis-Mekong, Keng Cheng, and Keng Lap territory exceeding in area and value both the Trans-Mekong tracts which it now loses and also those which passed to Siam under the frontier settlement of 1894.\"\n\nThus the crisisthe greatest in modern Siamese historypassed. Siam emerged from it with greatly diminished territory, a depleted treasury, and damaged prestige. But, severe as was her trial, it is at least a debateable point whether in the long run she will not gain more than she has lost by the transaction. The disputed territory which she had to surrender was valuable more from its future possibilities than its present worth. Siamese rule over the greater part of it was very shadowy, and it brought little or nothing to her exchequer. As a set-off to it she had the guarantee of the integrity of the acknowledged territory of Siam under an instrument to which the two greatest European colonising Powers had set their seal. Such an arrangement was calculated to have a tranquillising effect on the political relations of Siam, and at the same time a stimulating influence on her material interests. That has been the actual result. From the moment that the Siamese Government reluctantly agreed to the convention with France the country entered upon a new and prosperous era. Trade expanded, the revenue prospered, and the name and fame of Siam abroad extended.\""
