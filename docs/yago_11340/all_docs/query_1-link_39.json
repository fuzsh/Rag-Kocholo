        "text": "The year 1932 is very important in the history of Thailand. It opened the gates for the democratic political process. The royal courtiers and then existing elite were replaced by a new structure consisting of civil service and military officers. They had a new zeal and set of ideas about the development of Thailand. Dr. Thanapol Chadchaidee has selected to study the process of political change since 1932. He hadmade the case study of: 1) the late Dr. Pridi Banomyong (1900-1983), 2) the late Prime Minister Kukrit Pramoj (1911-1995), 3) the late Professor Dr. Chai-Anan Samudavanija (1944-2018) and 4) former Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai (1938 to present). These are the key figures in this period. They have made decisive impact on the Thai political system in order to make it more democratic. Dr. Thanapol has explained their role in changing the nature of the Thai political process. Dr. Thanapol's work is unique and original and perhaps the first of its kind in the academic field of Thailand. Dr. Thanapol has tried his best to give justice to these four key politicians and made an important contribution in this field. I hope that this book will be useful to students and academicians in Thailand as well as abroad. It seems that Dr. Thanapol has become a very useful bridge between India and Thailand."
