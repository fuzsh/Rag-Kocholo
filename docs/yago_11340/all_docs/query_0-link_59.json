        "text": "Embodying modernity and nationality was a self-improvement task for fin de siècle Siamese monarchs. In post-1932 Siam, kingly bodies no longer wielded the semantic and social potency necessary to inhabit the whole of a nation. Siam required a corporeal reassignment to signify a new era. This study examines previously neglected propaganda materials the Phibunsongkhram regime produced in 1941 to recruit women for nation building, specifically, the texts supplementing Cultural Mandate 10 addressed to the “Thai Sisters.” I argue that with the Thai Sisters texts, the regime relocated modernization and nation building from male royal bodies onto the bodies of women. Moreover, these texts specified gendered roles in nation building and inserted nationalism into the private lives of women by framing nationbuilding tasks as analogous to self-improvement and the biological and emotional experiences of a mother. Vestimentary nation building prescribed by Mandate 10 turned popular magazines into patriotic battlegrounds where all Thai Sisters were gatekeepers and enforcement came in the form of photo spreads, advertisements, and beauty pageants. By weaving nation building into fashion and the private lives of women, the Phibunsongkhram regime made the (self-)policing of women’s bodies—formerly restricted to elite women—not only essential but also fashionable and patriotic for all Thai Sisters.\n\nPublic attire and policies governing it have been a reoccurring feature of Siamese/Thai nation building since the nineteenth century. Clothing has been political instruments for rulers and regime in raising the global status of Siam and Siamese Kings, transforming the Kingdom of Siam into the Nation of Thailand, reviving the popularity of the monarchy, promoting national unity, and provoking political opponents. Their collective efforts during the past one and half century gradually normalised the policing of Thai bodies and increased the state control of public attire in service of the Nation. Today, despite such attire no longer being criminalised, the possible negative political, social, economic, and legal consequences of non-conformity continue to drive Thais to accept the State’s ‘invitation’ to use their bodies in promoting its agenda.\n\nTamnan Phutthachedi Siam [A History of Buddhist Monuments in Siam], first published in 1926 by Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, is one of the best cases showing the rise of the chronicle of Thai art history. In other words, the book constructs a plot of Thai art history that has had a major influence on the development of Thai art history until now. This paper aims to reconsider Tamnan Phutthachedi Siam in relation to the social and political contexts of Thai society. The paper suggests that the plot constructions in Tamnan Phutthachedi Siam were influenced by the transformation of the Thai state, from a customary state to an absolute monarchy, in the late 19th century, and, for that reason, represents the changing power relations in Thai society."
