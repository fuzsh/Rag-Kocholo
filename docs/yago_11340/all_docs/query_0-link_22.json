She performed her duties so well and so satisfactorily that, on the recommendation from the Government, Her Majesty was given a title of higher distinction, \"Somdej Praboroma Rajineenath\" (สมเด็จพระบรมราชินีนาถ). H.M. Queen Sirikit is only the second Queen to be so honored; Queen Saovabha Phongsri—wife of His Majesty King Chulalongkorn, the Great (Rama V)—was the first Thai Queen to be so honored as Regent when King Chulalongkorn was traveling abroad."
