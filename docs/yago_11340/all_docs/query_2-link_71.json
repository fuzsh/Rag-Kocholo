June originated from an area of convection that was first witnessed on August 15 in the Philippine Sea. Despite initial wind shear, the area intensified into a tropical storm three days later as it tracked westward. After tracking over Luzon, June entered the South China Sea on August 30. Despite remaining poorly organized, June re-intensified over land, and it was estimated to have briefly attained typhoon intensity before striking China, just to the east of Hong Kong, at maximum intensity, although its remnants were last noticed on September 3. Affecting the country four days before Typhoon Ike would devastate the Philippines, June brought widespread damage to the nation. Throughout the Philippines, 470,962 people sought shelter. A total of 671 homes were destroyed, with 6,341 others damaged. A total of 121 people were killed, while 17 other individuals were reportedly missing, and 26 other people were wounded. Damage totaled $24.2 million (1984 USD, including $15.24 million in agriculture and $8.82 million in infrastructure). Following June and Ike, several major countries provided cash and other goods.

In BSS, two images of differing signal strengths are repetitively switched between the left and right eye at a constant rate of 1 Hertz. During this process of switching, the image of lower contrast and signal strength is perceptually suppressed for a period of time. Other techniques for such manipulation include binocular rivalry, continuous flash suppression (CFS), visual masking and flicker switch suppression. Similar to binocular rivalry and CFS, BSS works by controlling the signal strength of each respective stimulus and also by managing neural adaption. However, BSS is able to achieve better quality perceptual suppression and longer suppression periods than these other tools. Moreover, unlike other methods, BSS allows one to investigate the neural and behavioural consequences during the period of visual suppression itself and not just after the presentation of the target stimuli.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n18.470339\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Marc Gordon' Marcus Melvin \"Marc\" Gordon (October 14, 1935\n\nMarcus Melvin \"Marc\" Gordon (October 14, 1935 – July 23, 2009) was an American jazz drummer and composer.

Prevents me from going to school by having, for example, supposed prayer times that coincide with school hours. Thanks! Please explain like I' m five.\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the freedom of religion, which means that you have the right to believe and practice whatever religion you choose. However, this freedom is not absolute and can be limited in certain circumstances to protect the rights and safety of others. In the case you described, going to school is not a matter of personal belief or religious practice. It is a legal requirement for children of a certain age to attend school in order to receive an education. By not going to school, you would be breaking the law and could be charged for truancy or failing to comply with compulsory education laws. Even if you tried to claim that your religion prevents you from going to school, the government has the right to regulate certain activities that could interfere with the education of children or the functioning of schools. The government has a compelling interest in ensuring that children receive a proper education, and the First Amendment does not protect actions that would disrupt or interfere with this important goal. So, while you have the right to freely practice your religion, you still have to follow the laws and regulations that apply to everyone else, including those related to education.\n\nhc3-reddit_eli5\n\n1\n\n9.056276\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Suicide Act 1961' The Suicide Act 1961 (9 & 10\n\nThe Suicide Act 1961 (9 & 10 Eliz. 2 c. 37) is an Act of the United Kingdom Parliament that makes it an offence to attempt or commit suicide. It also makes it an offence to aid, abet, counsel or procure the commission of suicide. The maximum punishment for both offences is 14 years imprisonment. The Suicide Act was introduced in response to a rise in suicide rates in the United Kingdom. Prior to the act, there was no specific law dealing with suicide, and attempts to commit suicide were considered crimes based on common law principles. The act changed this by establishing a specific criminal offence of attempting or committing suicide, and making it an offence to provide assistance or encouragement to someone in commit suicide. The act has been controversial since its introduction, with some arguing that it is too broad and could be used to criminalize normal behaviors such as talking about suicide or providing support to someone who may be suicidal. Others argue that the act is necessary in order to protect the public from people who may attempt or commit suicide because they are feeling suicidal or emotional distressed.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n1\n\n7.188339\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Ethel Raybould' Ethel Harriet Raybould B.A., M.A. (1899–1987), was\n\nEthel Harriet Raybould B.A., M.A. (1899–1987), was a Canadian academic, educator and social worker.

The film concerns a mad painter of weird art who turns into a vampire-like man (with different features) by night, apparently as a result of a family curse, and believes that he has found his reincarnated mistress in the person of an avant-garde ballerina. Blood Bath had a complex and troubled production history, marked by various cuts and reshoots. In 1963 Roger Corman had co-produced a Yugoslavia-made spy thriller called Operation: Titian, but the film was deemed unreleasable. Corman purchased the rights to another film and assigned writer-director Jack Hill to write a new script. This time, it was a horror film that incorporated the previous footage from Operation: Titian. Hill wrote and directed numerous horror sequences that were edited into the film, and it was re-titled Portrait in Terror. Still unsatisfied with the completed product, Corman hired Stephanie Rothman to film additional sequences that were also added. This cobbled-together feature was given a brief theatrical release by American International Pictures under the title Blood Bath, with screenplay and directorial credit jointly shared by Hill and Rothman. An additional version of the film was made for television and re-titled Track of the Vampire.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n28.041792\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Al Liwa (newspaper)' Al Liwa (The Standard in English) was\n\nAl Liwa (The Standard in English) was an Arabic language newspaper which was published in Cairo, Egypt, in the period 1900–1912. It was the first mass circulation newspaper in the country. The paper was founded by Mustafa Kamil Pasha. From its start in 1900 to the death of its founder in 1908 Al Liwa adopted a nationalist political stance.

Landscape-scale conservation may sometimes be attempted because of climate change. It can be seen as an alternative to site based conservation. Many global problems such as poverty, food security, climate change, water scarcity, deforestation and biodiversity loss are connected. For example, lifting people out of poverty can increase consumption and drive climate change. Expanding agriculture can exacerbate water scarcity and drive habitat loss. Proponents of landscape management argue that as these problems are interconnected, coordinated approaches are needed to address them, by focussing on how landscapes can generate multiple benefits. For example, a river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for people and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; and each one of these users can have impacts on the others.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n18.527157\n\nWhy can't we use magnets as a source of energy? I've always thought cars should have magnetic strips and roads should have magnets. Then you can accelerate and brake by turning the magnet to the opposite polar ends. Excuse my ignorance. Explain like I' m five.\n\nHere's a thought experiment: What if you put one magnet in the road and one in your car? The car will get stuck on top of the magnet. In order to move on, to presumably the next magnet in the road, you need to turn the magnet in the car again. But the energy needed to turn the magnet is the same energy that is needed to move the car from one magnet to the next. So you're not using the magnets as an energy source, you're just using it as a way to convert the turning of the magnet into motion of the car. basically because energy can not be created nor destroyed. when we'make'energy, we are actually converting from one form to another. usually we convert from chemical energy by burning coal/gas; convert from atomic bond energy in nuclear power; from mechanical/movement energy with hydro-electric dams; and convert from solar energy with solar power. In each of these cases the energy is converted typically to electricity or mechanical power in the case of a car. this is what is known as the preservation of energy. when you hear of energy being'lost'it simply means that we did not convert it into power, but instead it usually turns to heat and escapes much like the heat in your house when you open the door. edit: typo When you arrange two magnets in such a way that they push each other in the opposite directions, you use at least as much energy to make this arrangement as is released when the magnets give you the push. If you don't believe me, feel free to try to find a way to bring the opposite ends of two magnets close to each other without using any force.\n\nhc3-reddit_eli5\n\n0\n\n19.027063\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Habenaria exilis' Habenaria exilis, commonly known as the wispy\n\nHabenaria exilis, commonly known as the wispy rein orchid, is a species of orchid that is endemic to a small area in far north Queensland.

The recording is a rarity among non-Beatles songs since it features three members of the band – Harrison, who also produced the track, Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney. Performed in the hard rock style, the song also includes musical contributions from Eric Clapton and session pianist Nicky Hopkins, and was the first of many Harrison productions for artists signed to the Beatles' record label. Harrison wrote \"Sour Milk Sea\" to promote Transcendental Meditation, which the Beatles had been studying in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In the lyrics, Harrison espouses meditation as a remedy for worldly cares. The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for their 1968 double album The Beatles (also known as the White Album).

Following his medical studies, he served in the German Army during First World War and became interested in the effect of stress and other environmental factors on the female reproductive system, the subject of his later research. In 1921 he became the youngest doctor to chair the medical department of a German university. He taught medicine at the University of Berlin, and was Director of the Berlin Institute of Anatomy at the Charité teaching hospital in the later years of his life. Much of Stieve's research was conducted during the 1930s, after the Nazi Party had come to power in Germany. He did not join the party himself, but as an ardent German nationalist supported Adolf Hitler in the hope of restoring national pride. The Nazis imprisoned and executed many of their political opponents, and their corpses became Stieve's primary research material, with his full awareness of their origin. While much of his work is still considered valuable—among other things, he provided scientific evidence that the rhythm method was not effective in preventing pregnancy—it is considered tainted by his effective collaboration with the Nazi regime's political repression, especially in light of its later genocides.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n19.039597\n\nCredit card closed. Effect on credit score (USA)\n\nSo My question is. Is my credit score going to be hit? Yes it will affect your credit. Not as much as missing payments on the debt, which remains even if the credit line is closed, and not as much as missing payments on other bills... If so what can I do about it? Not very much. Nothing worth the time it would take. Like you mentioned, reopening the account or opening another would likely require a credit check and the inquiry will add another negative factor. In this situation, consider the impact on your credit as fact and the best way to correct it is to move forward and pay all your bills on time. This is the number one key to improving credit score. So, right now, the key task is finding a new job. This will enable you to make all payments on time. If you pay on time and do not overspend, your credit score will be fine. Can I contact the creditors to appeal the decision and get them to not affect my score at the very least? I know they won' t restore the account without another credit check). Is there anything that can be done directly with the credit score companies? Depending on how they characterize the closing of the account, it may be mostly a neutral event that has a negative impact than a negative event. By negative events, I' m referring to bankruptcy, charge offs, and collections. So the best way to recover is to keep credit utilization below 30% and pay all your bills and debt payments on time. (You seem to be asking how to replace this line of credit to help you through your unemployment.) As for the missing credit line and your current finances, you have to find a way forward. Opening new credit account while you' re not employed is going to be very difficult, if not impossible. You might find yourself in a situation where you need to take whatever part time gig you can find in order to make ends meet until your job search is complete. Grocery store, fast food, wait staff, delivery driver, etc. And once you get past this period of unemployment, you' ll need to catch up on all bills, then you' ll want to build your emergency fund. You don' t mention one, but eating, paying rent/mortgage, keeping current on bills, and paying debt payments are the reasons behind the emergency fund, and the reason you need it in a liquid account. Source: I' m a veteran of decades of bad choices when it comes to money, of being unemployed for periods of time, of overusing credit cards, and generally being irresponsible with my income and savings. I' ve done all those things and am now paying the price. In order to rebuild my credit, and provide for my retirement, I' m having to work very hard to save. My focus being financial health, not credit score, I' ve brought my bottom line from approximately 25k in the red up to about 5k in the red. The first step was getting my payments under control. I have also been watching my credit score. Two years of on time mortgage payments, gradual growth of score. Paid off student loans, uptick in score. Opened new credit card with 0% intro rate to consolidate a couple of store line of credit accounts. Transferred those balances. Big uptick. Next month when utilization on that card hits 90%, downtick that took back a year' s worth of gains. However, financially, I' m not losing 50-100 a month to interest. TLDR; At certain times, you have to ignore the credit score and focus on the important things. This is one of those times for you. Find a job. Get back on your feet. Then look into living debt free, or working to achieve financial independence.\n\nhc3-finance\n\n0\n\n24.502001\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Linda J.

During interphase, the cell grows (G1), replicates its DNA (S) and prepares for mitosis (G2). A cell in interphase is not simply quiescent. The term quiescent (i.e. dormant) would be misleading since a cell in interphase is very busy synthesizing proteins, copying DNA into RNA, engulfing extracellular material, processing signals, to name just a few activities and things. The cell is quiescent only in the sense of cell division (i.e. the cell is out of the cell cycle, G0). Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life. Interphase is the 'daily living' or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, replicates its DNA in preparation for mitosis, and conducts other \"normal\" cell functions. Interphase was formerly called the resting phase. However, interphase does not describe a cell that is merely resting; rather, the cell is living and preparing for later cell division, so the name was changed. A common misconception is that interphase is the first stage of mitosis, but since mitosis is the division of the nucleus, prophase is actually the first stage.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n13.804363\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Louis P.

It is similar to MapReduce or Apache Spark but predates their development by a decade. It has been used as a data warehousing ETL, reporting, and application development platform. It was designed to support business systems using William McCarthy's theory of Resources, Events, Agents. GenevaERS was created by PricewaterhouseCoopers Consulting as part of their practice. (IBM acquired PwC Consulting in 2002.) IBM renamed GenevaERS IBM's Scalable Architecture for Financial Reporting (SAFR), marketing and licensing it through its IBM Global Services division, typically with customer-specific services. The product solves business intelligence problems for large operational databases, especially in insurance and financial industries. GenevaERS is also popular among SAP and other ERP system users, including manufacturing companies, with large databases and significant reporting needs. (Despite the SAFR name, GenevaERS is not confined to financial industry roles.) In July 2020, IBM contributed the SAFR code base to the Linux Foundation's Open Mainframe Project,.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n60.455975\n\nwhat is a form of legal ownership\n\nOwnership of property may be private, collective, or common and the property may be objects, land/real estate, or intellectual property.\n\nhc3-open_qa\n\n0\n\n22.20887\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Double minute' Double minutes are small fragments of extrachromosomal\n\nDouble minutes are small fragments of extrachromosomal DNA, which have been observed in a large number of human tumors including breast, lung, ovary, colon, and most notably, neuroblastoma. They are a manifestation of gene amplification as a result of chromothripsis, during the development of tumors, which give the cells selective advantages for growth and survival. This selective advantage is as a result of double minutes frequently harboring amplified oncogenes and genes involved in drug resistance. Double minutes, like actual chromosomes, are composed of chromatin and replicate in the nucleus of the cell during cell division. Unlike typical chromosomes, they are composed of circular fragments of DNA, up to only a few million base pairs in size and contain no centromere or telomere. Further to this, they often lack key regulatory elements, allowing genes to be constitutively expressed. Recently, some research groups are re-branding double minutes as ecDNA.

It is part of the \"unfinished\" series of Prigioni intended for the Tomb of Julius II. History It seems that from the first version of the tomb of Julius II (1505) a series of \"Prigioni\" was planned for the lowest level of the mausoleum – a series of more-than-life-size statues of chained figures in various poses, leaning on the pilasters which framed a set of niches, each of which would contain a \"winged Victory\". With one on each side of each niche, it must have been initially intended for there to be sixteen or twenty Prigioni. In the course of the reductions of the project which followed, this was reduced to twelve (second project, 1513), eight (third project, 1516) and finally perhaps a mere four (fourth or fifth version, 1526 or 1532), before they were completely eliminated from the project in 1542.

Please explain like I' m five.\n\nDrinking glasses are usually round because it's a shape that is easy to hold and drink from. Round glasses also have a nice, symmetrical appearance. Imagine you are holding a round glass in your hand. You can easily grip the glass with your fingers, and the weight of the glass is evenly distributed around your hand. This makes it comfortable to hold and drink from. Now imagine you are holding a glass that is shaped like a triangle or a square. These shapes might be more difficult to hold comfortably, and the weight of the glass might not be evenly balanced. So, in short, drinking glasses are usually round because it's a shape that is easy to hold and drink from, and it looks nice.

This has the result that, in a certain region, objects that are farther away from the lens produce larger images than objects that are closer to the lens, in stark contrast to the behavior of the human eye or any ordinary camera (both entocentric lenses), where farther-away objects always appear smaller. The geometry of a hypercentric lens can be visualized by imagining a point source of light at the center of the entrance pupil sending rays in all directions. Any point on the object will be imaged to the point on the image plane found by continuing the ray that passes through it, so the shape of the image will be the same as that of the shadow cast by the object from the imaginary point of light. So the closer an object gets to that point (the center of the entrance pupil), the larger its image will be.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n17.4946\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'The Moving Wall' The Moving Wall is a half-size replica\n\nThe Moving Wall is a half-size replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. It was devised by John Devitt after he attended the 1982 annual commemoration ceremonies celebrated in Washington for Vietnam veterans.

Devitt, Norris Shears, Gerry Haver, and other Vietnam veterans volunteered to build the Wall. It went on display for the first time in Tyler, Texas, in October 1984. Two structures of The Moving Wall now travel the United States from April through November, spending 5 or 6 days at each site.

On its visits, the Moving Wall is often escorted by state troopers or volunteer organizations such as the Patriot Guard Riders, who accompany the memorial on motorcycles.\n\nwiki-intro\n\n0\n\n51.478157\n\n200 word wikipedia style introduction on 'Dana Ivey' Dana Robins Ivey (born August 12, 1941)\n\nDana Robins Ivey (born August 12, 1941) is an American actress, director, and producer.
