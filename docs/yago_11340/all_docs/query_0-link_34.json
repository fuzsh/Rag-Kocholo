        "text": "Life\n\nSaovabha was born as a Princess of Siam to King Mongkut (or Rama IV) and Princess Consort Piyamavadi (Piam Sucharitakul). She was the youngest sister of the future Queen Sunandha Kumariratana and Queen Savang Vadhana. Saovabha became the consort of her half brother King Chulalongkorn sometime in 1878. She gave him 9 children, 5 would survive to adulthood (one died in infancy), two would eventually become King of Siam.\n\nIn 1897, Queen Saovabha became the first female Regent of Siam, when her husband went on a tour of Europe. When he returned he bestowed upon her the title of \"Somdet Phra Nang Chao Saowapha Phongsi Praborommarachininat\" (RTGS) (Thai: สมเด็จพระนางเจ้าเสาวภาผ่องศรี พระบรมราชินีนาถ) (roughly equivalent to H.M. the Queen Regent). During her time as queen she took many interests especially in the issues concerning women. In 1904 she established one of the first schools for girls in Siam; the \"Rajini School\" or Queen's School in Bangkok.\n\nWhen she died in 1919 at the age of 57, she was given a grand Royal Funeral, attended by all members of the Siamese Royal Family, and the ceremony was presided over by her son King Vajiravudh. She played a prominent posthumous role in the 1924 Palace Law of Succession, in which her son King Vajiravudh stipulated that her children would take precedence among all others over the line of succession. This guaranteed the accession of her youngest son Prince Prajadhipok to the throne in 1925, despite there being more senior and learned sons of Chulalongkorn. The Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute was named after her.\n\nChildren\n\nShe had 9 children with King Chulalongkorn:\n\nIn addition, the queen also adopted one of Savang Vadhana's daughters, Princess Valaya Alongkorn and raised as her own daughter.\n\nTitles and styles\n\n1864 – 1878: Her Royal Highness Princess Saovabha Phongsri\n\n1878 – 1897: Her Royal Highness Princess Saovabha Phongsri, The Princess Consort\n\n1897 – 1910: Her Majesty The Queen of Siam\n\n1910 – 1919: Her Majesty Queen Sri Bajrindra, the Queen Mother\n\nRoyal Decorations\n\nNational Orders\n\nThe Most Illustrious Order of the Royal House of Chakri\n\nThe Ancient and Auspicious of Order of the Nine Gems\n\nDame Grand Cross (First Class) of The Most Illustrious Order of Chula Chom Klao\n\nDame Grand Cordon (Special Class) of The Most Noble Order of the Crown of Thailand\n\nKing Rama IV Royal Cypher Medal (Second Class)\n\nKing Rama V Royal Cypher Medal (First Class)\n\nKing Rama VI Royal Cypher Medal (First Class)\n\nForeign Orders\n\nDame of the Order of Queen Maria Luisa (Kingdom of Spain)"
