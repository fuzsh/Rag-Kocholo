With a vision ‘to become a global brand by ornamenting the world’, Indian jeweller Joyalukkas will enter Southeast Asia for the first time this year – in Singapore.

“We are currently on a rapid expansion plan across the world with new showrooms set to open in many parts of India and the Middle East, in addition to this we are also venturing into Singapore shortly,” said John Paul Alukkas, executive director, Joyalukkas Group.

The company will open its first store in Singapore in April this year with an investment of Rs 50 crore (US$10.15 million), according to Alukkas.

Joyalukkas will also open shops-in-shops in eight cities in South India including Kozhikode, Thiruvananthapuram, Kottayam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Alappuzha, Coimbatore and Kochi.

Joyalukkas now has 85 stores across India, West Asia and the UK. While headquartered in Kochi, first Joyalukkas store was launched in Abu Dhabi in 1987. It has expanded to other Gulf countries including Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Bahrain. Only in 2002 did the company enter its domestic market with a store in Kottayam.

Joyalukkas jewelleries include golds, diamonds, pearls and other precious gems.
