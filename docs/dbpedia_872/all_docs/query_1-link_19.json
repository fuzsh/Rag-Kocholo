        "text": "Synopsis\n\nJoyalukkas has offered a varied range of jewellery handpicked from different parts of the world that have caught the fancy of customers.\n\nKOLKATA: When a young Joy Alukkas went to the Gulf in 1987 to open his family’s first overseas jewellery business, little did he know that his name will one day appear on the Forbes list of India’s 100 richest people. “I had nurtured only one dream — 100 outlets in 10 countries. And I am very closer to my goal,” says the 57-year-old who now owns 90 retail outlets in 10 countries.\n\nThe jewellery business was started by his father, Varghese Alukkas, in 1956 in Kerala. Joy Alukkas joined the family business in 1984 and in 1987 he decided to have an outlet in Abu Dhabi. A decade later he branched off to launch his own eponymous jewellery chain, Joyalukkas, which today is a Rs 10,000-crore business. It has stores in the UAE, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UK, Singapore and Malaysia. In India, Joyalukkas has 47 stores and plans are afoot to enter the US with its first shop in New York this fiscal year.\n\n“For the next five years we plan to open 10 outlets every year. Opening new outlets is my only entertainment,” says Alukkas, who was in Kolkata to open his 91st shop. The Kerala-based retailer is now focusing on increasing its presence in northern, western and eastern India.\n\nJoyalukkas’ jewellery business centres around three parameters — quality, variety and price, says Alukkas. While quality continues to be the primary growth driver, Joyalukkas has offered a varied range of jewellery handpicked from different parts of the world that have caught the fancy of customers.\n\n“Attractive pricing has also increased footfalls at our stores over the years. Making charge on our gold jewellery is less by 2% than our competitors. Similarly, the making charge on our diamond jewellery is less by 10-15% than the prevailing market rate,” Alukkas says.\n\nAlukkas is not keen to set up any manufacturing base, in India or abroad. “We have dedicated vendors in West Bengal, Jaipur, Nellore, Ahmedabad (and) Hyderabad from whom we source our jewellery,” he said. “Our retail outlets offer imported jewellery as well.”\n\nThe volatility in gold prices and the government’s decision to put a check on the yellow metal’s imports have not affected Joyalukkas’ business. “India is a gold-loving country and therefore we do not see a drop in demand. What we are seeing is that the new generation is gradually shifting away from heavy gold jewellery to more trendy studded jewellery where the gold content is around 18 carat. And we are tuning ourselves according to the trend,” says Joy.\n\nThough jewellery still continues to be the core business of the group, Joyalukkas has entered into other areas like textiles, money exchange, electronics retailing, luxury air charter and real estate. Jolly Silks, which is named after Alukkas’ wife, has three shops in Kerala and four in Dubai. “Five more shops will come up in south India soon. Joy Alukkas Digital that deals with electronics business has one outlet now but more will be opened going ahead. Joy Alukkas Lifestyle Developers is setting up residential projects in south India,” he says.\n\nJoy Jets has two aircraft that are used for personal purpose and are chartered out as well. Its non-jewellery businesses contribute an additional Rs 500 crore to the group’s turnover. It employs 6,500 people. Alukkas now does not shuttle between Dubai and Kochi like earlier years. “Now I spend 80% time in Kochi.”\n\n“My only son, John Paul Alukkas, now sits in Dubai and looks after overseas businesses,” says Alukkas who plans to take a break from his hectic schedule and fly off to his favourite destination, Australia, for a holiday.\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n3 key things Nirmala Sitharaman can do to restore Buddha’s legacy, draw global tourists\n\nWhy a new Sebi paper is making options traders sweat\n\nSpotted a flying saucer?
