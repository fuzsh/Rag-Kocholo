        "text": "The UAE-based Indian jewellery chain Joyalukkas, will build a state-of-the-art cancer specialty hospital in Trichur, Kerala. The hospital will offer free cancer treatment to poor patients as part of its CSR activities. The project is undertaken in collaboration with KIMS Group.\n\nAccording to Joy Alukkas, Group Chairman and Managing Director, Joyalukkas Group, the hospital will have 300 beds initially. Ten acres of land has already been acquired for the purpose and the project is scheduled for completion in the next two years, he said.\n\nJoy Alukkas was speaking at the Indian media representatives forum during the launch of 2012 edition of ‘Think Pink Awareness Campaign’.\n\nThe group has also reinforced their commitment to create awareness to educate the masses about breast cancer through its ‘Think Pink’ initiative this month. Joy Alukkas has joined hands with Zulekha Hospital to make the initiative bigger and better.\n\nThe World Health Organisation says breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide, comprising 16 per cent of all female cancers. Due to the stigma attached with the illness as well as lack of information, several women risk losing their lives.\n\nJoy Alukkas said, “We have decided to continue with ‘Think Pink’ as one of the key initiatives of our CSR division. We also recently organised our 25th blood donation drive.”\n\n“As a group we are committed to take up causes that help and assist mankind and we hope we manage to strengthen the fight against breast cancer this October,” added John Paul Joy Alukkas, Executive Director, Joyalukkas Group.\n\nThe Joyalukkas ‘Think Pink’ commenced on October 2 at Zulekha Hospital, Dubai where Pink balloons were released as a symbolic gesture towards the cause.\n\nDr. Amer Sharif, Acting CEO (Hospitals sector), Dubai Health Authority (DHA) attended the function as chief guest and renowned breast cancer research specialist, Dr. Pamela Munster, Professor, Department of Medicine (Haematology/Oncology), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), Director, Early Phase Clinical Trials Unit and Leader, Developmental Therapeutics Program, UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center; addressed the audience.\n\nJoyalukkas will release a mass media campaign under the ‘Think Pink’ banner. A special booklet comprising vital information will also be distributed all over UAE.\n\n“We are happy to associate with Joyalukkas in building awareness for breast cancer. While women over 40 years of age are globally the most affected, younger women now are also being diagnosed with the disease, with women as young as 19 have been diagnosed with breast cancer. We hope ‘Think Pink’ will add to the activities undertaken by various bodies to build awareness, educate and protect women” said Dr. Zulekha Daud, Managing Director, Zulekha Healthcare Group.\n\nDoctors of Zulekha Hospital will also interact and answer various queries on breast cancer on popular radio stations in UAE.\n\nJoyalukkas Group operates various businesses across Singapore, the UK, India, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait and Qatar. The businesses include jewellery retail, money exchange, fashion and textiles, luxury air charter as well as shopping malls."
