        "text": "Dubai: The autobiography of UAE-based jeweller Joy Alukkas was launched at the Sharjah International Book Fair today. Titled ‘Spreading Joy - How Joyalukkas Became the World’s Favourite Jeweller’ was officially unveiled at the Fair.\n\nAhmed bin Rakkad Al Ameri, CEO of Sharjah Book Authority, and Bollywood actress Kajol Devgan, the Global Brand Ambassador of Joyalukkas, did the honours, in the presence of Jolly Joy Alukkas, Joy’s wife, and Anantha Padmanabhan, CEO HarperCollins.\n\nAt a gala launch held in the ballroom of the Fair, Alukkas said the book reveals many anecdotes that will inspire budding entrepreneurs. During the launch, Bollywood actress Kajol asked an autograph from Joy, who signed the book for her. She also held a conversation on stage with Joy. “My questions will be small but your answers can be big,” Kajol said to Joy.\n\nAnswering a question posed by Gulf News at the press conference, Joy said: “People want to know my story. They want to know how I made it big in life - the book is an answer.”\n\nJoy said: \"Passion and hard work are key ingredients to success.\"\n\nWhen asked a question by Gulf News on what tips Kajol has for youngsters today in a world of tablets and social media, she said : \"I don't know if it's a tip but this is an inspiration. If you want to learn you have to pick up a book. If you want to be better than where you are now, pick up a book and learn. Learning is everything.\"\n\n‘Never give up’\n\nJoy added: “My life’s journey has been a testament to the enduring values of commitment, hard work, passion, and perseverance. I hope my humble attempt will inspire others to chase their dreams and never give up in the face of adversities.”\n\nThe book is now available at all leading book stores in India, UAE and Bahrain, as well as online for readers worldwide through Amazon UAE, India, Singapore, UK and USA and other popular e-commerce portals. The book is available in English at Jashanmal and in Malayalam at DC books at the Sharjah book fair.\n\n“The autobiography promises to be an inspiring read, offering invaluable insights into the life and achievements of a man who has left an indelible mark on the business world,” said John Paul, Joy’s son.\n\nWhen asked how prepared is he to fill in his father’s shoes, John Paul said : “My father’s shoes are big to fill. My learning has been watching him since a child. I have been learning from him since I was a child.”"
