        "text": "Dubai-based jewellery brand Joyalukkas has said it will open 30 stores this year in the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Oman, apart from India.\n\nJoy Alukkas, the founder of the group told Gulf News: “We need to be extremely careful with new store locations – having more than two within the same neighbourhood or a few miles of one other won’t make sense any longer.”\n\n“So, rather than a few more stores in Dubai – where we already have our highest number – we could do that in Al Ain [in the UAE], Saudi Arabia or Oman.”\n\n“We opened recently in the US and Singapore is a good place to be with our expansion this year,” he said.\n\nThe company has three stores each in Saudi Arabia and Oman. It will open 15 stores across these locations this year.\n\nMeanwhile in India, the company will launch 15 stores as well."
