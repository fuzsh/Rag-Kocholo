        "text": "Joyalukkas vouchers can be a wonderful gift for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, or other special occasions, allowing the recipient to choose their preferred jewelry piece or accessory from Joyalukkas's extensive collection. When you have a Joyalukkas voucher, you can visit any Joyalukkas store or website and choose from the vibrant collection of jewelry pieces. The voucher is then treated as a form of payment, and the value of the purchase is deducted from the total value of the voucher. In cases where the purchase exceeds the voucher's value, the recipient may need to pay the remaining balance using an additional payment method. Conversely, if the purchase amount is less than the voucher's value, the remaining balance is typically credited to the voucher for future use. Joyalukkas is known as the world's favorite jeweler, indeed with good reason. The superlative quality and purity of materials, the intricacy of the designs, the variety available, the well-trained service team, and strategic locations ensure that the brand wins the heart of all its customers since 1986. Today its operations are spread across 91 showrooms in India and presence in 13 countries across the GCC, Singapore, Malaysia, UK & USA.
