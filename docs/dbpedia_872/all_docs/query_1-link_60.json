        "text": "BY SARITHA RAI\n\nIt is the morning of Akshaya Tritiya, an auspicious day when many Hindus buy jewelry. Homemaker Maimuna Hidayath has arrived early at the four-storied 50,000-square-foot Joyalukkas outlet in downtown Bangalore. The imposing, glass-fronted building situated on the prominent Mahatma Gandhi Road resembles a posh international store rather than a traditional jewelry shop.\n\nInside, perfectly groomed, sari-clad hostesses lead customers to counters already swarming with shoppers. The air-conditioning is turned low, staff bearing salvers of fruity drinks glide by and the dazzle of rack upon rack of jewelry is blinding. \"I got here after an eight-hour drive,\" says Hidayath, posing in front of the table-mirror with a variety of jewelry before buying a necklace and bangles worth $9,000. \"On this occasion they have the widest choice on offer.\"\n\nSnaring customers like Hidayath is the goal of Joy Alukkas, 56, founder and managing director of the eponymous jewelry chain. Hidayath is a Muslim, but she, too, saw the Hindu holiday as a reason to buy gold. And she's already plotting her next jewelry shopping expedition, during her kids' next school break. \"I want customers to be tempted the year round by our range of designs and the latest in jewelry fashion,\" says Alukkas.\n\n(Click here for more stories focusing on business between Asia and the Mideast.)\n\nUsing business skills honed in the markets of the Gulf, Alukkas has built a jewelry retailer in India. By embracing the Gulf sheikhdom's retail philosophy--international-level transparency that guarantees gold purity and weight, snazzy marketing and plush store ambience--he has made big inroads in India's largely unorganized sector, where the phrase \"Dubai gold\" still retains cachet.\n\nToday Alukkas manages his Indo-Gulf jewelry business from the coastal city of Cochin in the Indian state of Kerala. Seated in his sprawling office, whose expansive windows overlook the Arabian Sea, Alukkas seems pleased. \"India's gold-buying culture is different,\" he says. \"We look at jewelry first as an investment and then as fashion.\" Despite the soaring price of gold, middle-class Indians understand that jewelry is a sound buy, he says. \"Mobile phones and motorbikes have no resale value, but jewelry is worth it.\"\n\nA weak rupee and record-high gold prices recently have cooled off India's wild-about-gold middle class. And India has just been overtaken by China as the world's leading consumer of gold. \"But jewelry will always be an integral part of the consumption basket of regular Indians,\" says Varun Lohchab, director of institutional research at Religare Capital Markets. Today India's extremely fragmented $40 billion jewelry market is dominated by small mom-and-pop jewelers and neighborhood goldsmiths. Big-box jewelry brands like Alukkas have less than 8% of the market. \"There is huge room for consolidation, and every jeweler wants to snatch market share,\" says Lohchab.\n\nBut to gain that market share Alukkas first had to leave the subcontinent and seek his fortune in the Gulf, tapping into the buying power of expatriate Indians, the dominant immigrant community in the region. When he opened his first store in Abu Dhabi in 1987, it was the first branded jewelry store in the Gulf. Over a decade migrant Indians gravitated to his slickly appointed stores in what became known as the \"Dubai style,\" which includes paying attention to such detail as staff uniforms, in-store lighting and jewelry merchandising. Business in the Gulf swelled, and success prompted Alukkas to turn his gaze homeward.\n\n\"I go wherever there are South Asians; that's where my success lies,\" he says. A new store is being planned for New York, and when it opens he will place \"New York, London, Dubai, Singapore\" beneath the chain's already hyperbolic tagline: \"The World's Favourite Jeweler.\"\n\nJoyalukkas' $1.33 billion in sales last year was split almost equally between India and overseas. Alukkas expects to grow at a 35% annual rate in the next two to three years. The chain has 85 outlets today, and nearly half of these are in India, where the chain is growing the fastest.\n\nLike many of India's family-owned retailers, the jewelry chain had humble beginnings. In 1956 Alukkas' father, Varghese Alukka, opened the first store in the family's native Thrissur town, not far from its present-day headquarters in Cochin. The price of gold then was $0.10 per gram compared with today's $540 per gram. In that tiny store, Alukkas began as a salesman at 15.\n\nBusiness thrived as families came in to shop to purchase the heavy jewelry offered as bridal dowry, a practice common in many parts of India. As the family catered to their customers' orders for \"100 sovereign chains\" or \"25 sovereign waistbands\"--sovereign is an old measure equaling 8 grams--the family upgraded to a 2,000-square-foot store in 1980.\n\nDuring those years the family observed that their customers' buying power came largely from remittances sent back by family members working in the Gulf. When a friend extolled the possibilities in the Gulf market and the Kerala emigrants' buying power, Alukkas saw opportunity. \"I was the fourth among five brothers; I was ready to take chances,\" he says. On his first trip to Dubai in 1986, Alukkas traced the passage previously made by millions of his fortune-seeking countrymen from coastal Kerala.\n\nOn that trip he realized he should establish a foothold there to cater to these economic migrants, who salted away their savings to buy gold. \"Though the buyers were mostly from Kerala, there was not a single brand from Kerala catering to that huge segment,\" recalls Alukkas. He returned to India and told his brothers that he wanted to establish the brand in the Gulf.\n\nThe move made business sense: India had tight government controls over gold, and the prices in the subcontinent were at least three times those in the Gulf. \"Buying in the Gulf and reselling at home meant huge returns,\" says Alukkas. \"I wanted to tell every Indian in the Gulf: Don't send cash home; buy gold and take it home instead.\"\n\nTo get potential customers' attention, the brand flaunted its bona fide Kerala roots and advertised on radio stations broadcasting in the native Malayalam language. At a time when jewelry advertising was rare, he plastered the Joyalukkas brand name in Malayalam at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium, in the emirate of Sharjah, during its popular cricket series. The name flashed on television screens around the world, something many Malayalis, or those from Kerala, still remember with pride.\n\nIn those early days Alukkas also realized that gaining customers' trust would be key to business success. His Abu Dhabi store distanced itself from the furtiveness that characterized the gold business at the time. There would be no hastily scribbled receipts that left customers feeling cheated. \"We did away with handwritten bills and started giving our customers printed bills detailing gold weight, making charges and wastage,\" says Alukkas. The transparency helped build customers' trust and loyalty to the brand.\n\nAlukkas opened his second store in Sharjah in 1992, despite stiff resistance from his brothers, who turned nervous after the first Gulf war. \"They wanted me to shut shop and return home, but I resisted their pressure,\" he says. Meanwhile, even as business was growing at home, the other four had disagreements. One sibling decided he wanted to go his own way, then another. The family business splintered, and by 1999 all five brothers had established independent retail chains.\n\n\"I got independence that year, and for the very first time I tasted complete freedom,\" says Alukkas.\n\nUnshackled, he pursued a faster pace in expanding the business, something he couldn't do when working with his brothers. He opened 6 outlets in the Gulf that same year, 10 outlets the next and 11 outlets in 2001. The chain's \"small margins\" mantra, which focused on big volumes added up to larger profits, made it popular with the working class. Business boomed, and by 2002 Alukkas had a total of 30 outlets.\n\nThen his older brother Jos, who had been building his own brand in India (and is, even today, Alukkas' most aggressive competitor in the family, with two dozen jewelry stores), announced that he would open a store in Abu Dhabi. So Joy Alukkas decided that was his moment to expand in India. His brothers sniggered. India was a tough market with too many challenges, they said.\n\nAlukkas ignored them. Buoyed by a supercharged economy, Indians' spending power was growing and domestic gold restrictions were easing to the point that small jewelry stores began to offer gold at the \"Dubai rate.\" He opened his first store in Kottayam in Kerala, and today Alukkas has 33 India outlets, mostly clustered in the south. Religare estimates that the four southern states account for almost half of India's total jewelry sales. A store will soon open in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the company's tenth country.\n\nThe cornerstone of his strategy throughout is offering Indian shoppers what he calls the \"Dubai experience.\" Taking inspiration from the luxury-car giveaway in the emirate's shopping promotions, Alukkas offers a honeymoon as a freebie for bulk buyers during the wedding season, signs on popular Bollywood stars as brand ambassadors and has worked with other jewelers and the World Gold Council to hard-sell holidays such as Akshaya Tritiya as a lucky ?occasion for gold-buying. He's also set up in-store carnivals during the lean season to replicate those offered in Dubai's malls, the first for an Indian jeweler.\n\n\"Retailing is very intense ... customers want to see a buzz all the time,\" says Alukkas. The company spends 3% of its total annual sales on marketing and branding, slightly more than the industry standard. \"Without marketing, mar jayega !\" he says, using the Hindi expression for \"we will die.\"\n\nNow Alukkas is ready to expand again. He plans to open large, showpiece outlets in India's biggest cities. In Chennai Alukkas built a 58,000-square-foot store that got listed in the Limca Book , India's version of the Guinness Book of World Records , as the largest jewelry store in the world. An even bigger one will soon open in Hyderabad later this year.\n\nIn parallel, Alukkas is consolidating its corporate structure. The group's growing Indian business operations are aggregated under Joyalukkas India in Cochin. To lead the India charge, Alukkas, too, has shifted base from Dubai to Cochin. Separately, his only son, John Paul Alukkas, 27, is directing overseas retailing in the Dubai-headquartered Joyalukkas Holdings.\n\nThe road has not been without speed bumps. Last year a bid to list the company on Indian stock markets to raise funds for expansion and to reduce debt was aborted after several months in the planning as the stock markets plunged. However, Alukkas says the thwarted listing doesn't adversely impact the company's financials. \"We are in no rush to take the company public,\" he added. \"Our financials are stable.\"\n\nThere have been other challenges as well, namely that the branded jewelry space is getting cluttered as rivals launch similar stores. The competition means that margins are thin and the net profit of jewelry chains, including Alukkas, is typically a tiny sliver of the total sales. Still, he believes his first-mover advantage and his well-honed marketing strategies will help him beat his rivals.\n\nVast stretches of India are still unexplored, he says. \"We will take off like a rocket.\""
