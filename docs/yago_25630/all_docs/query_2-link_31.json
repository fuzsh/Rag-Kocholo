        "text": "Was just introduced to this amazing singer, Lou Doillon, by a good friend. Trop styl√©!\n\nLou Doillon is the daughter of French writer/film director Jacques Doillon and English-French actress/singer Jane Birkin. Charlotte Gainsbourg is her sister from her mother‚Äôs side.\n\nShe began acting as a child, making film debut in Kung-Fu Master at age six. She dropped out from school when she was 15 to become a full-time actress. She started working steadily in European cinema after appearing in her father‚Äôs 1998 movie Trop (Peu) d‚ÄôAmour. During the time she spent with her father after her parents‚Äô divorce, Doillon learned about musicians ranging from Chet Baker and Billie Holiday to Siouxsie and the Banshees, Screamin‚Äô Jay Hawkins, and Nirvana.\n\nIn her teens and twenties she became a French fashion icon, and she represented Givenchy as their face and muse. By the mid-2000s, however, Doillon‚Äôs passion for singing and writing songs led her to work with American pianist Christopher Brenner, with whom she wrote ‚ÄúThe Girl is Gone‚Äù, a song that appeared on a picture disc included with a 2007 issue of Visionaire Magazine.\n\nDoillon‚Äôs musical career really began to take shape in the 2010s, when she was urged by Etienne Daho to release an album of the songs she had written. Her debut album, Places, was released in September 2012 and later earned Doillon the Les Victoires de la musique award for Best Female Artist, making her the first person to win that award for a debut release in decades.\n\nIn January 2015, she released her second album, Lay Low, which delivered more smoky, intimate songs and was nominated for Best Rock Album at Les Victoires de la musique. In 2017 she embarked on other artistic ventures and releasing a book of her ink and pencil drawings that was commemorated by an exhibit of her artwork at Paris‚Äô La Maison Moli√®re.\n\nShe returned to music with Soliloquy in February 2019, an eclectic set that incorporated rock, reggae, post-punk, and electronic sounds as well as Doillon‚Äôs usual fare.\n\nDid you check out the video? Such a breathtaking voice, hot damn!\n\nüíß You might also like CLARA LUCIANI: SO FRENCHY SO CHIC.\n\n‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ‚éØ"
