        "text": "Juliette Binoche is a French actress, artist and dancer. She has appeared in more than 40 feature films, been recipient of numerous international accolades, is a published author and has appeared on stage across the world. Coming from an artistic background, she began taking acting lessons during adolescence. After performing in several stage productions, she was propelled into the world of auteurs Jean-Luc Godard, Jacques Doillon and AndrÃ© TÃ©chinÃ©, who made her a star in France with the leading role in his 1985 drama Rendez-vous. Her sensual performance in her English-language debut The Unbearable Lightness of Being, directed by Philip Kaufman, launched her international career.\\nShe sparked the interest of Steven Spielberg, who offered her several parts including a role in Jurassic Park which she declined, choosing instead to join Krzysztof KieÅlowski on the set of Three Colors: Blue, a performance for which she won the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Actress and a CÃ©sar."
