        "text": "PARIS: French authorities Monday detained leading arthouse film directors Benoit Jacquot and Jacques Doillon for questioning over accusations of sexual abuse, as a renewed #MeToo reckoning rocks France’s film industry.\n\nTheir interrogation over the alleged abuse, some dating back to the 1980s and all of which they deny, comes as activists say cinema has too long provided cover for abuse.\n\nAn AFP journalist saw Jacquot, 77, and Doillon, 80, arrive at a Paris police station on Monday morning accompanied by their lawyers.\n\nJudith Godreche, a 52-year-old actor and director, earlier this year formally accused Jacquot of rape and Doillon of sexual assault when she was a minor, accusations both men deny.\n\nShe has described Jacquot as having had an unhealthy “hold” over her during a relationship with him that started when she was 14, from 1986 to 1992.\n\nAnd she has accused Doillon of groping her during an unplanned sex scene in one of his films when she was 15.\n\nSeveral other actors have also filed complaints against both men.\n\nIsild Le Besco, 41, has accused Jacquot of raping her between 1998 and 2007 during a toxic relationship that started when she was 16 and he was 52.\n\nJulia Roy, a 34-year-old actor who has appeared in several of his films, has accused him of sexual assault in “a context of violence and moral constraint which lasted several years,” a source close to the case said.\n\nLe Besco has also charged Doillon made advances during work sessions, while actor Anna Mouglalis alleged the filmmaker forcefully kissed her in 2011.\n\nThe directors’ lawyers said there had been no need to detain them in order to question them, and stressed they should be considered innocent until proven guilty.\n\nJacquot’s lawyer, Julia Minkowski, said her client would “finally be able to express himself before the law,” slamming what she called the “unacceptable excesses” of media coverage on the issue.\n\nDoillon’s attorney, Marie Dose, said no legal criteria could justify his being detained for questioning “36 years” after the incident alleged by Godreche, adding he could have answered queries without being held in custody.\n\nSources close to the case said their interrogation could include a confrontation with those accusing them.\n\nGodreche on Instagram said she was deeply moved.\n\n“I’m crying,” she wrote.\n\n“I don’t know if I have the strength, but I will have it. I will have it... For her,” she wrote, posting a picture of her teenage self next to Jacquot, 25 years her senior.\n\nHer lawyer, Laure Heinich, did not wish to comment.\n\nSince breaking her silence, Godreche has become a leading voice in France’s #MeToo movement.\n\nAfter she appealed for a cinema oversight body, parliament in May voted to create a commission to investigate sexual and gender-based violence in the film industry and other cultural sectors.\n\nThe head of France’s top cinema institution, Dominique Boutonnat, stepped down on Friday after he was convicted of sexually assaulting his godson in 2020.\n\nAnd cinema legend Gerard Depardieu, 75, is to stand trial in October for sexually assaulting two women.\n\nHe also risks a second trial after he was charged in 2020 with rape after actor Charlotte Arnould alleged he raped her in 2018 when she was 22 and anorexic.\n\nHe denies all claims.\n\nGENEVA: The United Nations said Friday it fears a repeat of the 2017 atrocities committed against the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, warning a human tragedy was unfolding in Rakhine State.\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk voiced grave alarm about the sharply deteriorating situation across Myanmar, particularly in Rakhine where, he said, hundreds of civilians have reportedly been killed while trying to flee fighting.\n\nClashes have rocked Rakhine since the rebel Arakan Army attacked forces of Myanmar’s ruling junta in November, ending a ceasefire that had largely held since a military coup in 2021.\n\nTurk blamed both sides for abuses against the Rohingya including extrajudicial killings, abductions and indiscriminate bombardments of towns.\n\nThe AA says it is fighting for more autonomy for the ethnic Rakhine population in the state, which is also home to around 600,000 members of the Rohingya Muslim minority.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Rohingya fled Rakhine in 2017 during a crackdown by the military that is now the subject of a United Nations genocide court case.\n\n“Thousands of Rohingya have been forced to flee on foot, with the Arakan Army herding them repeatedly into locations that offer scant safe haven,” Turk said in a statement.\n\n“As the border crossings to Bangladesh remain closed, members of the Rohingya community are finding themselves trapped between the military and its allies and the Arakan Army, with no path to safety.”\n\nBangladesh is now home to around one million Rohingya refugees.\n\nOpinion\n\nThis section contains relevant reference points, placed in (Opinion field)\n\n“This month marks seven years since the military operations which drove 700,000 across the border into Bangladesh. Despite the world saying ‘never again’, we are once more witnessing killings, destruction and displacement in Rakhine,” said Turk.\n\nIn a statement released by his office, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on all parties in the conflict “to end the violence and ensure the protection of civilians.”\n\nHe also urged the strengthening of “regional protection efforts, to provide access to conflict-affected communities and further support host countries,” especially in Bangladesh.\n\nTurk said parties to the armed conflict were denying responsibility for attacks against the Rohingya, which “stretches the bounds of credulity.”\n\nThe UN Human Rights Office said that according to its information, the military and the Arakan Army have both committed serious human rights violations and abuses against the Rohingya.\n\nThese include extrajudicial killings, some involving beheadings; abductions, forced recruitment, indiscriminate bombardments of towns and villages, and arson attacks.\n\n“Both the military and the Arakan Army bear direct responsibility for the human tragedy that is unfolding in Rakhine,” said Turk.\n\n“These atrocities demand an unequivocal response: those responsible must be held accountable, and justice must be pursued relentlessly.\n\n“Recurrence of the crimes and horrors of the past must be prevented as a moral duty and a legal necessity.”\n\nTurk called on both parties to cease attacks on civilians and urged the ASEAN regional bloc to take all necessary measures to protect the Rohingya.\n\nGuterres voiced hope “for sustainable peace and national reconciliation that are important steps to create conditions conducive to the voluntary, safe, dignified, and sustainable return of the Rohingya people to Myanmar.”\n\nWASHINGTON: US President Joe Biden spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and announced a new round of military aid for Kyiv, the White House said.\n\nThe call between the two leaders came ahead of Ukraine’s independence day, and on the same day that Washington announced sweeping sanctions against hundreds of individuals and companies tied to Russia’s invasion of the country.\n\n“I am proud we will announce a new package of military aid for Ukraine today,” Biden said in a statement, without specifying the dollar value of the assistance.\n\n“The package includes air defense missiles to protect Ukraine’s critical infrastructure; counter-drone equipment and anti-armor missiles to defend against Russia’s evolving tactics on the battlefield; and ammunition for frontline soldiers and the mobile rocket systems that protect them,” he said.\n\n“Russia will not prevail in this conflict. The independent people of Ukraine will prevail — and the United States, our allies, and our partners, will continue to stand with them every step of the way,” Biden added.\n\nThe US has been a key military backer of Ukraine, committing more than $55 billion in weapons, ammunition and other security aid since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nThe latest aid announcement comes as Ukrainian troops press an attack into Russia’s western Kursk region — an offensive that is the most serious attack by a foreign army on Russian territory since World War II.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the US Treasury, State and Commerce departments announced new sanctions that build on a raft of existing measures enacted against Russia over the invasion.\n\nThe sanctions target nearly 400 individuals and entities both inside and outside of Russia “whose products and services enable Russia to sustain its war effort and evade sanctions,” the US Treasury Department announced in a statement.\n\nAmong those sanctioned were 60 Russia-based defense and technology firms “critical for the sustainment and development of Russia’s defense industry,” it added.\n\nThe State Department said in a separate statement that it was responsible for 190 of the sanctions, and that Treasury was responsible for close to 200 others.\n\nIt added that its designations “aim to disrupt sanctions evasion and target entities in multiple third countries,” including China, along with businesses supporting the development of Russian energy projects.\n\nAlongside the sanctions unveiled Friday, the Commerce Department announced it was taking “aggressive action” to further restrict the supply of items made in the United States, or labeled as such, to both Russia and Belarus, due to “the Kremlin’s illegal war on Ukraine.”\n\n“Today’s actions will further constrain Russia’s ability to arm its military by targeting illicit procurement networks designed to circumvent global export controls,” the department said in a statement.\n\nPHOENIX, Arizona: Robert F. Kennedy said Friday he’s suspending his independent presidential bid and will seek to remove his name from the ballot in battleground states because he believes his presence in the race would help Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nHe said his supporters can continue to back him in the majority of states where they are unlikely to sway the outcome. Kennedy took steps to withdraw his candidacy in at least two states late this week, Arizona and Pennsylvania.\n\nKennedy said the move followed conversations with Donald Trump over the past few weeks.\n\nBefore the speech, his campaign had said in a Pennsylvania court filing Friday that he would be endorsing Trump for president. However, a spokesperson for Kennedy said the court filing had been made in error.\n\n“Mr. Kennedy has not endorsed President Trump,” said spokesperson Stefanie Spear. “The filing was made by an attorney and not reviewed by the campaign.” She said the filing would be updated.\n\nKennedy’s independent campaign also requested that he be removed from the Pennsylvania ballot, though it was not immediately clear that he was officially dropping out of the race.\n\nKennedy had a speech planned in Arizona on Friday to discuss “the present historical moment and his path forward,” according to his campaign. Hours later, Trump will hold a rally in neighboring Glendale. Trump’s campaign has teased that he will be joined by “a special guest,” though neither campaign responded to messages about whether Kennedy would be that guest.\n\nA late-stage endorsement in the presidential race could give the former president a modest boost from Kennedy’s supporters.\n\nA year ago, some would have thought it inconceivable that a member of arguably the most storied family in Democratic politics would work with Trump to keep a Democrat — Vice President Kamala Harris — out of the White House. Even in recent months, Kennedy has accused Trump of betraying his followers, while Trump has criticized Kennedy as “the most radical left candidate in the race.”\n\nThe Pennsylvania filing came Friday in a case in which Kennedy was defending his paperwork to get on the ballot in the battleground state against a challenge by two Democratic activists.\n\nThe filing said that, “as a result of today’s endorsement of Donald Trump” he was requesting the dismissal of his campaign’s nomination papers so that he would not appear on Pennsylvania’s ballot.\n\nKennedy already has secured ballot access in several states, including battlegrounds like Michigan and Nevada. Some secretaries of state said it’s too late for him to remove himself even if he wants to do so.\n\nCheri Hardmon, a spokesperson for Michigan’s Department of State, said its law requires presidential electors be selected at the fall state convention, and that already happened, which means his name will remain on the state’s ballot.\n\nAnd in Wisconsin, where Kennedy has filed for ballot access and is awaiting approval, there is “no mechanism for him to ‘take back’ the filing,” according to Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson Joel DeSpain.\n\nThe Kennedy and Trump campaigns have ramped up their compliments to each other and engaged in behind-the-scenes discussions in recent weeks, according to those familiar with the efforts. Both campaigns have spent months accusing Democrats of weaponizing the legal system for their own benefit. And both have hinted publicly that they could be open to joining forces, with the shared goal of limiting Harris’ chances.\n\nLast month, during the Republican National Convention, Kennedy’s son posted and then quickly deleted a video showing a phone call between Kennedy and Trump, in which the former president appeared to try to talk Kennedy into siding with him.\n\nTalks between the two camps continued, with close Trump allies quietly lobbying Kennedy to drop out of the race and support the Republican nominee, according to a person familiar with the efforts who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\n\nTrump told CNN on Tuesday that he would “love” an endorsement from Kennedy, whom he called a “brilliant guy.” He also said he would “certainly” be open to Kennedy playing a role in his administration if Kennedy drops out and endorses him.\n\nKennedy’s running mate, Nicole Shanahan, also openly suggested on a podcast this week that his campaign might “walk away right now and join forces with Donald Trump.” While she clarified that she is not personally in talks with Trump, she entertained the idea that Kennedy could join Trump’s administration as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\n“I think that Bobby in a role like that would be excellent,” Shanahan said. “I fully support it. I have high hopes.”\n\nEarlier Friday, Shanahan posted on X that she isn’t a Kamala Democrat or a Trump Republican.\n\n“I’m an INDEPENDENT American who is endorsing ideas, not a person or a party,” she wrote. “I will continue working to give a voice to the voiceless and bring power back to the people.”\n\nAt Kennedy’s Phoenix event, 38-year-old Casey Westerman, a Chandler, Arizona, resident who works in software sales, said she trusted Kennedy’s judgment and had planned to vote for him, but would support Trump if Kennedy said that was who he was endorsing.\n\n“My decision would really be based on who he thinks is best suited to run this country,” said Westerman, who wore a “Kennedy 2024” trucker hat and voted for Trump in the last two presidential elections.\n\nThe scheduled remarks by Kennedy, a son of former Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and a nephew of former President John F. Kennedy, come as his campaign’s momentum has slipped.\n\nKennedy Jr. first entered the 2024 presidential race as a Democrat but left the party last fall to run as an independent. He built an unusually strong base for a third-party bid, fueled in part by anti-establishment voters and vaccine skeptics who have followed his anti-vaccine work since the COVID-19 pandemic. But he has since faced strained campaign finances and mounting legal challenges, including a recent ruling from a New York judge that he should not appear on the ballot in the state because he listed a “sham” address on nominating petitions.\n\nMany members of Kennedy’s extended family have been vocal that they don’t see eye to eye politically with Kennedy Jr., and some came out publicly to endorse Biden before he dropped out of the race.\n\nRecent polls put his support in the mid-single digits. And it’s unclear if he’d get even that in a general election, since third-party candidates frequently don’t live up to their early poll numbers when voters actually cast their ballots.\n\nThere’s some evidence that Kennedy’s staying in the race would hurt Trump more than Harris. According to a July AP-NORC poll, Republicans were significantly more likely than Democrats to have a favorable view of Kennedy. And those with a positive impression of Kennedy were significantly more likely to also have a favorable view of Trump (52 percent) than Harris (37 percent).\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Thursday, Harris communications director Michael Tyler said her campaign welcomes Kennedy voters should the independent candidate drop out.\n\nFor voters who see Trump as a threat, who are looking for a new way forward, or who want “government to get the hell out of the way of their own personal decisions, there’s a home for you in Kamala Harris’ campaign,” Tyler said.\n\nFor Trump, Friday will mark the end of a week’s worth of battleground state visits in which he has sought to draw attention away from Democrats’ celebration of Harris’ presidential nomination in Chicago.\n\nHe traveled to Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Arizona’s US-Mexico border for events focused on his policy proposals on the economy, crime and safety, national security and the border. He will close out the week Friday with stops in Las Vegas and Glendale."
