        "text": "Claim Me, the latest album by French artist Lou Doillon, is a work of art. It is both a record, for which she wrote the music and lyrics, and a film, which she directed and on which she drew. A terribly addictive art object. “If you don’t like Claim Me, then you don’t like my work,” she says. She has put herself entirely into it, body and voice included.\n\nHer voice. Let’s talk about it. It’s a miracle. Given her physiology, and the configuration of her vocal cords with nodules, Lou Doillon could never have spoken. So sing! Yes, it’s a miracle where willpower plays a role, too.\n\nThe daughter of Jane Birkin and director Jacques Doillon fell into an artistic cauldron at birth and since everything was there, she decided to tickle many muses: the one dedicated to the cinema, with her father, and the muse of drawing too. Lou Doillon spent a few years modelling. Nothing that really satisfied her. She mainly composed songs, hundreds of songs, but it was her secret garden.\n\nAt the age of 19, Lou Doillon gave birth to the son she had with musician John Ulysses Mitchell. Music had always been her passion, but it was the domain of her mother and her half-sister Charlotte Gainsbourg, both of whom had a high-pitched, delicate voice. It was thanks to the intervention of Etienne Daho, invited by Jane Birkin to hear her sing, that she was able to create her first album Places. Daho immediately understood the power of her talent. Lou Doillon entered this world with her deep, slightly cracked, beautiful voice, which she says she cannot control. No one was expecting her. And suddenly she won a Victoire de la Musique in 2012.\n\nHer first album was produced by Etienne Daho and mixed by Philippe Zdar, my brother. He had given up recording Cat Power’s album so that he could mix Lou Doillon’s in ten days. He spoke of her as a revelation. He wanted so much for us to meet. “You’ll love her,” he said. He joined the stars in 2019, but the meeting took place anyway, by phone. And he was right, I loved her.\n\nIt’s funny, I was thinking about that this morning. I was looking at a beautiful photo of my sister Kate (Barry) who, apart from taking portraits, photographed cracks and bits of pavements. I found these images this morning and I immediately thought of this song: “There is a crack, a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in”. That’s what I really like about the voice. When I was younger, I started acting with my father. But once the takes were done, he didn’t watch them : he listened to them. I asked him why and he said: “Because the image cheats but the voice cannot cheat. “That made an impression on me. With the voice, you can’t cheat. I realised this when I was singing on stage: when the emotion rises too high, when the tears are close, you can no longer sing because your throat closes up. The voice is like carbon paper. It collects all the emotions. Physically, I can hide my sorrows, my pains, my anxieties, but not with my voice. It took me a long time to accept that. I was surrounded by women who sang with a soft high-pitched voice, and I thought that in order to be a good singer you needed a high-pitched voice. My big, deep voice comes from the ground. And I’m glad it’s permeable to everything that’s happened to me. I work with a strange instrument.\n\nI have a vocal cord defect. My doctor once told me that it was a miracle that I could speak: normally, I shouldn’t be able to make a sound. Talking, singing, means managing the yawn between these two cords and the way they touch. But mine don’t touch at all, but each one has a nodule, located in exactly the same place. This has a very pretty name: kissing nodules. Every sound I make is like a kiss. I don’t really know what’s going to come out when I sing. I can hardly hold the notes because I lose most of my breath. It’s like my voice is someone else and she does what she wants. I just try to follow her. I have no other option anyway.\n\nKate was a wonderful person. If I think of her as the sister I lost, I fall on my knees, in despair. But if I remember that she was also a mother, a lover, a good friend, someone people could meet in a coffee, then I realise that I am part of a chain of humanity, which is a chain of pain, but a chain of life too. There is something so magical about having known magical people! How lucky we were! And how lucky the others were to have met them! You have to keep going with that. On the day of the funeral, I had the impression of being in the backstage of life. We were driving through Paris, following the hearse while people were laughing, kissing and loving each other. The only answer to the fall is to fly away. Fly in peace…"
