Russia Wharf is a completed high-rise building in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The building rises 395 feet (120 m) and contains 32 floors. Construction began in 2006 and was finished in early 2011; as such, the structure is one of the most recently completed high-rises in the city. Russia Wharf now stands as the 31st-tallest building in the city. The architectural firm that designed the building is Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc., of Boston, Massachusetts. The civil engineer, also responsible for managing permitting (including Chapter 91 Licensing) was Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. of Watertown, Massachusetts. The mixed use project includes approximately 709,000 square feet (65,900 m2) of class-A commercial office space and 65 residential units. The site consists of approximately 2.2 acres (8,900 m2). From about 1897 to 2007, the site contained three low-rise mercantile buildings called the Russia, Graphic Arts, and Tufts Buildings.
