I buy a ship and it says its good to go and will make it in a given time. I says there are no ships in the queue so there is no wait. Sadly when i accept it the ship sits in the queue and never builds. For example right now i have enough parts to build 14 fighters. I told it to just build 1. let it si with seta on for about a hr and it never built the ship.",
