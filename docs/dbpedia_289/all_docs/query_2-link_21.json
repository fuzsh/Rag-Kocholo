These monumental buildings, characterized by cast-iron storefronts, large shop front windows and decorative lanterns, eventually fell into a state of near-unsalvageable disrepair.   The new Atlantic Wharf has incorporated the façades and other important architectural elements of these historic buildings into a modern, thirty-one-story skyscraper, which contains offices, residential units, and retail space. With substantial setbacks, the new tower allows quality breathing room for the historic structures to read well from the street, featuring original storefronts, complete with limestone and cast iron. The historic exterior has been completely refurbished, including the repair of crumbling brick and rebuilding neglected lanterns. Nelson Court, a passageway connecting the Russia and Graphic Arts Buildings, is now a glass atrium that serves as an entryway into the skyscraper, bringing a bold vibrant new energy to the historic structures.   Owner/Developer: Boston Properties Project Team:  CBT Architects Cavanaugh Tocci Gordon Smith Corporation Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc.
