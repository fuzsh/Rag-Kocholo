        "text": "Height395 feetFloors33Year2008\n\nAbout Russia Wharf\n\nRussia Wharf is a high-rise building under construction in downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The building will stand at 395 feet (120 m) with 33 floors. Construction began in 2007, and the building is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2010. Upon completion, it will stand as the 31st tallest building in the city. The architectural firm that designed the building is Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc., of Boston, Massachusetts. The civil engineering firm is Vanasse Hangen Brustlin, Inc. of Watertown, Massachusetts. When completed, this mixed use project will include approximately 709,000 square feet (65,900 m) of class-A commercial office space, and 65 residential units. The site consists of approximately 2.2 acres. From about 1897 to 2007, the site contained three low-rise mercantile buildings called the Russia, Graphic Arts and Tufts Buildings. The office tower is being constructed on the site of the Graphic Arts and Tufts Buildings. As of 2009, Boston Properties has begun to refer to the building as Atlantic Wharf. The project was controversial because of the historic nature of the buildings and their prominent position on the edge of Fort Point Channel.\n\nRead More at Wikipedia\n\nSee Also"
