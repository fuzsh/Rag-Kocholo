        "text": "Brendan M. C.\n\nGood bar one part\n\nStayed for a wedding. Staff very friendly, hotel settings are great. Only issue was half an hour before check out a cleaner knocked out door and inisted they needed to clean the room. I tried to explain that check out wasnâ€™t for another half hour and we werenâ€™t ready to leave but she didnâ€™t seem to understand and was not taking no for an answer. Disappointing end to our stay\n\nLinda\n\nSmashing experience\n\nTruly blown away by this hotel. Two evening meals within the hotel were superb and the breakfast experience was a winner too. It was lovely having a room which opened out onto a terrace with furniture in place to be used. The only thing I was a bit disappointed in was the size of the pool. The area was set out well but didnâ€™t really cater to a large group of people being in at the same time. Children running and jumping in the pool had me a bit on edge too as the area was not supervised too well. I know the hotel is really catered towards golf which to be honest was nice to watch from a distance as the walk around the estate was enjoyable and the views tremendous.\n\nUnknown\n\nAt check in we were asked where & when we would like to have dinner. We agreed on 7 pm at Kathleenâ€™s Kichen. Around 3 hrs later recâ€™d a phone call advising that 8:30 at The Carriage House was the only option. Very disappointing. We ended up ordering my sonâ€™s bâ€™day dinner from a take away that delivered. On our first night, turn down only happened in one of two rooms. The Le Labo shower gel in one room was a drugstore hand soap. I called about this and nothing happened until I spoke directly with our housekeeper.\n\nLisa\n\nOkay\n\nCheck in was a bit chaotic..we were sent away twice as the room was not ready on our 3rd return they upgraded our room for the inconvenience but to a room without a balcony, I specifically booked a balcony room. We were then put back in our original balcony room. The room itself was lovely but the balcony was filthy. A down pipe was leaking and covered in green slime with a bad smell of stale water. The balcony furniture was green and dirty. There were cigarette butt's everywhere and rubbish lying about. I spoke with reception and asked if the balcony could be tidied so we could use it. Instead we got sent a free bottle of wine (we don't drink) with a note apologising for the balcony, but still noone came to clean it. This trip cost a LOT of money. It was a surprise stay for my husbands birthday and our 1 year wedding f anniversary..unfortunately our experience was not great and very expensive ðŸ˜¢"
