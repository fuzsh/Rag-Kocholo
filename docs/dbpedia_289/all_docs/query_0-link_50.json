        "text": "Introduction\n\nAutomated traffic enforcement is achieved through speed safety cameras and red light cameras. While implementation strategies for these cameras vary widely, automated enforcement is proven to reduce fatal and serious injury crashes. Considerations for automated enforcement include geographical area restrictions, level of automation, degree of visibility, use of revenue, penalties, and equity concerns, among others.\n\nManaging vehicle speed is a critical component of Vision Zero's Safe System approach. Speeding kills close to 10,000 people each year in the U.S. – on par with drunk driving – yet the act of speeding does not carry the same social consequences as drunk driving. One method of prioritizing safe streets is to slow vehicles through the use of automated enforcement or safety cameras. Speed safety cameras have been named a “Proven Safety Countermeasure” by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This form of automated enforcement is an effective, reliable technology to supplement traditional methods of enforcement, engineering measures, and education to alter the social norms of speeding.\n\nKentucky Timeline\n\nCurrently under state law, the use of automated enforcement is prohibited in Kentucky. However, a coalition of legislators, transportation safety advocates, and transportation officials in Kentucky are working to change that, aiming to join over 20 other states that utilize red light cameras, speed safety cameras, or both.\n\n2019: Rep. Reginald Meeks (D-42, resigned 2021) introduced House Bill 507 during the Kentucky General Assembly 2019 Regular Session. The bill, which would have enabled the use of speed safety cameras, did not pass.\n\n2021: Rep. John Blanton (R-92) introduced House Bill 496 to legalize speed safety cameras in highway work zones. The bill did not pass out of committee.\n\n2022: Sen. Reginald Thomas (D-13) introduced Senate Bill 19 during the Kentucky General Assembly 2022 Regular Session. The bill, which would have enabled the use of red light cameras and established a $50 fine, did not pass out of committee.\n\n2022: Rep. John Blanton (R-92) introduced House Bill 542 during the Kentucky General Assembly 2022 Regular Session. The bill, which would have enabled the use of speed safety cameras in work zones, did not pass. The bill was named in honor of Jared Lee Helton, a native of Salyersville, Ky. who was killed in 2019 while working on I-40 in Tennessee.\n\n2022: Louisville Metro Council passed a resolution supporting state legislation that enables the use of automated enforcement.\n\n2022: Transportation safety advocates and elected officials came together for Louisville's first annual World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, held on November 20 at Iroquois Park. The event served to honor those killed on Louisville's roadways and call for state legislation that enables the use of automated enforcement.\n\n2022: A Mobility Meet Up, hosted by Streets for People, the Taylor/New Cut Network, Southwest Dream Team, and Friends of Bardstown Road, kicked off a community drive for legalization of automated enforcement.\n\n2023: Rep. Rachel Roarx (D-38) introduced House Bill 73 to enable the use of speed safety cameras and red light cameras. The bill did not pass out of committee.\n\n2023: Sen. Reginald Thomas (D-13) introduced Senate Bill 21 to enable the use of red light cameras. The bill did not pass out of committee. Sen. Thomas filed a similar bill in 2022.\n\n2023: Louisville Metro Government's Center for Health Equity published Improving Public Safety Through Automated Enforcement, a policy brief on the topic. The brief identifies lessons learned from other cities and ways to reduce inequities when implementing an automated enforcement program.\n\nRead the Improving Public Safety Through Automated Enforcement policy brief.\n\n2023: Rep. John Blanton (R-92) introduced House Bill 201 to legalize speed safety cameras in highway work zones. The bill was named in honor of Jared Lee Helton, a native of Salyersville, Ky. who was killed in 2019 while working on I-40 in Tennessee. The bill, which garnered five cosponsors, did not come up for a vote on the House floor.\n\n2024: Sen. Reginald Thomas (D-13) introduced Senate Bill 112 to enable the use of red light cameras. The bill did not pass out of committee. Sen. Thomas filed similar bills in 2022 and 2023.\n\n2024: Sen. David Yates (D-37) introduced Senate Bill 44 to legalize speed safety cameras in highway work zones. The bill did not pass out of committee.\n\n2024: Rep. John Blanton (R-92) introduced House Bill 192 to legalize speed safety cameras in highway work zones. The bill was named in honor of Jared Lee Helton, a native of Salyersville, Ky. who was killed in 2019 while working on I-40 in Tennessee. The bill, which garnered five cosponsors, did not come up for a vote on the House floor. Similar bills have been filed each year since 2021.\n\nWhat are other cities doing?\n\nOver 150 communities across the United States have implemented speed safety camera enforcement. Many of these cities have experienced reductions in excessive speeding and a decrease in fatal and serious injury collisions. Examples of these successful programs include:\n\n• Washington, D.C. experienced a 73% reduction in traffic fatalities (a decrease from 71 deaths in 2001 to 19 deaths in 2012) and a 34% decrease in traffic-related injuries. The percentage of motorists traveling greater than 10 MPH over the speed limit dropped from one in three to one in forty as a result of automated enforcement.\n\n• Portland, OR reported a 46% reduction in traffic fatalities from an average of 56.8 annual traffic deaths before the program's implementation to an average of 30.5 traffic-related deaths as the program has grown. Average and 85th percentile speeds also declined at speed safety camera locations. There was an 85% decrease in the number of drivers exceeding the speed limit by 10 MPH or more.\n\n• Seattle, WA had an overall calming effect on the city reporting a 4% reduction in the average speed of a speeding violation in miles per hour above the posted speed limit\n\n• In New York City, NY in zones where cameras were installed, total crashes declined by 15%, total injuries by 17%, fatalities by 55%, and speeding by 70%. Daily violations at typical camera locations declined over time as drivers started to be mindful of the cameras and drive more responsibly. NYC DOT also found that between 2014-2016, 81% of drivers did not receive more than one violation, further evidence that the cameras created an overall behavioral change.\n\n• Denver, CO curbed excessive speeding by 21% at speed safety camera locations.\n\n• Montgomery, MD experienced a 59% decrease in the likelihood of a driver exceeding the speed limit by more than 10 mph and reported a reduction in fatal or incapacitating injuries by 49% on roads with speed safety cameras.\n\nAgenciesthat support automated traffic enforcement\n\nAAA Foundation for Traffic Safety\n\nAdvocates for Highway and Auto Safety\n\nCDC: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nFHWA: U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration\n\nGHSA: Governors Highway Safety Association\n\nIACP: International Association of Chiefs of Police\n\nIIHS: Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\n\nNACTO: National Association of City Transportation Officials\n\nNHTSA: U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\n\nNational Sheriffs’ Association\n\nNSC: National Safety Council\n\nNTSB: National Transportation Safety Board\n\nTRB: Transportation Research Board of the National Academies\n\nVera Institute of Justice\n\nVision Zero Network\n\nResources\n\nFederal Highway Administration (FHWA): \"Speed Safety Cameras\" [CFM]\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): \"Automated Speed Camera Enforcement\" [HTML]\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL): \"Automated Enforcement Overview\" [HTML]\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL): Traffic Safety Review: State Speed and Red-Light Camera Laws and Programs [HTML]\n\nSan Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency: \"Speed Safety Cameras\" [HTML]\n\nGovernors Highway Safety Association (GHSA): \"Automated Enforcement in a New Era\" [PDF] (2023)\n\nLouisville Metro Government, Public Health & Wellness, Center for Health Equity: \"Improving Public Safety Through Automated Enforcement\" [PDF] (2023)\n\nFederal Highway Administration (FHWA): \"Speed Safety Camera Program Planning and Operations Guide\" [PDF] (2023)\n\nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS): \"Automated Enforcement Program Checklist\" [PDF] (2021)\n\nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP): \"Traffic Safety Resource Guide\" [PDF] (2020)\n\nLivable Streets: \"Traffic Enforcement + Automated Enforcement\" [PDF] (2019)\n\nVision Zero Network: \"Taming Speed for Safety: A Defining Approach and Leadership from Portland, Oregon\" [PDF] (2018)\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB): \"Reducing Speeding-Related Crashes Involving Passenger Vehicles\" [PDF] (2017)\n\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): \"System Analysis of Automated Speed Enforcement Implementation\" [PDF] (2016)\n\nTransportation Research Board, National Cooperative Highway Research Program: NCHRP Report 729: \"Automated Enforcement for Speeding and Red Light Running\" [PDF] (2012)\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation: \"Speed Management Program Plan\" [PDF] (Undated)\n\nLast updated: April 17, 2024"
