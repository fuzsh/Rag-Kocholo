        "text": "Tom\n\nThe spa and rooms are in need of a refresh/renovation\n\nI liked it, but the hotel requires an upgrade, especially the spa/pool areas. The carpet in the rooms needs a bit of a refresh, and generally, the rooms are a bit stuffy. The hotel menu needs healthier options; after a few days of meat, fish, and chips, it becomes quite apparent. Overall, it is not a decent value-for-money option, but it could be much better.\n\nStuart C.\n\nExcellent Hotel\n\nMy first hotel stay in Scotland near the famed St Andrew’s golf course and this place was fantastic. Beautiful room, spectacular location, superb atmosphere, and excellent service. I would like to thank Andrew at the front desk for being so helpful and kind. Our room was spacious and my wife was very happy.\n\nUnknown\n\n5 night stay. Hotel clean and nice rooms, but service was very poor at bars and restaurants. We had 8 rooms booked. 4 of us also had charges on our bills that were not correct. We had to request these charges be removed.\n\nAnon\n\nGood stay\n\nMy best friend and I had a lovely birthday stay with you. There were a couple of things that were just not quite right. Firstly I must say that your accessible room was fantastic and allowed me to be independent. The first issue was breakfast on morning one. The hot food was cold. My friend was terribly disappointed as it was her first experience of a 5* hotel. Secondly, the spa. We did have lovely treatments and the therapists were great but the pool area was more like the public swimming pool due to several noisy children thus not relaxing at all. On a positive note, your staff were fantastic.\n\nMaryann\n\nFantastic Stay!!\n\nBeautiful Fairmont hotel, filled with attentive staff, on 2 stunning courses! The Kittocks have some of the most spectacular views in St. Andrews and it is a fair but challenging course to play. Truly enjoyed our stay and will be back again!!\n\nMike T.\n\nNice rooms, poor bar/food service.\n\nGreetings at arrival were very good. From the bellmen to the front desk staff, all were professional, friendly, and efficient. Our group went to the bar that evening for a drink and some food. The drinks took over 30 minutes and the food was over an hour. The sports bar didn’T. have a bartender even working in there. This was a poor showing for a solid brand and the potential for excellence is obvious. Based on this experience, I would not stay there again."
