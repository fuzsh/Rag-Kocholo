        "text": "In 1553, three British ships set out on an expedition to find the northeastern passage to China. Two of them were forced off course in a storm just outside Lofoten, north of the Arctic Circle. The crew tried to survive the long, hard winter on the deserted Murmansk coast, but none did.\n\nThe third ship, âEdvard Bonaventureâ, ended up near the Arkhangelsk coast in Russia. The captain, Richard Chancellor, made it to Moscow in a sled, and from there, he made it safely home to England.\n\nCaptain Chancellor didnât find the sea route to China, but before ending up in Russia, he did discover something else: A cliff âat the edge of the worldâ, rising 307 meters straight up from the Arctic Ocean. He named it âNorth Capeâ.\n\nThe wooden installations that come into view on our left as the tour bus leaves the harbour in HonningsvÃ¥g are somewhat a remarkable sight. To me, they resemble bare, wooden cabins with neither roofs nor walls, completely exposed to the elements. But they are not cabins; they are drying racks for fish, and from January through March they are filled with cod. After eight to ten weeks, the fish is completely dry and ready to get exported throughout the world. Just like clipfish (salt cod), dryfish is considered a special Norwegian delicacy.\n\nThe young female guide at the front of our bus explains to us how it all works. Her English is impeccable, but Italian is her native language. Sheâs switching effortlessly between the two languages, not seeming the least stressed by the time pressure sheâs under to share a large amount of information on our journey from HonningsvÃ¥g to the North Cape Plateau.\n\nWith close to 2400 inhabitants, HonningsvÃ¥g is in fact too small to call itself a city. In Norway, a town can only do so if the municipality it is located in has at least 5.000 inhabitants. North Cape holds less than 3.000 people. Nevertheless, it does have the status as a real city, only because the municipal council decided so in 1996. Not only did HonningsvÃ¥g become a city; it became the northernmost city of Norway â and the fourth northernmost city in the world.\n\nJust before our bus driver is leaving Nordkappveien (the North Cape Road) to E69 (European road 69), the guide directs our attention to a grocery store on our left. It is nothing out of the ordinary; in fact, there are at least two other similar stores in town. Still, this particular shop is singled out as interesting. Why? Because itâs located at exactly 71 degrees North! (\"71 Degrees North\" is the name of a popular, long-time reality series throughout Europe).\n\nThere are few trees around, and the ones we can see are small. Some hardy flowers are clinging to the rock wall on both sides of the road. Supposedly, more than 20 different species of plants are growing in the area, and during the season we can even find lots of blueberries, raspberries, and mullets.\n\nSuddenly, the bus slows down, and the guide interrupts herself in the middle of a sentence:\n\nâLook, reindeer on the left!â, she exclaims.\n\nThe Nordic animal is grazing next to the road, just a few meters from the bus. Several of the passengers shout out in excitement â wow, we saw a real reindeer! Little do they know that very soon we will spot many more magnificent specimens of the spectacular animal out on the mountain plains. Nowadays, there are reindeer everywhere on this island â over 6000, to be more precise. They belong to the SÃ¡mi people and were transported here by boat in the month of April.\n\nâThe SÃ¡mi people keep their reindeer on MagerÃ¸ya during the summer seasonâ, says the guide.\n\nThe SÃ¡mi are the native population â the indigenous people â in the northernmost part of Scandinavia.\n\nâIn September, the SÃ¡mi will travel all over the island to find and collect the reindeer once more. Typically, they use ATVs (all-terrain vehicles), or â if thereâs snow â snowmobiles while herdingâ, the guide explains.\n\nIn October, the SÃ¡mi bring their reindeer back to the mainland.\n\nThe name âSkipsfjordenâ comes from the fact that it used to be an emergency port, especially during storms: The fishing boats came here to find shelter. Back in the days, fishing was a dangerous profession, and according to our guide, 20 percent of the fishermen died at sea. Fortunately, they have much better navigation and safety systems at present.\n\nâMost men in HonningsvÃ¥g work as fishermen, bus drivers â or bothâ, says the guide.\n\nOn our way up to the final destination of this excursion, we pass several interesting sights, such as two tandem bicycles (which apparently is a common scene in North Cape during the summer), the worldâs northernmost fishing village, SkarvÃ¥g (which, according to our guide, just has 45 inhabitants), a SÃ¡mi summer camp, a hotel, and a small archipelago which is a nature reserve for sea birds."
