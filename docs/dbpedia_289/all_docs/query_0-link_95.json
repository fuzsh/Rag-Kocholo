        "text": "3.1 Global Spatial Distribution of Coastal Reclamation by World Regions and Cities\n\nOur results show that among the 135 major coastal cities in the world, 106 cities (78%) have participated in coastal reclamation between 2000 and 2020. The results underline that coastal reclamation is indeed a global-scale phenomenon in the 21st century. In total, more than 253,000 ha of land and enclosed water spaces (Figures 1a and S7 in Supporting Information S1)—equivalent to an area the size of Luxembourg—have been reclaimed by these cities. To break down the global data by world regions, more than 248,550 ha was reclaimed within Asia, followed by Africa (2,277 ha) and Euorpe (2,233 ha) (Figure 1a) Using the classification system used in UN 2018, we further divided the world regions into 17 sub-regions. Figure 1b illustrates that coastal land reclamation has been especially prominent in East Asia (225,290 ha), West Asia (14,998 ha) and Southeast Asia (7,477 ha), followed by Western Europe (1,443 ha) and West Africa (1,290 ha). At the country levels, our results demonstrate that the countries of the Global South with rapidly growing economies, such as China, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Indonesia, Nigeria, Ghana, and Angola have been particularly active in reclaiming the coasts over the past two decades. Among them, China, the UAE, and Indonesia account for approximately 90% of the total coastal area reclaimed in all 106 cities.\n\nAccording to our analysis, many individual cities deserve particular attention, not all of which are known to the international audience for their reclamation efforts. Within the top-tier world regions with the highest reclamation profiles, East Asian cities include Shanghai (34,978 ha, China), Incheon (4,026 ha, South Korea) and Osaka (1,005 ha, Japan). In West Asia, notable cities are those in the UAE including Abu Dhabi (5,408 ha), Dubai (3,604 ha) and Sharjah (24 ha), followed by the cities in Saudi Arabia such as Dammam (3,287 ha) and Jeddah (171 ha). Kuwait (189 ha), Beirut (Lebanon) (103 ha), and Muscat (74 ha, Oman) also have participated in coastal reclamation. Southeast Asian cities such as Singapore (3,135 ha), and Jakarta (839 ha, Indonesia) and Da Nang (266 ha, Vietnam) have also reclaimed substantial areas of land at their coastal frontier.\n\nIn West Africa, Lagos (924 ha, Nigeria), Luanda (200 ha, Angola), and Abidjan (119 ha, in Côte d’Ivoire), Accra (88 ha, in Ghana), Lomé, (48 ha in Togo) and Conakry (28 ha, in Guinea) have extended their coastlines. In addition, more than 300 ha of land areas have been collectively reclaimed in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. They include cities such as Port-au-Prince (Haiti), Panama city (Panama), Buenos Aires (Argentina) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). In the region of Eastern Europe, Saint Petersburg (300 ha, Russia), Copenhagen (119 ha, Denmark) and Helsinki (65, Finland) is particularly notable. The phenomenon of coastal reclamation has been less widespread in Oceania, where 160 ha of the coastal area was reclaimed in Brisbane (Australia), followed by 50 ha in Auckland (New Zealand) and 48 ha in Sydney (Australia). Lastly, cities across North America have not recently engaged in reclamation, with the exception of the Los Angeles Port, which has reclaimed 29 ha in the past 20 years.\n\nFurthermore, coastal reclamation in the last two decades is much more globally widespread than was the case in the previous century (Figures S8.1 and S8.2 in Supporting Information S1) when reclamation was carried out in only relatively few countries, most notably the Netherlands, the United States, and some East Asian countries (China, South Korea, Singapore, and Japan). While 20th century reclamation was concentrated mainly in the global north, rapid urbanization and development in the global south have witnessed a marked shift to coastal cities in the Middle East, West Africa, Southeast Asia, and East Asia (Solarz, 2019). Interestingly, the purposes of land reclamation twentieth century have varied spatially. For example, New York’s Manhattan and San Francisco Bay were reclaimed to create land for development, while in the Netherlands, Dutch engineers originally drained coastal marshes and lagoons for flood control and to counteract shrinking organic soils (Hoeksema, 2007; VanKoningsveld et al., 2008). In East Asian countries, reclamation has often been undertaken for salt production and aquaculture (Chio, 2014; Ding et al., 2019).\n\n3.3 Uses of Coastal Reclamation Land\n\nOur analysis indicates that land reclaimed at the coast is typically used for a limited range of purposes, including transport (especially ports), industry, residential/commercial, agriculture (including aquaculture ponds), tourism, and recreation in the form of wetland parks, greenways and leisure gardens (Figure S9 in Supporting Information S1). Figure 3a shows that the primary land use of coastal reclamation is for port development or expansion and is directly related to the functioning of transport. Of the 106 cities in this study, 78 have engaged in port development or expansion, including strategically important sites in Singapore, Tianjin (China), Mombasa (Kenya), Alexandria (Egypt), and Tangier (Morocco). It is noteworthy that reclamation for port development is especially common in the Middle East, Southeast and East Asia, along with West Africa (Figure 3b). Reclamation for residential/commercial land is the second most common land use and is found in 31 of the cities globally, many of which are located in East Asia (Figure 3b), although examples elsewhere include Tunis (Tunisia), St Petersburg (Russia), Rotterdam (Netherlands), Port-au-Prince (Haiti). A further 19 cities have opted for reclamation to expand their industrial zones, in particular for refineries or fuel depots, including Lagos (Nigeria), Jakarta (Indonesia), Pointe-Noire (Congo), Haifa (Israel) and Ad-Dammam (Saudi Arabia). Additionally, there are 24 reclamation projects currently under construction, including cities such as Xiamen (in China), Jakarta, Jeddah (in Saudi A rabia), Haifa (in Israel), and Karachi (Pakistan).\n\nData extracted from OSM for a city-scale analysis of the top 17 cities in each region with the greatest areas of reclaimed land show that more than 20,000 ha have been reclaimed in these cities. Among these cities, more than 6,000 ha (25%) is being used for transport, mainly ports, followed by road and airport expansion. Additionally, 20% is used for industrial purposes closely associated with port administration (Figures 4a.1 and 4a.2). Coastal cities reclaiming land for residential/commercial purposes (e.g., the infamous Great Sea Wall of Jakarta) accounts for 9% (Figure 4a.3). Furthermore, “greening” of reclaimed land for recreational purposes in the form of parks, greenways and artificial wetland reserves, which together occupy 18% of the total across all cities (Figure 4a.4) is a noteworthy land-use type. In Shanghai and Dubai, >3,800 ha of reclaimed land is now being used for recreation, serving additionally the functions of coastal restoration and protection, mainly in the form of artificial parks. Reclamation for agriculture and aquaculture, notably in Shanghai, is another prominent land use, accounting for more than 3,800 ha (17%) in all (Figure 4a.5). While reclaimed land allocated to tourism infrastructure and facilities is a relatively minor land use (2.82%, Figures 4a.6 and 4b), it includes some highly prestigious developments designed to gain reputation and competitive advantage in terms of investment (Paris, 2017), for example, the iconic Palm Jumeirah and The World in Dubai (UAE), the latter being one of the world’s largest examples of reclamation (>5,000 ha) for prestige purposes. Other examples include Haikou, China (715 ha), Makassar, Indonesia (158 ha), Muscat, Oman (60 ha), Ad-Dammam, Saudi Arabia (56 ha), and Panama City (12 ha), where land reclaimed from the sea is occupied by luxurious hotels and amusement parks, elite residential establishments and exclusive commercial centers. Analysis of building footprints for the five largest sites reclaimed for high-profile prestige constructions reveals a total of 1,719 buildings covering more than 260 ha of land area (a = density, DB = 6.6 buildings/ha) (Figures 4c and 4d. According to current OSM data, some 1,202 buildings collectively in the eco-city of Abu Dhabi, Tunis, and Muscat are used for high-end tourism resorts and residential complexes and occupy more than 220 ha (DB = 5 buildings/ha). The Palm Jumeirah in Dubai comprises more than 250 luxurious villas/buildings on just 18 ha of land (DB = 13.9/ha). Similarly, 240 buildings over the reclaimed Ocean Flower Island in Hainan, China cover more than 20 ha (DB = 12/ha), although this project has been subject to considerable controversy environmental issues (Man, 2020)."
