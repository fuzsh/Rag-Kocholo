        "text": "The 2014-built Norwegian Getaway cruise ship is the second of two Breakaway-class NCL liners - preceded by Breakaway (2013). The next generation (biggest class) NCL Norwegian vessels are the new Breakaway-Plus ships Norwegian Escape (2015), Norwegian Joy (2017) and Norwegian Bliss (2018).\n\nThe vessel (IMO number 9606924) is currently Bahamas-flagged (MMSI 311050900) and registered in Nassau.\n\nHistory - construction and ownership\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line (NCL) is a subsidiary company of the shipping corporation Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCLH). NCL was founded in 1966, headquartered in Miami (Florida USA) and publicly traded (NASDAQ) company listed on NYSE (NYC). NCLH's major shareholders are the corporations Apollo Global Management (American), Genting Group (Malaysian) and TPG Capital (American). In 2017, the brand NCL had a worldwide cruise market share 8,7% (passengers) and 8,4% (revenue). NCLH (shipowner) owns the brands NCL, Oceania and RSSC-Regent.\n\nThe 4000-passenger ship Norwegian Getaway was finished and delivered to her owner, Norwegian Cruise Line, on January 10, 2014. The vessel was built by Meyer Werft in Papenburg, Germany and is located most of the time in Miami (where was the ceremony of naming the Norwegian Getaway on February 7, 2014). The name of Getaway was chosen after a competition. While the ship was under construction, on 5 March 2013 a fire broke out. Luckily, no one was injured and the accident did not stop the construction works.\n\nDecks and Cabins\n\nNorwegian Getaway has a total of 2014 cabins (of which 1343 outside, 530 Inside, 127 single cabins) in 42 grades. Most Norwegian Getaway staterooms are 170-sq. foot Balcony rooms. 42 are the wheelchair accessible rooms. The largest aboard Norwegian Getaway is the Haven Deluxe Owner’s Suites (740 ft2).\n\nNorwegian Getaway staterooms (2008 total, in 42 grades) include 1343 outside, 530 Inside, 59 Studios (single cabins). Most staterooms are sized 160-170 ft2 (15-16 m2). Balcony cabins are 998, Oceanviews 156, Inside 449. Wheelchair-accessible cabins are 42. The largest accommodations are The Haven Deluxe Owners Suites (740 ft2 / 70 m2, with wraparound terrace sized 190 ft2 / 18 m2).\n\nThe boat has 18 decks, of which 14 are passenger-accessible and 10 with cabins.\n\nShipboard dining options - Food and Drinks\n\nWhen it comes to dining on Norwegian Getaway, Freestyle is the norm. It means guests can eat virtually when they want, where they want. This applies to the extra-fee dining, as well as included or free dining. Traditionalists enjoy the three \"main dining rooms\": The Tropicana and more-intimate Taste and Savor. Thanks to Norwegian's drive to improve all dining options in 2014, quality is generally good. Guests had complained about the declining quality, and NCL invested in improving on standards and new menu options. Healthy and vegetarian options are always available. One of Norwegian's greatest strengths is the vast range of dining venues. Passengers can try a French bistro, Italian trattoria, Asian Teppanyaki, Brazilian churrascaria, steakhouse, seafood restaurant, a raw bar and a noodle bar. All speciality dining carries an 18% auto-gratuity.\n\nFollows the complete list of Norwegian Getaway restaurants and food bars.\n\nSavor Restaurant (282-seat forward Dining Room, complimentary)\n\nTaste Restaurant (282-seat forward Dining Room, complimentary, with Your Time dining)\n\nLe Bistro (114-seat French speciality dinner-only restaurant; reservations-only; US$20 cover charge)\n\nTeppanyaki (96-seat Japanese Hibachi speciality, reservations-only restaurant; US$25; open for Lunch and Dinner; features live cooking demonstrations)\n\nThe Tropicana Restaurant (632-seat aft Dining Room; NYC private club design; complimentary; Freestyle dining, Dinner only)\n\nO’Sheehan’s Neighbourhood Bar & Grill (285-seat sports bar, with 24-hour American cuisine - burgers, steaks, desserts; complimentary)\n\nShanghai’s Noodle Bar (53-seat Asian cuisine complimentary restaurant inside O’Sheehan’s Pub area)\n\nCagney’s Steakhouse (speciality dinner restaurant for prime steaks and gourmet seafood specialities; reservations-only, US$30 cover charge per person and free Kids Menu).\n\nModerno Churrascaria (124-seat Brazilian steakhouse; reservations-only; US$20 per person cover charge; with outdoor seating waterfront area)\n\nLa Cucina (168-seat Italian speciality restaurant; reservations-only, US$15 cover charge; with outdoor seating waterfront area)\n\nOcean Blue (seafood speciality restaurant; reservations-only, US$39 per person cover charge. “Ocean Blue on the Waterfront” is the outdoor seating area)\n\nRaw Bar (10-seat seafood restaurant)\n\nWasabi Sushi Bar (a la carte)\n\nGarden Cafe (complimentary buffet restaurant with various cuisine stations)\n\nOpen-Air Garden Cafe (the outdoor extension of Garden Cafe restaurant; complimentary)\n\nFlamingo Bar & Grill (complimentary casual restaurant by the Aqua Park)\n\nFull-service Starbucks licensed store.\n\nShipboard entertainment options - Fun and Sport\n\nPassengers can enjoy The Waterfront, new unique feature which represents an open-air promenade constructed to be the connection between guests and the ocean.
