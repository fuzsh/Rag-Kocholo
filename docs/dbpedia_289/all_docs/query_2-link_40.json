        "text": "Now an established part of Boston's skyline, Atlantic Wharf's design is able to preserve the texture and streetscape of the historic site, and integrates it with a modern high-rise glass tower and luxury residential space.\n\nThe 1897 Peabody & Stearns Atlantic Building on the west corner of the Atlantic Wharf site has been completely renovated to provide loft-style residences and ground-floor retail space. The historic limestone façade was restored, creating a nice juxtaposition with the airy, contemporary design for the apartments. The units feature high ceilings, open planning, and modern finishes, all with a dedicated share club room, fitness room, and new lobby.\n\nThe design takes advantage of the high-spaced office and warehouse structure but brings sophisticated boutique elegance to the spacious residences."
