Your commitment to the teamwork concept, precise planning, and exceptional execution was key to the completion of these projects within the highly aggressive schedule.”\n\n“Grande Masonry was selected by John Moriarty & Associates and Boston Properties to provide masonry restoration services for the high-visibility Atlantic Wharf project in downtown Boston. We were very pleased with the attention to detail and the quality of the final product. Grande worked closely with the entire team and the historical consultants to make this a successful project.”\n\n“The scope of the exterior masonry work on the George J. West Elementary School project was comprehensive and detailed and required intricate planning and coordination to be completed successfully within the exceptionally limited time allowed. This project was completed on time and on budget and the finished work is of the highest quality. The tremendous efforts and contributions made by your team were key.”\n\n“I would like to take this opportunity to thank your organization for flawless execution of an extremely difficult project. We are now in great shape to deliver an excellent finish but none of this would have been possible without Grande Masonry rising to the challenge and reinforcing everyone’s faith in our ability to execute. Thank you for your commitment and continued effort to ensuring our mutual success.”\n\n“We wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the performance of your team during the $80 million renovation to the Dunkin’ Donuts Center in Providence, Rhode Island. The tremendous efforts and contributions made by your team are credited specifically with success of the project. We look forward to working with your team again in the future.”\n\n“Grande Masonry exemplifies all of the depth and strength that a Construction Manager, Owner and Architect are looking for when building a high performance Project Team. Safety, Quality, Competitiveness, Knowledge, Experience and Schedule are consistently delivered at the highest standard in the industry. Couple this with unmatched sophistication and responsiveness and any project that involves large scale detailed masonry/stone or complex and sensitive masonry/stone restoration would be well served to bring Grande Masonry onto their Project Team.”"
