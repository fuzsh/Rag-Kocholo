        "text": "Laws enacted by Congress are presumed to apply within the territory of the United States (including within either a 3- or 12-nautical mile territorial sea), unless otherwise explicitly provided. The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the longstanding principle and basic premise of the American legal system that “absent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application.\"RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 2100 (2016) (citing Morrison v. National Australia Bank, Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 255 (2010) offsite link).\n\nIn 2016, the Supreme Court stated that the presumption of extraterritoriality “serves to avoid the international discord that can result when U.S. law is applied to conduct in foreign countries” and “reflects the more prosaic ‘commonsense notion that Congress generally legislates with domestic concerns in mind.’” Id. at 2100. The Court has also developed a two-step framework to analyze extraterritoriality issues: “At the first step, we ask whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted—that is, whether the statute gives a clear affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially. . . . If the statute is not extraterritorial, then at the second step we determine whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute, and we do this by looking to the statute’s ‘focus’ [of congressional concern]. If the conduct relevant to the statute’s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad; but if the conduct relevant to the focus occurred in a foreign country, it is an impermissible extraterritorial application regardless of any other conduct that occurred in U.S. territory.” Id. at 2101.\n\nCongress may, of course, legislate beyond the territorial boundaries of the United States. See, e.g., Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 117 (2013) (“Congress, even in a jurisdictional provision, can indicate that it intends federal law to apply to conduct occurring abroad”).\n\nNOAA administers a number of laws that, as a matter of law or policy, it interprets as applying beyond the territory of the United States. In addition, there are laws of interest to NOAA that have been interpreted to apply beyond the territory of the United States.\n\nLast Updated August 10, 2018\n\nAbandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, 43 U.S.C. §§ 2101 et seq\n\nThe Abandoned Shipwreck Act (ASA) was enacted by Congress to clarify the legal regime governing title to abandoned shipwrecks on state submerged lands, and to balance the needs of three major interest groups—sport divers, would-be salvors, and preservationists. See H.R. Rep. No. 98-887 pt. 1, at 4 (1984); see also 43 U.S.C. § 2106(a) offsite link.\n\nWith the exception of wrecks on certain federal public lands, the ASA asserts U.S. title to abandoned shipwrecks and automatically transfers the title to the individual coastal state in or on whose submerged lands the shipwreck is located. 43 U.S.C. § 2105(c) offsite link. The Act applies to three categories of shipwrecks: (1) those embedded in the submerged lands of a state; (2) those embedded in coralline formations protected by a state on submerged lands of a state;and (3) those on a state’s submerged lands and included in or determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register. 43 U.S.C. § 2105(a) offsite link. Under the ASA, a shipwreck is abandoned if it is “deserted” and “the owner has relinquished ownership rights with no retention.” 43 U.S.C. § 2101(b) offsite link. A shipwreck is embedded if it is “firmly affixed in the submerged lands or in coralline formations such that the use of tools of excavation is required in order to move the bottom sediments to gain access to the shipwreck, its cargo, and any part thereof.” 43 U.S.C. § 2101(a) offsite link.\n\nThe ASA applies on State submerged lands which generally extend seaward a distance of three nautical miles from the coastline as defined under the Submerged Lands Act. 43 U.S.C. § 2102(f)(1) offsite link; see also 43 U.S.C. § 1301(b) offsite link. In the cases of Texas and the Gulf Coast of Florida, the ASA applies seaward a distance of three marine leagues—or nine nautical miles—from the coastline per Supreme Court decisions and grants from the Kingdom of Spain and Mexico. See 43 U.S.C. § 2101(f)(1) offsite link; see also 43 U.S.C. § 1301(b) offsite link; United States v. Louisiana, offsite link 363 U.S. 1 (1960)(holding that the Submerged Lands Act grants Texas and Florida a three-marine-league belt of submerged land extending from their coastlines); Treaty between United States and Spain, Feb. 22, 1819, 8 Stat. 252 offsite link, art. 3 (“The boundary line between the two countries, west of the Mississippi, shall begin on the Gul[f] of Mexico, at the mouth of the river Sabine, in the sea, continuing north, along the western bank of that river”); Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo offsite link, Feb. 2, 1848, art. 5 (“The boundary line between the two Republics shall commence in the Gulf of Mexico three leagues from land opposite the mouth of the Rio Grande, from thence up the middle of that river”). The Act also applies seaward to a distance of three marine leagues from the coastline of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. See 43 U.S.C. § 2102(f)(2) offsite link; see also 48 U.S.C. § 749 offsite link. For the U.S. territories and possessions of Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Northern Mariana Islands, the ASA applies seaward a distance of three nautical miles from their coastlines. See 43 U.S.C. § 2102(f)(3)-(4) offsite link; see also 48 U.S.C. § 1705(a) offsite link; 159 Cong. Rec. S521-01. In the Great Lakes, the ASA applies seaward from each bordering U.S. state to the international maritime boundary with Canada.\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nAbandoned Shipwreck Act of 1987, 43 U.S.C. §§ 2101 et seq.\n\nSubmerged Lands Act, 43 U.S.C. §§ 1301 et seq.\n\nAbandoned Shipwreck Act Guidelines, compilation by National Park Service\n\nOcean Law Search, NOAA & BOEM Summary of Abandoned Shipwreck Act cases legislative history\n\nLast updated August 7, 2019\n\nAct to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS), 33 U.S.C. §§ 1901 et seq.\n\nThe 1973 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships as modified by the Protocol of 1978 and the Protocol of 1997 (MARPOL offsite link) is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by ships from operational or accidental causes. MARPOL contains standards for stowing, handling, shipping, and transferring pollutant cargoes, as well as standards for ship-generated wastes. MARPOL has six Annexes, each regulating a different type of discharge from ships. The United States is party to all MARPOL Annexes except Annex IV. The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS),33 U.S.C. §§ 1901 et seq., implements Annexes I, II, V, and VI. The U.S. Coast Guardadministers APPS, under which it prescribes and enforces regulations to implement APPS.33 C.F.R. 151.\n\nGenerally speaking, APPS applies to all U.S.-flagged ships anywhere in the world and to all foreign-flagged vessels operating in navigable waters of the United States or while at a port under U.S. jurisdiction, consistent with international law. APPS defines “navigable waters of the United States” as including “the territorial sea of the United States (as defined in the Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988) and the internal waters of the United States.” 33 U.S.C. § 1901(a)(7) offsite link.\n\nMore specifically, the seaward limit of APPS jurisdiction is set forth below.\n\nTable: Applicability and Seaward Limit Jurisdiction of APPS\n\nMARPOL Annex Under 33 U.S.C. § 1902(a)(1)offsite link offsite link, APPS applies to: Under 33 U.S.C. § 1902offsite link offsite link, the following Annex-specific seaward limits also apply to: Implementing Regulations I - Oil\n\na ship of United States registry or nationality, OR\n\na ship operated under the authority of the United States, wherever located.\n\na ship in the navigable waters of the United States, 33 U.S.C. § 1902(a)(2)offsite link offsite link.\n\n33 C.F.R.

While APPS also exempts ships of the Armed Forces from Annex V requirements, the statute prescribes the types of garbage these ships may or may not discharge into the sea. For these ships, depending on the type of garbage and garbage-processing equipment aboard the vessels, garbage disposal must take place at least 3 nautical miles, 12 nautical miles, or 25 nautical miles from land. 33 U.S.C. § 1902(b)(3)(C)-(D) offsite link.\n\nU.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal have held that the United States has jurisdiction to prosecute a foreign-flagged ship’s failure to maintain an accurate Oil Record Book within U.S. ports or navigable waters, even though the actual discharge of illegal pollution may occur outside of U.S. ports or navigable waters. U.S. Coast Guard implementing regulations at 33 C.F.R. § 151.25 requiring ships to “maintain” an Oil Record Book impose a duty on ships to ensure the accuracy of these documents, see United States v. Ionia Mgmt. S.A. offsite link, 555 F.3d 303 (2d Cir. 2009); United States v. Jho offsite link, 534 F.3d 398 (5th Cir. 2008).\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nUnited States v. Jho offsite link, 534 F.3d 398 (5th Cir. 2008); (holding that the U.S. may criminally prosecute a foreign-flagged vessel under APPS for failing to maintain an Oil Record Book, including for conduct that took place outside U.S. jurisdiction, because the violation occurs the moment the vessel enters a U.S. port with an inaccurate record book); See also United States v. Ionia Mgmt. S.A. offsite link, 555 F.3d 303 (2d Cir. 2009) (same); United States v. Sanford Ltd. offsite link, 880 F. Supp. 2d. 9 (D.D.C. 2012) (Same)\n\nUnited States v.

Supp. 2d. 9, 17-18 (D.D.C. 2012) (“whether the United States could prosecute actions on the high seas had no bearing on whether the United States had jurisdiction to enforce its laws [in a domestic port] regarding the commission of false statements made to a United States agency performing its regular and proper duties.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nUnited States. v. Pena offsite link, 684 F.3d 1137 (11th Cir. 2012) (affirming conviction of a nominated surveyor of foreign-flagged ship for violations of APPS and MARPOL while ship was docked in a U.S. port).\n\nRegency Cruises, Inc., Convicted of Dumping Sentence to Include $250,000 Criminal Fine. Two foreign-flag cruise ship knowingly discharged plastic bags of garbage within the U.S. EEZ off the coast of Florida and were ordered to pay a $250,000 fine. DOJ charged and the cruise ship pled guilty to the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. This was the first APPS case to charge dumping of plastic beyond the U.S. 12-mile territorial limit.\n\nUpdated April 15, 2020\n\nAirborne Hunting Act, 16 U.S.C. § 742j-1\n\nThe Airborne Hunting Act offsite link (AHA) prohibits the shooting, attempted shooting, or harassment of any bird, fish, or animal from an aircraft. 16 U.S.C. §§ 742j-1(a)(1)-(2) offsite link. Congress passed the AHA in 1971 in response to the public outcry over the hunting of wildlife from aircraft depicted in a 1969 television special on the airborne hunting of wolves. See S. Rep. No. 92-421, 92d Cong., 1st Sess, cited in United States v. One Bell Jet Ranger II Helicopter, 943 F.2d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir. 1991). See also United States v. Red Frame Parasail, 160 F.Supp. 2d 1048, 1053-1054 (D. Ariz. 2001). For violations, the statute authorizes a fine of up to $5,000, one-year imprisonment, or both. 16 U.S.C. § 742j-1(a)(3) offsite link. The statute also authorizes forfeiture of the animals shot or captured in violation of the AHA, as well as the equipment and aircraft used in violation of the AHA. 16 U.S.C. § 742j-1(e) offsite link.\n\nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) implementing regulations specify that the AHA applies to all persons within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, to all United States citizens whether within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States or on the high seas or on board an aircraft in flight over the high seas, and to all persons on board aircraft belonging in whole or part to any United States citizen, firm, partnership, or corporation created by or under the laws of the United States, or any State, territory or possession thereof. 50 C.F.R. § 19.2.

It requires that they comply with restrictions on the discharge of sewage and graywater. Pub. L. 106–554, 114 Stat. 2763, 2763A–315 §§ 1401–1402 (2000). In particular, the Act prohibits the discharge of untreated sewage into the waters listed above and specifies the manner in which cruise vessels may permissibly discharge treated sewage and graywater. Id. §§ 1403–1404. To enforce these restrictions, the Act includes monitoring and reporting requirements and provides for administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for various violations. Id. §§ 1406–1410. The seaward limit of the three areas to which the Act applies is as follows:\n\nNavigable Waters of the United States within Alaska: The term “navigable waters” under the Act has the same meaning as in the Clean Water Act, which defines the term to mean “the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.” Id. § 1414(5). Under the Clean Water Act, the territorial seas are the belt of the seas measured from the line of ordinary low water along that portion of the coast which is in direct contact with the open sea and the line marking the seaward limit of inland waters, and extending seaward a distance of three miles. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(8). offsite link The term \"within the State of Alaska\" clarifies that only those navigable waters within Alaska's state boundaries are subject to the requirements of the Act. Under the Submerged Lands Act (SLA), Alaska has title to submerged lands extending three geographic miles seaward of its coastline (equivalent to three nautical miles). See 43 U.S.C. § 1312 offsite link; see also Alaska Const. art. XII, § 1 (defining state boundaries as \"all the territory, together with the territorial waters appurtenant thereto, included in the Territory of Alaska upon the date of ratification of this constitution by the people of Alaska,\" which included lands granted by the SLA). Therefore, navigable waters up to 3 nautical miles seaward of the Alaskan coast are \"within the State of Alaska\" for the purposes of the Act.\n\nWaters of the Alexander Archipelago: The Act defines these waters as:\n\nall waters under the sovereignty of the United States within or near Southeast Alaska, beginning at a point 58°11′41′′N, 136°39′25′′W [near Cape Spencer Light], thence southeasterly along a line three nautical miles seaward of the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured in the Pacific Ocean and the Dixon Entrance, except where this line intersects geodesics connecting the following five pairs of points:\n\n(1) 58°05′17′′N, 136°33′49′′W and 58°11′41′′N,136°39′25′′W [Cross Sound].\n\n(2) 56°09′40′′N, 134°40′00′′W and 55°49′15′′N,134°17′40′′W [Chatham Strait].\n\n(3) 55°49′15′′N, 134°17′40′′W and 55°50′30′′N,133°54′15′′W [Sumner Strait].\n\n(4) 54°41′30′′N, 132°01′00′′W and 54°51′′30′′N,131°20′45′′W [Clarence Strait].\n\n(5) 54°51′30′′N, 131°20′45′′W and 54°46′15′′N,130°52′00′′W [Revillagigedo Channel].\n\nThe portion of each such geodesic situated beyond three nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured forms the outer limit of the waters of the Alexander Archipelago in those five locations.\n\nPub. L. 106–554, 114 Stat. 2763A–322 to 2763A–323 § 1414(11) (emphasis added). The waters of the Alexander Archipelago waters are shaded blue on the map below, and the five geodesic lines referenced in the statutory text are drawn in purple. The waters of the Alexander Archipelago are almost entirely within Alaska state waters, except where the purple geodesic lines mark the seaward limit of the Act and extend jurisdiction beyond 3 nautical miles from the coast.\n\nNavigable Waters of the United States within the Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve: The Kachemak Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve is located 240 miles south of Anchorage on the western coast of the Kenai Peninsula and is the nation’s largest estuarine research reserve. The western edge of the Reserve is 24 miles wide at Kachemak Bay’s entrance between Anchor Point and Point Pogibshi, which also marks the seaward limit of inland waters. Thus, the entirety of the Reserve is within Alaska state waters.\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nConsolidated Appropriations Act of 2001, Pub.

The ACA prohibits a number of acts unless specifically authorized by the National Science Foundation. These acts include: taking of native mammals, birds or plants in Antarctica; harmfully interfering with native mammals, birds, plants or invertebrates in Antarctica; entering Antarctic Specially Protected Areas; introducing non-indigenous animals or plants into Antarctica; importing into the United States or exporting to another country any native bird, mammal or plant taken in violation of the ACA; and introducing or discharging any waste in Antarctica. 16 U.S.C. § 2403 offsite link.

Convention, Arts. I offsite link and III offsite link. This is known as the Convention Area offsite link. In addition, Article VII of the Convention establishes a Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) offsite link, the function of which is to give effect to the objective and principles of the Convention, including by adopting conservation and management measures (CMs) that are binding on all Members and Contracting Parties. Convention, Art. IX offsite link. The United States is a Member of CCAMLR.\n\nCCAMLR CMs offsite link apply to harvesting of living marine resources and associated activities that occur inside the Convention Area as well as to certain activities, in particular the trade in toothfish (Dissostichus spp.), that occur outside the Convention Area. Trade in toothfish is governed by a catch documentation scheme (CM 10-05 offsite link) that tracks toothfish from the point of harvest through final import for consumption. In addition to adopting CMs that address the conservation and management of target species, CCAMLR has adopted a number of measures intended to protect non-target species. These include measures to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from the adverse impacts of bottom fishing (CMs 22-05 offsite link, 22-06 offsite link, 22-07 offsite link and 22-09 offsite link), minimize bycatch of sharks (CM 32-18 offsite link) and seabirds (CMs 24-02 offsite link, 25-02 offsite link and 25-03 offsite link), and establish a framework for establishment of marine protected areas (CM 91-04 offsite link).\n\nThe United States implements CCAMLR CMs through regulations that are promulgated by NOAA, in consultation with the Department of State, the U.S. Coast Guard and other federal agencies as appropriate. 16 U.S.C. § 2436 offsite link; 50 C.F.R.

The Act grants the President authority to establish national monuments on lands \"owned or controlled by the United States\" that contain objects or areas of historic or scientific interest. Presidential designation of land as a national monument can limit land uses. In particular, development or recreation may be regulated or prohibited to protect the objects or areas listed in the Presidential proclamation establishing the national monument.\n\nThe Act has been construed to apply in the marine environment to the outer limit of the exclusive economic zone (OLC Opinion Sept. 2000). The Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel issued an Opinion dated September 15, 2000 which provides that the President \"may use his authority under the Antiquities Act to establish a national monument in the exclusive economic zone to protect marine resources.\" As noted in Alaska v. United States (2005), the Act also gives the President the power to reserve submerged lands for the purpose of protecting wildlife and nature, even lands to which rights, title, and interest may otherwise have been granted to states under theSubmerged Lands Act . In Alaska v. United States, the National Monument in question, Glacier Bay, was established before Alaska became a state.\n\nIn Massachusetts Lobstermen’s Association v. Ross (2018) offsite link, a district court upheld the designation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument and held that the government exercises sovereign rights to “explor[e], exploit[], conserv[e] and manag[e] natural resources, both living and non-living, of the seabed and subsoil and super adjacent waters” and the responsibility for “protection and preservation of the marine environment” within the exclusive economic zone and the territorial sea with few limitations.

The five monuments — the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument, the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument, the Rose Atoll Marine National Monument, and the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Monument — encompass more than 500 million acres of marine environment.

The CBA defines a recreational vessel as any vessel that is manufactured or used primarily for pleasure, or that is leased, rented, or chartered to a person for the pleasure of that person. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(25)(A) offsite link. The Act does not apply to any vessel subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) that is engaged in commercial use or carries paying passengers. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(25)(B) offsite link.\n\nThe CBA exempts from the Clean Water Act’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System all discharges incidental to the normal operation of recreational vessels other than sewage. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(r) offsite link. Instead, the CBA requires recreational vessels to comply with certain management practices. In forming these management practices, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) determines, in consultation with the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”), the U.S. Department of Commerce (“DOC)” and interested States, which discharges are reasonable and practicable. 33 U.S.C. § 1322(o)(2) offsite link. For each identified discharge, EPA, in consultation with USCG, DOC, other interested Federal agencies, and interested States, must promulgate Federal standards of performance. 33 U.S.C. § 1322(o)(3) offsite link. Once EPA issues these Federal standards of performance, USCG must promulgate regulations governing the design, construction, installation, and use of management practices as are necessary for recreational vessels to meet the standards. 33 U.S.C. § 1322(o)(4) offsite link.\n\nAfter the effective date of the USCG’s regulations, owners and operators of recreational vessel are prohibited from operating in or discharging into “the waters of the United States or the waters of the contiguous zone” unless they implement the management practices. 33 U.S.C. § 1322(o)(6) offsite link. The Clean Water Act defines the “contiguous zone” as \"the entire zone established or to be established by the United States under article 24 of the [1958] Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1362(9) offsite link. Under this Convention, “[t]he contiguous zone may not extend beyond twelve miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured.” 1958 Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone art. 24, Apr. 29, 1958, 15 U.S.T. 1606, 516 U.N.T.S. 205. offsite link Thus, CBA’s prohibition applies within the belt of seas that encompasses waters to a seaward limit of 12 nautical miles from the U.S. baseline (generally the mean low-water line).\n\nClean Water Act, Previously Referred to as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq offsite link\n\nThe Clean Water Act (CWA or the Act) identifies different seaward jurisdictional limits for a variety of different purposes. The regulatory provisions of the CWA control the “discharges of pollutants.” The Act defines “discharge of a pollutant” to include the addition of pollutants to “navigable waters” from any point source and the addition of pollutants to waters of the “contiguous zone” or the “ocean” from any point source other than a vessel or other floating craft. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(12) offsite link. offsite link\n\nThe CWA defines \"navigable waters\" as \"waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1362(7) offsite link. The term “territorial seas” are in turn defined as the belt of seas extending three miles* seaward of the ordinary low water mark. 33 U.S.C. § 1362(8) offsite link. Beyond the three-mile territorial seas, the jurisdiction of the Act extends seaward to include the next nine mile \"contiguous zone.\" 33 U.S.C. § 1362(9) offsite link; Department of State Public Notice 358, 37 Fed. Reg. 11,906 (June 15, 1972). Because the CWA’s provisions applicable to state water quality standards and state National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permitting programs extend to the navigable waters (i.e., the waters of the United States, including the territorial seas), courts have held that state NPDES permitting programs apply only to the navigable waters, and thus that only the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency may issue CWA permits for NPDES discharges beyond the three-mile territorial sea.

More specifically, to provide charts and related information for the safe navigation of marine commerce, the CGSA authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to conduct:\n\nhydrographic and topographic surveys;\n\ntide and current observations;\n\ngeodetic-control activities; and\n\ngeomagnetic, seismological, gravity and related geophysical measurements and investigations, and observations for the determination of variation in latitude and longitude.\n\n33 U.S.C. §§ 883a. The CGSA also authorizes the Secretary to conduct investigations and research in geophysical sciences, including geodesy, oceanography, seismology, and geomagnetism, 33 U.S.C. §883d, to enter into certain agreements for surveys or investigations related to the surveying and mapping activities authorized under the CGSA, 33 U.S.C. § 883e, and to contract for services, 33 U.S.C. §§ 883f. The Secretary of Commerce has delegated coast and geodetic survey functions to NOAA’s National Ocean Service (NOS), which carries out the activities authorized by the CGSA. See Dep’t of Commerce Dep’t Org. Order 25-5.\n\nThe CGSA, as amended, is silent regarding the geographic scope of the activities it authorizes the agency to undertake. 33 U.S.C. §§ 883c. However, as enacted in 1947, the CGSA restricted the geographic scope of authorized activities to “the United States, its Territories, and possessions.” See Coast & Geodetic Survey Act, 80 Stat. 1091 (Aug. 6, 1947). Hydrographic and topographic surveys were restricted to inland water and “coastal water and land areas (including offlying islands, banks, shoals, and other offshore areas).” Id. In 1960, Congress amended the Act to remove all of its geographical restrictions. See Pub. L. 86-904, 74 Stat. 16 (April 5, 1960) (stating that the purpose of the act was to “remove geographical limitations on activities of the Coast & Geodetic Survey”). Accordingly, the CGSA as amended authorizes the agency to undertake the statutorily enumerated activities anywhere.\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nNOAA’s Office of Coast Survey\n\nNOAA’s National Geodetic Survey\n\nCoast & Geodetic Survey Act of 1947, 80 Stat. 1091 (Aug. 6, 1947)\n\nAct to Remove Geographical Limitations on Activities of the Coast & Geodetic Survey, Pub.

In 1970, it became part of NOAA pursuant to Reorganization No.4.\n\nUpdated May 17, 2019\n\nCoastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq.\n\nThe Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), enacted in 1972, encourages coastal states to develop and implement Coastal Zone Management Plans (CZMPs), with the aim of preserving, protecting, developing, and restoring the coastal zones and coastal resources. Most coastal states have federally approved CZMPs.\n\nThe term \"coastal zone,\" as applied to coastal states, includes the coastal waters, the lands found in and under the coastal waters, and the adjacent shorelands (16 U.S.C. § 1453(1)). The coastal zone extends, in the Great Lakes, to the international boundary between the United States and Canada and, in other areas, to the outer limit of state title and ownership under the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. §§ 1301 et seq.), the Act of March 2, 1917 (48 U.S.C. § 709), the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, as approved by the Act of March 24, 1976 (48 U.S.C. § § 1801 et seq.), or Section 1 of the Act of November 20, 1963 (48 U.S.C. § 1705) (16 U.S.C. § 1453). However, states’ coastal zones specifically excludes \"lands the use of which is by law subject solely to the discretion of or which is held in trust by the Federal Government, its officers or agents.\"\n\nU.S. jurisdiction over waters off its coasts extends to the seaward limit of its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and to the outer limit of its continental shelf (Presidential Proclamation 5030 of March 10, 1983: Exclusive Economic Zone of the United States (48 Fed. Reg. 10605); Presidential Proclamation 2667 of September 28, 1945 (10 Fed. Reg. 12303). The CZMA contains a \"federal consistency provision,\" that requires federal agency activities that have reasonably foreseeable effects on state coastal zones to be consistent to the maximum extent practicable with the enforceable policies of a coastal state’s federally approved coastal management program (16 U.S.C. § 1456).\n\nAdditional reference information:,\n\nCoastal Zone Management Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1451 et seq.\n\nNOAA CZMA Regulations offsite link, 15 C.F.R.

The first section in this chapter makes it a crime to conspire to destroy any US or foreign flagged vessel with the intent to harm a lender or underwriter of the vessel. 18 U.S.C. § 2271 offsite link. This section applies within the US, including the territorial sea; or if the offense is committed by or against a US national or US vessel, on the high seas. 18 U.S.C. § 2271; see also Jurisdiction over Flagged Vessels page.\n\nThe actual destruction of a vessel by its owner with the intent to injure an underwriter, lender, or other owner of the vessel is also a crime, for which life in prison may be imposed. 18 U.S.C. § 2272 offsite link. This section applies to all US nationals and US flagged vessels anywhere located.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2273 offsite link makes it a crime for a non-owner to cast away or otherwise destroy a vessel of the US anywhere located, or to willfully attempt to do so. 18 U.S.C. § 2273. A “vessel of the US” in this section refers to a vessel belonging at least in part to the US, a US citizen, or a US corporation. 18 U.S.C. § 9 offsite link. The statute applies wherever the vessel of the US is located. 18 U.S.C. § 2273.\n\nPub. L. 103–322 criminalizes the destruction of, injury to, or improper use of any vessel (private, public, foreign or domestic) by its owner, master, or crew. Congress originally enacted this statute during wartime as a part of the Espionage Act of 1917. Its purpose was to prevent the use of a vessel as a place for planning espionage against the US. See The Leme, 77 F. Supp. 773, 778 (D. Or. 1948) offsite link. When the Espionage Act was repealed following World War II, this provision was moved to 18 U.S.C. § 2274. It applies within the “territorial waters” of the US. 18 U.S.C. § 2274. “Territorial waters” is not defined in the statute, but would include the territorial sea at the time of enactment in 1948, which extended at that time three nautical miles (nm) seaward from the coast. See United States v. Whitmore, 536 F. Supp. 1284 (D. Me. 1982) offsite link.\n\nSetting fire to or tampering with a vessel, or attempting to do so, is also a crime if it is intended to endanger the safety of the vessel. 18 U.S.C. § 2275 offsite link. This includes tampering with the “motive power” of a vessel by disabling its engines. See United States v. Franicevich, 465 F.2d 467 (5th Cir. 1972) offsite link. This statute applies to vessels of American registry anywhere located. 18 U.S.C. § 2275. It also applies to foreign flagged vessels or vessels belonging at least in part to the US, a US citizen, or a US corporation, while within the internal waters or territorial sea of the US. 18 U.S.C. § 2275. It is irrelevant for the purposes of the statute whether the danger to the vessel is intended to take place within US jurisdiction or outside of it, so long as it is intended to endanger the safety of the vessel. 18 U.S.C. § 2275.\n\nBreaking or entering any vessel (US or foreign flagged) with intent to commit a felony is also a criminal act. 18 U.S.C. § 2276 offsite link. Acts covered by this statute include maliciously cutting or destroying cables fixed to the anchor of a vessel. 18 U.S.C. § 2276. This statute applies when the crime is committed within the internal waters or territorial sea of the US, as well as on the high seas and within foreign territorial waters provided that the offense is committed by or against a US national or US vessel. 18 U.S.C. § 2276.\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2271 offsite link.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2272 offsite link.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2273 offsite link.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 9 offsite link.\n\nThe Espionage Act offsite link.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2274 offsite link.\n\n1 U.S.C. § 3. offsite link\n\nThe Leme, 77 F.

S. Rept. 91-795, 1 (1970). The crown-of-thorns starfish primarily feeds on coral tissue, damaging reef ecosystems at alarming rates when present in high concentrations. See Coral Health and Threats in the Pacific Islands | NOAA Fisheries. COTSA’s purpose is to conserve and protect the “coral reef resources of the tropical islands of interest and concern to the United States in the Pacific,” to prevent erosion of critical island areas, and to “safeguard future recreational and esthetic uses of Pacific coral reefs.” 16 U.S.C. § 1211.\n\nCOTSA authorizes the Department of Commerce and the Smithsonian Institution to “cooperate with and provide assistance to the governments” of these islands in the study and control of the crown-of-thorns starfish. Id.; 16 U.S.C. § 1213. Specifically, COTSA authorizes: (1) research to determine the cause of crown-of-thorns starfish population increases and their effects on coral reef stability and regeneration, (2) monitoring of areas where the starfish may be increasing and determination of future needs for control, (3) development of improved methods of control and carrying out of such programs where needed, and (4) any other actions desirable to gain an understanding of the ecology and control of the crown-of-thorns starfish. 16 U.S.C. § 1212.\n\nCOTSA authorizes assistance to the governments of “the State of Hawaii, the territories and possessions of the United States, including Guam and American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and other island possessions of the United States.” 16 U.S.C. § 1211. These other island possessions, now called the U.S. Minor Outlying Islands, are Wake Island, Midway Islands, Palmyra Atoll, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Howland Island, Baker Island, and Jarvis Island. See NOAA CoRIS - U.S. Pacific Remote Island Area (PRIA). Since the passage of COTSA, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands has been dissolved, with the Northern Mariana Islands becoming an unincorporated U.S. territory and the Marshall Islands, the Republic of Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia becoming sovereign states under Compacts of Free Association with the United States. See 48 USC Ch. 14: Front Matter. It is unclear whether COTSA still applies to these three Freely Associated States as there is no guidance on this issue. See Compacts of Free Association; 48 USC Ch. 18.\n\nNeither COTSA nor its legislative history identifies its geographic scope or its seaward limit. See, e.g., S. Rept. 91-795 (1970). When enacted in 1970, the United States claimed a three nautical mile (nm) territorial sea around its island territories. Thus, it is reasonable to infer that federal funds may be provided to address crown-of-thorns starfish predation on coral reefs located within this zone. It remains an open question whether COTSA may be interpreted to apply beyond three nm, such as hroughout the 200 nm EEZ proclaimed by the U.S. in 1983. See 1983 U.S. EEZ Proclamation.\n\nSource: NOAA GCIS\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nCrown of Thorns Starfish Act, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1211-1213\n\nCoral Health and Threats in the Pacific Islands | NOAA Fisheries\n\nNOAA Helps American Samoa Tackle a Thorny Issue\n\nDiving for starfish to protect Palmyra's coral reef | U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service (fws.gov)\n\nNOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) Home Page\n\nU.S. Coral Reef Jurisdictions\n\nNOAA CoRIS - Regional Data Portal\n\nU.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Insular Affairs, Definitions of Insular Area Political Organizations\n\nCIA, The World Factbook, United States Pacific Island Wildlife Refuges\n\nLast updated November 2, 2023\n\nDeep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA), 30 U.S.C. §§ 1401-1473 (2002)\n\nThe Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act (DSHMRA), which became law on June 28, 1980, establishes an interim framework for the orderly development of hard mineral resources of the deep seabed, pending agreement on an international regime. 30 U.S.C. § 1401(b); 30 U.S.C § 1441(3). DSHMRA applies to U.S. citizens and vessels, as well as foreign persons and vessels otherwise subject to U.S. jurisdiction, who engage in exploration for and commercial recovery of deep seabed hard mineral resources. 30 U.S.C. § 1402(a)(1). Under DSHMRA, \"deep seabed\" means the area seaward of the United States’ Continental Shelf, as defined under the 1958 Shelf Convention, 30 U.S.C § 1403(2), and seaward of the Continental Shelf or national resource jurisdiction of any other nation. 30 U.S.C. § 1403(4). Although the Act contains a disclaimer of extraterritorial jurisdiction, 30 U.S.C. § 1402(a)(2), it plainly regulates conduct of U.S. citizens and others subject to U.S. jurisdiction when they engage in exploration for and exploitation of deep seabed hard mineral resources in or under the seafloor beyond national jurisdiction. 30 U.S.C. § 1402(a)(1).\n\nDSHMRA also extends Clean Water Act jurisdiction to any discharge of a pollutant from vessels and other floating craft engaged in commercial recovery or exploration under the Act. 30 U.S.C. § 1419(e). Thus, such vessels are subject to Clean Water Act regulation even when on the high seas.

Deepwater ports are located beyond the territorial limits of the United States (generally beyond three nautical miles from the U.S. baseline which is typically the mean low-water mark). 33 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(1) offsite link (see also 33 U.S.C. § 1502(9)(A) offsite link). These activities are regulated through an application and licensing system which is overseen by the Secretary of Transportation through the Maritime Administration (MARAD) in coordination with the U.S. Coast Guard. 33 C.F.R. § 148.3 offsite link. The Secretary of Transportation is required to establish environmental review criteria for the location, construction, and operation of deepwater ports consistent with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). 33 U.S.C § 1505 offsite link. The DWPA authorizes the NOAA Administrator to advise the Department of Transportation on the environmental review criteria for deepwater port applications, the site evaluation and preconstruction testing at potential locations and the designation of \"adjacent coastal state\" status. 33 U.S.C. §§ 1505(a) offsite link, 1508(a)(2) offsite link.\n\nA deepwater port is \"any fixed or floating manmade structure other than a vessel…that [is] used or intended for use as a port or terminal for the transportation, storage, or further handling of oil or natural gas…and for other uses not inconsistent with the purposes of this [statute],” and is located beyond State seaward limits (generally three nautical miles from the baseline, with State specific exceptions in the Gulf of Mexico). 33 U.S.C. § 1502(9) offsite link. Accordingly, U.S. jurisdiction under the DWPA generally begins three nautical miles from the U.S. baseline. The DWPA does not specify a seaward jurisdictional limit but expressly includes ports on the outer continental shelf, which currently extends a maximum of 200nm from the baseline. 33 U.S.C. § 1501(a)(6) offsite link; see also 13 U.S.C. § 1502(9)(a) offsite link (uses consistent with the Act’s purpose include \"transportation of oil or natural gas from the United States outer continental shelf.\"); 33 U.S.C. § 1504(h)(3) offsite link; 33 U.S.C. § 1520 offsite link; 33 C.F.R. § 148.5 offsite link; 49 C.F.R. § 1.53(a)(3) offsite link. The DWPA also references the high seas in that deepwater ports should not \"interfere with international navigation or other reasonable uses of the high seas, as defined by treaty, convention, or customary international law.\" See S. REP. NO. 93-1217 at 7535 (\"However, the freedom of all nations to make reasonable use of waters beyond territorial boundaries is recognized by the International Convention on the High Seas.\").\n\nUnder the DWPA, and subject “to recognized principles of international law,” the U.S. Coast Guard regulates vessel movement around deepwater ports for a variety of purposes, including “to prevent pollution of the marine environment.” 33 U.S.C. § 1509 offsite link. This authority applies to all vessels, both foreign and domestic, “subject to recognized principles of international law.” 33 U.S.C. § 1509 offsite link; 33 U.S.C. § 1518(a)(3) offsite link; 33 U.S.C. § 1502(19) offsite link. The U.S. Coast Guard carries out this authority through regulations and provisions in a licensee’s operations manual, or the establishment of no anchoring areas and areas to be avoided through the International Maritime Organization acting on behalf of the Executive Branch. 33 U.S.C. § 1509(a) offsite link; 33 C.F.R. § 150.915 offsite link. Types of regulation that the U.S. Coast Guard is specifically authorized to implement are navigational safety zones. In developing such zones, the U.S. Coast Guard must consult with the Departments of the Interior, Commerce, State and Defense. 33 U.S.C. § 1509(d)(1) offsite link. In determining the size of navigational safety zones, the U.S. Coast Guard must take into account a number of factors, including: environmental factors, economic impact and effects, and the scope and degree of the risk or hazard involved. 33 C.F.R. § 150.915 offsite link. “Subject to recognized principles of international law,” however, these zones may not exceed 500m around the deepwater port. 33 U.S.C. § 1509(d)(1) offsite link; Law of the Sea Convention, art. 60(5) offsite link.\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nDeepwater Port Act of 1974, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1501-1524 offsite link, as amended\n\n49 CFR § 1.46 (delegating authority under the Deepwater Port Act from the Department of Transportation to USCG)\n\n49 CFR § 1.66 (delegating authority under the Deepwater Port Act from the Department of Transportation to MARAD)\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Delegation Number 0170.1, #75.

See 46 U.S.C. § 2304(a)(2) offsite link. A master or individual violating this section may be fined not more than $1,000, imprisoned for not more than two years, or both. 46 U.S.C. § 2304(b) offsite link. This statute does not apply to a vessel of war (as defined in 46 U.S.C. § 2101(53) offsite link), or to a vessel owned by the United States Government appropriated only to a public service (as defined in 46 U.S.C. § 2101(33) offsite link). However, the master of a U.S. warship or other public vessel may have a duty to render assistance, depending on the circumstances, based on other sources of law.\n\nThe duty imposed by 46 U.S.C. § 2304 applies “at sea.” Black’s Law Dictionary defines “at sea” to mean “out of the limits of any port or harbor on the sea-coast.” Black’s Law Dictionary Free Online Legal Dictionary 2nd Ed., At sea offsite link. Case law indicates that “at sea” encompasses waters from the low-water mark along the coast (the baseline) to waters under U.S. jurisdiction and the high seas. See, e.g., The Schooner Harriet, 1 Story 251, 11 Fed. Cas. 588, 590-91 (C.C.D. Me. 1840) offsite link. A vessel is “at sea” once it leaves a port, regardless of where it goes, and continues until the vessel is back in port. Wood v. New Eng. Marine Ins. Co., 14 Mass. 31, 37 (1817) offsite link.\n\nThe text of 46 U.S.C. § 2304 does not expressly limit its application to U.S. flag vessels or vessels in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. To avoid conflict with international law as required by the Charming Betsy canon, U.S. enforcement of 46 U.S.C. § 2304 should be interpreted as only applying to foreign flag vessels when they are in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. See Murray v. The Charming Betsy, 6 U.S. 64, 118 (1804) offsite link (“It has also been observed that an act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains…”). Accordingly, civil and criminal penalty enforcement of 46 U.S.C. § 2304 applies to individuals within U.S. jurisdiction, U.S. flag vessels wherever located, and to foreign flag vessels only when in the U.S. territorial sea or the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone.\n\nAlthough exempt from the statutory requirement imposed by 46 U.S.C. § 2304, the U.S. Coast Guard is authorized by 14 U.S.C. § 521 offsite link to “perform any and all acts necessary to rescue and aid persons and protect and save property” on the high seas and on waters over which the United States has jurisdiction. See also U.S. Coast Guard Regulations, Section 4-2-5, Assistance (COMDTINST M5000.3B). However, 14 U.S.C. § 521 offsite link “falls short of creating a governmental duty of affirmative action owed to a person or vessel in distress.” Frank v. United States,250 F.2d 178, 180 (3d.

ESA Section 2(b), 16 U.S.C. § 1531(b). NOAA and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the Services) administer the ESA jointly. Generally, NOAA exercises jurisdiction over marine and anadromous species and FWS over terrestrial and freshwater species. ESA Section 4(a)(1), 16 U.S.C. § 1533(a)(1), provides for listing species as endangered or threatened. A species is endangered if it is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range, and threatened if it is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future. ESA Section 3(6), (19), 16 U.S.C. § 1532(6), (19). ESA Section 4(a)(3), 16 U.S.C. § 1533(a)(3), provides that, to the extent prudent and determinable, the Services at the time of listing should designate critical habitat essential to the conservation of the species. The Services’ implementing regulations, 50 CFR § 424.12(h), clarify that critical habitat shall not be designated in foreign countries or areas outside of US jurisdiction.\n\nUnder the ESA, it is unlawful for anyone subject to the jurisdiction of the United States including Federal agencies, to “take” - defined broadly to include “harm” and “harass” as well as “capture” and “kill” - any endangered animal in the U.S., the territorial seas or the high seas, including both U.S. and foreign EEZs. ESA Section 9(a)(1)(B), (C), 16 U.S.C. § 1538(a)(1)(B), (C); 50 CFR § 17.21(c)(1), 17.31. By regulation pursuant to ESA section 4(d), 16 U.S.C. § 1533(d), the Services have extended the prohibition of take to most threatened animal species.\n\nUnder ESA Section 7(a)(2), 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2), Federal agencies also must, in consultation with and with the assistance of the Services, insure that actions they fund, authorize or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or destroy or adversely modify designated critical habitat. If the Services conclude that an agency’s action meets this section 7(a)(2) standard, the Services provide an incidental take statement that exempts the Federal agency from the prohibition against take contained in ESA sections 4(d), 9(a)(1)(B) and (C). ESA Section 7(o)(2), 16 U.S.C. § 1536(o)(2). The Services’ implementing regulations provide that Federal agency actions on the high seas, including in U.S. and foreign EEZs, are subject to ESA section 7. 50 CFR § 402.02.\n\nNon-federal actors can get permits that allow take of species otherwise prohibited by ESA section 9 for scientific research or for the enhancement of propagation or survival. ESA Section 10(a)(1)(A), 16 U.S.C. § 1539(a)(1)(A). Because the prohibitions in ESA section 9(a)(1)(C) extend to the high seas, including U.S. and foreign EEZs, a section 10(a)(1)(A) permit is needed for take in any of these areas.\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nEndangered Species Act of 1973, as amended, 16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq. offsite link\n\n50 CFR Part 402.02 of the Services’ joint ESA Section 7 implementing regulations, and preamble, 51 FR 19926, 19930 (June 3 1986) offsite link: “The Service finds that, because already has jurisdiction under section 9(a)(1)(C) of the Act to regulate taking of a listed fish and wildlife species on the high seas by all persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, concomitant jurisdiction under section 7 is implicit from Congressional concern that compliance with a section 7 incidental take statement not result in a taking violation under section 9(a)(1)(C), as provided in Section 7(o)(2).”\n\n50 CFR §§ 17.21(c)(1) and 17.31, FWS section 9 and section 4(d) implementing regulation: “It is unlawful to take endangered wildlife within the United States, within the territorial sea of the United States, or upon the high seas.

It was codified in 33 U.S.C. § 471. The authority conferred by this statute was transferred to and vested in the Secretary of Homeland Security by section 902(j) of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006. This was later amended, most recently by Section 301 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2010. It authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to define and establish anchorage grounds for vessels in all harbors, rivers, bays, and navigable waters of the United States. The U.S. Coast Guard acting under the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security is charged with enforcement. Any violation of such rules is liable for a penalty of up to $10,000. Each day during which a violation continues constitutes a separate violation.\n\n33 U.S.C. § 472 directs the Commandant of the Coast Guard to provide and maintain suitable markings of anchorage grounds as so defined in § 471. 33 U.S.C. § 474 authorizes the Commandant of the Coast Guard to define and establish anchorage grounds in Saint Marys River. 33 U.S.C. § 475 authorizes the Secretary of the Navy to define and establish anchorage grounds in Pearl Harbor. 33 U.S.C. § 476 specifically restricts tanker traffic in Puget Sound and its adjacent waters.\n\nThe seaward limit of the authority to establish anchorage grounds is coextensive with the outer limit of the territorial sea of the United States. The language of 33 U.S.C. § 471 specifically lists this authority as including “all harbors, rivers, bays, and other navigable waters of the United States” and defines “navigable waters of the United States” to include “all waters of the territorial sea of the United States as described in Presidential Proclamation No. 5928 of December 27, 1988.” Presidential Proclamation No. 5928 defines the territorial sea of the United States as extending “to 12 nautical miles from the baselines of the United States determined in accordance with international law.”\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nSection 7 of the Rivers and Harbors Appropriations Act of 1915 offsite link(33 U.S.C. 471)\n\nSection 902(j) of the Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2006 (Pub.

The phrase “Earth’s oceans” is best construed to indicate that the Act’s substantive provisions relating to research and coordination apply to waters beyond U.S. jurisdiction. The Act directs the Joint Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology of the National Science and Technology Council to coordinate U.S. Federal ocean acidification research and monitoring programs with counterpart “research and monitoring programs and scientists from other nations.” 33 U.S.C. § 3703(b)(4 offsite link) (emphasis added). It requires that Subcommittee to develop a strategic plan that describes specific activities, including “participation in international research efforts” and recommendations for the “coordination of U.S. ocean acidification research and monitoring activities with other nations and international organizations.” 33 U.S.C § 3704(b)(3)(I) & (b)(6) offsite link (emphasis added). Further, actions mandated by the Act include the establishment by the Secretary of Commerce through NOAA of a “long-term monitoring program of ocean acidification utilizing global and national ocean observing assets,” and coordination on ocean acidification monitoring and impacts research “with other appropriate international organizations such as the International Oceanographic Commission, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the north Pacific Marine Science Organization, and others.” 33 U.S.C. § 3705(a)(1)(B) & (F) offsite link (emphasis added). Finally, the Act requires the Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to “encourage coordination of the [the NSF’s and NASA’s] ocean acidification activities with such activities of other nations and international organizations. 33 U.S.C. § 3706(c) offsite link, 33 U.S.C. § 3707(c) offsite link (emphasis added). Thus, the Act contemplates and authorizes research activities primarily in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction, but also includes authorities to cooperate with other nations to do research in waters subject to foreign jurisdiction, as necessary to implement the strategic research plan\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nInteragency Working Group on Ocean Acidification (IWGOA), Strategic Plan for Federal Research and Monitoring of Ocean Acidification (March 2014)\n\nInternational Engagement of the NOAA Ocean Acidification Program\n\nNOAA Ocean Acidification Program Projects\n\nInteragency Working Group on Ocean Acidification\n\nNational Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Ocean Science and Technology, Implementation Of The Strategic Plan For Federal Research And Monitoring Of Ocean Acidification Activities (Dec. 2016)\n\nNational Science and Technology Council, Fourth Report on Federally Funded Ocean Acidification Research and Monitoring Activities (Dec. 2016)\n\nFish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), 16 U.S.C. § 661-667e\n\nCongress enacted the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA), 16 U.S.C. § 661-667e, in 1934 to protect fish and wildlife when Federal actions result in the control or modification of a natural stream or body of water (e.g., water resource development projects). It has been amended a number of times providing mechanisms for assessing impacts to fish and wildlife resources, and methods to protect and improve these resources. The 1958 amendments to the Act require that wildlife conservation be given “equal consideration” and expanded its scope to include any body of water. 16 U.S.C. §§ 661, 662(a).\n\nThe FWCA balances economic development with environmental protection through its mechanisms that evaluate and address impacts of water resource development projects on the Nation’s fish and wildlife resources. 16 U.S.C. § 661. It applies to water projects, or any entity with a Federal permit or license, proposing to control or modify a water body “for any purpose whatever.” It requires consultation with the Department of the Interior’s Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the National Marine Fisheries Service and the appropriate State wildlife agency “with a view to the conservation of fish and wildlife resources in connection with that project.” 16 U.S.C. § 662(a), 666b (wildlife defined to include fish). Project plans are required to include “such justifiable means and measures for wildlife purposes as the reviewing agency finds should be adopted to obtain maximum overall project benefits.” 16 U.S.C. § 662(b). The Act also applies to the effects of domestic sewage, trade wastes, and other pollutants on wildlife, with emphasis on birds, mammals, fish, and shellfish. 16 U.S.C. § 665.\n\nThe FWCA extends seaward as far as the seaward limits of the authorities of Federal agencies required to consult with wildlife agencies under the Act and may reach all waters affected by Federal planning and construction, licensing, or permitting authorities. 16 U.S.C. §662(a); See Fish & Wildlife Service, Water Resources Development Under the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, Chp. I 24-25, Chp. II 1-8 (Nov. 2004) (Fish & Wildlife Service Guidebook).

Feb. 9, 1957, 8 U.S.T. 2283, 314 U.N.T.S. 105. The Fur Seal Convention, a four-party agreement among the United States, the Soviet Union, Canada, and Japan, prohibited pelagic sealing (the hunting of seals at sea) in the North Pacific Ocean. See id. pmbl., art. III. It also substantially limited land sealing in the North Pacific for commercial purposes, and distributed the benefits from commercial land sealing operations among the treaty’s parties. See id. arts. V(2)(d), IX. In addition, the Convention prohibited the importation of sealskins obtained by pelagic sealing in the North Pacific. See id. art. VIII(2). The Fur Seal Convention has since expired, but the Fur Seal Act remains in effect. See 16 U.S.C.A. § 1151 (West, Westlaw through P.L. 113-74).\n\nThe Fur Seal Act’s ban on pelagic sealing applies both “on lands or waters under the jurisdiction of the United States,” 16 U.S.C. § 1152, and in “the waters of the Pacific Ocean north of the thirtieth parallel of north latitude, including the Bering, Okhotsk, and Japan Seas,” id. § 1151(g). To this end, the Act extends the United States’ enforcement jurisdiction extraterritorially. It provides that parties to the Convention, including the United States, may “board and search” a treaty party-flagged ship on the high seas that is “outfitted for the harvesting of living marine resources” if there exists “reasonable cause to believe” that the ship has violated the Convention’s pelagic sealing ban. Id. § 1156(a). The Act further provides that parties to the Convention, including the United States, enjoy enforcement authority with respect to the Convention’s proscription on pelagic sealing within their exclusive economic zones (“EEZs”)—though parties cannot enforce the Convention within other states’ EEZs. See 16 U.S.C. § 1156(a) (prohibiting Fur Seal Convention parties’ enforcement of the pelagic sealing ban “within the areas in which another State exercises fisheries jurisdiction”).\n\nWith the Fur Seal Convention’s expiration in 1984, the United States no longer possesses the authority under international law to conduct extraterritorial inspections of foreign-flagged vessels suspected of pelagic sealing activities, and foreign-flagged vessels’ extraterritorial inspection of U.S. ships suspected of sealing would be similarly unauthorized. The Fur Seal Act’s enabling of the United States’ inspection of U.S.-flagged vessels on the high seas and within the U.S. EEZ likely remains valid, however.\n\nFinally, the Fur Seal Act also reaches extraterritorial pelagic sealing activity by barring the “use [of] any port or harbor or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States for any purpose connected in any way with [pelagic sealing.]” 16 U.S.C. § 1152. It further bars the transport, importation, sale, or possession of “fur seals or the parts thereof” at “any port or place or on any vessel, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States[.]” Id.\n\nAdditional reference information:\n\nThe Fur Seal Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. §§ 1151–59 (2012)\n\nThe Fur Seal Act Amendments of 1983, Pub.

UN General Assembly, A/RES/44/225 offsite link, 1989. The geographic scope of the UN Moratorium and Moratorium Act includes all areas outside coastal States’ EEZs, specifically applying to the high seas.\n\nThe Moratorium Protection Act prohibits the United States from entering into any international agreement with respect to the conservation and management of living marine resources that would prevent the full implementation of the UN Moratorium. Additionally, the Moratorium Protection Act calls upon the United States to secure a permanent ban on the use of destructive fishing practices, in particular large scale driftnets, by persons or vessels fishing beyond the EEZ of any nation. Under the Moratorium Protection Act, the United States may detect, monitor, and prevent violations of the moratorium for all fisheries under the jurisdiction of the United States and, in the case of fisheries not under U.S. jurisdiction, to the fullest extent permitted under international law.\n\nThe Moratorium Protection Act also authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to take actions to improve the effectiveness of international fishery management organizations in conserving and managing fish stocks under their jurisdiction. These actions include urging international and regional fishery management organizations (RFMOs) to which the United States is a member to adopt measures against member or non-member governments whose vessels engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, increasing the use of observers and technologies needed to monitor compliance with conservation and management measures established by the organization, and seeking adoption of stronger port state controls in all nations. Additionally, the Moratorium Protection Act urges international and regional fishery management organizations to which the United States is a member to adopt and expand the use of market-related measures to combat IUU fishing.\n\nIn 2006, the Moratorium Act was amended by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act (2006 MSA) to strengthen international fisheries management organizations and to address IUU fishing and bycatch of protected living marine resources. Notably, the amended Moratorium Act requires the United States to produce a biennial report on the status of international living marine resources shared by the United States or subject to treaties or agreements to which the United States is a party, including a list of all such fish stocks classified as overfished, overexploited, depleted, endangered, or threatened with extinction.\n\nThe Moratorium Protection Act requires NOAA’s National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) to produce a biennial Report to Congress that lists the nations the United States has identified for IUU fishing and/or bycatch of protected living marine resources, or fishing activities on the high seas that target or incidentally catch sharks where the country does not have regulations comparable in effectiveness to those of the United States. If a nation is identified, NMFS enters a two-year consultation process to encourage that nation to take appropriate action to address the issues for which it was identified.
