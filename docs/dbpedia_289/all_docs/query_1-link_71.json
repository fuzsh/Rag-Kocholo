        "text": "Departs: 19:00\n\nTokyo, Japan's bustling capital, offers an eclectic mix of tradition and modernity. Begin your adventure with a visit to the Asakusa district, home to the ancient Senso-ji Temple, Tokyo's oldest and most significant temple. Nearby, Nakamise Street is perfect for souvenir shopping and sampling traditional snacks.\n\nFor a panoramic view of the city, head to the Tokyo Skytree, one of the world's tallest towers. Shibuya Crossing, one of the busiest pedestrian intersections, is a must-see for its sheer scale and energy. To experience tranquility, visit the serene Meiji Shrine, nestled in a lush forest in Shibuya. Don't miss trying Tokyo's renowned sushi at Tsukiji Outer Market or exploring the vibrant Harajuku district for trendy fashion and unique cafes.\n\nArrives: 08:00 Departs: 17:00\n\nNikko, nestled in the mountains of Tochigi Prefecture, Japan, is a place where history, culture, and natural beauty converge spectacularly. Renowned primarily for its ornate shrines and temples, including the UNESCO World Heritage sites of Toshogu Shrine, Futarasan Shrine, and Rinnoji Temple, Nikko offers a profound glimpse into Japan's rich architectural and spiritual heritage. Toshogu, the most lavishly decorated shrine, is famous for its intricate wood carvings, including the renowned \"Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil\" monkeys.\n\nBeyond its cultural treasures, Nikko is also celebrated for its natural scenery. The area is home to the scenic Lake Chuzenji and Kegon Falls, one of Japan's most beautiful waterfalls, especially stunning in autumn when the foliage turns fiery red and gold.\n\nPort:Hitachinaka\n\nHitachinaka, located in Ibaraki Prefecture, Japan, is renowned for its scenic coastal beauty and the sprawling Hitachi Seaside Park. This park is famous for its seasonal flowers, especially the baby blue eyes (Nemophila) that create a stunning blue carpet in spring and the vibrant red kochia bushes in autumn. It offers a spectacular natural display that draws visitors from around the world.\n\nApart from its natural allure, Hitachinaka also boasts of Nakaminato Fish Market, where visitors can enjoy fresh seafood and observe local culinary practices. The city's proximity to the coast encourages activities like cycling along the seaside paths and relaxing on the beaches. Hitachinaka blends its industrial background with considerable green spaces and oceanic influences, providing a refreshing escape with diverse attractions for all ages.\n\nArrives: 07:00 Departs: 15:00\n\nMiyako, located on the eastern coast of Honshu in Iwate Prefecture, Japan, is a city known for its stunning natural beauty and rich cultural heritage. The dramatic coastline of Jodogahama Beach, with its pristine white pebbles and clear blue waters, is a major attraction, offering breathtaking views and a peaceful retreat.\n\nMiyako is also home to the Sanriku Fukko National Park, where visitors can explore the rugged landscape and observe diverse wildlife. The city has a deep connection to its maritime roots, evident in its fresh seafood cuisine, with local delicacies like sea urchin and abalone being particularly popular. The Miyako Fish Market is an excellent place to experience the local flavours and vibrant atmosphere.\n\nArrives: 08:00 Departs: 19:00\n\nHakodate is one of the most popular city destinations in Japan. Here you can experience diverse dynastic architecture, the last Shogun battlefield and enjoy shimmering night views from Mount Hakodate. Located along Hokkaido's southwestern tip, you can immerse yourself in history within the star-shaped walls of Fort Goryokaku and explore the site of famous battles that transformed Japan.\n\nEnjoy a mouth-watering seafood rice bowl (kaisen-don) from the Hakodate Morning Market and then relax with a soak in the Yunokawa hot springs on Hakodate's outskirts.\n\nThe international date line, established in 1884, passes through the mid-Pacific Ocean and roughly follows a 180 degrees longitude north to south line on the Earth. It does zigzag around political borders such as eastern Russia and Alaska’s Aleutian Islands.\n\nCrossing the date line eastbound decreases the date by one day, while crossing the date line westbound increases the date. So when you cross east to west you always lose a day and crossing from west to east you get the same day twice (or gain a day).\n\nArrives: 08:00 Departs: 17:00\n\nWild, remote and stunningly beautiful, the city of Kodiak is a rugged outpost on Alaska's famed \"Emerald Isle\". Accessible only by plane or ship, will find you in a different Alaska - one of extreme wilderness and beauty, populated by hearty, friendly frontier folks.\n\nTake a visit to the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge, home to the famed Kodiak brown bears. A scenic drive to Fort Abercrombie State Historical Park reveals stunning coastal views, World War II bunkers, and lush forest trails. For a cultural experience, explore the Alutiiq Museum and Archaeological Repository, which showcases the island's indigenous heritage. Don't miss the Kodiak Fisheries Research Center, where you can learn about the local fishing industry and marine life.\n\nArrives: 07:00 Departs: 17:00\n\nAnchorage, Alaska’s largest city, offers a captivating mix of natural beauty and urban appeal. Nestled between the Chugach Mountains and Cook Inlet, Anchorage provides stunning vistas and abundant wildlife. Start your day with a visit to the Anchorage Museum, which showcases Alaskan history, art, and culture. A stroll through the Tony Knowles Coastal Trail offers breathtaking views of the coastline and a chance to spot moose or even beluga whales.\n\nFor a taste of local cuisine, head to the bustling Anchorage Market & Festival, where you can sample fresh seafood and unique Alaskan treats. Don't miss the Alaska Native Heritage Center to learn about indigenous cultures through exhibits and performances. Anchorage’s vibrant downtown offers eclectic shops, cozy cafes, and opportunities to explore Alaskan craftsmanship.\n\nPort:Seward\n\nSeward is 120 miles (about a two hour drive) south of Anchorage, and is one of the Anchorage area's two major cruise ports. The trip south is one of the most scenic in Alaska, with the waters of Turnagain Arm on one side and the Chugach Mountains on the other.\n\nThere are many small turnouts along the way that are photo-perfect. The small community of Girdwood is a great spot to take a quick hike or a ride up the aerial tram. Seward itself is a great spot for ziplining, sled dog kennel tours, kayaking and glacier and wildlife day cruises.\n\nOff the coast of Yakutat - 200 miles North West of Juneau - Hubbard is certainly gigantic: it's more than 9km/6mi wide where it meets the ocean. The face is over 100m/350ft tall, and icebergs 3 to 4 stories in height aren’t uncommon.\n\nGranted, most of that ice is below water, but the ice can be so thick that cruise ships can’t get too close. In the right conditions, however, your ship might be able to get within 1km/0.5mi of the face. The strong currents and riptides that flow between Gilbert Point and the face of the glacier cause calving to occur on a daily basis, sending massive chunks of ice crashing into Disenchantment Bay.\n\nBut don't be fooled, Hubbard Glacier stands strong and is advancing so fast its earned the title \"The Galloping Glacier\".\n\nAlaska's Inside Passage offers breathtaking views of glaciers, fjords, and abundant wildlife , making it one of the most scenic cruises in the world and one of the few locations where deep-draft ships can sail close to steep mountain walls. Stretching from Puget Sound in Washington to the Alaskan Panhandle, this coastal route provides stunning natural scenery. Expect to see orcas, humpback whales, and sea lions from the deck, while eagles soar overhead.\n\nMassive tidewater glaciers, forest-clad islands, ice-carved fjords, and charming coastal towns such as Juneau, Ketchikan, Haines and Skagway await you here. On small ship cruises, you’ll visit even more intimate ports of call. Glacier Bay National Park and Hubbard Glacier are highlights.\n\nArrives: 07:00 Departs: 22:00\n\nVancouver is the ideal home port to begin or end an Alaskan adventure. Blessed with stunning vistas and exciting activities, Vancouver offers the perfect blend of urban and natural experiences. Vancouver is a must for any cruise itinerary, and because it's a compact, walkable city right on the edge of nature, adding on just a couple of extra days to explore will give you an authentic taste of what makes this place so attractive to visitors.\n\nLocated in the heart of Vancouver’s waterfront, 'Canada Place' (cruise terminal) can service up to three luxury cruise ships at any given time."
