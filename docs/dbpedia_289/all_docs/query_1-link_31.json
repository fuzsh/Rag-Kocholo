        "text": "In 1919, chewing gum entrepreneur William Wrigley Jr. bought nearly every share of the Santa Catalina Island Company until he owned a controlling interest. He then invested millions in his vision to create a \"playground for all\" on Catalina Island, building infrastructure, a reservoir, Hotel Atwater, Bird Park, and other attractions. In 1921, he made Avalon the Spring Training home of his beloved Chicago Cub’s, building the Catalina Country Club to house the team’s lockers and provide a gathering place for players. The team continued to train on the island until 1951. In 1929, Wrigley built the iconic Catalina Casino, which boasts the world’s largest circular ballroom and the first theatre designed and built to show talking motion pictures. His son Philip Knight Wrigley took over and continued his father’s vision after his passing in 1932. During World War II, the island served as a military training facility and was closed to tourists. The island was a popular spot with Hollywood's elite during the 1930s, 40s, and 50s. It also became a popular location for production companies to shoot movies. More than 500 films, documentaries, commercials, and TV shows have been shot in and around Catalina over the years, especially in Two Harbors on the island's west end. To this day, descendants of William Wrigley Jr. still own the Catalina Island Company and carry on his vision to create a world-class island resort.\n\nTHE SYMBOL OF CATALINA HISTORY AND ROMANCE\n\nThe iconic Catalina Casino has been the focal point of Catalina Island entertainment and culture since it opened on May 29, 1929. For nearly a century, the Casino has been the venue of choice for great entertainers, Broadway productions, and special events. Dominating the Avalon landscape from its regal perch on the edge of Avalon Bay, the Casino exemplifies the style and romance of Catalina Island. It gets its name from the Italian language, where “casino” means a gathering place. There has never been gambling at Catalina Casino. Built under the direction of William Wrigley, Jr., the iconic building was designed by Sumner A. Spaulding and Walter Webber as the first circular building of its time. Restored to its original condition, the Art Deco and Mediterranean Revival building is a stunning reminder of Catalina’s glorious past. The height of the building is equivalent to 12 stories, with Avalon Theatre on the main floor, and a ballroom and promenade on the upper floor. The 20,000 square foot ballroom can accommodate up to 1,500 dancers and is the world’s largest circular ballroom without supporting pillars. The ballroom retains its original romantic style -- a lavish medley of rose-hued walls, an arching, fifty-foot ceiling with five Tiffany-like chandeliers, an elevated stage, raised seating areas around the dance floor, and a vintage, full-service bar in the back.\n\nAvalon Theatre is also an architectural masterpiece, with its soaring murals, domed ceiling, perfect acoustics, and the original pipe organ built by the Page Organ Company of Lima, Ohio. It's one of the last of its kind in the world that's still in operation. The Casino hosts most of Catalina’s major indoor events, including the annual New Year’s Eve Celebration, Fourth of July Celebration, Catalina Island JazzTrax Festival, and Catalina Film Festival. General admission and tours of the Catalina Casino are available daily unless a private event is being held.\n\nCasino Weddings & Events\n\nThe Catalina Casino Ballroom and Avalon Theatre are available year-round for private and corporate events, meetings, weddings and events.\n\nLearn More About Our Wedding venues\n\nLearn More About Our Meeting venues"
