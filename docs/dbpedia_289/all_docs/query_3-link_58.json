        "text": "Waite & Peirce is a specialty store named after the owners of the original tall ship Friendship. Shipping partners Aaron Waite (1742-1830) and Jerathmiel Peirce (1747-1827) conducted business for almost 50 years from Salem and Beverly, Massachusetts. Their ships visited ports around the world, from the West Indies to Canton and Archangel, Russia, to Isle de France in the Indian Ocean."
