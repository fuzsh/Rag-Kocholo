        "text": "Hon. Henry E Haydon\n\nSitka Alaska\n\nDear Sir-\n\nPlease find enclosed report of the Commissioners appointed by His Excellency the Governor of Alaska February 1st 1890 for the purpose of designating what grounds and buildings should be reserved by and for the use of the government of the United States.\n\nAlso a map kindly made for the Commissioners by Mr. Edwin Chamberlain Deputy United States Collection of Customs at this Port. We had no surveyors compass or instruments by which a perfectly correct survey could be made. But the measurements are correct and the boundaries are plainly marked so that no mistakes need be made by any one. The numbers on the map pointout the buildings correctly and the red lines show the boundaries of the reservation.\n\nHoping that this will be satisfactory to His Excellency and beneficial to all the people of Alaska.\n\nI remain\n\nYours Respectfully\n\nJames Sheakley\n\nWrangell March 28 1890\n\n(copy)\n\nHon. Lyman E. Knapp,\n\nGovernor of Alaska\n\nSir:-\n\nThe Commissioners appointed by you on February 1st, 1890, \"to examine and report as to what lands in and about Sitka Alaska should be permanently reserved by the Government for its uses, for public buildings, barracks, parade grounds, parks, wharves, coaling stations or other purposes defining and describing the same and indicating the purposes for which they should be reserved,\" have the honor to make the following report.\n\nWe were confronted at the outset with one difficulty. There is, at this time no land surveyor in Sitka, and we anticipated some trouble in locating such property as we might wish to designate for reservation, but it was agreed between us, at our first meeting, that the \"map of settlement at New Archangel Sitka accompanying a letter from General Lovell H. Rousseau dated December 5th, 1867 with inventories, published in House Executive Document No 125, 40th. Congress 2d. Session, signed by Alexis Pestchouroff Russian Commissioner, and Lovell H. Rousseau, United States Commissioner, copies of which documents, certified by Honorable F.F. Bayard Secretary of the Clerk of the United States District Court here, should be used by us in making reservations and designating the same, and their limits, as far as it was possible to do so. With the aid of these documents we have been able to locate and designate definitely, all of the public buildings, and much of the land described by us in this report, as desirable for reservation.\n\nIt is recommended by the Commissioners that the property designated on the certified Map and inventories as a \"Wharf\", together with the Wharehouse Marked No 1, being on the approach to the said Wharf, be reserved to the Government for its uses, and for the ligitimate uses and privileges of the residents of Sitka generally.\n\nIt is recommended by the Commissioners that the buildings designated on the Map and inventories as No 3 and No 15 be reserved for the following purposes viz; No 3 as a Coal Shed for Naval Vessels: - No 15 as a Store house for Naval supplies during such time as it may be necessary for said Buildings to be so used.\n\nIt is also recommended by the Commissioners that all of the land covered and included in the following description be reserved for a Custom House or such other purpose as may be deemed necessary for the public service viz:\n\nCommencing at a point thirty feet from the North West Corner of Building designated on Map and inventories as No 6 thence along Lincoln Street to low water mark in the Bay; thence following the shore line at low water mark in a South Easterly direction to a point outside of a rocky point running into the Bay; thence in a North Easterly direction to a point at right angles from the place of beginning; thence in a North Westerly direction to the place of beginning on Lincoln Street. Meaning to include with other land, all of these lots designated on the Map by Numbers 2, 3, and 5 and part of lot No. 4.\n\nIt is recommended by the Commissioners that the plot of ground marked No. 20 on the map but more particularly described as follows:-commencing at the Northern corner of that plot of ground, which we hereafted ask shall be reserved as a public Common, and now known as the \"parade ground,\" near the Presbyterian Church and running North 33° East 64,68 feet thence West 35° North 59,73 feet, thence North 39° East 87,79 feet, to a road 26,40 feet wide crossing this and continuing the line (N 39° E.) 59,40 feet; thence East 39° South 104,28 feet, thence South 30° West 46,20 ft to a road 26,40 feet wide, thence on South side of said road East 30° South 86,64 feet, thence South 29° West 111,54 feet, thence West 4° North 150,40 feet to point of starting, for a Marine or Military barracks and garden. Provided, however, that within three years from the date of this report a building shall be erected at the expence of the United States upon said land for the occupation of said Marine or Military force, and if not erected within that time then this reservation if made, to be abandoned and the land to become part of the public domain, subject to entry and purchase as may be provided by any Land Laws then in force in this district.\n\nIt is also recommended by the Commissioners that all of that plat of ground bounded on the North West side of Lincoln Street from Wharehouse designated No. 1 on Map and inventories and along Lincoln Street and the shore line to the Southern Corner of the fence enclosing House designated No 24 on the Map and inventories, thence along the walk in a North Westerly direction fronting Lot No 20, and Government School No. 2, to the North West Corner of Plat designated on the Map and inventories No 18, thence in a South Westerly direction to Water front, most of which is now known as the parade ground hereafter set apart and reserved as a public common.\n\nIt is also recommended by the Commissioners that all that plat of ground designated on Map and inventories as No 103 now occupied in part by United States Government School No 1 be reserved for school purposes. Also for like purposes, that plat of ground described as follows:-beginning at the South East corner of Lot designated on Map and inventories as No 18 in a North East direction to the North West Corner of plat marked \"I\" on Map and inventories, thence in a South East direction to the South West Corner of Said plat marked \"I\", thence in a South Westerly direction to a line of the land asked herein to be reserved as a public common upon which is United States Government School No 2.\n\nIt is also recommended by the Commissioners that the Block House marked \"C\" on Map on inventories by reserved for public services including a space of ground One hundred feet square surrounding the same.\n\nAlso the Block House marked \"D\" on said Map and inventories including a space of land described as follows: beginning at a point on the North West corner of the street running East and West from the House now occupied by the Governor Cemetery, thence North 50° West 660 feet West 36° South 363 feet, to be reserved for public buildings for the civil service.\n\nIt is also recommended by the Commissioners that the land upon which were situated the buildings designated on the Map as Nos. 116, 117 and 118 and more particularly described as follows: to wit: Commencing at a point 28 feet from the North West Corner of the main building situated on American St. now occupied by Rueben Albertson as a Hotel and running thence in a Northerly direction 123 feet to the line of a street or road, thence along said street or road 224 feet in an Easterly direction to certain fence posts, thence South Easterly 109 feet to the line of an old fence, thence in a Westerly direction 197 feet to the place of beginning, to be reserved for a Governors House or such other occupancy as may be deemed best by the general Government.\n\nAlso ten acres of land including that now designated on the plat of land as surveyed and claimed by Rev. Sheldon Jackson for the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions as the same appears of record in the office of the Recorder Ex Officio for this district, and marked \"Military Cemetery\", and more particularly described as follows: to wit: beginning at Corner marked No VIII on said plat, running North Westerly 660 feet, thence North Easterly 660 feet containing ten acres more or less, to be reserved for a Military and Naval Cemetery.\n\nIn connection with this reservation we would recommend that the road leading to said cemetery from Lincoln Street be made straight at a continuous width of 50 feet from the fence forming the Western line of the lands enclosed by the Presbyterian Mission.\n\nWe would also recommend for reservation as a public park all that plat of ground, bounded on the West by the line as established by the survey made for the Presbyterian Mission, as above referred to, and along the shore line of the Bay at low tide to the mouth of the Indian River, and across the mouth of said River, along its right bank for an average width of 500 feet along said bank, to the point known as Indian River Falls: and also on the left bank of said river from said falls; an average width of 200 feet from said falls to the Eastern line or boundry as shown on the Mission plat.\n\nAlso all of that stream of water, running into Jamestown Bay on the South side thereof, on Baranoff Island now used for watering purposes by the United States Navy, and Mercantile Vessels:-and that 250 feet on each side of said stream be reserved for a wharf, and such other purposes as may be necessary for the Naval and Marine of the United States, and that this reservation be so made that the water, of said stream, nor any part thereof shall be directed from its original channel for any private enterprise.\n\nWe would also recommend that all of that Island situated directly opposite the town of Sitka, known as \"Japonsky\" Island be reserved for Naval and Military purposes. This Island on account of its location, the depth of water surrounding it, and its other natural advantages, is peculiarly adapted for Government uses.\n\nIn connection with this recommendation, we would suggest, that any party who now has permanent improvements upon the Island, be remunerated for any loss sustained by reason of its being reserved and occupied for the purpose above set forth, such remuneration to be estimated upon the apparent value of such improvements as the same may appear at the date of this report. Your Commissioners believe that at this time the maximum value of such improvements do not exceed One thousand Dollars.\n\nWe have the honor to be with great respect.\n\nYour obt. servants\n\nHenry E. Haydon\n\nO.W. Farenholt U.S. Navy\n\nJohn G. Brady\n\nCommissioners\n\nSitka Alaska\n\nMarch 31, 1890.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR.\n\nWASHINGTON. J.B. McN.\n\n3721-1890.\n\nThe President:\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to transmit herewith a communication from the Governor of Alaska, dated April 2, 1890, enclosing the several reports of commissioners appointed by him to examine and report as to what lands in and about Sitka, Juneau, Douglas Island, and Fort Wrangel should be permanently reserved by the government for its uses for public buildings, barracks, parade grounds, parks, wharves, coaling stations, etc., and recommending that the reservations therein reported upon be made. These reports were made in accordance with the suggestion from this Department, that it be ascertained what tracts are needed by the government and for what purposes, and that the Governor communicate his views to the need of the department having control of the matters for which the proposed reservation is to be made, in view of the possibility that Congress may at the present session extend the public land laws over Alaska.\n\nI approve of the recommendations of the Governor with three exceptions. He recommends that Lots 1,2,3,7 and 8 in Block 7, Juneau, and all of Block \"C\" in said town, be set aside for garrison purposes; but it is stated by the commissioners that these tracts were declared by the district court for the district of Alaska, to have been reserved for garrison purposes by the Navy Department. If this be true it will not be necessary to declare a further reservation of these tracts. But it appears that there are certain settlers on these tracts, and the commissioners recommend that they be paid for their improvements placed thereon in good faith. In this connection I call attention to the \"Act providing a civil government for Alaska,\" (25 Stats., 24) which provides in section eight that Indians or other persons in said Territory \"shall not be disturbed in the possession of any lands actually in their use or occupation or now claimed by them but the terms under which such persons may acquire title to such lands is reserved for future legislation by Congress.\" This enactment would seem to debar the Executive from taking any action calculated to disturb any such settlers, and, if the tracts had not been reserved for naval purposes, would furnish sufficient reason for disapproving this recommendation of the Governor.\n\nThe Governor recommends that Lots 7 and 8, in Block 9, as per plat of G.C. Hanus, Juneau, be reserved for courthouse and jail purposes, and that a certain unnumbered block on the north side of Douglas City be reserved for like purposes. As it appears these tracts are in possession of settlers the recommendation is disapproved. He recommends that certain tracts in Sitka be reserved for a marine or military barracks, on condition that the United States shall erect certain buildings thereon. This reservation I suggest be made without condition. The reservation for a military cemetery, as recommended by the Governor, seems to be \"claimed\" for the Presbyterian Board of Home Missions. The nature of the claim is not stated. However as Congress has provided in said act of May 17, 1884, supra, that land in said Territory occupied as a missionary station shall be continued in such occupancy, to the extent of 160 acres for each such station, until further action by Congress, I am of opinion this reservation should be declared, subject to the rights of said Board of Home Missions therein.\n\nI therefore recommend that the following described tracts of land be reserved from settlement and disposal and set apart for the purposes hereinafter mentioned:\n\nJuneau and Douglas City.\n\n---------oooooo---------\n\nIn the town of Juneau, all that tract or block numbered 23, as per plat of said town made by G.C. Hanus, except Lots 5 and 6, for public school purposes; the island, called Juneau Island, situated in Gastineaux Channel, opposite the town of Douglas City, as a coaling station and government wharf; the unnumbered block on the north side of the town of Douglas City, upon which is situated the public school building, for public school purposes.\n\nFort Wrangel.\n\nIn the town of Fort Wrangel, a tract of land, containing about four acres, upon which are the buildings now occupied by the civil government, and embraced in the following description: Beginning on the south side of Main street, at the northwest corner of the warehouse occupied by Sylvester and Reid; thence in a northwesterly direction by lands occupied by Rufus Sylvester, two hundred and ten feet to a post in picket fence; thence in a northeasterly direction along said picket fence, old Stockade Block House and lands occupied by Rufus Sylvester, two hundred and fourteen feet to a post; thence in a northwesterly direction at a right angle with aforesaid line by lands of the United States, two hundred and forty feet to a post; thence in a southwesterly direction and parallel with the northwest wall of the old Fort and forty feet distant from said wall by lands of the United States, five hundred and fifty feet to low tide water-mark; thence along low tide water-mark in a southeasterly/direction by the sea, four hundred and fifty feet, to the south side of Main street; thence along south side of Main street to place of beginning.\n\nSitka.\n\nThe following tracts in the town of Sitka, designated by numbers hereinafter referred to as they appear on the map of the settlement at New Archangel, Sitka, accompanying a letter from General Lovell H. Rousseau, Commissioner for the United States, and Alexis Pestchouroff, Commissioner for Russia, published in House Executive Document No.125, 40th Cong., 2nd Session, to wit:\n\nThe property designated as a \"Wharf,\" together with the Warehouse marked No.1, situated on the approach to said wharf, for the legitimate uses and purposes of the public.\n\nAlso that tract of land described as follows: Commencing at a point thirty feet from the northwest corner of Building designated on map and inventories as No. 6, thence along Lincoln street to low water-mark in the Bay; thence following the shore line up low water-mark in a southeasterly direction to a point outside of a rocky point running into the Bay; thence in a northeasterly direction to a point at right angles from the place of beginning; thence in a northwesterly direction to the place of beginning on Lincoln street, meaning to include with other land all of those lots designated on the map by numbers 2,3, and 5, and part of lot number 4, for a custom house, and other uses in the collection of customs.\n\nAlso the plot of ground marked No. 20 on the map but more particularly described as follows: Commencing at the northern corner of that plat of ground which we hereafter ask shall be reserved as a public common, and now known as the \"parade ground,\" near the Presbyterian Church, and running North 33° East 64.68 feet, thence west 35° north 59.73 feet, thence north 39° east 87.79 feet, to a road 26.40 feet wide, crossing this and continuing the line (north 39° east) 59.40 feet; thence east 39° south 104.28 feet, thence south 30° west 46.20 feet to a road 26.40 feet wide, thence on south side of said road east 30° south 86.46 feet, thence south 29° west 111.54 feet thence west 4° north 150.40 feet to point of starting, for a marine or military barracks and garden.\n\nAlso all of that plot of ground bounded on the north west side by Lincoln street from Warehouse designated No.1 on map and inventories and along Lincoln street and the shore line to the southern corner of the fence enclosing House designated No.24 on the map and inventories; thence along the walk in a northwesterly direction fronting Lot No.20, and Government school No. 2, to the northwest corner of plot designated on map and inventories No. 18; thence in a southwester1y direction to Water front, most of which is now known as the parade ground, for a public common.\n\nAlso that plot of ground designated on said map as number 103, now occupied in part by government school number 1, and the plot of ground described as follows: beginning at the southeast corner of Lot designated on map and inventories as No.18, in a northeast direction to the northwest corner of plot marked \"I\" on map and inventories; thence in a south- east direction to the southwest corner of said plot marked \"I\"; thence in a southwesterly direction to line of the land herein to be reserved as a public common, for school purposes.\n\nAlso the Block House marked \"C\" on map and inventories, for public services, including a space of ground one hundred feet square surrounding the same.\n\nAlso the Block House marked \"D\" on said map and inventories, including a space of land described as follows: beginning at a point on the northwest corner of the street running east and west from the House now occupied by the Governor and tho road loading north from said street to the Russian Cemetery; thence north 50° west 660 feet west 36° south 363 feet, south 50° east 660 feet, east 36° north 363 feet, for public buildings for the civil service.\n\nAlso the land upon which were situated the buildings designated on the map as Nos. 116,117, and 118, and more particularly described as follows, to wit: Commencing at a point twenty-eight feet from the northwest corner of the main building, situated on American street, now occupied by Rueben Albertstone as a Hotel, and running thence in a northerly direction one hundred and twenty-three feet to the line of a street or road; thence along said street or road two hundred and twenty-four feet in an easterly direction to certain fence posts; thence southeasterly one hundred and nine feet to the line of an old fence; thence in a westerly direction one hundred and ninety-seven feet to the place of beginning, for a Governor's House, or such other occupancy as may be deemed best by the general government.\n\nAlso ten acres of land, including that now designated on the plat of land as surveyed and claimed by Rev.
