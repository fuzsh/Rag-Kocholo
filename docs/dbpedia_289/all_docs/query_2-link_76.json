        "text": "Accessibility at Five Bank Street\n\nThe EBRD headquarters at Five Bank Street can be reached on foot by the marked pedestrian routes. Access to our main reception on Bank Street is step-free.\n\nThe recommended taxi drop off point is at 25 Bank Street, by Heron Quays DLR station.\n\nThe closest step-free public transport option is Heron Quays DLR Station. (visit the TFL website for more information).\n\nWhere we are\n\nThe EBRD's headquarters is at Five Bank Street in the vibrant Canary Wharf business district. Five Bank Street is a 26-storey building and the EBRD occupies the top 13 floors, with the lower storeys being leased to Société Générale.\n\nCanary Wharf is one of the United Kingdom’s two international financial centres, alongside the City of London. It is also a thriving urban space, offering a wealth of residential, commercial, lifestyle and retail facilities, with world-class infrastructure.\n\nThere is a daily working population of 120,000, with 150 major office tenants. The estate has more than 300 shops, bars and restaurants, and 20 acres of outdoor space.\n\nBackground\n\nThe EBRD relocated its headquarters to Canary Wharf in 2022, due to the expiration of the lease on its One Exchange Square building in the City of London in December 2022.\n\nStaying at One Exchange Square, where the Bank had been based since 1993, would have required the building to undergo extensive refurbishment, causing prolonged disruption to the Bank’s staff and operations. Following an extensive due diligence process, Five Bank Street was selected as the Bank’s preferred Headquarters location for the future. It is a world-class building, which provides the best facilities and working conditions for the EBRD staff and reflects the Bank’s commitment to sustainability. It also reinforces the Bank’s commitment to London."
