This will include an audit of Louisville’s creative economy and an update to the Public Art Master Plan. The Office of Arts + Creative Industries will be working closely with Designing Local over the next year to engage the Louisville community in establishing a strategic roadmap for arts and culture initiatives across the city for the next ten years.\n\n“The Office of Arts + Creative Industries is excited to undertake this important work on behalf of the city. But it is essential that it be done in collaboration with residents, artists, and cultural practitioners which is why it was critical to find the right consultant to partner with us in facilitating this process,” said Jessica Bennett Kincaid, Arts + Creative Industries Director.\n\nDesigning Local is an award-winning firm who has worked with communities across the country. Members of the team are in Louisville this week to get further acquainted with Louisville’s art scene and begin identifying stakeholders. The firm’s design for the future Cultural Plan will be informed by local research, community input and national benchmarks. The planning process will take a closer look at the role the creative sector plays in our city’s overall economy, which includes non-profit and private sector employment data, salaries, sales, and tax revenue impact.\n\nTo encourage vibrant dialogue around arts and culture, residents can fill out this form to make sure their voice is heard. The firm will facilitate at least two community meetings to guide the crafting of a plan that reflects Louisville’s voice and values. The Office of Arts + Creative industries will announce when the first meeting will be scheduled.\n\nThe Office of Arts + Creative Industries also noted that Louisville Metro has updated the External Agency Fund grant program which will provide more support for the arts and culture community. Bennett Kincaid announced that her office will be accepting applications for $125,000 in grant funds available to local arts and culture non-profits.

Established in downtown Louisville, St. Joe’s was created to care for children whose families experienced hardships like typhoid, cholera, and challenging work conditions in the mid 1800’s. Since then, St. Joe’s has remained steadfast in its mission to support children in need.\n\n“St. Joseph Children’s Home has always been for the kids,” said Suzy Hillebrand, Chief Advancement Officer. “We stand on a rich 175-year history of serving Kentucky children and families through our programs and will continue to do so until every child has a safe home and a bright future in our diverse community.”\n\nSt. Joe’s serves approximately 300 children each month through these programs, and since its inception, has cared for over 75,000 children. To commemorate this milestone, St. Joe’s will host its 175th Picnic on August 9th and 10th. The community is invited to attend and celebrate the legacy and future of St. Joe’s.
