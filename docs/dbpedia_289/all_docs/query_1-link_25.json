        "text": "The Elting Fingerpost was designed and constructed by Alan Stout along with help from many friends and colleagues. Mark Koenig routed the lettering using his CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machine. Dave Caccamo designed and fabricated the copper finial element.\n\nOthers deserving particular thanks include: Paul Edlund, Ron Fields, Gene Vidal, and Nick Driano. Also, Gillian Murphy, former director of the Elting Library, and the Board for their collective support.\n\nThe narrative describing each fingerpost location was the work of a local team who used the best tools available including Google, Wikipedia, britannica.com, scholarly research methods, personal knowledge, whimsical notions, ChatGPT, and Bing AI. The rigorous criteria for writing a narrative were constructed using ChatGPT. The criteria limited the number of words for a narrative while those writers suffering writer's block were offered comfort and soothing mantras. All succeeded. Thank you all!\n\nContributors to the narrative include: Anne Conger, Tom Rocco, Robert Miller, Sue Books, Paul Edlund, Carol Johnson, Alan Stout, Rachelle Gibson, Ron Fields, Hilary Cloos, Jason Warren, and Laurie Hlavaty."
