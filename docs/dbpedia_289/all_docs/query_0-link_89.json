The registration payment deadline will serve as the date for subsequent annual renewals of registration each year the Commercial Storefront remains Vacant or Abandoned (âannual renewal dateâ). The annual registration fee shall be paid on or before the annual renewal date. However, if the owner rents the Commercial Storefront to a tenant who occupies the premises in a manner that complies with all provisions of state and local law prior to the registration payment deadline, the Commercial Storefront shall be removed from the Departmentâs registry and the owner shall be refunded up to half of the registration fee based on any remaining days before the Commercial Storefrontâs annual renewal date.

The Department shall issue a Notice of Violation (âNOVâ) pursuant to Section 102A.4 of this Code to owners that fail to register within the period of time specified in the notice. See Section 110A, Table 1A-K, Failure to register vacant commercial storefront, for the applicable penalty.\n\n103A.5.6 Sign posting, maintenance, security, and insurance. All requirements listed in Sections 103A.4.4-103A.4.6 of this Code shall also apply to Vacant or Abandoned Commercial Storefronts.

When a building inspector issues a Notice of Violation in which there is an instance of:\n\nÂ Â Â (1)Â Â Â Misrepresentation of existing conditions or project scope that results in circumvention of notification or review requirements;\n\nÂ Â Â (2)Â Â Â Structural work or demolition of structural features without or beyond the scope of a building permit;\n\nÂ Â Â (3)Â Â Â Work under permit performed by a party without required license; or\n\nÂ Â Â (4)Â Â Â Other substantial non-compliance;\n\nInspection Services Division shall log the violation and identify all individuals, agents, and other entities associated with the permit and/or project in the Permit Tracking System or known to be associated with the permit and/or project at the time the Notice of Violation is issued in the Compliance Control Tracking File maintained by the Inspection Services Division. The Compliance Control Tracking File is for internal purposes only; an individual, agent, or entityâs presence in the file does not indicate responsibility for any violation or misconduct.\n\n103A.6.2 Candidates for Expanded Compliance Control.\n\nÂ Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Inspection Services Division shall review the Compliance Control Tracking File on a monthly basis to determine if any project, individual, agent, or entity has been associated with three or more reported violations described in 103A.6.1 within the last 18 months. Any such project, individual, agent, or entity shall be a candidate for Expanded Compliance Control.\n\nÂ Â Â (2)Â Â Â Even if the three-or-more-violations standard is not met during the 18-month period, the Department, in consultation with the City Attorney, may designate a project, individual, agent, or entity as a candidate for Expanded Compliance Control for any violation or violations that the Department determines, individually or together, to be egregious and create significant risk to health, safety, or property.\n\n103A.6.3 Expanded Compliance Control List.\n\n103A.6.3.1 Factors. In determining whether to include any candidate on the Expanded Compliance Control List, the following factors shall be considered: the candidateâs role and conduct that contributed to the violations; any impacts on individual or public health, and safety; whether the misrepresentation of existing conditions or the misrepresentation of project scope was reckless or intentional to avoid permit review or notification requirements; the extent of the demolition or work that occurred without or beyond the scope of a building permit or without the necessary license or certification; any impacts on historically significant structures; prospective undervaluation of the construction cost that resulted in lower permit fees from the violations; and the number, frequency, and severity of violations.\n\n103A.6.3.2 Process. For each project, individual, agent, or entity designated as a candidate for Expanded Compliance Control, the following actions shall be taken:\n\nÂ Â Â (1)Â Â Â Inspection Services staff, designated by the Director of the Department of Building Inspection, shall notify the candidate and request any exculpatory information as to why Expanded Compliance Control is not warranted and shall draft a summary report detailing the violation(s) and exculpatory evidence or arguments, if any, relevant to whether the candidate warrants Expanded Compliance Control.\n\nÂ Â Â (2)Â Â Â The summary report shall conclude with a determination:\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â that the candidate should be placed on the Expanded Compliance Control List, and provide written findings, including but not limited to findings in response to the factors described in 103A.6.3.1, supporting that determination; or\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â that the candidate should not be placed on the Expanded Compliance Control List, and provide written findings, including but not limited to findings in response to the factors described in 103A.6.3.1, for why the candidate does not warrant Expanded Compliance Control.\n\nÂ Â Â (3)Â Â Â The Director of the Department of Building Inspection shall review all Expanded Compliance Control determinations made by designated staff and shall make a final determination either affirming or overruling the determination. The Director shall either adopt the staff findings or issue the Directorâs own written findings detailing the basis for the final determination. The Department shall notify the candidate in writing of the Directorâs final determination and shall post the final determination on the Departmentâs website in a manner that complies with section 104A.6.\n\nÂ Â Â (4)Â Â Â Any person may appeal the Directorâs final determination to the Building Inspection Commission pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 77 of the Administrative Code.\n\nÂ Â Â (5)Â Â Â The Director shall maintain the Expanded Compliance Control List on the Departmentâs website and shall provide the list to the Building Inspection Commission on a quarterly basis commencing when the first project, individual, agent, or entity is placed on the list.\n\n103A.6.4 Expanded Compliance Control Provisions.\n\n103A.6.4.1 Duration. Any project, individual, agent, or entity placed on the Expanded Compliance Control List (âlisteeâ) shall remain on the list for five years. Any subsequent significant violation(s), as defined in subsection 103A.6.1, by a listee shall extend the period of Expanded Compliance Control for that listee by five years from the date of the subsequent violation(s).\n\n103A.6.4.2 Measures.
