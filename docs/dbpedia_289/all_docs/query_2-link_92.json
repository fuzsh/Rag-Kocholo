        "text": "New locations will include duty-free, news and convenience, specialty retail, and automated vending\n\nOakland, Calif. – August 7, 2024: Last month, San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport (OAK) kicked off construction on the first of 16 new retail storefronts that will be added at the airport. Under the airport’s new retail program approved by the Oakland Board of Port Commissioners in January of 2024, the new units will offer news and convenience stores, specialty retail, duty-free, and automated vending concessions. The first unit to enter construction is East Bay Trails, operated by Paradies Lagardere @ OAK, LLC, located across from Gate 29 in Terminal 2.\n\n“We are very excited to be kicking off construction for OAK’s new retail program,” says Craig Simon, Director of Aviation at the Port of Oakland. “The new storefronts will celebrate Oakland culture and pride and East Bay businesses while providing convenient options for travelers looking to shop at OAK.”\n\nThe retail program will focus on designs, concepts, and locally curated merchandise to bring Oakland and the East Bay into the airport. Primary retail concessionaires include HG OAK Retail Concessionaires JV, Paradies Lagardere @ OAK, LLC, and MRG Oakland, LLC. All three retailers are committed to devoting a portion of their news and convenience units, in addition to the two largest anchor locations, for local merchandise. Each retailer has also entered joint venture partnerships with designated Airport Concessions Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (ACDBE) organizations including Oaklandish, Silver Dragon Café, JR Lester & Associates, Maj Collection and Arandia Designs.\n\nAdditionally, work from local artists will be featured in several of the new storefronts. Art will represent the cultural diversity and allure of Oakland and the East Bay. Passengers can expect more large-scale murals from local artists in the retail spaces, similar to those installed at the airport’s 12 new restaurants and bars under its new Food & Beverage Program.\n\nAbout San Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport\n\nSan Francisco Bay Oakland International Airport (OAK) is the main airport for the greater East Bay, the most populated area in the metropolitan San Francisco Bay area.
