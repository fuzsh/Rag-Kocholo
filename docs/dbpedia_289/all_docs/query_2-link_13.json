        "text": "Re: Atlantic Wharf (formerly Russia Wharf)\n\n?All the finishes will be identical, so it will read like one large, continuous property,?? Cantalupa said. ?It?s going to be great space for the public.?\"\n\nThe public loves large footprints so much that even the impression of it being one large footprint will ingratiate them to this development for centuries.\n\nThe area was named Russia Wharf because it primarily traded with the port of St. Petersburg, Russia, in the 1800s; Boston Properties is renaming it Atlantic Wharf.\n\nThe public will also no doubt be grateful for the elminitation of this profoundly confusing name. The wharf is nowhere near Russia, but is, as the renaming makes very clear, quite proximiate to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nRe: Atlantic Wharf (formerly Russia Wharf)\n\nGreat pics Jass.\n\nI really like the IC, but I hate seeing all those flat un-used portions of the roof. The Russia Wharf article is talking about their inovative (yes we do it all the time, and it's called a rainwater harvest system) \"harvesting rain\" system, and right next door is the IC with their black rubber membrane roofs doing nothing to make the project more energy efficient. Those flat portions just scream that they should be vegetated roofs with resident or renter access. Hell, and upper level restaurant with exterior seating, or an extension of a meeting room/ball room.\n\nNope just wasted space.\n\nRe: Atlantic Wharf (formerly Russia Wharf)\n\nGreat pics Jass.\n\nI really like the IC, but I hate seeing all those flat un-used portions of the roof.

That is alot of smog to be around in a small concentrated area. I think NED would die actually.\n\nRe: Atlantic Wharf (formerly Russia Wharf)\n\nIf you look at the pictures on the 'Hancock of the Day' thread you will see many, many more from the Hancock roof. I am working on the marketing of the property and was up there along with a real photographer. These posts are just my dinky little point-and-click."
