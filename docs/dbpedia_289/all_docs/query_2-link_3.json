Depth: 165'\n\nProject Description:\n\nThe City of Boston required that the seven story brick faÃ§ade of the original buildings constructed at this site in 1897 be saved and incorporated into this new 33 story mixed use high rise structure along Boston's historic Fort Point Channel waterfront. The perimeter slurry wall foundation was installed within inches of the braced faÃ§ade and actually crossed under the faÃ§ade return walls at several locations. Structural columns, 107' in length and weighing up to 55 tons, were shipped and installed in one piece in the drilled shafts, as part of the top down construction system chosen for this project."
