Hint: it's a suspension bridge painted an International Orange color.) After all, we're the city that first launched cars pulled along by cables running beneath the street.\n\nInvented here nearly 150 years ago and named a National Historic Landmark in 1964, today's San Francisco cable cars are kept in tip-top shape by our agency.\n\nPlease join us to celebrate the Cable Car return with our professional and experienced operators, mechanics and carpenters.\n\nRiding Cable Cars\n\nIt's easy to find and board a cable car. Choose from three cable car lines - two start at Powell and Market and continue to the Fisherman's Wharf area; one starts at California and Market and continues to Van Ness Avenue. Board at the cable car turntables (the beginning or end of each route) or look for the brown-and-white cable car sign post.\n\nFind maps and schedules below or download MuniMobile® to plan your trip:\n\nCalifornia Cable Car\n\nPowell/Hyde Cable Car\n\nPowell/Mason Cable Car\n\nBuying Tickets\n\nTo avoid long lines, prepay utilizing MuniMobile® or Clipper® Card\n\nTo board cable cars at Powell & Market, Bay & Taylor and Hyde & Beach Streets, you must purchase your fare in advance (applies 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily).\n\nPricing details for cable car single trips can be found here. For all-day travel, you may want to purchase a visitor Passport.\n\nOther payment options:\n\nMuniMobile®: The SFMTA’s official ticketing app, MuniMobile lets you buy tickets instantly through a credit/debit card, PayPal account, Apple Pay or Google Pay.\n\nClipper® Card: Clipper is the all-in-one transit card for the Bay Area. Use your Clipper card on all major Bay Area transit systems, including Muni.\n\nCash: Exact change is required.\n\nPlease visit our Fares page for all cable car ticket details.\n\nCable Car Tips\n\nOur city’s busy streets and steep hills can make for an exciting ride. Hold on tight. If you're holding onto the special poles on the outside of the car as you stand, please don't lean outward.\n\nWhen exiting, wait until the vehicle comes to a complete stop. Then check the street nearby as you step out. Stop, look and listen carefully before crossing cable car intersections. Please remember that the green \"X\" traffic signal is the “go ahead” signal for cable cars, not pedestrians.\n\nFull-size bicycles and folding bikes are not permitted aboard cable cars. Check out other Muni routes if you're traveling with your bike.\n\nService animals are encouraged to ride in the interior section of the cable car, either on their owner's lap or as far out of the aisle as possible. If riding on the exterior sections of the cable car, service animals must be on their owner's lap.\n\nCable cars are not equipped with accessible boarding.\n\nQuestions? Our cable car grip operators and conductors are there to help. You can also Tweet us @sfmta_muni. Or contact the San Francisco Customer Service Center, dial 311 (outside San Francisco, call 415.701.2311).\n\nHistory of the Cable Car"
