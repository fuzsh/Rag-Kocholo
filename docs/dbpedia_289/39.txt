Atlantic Wharf (formerly Russia Wharf) combines residential, retail, and office space in one Fort Point Channel location. The project involved integrating three historic, low-rise buildings with a new mixed-use office tower. With this design, the project team brings modern function while maintaining the wharfâ€™s late 1800s streetscape. SGH consulted on the building enclosure design for the new buildings and restoration of the historic facades.

The project team incorporated the three existing buildings into the new development by razing the interior, structurally supporting the historic facades, and constructing the new building within the original footprint. Positioning a low-rise wing behind the historic buildings helped to preserve the street view while accommodating contemporary retail and office needs.

SGH consulted on the building enclosure design. Highlights of our work include the following:

Assisting with the design and system selection for the skylights, roofing, and waterproofing for the new building and plaza

Consulted on waterproofing for the slurry wall foundations that extended to six parking levels below grade

Assessing the condition of the historic facades and windows, and recommending masonry repair and rehabilitation strategies

Developing details to integrate the various enclosure systems, including transitions between the existing facades and new construction, and around exposed structural elements that intersect with the wall cladding

Providing construction administration services, including reviewing contractor submittals, observing ongoing construction to compare with the design intent, helping the contractor address field conditions, and conducting air/water infiltration testing
