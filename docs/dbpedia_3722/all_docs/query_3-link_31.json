        "text": "About the Book\n\nAdam Kotsko makes the case for the continued relevance of Christian theology for contemporary intellectual life, demonstrating its vibrancy as a creative and constructive pursuit outside the church, rethinking its often rivalrous relationship with philosophy, and tracing the theological roots of modern models of governance and racial oppression.\n\nBook Synopsis\n\nAdam Kotsko makes the case for the continued relevance of Christian theology for contemporary intellectual life, demonstrating its vibrancy as a creative and constructive pursuit outside the church, rethinking its often rivalrous relationship with philosophy, and tracing the theological roots of modern models of governance and racial oppression.\n\nFrom the Back Cover\n\n\"Kotsko's dynamic work restores to us a theology that is human, humane: something alive to the fractures in our ailing collectivities, and aspiring toward new ones.\"--Peter Coviello, author of Make Yourselves Gods: Mormons and the Unfinished Business of American Secularism\n\n\"Without subsuming theology within politics, Kotsko creatively demonstrates the importance of theology for political concerns.\"--Elaine Padilla, University of La Verne The secular world may have thought it was done with theology, but theology was not done with it. Recent decades have seen a resurgence of religion on the social and political scene, which have driven thinkers across many disciplines to grapple with the Christian theological inheritance of the modern world. Adam Kotsko provides a unique guide to this fraught terrain. What Is Theology? makes the case for the continued relevance of Christian theology for contemporary intellectual life, demonstrating its vibrancy as a creative and constructive pursuit outside the church, rethinking its often rivalrous relationship with philosophy, and tracing the theological roots of modern models of governance and racial oppression. Kotsko's book ultimately shows that theology is not a scholarly game or an edifying spiritual discipline, but a world-shaping force of great power. Lives are at stake when we do theology--and if we don't do it, someone else will. Adam Kotsko teaches in the Shimer Great Books School at North Central College. His most recent books are Agamben's Philosophical Trajectory and Neoliberalism's Demons: On the Political Theology of Late Capital.\n\nReview Quotes\n\n\"How do questions of ultimacy--the familiar terrain of theology--collide with the sublunary world of striving and sorrow, of exploitation and fugitive solidarity, we have no choice but to inhabit? And how might the practices of theology and of philosophy hold space together, as both are energized by the rigor of historically-minded critique? These are the questions at the heart of Adam Kotsko's dynamic volume What Is Theology? In its deft readings and expansive erudition, it reaches toward counterpossibilities to the racist orders of a Christianized modernity. Kotsko restores to view a theology that is human, humane: something alive to the fractures in our ailing collectivities, and aspiring toward new ones.\"---Peter Coviello, author of Make Yourselves Gods: Mormons and the Unfinished Business of American Secularism\n\n\"Without subsuming theology within politics, Kotsko creatively demonstrates the importance of theology for political concerns.\"---Elaine Padilla, University of La Verne\n\nAbout the Author\n\nAdam Kotsko teaches in the Shimer Great Books School at North Central College. His most recent books are Agamben's Philosophical Trajectory and Neoliberalism's Demons: On the Political Theology of Late Capital."
