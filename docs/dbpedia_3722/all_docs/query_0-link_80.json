        "text": "The problem surely is not so much the ‘stripping away appearances’ as the methodology by which this is done and the level of accessability that people have to this ‘truth’.\n\nFor example, if we are doing building work, and you are standing on the roof and it ‘seems’ stable to you, but I can see things from a different angle and I can see that the roof is unsupported and that, in fact, you are shortly going to fall through it, I am not being ‘undemocratic’ or whatever in pointing this out to you. I really do have a better (‘deeper’) view of the situation than you have.\n\nBut note that even if you don’t fall through and break your neck, I can still take you aside and POINT out to you that what seemed like a stable position was in fact, not.\n\nIn other words, the facts about the roof were not inherently private. They were ‘private’ to you because you could not see them, but that was simply contingent (i.e cos you were standing on the roof).\n\nNow: that’s a very different situation from\n\na: phenomena which underly reality which are ‘inherently’ private and\n\nb: phenomena which underly reality which are not inherently private, but where the method by which they are to be made public is in some way unclear or vague, or ‘subjective’.\n\nTo take examples of both: according to Chomskyan linguistics, the seemingly heterogenous phenomena of language use are, apparently, merely a surface feature. ‘Underneath’ this seeming chaos there is (allegedly) order, in the form of rules. These rules are stored, allegedly, in the brain, but in a part of the brain which is unconscious to us and which must of necessity always remain unconscious.\n\nIn other words, these alleged cognitive structures are inherently private. There is no conceivable development in scientific practice that will ever result in them being observable.\n\nIn a seemingly completely different way, Marxism and Freudianism function in much the same way, except in terms more of issue number ‘b’, not ‘a’. Marx, for example, insisted on the existence of ‘deep structures’ that underly capitalism. (He talked of the difference between ‘appearance’ and ‘essence’ but this is essentially what he meant). Capitalism (according to Marx) seems to be x,y, and z, but in reality (i.e. ‘underneath’ it) it is actually very different.\n\nNow according to Marxist materialism, there is nothing inherently private about these ‘structures’ or ‘phenomena’. They could be made public and, indeed, in Capital Marx believed he had made them public. The problem is: what if you read all of Capital, understand its arguments but simply don’t agree with it? What in other words, if you ‘see’ all that ‘Marx’ saw but still don’t ‘see’ the underlying structures that are the REAL moving forces of capitalism that Marx (and Marxists) saw?\n\nThe same issue with Freud (which is not such a different theory from Chomskyan linguistics, except in reverse. Chomsky sees a logical structure ‘underneath’ a seemingly illogical (chaotic) ‘surface’, Freud sees an ‘illogical’ (irrational) ‘structure(s)’ ‘underneath’ seemingly logical phenomena i.e ‘rational’ human behaviour).\n\nAgain, the phenomena which lies ‘underneath’ the human personality (superego, id, etc.) are not inherently private in Freudian parlance, and in fact Freud believed that they could be make public via psychoanalysis: the problem is what if other people listening in on a ‘session’ do not hear the discourse produced as evidence for the existence of the phenomena in question?\n\nThe problem in my opinion, is that all three of these viewpoints base their views on Galilean/Newtonian physics. But in physics the ‘structures’ that underly phenomena have a public guarantor: experimental prediction. It really doesn’t matter whether you ‘believe’ in (e.g.) force, or energy or whatever. You can make predictions that are right more often than not, and this functions as a public demonstration of the validity of the ‘private’ (unviewable) structure or phenomena (or whatever).\n\nBut in neither of the three views above is this is the case, and when it is, the results are usually embarassing. In the Grundrisse, for example, Marx predicted (apparently) that real communism should come into existence about 150 years after he was writing: i.e. the very first few decades of the 21st century. This prediction (assuming that Marx made it) does not give one faith in Marxism’s continuing relevance, nor in the superiority of his insights into capitalism over anyone elses.\n\nAn even deeper problem with Marxism (and for that matter Chomskyan linguistics and Freudianism) is that they don’t seem to see the problems posed to their theories by underdetermination .\n\nApart from whatever wisdom the quoted statement might or might not contain, or hint at, it is not paradoxical – in conjunction with a couple of highly plausible background premises, it simply generates an ordinary contradiction in a non-paradoxical way, and is thus false.\n\nSuppose we accept:\n\n1. Anything that appears to be something that it is not is deceptive (background premise)\n\n2. Every appearance (a) is not deceptive, and (b) appears to be deceptive. (the quoted statement)\n\n3. There is at least one appearance. (background premise)\n\nUniversally instantiating on 3 and applying 2 we have:\n\n4. X is not deceptive\n\n5. X appears to be deceptive\n\nfrom 4 and 5:\n\n6. X appears to be something that it is not\n\nand then from 1 and 6, we have:\n\n7. X is deceptive\n\nwhich contradicts 4.\n\nThus 1, 2 and 3 appear to be an inconsistent set of statements, and 2 is clearly the weakest link.\n\nOK, so can we also generate a contradiction running in the other direction? Suppose we now begin with the denial of 2:\n\n2*. Some appearance either (a) is deceptive or (b) does not appear to be deceptive.\n\nExistentially instantiating to an arbitrary Y, we have:\n\n8. Y is deceptive OR Y does not appear to be deceptive.\n\nBut I don’t see how one can go from here to generate a contradiction. Indeed 2* seems very plausible. It would be held unproblematically by any person who believes that there is at least one deceptive appearance or, barring that, that all appearances are veridical and at least one of them does not even appear to be deceptive.\n\nI would conclude that 2 is simply false, and its denial 2* is unproblematically true.\n\nWittgenstein’s response to the “liar’s paradox” was to say, “yes, one can go back and forth on that forever, but so what?” In other words, why would anyone actually say that, in what context and with what intention or effect? But if there is never any actual context in which something would be said in a natural language, then that utterance can have no illocutionary force, and hence can have no meaning. It’s not paradoxical, but merely nonsensical, meaningless. It’s really not that much different of a case from syntactically correct, semantically nonsensical “sentences”, such as, “the automobile swam under the ocean.”\n\nMore generally, the temptation to produce or become ensnared in nonsensical or contradictory sentences like the one posted above, I think, results less from a failure to reason with logical clarity, than from a conceptual impulse toward generalization that fails to pay attention to applicability: we have distinctions such as that between appearance and reality (or “essence”) because they have uses and are applicable in grappling with certain problematic situations, without necessarily generalizing across the whole field of problems concerning reality. If metaphysics results from the bad reification of such distinctions, the effort to undo metaphysics or think non-metaphysically can produce it own forms of nonsense.\n\nConcerning Brendan’s comment on Marx and Freud above, I think he is right to detect a certain tendency toward “Newtonian” objectivism in their work, or, alternatively, a dogmatic realism toward processes too complex and many-sided to be conventionally “real”, but there are also more complex readings of their work that don’t boil them down to a results-oriented scientific objectivism and to claims to have discovered once and for all the or an underlying basis of reality. In Marx’ case, his whole analysis of capitalism is “grounded” in an underlying philosophy of praxis that frames it and provides its normative commitments, such that it is not simply a question of whether his empirical results are objectively real or flatly true, without relating them to the framework in which they obtain and similarly for the claims of alternative economic analyses. The point is that a more open reading of such works renders what their interpretations still might have to offer available, in ways that a simplistic logical either-or shuts off, such that they can be confronted with other such interpretations in an inevitably plural world, without obseesion with dogma, old battles, historical triumphalism or deterministic hindsight. More or less comprehensive interpretations are limited and corrected less by objective reality than by other such interpretations and no claims about objective reality should foreclose consideration of the reasons by which people chose such interpretations or find them wanting.\n\n‘In Marxâ€™ case, his whole analysis of capitalism is â€œgroundedâ€ in an underlying philosophy of praxis that frames it and provides its normative commitments, such that it is not simply a question of whether his empirical results are objectively real or flatly true, without relating them to the framework in which they obtain and similarly for the claims of alternative economic analyses.

And to a certain extent nowadays, I am arguing against a straw man. I doubt there are many people nowadays who read Freud or Marx as though they (and they alone, perhaps) had access to some universal truth that lies ‘underneath’ reality, which would finally solve important problems (perhaps all important problems) in philosophy and science.\n\nBut of course that’s nowadays. There is little doubt that in the past people did read both Freud and Marx in precisely that way: i.e. as sort of secular prophets. It’s hardly an original though to note that Freudian and Marxists tend(ed) to react to criticisms of their ‘holy books’ in much the same way that fundamentalist Islamists reacted to the Danish cartoons. The interesting question is ‘why’? And I think it’s related to both Freud’s (implicitly) and Marx’s (explicitly) adherence to the idea of ‘appearence’ and ‘essence’, surely a metaphysical proposition. Or to be more specific, the idea of an ‘essence’ that was not grounded in experimental prediction, but which was, to a certain extent, in the eye of the beholder."
