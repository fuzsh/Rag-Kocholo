        "text": "How are supposed “philosophy snobs” wrong about de Botton? Dib perfectly captures one of de Botton’s tactics in marketing philosophy to ‘non-academics.’ In namedropping a philosopher followed by a reference to a famous quotation — in her case, mentioning René Descartes, followed by “I think, therefore I am” enclosed in parentheses — Dib, consciously or unconsciously, employs a subtle approach in reducing philosophy to easily absorbable concepts and quotations that are often isolated, uncontextualized, and almost always taken as representative of the entirety of a philosopher’s thoughts. The more familiar occurrences of this is the reduction of Heraclitus to the river simile, Plato to the world of forms, Thomas Aquinas to the five ways, Immanuel Kant to the categorical imperative, G.W.F. Hegel to (the legend that is) the thesis-antithesis-synthesis, Karl Marx to thesis eleven, Friedrich Nietzsche to the death of god, Camus to suicide, and so on.\n\nOne could already imagine where the supposedly snobbish, dismissive, and intolerant attitude of academic philosophers come from. The reduction of philosophy to easily absorbable tic tac-like commodities — the tictactization of philosophy, if you will — establishes a culture of accepted views resulting to a sea of prejudiced interpretations upon which the minds of generations of learners cruise. It creates an illusion that the learner is confidently in familiar territory, when in fact a vast area of uncharted waters remains to be explored.\n\nThe unwelcoming attitude of academic philosophers to oversimplification comes from the fact that the volumes of a philosopher’s work cannot possibly be reduced to what then becomes popular buzzwords, catchphrases and misattributed bumper sticker quotes at worst, and readily consumable concepts and quotations at best, without losing its depth. Note well, however, that my concern is with the reduction, not the recognition of the central tenets of a philosopher’s thoughts. After all, most thinkers were not inclined to reduce their philosophy to one or a few concepts, however representative we think those may be. Even the admission of Kong Zi (Confucius) that there is one teaching — i.e., reciprocity — that people ought to have their lives governed by, did not encourage his disciples to reduce Confucianism to the golden rule.\n\nCriticisms commonly levelled against de Botton, were, for Dib, tough pills to swallow. “The elitism surrounding academia,” she writes, “means that people will thumb their nose at anything deemed to accessible, ‘mainstream’ or simple.” The prevalent impugning and mockery of de Botton is so preposterous for the author who regards The Consolations of Philosophy (2000) as a “thought-provoking, stimulating work that, as with anything else, has its fans and detractors.” This kind of apologia misses the common tenor present in criticisms against de Botton. That any thinker has their fair share of followers and critics is an undisputed fact. What academics are concerned with is the proliferation of what, for lack of a better term, we shall call bad philosophy.\n\nComing from a different horizon, most defenders of de Botton commonly try to paint a portrait of snobbish philosophers that Dib fondly calls “philosophy nerds” — those who frown upon the idea of accessible philosophy. She laments:\n\n“Those who haven’t studied philosophy at university may not realise this, but that stuff can be hard to read: dense, dry and often inaccessible. I’m a smart person, and it’s a tough slog. My interest in philosophy has often stimulated a desire to soak up the knowledge of Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and Plato, but I find myself confused and ashamed 20 pages in. I don’t think I am the only human alive who struggles with tomes like those, though they might have the genuine desire to be educated on the subject.”\n\nThe self-admission of smartness seems an uncharacteristic attitude of anyone who wishes to study or do philosophy. This starting point fosters a sense of entitlement in which one is ostensibly led to think that understanding is supposed to be easy. This mindset favors the shortcut over the scenic route in which, borrowing from Karl Jaspers, the loving struggle for truth is experienced.\n\nTo judge how the author perceives herself, however, is none of my business. Instead, I intend to show that though there might be a difference between those who studied philosophy in the university and those who didn’t, the difference is far from Dib’s straw man conception. Although she is not the premier representative of philosophy learners unaffiliated with the academe, we can nevertheless speculate that the difference lies precisely in attitude. Those who studied philosophy in the university were made to understand, at the outset, that ideally, there is a need for a cultivation of a certain kind of intellectual humility, the epitome of which was the man who showed that wisdom begins in the admission that one knows nothing. This trait is often missed by some (and the emphasis is on some) who approach the discipline from without. With this difference in mind, Dib was wrong to imply that those who studied in the university had it easier and that the experience of the denseness of the text and dryness of the prose is exclusive only to non-academics. In fact, these are quite difficult as well even for those who’ve been engaging with it for years. The latter, however, is cognizant of the fact that they are not supposed to ‘understand’ at once. It is not prohibited to study philosophy without a degree. However, the importance of time must be underscored: the study of philosophy, as with any other discipline, takes time. Prefacing the circuitous, yet, educative journey of self-consciousness in his Phenomenology of Spirit (1807), Hegel warns us: “Impatience demands the impossible, to wit, the attainment of the end without the means.”\n\nIn attempting to “battle through” Schopenhauer’s The World as Will and Representation (1818/19), Dib admitted that she “got frustrated with his dusty ass pretty quick.” Had she been patient enough to slog through the dense text, she would’ve encountered a very interesting observation from Schopenhauer, who remarked, concerning Kant and the complexity of philosophy, that “what is obscure is not always without meaning.” Unfortunately, Dib dropped Schopenhauer in favor of de Botton. For the bragging rights of being able to boast that one understood a certain philosopher or a concept, one, in fact, may have only settled for a dumbed down, overly simplified, or at times, an unmistakably wrong interpretation of it. Of course, one could easily invoke the impossibility of a purely objective reading, but just because there’s no such thing doesn’t mean there are no objectively wrong, misleading, and trivialized ones. Case in point is de Botton’s therapeutic conception of philosophy, best described by his use of a quote from Epicurus, on the back cover of the first edition of The Consolations:\n\n“Any philosopher’s argument which does not therapeutically treat human suffering is worthless; for just as there is no profit in medicine when it doesn’t expel the diseases of the body, so there is no profit in philosophy when it doesn’t expel the sufferings of the mind.”\n\nDe Botton’s gravest offense was perhaps already pronounced by Edward Skidelski, in a critical review published almost two decades ago. In confusing the practicality of philosophy with flattery, de Botton fails to communicate that “something may be useful or appropriate in your life without necessarily making you feel better.” It is a common misconception that philosophy ought to solve our problems. “To comprehend what is,” Hegel declared in 1820, “that is the task of philosophy.” Likewise, Theodor Adorno admitted that the question “what is to be done?” is “asking too much” of him, and he confined himself only to the task of analyzing “relentlessly what is.” Even Ludwig Wittgenstein challenged the idea that “philosophy hasn’t made any progress” when he asked: “if someone scratches where it itches, do we have to see progress?” The medical analogy is misleading; for unlike medicine, philosophy isn’t always concerned with end results. Theories are not at once to be followed as though they were the teachings of a wise guru. Its chief value is that it stands in conflict with other theories, which allows us to view the world from a variety of perspectives.\n\nThe practicality of philosophy must never be a justification for dumbing it down for the sake of accessibility. Far from the dominant misconception, it’s never the case that philosophers are keeping philosophy from the public, given the plethora of readily available recorded talks, lectures, and podcasts, open access philosophy journals and publications, and a variety of freely available resources online. The democratization of knowledge can optimistically be viewed as an invitation to improve the quality of thinking. After all, in the words of a certain British rock band, “nobody said it was easy.”\n\nPublic libraries as well as the World Wide Web abound with readily available academic philosophy sources which should entice us to look beyond the comforting and the therapeutic. “Claiming that academics are failing to engage with the general public,” Adam Kotsko wrote, “is intellectual laziness at best and anti-intellectual posturing at worst.” We’ve gone from the age of enlightenment to the age of entitlement in which not only must knowledge and information be spoon-fed, it must also be easily consumable. The democratization of knowledge is an invitation for engagement, which, in its ideal form, is a “two-way street.”\n\nThat accessibility is a prerequisite of engagement is indeed a convincing argument. In an interesting response, Justin Weinberg questions Kotsko’s “faulty generalization” of depicting the public as “close-minded and unreceptive to academic expertise.” He invokes the “availability heuristic” as the primary reason why the public find it difficult to engage. Yet, while the simple answers to this are time, humility, and patience, Maxwell’s defense of the necessary complexity of philosophical language is more persuasive. He insists that:\n\n“[J]ust as one wouldn’t expect to be able to perform brain surgery or build a rocket without decades of study and practice with the instruments and theories of those endeavors, so too should one not expect to be able to do real philosophy, or even to understand it very well, without years of study and practice. Of course popularly accessible explanations of difficult philosophical concepts are necessary and important. …. Still, the often-repeated demand that all philosophy be understandable by non-specialists is as misguided as the demand that a brain surgeon or rocket scientist should be able to do their work without the tools of their trade …”\n\nThe complexity of philosophy represents the complex subjects it engages (no matter how simple it appears). This is why academics often feel offended by an oversimplification, much less misinterpretation, of what they devote years of study to. De Botton and his defenders espouse the thesis that a philosophy that isn’t directly relatable is a weak kind of philosophy. As a result, philosophy is forced to become overly simple resulting to some trite clichés and truisms that often do injustice to the philosopher or the concept. It is indeed tempting to go on into detail, although the brevity required of this piece suggests that I must postpone such a trajectory for the moment. Yet, for the sake of example, we may succinctly consider de Botton’s brainchild, The School of Life.\n\nThe School of Life is an educational company that publishes books, articles, and films on philosophy and emotional intelligence. Premised by the (false) promise of the democratization of wisdom, SOL is a profiteering company that entices its consumers promising answers to life’s biggest questions. In the company’s introductory video, they describe themselves as an “open-minded, rigorous, unideological organization devoted to helping you deal with the important things that you were never taught at school.” It betrays, however, those descriptions when almost all content are created and narrated by de Botton, whose very ‘philosophy’ reflects the contents published. There is nothing open-minded, rigorous, and unideological in a philosophical ‘lecture’ that fails to address, or at least, present opposing views from the ideas being advanced. We need not even talk about how ‘philosophy’ as it is presented is noticeably prejudiced at best and misleading at worst, for all of this is hidden in de Botton’s cut-glass accent, near-perfect enunciation, and a soothing voice that reassures us, toward the end of almost every SOL video, using a tone that suggests ‘don’t you worry, we’ve got it all figured out, everything will be just fine.’ Hegel once said that “[w]e do not need to be shoemakers to know if our shoes fit, and just as little have we any need to be professionals to acquire knowledge of matters of universal interest.” He refers to right and freedom, though much of the subjects covered in philosophy are matters of universal interest too. And while this is the case, any philosophy worth its salt must invite the learner to pursue more questions.\n\nDe Botton and Dib advocate for a philosophy that’s directly applicable to life. This is not uncommon. Thus, there are those who prefer one variant over the rest. There are those who never cared about labelling their works philosophical, yet still produce philosophically-rich content. There are those who were profoundly informed by philosophical theories in their applied philosophical and interdisciplinary studies. Unavoidably, there also those whose attempt fail both in its theoretical foundations and practical applications. Incidentally, these are usually those who are insulted when their work is criticized as hardly or insufficiently philosophical; they resort to calling philosophers “purists,” among other things. Dib has a proclivity for “applying philosophical teachings to modern life,” emphasizing the immediacy of the hic et nunc. She might as well be the type of person to haphazardly trumpet Marx’s eleventh thesis — “the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways; the point is to change it” — commonly misinterpreted as an objection against all theory, and forgetting its roots from the young Marx who hoisted the banner of the “ruthless criticism of all that exists.” Interestingly, Mladen Dolar has this to say, perhaps not of Marx, but to those who carelessly tout the oft-cited thesis:\n\n“Where is a single interpreter of the world in the entire history of philosophy? Philosophy was always done in view of changing the world, the idea of mere interpretation, if such a thing exists, never crossed anybody’s mind. Not that the world would have necessarily been a better place if one heeded their advice … but one certainly cannot reproach them for the lack of trying. Hence the provocation that Slavoj Žižek loves to make in his lectures: philosophers were always trying to change the world, let us finally interpret it properly, this will maybe make a change; rush to action is more often than not an acting out, a flight from a conceptual deadlock that only ‘theory’ can tackle.”\n\nTo change the world is to understand it. No philosopher endeavored a pure interpretation designed only to reconcile ourselves with the current state of affairs. No matter how remote a subject may seem, Amélie Rorty argues that philosophy always has an educative import:\n\n“Philosophers have always intended to transform the way we see and think, act and interact; they have always taken themselves to be the ultimate educators of mankind. Even when they believed that philosophy leaves everything as it is, even when they did not present philosophy as the exemplary human activity, they thought that interpreting the word aright — understanding it and our place in it — would free us from illusion, direct us to those activities (civic life, contemplation of the divine order; scientific progress or artistic creativity) that best suit us. Even “pure” philosophy — metaphysics and logic — is implicitly pedagogical. It is meant to correct the myopia of the past and the immediate.”\n\nThe stylish and fashionable pop philosophy oozes with allure given its apparent proximity to our daily lives. However, just because we don’t see the immediate results and effects of academic philosophy, doesn’t mean it’s divorced from reality. Anyone who wishes to partake in this venture must accept and respect its “extremely long, slow process.”\n\nDib makes a case for de Botton’s legitimacy. Blinded from critical perspectives, however, she misses many of de Botton’s blatant trivialization of philosophical ideas. For example, inspired by the non-existence of a complex setup of a formal educational system in Greek antiquity, de Botton misdirects his readers in saying that “[w]e do not need years of formal education and leisured existence. Anyone with a curious and well-ordered mind who seeks to evaluate a common-sense belief can start a conversation with a friend in a city street and, by following a Socratic method, may arrive at one or two ground-breaking ideas in under half an hour.” This trivialization of supposedly commonsense beliefs that Socrates questioned in Plato’s dialogues, and the dumbing down of the Socratic method that “may without injustice be presented in the language of a recipe book or manual,” (CON, 23) are instances of the perils of overly popularizing high culture at the expense of its depth.\n\nDoing philosophy is akin to an educative experience. In the history of education, the transition from medieval to modern period signaled the gradual dethroning of the professor, transitioning to the facilitator. With these came contemporary models of education such as student-centered learning, Ivan Illich’s deschooling, and Jacques Rancière’s “equality of intelligence,” to mention some. The latter wrote in 1987 that “[o]ur problem isn’t proving that all intelligence is equal. It’s seeing what can be done under that presupposition.” Yet, given today’s conditions in which we witness the most evident cases of pacified consciousnesses exhibiting anti-intellectual tendencies, it would be difficult to comply with what Rancière advocates as the starting point of learning. Because everyone is given a voice, anyone, with the right means could just as easily speak. We would not be far from the truth in saying that the crisis of the contemporary culture of learning is precisely the forgetfulness of humility. De Botton’s consolatory philosophy, however, shoves the people further down the depths of false consciousness, instead of awakening in his readers, the capacity for critical consciousness. Now, more than ever, in a world that subjugates us, the task of philosophy as education is to disturb — to startle and estrange rather than console.\n\nOne could only hope that those who began with de Botton may actually have the inspiration to go beyond, to start again, for the first time. Paraphrasing Slavoj Žižek, “[y]ou’ve had your [anti-intellectualist] fun, and you are pardoned for it — time to get serious once again!”\n\n· · ·"
