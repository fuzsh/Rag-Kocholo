They star a revamped version of the company’s mascot, The King, who has left the world of animated children’s advertisements and is now played by an actor wearing a large plastic mask featuring a crown, a beard, and an alarming perpetual smile. One typical ad features a man waking up in the morning to find The King in bed with him, staring at him inches away from his face. The man is initially alarmed, but becomes calm when The King hands him a breakfast sandwich. As he eats, he and The King become friendlier, joking, laughing, and even briefly brushing hands—and then they both flinch away and face forward in the bed. In another, a man wakes up, opens the blinds, and finds The King standing there staring at him. He starts to become agitated until he notices that The King is holding a plate with a breakfast sandwich.\n\nThis ad series, whose mascot was widely called the Creepy King in the press and among viewers, generated considerable word-of-mouth attention for Burger King, and in a sense it could be viewed as one of the most successful viral marketing campaigns of all time. Unfortunately for Burger King, the attention was almost uniformly negative. My father, one of the most easy-going people I know, at one point asked if I had seen the ads and expressed genuine outrage that Burger King was trying to sell hamburgers using homoerotic voyeurism.\n\nOther viewers were similarly repelled, and the firm’s advertising agency, Crispin Porter + Bogusky, tweaked the formula slightly. In one later ad, The King crashes through an office window in a relentless quest to replace a woman’s microwaved lunch with a huge hamburger, while in another he engages in a reverse pick-pocketing scheme wherein he sneaks money into people’s pockets, apparently symbolizing his commitment to saving customers money. One ad reprises the home invasion theme by casting The King as a member of a group of buddies sneaking into their friend’s room to wake him with a blow horn. This more overtly masculine take on the character was continued in a series of ads in which The King is digitally inserted into classic hockey matches.\n\nThe shift to surrealism was not enough to shake the Creepy King image, and ultimately the mascot was retired. Yet The King lives on, seared into the American cultural consciousness as an enduring archetype of creepiness. I’ve been researching the topic for years, primarily by asking people what they think of creepiness. Every definition I attempt is rejected as inadequate, and every creepy pop-cultural character seems open to other interpretations—except for one. The King is the one example that always receives unanimous consent.\n\nDoubtless a big part of the character’s impact is the simple shock that such an off-putting theme would be part of an advertisement. It’s rare enough to have an aggressively creepy character on television, and even then the writers will normally make some effort to make the character somehow relatable or sympathetic. Yet The King has no back-story, no mitigating factors. He is sheer creepiness embodied, all the more so given his unexpected irruption into a genre that normally makes every effort to pander to the viewer.\n\nHow could this happen? On a practical level, one can see how a space for such an unprecedented campaign could open up precisely at Burger King. A perpetual also-ran in the fast food industry, Burger King is a frequent target for private equity companies eager to snatch up ailing firms and apply their costcutting magic to return them to profitability. Hence it is also a chronically mismanaged firm, lurching from one contrived strategy to the next. In that context, an advertising campaign that used shock value to generate cheap publicity could easily sound like a plausible option.\n\nIt seems to me, however, that there is a deeper truth at work in the Creepy King campaign. This truth emerges in one of the least creepy King ads, which portrays him breaking into McDonald’s headquarters to steal the recipe for the Egg McMuffin so that Burger King can produce a copycat sandwich. Here we have a company openly admitting to its own redundancy, its lack of any mandate for existence. Maybe Burger King can give you slightly more food, or give it to you cheaper—but at the end of the day, it’s not contributing anything distinctive, original, or even particularly desirable. The commercials in fact exacerbate this sense of providing a generic food substance by referring to Burger King’s food primarily as meat, rather than naming the particular type of meat involved. Finally, the use of the mascot only highlights the contrast with McDonald’s: while we might imagine people being nostalgic about characters like Ronald McDonald or the Hamburglar, literally no one has fond memories of the old Burger King mascot that this ad is reviving.\n\nThere’s no reason for me to have any emotional connection with Burger King beyond the minimal investment it takes to prefer a Whopper to a Big Mac—and yet these commercials are manipulating me into a very strong (if negative) emotional response. As unprecedented as this ad campaign is on one level, though, is it really anything more than an intensification of what has been latent in Burger King all along? Haven’t all of its ads made disproportionate emotional demands on us, asking us to feel some kind of loyalty or affection for a McDonald’s knock-off? Burger King has nothing to offer us, and yet it has been demanding our attention and shoving itself at us nonetheless. In the last analysis, there was always something creepy about Burger King, and for a brief, uncanny moment, they were honest about it.\n\nFrom the uncanny to the creepy\n\nDuring my career as a commentator on popular culture, it has become clear that I am doomed to live out my jokes. My first book in this trilogy, Awkwardness, grew out of a pub discussion where I used Heideggerian terminology to describe awkward humor, claiming that awkwardness was a fundamental attunement of Dasein. The more I thought of it, though, the less it seemed like a joke—and eventually I was forced to actually write a book on it. The idea for a sequel initially came up as a joke as well. Having recently learned that one of my colleagues was planning to write a trilogy of books—a project of which I was, shall we say, a bit skeptical—I told my girlfriend: If he can write a trilogy, so can I! Awkwardness, creepiness…and sociopaths!\n\nAs I will try to show later in this introduction, this trinity of social dysfunction was not accidental, but was dictated by the terms of the very trends I was trying to diagnose. This same inner logic drove me to initially skip past creepiness, following up on Awkwardness with Why We Love Sociopaths—the time was not yet ripe. Perhaps a wiser man would have stopped there, yet I remained haunted by creepiness, unable to give up on the idea even though I found it in many ways unappealing.\n\nI am not the first commentator to be drawn almost involuntarily into the territory of creepiness. Most notably, Sigmund Freud beat me to it by nearly a century, in his 1919 essay The Uncanny (available, among many other places, in a Penguin Classics collection of which it is the title essay). The term uncanny is a translation of the German word unheimlich (literally unhomely), which refers to a wide range of phenomena associated with fear and dread. Freud detects an ambivalence in the term, which etymologically seems to refer to what is unfamiliar (what we are not at home with) but experientially most often involves something that is all too familiar, something that fits too well.\n\nHere we can see the appropriateness of the English translation uncanny, which we might invoke to describe a coincidence or an unexpected resemblance. Most of Freud’s examples, however, involve horror at the supernatural, which is not a context where we would normally use the word uncanny. And indeed, Freud surveys various European languages and concludes that there is no language other than German that unites the various meanings of unheimlich in a single term.\n\nLooking over Freud’s suggested possible translations of unheimlich into English, however, I wondered whether we have finally caught up with the Germans in this regard. Collected from various dictionaries, they include uncomfortable, uneasy, gloomy, dismal, uncanny, ghastly; (of a house) haunted; (of a man) a repulsive fellow. Today, we do have a single word that encompasses all of those meanings: creepy, which is associated at once with ghosts and the supernatural, with vaguer forms of discomfort, and with particularly off-putting individuals like The King.\n\nAs Freud explicates his examples, drawn mostly from horror stories, he focuses on the unexpected persistence of beliefs that the individual or society as a whole are supposed to have outgrown. On the individual level, Freud claims that many uncanny experiences derive from exaggerated childhood fears of punishment by one’s father, most notably the threat of castration. On the broader social level, it is a question of certain primitive beliefs about the power of the dead, which scientific modernity should have wiped out but which still remain just beneath the surface.\n\nThis leads Freud to endorse the definition of the philosopher F.W.J. Schelling, who declares that \"unheimlich is the name for everything that ought to have remained hidden and secret and has become visible.\" Freud is thinking primarily of disavowed beliefs, but Schelling’s definition would also include the sexual creepiness that comes to the fore in the Burger King ads as well as in everyday use of the term. We can see this perhaps most clearly in the case of neurotic young men who are mortally afraid of being declared creepy. At bottom, they fear that if they reveal their sexual desire, it will provoke a reaction of revulsion and disgust—better to keep it hidden, then.\n\nThe sexual roots of the English word creepy go back to around the 1600s, when the term creep was used to describe thieves, particularly those who robbed customers in brothels. This note of invasiveness seems to go back to the primary meaning of the verb to creep, referring to the locomotion of insects, who are always undesired intruders into the home. Interestingly, however, by the middle of the 1800s, the term began to refer not to an outside agent, but to the unexpected behavior of one’s own body, as in the idea of a creeping in the flesh—hence the shift of creepy into the realm of horror movies, which produce goose bumps. And in 1849, Dickens coined the idea of the creeps, describing the feeling produced by various forms of creepiness in abstraction from its particular cause.\n\nAdmittedly, the translation of unheimlich as creepy may initially seem to stretch the category beyond the bounds Freud sets out in The Uncanny. Yet insofar as it introduces an element of sexuality, it does so in a fundamentally Freudian way. Freud’s account focuses on social expectations, particularly in the form of paternal prohibitions, and for Freud those phenomena are inextricably tied up with sexuality. In fact, although the common understanding of Freud views him as focused on the individual psyche, I believe that his theory is better understood as an attempt to account for the fraught relationship between sexuality and the social order. And this is because Freud is above all concerned with understanding how human beings deal with what we could call the inherent creepiness of sexuality, with its tendency to transgress and evade all reasonable boundaries.\n\nFreud believes that the psyche responds to two different kinds of stimuli: external and internal. The external are relatively straightforward: they arise, we respond, and it’s over. The light is too bright, so I turn away. A bug is biting me, so I swat it. Even if the stimulus keeps coming back, each instance can be viewed as a more or less isolated incident—it’s always possible to imagine a particular stimulus never coming up again.\n\nOne could think that the same would hold for internal stimuli, which we might think of as something like animal instincts. I get hungry, so I eat. I have an itch, so I scratch it. These stimuli will of course eventually come back, but in the meantime, I can go about my business. Yet Freud claims that things are not so simple. Our internal stimuli are certainly related to simple bodily needs, but transposing them into the mental realm has an unintended side-effect. Bodily needs are inherently finite, but when they are transformed into mental"
