        "text": "Adam Kotsko, The Prince of This World, Stanford University Press, Stanford CA, 2017.\n\nNot so long ago I was in a book shop purchasing one of Italian “political theologist” Giorgio Agamben’s books. As I passed the book across to be scanned, the bookseller, a wiry old fellow, told me that I might be interested in another book called The Prince of This World, which he had recently read but sadly did not have in stock. It was all about the devil and “neo-liberalism”, he said. Dead good. It certainly sounded it. Kotsko is Agamben’s major English-language translator. I knew his name but was unaware that he had written much himself. Anyone who has read any of Agamben’s books should be familiar with the fact that they are often very dense, but very insightful, though like a great deal of contemporary continental philosophy they often seem to simply end when they run out of ideas and not much of a conclusion is reached. Perhaps we might forgive Agamben for this. Most of his books are part of a long overarching project on political theology that have recently been published in a single enormous volume: The Omnibus Homo Sacer.[1] There will probably be more volumes to come too.\n\nHowever, Kotsko himself writes in a far more American style. Prince is very accessible and very much a book steeped in liberal concerns with the current state of race relations in America. He begins with the trial of the Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson over the shooting of the young black man Michael Brown, in which Wilson claimed to have shot him out of fear (pp. 1-2). Brown was “no angel” we are told, his appearance was compared by Wilson to a “demon”. With this Kotsko begins to ask why the language of Heaven and Hell still remains important today. As a leftist he takes especial issue with the idea of the powerful using the imagery of the devil to describe those whom appear powerless. Yet he acknowledges that “on one level, of course, theology has always been a victim-blaming discourse” (p. 3). Job is the most obvious example of this. And yet so too have the the devil and demonology “often served as a weapon against oppression and injustice” (ibid). The Ancient Hebrews could not make sense of the misfortune of the destruction of Jerusalem and their exile to Babylon in any other way but the demonic. But they also began to imagine that God would soon defeat their “cosmic opponent”. The thrust of the book thus becomes the need to reclaim the imagery of the Devil for using against those with power.\n\nHowever, Prince soon begins to take a different turn towards the hopeless and melancholic. Kotsko ends up writing the history of the problem of evil as one in which God steadily hands over more and more of his power to the Devil, to the point that he himself becomes increasingly “inoperative” and irrelevant. This is very much in keeping with Agamben’s appendix at the end of The Kingdom and the Glory concerning the history of divine oikonomia and its immanentisation in economic and ecological systems:\n\n“God has made the world just as if it were without God…Modernity, removing God from the world, has not only failed to leave theology behind, but in some ways has done nothing other than than to lead the project of providential oikonomia to completion.”[2]\n\nChristianity comes claiming to supersede and “complete” Judaism and Ancient Paganism. It demythologises and destroys, it brings the sword, so to speak, and thus eventually perpetuated this upon itself as the “religion for exiting religion”. Its own kenosis or hollowing out was in it all along. To understand these issues Voegelin would have drawn attention to the problem of Augustine’s saeculum senescens (old age of the world) waiting for the parousia, and the temptation to write “Third Testaments” that this produced.[3] As Kotsko (p. 199-200) says: “modernity may have declared its freedom from Christianity, but it did so using Christianity’s freedom.” However, Kotsko and Agamben have almost nothing to say about the history of European millenarianism and certainly do not seem to know Voegelin. Instead their entry point is via Carl Schmitt’s secularisation thesis concerning the Political, Marxist Walter Benjamin’s “messianic” theses on the philosophy of history,[4] and, most important of all, the left Nietzschean “genealogical” approach to history practised by Michel Foucault.\n\nNeither Agamben nor Kotsko seem to be particularly religious (though I’m unsure), but both appear to be Roman Catholics. They simply seem to have come to the conclusion that the “dwarf” of theology inside the political “puppet” is worth talking about and that Nietzsche was on to something when he said that after the death of God, men would become more “Christian” than they ever had been before (see Kotsko p. 186, 199) Thus, Kotsko (p. 200) quite confidently seems to believe that there is no exit to political theology – even desiring an exit to it is implicitly part of its rules, a creatio ex nihilo attempt to redeem the world through demythologisation. As Hans Blumenberg noted in his arguments with Schmitt, the ideal of a creatio ex nihilo “Exception” cannot avoid the fact that the subject, whether king or otherwise, does not simply act out of totally irrational and original voluntarism, but in light of history having set up a chain of such acts as legitimate. Thus, one is “always-already” acting in bad faith, as part of a genealogy.[5] Any messianic break is part and parcel with legacies of messianic breaks with the past.\n\nThis argument was of course part of part of Blumenberg’s thesis that “self-assertive man” had emerged from the Middle Ages without a political theological legitimation. And yet, more than anything, this seems to backfire by accident. We would be hard pressed to find the moment of “self-assertive man” anywhere because his own myths of creatio ex nihilo deludes him. Either we side with Spengler in claiming that there was some mystical “world feeling” always-already in the geography and blood of Europe, which merely processed theology towards its own aims. This, of course, is quite a reactionary thesis invented for the sake of vitalist national revival but is abjectly undercut by extreme pessimism. Alternatively, we simply accept that theology tripped upon itself as the world was expanding (geographically, economically, intellectually), and the creatio ex nihilo, the millennium and other future-orientated discourses became secularised.\n\nHere is a perfect example. The oddest and perhaps daftest incarnation of this creatio ex nihilo creature at present is Franco Berardi’s “humanism” – which supposedly breaks entirely with the theological in the tradition of Pico Mirandola and the Renaissance humanists only instead to put in their place a kind of diet Prometheus – a being of weakness, senility, immanence and possibility in the present. Berardi thinks that in Oration of the Dignity of Man Pico “kindly invites God to leave the place, then gives man the axiogenic thrill of a non-written destiny”. This is not the case at all! Pico is obsessed with legitimising the glory of Man on the basis of the beneficence of God’s creation.\n\nPico’s plan is for Man to become as the angels: “We shall be all ablaze with Cherubic light. If we long with love for the creator himself alone, we shall speedily flame up with His consuming fire into a Seraphic likeness” all the way up to the Thrones, those angels who sit in judgement with God. [6] Only through climbing the ladder of light, love and judgement will Man reach his full potential, which is pointed squarely towards the veneration of God. Even here, in the veneration of man as “craftsman” imitating God is there no creatio ex nihilo, merely a repetition of not only God, but also the Platonic angelology of the medieval Arabs and Christians. Thus, while the sort of pop-cultural myth Berardi is utilising to reassert “humanism” against the theological is very inaccurate, it is in itself, even as a meme, a mere repetition of this imagined “break” that took place in the past.\n\nMuch of this is of course a reaction to other leftist thinkers like Antonio Negri who have made a “religious turn” in the past decade towards the embrace of theology, millenarianism and similar. It should also be noted that Kotsko claims to have been “converted” from being a “non-Republican” into a leftist by the Hegelian-Marxist theology of Slavoj Žižek.[7] I have written a little about Žižek and similar thinkers’ “religious turn” for VoegelinView here before. I find Žižek very entertaining and his dialogues with John Milbank and Boris Gunjevic to be especially provocative and worthy of esteem.[8] However, whereas Žižek utilises Christianity in the name of a return to millenarian revolutionary “messianic violence” Kotsko does not seem quite so convinced of the possibility of an Event that will be able to break with the liberal claim to the “end of history” – that millennium, which as soon as announced immediately became katechon – that which holds back the possibility of any other world with the words “there is no alternative”.\n\nThus, in the words of Peter Sloterdijk on Voegelin, in may well sound as though our political theologists are writing an “obituary” of the “sophia perennis”.[9] Sloterdijk of course saw Voegelin’s “obituary” as “involuntary” – a defence of Athens and Jerusalem that instead backfired into an autopsy. Not being quite so easily convinced of the superego of Enlightenment disenchantment one-way street towards degree zero of immanence and powerlessness, I have more than a little difficultly imagining that oikonomia has been brought to its completion or that the Devil now totally owns the world. If anything, Kotsko is writing an obituary of freedom, which is rather concerning, but so trite a meme about post-modern intellectuals that one isn’t really sure why they even bother still writing books sometimes.\n\nHistory is very long and the secularisation of the past few hundred years a very small and parochial business. There could yet be many places left for the “ruins” of Athens and Jerusalem still to go that cannot even be imagined. If modernity has (or was) indeed the era of Spengler’s “Faustian Man”, from Joachim to Ibsen with his arrows of desire forever aimed towards the other bank, the Gnostic lusting after libido dominandi, or Blumenberg’s “self-assertive” man with his own legitimacy, then perhaps indeed we are still in mourning for this short-lived creature’s wearing out, in an interregnum, and that given time others far different in their drives but still human all too human will appear to take his place. However, though Kojeve promised the “end of history” would bring satiated silence, the past several decades have been filled with so much neurotic chatter about powerlessness, especially from leftist academics, that one might think 300 and not 30 years had passed since Fukuyama’s now rather absurd Kojevean opportunism. The boorish stability of our intense present drives us bananas.\n\nPrince of This World proceeds through a number of very interesting and largely forgotten theological discourses. One is the strange manner in which according to Aquinas it only takes Lucifer’s fall for all the other angels to instantaneously either fall or stay loyal, as though their situation is worked out automatically.[10] As Kotsko says (p. 121), it is as though there is a “slight statistical bias against sinning” in the cosmos – perhaps a very heartening thought. Another (pp. 68-9) curious example is Tertullian’s De Spectaculis (On the Shows) with its rhetoric that Christians should stay home from the Circus Maximus and learn to please God, for in Heaven they will get to see the greatest show in the world – that of the damned souls being perpetually tortured in Hell.[11] What a “society of the spectacle” indeed!\n\nCertainly, this would not be a popular idea today, but it plays very much into one of Agamben and Kotsko’s (pp. 188-90, 202) key notions: that the history of Christianity circles around the idea that there is no “glory” without suffering, usually that of God’s or the Christian king’s enemies.[12] Yet Kotsko (pp. 192-3) is very much correct to point out an often-forgotten fact that even after the apocalypse and coming of the millennium, those who have been damned to Hell are not saved. They go on exactly as they are forever, unchanged: “Hell is finally the location of all that God cannot control.” To Kotsko this situation in Hell is analogous to what American leftists often call “neo-liberalism” – the cynical, atomised, futureless ideology seen to have held since the late 1970s, and which since then has only been affirmed again and again by both sides of mainstream politics under catchphrases such as the TINA (there is no alternative). Thus, at the “end of history” instead of Heaven on Earth there is only Hell and a totalising lack of agency.\n\nThus, we are to take the world as a great Foucauldian panopticon prison of “discipline and punishment” (pp. 186-8, 192-3). There’s certainly more than a little Gnosticism going on here. It is not merely that God is evil or has permitted it, it is that because he hands the whole world over to it he becomes a monster, who, in the end is not even necessary for the system’s functioning. It is simply that God is a tyrant who enables tyrants to set up their own kingdoms within his own and then evaporates. We are not supposed to ask about original sin or Christ’s redemption or anything of the like, so it would seem, because it seems that God only gives the angels and man enough rope to hang themselves, so to speak, when he gives them free will. Kotsko (pp. 199-200) writes:\n\n“In short within the mediaeval theological paradigm freedom is a trap. It functions as an apparatus for generating blameworthiness. It achieves this through a logic of retroactive responsibility…. Modern freedom is Christian freedom with the opposite moral valuations. The free expression of will is no longer the sign of moral degradation but the essence of human dignity… Yet modern freedom is not simply negative… like Christian freedom it is governed freedom.”\n\nWhat does he mean by “governed”? Quite simply that the State and the market are seen to necessarily limit it (p. 200). Why is this so? The idea is that what we have must have been “collectively willed” at some point. Retroactive responsibility remains the norm. Victims, such as Michael Brown once again, are blamed because it is assumed that they already made a “choice” (p. 201) to be like devils. In conclusion Kotsko (p. 202) explains all this as follows:\n\n“The modern world could therefore be viewed as a secularised version of the mediaeval world structure. At the foundation is hell, where bare life is produced and reproduced, while the pinnacle is the global elect, that small minority on whose behalf all glory is extracted from the damned. In between, there is the aspirational zone of purgatory, where by dint of hard work and sacrifice we can all make it to heaven- assuming we have all of eternity to work off our debt.”\n\nIn this the US as dominant world power is analogous with Heaven, but it has its own Hell in the form of its “ever-expanding archipelago of prisons.” Does Kotsko have a solution? In a way he seems to think that he does have the beginning for a “new paradigm” which begins with Gregory of Nyssa’s radical notion that even the Devil might be redeemed if he were “deprived of his despotic power” (p. 204). So too does he draw comparisons between the Jews of the 1st c CE under the Romans and how they managed to keep their communities after the destruction of the second temple, and modern people (though he is aware that the conditions are rather different – pp. 205-6).\n\nAnd yet all he can end with is saying that the situation today under “democratic capitalism” is “surely demonic, endlessly flapping its wings to keep itself irrevocably stuck in the same place” (p. 206). He knows that he is risking an “apocalyptic tone”, but the problem of course is that of apocalypse-without-apocalypse, so to speak, of the horror of a world that perhaps has already silently ended and now remains in an eternal aftermath. Climate change is shoehorned in in the final paragraph too (ibid). We do indeed live in an age where apocalyptic fantasies seem to be proliferating, and yet of course, cannot be taken seriously. The more shrill and insistent they become, the less real they seem. The apocalypse has long been sucked into hyperreal kitsch – the “heatsink” of Hollywood blockbusters and journalistic “infotainment”. But of course, some apocalypse fantasies remain too feral to be given credence, even as kitsch. A perfect example would be the reactionary meme of “white genocide”.\n\nOne might note that in 2015 Kotsko found himself on an “alt right” watchlist (not a fun place to be) for tweeting that all white people should “commit suicide”. This was the result of an argument that took place after he had stated the now fairly common American leftist idea that all white people benefit from the legacy of slavery. Apparently he thought he should say the suicide cliche first because some wingnut would have just said it anyway. Good strategy? You decide. In a blog entry from the time he explains:\n\n“Several of my new interlocutors have objected that if we’re complicit in slavery, that also means that we’re complicit in all other ongoing injustices. Again, from the individualistic standpoint, this is a reductio ad absurdum — if we’re responsible for everything, we’re responsible for nothing. But from a social justice perspective, that is no counter-argument: it’s the whole point. Absolute individual moral purity is not available to any of us given the unjust social systems that shape our lives. That means that individual moral purity is also not a relevant point of reference. If it were the standard, then we would once again be on the road to mass suicide as the only possible response. In a social model of justice that is not focused primarily on individual guilt and punishment, however, the point is not to condemn people to deprivation and death — it is to find ways to live together.”[13]\n\nThe emphasis on “live” likely suggests the influence of Agamben’s preoccupation with the concept of “biopower” – of techniques for controlling masses of human beings that have grown up with modernity. Perhaps the assumption is that there might be some “form of life” to be found that as with Agamben’s turn towards the Joachite Franciscans in The Highest Poverty might produce an alternative way of living that goes beyond individual ownership of property and responsibility, an “Age of the Monk”. Thus far Kotsko does not seem to have outlined such a thing. I hope he will.\n\nYet the content of what he is saying also reflects very well the same argument we find in Prince – that the idea of individual “freedom” is a trap. To conservatives this way well look like standard liberal need to avoid personal responsibility. Poor old theology, queen of the sciences, they might say, is raked through the coals of generic American “critical theology” whining. Kotsko might seem to be in the same school of thought as popular African American intellectual Ta-Nehisi Coates and his overindulgent Between the World and Me, which while very well written, is, in the end very little but a masochist worship of being utterly powerless, of being trapped in the “dream of the Other”, so to speak.[14] Instead of being retrojectively responsible for a “choice” the victims of history are instead trapped by the fact they never made a choice. It is tempting to say that Kotsko’s excuse is “the devil made me do it” and God won’t step in and fix the problem. If indeed God has been replaced by the collective will of the humanist political community, then of course from his perspective it too seems to be utterly “inoperative”. What is harder that forcing a miracle out of God? Forcing a miracle out of the “general will” who believe in the lie of “freedom of choice”!\n\nNow some readers might find all this a little histrionic (or not nearly enough!). The wry conservative, upon reading Kotsko’s allegory of the world as Hell for the majority of its inhabitants, might simply repeat the popular meme that “Hell has an open border policy, Heaven does not.” But let us tease this out a little further, to somewhere the institution conservative would perhaps not readily go in admitting the possibility that his Heaven might be inverted. Might we not say that it could be better to be trapped outside the gates of Hell, stuck amidst the thongs of perpetual Limbo, than to end up even further from God by descending into Inferno itself? For while the liberal seems keen to admit the seething, suffering masses, in the end, should they work hard and be fortuitous, what have they and their children to look forward to but becoming the sort of lifeless, miserable, bored and bitter creatures of “affluenza” that somehow represent the young people of the Information Age? Perhaps only the most dismal of communists and reactionaries would agree to such observations, but increasingly I think they shall become more and more common.\n\nWe should all indeed know by now that no one with any political gumption is “happy” with the situation today. From the communists to the fascists everyone has taken the “black pill” of hopelessness, and there seems no limit to the crabs in a bucket race of mimetic identity politics towards the claim for who is the biggest victim of history. Clearly Fukuyama was wrong – about a great many things – but especially the idea that the best system had arrived for producing an isothymia of equal recognition between people.[15] But it is not merely the political eccentrics who have come to such conclusions, feeling the Overton Window slammed against them, but even within the “conventional” edifice books like Patrick J. Deneen’s Why Liberalism Failed have been selling like hotcakes. And why should they not be? Deneen seems right on the money in many cases, such as how women’s liberation has ended up liberating women from biology, only for them to become slaves of the body of “corporate America” just like the miserable men of “neo-liberalism”. He writes:\n\n“We effectively possess little self-government, either as citizens over our leaders or as individuals over our appetites. Citizens under liberalism are assured of our civic potency while experiencing political weakness and engaging in infinite acts of choice that are only deeper expressions of our thralldom….Liberalism arose from by appeal to an enobling set of political ideals and yet realised new and comprehensive forms of degradation.”[16]\n\nHowever, we need to look a little more closely at the history and political theology of liberalism. We need to recognise that the problem of being trapped in Hell with nothing but petty appetition is a very old support indeed. Let us not forget Martin Luther complaits that the world was the devil’s arse or an immense chicken’s crop because it had been ruined by the buyers and sellers (though there was rather a little anti-Semitism in that). As hippy millenarian Norman O. Brown said of this, learning to love this misery may well have been the proper origins of the “protestant work ethic and spirit of capital” (Freudian faeces hoarding included!).[17] Similarly, we might do well to note Jean Pierre Dupuy’s recent return to the Weberian “Calvinist’s Wager” as an analogy for the bad faith inherent in the “neo-liberal” attitude that everyone is a free and rational actor, but chooses unfreedom and determinism by believing that the market will just fix everything.[18] There is indeed something to be said about the fact that the WASP “one dimensional man” may have long since been replaced by homo consumens, but the political theology of liberalism’s current “there is no alternative” is much older than one might think.\n\nThe term “neo-liberalism” often seems to embody the idea that the obsession with everyone being some sovereign rational actor who chooses his own fate is of recent invention – as though not so long back perhaps there was a time when people knew that social structures were the problem, but that this was somehow lost. Are we to forget Mandeville’s Fable of the Bees, that first true piece of “neo-liberal” cynical reason with its chant of “private vices, public benefit”?[19] If one is to skin liberalism, then perhaps it should at very least be through Plato as theologian D. C. Schindler has recently done with his masterly Freedom From Reality: The Diabolical Nature of Liberalism.[20] To me at least Schindler made John Locke’s obsession with potentiality over actuality in relation to the materialistic Will and its subjective whims sound like we were always going to end up, no matter what, with Gilles Deleuze and the “accelerationist” obsession with the intensification of unhinged appetitive desire. More on this “diabolical” similarity will have to wait for another review. We have enough devils in this one already.\n\nThe main problem is that “neo-liberalism” at least partially operates as a kind of cover, a necessary Fall so that leftists do not have to take any responsibility for their own failures in the 1960s-70s that were brought on by playing into the very logic of liberalism’s petty appetition. Space Age Freud-Marx failed very, very badly. Norman O. Brown’s solution to being trapped in Hell, like that of Marcuse and many others at the time, was the “resurrection of the body” – the idea that the sexual revolution might dethrone capitalist oppression. Yet, by the time we get to Brown’s ‘Dionysus in 1990” we find him declaring that he and Marcuse had been too “pretentious” and that the only choice now was the embrace of consumer capitalist orgyism: “Here Comes Everyone!”[21] Dear old Norman is perhaps too good a case study for it all going pear-shaped.\n\nThe Space Age messianic “liberation of desire” failed and was instantly folded back into consumerism with a new imperative to enjoy, to use the language of Žižek. This helped to make an already rather miserable world just a little bit more atomised and nastier for a great many people, who ended up with no religion, no community and no faith in politics. It played its part, just as monetarian economics, privatisation, globalisation and so on did. Kotsko is right about the modern understanding of “freedom” not as rope to hang oneself, but as something magically good: “this reversal comes out in the fetishization of the rebel, of the subversive and irreverent – or more literally – of the devil and heresy.” (p. 199). But “transgression” (especially from the left today) is about as edgy as the basic bitch hedonism of Lavey’s Church of Satan. It’s just a bit sad because it is very obvious that while once upon a time there might have been some sort of “edge” and adventure, it has long since settled into retirement to wax nostalgic about the things of last century.\n\nDoes not the story of someone like Coates epitomise this – the story of a young man who grew up after the fact of the Black Panthers, Malcolm X and all that and only has a powerless, naff cult of “bodies” as a substitute? As Marie Moran has traced so well in Identity and Capitalism “identity politics” with its nostalgic kitsch and endless moaning and bifurcation into new niches has grown up these past fifty years as part of consumerism.[22] The involvement of the Space Age Left in this crime and those who have replicated it has to be covered up. Among these Michel Foucault, from whom just so many post-modern leftists draw their conception of “neo-liberalism”, may himself be implicated. As is discussed in wonderful detail here he seems to have found more positive in the epochal post-60s break, its new version of Man, than many would let on. And yet the “long march” produced very little except for a “cultural leftist” commentariat of infinite resentment-farming, the Buzzfeedisation of hermeneutics. It only somehow still survives due to dotage and because it believes it to still be 1969 – that the old hard Father rather than the post-60s “permissive” liberal Father is still the social superego. The permissive father forever hands out rope and it is gladly snatched up: have more games! More viral novelties! More platforms! More pharmaceuticals! More grist for Big Resentment!\n\nIt is as though, in Freudian terms, we might say, with tongue in cheek, that the murder of the old Father had to be covered up to absolve responsibility. I have said much about this here before. God forbid that we might sound like kitsch-pedlar Jordan Peterson (yuck) by saying such things. What more is the monstrous “self help” industry than a symptom, a sophistic parasite, that since the 1960s has been endlessly cashing in on the “permissive” society’s moral vacuum without curing a damn thing? But the problem, in the end, is still the refusal by anyone to take responsibility for this awful scene. How can we blame the Boomers for everything when we are so in love with nostalgia for their contribution? We could not even fantasise about a creatio ex nihilo if we tried.\n\nKotsko seems to have been born in 1980, just a few years before myself. The fact is that we have not known any other world, any more than my Russian friends of the same age can really recall the USSR. The popular “will” had made its decision before we were ever born. But when even was this decision made? If there is a political-theological comparison worth mentioning, then perhaps it might be that of the strange Lex Regia in the Digest of Roman Law, which claimed that at some point the Roman people had agreed to hand over their power to the emperor.[23] The moment is impossible to locate, but we must assume that it happened. Until we have a proper obituary of the 20th c. and a collective “will” to no longer want to live in it anymore will we will not anywhere. God only knows how long that will take and what might provoke such realisations.\n\nPerhaps, then, even though it might seem odd that Coates’ book in the form of a letter to his son, an explanation of the seeming cruelty and conspiracy of the world, at least he might be on to something. The fact is that we live in a world where there are very few initiation rituals. There is no specific point (once again!) at which young people are sat down and told “This is how the world works. Get with the rules!” Instead, should they find themselves in a crackhouse, the psych ward, gaol, stuck in the misery of intergenerational welfare, fail at their creative goals or merely alone and addicted to the internet (I know many people who fit all these categories), even then is it rare for them to have a moment of understanding or instruction from others in which it is said ‘Ah, but you see, it is your own sovereign person that brought you here!” Strange indeed, but as to whether this realisation might flower into proper collective crisis is difficult to judge at present. In the end, perhaps the problem is that things are not yet bad enough to get people thinking.\n\nSome of the leftists get that something very wrong happened in the Space Age regarding the liberation of desire: Slavoj Žižek, Angela Nagel and the Zero Books crowd.[24] Perhaps really the problem was, to utilised the title of a famous book on the New Left – “without Marx or Jesus” – that they had no constructive idea about what they were doing. If I were forced to pick some side in things political today or cop a thrashing, I would have to pick our surly Zero Books “Laschian left” friends, even though they are materialists. Christopher Lasch’s Culture of Narcissism, once associated with conservatives, belongs to the Left now (if it wasn’t an Old Left work to begin with!). Mind you I know more than a few rightists who appreciate Horkheimer and Adorno’s “Critical Theory”.It’s probably so saturnine about culture and “authenticity” these days that it could only belong to a fuddy duddy. Perhaps our leftist friends will one day make it as far as Lasch’s Revolt of the Elites or Deneen’s “The Ignoble Lie” (which is frankly far better than the milquetoast Why Liberalism Failed) and say “Ah, the vampire’s castle!”[24] In time we may well live to hear people say “Well gosh, we were a little harsh on Allan Bloom, weren’t we? He was damn well right about Brown and the 60’s”. It would be hilarious.\n\nI am joking a little here, but as a young person I am certainly in no way fond of the conservatives who sided with “let the market system work” and thus seem to have conserved very little, and who, in quiet embarrassment, are now seeming to wonder if liberalism was always a monster and whether the “Benedict Option” might be a good idea. There we have it one more collective sin that occurred at some point that no one seems to know how to pinpoint. What are we to do? If we are to venture a definition of this “neo-liberal” animal, then yes, the core of it is the passing of oikonomia and providence from God to man and now to the three oikoi of immanent “systems: “let the market system work”, “nature will find a way”, “Moore’s law says…”. We speak often of this.\n\nBut perhaps we should say that it is also defined by an intense “horizontal gene transfer” – public institutions, from the universities to prisons, become businesses, and the capitalist monopolies and disposable celebrities want to be your “woke” moral guardians. It is on this account that we here on this blog can occasionally become suspicious that Moldbug way well have been a left liberal coming out of the future (see here and here). So too have old demarcations between zoe and bios, private and public life been melted down and had to be reterritorialised – “the personal is the political”, oh my, renders a society of little resentful units forever desiring to confess to the world in general, but there is no Political to be seen. This is all silly sooth – simple truth.\n\nWe are in quite a tangle, but in the end I think that I would have to side with Hilaire Belloc on this (it is time someone brought him back!). Let’s imagine Belloc knows about “accelerationism” so that he might be our contemporary. Capitalism is destructive of social bonds – the stuff is like battery acid. To end up in a world increasingly “servile” – regulated and contractualised to the hilt – is not surprising.[26] The rapid deterritorialisation of morals and social expectations by capital means that people cannot be trusted to treat their fellows with deference, or in any predictable manner. New moralities have to be invented and legislated for them.\n\nCertainly, crumbs of the New Left managed to ensconce themselves in certain positions to take advantage of this situation, but as a result they can only remain defensive, part of the katechontic “end of history” machine. How did obscure ideas like gay marriage and the Butlerian Jihad of DIY gender seep into mainstream acceptance so quickly? Because they were sold by technical writers to the public on the basis of “freedom of choice” far more than the idea that perhaps certain people are made in a certain manner and never got a choice. Welcome to fully automated luxury liberalism. As Platonists we must say of our queer friends, with the serious core of Aristophanes’ contribution to the Symposion in mind, that they are a glorious testament to the goodness and plenitudinousness of God, but their liberal processing, of course, is far from such.\n\nAll said and done I think that the problem with Kotsko’s book is that it would like to dismantle “freedom” and “choice” for the sake of social determinism, but it fails to take seriously the dark shadow of the nasty Christian thinkers like de Maistre in the corner, the sort of people who would claim that some people exist only to suffer for the sins of others, that God can “harden pharaoh’s heart” if it should please him, that the poor shall always be with us. Is it not a little heartening when some an-cap or conservative is caught actually saying “there will always be slaves” rather than it having to be squeezed out of them through hermeneutics of suspicion? Thus, Kotsko takes advantage of the accepted liberal belief in the magic of freedom and choice which no one reasonable would deny in order to reinforce the sacred victimology of those who do not gain access to this condition as “full men”. In the end this is a rather liberal sort of paradox. It does not go anywhere dangerous, even to fight with dangerous enemies.\n\nI am forever suspicious of “leftisms”, particularly those of the past fifty years, that seem to be little more than the 3d printing of the beastliness of liberalism’s “freedom” for everyone. However, this may well not apply to Kotsko with his emphasis on “living together” and to say so would be to do him a disservice. A blog post under the title “Economics cannot solve politics” suggests that he understands this well and regards communicative reason as paramount: “the very gesture of planning itself — collective planning not as a way of churning out more stuff, but as a way of taking collective responsibility for ourselves and the conditions of our life together.” What good might it do to grant everyone proper “choice” and allow them in as full members of “Here Comes Everyone”? This indeed would be giving everyone enough rope to hang themselves, the democratic society in which, as Plato said, everyone might vote themselves a state pension and never do anything ever again.\n\nWe Platonists on this blog are vicious devils – our “communism” expects a decent work ethic and devotion to others. I’ve talked about it here in detail. So too here regarding Alain Badiou’s Platonism a while back on VoegelinView. We also expect decent wholesome leadership – none of this Whig millennialist business sweating about anyone being over anyone else. Here of course Kotsko and myself are likely to diverge a great deal, just as say he likely would from Žižek., who would sooner prefer a benevolent totalitarian state than having to go to just so many daily council meetings. Sadly, however, we should be obliged to such things for our own and others’ good.\n\nI’ve been called a reactionary enough times, but seeing that I spend a great deal of time arguing with that lot, I think it is only fair to say that I have a reasonable grasp on how they think. The fashie mind, like the Whig mind, is structured like a language, conditioned by a great many political-theological problems. The core issue with the latter is that deep down it has very little aspiration except to become Rousseau’s lost “nature man” – some simian lump in a new artificial Eden, Kojève’s Last Men who build their nests out of instinct. Now, should human beings be worth a little more than this, it is imperative that “choice” and “freedom” should have to be drastically rethought to mean more than hedonism, for liberalism in its desire to neutralise both the Political and the Religious cannot lead anywhere else in the long run. And yet, in some small and beautiful corner, there are good “Christianity-shaped” parts of liberalism perhaps worth saving – its love for one’s fellow human beings, its desire for homonoia (concord) in the congregation. I spoke about these recently when I was arguing with some NRx-ers about the ideas of Voegelin.\n\nAs this is a Christian-Platonist blog, let us one more time ponderously repeat that the Platonic understanding of Eros is tripartite: there is noetic desire to know God and the nature of things; there is thymotic desire to be recognised that breaks forth in revolution; there is epithymotic desire to stuff you face. In a society in which such things all have a place (and God knows that the Political now may seem as fantastical as the Religious to a great many people) there should be more than enough freedom not to hang oneself and to be more than hedonists. This is even if such a society is doomed to entropy and decay towards mere epithymia and the Desire-Tyrant eventually. Of course no such society has ever existed outside of myth and allegory, but I am quite convinced that it remains the best ideation ever articulated, for all its desperate oddities such as keeping out the influences of foreigners, banning poets and selectively breeding people to try to pathetically hold back entropy.\n\nIn the end the core difference is that the freedom “trap” in Platonism is written into the very nature of the cosmos itself to the point that saving the coming of the Statesman, any restoration is largely impossible. There is no Nobodaddy evil Demiurge, only ignorance. Telling the difference between the Statesman, the Tyrant and the millenarian Dux e Babylone Anti-Christ (the return of Arthur!) would require a very precise wisdom that has always been very rare. Yet there is no Fall for which anyone might be retrojectively blamed, only the promise that everything is likely to get much, much worse because the plenitudinousness of creation demands that everything should get its own time under the sun. Only total resignation from the polis or Socratic service to it can overcome this eternal melancholy, whether it should be mixed with Christianity or otherwise.\n\nBoth Socrates and Christ spoke a great deal of the obligation they were under, that the “choice” had always-already been made. Yet both also consciously chose to be given enough rope to hang themselves – they could have ceased their work at any point but chose not to. Yet perhaps Girard is right in the end – only Christ “cancels the accusation” of wrong-doing entirely. Socrates knew he was guilty and so too must all other philosophers worth a damn, who, in the name of serving it, choose to stay in the polis and face the accusations of the society that raised them.\n\nYet the “old age of the world” always tempts the thinker to become millennialist prophet, does it not? As Cohn’s The Pursuit of the Millennium would tell us, this has been written into the political-theology of Western intellectuals and hermit prophetae since at least the Middle Ages (Joachim, Tanchelm, Eudes, Müntzer…).[27] As to where this dispositif, so we might call it, will go next – beyond the current cult of powerlessness that has arisen from a totalising lack of revolutionary subject and consciousness – perhaps no one may know.\n\nBertrand de Jouvenel may have been on to something with his theory of the alliance of the high and low against the middle – power’s “ally for all times is the common people”. [28] Jouvenel goes back as far as the Hundred Years War and the emergence of the modern liberal state, but I fear that in spite of Jouvenal’s new NRx friends complaining about the “Cathedral” of leftist intellectuals today, they nearly all manage to miss the deep time of this genealogy. They also manage to miss how constrained and miserable their menacing enemies are. The job of the propheta is indeed to unite the high with the low against the middle – to lay out the oracles that affirm the meek as the destructive hero of history, whether led to victory by the Dux or otherwise. The best the prophet seems to be able to do today is something like Kotsko, Coates or, and most especially, Franco Berardi’s Futurability – the embrace of old age, impotence and weakness in the immanent here and now as revolutionary in its own way. [29] God only knows if much can be done with that.\n\nIf the reactionaries would like to complain about just so many left liberals getting excited about inane culture war victories, immigration and tokenistic affirmative action schemes, then perhaps they like the liberals fail to see the much larger picture – that the liberal machine by nature opens up so that it might close all the better. It is forever letting in some from outside so that it might keep its image of progress alive and freshen up its elite. As I’ve said often before on this blog: if the katechon uses a little violence to keep out “worse” violence, then the messianic “end of history” katechon also bribes “progressives” with a little bit of weak messianic power in order to keep “worse” messianisms out. It is the odd case of a millenarian katechon, the oddest entity ever devised.\n\nNonetheless, Kotsko is very much correct that there is room for a political theology that includes the problems of racism. Kotsko lists several works on the topic as part of a political theology syllabus for his blog: Jared Hickman’s Black Prometheus, Alexander Weheliye’s Habaeus Viscus.[30] The first is especially good, I must say. Another work of note that is not mentioned and is admittedly very new, might be Terrence Keel’s Divine Variations: How Christian Thought Became Racial Science. Keel performs a masterly job of emphasising both the universalising and elect aspects of the Christian corpus mysticum and how these and biblical conceptions of race have influenced and continue to influence modern understandings of race in science. That should make Steven Pinker’s backside pucker and put the Fear of God up the NRx HBD fairy. Those bastard post-modernists ruining everything with….Christianity?\n\nHowever, these efforts remain within the sphere of American academic critical theory, which as well as being generally rather formulaic and lacklustre stuff, is also not the sort of thing which would even ask the question: why do we even think racism is bad? It is the nasty old habit of philosophy to question why self-evident things are so, and with the rise in the past few years of the “alt right” and so on, it seems only a matter of time before saying trite things about “we all bleed the same colour, man” are going to run out of the ability to convince anyone of anything except a bit of a laugh. Nazism, the great post-war negative legitimiser of moral progress, is so far away now that it is nought but “death and kitsch” from some distant dimension to many people. The Brotherhood of Man deserves a little more that this, I should think. Perhaps instead if a stirring appeal to human brotherhood could be articulated through the language and genealogy of Christianity, that ancestor of liberal progressivism and universalism, then maybe it might get somewhere. In short, I would like to read another book now – one that admits the history of the “Whig millennium” and the pursuit of universalism from at least John Ball’s “when Adam delved…” and Las Casas’s Destruction of the Indies to the present. Someone should write that. It needs to be said.\n\nNonetheless, at very least I think that we should be happy that political theology is going through somewhat of a renewal, seeing that just about all the other forms of critique, especially the various “–– studies” lot seem utterly moribund cut and paste stuff, delivered with all the expression and erudition of a Twitter bot. Let a thousand political theologies from left to right bloom, for perhaps some of them might find something sensible and just beyond the undead eschatological ideologies left over from last century, whether they return to religion or otherwise. The fact is, to reiterate, that until we have a proper obituary of the 20th c. and everyone owns up to their faults and decides that we would like to leave it and need to work together to do a better job, very little is going to happen. Perhaps this will simply take time. We are under obligation, at very least, to begin this process.\n\nAs a final remark it should be mentioned that Kotsko apparently has a book coming out in a few months solely on the political theology of neo-liberalism called Neoliberalism’s Demons.[31] I will be sure to read it, but I feel that though it may flap a great deal (as I often do!), I cannot imagine it getting anywhere. Nonetheless, I live in hope and thank Kotsko very much for his books.\n\nIn a coming review we will also look at Roberto Esposito’s Two: The Machine of Political Theology. In many ways this text overlaps with Kotsko’s problem of “neo-liberal man’s” assumed absolute sovereignty, but approaches the issue through a history of thinkers who have attempted to disrupt the idea of thought belonging to the individual “person”.\n\n[1] Giorgio Agamben, The Omnibus Homo Sacer, Stanford University Press, Stanford CA, 2017.\n\n[2] Idem,The Kingdom and the Glory: For a Theological Genealogy of Economy and Government, trans.
