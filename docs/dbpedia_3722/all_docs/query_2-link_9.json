        "text": "This weekend is the American Academy of Religion national conference in San Antonio. Unlike apparently the majority of my colleagues, I will be attending in person! I will be part of three sessions, only two of which are officially on the books. The two official sessions are as follows:\n\n“Capitalism, Dis-ease, and the Long Shadow of COVID-19” (Religion and Economy Unit), Monday, 12:30 PM-2:30 PM (Virtual) — a panel discussion on the impact of the pandemic on academic life.\n\n“Race and the Origins of Capitalism” (Theology and Continental Philosophy Unit), Monday, 5:00 PM-6:30 PM (In Person) — I will be presenting a paper entitled “The Political Theology of Silvia Federici.”\n\nIn addition, I will be pinch-hitting as a panelist for “Author Meets Critics: Marika Rose, A Theology of Failure: Žižek against Christian Innocence (Fordham University Press, 2019)” (Theology and Religious Reflection Unit), Sunday, 3:00 PM-4:30 PM (Virtual) — a discussion of a book I am spending a very enjoyable afternoon reviewing!\n\nI look forward to seeing some of you in person there — or, failing that, in little Brady Bunch boxes on my laptop as I sit in my hotel room.\n\nNext week I will be participating in a conference on Democracy and Theology, held virtually under the auspices of Yonsei University in South Korea. My paper will be entitled, “The Threat to ‘Our Democracy’ and the Neoliberal Crisis of Legitimacy.” A poster for the event follows."
