Where are Tim Burke, Adam Kotsko, and Scott McLemee? You know what happens when some people don't vote! Go over to the Koufax Awards and support la Belle! [Update: Kotsko has voted. Where are the other Cliopatriarchs? We need votes.]\n\nSontag: At last, for Susan Sontag, a fit farewell. Scott McLemee's\"The Mind as Passion\" at American Prospect is getting appropriate notice from: Crooked Timber, Maud Newton, MobyLives, and, well, Scott McLemee.\n\nCommon-Place: The new Common-Place is up! This issue emphasizes trans-Pacific trade. Edward Gray and Alan Taylor survey the possibilities in the Introduction. Particularly interesting looking: Peter Coclanis,\"Pacific Overtures: The Spanish Lake and the global economy, 1500-1800\" and John Demos,\"Viewpoints on the China Trade: A Young Nation Looks to the Pacific.\""
