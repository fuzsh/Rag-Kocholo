        "text": "In the wake of Biden’s withdrawal from the race and Kamala Harris’s shockingly rapid and decisive ascension, I have begun feeling emotions that I haven’t allowed myself to feel in connection to politics in a long time: hope, excitement, even enjoyment. As many commentators have noted, there is a joyfulness, even a level of fun, to Harris’s campaign that is an almost shocking contrast to what came before. The fact that they are playing along with the JD Vance couch meme may be the clearest sign that they are in tune with contemporary culture, but the more general pattern of calling conservative leaders “weird” and “creepy” feels like a major turning point — not just in terms of political tactics, but in terms of liberal political culture. It marks the end of a certain fatalistic defensiveness on the one hand, and also of the joylessly self-righteous habits of policing and shaming allies on the left.\n\nContinue reading ““Weird” conservatives and the end of whiny self-righteousness” →\n\nFor a long time, I’ve been reading comic books before bed. This habit kicked into high gear when I purchased an iPad — “officially” to help me organize my lecture notes and present them more organically (and it has been useful for that), but also to provide an easy way to read comics on my favorite pirate site. As I shared in my summer reading post, I made it through a huge chunk of Star Trek comics in the last several months. But my true comic book love is, of course, Green Lantern, so I have returned to that storied title more recently. While the stories I read were not “good” in any absolute sense, they were an interesting window into the rhythms of comic book publication and the emergence of an engaged fan culture.\n\nContinue reading “On Green Lantern/Green Arrow“ →\n\nI allowed myself a more restful summer than usual. I didn’t have any major writing projects, and I broke with my usual neurotic approach to class prep and largely left it aside for most of the summer. I mainly filled my time with miscellaneous reading. Since I’m now reaching a point where I need to focus more on class prep, I thought it would be fun to list what I’ve read so far this summer along with some brief reflections. (And rather than pile up all the books, I have included an image of the final display of the artwork we produced on our trip to Greece this summer.)\n\nContinue reading “My summer reading” →\n\nThis summer I have been working on an article comparing Paul and the Qur’an, which will build upon a conference presentation I gave last year on the same topic. In many ways, despite the fact that I have already written a version of the argument, this article has taken all summer — almost as long as the entire process of drafting my latest book, Late Star Trek. My ideas on the topic have naturally evolved over time, as I have expanded my range of comparisons and also recalibrated the framing of the argument in light of my intention to submit to a specialist journal rather than present to a generalist conference. But I only started actually writing this week. Almost all my work so far has been a task about which I am always profoundly ambivalent: engaging the literature.\n\nI have written about this topic elsewhere from a more polemical and programmatic perspective. There, however, my perspective was informed by my recent experience going through the peer review process for a very interdisciplinary book. This time around, I am coming off the experience of digging for a topic that I know to be virtually undiscussed, within a body of scholarly literature that I am only beginning to get a handle on. Continue reading “Engaging the Literature” →\n\nIn the wake of the attempted assassination of Trump, a common trope has reemerged: that of martyrdom. In the Financial Times, for example, Edward Luce opined, “It is not just Donald Trump who dodged a bullet. Half an inch to the left and the cartridge that grazed Trump’s ear would have turned him into a martyr. There is no telling what his death would have unleashed.” Certainly the latter is true — given the undeclared civil war Republicans are waging, it’s as easy to imagine a wave of retaliatory violence from the right as it is impossible to imagine anything to counter it from the left.\n\nWhat bothers me in this rhetoric is not the notion that political assassination is undesirable — I share that view. As a political theologian, I’m rankled by the simplistic magical thinking around the concept of “martyrdom.” As I’ve written before, there is no evidence that the violent death of an important leader automatically or even usually helps a movement.\n\nThe belief that this is the case not only represents a weird secularized hangover of Christian theological paradoxes. It also displays a profound misunderstanding of what leadership actually entails. Continue reading ““Use the Force, JD!”: On the Making of Martyrs” →\n\nThe last decade or so has been marked by a global resurgence of the extreme right. Its most prominent avatars in the West are the Brexit campaign and the Trump phenomenon, while various right-wing authoritarians (Putin, Modi, et al.) have dominated the scene in the post-Soviet world and Global South. There are exceptions and setbacks — like the very welcome surprise of yesterday’s French election! — but in the long run it seems like the extreme right has the wind in its sails and there is no clarity about how it could be stopped on a durable basis. Even in the French context, a once-in-a-generation collaboration across essentially all other political factions was necessary to keep RN out of power, and it still shattered previous records of electoral support and parliamentary representation. It was an important and necessary victory, but far from a final one.\n\nPart of the problem, in my view, are narratives that implicitly legitimate right-wing concerns, including some ostensibly coming from the left. Here Polyani provides the framework — the market keeps disrupting something called “society,” making people anxious and angry. Under neoliberalism, where the market has been given free rein to a much greater degree, this tendency is bound to increase. This is true as far as it goes, but it doesn’t account for why a right-wing answer in particular is appealing. So I’d like to displace the emphasis a bit. Yes, the neoliberal order is ultimately the cause of this dynamic, but not simply because of the disruptive effects of the market. The root problem is that neoliberalism has effectively eliminated the left wing of the political spectrum, meaning that the only apparent challenge to the system as it stands comes from the right. In other words, the political problem under neoliberalism is political, not narrowly economic.\n\nContinue reading “Why this keeps happening: On neoliberalism and the right-wing reaction” →\n\nBeatrice has a great post up today about what she calls the “theology of the now.” By this, she means the kind of rhetoric encapsulated in a well-known Flaming Lips song from around the peak of “living in the now”:\n\nAt one point in the show, they played the song “All We Have is Now”. Select lyrics were displayed on a massive screen behind the band, and the word “now” kept popping up in green and white. “You and me were never meant to be part of the future,” Coyne sang. “All we have is now,” he said, “All we’ve ever had is now.” And the sound all around us was triumphant, as if we were all supposed to be glorying in the now, together. This would have been the moment, in 2002, where I looked around me and felt like a failed experiment because I was out of time in my head, instead of living in the now with everyone. But 2024 me could only observe that the lines felt flat and lifeless, not to mention immediately and absolutely untrue.\n\nReporting that she had always felt alienated by that rhetoric, but simultaneously guilty for not resonating with it, Beatrice expresses relief that such sentiments now themselves sound so outdated. Who wants to live in this now? (Nonetheless, you should seize the moment and subscribe to her newsletter — she is one of my closest intellectual comrades and I’m sure you will enjoy her work if you enjoy mine.)\n\nThis post is going to be less a direct response than a riff on Beatrice’s idea. Instead of focusing on “being in the now” — a rhetoric that I always found to be vapid and nonsensical on its face, without experiencing the guilt she describes at my failed interpellation — I want to think about “being informed.” As you might have picked up, I’m becoming increasingly disillusioned with the way in which “being informed” is performed in the social media space.\n\nContinue reading “Out of joint” →\n\nA few years ago, I was part of an event commemorating Milton Friedman’s Capitalism and Freedom. Obviously, I was brought in to represent the “against” position (and you can read a version of my keynote here). I didn’t get along well with my fellow speaker, who seemed to view every interaction as a competition, and that perhaps contributed to a tirade I launched during our joint Q&A session. We had been talking about the many and growing number of ways that the will of the people has been thwarted — gerrymandering, the Senate fillibuster, the Electoral College, the unaccountable power of the Supreme Court, all of which were being exacerbated and entrenched and promised to become moreso if Donald Trump ever regained office. Inevitably, a student asked, if all the legitimate democratic means for creating change are cut off, what are we supposed to do? Are you advocating violence?\n\nI responded that I was not advocating violence, but I was pointing out that the Republicans are creating a situation in which the vast majority of people have no non-violent ways of creating the kind of society they want to live in. And so I asked, with an increasingly preacherly cadence, “What do they think is going to happen?”\n\nContinue reading “What do they think is going to happen?” →\n\nIt’s been almost a year since I officially quit Twitter. Since then, I have been making do with Bluesky, which is basically a Twitter clone that is not directly owned by Elon Musk. Users of Bluesky (pronounced, in my mind, to rhyme with “brewski”) tend to joke that it is like methadone for Twitter addicts, and that is how it has functioned for me. It allows me to indulge my habit of externalizing distracting thoughts and to vent about political events, but it is ultimately too slow, too empty, to support the kind of endless doomscrolling that allowed Twitter to swallow up hours at a time.\n\nBut that abruptly changed after Joe Biden’s disastrous debate performance, which raised the prospect of his withdrawal from the presidential race and even his resignation from office in elite media and political circles. I will say up front that I don’t know whether Biden should withdraw or resign, nor how or by whom he should be replaced. As far as I can tell, no one is asking me, nor proposing any means by which Democratic voters could weigh in on this topic at all. Whatever happens, even though it will doubtless draw on public opinion data in some way, will be a fully intra-elite decision — and ultimately the decision of one man, namely Joe Biden.\n\nNeedless to say, then, the almost uniformly left-liberal denizens of Bluesky set to work vociferously debating what should happen.

We knew that this tale of a sassy teenage detective was something special from the first episode and also knew we were wasting it as it blended into the excessive consumption of that sad era in all our lives — sandwiched between Tiger King, Murder Ballet, Courteney Cox Drinks Alarming Amounts of Wine, Chess Girl, Warrior Nun, and all the other masterworks we sat through as we Tried Not to Think About it.\n\nSo we recently started Veronica Mars over from the beginning, much earlier than we usually allow ourselves a rewatch, and loved it unconditionally.
