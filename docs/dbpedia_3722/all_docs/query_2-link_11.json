        "text": "If the 1990s were the age of irony, our just expired decade will surely go down in history as the age of awkwardness. Sacha Baron Cohen's career in inciting this feeling began in 2000 and continued throughout the decade. Ricky Gervais provided more inspiration with the first series of The Office in 2001. Larry David started his cringe-inducing Curb Your Enthusiasm in 2000. Three years later came Arrested Development, a show whose comfort with discomfort extended even to incest jokes. The even more excruciatingly awkward Peep Show has capped off a decade that found the viewing public eager to expose themselves to awkwardness as a form of entertainment.\n\nThis trend is odd, because awkwardness is normally thought to be something to avoid. What does it mean that people have been seeking it out?\n\nAwkwardness is the feeling of discomfort or anxiety that accompanies a disruption in social norms. It might stem from the violation of those norms by a particular person, as when someone tells a racist joke and no one knows how to respond, or from the collision of two incompatible sets of norms, as when David Brent brings the quest for reality show celebrity to the workplace.\n\nFinally, and most troublingly, it could afflict us in a situation where there simply are no clear norms. It is tempting to view awkwardness as the fault of particularly graceless individuals, but it is a fundamentally social phenomenon. It occurs in social settings and it is triggered by the violation or absence of clear social expectations.\n\nMore importantly, the experience of awkwardness itself is intrinsically social. When we are afflicted with it, we feel more acutely the presence (and judgment) of other people, as we can see in the panicked inner monologues of Peep Show. Awkwardness also spreads: when we witness an awkward scene, we feel awkward as well.\n\nThe violation or absence of the kinds of norms we rely on to get through social interactions creates a weird kind of social bond. And it's a good thing, because otherwise we'd increasingly have no social bond at all. Social norms have steadily eroded throughout the postwar period, particularly in the wake of the upheaval of the 1960s. Those acts of rebellion against the racial and sexual order did not put anything stable in its place. As a result we have a social order that has been much more successful in telling us what we're doing wrong than in giving us a convincing idea of what it would mean to do it right.\n\nThis situation was easy enough to tolerate when the social order was delivering a baseline of material security. But in western countries the promise of a steady job has proved ever more elusive. Instead of a given, the material benefits of the social order are presented as a privilege that can be revoked. (It is no accident that redundancies loom in the first series of The Office.)\n\nIn the age of awkwardness, then, the costs associated with clear expectations have even come to outweigh the benefits. We can see this dynamic at work in the popularity of Mad Men, whose characters gain stability by settling for boredom and loneliness.\n\nIs it any wonder that people are drawn to awkwardness, that strange social bond that takes place outside the realm of normal social constraints? In an era where social norms can only tell us no, should we be surprised if people enjoy saying no to social norms themselves?\n\nIf the bond of awkwardness is more intense than a social encounter mediated by social norms, it also holds the potential to be more meaningful and enjoyable. It can even provide a way forward that avoids the pitfalls of isolation and hierarchy seen in Mad Men. The enjoyment of awkwardness allows the possibility of actually identifying with those that social orders seek to exclude.\n\nIn one episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Larry is at a restaurant where the chef has Tourette syndrome. When an obscene outburst silences all the customers, Larry tries to make the situation better by yelling out obscenities himself, prompting other customers to do the same. The result is a joyful experience of awkwardness, where everyone identifies with the person who has violated social expectations.\n\nIf things like that happened more often, the world would be a better place. At its best, awkward humour is more than entertainment â€“ it is a lesson in solidarity."
