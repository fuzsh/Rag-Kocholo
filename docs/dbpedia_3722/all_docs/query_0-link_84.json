        "text": "The Human Condition\n\nBy Hannah Arendt,\n\nFrom my list on birth, one of our greatest underexplored subjects.\n\nBy Jennifer Banks Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up in a family that was focused on people, poetry, and politics. My parents both worked with children with disabilities in Massachusetts and my mother ran a daycare center in our house. As a reader, student, poet, and then editor, I’ve drawn on those experiences and expectations, and have searched through books looking for their echoes. Since 2007, I've edited books at Yale University Press where I'm currently Senior Executive Editor. I have a BA from Cornell University and an MFA in Creative Writing from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop. I've also worked in various publishing roles at ICM, Continuum, and Harvard University Press.\n\nJennifer's book list on birth, one of our greatest underexplored subjects\n\nWhy did Jennifer love this book?\n\nFirst published in 1958, this is one of Hannah Arendt’s most influential books and in it she attempts to define the human condition in the aftermath of World War II, developing her concept “natality.”\n\nIt’s a challenging book that I’ve wrestled with and argued with and never forgotten. It includes some of her most powerful and frequently cited passages about birth. Lately, I’ve been returning to its opening pages, in which she discusses the launch of Sputnik into space.\n\nShe saw this launch not as an exciting technological breakthrough, but as a fateful repudiation of our earthly existence, an existence that was defined by birth with possibilities and limitations.\n\nBy Hannah Arendt,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n4 authors picked The Human Condition as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe past year has seen a resurgence of interest in the political thinker Hannah Arendt, \"the theorist of beginnings,\" whose work probes the logics underlying unexpected transformations-from totalitarianism to revolution.\n\nA work of striking originality, The Human Condition is in many respects more relevant now than when it first appeared in 1958. In her study of the state of modern humanity, Hannah Arendt considers humankind from the perspective of the actions of which it is capable. The problems Arendt identified then-diminishing human agency and political freedom, the paradox that as human powers increase through technological and humanistic inquiry, we are…\n\nPreview\n\nPunishing the Poor\n\nBy Loïc Wacquant,\n\nFrom my list on how neoliberalism f*&ks up democracy.\n\nBy Jacqueline Kennelly Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI came to activism at a young age, inspired by a book given to me by a friend in Grade 10. I also grew up poor; my trajectory into university was unusual for my demographic, a fact I only discovered once I was doing my PhD in the sociology of education. By the time I started interviewing activists for my doctorate, I had a burning desire to understand how social change could happen, what democracy really looked like, and who was left out of participating. I am still trying to figure these things out. If you are, too, the books on this list might help!\n\nJacqueline's book list on how neoliberalism f*&ks up democracy\n\nWhy did Jacqueline love this book?\n\nWacquant was educated in France, under Pierre Bourdieu. He brings his French sensibilities and training to the United States, asking fundamental questions about the massive inequality there, how it came to be, and who it is serving. This is one of the books he has written in answer to those questions. I started teaching chapters from this book in a graduate seminar on Urban Inequality. No other scholar does such a precise job of tracing the connections between neoliberalism and inequality in the USA, which pushes poor Black men into prison and poor Black women into the welfare office. It is a sobering but powerful read that really helps you understand how neoliberalism is lived by those who suffer the most under its auspices.\n\nBy Loïc Wacquant,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Punishing the Poor as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nThe punitive turn of penal policy in the United States after the acme of the Civil Rights movement responds not to rising criminal insecurity but to the social insecurity spawned by the fragmentation of wage labor and the shakeup of the ethnoracial hierarchy. It partakes of a broader reconstruction of the state wedding restrictive \"workfare\" and expansive \"prisonfare\" under a philosophy of moral behaviorism. This paternalist program of penalization of poverty aims to curb the urban disorders wrought by economic deregulation and to impose precarious employment on the postindustrial proletariat. It also erects a garish theater of civic morality on…\n\nPreview\n\nPractical Reason\n\nBy Pierre Bourdieu, Randall Johnson (translator),\n\nFrom my list on how neoliberalism f*&ks up democracy.\n\nBy Jacqueline Kennelly Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI came to activism at a young age, inspired by a book given to me by a friend in Grade 10.

He has a sexy mind. Unfortunately, he passed away just as I was getting to know his work, back in 2002. Bourdieu wrote a mind-boggling number of books, but I have chosen this one as a good introduction for people who’d like to get to know his work. Practical Reason is actually made up of a series of lectures, all written relatively late in his career. They do quite a good job of accessibly summarizing his key ideas. Bourdieu supported the anti-globalization movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s, and was a vociferous critic of neoliberalism. Bourdieu’s work helps to explain how inequality is recreated across generations, and why dominant interests tend to shape the trajectory of the state.\n\nBy Pierre Bourdieu, Randall Johnson (translator),\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Practical Reason as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nDo social classes really exist? Is disinterested action really possible? What do the family, the church, and the intellectual world have in common? Can morality be founded on hypocrisy? What is the \"subject\" of action? In this new volume, one of France's foremost social thinkers of our time responds to these major questions and to others, thus tracing the outlines of a work that could be called \"Pierre Bourdieu by himself.\"\n\nIn these texts, the author tries to go to the essential, that is, the most elementary and fundamental, questions. He thereby explains the philosophical principles that have led to…\n\nPreview\n\nExpulsions\n\nBy Saskia Sassen,\n\nFrom my list on how neoliberalism f*&ks up democracy.\n\nBy Jacqueline Kennelly Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI came to activism at a young age, inspired by a book given to me by a friend in Grade 10. I also grew up poor; my trajectory into university was unusual for my demographic, a fact I only discovered once I was doing my PhD in the sociology of education. By the time I started interviewing activists for my doctorate, I had a burning desire to understand how social change could happen, what democracy really looked like, and who was left out of participating. I am still trying to figure these things out. If you are, too, the books on this list might help!\n\nJacqueline's book list on how neoliberalism f*&ks up democracy\n\nWhy did Jacqueline love this book?\n\nThe important argument lying at the heart of this beautifully written book is that the trajectory of the current global economy, driven by neoliberal logics, is fundamentally one of expulsions: that is, expelling the poor, the biosphere, democracy, and anything else that gets in the way of maximizing profit. This book takes massive case studies—from palm oil production in Malaysia and Indonesia to water bottling by large corporations in the US—and demonstrates how they are ultimately about pushing people out instead ofinviting people in. It raises important questions about who the economy is for, and what ends we are ultimately building toward as a global society. I don’t have a pithy personal story about this book; I just think you should read it.\n\nBy Saskia Sassen,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Expulsions as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nSoaring income inequality and unemployment, expanding populations of the displaced and imprisoned, accelerating destruction of land and water bodies: today's socioeconomic and environmental dislocations cannot be fully understood in the usual terms of poverty and injustice, according to Saskia Sassen. They are more accurately understood as a type of expulsion-from professional livelihood, from living space, even from the very biosphere that makes life possible.\n\nThis hard-headed critique updates our understanding of economics for the twenty-first century, exposing a system with devastating consequences even for those who think they are not vulnerable. From finance to mining, the complex types of knowledge…\n\nPreview\n\nThe Old Is Dying and the New Cannot Be Born\n\nBy Nancy Fraser,\n\nFrom my list on moving through the city with newly critical eyes.\n\nBy Leah Modigliani Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nSince the age of seven, I've been conscious of the need to bypass how one is supposed to do things. I realized then that my grandmother could not pursue a writing career because she was also a woman and a wife; a cautionary tale I took to heart since I was already beginning to identify as an artist. I'm driven to uncover how we recognize what we see, and how forces beyond our control engender or foreclose upon new ways of being in the world. A professional life lived in the arts has allowed the fullest flexibility for exploring these ideas as one is generally encouraged to think differently.\n\nLeah's book list on moving through the city with newly critical eyes\n\nWhy did Leah love this book?\n\nThis pocket-sized book of a mere 63 pages can be read in a couple of hours and has a lasting impact.\n\nFraser, a feminist philosopher I was lucky to take a class with once in graduate school, explains the political and economic conditions that frame the near-constant anxiety one feels daily as witnesses to near-constant national and global crises.\n\nWe are all living through a “hegemonic gap;” that is, a profoundly unsettling transformation between the failure of agreed upon political authorities (she labels this progressive neoliberalism) and the lack of any clear future direction. In the mix is the global rise of proto-fascist populism, environmental disaster, increasing wealth gaps, and violence and war.\n\nWhat can guide us out of this mess? That is the subject of the last few pages…\n\nBy Nancy Fraser,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked The Old Is Dying and the New Cannot Be Born as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nAcross the globe politics as usual are being rejected and faith in neoliberalism is fracturing beyond repair. Leading political theorist Nancy Fraser, in conversation with Jacobin publisher Bhaskar Sunkara, dissects neoliberalism's current crisis and argues that we might wrest new futures from its ruins.\n\nThe global political, ecological, economic, and social breakdown-symbolized, but not caused, by Trump's election-has destroyed faith that neoliberal capitalism is beneficial to the majority. Fraser explores how this faith was built through the late twentieth century by balancing two central tenets: recognition (who deserves rights) and distribution (who deserves income). When these began to fray, new…\n\nPreview\n\nUndoing the Demos\n\nBy Wendy Brown,\n\nFrom my list on understanding neoliberalism.\n\nBy Adam Kotsko Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI grew up outside of Flint, Michigan, which during my lifetime went from being a pretty nice place to live to being a perpetual basket case that still doesn’t have clean water. I’ve always been very concerned with the question of what went wrong, and very early in my graduate education, it became clear to me that the neoliberal agenda that started under Reagan has been at the root of the economic rot and destruction that has afflicted Flint and so many other places. That personal connection, combined with my background in theology, makes me well-suited to talk about how political belief systems “hook” us, even when they hurt us.\n\nAdam's book list on understanding neoliberalism\n\nWhy did Adam love this book?\n\nMore than most authors on neoliberalism, Brown takes it seriously as a philosophy and worldview that aims to reshape human society and our individual sense of self. Drawing on classic philosophers like Aristotle, Marx, and Arendt, she argues that neoliberalism is hollowing our sense of what it means to be human by turning us all into hyper-competitive, self-marketing, self-branding drones. I wind up arguing with her a lot in my book, but whether you wind up agreeing or disagreeing with her, she’s an essential point of reference.\n\nBy Wendy Brown,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Undoing the Demos as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNeoliberal rationality ― ubiquitous today in statecraft and the workplace, in jurisprudence, education, and culture ― remakes everything and everyone in the image of homo oeconomicus. What happens when this rationality transposes the constituent elements of democracy into an economic register? In vivid detail, Wendy Brown explains how democracy itself is imperiled.\n\nThe demos disintegrates into bits of human capital; concerns with justice cede to the mandates of growth rates, credit ratings, and investment climates; liberty submits to the imperative of human capital appreciation; equality dissolves into market competition; and popular sovereignty grows incoherent. Liberal democratic practices may not survive…\n\nPreview\n\nHow Democracies Die\n\nBy Steven Levitsky, Daniel Ziblatt,\n\nFrom my list on populism from an economist and politician.\n\nBy Andrew Leigh Author\n\nWhy am I passionate about this?\n\nI’m a former economics professor and a member of the Australian Parliament. I’ve written over ten books on policy, politics, and economics. As someone who enjoys fresh ideas, believes in kindness over hate, loves democracy, and thrives on international engagement, I’m deeply concerned about the rise of populism and the risk that it spills into authoritarianism. Only by understanding the causes and consequences of populism can we help address the threat and shape a fairer, more prosperous, and safer world.\n\nAndrew's book list on populism from an economist and politician\n\nWhy did Andrew love this book?\n\nWhile some dictators grab power through violent coups, a surprising number of authoritarian leaders initially won power through the ballot box. Levitsky and Ziblatt’s book tells the story of authoritarian populists such as Hugo Chávez in Venezuela and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey, who won elections and then eroded democratic norms and institutions.\n\nIn many cases, populist authoritarians subvert democracy not by overtly breaking the law but by gradually weakening institutional checks and balances. Populists exploit societal divisions and erode democratic norms by portraying themselves as the true voice of the people while demonizing opponents as illegitimate.\n\nBy Steven Levitsky, Daniel Ziblatt,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n6 authors picked How Democracies Die as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\n'The most important book of the Trump era' The Economist\n\nHow does a democracy die?\n\nWhat can we do to save our own?\n\nWhat lessons does history teach us?\n\nIn the 21st century democracy is threatened like never before.\n\nDrawing insightful lessons from across history - from Pinochet's murderous Chilean regime to Erdogan's quiet dismantling in Turkey - Levitsky and Ziblatt explain why democracies fail, how leaders like Trump subvert them today and what each of us can do to protect our democratic rights.\n\n'This book looks to history to provide a guide for defending democratic norms when they are…\n\nPreview\n\nA Brief History of Neoliberalism\n\nBy David Harvey,\n\nWhy did Dawn love this book?\n\nTo be honest, I could’ve picked any book by David Harvey–he writes about capitalism and how it affects people and the places we inhabit in a really accessible way. This brief introduction is a great way to get into his writing (a gateway book!). It is also a useful guide to thinking about contemporary issues with hope rather than despair.\n\nLike the book by Ahmed, this one offers ideas for a socially just society, giving the reader solutions and not just problems. I think it is important when critiquing society to come up with tangible ways that we can move away from unequal systems to more equitable ones. This book makes change feel possible.\n\nBy David Harvey,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n3 authors picked A Brief History of Neoliberalism as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nNeoliberalism - the doctrine that market exchange is an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide for all human action - has become dominant in both thought and practice throughout much of the world since 1970 or so.\n\nIts spread has depended upon a reconstitution of state powers such that privatization, finance, and market processes are emphasized. State interventions in the economy are minimized, while the obligations of the state to provide for the welfare of its citizens are diminished. David Harvey, author of 'The New Imperialism' and 'The Condition of Postmodernity', here tells the political-economic story of…\n\nPreview\n\nPenis Envy and Other Bad Feelings\n\nBy Mari Ruti,\n\nWhy did Todd love this book?\n\nAlthough Ruti’s book is not directly about capitalism, it includes perhaps the best psychoanalytic proposal of confronting the imperatives of capitalist society that I have ever read. Ruti discusses how sexism operates within capitalism primarily in the book, but her point is always about how concepts from psychoanalysis that seem retrograde—such as penis envy—can actually be the basis for a critique of capitalism and sexism.\n\nBy Mari Ruti,\n\nWhy should I read it?\n\n1 author picked Penis Envy and Other Bad Feelings as one of their favorite books, and they share why you should read it.\n\nWhat is this book about?\n\nMari Ruti combines theoretical reflection, cultural critique, feminist politics, and personal experience to analyze the prevalence of bad feelings in contemporary everyday life. Proceeding from a playful engagement with Freud's idea of penis envy, Ruti's autotheoretical commentary fans out to a broader consideration of neoliberal pragmatism. She focuses on the emphasis on good performance, high productivity, constant self-improvement, and relentless cheerfulness that characterizes present-day Western society. Revealing the treacherousness of our fantasies of the good life, particularly the idea that our efforts will eventually be rewarded-that things will eventually get better-Ruti demystifies the false hope that often causes us to…\n\nPreview"
