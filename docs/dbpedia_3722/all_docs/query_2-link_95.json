        "text": "Hello friends,\n\nIt‚Äôs Sunday night and I‚Äôm at home, feeling a bit under the weather. It‚Äôs Super Bowl night, which I know mostly because it‚Äôs quiet on Twitter and all the memes are about Taylor Swift. I ponder how far my path has been diverging from mainstream life. I‚Äôve long ago covered my TV with a white sheet and I‚Äôm spending the evening reading Alan Watts and trying one more time to finish a piece for the Substack. It‚Äôs not coming together.\n\nLife has been intense and strange lately. In some ways I feel incredibly stuck, wrestling with the way forward. I have a pile of drafts that my mind refuses to work on. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs telling me that, yes, there‚Äôs an important kernel here, but it‚Äôs not ready yet. Revisit this when you find the missing piece. It‚Äôs a strange kind of writer‚Äôs block.\n\nMy inner life on the other hand has been unfolding rapidly and in volatile ways. There‚Äôs been an exhaustive unraveling that has wrecked my sleep. Things spilled out of the intestines of my history that, after some rest, I will have to process through creative work. In other words, the ladder of my life is in desperate need of realignment.\n\nReading for Pleasure\n\nI find comfort in reading, an increasingly rare experience.\n\nFor most of my career, I assigned around 30 pages of reading per class meeting as a baseline expectation ‚Ä¶ Now students are intimidated by anything over 10 pages and seem to walk away from readings of as little as 20 pages with no real understanding. Even smart and motivated students struggle to do more with written texts than extract decontextualized take-aways. ‚Äî professor Adam Kotsko\n\nI get it. Our dopamine systems are fried. Video and social media have won. Everyone has ADD... But what a loss.\n\nBut as I was writing this post, it dawned on me that I have the rare freedom to read mostly for pleasure. I follow my curiosity, at my own pace. Lately, it‚Äôs been Dante‚Äôs Divine Comedy which I consume in small increments of a couple of cantos a day. That‚Äôs a joy that social media, addictive as it is, can‚Äôt compete with. The allure of a great book is overpowering when your mind wants to read.\n\nWhat social media is destroying is our capacity to read when and what we should. This is why focus is a superpower and why I can‚Äôt imagine going back to a job and being told what to pay attention to. I‚Äôd rather adopt a cat and retreat to the mountains with my instruments and books.\n\nBooks are really the only thing I spend on without second thought. When I fall down a new rabbit hole, it looks like I‚Äôm overspending. I get so excited that I buy stacks of them, following the references made by my new favorite authors. It all looks inefficient and indulgent.\n\nInefficient because my process is a surrender to open exploration. Some books remain forever unread. Others I abandon after a few chapters. I simply trust that the right connections will appear, and that long-dead authors emerge and guide me. This requires a certain risk budget for attention. It‚Äôs indulgent because it would be cheaper to do this slowly at the library. There would be less friction if I read on the computer or Kindle, one book at a time. However, in the beginning, I have no clue which books will turn out to be the important ones. I don‚Äôt know which page will reveal the key to unlock the door to an entire universe.\n\nWhen I find that kind of book, I have to be able to work with it. I need to parse it, highlight it, and let it work on me. Great books have ideas seeping out of them like thick honey. They transform you, page by page. They give you the eerie feeling that they were written for you, that they‚Äôve been waiting patiently on some dusty shelf to become your teachers. They let you tap into an eternal conversation, you feel a subtle flow come alive and carry you.\n\nTo write that kind of book is a writer‚Äôs Ozymandias. It‚Äôs a chance to pick up the tapestry of human culture, woven by each successive generation, feel it strain against the sands of time, and add a piece of yourself to it. It‚Äôs your chance to return to stardust and add one note to our collective song. What else could you ask for?\n\nThank you for reading,\n\nFrederik\n\nShare\n\nBeyond Words: Practices and Events\n\nIn The Paradox of Happiness, I mused about the ‚Äòshame of abundance‚Äô ‚Äî the notion that we must suffer quietly through the epidemics of our immensely rich society for any complaints could make us look like ungrateful luddites or communists. However, our saturated, distracted, and divided society struggles with quite a lot, including a lack of meaning, loneliness, the dating quagmire, and rampant addiction (not to mention the ‚Äòreal‚Äô crises like climate, AI, cold wars, hot wars, and the war for your attention). Despite its physical comforts, the present has become profoundly discomforting and disorienting.\n\nThis leads to an obvious question: ‚Äònow what‚Äô? What is there to be done beyond diagnosis, beyond more content? That‚Äôs a question I want to explore further this year.\n\nThe complement to content is action. Beyond the word is taking action through specific practices. Beyond the abstract world of the word lies the concrete impact of spaces that facilitate shared experience, exploration, and connection.\n\nThe first time this idea stuck with me was when I heard John Vervaeke talk about having an ‚Äòecology of practices‚Äô ‚Äî a collection of routines and exercises that help cultivate wisdom, connection, and meaning. For Vervaeke it has been Vipassana meditation, metta, and Tai Chi. To become an ecology, the practices need to ‚Äúguard you against self-deceptive bullshit,‚Äù they need to complement each other and lead you to balance and wholeness\n\nVervaeke also mused that these practices are key to answering the meaning crisis, in particular if the practices and experiences are shared.\n\nThe solution to the meaning crisis and nihilism is not to brow people with argument or legislation. It‚Äôs to enable them to fall in love with the depths of reality within and without and between.\n\nThat‚Äôs why I am starting this new format in this ‚Äòjournal‚Äô section. I will share reflections on my journey and keep you up to date on events and practices that I find helpful. I would also like to make it an open ‚Äòspace‚Äô for you to share whatever is on your mind ‚Äî questions, comments, anything you‚Äôve been reading or pondering recently, anything that helped you escape the midwit trap and is worth sharing with other readers. Put it in the comments!\n\nPractices\n\nDon‚Äôt tell me what you believe, tell me what you practice. ‚Äî John Vervaeke\n\nThis section was inspired by the Huberman Protocols account which extracts ideas and methods from the well-known podcast. I want to start collecting bits and pieces of practices that can be the bridge between content and action, between understanding and changing lives.\n\nTom Morgan just touched on this in his latest must-read piece on cultivating wisdom, finding flow, and balancing the brain hemispheres.\n\nWisdom may be the most important thing, and metis may be the essential quality that can cultivate it. The last people to understand this will be the first ones left behind over the next few years.\n\nThat cultivation requires an ecology of practices.\n\nRiver Kenna framed these practices as an answer to issues arising from an imbalanced life, such as:\n\nemotional detachment.\n\nrelational detachment.\n\nloss of a sense of meaning.\n\na feeling that you're watching your life in the 3rd person, rather than living it in the 1st person.\n\n‚Ä¶ loss of spontaneity, aliveness, awe, wonder.\n\nThese are exactly the kinds of things I‚Äôve been wrestling with over the past few years.\n\nLong before I found my practices, I spent an entire year with one of my therapists repeatedly answering the question ‚Äúhow do you feel about that?‚Äù with ‚Äúwhat are you talking about, I‚Äôm not feeling anything, let me tell you what I think.‚Äù That year was important because it showed me that I did, indeed, feel things. But it also led me to the limits of talk therapy. To re-connect you have to get out of the head.\n\nI believe there are a lot more relevant practices (including acts of service/charity/teaching, time in nature, worship/prayer, and other embodied flow states such as dance, martial arts, singing/chanting). I suspect they‚Äôre key to answering the paradox of happiness, marshmallow mind, tapping into the creative unconscious, cultivating resilience and longevity, and even to the larger social crises ailing our secular and atomized world. I‚Äôll share more in a dedicated post.\n\nBreathing practices are one part of my ecology. The umbrella term is breathwork which I‚Äôm not fond of ‚Äî who wants to do more work? It‚Äôs a deep and ancient rabbit hole with a variety of lineages and approaches and many wonderful teachers. I‚Äôll be sharing a post covering one of my experiences soon. Until then, I recommend this short clip of Rick Rubin and Huberman practicing ‚Äòcoherence breathing‚Äô (based on this guided video), the ‚Äòideal‚Äô breathing pace of 5.5 second inhales followed by 5.5 second exhales using the nose. It‚Äôs an excellent way to calm yourself down, find stillness, or start a conversation by synchronizing breathing.\n\nEvents\n\nAs a reminder, I‚Äôve offered premium subscribers a chance to grab a coffee here in NYC. So far, I‚Äôve met with a few and we talked about life, writing, meditation, money, mentors, heartbreak, career changes, substack, and everything in between. If you‚Äôre interested, fill out the questionnaire. Please be patient ‚Äî I had like a two-week personal crisis and illness and had to reschedule with a few people already.\n\nI am also working on hosting a new series of in-person events. Some will consist of practices that have been instrumental in my journey, including sound, breath, meditation, journaling (ways to ‚Äògo deep‚Äô and connect with your body and unconscious source of intuition and creativity). Other events may be more focused on conversation/sharing or include guest teachers. I‚Äôm also interested in everything to do with the voice (talk about a powerful way to connect with yourself and develop presence).\n\nI will mention upcoming events here on the substack but since they‚Äôre local I won‚Äôt be sending out extra reminders to the entire list.\n\nIf you live in New York and are interested specifically in attending local events, you can add your contact details to this separate list to get notified.\n\nReading\n\nRiver Kenna on metis, The One Essential Quality, a ‚Äúparticular quality of intense alertness that can be effortlessly aware of everything at once‚Äù (Peter Kingsley).\n\nThe few places where some kind of metis is still encouraged, or at least where its development isn‚Äôt suspect, are in domains like the arts, sports, and spirituality. ‚Ä¶ For so many people, these are the only places in their lives where they can find that core human birthright: flow, metis, intuitive competence that shades into effortless mastery; like how a bird, in its moments of truest flight, must lose the feeling that it is riding the wind, and melt into the sense that he has joined the wind.\n\nThe ‚Äúpursuit of metis,‚Äù he writes, ‚Äúhas to court risk.‚Äù\n\nIf you don‚Äôt have the ocean waiting to crush you, or a puma stalking you through the forest, you have to manufacture your own sense of stakes, of generative urgency. It‚Äôs a functional ingredient in the dynamic.\n\nSounds a lot like investing and entrepreneurship, doesn‚Äôt it?\n\nJared Dillianpublished a new book, No Worries, a fresh and entertaining take on personal finance. Jared pushes back against the ‚Äòpersonal finance orthodoxy‚Äô and its emphasis on extreme thrift. Instead, he focuses on life‚Äôs big financial decisions, including marriage, college, home buying, and career. He advocates for a middle way of financial responsibility and a healthy relationship with money. Recommended for anyone who needs to get their financial house in order, advising people on personal finance, or who raises/educates young adults who face major financial decisions.\n\nFinally, for the passionate note-takers among you, check out Jillian Hess‚Äôs wonderful substack Noted. I loved this post about Eminem and his relationship to words, rhyme, meaning, and writing.\n\nEminem claims he has a ‚Äúrhyming disease.‚Äù He explains, ‚ÄúIn my head everything rhymes.‚Äù But he won‚Äôt remember his rhymes if he doesn‚Äôt write them down. And he‚Äôll use any available surface to record them.\n\nEminem thinks of rap as a puzzle; all the rhymes he‚Äôs amassed in his notes are the pieces. He just has to fit them together."
