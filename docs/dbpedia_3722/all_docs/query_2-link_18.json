We have just enough freedom to make us blameworthy if we fail or if we choose wrong, but not enough freedom to make a significant difference in the system. So I view it as a kind of moral entrapment.\n\nWriter Adam Kotsko explains how neoliberalism swallowed the world - selling a compromised version of freedom for the price of a life in isolation and precarity, robbing politics of the promise of collective action or universal ideals, and imposing its own cruel moral logic deep in the brains of its subjects."
