        "text": "Surprisingly, until now there has never been an empirical study of “creepiness.” An international sample of 1341 individuals responded to an online survey. Males were perceived as being more likely to be creepy than females, and females were more likely to associate sexual threat with creepiness. Unusual nonverbal behavior and characteristics associated with unpredictability were also predictors of creepiness, as were some occupations and hobbies. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that being “creeped out” is an evolved adaptive emotional response to ambiguity about the presence of threat that enables us to maintain vigilance during times of uncertainty.\n\nIn this article, following a trajectory set out by Noël Carroll, Matt Hills, and Andrea Sauchelli, I propose a definition of horror, according to which something qualifies as a work of horror if and only if it centrally and demonstrably aims at provoking one or more of a particular set of negative affects. A catalog of characteristically negative affects is associated with horror—including terror, revulsion, the uncanny, and the abject—but which cannot be collapsed into any single affect. Further complicating matters is that the set appears to be constantly, if slowly, mutating, so that the affects aimed at in the horror of the 1920s do not entirely overlap with those aimed at horror today, or which we might expect horror to aim at a century from now. As such, while we use “horror” as a blanket term across eras, whether some work is a work of horror will always be time-indexed.\n\nCreepiness is discussed often in popular culture, but has not been systematically explored until recently in academic literature. Creepiness refers to the experience of an ambiguous threat. It is associated with encounters ranging from those with deviants, to supernatural entities, to insects. In this paper, I propose a model for examining a variety of responses to nonverbal behaviors, including creepiness. This model uses three dimensions (i.e., affection-hostility, certainty-uncertainty, welcomed-unwelcomed) for describing assessments of nonverbal behaviors, a framework (i.e., benign violation theory) for explaining five emotional responses to these nonverbal behaviors (i.e., pleasantness, interest, humor, creepiness, and fear/anger), and a research proposal for predicting and controlling affective responses to nonverbal behaviors. The paper ends with several suggestions for future research.\n\nThe use of the theme of alienation and/or isolation is the very cause of the grotesqueness. As the society alienates or isolates people the weirdness start to begin, it might be the weird personality of the characters or it might be their new habitat."
