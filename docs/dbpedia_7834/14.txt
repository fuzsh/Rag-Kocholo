* * *

Bruce Willis has pioneered a character type that might be called the postmodern proletarian. When his seven years on-stage in New York led to television stardom with Moonlighting, all the elements of his arsenal were already on display. Like the show itself, Willis's David Addison was at once a generic staple and a parody. Sturdy physically but stunted emotionally, private-eye Addison is a working man's man as beleaguered as attracted by his nouvelle poor feminist boss (Cybill Shepherd). And yet Addison is also a self-aware, verbally hyperagile ironist—indeed, often a self-conscious media construct.

It is not surprising, given the loaded, conflicted range of emotions called forth from Willis by Moonlighting, that he has subsequently forged a multifaceted film persona: as an action hero, a comic foil, and a dramatic artist, a megastar and a supporting player. His pursuit of these many genres and modes of performance has resulted in some strikingly huge hits, and some flops of similar size. Blind Date, his first big-screen starring vehicle, faltered in its would-be comic reliance upon the smooth-talking, uneasily romantic side of Willis. (Sunset similarly did not translate his comic appeal for movie audiences.) Die Hard also deployed his mastery of flippancy, but sparingly, accentuating instead his aura of besieged masculinity. The displaced cop John McClane is, like most of Willis's characters, a battling underdog. McClane, however, does not fight either against or beside a woman; with McClane, the class-edged wars waged by Willis's characters begin to play out centrally not "between the sexes" but upon Willis's ever more bruised, sweating (and even aging) body itself.

Having established himself as a bona fide box-office draw with Die Hard (thereby starting a franchise which went on to yield two lucrative sequels), Willis played a wrecked Vietnam veteran in the well-reviewed but little-seen drama, In Country. This sort of creative daring underpins the strain of slightly off-mainstream dramas which has combined with supremely mainstream action adventures and comedies to make up the three-pronged thrust of his post-Die Hard movie career. In Look Who's Talking, Willis brought his comic timing alone to bear on yet a second multiple sequel-spawning franchise, as the voice of a toddler. North five years later is of the same genre, although it does allow Willis on-screen in a bunny suit. From 1989 to 1994, Willis had only uneven box-office and critical success, with Hudson Hawk, The Last Boy Scout, and Striking Distance (all in the Die Hard mode, all flops), and Bonfire of the Vanities, Billy Bathgate, Mortal Thoughts, Death Becomes Her, and Color of Night (all stretches—in all but the last Willis sacrifices top billing for artistic satisfaction—but none hits).

In 1994, however, Willis's embrace of working acting and not just stardom paid handsome dividends in the capital of hip. As Butch Coolidge, doomed but unbowed boxer in wunderkind Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Willis is a perfect match for Tarantino's characteristic man-to-man battering, and bantering. By 1996, Variety would publish a column praising Willis's willingness to accept little money to do low-budget but high-quality projects; such publicity around films such as Pulp Fiction and Nobodys Fool countermanded the rash of earlier articles that had decried the "excess" of Willis's multimillion dollar per picture salaries.

His thinning hair shaved to the nub, Willis was not first-billed in Pulp Fiction; but his performance in it surely helped win him the similarly coifed lead role of James Cole in Terry Gilliam's 1995 remake of the Chris Marker landmark La Jetée, 12 Monkeys. Cole allows all of Willis's talents to shine, in a way that not one of his projects has since Moonlighting. A man under attack from unknown quarters, very possibly from the very social forces that command him, Cole fights through abuse and confusion—at first against, then towards, and finally alongside a psychiatrist played by Madeleine Stowe. The moment when Cole hears a pop song on the doctor's car radio epitomizes what Willis brings to the film, and to film in general. Stress draining from his face, Cole's unwillingly assumed armor drops away for an instant as he connects to something of the best in human creation, trivial as it may seem to the unenlightened. Willis knows how to depict not only the fight but what the fight is for, and it is this that has made him one of the modern screen's most prominent artists of the ordinary man.
