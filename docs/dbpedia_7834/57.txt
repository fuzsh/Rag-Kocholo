Born as Walter Bruce Willis on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, Bruce Willis grew up to become one of the most recognizable and versatile actors in Hollywood. Raised in a blue-collar family in New Jersey, Willis worked as a security guard and private investigator before he got his big break in acting. His father was an American soldier, while his mother was a German bank teller - a blend of backgrounds that would later shape his tough-guy persona on the silver screen. Willis's acting career took off with the television series Moonlighting (1985-1989), where he starred opposite Cybill Shepherd. His portrayal of the wisecracking detective David Addison won him an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe, and paved the way for his transition into film roles. However, it was his role as John McClane in the Die Hard series that immortalized Willis as a bona fide action hero. The first Die Hard film, released in 1988, became a classic and spawned four successful sequels, solidifying Willis's status as a box-office magnet. Despite being synonymous with action roles, Willis demonstrated his versatility by delving into various genres throughout his career. He earned acclaim for his performances in films like Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), and The Sixth Sense (1999). His role in The Sixth Sense garnered him a second Golden Globe nomination. Off-screen, Willis is known for his philanthropy, particularly his support for the military, drawing from his own background as a military child. His enduring influence in Hollywood is marked by the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that he received in 2006.
