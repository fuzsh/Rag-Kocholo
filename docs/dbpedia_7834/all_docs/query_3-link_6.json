But now I couldn’t remember it,\" Clarke told the New Yorker about the process of her diagnosis. \"Instead, nonsense words tumbled out of my mouth and I went into a blind panic. I’d never experienced fear like that—a sense of doom closing in. I could see my life ahead, and it wasn’t worth living. I am an actor; I need to remember my lines. Now I couldn’t recall my name.\"\n\nThe disease affects a person's ability to speak and understand speech, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nHere are some of the celebrities who have been diagnosed with aphasia.\n\nCelebrities diagnosed with aphasia\n\nWendy Williams\n\nBruce Willis\n\nSharon Stone\n\nEmilia Clarke\n\nPatricia Neal\n\nKirk Douglas\n\nDick Clark\n\nRandy Travis\n\nEllen Corby\n\nTerry Jones\n\nWhat is Aphasia?\n\nAphasia is a disease that effects speech and language comprehension caused by head trauma or a brain tumor, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nAccording to the Clinic, symptoms of the disease can include:\n\nSpeaking in short or incomplete sentences\n\nSpeaing in sentences that don't make sense\n\nSubstituting one word for another or one sound for another\n\nSpeaking in unrecognizable words\n\nHaving difficulty finding words\n\nNot understanding other people's conversation\n\nNot understanding what they read\n\nWriting sentences that don't make sense\n\nAbility to understand different parts of language affected in different ways for people with the disease.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic recommends seeking immediate medical attention if a person shows signs of the disease."
