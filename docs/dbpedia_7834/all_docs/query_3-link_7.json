As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.\n\nThis is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support. We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him.\n\nAs Bruce always says, “Live it up” and together we plan to do just that.\n\nLove,\n\nEmma, Demi, Rumer, Scout, Tallulah, Mabel, & Evelyn\n\nRed Letter Media guys had a good discussion on this recently. A few weeks ago they really panned some of his latest films but then more recently it was discussed that he was in some sort of mental decline and trying to cash in as much as possible before hanging up the spurs. Mixed feelings about it: I can't blame the guy for wanting to make as much as possible before the end but then it's kind of putting a pretty sad end to an illustrious career. Though the RLM guys did note that nobody is going to care about the truly awful movies that were made while he is obviously in decline, they'll just talk about his great roles.\n\nStill there's quite a sadness that he (or his family, which if they were wringing him out while he's mentally impaired but still able to \"work\" is a whole 'nuther issue) had to do it this way. Goodness knows he's made plenty of money but then everyone can fall victim to poor financial planning in life. If anything it should be a good reminder to all of us to keep shoveling money into the retirement accounts and live modestly. If for no other reason than none of us truly know when our last day at work will be. Perhaps Willis thought he had another decade or so and all this has hit him suddenly and unexpectedly.\n\nAnyway back to the RLM guys I can see people being upset at them razzing a fallen star on hard times, especially now that we know he was sick. However, this is also the profession Willis is in, if you go in front of a camera for money you need to be ready for criticism. Those last movies are shamefully awful. I think the blame really belongs in the producers more than Willis, especially considering the state he was in. If anything I think the criticism of those films is even more poignant now that it's under the light of possible elder abuse.\n\n*Edited for teh grammarz\n\nYikes. Wonder how long it's been diagnosed. Looking at his IMDB page, it's a bit hard to tell when the quantity over quality started, but it seems like about 2019-2020 is when he went full \"I'll take anything\". I don't recognize anything after Between Two Ferns. So if he got a good paycheck from those, while they get relegated to the \"can you even find them to stream anywhere?\" status, then good for him in padding out the retirement account.\n\nI know nothing about aphasia besides what a quick Google search provided me just now. It doesn't look like a degenerative thing, is it? It looks like most cases are due to a stroke or traumatic brain injury, with some people even recovering somewhat. This isn't a \"standard\" dementia kind of thing that's going to slowly eat away at his brain?\n\nAnyway back to the RLM guys I can see people being upset at them razzing a fallen star on hard times, especially now that we know he was sick.

You don't do 129 movies over 42 years (so just 3.07/year average) without some number that you're just taking a check for.\n\nYikes. Wonder how long it's been diagnosed.

It can come from a stroke, dementia, brain cancer, or a hard knock to the head. There are even reports of it being caused by COVID.\n\nI sincerely hope that he retains enough of his faculties to enjoy an extended retirement with his family.\n\nYikes.

I hope he banked a ton of cash that enables him to live his best life going forward. Losing my faculties is pretty much my worst nightmare (after something happening to my kid). I feel so bad for him and his family.\n\nYikes. Wonder how long it's been diagnosed.

Seeing her not recognize her own kids...I don't wish that on anyone.\n\nYeah, and what many others have said (in wonderful ways), this is sad. And yeah I hope he's able to enjoy time with his family & other parts of life.\n\nI remember enjoying hearing him singing on the radio/or on music videos. Didn't watch too much of Moonlighting (due to college) but I did like the premise of the detective agency, especially in regards to the employees. So when he started to do more films it was really cool to see.\n\nLots of really good films (made within 5 decades), among my many favorites (though these are 90s films I did really enjoy others just as munch but I thought I'd keep it at three, but was so tempted to take it to 10..when I wanted to include The Kid film) so anyhoo top 3 /with note I really liked so many other films/; Hudson Hawk (1991), The Siege (1998), and The Story of Us (1999)\n\nYeah, I've seen a lot of mentions where his contracts for these shlock movies specified he got paid $1 million per day, and the days he worked were referred to as Bruce Days on set because the pace was amped up to avoid spilling over into a costly extra day. And many reviewers noted that he was in a lot of tight shots so variations in camera lighting weren't as noticeable when other actors weren't in scenes with him, and the body doubles used didn't really match his physique. Even before the recent run of throwaway movies he might have been getting greedy - he was replaced by Harrison Ford in Expendables 3 because he was offered $3 million for 4 days work and he demanded $4 million.\n\nThat said, it's very sad that he's suffering this illness, and over time I'm sure he will only be remembered for his successes, and these tail-end phone-it-in movies will be forgotten.\n\nYikes.

There are even reports of it being caused by COVID.\n\n^^^this.\n\nIn my case, the cause was \"some people are just like that.\"\n\nAphasia can be classified into several different types depending on the exact symptoms.\n\nI sincerely hope that he retains enough of his faculties to enjoy an extended retirement with his family.\n\nI would imagine so as long as it's not primary progressive aphasia, although dealing with all the well-meaning idiots who say \"If you ever need help, just ask\" gets old after a while.\n\nThe LA Times has a longish article on Willis and his decline.\n\nIt sounds like it has been a while, and that his handler is the one who pushed him into all of those junk movies over the past few years.\n\nMaxing his cut of the action, sadly.\n\nAccording to those who have worked with the elder Willis on his recent films, the actor has been exhibiting signs of decline in recent years. In interviews with The Times this month, nearly two dozen people who were on set with the actor expressed concern about Willis’ well-being.\n\nThese individuals questioned whether the actor was fully aware of his surroundings on set, where he was often paid $2 million for two days of work, according to documents viewed by The Times. Filmmakers described heart-wrenching scenes as the beloved “Pulp Fiction” star grappled with his loss of mental acuity and an inability to remember his dialogue. An actor who traveled with Willis would feed the star his lines through an earpiece, known in the industry as an “earwig,” according to several sources. Most action scenes, particularly those that involved choreographed gunfire, were filmed using a body double as a substitute for Willis.\n\nIn one alleged incident two years ago on a Cincinnati set of the movie “Hard Kill,” Willis unexpectedly fired a gun loaded with a blank on the wrong cue, according to two people familiar with the incident who were not authorized to comment. No one was injured. The film’s producer disputed that the incident occurred, but the alleged discharge left actors and crew members shaken."
