        "text": "Here’s looking at you, Humphrey Bogart. The Oscar-winning leading man was best known for playing a tough guy with a heart of gold. He made dozens of films before his untimely death in 1957. Let’s take a look back at 20 of his greatest films, ranked worst to best.\n\nThough it may sound like a bit of Hollywood lore, Bogart was indeed born on Christmas Day, 1899, in New York City. After a short stint in the Navy, he started acting onstage and in films, mostly in bit parts as gangsters who met the wrong end of a bullet.\n\nHis big breakthrough came with the Broadway hit “The Petrified Forest,” in which he played a violent bank robber holed up at an isolated diner with a hobo and a waitress. When Warner Bros. decided to bring the play to the screen as a vehicle for Bette Davis, it was leading man Leslie Howard who forced the studio to let Bogart reprise his role.\n\nIt would take some boneheaded decisions by Warner Bros. contract player George Raft to turn him into a leading man. Raft turned down roles in “High Sierra” (1941) and “The Maltese Falcon” (1941), both of which landed in Bogart’s lap. In the former, he once again stars as a captivating baddie who meets a violent end. In the latter, however, he finally got to play a complicated hero, a sly, tough as nails loner whose cynicism masks a deeper pain.\n\nHe’d put that persona to its greatest use in “Casablanca” (1943), a romantic drama about a cheerless bartender in war-torn Morocco whose life is upended by the arrival of an old flame (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband (Paul Henreid), a leader of the French Resistance. Despite his hard exterior, he somehow finds it in himself to sacrifice love for the greater good. The role brought Bogart his first Oscar nomination as Best Actor.\n\nIt took another eight years (and a couple of high-profile snubs) for him to finally cash in that Oscar I.O.U. with “The African Queen” (1951), John Huston‘s rousing adventure about a drunken riverboat captain and a conservative spinster (Katharine Hepburn). He’d compete one more time in the category for “The Caine Mutiny” (1954).\n\nBogart’s onscreen successes led to an offscreen love affair. During the filming of “To Have and Have Not” (1945), an alluring newcomer named Lauren Bacall caught his eye. The two became a legendary couple, marrying in 1945 and making three more films together: “The Big Sleep” (1946), “Dark Passage” (1947), and “Key Largo” (1948).\n\nTour our photo gallery of Humphrey Bogart’s 20 greatest films, and see if your favorite tops the list."
