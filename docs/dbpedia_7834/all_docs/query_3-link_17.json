        "text": "A language disorder with an unusual name – aphasia – entered the popular lexicon two years ago after actor Bruce Willis was diagnosed with a type of the disease that gradually robs a person’s ability to communicate. The illness popped into the headlines again when Wendy Williams, host of the talk show “Wendy,” was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD).\n\nAbout 2 million to 4 million people in the United States suffer from aphasia, a disorder most commonly caused by a traumatic brain injury, tumor or stroke, according to the National Aphasia Association.\n\nPrimary progressive aphasia (PPA), characterized by a shrinking of the brain’s frontal or temporal lobes, is a much rarer disorder, affecting three to four people out of 100,000. The life expectancy for a patient with frontotemporal dementia, the type of aphasia affecting Williams and Willis, averages seven to 13 years after the onset of symptoms.\n\n“This is something that’s going to worsen over time,” said Peter Pressman, MD, associate professor in cognitive and behavioral neurology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “And while it starts with language, it doesn’t stay there. Other symptoms start to come on as the disease spreads and advances through the brain. The result is sadly that, yes, things will worsen and eventually life will be shortened as a result.”\n\nPressman’s lab, part of the Department of Neurology at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, is studying ways to improve diagnostic techniques and deepen the understanding of communication and behavioral disorders. Computational linguistics are used to measure language patterns, and Pressman investigates how facial expressions may change over time in people with a neurodegenerative disease.\n\nIn a current project, the lab uses a computerized method of assessing patients who have concerns about their cognition. The goal is to make the system available to the public and accelerate the process of delivering high-quality assessments.\n\nHere, Pressman talks about the different types of aphasia, some of the current therapies, ways patients can maintain their quality of life, and the advances in research that are leading to better understanding of the illness. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity."
