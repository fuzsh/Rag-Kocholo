        "text": "Born as Walter Bruce Willis on March 19, 1955, in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, Bruce Willis grew up to become one of the most recognizable and versatile actors in Hollywood. Raised in a blue-collar family in New Jersey, Willis worked as a security guard and private investigator before he got his big break in acting. His father was an American soldier, while his mother was a German bank teller - a blend of backgrounds that would later shape his tough-guy persona on the silver screen. Willis's acting career took off with the television series Moonlighting (1985-1989), where he starred opposite Cybill Shepherd. His portrayal of the wisecracking detective David Addison won him an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe, and paved the way for his transition into film roles. However, it was his role as John McClane in the Die Hard series that immortalized Willis as a bona fide action hero. The first Die Hard film, released in 1988, became a classic and spawned four successful sequels, solidifying Willis's status as a box-office magnet. Despite being synonymous with action roles, Willis demonstrated his versatility by delving into various genres throughout his career. He earned acclaim for his performances in films like Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), and The Sixth Sense (1999). His role in The Sixth Sense garnered him a second Golden Globe nomination. Off-screen, Willis is known for his philanthropy, particularly his support for the military, drawing from his own background as a military child. His enduring influence in Hollywood is marked by the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame that he received in 2006.\n\nPatrick L. Willis (born January 25, 1985) is a former American football linebacker who played his entire eight-year career with the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the 49ers in the first round of the 2007 NFL Draft. He played college football for the University of Mississippi and received consensus All-American honors. During Willis's senior season at Ole Miss, he received the Butkus Award and the Jack Lambert Award as the nation's top linebacker. A year later as a member of the 49ers, Willis led the NFL in tackles, earned first-team All-Pro and Pro Bowl honors while being named the 2007 AP NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year. Willis made the Pro Bowl in his first seven seasons in the NFL, and earned All-Pro honors in his first six years. He won the college Butkus Award in 2006 while at Ole Miss and in 2009, he won the professional Butkus Award while with the 49ers."
