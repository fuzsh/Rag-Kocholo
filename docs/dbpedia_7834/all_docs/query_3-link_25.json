        "text": "Bruce Willis, the highly successful action-hero actor, has aphasia, and, as a result, he is retiring from acting. Why, you might ask? The neurologic symptom is robbing him of his ability to perform; he can’t remember his acting lines. Approximately 15 million people worldwide have aphasia.\n\nWillis is not the first celebrity to battle aphasia. As People documented, Sharon Stone suffered a stroke in 2001 and dealt with the condition, although she continues to work actively. Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke wrote a harrowing piece for The New Yorker in 2019 that detailed her struggles with aphasia after an aneurysm, revealing that for a stretch of time, she could not remember or say her own name aloud."
