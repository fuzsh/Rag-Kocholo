        "text": "Roseanne Barr stood behind three feet of neon-blue glass, bottles of gin, vodka, bourbon, and tequila lined up behind her. White cement squares with handprints covered the walls. It was September 17, 1995; Barr was the reigning queen of prime-time television, but on this particular night she was wearing an oversize red T-shirt adorned with PLANET HOLLYWOOD across its front, cleaning a glass behind the bar at America’s most popular chain restaurant.\n\nPatrick Swayze, seven years on from his Dirty Dancing performance, sidled up to the bar. His hair was trimmed short, a sweep of bangs covering his forehead. A couple buddies with him: Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo. He paused, eyeballing Barr. “Hey, can I get a Pink Lady?”\n\nThe din of the crowd picked up, drowning out the music. Surrounding the revelers that night was movie memorabilia: Rita Hayworth’s dress from Gilda, Nurse Ratched’s hospital whites from One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Forrest Gump’s box of chocolates. The Planet Hollywood logo loomed large, reflected on the ceiling.\n\nLeft: Keith Barish and friends at Planet Hollywood circa 1991.

Bottom Right: Diners enjoy the ambience in 1997.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, Charlie Sheen had covered every supermarket tabloid for his marriage to model Donna Peele. The pair had met just six weeks before the wedding. Here he was, the happy newlywed (for now) in a suit and tie, bespectacled and goateed, elbowing his way to Barr. Sheen’s drink order? A Major League Hotshot.\n\n“You’re married now,” Barr quipped.\n\n“You’re right,” he fired back. “What about a Sex on the Beach?”\n\nBefore his drink arrived, Sheen got a tap on the shoulder: Luke Perry in a Planet Hollywood bomber jacket. “I gotta have something that’s going to take me to another ZIP code.”\n\nJean-Claude Van Damme, all muscle and martial arts and hair gel, shouted in his Belgian accent that he was in the mood for something with “some kick, some spice.”\n\nWithout missing a beat, Barr, who was pouring a drink for Danny Glover, said: “Try the Rockettes. I hear they’re French.”\n\nA pause, as if to wait for the laughter and applause of a live studio audience, then George Clooney leaned over the bar—Caesar-cut, ER George Clooney—yelling, “There’s an emergency! I need a drink!”\n\nIf this sounds not at all organic, not at all resembling what these incredibly famous people would order or just a little too scripted, that’s because it likely was. This was opening night of the Planet Hollywood on Rodeo Drive. Every celebrity you could imagine was there. It was the hottest ticket in town. ABC aired a special event, Planet Hollywood Comes Home. The cops shut down the street. All this for a chain restaurant that served chicken coated in Cap’n Crunch. And not just a chain restaurant but a theme restaurant. A Rainforest Cafe with celebrities. It seems unfathomable now that stars would go along with this.\n\nBut they appeared to be having a ball. For a few years in the nineties, these stars dropped any pretense of hauteur, while everyone else succumbed to their love of celebrity by paying ten dollars to eat a burger under the Terminator’s leather jacket. Cheesy? Yes. A massive—but fleeting—success unlike anything before it? A resounding yes.\n\nBy the start of the next decade, the enterprise would collapse, falling into bankruptcy twice, and the bold-faced names who reveled there would begin to walk away. Today, there’s a tendency among the stars involved to be overcome with sudden amnesia. It seems they’d rather we all just forget about the whole thing.\n\nThis is the untold story of the ultimate collaboration between A-list celebs and overpriced appetizers. A creation only the nineties could give us.\n\n“It’s like the Oscars,” Oprah said of Planet Hollywood in 1995, “only better.”\n\nThe Planet Hollywood in Manhattan has been closed to customers since the start of the pandemic; a rep for the chain said that takeout is still available and that the company is “evaluating what we are going to do next.” (When I wanted to try some of that Cap’n Crunch chicken myself and attempted to order takeout, no one picked up.) In 2000, they ditched the original Fifty-seventh Street location for 1540 Broadway, the middle of Times Square, with an entrance on Forty-fifth Street, tucked behind a Sunglass Hut and across the street from the headquarters of Viacom, home to MTV, VH1, and Nickelodeon. It’s as if the nineties signed a hundred-year lease on that particular block of pricey midtown real estate. You could easily walk right past this totem of celebrity, if it weren’t for the crowds that—prepandemic at least—lined up outside. Yes, as recently as early 2020, tourists came to New York to dine at Planet Hollywood.\n\nTimes Square is packed with chain restaurants, just like any American shopping mall: Olive Garden, TGI Fridays, Hard Rock Cafe. Thirty years ago, they represented a new wave in dining: The food was accessible, if overpriced; the experience was novel, if corny. By 1990, how Americans ate out was changing. There had been fast food and fancy restaurants, the kinds of places you’d take a date on a Saturday night. But fast-casual restaurants like Fridays, Olive Garden, and Outback Steakhouse were taking off. Americans had more disposable income; they were up for a dinner out on a Tuesday night. Hard Rock Cafe, which started as a burger place in London in 1971, was thriving as both a restaurant and a source of “eatertainment.” Merchandise was flying off the racks. In other words, America was primed to spend fifteen dollars on chicken fingers and a beer.\n\nA few years earlier, in 1987, Bryan Kestner sat at his desk at the Century City offices of the production company Taft-Barish, flipping through the script of the Flintstones movie, some of which takes place in “Hollyrock,” a kind of prehistoric Hollywood. Kestner stopped. Read it again.\n\nClockwise from left:Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Shriver, Elton John, Mr. Freeze, Arnold again, George Clooney, Batman, Sylvester Stallone, and Cindy Crawford.\n\nThis should be a real thing, he thought, like Hard Rock Cafe, but instead of music it will focus on Hollywood. We’ll bring Hollywood to different parts of the world. Kestner, a handsome twenty-something who had dabbled in modeling, grew up on a farm in Virginia. For him, stars had always been people you saw on a screen, not at the next table. He launched into a near sprint to get to the office of his boss, producer Keith Barish. “He looked at me like I was from outer space,” Kestner says.\n\nBarish’s business was film, not restaurants—he produced Sophie’s Choice, The Monster Squad, and The Running Man, among others—but he liked the idea. “This works,” he said. For the next year and a half, Barish met with restaurant veterans who could help execute this vision. Working title: Cafe Hollywood. Through New York publicist Bobby Zarem, Barish met Robert Earl, a colorful Englishman known for his loud silk shirts. Earl had become a king of eatertainment with a chain of medieval-themed restaurants and was then the CEO of Hard Rock International.\n\nCelebrities have been putting their names on restaurants for at least a century, starting with Jack Dempsey’s in the thirties. In 1990, as Earl and Barish were putting together their plans, Robert De Niro opened the chic Tribeca Grill in Manhattan, though he was mostly discreet about his ownership. Planet Hollywood would be different. The stars weren’t incidental. In Barish’s view, it would be a Hollywood museum that happened to sell food. But Earl wanted it to be more than that. All they needed were some stars. “With Hard Rock, we were always sort of waiting around dressing rooms after a show to meet the musicians,” Earl says. “And I said to this group that I wouldn’t do it unless we had celebrity partners for marketing.”\n\nBarish hesitated. It was supposed to be Hollywood as a concept, an abstraction. It was supposed to feel like all the glamour and mystique of the film industry in restaurant form. It wasn’t supposed to be about specific people. But Earl was the expert, the restaurant man, so Barish trusted him and went with it. Because they didn’t have money, they offered shares in the company. Because there were no restaurants yet, the shares had little value.\n\nDemi Moore, Jack Nicholson, and Bruce Willis.\n\nThey needed an action star, someone with appeal in the U. S. and overseas, so they started with a moon shot: Arnold Schwarzenegger, whom Barish had worked with on The Running Man. It didn’t get much bigger than Schwarzenegger in the late eighties, early nineties. He was hot off The Terminator and Total Recall. On Valentine’s Day, after the actor wrapped a scene for Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Barish told him about the plan for a Hollywood restaurant. He accepted immediately. Barish left the set with his first star locked in as Schwarzenegger’s family arrived with Valentine’s Day balloons for him.\n\nNext up: Bruce Willis. Die Hard 2 had just earned more than a hundred million dollars worldwide. Willis said yes and offered to play the openings with his blues band, the Accelerators. After that, Barish got a call from Warren Beatty; he was wrapping up Dick Tracy, and he was interested in joining up. “Warren Beatty can talk for three hours on the phone,” Barish says. “It was a circular conversation. So I never really asked him and he never asked me. It was just a conversation. We might have had two.”\n\nBeatty never came aboard. Sylvester Stallone was another story.\n\n“I begged,” Stallone told Larry King in 1993. “They saw me outside on my knees saying, ‘Please!’ ”\n\nThey had their stars. But they needed a better name.\n\nBarish remembers, “[Earl] said, ‘I have a name, but I’m not going to tell you.’ He said, ‘You have a name?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I have a name; I’m not going to tell you.’ ” As if in a scene from a movie, the two men said the name at the same time: Planet Hollywood.\n\nThe months before the Manhattan opening were a frenzy. Evan Todd, an assistant working with Barish who had no curation experience, was brought in to collect props and costumes to decorate the restaurants. Today, movie memorabilia is close to art—auctioned at prestigious houses like Christie’s. But for decades, movie props were thrown out after filming, grabbed by whoever wanted to take them home, or repurposed by the art department for another shoot, leaving them unrecognizable. In the late eighties, people were just starting to pay attention to set castoffs after a pair of ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz sold in 1988 for $165,000. Todd went to the studios to ask for donations—some would only lend items, demanding the right to get them back whenever they wanted. And he bought items that went up for auction, bidding against private collectors. He dug around in musty attics, damp garages, secondhand shops. He found the ships from Ben-Hur in the middle of a Nebraska cornfield. The ax Jack Nicholson wielded in The Shining, still caked in fake blood, was buried in the back of the garden shed of a guy who worked on the film.\n\n“We asked what he wanted for it,” Todd told the Los Angeles Times in 1995, “and he said, ‘Well, I’ll need another ax.’ That was an easy deal.” Barish tapped a real estate developer he’d met on a plane, Harry Macklowe, to help find a location. They settled on Fifty-seventh Street, a short walk from Hard Rock. They built a screening room out of blasted rock beneath the building and hired Anton Furst, the Oscar-winning set designer behind Tim Burton’s Batman, to design the restaurant. Furst thought they were joking. But a tribute to the movies intrigued him, and he signed on with the vision of making it just theme-y enough. His mandate, Furst told Esquire in 1991, was to create “a fun place for the jeans brigade, not upmarket or smart.”\n\nThis article appears in the Summer 2021 issue of Esquire.\n\nsubscribe\n\nThey spent months—and $8 million, plus the cost of the screening-room construction—on the Manhattan restaurant. The banquettes were the same color as those at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Palm trees peppered around the dining room recalled southern California. From Grauman’s Chinese Theatre they borrowed the idea of collecting handprints from the stars. In spite of the kitsch, they managed to persuade even press-averse actors to get involved. Barish called Jack Nicholson, whom he’d worked with on Ironweed.\n\n“Jack does not like to do those kinds of things. I said, ‘Jack, just do it.’ I said, ‘Jack, we’ll send someone there with cement,’ ” Barish says. “He did it.”\n\nOh, yes, and there was a menu to create. “Arnold wanted his mother’s strudel recipe,” Earl says. “Stallone was always protein driven, and Bruce at the time had more interest, because of his background, in the bar side.”\n\nIn interviews at the time, it was promised that Schwarzenegger would be in the kitchen cooking Wiener schnitzel. But when the three chiseled men did press for the restaurant, it seemed clear how much the menu was an afterthought. “The day they can reduce a meal to a pill, I’ll be happy,” Stallone said with a smirk in a 1992 interview with British talk-show host Michael Aspel. “I guess it’s from doing a great deal of training or whatever. Maybe it’s just genetic; I’m just not prone to chew a lot. It doesn’t go with my personality.”\n\nAspel followed up with the obvious question: “None of you fellas is short of a dollar, so why are you doing this?”\n\n“Greed,” Stallone, in a Planet Hollywood jacket, answered simply.\n\nEveryone laughed.\n\n“Kidding . . . well, sort of greed . . .” he went on. “It would be fun. And you know, it’s nice not to just be making films all the time, to venture out and deal with real people.”\n\nPublic-relations impresario Bobby Zarem, who’d introduced Barish and Earl, masterminded a media frenzy before the doors opened. Zarem, who claims credit for the “I Love New York” campaign, was close with many of the columnists around the city and knew celebrity was the key to coverage. The logo, an electric-blue planet framed with stars and the name of the restaurant emblazoned in cherry red on top, was everywhere in 1991. Zarem delivered Madonna a T-shirt with the restaurant’s logo, and she was photographed wearing it on a jog. Zarem successfully begged New York Post society columnist Aileen Mehle, who wrote under the nom de plume Suzy, to run a shot of Knots Landing star Michelle Phillips in the shirt. When New York mayor David Dinkins was in the hospital, Zarem sent a custom Planet Hollywood robe. President George H. W. Bush and First Lady Barbara Bush got robes as well.\n\nSly, Whoopi Goldberg, and Steven Seagal arrive in style at the Las Vegas Planet Hollywood opening in 1994.\n\nWhen opening night came on October 22, 1991, the city blocked off Fifty-seventh Street except to limo traffic, and the celebrities started rolling in. Elton John arrived in a purple printed suit and a matching hat alongside a bejeweled Donatella Versace. Donald Trump was there in a black turtleneck with date Marla Maples (months after his divorce from his wife Ivana). Chris Farley, Chris Rock, and Christian Slater posed together for photos. There were the designers of the moment: Marc Jacobs, Isaac Mizrahi, Donna Karan. Don Johnson came with his wife, Melanie Griffith, along with Patti D’Arbanville (his ex and the mother of his oldest son, Jesse) and her date. Wesley Snipes, Anna Nicole Smith, Glenn Close, Debbie Gibson, Cher. Kim Basinger, who has spoken about her agoraphobia, bravely faced the crowds outside, then asked Barish if she could spend the rest of the evening in an adjoining hallway. She reunited with her Blind Date costar Willis, who, in an oversize gray suit with a matching gray T-shirt, went onstage with the Accelerators, as promised. Just beyond the wall of flashing camera lights, thousands of fans flanking the street screamed with each new arrival. Some stars would make their way over to sign autographs or give high fives. Schwarzenegger tossed T-shirts from the stage. “It was a madhouse,” says former gossip columnist R. Couri Hay. “There were thousands and thousands of people outside. I remember it being worse than Studio 54 that night.”\n\nThe next day, The New York Times rolled out the welcome wagon. “For the last ten years, we had people yammering away about food as art and wagging fingers about diet, and the real, basic truth about food got lost. Food is supposed to be fun,” American Gourmet coauthor Michael Stern told the Times about the Planet Hollywood launch. “There are thousands of people ready to eat peanut butter again. There are millions of people who want to have some fun.”\n\nEarl and Barish each look back on those early days a little differently.\n\n“I didn’t know if there’d be one or ten restaurants,” Barish says. “I certainly never thought it would be a worldwide phenomenon. No one could have planned what it became.”\n\nEarl says it was, in fact, exactly what he’d planned. “I always thought it would be the size that it became, because that was my world,” he tells me matter-of-factly. “That’s all I did, feed people in large numbers—visitors to a city, locals in the city—sell merchandise. I’m made for that business.”\n\nDespite the immediate success, cracks showed early—portending what was to come. A few months after the launch, Hard Rock cofounder Peter Morton filed a lawsuit seeking damages against Earl, who was still working for Hard Rock, and the Planet Hollywood chain. Morton accused them of stealing trade secrets and creating a chain similar to Hard Rock “but of substantially lower quality.”\n\nAt the time, Earl called the lawsuit “a real bloodbath.” The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, according to Vanity Fair, and today, he tells me, “I’m probably fairly litigious and it would all be in a day’s work.” He pauses, then adds, “I’m a sicko, so I was probably enjoying it.”\n\nAbout two years after the Manhattan opening, Demi Moore joined Planet Hollywood officially—meaning she received shares in the company. Other celebrities followed. Actors and behind-the-scenes people, like their agents and lawyers, continued to receive shares as an incentive to show up at openings and events. Other perks included private planes and air miles for travel to events. For the Minneapolis opening, Planet Hollywood took over an entire hotel, bought out every interconnecting room, removed all of the hotel’s furniture, and made suites. The stars were put up in luxury hotels like the Halkin in London and promised invites to preparties and afterparties.\n\n“The idea of giving options or stock to studio people or to agents was to get their involvement, but at a certain point we didn’t have to. We didn’t do it anymore, because people were just coming because it was good for them,” Barish says. “They never said we have to show up in so many states, but every one I could, I did,” says Tom Arnold, who received shares. “My second wife was on the way back from [an event], and she flew back with George Clooney. He got the call where he found out he was Batman on the plane. . . . He was saying, ‘I am Batman.’. . . There were so many celebrities, it became like high school. You got to hang out with the cool kids.”\n\nThe openings grew more elaborate. Steven Seagal arrived at the one in Vegas on an elephant. Whoopi Goldberg was carried in like Cleopatra. Planet Hollywoods opened in Moscow, Paris, Tel Aviv.\n\nThey kept interest up by holding screenings and memorabilia presentations. In Manhattan, the owners hosted a regular Sunday movie night for twenty-five or so VIPs in the downstairs theater. Instead of popcorn, they served carved turkey and roast beef that people balanced on plates while they watched. Once, Prince Edward showed up. “It became a thing. Let’s go to Planet Hollywood and see the movie Sunday night,” Barish says.\n\nBut the real fun happened at the preparties—not at the brightly lit restaurants where the stars were on display. If an opening was near a celebrity’s home, they would host a gathering the night before. Prior to the 1994 Miami event, Stallone opened his home to everyone who came in for the occasion. Gloria and Emilio Estefan made arrangements for an enormous paella to be served. Patrick Swayze had the group over to his ranch outside Dallas, where he passed around plates of ribs fresh off the grill.\n\n“It was raucous on the way [to openings]. People were juiced up, man, as they should be. I found that the more the people partied, the friendlier they were to the fans. Some were very friendly,” Arnold says. “Then the ride home, people were mostly hung over. They had tons of merchandise, so we’d load the plane up with all their merchandise.”\n\nThere once was a time, before Instagram stories and reality TV, when the only place we regular folks saw famous people was in character onscreen, on Letterman, or in People magazine. They seemed impossibly far away and glamorous. But at Planet Hollywood, they were right there, in person: a supermarket-checkout experience come to life. Instead of reading about celebrities in Us Weekly while buying rubbery frozen pizza bread, you could eat that pizza bread and see the stars in real life one table over. It was a living, lowbrow mecca. Stars: They’re just like us.\n\nSome of them genuinely seemed to love it. Stevie Wonder was a regular at several locations, and if a group was in for a birthday, he’d join the servers serenading them. But the place never quite nailed the uneasy balance between exclusivity and accessibility, at times swinging from one pole to the other. Studio heads began to complain that Planet Hollywood openings were drawing more stars than their movie screenings. Once the A-listers got past the screaming hordes of fans, only select photographers were allowed inside for the invite-only openings, which gave the stars a sense of security. And though there was no private entrance at any of the restaurants, at the Manhattan location there was a small, tucked-away spot called the Marilyn Room, where celebrities were offered privacy if they wanted it. When Nelson Mandela came by with Danny Glover and Harry Belafonte, that was where they ate. When the typically press-shy Johnny Depp hosted a party with Iggy Pop, who performed at Planet Hollywood at the Cannes film festival, there was no media. The windows were blacked out to deter gawking passersby. As the nineties went on, the restaurants began opening in smaller and smaller cities. And the flashy Manhattan flagship was starting to become known more as a tourist spot than a celebrity haunt.\n\n“The openings were a hot ticket. But only on the opening night. Only on the private-screening nights. Only on a specific party night. That was it. And you went to see the stars,” says ex–gossip columnist Hay. “It was not El Morocco. It isn’t the Stork Club. It isn’t Elaine’s. It isn’t even Cipriani or 21. It wasn’t a restaurant where people went to eat. It wasn’t Studio 54, where you’d go every night. At midnight, everyone in the world was in the back bar at Studio 54. It was never on my list of drop-bys. It was a photo op. No one’s going to start doing lines on the red carpet when you’ve got Entertainment Tonight or Hard Copy there.”\n\nBy 1993, Zarem had left the company. “There was no class still in it. I brought class to it,” he says. “That sounds like a very egotistical thing to say, but it’s a fact.”\n\n“I don’t remember it ever having a lot of class,” says Hay. “I just remember the food got worse and worse and worse and worse until it really became inedible. And if you were going to go there for an event, you ate before, because you knew you couldn’t eat anything.”\n\nIn the mid-nineties, I visited the Orlando Planet Hollywood. I was around ten. I can recall museum-cased memorabilia above my head—I don’t know from which movie. Probably something I wasn’t allowed to see. It didn’t matter. These were real, actual props from movies. And surely, I imagined, movie stars hung out at this crowded central-Florida restaurant all the time. I begged my parents for a T-shirt, which I held on to for years. At that point, Planet Hollywood merch was highly coveted. “For a friend’s son’s bar mitzvah, I managed to get Planet Hollywood to sell me one of the official wool-and-leather jackets. They weren’t for sale, so it was a huge deal,” remembers journalist and author Linda Stasi. “When we gave it to him, people were literally cheering and touching it. The jacket was so rare at the time and Planet Hollywood was so cool that it was like giving a kid a solid-gold Rolex.” A vintage Planet Hollywood leather jacket or bomber can go for as little as sixty dollars on eBay today.\n\nTourists still flooded into the flagship Manhattan restaurant. The wait was always at least twenty minutes. Sometimes it was a couple hours. Patrons complained, yet they waited behind the velvet rope (a nice Hollywood touch) for the chance to sit underneath one of the fifteen jackets Schwarzenegger wore in The Terminator—even if Schwarzenegger himself was almost never there. They always asked, though. “It was incredibly monotonous for us, because there was a hierarchy like there is at any other job,” says actress Natalie Zea, who worked as a hostess at the Manhattan Planet Hollywood in 1994. “The servers were superior to us, because they’re the ones who got to interact on the occasion when somebody [famous] would come in. There was no real behind-the-scenes. It was just so rote.”\n\nOn a night when there wasn’t an opening or a screening, it was like any other midlevel chain restaurant where families in cutoffs clutching bags of sixteen-dollar T-shirts paid about fifteen dollars a person for pasta with a heavy sauce. The bartender mixed up big, bright, syrupy drinks, then put them on trays to be distributed to the smoking and nonsmoking sections. The same twenty songs played over and over. “Girls on Film” by Duran Duran seemed to always be on.\n\n“My only real memory of [stars coming in] is this blurry vision of a very tall man being kind of swept through as I stand behind the podium thinking, Oh, he’ll see me and be like, ‘You, hostess, there. Let me put you in a movie,’ ” Zea says. “Which, to be honest, is the only reason any of us worked there.”\n\nDown in south Florida, the Miami restaurant- goers were surprised with celebrity cameos from time to time. Stallone bought a home on fourteen acres overlooking Biscayne Bay in 1993 and would stop by the restaurant every few months. Schwarzenegger was there occasionally, too.\n\n“Everybody was coming there, hopeful to run into somebody famous,” says restaurateur Darin Rubell, who tended bar at the Coconut Grove outpost in 1993. “It was definitely a big question among the guests. I would say, ‘My God, that’s crazy. They were just here yesterday. You just missed them.’ ”\n\nIn April 1996, the company went public, trading 22.6 million shares as high as $32.12. It was the busiest day ever for a Nasdaq initial offering. And in 1997, Earl was named one of Time’s Most Influential People in America.\n\n“It has great sex appeal. It may not last, though,” fund manager Neil Hokanson told the Los Angeles Times. “These things always go public when they are at their absolute best and usually get worse from there.” It got worse from there.\n\n“It was a bad year. It was a bad time. It was a mistake,” says Barish. “It put unnecessary pressure on the company to grow on a quarterly basis. It was never meant to be that.”\n\nThere were already Planet Hollywood restaurants in most major cities, so they had to find other ways to expand to meet the demands of being a publicly traded business. There would be retail stores, casinos, hotels—natural progressions of the brand—but Earl also saw Planet Hollywood toys and fragrances and wanted to move past film into different themes, like sports, music, and comic books. He saw the potential for more than three hundred restaurants worldwide. But by the end of 1996, Vanity Fair reported that Planet Hollywood’s profits for the first half of the year were down to $4 million from $12.7 million the year before. The bottom was falling out.\n\nCopycat restaurants were popping up all around. There was Country Star with Reba McEntire, Clint Black, Vince Gill, and Wynonna Judd. Fashion Cafe, with models Naomi Campbell, Elle Macpherson, and Claudia Schiffer, opened in Rockefeller Center just down the street from the Manhattan Planet Hollywood. Steven Spielberg had Dive!, an underwater-themed restaurant with, yes, gourmet submarine sandwiches. Hulk Hogan had Pastamania! Earl launched his own spin-offs to help with growth when Planet Hollywood ran out of places to open Planet Hollywoods. There was a sports offshoot, the Official All Star Cafe, with Shaquille O’Neal, Andre Agassi, and Joe Montana. When Tiger Woods made his first public appearance after winning the Masters in 1997, it was at the opening of Myrtle Beach’s All Star Cafe. There was also an ice cream chain, Cool Planet, with Whoopi Goldberg. Any cool factor associated with Planet Hollywood was melting. The stock value plummeted, and people just weren’t going back to eat. In 1999, Los Angeles magazine reported that same-store sales—a critical factor in a restaurant’s long-term success—fell by 18 percent the previous year. And the food only seemed to be getting worse.\n\nSchwarzenegger suggested leaning into the merchandise. Inspired by how Tom Ford had transformed Gucci, he told Barish and Earl, “You’ve got to get a guy like that to design for Planet Hollywood,” Schwarzenegger recounted in his memoir. “You need actual Planet Hollywood fashion shows that you can take to Japan, Europe, and the Middle East so that people will want to have the latest Planet Hollywood stuff. Rather than always selling the same old bomber jacket, the bomber jacket should change all the time, with different kinds of buckles and with different kinds of chains hanging off it. If you make the merchandise snappy and hip and the newest of new, you’ll see tons of it.”\n\nIt seemed to Schwarzenegger that Barish and Earl were already overwhelmed. And it was too late for any shiny new buckle or chain to save them.\n\nBarish stepped away from the company in early 1999. There were reports that his relationship with Earl had soured—a detail neither wants to discuss now. Barish says simply of his leaving, “It was time for me to do something else.” And late that year, Planet Hollywood International Inc. declared bankruptcy, calling for the closing of nine of its thirty-two U. S. restaurants and possibly more of its eighty locations worldwide. The bankruptcy inspired gleefully snarky headlines like rocky k-o’d and arnold terminated.\n\nThe year 2000 started with Schwarzenegger, long the brand’s biggest cheerleader, selling his shares. In October 2001, the company filed for bankruptcy again, two years after the first. This time, the company pointed to the downturn in tourism following the September 11 attacks. Planet Hollywood had started the nineties as a flashy, fresh idea. But as the next decade began, it appeared to be over, a relic of a bygone era. In October 2020, the Times Square location’s landlord sued the restaurant for about $5 million in unpaid rent. Planet Hollywood denied the allegation and in response filed a counterclaim against the landlord seeking an order from the court regarding the scope of its obligations under the lease guarantee. A rep for the restaurant said, “No comment.”\n\nMost of the remaining Planet Hollywoods are still outfitted with memorabilia, which has been updated through the years—though the L. A. airport location has bare walls. The logo got a makeover, but the World Famous Chicken Crunch remains a menu staple. There are now over-the-top milkshakes, the kind that had a moment in the 2010s. One is topped with a piece of cake. As Earl promised in 1996, he’s expanded into resorts and casinos. In the former Aladdin resort on the Las Vegas Strip, he opened the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in 2007. Three of the four original bold-faced names were there—Stallone, Willis, and Moore—though only Stallone and Willis were investors, according to The New York Times.\n\nBritney Spears did her much-hyped, first-ever residency at the resort’s AXIS auditorium from 2013 to 2017, and the Orlando restaurant is still going strong, according to Earl. Like the Manhattan location, the London Planet Hollywood has spent the past year closed due to the Covid pandemic. But in January, Earl opened Planet Hollywood Beach Resort Cancun, an all-inclusive resort that includes “the PH Spa, inspired by the Golden Age of Hollywood.” When you look at the promotional materials for Planet Hollywood today, the action stars have been replaced by food personality Guy Fieri. And in talking to Earl, you’d never know of the chain’s late-nineties implosion. When I ask what it was like for him when two faces of the brand stepped away, he says, “When you say some of the stars stepped away . . . Bruce and Sly stayed with me all the way, still.”\n\nA rep for Stallone says, “Contrary to the assertion by Robert Earl, Mr. Stallone is no longer involved with Planet Hollywood.” (Stallone and Willis, who were effusive in their enthusiasm for Planet Hollywood throughout the nineties and during the Vegas opening in 2007, declined to be interviewed for this piece. A rep for Willis never responded to my inquiry about the actor’s current involvement with the brand. A rep for Schwarzenegger didn’t respond to multiple inquiries.)\n\nNow, three decades after that flashy Fifty- seventh Street grand opening, Earl says he wouldn’t change a thing. “I’ll tell you, not a regret, because we’re doing fantastic now that we’ve transitioned, as you know, into gaming and hotels,” he says. “But I’ve always thought, Oh my God, if social media had been around when we launched. . .”\n\nEarl cuts the call short—he has a meeting for his son’s new venture, a restaurant in Los Angeles at the intersection of Hollywood and Vine. “For me, one of the interesting ends to the story is my son is now doing his version of it,” he says. “Arnold, Bruce, and Sly have been replaced by a series of new digital influencers with millions upon millions of followers.”\n\nKeith Barish and friends at Planet Hollywood circa 1991.
