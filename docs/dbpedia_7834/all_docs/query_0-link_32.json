        "text": "Some celebrities are born with movie poster-ready names, just waiting to be written out in lights.\n\nOthers, however, opt to alter their monikers. Perhaps they’d prefer something shorter, a snappier ‘pen name’ of sorts, or even for professional or legal reasons.\n\nHere, we take a look at the stars who’ve decided on a name change – some of which are quite drastic. Others seem comparatively simple, but just as surprising.\n\nFind out the real names of Brad Pitt, Lady Gaga and more…\n\nBruno Mars\n\nPop hitmaker Bruno isn’t actually called Bruno, or Mars, at all. The Hawaii-born musician was named Peter Gene Hernandez at birth.\n\nIn an interview with GQ, Bruno revealed that he was nicknamed Bruno as a toddler – later opting to forego his Puerto Rican surname to avoid being typecast music industry as a Latino performer.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nAnother popstar, Katy Perry, was born with a different name: Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson.\n\nPerry is Katy’s mum’s maiden name.\n\nTom Cruise\n\nThe Mission: Impossible actor and mega movie star is actually called Tom Cruise… but that’s not his full name.\n\nTom was born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV.\n\nWhoopi Goldberg\n\nSister Act legend and The View host Whoopi’s real name is a world away from her stage name.\n\nShe’s really called Caryn Elaine Johnson, and once joked that her stage name was taken from ‘whoopee cushion’.\n\nTime wrote in 2011 that Whoopi said: ‘If you get a little gassy, you’ve got to let it go. So people used to say to me ‘You’re like a Whoopee cushion.’ And that is where the name came from.’\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nReese’s unique first name is actually her second middle name.\n\nReese Witherspoon’s full name is Laura Jeanne Reese Witherspoon.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix\n\nJoaquin Rafael Phoenix, who starred with Reese in the movie Walk The Line, was born was a different surname.\n\nHis name was originally Joaquin Rafael Bottom.\n\nSir Elton John\n\nSir Elton Hercules John’s real name is totally different to his stage name. It’s Reginald Kenneth Dwight.\n\nCardi B\n\nCardi B’s nickname is indeed Cardi, and her stage name, reports say, is a play on ‘Bacardi’, the rum brand.\n\nBut she was born Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar.\n\nBrad Pitt\n\nThis one’s not too exciting. But did you know that Brad Pitt’s first name is actually William?\n\nNicolas Cage\n\nThe Face/Off actor is called Nicolas… but his last name is Coppola, not Cage. He also has the middle name Kim.\n\nCoppola is a famous Hollywood surname, shared by his uncle, the director Francis Ford Coppola, and his cousin Sofia Coppola, also a director.\n\nSir Michael Caine\n\nMaurice Joseph Micklewhite Jr is Sir Michael Caine’s real name.\n\nHe adopted his stage name early in his career. Caine was said to be inspired by The Caine Mutiny, a drama starring Humphrey Bogart.\n\nThe Weeknd\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, the Can’t Feel My Face and Starboy singer was not born ‘The Weeknd’.\n\nThe Canadian musician’s real name is Abel Makkonen Tesfaye.\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nSome Like It Hot actor Marilyn passed away in 1962, but interest in her life remains to this day.\n\nShe was born Norma Jeane Mortenson, and later became Norma Jeane Baker by marriage.\n\nDemi Moore\n\nDemi was born Demi Gene Guynes, named for her stepfather.\n\nBut we know her as Demi Moore, a surname she took on marriage to Freddy Moore, prior to her marriages to Bruce Willis and Ashton Kutcher.\n\nBruce Willis\n\nAnd Demi’s ex-husband, Die Hard star Bruce Willis, also has a slightly different name than advertised.\n\nHis full name is Walter Bruce Willis.\n\nLady Gaga\n\nOK, this one’s probably not a huge surprise.\n\nMost fans of Lady Gaga know that her full name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta.\n\nThe pop icon release an album in 2016 entitled Joanne, her late aunt, after whom she is named.\n\nGigi Hadid\n\nSupermodel Gigi is indeed a Hadid – but Gigi is a family nickname. Her full first name is Jelena (said to be pronounced ‘yelena’).\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nPop star Lana’s catchy name is a stage name. Her full name is Elizabeth Woolridge Grant.\n\nHalsey\n\nAnother pop star with a stage name: Halsey is the alter ego of Badlands and Manic singer Ashley Nicolette Frangipane.\n\nSpike Lee\n\nDo The Right Thing and BlacKkKlansman director Spike Lee has an instantly recognisable name… but as it happens, Spike is simply a nickname.\n\nShelton Jackson Lee is the Oscar winner’s full name.\n\nJamie Foxx\n\nHollywood star Jamie’s full name, or original name, is Eric Marlon Bishop.\n\nReports say the change was made early in his career as a stand-up comedian, to help him stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe surname Foxx is said to be a tribute to Redd Foxx, a stand-up who shot to prominence in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nOlivia Wilde\n\nActor/director Olivia is known for starring in the movie Thirteen, the TV show House and for directing the teen flick Booksmart.\n\nShe’s also known by her Wilde stage name, which was said to be a tribute to Oscar Wilde.\n\nIn reality, her full name is Olivia Jane Cockburn.\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nRapper Nicki’s full name was Onika Tanya Maraj from birth.\n\nShe married in 2019, and is believed to have taken her husband Kenneth’s surname, making her Onika Tanya Maraj-Petty.\n\nDame Helen Mirren\n\nIt seems Dame Helen Mirren’s exact birth name is a little bit of a mystery.\n\nWe do know that Helen’s middle name is Lydia, and her married surname today would be Hackford.\n\nIt’s also know that, in 1951, when she was six, her Russian-born father changed the family’s surname from Mironoff to Mirren – as a notice was posted in the London Gazette.\n\nBut in 2010, a report by The Hollywood Reporter stated that The Queen actor was born Ilyena Lydia Vasilievna Mironov.\n\nMeanwhile, other reports say she was born as Helen Lydia Mironoff, before becoming Helen Lydia Mirren.\n\nConfusing!\n\nAndy Samberg\n\nThis one’s not so dramatic. Saturday Night Live and Brooklyn 99 star Andy Samberg changed his name aged five.\n\nHis first name was originally David, with a middle name A.J. Reportedly, he just preferred the name Andy as a child.\n\nVin Diesel\n\nFast & Furious actor Vin Diesel wasn’t, sadly, named Vin Diesel from birth.\n\nHis professional name is Vin, and his actual name is Mark Sinclair.\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nMiley is officially named Miley these days – but she was born Destiny Hope Cyrus.\n\nThe name Miley was born from a nickname, Smiley, and stuck. Now, she’s Miley Ray Cyrus.\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nAmerican singer Billie’s name IS Billie, and her second name is Eilish, too – but she actually has five names.\n\nBillie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell. Perhaps a touch too long to fit on an album cover?\n\nIdris Elba\n\nIdris, star of Luther and Thor, is said to be a nickname for Idrissa.\n\nThe actor’s full name is often reported as Idrissa Akuna Elba (with an added OBE on the end).\n\nIggy Azalea\n\nAussie rapper Iggy’s birth name is just as interesting as her stage name. She is Amethyst Amelia Kelly.\n\nTina Fey\n\n30 Rock star and comedy legend Tina Fey’s full name is Elizabeth Stamatina Fey.\n\nStamatina is a name of Greek or Italian origin. The name means ‘this morning’ in Italian.\n\nMORE : The best and worst celebrity biopic castings, from Harry and Meghan to Pam and Tommy\n\nMORE : Where are all the truly chaotic celebrities these days?\n\nMORE : Best celebs on Depop, from Emily Ratajkowski to Tess Holliday and Katie Price\n\nFollow Metro across our social channels, on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram"
