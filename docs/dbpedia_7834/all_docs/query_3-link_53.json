        "text": "ðŸš— New Jersey has been renaming rest stops for celebrities\n\nðŸš— A Cape May rest stop was to be named for actor Bruce Willis\n\nðŸš— County officials have asked the state to reconsider\n\nIn 2021, when Gov. Phil Murphy announced New Jersey would be renaming nine rest stops on the Garden State Parkway, he said, \"This is about putting New Jersey greatness on full display.\"\n\nThe names were taken from inductees to the New Jersey Hall of Fame.\n\nJames Gandolfini, Whitney Houston, Jon Bon Jovi, Frank Sinatra were among the names announced.\n\nThe Ocean View rest stop was supposed to be named after acclaimed African American author, novelist and Princeton University Professor Toni Morrison. However, Morrison's estate never granted permission to use her name, so an alternate was chosen: Actor Bruce Willis.\n\nCape May County Commissioners are now asking the state to reconsider.\n\n\"What has Bruce Willis ever done for Cape May County,\" Board of Commissioners Director Len Desiderio asks.\n\nWhy was Bruce Willis Chosen?\n\nBruce Willis was not born in New Jersey, but his family settled in Salem County where he attended Penns Grove High School in Carneys Point.\n\nAfter graduating in 1973, Willis studied acting at Montclair State University.\n\nHe also worked a number of jobs in South Jersey, including as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power plant and delivering furniture in Cape May County.\n\nAfter achieving success on the 80's sitcom Moonlighting, he rocketed to stardom in the 1990's as star of the Die Hard movies.\n\nWillis did not, however, return much to New Jersey nor was he known for any charity works in the region.\n\nIn 2019, he threw out the first pitch at a Phillies game wearing the home team jersey.\n\nWillis retired from acting after being diagnosed with the neurodegenerative frontotemporal dementia.\n\nWho else could the rest stop be named for?\n\nThe New Jersey Turnpike Authority could revisit getting permission from Toni Morrison's estate and stick with the original plan.\n\nCounty Commissioners approved a resolution asking the state \"to strongly consider naming of the Ocean View Service Plaza after a local veteran or community leader from Cape May County.\"\n\nThe Press of Atlantic City reports that Director Desiderio seemed to favor naming the rest stop after local Pastor Tom Dawson.\n\nDawson runs the SOAR Church as was recently awarded the FBI's Community Leadership Award.\n\nGarden State Parkway Rest Stops\n\nðŸš— Montvale: James Gandolfini Service Area\n\nðŸš— Brookdale North: Larry Doby Service Area\n\nðŸš— Brookdale South: Connie Chung Service Area\n\nðŸš— Vauxhall: Whitney Houston Service Area\n\nðŸš— Cheesequake: Jon Bon Jovi Service Area\n\nðŸš— Monmouth: Judy Blume Service Area\n\nðŸš— Forked River: Celia Cruz Service Area\n\nðŸš— Atlantic City: Frank Sinatra Service Area\n\nðŸš— Ocean View: Bruce Willis Service Area?\n\nReport a correction ðŸ‘ˆ | ðŸ‘‰ Contact our newsroom"
