        "text": "Scream\n\nRelease date: 14th January 2022\n\nWes Craven's classic 90's horror film is having a reboot... or a sequel? (looks to be a bit of both). Definitely starting the year the right way with a bit of horror from a franchise we've all been missing.\n\nJackass Forever\n\nRelease Date: 4th February 2022\n\nThere's been a Jackass shaped void in our hearts for years. It's about to be filled this year with the return of Steve-O, Johnny Knoxville and the rest of the gang, with some famous faces along for the ride.\n\nDeath on the Nile\n\nRelease date: 11th February 2022\n\nKenneth Branagh is back with another Agatha Christie adaptation following Murder on the Orient Express back in 2017. With a brand new cast even more stacked than before, this film promises to be a proper whodunnit, keeping viewers guessing until the very end.\n\nUncharted\n\nRelease Date: 11th February 2022\n\nFresh off the tails of the immensely successful Spider-man: No Way Home, testTom Holland is starring in this video game adaptation. From the trailers this promises to be a full fledged adventure in the vein of Indiana Jones. Mark Wahlberg is also along for the ride and we are excited to see the chemistry between the two stars.\n\nThe Batman\n\nRelease date: 4th March 2022\n\nThe Bat is back ðŸ¦‡, this time with a darker tone and a more emo look. This time Robert Pattinson is taking on the character as part of the next step in a R-Patz renaissance that has been taking place over the last few years. It only seems natural for the former vampire to become a full fledged bat, and we can't wait to see it. The film was shot during COVID-19 in... Birmingham of all places? Despite a few COVID related delays during production, the film is set to be released in March.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 2\n\nRelease date: 1st April 2022\n\nFollowing the success of the first film (at least after they changed Sonic's character design), Sonic the Hedgehog 2 promises more of the same bombastic fun. It also sees the return of Jim Carrey's Doctor Eggman, with the addition of Knuckles, a new villain voiced by none other than Idris Elba (yep, Luther himself).\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore\n\nRelease date: 8th April 2022\n\nFinally, a new instalment in the Fantastic Beats series! And it's about time too. Life was getting pretty boring without a bit of magic in it. Whilst the film was scheduled to be released last year, its release, like many other films this year, was pushed back due to COVID-19, with the film finally being released on 8th April.\n\nThe Lost City\n\nRelease date: 15th April 2022\n\nSandra Bullock and Channing Tatum star in this action-adventure romantic comedy. With this combination of genres there's really something here for everybody. The film also features Daniel Radcliffe, who we really haven't seen enough of on screen recently, and promises to be a good old fashioned blockbuster.\n\nDownton Abbey: A New Era\n\nRelease date: 29th April 2022\n\nLife just isn't quite the same without Downton on telly. Well, luckily the series has returned to the big screen. The new film sees the return of our favourite characters, and promises 'A New Era'.\n\nThe sequel was released on 29th April.\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\n\nRelease date: 5th May 2022\n\nIf the after credits scene at the end of Spider-Man: No Way Home left you hungry for more, we can't blame you. Benedict Cumberbatch is back for a second instalment in the Doctor Strange series, this time accompanied by Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, Wanda.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nRelease date: 27th May 2022\n\nHere's another film we never thought we'd see a sequel to. Tom Cruise is here to prove he's still got it jumping back in the pilot's seat for testTop Gun: Maverick. This film was in development for a while (thanks 'rona), but swooped onto screens this year to take our breath away on 25th May.\n\nJurassic World Dominion\n\nRelease date: 10th June 2022\n\nThe dinos are back (with a vengeance). The last Jurassic World film left the series in a really interesting place, and Jurassic World: Dominion picks up right where that film left off. Not to mention the fact that the cast of the original film are back.\n\nLightyear\n\nRelease date: 17th June 2022\n\nBuzz lightyear returns... in a way we've never seen him before. For testLightyear he's dropped the first name and this looks to be a very different affair to the Toy Story films. Buzz is blasting out of the confines of Andy's room and into the vastness of space - and we're all coming along for the ride.\n\nElvis\n\nRelease date: 24th June 2022\n\nEver wanted to know more about the King of Rock? Well your prayers have been answered this year with the release of Elvis, a biopic about... well, Elvis. This one really shouldn't be missed. It is directed by Baz Luhrmann (the director of Romeo + Juliet) and stars Tom Hanks, and Austin butler as the king himself.\n\nMinions: The Rise of Gru\n\nRelease date: 1st July 2022\n\nWhether you love them or hate them, Minions are here to stay, as this film makes clear. Perhaps the most recognisable animated characters in the world return to the big screen this year in Minions: The Rise of Gru. This new addition in the series promised to be a real crowdpleaser.\n\nThor: Love and Thunder\n\nRelease date: 8th July 2022\n\nThor returns this year with Mjolnir (his hammer for those not versed in the MCU) in tow. This time there's a bit of a twist in the formula: Natalie Portman's Jane is returning to the Thor universe as... the new Thor? Thor blimey, didn't see that one coming, but boy are we excited to find out more.\n\nThe Railway Children Return\n\nRelease date: 15th July 2022\n\nThe sequel to the classic film The Railway Children came out this summer. It's been more than 50 years since the original film was released and actress Jenny Agutter reprised her role of Bobbie Waterbury in the sequel. The Railway Children Return also sees Sheridan Smith take on the role of Bobbie's daughter Annie.\n\nNope\n\nRelease date: 12th August 2022\n\nFrom Jordan Peele, director of the Get Out and Us comes the next instalment in his world of horror. We know virtually nothing about this film... other than its name, which also tells us nothing about the film. We do know that the film sees the director reunite with star of Get Out and pride of Britain Daniel Kaluuya, which is exciting to say the least.\n\nMy Policeman\n\nRelease date: 4th November 2022\n\nStarring in yet another film, Harry Styles returned to the big screen in October 2022 in My Policeman, an Amazon Original film which landed in UK cinemas on 21st of that month, and will become available globally on Prime Video from 4th November.\n\nAs well as Harry, the film stars Emma Corrin, Gina McKee, Linus Roache, David Dawson, and Rupert Everett, in a 'beautifully crafted story of forbidden love and changing social conventions'.\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever\n\nRelease date: 11th November 2022\n\nThis year we return to Wakanda. This is a somewhat sad return following the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. It's a good thing his role wasn't recast as he really cannot be replaced, but his absence will definitely be felt. We're sure the supporting cast of the first film will be able to step up, however, and keep the spirit of Wakanda alive.\n\nAvatar 2\n\nRelease date: 16th December 2022\n\nWhilst many films releasing this year have been delayed, none have experienced as many delays as the long awaited sequel to the 2009 smash hit Avatar. We can't quite believe that it's coming out this year, but it really does seem to be the case. Best get rewatching the first film before Avatar 2 releases later this year.\n\nI Wanna Dance With Somebody\n\nRelease date: 23rd December\n\n2022 really is the year for musical biopics, and we are very excited for this one. The perfect film for fans of the singer and the newly converted. The perfect way to wrap up a year of incredible cinema."
