        "text": "This article reinterprets the Indonesian invasion of East Timor as a ‘diplomatic counter-revolution’. Using the central archival records of the Suharto regime for the first time in English-language scholarship, it unearths a diplomatic campaign undertaken by agents of the New Order to secure international support for an Indonesian invasion of East Timor. This diplomatic offensive spanned Southeast Asia, non-aligned and Afro-Asian networks, Western capitals, international institutions and media circuits, and global capital markets. Its success tipped the balance of power in Jakarta away from advocates of restraint like Adam Malik and towards advocates of annexation like Ali Murtopo. The diplomacy behind Indonesia's invasion of East Timor reveals that the architecture of globalization, lauded by some scholars as inherently liberatory, was in fact agnostic, capable of being turned to counter-revolutionary purposes in addition to revolutionary ones. And it suggests that diplomacy itself had been counter-revolutionized, as geopolitical and geoeconomic change combined to make the international system, particularly the states of the Global South, far more hostile to state-making claims and transformative world-making projects.\n\n41 The size of the ethnic Chinese community in East Timor is disputed. See Hull, Terence, ‘From province to nation: the democratic revolution of a people’, in Fox, James and Soares, Dionisio Babo, eds., Out of the ashes: destruction and reconstruction of East Timor (Canberra: ANU Press, 2003), p. 31Google Scholar; for ethnic Chinese inhabitants of East Timor's connections to Taipei rather than Beijing, see ‘Timorous Timor’, Wall Street Journal, 10 February 1975; for their disproportionate suffering after the invasion, see Taylor, John G., Indonesia's forgotten war: the hidden history of East Timor (Atlantic Highlands: Zed Books, 1991), p. 91Google Scholar.\n\n95 Yoga Sugama, Progress Report: Bulan Januari 1975 [Progress Report: January 1975], 29 January 1975, HB IX, 589, ANRI; Yoga Sugama, Progress Report tentang Perkembangan Masalah Hankam di Timor Portugis [Progress Report Regarding the Development of Defence and Security Problems in Portuguese Timor], 17 February 1975, HB IX, 589, ANRI; ‘Question mark over Timor as Lisbon prepares to quit’, The Times of India, 5 October 1974; ‘33-year-old postal worker wants to be king of East Timor’, Hartford Courant, 2 February 1975; ‘Indonesia seen weighing invasion of Portuguese Timor’, Washington Post, 11 March 1975."
