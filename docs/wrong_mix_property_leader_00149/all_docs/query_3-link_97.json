Movable holiday is Good Friday.\n\nTIME: 9 pm = noon GMT.\n\nLOCATION, SIZE, AND EXTENT\n\nThe main land area of East Timor lies on the eastern half of Timor, an island roughly the size of the Netherlands (32,000 sq km/12,355 sq mi) that forms an arc between Asia and Australia and is situated within the Nusatengarra Archipelago. Opposite the well-traveled island of Bali, East Timor is surrounded by the Indian Ocean at the south at the Pacific Ocean at the north. Its size rivals New Jersey or Israel, and its 15,007-km (9,325-mi) territory extends beyond its mainland to include the enclave of OcussiAmbeno in West Timor, and the islands of Atauro in the n and Jaco in the e. Dili, a small port city on the northern coast, is the capital.\n\nTOPOGRAPHY\n\nThe landscape offers a patchwork of rugged mountains, waterfalls, coastal lagoons, and diverse features that support variable vegetation, dry grasslands, savannah forests, gullies, and patches of dense rain forest. Gunung Tata Mai Lau, a mountain that forms the highest point on East Timor, reaches 2,963 m (9,721 ft) just south of the capital city of Dili, and the Laclo river in the north stretches some 80 km (50 mi), forming the longest river.\n\nCLIMATE\n\nTemperatures in the dry season, from May to November, average 20–33°c (68–91°f). The weather during this season is pleasant and dry. Around October or November, oppressive humidity arrives and monsoon cloud activity builds up. The wet season, from December to April, sees average temperatures of 29–35°c (84–95°f), with heavy rains and flooding. In the mountains, daytime temperatures are warm to hot, but are cool to cold at night. Earthquakes, tsunamis, and tropical cyclones occur.\n\nFLORA AND FAUNA\n\nThe primary forest area of East Timor has been reduced to around 88,000 hectares (220,000 acres), or 1% of the territory. Dense forests are found only on the south coast or in mountainous areas. The vegetation consists mostly of secondary forests, savannah, and grasslands. Flora includes ironwood, eucalyptus, black eucalyptus, redwood, sandalwood, cendana, and lontarwood. Fauna include deer, monkeys, cockatoos, horses, cows, and beo kakoaks.\n\nENVIRONMENT\n\nThe main environmental threats come from the widespread use of slash-and-burn agriculture, which has led to deforestation and soil erosion. According to a 2006 report issued by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), threatened species included seven species of birds, one type of reptile, and three species of fish. Threatened species include the albacore tuna, Everett's tree frog, black kite, Timor sparrow, shirttoed eagle, Japanese sparrow eagle, and redcheeked parrot.\n\nPOPULATION\n\nThe population of East Timor in 2005 was estimated by the United Nations (UN) at 947,000, which placed it at number 153 in population among the 193 nations of the world. In 2005, approximately 3% of the population was over 65 years of age, with another 41% of the population under 15 years of age. There were 108 males for every 100 females in the country. According to the UN, the annual population rate of change for 2005–10 was expected to be 2.7%, a rate the government viewed as satisfactory. The projected population for the year 2025 was 1,938,000. The population density was 64 per sq km (165 per sq mi).\n\nThe UN estimated that 8% of the population lived in urban areas in 2005, and that urban areas were growing at an annual rate of 4.22%. The capital city, Dili, had a population of 49,000 in that year.\n\nMIGRATION\n\n\"Timor\" may be the Malay word for \"Orient,\" but East Timor's people betray a long procession of migrations from the west, north, and east. The Portuguese arrived on the island in the early 16th century. At the end of 2002, there were approximately 30,000 East Timorese refugees living in settlements in the west Timorese countryside. By late 2004 there were 448 individuals who were of concern to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR); there were also 221 refugees in East Timor. There were zero migrants per 1,000 population in 2005.\n\nETHNIC GROUPS\n\nHistorically the ethnic population was largely defined by the Atoni and the more dominant Belu, which was a blend of Malay, Melanesian, and Austronesian peoples who were fluent in the Tetum language. At independence in 2002, the approximate ethnic divisions in the population were as follows: 78% Timorese, 20% Indonesian, and 2% Chinese.\n\nLANGUAGES\n\nIn addition to Tetum, there are about 15 other indigenous languages spoken within East Timor. Tetum, Galoli, Mambai, and Tokodede are classified as Austronesian languages, while Bunak, Kemak, Makassai, Dagada, Idate, Kairui, Nidiki, and Baikenu are the nonAustronesian tongues. Tetum and Portuguese are official languages. Indonesian and English are also prominent.\n\nRELIGIONS\n\nThe last available figures on religion were collected in 1992 (before independence), at which time the population was 90% Roman Catholic, 4% Muslim, 3% Protestant, 0.5% Hindu, and an undetermined number, Buddhist. As of 2004, the dominant religion still appeared to be Catholicism; however, it is believed that a number of registered Catholics actually practice traditional animism, a religious category that had not been officially recognized by the Indonesian government. The largest Protestant group was the Assembly of God.\n\nThe new government has generally respected the regulations for freedom of religion that were established by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). Though public opinion had leaned toward making Catholicism the national religion, the presiding bishop, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo (a Nobel Peace Prize laureate), encouraged members of the Constituent Assembly not to make such a designation. The 2002 constitution instead provides for the freedom of conscience, religion, and worship and this right is generally respected in practice. Religious organizations must register with the Ministry of Interior if most or all of their members are foreigners. Due to past associations with Indonesian occupation groups, some Muslim and Protestant minorities have reported social harassment.\n\nTRANSPORTATION\n\nRebuilding the transportation infrastructure has been a key concern for the nation. As of 2002, there were no railways reported. Highways stretched across about 3,800 km (2,361 mi), but only about 428 km (266 mi) were paved, and these roads were poorly maintained. Driving accidents are frequent due to poor road conditions, lack of illumination, and the absence of required driving permits. Roads are widely shared by pedestrians and vendors, especially in city areas. Taxis, small buses, and minivans provide public transportation, but the system is generally overcrowded and not reliable.\n\nThere were eight airports operating in 2004, but only three had paved runways. There were also nine heliports (as of 2005).\n\nHISTORY\n\nSince the 1500s, the island of Timor and its lush offering of sandalwood lured both Portuguese and Dutch explorers, who contested for the territory until an official territorial division was determined through the Sentenca Arbitral in April 1913. Unlike the Dutch, Portugal's sphere of influence was concentrated in the local leadership of the East Timorese liurai rei—rulers, chieftains, and biracial families known as the \"Black Portuguese\" who were of mixed Timorese and Portuguese descent. While Portugal's colonial hold on East Timor failed to avail the local population of educational and general advancement opportunities, even leaving the island with barely 30 km (19 km) of paved asphalt road, its detachment enabled the East Timorese cultural identity to remain largely intact and unscathed by modernity.\n\nIronically, efforts to crush the East Timorese are not traced to the Portuguese, but to the Indonesian people and their brutal tactics for integration following Portugal's exodus from the island. When the \"Carnation Revolution\" of April 1974 in Portugal prompted the demise of nearly 50 years of dictatorship, the decolonization of East Timor, among Portugal's other colonies, seemed a favorable consequence. By the start of May 1974 three political parties surfaced within the island: the Apodeast Timori (Timorese Democratic People's Union), largely a device of the Indonesian government that advocated that East Timor be integrated into Indonesia; the UDT (Democratic Union of Timor), advocating a progressive process of autonomy under Portugal; and the ASDT (Timorese Social Democratic Association), which later became the leftwing independence movement Fretilin (Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor), advocating the island's total independence.\n\nThe subsequent union and mounting popularity of UDT and Fretilin by January 1975 proved threatening enough to the Indonesian government that President Suharto, whose integrationist stance was already endorsed by the United States, Australia, Japan, and other nations, justified his military intervention in East Timor through the \"Operasi Komodo.\" Authored by the president's intelligence advisor Ali Moertopo (1924–84), Operasi Komodo essentially slandered Fretilin, asserting that the party was secretly Communist and serving to splinter its alliance with the UDT by May. Consequently, on 6 June 1975, Indonesia already occupied the OecussiAmbeno enclave under the guise of restoring order in East Timor, which had not endured any form of foreign occupation, with the exception of a brief but brutal occupation by the Japanese during World War II (1939–34).\n\nDespite Indonesian presence and pressure within East Timor, Fretilin still gained 55% of the popular vote in local elections on 29 July 1975. Thus again threatened, Indonesia manipulated the UDT to counter Portuguese authority and Fretilin's influence through a coup staged 11 August–24 September 1975. However, the coup against Fretilin failed; in fact, Fretilin instead gained control of the entire East Timorese territory and launched humanitarian advancements (in education, medical treatment, and local decisionmaking) that had been historically denied to the islanders. Still, reports generated by the US Central Intelligence Agency discerned Indonesian infiltration and fighting within East Timor and around its borders midSeptember–October 1975. After capturing the violence on videotape, four foreign journalists were executed by Indonesian militia on 17 October 1975, and tension between pro- and anti-independence forces was heightened. On 28 November 1975, Fretilin's formal assertion of an independent state of East Timor was answered the very next day by Moertopo's \"petition\" for the integration of East Timor into Indonesia through the \"Balibo\" Declaration, which UDT leaders were forced to sign.\n\nOn 7 December 1975, only one day after a visit to Jakarta by President Gerald Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger of the United States, Indonesia deployed 10,000 troops—by sea, air, and land—into Dili, after an already devastating naval and aerial bombardment led by General Benny Murdani. Within days of an invasion marked by public torture, rape, and the random killing of mass civilians, Portuguese governor Mario Lemos Pire and his remaining administration made a covert and final exodus during the night to the island of Atauro, marking the end of over 460 years of colonization, without decolonization achieved. On 17 July 1976, Indonesia claimed East Timor its 27th province, despite condemnation from the United Nations (UN). Indonesia kept up fullscale attacks through March 1979 through weaponry largely supplied by the United States under the administration of President Jimmy Carter. Within a year of the attack, an estimated 60,000 East Timorese had been killed, while tens of thousands sought refuge from the Armed Forces of the Republic of Indonesia (ABRI) in the rugged mountainous interior of East Timor, where Fretilin guerrilla forces remained; others were forced into Indonesian resettlement camps, where disease, malnutrition, and death were rampant. The island was relegated to a \"closed colony\" status by the military from December 1975 through 1 January 1989.\n\nIt has been estimated that some 250,000 were killed since 1975 when warfare seized the island. Mass terror and killings were widespread, including 1,000 in Aitana in July 1981, 400 in Lacluta in September 1981, and, finally securing international attention, some 270 during the Santa Cruz massacre of 12 November 1991, in which peaceful mourners and demonstrators were killed by Indonesian troops' open fire in a cemetery in Dili. While Indonesia experienced a shift in leadership with the forced resignation of President Suharto in 1997 and rise to power of his vice president, B. J. Habibie, East Timor endorsed Fretilin leader José Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmão, then the president of the National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT). Their continued resistance against military occupation and terror, coupled with heightened international scrutiny of the atrocities within the island, may have prompted Habibie in January 1999 to extend the choice to East Timorese citizens: autonomy under Indonesian rule or outright independence. An overwhelming 99% of eligible voters were present during the 30 August 1999 referendum, which secured the vote for independence.\n\nHowever, post-election violence and killings led by proIndonesian militias and the army killed more than 1,000 people and drove some 250,000 from East Timor. This was a dark reminder of East Timor's subjugation to the Indonesian military, which has long remained the source of ultimate government authority. Following a unanimous decision on 25 October 1999 by the UN Security Council, East Timor was governed by the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and the National Consultative Council (originally formed by 15 East Timorese whose representation was later increased to 33), with the mission to rebuild the island and establish a new government by the close of 2001. In September 2001, a Constituent Assembly was elected and given with the task of writing a constitution for East Timor. In April 2002, José Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmão defeated Xavier do Amaral for the presidency, and on 20 May 2002 East Timor became an independent nation. A successor mission to UNTAET, the United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) was established to provide assistance to East Timor over a period 12 months, especially in matters of law enforcement and security. East Timor became the 191st UN member state on 27 September 2002.\n\nIndonesia's attempts to bring to justice those responsible for the 1999 violence in East Timor were heavily criticized. Under intense international pressure, Indonesia set up a special human rights court to try those responsible for the violence. The court's record—in both investigating the involvement of Indonesia's most senior security officials and its apparent willingness to acquit others with what was considered to be overwhelming evidence—was condemned. The court indicted 18 suspects for atrocities in East Timor, but only one conviction stood. A \"Truth and Friendship Commission\" was also formed by East Timor and Indonesia as a way to promote factfinding about the 1999 human rights violations, and to achieve reconciliation. But the commission had no power of prosecution and was considered a diversion from the need for actual accountability.\n\nBishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with José Ramos Horta in 1996, announced his resignation in November 2002. He won the prize for his stand in defense of Timorese rights. In 1999, militia gangs attacked and burned his residence where hundreds of refugees were being sheltered. In December 2002, the Indonesian human rights court sentenced the first Indonesian military official convicted in the 1999 violence for failing to prevent proIndonesian militiamen from attacking Belo's home. The official, Lt. Col. Soedjarwo, was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nDisputes between Australia and Indonesia over parts of the oil- and gas-rich seabed of the Timor Sea led to the signing of the 1989 Timor Gap Treaty, which specified a 50–50 split of the royalties from the shared zone of undersea exploration between Australia and Indonesia. In May 2002, the treaty was renegotiated, and newly independent East Timor was granted 90% of the royalties, with Australia receiving 10%. However, the terms of the agreement were conditional on East Timor foregoing its territorial claim to almost the entire oil and gas field. Foreign officials estimated a potential revenue flow of several tens of millions of dollars a year to East Timor. In 2005 the Timor Gap fields were considered to be a source of tension, with East Timor's government accusing Australia of cutting humanitarian aid as a way to pressure East Timor into acceding to its contract terms.\n\nIn spring and early summer 2006, violence spread across Dili, driving an estimated 100,000 residents to flee to villages in the countryside. The unrest, triggered when striking military were dismissed by the government in March 2006, was undermining peace in the young nation, whose economy and government were struggling to maintain order.\n\nGOVERNMENT\n\nA parliamentary system of government with a largely ceremonial president was established in 2001. In the elections for the Constituent Assembly held 30 August 2001, Fretilin took 55 of the 88 seats. Twenty-three of the candidates, or 27% of the total, were women. The assembly was charged with drafting a constitution for East Timor. On 22 March 2002, the Constituent Assembly approved East Timor's constitution, which was modeled largely on that of Portugal, although the German and US constitutions were consulted as well. Key components of the constitution include a ban on the death penalty, and the provision for fundamental political rights and civil liberties, including due process rights.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly was transformed into the National Legislative Assembly, or National Parliament, in May 2002. The unicameral National Legislative Assembly is composed of a minimum of 52 and a maximum of 65 members, serving five-year terms. Thirteen of the members are district representatives, corresponding to East Timor's 13 districts. For its first term of office, the parliament was comprised of 88 members on an exceptional basis.\n\nThe first presidential elections were held on 14 April 2002. José Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmão defeated Xavier do Amaral for the presidency, winning with 82.7% of the votes cast. Mari Alkatiri was chosen as East Timor's first prime minister. The next presidential election was scheduled to be held in April 2007. A Council of State advises the president. It is composed of former presidents who were not removed from office, the prime minister, the speaker of parliament, five members elected from parliament, and five members appointed by the president. A Council of Ministers is comprised of the prime minister, any deputy prime ministers, and the ministers of state. East Timor's Catholic Church led prolonged demonstrations in Dili during 2005, resulting in the signing of an agreement on social issues by the government.\n\nPOLITICAL PARTIES\n\nThere were 16 registered parties for the Constituent Assembly elections held in August 2001. Fretilin won 57.37% of the national votes and elected 12 of the 13 district representatives. The 12 parties represented in East Timor's first 88-member Parliament were: Fretilin (Revolutionary Front of Independent East Timor), 55 seats; the Democratic Party (PD), 7 seats; the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the Social Democratic Association of Timor (ASDT), 6 seats each; the Democratic Union of Timor (UDT), the Christian Democratic Party (PDC), the People's Party of Timor (PPT), the Nationalist Party of Timor (PNT), and the Timorese Monarchist Association also called Sons of the Mountain Warriors (KOTA), 2 seats each; the Liberal Party (PL), the Christian Democratic Party of Timor (UDC/PDC), the Socialist Party of Timor (PST), and an independent candidate, 1 seat each. Other parties include the Maubere Democratic Party (PDM) and the Timor Labor Party (PTT). The Popular Council for the Defense of the Democratic Republic of East Timor (CPDRDTL) and Kolimau 2000 are opposition organizations.\n\nLOCAL GOVERNMENT\n\nEast Timor is divided into 13 districts: Aileu, Ainaro, Baucau, Bobonaro, Covalima, Dili, Ermera, Lautem, Liquiçá, Manatuto, Manufahi, Oecussi, and Viqueque. The districts are further divided into 68 postos (subdistricts). A posto is further divided into sucos, or clusters of villages. There are approximately 500 sucos in the country. Sucos are divided into aldeias (villages); there are approximately 2,100 aldeias in East Timor. Local elections were held throughout East Timor in 2004 and 2005.\n\nJUDICIAL SYSTEM\n\nA Ministry of Justice was established in East Timor to guarantee an independent and impartial judiciary. A department of judicial affairs is responsible for the recruitment, appointment, and training of judges, prosecutors and public defenders. The Supreme Court of Justice is the highest court in the nation, with the power of judicial review. Other courts include a High Administrative, Tax, and Audit Court; military courts; and maritime and arbitration courts.\n\nIn March 2000, the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) created a civil law court system with 13 district courts and one national Court of Appeal. The law later was amended to include a court system of only four district courts and one national Court of Appeal. The four district courts are located in Dili, Baucau, Suai, and the Oecussi enclave. The district courts have jurisdiction over criminal and noncriminal offenses referred to as \"ordinary crimes,\" whereas special panels within the Dili district court have exclusive jurisdiction over \"serious criminal offenses.\"\n\nThe judicial system was considered the weakest government function in East Timor after independence. A backlog of cases raised human rights concerns, as cases pending trial and appeal were unable to be heard within a reasonable amount of time. From 2004, civil laws based on Portuguese codes began to supplant the UNTAET legal framework. Portuguese and Tetum became the official languages of the court system.\n\nARMED FORCES\n\nIn January 2001, East Timor's armed forces began training, with the goal of deploying 1,500 active military personnel and an additional 1,500 reservists into two infantry battalions. As of 2005, East Timor had an army of 1,250 personnel, including 30 women. There was also a 36-member naval element. Basic training for the first group of recruits was aided by Portugal, with special training programs aided by Australia. In April 2002, UN peacekeeping forces totaled about 6,200 members from 20 countries. The number of UN forces was expected to decline as the government and the UN continued to make arrangements for national security, although it appeared that UN troops would be needed again in May–June 2006 to quell factional violence. As of 2005, the number of UN troops had fallen to 181 personnel from 9 countries. The general military age is 18–21 years old. Both male and female recruits have been accepted. Military expenditures for 2003 were estimated to be at about $4.4 million.\n\nINTERNATIONAL COOPERATION\n\nEast Timor joined the United Nations in September 2002; it has participated in the FAO, the World Bank, IFAD, the IFC, ILO, IMF, UNESCO, UNIDO, and WHO. The nation is also a member of the ACP Group, the Asian Development Bank, and G-77. It became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in July 2005 and is applying for observer status in ASEAN. The United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) was established in May 2002 to provide assistance in public security and law enforcement while the country establishes political stability following independence from Indonesia; 16 countries have offered support for the mission.\n\nECONOMY\n\nAs a result of the post-independence referendum violence in 1999 led by Indonesian troops and anti-independence militias, approximately 70% of the economic infrastructure was devastated and some 250,000 people moved into West Timor. Reconstruction efforts undertaken by the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) improved both urban and rural areas. Agriculture remained the main source of income in most of the country's villages, with only a small percentage of people selling a significant proportion of their rice or maize harvest. During 2000–01, the agriculture sector expanded, due to a rebuilding of seed stocks and irrigation systems, improved access to fertilizer and transportation, a reduced threat of violence, and high demand resulting from the large international presence in the country. The services sector also registered strong growth in 2000–01 in order to meet the needs of the international staff and reconstruction efforts. After mid-2002, however, growth was held back as a result of the winding-down of the international presence and of a drought in 2003. As of 2004, however, GDP growth had recovered somewhat (1%). During the Indonesian occupation, tourism was not a large industry, but there is a great potential growth in this area. The East Timorese economy stands to benefit in the long term from the development of the oil- and gas-rich seabed of the Timor Sea.\n\nINCOME\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) reported that in 2005 East Timor's gross domestic product (GDP) was estimated at $370.0 million. The CIA defines GDP as the value of all final goods and services produced within a nation in a given year and computed on the basis of purchasing power parity (PPP) rather than value as measured on the basis of the rate of exchange based on current dollars. The per capita GDP was estimated at $400. The annual growth rate of GDP was estimated at 1%. The average inflation rate in 2004 was 1.8%. It was estimated that agriculture accounted for 25.4% of GDP, industry 17.2%, and services 57.4%.\n\nIt was estimated that in 2003 about 42% of the population had incomes below the poverty line.\n\nLABOR\n\nThe labor force in 1998 was 397,131. Subsistence agriculture accounted for three-fourths of employment. The unemployment rate, including underemployment, stood at approximately 50% in 2002.\n\nIn 2004, official registration procedures for employer organizations and trade unions were established. As of 2005, workers were permitted to form and join labor organizations without getting prior approval; they were also allowed to engage in collective bargaining. However, inexperience and a lack of organizational and negotiating skills have hampered attempts at organizing workers and at making them aware of their rights.\n\nChildren under the age of 18 are generally prohibited from working, but there are exceptions for minors between the ages of 15 and 18, and even for those under 15.\n\nAlthough there is no legal minimum wage rate, a monthly wage rate of $85 was used by employers and employees as a minimum standard. The standard legal workweek was put at 40 hours per week, and included standard benefits such as days off, overtime, and health and safety standards.\n\nAGRICULTURE\n\nAs of 2003, there are only about 190,000 hectares (469,000 acres) of arable land and permanent crops in East Timor, or about 12.8% of the land area. With generally poor and shallow soil, steep terrain, and an unreliable climate, most farming was at a subsistence level. The farming system was based on slash-and-burn. In the north and a few fertile areas of the south, maize, cassava, cowpeas, and sweet potatoes are primary crops. Rice is cultivated in lowlands with the help of irrigation systems. The main harvest for maize occurs from February through April. The main harvest for rice occurs from May through September in the north and from August through November in the south. Other agricultural products include soybeans, cabbage, mangoes, bananas, vanilla, mung beans, taro (swamp and upland), onions, peanuts, sago, coconuts, and tobacco.\n\nCoffee serves as an important cash crop, with over 60% of the country's organic coffee being produced in the Ermera district. Bobanaro, Oecussi, Viqueque, and Baucau are the most important food producing districts. In 2003, agriculture accounted for about 25% of the GDP.\n\nANIMAL HUSBANDRY\n\nMost livestock production is based on household farms, with larger animals kept primarily for household use and consumption, while pigs and smaller animals are sold for cash. Although there are some large herds of cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats, most farms keep smaller numbers of a variety of animals. In 2005, the estimated livestock populations were: 80,000 goats, 25,000 sheep, 360,000 pigs, 2.2 million chickens, 171,000 cattle, 100,000 buffalo, and 48,000 horses.\n\nFISHING\n\nCoastal communities have historically relied on fishing as a main source of food and income, with catches that include large tuna, flying fish, coral reef fish, and deepwater snapper. The violence following independence caused serious damage and destruction to nearly 90% of the boats and gear of these communities, as well as to the onshore processing infrastructure. The industry was slowly moving toward recovery through the work of the Department of Fisheries and the Marine Environment (DFME) in the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and with the help of various international volunteers and agencies. In 2003 officials from the DFME met with Australia's minister for primary industry and fisheries in Australia's Northern Territory to discuss training opportunities in tropical fisheries management.\n\nBesides working to recover maritime fishing activities, the DFEM was exploring options for inland hatcheries and freshwater fish production. One such project includeds breeding fish in rice fields.\n\nIn 2002, the DFME estimated that of the 20,000 fishermen in East Timor, over 50% were involved in fishing as their primary source of food and income. In 2003, the total catch was estimated at 350 tons.\n\nFORESTRY\n\nData from the government of Indonesia has shown the alarming trends of deforestation on the once forestrich lands of East Timor. In 1975, about 50% of East Timor's land was primary and secondary forest. By 1989, the figure dropped to about 41% and by 1999, only 1% of the land was forested. Most of the deforestation was conducted under logging operations for teak, redwood, sandalwood, and mahogany for export. The use of wood as a primary fuel source has added to the problem of diminishing forests.\n\nIn 2000, the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) issued Regulation 2000–17 to prohibit any logging operations that would include the export of logs, lumber, and/or furniture from East Timor. Burning and destruction of remaining forests for any reason was also prohibited. The UN Development Program (UNDP) launched several programs to counter deforestation as well as begin reforestation. These included a nationwide seed propagation program to establish community nurseries and encourage replanting of forestlands, particularly on hillsides and in areas where erosion is a problem. There were also subsidy programs proposed to provide lowcost kerosene and cookers to rural residents in an effort to reduce dependency on wood as fuel.\n\nMINING\n\nThere are small deposits of gold, manganese, and copper throughout the nation, but not enough to be considered for major commercial industries. Marble is present in significant quantities, but it seems uncertain as to whether or not the exploitation of such deposits would have a significant impact on the country's economy in the near future.\n\nENERGY AND POWER\n\nEast Timor's ability to develop its oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea will greatly affect the economy. By 2003, the government planned to introduce a petroleum fund, designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the management of oil and gas revenues. A $1.8 billion gas recycling project in the Bayu Undan offshore gas field began in April 2004; a $1.2 billion liquid natural gas production operation began at Bauy Undan in February 2006. Revenues from that and other projects began to flow in 2006. Fossil fuels account for 100% of electricity production.\n\nINDUSTRY\n\nBefore the Indonesian invasion in 1975, East Timor was self-sufficient in food and enjoyed revenue from the coffee industry. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) was one organization supporting East Timor's coffee industry in the early 2000s, especially through Cooperative Coffee Timor (CCT). East Timor at that time was heavily dependent upon food aid, however, and the agriculture industry was in need of development. Other industries include printing, soap manufacturing, handicrafts, and woven cloth. In 2004, industry accounted for 17.2% of GDP. The industrial production growth rate in 2005 was an estimated 8.5%.\n\nAs of 2006, the development of oil and gas resources had begun to raise government revenues ahead of schedule and above expectations, largely due to high petroleum prices, although factional violence threatened to undermine the progress that had been made.\n\nSCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nThere was no university in East Timor under the Portuguese. The Universitas Timor Timur (UNTIM) was established in 1986 under Indonesian rule. By 1998/99, it had nearly 4,000 students in three main faculties—agriculture, social and political sciences, and education and teacher training. The Indonesian government closed the UNTIM following the April 1999 demonstrations demanding an independence referendum. The Polytechnic in East Timor had technical courses based in Becora and at a campus in Hera; it provided courses in electrical and mechanical engineering, civil construction, and accounting. The education system was a target for destruction by the Indonesian military and their militias. The UNTIM and Polytechnic buildings in Dili and Hera were looted and burned. A new university was established by former UNTIM and Polytechnic staff and students, without funding from UNTAET. In September 2000, the government allotted $1.3 million to the university from East Timor's education budget. The National University of East Timor (Universidade Nacional Timor Lorosae—UNTL) opened for classes on 27 November 2000. There are five faculties: agriculture, political science, economics, education and teacher training, and engineering.\n\nDOMESTIC TRADE\n\nLocal businesses realized weak performance in the early 2000s, as they attempted to recover from violence that followed the referendum on independence. Traditional markets are filled by the local community, while foreignowned businesses are largely patronized by the wealthy. In 2001, the World Bank launched a $4.85 million small enterprises project, offering loans of $500 to $50,000 to East Timorese with viable business plans. The project also financed the delivery of business skills training to small and mediumsized enterprises.\n\nFOREIGN TRADE\n\nTrade in East Timor is dominated by foodstuffs, construction materials, electronics, and clothing. Some 97% of manufactured goods are imported, with coffee being the sole significant export. Indonesia, Australia and Portugal are East Timor's principal trade partners. East Timor in the mid-2000s was seeking trade partners to develop its oil and gas reserves, among them China and Malaysia. Coffee is exported to the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Italy, and the Netherlands, among other countries.\n\nBALANCE OF PAYMENTS\n\nThe external current account was in large deficit by 2003 (-$230 million), resulting in large measure from imports associated with donor-assisted reconstruction activities. The deficit was more than financed by official transfers, however, and, inclusive of these transfers, the external current account was in surplus ($37 million). In 2005, the CIA estimated exports at $10 million, excluding oil, and imports at $202 million in 2004. Development assistance during the 1990s totaled $81 million, increasing from $1 million in 1989 to more than $12 million in 1999. As of 2002, East Timor was receiving $2.2 billion in economic aid.\n\nBANKING AND SECURITIES\n\nThe finance sector is small, with a limited central bank role played by the Banking and Payments Authority (formerly the Central Payments Office). There are two operating branch offices of overseas banks (the ANZ Banking Group and the Banco Nacional Ultramarino) and informal lenders comprise the remainder of the finance sector.\n\nINSURANCE\n\nIt is possible to obtain insurance for vehicles in East Timor, although virtually no one does so. Most individuals involved in traffic accidents settle them informally. Thirdparty motor vehicle insurance is unavailable. Information on life or other forms of insurance was unavailable as of mid-2006.\n\nPUBLIC FINANCE\n\nThe US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) estimated that in 2004 central government took in revenues of approximately $107.7 million and had expenditures of $73 million. Revenues minus expenditures totaled approximately $34.7 million.\n\nTAXATION\n\nIn 2000, the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) issued a Revenue System for East Timor, providing the basis for a tax regime. It largely adopted the Indonesian income tax law with some modifications. East Timor's tax system is designed to tax business profits and designated passive income. Business profits include capital gains. Passive income includes interest, royalties, and rental and dividend income. The standard income tax rates for resident companies and individuals are 10% on the first $3,368; 15% on the next $3,368; and 30% on income over $6,737.\n\nEmployment-related income initially was not subject to income tax; however, a wage income tax (WIT) was levied for wages received on or after 1 January 2001. WIT applies to employment-related remuneration only, as opposed to general personal income. WIT is due as follows: the rate is 0% on monthly salaries of $0 to $100; 10% on monthly salaries of $101 to $650; and 30% on monthly salaries of $651 or more.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES\n\nExcise taxes are imposed on the import or domestic production (but not both) of certain goods. Goods are exempt from excise taxes if they are exported from East Timor within 28 days of production and are exempt from import duty, or if they relate to the Timor Gap Agreement. Goods subject to excise taxes included (but are not restricted to) the following: confectionery, fruit juices, ice cream, soft drinks, tobacco, gasoline, diesel fuel, beer, wine, other alcohol, makeup, shampoos, toiletries, electrical goods, mobile phones, televisions, automobiles, motorcycles, and arms and ammunition.\n\nAs of 2001, all imported goods were subject to an import duty of 5% of the customs value (CIF value).\n\nFOREIGN INVESTMENT\n\nMost foreign investment was from Singapore and Australia, and was centered in the hotel and restaurant business, the importation of used cars, and construction. The government encouraged foreign investment in light industries such as textile, garment, and shoe factories. Fishing and ecotourism also have potential for foreign investment (East Timor has some of the best scuba diving in Asia). Rudimentary infrastructure and a lack of skilled labor hamper investment. Investors have few guarantees regarding property rights, insurance, or bankruptcy. The labor law also serves to inhibit foreign investment because it is difficult for employers to fire East Timorese workers, and businesses are prohibited from hiring replacement employees during a strike.\n\nECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT\n\nAlthough East Timor was expected to rely upon significant amounts of foreign aid in the mid-2000s, it was on the path to greater self-reliance. In the context of a reduced international presence, the government was improving its administrative capacity and taking steps toward nation building in accordance with its National Development Plan (NDP). The country stood to benefit from the development of oil and gas reserves in the Timor Sea, which were expected to sharply increase government revenues. The NDP covering the fiscal years 2002/03–06/07 set out certain objectives, including the attainment of 5% growth in GDP over the medium term and the alleviation of poverty. The government indicated the need to develop the private sector and build up local institutions in addition to maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment. Other NDP goals included promoting good governance and creating jobs. The hightechnology oil and gas industry, while providing muchneeded income, does little to create jobs for the unemployed. In 2005, the parliament approved the creation of a Petroleum Fund to serve as a repository for all petroleum revenues and preserve the value of the country's petroleum wealth for future generations. The eruption of violence in mid-2006, which observers hope would be temporary, halted economic progress.\n\nSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nAs of 2003, humanitarian concerns remained at the forefront of social development in East Timor. The rehabilitation of roads was providing access to rural areas that otherwise would have remained isolated. Electricity was being brought to rural areas, which would increase the potential for social benefits. Watersupply projects improved access to safe water, and freed women and children from the task of collecting water. Increased emphasis was being placed upon nutrition and health programs. Market vendor loans were being granted equally to men and women, but certain group loans were disproportionately awarded to women. These loans were geared to support employment on farms and in households and small trading businesses.\n\nSome customary practices continue to discriminate against women, especially in remote villages. Domestic abuse and violence is a problem exacerbated by the failure of officials to investigate or prosecute. East Timorese women under Indonesian occupation were systematically raped, tortured, and imprisoned as sex slaves, and the process of recovery from that period was ongoing.\n\nEast Timor's constitution includes important human rights protections, including the right to a fair trial, criminal due process, freedom of expression, freedom of association, and freedom of religion. The constitution forbids the death penalty and life imprisonment, and includes the right to be free from torture, servitude, and cruel or degrading treatment. However, problems relating to the criminal justice system, including lengthy pretrial detentions and abuse of authority, remained unresolved as of 2006. In addition, the status of refugees wishing to return but fearful of reprisal remained unclear.\n\nHEALTH\n\nA large number of health centers and hospitals were severely damaged or destroyed due to independence related violence. The new nation also found itself lacking medical professionals, since the vast majority of health workers were Indonesian nationals who left the area. Post-independence, most health care has been provided by international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) under the general direction of the Division of Health Services, which works in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WHO) to develop healthcare policies and coordinate services throughout the country.\n\nHealth care was provided by 15 international NGOs, 6 local NGOs, 23 religious organizations, 4 military groups, and 2 private/business agencies. There were two hospitals operating in Dili and one in Baucau. In 2001, a program of District Health Plans included 64 community health centers, 88 health posts, and 117 mobile clinics. There is a laboratory in Dili. There were an estimated 2,000 health workers in the country, including 28 East Timorese doctors.\n\nEstimates suggest that the 2005 life expectancy rate was 65.90. The same year, infant mortality was estimated at 47.41 deaths per 1,000 live births. The fertility rate was estimated at 3.88 children born per woman. The birth rate was estimated at 28.07 births per 1,000 people. The most common causes of infant deaths have been infections, prematurity, and birth trauma. It was further estimated that 125 out of 1,000 children died before the age of five. In 2001, maternal mortality was estimated at 890 per 100,000 live births, with the most common cause of death being severe postpartum bleeding.\n\nIn 2000, the World Health Organization reported that 3–4% of all children ages six months to five years were acutely malnourished and 20% were chronically malnourished. Intestinal parasitic infections affect about 80% of all children. Other common childhood illnesses include acute respiratory diseases, diarrheal conditions, malaria, and dengue fever. An immunization program was reinstated in March 2000, which included a special campaign to immunize 45,000 children against measles. In November and December 2000, a nationwide polio immunization campaign reached about 84% of the population.\n\nEndemic diseases include malaria, leprosy, and lymphatic filiariasis. Tuberculosis is a major problem as well, affecting over 8,000 people as of 2000. Sexually transmitted diseases are prevalent. The major causes of death are communicable diseases (60%), noncommunicable diseases, chronic diseases, traffic accidents, and others.\n\nHOUSING\n\nHousing has been a serious problem since independence. Nearly 85,000 houses (about 70% of the nation's entire housing stock) were destroyed by the Indonesian military in September 1999. Though the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) and a number of international aid organizations responded quickly with temporary shelter kits, rebuilding of permanent housing has been slow and property ownership disputes have not been fully addressed.\n\nTens of thousands of residents fled the country during the violence and those who remained sought shelter in abandoned homes. As property owners returned to their homes, many found occupants claiming ownership and unwilling to leave. Some occupants have demanded large payments from the owners for \"housesitting\" or \"improvements\" made to the homes in the owner's absence. Through a proposed Land and Property Commission, it has been generally recognized that the original owners or tenants of a property have the right to eventual restitution and reoccupancy, but administration and enforcement of such rights has been a low priority as the government struggled to rebuild an entire nation and care for the emergency needs of its people.\n\nAs of 2006, it was still difficult to estimate housing demand. Besides the vast number of those within the country who have been left homeless and/or with inadequate shelter and facilities, there were (as of the close of 2002) thousands of East Timorese refugees waiting to return from the West Timor territory and Australia.\n\nIn urban areas such as Dili, Bacau, and Alieu, homes have been typically built from concrete. A majority of the population lives in rural areas with homes made from bamboo, wood, and thatch.\n\nEDUCATION\n\nOver 90% of all school buildings were severely damaged or destroyed by the Indonesian military and in the exodus of Indonesians out of East Timor, the nation lost 20% of its primary school teachers and 80% of secondary teachers, most of whom are not expected to return. UNICEF and other international aid organizations responded fairly quickly, however, reestablishing classes for 420 of the country's 800 primary schools by December 1999 plus an additional 273 schools by April 2000.\n\nIn 2001, East Timor appointed its first minister of education. At the beginning of the 2001 academic year, there were about 240,000 primary and secondary school students enrolled in classes with over 700 primary schools, 100 junior secondary schools, 40 preschools, and 10 technical colleges. About 6,000 teachers were employed.\n\nThe education system includes six years of primary education and six years of secondary education. In 2000, the language of instruction was Indonesian, but this has been a subject of debate. Many are encouraging a switch to the national language of Tetum as a primary language with Portuguese and English as secondary languages.\n\nThe National University of East Timor (Universidade Nacional Timor Lorosae—UNTL) opened for classes on 27 November 2000 and had about 5,000 students in attendance in 2003. There are five faculties at the university: agriculture, political science, economics, education and teacher training, and engineering. All new students follow a course including human rights, ethics, philosophy of science, and Timorese history.\n\nThe literacy rate as of 2002 was 58.6% of the population ages 15 and over.\n\nLIBRARIES AND MUSEUMS\n\nAs of 2002, it was proposed that a new National Library of East Timor would be established in the old VilaVerde building, along with a National Archive. As of 20065, a progress report toward this initiative was unavailable. The new university, the Universidade Nacional Timor Lorosae (UNTL), was established in 2000 as an amalgamation of the UNTIM and the Polytechnic. The new UNTL library, housed in a former gymnasium, opened for student access on 21 January 2002. A variety of Australian organizations have been raising funds to support the reconstruction of an East Timor public library system.\n\nWith assistance from UNESCO and the World Bank, work on a National Museum and Culture Center of East Timor began in late 1999, but at the time there were no artifacts to display and no one to administer the museum. The Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) providing training for the establishment of the museum. Following the renovation of the first wing of the museum, an exhibition of Timorese textiles and artifacts from the former national museum were to be held.\n\nMEDIA\n\nTelecommunication services, which were cut off by the Indonesian government, are being restored through the help of Australian companies, one of which had established a cellular telephone network service. International communication authorities have approved an individual country code (670) for East Timor.\n\nAs of 2004, there were two daily newspapers, three weeklies, and several bulletintype newspapers with sporadic publication and circulation. These include the Suara Timor Lorosae (daily), Timor Post (daily), and Jornal Nacional Semanario (weekly).\n\nThe government-operated Public Broadcast Service (PBS) has a radio station with nationwide reception and a television station that broadcasts only in Dili and Baucau. There were 16 community radio stations, with at least one in each district. The new constitution provides for the freedom of speech and press and the government generally respects these rights in practice. In 2005, there were an estimated 1,000 Internet users, with approximately 200 Internet service providers. In January 2005, the country's domain name extension was officially changed from. tp to. tl.\n\nORGANIZATIONS\n\nStudent organizations in East Timor were influential in the nation's independence campaign and have continued to speak out for civil rights. The National Student Resistance of East Timor (Resistencia Nacional Dos Estudantes De Timor Leste) began in 1988 as an underground organization of Indonesian university students. The East Timor Students Solidarity Council originated in 1998 at the National University of East Timor. It has since set up regional groups throughout the country to represent the views of university and high school students and faculty. Catholic youth organizations have formed. There are also youth scouting groups active in the new nation.\n\nThere are a number of women's groups, covering political, health, and social issues, including Rede Feto Timor Lorosae, which serves as a network of about 15 individual groups.\n\nThe Cooperative Coffee Timor (CCT) is a federation of Timoreseowned organic coffee cooperatives that has received aid and developmental support from USAID. The Chamber of Commerce of East Timor and the National Association of East Timor Entrepreneurs are two major business associations in good standing.\n\nThere is a national chapter of the Red Cross Society.\n\nTOURISM, TRAVEL, AND RECREATION\n\nTourism is limited due to a lack of infrastructure and tourist facilities. There are at least 25 hotels in Dili; one of Dili's 2 luxury hotels is an anchored cruise ship. Scuba diving and whale- and dolphinwatching are tourist attractions, in addition to the country's beaches. The northern coast features white sand beaches, while the southern coast is rocky with occasional black sand beaches. There are elaborate intact coral reefs, populated by over 1,000 aquatic species. East Timor's colonial towns and rugged mountains are also popular with visitors.\n\nPassports are required. Visas may be obtained upon arrival for a fee, and are valid for 30 days. A certificate of vaccination against yellow fever is required if traveling from an infected area.\n\nIn 2005, the US Department of State estimated the daily cost of staying in East Timor at us$165.\n\nFAMOUS EAST TIMORESE\n\nMartinho da Costa Lopes (1918–1991) was a Timorese priest with close ties to the Portuguese colonial government and an early advocate for the Timorese people. In 1996, exiled proindependence leader José RamosHorta (b.1949) and Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo (b.1948) shared the Nobel Peace Prize. Bishop Belo was the highest representative of the Roman Catholic Church in predominantly Catholic East Timor, and was a strong advocate of nonviolent resistance. RamosHorta served as the UN representative for the East Timorese cause from 1976–89. José Alexandre \"Xanana\" Gusmão (b.1946) was a former Falintil (Armed Forces of National Liberation of East Timor) and Fretilin (Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor) guerrilla leader and East Timor's first president. He was imprisoned by the Indonesian army in 1992 and released in 1999. He was elected president in April 2002.\n\nDEPENDENCIES\n\nEast Timor has no territories or colonies.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nCardoso, Luís. The Crossing: A Story of East Timor.

The country includes the eastern half of Timor island as well as the Oecussi enclave in the northwest portion of Indonesian West Timor, and the islands of Atauro and Jaco. The mixed Malay and Pacific Islander culture of the Timorese people reflects the geography of the country on the border of those two cultural areas. Portuguese influence during the centuries of colonial rule resulted in a substantial majority of the population identifying itself as Roman Catholic. Some of those who consider themselves Catholic practice a mixed form of religion that includes local animist customs. As a result of the colonial education system and the 23-year Indonesian occupation, approximately 13.5% of Timorese speak Portuguese, 43.3% speak Bahasa Indonesia, and 5.8% speak English, according to the 2004 census. Tetum, the most common of the local languages, is spoken by approximately 91% of the population, although only 46.2% speak Tetum Prasa, the form of Tetum dominant in the Dili district. Mambae, Kemak, and Fataluku are also widely spoken. This linguistic diversity is enshrined in the country’s constitution, which designates Portuguese and Tetum as official languages and English and Bahasa Indonesia as working languages.\n\nHISTORY\n\nPortuguese and Dutch traders made the first western contact with East Timor in the early 16th century. Sandalwood and spice traders, as well as missionaries, maintained sporadic contact with the island until 1642, when the Portuguese moved into Timor in strength. The Portuguese and the Dutch, based at the western end of the island in Kupang, battled for influence until the present-day borders were agreed to by the colonial powers in 1906. Imperial Japan occupied East Timor from 1942-45. Portugal resumed colonial authority over East Timor in 1945 after the Japanese defeat in World War II.\n\nFollowing a military coup in Lisbon in April 1974, Portugal began a rapid and disorganized decolonization process in most of its overseas territories, including East Timor. Political tensions—exacerbated by Indonesian involvement—heated up, and on August 11, 1975, the Timorese Democratic Union Party (UDT) launched a coup d’état in Dili. The putsch was followed by a brief but bloody civil war in which the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN) pushed UDT forces into Indonesian West Timor. Shortly after the FRETILIN victory in late September, Indonesian forces began incursions into East Timor. On October 16, five journalists from Australia, Britain, and New Zealand were murdered in the East Timorese town of Balibo shortly after they had filmed regular Indonesian army troops invading East Timorese territory. On November 28, FRETILIN declared East Timor an independent state, and Indonesia responded by launching a full-scale military invasion on December 7. On December 22, 1975 the UN Security Council called on Indonesia to withdraw its troops from East Timor.\n\nDeclaring a provisional government made up of Timorese allies on January 13, 1976, the Indonesian Government said it was acting to forestall civil strife in East Timor and to prevent the consolidation of power by the FRETILIN party. The Indonesians claimed that FRETILIN was communist in nature, while the party’s leadership described itself as social democratic. Coming on the heels of the communist victories in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, the Indonesian claims were accepted by many in the West. Major powers also had little incentive to confront Indonesia over a territory seen as peripheral to their security interests. Nonetheless, the widespread popular support shown for the guerilla resistance launched by the Timorese made clear that the Indonesian occupation was not welcome. The Timorese were not permitted to determine their own political fate via a free vote, and the Indonesian occupation was never recognized by the United Nations.\n\nThe Indonesian occupation of Timor was initially characterized by a program of brutal military repression. Beginning in the late 1980s, however, the occupation was increasingly characterized by programs to win the “hearts-and-minds” of the Timorese through the use of economic development assistance and job creation while maintaining a strict policy of political repression, although serious human rights violations—such as the 1991 Santa Cruz massacre—continued. Estimates of the number of Timorese who lost their lives to violence and hunger during the Indonesian occupation range from 100,000 to 250,000. On January 27, 1999, Indonesian President B.J. Habibie announced his government’s desire to hold a referendum in which the people of East Timor would chose between autonomy within Indonesia and independence. Under an agreement among the United Nations, Portugal, and Indonesia, the referendum was held on August 30, 1999. When the results were announced on September 4—78% voted for independence with a 98.6% turnout—Timorese militias organized and supported by the Indonesian military (TNI) commenced a large-scale, scorched-earth campaign of retribution. While pro-independence FALINTIL guerillas remained cantoned in UN-supervised camps, the militia and the TNI killed approximately 1,300 Timorese and forcibly relocated as many as 300,000 people into West Timor as refugees. The majority of the country’s infrastructure, including homes, irrigation systems, water supply systems, and schools, and nearly 100% of the country’s electrical grid were destroyed. On September 20, 1999 the Australian-led peacekeeping troops of the International Force for East Timor (INTER-FET) deployed to the country, bringing the violence to an end.\n\nGOVERNMENT AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS\n\nEast Timor became a fully independent republic on May 20, 2002, following approximately two and a half years under the authority of the UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). The country has a parliamentary form of government with its first parliament formed from the 88-member Constituent Assembly chosen in free and fair, UN-supervised elections in August 2001. The 29-member Cabinet is dominated by the FRETILIN Party, which won the majority of Assembly seats. Mari Alkatiri, FRETILIN’s Secretary General, was the first Prime Minister and Head of Government, and Xanana Gusmao—elected in free and fair elections on April 14, 2002—is President and Head of State. UNTAET’s mandate ended with East Timor’s independence, but a successor organization, the UN Mission for the Support of East Timor (UNMISET), was established to provide additional support to the government. UNMISET’s mandate expired on May 20, 2005 after the UN Security Council unanimously approved the creation of a small special political mission in East Timor, the UN Office in East Timor (UNOTIL), to take its place.\n\nUnder the constitution ratified in March 2002, “laws and regulations in force continue to be applicable to all matters except to the extent that they are inconsistent with the Constitution.” Many Indonesian and UNTAET laws and regulations remain in effect, but are being gradually replaced by RDTL laws. During\n\nthe period from December 2004 to September 2005, the government held local elections in all 13 districts. East Timor witnessed its largest and longest political demonstration in April and May 2005 when several thousand protestors took part in a protest about a broad array of religious and political issues led by the Catholic Church that lasted 20 days. The demonstration ended peacefully with the signing of an agreement between the Catholic Church and Prime Minister Alkatiri that resolved several key issues of disagreement.\n\nDespite the winding down of the UN presence in country, the institutions comprising East Timor’s armed forces (F-FDTL) and police (PNTL) remained fragile and the authority of the state much more tenuous than most observers assumed at the time. In February 2006, approximately 400 military personnel (from a total military strength of 1,400) petitioned President Gusmao to address their complaints of discrimination against “westerners” or Loro Monu people by “easterners” or Loro Sae people in the military. Shortly after presenting their petition, they left their posts and approximately one month later were dismissed by the F-FDTL commander. In late April the petitioners group staged protests in Dili. On April 28, the protests turned violent. Citing ineffective police response, the government called in the armed forces (F-FDTL) to respond. The rioting and the police and military response resulted in six confirmed deaths. In response to the events of April 28, large numbers of people began to flee their homes for internally displaced persons (IDP) camps or the outlying districts and several members of the F-FDTL, including the commander of the Military Police, left their posts in protest of the military intervention.\n\nDuring a FRETILIN Party Congress in mid-May, Prime Minister Alkatiri was re-elected as Secretary General after his supporters successfully amended the party constitution to substitute secret ballots with an open vote. Against this political backdrop, a series of deadly clashes between the F-FDTL and forces comprising dissident military, civilians and some police took place on May 23-24, followed by deadly conflict between the F-FDTL and the PNTL on May 25. In the aftermath of these clashes, which effectively caused the dissolution of law and order, mob and gang violence took over the capital, resulting in additional deaths, widespread destruction of property, and the continued displacement of thousands of Dili residents. At the peak of the crisis, approximately 80,000 IDPs were in the districts and approximately 70,000 were residing in camps within Dili.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and international relief organizations have provided vital services to the camps that include water and sanitation facilities, camp management support, hygiene kits, and mosquito nets. USAID has also supported East Timor’s independent public radio and television broadcast services in order to ensure that reliable and timely information about current political events reaches East Timor’s citizens.\n\nOn May 28, the Government of East Timor requested the Governments of Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Portugal to send security forces to stabilize the country. By July 2006 there were approximately 2,200 international military and police officers in East Timor. During the month of June, there was increasing pressure on then Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri to resign as criticisms of his handling of the crisis mounted. Moreover, serious allegations emerged that he had been involved in illegal arms distribution.\n\nIn June, former Minister of Interior Rogerio Lobato was arrested on the charge of distributing the abovementioned weapons and placed under house arrest. Following President Xanana Gusmao’s public request that the prime minister step down, accompanied by a threat to resign himself if Alkatiri remained in office, Alkatiri resigned on June 27. Anti-Alkatiri demonstrations, which kicked off on June 28, with most participants coming from the western districts, turned into partial celebrations following the prime minister’s resignation and lasted for several days. Similar numbers of demonstrators entered Dili from the eastern districts the following week to voice support for Alkatiri and the ruling Fretilin party.\n\nAfter President Gusmao held consultations with the leadership of the FRETILIN Party, Jose Ramos-Horta—East Timor’s Foreign and Defense Minister in the Alkatiri government—became Prime Minister on July 10. Prime Minister Ramos-Horta’s new cabinet was sworn in on July 14, 2006. Ramos-Horta said the “immediate task of his Government is to consolidate security in Dili and in all of Timor-Leste and to put in place the necessary conditions to enable displaced Timorese to return home and rebuild their lives.” As requested by the Government of East Timor, the UN Security Council passed resolutions to roll over the small UN political mission, UNOTIL until August 25, 2006 while its members considered the mandate of a larger follow-on UN mission to help East Timor overcome its crisis. The United States coordinated closely with members of the Core Group on East Timor (Australia, Brazil, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Kingdom) and the EU to obtain approval of the UN Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste (UNMIT), which provides for a UN-led policing component of up to 1,608 personnel. UNMIT’s mandate, set forth in UN Security Council Resolution 1704 approved on August 25, 2006, calls for the UN mission to assist in restoring stability, rebuilding the institutions comprising the security sector, supporting the Government of East Timor in conducting presidential and parliamentary elections (expected in the spring of 2007), achieving accountability for the crimes against humanity and other atrocities committed in 1999, among other aims. (UNMIT’s own website provides additional information: http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmit/)\n\nAlthough security in Dili has been significantly improved in comparison to the violence and anarchy that reigned in May and June, neither the establishment of a new government nor the expansion of the UN mission has reduced the levels of violence and criminality to their pre-April 2006 levels. Indeed, in October, shortly after the UN Special Commission of Inquiry issued its report on responsibility for the security crisis of April-June, Dili experienced a surge of violence that led to several deaths and the closure of the international airport for a day. While the overwhelming majority of the current violence is Timorese-on-Timorese perpetrated by gangs or martial arts groups, foreign nationals have also been targeted. Differences between Loro Sae and Loro Monu have recently subsided and been overtaken by longstanding conflicts between members of competing groups, including martial arts groups and semi-religious sects. While much of the current fighting reflects a continuing lack of law and order underscored by the absence of judicial accountability, many observers note that communal and gang violence has been employed in many cases toward political ends.\n\nAs of December 2006, over 28,000 displaced persons remain in 29 camps in and around Dili, representing over 4,000 families, 45 percent of whom have houses that have been destroyed. Over 2,000 houses were destroyed over the last months, and many more damaged. Another 70,000 or so IDPs remain in the outlying districts. November and December 2006 featured public efforts by the Timorese leadership to foster a spirit of reconciliation–particularly among members of the armed forces and the police–but key issues remain outstanding, including the lack of resolution of the petitioners’ case and the continued presence of armed military dissidents. Police functions in Dili are currently under UN control, while members of the PNTL are being gradually reintegrated into city policing following vetting for criminal or ethical violations. UN officials and other observers expect the reform of the country’s security sector to be a long-term challenge.\n\nPrincipal Government Officials\n\nLast Updated: 7/24/2006\n\nPresident: Kay Rala Xanana GUSMAO\n\nPrime Minister: Jose RAMOS-HORTA\n\nFirst Dep.

For more information, consult the government’s website: http://www.timor-leste.gov.tl/\n\nECONOMY\n\nAs the poorest nation in Asia, East Timor must overcome formidable challenges. Basic income, health, and literacy indicators are among the lowest in Asia. Severe shortages of trained and competent personnel to staff newly established executive, legislative, and judicial institutions hinder progress. Rural areas, lacking in infrastructure and resources, remain brutally poor, and the relatively few urban areas cannot provide adequate jobs for the country’s growing labor force. Many cities, including the country’s second largest, Baucau, do not have routine electrical service. Rural families’ access to electricity and clean water is very limited. Unemployment and under-employment combined are estimated to be as high as 70%. While revenues from offshore oil and gas reserves offer great hope for the country, effective use of those resources will require a major transformation of the country’s current human and institutional infrastructure. Meanwhile, as those substantial revenues come on line, foreign assistance levels—now standing at among the highest worldwide on a per capita basis—will likely taper off.\n\nEast Timor has made significant progress in a number of areas since independence. It has become a full-fledged member of the international community, joining the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The Government of East Timor has drafted a National Development Plan, and its Constituent Assembly has transitioned into a National Parliament that has commenced reviewing and passing legislation.\n\nIn July 2005, Parliament unanimously passed a law creating a petroleum fund to effectively manage and invest oil revenues to ensure these funds are invested in the country’s development after exploitation of these resources ends. While a nascent legal system has been put into place, the justice system remains among the weakest performing sector of government, still unable to perform its most basic functions without substantial assistance by outside professionals. Efforts are underway to put in place the institutions required to protect human rights, rebuild the economy, create employment opportunities, and reestablish essential public services.\n\nFOREIGN RELATIONS\n\nEast Timor joined the United Nations on September 27, 2002. It is pursuing membership in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and became a member of the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in July 2005. East Timor’s foreign policy has placed a high priority on its relationships with Indonesia; regional friends such as Malaysia and Singapore; and donors such as Australia, the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Portugal.\n\nIndonesia-East Timor Relations\n\nEast Timor and Indonesia have full diplomatic relations. In 2005 Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono made a successful trip to East Timor, including a visit to the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili where Indonesian troops had massacred hundreds of Timorese in 1991. Yudhoyono prayed and laid a heart-shaped wreath at the cemetery, symbolizing the improving ties between the two nations.\n\nAfter the Indian Ocean tsunami devastated parts of Indonesia, the East Timor Government contributed humanitarian assistance to the victims. Likewise, the Indonesian Government has sent humanitarian assistance to help those displaced by the unrest in Dili this year.\n\nIn 2005, both nations created a bilateral Truth and Friendship Commission (TFC) in order “to establish the conclusive truth in regard to the events prior to and immediately after the popular consultation in 1999, with a view to promoting reconciliation and friendship, and ensuring the non-recurrence of similar events.” The United States has encouraged both Indonesia and East Timor to ensure that the TFC achieves a credible outcome and that the TFC process is transparent, holds public hearings, has international participation, and names the names of those individuals who perpetrated the serious crimes. Respected international human rights groups, however, have criticized the TFC because its limited terms of reference for achieving these ends do not provide for prosecutions or similar measures to achieve accountability, and because the TFC has made no clear progress to date.\n\nU.S.-EAST TIMOR RELATIONS\n\nEast Timor maintains an embassy in Washington, DC, as well as a Permanent Mission in New York at the United Nations. The United States has a large bilateral development assistance program—$23.3 million in fiscal year 2005—and also contributes funds as a major member of a number of multilateral agencies such as the Asian Development Bank and World Bank. The U.S. Peace Corps has operated in East Timor since 2002, but it ceased operations in May 2006 due to the unrest and instability.\n\nPrincipal U.S. Embassy Officials\n\nDILI (E) Address: Av.de Portugal, Pantai Kelapa, Dili, East Timor; APO/FPO: American Embassy-Jakarta, Unit 8129, Box D, APO AP 96520; Official pouch: 8250 Dili Place, Washington, D.C. 20521-8250; Phone: (670) 332-4684; Fax: (670) 331-3206; Workweek: 8:00 am–5:00 pm.\n\nAMB:Gary GrayDCM:Seiji ShiratoriPOL/ECO:Elizabeth S.

Wharton\n\nLast Updated: 1/15/2007\n\nTRAVEL\n\nConsular Information Sheet : January 18, 2007\n\nCountry Description: Occupying 5,743 square miles on the eastern half of an island in the Timor Sea between Indonesia and Australia, East Timor has a population of approximately 925,000 people. East Timor became independent on May 20, 2002, and is now a democratically governed, independent nation with an elected President and Parliament.\n\nIn the violence that followed East Timor’s 1999 independence referendum, its infrastructure, never robust, was totally destroyed and has been only partially rebuilt. In April 2006 violence erupted again in and around the capital, Dili, resulting in further damage to infrastructure. Electricity, telephone and telecommunications, roads and lodging remain unreliable, particularly outside of the capital. East Timor’s economy relies largely on international assistance and revenues from oil and gas production.\n\nEntry/Exit Requirements: A passport valid for six months beyond the intended date of departure from East Timor is required. Tourist visas are not required prior to arrival, but travelers arriving in East Timor without a visa will need to pay a $30 fee for the 30-day visa. There is an additional fee for each 30-day renewal of this tourist visa. Visit the Embassy of East Timor web site at www/un.int/timor-leste for the most current visa information. Visitors traveling via air must transit either Darwin, Australia or Bali, Indonesia en route to East Timor.\n\nSafety and Security: The Department of State has issued a Travel Warning urging Americans to defer non-essential travel to East Timor. On May 30, 2006 the Department of State ordered the departure of all family members and non-emergency American employees at U.S. Embassy Dili. This order was lifted on July 14, 2006 and the Embassy returned to normal operations. On May 8, 2006 the Peace Corps announced the suspension of its operations in East Timor.\n\nAfter the August 1999 United Nations (UN)—sponsored independence referendum, violence swept East Timor, including widespread looting and burning and, in some cases, murder. UN peacekeeping forces quickly restored stability to the country. Despite a continuing UN presence following independence, state institutions comprising the security sector remained fragile. When demonstrations in April 2006 protesting the Government’s dismissal of 595 members of the armed forces escalated into rioting, civil order in and around the capital Dili broke down. Opposing factions within the security forces and the national police clashed, and widespread gang violence swept the capital. Differences among Easterners (Loro’sae) and Westerners (Loromonu) emerged as a major line of division within the country and were often an element in violent clashes, although this appeared to have subsided by late 2006; however, conflict between competing gangs and groups continued to be a problem. Tens of thousands of Timorese fled the violence and settled in camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs). The Government asked Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Portugal to send in security forces to assist in restoring order. At the Government’s request, the UN Security Council extended its mission in East Timor. On August 25, 2006, the UN Security Council approved a new expanded mission (the UN Integrated Mission for Timor-Leste, or UNMIT) providing for a policing component of up to 1,608 personnel. A separate military peacekeeping force also remains under Australian leadership. For more information on UNMIT, consult: http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/missions/unmit/. The Timorese national police (PNTL) in Dili were disbanded and are being reconstituted under UNMIT guidance. As of December 2006, with about 900 Australian-led security forces in place and a UN Police contingent of just over 1,000, authorities have made some progress toward restoring public security.\n\nGang violence in Dili is less widespread than it was during the period from May to October 2006. Nevertheless, criminal violence remains more pervasive than it was prior to April 2006. While the overwhelming majority of gang-related criminal violence has been Timorese on Timorese, foreigners have been caught up in such violence and there were credible reports of anti-Western attacks, most recently during a surge of violence in Dili in October 2006. One foreigner has since been killed (a Brazilian missionary in November), and a Timorese interpreter working for the UN Police was killed as a result of riots following a concert for peace in December 2006. About 28,000 internally displaced persons remain in camps in and around Dili, several of which have been sites of recurring incidents of violence.\n\nAmericans are advised that international security officials and UN police occasionally establish security checkpoints along roads. These legitimate checkpoints are intended to enhance security and should be respected. There are also occasional illegal checkpoints which Americans should avoid, but which to date have been primarily targeted at Timorese. Americans traveling in East Timor should remember that despite its small size, much of the territory is isolated and can be difficult to reach by available transportation or communication links.\n\nAmerican citizens who choose to travel to or remain in East Timor should use common sense and exercise caution, avoid large gatherings, and remain alert with regard to their personal security, avoiding travel after dark to the extent possible. Americans should exercise caution with respect to all threats, especially in public places including, but not limited to, clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreational events, hotels, resorts and beaches and other locations frequented by foreigners. Travelers and residents should always ensure that passports and important personal papers are in order in the event it becomes necessary to leave the country quickly for any reason. Likewise, travelers should be aware that the U.S. Embassy in Dili is not able to issue emergency passports and has only limited capacity to process passport renewals.\n\nFor the latest security information, Americans traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department’s Internet web site where the current Travel Warnings and Public Announcements, including the Worldwide Caution Public Announcement, can be found. Up-to-date information on safety and security can also be obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the U.S. and Canada, or for callers outside the U.S. and Canada, a regular toll-line at 1-202-501-4444. These numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. federal holidays).\n\nCrime: Crimes such as pick pocketing, residential and automobile break-ins and theft occurs throughout the country, but are more frequent in Dili, the capital. Victims who resist may be subject to physical violence. Gang related violence occurs, and has targeted foreign nationals. Stone-throwing attacks on vehicles are common, and have resulted in serious injury and death. Visitors should avoid travel at night or in unfamiliar areas alone. Women should avoid traveling alone, especially at night because sexual assault or banditry is possible. East Timor is a socially conservative country, and travelers should avoid wearing revealing clothing, particularly in crowded public areas such as markets.\n\nInformation for Victims of Crime: The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. If you are the victim of a crime while overseas, in addition to reporting to local police, please contact the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate for assistance. The Embassy/Consulate staff can, for example, assist you to find appropriate medical care, contact family members or friends and explain how funds could be transferred. Although the investigation and prosecution of the crime is solely the responsibility of local authorities, consular officers can help you to understand the local criminal justice process and to find an attorney if needed.\n\nMedical Facilities and Health Information: Although limited emergency medical care is available in Dili, options for routine medical care throughout the country are extremely limited. Serious medical problems requiring hospitalization and/or medical evacuation to Australia, the nearest point with acceptable medical care, or to the United States, can cost thousands of dollars.\n\nInformation on vaccinations and other health precautions, such as safe food and water precautions and insect bite protection, may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s hotline for international travelers at 1-877-FYI-TRIP (1-877-394-8747) or via the CDC’s internet site at http://www.cdc.gov/travel. For information about outbreaks of infectious diseases abroad consult the World Health Organization’s (WHO) website at http://www.who.int/en. Further health information for travelers is available at http://www.who.int/ith/en/.\n\nMedical Insurance: The Department of State strongly urges Americans to consult with their medical insurance company prior to traveling abroad to confirm whether their policy applies overseas and whether it will cover emergency expenses such as a medical evacuation.\n\nTraffic Safety and Road Conditions: While in a foreign country, U.S. citizens may encounter road conditions that differ significantly from those in the United States. The information below concerning East Timor is provided for general reference only, and may not be totally accurate in a particular location or circumstance.\n\nAll traffic operates on the left side of the road, and most vehicles use right-hand drive. Roads are often poorly maintained and four-wheel drive may be required in some areas. Non-existent lighting and poor road conditions make driving at night hazardous. Taxis are available in Dili, but their number has declined significantly since the security crisis that began in April 2006. Small buses and mini-vans provide public transportation in Dili and elsewhere. However, public transportation is generally overcrowded, uncomfortable, and below international safety standards. Public transportation has also been known to unexpectedly drop passengers at locations other than their destination due to transit operators’ fears about certain areas or hours. Disagreement about fares has occasionally led to hostilities.\n\nDriving in Dili is especially hazardous, with large trucks and military vehicles sharing the streets with vendors, pedestrians and livestock. Many cars and especially motorcycles operate at night without lights.\n\nDuring the rainy season, travel on all cross-island roadways should be considered to be risky. U.S. citizens should use caution when traveling on the cross-island roadways in the mountain areas of Aileu, Ermera, Manatuto, Ainaro and Manufahi provinces. In December 2003, rain showers severely damaged several cross-island roadways, and several UN vehicles had to be airlifted out of the area south of Aileu due to landslides and roadway damage.\n\nAccidents are frequent. When there is an accident, the police should be contacted. It is not uncommon for bystanders to attack the driver perceived to be responsible for a traffic accident. This is more common in rural areas and in accidents involving East Timorese drivers, but crowds have occasionally attacked expatriate drivers at the scene of an accident. If a U.S. citizen involved in an accident reasonably believes that there is a threat of bodily harm from people at the scene of the accident, it is advisable to drive to the police station or U.S. Embassy before stopping.\n\nWhile it is possible to obtain insurance for vehicles in East Timor, only a handful of foreigners have done so, and virtually no one else has automobile insurance. Most traffic accidents are settled informally between those involved. Visit the website of the country’s national tourist office and national authority responsible for road safety at http://www.timorleste.gov.tl.\n\nAviation Safety Oversight: As there is no direct commercial air service between the United States and East Timor, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has not assessed East Timor’s Civil Aviation Authority for compliance with International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) aviation safety standards. For more information, travelers may visit the FAA’s internet website at http://www.faa.gov.\n\nSpecial Circumstances: East Timor remains in a state of transition. The country faces severe capacity constraints and many civil and governmental institutions are still being developed. U.S. citizens traveling or doing business in East Timor may find it difficult to identify legal or administrative mechanisms should problems arise. The U.S. dollar is the official currency of East Timor. Money can be exchanged at the three banks in Dili, but only to or from a limited number of currencies. Only a few establishments accept credit cards, usually requiring a substantial additional fee, and visitors should be prepared to settle all bills in cash. Dili has two ATM machines that accept U.S.-issued bankcards. Travelers should not plan to rely exclusively on these machines, as they are frequently inoperative.\n\nCriminal Penalties: While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject to that country’s laws and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly from those in the United States and may not afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law. Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses. Persons violating East Timor’s laws, even unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned. Penalties for possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs in East Timor are severe, and convicted offenders can expect long jail sentences and heavy fines. Engaging in sexual conduct with children or using or disseminating child pornography in a foreign country is a crime, prosecutable in the United States.\n\nChildren’s Issues: For information on international adoption of children and international parental child abduction, see the Office of Children’s Issues website at http://travel.state.gov/family/family_1732.html.\n\nRegistration/Embassy Location: Americans living or traveling in East Timor are encouraged to register with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate through the State Department’s travel registration website so that they can obtain updated information on travel and security within East Timor. Americans without Internet access may register directly with the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate. By registering, American citizens make it easier for the Embassy or Consulate to contact them in case of emergency. The U.S. Embassy is located at Avenida de Portugal, Praia dos Coqueiros, Dili, East Timor, Tel: (670) 332-4684, Fax: (670)331-3206.\n\nTravel Warning : March 2, 2007\n\nThis Travel Warning is being updated to inform Americans of heightened security concerns in East Timor and to warn American citizens to defer travel to East Timor at this time. Americans currently in East Timor should evaluate carefully their safety and security in light of this Travel Warning. This supersedes the Travel Warning issued on November 1, 2006.\n\nThe Department of State advises Americans of heightened security concerns in East Timor in light of the current International Stabilization Force (ISF) operations in and around the town of Same, where forces have surrounded dissident military leader Alfredo Reinado. Americans are advised against travel to Same or adjacent areas, and to exercise caution in the western districts. ISF and UN Police (UNPOL) forces have recommended the evacuation of foreign nationals from Same. In a separate incident, the recent deaths of two Timorese citizens during an ISF intervention in Dili have contributed to the volatile security situation. On February 27, the Government of Indonesia temporarily closed its border with East Timor. The Government of Australia similarly has advised its citizens against travel to East Timor at this time and warns that Australians and Australian interests may be specifically targeted. Attackers could indiscriminately target foreigners, including Americans. The Australian travel advice can be viewed at http://www.smartraveller.gov.au/zw-cgi/view/Advice/East_Timor\n\nAfter the collapse of civil order in April and May 2006, international troops and police arrived. The security situation improved, but serious security concerns remain:\n\nIndiscriminate communal violence continues throughout the country. Gang-related violence occurs daily in Dili, and Americans risk intentional or inadvertent injury. Stone-throwing attacks on vehicles are frequent, and have affected American citizens on several occasions.\n\nSeveral areas of Dili have become sites of chronic security incidents, particularly the areas around the camps for internally displaced people (IDPs).
