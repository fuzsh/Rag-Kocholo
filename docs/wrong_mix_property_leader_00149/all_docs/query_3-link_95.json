        "text": "ALLEGATIONS A rebel leader accused the prime minister of hiring his group as a hit squad and said he would hand over the weapons only to the president as evidence\n\nAFP\n\nA rebel leader in East Timor yesterday rebuffed demands for his group to disarm immediately, saying he would only hand over the weapons directly to President Xanana Gusmao.\n\nVincente da Concecao has reportedly alleged that Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri paid his group of retired guerrilla fighters to ensure he was re-elected as the Fretilin party leader last month, but broke away from him.\n\nForeign Minister Jose Ramos-Horta traveled to a mountain village outside Liquica, 30km west of Dili, to ask da Concecao to follow Gusmao's order and hear his account of what happened.\n\nGreeted by traditional tribesmen in warrior garb and feather headdresses, Ramos-Horta asked that da Concecao follow the example of Major Alfredo Reinado, the leader of 600 rebel soldiers who began giving up arms last Friday.\n\n\"East Timor doesn't need weapons. We need food, medicines. We don't need weapons,\" the Nobel peace prize winner, who was guarded by Australian peacekeepers during his visit, told the militiamen.\n\n\"Everybody should cooperate with President Xanana,\" he said.\n\nBut da Concecao refused to do so immediately.\n\nProper authority\n\n\"I will only give these weapons to the president because they are evidence,\" he said, referring to his allegations. He did not elaborate.\n\nRamos-Horta, who is also defense minister, said the men wanted to hand over the arms.\n\n\"They don't want to keep these weapons, they want to get rid of them. But they want to get rid of them through proper authority, and that is our head of state and commander-in-chief, who would in turn surrender these weapons to force commanders,\" he said.\n\nHe said da Concecao and his group had asked that they be given protection \"for their well being as witnesses.\"\n\n\"What I heard was very disturbing in regard to the allegations that weapons were distributed to civilian individuals,\" he said.\n\n\"I do not form a judgment about whether these allegations are based on solid evidence. The truth can only be established by the international commission of investigation,\" he said, referring to a probe backed by the UN which began work last week.\n\nThe foreign minister said that he would convey da Concecao's message to the president, who would decide when he would be able to make the journey to accept the weapons.\n\n\"These elements have shown [themselves] to be very disciplined, but they were given orders by others,\" he added, without specifying who distributed the weapons.\n\nMeanwhile, Australian-led multinational forces fanned out across the capital yesterday amid reports that opponents of Alkatiri were planning a major protest this week.\n\nHuge protest\n\nThe security alert came as peacekeepers announced they had arrested a \"person of interest\" who \"posed a significant threat to security.\"\n\nAt least seven Malaysian armored personnel carriers and four Australian tanks patrolled the main Comoro highway leading into the capital, converging outside the headquarters of Alkatiri's Fretilin political party.\n\n\"This is a coordination between the Malaysian and Australian forces. We are expecting a huge protest tomorrow [today], and we want everyone to be safe,\" the commander of the Malaysian forces, Colonel Nazri Cheelah said.\n\nAustralian and Malaysian sol-diers armed with assault rifles and in full combat gear flagged down suspicious-looking vehicles and searched for weapons.\n\nThe tanks blocked a portion of the Comoro highway leading into Dili, causing a minor gridlock.\n\nMajor James Baker, spokesman for the Joint Task Force (JTF), said that Australian federal police arrested late Sunday an unnamed suspect involved in violence last month that killed 21 people.\n\n\"We have detained a person of interest and that person has been charged with weapons-related offenses,\" Baker said.\n\n\"The information that led to that person's capture was supplied to the JTF,\" he said.\n\n\"The arrest happened last night and full details are not yet available,\" he said, adding he was not at liberty to give the name of the detainee but the person \"posed a significant risk to public safety.\"\n\nEast Timor descended into crisis after Alkatiri sacked 600 sol-diers, or nearly half the tiny nation's armed forces, after they deserted complaining of discrimination because they came from the nation's west."
