It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor, the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco, and Occusse, an enclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. Australia is the country’s southern neighbor, separated by the Timor Sea. The country’s size is about 15,007 km. (5,794 sq,m)\n\nEast Timor was a de facto province of Indonesia, whose territory corresponded to the previous Portuguese Timor and to the presently independent country of Timor Leste.\n\nFrom 1702 to 1975 East Timor was an Overseas territory of Portugal named Portuguese Timor in 1974, Portugal initiated a gradual decolonization process of its remaining territories, including Portuguese Timor. During the process, a civil conflict between the different Timorse parties erupted in 1975. Indonesia invaded East Timor and in 1976, it formally annexed the territory, declaring it as its 27th province and remaining it Timor Timur. The United Nations, however, did not recognize the annexation, continuing to consider Portugal as the legitimate administering power of East Timor. Following the end of Indonesian occupation 1999, and a United Nations administered transition period, East Timor became formally independent of Portugal in 2002 and adopted the official name of Timor Leste.\n\nAfter the re-establishment of the independence of Timor Leste in 2002 the East Timorse government requested that the name Timor-Leste be used in place of East Timor. This is to avoid the Indonesian term and its reminder of the Indonesian Occupation. East Timor became the first new sovereign state of the 21st Century on 20 May 2002 and joined the United Nations and the community of Portuguese Language Countries in 2011. East Timor announced its intention to become the eleventh member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), it is one of only two predominantly Christian nations in Southeast Asia. The other being the Philippines, as well as the only Asian country to be located completely in the Southern Hemisphere.\n\nFelipe Cofreros Ph.D\n\nPREFACE\n\nAfter years as a United Nations [UN] Education and Public Information Officer in Same, Manufahi District and Dili City in East Timor, it is high time for me to write about EAST TIMOR: A NEW INDEPENDENT COUNTRY. Its contents were culled from the Voice of Manufahi - a United Nations [UN] newsletter of the Manufahi District in Same, East Timor, of which I was assigned as the Editor-in-Chief.\n\nIt has been a most exciting time and a tremendous privilege for me to work with the United Nations [UN] Ambassador’s and the local grassroots organization. I have, thanks to everyone’s support, embraced new activities, first in the humanitarian relief by logical progression to the promotion of human rights, resolution work and the resettlement of East Timorese refugees. Yet I am mindful that development is my true vocation, for which I have served the people of East Timor and the United Nations [UN] Volunteer Specialists and International Field Officers were at their most effective and right there with the people helping facilitate what the people themselves feel with best hasten the development they seek.\n\nAs a United Nations [UN] Volunteer Specialist assigned in local town of Same, Manufahi District in East Timor, I functioned diligently to enhance development in line with the United Nations Rehabilitation and Redevelopment programs in Manufahi District in particular and the new country of East Timor in general. Some worth while projects of the United Nations [UN] in Manufahi District in East Timor: Basic Education; Literacy; Language Training; Poverty Reduction; Participatory and Sustainable Development; Proper Usage of Water; Temporary Employment Projects [TEPs]; Cooperatives; English as a Second Language [ESL]; Adult Education; Rural Development; Small Business; Women in Development; Indigenous Programs; Livelihood Programs and planned Infrastructure Programs to Build a Learning Resource Center in Same, Manufahi District, East Timor.\n\nI served as Director for Academic Program for Same Learning and Resource Center and demonstrated how the local East Timorese perceived resources to build the first cafeteria in their area.\n\nI have my highest highs, and the moments when I felt low; both are part and parcel of being a United Nations [UN] Education and Public Information Officer.\n\nI dedicate this book EAST TIMOR: A NEW INDEPENDENT COUNTRY to all my former co-workers in the United Nations [UN] as a Volunteer Specialists and International Field Officers assigned in East Timor and other parts of the world.\n\nFelipe Cofreros Ph.D.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS"
