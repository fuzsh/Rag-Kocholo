        "text": "On August 30, 2009, East Timor's Prime Minister, the former resistance leader Xanana Gusmão, quietly authorized the release of a man directly implicated in one of the country's most notorious massacres. Maternus Bere, a commander of the pro-Indonesian Laksaur militia group, had been indicted for his role in the September 1999 killing of as many as 200 unarmed supporters of independence who had taken refuge in the Catholic Church in Suai. Of the 40 victims whose identities could be determined, three were priests, ten were under the age of 18, and more than a dozen were women. The Suai Church massacre was part of a shocking campaign of violence that followed a United Nations-organized referendum in which Timorese had voted overwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia.\n\n3 There is, of course, debate about whether the massive violence of this period constitutes genocide as defined in the UN Genocide Convention. Nevertheless, a growing number of scholars and human rights professionals maintain that at least in the colloquial sense of the word, and arguably even by its strict legal definition, this was genocide. See Robinson, Geoffrey, ‘If You Leave Us Here, We Will Die’ – How Genocide Was Stopped in East Timor, Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2010, chapters 1 and 3Google Scholar.\n\n11 While acknowledging that the transfer circumvented the law, Gusmão vehemently defended the move in Parliament, saying that it was in the “national interest” to place good relations with Indonesia ahead of due process. Likewise, in televised comments, Ramos-Horta said that “not all legal measures support the national interest.” ICG, Asia Briefing No. 122, p. 8.\n\n18 In a recent article, a former UN official cited eight studies that had made that case since 2008, and drew the same conclusions. Rees, Edward, “Time for the UN to Withdraw From East Timor?” Atlantic, December 21, 2010Google Scholar.\n\n19 These were: United Nations, Situation of Human Rights in East Timor, New York, December 1999Google Scholar; United Nations, Report of the International Commission of Inquiry on East Timor to the Secretary-General, New York, January, 2000Google Scholar; KPP-HAM, Laporan Penyelidikan Pelanggaran Hak Asasi Manusia di Timor Timur, Jakarta, January, 2000Google Scholar; United Nations Security Council, “Summary of the Report to the Secretary-General of the Commission of Experts to Review the Prosecution of Serious Violations of Human Rights in Timor-Leste (then East Timor) in 1999,” New York, May 26, 2006; CAVR, Chega!; and Robinson, Geoffrey, East Timor 1999: Crimes Against Humanity, Jakarta, 2006Google Scholar.\n\n20 Kofi Annan also argued at this time that before an international mechanism was set up, Indonesia should first be given an opportunity to hold perpetrators to account through its own judicial system.
