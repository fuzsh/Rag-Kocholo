        "text": "Major (Maj) Alfredo Reinado, rebel leader and former East Timorese military commander, attends Sunday Mass. Later, at a press conference in Maubisse, Maj Reinado and fellow rebel, Manuel Tilman, announced they are planning a conference to seek ways of modifying East Timorâ€™s constitution to allow greater power for President Xanana Gusmao. Current Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri 'does not have the confidence of the people', said Tilman. 'Time is the most dangerous weapon', said Reinado. Maj Reinado left the army in May 2006 to join approximately 600 former soldiers who had been fired in March 2006 after complaining of ethnic discrimination over promotions. This led to a national crisis which brought down the government of Mari Alkatiri. Civil unrest followed initially peaceful protests against the government, and continuing violence, looting and arson have disrupted Dili. The Australian-led international peacekeeping mission is attempting to restore calm and stability to the region. Approximately 2500 Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel, led by Brigadier Michael Slater, have been deployed on Operation Astute. The first elements of the force arrived the day after the request for assistance was received from the government of Timor-Leste.\n\nOpening Hours\n\n10 am to 5 pm daily (except Christmas Day)\n\nIn preparation for the daily Last Post Ceremony,\n\ngalleries are progressively closed from 3:40 pm.\n\nPublic entrance via Fairbairn Avenue, Campbell ACT 2612\n\nBook your ticket to visit: awm.gov.au/visit"
