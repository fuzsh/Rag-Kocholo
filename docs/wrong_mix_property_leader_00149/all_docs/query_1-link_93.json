        "text": "This book explains how history and traditions have shaped Timorese politics, as well as the role that Indonesia and ASEAN play for the country's future . It tries to understand a complex political system in which both traditional laws and contemporary politics are integrated, and examines the effects of Portuguese colonization, Indonesian neo-colonialism, United Nations missions, and electoral democracy. The volume also addresses broader issues such as the politics of modernization, the question of development, and youth education. The possibilities presented by the new president, Luo-Olo, as well as the upcoming parliamentary elections, make this project a timely contribution that confirms the vibrancy of East Timor's democratic process and bi-party political system.\n\nAccess this book\n\nSubscribe and save\n\nSpringer+ Basic\n\nEUR 32.99 /Month\n\nGet 10 units per month\n\nDownload Article/Chapter or eBook\n\n1 Unit = 1 Article or 1 Chapter\n\nCancel anytime\n\nSubscribe now\n\nBuy Now\n\neBook EUR 46.00\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nAvailable as EPUB and PDF\n\nRead on any device\n\nInstant download\n\nOwn it forever\n\nSoftcover Book EUR 58.84\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nCompact, lightweight edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nHardcover Book EUR 58.84\n\nPrice includes VAT (Germany)\n\nDurable hardcover edition\n\nDispatched in 3 to 5 business days\n\nFree shipping worldwide - see info\n\nTax calculation will be finalised at checkout\n\nOther ways to access"
