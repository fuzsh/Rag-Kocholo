The UN never recognized East Timor as being under Indonesian sovereignty. The UN Security Council established a UN Mission in East Timor (UNTAET) in 1999 to oversee a referendum in which the East Timorese voted for independence. The ballot was followed by violence perpetrated by pro-Indonesia militias. UNTAET acted as a transitional administration while the fragile nation rebuilt. East Timor achieved full independence on May 20, 2002, becoming the first new country of the 21st century. UNTAET was subsequently replaced by a UN Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET) in 2002, and transformed into a scaled down UNOTIL in 2005.\n\nWhile initially viewed as a success for UN peacekeeping and nation-building, a dispute within the new country's military in May 2006 led to violent clashes between the army and disaffected soldiers. The violence soon spread throughout the country, igniting latent hostilities between the various ethnic communities in East Timor. Following the government's appeal for international assistance, Australia, Malaysia, Portugal and New Zealand sent troops to attempt to restore order. Further violence erupted in East Timor following the attempted assassination of both President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao in February 2008. As a result, the Australian government sent 140 troops to the country to bolster the UN peacekeeping presence.\n\nThese pages look at the process of governance of East Timor, with commentary on the role played by the UN and its interaction with the interim East Timorese Cabinet, followed by the first election in August 2001 and what role the UN has played in building the new nation.\n\nUN Documents | Reports | Articles\n\nUN Documents\n\nÂ\n\nSecurity Council Resolution 1802 on Timor-Leste (February 25, 2008)\n\nThe Security Council has extended the mandate of the UN Mission in East Timor (UNMIT) by twelve months. The extension follows disturbances in the country after the attempted assassinations of the President and Prime Minister in February 2008, by a group loyal to rebel leader Alfredo Reinado. The mandate allows UNMIT to strengthen democratic institutions and support the police in providing a safe environment for Timorese citizens.\n\nStrengthening Accountability and Transparency in Timor-Leste (January 2006)\n\nThe UN has presented new East Timorese Prime Minister Jose Ramos Horta with this report aimed at strengthening government and the rule of law in the divided country. The report, drawn up by experts from the UN, UN Development Agency, the World Bank and the government of Finland, makes recommendations on fighting corruption, developing a code of ethics for public officials and on ensuring transparency in government. The UN hopes the implementation of the report will restore confidence in the government as East Timor attempts to recover from weeks of violence.

Observers are concerned about the economic implications of the missionâs departure because the UN mission pays a large sum in annual salaries and greatly contributes to the annual spending. Â However, the Timorese government believes that their petroleum wealth will be enough to make up for the lost support. (IRIN)\n\nTimor-Leste: Chronic Malnutrition Among World's Highest (February 25, 2011)\n\nAfghanistan, Yemen and Timor-Leste have the highest rates of chronically malnourished children in the world. Meat, eggs and dairy products are unaffordable for families in Timor-Leste.

The country's political leaders are the better placed to address instability than the international police force. Whilst there is much progress to be made, the UN mission's role has been rejected by the Timor-Leste government.

The same forces that led to the resignation of former Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri remain organized and well armed, undermining efforts at returning East Timor to stability. Alkatiri himself still possesses huge influence through his leadership of the Fretilin party.
