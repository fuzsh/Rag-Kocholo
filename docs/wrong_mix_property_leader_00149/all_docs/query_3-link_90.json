This public meeting is an auspicious occasion to commemorate a truly historic event; one that the United Nations including the Security Council has been deeply involved in and should be proud of making possible. I would like to thank all the delegations who have participated in this important meeting to welcome East Timor's independence, and to reaffirm the support and solidarity of the UN and international community with this newest nation.\n\nIt is only right that the leaders and people of East Timor are commended and congratulated, first and foremost. They have chosen their destiny, and displayed fortitude and resilience in the face of adversity to achieve it. They are cognisant of the challenges that the path ahead will bring, and are eager to shoulder their rightful responsibilities of government and nationhood. They have a vision for the State of East Timor and its society, and are determined to fulfil the goals that they have set out for themselves.\n\nMore than two and a half years ago, East Timor suffered violence, devastation and dislocation after the people of East Timor chose independence in a widely participated referendum. But throughout this difficult period, the East Timorese showed true courage and grit. With the help of the UN, they strived and toiled to build a nation from virtually nothing. They overcame, with an indomitable spirit, the difficulties that laid before them. From restoring peace and stability to building public administration capacities, helping refugees return to reviving the economy, the leaders and people of East Timor have worked hand-in-hand with the UN with much success. Their efforts have paid off. The new nation of East Timor has been born.\n\nAt the dawn of this new beginning, the East Timor leaders have taken the reins of government with enthusiasm. And the people have shown their readiness to work with the democratically elected Government. In fact, even before East Timor's independence, the Second Transitional Government under the leadership of Mr. Mari Alkatiri and civil society led by Mr. Xanana Gusmao had been deeply involved in putting together the National Development Plan - a blueprint for East Timor's development for the first five years of independence. Forming the Planning Commission that supervised the preparation of the plan, members of both groups worked closely together. In one of the widest consultative process seen anywhere, almost 40,000 East Timorese, covering virtually every suco (village) in the country, were consulted. The end result was a list of challenges that East Timor faces and has to address head-on - from education and health to agriculture and the economy to helping the poor and national unity.\n\nIt is clear from the National Development Plan that the leaders and people of East Timor recognise that independence is only the start of another long and difficult journey. But they have incisively come up with a national vision that will guide them on this arduous voyage. It is a bold vision. \"A democratic country with a vibrant traditional culture and a sustainable economy. A prosperous society with sufficient food, shelter, clothing and security for all its people. All East Timorese to be literate, skilled and participating in the economic, social and political life of the nation.\" The East Timorese are committed to implementing the ambitious National Development Plan over the next five years towards achieving these aspirations. They have great leaders in Mr. Xanana Gusmao, Mr. Mari Alkatiri and Mr. Jose Ramos-Horta to guide them. With a deep sense of history, each individual brings to the leadership qualities that bode well for East Timor's future - Mr. Gusmao with the charisma to bring about national reconciliation and unity, Mr. Alkatiri with his pragmatism in managing the country, and Mr. Ramos-Horta with his diplomatic skills in working with others both within and without the State. Singapore shares the confidence that the Security Council and the wider UN membership have in the East Timor Government and people. We wish them all the best in their quest to build a democratic, stable and viable State.\n\nBut as they embark on this quest, the East Timorese cannot go it on their own just yet. The UNDP said in its latest report that East Timor, having a population of more than 700,000 people, was Asia's poorest nation with an annual per capita GDP of US$478. There are high levels of illiteracy, high maternal and infant mortality, inadequate food supply, and high unemployment. And the major issue of land title is far from being resolved, which is a major barrier to foreign investment. Sustained international assistance to bolster their efforts is not only essential, but also paramount, during East Timor's early years of nationhood.\n\nThe UN system, member states, and non-governmental organisations have played an important role in the last two and a half years to bring East Timor to where it is today. Their efforts are laudable, and they should be applauded. Special tribute must certainly go to Secretary-General Kofi Annan for his personal efforts, and his Special Representative Sergio Vieira de Mello for the outstanding work that he had done together with his team in UNTAET. The contributions of member states to UNTAET should also receive special mention. For East Timor to succeed, the support of the UN and the international community will continue to be crucial. I note that this has been acknowledged by Council and non-Council members alike on many occasions, including at today's Public Meeting. The establishment of the UN Mission of Support in East Timor (UNMISET), and the pledge of US$360 million to support East Timor's economic development in last week's donors' conference in Dili are very positive starts.\n\nThe future of East Timor is also inextricably linked to the future of the region. Good relations between East Timor and its neighbours are therefore critical. The commitment of East Timor to build strong and robust ties with Indonesia is therefore very much welcomed. So too is Indonesia's readiness to cooperate with East Timor towards building a peaceful, unified and sustainable society. The visit of Mr. Xanana Gusmao to Jakarta earlier this month to meet President Megawati and other Indonesian leaders and the attendance of President Megawati at the East Timor independence ceremony are very positive signs of the maturing relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe people of East Timor have made huge sacrifices. The UN has put in great efforts to restore peace to the territory. And the international community has made massive investments in the country. All of us have a responsibility, if not an obligation, to make East Timor a real success story. We should not accept anything less. We must run the full course.\n\nWe have at this meeting welcomed East Timor into the community of nations. We now look forward with eagerness to East Timor joining the UN family in the not too distant future.\n\n. . . . .\n\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\n\nSINGAPORE\n\n21 MAY 2002"
