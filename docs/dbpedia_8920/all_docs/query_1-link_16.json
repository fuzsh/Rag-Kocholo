The situation becomes worse when there are no lyrics that you can type in a search engine to narrow the results. So now what do you do? Well, for one, there’s Shazam, but what good is Shazam if the song was only played while the people around you were non-stop talking! Anyways, about two months ago while I was at work, one of my coworkers/ friends was working on her laptop testing out songs in order to sample them for her gaming project. I heard a familiar beat but evidently ignored it because the genre was new to me and it didn’t intrigue me at first. Luckily I was able to ask my friend for the artist’s name and was surprised that I never took the time to listen to their songs. For the assignment I decided to give it another chance and I honestly regret not having done it sooner.\n\nRatatat is an electronic-rock duo having had their start back in 2001 while they were still college students. While doing research on the duo, I was unaware that they’re from Brooklyn, New York! First off, I feel like I can compare this style of music to the discussion we had about psychedelic music. Playing any song makes it seem like you’re on something, but at the same time the tune is so catchy that you notice yourself going along with the beat. Something I usually ask myself is how artists come up with their titles. If you look up any of their albums since 2001, you’ll notice how their titles are completely random that you don’t even know if there is any context behind it or if they were on a deadline and B.S-ed the titles.\n\nI looked up Ratatat on my Spotify account and on the 10 popular songs list is a song called Drugs, which is listed at number 5.As the song starts you hear someone speaking, but I don’t know in what language, it could be gibberish, I’m not sure. It follows a slow tempo with a piano, violin, and cello and here I am thinking “ Okay, it seems mellow enough. I can listen to this for a bit as I type out my reaction.” and out of nowhere everything changes completely leaving those instruments behind and going full electric guitar and converting the entire song into an electric beat. This song came from their fourth album titled LP4. Their cover album is a white bird reflected on both sides, as if there was a mirror in the center of the album. I decided to look up if there was a music video because something I do when I hear music is picture if it can be choreographed. More so, what’s the potential story line? When I first heard the song, I pictured a couple sulking after having had a fight, pacing and uttering the words from the beginning of the song. Dance wise, I pictured them swaying because they don’t know where their relationship stands. As the beat changes, there’s a flash forward to how they live life separately, dancing freely, and enjoying being free because their relationship wasn’t progressing, it was just pulling them back. The song make you feel like you’ve taken a load of stress and emotion off your shoulders. When the song slows down again, I pictured a flashback of them pacing again and going back to a flash forward along with the tempo of the song. That’s what I envisioned if I were to expect something from their music video just by listening to the audio of the song.\n\nWatching the official music video left me without words because the video itself is a trippy roller-coaster. Let me guide you through the roller-coaster with my emotions in chronological order: Laughter, Cringe worthy, Confusion, Worried, More Confusion, Laughter and, lastly WTF! Honestly, why are these people posing?? Why are they smiling so wide and weird?? Are they on drugs like the song title? Is this how different people are while on drugs? What the fudgers is happening? Not quite sure if I can be explicit here, but that’s the recurring word that keeps popping up as I watched this video. What mostly entertained me were the comments below. Many mentioned they were high while watching the video and that the video was even more trippy then what we viewed on screen. Others gave explanations that the people in the video were reacting to being high. There’s so many ways to interpret it and ways to react, but I give credit to the music video director on taking the title and applying a literal description for viewers. Going back to the whole psychedelic factor, if you’re on some type of drug, then you’d surely experience one of the emotions reflected in this video. In a way, it reminded me of those medicinal commercials on t.v that try to convince you to buy their product. However, instead of telling us what the product is, they go right into showing the immediate side effects.\n\nI know it sounds as if I’m criticizing the duo, but their music is enticing enough to make me want more of it. Maybe that’s another interpretation of the song “Drugs”; it could be referring to their song being a drug and the audience wanting more of it because it’s a unique sound. They’re songs go well if I’m working on assignments, driving, or even lounging at home. I feel like this would’ve been something I’d have listened to back in high school when it was all about rock and punk bands, this would’ve definitely been in the mix. Furthermore, I’ve never heard anything like this before, but I intend to listen to more. So far I’ve gone through all 10 songs from the “popular list” and enjoyed them all, more so because they’re from different albums."
