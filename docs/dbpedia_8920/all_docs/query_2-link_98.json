I’ve been listening to these two dudes since I was in high school, and they were my introduction to the world of electronic music. I remember thinking that their sound was so different and unique, and still think that to this day. I have a huge amount of respect for these guys as musicians, because they command their instruments (including a pallet of guitars, synthesizers, and simple percussion instruments) with such a hypnotizing ease.\n\nBefore the show, there was a brief Q&A with the men behind Ratatat, Evan Mast and Mike Strouds, who have been making music for over a decade. They introduced their new album, Magnifique, in which they both contributed drawings of different icons for the cover. On developing their new song Prime Time, which is just two minutes long, they say, “We developed the song further but we didn’t like it.” These guys don’t feel pressured to meet any preconceived notions of what they should sound like; they just make music they like.\n\nThanks you Sonos Studio for having us. Getting to watch these guys in such an intimate setting was pretty magical!\n\nCreated by Gabriela Tena"
