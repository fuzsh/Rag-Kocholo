        "text": "'We don't really know these other bands that are emerging from Brooklyn. It's not like we all hang out together, so as far as we're concerned there is no scene.'\n\nWhether or not Stroud and partner Evan Mast, both 29, feel part of a scene, there certainly is one across the East River from Manhattan. Bands such as Mirror Mirror, Yeasayer and the most successful of all, Chairlift, have emerged in the past few years blazing a trail of post-rock electronica, folk and - in the case of Chairlift - what can only be described as neo-80s sound clash.\n\nMost of the bands are centred on the hip streets of Williamsburg, whose most lauded former residents were the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, arguably the best band to emerge from New York in the past 10 years.\n\nFor Stroud and Mast - whose sound sits somewhere between the precision of Battles and the eight-bit shriek of Crystal Castles - their music is their own. 'Our influences were people like Daft Punk, not anyone from our neighbourhood,' says Stroud over the phone from Brisbane, the latest stop on an Australian and New Zealand tour that has seen them play a number of festivals and headline gigs.\n\n'We're not really aware of other bands from Brooklyn - so we're not really influenced by them. To be honest, this whole scene thing is just a product of the media - it likes to give things a tag. New York is so big, there are so many bands that you cannot say there's this scene or that scene.'\n\nRatatat was formed after Stroud and Mast met at college. In 2001 they recorded their first tracks under the name Cherry and three years later released their debut album entitled Ratatat. The collection of sampled sounds and processed beats was recorded entirely on a laptop in Mast's apartment, a DIY technique the duo liken to the early cut-and-paste days of punk.\n\n'It was an easy and cheap way to record. We had the computer set up and a couple of keyboards and that's really all we needed,' says Stroud.\n\nAs the duo's reputation spread throughout New York, Ratatat gained the attention of labels and bands alike. In 2004, they signed to British imprint XL, home to garage rockers the White Stripes and the late, great Elliott Smith.\n\nSince then they have become one of the most highly regarded team of remixers in the US, reshaping songs by the likes of rappers Missy Elliott and Kanye West and British grime artist Dizzee Rascal. Such was the success of their remixes that Ratatat have released two albums of cut-up classics.\n\nLive, the band has supported the likes of Icelandic pop princess Bjork, Las Vegan 80s retro rockers the Killers, their heroes French duo Daft Punk and British rock acts Super Furry Animals and Franz Ferdinand.\n\nLast year, Stroud and Mast went into a professional studio for the first time to record their third album under the Ratatat moniker, LP3. 'We went to a studio in the country that had tonnes of these old instruments - things like a harpsichord and organs. It was something very new for us and we took advantage of it all,' Stroud says.\n\nWhile Ratatat maintained their playful beats-heavy sound for LP3, the availability of arcane instruments meant they could complement their usual electronic synthesisers with exotic sounds.\n\n'We always wanted to record that way, we just didn't have the instruments before,' says Stroud. 'We had always wanted to use a harpsichord, especially, so there's lots of that on the new album.'\n\nThe sea change in the music industry brought about by the technological revolution of the internet has forced bands big and small to rethink how they tour and promote themselves. With CD sales in decline as downloading becomes prevalent, bands are making most of their money these days from live shows.\n\n'That's always been where we got our money from - we never really make much from CD sales,' says Stroud.\n\n'It would be nice to get paid for the music that's downloaded but the internet has been helpful in other ways. Word-of-mouth recommendations are spread around the world much faster thanks to e-mail and whatever, and that means that we have followings in countries where we haven't released records.'\n\nOne of the biggest surprises in this regard was a gig in Turkey, where the band have no formal marketing deal. The gig was sold out to an audience that was obviously well aware of the band's songs.\n\nRatatat have also made inroads into a realm that bands would once have considered off limits as it would have implied they had 'sold out' - licensing their music for use in films and adverts. The duo's music can be heard on the soundtracks of recent movies including the Judd Apatow comedy Knocked Up, stylish horror flick Cloverfield and the offbeat Nick and Nora's Internet Playlist.\n\n'I'm not sure bands consider it selling out any more because the ways of making money from music have become more and more limited,' says Stroud. 'I do think that music people are not really into making money anyway; it's the music that matters.\n\n'But they do need to get by and licensing to movies or ads means your song is in the public conscience for longer than it would be if it was released as a single and stayed in the charts for just a month or so.'\n\nRatatat Live in Hong Kong, May 23, 9pm, May 24, 8pm, Grappa's Cellar, B/F Jardine House, 1 Connaught Place, Central.
