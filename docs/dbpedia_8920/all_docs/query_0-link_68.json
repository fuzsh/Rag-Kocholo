        "text": "Instrumental duo Ratatat are indie studio geeks with superproducer chops, just as comfortable reimagining Biggie Smalls joints (see 2006’s hip-hop-themed Remixes Vol. 2) as they are cranking out grooves that suggest a dreamier Daft Punk. Their first album in five years goes heavy on space-age synths, elegiac guitar cheese and chunky disco beats. There are also a couple of lovely slow tunes that deploy steel guitar, a new addition to their trick bag (“Supreme”). But as with every Ratatat record, Magnifique leaves you wondering what they could do if they fleshed these out into actual songs with real singers."
