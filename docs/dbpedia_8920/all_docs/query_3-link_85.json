        "text": "Next month, RATATAT, the duo of Evan Mast and Mike Stroud, will release their fifth studio album Magnifique on July 17 via Because. The 14-track album includes the recently released single “Cream On Chrome,” which the duo debuted during their closing, headline set at this year’s Coachella.\n\nRATATAT have already put out a video for “Intro” that you can watch BELOW and revealed new track “Abrasive”. In support of Magnifique, RATATAT have already hit the road running with sold-out underplay shows in April and confirmed festival appearances at Primavera Sound, Governor’s Ball, Capital Hill Block Party and HARD Summer.\n\nFollowing up on the experimental sounds of LP3 and LP4, RATATAT return to their core guitar-driven sound on Magnifique which was recorded over the course of four years in various studios in different locations including Jamaica (the country), upstate New York, Long Island, NY and their home studio in Brooklyn. The art for Magnifique includes a series of sketches drawn by Mast and Stroud during the recording sessions. What else can you expect on Magnifique: pedal steel guitar, the sound of a tiny 1940’s guitar amp found in a thrift store in Guadalajara used on “Intro,” a song named upon the discovery that the guys both had posters of a “ Countach” on their walls in junior high (the duo met in college), and a cover, their first ever, called “I Will Return” by Springwater (aka Phil Cordell)."
