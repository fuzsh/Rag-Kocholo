        "text": "With Brooklyn addresses, plaid shirts and a whole lot of hair, you could be fn for thinking Ratatat's Evan Mast and Mike Stroud are the latest outfit coming off New York's production line of hip. But – though regularly linked to Zeitgeisty sounds from global illage to chillwave – Ratatat have their own mission. Wordless (apart from a few choice film samples) since 2004, they want to get instrumentals to the top of the charts. \"It could happen,\" says Mast. If anyone has the potential to create another synthesizer moment or, indeed, wonders like The Mexican, Strings Of Life and, er, Robert Miles's Children, it's Ratatat. Gaining momentum since 2008's LP3, a period which saw them sell out shows at the NYC's 3,000-capacity Terminal 5, they're now on their fourth album. \"I'm always amazed to see the kids at our shows,\" says Stroud. \"There's waves of them bouncing up and down.\" They've also recently collaborated with rapper Kid Cudi, who found them on MySpace.\n\nIt's a long way from the duo's DIY beginnings. They met at Saratoga Springs' liberal arts school Skidmore College, where Mast was an art student and Stroud studied music. Ratatat started when they moved to New York. \"It wasn't like, 'Hey, let's join a band,'\" says Stroud. \"We just made a track one day that was like the baroque Thong Song.\" Inexplicably, going by that description, UK label XL came calling and they signed \"with four songs and no gigs\" to their name. Mixtapes of hip-hop tunes followed, and albums made by plugging guitars into a MacBook in Stroud's bedroom.\n\nRather than Diplo's floor-bouncing favela sound, theirs is a nerd's take on global illage, with Iranian classical drumming family Chemirani a current influence. As Mast puts it, \"We search out the unpopular things. You'd never hear Chemirani in a club.\" They even consciously reject any American influence. \"We never use jazz or blues references,\" says Mast. \"People often think we're French.\""
