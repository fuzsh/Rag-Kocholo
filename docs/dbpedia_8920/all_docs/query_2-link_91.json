        "text": "How does one come across bands? The most common way is through a friend. “Hey dude, check this shit out, it’s killer!”, etc. Other times, you come across bands completely by accident.\n\nI first heard of Ratatat while I was on vacation in Monterrey, Mexico several years ago. I bought their first album and after listening to it several times during my many journeys throughout the city, connected with it in a really big way. Maybe it was my foreign surroundings, maybe it was the head trauma from a car crash I was in halfway through the trip, but I really really liked that album. I was infatuated with the band’s sound and had remained quite fond of it for some time. Fast forward several years and albums and we arrive in the year 2010 where we don’t have flying cars but we do have a fourth Ratatat album. It’s called LP4. Funny, the last one was called LP3. Hrm.\n\nAnyway, the album is streaming on NPR here. Onward with the review!\n\n1. Bilar: Opens with some trumpets. At least, I think they’re trumpets. This is a good solemn intro. Kind of makes you wonder what’s to come. Quickly though, your question is answered with some synth/bass play with some coin jingling samples thrown in here and there. This isn’t as memorable as an intro should normally be. Acoustic guitar? Oh, ok. I see what you did there. Now the song’s got a beat going. Kind of tame if you ask me. The first two minutes of this sound like the prelude to some hip-hop opera film. It’s calmed down to a light cello piece now. Emotionally-driven drum cadence fades in and out while the little synth noises remain. The ratio of electronica to live instrumentation is about 4:10. German man speaking at the end leads into the next track.\n\n2. Drugs: I wonder why a german dialogue sample would lead into a song called “Drugs”. Maybe the gentleman speaking was talking about drugs? I don’t speak German so I wouldn’t be able to tell you. Piano playing, baby organ?, guitars, violins, cellos, distorted cellos–wait, what? Whoa. I could dance to this song. This is kind of what I would listen to if I were high and doing the robot in a Berlin alleyway on a torn cardboard box in front of mein freunde. The higher pitched guitar/keyboard parts kind of annoy me after a while. Good thing they take a break near the end. Interesting percussion elements on this song. The ‘doh’ sounding ‘vocal’ bits remind me of that crap that Bon Jovi’s guitarist sings on “It’s My Life”. (and it’s now or neevahh) Now the song’s got some echoed keyboards. Feels like the dance party’s traveling through the German subway. And faaaaa-a-a-a-d-e out.\n\n3. Neckbrace: “Hey we’re just getting ready to swing and knock me out with a baseball bat.” Sounds like an intro for a sketch on Jackass. Little more club techno beat on this one with little beeps and boops flying everywhere. Somebody’s gargling water? Hehe, the guitars sound like a dying lamb around 1:20 and on. Some guy going ‘dun-dun-dun-doon-doon-ding’. Oddly entrancing. His deep voice is the kind of raspy that is usually found in European thug voices in movies where Americans have troubles in Europe. Was someone just talking backwards? String arrangements are back. Great use of ..washboards? Mm. Some interestingly filtered vocals near the end. One of the things I find fascinating about Ratatat’s sound is their ability to have so many things going on in one song without it sounding overpowered or cluttered. They weave everything into the track in almost perfect timing. These little details give songs like these such saturation that it’s difficult to not want to listen to these tracks again and again just to find all these little nuances.\n\n4. We Can’t Be Stopped: Begins with some ambiguous piano playing. Don’t know if this song is friend or foe. Hm. Some far-off scrunchy noise. That or someone was unwrapping a candy really slowly while they were recording so they don’t make a lot of noise but end up making enough noise to get picked up by the mic. This short piano/flute-led piece makes me think of an empty ghost town with a really really beautiful well in the center of town that’s glowing. This track would be more memorable if it went somewhere. I can faintly hear people talking in the background in…French I think.\n\n5. Bob Ghandi: Meet Bob Ghandi, Mahandas Ghandi’s no-nonsense cousin who eats all the time. I’m going to let myself believe that the deep grunt at :48 is the sound of Bob Ghandi burping. I like the low-end background sound. It gives the song a pretty good atmosphere. However, it kind of drowns out the rest of the music if you pay it the slightest bit of attention. Mm, fun vibes kick in at 1:48. These guys definitely have a knack for composition. I wonder what they would be able to do with a film score. Okay, after about 2:30 the song kind of loses me. And it has me back at 3:04. Good job, Ratatat. I’m going to assume you made that part of the song super boring so that comeback bit seems like much more of a crescendo than anything. More weird talking in the background ending with some funny singing and laughing.\n\n6. Mandy: Said laughing automatically gives you a good vibe about this song. The synth-laden beat is easy to groove to. I’m kind of beginning to question Ratatat’s use of orchestral elements. Pairing the use of woodwinds with this type of electronica is a risky move on the band’s part because it makes this record an acquired taste. Of course, other people might praise their work as ‘innovative’ or maybe ‘fresh’ or something. It’s not that impressive. This song has moments where it could have really sharp hooks and ends up dulling them down. Filtered vocals at the end.\n\n7. Mahalo: Opens with ukelele. Fitting. Mahalo is a Hawaiian word and the Ukelele is a Hawaiian instrument. I see what you did there, Ratatat. Very clever. (kind of) The modern sounding strings sound like they’re coming from and old gramophone. Okay, there’s one thing that I’ve found a signature move of Ratatat’s and Ratatat’s alone: the soft slide down in pitch used as a turning point in songs. Hm. Not much else to say.\n\n8. Party With Children: A-ha! We’ve reached the track with the parakeet-friendly music video. Very percussive. Very latin. I like the synths on here. Mm such nice soft keyboards. Ooh, this song finally raises the adrenaline vibe with it’s ‘chorus’ section. Oh darnit, the energy’s short-lived. The song retreats back to it’s level habitat in Ratatat Land. Nothing out of the ordina–oh, wait, here’s something interesting. The chorus is back with some rising synth arpeggios. They give such a ‘fantastical’ vibe to this track. And again, although this time it just builds and then falls back to it’s normal energy level. Why can’t these guys just write a song that builds and buils and then proceeds to remain in that high adrenaline zone if not continuing upward until a listener’s left aurally spent?\n\n9. Sunblocks: I take it this is a summer song. It starts with crickets and some birds chirping. It sounds like a Ratatat parade is walking by in the distance. Oh wait, that’s my backyard. There’s the two dudes from Ratatat, a bunch of White Budgie Parakeets, and about 100 keytars being held by Ratatat fans surrounding a big thunder-driven drum machine. Light piano bits, thunder strikes again, in return the guitar solos. Calm, well-paced outro with harp-like synths. Back to the crickets and birds.\n\n10. Bare Feast: Is that a really annoying mosquito in my ears? Oh wait, it’s a…a…I want to say lute? Man, they really put out the stops with non-electronic elements. Okay this beat’s nice and minimalistic. Nice bombastic synth bits. Kind of remind me of their first record a little bit. I like how the guitar’s given a more helpful role in this song. Oh, now I get why they call this track ‘Bare Feast’. While it does dabble with very little elements itself and around simplistic compositions, it is plentiful in fascinating sounds. Some sounds aren’t even heard for more than 2 seconds in the album. Subtle work, boys.\n\n11. Grape Juice City: Again with a talking sample. It’s the southern woman from “Neckbrace”. She’s talking about beating people up in high school because they were either ‘too pretty’ or ‘smiled too much’. Okay some nice bongo drums start it off. Interesting beat under a neat little keyboard/saxophone/guitar. Not so many subtle elements here save for the occasional bird sound. Now I’m starting to notice some traces of funk in this song. Mainly with the beat. The little electronic arpeggios add little bits of flavor to the song. Ending with birds again. I wonder if they used all of the birds on the cover?\n\n12. Alps: Alright, soft piano intro. Pachelbel’s Canon in D? No, last note’s different. Hm. Synths coming in. Aaaand the beat’s here. It kind of just showed up not unlike Superman. I don’t feel like I’m scaling the Alps when I’m listening to this song. In fact, the weird vocal parts in the middle give me the vibe that there’s a really evil mountain lion waiting around the edge of this cliff so it can pounce and eat my face. Aw, cute moment utilizing the brass/string ensemble the guys have been putting to work on this record. At this point, the strings no longer seem like a peripheral element but a compliment to the synths which zoom in and out now as we bring the record to a close. A bit of a formal ending here on this track. Kind of like the last scene in A New Hope where the good guys get the medals at the awards ceremony. Except instead of wiping to the credits quickly, this song fades out.\n\nOkay. I’m not the biggest fan of electronic music but I am well aware of what this band is capable of and while I don’t believe that entitles me to be able to claim that I know what they are likely to do, I want to say that this album wasn’t very surprising. Ratatat is giving us a batch of new tunes with a slight spin to them. Kind of like buying a parakeet at a pet store but not being able to afford the fancy cage the store has so you buy one ‘on the cheap’ from some dude on Craigslist and it comes furnished with a layer of smelly, dried up poop on newspaper at the bottom. Please note, I’m not calling this record ‘poop’ or referring to it as poop on newspaper at the bottom of a used cage you bought on Craigslist. However, this record is not a new cage by any means.\n\n5/10\n\nLP4 is out June 8th on XL Recordings"
