        "text": "New York duo Ratatat reportedly settled on their name after guitarist Mike Stroud had an acid trip hallucination in which he saw tap-dancing rats.\n\nActually, it never happened.\n\n\"My dad told me about that,\" Stroud says of the story. \"I was like, 'Oh, that's interesting, I didn't know that.'\"\n\nRatatat's mash of hip-hop beats, DIY production, squally guitar riffs and synthesiser hooks isn't easily categorised. It references everything from rock and electro to film soundtracks and Sgt. Pepper's-era Beatles. Regardless of how Ratatat's music is described, it's often associated with hip-hop.\n\n\"I can see why people who are into hip-hop like us,\" admits Stroud. But he draws the line at calling Ratatat a hip-hop act. With \"no plan at all\", Stroud says he and songwriting partner Evan Mast simply \"started fooling around [and] making songs just for fun\".\n\nSo far the impulsive partnership has paid off. The rudimentary laptop set-up of their initial home recordings has now been swapped for \"a proper studio with tonnes of instruments and good microphones\".\n\nThey even get to spend weeks recording in Bjork's country house. That may be because Stroud's girlfriend does Bjork's make-up. Yet positive reviews and at least one fortuitous placement of their music in a television car campaign suggests Ratatat's upward trajectory is fuelled by more than good connections.\n\nWas Stroud happy that Hummer, the gas-guzzling road weapon that is also a popular brand for the US military in Iraq, used their song?\n\n\"Yeah, for sure. It was good pay, so I'm with that,\" he says deadpan. \"We have fans complaining, 'You guys are selling out!' I don't give a shit about that.\"\n\nBack to something Stroud does care about: animals.\n\nRatatat's latest LP, 2006's foxily named Classics, features noisy bugs and birds as well as roaring wild cats. As if sampling fauna is the most obvious choice available to a band, Stroud answers a bone-dry \"yeah\" to a query on the practice. \"We try and put a lot of animal sounds in our music,\" he adds.\n\nWhy? \"I don't know. They make some crazy sounds.\"\n\nSince Ratatat are heading to Australia, what does he make of kookaburras, surely the craziest-sounding creature around? Stroud is stumped but, after a quick explanation of the birds' crazy cackling antics, he admits they sound \"pretty cool\".\n\nWill he record some kookaburras while on tour? \"I don't think that's in the plan,\" Stroud says. \"There are all these stories about [our song Wildcat] that we went into the woods ...\"\n\nUh-oh. As with the acid trip, we've hit on another erroneous Ratatat rumour. \"We weren't like, you know, hanging out with jaguars.\"\n\nFor safety reasons, some of the animal sounds simply came from the internet.\n\nStill, Ratatat aren't complete wusses: \"[My budgie] made it on to some of our new songs.\""
