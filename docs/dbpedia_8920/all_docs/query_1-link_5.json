        "text": "did they break up?\n\nJudging by wikipedia, they‚Äôre still active. I seem to have all five of their albums as they haven‚Äôt made a new one after Magnifique which came out in 2015.\n\nI managed to catch them live once in Debaser Stockholm around their second album and remember being a bit bummed that there was a whole four piece band on the stage. I was fully expecting to see only two guys (one with bass, one with electric guitar) and a drum machine.\n\nThey played in Brighton one time and my mate‚Äôs band supported them. He ended up with one of their multi plugs (mix up in the de-rig, he told me). Anyway, said mate borrowed and lost one of my multi plugs and gave me Ratatat‚Äôs as a replacement. It‚Äôs fully operational still and under the desk right now. So I think of them every time I have cause to rationalise my power arrangements.\n\nI doubt the loss of the multi plug contributed to their demise. But you never know. If you‚Äôre reading this, fellas, let me know an address and I‚Äôll pop it in the post for you.\n\nCheers,\n\nJim\n\nSomeone let them in‚Ä¶\n\nI saw them at a festival once, it was so cool to hear those riffs live. I recall them being a 4 piece as well, but it was still cool.\n\nI remember seeing them at Fusion Festival when their imho best album was released (Classics? Sounds like a compilation‚Ä¶? Confused‚Ä¶) ‚Äì crazy sick visuals to awesome music! Glad I‚Äôve been able to watch them (always tough to time things in a festival situation with so many influences ü•∏)\n\nyeah that is kind of a bummer. but I get it too. probably we‚Äôre in the minority of people who want to see them that way. and likely a lot of what they‚Äôd be doing would be triggering loops, in order to recreate the songs fully. which isn‚Äôt nearly as engaging for the general audience as seeing a full band.\n\nanyway, I also wonder what happened to them.\n\nAs if by magic, they shared this earlier:\n\nLooks like one of them is still making music at least.\n\nThey went to shit pretty quick. That hip hop remix ep was fun, the first album was a bit boring and after that everything they made was incredibly forgettable. Classic example of a band who had one good idea but no staying power.\n\nYou should start writing for the Rolling Stone. But tbh I only liked the album Classics. At least they knew it themselves.\n\nactually, it looks like they‚Äôve been providing @Jimbrackpool with power for years!\n\nahhh so they‚Äôve doing a lot of synch music then?\n\nY‚Äôall have summoned one of them\n\njust wanted to let you know! Yes!! Old spirit is back!\n\nI‚Äôve seen them six or seven times and have never seen more than two people. Maybe it was only for their Europe tour. I wish they would tour again.\n\nSaw them years ago. Amazing show. Just the two. One of them killed a bottle of Jameson and threw up all over the front of the venue with all the bouncers surrounding him. Amazing. The opening act had a line about eating donuts with the grownups and it lives rent free in me and my friends heads.\n\nep? it‚Äôs two full albums. two GLORIOUS full albums. 28 tracks.\n\nthis track‚Äôs my favorite:\n\nI was doing music journalism stuff when they started so was a fan early on and saw them a few times. Once when I went to see them play a smallish venue in London in 2004 I said something to one of them about why it‚Äôs strange they were the support act as I thought they were huge as I‚Äôd seen them in all sorts of press (I think Noisettes headlined). And he said (I think arm and arm with two women):\n\n‚Äúyou‚Äôre more famous than we are‚Äù\n\nwhich stuck with me as somehow beautifully hip hop, punk rock and anti-folk at the same time so all my favourite genres, and is somehow one of my favourite artist encounters."
