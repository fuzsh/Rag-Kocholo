One thing they know for sure is their fascination with the hip-hop scene will continue.\n\nIn the past, the two have worked with the likes of Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Missy Eliiot, and more and even released a hip-hop mixtape in 2007, but their focus has now turned to the next generation of artists coming up. Two in particular they wish to work with are Travis Scott and Young Thug, the two revealed in an interview with Bandwagon:\n\n‚ÄúWe would definitely like to work with Travis $cott and Young Thug,‚Äù says Stroud, who caught the latter on TV before the interview. ‚ÄúI think they look different than rappers usually do. They look more punk rock than rappers ever have.‚Äù\n\nJust the thought of those potential collaborations have me feeling giddy, let‚Äôs hope Travis Scott and Thugger see this üôÇ Peep some of RATATAT‚Äôs past hip-hop collaborations below.\n\nSTAY IN THE KNOW!
