        "text": "With a high profile remix (Bjork), opening slots on Daft Punk’s recent U.S. tour and their own recent exploits at the Essential Music Festival to Australian audiences, Ratatat are riding a wave of recognition and are now using that to launch their 3rd album, creatively titled LP3. That list of associates should give a starting indication to what this album might sound like, though it’s definitely a Ratatat record.\n\nThings can sometimes be a little baroque – the album opens with the inclusion of a harp flourish in the mellow ‘Shiller’ and ‘Mi Viejo’ features harpsichord and subcontinental percussion. Final track ‘Black Heroes’ includes what sounds like a mellotron to my ears. These moments were accommodated by the band recording at Old Scout studio in the small-town Catskill. The studio’s main feature is it’s extensive collection of keyboard instruments – the harp and harpsichord included – as opposed to a mountain of hi-tech digital recording gear. The duo have gone to town with the tools at hand.\n\nThere is an undoubted electronic pulse to the bottom end, dubbed out on tracks like ‘Mirando’ and ‘Imperials’ or straighter and more driving on ‘Falcon Jab’ and ‘Shempi’. And in spite of the experiments with instrumentation, there’s a highly consistent sonic aesthetic across the tracks. Interest is held by the wide range of rhythmic invention, with no two consecutive tracks settling into paint-by-numbers beats. In the absence of lyrics and vocal melodies, it’s often actually the beats which take lead status, climaxing with the stutter of ‘Mumtaz Khan’.\n\nThe album’s Achilles heel – and it’s a big one in my opinion, though based fairly clearly on personal taste – is THAT guitar sound. It’s probably Ratatat’s most significant defining feature. It’s highly processed and can verge on sounding like keyboards. But it’s the smoothness and guitar harmonies which really bother me. All I can think of when I hear them is the lead break from Hotel California, and that, for me, is musical hell! But, some of my best friends like smooth 70s west coast rock, so there’s a chance I could be in the minority who find it annoying.\n\nHaving said that, as the bio points out, the duo has created a much more keyboard driven album here, and those guitars aren’t quite ubiquitous so, with their inclusion spaced out over LP3, I was still able to enjoy the album by screwing up my face in the offending places.\n\nAdrian Elmer"
