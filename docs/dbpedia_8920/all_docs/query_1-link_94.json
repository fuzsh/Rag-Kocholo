        "text": "Photo by Tim Drummond\n\nAs published by LA Record:\n\nHaving seen New York’s rock-driven electronic powerhouse Ratatat seven times (and counting), I’ve come to expect nothing short of greatness from guitarist Mike Stroud and bassist/synthman Evan Mast. No surprises at this show; the duo delivered their usual rock solid, booty-grinding performance. The Palladium, having recently undergone yet another renovation, is becoming an increasingly annoying venue (bag checks and full-body pat downs, seriously?). Regular concertgoers and press alike were subject to impolite security restricting floor access even to those of us with appropriate wristbands. But if you’re not averse to chatting up heavyset men in yellow jackets, you’ll end up having a good time in front of the stage. Before Ratatat delivered their highly anticipated set, the crowd suffered through the ridiculous white-boy rapping of Despot (“I eat donuts with grown-ups”… wha?) and was growing increasingly impatient during Tussle’s tepid not-so-experimental electronic set, the end of which was droned out by ravenous chants of “RATATAT! RATATAT!” from die-hards on the floor.\n\nGracing the stage a full half-hour late, the duo proved worth the wait. They started strong with the bombastic “Shiller” off their latest album, LP3, and never let up. The audience was almost as interesting as the show itself—mistaking the Palladium for Coachella Valley, a mysterious dude with an endless supply of water bottles wandered through the crowd squirting liquid into the gaping mouths of people apparently unconcerned with what else might be contained within the free water. Ratatat delivered favorites like “Crips” and “Loud Pipes” from their 2004 self-titled debut, “Wildcat” and “Lex” from their sophomore release Classics, and “Mirando” and “Shempi” from their latest. The set was full of material old and new—“full” being the operative word. My feet were shrieking bloody murder by the end of the looooong hour-and-a-half set, and by the time “17 Years” exploded from the stage, I was ecstatic—not only because it’s my fave Ratatat tune, but because it always signals the end of the show.\n\nAs published by LA Record:\n\nSouthern flavored ’70s-style rock was the order of the evening when the Raconteurs played the Greek last Monday, the first of their pair of shows at the outdoor hilltop venue. Sitting underneath the stars on the first autumn night of the year with gritty, rootsy blues rock wafting through the air, it felt like we’d been transported to the band’s home base of Nashville — all that was missing was a bonfire. (Though probably not the best idea in the tinder town that is Griffith Park.) Jack White, the undeniable star of the band, has a stage presence so big it’s amazing anyone else can share the same space. Fellow axeman Brendan Benson’s reserved nature served as a perfect complement to White’s blistering guitar, which didn’t spend too much time apart from the pitch shifter and “talking guitar” distortion pedals. The band’s other half — bass- and banjo-wielding Jack Lawrence and drummer Patrick Keeler, both members of garage revivalists the Greenhornes — held their own along with newcomer Mark Watrous taking over on keys and fiddle as member number five on this tour. The band was tight and the sound was perfect — kept at an ear-friendly 95 decibels by decree of the Greek — and though many of the tunes off the band’s latest release Consolers of the Lonely sound pretty much the same, that sameness was well enjoyed when infused with the energy of a live performance. When introducing “Steady, As She Goes,” White jested that the song “was a big hit for us in 1974.” If I hadn’t known better, I wouldn’t have got the joke. The band would be right at home amidst the many blues-tinged rock groups splashed on the cover of Rolling Stone that year.\n\n—Linda Rapka\n\nAs published by LA RECORD:\n\n“Bodies in motion” can best describe the packed house as New York’s energetic electronic/synth instrumental powerhouse Ratatat took over the stage on night two of their double-play at the Henry Fonda. Guitarist Mike Stroud and bassist/synthman Evan Mast have amassed a formidable following over the past few years by driving massive guitar riffs and fuzzy bass lines over synth-based, tape-looped beats. Incrementally adding band members to each tour, an all-time high of four musicians shared the stage, with additional bodies appearing behind drums and extra synths. Once again the lineup included human perpetual motion machine Jacob Morris, whose upper extremities (massive-fro topped head included) have been flailing about with wild intensity throughout entire Ratatat sets the past several tours. The extra manpower on stage added a valuable element to the duo’s already amazing live shows, which only show to profit from the use of real instruments over pre-recorded sounds. The energy of the four musicians seemed to rub off on the crowd, which jumped up and down in a collective human blob up until the very last note, expelling the occasional unified outburst when familiar songs from previous albums such as “Wildcat,” “Lex” and “Loud Pipes” were played. The visual portion of the show included background projections of the music videos for each track, featuring new ones off the band’s fifth, more dance-oriented release (third album proper not counting Ratatat’s two hip-hop remix albums), “LP3.” Notable new videos included “Miranda,” mixing scenes from a hackneyed Schwarzenegger flick with visuals of people catching on fire and exploding and flying hundreds of feet into the air all in perfect synch with the music, and “Flynn” showing the ridiculous Paul Simon 1986 music video “You Can Call Me Al” featuring none other than Chevy Chase.\n\n-Linda Rapka\n\nEric Idle Still a Very Naughty Boy\n\nMonty Python legend teams up again with John Du Prez\n\nfor first-ever comic oratorio ‘Not the Messiah’\n\nby Linda Rapka, Overture Managing Editor\n\nFor something indeed completely different, Monty Python star Eric Idle and longtime collaborator John Du Prez presented the first-ever comic oratorio, “Not the Messiah (He’s a Very Naughty Boy),” which made its West Coast premiere at the Hollywood Bowl Aug. 1 and Aug. 2.\n\nMaking an unlikely pair of Handel’s holy oratorio “Messiah” and ’70s cult Python film “Life of Brian,” the satire on classic oratorio form features Idle as narrator and self-proclaimed “bariton-ish” vocalist joined onstage by Du Prez and soprano Shannon Mercer, mezzo-soprano Jean Stilwell, tenor William Ferguson and baritone Theodore Baerg, as well as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Pacific Chorale, Los Angeles Scots Pipe Band – along with the occasional singing sheep, kilted bagpiper and keyboard-operated leaf blower.\n\nIdle and Du Prez began their collaboration 30 years ago with “Life of Brian.” In the wake of the success of the hit musical “Spamalot,” the pair comes full circle with their new madcap musical satire, which premiered in 2007 and has since traveled the globe.\n\n“Not the Messiah” revives the story of Brian Cohen, a Jewish boy born a few mangers down from Jesus who is mistaken for the Messiah. The original spoof of the New Testament caused an uproar when it was released for its lampooning of organized religion. “Not the Messiah” adds another layer with a jab against the current U.S. administration: this time around Brian joins not the anti-Roman People’s Front of Judea, but a mob of ancient power-seeking Republicans.\n\nThe score consists mainly of new material composed by Du Prez, though there were no shortage of Python references. The show commenced with Sousa’s “The Liberty Bell (the familiar theme to “Monty Python’s Flying Circus”), gave a wink wink, nudge nudge to the classic “Lumberjack Song” and nodded to a line in the team’s first film “The Meaning of Life” with the tune “O God You are So Big,” ending appropriately with a fireworks and bagpipes singalong to “Life of Brian’s” unforgettable closing number sung by Idle as he lay hanging upon a crucifix, “Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.”\n\nThe rest of the score is a formidable pastiche of practically every musical genre under the sun: doo-wop, gospel, Baroque, pop, country and western, Broadway, Welsh hymns, hip hop, Greek chorus and mariachi, with Idle consistently throwing surprising tidbits into the mix. “Hail to the Shoe!”, a spoof of Handel’s “Hallelujah,” has Idle beatboxing like a rap star, and “Individuals” takes an unexpected turn when he appears onstage in full-on Bob Dylan regalia replete with acoustic guitar, harmonica, and indiscernible mumbled speech.\n\nWith Brian and Judith’s duet simulating an orgasm gone Baroque and the revealing of Brian’s mum’s not-so-chaste past, “Not the Messiah” proves at times to be a bit naughty. And while some of the pop culture references seem outdated and irrelevant, the timely allegorical warning against the unrestrained tyranny of a Republican-run government during one of the most heated Presidential campaigns in U.S. history makes up for it.\n\nThe jumbling of religion, politics and sex with comedy in “Not the Messiah” covers all the bases of contentious subject matter in a sure attempt by Idle to get the sparks of controversy flying, as so often happened in his Python days – proving he’s still quite a very naughty boy himself.\n\nOriginally published by Professional Musicians, Local 47 Overture, September 2008 (download PDF).\n\nAs published by LA Record:\n\nWhen I heard that Robyn Hitchcock was coming back to town as co-headliner with Nick Lowe at the El Rey, the first thing I did was cash in on my fabulous L.A. RECORD connections to score tickets. The second thing I did was miss his entire set. I arrived at 10 pm, which on a Friday night by L.A. standards is pretty damn prompt, to find that not only had Robyn come and gone, but I’d already even missed Nick Lowe’s first couple of tunes. Not being all that familiar with Lowe’s stuff – except of course for his standards “Cruel to Be Kind” and “(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding” – I disappointedly resigned myself to sit through his set and try to enjoy myself. After listening to him play a couple of tunes of just him and acoustic guitar, I was sure that was not going to happen. But as the evening wore on, I found myself increasingly entranced by the 50-something Englishman’s simple yet heartfelt melodies and story-like lyrics of life and love. Though sponsored by Indie 103, it felt like more of a KCRW crowd, the audience comprising faux-hipsters in their late twenties who allowed their parents to tag along, all singing to every song, completely enamored with Lowe. The highlight for me was the encore, when both Lowe and Hitchcock took the stage together and performed a number of surprising old covers, including the little-known 1963 tune “Hungry For Love” by Johnny Kidd & the Pirates, “Peggy Sue” by Buddy Holly and the Beatles’ “If I Fell.” (LL)\n\nAs published in L.A. Record:\n\nAn astrologer told L.A. RECORD’s Phil Hoelting that he shouldn’t be a writer—instead, he should focus on producing events. Phil, though you know I love your brilliant words, I must say that your astrologer is on to something. Phil organized the first-ever L.A. RECORD Player night at Charlie O’s, and the event—taking place on the bottom floor of downtown’s historic, haunted Alexandria Hotel, featuring a killer line-up of Long Beach’s finest, and, importantly, offering $2 PBRs all night long (of which I was a most willing partaker)–could not have been more awesome. I arrived a little late, unfortunately missing Blank Blue (Nobody and Niki Randa and drummer Andreas). But sweet Jesus—Crystal Antlers more than made up for my tardiness. It’s pretty much useless to try to sum up their genius in words, as they are an act that MUST be experienced live, but here goes: possessed with an inexplicable energy at once manic and controlled, the band’s hypercharged garage-y soul blends insanity with melody in a way only an ensemble comprised of two keyboardists (one of which was Mars Volta’s Ikey Owens) and two drummers could…and they’re quite possibly the only band who could get me to venture outside of my Silver Lake/Echo Park/Hollywood bubble to catch a show way out in Long Beach. Closing out the evening were Free Moral Agents, also featuring Owens, who threw it down hard with droney trip/hip hop-laden funky soul-filled soundscapes. I don’t recall much after this, as I meandered a few blocks down to the now-closed speakeasy that’s doomed to become the future site of a gas station or parking garage. But this much I know: the night was nothing but good times. (LL)\n\nAs published in L.A. Record:\n\nArriving at the sold-out Subhumans show last night already donning no fewer than 20 bruises on my person before the show even began (Labor Day weekend in Havasu, need I say more?), I figured not much more harm could be done and positioned myself in the pit. The band originally formed in England in 1980 and sounded as tight and angst-ridden as ever, confirming their status in the upper echelon of punk. The setlist was mainly culled from the band’s early archive with favorites like “I Don’t Wanna Die,” “Drugs of Youth,” “Peroxide,” “Mickey Mouse is Dead” and “Subvert City” with singer Dick Lucas offering mini tirades in his nearly unintelligible cockney accent between songs, mostly deriding the superficiality and laziness so prevalent in our fair city. My personal highlights from the show were “Rats” off the EP of same name and “I Don’t Wanna Die” from their full-length 1982 debut, a song which has always sounded best live. Though the songs were recorded before most of the all-ages audience was born, a majority of the pierced and spiky heads knew every single word, proving that kids today really are capable of appreciating good shit. They closed out their set with the powerful “Religious Wars,” inciting ridiculously stupid crowd dives off the balcony and intensifying the vigorousness of the pit slamming to its pique. Amazingly, and somewhat perplexingly, I went home with only as many bruises as I arrived with. (LL)\n\nAs published in L.A. Record:\n\nLocal duo No Age is what the early Velvet Underground would’ve sounded like if Lou Reed were a happy punker (just try and listen to the rhythm of “Everybody’s Down” and not think of VU). Guitarist Randy Randall and singer/drummer Dean Spunt blast LOUD, raw, enthusiastic, experimental punk rockage fused with melodic pop, using fuzzed-out guitars over incessantly pounding drums with layer upon layer of cymbal crashes and feedback loops and angst-ridden lyrical mantras like “Well, I hate you/ I hate you/my life’s alright without you” and “Everybody’s down/every soul in every town/everybody’s got me going oooh-ahhh ooh-ahh ooh-ahh oooh,” and yes, I realize this is a run-on sentence, but it pretty much sums up the intense whirlwind feel of a No Age show. Though the Troubadour crowd is notorious for exploring how motionless it can be at any given time, expect to see manic crowd surfing at any other venue No Age plays. As for the evening’s openers: I completely missed the Mae Shi (sorry guys) and Moris Tepper, whom I try to see at every opportunity, was amazingly kick-ass as expected, though I missed (damnit!) all but the three last songs.\n\nAs published in L.A. Record:\n\nAt the sunshine-pop end of the psychedelic spectrum, ’60s legends Strawberry Alarm Clock played in the cozy backroom of the Pig ‘n Whistle in Hollywood at the Mods & Rockers closing-night party presented by the American Cinematheque. The band originally formed in Glendale in 1967, landing a chart-topping hit with the charmingly upbeat “Incense & Peppermints” and going through more line-up changes than any other band in history before calling it quits four years later. Though various members briefly reunited and toured in the ’80s, the lineup this eve included five original members with the addition of one new guitar player. Not phased by the venue’s obligatory technical sound problems, the band proved that they were no mere one-hit wonders, kicking things off the right way with “Tomorrow,” followed by rockin’ renditions of “Paxton’s Back Street Carnival,” “Sit With The Guru” and, of course, “Incense & Peppermints.” Their gear was as impressive as their performance: George Bunnell’s 1962 pre-CBS Fender Precision bass immediately caught my eye, which incidentally he later mentioned was purchased as a throwaway from John Entwistle’s bass collection for a paltry $400 in the ’70s. I must also mention that I really fucking love this town. Only in Hollywood would I bump into some long-lost buttrocker friends strung out on speedballs in a room full of aging hippies listening to a live performance of “Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow”…\n\nThe Pity Party\n\nEskimohunter\n\nAs published in L.A. Record:\n\nI have what some might describe as an unhealthy obsession with local duo The Pity Party, so when I heard they would be playing one of my favorite venues on my birthday, there was no question where I’d be celebrating my turning a quarter of a century old. After trying for a ridiculous 45 minutes to close out our tab at Red Lion, we rushed over to Spaceland only to be met with an ENORMOUSLY long line at the valet. I had to check my palm pilot to make sure it was indeed a Monday night – I hadn’t seen a line that long since a Cold War Kids show a few months back. Since it was my birthday, I felt it gave me leeway to hop out of the car and leave my friends to deal with the parking madness while I ran in to enjoy the sounds of The Pity Party. Though I’ve seen them probably a dozen times, every single one of their performances still leaves me gaping in awe at their utter amazingness. Drumkit front and center, the lovely Heisenflei pulls triple-duty, playing drums and keys while managing the lead vocals, at some points even taking on percussion duties using a maraca as a drumstick. Alongside her, Maurice-Robert busts out gritty guitar riffs while providing supporting harmonies. Their experimental and refreshingly unique sound evocatively blends the artsy rawness of Nico-era Velvet Underground with surprisingly loud intensity for a two piece. I’m really glad that others are catching on– when they drove into “Dronebots and Peons for Eons and Eons” (my favorite track off their self-titled EP), half the crowd sang along with them. Too awesome. Up next was Eskimohunter, whose heavy fuzzy hooks, shoegazey organs, catchy melodies and amazing stage lighting were the perfect way to mellow out an increasingly intoxicated birthday girl."
