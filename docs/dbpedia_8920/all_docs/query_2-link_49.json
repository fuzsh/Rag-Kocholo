The rest of the world can hear the studio version through a low-key music video showcasing an interactive light installation. The instrumental track is classic Ratatat; with melodic electric guitar lines and punchy dance beats, and channels some world music influences as it unfolds. Ratatat’s new album will drop this summer through XL Recordings—until then, catch them on tour from Barcelona’s Primavera Sound to Governor’s Ball in NYC."
