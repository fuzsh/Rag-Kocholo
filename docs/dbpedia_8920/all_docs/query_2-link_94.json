        "text": "When someone says Hot Chip, you most likely think “electronic dance music.” And when someone says Brian Eno you probably think “ambient music” — that or the Windows 95 startup sound which Eno famously created. But ‘Line In The Sand’ sounds like neither. It sounds like Beatles-influenced art pop, something I had never heard from Hot Chip or Eno. So I went digging in Eno’s catalogue and discovered his 1975 album, Another Green World — and there was the art pop influence. I then noticed this lyric from ‘Line In The Sand’ sung by Hot Chip’s Alexis Taylor, “another green world back into clay.”\n\nI felt lucky to have discovered the song’s influence as well as an unfamiliar but intriguing Brian Eno album. But I was about to get luckier. Another Green World features some of Eno’s earliest instrumental compositions that he would later call Ambient. I was casually enjoying the album, especially collaborator Robert Fripp’s fierce guitar playing, and then I heard a track that made me pause — ‘The Big Ship.’\n\nListening to ‘The Big Ship’ is like having someone wrap you in a warm blanket. It’s how joy feels beyond mere happiness, how unconditional love feels when all fear has vanished. As I listened to it for the first time, I remembered another instrumental song that made me feel the same way — ‘Cherry’ by Ratatat. You could say ‘Cherry’ is a modern-day version of ‘The Big Ship.’ They use synthesizers and droning guitars to build a feeling of ecstasy that gradually fades into the light. They both reveal eternity, just long enough to convince you it’s real."
