If you haven't listened to them you should look em up on youtube and listen to any of their songs.\n\nEl Ten Eleven, Explosions in the sky, ...Of Sinking Ships, Boards of Canada, Tatatar... which is just their songs backwards IDK their such a versitile and unique band, it's hard ti find stuff similar, I would suggest looking up post-rock stuff though.\n\n[ame=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7WUV0QJR-g&feature=mh_lolz&list=LLdTA920gRrtw]YouTube - ‪Ratatat - Cherry (backwards)‬‏[/ame]\n\n[ame=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Gk0CNxtO3o&feature=related]YouTube - ‪RATATAT - MIRANDO [BACKWARD]‬‏[/ame]\n\nRatatat was one of the first instrumental bands that I got into, and like others said you should definitely check out post rock bands. There's some post rock bands that make Ratatat look like poo.\n\nSomeone said Explosions in the Sky up there, and they're a good band to start with. 65daysofstatic is somewhat similar to Ratatat with electronic/rock instrumentals. You'd probably like them. I'm listening to Modest Mouse right now and I agree they have the same feel to their music. But they don't sound similar. Mogwai is another good postrock band you might want to check out. Mono is a japanese band that is a little more orchestral than you might like, but still worth checking out."
