The Subcommittees met, pursuant to notice, at 10:18 a.m., in Room 2141, Rayburn House Office Building, the Honorable Jerrold Nadler (Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties) presiding. Present: Representatives Nadler, Conyers, Scott, Jackson Lee, Waters, Cohen, Davis, Ellison, Sensenbrenner, Coble, Chabot, Lungren, Franks, and Gohmert. Staff Present: David Lachman, Chief of Staff; Keenan Keller, Majority Counsel; Susana Gutierrez, Professional Staff Member, Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties; Bobby Vassar, Chief Counsel, Rachel King, Majority Counsel; and Veronica Eligan, Professional Staff Member, Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security. Mr. Nadler. Good morning. This hearing of the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, and the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security will come to order. I should say this joint hearing will come to order. Today's hearing will review legislation introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Lewis, designed to address unsolved crimes from the civil rights era. The Chair now recognizes himself for an opening statement. Today, the Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties and the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security jointly consider H.R. 923, the ``Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act,'' introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Lewis. [The bill, H.R. 923, follows:] [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Nadler. Our Nation's history is regrettably replete with acts of violence committed with impunity against African Americans generally and civil rights workers in particular. In many cases, these crimes are committed as acts of political terror designed to prevent African Americans from enjoying the same rights as other Americans: the right to vote, the right to travel, the right to walk into a restaurant or a theater, even the right to walk down the street unmolested. For nearly a century, this Congress sat on its hands and refused to act. Anti-lynching bills were regularly buried. Civil rights bills were considered beyond the pale. Law enforcement looked the other way or was actually complicit in these acts of terrorism. And the all-White courts never convicted clearly guilty perpetrators of assaults and murders. As a Nation, we have moved forward. We enacted civil rights laws, including criminal statutes that would punish civil rights crimes. We moved beyond the culture of impunity that protected these criminals. We have moved forward, but we have not adequately addressed the past. Today, we will take an important step in doing just that by giving law enforcement the tools it needs to redress old wrongs. H.R. 923 is designed to expand the prosecution of unsolved civil rights crimes. The amendment in the nature of a substitute I will offer would authorize $11.5 million annually to the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Section of the Department of Justice, the Civil Rights Section of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Community Relations Department of FBI. The bill would designate specific administrative authority for the investigation and prosecution of unsolved civil-rights- era crimes and require an annual accounting to Congress on the progress of the investigative initiatives and provide grants to States to take on the task of bringing the criminals to justice and cleansing our society of this great stain. I want to welcome our witnesses, and I look forward to their testimony. I would now recognize our distinguished Ranking minority Member, the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Franks, for his opening statement. Mr. Franks. I want to thank you, Chairman Nadler and Chairman Scott, for holding this joint legislative hearing on H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. This is critically important legislation that provides additional funds for the investigation and prosecution of unsolved civil-rights-era murders. Emmett Till was only 14 years old in 1955 when he was kidnapped and brutally murdered while visiting family outside the small town of Money, Mississippi. Two men kidnapped Emmett from his great-uncle's home, beat him and then drove him to Tallahatchie, the river, where they shot him. They tied a gin fan around his neck with barbed wire and dumped his body into the river. All of this because Emmett spoke to Carolyn Bryant, a White woman, at the town grocery store. The defendants, Bryant's husband and his half brother, were brought to trial just 4 weeks after Emmett's murder and were acquitted. The jury found that the prosecution failed to prove that the body recovered from the river was in fact Emmett Till. Although the defendants later confessed to the murder, it was too little, too late for Emmett Till and his family. In 2004, with the assistance of the Department of Justice, local officials in Mississippi renewed the investigation into Emmett's murder. Unfortunately, by this time the defendants had died. Emmett's story is not unique. Many civil-rights-era murders remain unsolved. The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice in recent years has renewed its dedication to investigating these cases. To assist the Department in its efforts, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act authorized additional funds for the investigation and prosecution of unsolved civil-rights-era murders. The bill also directs the Civil Rights Division to report to Congress annually on the number of open cases and ongoing investigations, the number of prosecutions and closed cases and the number of attorneys working on these cases. I want to commend Mr. Lewis of Georgia, the co-sponsor and the sponsor of this bill for the dedication that he has shown on this issue. I want to extend a special welcome to Ms. Rita Schwerner Bender, widow of slain Civil Rights activist Michael Schwerner; and Ms. Myrlie Evers-Williams, widow of Civil Rights activist Medgar Evers. God bless you both, and I look forward to hearing from you and our other witnesses here today. Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I would now recognize the distinguished Chairman of the full Committee, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Conyers, for his opening statement. Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning, distinguished witnesses. This is an important continuation of the most exciting, tumultuous, unbelievable part of American history in the 20th century. Right in this room and because of what we are doing, that history now comes back alive for the first time. We have two Subcommittees, and I commend Subcommittee Chairman Nadler, Subcommittee Chairman Scott and all of its Members and the Ranking Member for this incredible recapitulation of what went on during that period of time. Just think back with me. It was in 1963 that we lost Medgar Evers. Then in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, where freedom somewhere occurred, Goodman, Chaney and Schwerner gave their lives. We have Attorney Cohen here, who with Morris Dees broke the back of the Ku Klux Klan by incredible litigation. We have Doug Jones, who led the prosecution of the 16th Street church burnings. We have the prosecution of Doug Jones and the work that he did in these cases. We have another incredible person, Sykes, who was close to Emmett Till. All of this converging together. And the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives on this 12th day of June, 2007, where we are making history by correcting the incredible activity that went on during this unbelievable period of time in which tragedy and the hopes of people came together as in no other period in our history. We are all in the same room, and I want everyone to know that this is very moving for me. Because when we examine this period of time, Martin Luther King, the Civil Rights movement, the pathos, the disorganization that went from the lowest farmer in Mississippi up through the President of the United States, all were involved in this incredible, finally successful, attempt to drive legal segregation out of the history and experience of this country. And it is still with us. We still have a problem. There are people that are right now very much afraid of what role they might be called to play in this because some of these lingering fears still exist. So I have never been more proud of being a Member of the House Judiciary Committee than I am this morning; and I again congratulate the two Subcommittee Chairmen, the Ranking Members and the Members of the Committee. Thank you very much. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I would now recognize the distinguished Ranking minority Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, the gentleman from South Carolina--North Carolina, excuse me. I should never get my Carolinas mixed up--Mr. Coble, for his opening statement. Mr. Coble. Mr. Chairman, I will hold you harmless for that grievous error. Mr. Nadler. I appreciate that. Mr. Coble. Mr. Chairman, I am actually standing in for the distinguished gentleman, Mr. Forbes from Virginia, who was unavailable to be here. He asked if I would present his statement, which I am pleased to do. And, Mr. Chairman, I have to attend a Coast Guard hearing at 11:00, so when I depart I don't want you to think it is because of lack of interest. Because as you, the distinguished gentleman from Arizona and our distinguished gentleman from Michigan have accurately stated, this is a very, very significant hearing today. I appreciate you and Chairman Scott holding the hearing of H.R. 923, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act of 2007. As my colleague, Ranking Member Franks noted, the murder of Emmett Till in 1955 was both brutal and unconscionable. Even more troubling is that the justice system failed Emmett and his family in prosecuting his killers. As we meet here today, James Ford Seale, I am told, is on trial in Federal District Court in Jackson, Mississippi, for the 1964 kidnapping and murder of 19-year-old Charlie Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Kee. Seale and a group of fellow Klansmen abducted Mr. Moore and Mr. Dee, drove them to the Homochitto National Forest and severely beat them with sticks. They were then wrapped in a plastic tarp--you may have mentioned this, Mr. Franks, in your statement--with duct tape over their mouths and hands and driven a hundred miles distance away where they were eventually dumped into the Mississippi River while still alive. Seale was arrested in 1964, but the charges were subsequently dismissed. Although 40 years have passed since these horrific murders, it is my hope that justice will be served for the families and friends of these young men. This case is but one of the unsolved Civil Rights Era murders that the FBI and the Department of Justice are investigating or assisting with local investigations. I join my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, in strong support of this bill to provide additional tools and resources for those Civil Rights Era cases; and I again welcome our witnesses and thank you for joining us today. Before I yield back, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Texas, Mr. Gohmert. Mr. Gohmert. Thank you, and I thank my friend, Mr. Coble. I have got to go to another hearing in another matter, but I did want to say I do think this is a worthy bill, and I would welcome the opportunity to co-sponsor it. A crime against anyone in this country is a crime against all of us. As the Chairman of the full Committee knows, I supported the hate-crimes bill. I hate to see us giving precedence to one group over another, because truly a crime against any one of us in this country is a crime against all of us; and I am glad that this bill is being brought forward. These things need to be addressed. I yield back my time. Mr. Coble. I reclaim and yield back. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I would now recognize the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Scott, for his opening statement. Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and I would like to thank you for convening this panel. I would like to extend a very special welcome to Ms. Myrlie Evers-Williams and Ms. Rita Schwerner Bender, who have traveled long distances to be with us today. It is interesting that this day has special significance because, although it wasn't intended, it was exactly 44 years ago today that Byron De La Beckwith assassinated the field director of the Mississippi NAACP, Medgar Evers, outside of his home in Jackson, Mississippi. After her husband's death, Ms. Evers courageously devoted her life to his memory and dreams, keeping those dreams alive and bringing his killer to justice. Her tireless efforts, including strong support of the NAACP, eventually paid off when her husband's killer was brought to trial for a third time in 1994 and finally found guilty of the murder more than 30 years after the crime. Ms. Williams, welcome. Likewise, it took Ms. Schwerner Bender 41 years to get some semblance of justice for her husband. On June 21, 2005, Edgar Ray Killen was finally convicted of manslaughter for the deaths of Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman and James Chaney in 1964. The Committee also welcomes you, Ms. Bender. These cases are only two of dozens of murders that would have never been acknowledged, investigated or prosecuted without the courageous commitment to justice by a few individuals that have been named by the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Conyers. Indeed, we do not even know how many people were murdered during the 1950's and 1960's because many families did not dare report that their loved ones had been murdered for fear of retaliation. The FBI has identified more than 100 cold cases that should be further investigated; and, if possible, charges should be brought against those accused killers. I support the adoption of H.R. 923 because it will assist the investigation and prosecution of unsolved Civil Rights crimes by authorizing funds to the Department of Justice, the FBI and, where appropriate, State and local law enforcement agencies. It will also require the Attorney General to establish positions within the Department of Justice and FBI where a specific person will be accountable for ensuring that these cases are investigated. DOJ will report to the Congress annually on the progress that has been made to solving these cases. The first report will be due 6 months after the bill becomes law. The FBI and the Department of Justice have already made a start at investigating these cases when it kicked off its cold cases campaign last February. However, as this hearing will soon demonstrate, there is an urgent need for the Federal Government to provide additional resources to both the Department of Justice and the FBI. H.R. 923 will accomplish this. I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation and yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Chabot. Mr. Chairman, before the gentleman yields back, can I have a yield for just a moment? Mr. Nadler. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. Chabot. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will be very brief. I didn't have an opening statement, but I was thinking as Mr. Conyers was giving his opening statement, as somebody who was born in 1953 and so when this was going on. I was, basically, still a kid. Many of us have studied many of the great leaders in the Civil Rights movement and those that were so directly affected. But some of us have lived it. And Mr. Conyers and John Lewis and some others, Fred Shuttlesworth, who isn't a Member of Congress but is a leader in my district in Cincinnati, it has been an inspiration the time that I have had an opportunity to listen to Mr. Conyers, for example, on issues related to Civil Rights that we deal with in this Committee. As I say, we studied it, we have learned about it, but a gentleman like Mr. Conyers really lived it; and it is always inspiring to be in the same room to hear stories that he has told and to have been one of those Members of Congress that had the great honor to go to Rosa Parks funeral in Detroit. A woman who was obviously was not only one of the early leaders in the movement, even though at the time I don't think she was going to be a leader in the movement, but who actually worked in Mr. Conyers' office, Rosa Parks did, which a lot of people don't know. So I just want to tell Mr. Conyers what an honor it is to have been able to actually listen to one of the early leaders in the movement on an everyday basis in this institution, and I yield back. Mr. Nadler. I thank the gentleman. In the interest of proceeding to our witness and mindful of our busy schedules, I would ask that other Members submit their statements for the record. Without objection, all Members will have 5 legislative days to submit opening statements for inclusion in the record. Without objection, the Chair will be authorized to declare a recess of the hearing. As we ask questions of our witnesses, the Chair will recognize Members in the order of their Subcommittees, I should say--alternating between majority and minority, providing that the Member is present when his or her turn arrives. Members who are not present when their turn begins will be recognized after the other Members have had the opportunity to ask their questions. The Chair reserves the right to accommodate Members who arrive late or are only able to be with us for a short time. Our first witness will be Grace Chung Becker, Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department. Your written statement will be made part of the record in its entirety. I would ask that you now summarize your testimony in 5 minutes or less. To help you stay within the time, there is a timing light at your table. When 1 minutes remains, the light will switch from green to yellow and then red when the 5 minutes are up. Thank you, and you may proceed. TESTIMONY OF GRACE CHUNG BECKER, DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL, UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, WASHINGTON, DC Ms. Becker. Thank you very much. Good morning, Chairmen Nadler and Scott, Ranking Members Franks and Forbes, and Congressman Coble, who is standing in for Congressman Forbes, and all the Members of the Subcommittee. It is an honor and a privilege to testify this morning about the work we are doing at the Department of Justice regarding Civil Rights Era murders. These horrific crimes constitute some of the greatest blemishes upon our history, and I commend the Subcommittees for their efforts to support our activities in this area. The Department strongly supports the important legislative goals of H.R. 923. This is a very exciting time for us at the Civil Rights Division. Civil rights is one of the top priorities of the Department. Last year, the FBI began its cold case initiative to identify and investigate Civil Rights Era murders. On February 27, 2007, the Department announced the next phase of this initiative, the FBI's partnership with the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Urban League. The Civil Rights Division has also been taking an active role in prosecuting cold cases. In January of this year, a Federal Grand Jury in Mississippi indicted James Seale, an alleged former member of the Ku Klux Klan, on two counts of kidnapping and one count of conspiracy. These charges stem from Mr. Seale's alleged participation in the 1964 murders of two young men, one of whom was a Civil Rights worker. Trial is currently under way; and, like every defendant, Mr. Seale is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Being able to bring even a single historical prosecution in Federal Court is extraordinary and very exciting. Federal prosecutors must overcome constitutional challenges, jurisdictional hurdles, as well as practical limitations. For example, the ex post facto clause of the Constitution prohibits retroactive application of criminal Civil Rights statutes enacted after the time of the incident. H.R. 923 applies to crimes occurring before December 31, 1969. However, two of the most important Federal statutes for prosecuting racially motivated homicides were not enacted until 1968. Therefore, the ex post facto clause bars use of these statutes when the incident occurred prior to 1968. In addition, the 5-year statute of limitations for Civil Rights crimes during this era expired quite some time ago. Nevertheless, the division is committed to bringing these cases where we can. We have creatively used noncivil rights statutes in prosecuting some capital offenses. For example, in 2003, the division successfully prosecuted Ernest Avants, a Mississippi Klansman, for the 1966 murder of Ben Chester White, an African American man. There was Federal jurisdiction because Mr. Avants shot Mr. White multiple times inside a national forest before throwing his body off a bridge. Mr. Avants participated in the racially motivated killing in an attempt to lure Martin Luther King to the area so he could attack him as well. Mr. Avants had been acquitted of State murder charges in 1967. We were able to obtain Federal jurisdiction because the murder occurred on Federal land, a national forest, which falls within special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States; and because the Federal murder statute was enacted in 1948, the prosecution was not barred by the ex post facto clause. Similarly, capital offenses have no statute of limitations so that we were able to overcome that hurdle as well. In addition to the constitutional and jurisdictional challenges, there are also substantial evidential hurdles to prosecuting 40-year-old cases. Witnesses and, as Congressman Franks described, potential criminal defendants have passed away. Memories have faded, and sometimes evidence is simply lost. Because of the long passage of time, many of the victims' families, friends and the Nation will never be able to see justice served inside of a courtroom. But even in cases where there is no Federal jurisdiction, the Federal Government can still play an important role. For example, the FBI recently worked with Mississippi authorities, as was mentioned in some of the opening statements, to investigate the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year old African American teenager who was kidnapped and killed in rural Mississippi. Although there was no Federal jurisdiction, the FBI reported the results of its extensive investigation to the District Attorney for Greenville, Mississippi. Earlier this year, the matter was presented to a State grand jury, which declined to indict anyone. In conclusion, the Department is committed to pursuing Civil Rights Era cases whenever possible and welcomes the opportunity to work with the Committee on H.R. 923. Thank you very much. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Ms. Becker follows:] Prepared Statement of Grace Chung Becker [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT] Mr. Nadler. I begin by recognizing myself for 5 minutes. Ms. Becker, how many Civil Rights Era cases have the Department of Justice brought to date? Ms. Becker. We have investigated a number of matters and have two recent prosecutions, the Avants prosecution in 2003 and the Seale prosecution that is under way as we speak. Mr. Nadler. So just two? Ms. Becker. Two most recent prosecutions, yes. We also have investigated a number of matters--the FBI in conjunction with the Civil Rights Division over the last several years. Even though there was no Federal jurisdiction, we were providing assistance perhaps to the States or, in the case of Emmett Till, handing over our report to the State when we found there was no Federal jurisdiction. Mr. Nadler. And will this bill assist you in bringing more cases? Ms. Becker. It certainly will, Mr. Chairman; and let me explain how. The bill is a very important bill because, of course, these cases are just so important. Even if there is a slight chance that we can bring these cases, it is important for us to investigate and prosecute these cases wherever we can to ensure that no stone is left unturned; and if we can prosecute some of these horrendous crimes that occurred 40 or 50 years ago we should certainly do so. If Congress were to approve the resources in H.R. 923, that will facilitate the ability of both the FBI and the Civil Rights Division to effectively investigate and prosecute these matters. The FBI, as Chairman Scott mentioned, has already identified over 100 potential Civil Rights era cases that could benefit from investigation and prosecution. Mr. Nadler. And these 100 cases you think are, to coin a phrase, bringable despite the ex post facto and constitutional problems and may help the bill bring its resources. Ms. Becker. I think the bill will do a number of things in addition to the resources. I think it also brings a lot of national attention and emphasizes the importance of these types of cases for the general public. I think, in addition, it also provides some grant-making authority so that I believe that it would enable the Federal Government to share some of these resources with the States, which it has not been able to do before. So that if the FBI or the Civil Rights Division is assisting in an investigation and determines it doesn't have Federal jurisdiction, perhaps the State can bring a prosecution with some additional resources as well. Mr. Nadler. Thank you very much. I yield back, and I recognize the gentleman from Arizona. Mr. Franks. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you, Ms. Becker, for joining us here today. It occurs to me it is probably difficult to identify all of the cases that you would like to pursue. Are you working in conjunction with Civil Rights organizations or media? How do you identify the cases that you think have the best opportunity to be pursued? Ms. Becker. The FBI reached out to its various field offices around the country and has worked with various Civil Rights groups, the NAACP, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Urban League, just to mention a few. And I know Mr. Cohen, who is on the second panel, is one of our partners in this endeavor; and the Southern Poverty Law Center has been very helpful in providing a number of cases from the Civil Rights era. It is unclear today what the state of the current evidence is in all of those cases, whether or not there are still viable leads in these cold cases. So that is something that the FBI is in the process of assessing. Mr. Franks. Once you identify a case, and I can imagine many, but what is your greatest logistical challenge? Is it physical evidence? Is it the lack of witnesses? Is it just the age? Is it statute? What is your biggest logistical challenge? Ms. Becker. I think it is a combination of all of those things. First and foremost, from the Federal perspective, our jurisdiction is limited. We have those constitutional and statutory hurdles that I mentioned. The States are in a little bit of a better position, because many of them do not have the same statute of limitations problems that we have for murder, which, of course, was a crime during that time period, and there is no ex post facto concern there. The evidentiary hurdles cannot be underestimated as well. Some of the defendants that we would like to prosecute have passed away. There are also witness issues and evidentiary issues. Some of these cases were investigated perhaps 40 or 50 years ago, and it is unclear what the status of that evidence is at this point. Mr. Franks. It sounds like you, many times, pursue murder charges because they are the only ones that you can pursue; and a lot of the other egregious tragedies that took place have to be glossed over in a sense because there is a statue of limitations that makes it impossible, is that correct? Ms. Becker. That is correct. Capital offenses have no statute of limitations. But the statute of limitations issue gets a little bit complicated because there were some offenses where death resulted earlier on that did not have unlimited statute of limitations at the time the crime was committed. So it is very fact specific. It is a case-by-case basis. That is why it is so important that we analyze these cases thoroughly on an individual basis. Mr. Franks. Ms. Becker, if you were writing an amendment for this Committee to put in some of our Civil Rights laws or other laws that are not developed as they should be in order to pursue justice in these cases, are there some things that Congress can do to make it easier for you? Whether it is getting rid of some of the--and I know sometimes you are dealing with State law, but if we could do anything in the pursuit of justice in these egregious cases, what would we do from this Committee's standpoint? Ms. Becker. I think H.R. 923 is a step in that direction, Congressman; and I think that would be very helpful to the Administration. Mr. Franks. And can you just for the Committee's sake one more time give us a sense of how 923 empowers the Department to pursue these cases? Ms. Becker. I think if Congress were to approve the resources in 923, it would enable us to provide greater attention to the investigation and prosecution of these cases wherever is possible. I think it also enables us to create partnerships with the State and local governments with a lot of these cold cases, even in cases where the Federal Government does not have jurisdiction and is not able to bring it. I think those are two very important ways that it does so. I think it is also very important for the American public to understand that these cases are still important and that we have not forgotten about them; and even though we call them ``cold'' cases, we are looking for burning embers wherever we can find them. Mr. Franks. Well, let me just encourage you to continue to do what you do for these ofttimes forgotten children of God. It is a noble thing that you do. Thank you. Ms. Becker. Thank you. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. I now recognize the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security, Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott. Thank you; and thank you, Ms. Becker, for your testimony. Is the amount authorized in H.R. 923 sufficient for you to do all that you have available to do? Ms. Becker. Congressman Scott, I believe that the amount, if Congress were to approve it, would be put to very good use; and I think that that amount would be sufficient, at least from what we can tell at this point. It is hard to say because there is a 10-year life to this statute, but I think at this point it seems like a good start. Mr. Scott. In following up from the questions from the gentleman from Arizona, do you have any recommended amendments to this bill? Ms. Becker. I have not seen the latest version of the bill, so I may have some additional comments when I do, but I believe the goals of the bill and I think that the bill is a very positive step in the right direction. Mr. Scott. Now you mentioned statute of limitations. Do any States have a statute of limitation on murder? Ms. Becker. I am not aware of any at the current time, but I would want---- Mr. Scott. Are there any other crimes that have either no statute of limitations or statute of limitations that haven't expired yet for other crimes other than murder, or do most of them expire after about 5 or 10 years? Ms. Becker. Murder is the quintessential example of a case that does not have the statute of limitations. Mr. Scott. So we are limited just to murder cases pretty much? Ms. Becker. I believe that is correct. Well, if I can make one correction, It is not just murder cases, but in cases--capital offenses. So, for example, in the Seale case we are charging kidnapping resulting in death, which is a capital offense, so there is no statute of limitations under Federal law. Mr. Scott. Some of these have been tried and acquitted in trials that I think weren't fair. Are we going over those, too, to see if there is any opportunity for the Federal Government to retry them in a forum that would be fair? Ms. Becker. I think that would depend upon which forum the defendant was tried in, if the defendant was tried in the State court and acquitted and the Federal Government could take a fresh look at it and could see if there is a potential Federal prosecution there. However, because of the double jeopardy clause, once they have been acquitted once in the State court, then the State can not bring a subsequent prosecution. Mr. Scott. Is there statute of limitations on the Civil Rights murder statutes in the Federal system? Ms. Becker. The statutes that we normally prosecute under-- the Civil Rights statutes we would normally use, there is a statute of limitations issue there. So what we have tried to do is work creatively using non-Civil Rights tall capital offenses that do not carry a statute of limitations, such as murder on Federal land or kidnapping resulting in death. Mr. Scott. But if they have been tried in State court, would that not be double jeopardy if it is essentially the same charge. Ms. Becker. If it is with the Federal Government, it is a separate sovereign, so there wouldn't be a double jeopardy problem there. Mr. Scott. Could you say a bit about the nature of your, I think you said, formal partnership with the NAACP, Urban League and Southern Poverty Law Center. Ms. Becker. Yes. This is the FBI's partnership with the individual Civil Rights organizations asking for any cases that they may be aware of in the Civil Rights era or any leads that they may have with respect to these cases. Mr. Scott. That is asking for information. Is there an ongoing partnership? Ms. Becker. I think it is intended to be an ongoing dialogue. As time goes on, individual field offices may reach out to the individual offices there. Mr. Nadler. Gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. Coble. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Becker, good to have you with us. Ms. Becker, you indicated the Department of Justice had brought to trial two cases for the Civil Rights era. Over what period of time does that cover? Ms. Becker. Avants was in 2003, and Seale was this year, Congressman. But I should say that the Civil Rights Division has also been very active in other prosecutions as well. In the 16th Street bombing case, the Department of Justice was involved in the investigation of that matter before it was tried by the State. Mr. Coble. How many attorneys are there in the Civil Rights Division? Are any of those attorneys exclusively assigned to Civil Rights Era cases? Ms. Becker. We have currently approximately 50 prosecutors in the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division, which would be the section that would responsible for potentially prosecuting these crimes; and we are able to use all of those resources to prosecute Civil Rights Era crimes. We have, obviously, some attorneys who are very experienced in this area and have worked on a number of these cases, and they provide subject matter expertise, but at this point that is not 100 percent of their portfolio. Mr. Coble. Ms. Becker, once a case is set for trial, do the attorneys in your division participate in the actual trial? Ms. Becker. Definitely. We work hand in hand with the U.S. attorney's offices around the country. So, oftentimes, the trial team will consist of a trial attorney in the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division and perhaps an AUSA in the local U.S. Attorneys office or sometimes even the U.S. Attorney himself. Mr. Coble. I think you have previously answered this question, but, as I understand, you do work closely with Civil Rights organizations, the media, State and local authorities, do you not? Ms. Becker. That is correct. Mr. Coble. In your testimony, Ms. Becker, you stated that the Department has concerns with creating a new unresolved Civil Rights crime investigative office. Elaborate on that, if you will. Ms. Becker. I think that has been resolved in the latest version of the bill, but the concern at the time was creating an additional layer of--additional office when one may not be necessary. The bill currently has a 10-year sunset. So, initially, the FBI will probably be doing some initial legwork to see which of these cases are ripe for a potential investigation. And if it seems like these investigations are ongoing, a prosecutor from our office will become involved and participate actively within the investigation as legal questions arise, if witnesses have counsel, if there are special investigative techniques that need to be pursued, and also to guide the investigation to ensure that we can meet the jurisdictional hurdles, finding out whether or not this occurred on Federal land or finding out whether or not interstate commerce is affected. Those are questions that perhaps an agent may not think of without the assistance of a Federal prosecutor, and so we will work hand in hand with them. And then at a certain point, if it looks likes a prosecutable offense, we will then work with the U.S. attorney's office to bring an indictment and prepare for trial. Mr. Coble. I can appreciate the obstacles that you face, the ex post facto concerns, the statute of limitations, the passage of time, witnesses deceased or unavailable, the passage of time-dimming memories, all sorts of obstacles that you confront. I commend you all for going ahead. Mr. Chairman, I think this is a good bill, and I am fully supportive. I thank you and Mr. Scott and Mr. Forbes and Mr. Franks for having conducted this hearing; and I thank you again, Ms. Becker, for having been with us and yield back. Mr. Nadler. Thank you. The distinguished Chairman of the Committee, the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. Conyers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you, Chairman Scott, as well. Ms. Becker, you come here from what may be considered by many to be the most significant part of the Department of Justice, the Civil Rights Division; and within it is the Criminal Section, Special Litigation Section, Housing, Education, Employment, Voting, Appellate, Disability Rights, Coordination and Research. This division was created by President Lyndon Baines Johnson when we passed the Civil Rights law of 1964, a historic moment that not only created a kind of excitement and movement and, in some places, unfortunately, violence. So you, as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Section, have enormous responsibilities; and the Judiciary Committee, by having jurisdiction over the Department of Justice, has a huge responsibility. One of the things that we are pledged to do is to help make you as effective as possible, and we wanted to just chat with you about that. Because, as you know, the Department of Justice has come under scathing investigation and criticism over the last several months. I see so many subjects in here. Are you able to comment on the number of lawyers and assistants and resources that you have here, give us some kind of idea of how you stacked up to get results? Look at these different sections of the Civil Rights Division. America would be a different place if we could produce improvement in voting, in employment, in housing, in education, disability rights and, of course, the work that you are doing in the Criminal Section. Can you give us an idea of how things are going? Ms. Becker. I can tell you, Congressman, that the Civil Rights Division is vigorously enforcing all Federal Civil Rights laws. We are--for example, in the criminal division our section has been very vigorously enforcing all areas that are within our jurisdiction. So, for example, almost half the cases we brought last year were in the color of law area. Those are traditional law enforcement misconduct cases that we brought. We have also brought significant numbers of hate crimes and human trafficking crimes, as well as the Civil Rights Era murders. Mr. Conyers. Well, I am glad that you used the term ``vigorously'' because I haven't used it. I mean, I just had Reverend Al Sharpton come in from New York about police abuse in two cases; and we are working on them. We are getting complaints in the voting section. I was in Ohio when I met the angriest group of people I had seen after the election day problems that they had there. This goes on and on. We have got a lot more to talk about, but, as you know, this Committee will be working in a larger scope. I just wanted to bring that to your attention and mention, also, Mr. Chairman, that John Lewis just sent us a message. He is in New York speaking at the memorial service of David Halberstam; and, as the author of this bill, he wanted us to all know why he is not here. Because I saw him yesterday and told him you were coming, and I was stunned to find out that he asked us to make it clear about his inability to be with both of you today. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and return the time. Mr. Nadler. I thank you. Gentleman from California? Mr. Lungren. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I might say the evidence is that America is a very different place today than it was when these tragic events occurred. We have benefited much from the Federal pieces of legislation, the various Civil Rights acts that have passed and been implemented and enforced by Administrations, Democrat and Republican, over the last 40 years, but yet there is still a stain that remains on our national history, and that is these unsolved cases coming out of the Civil Rights era. I view this legislation as a now-or-never piece of legislation. We already have, as you suggested, some potential defendants who have died---- Ms. Becker. That is correct. Mr. Lungren [continuing]. Witnesses who are no longer here, trials which took place which raise the issue of double jeopardy. If we are ever going to do as much as we possibly can, we need to do it now in the next 10 years. Time runs out. History doesn't stand still for us. So I appreciate what you are doing, and I appreciate the Administration support for this legislation. Just to make clear on the record, in the last Congress when we had legislation presented in the Senate by Senator Talent, the Justice Department was concerned about some parts of it and said in a letter that the Constitution bars the law then being considered, S. 2679, from retroactively conferring Federal jurisdiction to prosecute such Civil Rights crimes. Two of the most important Federal statutes for prosecuting racially motivated homicides, 18 U.S.C. 245 and 42 U.S.C. 3631, were not enacted until 1968. Moreover, from crimes committed prior to December 31st, 1969, virtually all Federal criminal Civil Rights statutes carried a 5-year statute of limitations, even where death resulted. So I think it is important to note that the current bill and the manager's amendment does not seek to establish or expand Federal jurisdiction to prosecute Civil Rights crimes in a major way, it authorizes significant funding to establish a continued effort for the next 10 years. So I think it is important for members of the public to understand it is not an easy thing to follow these cases and to prosecute these cases because of the various things you mentioned in your testimony. But, nonetheless, we are going to do the best we can. You have bipartisan support of this Committee and I suspect on the floor of the House and the Senate for this. This ought to be something that transcends any type of partisanship. In some cases, we are going to be disappointed, because we will run up against double jeopardy and we are going to run up against the difficulty of witnesses and finding evidence, but the fact that we might fail in some circumstances is not an excuse for not trying. It ought not to be viewed as a failure on the part of any of us to do what we can do now. We are in a very different place than we were when the trials of some of the suspects or defendants in these cases took place and within an hour or 2 hours a single-color jury found somehow that people were not to be held responsible for their actions. When you look about the case of the young man for whom this bill is mentioned, it is inconceivable that grown men think that somehow they became better men by brutally killing a 14- year-old boy. I mean, that is hopefully how far we have come from a country in which certain segments of our society would believe that that was not only justifiable but it was affirming of them as human beings to do that to another human being. So I thank the authors of this bill, I thank the Chairmen of the two Subcommittees for getting together to have this hearing and to move this bill, and I thank you for what you and your colleagues are doing at the Administration. And I thank our witnesses coming up on the next panel who have lived this experience in ways that most of us will never live it. We have to stand in awe of their courage and persistence in seeking justice and in making this a better place. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nadler. Yield back? Mr. Lungren. Yes. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, gentleman. I now recognize the gentleman from Tennessee. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am a first-year person on this Subcommittee. It is the first time I have had the opportunity to have somebody from the Justice Department before us who either didn't have to be sworn in or not want to be sworn in. It is a nice occasion to have you before us and also to see this Committee in such a bipartisan fashion and agreeing on the subject matter. It is not nice to see--I went through this book during the testimony. I was listening, but this Southern Poverty Law Center has put together this book. It is a history, really, for what us old enough to recall about the Civil Rights era and the horrific deaths and the conditions and the challenges and the heroics of people. It is hard to fathom, as Congressman Lungren said, adult people committing these crimes or having these thoughts, but they did, and they need to be brought to justice, if possible. Are there any files of the FBI that are not available to you, tapes, undercover tapes or anything like that, that you would need access to? Ms. Becker. I am not aware of any problems along that regard, Congressman. I think the FBI and the Civil Rights Division work very closely together, and we have had very a good relationship in terms of accessing evidence. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Do you know of any files at all that are not available to you? The FBI seemed to have a wide surveillance system during that time. Ms. Becker. I would have to defer to the FBI on what files they have. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Have you inquired? I would hate to defer to the FBI, to be honest. Do you have any reason to believe that there are files not available to your division. Ms. Becker. I have no reason to believe that. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Have you made inquiries? Ms. Becker. I have not. We do make inquires on a case-by- case basis as we investigate and prosecute these cases hand in hand with the FBI, and that has been an issue that has not come to my attention at all. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Dr. King's assassination is the last--of course, it is not the last death, it is the last in this book, hid the records of the investigative Committee in the late '70's are sealed until the year 2028. Have you made any efforts or do you believe any of the material therein would help you in looking into the people that might have been conspirators or aiders and abettors to that death. Ms. Becker. I could tell you the Civil Rights Division looked into allegations in the late '90's regarding Martin Luther King, Jr., and issued a report regarding those allegations which ultimately proved not to be credible. Now there may be additional allegations out there, but I can tell you there were two in particular that we specifically looked at in the Civil Rights Division. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Do you know if there is information in those files that might be helpful to you? Ms. Becker. I believe that our attorneys that worked on the MLK investigation at the time had access to all the information that they needed to do the scope of their investigation. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. I appreciate your work and your interest here and the Members of the Committee in this bipartisan fashion. When you look at this you have to think about the horrors of slavery. I read about the passage--and, of course, last weekend was the middle passage ceremony in Charleston, South Carolina, and other places in the country. The way people were brought to this country for 250 years in slavery and Jim Crow laws and the signs Jim Crow must go. And yet some people in Arkansas and you can see the faces of Little Rock Central High School and at Oxford people that were resistant to change. What happened under crimes against humanity, of slavery and Jim Crow laws is inexcusable. It was allowed by this Nation, unfortunately. And I believe and I have got a bill and I would hope that some my Republican colleagues might take the lead and join us in passing an apology for this Nation. Right now, we have 102 Democratic cosponsors and one Republican. This should be bipartisan, as it was in the States of Virginia, Delaware, North Carolina and Alabama, where apologies and regrets have been expressed. I would hope my Republican colleagues, who I know understand that and thought about it and obviously, by hearing the questions today, have concerns, as we all do, would join us to have a bipartisan and not a partisan apology for slavery by this Congress. Thank you. Mr. Nadler. Does the gentleman yield back? Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Yes, sir. Mr. Nadler. I now recognize the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ms. Becker. I want to reserve most of my substantive comments for the second panel. Two close friends of mine are on that panel, and I will have a chance to greet them in--not too long, but I wanted to acknowledge two individuals and make a substantive comment while you are here. First of all, I want to recognize Alexander Acosta, who is the current U.S. Attorney in Miami, who used to be your boss, I suppose, as chief for the Civil Rights Division. He has been a 20-year friend of mine. We were at Harvard undergrad and Harvard Law School together. Mr. Acosta is now the U.S. Attorney in Miami. He was the individual who revived a lot of the cold case prosecution investigations within the Department of Justice. So I don't want the hearing to pass without acknowledging him. Second of all, as an Alabamian, I don't want the hearing to pass without acknowledging William Joseph Baxley. Bill Baxley was attorney general of my State during the 1970's; and, to follow up on Mr. Lungren's comment, Alabama was a very different place in the 1970's than it is today. Mr. Baxley made the very difficult political decision to prosecute a man who was linked to the 16th Street bombing, and that was a very unpopular choice and possibly prevented him from ever being Governor of my State. He now practices law in the State of Alabama. He has been an outstanding public servant but never got a chance to sit in the Governor's office in part because of his political courage. I want to make sure that he and people like him were acknowledged today. One of the inspiring things about this panel, these cases would have gone away but for individual prosecutors many times at the State level but sometimes the Federal level who were willing to revive them and who believe that, frankly, the South is a better place than it once was. I want to turn to one substantive area and pick up where the Chairman of the Committee left off. You talked about the agenda of the Justice Department now, and you mentioned a variety of cases. You mentioned the hate crime prosecutions. You mentioned a number of prosecutions that have been brought by your Department. The one thing that was missing from that litany, if I heard you correctly, was a reference to voter suppression cases. You are obviously aware of the phenomenon of voter suppression. Those are official but organized activities, rather than individuals who were trying to keep someone from exercising their right to vote. It can be done through a variety of tactics: misinforming people about their eligibility or having loud bullhorns on Election Day outside Black and Latino precincts announcing to people that if you have unsatisfied judgments that you can't vote, if you have outstanding debts or if you have warrants that you can't vote. There were a variety of voter suppression tactics that have been launched around the country, and I was curious how many prosecutions to your knowledge has your Department brought in voter suppression cases? Ms. Becker. I don't have those numbers available to me right now, Congressman. I came here to speak about H.R. 923. Mr. Davis. Do you know of a single one? Ms. Becker. I don't have those numbers here. Mr. Davis. I mention it because I fully recognize you are here to talk about a very good, bipartisan bill; and I will say more with the next panel. But I think Mr. Conyers and the Chairman were correct to raise these issues, because we don't get to hear from the Civil Rights Division a lot. It is fairly limited scope testimony; and, from your earlier testimony about the kinds of cases you have brought, I assume you do have some broad familiarity of what the Department is doing. So I would frame it this way. I hope that you will gather that data and if for whatever reason the answer is none and zero I would hope that this Department, the current leadership, would correct that. Individuals trying to prevent people from exercising the right to vote is as fundamental a violation of our Constitution and legal structure as any other kind of crime; and, frankly, I think part of reason you don't remember any cases like that is there haven't been very many, if any, and that ought to be a priority. I know of at least one instance this year this Committee has passed a bill to address those issues. I yield back my time, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nadler. I thank you gentlemen. I recognize the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. Ellison. Thank you, Ms. Chung Becker, for your testimony today. I just have a brief statement. I want to say I thank the Chair of this whole Committee for bringing forth this bill and also this hearing. I think there are some people who might say this happened a long time ago, let's get on with it, but I think that ignores the generational trauma that hate crimes like this inject an entire community with fear. The fact is the terror that Civil Rights workers and others faced when we were trying to bring our country into democracy was so prevailing and the nature of the murders was so spectacular that it injected a paralyzing fear into the entire community. I don't know if we have yet to really recover from it. I want to agree that America is a different place than it used to be 40 years ago, but it is not enough of a different place for me, particularly when we think about some of the civil and human rights violations we see still committed. Some of them I think are sanctioned by Government and law. So I want to say to the Chair that I think this is a very important hearing, and I hope that the resources that this bill can provide will motivate the Department of Justice to be vigorous in its approach. I don't think two cases is very many compared to the number of cases that there are. I don't know why there is only two. There may be a good explanation. You mentioned things like statute of limitations, ex post facto and all that stuff, but I know--as a person who has practiced law for 16 years, I know that where there is a will there is a way. I just want to say hats off to all the State prosecutors and some Federal, as Congressman Davis mentioned, but I hope the resources provided in the bill do get to the Justice Department and enliven and help the Civil Rights Division to prosecute some of these cold cases. Mr. Nadler. Does the gentleman yield back? Mr. Ellison. Yes. Mr. Nadler. I thank you, gentleman. Ms. Chung Becker, our Members may have additional questions after this hearing. Ms. Jackson Lee. Mr. Chairman. Mr. Nadler. I recognize the gentlelady from Texas. Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank the Chairman, and I thank the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for being here. I think this bill's underlying premise is that we have no choice, frankly. If this country is to ask its citizens to believe it is a country of laws governed by a Constitution that includes the right to due process, then we have denied any number of family members, in essence, due process or the right to have closure to the cases that have been so heinous. I note it has been indicated that your initial testimony regarding H.R. 923 mentioned something about resources and the possibility that you would have some issues of witnesses or evidence generating or whether or not it would duplicate the Civil Rights Division. I think that this is so unique, these cases are cases of mutilation, they are cases of heinous murder, and I applaud some of the deep South Department of Justice officials and also State and local officials who had the courage to recognize that an unsolved case is an injustice. It is an injustice for the families. It is certainly an injustice for the deceased person who, as a member of this society, under a Constitution that promised in its early premise the Bill of Rights and the Founding Fathers' statement of we are all created equal, knowing that the lives of many individuals were lost in a time that they were not considered equal. In fact, they were brutalized for their viewpoints but also for the thoughts people had about them. So my question again, if I can--if it has been asked and answered, but I want it again for the record, will the Justice Department accept the fact that this is necessary and that to either ask for resources or believe resources to such a section could provide a vital relief to those who still mourn and those who still feel, undermined if you will, because of the lack of solving of these crimes? Ms. Becker. The Department believes that this bill is a very important bill, H.R. 923. We wholeheartedly support the legislative goals that are behind this bill. We have been working with Congress as the bill has progressed through various iterations. I think we have had a very good and productive bipartisan working relationship on this matter, and we look forward to continuing that relationship as we go forward. Ms. Jackson Lee. So, based upon the structure of the bill, the Justice Department is supporting crafting, carving, establishing an Unresolved Crime Section separate and apart from the Civil Rights Division. Ms. Becker. Congresswoman, I am not sure--there have been various versions of the bill. I am not sure if that version is currently in this bill or was in an earlier bill. But I believe that issue has been resolved. Ms. Jackson Lee. Well, when you say you believe it has been resolved, resolved in what manner? Ms. Becker. I believe there has been a bipartisan agreement as to the structure of who the designee will be in the Civil Rights Division, who the designee will be at the FBI. So I think all those issues about--whether we call it a section or office or a working group, I think all those technical issues may have been ironed out. Ms. Jackson Lee. Well, do you come with a knowledge of whether or not the Justice Department would welcome a free- standing section, regardless of what you think has been worked out, versus a section that is embraced under the Criminal Division and the Civil Rights Division? Ms. Becker. The Department doesn't believe a separate section is necessary. However, we are committed to bringing these cases wherever we can and have been working very closely with staff on both sides to come up with a framework that I think everybody has found acceptable. Ms. Jackson Lee. The Justice Department in the passing of this bill would advocate for the full funding so that those assigned to this area would in fact be able to vigorously pursue these cases? Ms. Becker. If Congress were to approve the funds, certainly that would facilitate the FBI and Civil Rights Division's ability to review the over 100 matters that have been identified, too, as potential Civil Rights Era murders and to investigate--fully investigate and prosecute wherever appropriate. Ms. Jackson Lee. I just close by simply saying that if you would take a message back, as this bill progresses, compromise is certainly something that all of us are willing to consider. I, frankly, believe in an established free-standing section for a time certain so that full concentration could be part of it might be the better approach. Obviously, we are in the legislative process as we speak, but I would also just ask that you take back the message that we are sharply either understaffed or underfocused of the Civil Rights Division, because this period of time has the lowest prosecution of Civil Rights cases it might be in the history of the existence of the Civil Rights Division, and that raises enormous concerns for all of us who believe in the prosecution of cases so that people's rights can be vindicated. And I hope that you would convey that message. Ms. Becker. I will certainly convey that message, Congresswoman, and I will also review our statistics as well to see what we can provide for you in order to clarify any of those numbers. Ms. Jackson Lee. I would be happy to receive them. I thank the gentlelady, and I yield back. Mr. Nadler. I thank the gentlelady, and I yield to the gentleman from Iowa. Mr. King. I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this hearing, and I appreciate your testimony. Just some broader questions to put this into a context for myself and hopefully for this panel. The title of the bill says that it is Unsolved Civil Rights Crimes, so that implies these are race-based crimes, and I presume they are, and I support this legislation and encourage prosecution investigation into these crimes. But I would ask, is there a sunset in this bill? Ms. Becker. That is correct. There is a 10-year sunset in the bill. Mr. King. That clarifies that it is envisioned that we will solve these cases at some point or the perpetrators will--the biological solution will come to the perpetrators at some point, and it won't be necessary to have this legislation that goes on and perpetuates itself. That is the main point I wanted to emphasize. And, also, that even though it is titled Civil Rights, these kind of race-based crimes can work in either direction. Is there a crime that--most of this is White on Black crime, I presume? Are there any incidents of it going the other way that are part of the investigation as well? Ms. Becker. I am not aware of any currently, but I have not reviewed the 100 plus cases that have been brought to our attention. But my inclination is that the vast majority, if not all of them, are African American victims. Mr. King. They are the victims, and that is what makes the tragedy, and it was done within a political context, too. Is there anything in the language that would preclude an investigation that might be the other direction from race. Ms. Becker. Let me just pull up the bill---- Mr. King. It has to be difficult to analyze that in front of this panel at this time. I would just pose that question; and, if you would prefer, I would be happy to receive an answer to that after the hearing sometime. Ms. Becker. If I can just comment, H.R. 923 doesn't create new substantive legal provisions in terms of new crimes that we can bring. So we can look at cases that occurred prior to December 31st, 1969, for any Civil Rights violations that may have occurred prior to that time. Mr. King. That is my answer. I thank you very much, Ms. Becker; and I would yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Nadler. Thank you, gentleman. Ms. Chung Becker, our Members may have additional questions---- Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Mr. Chairman, may I ask one question. Mr. Nadler. I yield the gentleman 1 minute. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The question the gentleman from Iowa asked was a good question. There are these not just White on Black crimes. Some of these crimes are White on White people who are helping Black people, is that correct? Ms. Becker. That is correct. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. So we can rest assured that some of the victims are not all Black victims. There are White victims, too. They are just people of goodwill who were trying to see that the law was changed to be what it should have been in the first place, that if we didn't have laws that permitted slavery, that permitted Jim Crow, that permitted and reinforced segregation, that these people wouldn't have to do their mission and their job to help make the law the way it should have been. Ms. Becker. I appreciate the clarification. That is exactly right. If you look at even some of the cases brought in 1960's like the Mississippi Burning case, for instance, you do see that some of the victims were either African Americans or persons of all colors helping African Americans. Mr. Cohen of Tennessee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman; and thank you, Ms. Becker. Mr. Nadler. Ms. Chung Becker, our Members may have additional questions after this hearing. We have had some difficulty getting responses to our questions in general from the Justice Department and timely responses when we get them at all. Will you promise to provide a written response to our written questions, should there be any, within 30 days of the receipt of the questions. Ms. Becker. I will do my best. Mr. Nadler. I would now like to introduce the second panel, if the second panel will come forward. The first witness is Ms. Myrlie Evers-Williams. Myrlie Evers is the founder of the Medgar Evers Institute and Chairman Emeritus of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. She was one of the pioneers of the Civil Rights movement, along with her husband Medgar Evers, whose assassination in 1963 finally saw justice through Ms. Evers- Williams tireless efforts after 30 years. Ms. Evers-Williams holds a sociology degree from Panama College. She was the first African American woman appointed to serve as commissioner on the Los Angeles Board of Public Works, and was chairman of the NAACP from 1995 to 1998. A second witness is Mr. Douglas Jones, who, as U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, brought the prosecution of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing case, one of the most notorious cases of the 1960's. Our third witness is Mr. Richard Cohen, who is the president and chief executive officer of the Southern Poverty Law Center. Our next witness is Rita Bender, who is one of the most courageous Civil Rights workers who went to Mississippi to register voters in 1964. She continues to fight for justice today. Her husband, Michael Schwerner, was killed, along with Andrew Goodman and James Chaney. They were murdered because they stood up for justice and the rule of law in Mississippi in 1964. Our final witness is Mr. Alvin Sykes, President of the Emmett Till Justice Campaign. I am pleased to welcome all of you, and at this point I am pleased to recognize for a brief statement Mr. Davis of Alabama. Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me have the honor of, first of all, greeting again Ms. Bender, Ms. Williams. We have met previously, and it is good to see you ladies again. I have the honor of saying a little bit more by way of introduction. Two close of friends of mine are here today. Doug Jones for the Northern District of Alabama, who was an exemplary criminal defense lawyer and exemplary United States attorney--and, as the Chairman pointed out, the 16th Street prosecution, the prosecution of two individuals who committed a crime that at that time was 37 and 39 years old respectively. Very few people thought a conviction could be obtained on 37- year-old or 39-year-old evidence. This United States attorney was skilled enough to win convictions before predominantly White juries in both those instances, and I am glad to see him here and thank him. My first boss in the professional world--I was an intern in 1992 at the Southern Poverty Law Center--Richard Cohen, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Center, has a litany of outstanding constitutional cases to his pedigree, one of which I want to note before the Committee. The very first time that a civil judgment was recovered against the Ku Klux Klan happened based on a case in Mobile, Alabama. Because of Richard Cohen's appellate advocacy and his skill, that verdict and judgment was secured, eventually satisfied. I thank him for his outstanding leadership and for his leadership in starting the new Civil Rights center in Montgomery, Alabama. I was honored to be the keynote speaker on that occasion several years ago. Ms. Bender, I believe I met you there. So, Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing me to recognize my friends who are here. Mr. Nadler. I thank you, gentleman. Again, I am pleased to welcome the witnesses. As a reminder, each of your written statements will be made a part of record in its entirety. I would ask that you now summarize your testimony in 5 minutes or less. To help you stay within that time there is a timing light at the table. When 1 minute remains, the light will switch green to yellow and then red when the 5 minutes are up. Mr. Nadler. We will begin by recognizing Ms. Myrlie Evers- Williams. TESTIMONY OF MYRLIE EVERS-WILLIAMS, BEND, OR Ms. Evers-Williams. Good afternoon, honorable Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittees. Mr. Nadler. Could you turn on your mike, please. Ms. Evers-Williams. All right. Once again, thank you, honorable Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittees, for the opportunity to testify in support of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, H.R. 923. My name is Myrlie Evers-Williams. I am president of MEW Associates, Inc., founder of the Medgar Evers Institute, chairman emeritus of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and most widely known as the widow of Civil Rights leader Medgar Wiley Evers. Medgar Evers was the first NAACP field secretary in the State of Mississippi, his native home. He was the major, unofficial investigator in the murder of Emmett Till. He disguised himself as sharecropper. He frequently changed the cars and trucks that he drove to gather information that was sent beyond Mississippi's ``cotton curtain'' to media sources elsewhere. He met with and assisted relatives of Emmett Till, including Ms. Mamie Till-Mobley. Medgar's involvement in this case was reported in depth, particularly in the Johnson publications of Ebony and Jet magazines. How appropriate for me to be here today remembering Emmett Till and the many others, known and unknown, who were permanently disposed of through hate, fear and racism. Medgar Ever's assassination was the first, the first of the modern Civil Rights era to receive international coverage. Our family received telegrams, letters and cards from around the world expressing horror, disgust, shame and just plain condolences, with also a small number of hate letters that expressed joy at his assassination. These letters and Medgar's personal papers now reside at the Mississippi Department of Archives of History in Jackson, Mississippi. Today is June 12, 2007. It marks the 44th anniversary of Medgar's assassination, which was June the 12, 1963. On the night of June 11, 1963, President John F. Kennedy addressed the Nation on Civil Rights issues. Shortly after midnight June the 12, Medgar was shot in the back with a high- powered rifle as he got out of his car returning home from a long, exhaustive day of demanding activity. He had been the voice for justice and equality in Mississippi. Many of those years, he was alone, with little support, mostly because of fear of retaliation that paralyzed others from active and open participation in societal change. There was a time when there was little media coverage, when Civil Rights was not the ``in'' thing to be involved in. Medgar was the spokesperson, the caregiver for the downtrodden in Mississippi. His bravery put him as number one on the Klan's hit list. Death was his daily companion, and we knew it. Medgar's awareness did not begin with his NAACP position. He served in the Army during World War II in Normandy. He returned home, was honorably discharged and enrolled at Alcorn High School and Alcorn A&M College. He graduated with a degree in business administration. While employed with the Magnolia Mutual Life Insurance Company, he applied for admission to the University of Mississippi Law School, becoming the first African American to do so, long before he assisted James Meredith in entering Ole Miss. Believing a solid education was important for all citizens, he filed a suit in the name of our first son, Darrell Kenyatta Evers vs. the State of Mississippi. The result: The legal battle was won, and the schools were desegregated, providing the promise of an equal education for all. The successful voter registration drives, the economic boycotts, removal of barriers to parks, libraries, entertainment centers, transportation, hiring of police officers, equalization of teachers' salaries and many other gains came as a result of Medgar's dedication to equal opportunity. This was a man who wanted no glory for himself but who knew that his country could be a better place for all of its citizens. There are numerous other accounts of his determination and the growing number of activists who joined in the pursuit of the American Dream in spite of the price to be paid. However, shortly after Medgar's assassination, change, though small, became evident. School crossing guards were hired. A few policemen were hired with the restrictions to only enforce the law within their neighborhoods. Libraries and recreational facilities were open to all. Perhaps public attitude spoke louder than ever. After the first memorial service in Jackson, Mississippi, thousands marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to downtown Farrish Street in Jackson, chanting, ``After Medgar, no More Fear.'' details and photos appear in Life Magazine, June, 1963. Fear, one of the strongest hold-backs on freedom, was at last being erased. As we look at the passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act, let us not forget that family members of the persons murdered are also victims. They are human beings who must survive the loss of their loved ones and all that that entailed. The emotional hell that can never completely disappear; the nightmare of the bloody crime scene; the sounds of terror; the firebombs; the sound of gunfire; missing that person's love, care and guidance; the loss of financial support and so much more. Yet there are those who say that Civil Rights cold cases should remain lost in our history. No one benefits. The men are old and will soon die, so why bother? Besides, it costs the public too much to finance such projects. But murder is murder. They were young murderers who happened to grow old. Life was something denied those whose lives were so brutally taken. I set forth on a mission to see that justice would prevail in Medgar's case, based on a promise I made to him shortly before his death. The first trial was another first. No White had been tried for the murder of a Black in Mississippi. The first and second trials both ended in a hung jury. The messages sent to the public was that ``old southern justice'' remained intact. I was on the witness stand testifying when Governor Ross Barnett entered the courtroom, paused, looked at me and proceeded to walk to the defendant, shook his hand, gave a ``good old boy'' slap on his back and sat with him throughout my testimony. The message had been sent to the jury: Do not convict this man. Now, I ask you, Members of the Committee, may I have your permission just to finish this? It will take just a second. Thank you. After the first trial, the accused assassin was given a parade with support banners along the highway from Jackson to his home in the Delta. During the next election, the district attorney ran for governor and the assassin ran for lieutenant governor. I think that was quite a ticket. Years passed. I returned to Mississippi on a regular basis, always questioning people in various parts of the territory for any information that may have heard discussed relevant to the Evers case. Most people claimed that I was insane. ``Keep trying, never give up'' became my motto. Then entered Jerry Mitchell, a reporter with the Clarion Ledger newspaper. He provided me with the hope that some new information had been uncovered, and one miracle after another took place. Missing witnesses were found and were willing to testify; numerous boxes of evidence were found; the murder weapon was found; my personal State-stamped transcript of the first trial was hand-delivered to the District Attorney; FBI cooperated; and a few politicians voiced support that the time had come to right the wrongs of our society. The conviction of the murderer came on February 5th, 1994, almost 30 years to the day of the first trial. Reporters from around the world were there to broadcast the guilty verdict. Our American justice system became stronger. The Medgar Evers case and third trial became a road map for all of the others that have followed. The legal issues: speedy trial, court approval to have a previous transcript read in court, and other legal matters were settled in this case. Since Medgar's case, 29 cases have been reexamined with 29 different arrests and 22 convictions, with one trial still ongoing in Mississippi. One noted Civil Rights leader said at the Arlington Cemetery service for Medgar, that Medgar believed in this country, now it remains to be seen if his country believes in him. The passage of a bill named in honor of Emmett Till would send a message that the country indeed does believe in Medgar and others like him and in the cause of justice. It is a message that is particularly important to send to the young people of today and generations yet to come. Thank you. Mr. Nadler. I thank you.

DOUGLAS JONES, ESQUIRE, BIRMINGHAM, AL Mr. Jones. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee. I am honored to be here today to testify in favor of this hearing. On a personal note, it is especially a privilege for me to be back on the Hill as a former Senate Judiciary staffer to Senator Howell Heflin, who was my mentor and largely responsible for my career. Mr. Chairman, I want to talk just briefly about some of the practicalities of these cases. You will hear from others about what they mean; and, obviously, these cases mean so much to so many people. It is just hard to imagine until you have lived it or even prosecuted it. I am reminded of another victim's mother, the mother of Carole Robertson, one of the children who died in the church bombing. Her mother, Alpha Robertson, testified in the case. When I asked her what she was doing, she heard the bomb and it sounded like the whole world was shaking. And in fact, that was the thing we adopted because the whole world did shake at the sound of that bomb in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. But there are some very practical points that I want to bring out today. The difficulties in overcoming these cases are obvious. Witnesses die. Defendants die. Witness' memories fade. Legal challenges. Evidentiary challenges. But there is even some more beyond that. One of the points I would like to make for this bill is to ensure that there is language in this bill that there is some openness in sharing of information. The Congressman from Tennessee asked a question a few minutes ago about missing files. I believe there are missing files. In a case that is pending in Alabama right now, the Jimmy Lee Jackson case, I received a call from a reporter in Anniston, Alabama the other day who had been told repeatedly and repeatedly that FBI files didn't exist, the old summaries didn't exist. They had not been turned over to the local DA. That case is pending. They had not been turned over to the local defense. But yet, lo and behold, a file appeared from some archive in Missouri with all the interviews in the Jimmy Lee Jackson case. There are difficulties. There are things in those files that quite frankly, and I am being brutally honest about this, there are probably things in those files that the Department of Justice and the FBI just really don't want the public to see. It was not a pretty picture in the 1950's, in the 1960's. One of the critical components of our case against Tommy Blanton was a tape recording made without a warrant in 1964 in his home. And it was the seminal conversation in which Tommy Blanton, and his then-wife Jean talked about the bombing. You have a transcript in what I provided to you today. Before we did the motion to suppress I got a call from our local FBI agent-in-charge. And she was just a messenger because she was all in favor, as was the FBI. Everyone was in favor of these questions--all of these prosecutions, but the devil is in the details. And they were worried about going forward with the motion to suppress because they were afraid that the tape, couldn't get it into evidence and it would, in fact, embarrass the FBI. Well, through some pretty good lawyering, not on my part, but I got a great staff, we did get the tape into evidence, we did not embarrass the FBI. But I think some of those attitudes are still prevalent. And my point is that there are a lot of files. And those files have to be open to all prosecutors within the Department of Justice and in state with State investigators and State prosecutors if that is where these cases end up being prosecuted. The second aspect is funding. And I appreciate the fact that there is funding for this bill. It takes a lot to prosecute these cases. It takes a lot of money to investigate these cases. And I hope this bill not only will allow for the Department of Justice to use that funding to investigate and prosecute cases, but I also hope it will allow the Department to redirect some of those resources. Because as a practical matter most of these cases are going to be prosecuted if at all in state court. I think the jurisdictional and constitutional challenges with resurrecting these for Federal jurisdiction is going to be very, very difficult. My district attorney in Jefferson County, Alabama or the Alabama attorney general would not have the opportunity to fund these cases and to do them properly. The third thing, and the third and fourth are actually together. I also think that we have to manage expectations. These cases are very difficult. They mean so much to the victims. They mean so much to the communities. But they are, at the end, very, very tough cases. And no one should get their hopes up that all of these 100 cases the Department is looking at now will ultimately end up in a prosecution. They have to be done the right way, they have to be done zealously, but also fairly, because the defendants also have rights as well. And I hope as part of that, my last point is that as we proceed with these, that we as a society, not just through this bill, but we as a society will also examine other ways. For those cases, that can't be prosecuted there has to be some form of reconciliation. We are a country of compassion. And in working with victims and others hopefully there can be some form of reconciliation. Mr. Chairman, I applaud the Committee, I applaud my friend, Congressman Lewis and Senator Dodd, over on the Senate for doing this. If we are to be serious about the war on terror, we have to acknowledge that it began long before September 11, 2001. And this bill and the funding it provides will help alleviate the problems. And as I said, following the cases of Tommy Blanton and Bobby Frank Cherry, justice delayed will not have to be justice denied. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Jones follows:] Prepared Statement of G. Douglas Jones On September 15, 1963, four young African-American girls, Denise McNair, Addie Mae Collins, Cynthia Wesley and Carol Robertson, died from a bomb blast that ripped into the ladies lounge of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. The shockwave created by this senseless tragedy was felt around the world and proved to be a pivotal point in the struggle for civil rights in this country. On May 1, 2001, a jury in Birmingham convicted Thomas Edwin Blanton, Jr. of murder for his role in the bombing. A year later, on May 22, 2002, another Birmingham jury convicted Bobby Frank Cherry, the last surviving suspect in the crime. During the decades between these historic events, Alabama experienced a phenomenal shifting of attitudes which made the prosecutions possible. Yet, the passage of time also created numerous legal obstacles. Some of the strategies used in this overcoming these obstacles were particular to this unique case. Most, however, were the tools and techniques we as trial lawyers use throughout our careers. Much can be written and said about the case of State of Alabama v. Thomas Edwin Blanton, Jr. and the case of State of A"
