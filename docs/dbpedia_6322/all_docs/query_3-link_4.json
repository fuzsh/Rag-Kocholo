        "text": "Agent 47, also known as \"The Hitman\", \"XAO47[2]\" and \"Mr. 47\", or simply by his birth name \"47\", as well as many aliases, is the titular protagonist of the Hitman series. He is a professional hitman and was the former top agent for the International Contract Agency (ICA), until he exposed agency information to the public, ending them permanently. After exposing the ICA and destroying Providence, both 47 and his former handler Diana went freelance and now operate a murder-for-hire service by themselves.\n\nHis genetically enhanced body and mind - combined with his extensive knowledge, rigorous training, and decades worth of experience as a contract killer - turned him into the world's deadliest and most efficient assassin.\n\nAgent 47 was created by Dr. Ort-Meyer as the Five Fathers' 47th clone in his underground cloning laboratory, disguised under the surface appearance of a sanitarium in Romania.\n\nOverview[]\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigins[]\n\nAgent 47 is a genetically enhanced human being, his DNA is the culmination of decades of secret research into gene augmentation. His creation was funded by five criminal masterminds who donated their own DNA to the project.[3]\n\nIn the 1950's, five men of various nationalities began serving in the same unit of the French Foreign Legion, namely, Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer, Lee Hong, Pablo Belisario Ochoa, Frantz Fuchs, and Arkadij Jegorov.[3] After finishing their service, Ort-Meyer started up a mental institution in Romania as a cover for genetic experiments, while the other four became major crime lords and terrorists. In exchange for research funding, Ort-Meyer decided to provide his former comrades with donor organs harvested from clone bodies, which could extend their longevity. Therefore, even while the terrorists were in their 60s, they looked much younger.\n\nDr. Ort-Meyer's goal was to create \"perfect assassins\" who could be as physically fit as humanly possible and were capable of obeying orders with devotion and unquestioning loyalty.[3] Dr. Ort-Meyer tried to make his discoveries public before the 47 clone was created, however, he was discredited as a scientist by his peers as they thought that Ort-Meyer's radical theories were insane.[3]\n\nInfancy and Tube[]\n\nAgent 47 was created on September 5, 1964, in Ort-Meyer's asylum in Romania. He had the numbers \"640509-040147\" tattooed on the back of his head (\"64-05-09\" is the date of creation, \"04\" marks he is part of Series IV, \"01\" marks that he is the first, and \"47\" is to represent that he is the 47th), followed several years later by a Universal Product Code. Dr. Ort-Meyer saw 47 as his first genetically complete success and gave him slightly more attention, even though he had other specimens to consider.[4]\n\nFrom ages five to seven, 47 was quiet and showed little social interaction. His only display of affection was towards a runaway laboratory rabbit he adopted on August 21, 1970, displeasing Dr. Ort-Meyer.[4] However, it died on May 2, 1972. Ort-Meyer noticed 47 crying and was surprised, as he'd never seen any of his clones do so before. Five years later, 47 also showed affection to a pet mouse. He cared for the mouse for about a month, until it was killed by a fellow clone as a cruel prank.[4]\n\nWhen 47 returns to Ort-Meyer's lab in Contracts, circa 2000, five incubated clones can still be found in chambers bearing the Five Fathers' names. However, Contracts takes place in 47's memory, and other details from Contracts (such as Alvaro D'Alvade's name originally being Phillipe Berceuse) have since been retconned, casting these five clones' canon into doubt.[5]\n\nAdolescence[]\n\nBetween ages thirteen and twenty-three (1978–1987), 47 began a fairly negative relationship with the asylum staff, attributed to his chronic uneasiness stemming from his regular medical checkups and frequent injections. On one occasion, 47 stabbed a doctor repeatedly with several needles, thus, prompting Dr. Ort-Meyer to assign more security for 47. Along with the other clones, 47 was trained from youth to kill efficiently. He was instructed in the use of firearms, military hardware, martial arts, the use of disguises, and the use of more classical tools of assassination like the infamous fiber wire and sniper rifle. During his training, he was noted for his exceptional marksmanship, as well as for attacking the asylum staff with homemade slingshots, all of which were promptly confiscated. He also shot smiley faces into targets when he was bored. This is one of the only possible examples of 47 being exposed to pop culture, although all of the clones were sufficiently educated about the outside world by using traditional school textbooks.\n\nAs portrayed in the comic series Agent 47: Birth of the Hitman, 47 had formed a brotherly relationship with a clone named 6 and together they were an impressive team of assassins. Ort-Meyer would often send his clones on assassinations for extra income - 47's and 6's targets included two plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Blue Seed Pharmaceuticals, Peter and Nancy Burnwood, coincidentally the parents of 47's future ICA handler Diana Burnwood.\n\nOn March 23, 1977, 6 convinced 47 to run away from the asylum with him, and they took refuge in a small farming village before being apprehended again, everyone in the village was killed to eliminate any witnesses. They would try again many years later in 1989 - while on assignment in Berlin, they coerced a German scientist to neutralize their explosive chip implants (he was the same person to have designed them, while being employed by Ort-Meyer), after which 47 killed him against 6's intentions. When they returned to the asylum as instructed, they attempted to free the rest of the clones (killing several guards in the process) before 6 escaped and 47 was taken in by the rest of Ort-Meyer's security. 6 would go on to live in the outside world under the assumed name Lucas Grey.\n\n47 has very different memories of a \"6\" clone in the novel Hitman: Enemy Within; in this version of events, 6 bullied him until 47 killed him in a bathroom stall when they were both 12 (circa 1977). 47 then achieved a daring escape from the asylum, during which he made a fiber wire out of a windowsill and broken parts of a broom, oiled squeaky door hinges to sneak out, and stashed a bow and arrow to kill a guard dog before he jumped the gate and hitchhiked into a Romanian town. He first noticed luxury clothing stores, which may have influenced his penchant for suit-and-tie apparel as an adult. Later, an asylum doctor found him at a bus stop and ironically rewarded him with a pancake breakfast. He explained to 47 that he was right to kill that series 6 clone and had done a good job of it, but should in the future only kill when instructed to do so.\n\nWhen 47's memory was wiped with an experimental serum in Birth of the Hitman, Ort-Meyer convinced him of the Enemy Within version of events, making a passing reference to \"how you killed your tormentor, 6, at the age of twelve.\" 47 insists \"That's not what happened, father\", to which Ort-Meyer replies \"When we're done here, 47, it will be\".\n\nAs a result of the training he had received in his childhood, 47 can wield any weapon with ease on a mission, and can improvise and use common tools with deadly precision.\n\nLast Years at the Asylum[]\n\nOn September 5, 1989, Dr. Ort-Meyer went so far as to remember 47's twenty-fifth birthday in his journal, although 47 himself didn't, along with comments that he had become \"mature\" and stopped many of his bad habits. In 1993, he stated that 47, now almost thirty, had passed every test he can think of and is his most skilled clone.\n\nSimilar to the experimental serum that erased 47's memory of 6, additional serums were administered to all the clones to try to do away with their emotions. Birth of the Hitman recounts that in 1996, the serums made most of the clones manically depressed, some dying of starvation, dehydration and infected bedsores as a result. Ort-Meyer had made at least 81 clones by then, but they were too weak to carry out assassination contracts in the outside world. Eventually, 47 was the only clone still left at the asylum - most were dead while a rare few, such as 6 and 17, had somehow or another transitioned to living in the outside world.\n\nEveryone backing Dr. Ort-Meyer's research, from Providence to his French Foreign Legion friends, had grown weary of funding him with little results, and relations between them soured. Dr. Ort-Meyer sometimes blatantly suggested that he would use the clones against his French Foreign Legion friends if he felt necessary. Meanwhile, Providence demanded that Dr. Ort-Meyer turn 47 over to their care, after which they would shut down his operation. In 1999, as seen at the beginning of Hitman: Codename 47, Ort-Meyer purposely created a gap in the asylum's security for 47 to escape.\n\nThe very next morning, Ort-Meyer was visited by Providence's Constant Arthur Edwards, who tells him he can resume operations to make them more clones, saying \"If I were a more suspicious man, I'd say you've made yourself indispensable, at a time when you were very much disposable\". It was probably after this arrangement that Ort-Meyer would produce the 48 Series, rapidly aging them to adulthood - despite the likelihood that a previous \"Subject 48\" died as a result of the serum, Ort-Meyer likely reused the number 48 because their design was heavily based on 47.\n\nJoining the ICA[]\n\nAccording to 47's ICA file from the Hitman: Absolution trailers, the International Contract Agency first took an interest in 47's activities in 1998 and enrolled him in 2000.\n\nBirth of the Hitman portrays an incident in late 1999, when multiple contracts were out on the life of Bricolage Technology founder Franklin Marchand - publicly known as a producer of satellite technology, he had a side business producing chemical weapons in Afghanistan, and a leak at one of his secret plants killed at least 500 people in the immediate area. He was set to make a rare public appearance at Place de la Concorde in Paris to announce a relief fund for impoverished people in Afghanistan; 47's unknown client insisted that Marchand die in an apparent accident, telling him \"No other circumstances tolerated. If Marchand dies any other way, he'll be propped up as a martyr.\" Meanwhile, someone else had hired the ICA to do away with Marchand, and they sent a four-member team to gun him down. 47 subdued the ICA team in rapid succession, then held a cab driver at gun point to make him run down Marchand with his car. Afterwards, Diana met with 47 in a bar and delivered ICA's offer to audition him, and strongly recommended to the ICA that they hire him.\n\nThe prologue of HITMAN portrays 47's audition for the ICA, conducted by training director Erich Soders and handler Diana Burnwood at a top-secret facility in a remote, snowy region. 47 went through rigorous training programs, psychological evaluations, and a thorough background check, although they found very little about 47's previous life. While Burnwood believed that 47 would be an invaluable asset to the ICA, Erich Soders was very reluctant to recruit 47 because of how little they knew about him, telling Diana, \"Frankly, it's as if the earth just spat him out.\" Soders suspected 47 of lying about coming from a Romanian asylum, ironically because 47 covered his tracks perfectly. Soders grew displeased with this lack of information on Agent 47's background, as there was nothing from 47's past that the ICA could use as leverage against him, and administered the strictest possible tests on 47 in hopes of being able to reject him. Learning of this plot Diana also chose to \"bend the rules\" and helped 47 to pass his audition. 47 was then made a full agent of ICA and Diana Burnwood was assigned to him as his handler.\n\nAssassination of the \"Five Fathers\"[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman: Codename 47\n\nOne year after escaping the asylum and very recently after joining the ICA, Agent 47 was contracted to kill four high-profile underworld figures - the hits were ostensibly ordered by four different clients, but are later revealed to be the machinations of Dr. Ort-Meyer.\n\nFirst was Red Dragon Triad leader Lee Hong, who was so well-protected that 47 and the ICA only felt ready to target Hong after playing the Red Dragon Triads, Blue Lotus Triads and Hong Kong's corrupt police force against each other in a complex chain of events, after which 47 successfully infiltrated the Red Dragon headquarters and killed Hong. It was also during this operation that 47 first met CIA agent Carlton Smith, later to become a regular ICA informant.\n\nNext was an assignment to kill Colombian drug lord Pablo Belisario Ochoa and destroy his drug plantation, which 47 was only able to locate by gaining favor with the local U'wa tribe that had long been terrorized by Ochoa's cartel enforcers. Once inside the complex, 47 killed Ochoa and blew up the drug facility while escaping in a propeller plane.\n\nThe third contract was against the three Fuchs brothers - Fritz, Frantz, and Fabian - who worked alongside each other as Nazi-sympathizing terrorists. 47 first killed Fabian in Kamchatka, Siberia, alongside ex-Russian General Sergei Bjarkhov who was prepared to sell nuclear arms to the Fuchs brothers. 47 then proceeded to Budapest, Hungary to murder Frantz and Fritz Fuchs, and defuse a bomb that the Fuchs had planted in the vicinity before it detonated during a United Nations summit.\n\nFinally, 47 was sent to kill Russian crime lord Arkadij Jegorov while his tanker was docked in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Coincidentally, a job opportunity unrelated to Ort-Meyer also brought 47 to Rotterdam; the Rotterdam Chief of Police hired 47 to kill Flaming Rotterdam leader Rutgert Van Leuven, recover some blackmail material, and kill Klaas Teller (a private investigator who previously failed to do the same job). Unfortunately, the bikers were expected to meet Jegorov and tracking him down became more difficult with Van Leuven gone. Nevertheless, 47 tracked one of their men to a rescheduled arms deal with Jegorov's underboss, who 47 then tailed to Jegorov. 47 infiltrated the ship, eliminated Jegorov and defused yet another large-scale bomb aboard Jegorov's tanker before escaping.\n\nOnly after all four contracts were fulfilled did the ICA discover that they were secretly ordered by the same person, Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer. The ICA still accepted a fifth and final job from him and, only at Ort-Meyer's insistence, assigned it to 47 again. Upon returning to his childhood asylum in Romania and killing his official target, Dr. Odon Kovacs, 47 regained many of his memories from the asylum (as revealed much later in the series, 47 sometimes regains memories erased by the serum when presented with familiar environments and visual stimuli). 47 immediately proceeds further into the asylum to kill Dr. Ort-Meyer (who responds by calling a SWAT team to the asylum), and coincidentally finds Agent Smith being held captive in one of their wards. Smith directs 47 to the cloning lab's secret entrance, after which 47 shoots his way through an ambush of 48-series clones, confronts Ort-Meyer in his office, and kills him by snapping his neck. 47 then ventures back up to the asylum, evades the Romanian authorities, and steals Ort-Meyer's car to escape.\n\nSeeking a New Life[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman 2: Silent Assassin\n\nFor a year or two, 47 attempted to leave his life as a hitman behind, instead finding faith in a Catholic Church on the Sicilian countryside and working as a humble gardener. 47 had garnered mythical status in the global criminal underworld for his exploits, though most of them assumed he was dead. However, 47 was tracked down by Sergei Zavorotko (a major arms dealer, in possession of WMDs, and 47's \"uncle\") along with a Mystery Man from the United States. Around the same time, 47's pastor Fr. Emilio Vittorio was kidnapped by mafia don Giuseppe Guillani.\n\n47 got back in contact with the ICA and agreed to accept another contract in the near future, in exchange for intel and satellite footage regarding Guillani's villa. However, upon killing Guillani and searching the villa, 47 was disheartened to find out that Vittorio had been moved to another location - Diana informs him that Vittorio was \"dragged along by four bearded, Russian-looking types in uniform\" (later revealed to be working for Zavorotko, who secretly re-kidnapped Vittorio to lure 47 out of retirement).\n\n47 was still obligated to repay the ICA for their assistance by accepting a new contract, which happened to involve Russian military figures - 47 correctly suspected that it was somehow related to Vittorio's mystery captors. This began a string of dangerous missions, all paid for by Zavorotko so that he could assemble various parts of a WMD and silence anyone with knowledge of his actions (one of the men 47 killed during this campaign, Masahiro Hayamoto Jr., was given a funeral on December 4, 2002). Nevertheless, Zavorotko's possession of a WMD is publicly exposed, and Zavorotko falsely suspected that 47 tipped off the authorities (though it was likely the Mystery Man setting Zavorotko up for failure instead). Zavorotko then sent Agent 17, another Ort-Meyer clone who was loyal to Zavorotko and the Mystery Man, to kill 47 - when Zavorotko tried to set a trap for 47 in St. Petersburg, 47 successfully killed 17 and first confronted Zavorotko verbally via 17's earpiece. Zavorotko and his squad immediately descended on Gontranno (Vittorio and 47's home parish, which 47 later used as a personal base), with Vittorio in hand, to wait and try to catch 47 off-guard. 47 also survived this second trap, successfully killing Zavorotko and his men while rescuing Vittorio.\n\nVittorio then thanked 47 for rescuing him, and asked him to not lose hope and try to get back on the right path. Vittorio reluctantly let 47 leave his church, and gave him a rosary. However, 47 had taken away from the experience that his only purpose in life was to be an assassin, that he and his loved ones would never be safe, and that he must remain a hitman to provide for and protect himself. 47 left the rosary beads hanging on a wooden gate of the church, later to return to the ICA. However, 47 remained in contact with Vittorio as of Hitman: Enemy Within and entrusted Sister Mary with Victoria in Hitman: Absolution, suggesting he did not abandon his faith altogether.\n\nGetting Competition[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman: Enemy Within\n\nAgent 47 casually resumed his life as a contract killer for the next several years. When on a mission to eliminate \"Big Kahuna\", the elected leader of a council of biker gangs, he discovers that an assassin was hired to kill him. This results in the assassination of Big K being botched, though he recovers footage that reveals the assassin is a member of Puissance Treize (French for Power Thirteen) and that another member of the group has infiltrated the ICA. After tracking down another member of the Puissance Treize, Ali bin Ahmed bin Saleh Al-Fulani, in Morroco and discovering the identity of the traitor, who happens to be a board member called Aristotle Thorakis, he tracks him down and eliminates him. Shortly after 47 killed Thorakis in 2003, his seat on the ICA board was taken up by Erich Soders, the training director who had reluctantly cleared 47 for field duty roughly four years ago.\n\nNear Death Experience[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman: Contracts\n\nOn March 18, 2004, 47 was shot by a police officer, while returning to his hotel room after killing Richard Delahunt and Alvaro D'Alvade at an Opera Hall in Paris. He made his way to his hotel room, wondering how the officer knew him, only to collapse unconscious on his hotel room floor. While blacking out before being revived by an ICA medic, 47 thought back on his previous missions. After 47 regained full consciousness, detective Albert Fournier and his tactical squad surrounded 47's hotel room. 47 escaped the hotel, killed Fournier, and met Diana (in person) on a flight to the United States.\n\nICA Liquidation by the Franchise[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman: Blood Money\n\nOn his flight out of Paris, Diana gave 47 a file explaining that they were again under the threat of a serious rival, known as The Franchise.\n\nThey had deep connections to international governments and their own army of albino clones. As part of their goal to keep the cloning technology to themselves, they planned to make Daniel Morris the US President by killing politicians and having him succeed them (Vice President Spaulding Burke being their first victim, in a supposed car crash only a day ago, on March 17). Their leader, former Federal Bureau of Investigation director Alexander Leland Cayne, had an inferior cloning program and wanted to replicate Ort-Meyer's methods, but required Agent 47's bone marrow to learn the entire process.\n\nAs 47 continued his work, now living in the United States, most of the International Contract Agency agents and management left within the next year and a half. On August 15, 2005, Diana explained to 47 that they were the only two surviving members of ICA and after 47's last assignment, she would split what was left of the ICA's money with him before they bid each other goodbye for good. 47 was soon after contacted by Agent Smith to kill Daniel Morris (who was Vice President by that time) after Smith learned of his corruption and intent to kill President Tom Stewart.\n\n47 successfully infiltrated the White House to kill Morris and Mark Parchezzi III, the Franchise's albino clone assassin, on September 22, 2005, thereby preventing Stewart's assassination. Morris' death was confirmed as a murder and gained a very large amount of media attention, and although 47 escaped alive and unidentified, a government cover-up claimed that the assassin was shot and/or broke his back while trying to climb over a gate during his escape.\n\nVery soon after, Diana Burnwood approached Cayne and the Franchise for a job, and was directed to lead them to 47. She then walked into 47's hideout alone and poisoned him with a syringe when his guard was down, after which a Franchise squad (directed by Cayne himself at the scene) stormed in to collect a bone marrow sample from 47's body and later prepping it for a funeral. At the funeral, it is revealed that Diana dosed 47 with a non-lethal serum instead, and once Diana administers the antidote and leaves the scene, 47 awakens at his own funeral and kills everyone at the scene (consisting of Cayne, his bodyguards, a journalist and a priest).\n\nAfter his fake funeral, 47 initially declined to contact Diana or anyone else in the ICA, instead going to meet with an unknown crime figure at an Asian establishment. What happened during the time in between is not specified in the games, but Agent 47 eventually returned to the ICA and resumed work with Diana Burnwood.\n\nBack at the ICA[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman: Damnation\n\nUnbeknownst to 47, Diana has had a spat with her superior Benjamin Travis over the development of a \"pet project,\" the engineering of Victoria, and plans to defect from the ICA before they kill her. Diana makes her move in September 2011, while she was helping Agent 47 on a mission taking place in Tibet at a rather crucial time. 47 is injured as a result but manages to eliminate the target and escape.\n\nTwelve months after the Tibet incident, Agent 47 is paid by Roget to kill Hector Corado, both drug dealers in the Caribbean. Agent 47 successfully kills Corado during a yacht party hosted by organized crime billionaire Emilio Fernandez, off the coast of Jamaica. While 47 is flying to Rio de Janeiro aboard a private flight, the plane crashes into the sea, which 47 survives by jumping off moments before the plane crashes into the water. He is pulled aboard the ICA-owned Jean Danjou II. He is re-initiated into the ICA by Benjamin Travis, and assigned to kill US Presidential nominee Dana Linder and later televangelist Charlie Wilkins. Wilkins in fact ordered both hits, the first to position himself to run for President and the second to trap and silence Agent 47.\n\nWhile investigating the Church of Will in Virginia, undercover as an Iowan farmer named Stan Johnson, 47 begins a romance with Wilkins' insecure personal assistant Helen McAdams, but she dies in a riot where 47 also manages to kill Wilkins (on November 1, 2012, four days before he would likely have been elected president) by driving over him with a truck. In Diana's absence, 47 is instead handled by Benjamin Travis, and their difficult working relationship prompts Agent 47's eventual rebellion.\n\nA Personal Contract[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman: Absolution\n\nAgent 47 was then finally sent by Benjamin Travis to kill Diana Burnwood, who holed herself and Victoria up in a rented mansion along Lake Michigan near Chicago, Illinois. 47 infiltrated the home and shot Diana in the chest while she was showering. He accepted her dying wish to protect Victoria and kill Travis. On the way out, he asked Victoria why Diana saved her, and she told 47 that she wanted to get her away from \"the doctors.\" 47 recalled his own horrible experience at Ort-Meyer's asylum before deciding to protect her. He then took Victoria to Chicago's Rosewood Orphanage for safekeeping. 47 was considered rogue by Benjamin Travis, who issued a kill order on him. Blake Dexter, a weapons manufacturing magnate, was informed of Victoria's whereabouts by Dom Osmond and kidnapped her for genetic research and to extort a ransom from the ICA. Agent 47 is aided by his own man about town, Birdie, who later betrayed him to Dexter and the Chicago PD. Agent 47 was in Chicago for Chinese New Year, dating the mission Hunter and Hunted February 10, 2013.\n\nAgent 47 followed Dexter to his hometown of Hope, South Dakota, where he killed most of Dexter's inner circle within a few days (the player has the choice of making 47 kill Blake's son, Lenny Dexter, or leaving him for dead in the desert). 47 then returned to Chicago where he infiltrated Dexter's penthouse, killed him and rescued Victoria.\n\nLater, Agent 47 went to Diana's supposed grave in Cornwall, England where he killed Benjamin Travis along with his assistant, Jade Nguyen. It is ultimately revealed that 47's shooting of Diana was not actually fatal - Diana and Victoria move back into their Lake Michigan mansion, and 47 is seen peacefully watching over them on a balcony with a zoom scope. In the mission debriefing, Diana wires money to 47 for his services and welcomes him back to the ICA.\n\nA World of Assassination[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman (2016 video game)\n\nIn 2020, Diana Burnwood surmised that four of 47's most recent assassinations (against the IAGO spy ring in Paris, development of a viral superweapon in Sapienza, Italy, and an attempted coup in Morocco, along with the assassination of Indie rock star and media heir Jordan Cross) were in fact orchestrated by a \"Shadow Client\", despite the ICA technically having been approached by four separate, tipped-off clients for those contracts - it was the kidnapping and murder of Jordan's father Thomas Cross during his son's funeral that spurred Diana and the rest of the ICA to investigate the matter.\n\nThe ICA discovered that the Shadow Client's transmissions were sent by a hacktivist Olivia Hall from a farm in Colorado. 47 is contracted to eliminate the Shadow Client and four of his lieutenants at the farm - although the Shadow Client himself is nowhere to be found, 47 discovers the Shadow Client's link chart of Providence members along with a very impressive body of research on 47, which leaves he and Diana to conclude that the Shadow Client has already known about 47 for many years. Among his papers, he also discovers that ICA board member Erich Soders had been selling the ICA out to Providence.\n\nThe ICA confirms that Erich Soders had agreed to sell information to Providence in exchange for a very complex, life-saving medical surgery. To prevent Soders from giving a full list of ICA operatives to Providence and to issue a warning against interference with the ICA's sovereignty, 47 is admitted to the hyper-exclusive GAMA hospital under the alias Tobias Rieper to eliminate Soders and his Providence contact, Yuki Yamazaki.\n\nThink Deadly[]\n\nMain article(s): HITMAN 2\n\nFollowing the assassination of Soders and Yamazaki, the Constant, Providence's top controller, approaches Diana with a deal to eliminate the Shadow Client and his militia in exchange for information on 47’s past, and she reluctantly accepts. Now hired by Providence, the ICA sends 47 to Hawke's Bay, New Zealand, to eliminate Alma Reynard - one of the Shadow Client’s top lieutenants - and acquire any intel on her boss’s identity or whereabouts. From Reynard’s computer, 47 discovers that she was planning on meeting with Providence-affiliated tech CEO Robert Knox, who hoped that the militia would spare him and his daughter Sierra Knox in exchange for their cooperation. 47 was then dispatched to eliminate both Knoxes at the annual Global Innovation Race in Miami, Florida.\n\nThe Constant informed the ICA of the Shadow Client’s identity: a mercenary known as Lucas Grey. Despite being off the grid, the ICA uncovered that Grey and his forces had been getting logistical assistance from two of the world's most feared and notorious crime lords- South American drug lord Rico Delgado and Indian shipping pirate Wazir \"The Maelstrom\" Kale. 47 killed both of them and their lieutenants to sabotage the militia's network, and was paid by Providence for the successful operations.\n\nSwitching Sides[]\n\nThe ICA easily traced Grey to an abandoned asylum in Brasov, Romania, where 47 finally met him face to face. Grey surrendered, and risked being killed by 47 in hopes of reminding him of their true history - that Grey was actually 47's long-lost brother (the fellow Ort-Meyer clone Subject 6), and the two of them had made a childhood pact to one day take down their abusive masters.\n\n47 then agreed to take an antidote to counteract the memory-erasing serum (stolen from an Ether lab by Grey and his militia), in order to remember a crucial lead on Providence’s top controller, the Constant. 47 managed to recall memories of Janus, the original Constant of Providence, who would likely know the current Constant's identity.\n\nTo cover her and 47’s breach of trust, Diana begrudgingly agreed to make a false report back to the ICA, claiming a dead end in Romania and implicating Janus as the true head of the militia. 47 was then sent to Whittleton Creek, Vermont, to eliminate the elderly Janus at his private home in the suburbs, as well as find clues to uncover a connection between Janus and the Constant. In addition, 47 was also tasked with eliminating Janus' Providence-assigned handler Nolan Cassidy, to ensure he cannot contradict the false report back to Providence. 47 learned that both the former and current Constant were set to attend the annual Ark Society gala on November 13, 2020, and Olivia Hall was able to track Janus’ coffin to the Ark Society venue on the Isle of Sgàil in the North Atlantic.\n\nAs the team continues to stake out the gathering in anticipation of the Constant's arrival, Grey provides 47 with an off-the-books request to eliminate his former lieutenant-gone-rogue, Noel Crest, before Crest can ransom Ether and scare Providence into notifying the Constant. 47 travels to Ambrose Island in the Andaman Sea to eliminate Crest as well as pirate leader and ICA-sanctioned target, Sinhi Venthan, to maintain their cover.\n\nWhen 47 and the team eventually arrive at Sgail, they figure out that due to tension between the Constant and Providence's Partners, the Constant submitted himself to a \"kill switch\" chip implant that allowed him to be killed at the press of a remote button. To ensure that they could take the Constant alive, 47 was tasked with eliminating twin sisters Zoe and Sophia Washington, newly-appointed co-chairwomen of the Ark Society, to whom the Partners had entrusted the kill switch remote.\n\nUpon being captured, the Constant (whose own name is revealed to be Arthur Edwards) divulges the Partners' names as Carl Ingram, Alexa Christine Carlisle and Marcus Stuyvesant. Edwards suggested they “follow the money,” sending 47 to the New York branch of investment bank Milton-Fitzpatrick to steal data related to the Partners’ financial accounts. To cover their tracks, 47 was also told to kill the branch director Athena Savalas.\n\nThe bank data showed that the Partners made payments to Haven, a secretive public relations consultancy in the Maldives that secretly dealt in forged identities for wealthy criminals. Realizing that the Partners have started new lives under new identities, 47 was sent to Haven’s private island to eliminate the firm's leadership, so that Hall can hack their servers without interference. Though the new identities and locations of the Partners are successfully acquired, Edwards unexpectedly escaped Diana's captivity and somehow managed to have the Partner's shares redirected to his control.\n\nThe End of an Era[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman 3\n\n47 and Grey immediately trek from the Maldives to Dubai, UAE, where the Providence Partners are hiding out atop Burj Al-Ghazali as the personal guests of Sheikh Omar Al-Ghazali. As they skydived towards the top of the tower, they narrowly missed falling onto the helicopter of Carlisle (who was leaving the tower to regroup at her family estate and try to track down Edwards). 47 eliminated Ingram and Stuyvesant, after which he and Grey discussed how to kill Carlisle and obtain her case file on Edwards. Grey also asked what 47 would do now that he was out of the ICA, though 47 still believed that Diana would negotiate their way back into the organization (as she had done at the end of Hitman: Blood Money and Hitman: Absolution).\n\n47 then proceeded to confront Carlisle at her family estate in Dartmoor, and arrived during a particularly fraught family reunion; amid preparations for Alexa's ostensible funeral, Alexa's younger brother Zachary died in his bed the night before, and the rest of the family was shocked when Alexa arrived the following morning alive and well. Alexa hired a private investigator out of disbelief that her brother would kill himself, and 47 himself has the opportunity to assume the investigator's identity to get in close proximity to Alexa. If 47 asks for Edwards's case file as a reward for solving the case, Alexa will realize 47's true identity but not become hostile at all; instead, she calmly gives him the file and encourages him to kill Edwards. Regardless, 47 does not leave Dartmoor without ensuring that Alexa is dead.\n\nAs he leaves Dartmoor, Grey calls out for 47's help on their intercom during a shootout with a CICADA squadron. 47 infiltrated their attempted arrest of Grey, disguised as one of the CICADA troops, in order to rescue him, only to witness Grey commit suicide with his pistol so as to not blow 47's cover.\n\n47 then traveled to the industrial outskirts of Berlin, Germany in search of Hall. An ICA squadron (led by Agent Montgomery) was in search of both Hall and 47, and to ensure Hall's safety, 47 cleared them out of the nearby warehouse rave venue Club Holle. 47 returned to a nearby abandoned gas station, where he found out that Hall had to personally kill one of the ICA scouts in self-defense. 47 consoled her as she coped with killing someone for the first time as well as Grey's death, with 47 saying \"he made it count\".\n\nHall and 47 brainstormed how to get the ICA off their trail, and devised a plan to leak all of the ICA's information to the public, thereby ending the ICA permanently. To accomplish this, 47 went to the ICA's data hub in Chongqing, China, and killed the ICA's top two archivists in order to disable the server room's biometric locks. 47 killed the two archivists, Hush (coincidentally Hall's former hacking mentor) and Imogen Royce, and deleted all files referencing him and Diana before leaking the rest to a hacktivist website. The data leak quickly became front-page news, triggering dozens of scandals in national intelligence agencies, law enforcement and the private sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Edwards had been contacting Diana since his escape, trying to persuade her to join Providence as a Herald now that he was the supreme leader of Providence, and later upped the ante by saying he'd consider making her the new Constant. Edwards ultimately persuaded her by giving her a dossier, explaining that 47 and Grey killed Diana's parents decades ago when they were still under the control of Otto Wolfgang Ort-Meyer (47 had his memory wiped at the time, meaning he did not remember until Grey administered the antidote during their reunion only a few months ago).\n\nDiana accepted the role of Herald, and attended a summit of Heralds at Don Yates' winery in Argentina - she purposely got herself caught on an airport camera to lead 47 to her, and when 47 greeted her outside the event, she explained that she only accepted Edwards' offer as a ploy to get 47 within killing distance of Edwards, and to climb the ranks of Providence in order to dismantle it from within. She arranged an invitation for 47 at the event, where 47 killed Yates (Diana's competitor for the role of Constant) and a high-ranking Herald named Tamara Vidal who was assigned to watch over Diana (according to a calendar that 47 can pick off the wall of Yates's bedroom, this occurred in April 2021). However, 47 confronted Diana out of paranoia that she truly did sell him out to Edwards, and when they were surrounded by a heavily armored squadron (backed by the ICA and/or Providence), Diana remotely activated a sedative poison that incapacitated 47.\n\n47 faded in and out of consciousness aboard a train traveling through the Carpathian Mountains of his native Romania, with Edwards planning to administer an advanced version of the memory-erasing serum to 47. A sequence of intense nightmares brought about by the sedative poison Diana administered befalls 47, but a vision of the deceased Grey convinces 47 that Diana has not betrayed him. He proceeded to fight his way up the train cars and confront Edwards, who displayed a dose of the serum and offered to let 47 administer it to himself, saying that he was always meant to be an assassin and would live a happier life forgetting the events of the last few years and going back to what he does best. 47 refused, and either kills or injects Edwards, before stopping the train and walking away.\n\nDiana followed through with dismantling Providence, resulting in Alexander Fanin, Tim Quinn and Hamsun Oil's former president among many other Providence assets quietly resigning from their corporate roles within a month of each other. A year later, 47 reunites with Diana at her cabin in the woods, and they agree to start a new, justice-minded assassination business of their own, effectively going Freelance.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nAgent 47 is a bald Caucasian male and has a rather pale complexion and muscular build. His most distinguishing feature is the bar-code tattooed on the back of his head. It lists his date of creation and identification number: [[1]], from which he takes the name \"Agent 47.\" His facial features are quite imposing, with a long face, large cheekbones, prominent brow, recessed forehead and ice blue eyes. Early in Absolution, Agent 47 tries to remove his iconic barcode with a razor, but it remains visible at the end of the game.\n\nAccording to his ICA File from Absolution, he is 6'2\" (188 cm) tall.[6] In the novel Hitman: Enemy Within his weight is stated as 187 lbs (85 kg).[7]\n\nHis appearance is modeled after David Bateson, the actor who has voiced Agent 47 in every game so far. He almost always wears his classic black suit, red tie, white shirt, and black leather gloves.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nEven though 47 is a relatively emotionless assassin, he shows signs of morality, seen in Hitman 2: Silent Assassin confessing his sins to Father Vittorio. Subsequently, he is also depressed at the apparent loss of his spiritual guide that he agrees to take on the \"suicide mission\" of killing Deewana Ji. In HITMAN™, after Club 27, Agent 47 reacts to Diana's concerns over the Shadow Client's actions with \"Someone got rich, the contract was just. How is this our problem?\" The novels often have him pondering the question of his own morality and values.\n\nHis absolute highest priority is completing his contract. He generally avoids collateral damage as a professional assassin, although he will not hesitate if he has to incur any. He is emotionally closed off to the suffering of others when appropriate on a contract, even if they remind him of himself at a younger age. Vocally, he rarely raises his voice, choosing to speak in a calm and relaxed manner at all times. When speaking to another person, he can perfectly mask his true intentions (whatever they might be) and fool the other party with no effort; one of his many strengths is being an expert conversationalist. In addition to that, he can blend into the crowd and adapt his personality to suit any situation, and play the role of another person with the utmost efficiency and credibility, like a \"Wolf in Sheep's clothing.\" He is content with being alone but has a deep if unexpressed admiration for the few people he becomes close to, especially Diana Burnwood, Fr. Emilio Vittorio, Helen McAdams, Victoria and Tommy Clemenza. Agent 47 also shows uncharacteristic sensitivity towards animals that he keeps as pets, such as his childhood rabbit and mouse he found from the asylum itself, and the yellow canary in Hitman: Blood Money (though he is forced to kill it in the cut-scene before Requiem in order to avoid giving his position away). He very rarely shows the same care towards human beings, though notable exceptions include Mei Ling, Father Vittorio, and Victoria (whom 47 and Diana treat sort of like a daughter). He also expressed his disgust at exploiting innocent people, as mentioned during the briefing in Death Factory, when he lamented at how Travis and Blake Dexter used \"children as weapons.\"\n\nAgent 47 approaches his assassinations with professionalism but will, however, not show any hesitation or remorse when it comes to killing or silencing witnesses and other potential threats to his mission. Agent 47 generally speaks in a monotone, proper, non-threatening tone, rarely swearing, or even raising his voice. 47 also has a blank and somewhat sinister facial expression, often scanning the scene with his eyes; the only other facial expression 47 has been known to show is pain. Agent 47 is an accomplished conversationalist despite the fact he's extremely reserved, able to fool and manipulate people with convincing lies and bluffs. Hitman: Enemy Within shows that he has the capability to act far out of his normal personality to imitate people, such as a cocky womanizing biker.\n\nBoth Hitman novels as well as some portions of Hitman: Absolution show a side of 47 he rarely shows. When out of his element or not on assignment, 47 occasionally shows behavior similar to ordinary people. In Hitman: Enemy Within, he is shown cursing when under frustration, as well as rarely sharing jokes with Diana. But more often than not, he prefers to share little words and keeps to himself.\n\nGiven his fee, Agent 47 would have to be a multi-millionaire from his contract earnings but never stops going for new contracts. He only spends his money on simple things like food, suits, gear, and shelter, although he is also known to donate some of it to Father Vittorio. 47 maintains multiple safe houses worldwide, each containing the bare necessities that 47 needs to prepare and execute a contract or lie low. 47 never remains at one safe house for very long, always moving to a different location to stay on the move until he is given a new contract. He does have a particular taste for expensive clothing (suits) and fine dining.\n\nKnowing this, it can be determined that 47 does his work as a hitman for more than just money, but for purpose in life. This is further demonstrated when he did not retrieve the ten million dollar ransom suitcase Blake Dexter had when he eliminated him, but instead let Victoria dump the money on Dexter's body and fly off into the breeze. It is stated that he has to work as a hitman, since trying to live a \"normal\" life will endanger those around him, such as what happened in the second game to Father Vittorio, showing he does show concern to other human beings.\n\nDespite 47's incredibly deadpan and serious personality, he does have a sense of humor and comedic timing. Saying rather humorous lines throughout the games.\n\nPhysical Abilities and Skills[]\n\nPhysical Abilities[]\n\nPeak Human Condition: 47 is at the pinnacle of human physical ability. His strength, speed, agility, reflexes, durability and endurance are at the highest level for a man his age, height and weight. He is capable of taking extensive damage in combat, surviving in freezing temperatures, climbing down the side of buildings, running and jumping across buildings at great heights, withstanding intense physical pain and torture, running at incredible speeds for long periods without tiring and even breaking other men’s neck with ease.\n\nEnhanced Strength: He is physically strong even when compared to adult males of his size and build in peak condition; being able to climb pipes, move, drag and dispose of bodies, snap necks, knock opponents unconscious, force open locked gates just by slamming people into them (as seen in Hitman: Blood Money), and jump from balcony to balcony with minimum effort. Displays of his peak-physical strength have been seen many times, as he is even able to strangle a physically powerful being, such as Tzun. He was even able to toe-to-toe with Sanchez, a man who is physically superhuman due to Warren Ashford's experiments and even kill him with his bare hands.\n\nEnhanced Durability: 47 has survived things that would kill normal humans. He survived a fatal gun wound and was able to walk before passing out. When he was thrown by Sanchez through a wooden door with his superhuman strength, all it did was knock him out for a few minutes. He had even survived being electrocuted by the voltage that would kill a normal person.\n\nEnhanced Speed and Reflexes: Agent 47 is apparently able to easily run 10km (6.2 miles) in 36 minutes and 39 seconds.\n\nEnhanced Metabolism: He has an inhuman and effective metabolism, which has a limited, but sufficient healing factor. His healing is efficient enough to help him recover from a gunshot in a few hours despite him needing some medical attention in order to have the bullet removed and the pain suppressed with some painkillers. He was even tough enough to walk for a long time with critical injuries before passing out. Also, such metabolism allows 47 to quickly recover from the symptoms of drug withdrawal, as revealed in Hitman Damnation.\n\nEnhanced Senses: Agent 47's instincts are so profound that he can effectively visualize everyone around him (and also people of interest such as targets and guards) through walls and floors.\n\nEnhanced Stamina: 47 is capable of engaging in physically demanding tasks (like long-distance running or hanging off of ledges) for long periods of time, and does not get tired easily.\n\nEnhanced Agility: Agent 47's agility is at the pinnacle of human capacity. He is easily able to jump between buildings, dodge blows and gunfire at point blank range, climb great heights unassisted and perform rolls and flips with no issue.\n\nSkills[]\n\nMaster Assassin: Agent 47 was both legendary and infamous for his mastery as a killer-for-hire, and is considered to be the world's deadliest and most efficient assassin. He was formerly the top agent of the ICA and was their most expensive asset. According to an ICA operative dossier, 47 holds a 100% mission success rate: which means he has never failed a single contract given to him. He is very stealthy and elusive, being able to assassinate multiple targets in the same area without drawing any attention.\n\nMaster Spy and Infiltrator: 47 is adept at blending in with his surroundings as well as sneaking around heavily guarded places. He would usually blend in dense crowd and mimic their activities. He is also extremely skilled in espionage, stealth, infiltration/exfiltration, disguises, thievery, and eavesdropping. 47 has an expert-level understanding of the use of disguises in order to access unauthorized areas of a location, as well as knowing which people will see through his current disguise.\n\nMaster Martial Artist: 47 is an incredibly skilled martial artist who is capable of engaging armed and unarmed enemies in hand-to-hand combat and come out victorious. He can also disarm highly trained soldiers and assassins, and swiftly render them unconscious with minimal effort. His fighting style consists of various techniques from Kickboxing, Panantukan, Krav Maga, Eskrima, Muay Thai, Judo, Aikido, Karate, Taekwondo and Jiu-jitsu. 47 is capable of weapon improvisation and using his environment to his advantage during combat. 47 an expert at using melee weapons, whether it be bladed or blunt, during close-quarters combat or while stealthily taking his opponents down.\n\nMaster Marksman: 47 is a master marksman, highly skilled in sharpshooting and knife throwing. He is very proficient in using various types of pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, assault and sniper rifles with pinpoint accuracy and has extensive knowledge of any firearm.\n\nGenius-level Intellect: 47 is an extremely intelligent and knowledgeable individual. He was extensively educated and trained from birth, and possessed a great amount of practical knowledge in survival techniques, tactics, strategy, and investigation. 47 is an expert at adjusting his plans to account for changes, as well as knowing how to plan well in advance and improvising new plans when necessary. In addition to his combat-oriented skills, 47 has also demonstrated various non-combat skills that has helped him many times during his missions (like being able to operate almost any kind of vehicle, or being able to pose as a barber, enologist, or sushi chef).\n\nMaster Tactician and Strategist: 47 is a superb tactician and strategic planner, and is a master of situational awareness. He is very good at lateral thinking and finding highly creative ways to stay ahead of the people who are hunting him. He could effectively track down his targets and determine the best and most efficient course of action. He is also an expert at coming up with and executing plans for a variety of missions and is very good at understanding his opponents and using their flaws and plans to his own advantage.\n\nMultilingualism: Thanks to his travels to many places around the globe, 47 is well-versed and fluent in multiple languages, including English, Russian, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, and many more.\n\nExpert Detective: 47 is able to locate and piece together clues to reach his end goal. He best demonstrates these skills in the Death in the Family mission, where he has the option to investigate the suspicious death of Zachary Carlisle.\n\nExpert Driver: It is evident that Agent 47 is a very skilled driver, judging from how well he managed to maneuver Dr. Ort-Meyer's car past a police blockade (in rainy conditions) at the end of Asylum Aftermath. Agent 47's driving skill is also manifested in his ability to drive specialist motor vehicles - such as a bus and a large truck at the end of Amendment XXV and The Meat King's Party, respectively. Agent 47's vehicular skills are not just limited to cars - He is seen flying helicopters and planes, and driving boats numerous times throughout the series.\n\nExpert Mechanic: In addition to his driving intuition, 47 is also a very skilled mechanic. He is able to manipulate objects and machinery around him to his advantage with very little effort.

(in Situs Inversus)\n\nEquipment[]\n\nAgent 47 has shown a preference for certain equipment throughout the series, preferences ingrained into him by his training and then upgrading to more efficient equipment as needed. As the ICA's top assassin, Agent 47 also has access to their highly modular standard issue arsenal.\n\nThere have also been various times where Agent 47 has needed to switch out weapons for certain scenarios. Those situational changes are not included.\n\nFirearms[]\n\nHandguns[]\n\nAMT Hardballer\n\nICA19 (In HITMAN, HITMAN II, and HITMAN III.)\n\nICA19-Chrome (Ditto)\n\nJAGD P22G (In Absolution)\n\nAgency JAGD P22G (In Absolution)\n\n.22 Suppressed (In Silent Assassin and Absolution)\n\nBartoli Custom (In Absolution)\n\nSteiner-Bisley Zenith (In Absolution)\n\nMustang Snub (In Absolution)\n\nSA .44 Auto (In Absolution)\n\nAries Charging Ram (In Absolution)\n\nSniper Rifles[]\n\nBlaser Jagdwaffen R93 Sniper (In Codename 47)\n\nWalther WA2000 Sniper (In All Except Absolution)\n\nSieger 300 (In HITMAN™)\n\nSieger 300 Ghost (In HITMAN™ and HITMAN™ 2 Sniper Assassin))\n\nDragunov SVD (In Silent Assassin and Blood Money)\n\nDruzhina 34 ICA (In HITMAN™ 2 Sniper Assassin)\n\nDruzhina 34 ICA Arctic (In HITMAN™ 2 Sniper Assassin)\n\nKazo TRG (In Absolution)\n\nAgency Kazo TRG (In Sniper Challenge and Absolution)\n\nIlyon R700 (In Absolution)\n\nSubmachine Guns[]\n\nMP5\n\nSMG Tactical (In Blood Money)\n\nAgency Dynamics CPW (In Absolution)\n\nHX UMP (In Absolution)\n\nAgency HX UMP (Absolution)\n\nBronson M1928 (In Absolution)\n\nAssault Rifles[]\n\nM4 (In Blood Money)\n\nAgency ARZ 160 (In Absolution)\n\nSTG 58 (In Absolution)\n\nShotguns[]\n\nSPAS 12 (In Blood Money)\n\nAgency SPS 12 (In Absolution)\n\nM590 12GA (In Absolution)\n\nMelee[]\n\nFiber Wire (All Hitman games)\n\nPentagon Knife/Oyabun Knife (In Codename 47)\n\nSedative Syringe/Poison Syringe (In Blood Money, Absolution, HITMAN™, HITMAN 2 (2018) and HITMAN™ III.)\n\nAnaesthetic (In Silent Assassin)\n\nFolding Knife (In Absolution, HITMAN™, HITMAN 2 (2018) and HITMAN™ III.\n\nBaseball Bat (In Absolution, HITMAN™, HITMAN 2 (2018) and HITMAN™ III.)\n\nOther[]\n\nCoin(s) (In Blood Money and HITMAN™)\n\nRU-AP mines (In Blood Money and HITMAN™)\n\nICA briefcase (In Absolution, HITMAN™, HITMAN 2 (2018) and HITMAN™ III.)\n\nQuotes[]\n\nAlternate Origins (2007 Adaptation)[]\n\nMain article(s): Hitman (movie)\n\nIn the film Hitman, Agent 47 is not a clone, but rather an abducted baby orphan trained to be a lethal assassin. He accepts a contract to kill the Russian president Mikhail Belicoff. He is set up by one of Belicoff's body doubles, who stages Belicoff having survived the incident and tries to kill 47. While on the run with Nika Boronina (the real Belicoff's mistress, a witness whom 47 becomes semi-romantic with), he eventually kills the double and escapes arrest with the help of Agent Smith. He then heads to Russia where he protects Nika and sends her to a wine-yard (she had expressed a liking for it to 47 during her travels with him) where he would later presumably join her. The film is made and set in 2007.\n\nGallery[]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nAgent 47 and Diana Burnwood are the only characters that have appeared in every Hitman video game.\n\nAssuming the Silent Assassin rating and realism of how certain hits were performed, which also includes non-targets, including those seen in cutscenes, Agent 47's canonical kill count throughout the entire series, starting from Codename 47 (excluding Hitman literature), is 459 actual people, 170 \"imaginary people\" (from the Seven Deadly Sins DLC), five guard dogs, one boar, and one canary.[8]\n\nAccording to unused dialogue from Codename 47, Agent 47 is around 5 ft., 10in tall.[9]\n\nAgent 47 is known for his professional and honorable attitude demonstrated in most contracts to avoid attention. However, this trait is not demonstrated when killing Lenny Dexter, as 47 cruelly torments Lenny leading up to and during his death, such as by kidnapping him and forcing him to dig his own grave in the middle of the desert. This is possibly due to Lenny killing Sister Mary, a defenseless nun.\n\nAgent 47 even has the option to submit Lenny to a lonely, drawn-out death by leaving him in the desert with no food or water, and to be picked on by vultures.\n\nAnother is when he kills Clive Skurky, where after 47 mortally wounds him and interrogates him on Victoria's location, he steps on his wounded leg, leaving him to bleed to death.\n\nIn the film Hitman, Agent 47's suits are made by Kiton. In Enemy Within, he wears an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore watch, worth over $10,000.\n\nAccording to his ICA File, Agent 47 has six nationalities: American, British, German, Swiss, and two others that are censored.\n\nAgent 47 loses his temper notably one time in the whole series during the final mission of Blood Money, in which he is stabbed with a poisonous syringe.\n\nThis is also the first (and only) time he uses profanity, where he yells out \"Bitch!\" in pain, towards Diana Burnwood, as a result of the stabbing.\n\nEven though members from Io-Interactive have said that Agent 47 is timeless (\"never aging\"), doing simple subtraction from his birth-date (September 5 1964) to present day in HITMAN™ III (storyline ends in Spring 2021) shows he is actually 56 years old (and 57 in the epilogue, which takes place a year later), and still aging. It is likely his genetic modifications include anti-aging measures in the sense that he does not physically age, but chronologically ages as time passes by.\n\nThis is further evidenced by his GAMA Hospital Patient Journal found in Situs Inversus in which the doctors are astonished by his health, stating that he's physically like a man in his early 20's.\n\nIf the player looks at Agent 47's texture for Contracts, they are able to see the words \"Room for a beat-up face...,\" with two suns and a star in the area, possibly suggesting that Agent 47 was to be captured and/or beat up at some point in the game.\n\n47 is a very talented drummer and keyboard player. Twice in the series, 47 has the opportunity to pose as a band drummer to get closer to his target (Jordan Cross in Club 27, and Rico Delgado in Three-Headed Serpent). Easter Eggs demonstrating 47's keyboard skills can be found during the police chase in Absolution, as well as the HITMAN™ mission Club 27.\n\nIf the player acquires Ort-Meyer's Keycard and goes into a secret room in the asylum, they can see five other clones of Agent 47 that were originally going to belong to each of the Five Fathers for organ donation (as was the original deal between the fathers in Codename 47), all with the names of the Five Fathers printed on the canisters.\n\nAccording to Silent Assassin, Agent 47's religious beliefs appeared to be prominently Catholic, but kept out of religious life when he was forced back into completing assassinations. It is likely that he keeps as many Catholic practices as possible without endangering himself. His contact with Father Emilio Vittorio in Hitman: Enemy Within and Sister Mary in Hitman: Absolution hint that 47 would want to return to religious life, if not for the constraints of his criminal underworld ties.\n\nWith his marksman skills and personality, 47 shares many similarities with the professional hitman \"Golgo 13\" the protagonist of the Japanese manga of the same name.\n\nOnly three of Agent 47’s hits have survived (Diana Burnwood, who he left alive on purpose, Mark Faba, and The Disruptor).\n\nTyping in the password \"420\" into a safe or door in HITMAN III reveals the hidden dialogue, \"Good Party?\". This exact line is used by 47 in the HITMAN II Elusive Target Mission, The Censor. He must speak to The Censor at the garden party to reveal the line.\n\nAlso typing in “69” into a safe or door in HITMAN III reveals a hidden dialogue, “ Ho, Ho, Ho”. Which refers to the seasonal content “Holiday Hoarders” in Paris. This exact line is used when 47 kills a target.\n\nInitially, IOI found Dan Russell to voice 47 in Codename 47 and changed the voice to David Bateson when the tone of the game changed. In Russell's version, 47 would make wisecracks in the cutscenes and after battles. This makes the whole game more like an action movie than a stealth game. Although Russell's voice was replaced by Bateson's, some of his voice remains on the disc.[10]"
