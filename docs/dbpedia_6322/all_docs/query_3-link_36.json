        "text": "Pre-1800's\n\nThe early history of our Bedford Heights community is synonymous with the history of Bedford Township. The Bedford area was once part of the old Western Reserve of Connecticut. The Connecticut Land Company purchased the land in 1795. The area was considered valuable because of lush timber and abundant waterpower. The area had obviously been selected by pioneers who brought with them a value of scholarly heritage as they named areas around Bedford Heights in classical references such as Solon, Aurora and Macedonia. The resource of the Lake Erie and resource off shoots such as Tinkers Creek and the Metro Parks helped identify our region as highly desirable and rich in resources.\n\n1800's\n\nThe first settler, Elijah Nobles, settled near Tinker's Creek at the western edge of the area in 1813. When he fell into debt, Davis Hudson, a relative, sold his a tract of land at the center of Bedford, with the understanding that it would be improved.\n\nOther settlers soon followed. Benjamin Fitch came from Independence in 1815. W. C. Taylor, his son-in-law, founded the Taylor Chair Company. (Property of the historical Taylor Chair Company is on display at the Bedford Historical Museum at Bedford Square.) Daniel Benedict arrived in 1821 and became the first permanent settler of Bedford. He was one of the original trustees of the township and owned a saw mill and a woolen mill on Tinkers Creek and named Bedford for his native Bedford, New York.\n\nBedford Township was formed on April 7, 1823 out of the area we presently know as Bedford, Bedford Heights, Oakwood Village, Maple Heights and Walton Hills. In 1830, Hezekiah Dunham arrived and surveyed the center and boundaries of Bedford. (The Hezekiah Dunham house remains as a historical landmark available for public viewing across the street from Bedford Square.) On March 15, 1837, Bedford became incorporated as a town. The Historical Museum has much of this community heritage for viewing.\n\nThe early Bedford area was mostly agricultural with many dairy farms. Examples in our community are the Laing farm on the ridge and the Forbes family homestead on Forbes Road to name just a few. The early 1900s saw large industry, such as McMyler Interstate and Best Foundry, move in. (Note: Interstate and Best are street names in a common area of the present Bedford community.)\n\n1850 – 1950\n\nMany young men from the Bedford area answered the call to fight for the Union in the Civil War. The soldiers’ monument at Bedford Square provides a tribute to their bravery and conviction to their principles. The American Legion post at the annual Memorial Day Parade reads the names of those who paid the ultimate price in this and other military conflicts each year. The Village of Maple Heights succeeded to form a separate village in 1915. The rest of Bedford Township remained a common community for about 35 more years before it also subdivided to the four communities that comprise our school system of the Cities of Bedford Heights and Bedford and the Villages of Oakwood and Walton Hills.\n\nThe City's Beginning\n\nIn September 1950, 91 residents petitioned the township trustees urging a vote on Bedford Heights becoming an independent village. With the vote opposed by the Bedford Township Civic League, the measure was defeated by a narrow margin, 239-231. A second vote was held on February 20, 1951, and this time the issue passed 244-220. Once an independent village, Bedford Heights elected Robert Willeford as its first mayor, defeating George Burrows. The long battle to keep the village form of government as opposed to being annexed to Bedford was successful with a favorable margin of 258-175 votes.\n\nThe Mayor and Police Chief were noted as uncharacteristically young for their positions, but they had much energy. At the time of the Township's dissolve, Bedford Township had assets totaling $122,962.31. Upon dissolution of the township in 1951, the money was divided between Bedford Heights receiving $39,429.72; Bedford $37,047.72; and Walton Hills $25,447.13. The population of Bedford Heights at this early time was 2,424.\n\nMayor Willeford's term was interrupted with a 2 year term of Mayor Ramsey, 1954-1955. Mayor Ramsey called for creation of new (present) City Hall site. This Mayor's office has recently acquired a land map of homesteads recorded via the Connecticut Land Company which plot properties and family settlements that later named some of our community streets such as Laing, Bartlett, Comstock and Forbes from James Laing (Laing farm).\n\nThe Charter which frames our government was adopted on November 4, 1958. The Charter was designed to transcend the village to city status. In effect, installing a voter approved Charter allows the \"tailor making\" of local government regulations to the specific requirements and needs of the locality, otherwise known as \"home rule.\" Although passed by voters in 1958, the Charter actually took effect in 1960 prior to our city status.\n\nIn planning the new young community, special zoning codes were designed anticipating the creation of the Thompson Research Center. For such innovative planning, the community earned the reputation of being state of the art for business. Although the specific Thompson project never developed, it provided the means for the creation of the strong business community that formulated on the north end of town (Miles, Richmond Roads). The Thompson project was anticipated to locate in the area referred to as the \"Ridge\" (Eldridge, Laing, and Randolph) which was a division of the historic Laing family farmstead.\n\nThe Ridge did not sit idle with the disillusionment of the Thompson Research Center Plan. The Kimberly Housing Development took over with a $5 million dollar initiative, one of the largest planned residential community developments in the history of Ohio at that time. Down payments to receive a lot in this neighborhood cost $20.00 with a monthly payment of $89.00 to $105.00. Buyers had only to determine which of the six models they desired to join the rapid development of 250 pre-fabricated homes ranging from $18,950 to $24,000. The population more than doubled from 2,424 in 1951 to 5,275 in 1960.\n\nConstruction simultaneously sprouted 125 homes with a price from $16,000 to $21,000 in Heather Hill (street area of Cranfield, Comstock, and Fenlake) about where Bartlett meets Rockside and Libby. This mutual development helped the city status evolve in 1961. The presence of multiple high rise apartment complexes at Rockside Road at Perkins near Aurora was once the site of Gene Kunes Golf Course. A fire preceded other development that without a doubt changed our streetscape and community design.\n\nBedford Heights became a city on January 4, 1961. The 1960s were a fast and invigorating time for Bedford Heights. In 1960, the population was 5,275 but grew to 13,063 by 1970. These were the years of the addition of apartment buildings on the Bedford Heights horizon as well as the construction of I-271.\n\nIn 1966, Lucille J. Reed was elected Mayor of Bedford Heights as well as the first woman elected mayor of a city in Cuyahoga County. During her tenure, her administration was successful in acquiring $1.6 million from the federal government for the Reed Park Development (20 acres) off of Eldridge Boulevard. This is the site of our outdoor pool and picnic pavilion.\n\nAs an interesting quirk of culture 1966 was the year Star Trek used as its mantra \"Go where no man has gone before.\" At the same time in Bedford Heights, Lucille Reed went where no woman had gone before as the first female elected mayor in any community of Cuyahoga County. Although she was elected from the Council body with other Councilmen with considerable experience, the first local newspaper articles describing the new mayor focused on what colors she wore and how she did her hair. However, just as Nancy Sinatra's simultaneously popular song \"These Boots Are Made For Walking,\" the Mayor found a significantly bolder presence than the fashion reviews of her first interviews.\n\nBedford Heights also hosted some fame during this era as being the hometown of Cleveland Indians Baseball star rookie pitcher Jim Rittwage. The family lived on Columbus Road until recently. The City's most rapid expansion happened under the Reed administration, must probably as the coincidence of timing, the impact of the freeway and the completion of the several apartment buildings which nearly doubled the population. The present City Hall (1975) and the onset of the many programs that would transpire from here and Reed Park resulted in a long term for Mayor Reed.\n\nDuring the mid-to-late 1970s, the once primarily Italian American community began to find a heavy flow of residents leaving and minorities replacing them in the neighborhoods beyond those located in Metro Estates. The City developed the position of Housing Coordinator designed to assure equal opportunity and witness against illegal practices of steering and redlining. Other groups such as the Bedford Heights Civic Coalition were designed to help the integration go smoothly and responsibly. About this time Mayor Reed decided not to run for Mayor for an additional term of office and passed her support to Councilman Robert Furlong for the position. This was an unsuccessful effort as Jimmy Dimora was elected to the Mayor's position instead (defeating Reed's candidate.)\n\nDimora, like Reed, had a significant tenure in the mayoral position for seventeen years. Unlike Reed, he managed to extend the two year term to four years and characteristically ran unopposed as he ran year to year. Dimora also ran and supported a slate of council members which were to become his team, joining in his opinions and his approach of cooperation and teamwork.\n\nMost notable during Dimora's tenure in office was the creation (1984) and later (1994) expansion of the Bedford Heights Community Center. The Building would later be re-named the Jimmy Dimora Community Center as a tribute to his vision and his stature in the community.\n\nDimora's tenure also called for the first considerable municipal jail expansion, completed in conjunction with Chagrin Falls, Glenwillow and Moreland Hills. It also led to renovation of the outdoor pool, return of K-9 units (for Officers Kalavsky and Hagquist), and creation of a more defined senior and recreation staff amongst other things. The 10 year road repair program was established by Charter, and the acquisition of safety and senior vehicles were prioritized. Dimora ran twice for County Commissioner and was successfully elected in 1998 before he completed the last year of his mayoral term. He had also in the interim been named Chairman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, a position of influence to the state and nation, as well as our region.\n\nAs Dimora moved on to County Commissioner, Council President Debora Mallin was by Charter aligned to fill the mayoral vacancy. During her first year, Mayor Mallin instituted a new communication system for the safety forces, addressed the roof improvements necessary for all City buildings, and addressed repair and renovation needed at Reed Park. She also created many new programs such as the auxiliary police program and others which received \"Best Practices\" publication by the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Mallin was elected to serve in 1999 and again in 2003. Her contributions, trials and energies are amongst other postings on this website.\n\nPerspective As we reflect on some milestones in our community's early development, we thought it might be insightful to post not only what was going on in Bedford Heights but what was happening on the national scene as well. The entries of national reflection, be they Political, entertainment, sports or otherwise referenced are not as the matters of greatest impact but simply listed...for perspective.\n\n1950\n\nIn Bedford Heights, Election to create Bedford Heights as a separate community fails to gain enough votes for passage (to separate from Bedford Township.) The vote on October 2, 1950 failed to pass the proposal on the premise such separation \"would only increase our taxes\".\n\nPolitical, (July 1) U. S. ground forces land in Korea.\n\nMusic, Nat King Cole sings \"Mona Lisa\" Technology, CBS began 1st color broadcast in November. Seeburg Company makes major technological advancement of \"jukeboxes\" to play 45 rpm records, soon to regularly appear in bars, bowling alleys and soda shops.\n\n1951\n\nIn Bedford Heights, Bedford Heights established Robert Willeford 1st Mayor.\n\nDominic Meuti became Chief of Police, a position held until 2001(believed at the time to be the longest serving Chief in the nation.). The initial flash of victory was short-lived as there was an attempt by some residents to annex much of the new village back to the City of Bedford. This matter went to court and a vote of the people to maintain Bedford Heights as a separate community.\n\nPhone numbers for area all began referenced to words instead of numbers. For example Merities Sunoco Station at 24301 Aurora Road had the number \"Bedford 2 9393\" written BE2 -9383. Bedford Heights headquarter for \"Flowers, Plants and Vegetables\" per an advertisement in Bedford Heights Informer was Rugan's Food Market on Aurora at Libby Road.\n\nPolitics, More than 300 Hollywood personalities were implicated as Communists, the majority of them blacklisted.\n\nMovies, Hollywood puts out \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\" Marlon Brando gains fame in \"Streetcar Named Desire\" in which Vivien Leigh is named Best Actress. 17 million Americans now have their own Television sets on which \"I Love Lucy\" is one of the most popular reasons to stay home and watch it. \"Fireside Theater\", \"Colgate Comedy Hour\" and \"Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts\" also top the list.\n\nMusic, \"Rocket 88\" considered by many to be the first actual Rock and Roll song topped the Charts by Jackie Brenson and his Delta Cats, which featured a young Ike Turner at the piano.\n\nNovelty, The first plastic lawn flamingo designed by Don Featherstone is marketed.'\n\n1952\n\nIn Bedford Heights, News of the Village was reported in local newspaper \"Bedford Heights Informer\" later joined by \"The Suburban Newsbeat\" (as well as the \"Bedford Times Register).\n\nNational, UFO sightings reported across the country.

The plastic body was not added until 1964.\n\nPolitical, (11/4) Republican candidate Dwight D. Eisenhower was Elected President over Democrat Adlai E. Stevenson. Both men were popular but Stevenson was believed hurt by inferences of Democratic corruption in the White House. Additionally, Stevenson's reputation as an intellectual was believed to clash with country's anti-intellectual mood.\n\nBusiness, Tired of lack of quality accommodations, Kemmon Wilson opened his first Holiday Inn which rapidly became a success.\n\n1953\n\nIn Bedford Heights, Mayor Robert Willeford, after negotiating with Cleveland Water Department representatives, was successful in acquiring three take-offs from the new water line completed on Northfield Road. This was significant because original plans called for Bedford Heights to go to Maple Heights for water despite the 30\" water main being installed on the Northfield side of the street. A petition drive in the Northfield, Louis, and Norton area hoped to conclude this issue on behalf of the Bedford Heights citizenry.\n\n(3/15) Mayor Robert E. Willeford defended his actions concerning the now famous \"tear gas\" incident at a public Council meeting.\n\nTwenty residents in attendance announced sign truce ending the Korean their intentions of searching the facts and starting proceedings against Williford. Williford had fired a tear gas charge at 35 year old Saul Goldtone of Mantua Corners. Goldstone had to be transported to Marymount Hospital where there was fear he might lose his eye.\n\nGoldstone had been halted by the Mayor who was in the company of Patrolman Walter Scott when he sped by in his red convertible. From the corner of Northfield and Aurora at the speed of 61 mph, the police chase ensued. The first car (Goldstone) was racing away. Williford and Scott caught up with Goldstone who tried to flee after this confrontation. It was at this time the tear gas was shot striking Goldstone in the face. Judge James Cornell freed the Mayor of assault and battery charges. The story received national coverage in Life Magazine. Angry villagers tried to oust the Mayor to which Ohio Governor Frank Lausche said he lacked the power to fire Willeford. The election due at that time had the voters removing him from office in favor of Thomas Ramsey, Jr. to serve as mayor.\n\nNationally, War and Peace - Communist and United Nations delegates War. 54,246 Americans were killed, 103,284 were wounded and 7,955 were reported missing in action.\n\nBusiness, The first franchise with the golden arches (specifically designed to attract passing motorists) was opened in Phoenix, Arizona. \"Speedee\" the original McDonald's mascot lasted until 1960, when the hamburger loving clown Ronald McDonald was introduced.\n\nAcademy Awards, Best Picture \"From Here To Eternity\" while Best Actor goes to William Holden for \"Stalag 17\" and Best Actress to Audrey Hepburn for \"Roman Holiday.\"\n\nTechnology, Cinemascope, the first shot using a wide screen process is viewed in \"The Robe\" (Richard Burton and Jean Simmons), \"Julius Ceasar\" (Marlon Brando James Mason) and \"Calamity Jane\" (Doris Day).\n\nFashion, Bermuda Shorts were the obvious fashion statement as businessmen actually would wear the big baggy shorts during the summer months. Whether combined with suit jackets, dress shirts, ties and knee high socks such garmented gents were making fashion statements.\n\nMusic, Patti Paige sings \"How Much is That Doggy In the Window?\"\n\nMovie Queen, Marilyn Monroe has national attention from among other things her performances in \"Niagara\", \"Gentlemen Prefer Blondes\" and \"How to Marry a Millionaire\".\n\n1954\n\nIn Bedford Heights, Under Mayor Ramsey's tenure, a $675,000 bond was proposed for contracting a sewage system. Food, A 1954 study found that the average American's ideal meal consisted of fruit cup, vegetable soup steak and potato, peas and pie for dessert.\n\n1955\n\nIn Bedford Heights, Although the sewer bond issue was approved 578-303, Mayor Ramsey was defeated by former Mayor Robert Willeford 617-278 in the November 1955 election.\n\nMusic, New York band The Crows flew to the top of the charts in part because of Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed playing \"Sh Boom\".\n\nConstruction, 1,320,000 new homes were built thanks to the baby boom.

The Village Council showed itself to be ahead of the times in electing a lady, Mrs. Mary Szabo, as its President. Mr. Eugene Mould was honored by the Bedford Heights Progressive League as \"Mr. Bedford Heights\". Mr. Mould was honored for his vast contributions to the village recreation program at this time. In order to bring the City in line with state statutes and in keeping with the new charter proposal, the number of councilmen to be elected in the 1959 election was expanded from six to seven. The four candidates with the most votes were to begin four year terms while the three highest vote getters were to serve two year terms with their posts open for re-election in 1961.\n\nThree housing developments simultaneously bring rapid growth to Bedford Heights. They are:\n\n1. Bedford Heights Ridge Estates aka \"The Ridge\" formerly the Laing farm from John Laing's (1857) purchase from the Connecticut Land Company. 2. Kimberly Park housing program and 3. Heather Hill (Comstock, Cannon Millbrook, Fenlake).\n\nThe young community hungry for substance and progressive in initiative had a Bedford Heights Business and Industrial Association of which Ben Sachse served as Chairman, Mary Szabo Secretary, Al Ponyk Treasurer, and Albert Kondik and Dominic Meuti as Board of Directors.\n\nEconomy, As the average American now earns $91.53 a week, he is looking for new ways to spend it.\n\nDespite a 116 day steelworker strike (longest in U.S. history); the U.S. is in good shape thanks to the government's \"Buy American\" campaign.
