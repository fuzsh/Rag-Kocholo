        "text": "When it comes to books, April was a really exciting month for me. I not only made a nice dent into my TBR pile and finished three books, but I also headed down to Tennessee for the annual One More Page Bookclub Retreat. It was so nice to spend a few days away with a group of ladies, having time to relax, and do some reading. For me, my reading highlight for the month was Nora Goes Off Script. It‚Äôs been out for a while but for one reason or another, I haven‚Äôt gotten around to reading it until now. It was so, so good and I can‚Äôt wait to read Annabel Monaghan‚Äôs next book, Same Time Next Summer (out June 6). Two of the other books I read this month were medium (We Were The Lucky Ones and Killers of a Certain Age) but I‚Äôve fully accepted that not all months will be five-star months! Ready fo the reviews? Here‚Äôs what I read in April!\n\nP.S. What I read in March\n\nWhat I Read in April\n\nWE WERE THE LUCKY ONES BY GEORGIA HUNTER\n\nGoodreads Synopsis:\n\nIt is the spring of 1939 and three generations of the Kurc family are doing their best to live normal lives, even as the shadow of war grows closer. The talk around the family Seder table is of new babies and budding romance, not of the increasing hardships threatening Jews in their hometown of Radom, Poland. But soon the horrors overtaking Europe will become inescapable and the Kurcs will be flung to the far corners of the world, each desperately trying to navigate his or her own path to safety.\n\nAs one sibling is forced into exile, another attempts to flee the continent, while others struggle to escape certain death, either by working grueling hours on empty stomachs in the factories of the ghetto or by hiding as gentiles in plain sight. Driven by an unwavering will to survive and by the fear that they may never see one another again, the Kurcs must rely on hope, ingenuity, and inner strength to persevere.\n\nMy Review: This beautifully written story of the author‚Äôs family during World War II is absolutely captivating. During a time when things were so questionable and so many people perished, it was heartwarming to read a story about a family that was separated and was all able to come back together post-war. With that being said, there were several points throughout the book that just drag and I found that it was hard to get too attached to the characters because there were so many of them scattered across the globe. If you‚Äôre looking for a historical fiction that shares a story of survival and love but ends in happiness, give this one a try!\n\nMy Rating: 3/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è\n\nKILLERS OF A CERTAIN AGE BY DEANNA RAYBOURN\n\nGoodreads Synopsis:\n\nBillie, Mary Alice, Helen, and Natalie have worked for the Museum, an elite network of assassins, for forty years. Now their talents are considered old-school and no one appreciates what they have to offer in an age that relies more on technology than people skills.\n\nWhen the foursome is sent on an all-expenses-paid vacation to mark their retirement, they are targeted by one of their own. Only the Board, the top-level members of the Museum, can order the termination of field agents, and the women realize they‚Äôve been marked for death.\n\nNow to get out alive they have to turn against their own organization, relying on experience and each other to get the job done, knowing that working together is the secret to their survival. They‚Äôre about to teach the Board what it really means to be a woman‚Äìand a killer‚Äìof a certain age.\n\nMy Review: In Killers of a Certain Age, we follow four 60-something-year-old women on their assassin retirement cruise when things go awry. The beginning of the book starts out action-packed while still giving us a look behind the curtain of what it‚Äôs like to be an assassin, which I really enjoyed, but I definitely would consider this more of a mystery than a thriller. Nonetheless, following this foursome of friends had me on the edge of my seat at times. Keyword: at times. I definitely think it could have had more depth to it and I felt as though the characters were portrayed as much younger than they really were. This was definitely a book I wanted to like more than I did!\n\nMy Rating: 3.5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èüí´\n\nNORA GOES OFF SCRIPT BY ANNABEL MONAGHAN\n\nGoodreads Synopsis:\n\nNora Hamilton knows the formula for love better than anyone. As a romance channel screenwriter, it‚Äôs her job. But when her too-good-to-work husband leaves her and their two kids, Nora turns her marriage‚Äôs collapse into cash and writes the best script of her life. No one is more surprised than her when it‚Äôs picked up for the big screen and set to film on location at her 100-year-old home. When former Sexiest Man Alive, Leo Vance, is cast as her ne‚Äôer-do-well husband Nora‚Äôs life will never be the same.\n\nThe morning after shooting wraps and the crew leaves, Nora finds Leo on her porch with a half-empty bottle of tequila and a proposition. He‚Äôll pay a thousand dollars a day to stay for a week. The extra seven grand would give Nora breathing room, but it‚Äôs the need in his eyes that makes her say yes. Seven days: it‚Äôs the blink of an eye or an eternity depending on how you look at it. Enough time to fall in love. Enough time to break your heart.\n\nFilled with warmth, wit, and wisdom, Nora Goes Off Script is the best kind of love story‚Äìthe real kind where love is complicated by work, kids, and the emotional baggage that comes with life. For Nora and Leo, this kind of love is bigger than the big screen.\n\nMy Review: You know those books that everyone talks about and recommends but you never get around to reading? That was Nora Goes Off Script for me. I enjoyed every single second of it and have no idea what took me so long to read it! After a recent divorce, we follow Nora (a romance movie writer) after she writes a killer script that reflects her relationship with her now ex-husband. It‚Äôs so good, it gets turned into a big-time movie that helps her get out of debt. I loved learning about Nora, the mundanity of her life, and watching her blossom into this new, badass version of herself. Some parts of this book definitely felt a little rushed and not as well thought out as they could have, but overall, I was sucked in and did not want to put this book down at all. AND THE TROPE! It was so good.\n\nMy Rating: 5/5 ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è"
