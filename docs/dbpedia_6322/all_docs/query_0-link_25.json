Hell Razah 60 Second Assassin %26 Father Lord Lyrics\n\nThe suns of man-sion, has been opened up\n\nThe door is open, yeah, yeah\n\nIt's like, beware of bio chips, I share hits\n\nHarder than slave whips like I waited to get tips\n\nFrom Egypts to sea ships, to bein' chased by new york\n\nCops out the precincts, and words was bricks\n\nWe buildin' projects to pyramids, evil kid\n\nI destroy your ass like London bridge, smoke trees of weed\n\nTake off the leaves out the twigs, pure truth is what I got to give A lot to live for, you ain't rich before poor\n\nIt ain't peace without poor, how would stand without a floor\n\nUnder, over, toxicated, sober\n\nYounger, older you're elevated, higher than a empire state\n\nElevators I roll with creators and creamators\n\nStalkin' through this nature, the heaven raise ya\n\nCapacity in your brains beyond the clouds of rain\n\nSeven and a half are contained\n\nSpace was my birthplace, meditate in cocoons\n\nNow see snakes in human costumes\n\nExpand your mind\n\nExpand your mind\n\nExpand your mind\n\nExpand your mind\n\nIn time, in time\n\nCall this, the blind man talk, cripple man walk\n\nSee nor hear not summon as lord\n\nDivident per segment def unseen beings\n\nSpeak no evil to all I see, tappin into the\n\nWorlds vision with the proper rhythmic meditation\n\nSituation on lives from state to state\n\nRent to pay, state debate, contract dates\n\nCheddar in error, slave mental death to the treasure\n\nWashing my robe in the blood of the lamb, constant plan\n\nNever strayin' new york cause I rock supreme forever for I can never\n\n? blackring on the ? axe spring the ghetto compact\n\nPut em on tracks, and let's see how they act as the aftermath\n\nIncrease accelerate the sun behind you radiate, to burn to ashes\n\nAin't one of the parties you been crashing\n\nBring the beat and I'm a slash it\n\nMy niggas make sure the doors have been barricaded\n\nIt's about to sign off, some shit you can read in ? block spin?\n\nBut make no mistake, devil players, penetrate with your smarts\n\nRedrum mania reincarnate to another shape\n\nBomb flashes, what can happen, new jack-in\n\nYour rappin' ain't the magnum so when he cought up to half these\n\nNiggaz even stole the soul of the streets in motion\n\nExpand your mind\n\nSeek and you shall find\n\nWalkin through the penile glands, like it was a unfathered man\n\nKnowledge is the key to the mind which is a mysterious doorway\n\nThrough a long dark hallway\n\nUse your conscious as a compass to avoid bein' conquered\n\nBy nonsense, use your subconscious as a map\n\nOnce it's time to head back use your food for thought\n\nAnd leave bread tracks\n\nNow we can see the third eye, swift as you burn fly\n\nYou need common sense as a detour\n\nUp ahead there lies three doors for you to see more\n\nYou might have to meditate to the soft melodies from a keyboard\n\nUnderstandin' is your flashlight\n\nIt reflects the windows to your past life\n\nNo psychiatric's could raid you from off the mattress\n\nAs you fall deeper, and it's hypnotized you better read my lips\n\nCause that's the guide, out the hallways of negative\n\nWhich is always competitive, therefore\n\nYou must never let it live\n\nSeek and you shall find\n\nExpand the mind, seek and you shall find\n\nExpand your mind, seek and you shall find\n\nExpand the mind\n\nSeek and you shall find\n\nExpand the mind\n\nSeek and you shall find\n\nExpand the mind\n\nSeek and you shall find\n\nExpand the mind\n\nLyrics Â© Universal Music Publishing Group\n\nWritten by: CLIFFORD SMITH, PETE CUFFIE, SELWYN DAJUAN BOUGARD, WALTER REED\n\nLyrics Licensed & Provided by LyricFind"
