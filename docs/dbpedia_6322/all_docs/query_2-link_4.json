The Connecticut House of Representatives was in session. And as some men fell down in the darkened chamber and others clamored for an immediate adjournment, the Speaker of the House, one Colonel Daveport, came to his feet. And he silenced the din with these words: \"The Day of Judgment is either approaching or it is not. If it is not, there is no cause for adjournment. If it is, I choose to be found doing my duty. I wish, therefore, that candles may be brought.\"\n\nFrom Dante's Inferno.\n\nSports: Golf, Sailing, Swimming, Tennis\n\nFuneral:\n\nAfter Action Report\n\nCasket Information: President Kennedy had two caskets.
