        "text": "Green Day kicked off their Saviours Tour in New York this week, and it was something to \"Marvel\" at! WRRV was giving away tickets to this show to lucky listeners in the Hudson Valley. Congrats to Eileen, Natalie, Heather, Frankie, Anthony, and William for winning tickets to see Green Day live! We hope you enjoyed it! Besides being joined bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid, and The Linda Lindas, Green Day was also accompanied by a couple of major superheroes.\n\nGreen Day Launches Their Saviours Tour at Citi Field in New York City\n\nAn incredible group of bands came together to put on a once-in-a-lifetime concert event this passed Monday. To celebrate the anniversaries of the iconic albums Dookie and American Idiot, Green Day has hit the road with The Saviors Tour North American Tour - with a kick-off concert on August 5th at Citi Field in NYC. They were joined by the Smashing Pumpkins, another legendary band of the alternative rock genre. Rancid and The Linda Lindas will also be there to complete the jam-packed line-up. Green Day's NYC kick-off was anticipated to be one of the most anticipated concerts of the the summer!\n\nDookie was Green Days' major-label debut album, since before that they had been signed to an independent record label where they enjoyed moderate success in the underground punk music scene around the East Bay of California. It became a huge hit, and with the help of MTV playing songs like \"Basket Case\" and \"When I Come Around\", they were stars.\n\nAfter a few years of releasing more albums with varying success, they put out the album American Idiot in 2004, which exploded in popularity. It was labeled a punk rock opera, and its songs created a story told throughout the album. It reached number one on the Billboard, won Rock Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards, and was later adapted into a hit Broadway musical.\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine Make a Cameo at Green Day's NYC Concert\n\nApparently Deadpool & Wolverine are fans of Green Day. Or should I say, Tre Cool and Mike Dirnt are fans of Deadpool & Wolverine. While Billie Joe Armstrong is closing out the concert while doing a solo acoustic rendition of \"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)\" the band's drummer and bassist come out in superhero costumes, with Tre as Deadpool and Mike as Wolverine.\n\nBy watching the video, it's safe to say that Billie Joe had no idea that his bandmates were going to do this. It was nearly impossible for him to control this laughter.\n\n@greendayitaly Billie Joe Armstrong of Green Day teams up with Deadpool ( aka Tré Cool ) and Wolverine ( aka Mike Dirnt) —rockstars by day, superheroes by night!. #greenday #billiejoearmstrong #trecool #mikedirnt ♬ suono originale - Green Day Italy\n\nRead More: Celebrate Deadpool & Wolverine at X-Mansion in Westchester County\n\nDeadpool & Wolverine, which came out this Friday, July 26th, sees the return of Hugh Jackman playing the titular Wolverine. Jackman has been portraying Wolverine since 2000 with Fox's X-Men, and it was assumed he would retire the character after 2017's Logan. Well, Ryan Reynolds has his ways, and both he and Jackman will be portraying two of their most notable roles for Deadpool's 3rd installment and introduction into the MCU.\n\nWith all the X-Men love happening, wouldn't it be great to fully immerse yourself in the life of your favorite alphabet related superhero team? You can actually stay a show-accurate X-Mansion in Westchester County, New York thanks to Airbnb!\n\nThis X-Mansion isn't far from where the mansion in the show is supposed to be. The X-Mansion, in the show, is located near Salem Center in Westchester County. This recreation by Airbnb is located in New Castle, New York, only about 20 minutes away from it's fictional version.\n\nThe pictures you are about to see below are not renderings! Believe it or not, these are real photos. They were actually able to make this house look like you're stepping into the cartoon!"
