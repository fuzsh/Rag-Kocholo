Trump at the rally in Butler, Pa., when the shooting started. Mr. Mills kept his finger on the shutter button, photographing as the scene unfolded. It was only afterward, while reviewing his photos, that he realized he had captured the apparent path of a bullet used in the assassination attempt against the former president. He explains what he saw.",
