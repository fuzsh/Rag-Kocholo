        "text": "Salomon Dancehaul Review\n\nBased on the hard to find Max Buri Pro, the Dancehaul is a shorter, wide width, tapered all-mountain board that does a bit of everything well. I really liked how it turned on groomed runs, and had solid edge hold while still feeling playful.\n\nThis is an update to the original review, which was based on riding it at demo days earlier in 2020. I did quite like it, enough that I bought it for the southern hemisphere season. Now I have spent much more time on it, in varied conditions that give me a much better overall picture of how it rides.\n\nhow the dancehaul rides\n\nFeatures of the Salomon Dancehaul\n\nTapererd Directional\n\nThe Dancehaul has a tapered shape, that means that the width of the tail is narrower than the width of the nose. It helps in a couple of areas, the wider nose helps float in powder, as well as making the start of turns smooth and easy.\n\nMedium Flex\n\nA flex that is right in the middle, with enough support to handle fast riding on rough terrain, but with enough flex that you can butter and move it around, without feeling like you are stuck on a plank. After a season of riding it, it is well broken in now, so it would be just a touch softer than it was when the board was brand new.\n\nRock Out Camber\n\nOne of Salomon’s most popular camber profiles, overall it has a traditional camber profile, but with a flat section between your feet, and rocker on the nose and tail. The rocker sections help to give the board extra float, and make it a little more forgiving, while the camber makes sure it is still stable and poppy. There is a good reason that this profile is used on the Villain, Sleepwalker and Assassin, it works for everything.\n\nSintered Base\n\nA hard and fast material, that soaks up wax well and keep the board moving quickly. I didn’t ever run into any noticable issues with speed on the board, even if I rode it for a bit too long between waxes. If you keep it maintained there won’t be anything to complain about. They use a flip flop or opposite bases, so one board will have a mostly black base, while the next one will be mostly white. Mine was mostly white, so it does end up with plenty of marks if you ride it in the park, though they are easy to clean off if you care about things like that.\n\nGhost Basalt Stringers\n\nBasalt stringers that run down the length of the board, adding stability and pop.\n\nPopster\n\nCore profiling, that varies thick and thin sections of the core for a more natural flex and pop.\n\nAspen SLCT Core\n\nFSC certified wood, that is chosen to get a mix between keeping the board lightweight,\n\nABS Sidewall\n\nFine Stone Finish\n\nA stone ground finish on the base, which helps the board to glide smoothly over snow.\n\nAll Mountain Edge Bevel\n\nOverall the board has a 1 degree base bevel, that changes into a 2 degree angle between your feet.\n\nTaper\n\nThere is 12mm of taper on the Dancehaul, which means that the nose is 12mm wider than the tail. Taper helps the board turn smoothly, and helps the nose float and the tail sink in deeper snow.\n\n4×2 Inserts\n\nJust regular bindings inserts, that you can mount all normal bindings to.\n\nBA MD Fiber Glass\n\nSizes available:\n\n143cm\n\n147cm\n\n152cm\n\n157cm\n\nHow it Rides\n\nBoard size: 147\n\nBoots: Salomon Launch Boa SJ 27.5\n\nBindings: Burton Cartel / Burton Step On X\n\nThis review is based on me riding the 2021 147cm Dancehaul, set up with my regular Cartels at angles of +12 and -9, with a stance width of just under 22 inches. I am 6 foot tall, and weigh 160lbs/72kg.\n\nWhen I originally tested this board out, the conditions were quite good – firm groomers that gave good grip, as well as a little fresh snow that had blown in overnight, as well as a bit of powder up on the top of the mountain. Since buying the board and then riding in Australia, I have ridden it in the full range of conditions – light and heavy powder, ice and warm slush.\n\nAlthough I tested out the 147 in Canada, I did think quite hard when it came to buying it – whether or not I should go for the 147cm that I knew, or move up to the 152. The 152 seemed like a more logical choice, it was closer to the length that I normally rode, but I had also bought/rode the Ride Warpig/Superpig both in the small (148cm) size and knew that they did well for my weight.\n\nThere is quite a bit of a difference between the two sizes, but the 147 still has a decent waist width for my boots at 255mm, while the 152 has a big jump to 264mm. With that extra 9mm of width, I imagine that the edge to edge speed of the 152 would make it a notch slower. I ended up just going with the 147, because it was the size that I had tested and knew I liked, and I was right in the center of their recommended weight range.\n\nCamber Profile\n\nThe Rock Out Camber is used on probably the majority of Salomon boards, and there is a good reason for it. It is a good mix between rocker and camber, that is ideal for a lot of riding styles terrain. There is enough camber to still give it a bit of the traditional feel, that is still solid at higher speeds and poppy/snappy. The rocker sections help to make the start of turns smooth and easy, give it some more float in powder and let you be a bit messy and rough without it wanting to catch an edge.\n\nFlex and Pop\n\nThe medium flex with the Rock Out Camber is a pretty good mix. It feels easy to move around at slow speed, but is still quite stable when you are riding fast. It has quite a snappy feel, so it doesn’t take much effort to get a good pop out of the board. Presses on rails and tubes don’t take a huge amount of effort, but I am not good at them anyway so mine never look that nice.\n\nEdge Hold\n\nI have ridden quite a few Salomon boards with the Rock Out Camber profile before, so I had a good idea of what to expect. Especially with sharp and brand new edges, it grips very well even on hard and windblown snow.\n\nBecause I ended up using the Dancehaul as my board for everything, I did detune between the feet so that I wouldn’t catch on any rails in the park. I took enough off them that I would feel safe and it never gripped, though I did expect a bit lower grip when the snow was icy. My stance is fairly narrow, so the amount I detuned wasn’t huge, and I was a little surprised that it still had quite good hold on windblown Australian ice in some pretty bad conditions.\n\nFloat\n\nThere is 12mm of taper in the Dancehaul, and combined with the wider width make up for the shorter length, and it doesn’t have any problem floating in deeper snow. It naturally floats without effort, and even when I was riding in heavier Australian snow I didn’t feel like my back leg was ever getting tired trying to keep the board up. It always has a very easy and surfy feel.\n\nSpeed\n\nIt has their sintered base, so if you keep it waxed you won’t have any problems keeping your speed up.\n\nTurns\n\nProbably the best part of this board, it makes turning fun. With enough camber, a good medium flex and taper if makes turns very very easy and any speed. Even in deep snow in tighter trees, it feels very nimble and quick to move around.\n\nPros:\n\nLightweight\n\nFun\n\nGood medium flex\n\nSolid camber feel\n\nCons\n\nNothing major that gave me any problems, I really liked the Dancehaul.\n\nOverall\n\nThe Dancehaul is one of the boards I have had the most fun on. It is good to cruise around on, holds a good edge and carves well on groomed runs, floats in powder and can still hold up for more aggressive riding. Even with the tapered directional shape, it is still fun in the park and riding switch is still do-able.\n\nFor what you get for the price, I think it is a pretty easy choice.\n\nSimilar boards:\n\nRide Superpig\n\nAlthough on paper they might seem quite close (short, wide, taper) the Superpig has quite a different ride, the camber profile is way more aggressive – so the edge hold and pop are better, but the forgiveness and ability to mess around are almost completely gone.\n\nRide Warpig\n\nShort and wide, though the flat to rocker profile won’t feel as lively as the Dancehaul.\n\nNitro Slash\n\nSalomon Dancehaul Pro\n\nAn upgraded version of the Dancehaul, that has a stiffer flex, fancier sidewalls and a faster base. Currently there is one limited version, though not in many shops.\n\nSalomon Dancehaul Technical Specs\n\nPrevious Season Graphics"
