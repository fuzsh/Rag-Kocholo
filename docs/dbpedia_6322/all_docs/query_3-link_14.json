        "text": "Do you want to write a short film but need help finding compelling concepts? Sometimes reading simple story prompts is the easiest way to get those creative juices flowing.\n\nWe get our ideas from many sources — news headlines, novels, television shows, movies, our lives, our fears, our phobias, etc. They can come from a scene or moment in a film that wasn’t fully explored. They can come from a single visual that entices the creative mind — a seed that continues to grow and grow until the writer is forced to finally put it to paper or screen.\n\nThey may inspire screenplays, novels, short stories, or even smaller moments that you can include in what stories you are already writing.\n\nKeys to Writing Short Film Scripts?\n\nBefore we jump into our 101 Short Film Prompts, let's quickly go over a couple of important factors of writing short film scripts.\n\nConcept is Everything\n\nThe rite of passage for any filmmaker is making a compelling short film. That is where filmmakers cut their teeth and truly come of age. It's also an epic journey through the highest of peaks and deepest of valleys as novice filmmakers quickly learn that it's not as easy as just having a few people, a boom mic, and a camera — you need a great concept.\n\nShowcasing a talking heads short film isn't going to get you noticed by audiences or industry insiders. You need to capture their attention with compelling and engaging narratives that have a beginning, middle, and end within the short film running time of 40 minutes or less (you generally want to stick with 5-20 minutes most of the time).\n\nEconomize Your Storytelling\n\nShort films should also focus on smaller story windows.\n\nInstead of having your short film tell the dramatic story of your alcoholic character trying to go sober over the course of a year, why not focus on the last day of the last step in their 12-Step program?\n\nInstead of having your short script tell the epic story of a historical World War II battle, why not focus on one soldier as they deal with the overarching conflict?\n\nInstead of having your short story tell the horrifying story of a serial killer stalking and killing multiple victims, why not center the story on a single victim in their house watching the news reports of the killings and then hearing a floorboard creak from above?\n\nWatch Short Films\n\nIt's as simple as that — watch short films. Here are 10 shorts you can watch online right now to get you started.\n\n(And read a short film script if you can get your hands on one.)\n\nNote: Because we’re all connected to the same pop culture, news headlines, and inspirations, any similarity to any past, present, or future screenplays, novels, short stories, television pilots, television series, plays, or any other creative works is purely coincidence. These true story writing prompts were conceived on the fly or were based on finding interesting true stories that are out there. While some may have proven to be told already, there are always alternative storylines not covered in what has already been written and produced.\n\n101 Story Prompts to Kickstart Your Short Film\n\n1.
