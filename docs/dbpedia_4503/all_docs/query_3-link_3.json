        "text": "Joan Crawford was born Lucille Fay LeSueur on March 23, 1906, in San Antonio, Texas, to Anna Belle (Johnson) and Thomas E. LeSueur, a laundry laborer. By the time she was born, her parents had separated, and by the time she was a teenager, she'd had three stepfathers. It wasn't an easy life; Crawford worked a variety of menial jobs. She was a good dancer, though, and -- perhaps seeing dance as her ticket to a career in show business -- she entered several contests, one of which landed her a spot in a chorus line. Before long, she was dancing in big Midwestern and East Coast cities. After almost two years, she packed her bags and moved to Hollywood. Crawford was determined to succeed, and shortly after arriving she got her first bit part, as a showgirl in Pretty Ladies (1925).\n\nThree films quickly followed; although the roles weren't much to speak of, she continued toiling. Throughout 1927 and early 1928, she was cast in small parts, but that ended with the role of Diana Medford in Verkaufte Töchter (1928), which elevated her to star status. Crawford had cleared the first big hurdle; now came the second, in the form of talkies. Many stars of the silents saw their careers evaporate, either because their voices weren't particularly pleasant or because their voices, pleasing enough, didn't match the public's expectations (for example, some fans felt that John Gilbert's tenor didn't quite match his very masculine persona). But Crawford wasn't felled by sound. Her first talkie, Untamed (1929), was a success. As the 1930s progressed, Crawford became one of the biggest stars at MGM. She was in top form in films such as Menschen im Hotel (1932), Sadie McKee (1934), Schluss mit den Frauen (1935), and Liebe mit 100 PS (1936); movie patrons were enthralled, and studio executives were satisfied.\n\nBy the early 1940s, MGM was no longer giving her plum roles; newcomers had arrived in Hollywood, and the public wanted to see them. Crawford left MGM for rival Warner Bros., and in 1945 she landed the role of a lifetime. Solange ein Herz schlägt (1945) gave her an opportunity to show her range as an actress, and her performance as a woman driven to give her daughter everything garnered Crawford her first, and only, Oscar for Best Actress. The following year she appeared with John Garfield in the well-received Humoreske (1946). In 1947, she appeared as Louise Graham in Hemmungslose Liebe (1947); again she was nominated for a Best Actress from the Academy, but she lost to Loretta Young in Die Farmerstochter (1947). Crawford continued to choose her roles carefully, and in 1952 she was nominated for a third time, for her depiction of Myra Hudson in Maskierte Herzen (1952). This time the coveted Oscar went to Shirley Booth, for Kehr zurück, kleine Sheba (1952). Crawford's career slowed after that; she appeared in minor roles until 1962, when she and Bette Davis co-starred in Was geschah wirklich mit Baby Jane? (1962). Their longstanding rivalry may have helped fuel their phenomenally vitriolic and well-received performances. (Earlier in their careers, Davis said of Crawford, \"She's slept with every male star at MGM except Lassie\", and Crawford said of Davis, \"I don't hate [her] even though the press wants me to. I resent her. I don't see how she built a career out of a set of mannerisms instead of real acting ability. Take away the pop eyes, the cigarette, and those funny clipped words, and what have you got? She's phony, but I guess the public really likes that.\")\n\nCrawford's final appearance on the silver screen was in the flop Das Ungeheuer (1970). Turning to vodka more and more, she was hardly seen afterward. On May 10, 1977, Joan died of a heart attack in New York City. She was 71 years old. She had disinherited her adopted daughter Christina and son Christopher; the former wrote a tell-all book called \"Mommie Dearest\", The Sixth Sense published in 1978. The book cast Crawford in a negative light and was cause for much debate, particularly among her friends and acquaintances, including Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Crawford's first husband. (In 1981, Faye Dunaway starred in Meine liebe Rabenmutter (1981) which did well at the box office.) Crawford is interred in the same mausoleum as fellow MGM star Judy Garland, in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.\n\nStylish, slender-framed, raven-haired Daliah Lavi was made for alluring, exotic types and princess roles with her mesmerizing beauty, chiseled cheek bones and long, flowing mane. The Israeli actress first became a star in Europe before making a dent in Hollywood as part of a wave of knockout foreign star imports that flooded Hollywood during the mid 1960s -- Claudia Cardinale, Julie Christie, Jeanne Moreau, Liv Ullmann, Melina Mercouri, Ursula Andress, Jacqueline Bisset, Romy Schneider, Elke Sommer, Senta Berger, Rosanna Schiaffino, Geneviève Bujold, Capucine, Shirley Eaton, Sylva Koscina, Barbara Bouchet, Susannah York, Rita Tushingham, Monica Vitti, Vanessa Redgrave and her sister Lynn Redgrave, and Catherine Deneuve and her sister Françoise Dorléac. Like most of the others, Daliah was to be viewed as a viable sex symbol contender. In her case, she found decorative, second-tier notice via tongue-in-cheek spy spoofs, crime mysteries, erotic thrillers and rugged adventures. In retrospect, she may have fallen short of the illustrious Hollywood pedestal, but she did create a fine, if brief, stir.\n\nShe was born Daliah Levenbuch in the Moshav Shavey Zion, in the British Mandate of Palestine on October 12, 1942. The daughter of Reuben and Ruth Lewinbuk (or Levenbuch), who were of German-Jewish and Polish-Jewish descent, she was sent as a child to Stockholm, Sweden in the early 1950s to train in dance. She made her first film there at age 13 in the drama Hemsöborna (1955) playing the daughter of a professor. Her start in films was interrupted when she returned to Israeli following her father's death and joined the Israeli Army.\n\nFollowing this period, she returned to acting and, being fluent in many European languages, began to figure in prominently with a host of French, Italian, German and English productions, often as a co-star. Such early films include a starring role in the German/Israeli co-production Brennender Sand (1960); the classic Voltaire comedy Candide oder der Optimismus im 20. Jahrhundert (1960) co-starring as Cunegonde alongside Jean-Pierre Cassel in the title role; and the Martine Carol drama Eines Abends am Strand (1961). She continued to build up a strong European film reputation with the war drama Bevor der Mensch zum Teufel geht (1961) co-starring Peter van Eyck; the mystery crime Im Stahlnetz des Dr. Mabuse (1961) starring Gert Fröbe and post-Tarzan Lex Barker; and made her American movie debut (earning a Golden Globe \"Newcomer\" Award in the process) as the second femme lead in the Kirk Douglas starer Zwei Wochen in einer anderen Stadt (1962), directed by Vincente Minnelli.\n\nDaliah gained considerable ground enhancing and beautifying such foreign movie product as the ensemble French crime mystery Mitternachtsparty (1961) (aka The Game of Truth); the German comedy satire Das schwarz-weiß-rote Himmelbett (1962); the title role of a sultry peasant girl accused of being a witch in the Italian/French co-production Il demonio (1963) (aka The Demon); the European western action film Old Shatterhand (1964) starring U.S. imports Lex Barker and Guy Madison; the continental costumed adventure Cyrano und D'Artagnan (1964) starring José Ferrer and Jean-Pierre Cassel as Cyrano and D'Artagnan; the German comedy thriller DM-Killer (1965) starring Curd Jürgens, and the one of the ensemble suspects in the internationally cast whodunit Geheimnis im blauen Schloß (1965).\n\nThe actress hit her height of international popularity with four popular English/US-based films: as \"The Girl\" in the epic adventure Lord Jim (1965) starring Peter O'Toole and James Mason; as Princess Natasha in the spy comedy Der Spion mit der kalten Nase (1966) opposite Laurence Harvey; an alluring double agent in the first Matt Helm entry The Silencers (1966) starring Dean Martin; and as a sexy enemy weapon in the phantasmagorical Bondian spoof Casino Royale (1967), starring Peter Sellers and an all-star international cast. The last-mentioned film, in particular, had American male audiences taking major notice.\n\nDecked out in tight mini-skirts, thigh-high go-go boots and a helmet of black hair, Daliah fit in perfectly with the times, a swinging, gorgeous chick of the psychedelic 60s. She quickly lost momentum, however, cast in such overlooked films as Tolldreiste Kerle in rasselnden Raketen (1967), Der Haftbefehl (1968) and Some Girls Do (1969). Her final film would be in the western comedy Catlow - Leben ums Verrecken (1971) starring Yul Brynner.\n\nIn the 1970s Daliah pursued a singing career in Germany after being discovered by record producer Jimmy Bowien. A popular draw, she had a few hit songs and covered many international songwriters and artists. She was also glimpsed again on German television in the 90s for a brief spell. Daliah died on May 3, 2017, in North Carolina. Her fourth husband of 40 years, Charles Gans, survived her, along with four children, including her son Alex Gans who follow in her footsteps in film as a film editor, producer and director.\n\nCleft-chinned, steely-eyed and virile star of international cinema who rose from being \"the ragman's son\" (the name of his best-selling 1988 autobiography) to become a bona fide superstar, Kirk Douglas, also known as Issur Danielovitch Demsky, was born on December 9, 1916 in Amsterdam, New York. His parents, Bryna (Sanglel) and Herschel Danielovitch, were Jewish immigrants from Chavusy, Mahilyow Voblast (now in Belarus). Although growing up in a poor ghetto, Douglas was a fine student and a keen athlete and wrestled competitively during his time at St. Lawrence University. Professional wrestling helped pay for his studies as did working on the side as a waiter and a bellboy. However, he soon identified an acting scholarship as a way out of his meager existence, and was sufficiently talented to gain entry into the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He made his Broadway debut in \"Spring Again\" before his career was interrupted by World War II. He joining the United States Navy in 1941, and then after the end of hostilities in 1945, returned to the theater and some radio work. On the insistence of ex-classmate Lauren Bacall, movie producer Hal B. Wallis screen-tested Douglas and cast him in the lead role in Die seltsame Liebe der Martha Ivers (1946). His performance received rave reviews and further work quickly followed, including an appearance in the low-key drama 14 Jahre Sing-Sing (1947), the first time he worked alongside fellow future screen legend Burt Lancaster. Such was the strong chemistry between the two that they appeared in seven films together, including the dynamic western Zwei rechnen ab (1957), the John Frankenheimer political thriller Sieben Tage im Mai (1964) and their final pairing in the gangster comedy Archie und Harry - Sie können's nicht lassen (1986). Douglas once said about his good friend: \"I've finally gotten away from Burt Lancaster. My luck has changed for the better. I've got nice-looking girls in my films now.\"\n\nAfter appearing in \"I Walk Alone,\" Douglas scored his first Oscar nomination playing the untrustworthy and opportunistic boxer Midge Kelly in the gripping Zwischen Frauen und Seilen (1949). The quality of his work continued to garner the attention of critics and he was again nominated for Oscars for his role as a film producer in Stadt der Illusionen (1952) and as tortured painter Vincent van Gogh in Vincent van Gogh - Ein Leben in Leidenschaft (1956), both directed by Vincente Minnelli. In 1955, Douglas launched his own production company, Bryna Productions, the company behind two pivotal film roles in his career. The first was as French army officer Col. Dax in director Stanley Kubrick's brilliant anti-war epic Wege zum Ruhm (1957). Douglas reunited with Kubrick for yet another epic, the magnificent Spartacus (1960). The film also marked a key turning point in the life of screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who had been blacklisted during the McCarthy \"Red Scare\" hysteria in the 1950s. At Douglas' insistence, Trumbo was given on-screen credit for his contributions, which began the dissolution of the infamous blacklisting policies begun almost a decade previously that had destroyed so many careers and lives.\n\nDouglas remained busy throughout the 1960s, starring in many films. He played a rebellious modern-day cowboy in Einsam sind die Tapferen (1962), acted alongside John Wayne in the World War II story Erster Sieg (1965), again with The Duke in a drama about the Israeli fight for independence, Der Schatten des Giganten (1966), and once more with Wayne in the tongue-in-cheek western Die Gewaltigen (1967). Additionally in 1963, he starred in an onstage production of Ken Kesey's \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" but despite his keen interest, no Hollywood studio could be convinced to bring the story to the screen. However, the rights remained with the Douglas clan, and Kirk's talented son Michael Douglas finally filmed the tale in 1975, starring Jack Nicholson. Into the 1970s, Douglas wasn't as busy as previous years; however, he starred in some unusual vehicles, including alongside a young Arnold Schwarzenegger in the loopy western comedy Kaktus Jack (1979), then with Farrah Fawcett in the sci-fi thriller Saturn-City (1980) and then he traveled to Australia for the horse opera/drama Snowy River (1982).\n\nUnknown to many, Kirk has long been involved in humanitarian causes and has been a Goodwill Ambassador for the US State Department since 1963. His efforts were rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom (1981), and with the Jefferson Award (1983). Furthermore, the French honored him with the Chevalier of the Legion of Honor. More recognition followed for his work with the American Cinema Award (1987), the German Golden Kamera Award (1987), The National Board of Reviews Career Achievement Award (1989), an honorary Academy Award (1995), Recipient of the American Film Institute's Lifetime Achievement Award (1999) and the UCLA Medal of Honor (2002). Despite a helicopter crash and a stroke suffered in the 1990s, he remained active and continued to appear in front of the camera. Until his passing on February 5 2020 at the age of 103, he and Olivia de Havilland were the last surviving major stars from the Golden Years of Hollywood.\n\nThe great San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906 was a tragedy for Mervyn LeRoy. While he and his father managed to survive, they lost everything they had. To make money, LeRoy sold newspapers and entered talent contests as a singer. When he entered vaudeville, his act was \"LeRoy and Cooper--Two Kids and a Piano\". After the act broke up he contacted his cousin, Jesse L. Lasky, and went to work in Hollywood. He worked in the costume department, the film lab and as a camera assistant before becoming a comedy gag writer and part-time actor in silent films. His next step was as a director, and his first effort was No Place to Go (1927). He scored an unqualified hit with Harold Teen (1928). Earning $1,000 per week by the end of that year, he was nicknamed \"The Boy Wonder\" of Warner Bros., where his pictures were profitable lightweights. His motto, to paraphrase William Shakespeare, was \"Good stories make good movies.\" LeRoy rounded out the decade assigned to more lightweights, such as Naughty Baby (1928) (his first talkie), Hot Stuff (1929), Little Johnny Jones (1929) and a primitive but rather inventive musical talkie, Broadway Babies (1929), all of which proved that he was equally adept at constructing a musical as any other genre he worked in.\n\nIn the depths of the Depression there was considerable disagreement within the studio on whether audiences wanted escapism or stories addressing issues pertaining to the stark realities of the day. LeRoy sided with studio exec Darryl F. Zanuck's tilt toward realism and threw himself into his next assignment--Der kleine Cäsar (1931). This smash hit started the gangster craze and LeRoy gained a reputation as a top dramatic director (although his follow-up assignment was Show Girl in Hollywood (1930)). During the 1930s several of his films dealt with social issues, usually through the eyes of the underdog, the best example of that being Ich bin ein entflohener Kettensträfling (1932). However, as one of Warner's war horses in its stable of contract directors, he was also assigned more digestible fare. He followed his landmark gangster picture with Goldgräber von 1933 (1933), although it could be argued that it also contained a remarkable degree of social consciousness. Upon the death of Irving Thalberg LeRoy was picked as head of production at MGM. He produced (and partly directed, without credit) that studio's classic Das zauberhafte Land (1939), although it was not a classic at the box office when first released. Its poor reception convinced LeRoy to quit producing pictures and go back to directing them. He always had a good relationship with actors and had discovered a number of people who would go on to become major stars, such as Clark Gable (who was rejected for a role in \"Little Caesar\" by Jack L. Warner over LeRoy's objections), Loretta Young, Robert Mitchum and Lana Turner.\n\nLeRoy turned out numerous hits for MGM in the 1940s, such as Der Tote lebt (1941), Gefundene Jahre (1942) and one of the best patriotic films of the period, Dreißig Sekunden über Tokio (1944). He spent a year at RKO at the end of the war as a producer and director, but quickly returned to MGM, where he remained until 1954. The collapse of the studio system in the 1950s required him to re-assume a producer's role; along with other Hollywood players of the day, he formed his own production company, which set up camp at Warner Bros., and he produced and directed a number of films for that studio based on successful stage plays. LeRoy had a reputation for taking on different types of films, and he seldom did the same type of picture twice, turning out comedies, dramas, fantasies and musicals. His output declined in the 1960s and he took a working retirement in 1965, disgruntled at the direction the film industry had taken. He was sorely tempted to tackle Pierre Boulle's Planet der Affen (1968), but declined, deciding that the requirement to put up his own money was too risky for a man in his mid-60s. His last directorial effort was assisting old friend John Wayne for certain scenes in Die grünen Teufel (1968). He took a figurehead position at Mego International in the 1970s and talked of producing westerns, but nothing came of it. However, as talented and successful as LeRoy was as a director over his long career, and considering the number of classic films he was responsible for, the one thing he never managed to successfully get was an Oscar for Best Director. The man who joked he never made a total flop died in 1987.\n\nBespeckled Sam Briskin was a key executive in CBC (Cohn-Brandt-Cohn) Film Sales. CBC's financial operations were ran out of New York by Jack Cohn and Joe Brandt, with Harry Cohn soon moving west to Hollywood to secure production facilities and produce films. In the early years CBC steadfastly refused to buy a studio, preferring to lease space and rent equipment at the old Balshofer Studios on Hollywood Boulevard and at the Independent Studios on Sunset and Gower -- which was known as Poverty Row or Gower Gulch, which did nothing for the firm's reputation (Gower was populated by fly-by-night film companies such as Educational Pictures, a notoriously seedy studio where careers went to die). CBC's earliest releases utilized excess unexposed film stock purchased from other studios. Initially hired as an underpaid auditor, Sam quickly rose within the company's Hollywood ranks thanks to his ability to tactfully negotiate CBC's contracts; tact not being a gift that his tight-fisted boss Harry Cohn possessed. CBC's productions, while profitable, met with derision in the industry -- the company was nicknamed \"Corned Beef and Cabbage\" Productions, a tag that enraged Harry Cohn. And an enraged Harry Cohn was a monster. By the time the company's name changed to the loftier-sounding Columbia Pictures Corporation on January 10, 1924, Sam was Harry's second-in-command. Sam helped guide Harry through several important business decisions that would pay huge dividends over the next three decades: he backed the company's decision to reject theater ownership, supported Cohn's concept (out of sheer cheapness, if nothing else) of hiring talent, with the notable exceptions of director Frank Capra, Peter Lorre (who was largely loaned out), and, The Three Stooges comedy team (which came inexpensively enough to justify) on a per-picture basis -- whenever Columbia tended to use big stars, they were usually the result of other studios who used the poverty row studio as a lesson in humility. Both Warner Brothers and MGM routinely loaned out stars to the studio whenever it was felt they'd become too demanding or picky about scripts. Briskin negotiated the contracts and Cohn would invariably place them in Capra's films, usually to great success throughout the 1930's. Capra's Es geschah in einer Nacht (1934) was the single most important production in the studio's history; the relatively low budgeted film starred Claudette Colbert and MGM's Clark Gable, both of whom bristled at working anywhere near Gower Gulch. The film earned lowly Columbia its first Best Picture Oscar and awards for its stars, director and screenplay adaption, propelling it into the ranks of the major studios. Once his company attained major-studio status, Cohn was forced to pay higher salaries to A-list stars, which often caused him fits. Columbia only began cultivating its own stars on contract late in the decade, and ironically, it usually took a contractee being loaned out to another studio to prove to him he had a valuable asset on his hands. Although a man of remarkable business instincts, Harry Cohn was undoubtedly the most hated of all the major studio executives due to his innumerable character flaws: he was explosive, uneducated, extremely crude and would cuss out anyone at the slightest perceived fault (imagine say, a shorter meaner Wallace Beery, only vastly more influential). But it was also true that out of these faults, Cohn recognized that he needed Sam's expertise -- the two men often fought (Cohn fought with everyone). With Columbia's rise within the industry, Sam's reputation grew as moderating force to Cohn's near-impossible nature. In the 1940's he was placed in charge of the studio's B-pictures, an important part of the studio's remarkable financial success and one that it would never abandon during Cohn's reign. Stars such as 'Glenn Ford', William Holden and Rita Hayworth were cultivated and the studio enjoyed its first real blockbuster with Der Jazzsänger (1946), which grossed a then-whopping $8 million during its initial release. The Cohn-Briskin team wisely embraced television (with the exception of Paramount, this decision met with loud derision elsewhere in Hollywood) in the early 1950's, creating the Screen Gems subsidiary (headed by Harry's nephew Ralph) and weathered the turmoil of the decade in relatively good shape, bringing newcomers Judy Holliday and Jack Lemmon on board as contract stars. Harry Cohn's death of a heart attack in 1958 was the end of an era at the studio and Sam was promoted by the board of directors as head of production. He led Columbia through the even more turbulent early 1960's, scoring big hits with _The Guns of Navarone (1961)_ and 'David Lean''s Lawrence von Arabien (1962). Meanwhile Screen Gems became a dominant force in television production, most notably with the long-running hit CBS series The Beverly Hillbillies (1962) and its numerous rural comedy spin-offs. Sam Briskin died in 1968, having successfully transitioned the company away from Cohn's iron-fisted dictatorial rule.\n\nJanet Leigh was the only child of a couple who often moved from town to town. Living in apartments, Janet was a bright child who skipped several grades and finished high school when she was 15. A lonely child, she would spend much of her time at movie theaters. She was a student, studying music and psychology, at the University of the Pacific until she was \"discovered\" while visiting her parents in Northern California. Her father was working the desk at a ski resort where her mother worked as a maid. Retired MGM actress Norma Shearer saw a picture of Janet on the front desk and asked if she could borrow it. This led to a screen test at MGM and a starring role in The Romance of Rosy Ridge (1947). MGM was looking for a young naive country girl and Janet filled the bill perfectly. She would play the young ingénue in a number of films and work with such stars as Errol Flynn, Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Orson Welles and Judy Garland. She appeared in a number of successful films, including Kleine tapfere Jo (1949), Angels in the Outfield (1951), Scaramouche - Der Mann mit der Maske (1952), Houdini, der König des Variete (1953) and Der eiserne Ritter von Falworth (1954), among others. Janet would appear in a variety of films, from comedies to westerns to musicals to dramas. Of her more than 50 movies, she would be remembered for the 45 minutes that she was on the screen in the small-budget thriller Psycho (1960). Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this 1960 classic would include the shower scene that would become a film landmark. Even though her character is killed off early in the picture, she would be nominated for an Academy Award and receive a Golden Globe. Her next film would be Botschafter der Angst (1962), in which she starred with Frank Sinatra. For the rest of the decade, her appearances in films would be rare, but she worked with Paul Newman in Ein Fall für Harper (1966). In the 1970s she appeared on the small screen in a number of made-for-TV movies. In 1980, she appeared alongside her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis in The Fog: Nebel des Grauens (1980), and later, in Halloween H20 - 20 Jahre später (1998). Janet Leigh died at age 77 in her home in Beverly Hills, California on October 3, 2004.\n\nCurd Jürgens (commonly billed as \"Curt Jurgens\" in anglophone countries) was one of the most successful European film actors of the 20th Century. He was born Curd Gustav Andreas Gottlieb Franz Jürgens on December 13, 1915, in Solln, Bavaria, in Hohenzollern Imperial Germany, a subject of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Of Franco-German parentage, Jürgens -- who was born during the closing days of the second year of the First World War -- would abandon the country of his birth after the end of World War II: Jürgens became an Austrian citizen in 1945 and lived part-time in France.\n\nJürgens entered the journalism profession after receiving his education, and married Louise Basler, an actress. Basler, the first of his five wives, encouraged him to switch careers and become an actor. He learned his new profession on the Vienna stage, which retained his loyalty even after he became an global film star. Jürgens was sent to a concentration camp for \"political unreliables\" in 1944, due to his anti-Nazi opinions. It was this experience in Nazi Germany that led him to become an Austrian citizen after the war.\n\nHis appearance in Des Teufels General (1955) (\"The Devil's General\" (1955)), established him as a star of German cinema, and his role as Brigitte Bardot's older lover in Roger Vadim's ...und immer lockt das Weib (1956) (And God Created Woman (1956)) made him an international star. Always interested in multilingual European actors with good looks and talent, Hollywood beckoned the 6' 4\" Jürgens, casting him in Duell im Atlantik (1957) as a WWII German U-boat commander in a duel with American destroyer commander Robert Mitchum. He constantly was in demand to play Germany military officers (e.g., Der längste Tag (1962), the most expensive black-and-white film ever made) -- indeed, his last role was as \"The General\" in the miniseries Agent in eigener Sache (1982) -- and Germanic villains (e.g., \"Cornelius\", the cowardly and treacherous trading company representative, in Lord Jim (1965)) for the rest of his life. One of his most famous roles in the English-language cinema was as the James Bond villain, \"Karl Stromberg\", in Der Spion, der mich liebte (1977); it was Moore's favorite Bond film.\n\nJürgens considered himself primarily a stage actor and often performed on the Vienna stage. Though the world knew him as a cinema actor, he also directed several films and wrote several screenplays and an autobiography, \"Sixty and Not Yet Wise\" (1975). His death from a heart attack in 1982 in Vienna was front-page news across Austria and Germany.\n\nOne of Hollywood's finest character / \"Method\" actors, Eli Wallach was in demand for over 60 years (first film/TV role was 1949) on stage and screen, and has worked alongside the world's biggest stars, including Clark Gable, Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen, Marilyn Monroe, Yul Brynner, Peter O'Toole, and Al Pacino, to name but a few.\n\nWallach was born on 7 December 1915 in Brooklyn, NY, to Jewish parents who emigrated from Poland, and was one of the few Jewish kids in his mostly Italian neighborhood. His parents, Bertha (Schorr) and Abraham Wallach, owned a candy store, Bertha's Candy Store. He went on to graduate with a B.A. from the University of Texas in Austin, but gained his dramatic training with the Actors Studio and the Neighborhood Playhouse. He made his debut on Broadway in 1945, and won a Tony Award in 1951 for portraying Alvaro Mangiacavallo in the Tennessee Williams play \"The Rose Tattoo\".\n\nWallach made a strong screen debut in 1956 in the film version of the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll - Begehre nicht des anderen Weib (1956), shined as \"Dancer\", the nattily dressed hitman, in director Don Siegel's film-noir classic Der Henker ist unterwegs (1958), and co-starred in the heist film Sieben Diebe (1960). Director John Sturges then cast Wallach as vicious Mexican bandit Calvera in Die glorreichen Sieben (1960), the western adaptation of the Akira Kurosawa epic Die sieben Samurai (1954). Misfits - Nicht gesellschaftsfähig (1961), in the star-spangled western opus Das war der wilde Westen (1962), the underrated WW2 film Die Sieger (1963), as a kidnapper in Der Millionenraub (1964), in the sea epic Lord Jim (1965) and in the romantic comedy Wie klaut man eine Million? (1966).\n\nLooking for a third lead actor in the final episode of the \"Dollars Trilogy\", Italian director Sergio Leone cast the versatile Wallach as the lying, two-faced, money-hungry (but somehow lovable) bandit \"Tuco\" in the spectacular Zwei glorreiche Halunken (1966) (aka \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\"), arguably his most memorable performance. Wallach kept busy throughout the remainder of the '60s and into the '70s with good roles in Mackenna's Gold (1969), Zapfenstreich (1973), Testament in Blei (1974), Die Tiefe (1977) and as Steve McQueen's bail buddy in Jeder Kopf hat seinen Preis (1980).\n\nThe 1980s was an interesting period for Wallach, as he was regularly cast as an aging doctor, a Mafia figure or an over-the-hill hitman, such as in The Executioner's Song (1982), Verfeindet bis aufs Blut (1985), Archie und Harry - Sie können's nicht lassen (1986), Nuts ... Durchgedreht (1987), Die Spur führt zurück (1990) and as the candy-addicted \"Don Altabello\" in Der Pate 3 (1990). At 75+ years of age, Wallach's quality of work was still first class and into the 1990s and beyond, he has remained in demand. He lent fine support to Vendetta: Secrets of a Mafia Bride (1990), Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story (1992), Naked City: Justice with a Bullet (1998) and Glauben ist alles! (2000). Most recently Wallach showed up as a fast-talking liquor store owner in Mystic River (2003) and in the comedic drama King of the Corner (2004).\n\nIn early 2005, Eli Wallach released his much anticipated autobiography, \"The Good, The Bad And Me: In My Anecdotage\", an enjoyable reading from one of the screen's most inventive and enduring actors.\n\nEli Wallach was very much a family man who remained married to his wife Anne Jackson for 66 years. When Wallach died at 98, in 2014, in Manhattan, NY, he was survived by his wife, three children, five grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.\n\nIn Britain, special Christmas plays called pantomimes are produced for children. Jack Hawkins made his London theatrical debut at age 12, playing the elf king in \"Where The Rainbow Ends\". At 17, he got the lead role of St. George in the same play. At 18, he made his debut on Broadway in \"Journey's End\". At 21, he was back in London playing a young lover in \"Autumn Crocus\". He married his leading lady, Jessica Tandy. That year he also played his first real film role in the 1931 sound version of Alfred Hitchcock's The Lodger (1932). During the 30s, he took his roles in plays more seriously than the films he made. In 1940, Jessica accepted a role in America and Jack volunteered to serve in the Royal Welch Fusiliers. He spent most of his military career arranging entertainment for the British forces in India. One of the actresses who came out to India was Doreen Lawrence who became his second wife after the war. Alexander Korda advised Jack to go into films and offered him a three-year contract. In his autobiography, Jack recalled: \"Eight years later I was voted the number one box office draw of 1954. I was even credited with irresistible sex appeal, which is another quality I had not imagined I possessed.\" A late 1940s film, Die schwarze Rose (1950), where he played a secondary role to Tyrone Power, would be one of his most fortunate choices of roles. The director was Henry Hathaway who Jack said was \"probably the most feared, yet respected director in America, for he had a sharp tongue and fired people at the drop of a hat. Years later, after my operation when I lost my voice, he went out of his way to help me get back into films. What I did not know was that during the filming of 'The Black Rose' he was himself suffering from cancer.\" In the 1950s came the film that made Hawkins a star, Der große Atlantik (1953). Suffering from life-long, real-life seasickness, he played the captain of the Compass Rose. After surgery for throat cancer in 1966, requiring the removal of his larynx, Jack continued to make films. He mimed his lines and the voice was dubbed by either Charles Gray or Robert Rietty. His motto during those last years came from Milton's \"Comus\", a verse play in which he acted early in his career in Regent's Park. The lines: \"Yet where an equal poise of hope and fear does arbitrate the event, my nature is that I incline to hope, rather than to fear.\""
