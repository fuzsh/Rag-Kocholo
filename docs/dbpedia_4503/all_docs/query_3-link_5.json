        "text": "Los ANGELES “Today the film composer is a star. More than onethird of a picture's success is due to the music. The audience doesn't know it is being turned on by the music, but a good score can grab an audience and hold it. I have seen weak performances helped enormously by music. I have seen it drive weak stories forward. Music is the most underrated single contribution to pictures today.”\n\nThe man talking is Robert Evans, former executive vice president in charge of production of Paramount Pictures and now an independent producer for that company. Evans's views on the crucial role played by the composer in contemporary films seems to be shared by the top executives at all the other studios. More than ever before, producers and directors are working closely with oomposers from the outset of a movie in an effort to underscore dramatic passages and to comment musically on the development of\n\nIn the past, music for Hollywood movies was largely devised for the purpose of producing hit tunes which in turn would serve as valuable publicity for the movies themselves, or as a kind of narcotic to numb audiences into overlooking holes in the plot. There were notable exceptions, of course; one need only recall the forceful and sophisticated score written by Bernard Herrmann for “Citizen Kane,” or Aaron Copland's masterful‐music for “The Heiress,” or Bronislau Kaper's for “Gaslight.”\n\nOne of the most influential composers of Hollywood's past was Erich Wolfgang Korngold, who came out of Austria to work at Warner Brothers in the thirties. A distinguished alumnus of the Vienna opera, he continued to compose in the operatic vein, using leitmotivs for each character, place or emotional theme, drenching soundtracks with lush strings, establishing a whole romantic kitsch tradition in which such figures as Dmitri Tiomkin, Franz Waxman and Alfred Newman flourished in the forties and fifties. Another Austrian, Max Steiner, also a major presence on the Hollywood musical scene for over 30 years, had a similar style.\n\nThe transition from the Korngold‐Steiner brand of lush, heavy film music to a more spare and selective orchestration came about very gradually, perhaps as a response to a tougher kind of rnoviemaking, as well as to the changes occurring in serious music and in musical tastes. At any rate, “wall‐towall” music — scores crammed full of lilting melodies and emotional crescendos—are all but passé in Hollywood. The best composers working in films today use music fax more sparingly than their predecessors, composing an average of 25 minutes of music for a 100&$x2010;minute film instead of the SO minutes which would have been of the\n\nThe most skilled of the current composers have managed to introduce elements of modernism and even 12tone procedures into pictures, and audiences have responded positively to the innovations. in violent films, arhythmic percussion effects are often used, although flowing, hummable melodies are still deemed advisable in romantic scenes.\n\nHard‐pressed, often working IS‐hour shifts and subject to the wills and whims of demanding executives, the leading composers in the field are few and on constant call. For those who can satisfy the top brass, the rise to success is swift. Perhaps the most gifted of the prom. inent music‐makers today are Lab o Schifrin (“Enter the Dragon,” “The Four Musketeers”), John Williams (“The Towering Inferno,” “Earthquake,” “Jaws”) and David Shire (“The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three,” “The Hindenburg”). They are resourceful composers, adept at contributing good music to films, along with the hackwork Hollywood inevitably\n\nEqually talented is Phillip Lambro, a dedicated composer who prefers to work in the documentary field, where more freedom is possible. Jerry Goldsmith, Jerry Fielding, Marvin Hamlisch and Michel Legrand have also enjoyed huge success, but they are more conventional figures, content to work in a traditional romantic style. Goldsmith is probably the most accomplished of this group, having turned out compelling scores for “Patton,” “Papillon” and “Chinatown.”\n\nTop‐flight movie composers are paid $25,000 a score plus percentages of album sales, and earn $100,000 a year and up. A handsome, selfconfident clan, they dress very expensively, eat at the best restaurants, live in luxury houses or apartments, drive costly cars, and mingle with the chic Hollywood set. Unlike most “concert” composers, they are not struggling and anguished, fighting to achieve perfection; the secret of their success is speed, slickness and the ability to dash off or two, with a minimum of fuss.\n\nOf all the Hollywood composers who have achieved a compromise between traditionalism and modernism—while still managing to produce original, provocative effects—Lalo Schifrin, 39, is the most successful. An Argentinian, with dark eyes and hair and the romantic pallor of a latter‐day Chopin, he began his career as an arranger—the customary route to full — scale composing. He seems proud of the fact that he not only studied Rene ‘Leibowitz and Olivier Messiaen, but did musical arrangements tfor Sarah Vaughan, Count Basie and Stan Getz and even conducted a jazz\n\n“There are two kinds of composers,” Schifrin says, “those who come from the conservatory and those who come from the street. 1 believe a film composer has to come from both. To use a literary analogy, he must be both poet and reporter.”\n\n‘Schifrin speaks for his contemporaries Kvhen he says, “We tend to work with the director from the very beginning of composition. Often, we play him a theme on a piano or—in cases where he can read a score—show him some sample work. In every case, we try to reflect the theme, or themes, of a film as dramatically as possible in simple motifs.”\n\nWhile respecting the work of old masters Korngold, Steiner and Waxman, Schifrin, like his confreres, has decisively rejected their use of ornate wall‐to‐wall music. Instead — in such films as “Bullitt” and “Dirty Harry”—he brought to scoring the somewhat austere approach of Schoenberg, Webern, and Penderecki.\n\nFor “Cool Hand Luke,” a prison drama set in the south, Schifrin used a jagged banjo theme as his central motif; in “Enter the Dragon,” a Kung‐Fu thriller, he rejected the usual windbells‐and‐tinsel approach of Hollywood composers to Chinese scores and instead based his score on an extensive study of Chinese music at U.C.L.A. In Richard Lester's “The Four Musketeers” he effectively mirrored late Renaissance music, providing cunningly distorted sonorities with a very large orchestra in which the characteristic instruments of the period were wittily employed to reflect the acid, comic style of Lester's direction. Spirited galops, triumphal marches, and muted pizzicati all create an impression of largeness undercut by a strong satirical sence.\n\nJohn Williams, 43, may not be as consistently inventive as Schifrin, but he is every bit as popular with Hollywood producers. Subdued and self‐effacing, with fair hair and a blond beard, he is known as one of the most cooperative composers in the industry. His first major feature was “The Reivers,” in which he supplied a cheerful pastiche of Stephen Foster tunes, and an attractive waltz theme expressing the romanticism of Steve McQueen's love for a car. His offbeat score for Robert Altman's “Images,” about a sexually disturbed girl's fantasies, was full of eerie, dissonant effects. in “The Towering Inferno,” he combined a series of water chimes and four Peking gongs to achieve atonal results one would not expect to find in a conventional “disaster” epic.\n\nDavid Shire, 37, is a slight and subdued composer who has landed two big scoring jobs this year: “The Hindenburg” and “The Fortune.” A former television composer, he came to Hollywood to write the music for “The Skin Game.” “Two People,” “Class of ‘44,” “Drive, He Said” and “Steelyard Blues.” His wife, Talia Shire, is Francis Ford Coppola's sister, a relationship which may have influenced Coppola's decision to hire Shire to write the music for “The Conversation.” His score for that film was written primarily for piano and moog synthesizer (he played the piano himself). it created a jarring, unsettling mood which reflected the anguish of the central figure, a bugging agent played by Gene Hackman.\n\nShire's most ambitious score to date was for “The Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three,” in which he used serial techniques to suggest the disorganized and whirring sounds of a New York subway.\n\nDespite the glamour and six‐figure incomes, composing for films has its share of sour notes. “Film scoring may be very rewarding,” John Williams says, “but it's also agony. Film composers are not their own masters. They are working for corporations. You accept that as part of the job.” Studio executives have been known to replace or severely cut scores at the last minute. Musical arrangers, too, are subject to intense pressure: Peter Bogdanovich threw out Artie Butler's complete set of arrangements for his Cole Porter musical “At Long Last Love,” and the reworking of them by Butler cost a fortune, with musicians’ fees averaging $22 an hour. And, at long last, the movie proved\n\nThe replacement or scores has become a routine proce dure in recent years. Robert Evans threw out Jimmy Webb's music for “Love Story” and replaced it with Francis Lai's, abandoning his duties at Paramount for months to work with Lai in the south of France. “Francis Lai saved the picture,” Evans says now, and few would argue the point.\n\nEvans also reconstructed much of Nino Rota's score for “The Godfather,” and he scrapped Phillip Larnbro's elegant but occasionally harsh music for “Chinatown” when he felt that a preview audience was turned off by it. He replaced it with a more conventional but undeniably effective score by Jerry Goldsmith. Evans fought bitterly with Goldsmith all through the scoring session, but Goldsmith now feels Evans's decisions were right.\n\nPhillip Lambro disagrees. “Evans knows nothing about music,” he says. “I don't believe the preview audiences reacted against my score at all. I just think Evans was insecure. But the irony is that my theme for Faye Dunaway could have been a hit tune, and Jerry Goldsmith's could not.”\n\nKnowing that their work can be replaced or cut or transposed or otherwise tampered with at any moment, composers are very much in the same position as Hollywood writers, operating within a system which can rapidly corrupt them, forcing them to work too rapidly and superficially. A situation in which original ideas sometimes have to be sneaked into scores is not very healthy, and Phillip Lambro, for one, claims he will write only one score a year, and then only on condition that he is given complete freedom. Devoting himself with rigorous austerity to concert works, he is prepared to exist on a comparatively small income in order not to destroy\n\nBut Lambro is atypical, not really a “Hollywood composer.” For the others, with their huge incomes, Beverly Hills houses, fast cars and well‐dressed wives, it's still a question of placating studio executives, directors, critics, and the public. And most difficult of all their own artistic consciences, in Hollywood in 1975."
