        "text": "Tartare Mega-Post: 20 More Titles Now Available\n\nYou've got to hand it to the folks at Collectors' Choice Music: when they launch a new catalogue initiative, they don't mess around. After an initial offering last month of 10 releases on the new Tartare imprint, CCM has just announced a further 20 titles to bolster the budding Tartare lineup. The genres covered in this batch are incredibly diverse: from folk songs to groovy psychedelia, polkas to 1990s jangle pop, deep soul to disco, jazz to country. In short, there really is something for\n\nQuite a Leap of \"Faith\"\n\nThis morning we come closer to unraveling the mysteries of Legacy's upcoming reissues of George Michael's Faith. The Limited Collector's Box Set edition was made available to order today, and if you like George a lot, this might be the set for you. The set includes: The original album, remastered A CD of remixes and B-sides A DVD featuring a vintage Channel 4 special, George Michael and Jonathan Ross Have Words, the original EPK entitled Music Money Love Faith and seven promo videos A\n\nMining Audiophile Treasures: Coming Soon from Audio Fidelity and MFSL\n\nSome of rock’s finest will be receiving the deluxe treatment from audiophile specialist labels Audio Fidelity and Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) in the coming months: The Beach Boys, The Band, Gram Parsons, Deep Purple, Foreigner, The Pretenders and Billy Joel. The earliest release in this bunch is also one of the most exciting. The Beach Boys' Today! was released in 1965 and is generally remembered as one of the first albums on which Brian Wilson displayed the sensitive studio wizardry that\n\nSyl Johnson Box Set Coming (Not Because He's Black)\n\nA hat tip to Record Racks (who are contributing a neat guest post later this week that I'm quite excited for) for passing this one along: Numero Group is prepping a box set due October 19 devoted to unjustly forgotten soul survivor Syl Johnson. Johnson was a soul musician in the James Brown or Al Green mold. He toured with Magic Sam and Howlin' Wolf, cut tracks for the Federal label (the same one that put out \"Please, Please, Please,\" James Brown's first hit) and had a socially conscious Top 20\n\nNews Round-Up: More Morrissey, Live Dio, A Change at Disney and More\n\nOur inimitable alt-rock flame-keeper friends at Slicing Up Eyeballs point us toward a trail of additional Morrissey rarities leading up to the 20th anniversary reissue of his excellent compilation Bona Drag. It seems that early single \"Everyday is Like Sunday\" is going to be reissued on CD and 7-inch vinyl, and will include some interesting bonus tracks. Both vinyl singles include live renditions of \"Sunday\" from the Hollywood Bowl in 2007 and The New York Dolls' \"Trash\" from 1991, while the CD\n\nFriday Feature: \"Footloose\"\n\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsCO-YkDgnY] This week's theatrical release of Step Up 3D proves that young people everywhere still embrace the notion of defying authority by shaking one's ass on the dance floor. It's nothing new, of course; ever since Columbia Pictures turned Twist Around the Clock onto a dance-crazy culture in 1961, dance pictures have become a generational touchstone. Whether they're good, crowd-pleasing films (Saturday Night Fever (1977), Flashdance (1983)) or\n\nApple Announcements and Additions\n\nApple has announced the full, final specs for its upcoming swath of reissues, and they've managed to include some surprises that weren't previously known about. The Second Disc posted a rundown last month of some planned bonus tracks based on a beta version of Apple Records' Web site. Now, the site offers a full press release and track list details for every one of the upcoming releases. Not only does nearly every reissue now contain bonus tracks (including the James Taylor and Jackie Lomax\n\nThe Second Disc Interview #2: From Hollywood, It's Bruce Kimmel!\n\nProducer, director, writer, actor, composer, lyricist, raconteur – any and all of those words could be used to describe Bruce Kimmel. After helping to launch the Varese Sarabande label over thirty years ago and christening its still-ongoing soundtrack series with his score to The First Nudie Musical (which he also wrote, co-directed and acted in), Kimmel founded the Bay Cities label. Between 1989 and 1993, he and his Bay Cities colleagues were among the very first to reissue classic film\n\nComing Tomorrow: Adventures in Kritzerland!\n\nA most excellent heads-up to readers of The Second Disc: at noon tomorrow we'll be posting our second interview. This one's done by our very own Joe Marchese, and will feature a dialogue with Bruce Kimmel. The longtime record producer/writer/director known in some circles for his catalogue work through the Kritzerland label (and in others for cult classics like The First Nudie Musical!) will chat with us about his work, past, present and future. It should be a good read, and it'll be here in\n\nThe Tra-La Days Are Back: Wounded Bird to Offer Sedaka Two-on-One\n\nNeil Sedaka famously proclaimed that \"The Tra-La Days Are Over\" as the title of his (unfortunately out-of-print) 1973 album. But thanks to Wounded Bird (as if the label hadn't announced a big enough bonanza for reissue fans already!), fans of rock and roll's golden age have another chance to enjoy Sedaka's days as king of the shoo-be-doos and tra-la-las. Little Devil and His Other Hits/The Many Sides of Neil Sedaka is set for release on September 7 according to Pause and Play. For an artist with\n\nIt's Up\n\nThe Complete Elvis Presley Masters. Go here. Talk below. Some reactions after the jump.\n\nThe Rebel Kind: Ace Preps Lee Hazlewood Compilation\n\nWhen Lee Hazlewood died in 2007 after a brave battle with cancer, music lost one of its true eccentrics. With a resonant baritone, a keen ear for a melody and a dry wit, Hazlewood was an unlikely recording star. His first long-term collaboration was with guitarist Duane Eddy, with whom he produced a string of hit instrumentals. His second such collaboration was a career-defining one with Nancy Sinatra, effectively launching her career with 1966’s “These Boots are Made for Walkin’” on the Reprise\n\n\"Listen\" to Gary Lewis' Solo Reissue, Coming Soon from Now Sounds\n\nEverybody loves a clown, so why don't you? Many did indeed love acclaimed comedian and filmmaker Jerry Lewis, but it must have been a surprise when his 20-year old son, Gary, received quite a lot of chart love in 1965. Discovered at Disneyland and signed to Liberty Records by ace producer Snuff Garrett, Gary Lewis and the Playboys had a smash right out of the gate with \"This Diamond Ring.\" Hitting No. 1 in the middle of the British Invasion, that Al Kooper/Bob Brass/Irwin Levine song remains a\n\nA Wounded Bird Bonanza (EVEN MORE ADDED 7/30)\n\nWounded Bird Records has just opened the floodgates and got a couple of interesting obscurities released or reissued on CD. There's a couple of notable names here, and at least one that looks to have bonus tracks. Hit the jump to see them all.\n\nFriday Feature: \"Predator\"\n\nIf you went into theatres in the summer of 1987 to see Predator, you might have expected a rote action film with Arnold Schwarzenegger and nothing more. On the surface, there's nothing that would have you expect anything else. The Austrian Oak leads a team of soldiers through an attempted rescue mission in South America. Sounds like any other action movie from the '80s, right? But then you catch those quick bursts of infrared images. The distorted sound. The unearthly snarling. And you realize\n\nReissue Theory: Sting - \"The Art of the Heart\"\n\nThis week's Reissue Theory is something a bit different: a proposal to reissue a record that's never actually been released! When people talk about phenomenal live artists, the conversation doesn't often turn toward Sting's solo career. The Police were a hell of a live act - they built their career on constant touring all over the world - but Sting's solo career, however good, always has an air of stuffiness to it. How could the same singer currently on tour with a symphony orchestra ever be\n\nBack Tracks: The Cars\n\nThe above picture is a bit of a shock, if you haven't seen it yet: all four of the surviving members of The Cars - Ric Ocasek, Elliott Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson - in a recording studio. It was posted to the official Facebook page for the Boston-based rockers on Thursday. No caption, no explanation. Just the members of The Cars, possibly gearing up for some new music. And who'd have thought? Since the band broke up in 1988, chances seemed slim where a reunion was concerned. The\n\nIconoclassic to Reissue Solo Carl Wilson and Guess Who in September\n\nIf sensitive composer/producer Brian Wilson was the soul of The Beach Boys, and brash frontman Mike Love the voice, passionate singer/guitarist Carl Wilson was no doubt the heart. There was little Carl Wilson couldn’t do, vocally, whether the angelic tones of “God Only Knows,” the soulful shouting of “I Was Made to Love Her” or the dreamlike psychedelia of “Feel Flows.” And when brother Brian wasn’t able to guide the band through the tumultuous 1970s, Carl stepped up to the plate with an amazing\n\nThe Lady and Her Music: \"The Essential Lena Horne\" Coming in August\n\nThanks to our friends at MusicTAP for the tip that, on August 24, Legacy will celebrate the life of a great lady of song with its release of The Essential Lena Horne: The RCA Years. Like The Essential Henry Mancini (scheduled to be released on the same day), this release is far from definitive, but appears to be a solid introduction to one period of the late Horne’s magnificent career. That career saw the artist rising from her nightclub roots to break racial barriers in Hollywood, becoming one\n\nThe Second Disc Interview #1: A Soulful Chat with Harry Weinger\n\nIt is with the greatest pride that The Second Disc presents its first-ever interview, bringing you closer to the catalogue music world we all love so much. Our first interviewee is one of the most notable names from the world of reissues. Harry Weinger, vice-president of A&R for Universal Music Enterprises, has been part of the music business for more than 30 years, writing for publications like Rolling Stone, Vibe, Billboard and Cashbox before becoming a staff writer for PolyGram's\n\nNews Round-Up: Dead on Vinyl, Closer to Elvis, Deluxe Duran Rearranged and More\n\nThe Grateful Dead is releasing a five-LP box set containing reissues of the band's first five studio albums for Warner Bros. records. Collectors will want to take note that this box will include the original mixes of Anthem of the Sun and Aoxomoxoa, which have not been released since the original LPs came out. The set is due on September 21; pre-orders placed now get a bonus reproductions of a 7\" single and a vintage promo poster. While we await tomorrow's pre-order date for a crazy-enormous\n\nBreaking News: More \"Promises\" Kept from Kritzerland\n\nWe catalogue music enthusiasts just can't get enough. Near-universal acclaim greeted Kritzerland on its re-release of the original cast album of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's Promises, Promises, including from your humble correspondent. Yet many of those cheers were quickly followed in the fan community by: \"Now, when are you going to release the London Cast Recording?\" The long-lost United Artists LP was recorded in 1969 with the stars of the production at the Prince of Wales Theatre: Tony\n\nBritish Invasion, Redux: New Sets Due from The Searchers and Petula Clark\n\nWhile the original British Invasion is now just a few years south of 50, its music continues to endure. The Second Disc is pleased to report on a trio of new releases coming our way from two of the U.K.’s seminal artists, The Searchers and Petula Clark. One of the best and most successful bands to come out of Liverpool, The Searchers may have toiled in the shadow of that other band from Liverpool, but hits like “Sugar and Spice,” “Pins and Needles” and “When You Walk in the Room” remain some of\n\nBack Tracks: Burton and Elfman\n\nIt turns out the reissue of Batman wasn't the only Danny Elfman-related catalogue news at this year's San Diego Comic-Con: Elfman shared at a panel discussion that Warner Bros. is planning a box set devoted to the composer's longtime collaboration with director Tim Burton. It's not much of a surprise that such a set would happen. Burton and Elfman's collaboration is one of the strongest director-composer bonds in Hollywood. And while neither men are collaborating with the kind of urgently great"
