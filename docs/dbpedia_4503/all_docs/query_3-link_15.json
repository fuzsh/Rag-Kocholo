Enhanced by a haunting score and atmospheric cinematography, 'Arcadian' immerses viewers in a world teetering on the brink of collapse, where every shadow conceals a potential threat. Yes, if you’ve seen 'A Quiet Place,' 'Bird Box,' or '28 Days Later,' you know exactly what to expect, but the film manages to inject unique personality through its talented young actors and some truly remarkable monster movie magic that broadly looks practical and not unlike the puppetry work of Jim Henson. Like its quality predecessors, 'Arcadian' is more than a mere horror film; it’s a haunting meditation on the fragility of humanity and the enduring power of hope in the face of despair. It turns out that mixing heart with horror still works.\"\n\nMike DeAngelo, The Playlist\n\n\"Directed by Cage’s 'The Trust' filmmaker Ben Brewer, 'Arcadian' splits the difference between contemporary horror movies and ’80s Spielberg blockbusters, relying on clever jump scares and sentimental music cues in equal measure. An elegant little film about the things in life that are worth taking risks for, 'Arcadian' is a reminder of how much Cage has to offer us when he’s not contorting himself into something indescribable.\"\n\nChristian Zilko, IndieWire\n\nCHALLENGERS - Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross\n\n\"In the third act, the haphazard jutting finally begins to add texture to the story, but by then, I had spent too long wondering why writer Justin Kuritzkes and editor Marco Costa had hobbled the film’s structure in a too-obvious homage to the serve and return. (Credit to the flinty, sharp score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, though, which lends the film a tense propulsion that the storytelling itself desperately lacks.)\"\n\nAngelica Jade Bastien, New York\n\n\"Even the score from the Oscar-winning duo of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross is a disappointment, seemingly and inexplicably pilfering Pink Floyd’s 'On the Run.' It’s honked at the audience at alarming volume, sometimes obliterating the dialogue. If only the sound team had pushed heavier on the faders, because there were scenes when I wished that the mix would shove the eye-rolling script completely off court. And, let’s face facts, nothing here is going to beat hearing David Bowie’s 'Time Will Crawl' on a theatre-level sound system. So, there’s that going in Challengers’ favor. Aside from that, it’s just double fault after double fault.\"\n\nRichard Whittaker, The Austin Chronicle\n\n\"The actors dash around the tennis court, but it is kind of shocking that Guadagnino uses some stale sports-movie tropes, including a slo-mo walk down a corridor to the court outside, and spectators at a match turning their heads right then left then right again in unison. The tropes may be used knowingly but they still look clichéd. And there is a thunderous Thwack! whenever anyone hits a tennis ball. One of the best surprises turns out to be the soundtrack by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, a propulsive techno score that does a lot of the work to keep the tennis scenes moving.\"\n\nCaryn James, BBC.com\n\n\"The problems lie more so with the filmmaking itself. The heavy use of slow motion is a big offender, as is a specific musical cue that plays every. single. time. two out of the three characters start to verbally spar with each other. (You know, like a tennis match!) The cue completely drowns out the dialogue in some scenes and plays more like a drop you’d hear in a soap opera. The third act also becomes heavily reliant on POV shots of Patrick and Art hitting the ball, with a GoPro going back and forth in a way that’s going to induce many a headache.\"\n\nKristen Lopez, The Wrap\n\n\"Such euphoric filmmaking is enhanced by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ intoxicating, synth-heavy score, which asserts itself as an indispensable part of the film. In 'Challengers,' the music acts as punctuation, both periods and ellipses. Parts of it will kick in mid-sentence, as if someone accidentally opened Spotify while talking. Other times, the score will begin over a protracted conversation, amplifying the pressure during a heated tête-à-tête. It’s atypical for such a high-energy score to find its place in these otherwise quiet moments, but the music is a way for Guadagnino to augment this idea that everything -- each word of dialogue and choice made by a character -- is about tennis, and shares all of the same stakes. Everything is, therefore, also about sex, which is precisely what listening to Reznor and Ross’ agile set of electronic hedonism feels like.\"\n\nColeman Spilde, The Daily Beast\n\n\"Languid piano scales capture the hypnotic effect Tashi has on both men. More often, though, 'Challengers' punctuates scenes with an aggressive electronic score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which is fantastic but only intermittently seems to have anything to do with what’s onscreen. The heavy beats work best as a metronome for the tennis fans in the stands whipping their heads between volleys, although for a while, I was half-convinced that they were also the hold music filling Art’s head whenever his wife wasn’t lecturing him about his game. Really, though, I think Guadagnino is just having fun, especially when the feeling of that heaving pulse becomes even more important than the dialogue. Some conversations don’t even try to be heard over the racket. Instead, they take on that crunchy, echo-y sound of movie quotes swallowed up into club music, like how that George Michael track 'Too Funky' spliced in a sample of 'The Graduate's' Anne Bancroft purring, 'Would you like me to seduce you?'\"\n\nAmy Nicholson, Los Angeles Times\n\n\"There’s a whole lot of tennis in this movie, but the director and DP make sure it’s always engaging to watch. And the breathless, driving techno score, from soundtrack stalwarts Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, gives each new match a heart-in-the-throat feeling of escalation and intensity.\"\n\nTasha Robinson, Polygon\n\n\"The glaringly computer-generated tennis balls only serve to enhance the feeling that a racket is sometimes more than just a racket, while Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ pounding techno score is almost exclusively used to fill the silences between points, which is similar to how it’s used in the dialogue scenes throughout the film.\"\n\nDavid Ehrlich, IndieWire\n\n\"This is how 'Challengers' remains so erotic in spite of, and also because of, its paltry offering of sexually explicit sequences. It’s all buoyed by longing and unrealized desire, a patient camera fixated on bodies and the sweat that drips off them, and a pulsing techno score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that notably turns quiet, intimate scenes into feeding frenzies -- amplifying a build of tension that is often freed so unsatisfactorily (in a good way), always edging just short of climax.\"\n\nBrianna Zigler, Paste Magazine\n\n\"For the tennis matches, Guadagnino has a few tricks up his sleeve. First is Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross’ loud, thumping music. Then, the slowing down of many scenes to an almost standstill to show every nuance of movement on the actors’ faces while ignoring the uninteresting small yellow balls. These methods succeed only intermittently. The music becomes oppressive and intrusive in many instances and the freeze frames become too much to handle when they appear even in the non-tennis scenes. Both elements, however, make the final match that frames the whole movie exciting and carry the audience over to a satisfactory climax.\"\n\nMurtada Elfadl, The Onion AV Club\n\n\"Seldom these days is a movie just about adults in adult circumstances. Guadagnino, the Italian director who became more well-known to American audiences with his 2017 hit 'Call Me by Your Name,' has always specialized in the intimate connection between people. Combining his eye for expressive filmmaking, a mature performance from the three main stars and a droning pop score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, 'Challengers' is a seductive feast for the senses.\"\n\nAmanda Luberto, Arizona Republic\n\n\"What a situation! The instability of it keeps 'Challengers' on its toes even when it’s on the verge of getting tripped up by plot machinations and the past/present storytelling churn of Justin Kuritzkes’ screenplay and Marco Costa’s editing. There’s a lively cinematic subgenre that deconstructs the rise and fall of a relationship by jumping around in time -- two excellent examples are 'Blue Valentine' and 'Two for the Road' -- and this movie carries on that tradition with panache, and adds many spectacularly blocked, framed, and edited scenes of athletic competition that, taken together, feel like a tennis fan’s answer to a boxing picture. (Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor's score is insistent and relentless and loud, the techno-inflected answer to a full studio orchestra score in an old Hollywood melodrama.)\"\n\nMatt Zoller Seitz, RogerEbert.com\n\n\"Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor’s score feels like a sweaty, thumping, barn-burning event in and of itself. The house-inflected tracks throb and sidewind with excitement and menace -- adding a propulsive, glistening intensity to bouts of athleticism on the tennis court or verbal sparring off of it. The virulently danceable soundscape becomes integral to 'Challengers''s central idea -- that the rhythms of a tennis match can be seen as an analog for life and love.\"\n\nRocco T. Thompson, Slant Magazine\n\n\"But naturally, this wouldn’t work without Guadagnino’s careful hand and editor Marco Costa’s incredible job at making sure this convoluted story doesn’t become too much to handle. Guadagnino knows how to build tension in every scene, whether it’s an unbearable lust that our characters can’t seem to shake, or the intensity of a tennis match where seemingly anything can happen. This is also aided by the thumping, escalating score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross that builds up during the tennis scenes, while Guadagnino puts us right alongside the players, often bouncing us along like we’re the tennis ball going across the court.\"\n\nRoss Bonaime, Collider\n\n\"We begin and end at that Challenger tournament, where the sun beats down on a spectacle of unrivalled hotness. The camera, commanded by the cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, seems to be everywhere at once, exulting in the glory of bared chests and sweat-matted leg hair. A thunderous techno score, composed by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, pulses and surges hypnotically beneath the action, never quite drowning out the men’s grunts of effort and release. In the stands, the spectators jerk their heads dutifully left and right, but the camera keeps finding Tashi’s gaze, fixed straight ahead. She alone sees past the individual strokes, and the over-all score, to perceive the deeper psychological game her boys are playing.\"\n\nJustin Chang, The New Yorker\n\n\"Guadagnino’s weaving of eroticism into the everyday physicality of high-level athletic training brings to mind earlier cinematic depictions of the way romance and sports can combine, films like Gina Prince-Bythewood’s 2000 directorial debut 'Love and Basketball', Ron Shelton’s 1988 love-triangle baseball classic 'Bull Durham,' or the 1982 Robert Towne drama 'Personal Best,' a lesbian love story set in the world of track and field. 'Challengers' may not be this director’s most psychologically insightful movie -- the characters can at times feel like chess-piece contrivances rather than fully rounded individuals -- but it’s almost certainly his most entertaining and fastest-paced. The thumping EDM score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross lends not only the tennis scenes but several moments of off-court intimacy an atmosphere of pulse-pounding immediacy. And even if, like me, you’re not a sports person, either at the movies or in real life, the stakes of the Phil’s Tire Town Challenger have been so firmly established by the movie’s final scene that, like Zendaya’s Tashi, you’ll find your head swiveling from side to side as if your life’s trajectory hangs on the next bounce of that neon-green ball.\"\n\nDana Stevens, Slate.com\n\n\"Without revealing anything more it’s apparent that Kuritzkes has fashioned a well-written script. And while it has a nice twist or two, this storyline isn’t exactly groundbreaking. There’s only so much you can conjure with a love triangle story that hasn’t been done before. That’s where Guadagnino comes in and flips this scenario completely on its head. Not only does he push the boundaries on Art and Patrick’s friendship, but the Italian filmmaker uses a glorious late ”90s-esque thumping techno dance music score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to increase the tension in the film’s pivotal tennis matches. And then -- almost shockingly -- he layers it over major dramatic moments between the characters. So much so that you may not be able to hear exactly what they are saying in these moments (Christopher Nolan will be so proud). You can’t help but wonder how big a fan Guadagnino is of Tom Twyker’s 1998 classic 'Run Lola Run' which also featured a similar music motif (we’re guessing quite a bit), but it’s such an inspired and gutsy choice you can’t help but smile in how euphorically it works in the film’s final act.\"\n\nGregory Ellwood, The Playlist\n\n\"There’s a loudness to Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers that you might not anticipate, if you primarily associate the director with his melancholy romance 'Call Me By Your Name.' But here, the famed director has traded Sufjan Stevens for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, delivering a propulsive, captivating, and sometimes horny story of how love and competition might not always be so different. Propelling the on-court action is Reznor and Ross’s score, bringing a level of bombast to the sports action that at times threatens to overwhelm the action, without ever actually proving distracting. (And the closing credits track, 'Compress/Repress,' is flat-out sick, delivering Nine Inch Nails vibes with lyrics by Guadagnino and vocals by Reznor.) In a recent interview with GQ, Reznor and Ross said that they were asked by Guadagnino to create 'very loud techno music' for the soundtrack (Sony Music has just released a nine-track remix of their score). Reznor also noted that Guadagnino’s notes for them were 'all a variation' of three words: 'Unending homoerotic desire.'\"\n\nLiz Shannon Miller, Consequence\n\n\"Another filmmaker might have subtracted himself in order to foreground the story, whereas Guadagnino goes big, leading with style (and a trendy score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross). In keeping with the athletic theme, he does all kinds of wild things with the camera, including a composition framed from the umpire’s perspective mid-court that zooms along the net to find Tashi in the crowd. Occasionally, she and other characters smack the fluorescent yellow balls directly at the screen, making us flinch in our seats. By the end, 'Challengers' has assumed the ball’s POV -- or maybe it’s the racket’s -- as Guadagnino immerses audiences in the film’s climactic match.\"\n\nPeter Debruge, Variety\n\n\"This is one of the most ravenously sexy American movies in recent memory, an aspect fueled throughout by the hard-driving beats of a hypnotic techno score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, which recalls everything from disco-era Giorgio Moroder to the pulse-pounding EDM of the 21st century’s first two decades, when the story is set. Rather than grab a racket and hit the tennis court, this is a movie that makes you want to get up and dance. Sharp sound work is another essential element, capturing every thwack of the ball with visceral force.\"\n\nDavid Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter\n\nREBEL MOON - PART TWO: THE SCARGIVER - Tom Holkenborg\n\n\"Set to Tom Holkenborg’s bombastic score, Gregorian chanting, and endless pew-pew-pews, 'Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver' roars and rampages, yet its drama can’t match its aesthetic pomposity. A depressingly thin and lifeless saga of underdogs triumphing in the face of insurmountable odds, it trades only in formula and phony corner-cutting.\"\n\nNick Schager, The Daily Beast\n\n\"A Zack Snyder picture is like everything and nothing else in the galaxy. 'Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver,' the second half of the director’s hammering saga about a bucolic village at the fringes of the universe forced to fight off its imperial overlords, pulls from as many influences as there are stars in the sky. 'Star Wars,' of course (yes, there are light sabers), and also 'Mad Max,' Caravaggio, John Ford, European art-house cinema, World War II propaganda flicks, steampunk Victoriana, cottagecore girlies on Instagram and Wagner’s 'Götterdämmerung.' Not only does the score boast two types of choirs (haunted child and Gregorian), but a single frame might include a robot dressed like the Green Knight (and voiced by Anthony Hopkins) next to a Conan the Barbarian clone next to some guy in overalls who looks like he just flew in from Bonnaroo. A delirious, pulpy mishmash of knockoffs, 'The Scargiver' isn’t good, but it sure is something.\"\n\nAmy Nicholson, The New York Times\n\n\"And don’t get me wrong: If you want to watch space Nazis fire red laser beams at vaguely Scandinavian farm people during an interminable siege that’s staged with exactly none of the panache and enthusiasm that made even the worst of Snyder’s pre-streaming work feel distinct, you’ve come to the right place. This is the “Citizen Kane” of whatever that is. But first, you’ll have to sit through -- or scrub past -- a full hour of watching Djimon Hounsou, Bae Doona, and the rest of the film’s ensemble cast harvest wheat in slow-motion as the singers on Tom Holkenborg’s appropriately self-serious choral score wail over the soundtrack.\"\n\nDavid Ehrlich, IndieWire\n\n\"The inevitable arrives, and it is noisy, chaotic, excessively overcooked, and just as meaningless as 'Part One,' thus feels like an immense, loud, calamitously desperate attempt at making you care about something that never earned your concern in the first place. 'The Scargiver' is such an oddly distancing and out-of-body experience, with mournful music cues to make you feel sorrowful about something the movie forgot to make you care about. It’s full of huge, swelling grandiosity, and yet it’s all puffed up for nothing because it failed to connect you to its generic characters in its first attempt. All it can do is double down and hope for the best.\"\n\nRodrigo Perez, The Playlist\n\n\"Put 'Part One' and 'Part Two' together, and it’s clear that 'Rebel Moon' is a four-hour movie that could have been told in two hours. It’s not really 'epic' -- it’s just stretched-out. In the first half of 'Part Two,' most of which is set on the amber-waves-of-grain medieval farming moon of Veldt, the film just kind of sits there, treading grain, with a soundtrack of New Age Jungian music as the farmers harvest their crop and ready themselves for battle. There are flashbacks that shore up the characters’ valor and fill in the things they feel guilty about (like the fact that Kora, when she was a royal bodyguard and the adoptive daughter of the Imperium commander Balisarius, was ordered to assassinate Princess Issa). The gigantic Motherworld ship arrives just as it did last time, hovering over Veldt in broad daylight, only now Kora is prepared. She, along with Gunnar, infiltrate it in a mini-ship of their own. Once inside, she plants strategic explosives and seeks out her nemesis, and the film cuts to the battle below, which oscillates between rock ‘n’ roll sci-fi gunfire and hand-to-hand savagery and the immensely gratifying ain’t-that-a-kick-in-the-head sight of war ships blowing up from inside, all set to one of those neo-Hans Zimmer scores of droning dread.\"\n\nOwen Gleiberman, Variety\n\nTHE NEXT TEN DAYS IN L.A.\n\nScreenings of older films in Los Angeles-area theaters.\n\nMay 3\n\nBLACKHAT (Harry Gregson-Williams) [Vidiots]\n\nCARRIE (Pino Donaggio) [Vista]\n\nFEMALE TROUBLE [Nuart]\n\nTHE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Ennio Morricone) [Vista]\n\nHIGH AND LOW (Masaru Sato) [New Beverly]\n\nIDIOCRACY (Theodore Shapiro) [Egyptian]\n\nKILL BILL VOL. 1 (RZA) [New Beverly]\n\nMIRACLE MILE (Tangerine Dream) [alamo Drafthouse]\n\nOFFICE SPACE (John Frizzell) [Egyptian]\n\nRUBBER (Mr. Oizo) [Vidiots]\n\nTHE SEARCHERS (Max Steiner) [Aero]\n\nTALK TO ME (Cornel Wilczek) [Alamo Drafthouse]\n\nTAXI DRIVER (Bernard Herrmann) [New Beverly]\n\nTHE WAR OF THE ROSES (David Newman) [Vidiots]\n\nMay 4\n\nBADLANDS (George Aliceson Tipton) [Vidiots]\n\nBIG HERO 6 (Henry Jackman) [Vidiots]\n\nBILL & TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE (David Newman) [Alamo Drafthouse]\n\nBREAKING AWAY (Patrick Williams) [New Beverly]\n\nCARRIE (Pino Donaggio) [Vista]\n\nDUNE (Toto) [Vidiots]\n\nEASY A (Brad Segal) [New Beverly]\n\nTHE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Ennio Morricone) [Vista]\n\nHIGH AND LOW (Masaru Sato) [New Beverly]\n\nLOST IN YONKERS (Elmer Bernstein) [Los Feliz 3]\n\nMIRACLE MILE (Tangerine Dream) [Alamo Drafthouse]\n\nNEVER A DULL MOMENT (Robert F.
