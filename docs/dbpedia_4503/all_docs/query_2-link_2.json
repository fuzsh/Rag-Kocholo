        "text": "HOLLYWOOD -- Noted Hollywood composer Bronislaw Kaper, whose best-known songs included, 'Hi Lili, Hi Lo' and 'All God's Chillun Got Rhythm,' died Tuesday of cancer. He was 81.\n\nKaper, who was born in Warsaw and was a popular composer in Europe in the 30s, died at his Beverly Hills home.\n\nAmong his film scores during more than 30 years at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer were those for 'Red Badge of Courage,' 'Auntie Mame,' 'Somebody Up There Likes Me,' and 'Lili,' for which he won a 1953 Academy Award.\n\nMovie producer Louis B. Mayer spotted Kaper playing the piano in a Paris nightclub in 1935 and asked who had composed the song he was playing. When Kaper replied that he had written it, Mayer brought him to the United States.\n\nKaper is survived by a niece. His wife died several years ago. An MGM spokesman said there will be no funeral."
