        "text": "Transcript\n\nInterview\n\nEW: EDITH WYLE\n\nSE: SHARON EMANUELLI\n\nSE: This is an interview for the Archives of American Art, the Smithsonian Institution. The interview is with Edith R. Wyle, on March 9th, Tuesday, 1993, at Mrs. Wyle's home in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. The interviewer is Sharon K. Emanuelli. This is Tape 1, Side A. Okay, Edith, we're going to start talking about your early family background.\n\nEW: Okay.\n\nSE: What's your birth date and place of birth?\n\nEW: Place of birth, San Francisco. Birth date, are you ready for this? April 21st, 1918-though next to Beatrice [Wood-Ed.] that doesn't seem so old.\n\nSE: No, she's having her 100th birthday, isn't she?\n\nEW: Right.\n\nSE: Tell me about your grandparents. I guess it's your maternal grandparents that are especially interesting?\n\nEW: No, they all were. I mean, if you'd call that interesting. They were all anarchists. They came from Russia.\n\nSE: Together? All together?\n\nEW: No, but they knew each other. There was a group of Russians-Lithuanians and Russians-who were all revolutionaries that came over here from Russia, and they considered themselves intellectuals and they really were self-educated, but they were very learned. Some very famous people came out of that group in terms of artists and playwrights, different kinds of people. Musicians, many musicians.\n\nSE: Do you remember any of those names?\n\nEW: Well, Arthur Schwartz comes to mind, and he was a motion picture director, producer, wasn't he?\n\nSE: I don't really know.\n\nEW: Sidney Howard was another one. These are both in the motion picture world. I know they were out of that group. I'm trying to think of the. . . . Oh, dear. I'm having trouble with names lately, so I can't give you the names of some of them.\n\nSE: When did they come?\n\nEW: Oh, let's see, it must have been in the late 1800s [1880s?]. My mother was born in 1860, so it was before that, because she was born in America, and my two aunts, her sisters, were born over there, and then my father's parents also came around the same time. And they formed these Brodsva groups in New York, and they used to get together and read books, and sing songs for each other, play the piano for each other, violin, all the instruments, and it sounded like they had a marvelous time. And most of them were anarchists and had revolutionary discussions. And there were really two kinds of anarchists. There were the kinds that were the bomb throwers, and the ones who really just advocated changing things and doing away with legalities, but were not the bomb throwers. At least I can say that my half of the family were not the bomb throwers.\n\nSE: How did they feel about the United States? They just thought there were too many laws?\n\nEW: No, this was mostly a reaction to Russia, of course, but they carried that over to here, and they didn't believe in anything like legalized marriage. They were against that, and so they lived together as common-law husbands and wives, and I must say that they stuck together more than any contemporary people you can think about, except that there were love affairs going on, and I know that my grandmother on the paternal side was very much in love with. . . . Oh, god, what's his name now? Alexander Berkman. But anyhow he was supposed to kill Carnegie. And he missed. He planned to shoot him. Carnegie was gone, but Frick was there, and he wounded him.\n\nSE: Was Berkman a Russian also?\n\nEW: He was Russian, but he was upper class, and he was not a Jew, which my grandparents all were. However, they were also totally nonreligious. They didn't believe in organized religion, although I know that they started out by having to go to synagogue. I mean they lived in ghettos, so. . . .\n\nSE: As children they were raised religiously.\n\nEW: Yes, right, they had to. I've heard stories about my grandfather on the maternal side. . . . I heard most of these things from my mother. My father, whose family life I thought was even more interesting, didn't talk much, and I wish I'd gotten more information from him. But I know that one of the most famous anarchists, Johann Most, was on his side of the family. He did throw a bomb, I think. [chuckles] I'm not sure.\n\nSE: Here or in Russia?\n\nEW: Here, back East, and I remember when I was in high school taking a course in civics we had to write papers on well-known people in America and deliver them. Somebody chose Johann Most for his paper, and when I heard that I sat up with such pride thinking, \"Gee, that's my great uncle.\" He then began describing him as the worst criminal that ever lived. [laughter] So I did not own up to being related in any way, although I was not a blood relative anyhow. [laughs]\n\nSE: You don't think you were a blood relative?\n\nEW: Well, it's so mixed up when you don't have legal marriages. I might have been; I don't know. I really don't. Anyhow, music was something that meant a great deal to my grandparents.\n\nSE: Can you give me their names?\n\nEW: My mother's mother was named Edith-after whom I was named-or Yudif, as they call her in Russian. And her husband's name was Nathan Robinovitch, and I was named Edith after my grandmother and Natalie after my grandfather. And the other grandparents were. . . .\n\nSE: Do you know their last name?\n\nEW: Rubin. Well, it was Robinovich.\n\nSE: Both of them?\n\nEW: They went by the same name. Sorry. I don't know her maiden name. Robinovitch is all I know. On the paternal side, my grandmother's name was Anna and Minken was her maiden name. And they were called Rovinsky. But when he arrived at Ellis Island he changed it to Robinson to be American.\n\nSE: What was his first name?\n\nEW: Samuel. And an interesting side of that is that my father, Louis, when he became a musician, changed it back to Rovinsky, because it was a better name for a musician. But when he gave that up and became a dentist he changed it back to Robinson.\n\nSE: So your grandparents also were musicians?\n\nEW: No, they weren't musicians at all. They just loved music. They loved it. And it was so much a part of their lives that my mother has told me that her father insisted that she and her sister study instruments. My aunt Elena had to study the violin, and she was terrible at it apparently, according to my mother. And my mother, who was the youngest, studied the piano and was exceptional from the start. So my aunt Elena studied violin with the same teacher that my father studied with in New York. And my mother's father used to say, \"Why can't you play like Louis does?\" That's my father's name. He drove her crazy till he finally let her stop.\n\nSE: And that's how they met?\n\nEW: Well, they knew each other as small children.\n\nSE: Do you remember their teacher? Was he of any consequence?\n\nEW: Not that one, no, I don't. I wish I knew a lot more about all that, because I've been wanting to write their memoirs for the rest of our family. I've got all the available papers, but nothing really interesting has come out of it.\n\nSE: So your parents were then both musicians?\n\nEW: My parents became musicians. My mother. . . . Well, my mother was orphaned by the time she was ten. Both her parents died of pulmonary diseases. My mother was orphaned at ten, and I lost my grandparent on the paternal side by the time I was ten. Okay. I'd better stick with the grandmother on the maternal side to begin with. Mother's parents had started. . . . The father started a dairy, as he called it, which was a shop in New York City, and Mother loved to reminisce about how immaculately clean it always was and how he was. . . . He was a hard taskmaster apparently, but she adored him. He was going blind. She read all the classics to him, all the Russian classics to him every night. Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Gogol, etc. This at the age of eight years. She was gorgeous. She was exquisite-a very beautiful child, and the pampered baby of the family. She had piano lessons. Nathan had saved enough money, when he knew he was going to die, that was put aside for the three girls, and they made an arrangement with another family that was in this group (which I think was called a Brodsva). The people were the Siebel family, S-i-e-b-e-l. They were close friends, and they planned to take the three children and the trust fund would help to support them, and also help maintain the Siebel family, so the three girls unfortunately had to move in with them.\n\nSE: What was your mother's name?\n\nEW: My mother's name was Rose.\n\nSE: Rose Robinson?\n\nEW: Well, it was Rosalia Clementivna Robinovitch in the beginning. [laughs] But of course it became just Rose Rubin. She was very unhappy living in that house. She had to share a bed with one of the daughters of the house, who was very big and fat. Mother claimed that she was like Cinderella there. She was doing all the cleaning and dish washing and all that stuff all the time, and there was nothing but misery there. One day she managed to get hold of a quarter or a nickel or something and she went. . . . [Interruption in taping]\n\nEW: Anyhow, I was always intrigued by this story because she took the nickel and took the streetcar, trolley-they lived uptown New York-and she took the trolley downtown to the New York Conservatory of Music (now Julliard) and walked in. A lady saw her and asked, \"What are you here for, little girl?\" She answered, \"I'm here because I want to have a scholarship.\" I can't believe Mother did this.\n\nSE: At what age? Like twelve?\n\nEW: Ten. And they said, \"Well, the trials for scholarships are over for this year, but if you'd like to see the man that. . . .\" I think he headed the school-I'm not sure. Alexander Lambert, who was a very famous musician-more of a teacher, wrote many books on the piano. He was very well known. He knew all the great artists in the music world. They gave her his address, and she took herself to his house, which was a big brownstone on Lexington Avenue. She rang the doorbell, and made the same speech. \"I want a scholarship.\" And he said, \"I don't give scholarships. I don't teach much. Come in and play for me anyhow.\" So she did, and he said, \"Well, I'll tell you what. I will give you three lessons a week if your sister will pay for one.\" Her older sister had a job being a dress designer at that moment. \"If she can pay for two of them or one of them,\" or something like that. And her sister, of course, said she would, so Mother started studying with Alexander Lambert. And she became something like his ward. I mean, he really raised her. She used to perform for all the world-famous pianists, such as Paderewski and Joseph Hoffmann. Those people came to his parties all the time. Lambert would have her perform. He then became upset about the middy blouses and skirts she wore and dressed her for the concerts. He took her to Carnegie Hall to the concerts. When she was older she fell in love with my father, but passionately. He was in California at this point, in San Francisco, and Mother went to visit him. He suggested that they get married. When she told Lambert this he was not happy at all about it. But she made her choice and she came out to San Francisco where they were legally married. This upset his parents a great deal, to think that they would get legally married. And it certainly made me happy when I found it out later on. Anyhow, by this time my father was a professional musician, and he was very good. I think he was. . . . Most people seemed to think that he, as a musician, was probably better than Mother, although I thought she was superb also. She really was a fine pianist-not like a lot of women pianists I've heard who sort of slither around the piano, but she always had a firm, wonderful touch and a sensitivity that I thought was marvelous.\n\nSE: Did she ever play professionally?\n\nEW: Oh, yes, they both did. They played together a lot, and had tremendous battles, because they always were interpreting the music differently. And they loved chamber music. I grew up with chamber music in the house, which was one of the really great recollections of my life. I loved going to bed as a little child and hearing it in the living room. And they always had fine musicians and composers who came to the house for music. But my father was the first viola of the San Francisco Philharmonic, and for a while he was the concertmaster as well.\n\nSE: Do you remember what period of time this was?\n\nEW: I was born.\n\nSE: So it was in the twenties, teens or twenties?\n\nEW: Oh, no, it was in the. . . . Began probably around 1920, 1919.\n\nSE: The twenties, right?\n\nEW: When I was on the Board of Cal Arts, there was another trustee by the name of Alan Becker. He's probably still on the board at Cal Arts. He's a developer in San Francisco, and he was elected head of the Art Archives of San Francisco. I once told him about my dad having been with the San Francisco Symphony, and so one day he decided to look up some of the programs from that period in the Archives. Oh, he was also in a quartet called the Persinger String Quartet. That was equivalent of being in the Budapest today, or the Julliard, you know; it was a very famous quartet. Louis Persinger was the man who taught Yehudi Menuhin, from childhood up. And getting into that quartet was a real coup.\n\nSE: What was Persinger's first name?\n\nEW: Louis, same as my dad's. And Dad was a member of the quartet for quite a while. But he was concerned about the lack of security, him being a musician, and he always had really wanted to be a doctor. He always claimed that his parents, his mother, who was a real. . . . She was a matriarch and she insisted on his being a violinist. I always admired her a lot. I used to try to fashion myself after her. My mother just hated her, however, because of the tight hold she had on my dad. [laughter] But I thought she sounded like a great gal. She was. . . . Well, I think the reason that I liked her so much is that she had two sets of Ibsen. I still have one of those sets, and, I mean, I'd open them up and find pressed flowers in the pages. She knew every word of Pushkin by heart, of all his works. And these kinds of things really impressed me a great deal. But she really had an Oedipal thing with her son and made life very miserable for my mother. So anyhow, Dad decided that he needed more security. He knew he couldn't afford the time to learn to be a doctor. But he could be a dentist, so he got a job with, I believe, the Geary Theater, which is still there in San Francisco. It was either the Geary or the Curran. It was one of the two of those, and I think it was the Geary. Conducting the orchestra. That was a legitimate theater, with plays including Ethel Barrymore, etc. He conducted at night. He could go to dental college during the day, University of California. He did his research, his studying, in the green room during intermissions-or while the play was in progress. He went through dental college that way. This was after I was born. A very funny story about his college studies is that when they were taking the last final exam in dental college he was unable to take it with the rest of the students because of a concert at that particular time; so he had special permission to make up this test by himself at another date. Well, when the rest of the students in his class went in the professor told them the honor system would be in effect as they identified things with microscopes. The professor left the room, and the students began comparing notes immediately, which, of course, they were not supposed to do. When he came back in and found out that they were doing this, the entire class was flunked-except my father because he wasn't there.\n\nSE: That's great.\n\nEW: However, he was very good as well, and they tried to get him to stay and become a professor in the college, but he didn't, which is too bad.\n\nSE: Well, he probably felt the pressure to earn a better living.\n\nEW: No, the reason for that was his family got in the way again. They were living in L.A. at this time, and my grandfather had gone into the insurance business and was doing very, very well. Aetna Insurance, you remember. And he persuaded my dad to come down and go into the insurance business with him, which was a terrible mistake. My father was no business man at all, and we moved down here.\n\nSE: Do you remember what year that was?\n\nEW: Well, I must have been about five or six. I was six years old when we moved down here. Right, six. And that did not last long. He decided he had to get back into being a dentist, but even there he was not a good business man, though he was an excellent dentist. Building up a practice was difficult. And then the Depression began to creep in, and they really had a hard time. So he began playing in the studios at night as a musician. Now there all the very cream of the musicians also played in the studioes, and as long as I can remember of his life, that's what Dad did: played in the studios at night. When he started there were no unions, and so they could call him at any hour of the night. At two in the morning they'd call and say \"Get here,\" and he would have to go, and then he'd have to go in his office the next day and be a dentist, which was a killer. And why I think he didn't live a very long life, actually. When there was finally a musicians' union it was much better, and then he worked largely for one person: Alfred Newman, who was well known, Al Newman. For years he was the first violin there and/or violist. With. . . . United Artists was where Alfred Newman was primarily. And at one point he [EW's father-Ed.] was the conductor himself, and he went on location to Canada with some film company. I can't remember. But George Brent and Lois Moran were actors in the film. Mother taught piano to make a living-a lot. But the pleasure they had was in the chamber music, and then they did sometimes prepare musicals when I was growing up and had people over, and that was amazing.\n\nSE: They did musicals in your home?\n\nEW: They would have them at home, and those were great because we had a long living room that extended like that, like this [gesturing-Trans.], and they would set up chairs. Mother was a fantastic cook. She was the best cook. Anybody that knew her will agree with me. They used to send their cooks over to be trained by her because she was really very good, and I. . . . In fact, I'm going to give you some schnecken for lunch, which I'm testing, which I sent for because they said it was the best I'll have ever eaten, and that was what she made and I want to see if they're as good. . . . I don't think there's anything that was as good as what she used to make.\n\nSE: Not in your memory, I'm sure.\n\nEW: Right. And she had insomnia-and migraines. I grew up with both of those things. As an only child, that was a big burden, because when she had a migraine if you were in the front of the house-and it was a long house-when she was sick in bed in the back, if I tiptoed I was making too much noise. We had to talk in whispers, and it happened so frequently. The only thing that would help her was morphine occasionally, and she was just a wreck from it. When she didn't sleep, I could always tell that she hadn't slept if I smelled schnecken that was being baked in the kitchen, which she would do during the night. But I also knew that I had to be careful of what I said to her, because anything could lead to an argument and we had plenty of them. She and I fought a lot all during my growing up period. She was a perfectionist. The house was microscopically clean and. . . . I felt as though I could never do anything right, ever. That was my entire. . . . I felt like I was the bad example the whole time I was growing up for all the other children that were around.\n\nSE: I'm sure not to their parents, only to you.\n\nEW: I couldn't play the piano as well as some of the children, and things like that, couldn't sew. Another thing is that she made all my clothes, and later on wove the material for some beautiful garments.\n\nSE: Oh, my goodness.\n\nEW: She was very good. She was a very capable and gifted lady.\n\nSE: So is that your first introduction to. . . .\n\nEW: Textiles?\n\nSE: . . . textiles?\n\nEW: Well, when she got around to weaving I was grown up. I think I even had gotten married when she started studying weaving, and I know she made a beautiful evening skirt for me. She then wove two little herringbone coats with velvet, and tailored them for me. She knew how to tailor. She tailored them for Nancy and Diana, my daughters, when they were little. And I can remember them. I wish I'd kept them. In fact, I can't understand how I didn't keep those coats. They were beautiful. And I had, as you can probably gather, a really ambivalent relationship-real love-hate one with her. Because she was a fascinating woman also, and she was very self-educated because she dropped out before graduating from high school because Alexander Lambert pulled her out. And so most of the things that she knew she taught herself, and retained what she learned. She retained things in a way that I envy, because I don't retain. I was an English major. I remember that when I was in college the first couple of years, when I was in college down here at UCLA, she took a lot of the same classes.\n\nSE: How interesting.\n\nEW: And read a lot of the same books, and she was remarkable at that.\n\nSE: Did that bother you that she did?\n\nEW: I don't think so, though I must have been jealous of her retentive abilities. And I don't know if you remember; she used to show up at some of the lectures at The Egg and the Eye. No, this was before your. . . .\n\nSE: I think she came to a few in the early days.\n\nEW: But way back she came to them, and she used to always ask questions and I used to get embarrassed, as I always got embarrassed with Mother. Mother always embarrassed me.\n\nSE: Because her questions weren't. . . .\n\nEW: No, because she was much. . . . First of all, she was very demonstrative, very Russian in this way, and I'm not. My father and I were not. I've always kept it inside and so had he, and I always thought that was much better.\n\nSE: So you felt she was just too dramatic and. . . .\n\nEW: And Mother, she would have a tremendous migraine headache, and we'd all be worrying about her and there would be a party in the evening that I would be invited to. This happened to a lot of them that I wasn't invited to, I'm sure, but I'm thinking of some that I went to. She'd get dressed up and look beautiful, go to this party, and become the life of the party because she felt it was her duty, she used to tell me. \"I have to do that; I can't. . . .\" But it wasn't her duty at all.\n\nSE: Do you mean it helped her forget the migraines?\n\nEW: Whatever it was, when she was home we suffered; when we got there, she was a flirt. My father was number one as far as she was concerned. She always, always loved him enormously, but my father had his. . . . Apparently he had a few affairs when I was very little. I'm not aware of it. He was very handsome. They were a handsome couple. They were very beautiful. And he was tall and when he had hair, he had red, curly hair.\n\nSE: That's where you got your red hair, then.\n\nEW: Yes, I got it from him. I look like him. I used to want to be like him in every possible way. I tried to even write. . . . My handwriting is as close to his as I could get it. My mother used to say that probably the reason that he looked so good all the time in my eyes is because I saw so little of him. That may be so, but I worshipped him. I always did. As many daughters do with their fathers I guess.\n\nSE: Did you do special things with him?\n\nEW: Not a great deal, no. We were together as a threesome a great deal. We went to concerts together. I loved music. I always loved it. I was not good at the piano at all. I studied piano, because I had to. Not with them, not with her, but with a person who lived on the other side of the street-behind our house rather. I used to go through a hedge and get to her house from the back, I remember. And I was just not good, and I wanted to be, but I. . . . I'm sure that there was an emotional problem that got in my way, and when I would come to practice I'd sit down at the piano and all of a sudden I'd hear from the back of the house, \"E flat!\" and the two of them would rush in and sit on either side of me and show me. They couldn't stand what they heard. That's probably why. . . .\n\nSE: So even he was not so forgiving in that regard.\n\nEW: Yes, it drove them both crazy hearing me practice. So I was very thankful when I was able to stop. But my interest at that time became dance. I knew I had to have some art. Art was our lives. I mean all we saw, all I met, in my whole growing up period, were either musicians or medical people-because dad began to be friendly with a lot of doctors too, but mostly it was people in the art world in some way.\n\nSE: Do you remember any of the names from that time?\n\nEW: Well, they were musicians.\n\nSE: You don't remember any musicians of note that were around a lot?\n\nEW: Yes, well, this is when I was already in my teens: Ernst Toch, composer, became a good friend of theirs. Another composer was. . . . Brodislaw Kaper used to come. Oh, what happened. . . . When Toscanini began doing his NBC, was it? It was NBC, wasn't it?\n\nSE: I don't remember.\n\nEW: Symphony. CBS or NBC, I can't remember which it was. [NBC Symphony-Ed.] They broadcast his concerts, and I think it was on a Thursday night they used to do it in their entirety, the whole concert from the New York Philharmonic. It was a big deal. We made a big deal out of it in our house, and we used to have people over. And I was in college, a freshman, around that time. I used to invite a lot of my friends, and they would invite people that they knew, and Brodislaw Kaper used to come to them all the time.\n\nEW: He's been many Oscared, a motion picture composer. And another one was David Raksin, who is now a friend of mine, who was brought here by Charlie Chaplin to do the arranging for Modern Times, that film?\n\nSE: Yes.\n\nEW: He was just a young genius, a very brilliant kid, whom dad brought over, and has since become well known in Hollywood. Dad was in the orchestra and got to meet him. He got to know Chaplin pretty well, too, but not to bring over.\n\nSE: And Raksin came from the East?\n\nEW: Chaplin brought him from New York to do this, and he stayed after that. So there were a lot of people like that he used to bring-film people, whose names I don't remember.\n\nSE: Daniel Selsnick used to be on the [Craft & Folk Art Museum] board. Were you friendly with his family before then or. . . .\n\nEW: No. My best friend when I was. . . . Oh, I had a cousin on my father's side. His cousin actually, first cousin, who was an artist, commercial artist. Alice is her name.\n\nSE: Alice Robinson?\n\nEW: Alice Rovinsky. She kept that. Her father was a physician, Alexander Rovinsky. That was my paternal grandfather's brother.\n\nSE: What did he do?\n\nEW: He was a physician, the great uncle, who was married to a woman that was also a physician. Bedona was her name. And then there was another sister whose name was Belle and was married to Will Robins. The names are all similar. And Uncle Will was a civil engineer who lived in China and did a lot of work on the railroads in China, I'm told. Their house was filled with really ugly Chinese furniture that they brought back, but it was the worst kind, you know. And Aunt Belle used to strike me as being one of the dullest people that I ever knew. All of us felt that way. She was one of those kinds of people who came and sat and didn't open her mouth in the house.\n\nSE: And Alice, what did she do?\n\nEW: Second cousin. She was the daughter of Bedona and Alexander Rovinsky. I'm filling in on my grandfather's side. I'm sorry.\n\nSE: That's all right. And Alexander Rovinsky was your great uncle. So what did Alice do?\n\nEW: Alice was an artist, a commercial artist. She went to the Art Institute in New York, and then she eventually found her way to Paris, where she managed to live for twenty years. She was really a nutty person. She was going back and forth all the time. She once came back on a boat from Paris to borrow money so that she could continue to stay in Paris. Also, she was the kind of person who did not know how to live with success. She achieved the editorship of a very fine fashion magazine back there, and then quit as soon as she got it, and came back and settled in L.A., where she brought her mother eventually, after her father had died. She [the mother] was very diabetic and Alice took care of her like a nurse. It ruled Alice's life, and eventually Alice moved to Palm Springs and lived-and died. I've scattered her ashes at our ranch, to which she never came, unfortunately. But Alice was there in Paris and she used to suggest to my parents that they should send me over to be with her. I was dying to be with her in Paris. I used to love it when she came to our house when I was little, because she would draw for me. She drew princesses in beautiful gowns and all that sort of thing, and I wanted to be an artist like she was. My first thoughts were to be an illustrator of children's books, which probably I should have stuck to. But I didn't. Anyhow, that was one artist of that type that was around us quite a bit.\n\nSE: But you never went to stay with her?\n\nEW: They never allowed me to do that. They had another friend, who was Francis Tour. This was in San Francisco, and I don't really remember her because I was very little. I don't understand how this could have happened. I must have seen her later on in life also. She went to Mexico when it was not done and lived in Mexico City and became very close friends with Diego Rivera, and the entire art world became her beat. And she published a little magazine for a long period of time about them, which she sent us, and then she wrote a book called Folkways of Mexico.\n\nSE: Do you have those?\n\nEW: I don't have the magazines anymore, but I've got the Folkways of Mexico book. It's at the ranch, but I have her book still. But everybody knows her. I mean, if you mention her name to anybody. . . .\n\nSE: It's very familiar to me.\n\nEW: Francis Tour in Mexico. They all know her name. She also wanted me to come and stay with her. And I can remember that one well. I remember having fights with my parents because they wouldn't let me go, but they thought I was too young. I was too young probably, but I never got to do that.\n\nSE: But by then everybody. . . . I mean those two women obviously realized that you were interested in art.\n\nEW: I don't know why, but they did.\n\nSE: So as a child you were pretty involved in art?\n\nEW: I always drew a lot, though. I did draw a lot.\n\nSE: You were an only child. And weren't you alone a lot?\n\nEW: A lot. Yes. I was. And lonesome, and was desperate to have a brother or a sister. I can remember once being taken to an orphanage, not realizing that my parents took me there because they were making a contribution of some sort. I think they gave a concert there. I thought they just weren't telling me, but that they were going to bring home a brother or a sister for me. And even I remember the tantrum I had when I found out it wasn't so. I threw myself on the floor and kicked my feet and went through. . . . But anyhow there was one side of it that I always considered good, and that was that I had time to fantasize and to be alone, and as much as I hated being an only child, I loved that alone period that I had. And we had a vacant lot next door to our house. You've heard of those, haven't you?\n\nSE: Yes, we had a few. I got picked up by the police in one once when I was in fourth grade.\n\nEW: Oh, you had them of course where you lived. And anyhow that vacant lot was my domain and I used to have imaginary villages that I made out of rocks. I remember everything about that. I mean, that was heaven for me. I just loved it. And I remember that the one little girl that I played with, who lived across the street who was about a year younger than I was, when I got friendly with her I used to allow her to come and try to share in that, but she couldn't, so we did other things together. We did plays for each other.\n\nSE: And then the polio epidemic came.\n\nEW: Oh, she was the one that had that, yes. Frances Wilson was her name, and when the polio epidemic came. . . . We played across the street from each other. We used to play house across the street from each other.\n\nSE: Calling back and forth.\n\nEW: Called back and forth, right, because we couldn't be next to each other, and she got it. She got polio and she died of it right after I got married. I can remember that on my wedding night I was very happy and in love with Frank, and I broke into tears when we arrived at the hotel. Frank couldn't understand why, but I began thinking about Frances and how my life turned out to be so very wonderful and hers was. . . . She was all strapped up and couldn't move and died very soon thereafter, I guess. And the comparison was so sad.\n\nSE: So in terms of art, when did you start doing that more?\n\nEW: Well, I had another friend that, when I was fourteen, became my best friend. When she first was introduced to me through other friends of my parents who were in advertising. . . . There was a whole circle of people. Well, they were. . . . It was a Mayer. . . . I don't know. They were very. . . . I can't describe what they were. All their friends had children that were much younger than I was, and so that I could never really be a part of that group either. Those children have all stuck together and still are friendly now, but I was too old to be a part of that. But nevertheless we were very close to a lot of families that had businesses and did other things. And the Mayers had an advertising business, I remember.\n\nSE: You were telling about a friend that was introduced to you.\n\nEW: Oh, Doris Herold was my friend. Don was her father, and he was well known throughout the country. Everybody knew him as a cartoonist. The magazine that came before the New Yorker was Life magazine. It was called Life I think, but it was like the New Yorker. It was not like the Life magazine of today. And Judge. There was one called Judge, too, I believe. They were. . . . Anyhow, he was a cartoonist for those magazines. His drawings were easily recognized as Don Herold's; he was nationally well known. And they thought that we could be good friends because we. . . . But she went to John Burroughs Junior High and I went to Thomas Star King, which was across the city. We were sort of forced to spend weekends together and I didn't like her and she didn't like me at all. She thought I was a sissy, prudish little girl and she was a real tomboy type. She also drew very well, by the way. She inherited her father's ability. And one weekend I was forced to spend the weekend with her, which I really hated, but I found there was place that made rock candy that looked like rocks. And I brought her some and I put a real rock in there. [laughter] She bit on one and almost broke her teeth, and she was so filled with admiration for my spunk in doing that that she became my devoted best friend. We were best friends for years after that. That did it. [laughter]\n\nSE: Hysterical.\n\nEW: And we became awful. I mean, when she came over we were always playing tricks and doing things, and she has a much better memory than I. I wish that I could get a hold. . . . I don't know what's happened to her. I gave her up in later years, but. . . . She later started writing some stories about our childhood, and she has total recall. She wrote children's books, and then Doris was taken East and went to the Lincoln School. They moved back east, and I was just desolate when she left, the fact that she left L.A. and I was here, and she was there. Her letters were fantastic because she was going to wonderful dances and. . . . It was a private school, the Lincoln School, off Fifth Avenue or Riverside Drive, somewhere. I don't know. The whole thing was very glamorous to me, and so I missed her a great deal. But we kept up very close friendship. She went to Swarthmore College. She was very bright, and had a younger sister named Hildegard, Hilde. They were both redheads. Hilde was the attractive, really pretty one, but \"Dordee,\" as we called her, was not as pretty-not pretty, but had red hair and was very bright and had a great figure, which I envied, and she knew how to draw anything. She became an artist. She had a job right off the bat with Young and Rubicam and. . . .\n\nSE: In New York.\n\nEW: In New York. And they used to have the Ivory Soap ads up on the billboards. They were all Doris's. She did all those kinds of things. And then she illustrated lots of books-children's books. At that time, you couldn't write and illustrate the same book unless you were somebody like Sendak. I think that is. . . .\n\nSE: That's still difficult.\n\nEW: Yes, still difficult. So she was an illustrator primarily. Or she was a writer and didn't illustrate. I guess she did some of each, but never both. . . .\n\nSE: Oh, one or the other. She did both, but never in the same book.\n\nEW: Then she got married to a guy named Sidney Lund. They lived in Rowayton, Connecticut, and if she's alive she may still live there. They had three children, and the oldest one was named Meredith. They called her Muffy. And that's how Muffy Palmer, by the way, got her name. You know, the Herbert and Lillian Palmers? You probably know.\n\nSE: Yeah.\n\nEW: I named her after this. . . .\n\nSE: But she doesn't use Muffy. Oh, no, you named her Meredith, not Muffy.\n\nEW: Well, I suggested Meredith and that they could call her Muffy for short, which they did.\n\nSE: Oh, she doesn't use it now.\n\nEW: She doesn't care if people like me call her Muffy, because I can't think of her any other way.\n\nSE: Herbert and Lillian Palmer? Lillian's her mother.\n\nEW: I was matron of honor at their wedding. She wanted to name her daughter after me, so Meredith included Edith. I think it had something to do with that.\n\nSE: Great. Doris and Sydney Lund had Meredith and anybody else?\n\nEW: Yeah, they had a son named Eric, and then they had two others and I can't remember the other two daughters' names. Or one daughter. I can't remember. And incidentally, Meredith [Lund] is an artist. And one's a pianist. I don't remember, but Doris has had all kinds of trouble with Sydney. He became an alcoholic, and every time I went to New York I had to spend hours hearing about her problems, and then she began having an affair and living with this other guy, who was an artist, and they came out here and you may have met her, because she was here once.\n\nSE: What's his name?\n\nEW: I can't remember his name. But they stayed with me, and I remember I was on the Board of Cal Arts already, because I took her to listen to some panel. Nathan Shapira once had a panel discussion about something to do with Africa or art at the Craft and Folk Art Museum [CAFAM]. And I was on it, and she was there in the audience listening because she was my house guest at that time. Well, anyhow, that's the last time I've seen her, I think. I've lost touch with her.\n\nSE: Do you want to go back? You started talking about your interest in dance.\n\nEW: Yes, let's go way back.\n\nSE: You talked about getting interested in dance as a child when you were able to give up piano.\n\nEW: Yes, oh. I began taking dancing lessons and I loved it and I thought it was wonderful. My parents didn't. I mean, that was a very much lesser art in their eyes, so they wouldn't pay much attention to it, but Doris Herold and I took dancing-ballet lessons-together from Eleanor Putnam, and I think that my major thing was that I got such a crush on Eleanor Putnam. It was mostly because I had the crush on Eleanor. We spent most of our time comparing our arches [laughter], and the excitement of the first toe shoes and all that business. Eleanor Putnam was a Christian Scientist, and she lived in Glendale and I decided that I would become a Christian Scientist. She picked me up on Sundays and took me to the Christian Science Sunday School, and then took me home afterwards and that gave me a chance to be with Eleanor.\n\nSE: And your parents?\n\nEW: And my parents did nothing but ridicule. I mean, they didn't care what I did. They thought it was funny that I needed to go to a Sunday School, because they didn't believe in it. I mean we didn't go to anything. I went, and I used to think that I was a Christian Scientist, and if I put \"mind over matter\" I could pass my algebra tests, but when I flunked them I quit. [laughter]\n\nSE: Did that mean you didn't study, too?\n\nEW: That's true. I was a terrible student. I was a very bad student in school, and I know that a lot of emotional reasons were behind this, because I found out later on I could become a good one. I've a had family of late developers. Stephen [Wyle-Ed.] was that way, and I see that Alex is, who has just been. . . . My granddaughter, you know. She's just been elected to the honor society at Cal Poly in graduate school, but she called up and said, you want to hear something. . . .\n\nSE: Cal Poly?\n\nEW: She's getting her Master's in Animal Science there. And she's going to vet school next year. She went to Colby actually, undergraduate. She went from being a total nonstudent to now being a 4-point something student.\n\nSE: In a difficult field.\n\nEW: Yeah.\n\nSE: So how did dance continue?\n\nEW: Dance, well, they had no use for that and. . . .\n\nSE: What age were you at this point?\n\nEW: Well, I think that I was just getting to, I was going through puberty around that time.\n\nSE: Thirteen, maybe-twelve, thirteen.\n\nEW: I went to camp a lot in the summers and I was. . . . I had a hard time with that changeover. I remember that. I don't have to go through this whole camp thing.\n\nSE: No.\n\nEW: I went to eight of them, however.\n\nSE: [giggles]\n\nEW: And it was a good thing that they sent me to camp, I suppose, because it gave me a chance to live with other children; but some of them were pretty awful. One of them was very good though, but most of them weren't very good. I didn't get to do trips with [my parents] of any sort, except mother used to, when I was a little girl, take me back and forth like a commuter to New York. She felt she had to be with her sisters all the time. She was very tied to them and wanted to care for them because they were worse off than she was. One sister never married, but had a lifelong affair with a married Catholic. A real back street situation. In those days that's what it was.\n\nSE: Well, with dance, did that. . . .\n\nEW: I gave up ballet. I knew I wasn't going to be very good at that, and I'm trying to remember how I got to Benjamin Zemach, but he was a big deal in my life.\n\nSE: He was a dance teacher?\n\nEW: He was a dancer, and he was a well known dancer.\n\nSE: Modern?\n\nEW: Oh, before I got to Zemach I studied dancing with a woman named Bertha Wardell. That's right. I can't remember the kind of dancing, but it wasn't ballet strictly. It was everything. In fact, she taught me a Russian dance, and my mother made me a Russian costume, and it was a recital in which I wore that. And it was beautiful. Later on I embroidered that costume for Nancy and Diana's bedroom, a picture that now is at the ranch in Sonia's [Romero-Ed.] room.\n\nSE: Oh, I see, you made a picture of it in embroidery for their room.\n\nEW: Of a person, and I embroidered it, right. Anyhow, I studied with Bertha Wardell for quite a while, and I liked that. And then I studied with Myra Kinch. I think she may have studied with Bertha Wardell and then began to teach, and I loved studying with Myra Kinch. And they [EW's parents] drove me. . . . They humored me. They never took my dance lessons seriously, which upset me. I think in those days I wanted to be an actress and a dancer, and I put on plays all time. We were constantly putting on plays, and I would get. . . . We had a mother's helper/maid-type person named Adelaide Slowensky, who was with us for years. And she moved slowly, too. I mean, spoke slowly. [laughs] I used to drag poor Adelaide into all those plays, and we'd put on performances for everybody. This was Frances Wilson across the street or Doris Herold when she was around. [break]\n\nEW: Yes, and that was while I was in junior high school.\n\nSE: Okay.\n\nEW: Then I think through Myra Kinch I must have learned about Benjamin Zemach. That's the only way I can seem to remember hearing about him. He was a man that came over from Russia with his brother, who was Nathan Zemach and they had been with the. . . . I think it's called the Habima, which is the Jewish branch of the Moscow Art Theater, and they were famous for their production of The Dybbuk, which is a well-known classical Jewish play. I think that Benjamin Zemach danced in it. Nathan directed. That was their original claim to fame. And dance became something. . . . It was modern dance, but he wasn't glued to the earth. I liked his method of dancing at the time very, very much, because he believed in leaping and getting off the ground and not being held to the floor as it seemed to me that Lester Horton was, who was at that time in the next studio, and his chief dancer was Bella Lewitsky. She was in that room at the same time that I was with Benji all those years. I spent years studying with Benjamin Zemach.\n\nSE: How long?\n\nEW: Well, all through high school, and I loved it. I was the. . . . There were a couple of professional chances. Well, the first exciting one was that he was asked to do a ballet at the Hollywood Bowl, and I was able to be in that; but I was the youngest person of all his students that were asked to be in it. I became the scapegoat, and he was just merciless with me when they had rehearsals with the whole L.A. Philharmonic up there. He would stop everything and point to me and say, \"Edith, go home.\" [spoken in dialect-Trans.] [laughter] He'd had it because I did something wrong, and I can still remember wondering how I got off that stage, my shame was so awful. I'd be sitting in the box getting my stuff together and he's suddenly turn around and say, \"What's the matter with you? Why aren't you up there? Get up there.\" Anyhow this kept on so much, after rehearsals I used to come home crying and my parents said, \"Why do you put up with this? Why do you go? Why do you stand for this?\" And I began to think that maybe they were right. I stayed home from the class once, and he phoned me, so I told him, \"I guess I'm terrible because you yell at me so much,\" and he said, \"Don't you know that I only do that with people I'm interested in?\" So, I decided I'd made it. I was all right after that.\n\nSE: [laughs] He gave you a lot of attention.\n\nEW: And I even began to notice that that was so. So at one point, after the Victory Ball, which was such a success-that was the ballet we did at the Bowl, in which I played the part of a dead soldier. I can still remember the steps of that thing we rehearsed so much and so long. I mean it was day and night forever. All over town we were placed in halls that were hired so we could rehearse. And he had some top dancers who all became. . . . Most of them went into Martha Graham's group after that.\n\nSE: And stuck to the earth.\n\nEW: And stuck to the earth more, yes. But. . . . And Carmelita Maracci was also teaching up there at the time. She was the pure ballet, superb teacher. Carmelita was a fantastic, fiery, wonderful ballet dancer, and fantastic teacher, and I'm just telling you that it's interesting that we were all up at the Perry Studios in Hollywood, which became a pretty well-known place. I've bumped into so many people that were there, and I didn't know it, at the same time that I was.\n\nSE: Did you know Bella and Lester Horton?\n\nEW: I saw Bella. She was his prime dancer then. She's the same age I am.\n\nSE: It was in what part of Hollywood?\n\nEW: It was on Cahuenga and Hollywood, between Hollywood Boulevard and Franklin. I went there so much that I can tell you. Because later on I went with Diana, who studied with Carmelita.\n\nSE: Your daughter.\n\nEW: That was her teacher. But I found out then years later that Judith Stark. . . . Remember Judith?\n\nSE: Yes.\n\nEW: She was Milton Stark's wife. She was on our board. She was also on the Cal Arts board when I was.\n\nSE: Milton Stark. What does he do?\n\nEW: They started (founded) the Vanguard Theatre. Anyhow, I found out that Judith was in Horton's class at the same time that I was in Zemach's. She was trying to be a dancer as well.\n\nSE: Was Horton more grounded and less aerial?\n\nEW: He was the one that was more grounded. I thought he was too sexual, too. I mean, it seemed to me that they were all over each other all the time. I didn't like that. I loved Zemach. I thought he was great, and I was completely devoted to the dance. That's all I cared about in life. I loved going out with some of the dancers afterwards so that we could do nothing but talk about Zemach, and all the other dance concerts and things to which I went, and I kept scrapbooks and I still have all their programs somewhere around. I saved every program of every dance performance that came. And at the same time, I think inside me I had a suspicion that I wasn't very, wasn't great, could never really be good, but I thought. . . . I wanted to be in a group. Just around that time Max Rhinehart came to America, and he was going to do A Midsummer Night's Dream in New York City for the stage. He contacted Zemach and hired him as choreagrapher. Zemach took with him his small group, professional group that he had formed, in which I had recently been inducted. I was in high school. And once again my parents stepped in and said, \"Forget it. You're not gonna leave and go to New York for that,\" so I couldn't go to be in it. But, well, I was too young. I really was too young.\n\nSE: Your mom couldn't go along?\n\nEW: No. I just had to stay home and study. [laughter] And try to get into college, which was very iffy.\n\nSE: What theater did he stage it at?\n\nEW: It was on Broadway. It was a big, big, big, well known at the time production of Max Rhinehart's. Anyhow, that's it. So when he took his group back to New York for that, I think after that, that's when many from the group joined Martha Graham's group. Anyhow, so I had to give up being in the group. When Zemach returned much later, I studied with him some more until he finally moved to New York and decided to leave there. I went on to college. I took dancing in high school, and felt they didn't appreciate how good I was. Also in college; the dance recital at UCLA was a big deal and they only took the pretty ones for most major roles. But I was in the dance recital while I was at UCLA, and that's where I met Bob Lee, who was a professor of costume design. Robert Tyler Lee. He was teaching there, and he also danced and he designed the costumes for dance recital, and in those days people came from all over the city to see the yearly dance recitals that Martha Dean put on-she was the head of that department. I was in it, but I wasn't stellar. That was when I was sure that they didn't understand how really good I was, and not just like these others who were performing, but without passion and expertise. But I had some good roles, and in one role Bob Lee was my dance partner. There was a picture of the two of us dancing together that made the front page of the Daily Bruin once, which I kept for many years. Then did you ever hear about when The Egg and The Eye [Wyle's gallery-Ed.] opened in 1965?\n\nSE: No.\n\nEW: The first week that it was opened, I was upstairs in the restaurant, and I see this very portly man with big. . . . What do you call those, mutton. . . .\n\nSE: Muttonchops.\n\nEW: Muttonchop side things.\n\nSE: Sideburns.\n\nEW: Sitting there with a big bottle of champagne next to him and eating, and when I got up to walk out past him-this was only in the first couple of weeks after the place opened-I looked at him and he looked at me, and he said, \"I know you.\" And I said, \"I know you. What's your name?\" And he said, \"Bob Lee.\" And he said, \"I remember you from UCLA, Edith Robinson.\" I couldn't believe that he remembered me! He said, \"I see you've got good taste, too.\" And I said, \"What do you mean?\" He said, \"You are eating in a place like this.\" And I replied, \"My taste may even be better. I own it.\" [laughter] Anyhow, he became a regular. I'm sure you must have seen him.\n\nSE: I don't remember.\n\nEW: He was there every week. At that point and for many years thereafter he was head of costume design for CBS, and so he used to come over there and have lunch and introduced me to a lot of his fellow designers. Bob Cecci, from whom we [CAFAM] just received a huge hat collection was one of them.\n\nSE: Bob Cecci?\n\nEW: Yessh, I even gave Bob Cecci a show. He has been the head of design at CBS ever since Bob Lee retired, I believe, and he's also done lots of movies and written plays. Bob's quite a guy. And Proctor Stafford was a good friend of his.\n\nSE: Proctor Stafford's a collector.\n\nEW: Yes. Oh, I went to junior high with Proctor.\n\nSE: You did? That's how you got to know him? I mean originally then?\n\nEW: He was a shy little boy at junior high school. We recognized each other at college. He was at UCLA when I was there too, and he was still not . . . what he became, by a long shot.\n\nSE: You mean he was still shy?\n\nEW: I guess so. I really can't remember him very well, but I remember him from junior high vaguely, and he remembers me.\n\nSE: What did he end up doing? I can't remember how he earned his living.\n\nEW: Well, he was in real estate, but he also inherited quite a bit. Proctor's living in Hawaii most of the time now. Let's see. . . . So anyhow I stuck with dance, but I was always interested in art. I didn't mention to you that I went to art school on weekends.\n\nSE: No!\n\nEW: All through high school, and even some in junior high school. I went to Chouinard, and I went to Art Center. I went one whole summer and on weekends to Art Center. That used to be on Seventh Street downtown. And before that. . . . Where else? I know I went to Art Center. I know I went to Chouinard a lot.\n\nSE: Did you know Mrs. Chouinard at all?\n\nEW: I'm sure I did. But I can't remember her. I don't remember any of that.\n\nSE: You don't remember any of those people that were there when you were there?\n\nEW: No.\n\nSE: What years would that be? The Disney program wasn't there yet?\n\nEW: No, it was long before that. It was a separate little school, which was amalgamated with a Hollywood Music Conservatory.\n\nSE: Did you know any of the artists? Like Phil Dyke or Phil Paradise or Millard Sheets?\n\nEW: No.\n\nSE: Or any of those people that studied there?\n\nEW: Not that studied there. There was a Kaminsky that taught there, that I remember vaguely. That was Art Center.\n\nSE: But the years that you were in high school. What year did you graduate from high school?\n\nEW: '36. After which, well, the art business was beginning to sneak in a little more again, but I hadn't really thought of being a serious painter for a long time. That was later. In fact, I think that I was married when I really began to do serious easel painting more than thinking of being an illustrator. No, that's not true, because in high school. . . . I remember when I was a freshman in college I spent the whole summer at Art Center and. . . . I can still. . . . [chuckles] I had a friend named Pearl Gersh. Phil and Bea Gersh are big contemporary art collectors. That's her brother, Phillip. Pearl was my closest friend during those first years of college. She was a lot of fun, and I liked her a lot. We went to art school together that summer, and one day we went to the local drug store to have a Coke afterwards and the soda jerk came up to us and said, \"What can I get for you two artists?\" The two of us looked at each other proudly and said, \"He knows! How did you know we were artists?\" And he replied, \"'Cause your faces are all smudged with charcoal.\" [laughter] But I never forgot that.\n\nSE: Does Pearl collect also?\n\nEW: I haven't seen Pearl in recent years, and I don't know why. I'm really sorry about that. Her husband died, and we just haven't seen other. No, she doesn't collect at all like that. She had a sister, Mildred Jaffe, who was married to Sam Jaffe. Mildred died, too, but Sam's still alive. Sam Jaffe, the agent.\n\nSE: Right.\n\nEW: Mildred and Sam were very big collectors. They had a fantastic collection, really fine, one of the best in Hollywood. Then they moved to London and lived there just before Marcia and Norman Panama moved there. They became very close friends in London.\n\nSE: Norman Panama, yes, I know him.\n\nEW: Yes, and Marcia.\n\nSE: So you were talking about how you moved from dance into art.\n\nEW: I took art classes in college-it was a minor-on and off.\n\nSE: What was your major? Dance then?\n\nEW: No, I changed that major nine million times. I was an English major when I graduated. But I had a minor in art. It didn't amount to anything in college in those days. If I'd known about some of the courses I found you could take there. . . . Well, I don't think they had them to offer at the time. And, incidentally, I hear they're closing the ceramic department at UCLA.\n\nSE: Oh, no.\n\nEW: I heard that on Sunday. I think I heard it from. . . . Ralph Bacerra was there, who had been a student of Vivika Heino's. Vivika told me, I was sitting with Vivika. Vivika and Ralph told me.\n\nSE: Has Ralph been teaching there?\n\nEW: No, he teaches in Pasadena. I think at the Art Center, doesn't he?\n\nSE: Maybe.\n\nEW: Anyhow, though I looked at art, studied it, took history of, and all that business, I wasn't doing that much of it. I was involved in being an English major, studying and all the things that went with it. It was when I first graduated and began-again-starting to do art. I studied with Keith Finch for quite a long time.\n\nSE: UCLA or after?\n\nEW: No, outside. Oh, there was a school called The Kann Institute of Art.\n\nSE: The Kann Institute. I've heard of that.\n\nEW: Well, it was on Melrose Avenue where the Figaro Restaurant now is.\n\nSE: And Keith Finch taught there?\n\nEW: Keith taught there. Arnold Mesches taught there. Saul Bass taught there. Mary Vartikian. They were all there as teachers, and there were others as well. Keith was the main one with whom I studied. I did not study with any of the others. I doubt that I took a class from Arnold. Diana [EW's youngest child-Ed.] was born at that time, and at this juncture I knew that art was it. It was interesting to me because I thought I had a perfect concept of space as learned from being a dancer, and I'd thought that was definitely going to bridge over onto the canvas with me. But then I found there was a different kind of space. I had a big struggle with that, trying to get the dance movement in another category from. . . . Maybe I should have done sculpture right off the bat. That would have been better perhaps. But anyhow I had that adjustment to do, and I realized. . . . Oh, before I get into any of that: I stopped college halfway through due to things that don't have to be in here. I'm not going to tell about that. It was an unhappy love affair. Anyhow.\n\nSE: Oh, you're not going to tell us?\n\nEW: No, I'm not telling that.\n\nSE: Okay.\n\nEW: My parents swished me off to New York to get me out of town. My liberal, free-thinking parents were horrified at me because I let D. H. Lawrence go to my head, but with whom my mother was madly in love. Oh, I left out a whole lot of stuff about that. When I was in my first two years of college. . . . I have to tell you about that. Next door to us. . . . No, that's really important. We had a house that was right next door to us, and you know how the houses are right next to each other in L.A. It was rented by a family named Zimbalist-Sam Zimbalist and his wife, Marguerite, and they had two children, two daughters. She did from earlier marriages. It turned out that Sam Zimbalist was the brother of Efrem Zimbalist, the extremely famous violinist. Oh, I left out so many important things on my mother's life, also.\n\nSE: Okay, so let's do it now.\n\nEW: When mother was a little girl, her sister was friendly with a woman who was the sister of a very famous opera singer, Alma Gluck. Anybody that knows anything about opera knows of Alma Gluck. She was \"it\" with the Metropolitan, and in those days she was a beautiful, beautiful woman and a wonderful singer. Her sister was Auntie Cecile, who was like my grandmother when I was growing up. She was the closest. . . . I called her Auntie Cecile. Well, Cecile Ableman was her name, and she started designing clothes. She hired my Aunt Anna to be the designer in her shop, and they designed the clothes for the Metropolitan opera stars, of which Alma Gluck was one. Alma Gluck had a daughter whose name was Abigail in those days, Abigail Gluck. Later she changed her name to Marsha Davenport, of whom you may have heard. She's written many books. She wrote one book called East Side, West Side, which was about her Auntie Cecile and Alma Gluck, her mother, and also she wrote a biography of Mozart. She had a love affair with I think it was. . . . He was the Minister of Czechoslovakia before the war [________-Ed.]. They were in love with each other, Marsha Davenport. There's a whole book about that. Fancy. . . . I can't think of it. She's written many books. Anyhow, in those days. . . .\n\nSE: Are they novels or historic?\n\nEW: Historic. True. She's very well known. About a year or so ago they did a profile of her in the New Yorker in which it was said that she lives in Pebble Beach much of the time now and that she will see no one, which is too bad, because I always felt that our lives were sort of in the shadow of this family. Alma Gluck married. . . . She had divorced Gluck a long time before, and she married Efrem Zimbalist who was one of the major violinists in the world at the time. Oh, he was there with Mischa Elman and [Jascha-Ed.] Heifetz, but he was in that category. After Mother married Dad in San Francisco, she missed being in New York very badly, and Alexander Lambert was unhappy because she wasn't in New York as well, so she asked Lambert to see if Efrem Zimbalist would take Dad on as a scholarship pupil. Zimbalist never took pupils at all, but he did accept my father. And so they moved back to New York during that period. But I'm ahead of the story because when Mother was a little girl she got a job teaching Abigail [Marsha Davenport-EW] piano. She was her first piano teacher. And also she was the recipient of Abigail's cast-off clothes, because she had few clothes of her own. So there was this tie. And then Auntie Cecile was always a very close friend of the family. Her daughter was my aunt's closest friend. And the daughter had sons, and there was another brother that wanted to marry my mother and then. . . . So this went all the way through. Years and years later, there was a big coincidence: Efrem Zimbalist's brother and his wife Marguerite took the house right next door to us, which they either rented or bought. I don't know which it was. I was a freshman in college. Marguerite was as different from her husband, Sam, as night and day, and had had an art gallery in New York called the Ten Dollar Art Gallery. She was a beautiful woman with DAR roots. He was a Russian Jew. Marguerite couldn't put up with many of the things that Sam liked. She had a terrible, terrible temper. I never heard such a temper in my life. For instance, he loved herring, and she said he couldn't have it in the house. Once she was cleaning and she smelled something around the piano. Sam had sneaked herring in the house and had hidden it in the piano. [laughter] By a previous husband Marguerite had had two daughters, named Jane and Margaret, and I think that Margaret was the offspring of somebody that was part American Indian. She looked like it. She had an Indian look to her. Jane didn't have that look.\n\nSE: These were other, both from the same father or. . . .\n\nEW: I don't know how many husbands Marguerite had. She was a devotee of D. H. Lawrence, was schooled in everything about him, and I mean in those days people paid. . . . They created the place in Santa Fe where Mabel Dodge had lived, and D. H. Lawrence had been, and they would pay homage to the place, and the phoenix-rising thing. I don't know, there was a whole cult around that.\n\nSE: And she _____?\n\nEW: She and mother became very close. My mother was completely infatuated by Marguerite and her ideas. In fact, Mom and Dad's whole lives became intertwined with Sam and Marguerite and the girls. Margaret, the youngest, became a harpist and she was very, very good. She began playing in the studio orchestras while she was just a kid, like twelve or thirteen years old. I remember that we used to go to movies and theatre with them. One night we were up at the Zimbalists to have coffee or cake after a movie, and Marguerite suddenly had a fierce argument in the kitchen and as she came in with the tray she became so angry at something or someone that she just took the tray and threw it on the floor. Everything broke. Oh, and the kids had been in bed asleep. They both got up and cleaned up the mess and silently went back to bed! They were so used to this sort of thing. [laughter] But she was a fascinating woman, and she needed a lot of. . . . She bought all her clothes at thrift shops. That was before I heard of anybody doing that, which I've certainly heard of since. And she had some wonderful paintings in her collection, from her Ten Dollar Art Gallery, because she had a real eye. She discovered fine painters before they became known. Marguerite paid for her dental bills by trading paintings for dental work with Dad, and that's how we came to own some Elshemiuses, of which that's one over there and that's one there.\n\nSE: Ah!\n\nEW: I remember we once had. . . . Who was it that was the art critic before. . . .\n\nSE: Oh, yes.\n\nEW: Old, old. . . .\n\nSE: Before William Wilson.\n\nEW: Yes, way before him, too.\n\nSE: Oh, before Henry Seldes?\n\nEW: Oh, Arthur Millier was the art critic for the L.A. Times. Once he visited us and looked at the Elshemiuses. He said that that one over there was the best of the lot. [Note: The original Tape 2, side B, was accidentally not recorded during session one. EW and SE held another interview session in an attempt to reconstruct the missing portions from the original interview name list. The transcript of the new interview session follows-Ed.] [Unfortunately, throughout this tape, EW's voice is not clearly audible; she had vocal cord problems that, obviously, affected the strength of her voice-Ed.]\n\nSE: This is the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, interview with Edith R. Wyle. I am Sharon Emanuelli, the interviewer, and this tape is to replace Tape 2B, which was originally left blank in the first interview. The date is February 26, 1997, and we're at my home in Los Angeles, California. Okay, Edith, at the end of Tape 2, Side A, we were discussing . . . you were talking about how you began to be interested in art and you had spoken about Marguerite and Sam Zimbalist.\n\nEW: Yes, well, I don't think I began to be interested in art. I began to really study it more seriously although I had studied it before that in art school in the summers, but I began to know that I really hoped I could be an artist, although dance was still pretty prominent throughout that time. But I just want to say something that I'm thinking about now . . .\n\nSE: Okay.\n\nEW: . . . and that is when I was a young girl growing up, when I was real young, I used to envy my parents and think, \"What was the use of going on? All the exciting and interesting things that occurred happened before I was born, in their lives-the people that they met and all the things that they did. And life was humdrum.\" Now, of course, I look back on my childhood at that point and it was really exciting. I mean, the people that I was involved with around that time, beginning to be around that time.\n\nSE: Are you talking about in college . . .\n\nEW: In college and . . .\n\nSE: . . . as a child?\n\nEW: . . . well, and afterwards. Right after that. Not as a child so much. And around that time that I met Sam and Marguerite, that period, Toscanini began having the Thursday night concerts [on NBC] [Radio-Ed.]. I don't know why Thursday sticks in my head, but, anyhow, he had them, and we started inviting people over to our house. I invited a lot of my college friends over to listen with us. My mother and dad had their gusts. And dad would [play] them the concerts. He invited a lot of really interesting people, such as Bronislaw Kaper, who came with his wife quite often, and he was new to America about that time.\n\nSE: Kaper?\n\nEW: K-a-p-e-r. He was one of the refugees from what was going on with Hitler and so forth. Also another person was Dave Raksin-David Raksin, R-a-k-s-i-n. He was a young man that was brought over by Charlie Chaplin to arrange the music for the tune that Charlie Chaplin invented for Modern Times. He was a quite young-about a year or two older than I. He was brilliant, and Dad brought him home quite a bit. He since rose to become one of the top Hollywood composers. He wrote the. . . . I think he's most famous for the theme song for Laura, with Gene Tierney. Other interesting people also came. But, anyhow, where shall we go from there? [Interruption in taping]\n\nSE: Was there anything more you wanted to say about Marguerite and Sam Zimbalist.\n\nEW: No.\n\nSE: Okay, and Arthur Millier was the art critic that liked the Elshemius at your mother's house. That's been established before\n\nEW: Right.\n\nSE: Okay, so now we're into Toscanini.\n\nEW: I just did it.\n\nSE: Oh, okay.\n\nEW: Oh, well, my father played in the studios, and he played under Alfred Newman, who was really the top conductor in Hollywood. In fact, I recently received a little monograph that David Raksin wrote about Hollywood composers, and he talked about the fact that he was brought over by Charlie Chaplin and that he was working with Alfred Newman, and he talked about the fact that Alfred Newman had the best orchestra and they were all virtuosi that made up that orchestra. Well, one of those was my father. That made me happy to see it in print. But, anyhow, it was lovely having these people over at our house during Toscanini concerts, and the college students adored meeting all these people. And they also loved my parents. They were crazy about them. So, meanwhile, I was still working with Benjamin Zemach and I thought I was going to be a contemporary, modern dancer, or a great dancer, which I should have known I couldn't be, because I really wasn't that good, my figure was wrong, and I just wasn't that accomplished. But I continued to do that and at the same time I was more and more interested in being a part of the visual art world. But when I graduated from college, it was right in the middle of the Depression. There was no way that I could go to art school or do anything along those lines. I had to make a living, and I went to Woodbury College to become a secretary-which was about the last thing in the world that I should ever have done. I probably was the world's worst secretary. But I went through it. I learned the shorthand-which was difficult with the left hand-and I was pretty good as a typist. I got a job with a fellow named Peter Rosenfeld, with whom I was going out at the time [laughs], and he had a garment factory. Brassieres and corsets-that's what it was. [laughs] He was really tough; he was very hard on me. He used to pick me up and take me downtown to the factory, and he would let me off a few blocks before we got there, so that it wouldn't look to the rest of the people as though I knew him well, and he made me walk in. And then he made me return every letter that wasn't absolutely perfect. I really hated working for him. And after I got through with that, I was offered a job at the jewelers and watchmakers and dental technicians union. They were all together. [Interruption in taping]\n\nEW: And I loved working there. This job was terribly funny. I mean, the man that hired me was embarrassed because he didn't know how to be a boss and he had to be a boss. There he was in the union and it just was against the grain. So in the middle of the interview, he asked me if I could play Ping-Pong-I've never forgotten that-and I said, \"Yes.\" So we went in the room and played ping pong and I was hired. I also was fired because the wife of the guy who hired me thought I was too attractive. [laughter] So I got a friend of mine to take my place. Then I had a job with Jesse Lasky, Jr., and Jesse Lasky was writing the life story of his father, who was one of the early motion picture moguls, which you probably know. I used to go to his house and take dictation. And I was such a bad secretary that I frequently forgot to take my notebook home with me, where I had to transcribe everything. I made great dinner table conversation for Jesse, Jr., who enjoyed my mistakes for some reason. But one day I typed something up and I blurted out while he was dictating. . . . No, I guess it was the typewritten pages that I had brought back. I said, \"You know, if you took paragraph four and put it where paragraph one is, and if you took the second paragraph and moved it to the end, it would read a lot better.\" I didn't know I was going to say that, and I began to get panic-stricken to think that I dared to do that. And he became totally white in the face. I mean, he looked like he was going to erupt. And then he said, \"Type it that way.\" And I did. And from then on I was his editor. We did everything he wrote. It didn't turn out to be very good even then.\n\nSE: [chuckles]\n\nEW: But then he went into the army and that was the end of it. Also, of course, I met Frank at that point and fell in love and married him. And I did get, briefly, another job with another screenwriter [________-Ed.], who was writing the script for Sergeant York with Gary Cooper. I did that and then I quit. Something happened at the end of that; I was through. I was married and I think I got pregnant. I don't know, something happened like that.\n\nSE: What year would this be?\n\nEW: Well, that had to be 1942. Way back there. I started having babies right away, but I also started really studying at the Kann Institute of Art. K-a-n-n. That is bringing me in full circle, because I'm now getting my hair done right across the street from where the Kann Institute used to be, which was in what is now the Café Figaro Restaurant on Melrose. It was a wonderful place; it was really great. Keith Finch was my major teacher there. Arnold Mesches was on staff, Saul Bass was on staff, and Mary Vartikian, who later was at Art Center, was on staff. V-a-r-t-i-k-i-a-n. And I became very friendly with. . . . That's where I met Cornelia Brendel Foss. We became very closefriends, her in particular. But I also became close to Betsy Zill and Betsy Jones-these were all art students-and Sara Rafetto and Ralph Novak, who was another really good artist. We thought we were all the best in the place. Betsy Zill was a marvelous, eccentric woman-still is-and she was married to a man named Tony Zill and lived in West Hollywood, very close to Kann Institute. Her parents lived in Pennsylvania. Betsy was talking about how she needed a washing machine, so they sent her the money for a washing machine, and she took that money and sent it to England for an etching press-which is what she really wanted. This was a huge etching press. She set it up in her garage, and Cornelia Foss and Betsy Jones and I-and I think we were the only ones-joined her little etching group, and we went there and did etchings all the time. Which brought us all very close together. And Sara Rafetto. And I guess Ralph Novak came, too. But he died very soon after that, a very young death. But Cornelia and I continued to be very close friends. They were here from Italy. Cornelia met Lukas Foss, who was and is a composer, pianist, and conductor. They met in Italy at the American school in Rome-American. . . .\n\nSE: Academy.\n\nEW: Academy, right. Lukas was a resident, and Cornelia's father, Otto Brendel. . . . I think he was living there at the time, also, and she was there because she was Otto's daughter. Cornelia was studying sculpture there with Matta, I think. M-a-t-t-a. I think that's who it was. She was doing quite well. But now we can talk about this émigré exhibit that's on right now.\n\nSE: Matta's in that, yeah. . . .\n\nEW: As far as émigrés are concerned, I met them all at the Foss's house. I was right in the middle of all that. But not the visual artists so much as the composers. Stravinsky was there all the time. Aldous Huxley was there all the time. [Gregor-Ed.] Piatagorsky was there all the time. And we had fantastic evenings all the. . . . Rico Lebrun, of course, was part of that too. He had come from Naples years before. And that's when I say that I envied my parents their past. Now, when I go into the [Koplin] Gallery and see Marty [Koplin], who has a Lebrun show on right now, she says to me, \"Oh God,\" she said, \"I wish that I'd been there in those days. They sound so exciting.\" So she's doing what I did when I was young. But I guess it happens to all of us all the time. Oh, but I knew it was exciting then, at that time. I really did. With all those people.\n\nSE: It's a real shame, though. Isn't it the Stravinsky Library that's going to Vienna?\n\nEW: You know I don't know that.\n\nSE: Was it Stravinsky or . . .\n\nEW: [Arnold-Ed.] Schoenberg?\n\nSE: Schoenberg.\n\nEW: Could be.\n\nSE: Schoenberg was at USC?\n\nEW: I think it's Schoenberg, yeah.\n\nSE: Was Schoenberg at USC?\n\nEW: Yes, he was, definitely.\n\nSE: His library was given to USC. They built the building for it. Now the family's sending it to Vienna, right.\n\nEW: To Vienna. Right, I remember that. It was Leonard Stein who really got that whole thing going at USC-whom I also knew quite well. He must be heartbroken about that.\n\nSE: I imagine. Is he a professor there?\n\nEW: He was. He was at Cal Arts, too. So. . . .\n\nSE: He's a musician, Leonard Stein?\n\nEW: Yes. When I started The Egg and the Eye-I'm sure that future tapes say that-Leonard was teaching a class in my house, in music, contemporary music, starting with Bartok and coming up [forward to the present]. He started the class before I got involved in The Egg and The Eye. But when I really got involved-when it opened and I was being a hostess, even waiting on tables and doing everything in the place-I came home dead tired and I could hardly stay awake during his classes. And, speaking of him-Leonard Stein, [if I may]-we had concert, a Schoenberg memorial concert, at the Monday Evening Concerts at L.A. County Museum, and we opened The Egg and the Eye afterwards for people to come in the restaurant. Mrs. Schoenberg was one of those people, and Leonard Stein brought her. I was waiting on tables at that point. I came up to take their order. Leonard introduced me to her and everybody else and said, \"I'm teaching a class at Edith Wyle's house, but she falls asleep during the class,\" [laughs] to Mrs. Schoenberg and I have never forgotten that. And I didn't fall asleep any other time, but I fell asleep after The Egg and The Eye. I was so tired. He once brought Ravi Shankar to my house.\n\nSE: Wow!\n\nEW: This was the time I really fell asleep, I think. And I was excited about his coming to the house. He brought people of that caliber all the time. But I decided that I would sit in the fourth row. I put seats up so it would be like an auditorium. But people didn't show up and they kept removing the chairs away from him so I ended up in the front row somehow. And he had incense that he was lit while he spoke. The incense and the ragas that he played were hypnotizing. I couldn't stay awake. I fell asleep right in front of him. That's what he was referring to. Okay, now. . . .\n\nSE: Well, it's understandable.\n\nEW: Yes. Now, the parents of Cornelia Foss-Cornelia Brendel Foss-were Otto Brendel and Maria Brendel. They were both art historians-or archaeologists, I think they called themselves. He was very well known. He taught at Columbia University and he shared an office with Meyer Schapiro. His specialty was the Renaissance and he claimed that he knew more about Dürer than Panofsky, who wrote so many books on the subject. But he was wonderful and I had the great good luck of being in Italy-on my first trip to Italy, Frank and I-[and-Ed.] Otto and his wife Maria were there and they took us all over Rome and to the Villa d'Esta and to Hadrian's Villa and everywhere. It was just wonderful.\n\nSE: Were they actually Italian?\n\nEW: No, Otto was from Nuremberg, and Maria from some part of Germany, but they spent so much of. . . . Cornelia grew up in Italy most of her life. They lived there more than they did in Germany. So that was all. . . .\n\nSE: Did you have other contact with them?\n\nEW: I saw them a lot.\n\nSE: The Brendels?\n\nEW: Oh, yes. They came to L.A. all the time and they always. . . . We became like family.\n\nSE: And Cornelia was studying at UCLA?\n\nEW: No, Cornelia studied at the Kann Institute with me.\n\nSE: Oh, right.\n\nEW: Then Cornelia and I got a studio together. And Marcia Panama, the three of us, in Beverly Hills, had a studio. I don't know if that comes. . . . I don't think it comes later or not.\n\nSE: It may come later because Marcia's name isn't on this list [of names mentioned in the original interview-Ed.].\n\nEW: I see. Well, later. . . . Well, let's go into this other thing. When the Kann Institute episode ended, Keith Finch, who was my main teacher there, whom I liked-and Cornelia worked with him, as well-he wanted to teach but he didn't know where to do it. I think the Kann Institute had closed. It must have been. I can't remember. I know that Howard Warshaw was looking for a place to teach, also, and the two of them got together and decided to open up a school, just the two of them. So that is how I happened to start studying with Howard Warshaw, as well as with Keith Finch. I began to. . . . I much prefer working with Howard Warshaw. I learned to draw from Howard. I think. I still think that he was responsible for that. And Cornelia was also there working with Howard. She also gave up Keith, too. They had a place on La Cienega, which was right next door to the Felix Landau Gallery. In fact, there was a connecting door between them. That was a pretty exciting time. And that was the time I first really listened to Rico. I'd heard him lecture elsewhere. He lectured at the Perls Gallery quite often, and I went to those lectures. But he came to our class-to Howard's class-and lectured one evening. And somebody said to him, \"I'm just a beginner but. . . .\" and Rico interrupted this person and said, \"How old are you?\" And the person said, \"forty-seven\" or something like that. And he said, \"Well, you've got forty-seven years of experience in you, so you can't be a beginner.\" And I never forgot that. I decided, \"There's hope for me. I can really be a painter still, even though I. . . .\"\n\nSE: So he was encouraging of people?\n\nEW: He was very encouraging about that, at least at that time, yeah. Whereas Howard Warshaw, who was a wonderful teacher, had some. . . . I think it was personal problems more than anything, but he hated women artists. He really had a hard time with them. The top compliment that I ever received from Howard was, when he looked at something I did, \"That is not necessarily without interest.\" All negatives. [laughter] I've never forgotten the sentence and I use it all the time.\n\nSE: It's a good one. So was Rico ever affiliated with Warshaw in any way? They just happened to be. . . .\n\nEW: No, Rico taught at Jepson and so did Howard, but Howard adored and worshipped Rico. He wasn't his pupil in the classic sense, but he considered Rico his mentor. And always until he died he _____ _____.\n\nSE: So Rico was older than Warshaw? Or about the same?\n\nEW: Yes, but not much. Yes, I guess he was quite a few years older. It wasn't just old; it was that he adored his work so much. But Billy [William-Ed.] Brice was a pupil of Rico's.\n\nSE: At Jepson?\n\nEW: At Jepson-and for years. He also, of course, worshipped Rico and still feels that strongly about him-about his memory. So now we better [return to the \"script\"-Ed.].\n\nSE: Let's see Max Edel? Igor Stravinsky?\n\nEW: Oh, Max Edel came and took classes from Howard at this place at night. He was a doctor, and he taught classes in anatomy at . . . did I say that?\n\nSE: No.\n\nEW: At Chouinard?\n\nSE: No.\n\nEW: He had been teaching anatomy classes to art students on the side, and he was part of this group that we formed at the Finch-Warshaw school. When that closed, we began having classes at Max's house, which was on Barrington. It was just an apartment, but four or five of us would go there and Howard taught us-just Howard on that one. It was very nice. But that was when the other thing fell apart. We were trying to figure out what to do. I think Frank Wyle got in there in some way and tried to help Keith Finch and Howard set up a school, which they did. This house that they rented on. . . .\n\nSE: This is the second one?\n\nEW: After La Cienaga and after the little classes at Max's, there was a school that was set up on San Vincente in Brentwood, where. . . .\n\nSE: Was it also called Finch-Warshaw?\n\nEW: It was called Finch-Warshaw. . . . I don't know. Maybe. . . . I can't remember. Yes, it was Finch-Warshaw. Yes, it was definitely that. I don't think I studied with Keith at all there. I studied exclusively with Howard during that period. Keith lived in the house.\n\nSE: In San Vincente?\n\nEW: On San Vincente.\n\nSE: Okay.\n\nEW: And around that time Rico gave a master class at UCLA in the summer. You had to submit portfolios to get in. I did, Betsy Jones did, who was mentioned there [in the name list-Ed.].\n\nSE: Right.\n\nEW: I don't know, I don't think Sara Rafetto did. No, she didn't. I don't think anyone else did, except Cornelia [Brendel Foss-Ed.] and I both did. We spent the summer there and it was wonderful. We thought he was marvelous. At that time Rico had this big studio . . . he had a ballroom and across from his ballroom where his studio was, were three rooms that he also had to rent.\n\nSE: And where was this?\n\nEW: On San Vincente.\n\nSE: Also on San Vincente.\n\nEW: Right where Hamburger Hamlet now is-and Phil's Poultry and all that, where that little mini-mall is. That's where it was. He didn't know what to do with it. He decided that he would take three artists in-or six, if two wanted to be in a room. But he was going to go through a portfolio examination first. So I submitted a portfolio, as did the others, and I was the first one that moved up there because I think my timing was . . . it was possible. And then Cornelia and Teresa Ptaczinsky, who happens to have returned to her maiden name, which is Teresa Sorci-S-o-r-c-i-and I think you've got the spelling of Ptaczinsky somewhere . . .\n\nSE: Yes, I do. That's where we began to talk about when Teresa Sorci was married to Bill Ptaczinsky, and Bill was a fine artist . . .\n\nEW: Right.\n\nSE: . . . became a helper to Rico.\n\nEW: Right.\n\nEW: Teresa, I thought, was a wonderful artist, and Bill was also a fine artist, but I, personally, liked Teresa's work very much. She also posed for Rico a great deal and then in several books of his work, she can be seen. The drawings he did of her. We always called her the Mad Sicilian. I don't know if I told about that, but I became very fond of her. She had been at Jepson. She grew up in the valley, on a farm with her Sicilian parents. But she was born with a paralysis. One side of her face was paralyzed, so that her mouth went up.\n\nSE: Okay, so you were talking about Rostroprovich coming in. . . .\n\nEW: Rostroprovich. . . . Oh, I know, I was telling you that William Schumann, who had been the head of Julliard School of Music, who was a composer-American composer-was having a concert at UCLA on that particular evening that Rostropovich had been there during the day. I can't remember whether he spoke or performed or what he did, but he did something which was a cultural exchange. Lukas had come home and said to Cornelia that he invited Rostropovich to join the party that was being given for Schumann at their home that evening. And Cornelia became hysterical and excited and said, \"You can't do that! You'll get fired from UCLA.\" This was in the late fifties or early sixties. I think it was like '59 or '60, something like that. And, well, it was the first cultural exchange so you can figure that out. She said, \"I just know! I know that [someone] is a real spy. I saw that guy. You'll see he's a spy.\" In the evening we went to the concert. I sat with Cornelia. I saw Rostropovich, who had been invited to the concert as well, walk in with his entourage and Cornelia said, \"There! See that man with Rostropovich, right behind him? That's the man. That's the spy. I know he's a spy.\" And I laughed. I burst out laughing. That was my father's dental technician . . .\n\nSE: [laughs]\n\nEW: . . . a mild little sweet man who happened to be Russian but spoke English as well. So he was simply translating for Rostropovich. Everybody came to the party and everybody was happy. And it was a good party and . . .\n\nSE: . . . nobody was fired.\n\nEW: Yeah, nobody was fired. [laughs]. So I was saying that the parties were wonderful and I don't know if I talked about Piatagorsky. . . .\n\nSE: No, talk about him.\n\nEW: Well, Piatagorsky-who was writing his autobiography-came and insisted on reading his latest chapters to us, which I enjoyed thoroughly. I remember Norman Panama falling asleep right smack in front of him during his reading. Another person who came all the time was Michael Kidd, a dance choreographer, and his then-wife, Mary, who were friends of the Panamas at the time, and friends of ours, too. And Solly Chaplin, the composer, came to all those parties. And Leonard Bernstein, when he was in town, came.\n\nSE: You were talking about Stravinsky's aviary.\n\nEW: Stravinsky. Not his aviary. Oh, yeah, at one of the parties. . . . Oh yeah, did I describe the aviary?\n\nSE: Do it now.\n\nEW: Okay. This house that they lived in had been John Barrymore's aviary, which was attached to the main house up on Tower Grove Road, behind the Beverly Hills Hotel-way up-and the aviary which. . . . You entered a bottom room, which was very small, just big enough really for the piano-a piano was down there-and then you walked through to a very small kitchen, which opened out to a little patio. Then you went up the stairs and there was a vast room like a ballroom, really huge, with a balcony outside of it. That's where they slept, where they had parties, where they did everything. And I forgot to describe the stained-glass window that had Dolores Costello in it [put in by] John Barrymore, because he must have been married to her at that point.\n\nSE: Did the Barrymore's live in another house?\n\nEW: They lived in the house that's attached, which then was lived in by Hugo. . . . The head of Monaco, what's his name? Prince Rainier's. . . .\n\nSE: Grimaldi.\n\nEW: Oh, Grimaldi. Hugo Grimaldi, who was a cousin or a brother or something of the prince, claimed that he really should have been the prince. I remember that. He and his wife owned that house. We met them, too. And they were nothing much. Anyhow. . . .\n\nSE: He was the brother of the Prince of Monaco, though?\n\nEW: I don't know whether he was a brother or a cousin. His name was Grimaldi, and he claimed that he was the real prince, which may or may not be true. Who knows? I don't.\n\nSE: And you talked about Stravinsky.\n\nEW: Oh, Stravinsky was at one of those parties and I found him. . . . He was found out on the balcony that was looking over this canyon, and he was out there with Huxley and somebody else, and they were having a contest to see who could pee the furthest off the balcony. [laughter]\n\nSE: But this was Stravinsky's house that we're discussing, right? The aviary. That was Stravinsky's?\n\nEW: No, no, no. It had been John Barrymore's house.\n\nSE: And who was living in it at the time you were giving the parties?\n\nEW: Lukas Foss.\n\nSE: Oh, Lukas Foss rented it.\n\nEW: Yeah.\n\nSE: Oh, that's where they lived.\n\nEW: Right. I think I mentioned something about going to-I forgot to say that-about going to the house that they lived in before they got to the aviary, the Fosses, way back. Forgot to mention. . . .\n\nSE: Talk about that.\n\nEW: The first dinner that I ever went to at the Foss's house-way back-they had Stravinsky and his wife, Vera, and Darius Milhaud, who was a very famous composer. M-i-l-h-a-u-d.\n\nSE: What was his first name?\n\nEW: Darius. D-a-r-i-u-s. Who died a very untimely death. Stravinsky and Vera and Milhaud and his wife and Frank and I were the only guests. And Cornelia cooked that dinner. And I found out afterwards from Max Edel, the doctor, that Vera took a bite of everything that Stravinsky was served first to make sure it was okay for him. She watched his food like a hawk. And she was very particular about all that. I thought about that when I remembered that first meal. The potatoes that Cornelia cooked were like little rocks that she served. It was the most awful dinner I can remember ever eating. And Stravinsky ate it all and was totally charmed by Cornelia, which everybody always was, so it was okay. It's just something I remember, that's all. [laughs]\n\nSE: You also told a story about Rico and Picasso. Rico Lebrun. . . .\n\nEW: I didn't repeat that?\n\nSE: No.\n\nEW: Oh, at one of the parties in the aviary somebody was talking about the influence of Picasso to Rico, and he said, \"Well, I'll tell you about Picasso.\" He passed a fruit bowl and he picked up a plum or a peach, took a bite out of it, and put it back. And he said, \"Now, who can touch it?\" He said, \"That's Picasso.\" And he claims that it took him years to get beyond Picasso. But he did get beyond Picasso-this devoted student, we'll say. He got on top of it. Particularly when he went to the Dante series.\n\nSE: Was Picasso Lebrun's. . . .\n\nEW: Mentor?\n\nSE: Not mentor. Well, did he know Picasso?\n\nEW: No.\n\nSE: No. But then is that who he looked towards the most?\n\nEW: No. He had a lot of, to quote him, \"Bosses.\" He gave lectures; his lectures were marvelous. Somebody wrote about him that he looked like Savonarola when he stood up there giving his lectures. He was a very articulate person. Also he knew reams of poetry by heart. He knew all of A Room of One's Own by Virginia Woolf by heart. He was at our ranch once and we were walking, and I must have said something about that book, about that essay, and suddenly he began quoting from it, verbatim. He convered the entire essay as we walked. I couldn't get over this man. He knew French poetry, a lot of that, which he could also repeat. I don't know, where am I?\n\nSE: You were talking about. . . . I was asking who his influences were. And you were saying. . . .\n\nEW: Oh, Goya. El Greco. Signorelli. He worked on Signorelli frescoes in Orvieto for years, a couple of years. He was up there on the scaffolding helping to . . .\n\nSE: Conserve it?\n\nEW: . . . conserve them. And he loved. . . . Oh, his other mentor was in Colemar, the triptych. Grünewald. Loved. . . . I mean, he had a lot of \"bosses,\" to quote him. Bonnard, for example. He loved many artists, but the ones that he talked about, I think, the most were El Greco and Goya. Very big on Goya.\n\nSE: And when you were painting, did you feel like you had the same influences? Or did you. . . .\n\nEW: Yes, they became very strongly my influences. I don't know whether that was in this little teeny bit, but I was in Italy with Rico and Constance.\n\nSE: No there's, I think, more on that already that we have.\n\nEW: On another tape?\n\nSE: Yes.\n\nEW: Oh, okay. Well, I think we've covered. . . . Don't you think we've covered enough?\n\nSE: Yes.\n\nEW: Okay. [End of replacement tape; original interview continues on following page]\n\nSE: This is the Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, interview with Edith R. Wyle. This is Sharon Emanuelli, the interviewer, and this is tape number three, in the second session. Okay, what were you speaking about?\n\nEW: Let's see. I was talking about the studio. Right, which became the center of my life and how I would get home late, late in the evening and how when I. . . . It took me a long time to get over resenting my family for interfering with the fact that I really needed to be up there painting, till I finally came to terms with that and realized that it wasn't their fault. And I began to give them quality time even though it wasn't quantity time. I was never good at the PTA or any of that sort of thing, and a lot of other people I knew resented that in me, but I think my children turned out all right, so. . . . Anyhow, the group that were up there that. . . . Teresa Ptaczinski was up there. Teresa, she's gone back to her maiden name, Teresa Sorci. And she was married to Bill Ptaczinski. [pronounced tah-shin-ski-Trans.]. Bill was a fine artist. He was very good. He was Rico's. . . . He became sort of a helper to Rico [Lebrun-Ed.] in his studio, and I thought Teresa was. . . . I liked her work even better. To me, Teresa was the best painter that we had up there. She was awfully good. I just loved what she did. We called her the \"Mad Sicilian.\" She had a Sicilian heritage. Have you ever met her?\n\nSE: Hm-mm. [shaking head no]\n\nEW: You never have. She was awfully, really very good. Eventually Bill obtained a job teaching at UC Santa Barbara, and they moved up there.\n\nSE: Where was Howard [Warshaw-Ed.] teaching at this time?\n\nEW: Howard also had a job teaching at UC Santa Barbara first, and he may have had something to do with Bill getting there. I don't know. But he became one of their shining-light professors at UC Santa Barbara. He loved it.\n\nSE: Did he move up there?\n\nEW: He moved up there, yes. He really took to it. For a while he came back and forth, and then when it became a sure thing he moved up there. He loved the academic life, but unfortunately he became sick. Amazing. It's dstill hard for me to believe that such a healthy, strong, strapping man could get so sick and could die so quickly, but he did. Anyhow, the group up at the studio was very nice and we were all very close, and my closest friend was Cornelia [Foss-Ed.]. We shared a studio. No, I guess she had the room next door to me, that's right. They opened into each other. Our work was very different, but she goofed off a lot and I didn't in those days. Now she exists to get into her studio! And I think that's fine. So I was in that studio until Rico became. . . . Well, first of all Rico was asked to be the artist in residence for a year at Yale, to replace the abstract artist who was the head of that department-that school there practically. Beginning with an \"A.\"\n\nSE: Joseph Albers.\n\nEW: Joseph Albers. He took Joseph Albers' place for that year. And as I understand it, the graduate students almost all had nervous breakdowns because the contrast between Albers and Lebrun was enormous, and Albers was supposed to stay away and didn't. Albers used to come in and look over the students' work and get upset. It was a tough situation. Some good artists stayed happily with Rico. One of them was Sheila Hicks. Interestingly enough, she became a really close friend of Rico's and Constance's [Rico's wife-Ed.]. After that Rico had a year abroad as the artist in residence at the American Academy of Art in Rome, so he was also away during that period. I was up in our studio, of course, that whole time. We all were there. Except I guess Cornelia by then had moved east. Ruth Greenberg was up there. She was the only more or less beginning painter. He took her as an experiment. Actually. "
