        "text": "A short note from a Billboard story: REO Speedwagon are looking to commemorate the 30th of Hi Infidelity with a deluxe reissue and tour. Released at the end of 1980 and one of the biggest sellers of 1981, Hi Infidelity was something of a renaissance for the band, taking them from lower Top 40 success to chart-topping dominance. Aided by a clutch of hits including the undying No. 1 ballad \"Keep on Loving You\" and the Top 5 follow-up \"Take It on the Run,\" Hi Infidelity went nine times\n\nThe latest Rhino Handmade title is That On the Road Look \"Live,\" a rumored live album by Tony Joe White - finally revealed to be true. White was a Louisiana-bred guitarist famous mostly for his compositions rather than his own performances. \"Polk Salad Annie\" was his biggest hit, but it's primarily known as a concert staple during Elvis' last decade. \"Rainy Night in Georgia\" was also his composition, though Brook Benton made it a gold-seller in 1970. But this live set - the recording date and\n\nJust a quick heads-up that The Second Disc's giveaway for a decidedly non-catalogue (but still pretty notable) live show ends this Friday, July 30. Thanks to Sony's RED Distribution, we're giving away a pair of tickets to see Chris Shiflett and The Dead Peasants. Shiflett, currently the lead guitarist for The Foo Fighters and also known for his work with Me First and The Gimme Gimmes and others, released a roots-oriented LP with new band The Dead Peasants (hear here). The pair of tickets is\n\nThis week's Reissue Theory is something a bit different: a proposal to reissue a record that's never actually been released! When people talk about phenomenal live artists, the conversation doesn't often turn toward Sting's solo career. The Police were a hell of a live act - they built their career on constant touring all over the world - but Sting's solo career, however good, always has an air of stuffiness to it. How could the same singer currently on tour with a symphony orchestra ever be\n\nThe above picture is a bit of a shock, if you haven't seen it yet: all four of the surviving members of The Cars - Ric Ocasek, Elliott Easton, Greg Hawkes and David Robinson - in a recording studio. It was posted to the official Facebook page for the Boston-based rockers on Thursday. No caption, no explanation. Just the members of The Cars, possibly gearing up for some new music. And who'd have thought? Since the band broke up in 1988, chances seemed slim where a reunion was concerned. The\n\nIf sensitive composer/producer Brian Wilson was the soul of The Beach Boys, and brash frontman Mike Love the voice, passionate singer/guitarist Carl Wilson was no doubt the heart. There was little Carl Wilson couldn’t do, vocally, whether the angelic tones of “God Only Knows,” the soulful shouting of “I Was Made to Love Her” or the dreamlike psychedelia of “Feel Flows.” And when brother Brian wasn’t able to guide the band through the tumultuous 1970s, Carl stepped up to the plate with an amazing\n\nThanks to our friends at MusicTAP for the tip that, on August 24, Legacy will celebrate the life of a great lady of song with its release of The Essential Lena Horne: The RCA Years. Like The Essential Henry Mancini (scheduled to be released on the same day), this release is far from definitive, but appears to be a solid introduction to one period of the late Horne’s magnificent career. That career saw the artist rising from her nightclub roots to break racial barriers in Hollywood, becoming one\n\nIt is with the greatest pride that The Second Disc presents its first-ever interview, bringing you closer to the catalogue music world we all love so much. Our first interviewee is one of the most notable names from the world of reissues. Harry Weinger, vice-president of A&R for Universal Music Enterprises, has been part of the music business for more than 30 years, writing for publications like Rolling Stone, Vibe, Billboard and Cashbox before becoming a staff writer for PolyGram's\n\nA quick heads-up on the awaited pre-order for Elvis Presley's The Complete Masters box set: just got word from Legacy that the pre-order date is now August 2 rather than tomorrow. A track list will be available when it's up. Rest easy, friends - this is still happening!\n\nThe Grateful Dead is releasing a five-LP box set containing reissues of the band's first five studio albums for Warner Bros. records. Collectors will want to take note that this box will include the original mixes of Anthem of the Sun and Aoxomoxoa, which have not been released since the original LPs came out. The set is due on September 21; pre-orders placed now get a bonus reproductions of a 7\" single and a vintage promo poster. While we await tomorrow's pre-order date for a crazy-enormous\n\nWe catalogue music enthusiasts just can't get enough. Near-universal acclaim greeted Kritzerland on its re-release of the original cast album of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's Promises, Promises, including from your humble correspondent. Yet many of those cheers were quickly followed in the fan community by: \"Now, when are you going to release the London Cast Recording?\" The long-lost United Artists LP was recorded in 1969 with the stars of the production at the Prince of Wales Theatre: Tony\n\nHenry Mancini’s film score work has been anthologized numerous times, and the latest such release is due August 24 from Legacy as part of their ongoing The Essential… series. The Essential Henry Mancini is a 2-disc overview containing 36 tracks, dating between 1958 and 1983. During that time, Mancini was one of Hollywood’s most prolific composers, creating memorable themes for the big and little screens alike. Mancini’s longterm collaboration with Blake Edwards ranks with the Danny Elfman/Tim\n\nWhile the original British Invasion is now just a few years south of 50, its music continues to endure. The Second Disc is pleased to report on a trio of new releases coming our way from two of the U.K.’s seminal artists, The Searchers and Petula Clark. One of the best and most successful bands to come out of Liverpool, The Searchers may have toiled in the shadow of that other band from Liverpool, but hits like “Sugar and Spice,” “Pins and Needles” and “When You Walk in the Room” remain some of\n\nIt turns out the reissue of Batman wasn't the only Danny Elfman-related catalogue news at this year's San Diego Comic-Con: Elfman shared at a panel discussion that Warner Bros. is planning a box set devoted to the composer's longtime collaboration with director Tim Burton. It's not much of a surprise that such a set would happen. Burton and Elfman's collaboration is one of the strongest director-composer bonds in Hollywood. And while neither men are collaborating with the kind of urgently great\n\nIt looks like we finally can expect Paul McCartney's Concord catalogue program to start up on September 28. Amazon has a pre-order link up for the promised reissue of Band on the Run for that date. That same date also sees a new title from Legacy: a CD/DVD edition of George Michael's excellent solo debut Faith (1987). You can pre-order it as well, though there's no word on bonus content yet (or if it will be included as a Legacy Edition title). (Thanks to Pause & Play for both\n\nHere's a fantastic justification for the lack of posting today: The Second Disc has recently been preparing some interviews with some interesting characters within the reissue world. One of the interviews was conducted today with none other than Harry Weinger, vice-president of A&R for Universal Music Enterprises and gatekeeper of the catalogues for great soul labels and artists from Motown to James Brown. The full interview will be yours to read on Monday, but for now The Second Disc\n\nThere are plenty of moviegoers in any given week who look at the films playing at their local theatre, shake their head and conclude that Hollywood is no longer making movies for \"them.\" One only wonders how the winter of 1994 was for that crowd when Reality Bites was released. One of the most explicitly Generation X movies ever created, Reality Bites follows the trials and tribulations of a group of twentysomethings in 1990s Houston. There's Leilaina (Wynona Ryder), a college valedictorian\n\nWhat has it been, two weeks since The Second Disc promised a continuation of our Back Tracks series regarding the Apple Records discography? Regardless of the gap, it's time to continue our look back. Part 1 covered all the previous reissues of the records that are to be reissued in October. Part 2 will cover all the Apple releases that involve The Beatles; by this, we mean anything that had a Beatle involved by name.* (For the sake of clarity, we're not including anything actually by The\n\nA bit of news that had slipped through the cracks: a reissue of a lesser-known record in the Iggy Pop catalogue. This one is a remixed and remastered version of Kill City, his 1977 collaboration with James Williamson. Recorded in 1975 after The Stooges imploded (while Pop was in treatment for a heroin addiction), Kill City is another protopunk effort with some great efforts by Williamson (ex-guitarist for The Stooges). While it may not have the impact that those Stooges LPs still have, it was\n\nRhino has released official details about the upcoming 2oth anniversary editions of Pantera's major-label debut, Cowboys from Hell. A press release details three different sets: an Expanded Edition which pairs the remastered original album with a bonus disc of live content (taken from an commercially-unreleased radio broadcast and an import-only EP), a Deluxe Edition which adds a third disc of demos (including a new vault track, \"The Will to Survive\") and an Ultimate Edition (to be released in\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area music scene of the 1960s was certainly one of the most fertile at that time or any other; groups of such prodigious invention as The Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Quicksilver Messenger Service all thrived and found a national audience. With apologies to The Dead, though, the longest and strangest trip of all may have been taken by the Bay Area's own Jefferson Airplane. Drawing on blues, rock, folk, jazz and psychedelia, the Airplane carved out a niche\n\nWith no shortage of catalogue film score news and announcements in the past week, The Second Disc adds to that with two releases from Intrada and a few rumblings about La La Land. First, the releases: Lalo Schifrin's score to the newspaper drama The Mean Season and George Delerue's fanciful score to the Glenn Close comedy Maxie, both released in 1985, are getting their first-ever releases as part of Intrada's Special Collection. Both albums feature a new sequencing experiment for the label: big\n\nThis is shaping up to be an exciting week for classic soundtrack fans. Hot on the heels of Film Score Monthly’s announcement of a Bronislau Kaper collection, Kritzerland unveiled its latest release Monday morning: Marvin Hamlisch’s score to the 1983 film Romantic Comedy. Hamlisch is too often underrated in the film scoring department, although can you really call someone underrated who has amassed three Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, four Emmy Awards, four Grammy Awards, a Tony Award and\n\nA quick heads-up from our friends at Pause & Play: Amazon has put up a listing for a deluxe edition of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers' Damn the Torpedoes to be released by Geffen and Universal Music Enterprises. There's no info other than a release date (October 12), but hopefully there'll be some good vault material present. Damn the Torpedoes was The Heartbreakers' first LP for MCA, following the sale of Shelter Records to the label. It featured the band's first Top 10 hit, \"Don't Do Me"
