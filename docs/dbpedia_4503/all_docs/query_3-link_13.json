        "text": "We catalogue music enthusiasts just can't get enough. Near-universal acclaim greeted Kritzerland on its re-release of the original cast album of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's Promises, Promises, including from your humble correspondent. Yet many of those cheers were quickly followed in the fan community by: \"Now, when are you going to release the London Cast Recording?\" The long-lost United Artists LP was recorded in 1969 with the stars of the production at the Prince of Wales Theatre: Tony\n\nHenry Mancini’s film score work has been anthologized numerous times, and the latest such release is due August 24 from Legacy as part of their ongoing The Essential… series. The Essential Henry Mancini is a 2-disc overview containing 36 tracks, dating between 1958 and 1983. During that time, Mancini was one of Hollywood’s most prolific composers, creating memorable themes for the big and little screens alike. Mancini’s longterm collaboration with Blake Edwards ranks with the Danny Elfman/Tim\n\nWhile the original British Invasion is now just a few years south of 50, its music continues to endure. The Second Disc is pleased to report on a trio of new releases coming our way from two of the U.K.’s seminal artists, The Searchers and Petula Clark. One of the best and most successful bands to come out of Liverpool, The Searchers may have toiled in the shadow of that other band from Liverpool, but hits like “Sugar and Spice,” “Pins and Needles” and “When You Walk in the Room” remain some of\n\nIt turns out the reissue of Batman wasn't the only Danny Elfman-related catalogue news at this year's San Diego Comic-Con: Elfman shared at a panel discussion that Warner Bros. is planning a box set devoted to the composer's longtime collaboration with director Tim Burton. It's not much of a surprise that such a set would happen. Burton and Elfman's collaboration is one of the strongest director-composer bonds in Hollywood. And while neither men are collaborating with the kind of urgently great\n\nHere's a fantastic justification for the lack of posting today: The Second Disc has recently been preparing some interviews with some interesting characters within the reissue world. One of the interviews was conducted today with none other than Harry Weinger, vice-president of A&R for Universal Music Enterprises and gatekeeper of the catalogues for great soul labels and artists from Motown to James Brown. The full interview will be yours to read on Monday, but for now The Second Disc\n\nThere are plenty of moviegoers in any given week who look at the films playing at their local theatre, shake their head and conclude that Hollywood is no longer making movies for \"them.\" One only wonders how the winter of 1994 was for that crowd when Reality Bites was released. One of the most explicitly Generation X movies ever created, Reality Bites follows the trials and tribulations of a group of twentysomethings in 1990s Houston. There's Leilaina (Wynona Ryder), a college valedictorian\n\nWhat has it been, two weeks since The Second Disc promised a continuation of our Back Tracks series regarding the Apple Records discography? Regardless of the gap, it's time to continue our look back. Part 1 covered all the previous reissues of the records that are to be reissued in October. Part 2 will cover all the Apple releases that involve The Beatles; by this, we mean anything that had a Beatle involved by name.* (For the sake of clarity, we're not including anything actually by The\n\nA bit of news that had slipped through the cracks: a reissue of a lesser-known record in the Iggy Pop catalogue. This one is a remixed and remastered version of Kill City, his 1977 collaboration with James Williamson. Recorded in 1975 after The Stooges imploded (while Pop was in treatment for a heroin addiction), Kill City is another protopunk effort with some great efforts by Williamson (ex-guitarist for The Stooges). While it may not have the impact that those Stooges LPs still have, it was\n\nThe San Francisco Bay Area music scene of the 1960s was certainly one of the most fertile at that time or any other; groups of such prodigious invention as The Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Quicksilver Messenger Service all thrived and found a national audience. With apologies to The Dead, though, the longest and strangest trip of all may have been taken by the Bay Area's own Jefferson Airplane. Drawing on blues, rock, folk, jazz and psychedelia, the Airplane carved out a niche\n\nWith no shortage of catalogue film score news and announcements in the past week, The Second Disc adds to that with two releases from Intrada and a few rumblings about La La Land. First, the releases: Lalo Schifrin's score to the newspaper drama The Mean Season and George Delerue's fanciful score to the Glenn Close comedy Maxie, both released in 1985, are getting their first-ever releases as part of Intrada's Special Collection. Both albums feature a new sequencing experiment for the label: big\n\nThis is shaping up to be an exciting week for classic soundtrack fans. Hot on the heels of Film Score Monthly’s announcement of a Bronislau Kaper collection, Kritzerland unveiled its latest release Monday morning: Marvin Hamlisch’s score to the 1983 film Romantic Comedy. Hamlisch is too often underrated in the film scoring department, although can you really call someone underrated who has amassed three Academy Awards, three Golden Globes, four Emmy Awards, four Grammy Awards, a Tony Award and\n\nToday's installment of Reissue Theory is going to tread over familiar ground, in honor of two bands who turned out some great live sets last night at New Jersey's State Theater: Cheap Trick and Squeeze. Though both bands have their share of hardcore fanatics, they didn't seem to be as vocal last night - at least one person was heard musing after the show that neither band catered to the greatest-hits crowd (Cheap Trick's set mixed most of the favorite early tracks with new material - the band\n\nThere's rarely such a thing as a Monday matinee, but that won't keep The Second Disc from ushering in the week with news of a quintet of reissues from our friends at Film Score Monthly and Sepia Records. These exciting releases are sure to please devotees of both soundtracks and cast albums. Film Score Monthly kicks things off with their new release of BUtterfield 8: Bronislau Kaper at M-G-M, Volume 1 (FSM 1309). Kaper rarely seems to be afforded the acclaim given to many of his contemporaries,\n\nThat's the feeling with which Hip-o Select presents its latest title: a look at some of the last, still-great years of jazz legend Louis Armstrong. The new two-disc set, Hello, Louis! The Hit Years 1963-1969, compiles some of Satchmo's best-known and best-loved works, including the chart-topping show tune \"Hello Dolly!\" (which booted The Beatles' \"Can't Buy Me Love\" from the top slot), the endearing \"What a Wonderful World\" and the gorgeous \"We Have All the Time in the World,\" the theme to the\n\nFor whatever cosmic reason, 1984 was a huge cosmic intersection for pop music and film. Prince exploded into the national consciousness with Purple Rain, Kenny Loggins continued his run as America's go-to soundtrack guy with his contributions to Footloose. Stevie Wonder called The Woman in Red to say he loved her, Harold Faltermeyer helped make Eddie Murphy a superstar with \"Axel F.\" from Beverly Hills Cop. Even Phil Collins had a soundtrack hit, against all odds. And then there was\n\nThanks to MusicTAP for the tip-off to this one: Eagle Rock has set an August 10 release date for Roy Orbison: The Last Concert, a CD version of Orbison's final show. Recorded at the Front Row Theater in Highland Heights, Ohio on December 4, 1988 - two days before Orbison died of a heart attack at the too-young age of 52 - the set shows Orbison at the height of his mid-'80s resurgence, with a set leaning heavily on his early solo hits. The Last Concert was first released in 2008 on iTunes, to\n\nOur resident Beatles/Apple sage Phil Cohen noted The Second Disc that there was some preliminary info on the track lists for the upcoming Apple reissues. To quote him, from a comment on our Back Tracks post on previous issues of these albums (Part 2 is due very soon - we promise - and will cover previous reissues of all the other material on Apple, including The Beatles-oriented stuff): Some preliminary info about the Apple releases is available via a link at The Beatles official website. There\n\nEMI has announced a deluxe edition of Queensrÿche's Empire for the album's 20th anniversary. The LP, the band's most successful in the U.S. thanks to Top 10 hit \"Silent Lucidity,\" will feature three B-sides (previously included on a remastered edition in 2003) and a bonus disc of unreleased material recorded live at London's Hammersmith Odeon in 1990. Like many of EMI's recent reissues, the set will be packed in a lidded box with some extra collectible cards and posters inside. This set is to\n\nA fun little tidbit from release date king Pause & Play, himself a diligent arts journalist who just recently got to interview the members of Crowded House (their new album, Intriguer, was released this week). At the suggestion of some cheeky catalogue music blogger, P&P asked the members of the band if there were ever any plans to expand the band's catalogue on CD. (The Crowded House discography is relatively free of B-sides, compared to some of their contemporaries, but demos and\n\nIt's not hard to see why Nik Kershaw was considered a teen idol in the 1980s, but it is hard to understand why this was the case after listening to his music. The British guitarist released several great albums of atmospheric yet accessible guitar pop-rock, but it seemed a bit heavier than the usual teen idol fare of generations past or future. Kershaw's best-known output don't deal with typical teen fare. His biggest singles, \"Wouldn't It Be Good,\" \"I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\" and \"The\n\n[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AdEHOta-Uc] La-La Land Records has announced its next batch of catalogue soundtrack reissues - and they're two big names to fans of '80s action/fantasy films. Danny Elfman's iconic score to the 1989 film version of Batman and James Horner's music from Krull (1983) are getting lavish expanded releases for the month of July. Batman, part of La-La Land's Expanded Archival Collection series, will feature, for the first time ever, the full score as\n\n“If you like pina coladas, and getting caught in the rain”…Come on, you know how it goes, sing along…“If you’re not into yoga, if you have half a brain…” So goes the song that got Rupert Holmes into the record books as singer/songwriter of the last No. 1 hit of the 1970s and the first of the 1980s. While it may be the most famous song penned by the idiosyncratic artist/composer/producer (and collaborator of artists ranging from Streisand to Sparks!), it’s merely the tip of the iceberg for Rupert\n\nImmense praise to Slicing Up Eyeballs for bringing this story to our attention: EMI have released a statement regarding the mastering of the last two entries in the ongoing Duran Duran remaster series. And it ain't pretty. If you've been following this story at all, through ICE or Amazon or even our own review of the first album, here's how it goes: the new reissues of Duran Duran (1981) and Seven and the Ragged Tiger (1983), while stuffed with some great bonus content, suffer thanks to\n\nIt was 25 years ago today that two massive, historic concerts were organized for African famine relief. Live Aid, performed in London's Wembley Arena and Philadelphia's JFK Stadium on July 13, 1985, was one of those rare overblown rock success stories - dozens of superstars and members of rock royalty coming together not at the behest of a politician or a natural disaster, but simply because it seemed the right thing to do. It raised millions for charity, it provided a massive plug for the"
