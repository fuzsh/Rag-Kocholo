No son was ever more dutifully attached to a parent than was the young Duc de Reichstadt to the Emperor Napoleon, and, though educated amid the luxuries and intrigues of the Austrian Court, his heart retained all the pristine impressions of his childhood. Had he been destined to succeed Napoleon on the Throne of France, the world would have had to hail a Prince as good as his Father was brave. It was at Vienna that the young Duke first heard the Waltz which now bears his name, but it was not until his departure from thence that the following lines, a true transcript of his feelings, were adapted to his favourite Air.
