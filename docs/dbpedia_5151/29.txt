The following narrative was published in "Descendants of Reinold and Matthew Marvin of Hartford, CT., 1638 and 1635 Sons of Edward Marvin, of Great Bentley, England" by George Franklin Marvin & William T.R. Marvin (1904):

"26 February, 1701, twenty-eight acres of land were "layd out by the Town's Committe" to John Marvin; this land was on "the Danberry Roads," and eight acres of it was "on his father Marvin's account" 16 December, 1708, he was appointed town collector. When the meetinghouse was seated in 1710, John was assigned "ye seat before ye hinde pillar." 14 December, 1711, he was chosen surveyor of highways, and 18 December, 1712, he was on a committee to obtain a teacher for the school. He was chosen selectman 1706, '13 and '19, in which year he is called "sergeant," and he, or possibly his son John, called "sergeant," in 1738 and '40; he was a constable in 1717; fence viewer, 1721 and '29; "lyster," 1724. In 1734 and '38 he represented Norwalk in the Legislature. In 1718 he with others was chosen to lay before "a wise and judicious committee" the "surcomstances of ye town in their present differences respecting the meeting-house." 1734, with Joseph Platt, he was appointed to lay out the land granted by the town "in ye plain before Lt. Lee's door," for St. Paul's Church.

18 Nov., 1737, he gave a lot of land eight rods square to the "Presbiterian or Congregational church of Wilton, on which to erect a meetinghouse." He confirmed this by deed of 6 May, 1738, in which he said "among the congregation are some of my children," naming John as one.

21 Jan'y, 1752, he bought for Â£2400 the farm previously owned by his son John in Sharon, and not long after settled there; he is called of Norwalk 1 Nov., 1754, and of Sharon 17 March, 1756, where he owned several other parcels of land, and soon after his purchase (11 May, 1752) he deeded to his "loveing son Joseph Marvine of Norwark," a lot, for "love, good-will, and affection." Joseph was appointed administrator of his father's will 7 May, 1774."
