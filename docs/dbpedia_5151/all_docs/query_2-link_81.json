He is survived by his wife of 36 years, Rita Mount Warwick, his niece, Samantha Woodham Brown (Eric) and nephew, Warwick Woodham (Lori) and 3 grand nephews, one grand niece and a great-grand nephew.\nJohn was from the long line of Methodist ministers going back to the circuit rider in the North Georgia Mountains.  John broke with tradition and chose college teaching as his profession.  He earned a B.A. from Huntingdon College, Montgomery, Alabama, M.F.A. from the University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa and a Ph.D. in creative writing from Georgia State University, Atlanta.  He taught English and Literature in colleges and universities in Georgia and Alabama for over 40 years.  He was an accomplished poet and winner of several honors including First Prize National Winner of the Hackney Award, First Place in 1992 and Second Place in 1993, Georgia State University Review, Kenneth M. England Prizes.  He was published in well known national poetry reviews and was included in The Made Thing, An Anthology of Contemporary Southern Poetry, 2nd Ed. and in Alabama Poets: A Contemporary Anthology.\nDue to Covid-19 a memorial will be planned later this year.
