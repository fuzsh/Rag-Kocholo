However, for those that may be here for a week and would like to see the area we have compiled a list of things to do, including hiking, shopping, museums, dining, and more.\n\nDirections can also be found in the Office on the wall.\n\nAll of the attractions listed have an estimated travel time between 5 minutes and 2 hours."
