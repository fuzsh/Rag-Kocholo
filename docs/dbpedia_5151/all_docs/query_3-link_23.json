        "text": "The local area surrounding Sharon Country Inn is rich with many attractions and events, dining and shopping, or just relaxing and pampering.\n\nOur area is peppered with a variety of dining selections for you to enjoy your choice of French, Italian, and American cuisines, or freshly prepared Japanese delicacies. If you prefer to stay in, you can enjoy tasty Italian entreés and pizzas delivered free to your room from Mizza’s Pizza Restaurant, only 10 minutes away.\n\nIf your interests are hiking, biking, water sports or picnicking, the Appalachian Trail runs along the east edge of Sharon through the Mohawk and Housatonic state forests. Sharon also is home to Audubon Sharon and the Miles Wildlife Sanctuary, full of miles of trails, rehabilitating animals, visitor center, and nature store. The Housatonic River runs north to south next door through the towns of Falls Village, West Cornwall, and Cornwall Bridge, for fly-fishing, tubing, kayaking, and canoeing. Nearby Sheffield, MA is home to Bartholomew’s Cobble, 329 acres of challenging hikes over a 1000 foot rise."
