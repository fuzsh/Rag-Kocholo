        "text": "Marvin was a devoted husband to his beloved wife Lois Olson, who passed away in June 2019, after 68 years of marriage. Together, they raised eight children: Connie Olson, Cathie (Tom) Kenney, Carol (John) Anderson, Cindy (Tim) Swan, Gary Olson (Catherine Bean), Christy (Dave) Sargent, Carrin (Joe) Mickelson, and Greg Olson.\n\nMarvin was a proud grandfather of 13 and great-grandfather of 12. He had a great love for his family and enjoyed spending time with them, always keeping up to date with their lives.\n\nIn addition to his family, Marvin had a passion for reading, watching TV shows, and movies on his computer. He was known for his love of Jimmy Dean hot dish and a good cup of coffee. He enjoyed juicing daily and never missed taking his vitamins. He used his Alexa daily to call his family, listen to music, and stay informed about the weather.\n\nMarvin was preceded in death by his wife Lois Olson, father Emil Olson, mother Bertha Olson, brothers Melford and Laurell Olson, and sister Delores Peterson.\n\nA private celebration of life will be held to honor and remember the life of Marvin Olson. He will be deeply missed and always remembered for his love, kindness and great sense of humor."
