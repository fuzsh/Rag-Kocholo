        "text": "It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of John Marvin Fisher, a beloved husband, father, grandfather, and friend. John went to his heavenly home Thursday, November 16, 2023, at the age of 86. A native of Jarvisburg, John was born May 1, 1937, to the late Marvin Belton Fisher and Inez Forbes Fisher, and was lovingly raised by his father and stepmother, the late Gladys Grantham Fisher. John is survived by his wife, Harriet A. Fisher, who stood by his side with unwavering love and support.\n\nAfter attending Louisburg Junior College, John began his career with the Federal Bureau of Investigations. He served the FBI with distinction for thirty-four years, receiving numerous awards throughout his career in recognition and appreciation of his exceptional performance, serving his country with commitment and integrity. John was a man of faith who loved the Lord, his church, and community. He served in the Army National Guard and was on The Salvation Army Advisory Board for over a decade.\n\nBeyond his professional achievements, John was a loving father to his daughter, Susan Christine Robertson. Susan, unfortunately, preceded him in death, leaving a void that John carried in his heart. He was also preceded in death by his first wife, Carolyn Van Brown Fisher.\n\nAlong with his widow, John is survived by his son-in-law, Mike Robertson of Jarvisburg, NC, and leaves behind a lasting legacy through his two grandchildren, Jennifer Anne Fisher (JD) of Kill Devil Hills, NC, and Michael Bryan Roberston of Jarvisburg, NC; one great grandchild, Mason Shogun Fisher of Kill Devil Hills, NC; three step-grandchildren, Reilly Kelly Tyler (Grant), Colin Patrick Kelly, and Michaela Ann Kelly; and step-daughter, Amy R. Kelly (Tim), all of Kill Devil Hills, NC, who will always cherish his memory. His wisdom, guidance, and loving nature have left an indelible mark on all their lives, shaping them into the individuals they are today. Also, surviving is his sister-in-law, Theresa Williams of Buxton, NC; and, brother-in-law, Bruce N. Austin (Amanda) of Point Harbor, NC.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 11:00 a.m. on Saturday, November 25, 2023, at Jarvisburg Church of Christ, 121 Forbes Road, Jarvisburg, NC 27947, with Minister Ronald Lawrence officiating. The family will receive friends and relatives immediately following the service. Burial will be in the Fisher Family Cemetery.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests memorial donations be made in John’s memory to Jarvisburg Church of Christ Building Fund, P.O. Box 16, Jarvisburg, NC 27947 or the Salvation Army of the Albemarle, P.O. Box 11209, Charlotte, NC 28220."
