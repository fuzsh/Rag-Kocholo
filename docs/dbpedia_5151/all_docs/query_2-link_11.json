        "text": "John Marvin Reynolds passed from this world peacefully at age 99 1/2 on January 5, 2024, in Athens, Georgia. He was deeply beloved by family, friends, colleagues, and former students. He was a lover of knowledge, travel, sports, and dedicated to his career as professor and practitioner of dentistry.\n\nMarvin was born in Meadowview, Virginia, on June 25, 1924, to Philip Jerome and Grace Maiden Reynolds. He graduated from high school in May, 1942, and began attending Emory and Henry College the next week. While at Emory and Henry, he enlisted in the V12 Navy Reserve program and completed most of his college courses before he was called up for WWII active duty in 1943. He attended Columbia University for midshipman school, graduated from Emory and Henry College, and reported to duty on the newly commissioned US Little Rock. He was onboard training off Guantanamo Bay when he learned the Japanese had surrendered. After WWII, President Truman sent the US Little Rock on a good will tour around South America and back through the Panama Canal. This tour began a love of travel that continued throughout his life. Onboard ship he was inspired to attend dental school at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond. After graduating, he returned to the military serving (during the Korean War) as a dentist at Parris Island and Camp Lejeune.\n\nHe was a math instructor at Emory and Henry College and a dental professor at West Virginia University, Medical College of Virginia/Virginia Commonwealth University, Southern Illinois University, and retired from the Medical College of Georgia. Marvin was a regular presenter at approximately 300 dental meetings and guest lectures in the US and abroad including Egypt, Italy, Turkey, and Brazil. He wrote chapters in textbooks, manuscripts in professional journals, and was a visiting professor at 11 universities. He was chosen as a consultant to the US Army Veterans Administration, US Army Prosthodontics Residency Program, and Bethesda Naval Hospital programs. A recipient of many awards, Marvin was very proud of receiving the Dr. Harry Lyons Outstanding Dental Alumnus Award in 2012 from Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nMarvinâ€™s enjoyment of sports included playing football in high school and college, trying out for the St. Louis Cardinals, sailing on the Chesapeake Bay, walking South Carolina and Florida beaches, learning to snow ski at age 50, playing golf from his twenties to age 98, making a hole in one in Aiken, South Carolina, and playing at Augusta National.\n\nMarvin was preceded in death by his first wife Jeanne Downing Reynolds and sisters Rosemary Neese and Harriet Reynolds. He is survived by his wife Ann Morgenstern Reynolds, daughter Jeannette Kendall (David), son John Reynolds, sister Jane Bellamy, grandchildren Sarah Kendall Beasley (Andrew), Phillip Kendall, great-grandchildren Miles and Kendall Beasley, nieces and nephews Rose Neese Houk, Steve Bellamy, Tim Bellamy, Kristin Bellamy Hilton, and Lelia Perdue.\n\nMarvin was appreciative of all that he experienced and accomplished in his life. Over the last three decades he established and has donated to these scholarships.\n\n* J.
