        "text": "Comprising 60 square miles, Sharon is the third largest town by area in Connecticut, and yet one of the least dense in terms of population. The result is a scenic and beautiful pastoral town that is one of the most desirable areas to buy property in all of Litchfield County.\n\nSharon is notable for a wide inventory of historically preserved antique colonials and farmhouses, as well as large estates. The town attracts affluent residents and even celebrities such as Kevin Bacon, who has a home in the town. Sharon residents have easy access to the Metro North station in nearby Wassaic, NY, which brings you to and from New York City’s Grand Central Station, a journey that takes about 2 hours and 12 minutes. You can read more about the Sharon real estate market in this profile from the New York Times.\n\nSharon also offers day trippers and tourists plenty of attractions from farm stands, outdoor activities and art. Its location is ideal for easy to access to the Hudson Valley to the west, Berkshires to the north and the rest of Litchfield County to the east and south.\n\nBelow we profile the most notable attractions in the town and village of Sharon, Connecticut.\n\nSharon Playhouse\n\nThe Sharon Playhouse is the cultural hub of the town. A regional, non-profit theater with origins that developed from a “play reading group” started in the 1920s, it has been operating for more than 60 seasons in its current building and format. The playhouse features performances with Broadway-caliber actors and talented local performers. Performances in recent years have included Footloose, Anything Goes and Beauty & The Beast. Beyond traditional performances, the theater offers the community children’s programming, theater workshops and other educational opportunities.\n\nWhile 2020 was a difficult year for Sharon Playhouse (like all theaters and performance spaces) the summer of 2021 looks more promising, with scheduled theater workshops and a youth theater program planned for this summer.\n\nHopefully as the world returns to normal we will see a full slate of performances scheduled at this community staple in the near future. Keep an eye on their web site for more updates as to when additional performances will be added.\n\nSharon Historical Society & Museum\n\nLocated in a beautifully preserved 1775-built home on Main Street, the Sharon Historical Society & Museum Allows you to explore the 275 years of established history in the area. Permanent collections range from colonial American furniture, iron and iron-industry artifacts, decorative arts and portrait and photo collections from notable local artists. There is also a reading room featuring historic property records in case you want to learn more about the family who lived in the antique colonial home you purchased in the area.
