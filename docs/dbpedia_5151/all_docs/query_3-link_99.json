I created this to hopefully give people a different perspective of what I do. What I enjoy about the blog as a medium, is it feels like a pet that needs to be fed in order to be happy and grow. Hopefully this isn’t like every fish I’ve ever owned and I can keep it alive! -g View all posts by garow311"
