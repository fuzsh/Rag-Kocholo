        "text": "Born May 18th 1932 and died September 21st 2020, one year to the day after his son was killed at the Frederick County Fair. John Weed died in Mount Airy Maryland. He was an Army Veteran who served in Korea. He was a lifelong resident of Wheaton, Maryland until 2018, when he move to Mount Airy Maryland to live with his daughter. He was an avid hunter, fisherman and do-anything outdoorsman. He was a meat cutter by trade; and hunters from all over Maryland, Virginia and DC would come to have their deer cut up by him.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Frances, his daughter Lori Hawkins, his son Shawn, his granddaughters Jessica and Nichole, and his great-grandchildren Makayla and Mason.\n\nHe was a loving husband, and he never in 63 years forgot their wedding anniversary. He was a hands-on father who took his time to teach his children his passions of hunting and fishing and, he gave them money for the ice cream man in the summer.\n\nHe was a funny grandfather, who taught his Grand daughters to ride ATVs and enjoy the outdoors at their cabin in West Virginia. He was a lovable great-grandfather who helped fix breakfast, gave rides on the riding lawn mower, curled up on the couch to watch TV and tried to make sure Makayla and Mason ate their vegetables.\n\nHe will be missed by so many but we as a family find comfort in the fact that he passed on the 1 year anniversary of his son John Jr.'s (Jay) death."
