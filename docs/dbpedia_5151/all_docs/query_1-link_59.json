        "text": "Marvin Chester O’Hearn Jr, 66, of East Hampton, beloved husband of Cathy (Wolf) O’Hearn, passed away peacefully at his home surrounded by his loving family on Thursday June 22nd. Born Feb. 26, 1957 in Anchorage, Alaska he was the son of Myrna (Camenga) Yanovich of Florida and the late Marvin C. O’Hearn Sr, also predeceased by his step-father John (Jack) Yanovich. Marvin was a truck driver for Bailey’s Express Inc. and a member of the Teamsters Local #671 for 30 years until his retirement.\n\nBesides his wife and mother, he is survived by his sons Jason O’Hearn and wife Leah of East Hampton, Jared O’Hearn and fiancée Paige Julbe of Colchester, brother Michael O’Hearn and wife Ruth of VT., two sisters Patricia Berger of CA., Kelli Geddeis and husband Brad of FL., and his six beloved grandchildren; Grayden, Aubree, Cooper, Alison, Zeplyn, and Nova. Very loved son-in-law to Dorothy A. Wolf and the late John W. Wolf. Brother-in-law to Susan, Tom, Sharon, Robert, Rick and Heidi and the late William (Bill) Wolf. Admired uncle to many nieces and nephews.\n\nIn his high school days, Marvin enjoyed burning out in the parking lot of East Hampton High School in his Plymouth Duster and could be found after school at Thatcher’s Four Corners leaning over the mailbox watching traffic and waving to people. Marvin had simple hobbies of never missing a car show, always being available for breakfast with many friends at various places (followed by a nap in the recliner), and putting some miles on his zero-turn mower; Dodge challenger or pickup truck. He could always talk about the weather, especially his favorite season winter, where he would anxiously await the next big storm to break out his plow truck. Need detailed driving directions or the best car wash? – Marv was your guy! Although quiet and soft spoken- he was a great communicator to family and friends by always calling to check in. Marvin, above all, was a loving devoted family man. He always showed up for his sons’ accomplishments and each one of his grandkid’s events. His presence will be missed immeasurably.\n\nFriends may call at Spencer Funeral Home 112 Main St. East Hampton on Saturday, July 1st from 9:00 – 10:30 am. In lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to a charity of your choice. To leave online condolences please visit www.spencerfuneralhomeinc.com."
