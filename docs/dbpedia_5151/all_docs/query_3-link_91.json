Fiber is the most reliable internet you can get, so we recommend that if it’s available.\n\nTest your internet speed\n\nIs your home internet fast enough to meet your daily Wi-Fi needs? The best way to find out is by running a speed test, which gives you a snapshot of how much bandwidth you’re getting from your internet provider. Run the test over a hardwired ethernet connection for the most accurate results, and try taking the test at different times throughout the day to measure possible fluctuations in your download speed, upload speed, and latency.\n\nIf you have trouble getting things done online with the speed-test results you’re getting, consider upgrading to a faster plan or switching internet providers.\n\nThere was an error initializing the test.
