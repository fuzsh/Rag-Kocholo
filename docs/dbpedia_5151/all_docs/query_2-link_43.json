        "text": "Alex Murdaugh's defense team was making their case on a national stage.\n\nIt follows a motion filed Tuesday pushing to get former attorney and convicted murderer Murdaugh a new trial.\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Colleton County case is back in the spotlight again. Recently, News 4 spoke with Murdaugh's brother John Marvin, who told her that he was shocked by these allegations of jury tampering by the Colleton County Clerk of Court Becky Hill.\n\nMarvin said he doesn't know if it's true or not, but if it is, it's terrible for anybody to have their rights violated for a fair trial, and of course, that includes his brother.\n\n“As soon as the verdict was rendered, we had gotten some indication from folks in the courtroom that something untoward had happened in the jury room,” said Murdaugh defense attorney Jim Griffin.\n\nThe defense attorneys say several jurors provided affidavits alleging misconduct after Hill published her tell-all book, and they outlined the claims Wednesday on ABC’s Good Morning America.\n\nRead more:\n\n“We have affidavits from two jurors and sworn affidavits from other jurors that indicate the Clerk of Court (Becky Hill) went into the jury room prior to us presenting our case saying ‘don’t be confused, don’t be persuaded,’ when Alex Murdaugh was testifying ‘don’t believe him,’” said attorney Dick Harpootlian.\n\nNews 4 exclusive legal analyst and former state attorney general Charlie Condon says the sworn affidavits by the jurors are game changers.\n\n“What the defense is alleging is very specific allegations of improper direct contact with jurors,” said Condon.\n\nHill's co-author Neil Gordon of Behind the Doors of Justice: The Murdaugh Murders defended the county clerk and her conduct with these jurors.\n\nRead more:\n\n“As I watched the news conference, I was just shocked by some of the allegations that were being made. I spent six months with Becky, nights, weekends, in person, on Zoom, and on the phone, and I asked her every question every which way about her interactions with all of her responsible parties, I mean she had to work with the judge, the jury, the witnesses, the media, the public, the attorneys and never once did I hear anything of this sort,” said Gordon.\n\nMurdaugh now wants an evidentiary hearing to decide whether his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and whether there are grounds for a new double murder trial.\n\nThe South Carolina Attorney General's office has nine more days to respond to the filing. News 4 reached out multiple times to Becky Hill. News 4 confirmed she has two lawyers, one of whom is SC Representative Justin Bamberg."
