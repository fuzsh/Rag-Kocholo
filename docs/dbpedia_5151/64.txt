Two-year old, Jack Marvin tragically lost his father, John Marvin, on January 27, 2012. Only 28 years old, John died in an off-duty accident. John, a Coventry native, was a two-year veteran of the Hartford Police Department and an active Sergeant in the Connecticut National Guard. Prior to joining the Hartford Police Department, he served in the Navy, for six years. Marvin had served overseas with Operation Iraqi Freedom for which he earned multiple prestigious awards. John was a loving father taken from his son too early. Only four months later, on June 1, 2012, the unexpected happened. Jack lost his Uncle James Marvin due to illness. At 25 years old, James had already served in the Navy, was a highly decorated member of the National Guard, served in Afghanistan as a specialist for Operation Enduring Freedom, and was a four-year veteran of the Hartford Police. James was very committed to his community and his country. Like John, Jamesâ€™ upbeat personality and carefree spirit brightened the lives of many.
