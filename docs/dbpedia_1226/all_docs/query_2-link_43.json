        "text": "Sylva Autokits is a kit car manufacturer based in Lincolnshire, England. Sylva was founded in 1981 by Jeremy Phillips and has developed and produced a number of small and lightweight sports cars. Sylva cars have proven very successful in competition, winning a number of 750 Motor Club Kit Car championships.\n\nSylva has sold many of its older designs to other kit car manufacturers, such as selling the Fury to Fisher Sportscars, the Stylus to Specialist Sports Cars, and the Striker to Raw Engineering. By doing so, Jeremy Phillips and Sylva have been able to focus on newer designs and ideas, such as the current Sylva Mojo 2 and R1ot.]\n\nModels\n\n-Star\n\nTwo Sylva Stars, one with Fiat 2ltr Twincam the other Ford Zetec\n\nThe first Sylva car launched in 1982. The Sylva Star kit was based on a purpose built two seater chassis using the front subframe and the rear axle from a donor Vauxhall Viva the car was most often powered by 1300 and 1600 four cylinder Ford Kent crossflow engines, though other engine options were available. The Sylva Star was the first in a long line of small, agile two seater open top cars designed by Jeremy Phillips and built for fun and economy.\n\n- Leader\n\nThe Sylva Leader was an evolution of the Sylva Star retaining the two seater, open top, layout but with improved design features. The two piece fiberglass body consisted of a front hinging bonnet (hood) and low sided passenger compartment. Engine options were Ford Kent Crossflow and Fiat Twin cam engines. Some Sylva Star owners replaced the front with the narrower and more curved Leader front body piece.\n\nThe manufacturing rights for the Leader were first sold to Nials Johannson who continued to make the kits under the name Swindon Sportscars.\n\n- Striker\n\nThe most enduring of the Sylva models the Striker was a radical evolution of the Star and Leader dropping the Viva donor car in favour of purpose built suspension and lighter bodywork. The car was aimed at two markets, the home car builder that required an economical kit that could be built using readily available mechanics tools and the more demanding race car builder who favoured good handling and simple design.\n\n- Phoenix\n\nThe Phoenix was a built for race version of the Striker. The core chassis was similar but the fiberglass bodywork was developed for race purposes with a curved and lowered front and wheel covering outer edges. Used extensively in the kitcar race series the Phoenix is still a popular choice for less expensive end of clubman motorsport. The design was sold by Sylva to Stuart Taylor Motorsport who have since sold it on again. It has recently found a new home with Raw Engineering who also own the rights to the Striker.\n\n- Fury\n\nLaunched in 1991 and sold to Fisher Sportscars in 1994. Currently owned by Fury Sportscars who recently purchased the rights from BGH Geartech., based in Kent UK. The Fury has been very successful in competition with cars currently racing in many championships, including the 750 Motor Club's RGB (Road-Going Bike-Engined Kitcar) and Kitcar series. Many different engines can be fitted to the Fury, including all manner of car engines from the Ford Crossflow to Rover V8 and Cosworth Turbo. Motorbike engines have also been fitted and are popular for track cars due to the low weight, high power and built-in sequential gearbox for relatively little morey. There are two versions of the Fury rear suspension, the Live Axle version uses the Ford Escort rear axle located using two trailing links in conjunction with a Panhard rod. Coil over shock absorbers are used to give good ride comfort combined with excellent handling and grip. The Independent Rear Suspension version uses the Ford Sierra rear hub assembly in conjunction with purpose built hub carriers forming the uprights between upper and lower wishbones. Once again, coil over shock absorbers ensure a refined ride quality and excellent traction.\n\n- Stylus\n\nThe first Styluses used a modified Fury chassis, afterwards a purpose built chassis was made to accommodate the lowered doors. The front rocker arms were upgraded with needle bearings and the front lower arms got redesigned to prevent the lower ball joints being damaged. As with most Sylva models, various engines can be fitted.\n\nStylus RT In 2003 the Stylus RT was launched making it a modern looking sportscar.\n\nThe Stylus RT (Road & Track) uses the SSC standard chassis, but with wider front suspension, & use wheel spacers at rear or if De-Dion this can also be made wider. The rear wing was developed at Swansea University in there motorsport dept. The RT also has a full front splitter and a rear diffuser. These 3 aerodynamic aids are optional extras. SSC fitted quad style lights. A standard Stylus can be modified to RT specification.\n\n- Jester\n\nThe Jester Kit has recently been bought by Stingray Motorsport in Ripley, Derbyshire. Working with Jeremy Phillips, Stingray Motorsport has taken the Jester through a full re-development process, the Jester now uses a more modern and easily available donor, the Ford KA. The new Jester is now available, it's simple to build and with adjustable AVO shocks and Cobra seats it should be possible to build a complete car for under £5000.00.\n\n- Mojo\n\nThe Mojo was launched in 2000. It was originally designed around the front-wheel-drive engine and gearbox from a Mk2 Fiesta, but with the whole setup fitted at the rear to give a mid-mounted transverse setup. The Ford CVH engine was standard, but other engines such as Ford Zetec, Toyota 4AGE and Renault 5 GT Turbo were also used.\n\nThe Mojo used a de dion rear suspension setup combined with another variation on the Sylva inboard front suspension design.\n\n- Mojo 2\n\nThe Mojo 2 is a redesigned Mojo with independent double wishbone rear suspension. The body was redesigned at the rear, and 2 new nose designs introduced.\n\n- Mojo SE\n\nA further development of the Mojo 2, which took the rear chassis design of the Riot SE to give a slightly longer wheelbase to accommodate a wider variety of engines. The rear bodywork was redesigned to accommodate the extra length behind the rear bulkhead.\n\n- Riot\n\nThe Riot is a motor cycle engined version of the Mojo 2. The original version used a Yamaha R1 engine and was called the R1ot. Later it was redesigned to take a Ford Zetec SE and was called Riot SE. It went on to become \"Kit Car of the Year 2005\".[1]\n\n- J15\n\nSylva striker\n\nThe Sylva Striker is the most enduring of the Sylva models and was a radical evolution of the Star and Leader, dropping the Viva donor car in favour of purpose-built suspension and lighter bodywork. The car was aimed at two markets, the home car builder that required an economical kit that could be built using readily available mechanics tools and the more demanding race car builder who favoured good handling and simple design.\n\nThe Striker has proved popular and successful on UK race tracks, most notably in the kit-car race series run by the 750 Motor Club.\n\nThe Striker was available in kit form, and could be built with a variety of engines, for example a Ford Crossflow, Ford Zetec, Toyota Twin-cam or even a motorcycle engine. These cars have high power-to-weight ratios and are best enjoyed in the summer due to minimal weather protection. In the UK all kit-cars are now put though the SVA (Single Vehicle Approval) to obtain a road vehicle licence. The Mk 4 version of this car, known as the Phoenix, was also manufactured in New Zealand from 1989.\n\nThe front suspension initially had outboard springs and shock absorbers, but with later versions, this was moved inboard with a rocker arm upper suspension arm. There were two types of rear suspension offered: one with a live axle, located by trailing arms, leading arms and a panhard rod. The other had independent rear suspension.\n\nIn 2002, Raw Engineering acquired the rights to the Striker and have made a number of modifications and variations since.\n\nProduce :\n\n- STAR 1982-85 : 70 ex sold to Swindon Sportscars\n\n- LEADER 1983-85 : 150 ex sold to Swindon Sportscars\n\n- STRIKER\n\nmk1 1985-86 : 1 ex unique à motorisation mazda RX3\n\nmk2 1986-88 : 600 ex sold to RAW en 2002\n\nmk3 1988-90 : 60 ex\n\nmk4 1988-99 : 60 ex modèle appelé \"Phoenix\"\n\n- FURY : 1991-94 150 ex sold to Fisher en 1994\n\n- STYLUS 1994-96 : 20 ex sold to SSC en 1996\n\n- JESTER 1996-98 : 100 ex sold to Harlequin en 1998\n\n- PHOENIX\n\nmk2 1999-01 : 10 ex sold to STM en 2001\n\n- MOJO 1998-02 : 50 ex remplacé par la MOJO mk2 en 2002\n\nReplicas and cars based on or related to Lotus Seven\n\n- Lotus Cars\n\noriginals and related cars: Six (1952–1957) · Seven (1957–1972) · Mk8 (1956–1958) · Mk9 (1956–1958) · Eleven (1956–1958)\n\n- Caterham Cars\n\nCurrent models : Classic - Roadsport · Academy · CSR200 · CSR260· CSR Superlight · Superlight · R300 · R400 · R500 · Roadsport\n\nHistoric models : Caterham 21 (1994–2000) · JPE (1992–1996) · Super Blackbird (2001–2003)\n\n- Westfield Sportscars\n\nCurrent models : Megabusa & Megablade · Sport · Sport Turbo · AeroRace\n\nHistoric models : SE · FW400 (1999–2002) · AeroSport (2007–2009) · SEight (1991–2010) · XI (1982–1986, 2004–2010)\n\n- Others"
