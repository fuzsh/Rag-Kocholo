        "text": "ESTfield is a Lotus Seven-style car manufactured by RaceTech in Tartu, Estonia either as a kit car or in key ready form. The design is basically a Locost that has been adapted to take Lada parts instead of the Ford Escort of the original Locost. However Racetech has developed many versions of the chassis to take engines, gearboxes and rear axis' from many manufacturers such as Volvo and BMW as well as an especially strong version designed to take a V8.\n\n[edit]\n\nhttp://www.racetech.ee"
