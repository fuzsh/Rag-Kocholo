The first car in Istanbul was during the ruling period of Sultan Abdul Hamid (1876-1909) and seen at Beyoglu-Istiklal Avenue, just on display in a shop for months and it was the target of the gaze of curious people of Istanbul.\n\nHowever, in the Ottoman archives, some letters and documents found recently, show that the first \"electrical\" car, manufactured by an English, Robert Davidson, was ordered by Sultan Abdul Hamid, in 1888 and the car imported from England. Due to bomb placed under the car of Sultan Abdul Hamid, it was not allowed to import any kind of motor vehicule until the end of his reign (1909).\n\nThe first gasoline-powered car in Istanbul, was at the time of Galata quay opening in 1895, and imported by Ahmed Pasha, a member of the State Council, where the first public debut of the Renault-Landaulet brand car, with its opening and closing the rear blower, was in the district of Fenerbahçe at Kalamis-Istanbul.
