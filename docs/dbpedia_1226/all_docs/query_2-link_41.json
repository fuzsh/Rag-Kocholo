We are distributing this PDF free of charge to give you a chance to discover the worlds largest car catalogue. If you like it, you might want to head over to our website www.theworldofcars.com and see what else we have to offer. The next edition of World of Cars will hit the newsstands at the end of November and if you can’t find it at your local store, you can order it through our homepage. We hope you will enjoy our catalogue as much as we’ve enjoyed creating it. The World of Cars team Q www.theworldofcars.com .a* Wactaw Pozar Eligiusz Mazur Dear Readers, This catalogue, whose first English edition you are about to discover, has actually quite a long history. Its beginning goes back to the year 1991 when we published, for the first time in Poland, a worldwide car directory called „Samochody Swiata”. Its first two editions were based on foreign licenses, and since 1993 it has been prepared and published by our own staff. It took us five more years to discover, to our astonishment and with some pride I might add, that our publication has surpassed all other car catalogues in the world, both in regards to the number of car manufacturers and their products listed. Consequently, it became very popular in Poland, where approx. 2 million copies has so far been sold, and is now a must-buy for every professional as well as automotive hothead interested in this industry. We are therefore doing our very best to deliver the highest quality with numerous checks, updates, verifications and additions to enrich the content and include all the newest information available. Members of our staff travel extensively and are present at most, if not all, motor shows in the world, gathering the most recent and important automotive news. We are corresponding with hundreds of big and small car manufacturers, various automotive associations and organizations around the world, all this enormous effort serving one purpose - to make our information as trustworthy as humanly possible. The statistics of the worldwide production is especially difficult to gather and systemize, as various countries, companies and organizations use different assumptions to calculate their production numbers; we believe that our statistical data is the most comprehensive and closest to the actual situation, as compared to all other information readily available in the media. We do encounter some issues that enforce us to make difficult choices. The main one relates to the quality of photographic material; sometimes onlypoor quality photos are available, and a choice between the best graphic (visual) quality of our publication and the most credible information displayed, has to be made. We consciously choose the latter option and include most of the material we have. With a great deal of jitters, from Poland - the country that just recently joined the family of the European Union - where only a small number of models is made and the investments to this particular industry are so limited, we would like to take this opportunity and greet all of the motorization hotheads in Europe, for whom this publication is presented. For this purpose alone new colleagues, working on the English edition, has joined our team. We thank all, both our experienced staff and the new coworkers, for their enormous effort and time spent to prepare this interesting, comprehensive and, as we think, the largest publication of this kind in the world.

Myself being an automotive engineer and a car body designer, educated in Poland but experienced overseas, mainly in Australia and Indonesia, lam proud to be a member of this team, a group of Polish professionals and journalists of highest standards. Iam also very excited to be a part of this project. I believe that this catalogue, besides being an excellent reading, is also a sign of the times we live in - the world gets smaller and people get closer to each other, regardless of their origin or place of living. The information is becoming readily available on a larger scale. The production gets distributed globally. As will this catalogue! We have prepared its first edition for Europe, and a task of transferring all this information gathered meticulously by my colleagues for a whole year, was quite a challenge! Especially in a view that for the last minute, andlmean minute(I), the newest information was delivered, the numbers were updated, the corrections were made. All this would not have been possible to achieve without enormous work and great help from the whole team. I would like to thank the authors and Polish version editor for their never-ending stream of data and persistence to include all the novelties, even after „the bell rang”. Thank you Wacek for managing this mission-impossible project (while ringing the bell all the time). I thank all the DTP operators who patiently improved the quality of the content, regardless of the fact that after a twenty-hour shift they could not see anything anymore. Being responsible for the English edition I must, and I do it with great pleasure, thank all the translators and proofreaders who actually made it all possible and, hopefully, readable and understandable, too. Thanks are also due to all people not directly involved in the making of this publication but who supported us, the Team, in our „insane” drive for excellence. And last but not least, I thank YOU for buying our catalogue, the decision you will be pleased to have made. Great reading! Robert Rogalewski, Executive Editor. Catalogue Road Map „ World of Cars\" consists of two main chapters: the catalogue and the tables listing technical/statistical data. The descriptive part is made in alphabetical order according to country international abbreviations. Each country is then divided into separate car manufacturers, beginning with the largest and best known. If this looks a bit confusing, a separate index of car makes in alphabetical order is also available. The second part includes technical information by make in alphabetical order as well as statistical data sorted by each country and production/assembly volume of the companies.
