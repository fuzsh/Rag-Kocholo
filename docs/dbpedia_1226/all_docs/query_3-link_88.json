Older Stalker used the 2.8 or 3.4 l 60Â° V6 engine out of a mid-1990s Chevrolet Camaro or Pontiac Firebird. Most Stalkers now use the GM 3800 series II or III V6, in both naturally aspirated and supercharged forms. The supercharged version is known as a Super Stalker.\n\nStalkers trophied at the SCCA SOLO NATIONALS 2007 (Scott Minehart), N.A.S.A. Time Trial Nationals at Mid Ohio (Dennis Brunton), Run and Gun Pro Class Top Dog 2007 (Dennis Brunton), and Street Tire Top Dog (Justin Sims) at Gateway International Raceway. A Stalker (as of April 2008) holds the Time Trial Unlimited Track Record at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida, with a time of 1:32.8 seconds (Dennis Brunton).\n\nIn July 2010, after a change in company ownership from Dennis Brunton to Scott Minehart, Brunton Auto began to redesign the Stalker and in 2012, introduced the new version called the Stalker M-Spec. Redesigned elements included the following: the Chevrolet S-10 components were eliminated, in favor of double wishbone suspension, which makes the M-spec one of the few Lotus Seven kit car replicas with independent suspension in both front & rear. Single adjustable shocks are mounted inboard and connect to the suspension arms using pushrods and rockers, similar to a Formula 1 car's suspension design. The M-Spec model and its variants were designed to easily accommodate specific GM V6 & V8 engines, and even allows both Manual & Automatic transmission options. M-Spec models are also offered in different sizes and body styles: The original M-Spec body differs from the traditional Lotus Seven shape with its hood scoop, integrated LED headlight housings, and one piece rear bodywork where the fenders are integrated with the rest of the rear bodywork. The Classic R model uses the M-Spec chassis but retains a more traditional Lotus Seven appearance to the body. The XL model of the M-Spec chassis is longer & wider than the original M-Spec, which allows for more room in both the engine bay and passenger compartment. The AXR model, introduced in late 2014, is a purpose built autocross track car and is smaller than the original M-Spec.\n\nBrunton Auto is currently located in St. Petersburg, Florida, and has produced approximately 200 kits thus far.\n\nTo assist buyers of their kit, Brunton Auto has created & maintains many different online build videos, pictures, and written guides, as well as an email group to connect the Stalker community together. Brunton Auto must grant access to either of these resources.\n\nDefault And Bankruptcy[edit]\n\nIn August 2019 Brunton Auto was sued for defaulting on over $130,000 in loans with final judgement and a lien entered in January 2020.[2] In connection, the owner Scott Minehart filed chapter 7 Bankruptcy in October 2019.[3]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n[edit]\n\nManufacturers web site"
