Australian cars used to be all the rage back in the day, but sadly this reign ended shortly after because of some less-than-ideal updates that killed the mood for a lot of car producers out there.\n\nThe Australian car manufacturing industry used to be the 10th most productive on the planet, it even surpassed most of the current day titans back in the 70s. 2007 was their last peak year and soon after they started shutting down a lot of their factories and car brand names including Holden amongst many others.\n\nThe weird thing is though that even with this rapid decline in terms of quantity, we have seen a resurgence in terms of the classic Aussie cars which has definitely helped brighten up the future for them.\n\nAfter the year 2017 rolled around it pretty much became obvious that we have not seen the last of the Aussie car industry, although the odds of returning back to their past fame and glory may never happen again.\n\nList of Australian car brands:\n\nAlpha Sports\n\nAmuza\n\nAustralian Six\n\nAustralian Motor Industries\n\nBirchfield Motor Company\n\nBirrana\n\nBolwell\n\nBuckle Motors\n\nBulant\n\nBullet\n\nDaytona Motors\n\nCheetah Racing\n\nDevaux Pty Ltd\n\nDRB\n\nElfin\n\nGiocattolo Motori\n\nHammer\n\nHighland\n\nHolden\n\nHSV\n\nIlinga\n\nJOSS\n\nKaditcha\n\nLucalia Clubman\n\nMinetti\n\nN H Buchanan Motor Co\n\nNota Sports and Racing\n\nOKA Australia\n\nPender-Hertel\n\nPRB\n\nPurvis Eureka\n\nPython\n\nShrike\n\nThe Roo Motor\n\nRootes Australia\n\nSouthern Cross\n\nTarrant Automobile\n\nTrackson\n\nTrevethan\n\nZeta\n\nFor more information on Aussie cars, check out our page about Australian car companies.\n\nAustria\n\nAustria is one of those countries that appears to be getting better and better when it comes to every market that they wish to enter or cater to. For example, the automotive industry has been thriving for them for a very long time now thanks to their innovative approach to it.\n\nMost countries have tried to follow through with the current demands on the market, trying to offer the best products that the community would enjoy purchasing, but that’s not what Austria has been doing. Instead, Austria have decided to take what is popular and completely discard it for what they figured would be more popular down the line.\n\nThis was a very dangerous move that could have resulted in a complete flop, but luckily thanks to their ingeniousness, Austria has now become one of the best in terms of its production line, becoming the world’s best sellers in terms of its lightweight and efficient high-performance batteries.\n\nList of Austrian car brands:\n\nCustoca\n\nDenzel\n\nEurostar Automobilwerk GesmbH & Co.

Russian car brands used to be very popular here, for good reason, and now European car makes have started to gain more ground.\n\nBelkommunmash\n\nMZKT / Volat\n\nLida Buses Neman\n\nBelgium\n\nBelgium has always tried its hardest to get to the very top of the leaderboard of the automotive industry and for the most part they’ve done a great job so far. They have gone as far as to base their whole country’s economy on the automotive business, literally spreading assembly plants all across the country.\n\nWith car brand names such as Ford Genk, Van Hool, Ghent Volvo Europe and Audi Forest/Brussels backing them up, let’s just say that they’ve had a pretty good time so far on the open market. In fact, before the First World War Belgium was actually considered to be one of the titans of the industry.\n\nWhile the market may have changed over the past couple of years, what hasn’t changed is their disposition towards bringing us some of the best cars in the world.\n\nSure, they’re no longer the leaders in terms of sales or quality, but that doesn’t mean that they’re not well worth the investment in the first place. They still have a ton of car parts manufacturers and they will continue to be a part of the major bracket for a very long time onwards.\n\nList of car brands from Belgium:\n\nApal\n\nADK\n\nAlatac\n\nALP\n\nAntoine\n\nAstra\n\nAlteliers Germain\n\nBelga Rise\n\nCompagnie Nationale Excelsior\n\nDe Wandre\n\nDelecroix\n\nEdran\n\nExelsior\n\nNagant & Cie, Liège\n\nFabrique Nationale\n\nImperia Automobiles\n\nGillet\n\nJeecy-Vea\n\nJuwel\n\nMeeussen\n\nMétallurgique\n\nMinerva\n\nPieper\n\nPipe\n\nSpringuel\n\nVan Hool NV\n\nVivinus\n\nFor a closer look at some of the native Belgian car brands you can check out this article.\n\nBrazil\n\nHave you ever heard the name Henry Ford before? Well, believe it or not, the renowned American industrialist was also responsible for starting Brazil’s automotive industry. Between 1919 and 1921 Ford Motor Company decided to start up their own production facility in Brazil, which soon led to the assembly of other car names here as well.\n\nSkip forward to 1956 in Sao Paulo, when Romi-Isetta, one of the first true Brazilian cars was produced. This was a monumental moment in Ford’s history, and this would soon attract other car brands to the country, leading to the creation of the first Volkswagen factory later on down the line around 1959.\n\nNowadays, the most successful Brazilian auto company is Troller, and that’s all thanks to their T4 and Pantanal models. They are currently being sold off everywhere around the globe and their popularity is certainly on the rise.\n\nList of Brazilian car brands:\n\nAgrale\n\nBernardini\n\nBrasinca\n\nDacon\n\nDKW-Vemag\n\nEmme\n\nEngesa\n\nFábrica Nacional de Motores\n\nGurgel Motores\n\nHofstetter Turbo\n\nJPX do Brasil Ltda.\n\nLobini\n\nObvio\n\nPag\n\nPuma\n\nSanta Matilde\n\nSimca do Brasil\n\nSta Milde\n\nTecnologia Automotiva Catarinense\n\nTroller\n\nBulgaria\n\nIn Eastern Europe Moskvitch used to be a pretty popular car name back in the day, but we haven’t heard much about them or any other car brands from Bulgaria in these last couple of years. The country seems to focus more on the car parts industry right now.\n\nBulgaralpine\n\nLitex Motors\n\nMoskvitch\n\nPirin-Fiat\n\nSofia\n\nCambodia\n\nFrom Cambodia there’s only one car brand to mention:\n\nHeng\n\nCanada\n\nWhen it comes to Canadian car companies, for the most part, they never actually tried their hardest to become the automakers themselves, instead opting to work for foreign car brands for the sake of convenience and less stress.\n\nEven so, they are currently the 13th auto-producing countries in the world, and that’s not all. They’re also the 7th largest auto exporter when it comes to the general value of their automotive market, and that all stems from the fact that they produced over 1.4 million cars in total and exported $32 billion worth of vehicles as of 2020.\n\nAlthough they still prefer to keep their work offshore for the most part, they have definitely also done a decent job at carving a nice spot for themselves out there. So regardless of whether we’re talking about their uprise back in 1918 or their current avenues, Canada is still a force to be reckoned with in the auto industry.\n\nTheir main manufacturers stem from Japan and America, and as far as Canadian car brands go, while definitely not their main source of income, they still do exist and thrive as far as we can tell.\n\nList of Canadian car brands:\n\n67X\n\n1893 Shamrock\n\n1867 Henry Seth Taylor Steam Buggy\n\nAcadian\n\nAmherst\n\nAsuna\n\nBourassa\n\nBricklin SV-1\n\nBrock Motors\n\nBrooks Steam Motors\n\nCanadian Motor\n\nCambli International Thunder 1\n\nCampagna Corporation\n\nClinton\n\nColonial Motors Ltd\n\nDerby\n\nDominion\n\nDuplex\n\nDynasty Electric\n\nEnterra Vipre\n\nFleetwood-Knight\n\nGareau\n\nGaselle\n\nGray-Dort Motors\n\nHTT Pléthore\n\nThe Knight XV\n\nLeRoy\n\nLondon Motors\n\nManic GT\n\nMcLaughlin Carriage Company\n\nMoose Jaw Standard\n\nPlymouth\n\nQueen\n\nRussell Motor\n\nStudebaker of Canada Ltd\n\nTimmis Motor Company\n\nWinnipeg\n\nIf you want detailed information, check the page dedicated for Canadian automakers.\n\nChina\n\nChina always made it their goal to become the very best regardless at what industry they’re aiming for. For the most part, they are amongst the top distributers all around the globe for the automotive market, and their production capabilities and revenues continue to rise with every single year.\n\nAs of 2009, they have managed to overtake the European Union, the United States and Japan’s annual production of automobiles by a longshot, becoming the absolute largest producer and distributor in the world.\n\nSure, most of the cars that they have made from scratch only sell in China, but as of 2019 they did export around 295,000 commercial vehicles and 725,000 passenger cars abroad so there’s always the possibility that this will change in the near future.\n\nAs far as automakers go, they have the Changan Automobile Group, the FAW group, Dongfeng Motor and of course, SAIC Motor. Together they are known as the Big Four car companies that rule over the Chinese automobile industry.\n\nList of Car Brands in China:\n\nArcfox\n\nBeiqi\n\nBAW\n\nBrilliance Auto Group\n\nBYD\n\nByton\n\nChang’an Automobile Group\n\nChanghe\n\nHafei\n\nChery Automobile Co\n\nDadi Auto\n\nDongfeng Motor Corporation\n\nEverus (Li Nian)\n\nFAW Group Corporation\n\nHAIMA\n\nFAW Tianjin\n\nFoton Motor\n\nHuali\n\nHongqi\n\nGeely\n\nGonow\n\nGreat Wall Motors Company Limited\n\nGAIG\n\nGAC Group\n\nGAC Changfeng Motor\n\nGeometry\n\nHawtai\n\nZX Auto\n\nHuayang\n\nJAC Motors\n\nJiangling Motors Corporation\n\nLi Auto\n\nLifan\n\nNIO\n\nQoros Auto Co\n\nRoewe\n\nShaanxi Automobile Group\n\nShanghai Maple Guorun Automobile Co\n\nSAIC Motor Corporation\n\nSichuan Tengzhong\n\nSingulato\n\nShuanghuan Auto\n\nSG Automotive Group\n\nSoueast\n\nWeltmeister\n\nXinkai\n\nXPENG\n\nYoungman\n\nYue Lo0ng\n\nYutong\n\nPolarsun Automobile\n\nZhonghua\n\nZinoro\n\nZotye Auto\n\nFor detailed information, click here to see the page about Chinese auto manufacturers\n\nCroatia\n\nFrom Croatia there’s only one car brand to mention, but Rimac was responsible for creating some of the world’s fastest and most exciting hypecars out there. They took the world by storm with their electric powertrain solutions and other renowned car makes like Porsche, Hyundai, Renault, Jaguar or Aston Martin started working with them for creating the next best cars.\n\nRimac Automobili\n\nCzech Republic\n\nSure, the Czech Republic isn’t exactly the largest country in the world, quite the opposite actually, but that doesn’t mean that they haven’t had quite the influence over the worldwide automotive industry.\n\nIn fact, we would argue that thanks to their incredibly proficient geographical location, their top-of-the-line infrastructure and tireless labor they have managed to change the world as we know it in a lot more ways than you’d think.\n\nThey currently have a total of three major automakers producing their vehicles here, and they are the following: Skoda Motors, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Czech and of course, Toyota Peugeot Citroen Automobile. Out of all of these however the most important one historically is Skoda Auto as this was actually one of the oldest car brands in the world.\n\nOverall, the Czech Republic or Czechia has more than earned its spot at the top of the food chain, literally becoming a jack of all trades in terms of the car industry. Their car industry has also been a huge part of their influence overseas, as without it we would definitely see and hear a lot less from them nowadays.\n\nList of Czech car brands:\n\nAero\n\nAspa\n\nAvia\n\nJAWA\n\nKaipan\n\nKarosa\n\nLIAZ\n\nMTX aka Metalex\n\nPraga\n\nŠkoda Auto\n\nTatra\n\nZbrojovka Brno\n\nFor more information on the Czech automotive industry, check out this article on Czech car brands.\n\nDenmark\n\nMost people out there could be excused for making the mistake of believing that Denmark doesn’t have any cars made by a native producer when in fact there are quite a lot of Danish car brands to choose from here.\n\nAlthough there are no car assembly plants in the country that are worth mentioning, they have one of the most proficient hypercar manufacturers of all time stirring the crowds from within and that is none other than Zenvo Automotive themselves.\n\nOn top of that they also have Hydrema, yet another incredible automotive brand that continues to rise up in the ranks as we speak. Sure, it mainly focuses on dumb trucks, truck cranes and all sorts of stuff from that niche, but that doesn’t mean that they’re any less worth mentioning.\n\nSo, while they may not be at the top of the food chain in terms of the automobile market, let’s just say that they’re not exactly doing all that badly either. They’re on the uprise, and while they do work their magic on specialized machines for the most part, they’ve done an excellent job at it so far without a doubt.\n\nList of all Danish car brands:\n\nAnglo-Dane\n\nBrems\n\nBukh & Gry\n\nCityEl\n\nDanish Automobile Building\n\nDansk\n\nHydrema\n\nZenvo Automotive\n\nFor a closer look at the Danish automotive history, check out this article on Danish cars.\n\nEgypt\n\nThe automotive industry in Egypt is also pretty big, but their mostly focused on car parts and accessories and don’t have too many local car brands to mention:\n\nArab American Vehicles\n\nBavarian Auto Group\n\nEGA\n\nEgy-Tech Engineering\n\nGhabbour Group\n\nMCV\n\nNasr\n\nSeoudi Group\n\nSperanza Motors, Ltd\n\nEthiopia\n\nEthiopia only had three local car brands:\n\nHolland Car PLC\n\nAMCE\n\nLifan Ethiopia\n\nFinland\n\nCompared to other Nordic countries that have a pretty big automotive industry and several well known car brands, the Fins aren’t doing that great. They had a few local car brands, but their automotive business is mostly focused on working for foreign car companies, especially for supplies and accessories.\n\nList of Finnish car brands:\n\nSisu Auto\n\nElcat Automotive\n\nFinlandia\n\nKorvensuu\n\nValmet Automotive\n\nWiima\n\nFrance\n\nIf you currently live in the US then chances are that you didn’t know that there was even a huge market for French cars. This is because for the most part, they have actually marketed their vehicles towards the European market. Has this been a good choice for them? Absolutely.\n\nIn fact, the French car industry is so prominent in the European market that they currently provide over 25% of the vehicles that are driven on a day-to-day basis in Europe. Amongst their top car brands, we have incredible names such as Peugeot, Citroen and of course, Renault.\n\nBut the list doesn’t stop there as they also have a ton of other names including Venturi, Monaco and we can’t possibly forget about Bugatti. Each of these are popular for being incredible luxury cars and on top of that they also have Alpine to cover the race and sports car niche.\n\nOverall, the French have pretty much given the car industry all that they had to offer, to the point where they’re considered to be amongst the top 3 most successful in the world.\n\nList of all French car brands:\n\nAixam-Mega\n\nAlma\n\nAlpine\n\nAmilcar\n\nArista\n\nArola SARL\n\nAutobleu\n\nAutovia\n\nAuverland\n\nBallot\n\nBollée\n\nBolloré\n\nBucciali\n\nBugatti\n\nCG\n\nChenard-Walcker\n\nCitroën\n\nClaveau\n\nCottin-Desgouttes\n\nDarracq\n\nDarracq Lago\n\nDB\n\nDe Dietrich\n\nDe Dion Bouton\n\nDelage\n\nDelahaye\n\nDeLaChapelle\n\nExagon Engineering\n\nFacel Vega\n\nGregoire\n\nHeuliez\n\nHotchkiss\n\nHurtu\n\nIsatis\n\nLa Buire\n\nLéon Bollée\n\nLe Zebre\n\nLicorne\n\nLigier\n\nLombard\n\nLorraine\n\nLorraine Dietrich\n\nMatra\n\nMatra Bonnet\n\nMatra-Simca\n\nMatra-Talbot\n\nMécanique Aviation Traction\n\nMega\n\nMonica\n\nMDI\n\nMVS\n\nMicrocar\n\nPanhard\n\nPeugeot\n\nPGO Automobiles\n\nRenault\n\nRochet-Schneider\n\nSalmson\n\nSimca\n\nSimca Vedette\n\nSovam\n\nTalbot\n\nTh.

Without him, the world as we know it might have been a lot different to say the least. They were the first producers of the heat engine and this is where the prototype for the modern machine first appeared.\n\nNot only that, but they quickly took advantage of this by becoming one of the top car producers in the world, even though they’re now ranking fourth globally, lagging behind the United States, Japan and China by only a speck.\n\nThere are SO many German car brands out there that it’s pretty much impossible to only mention one or two. You have the greats: Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Volkswagen or Opel, but that’s just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThey produce as many as 6 million vehicles every year, and on top of that they own a total of 35.6% of the automotive industry in the European Union with around 800,000 workers giving it their all every minute of the clock.\n\nList of all German car brands:\n\nAdler\n\nAmphicar\n\nArtega\n\nAudi\n\nAuto-Union\n\nApal\n\nArtega Automobil GmbH\n\nAWZ-Zwickau\n\nBUS\n\nB+B\n\nBitter\n\nBMW\n\nBorgward\n\nBrennabor-Werke\n\nBrütsch\n\nChampion\n\nDaimler\n\nDauer\n\nDürkopp\n\nDixi\n\nDKW\n\nEspenlaub\n\nFafnir\n\nFuldamobil\n\nGlas\n\nGoggomobil\n\nGoliath\n\nGumpert\n\nGutbrod\n\nHanomag\n\nHeinkel\n\nHorch\n\nIrmscher\n\nIsdera\n\nKarmann\n\nKleinschnittger\n\nKoenig\n\nLloyd\n\nLotec\n\nLutzmann\n\nMagna Steyr\n\nMaico\n\nMaybach\n\nMCC\n\nMelkus\n\nMercedes-Benz\n\nMesserschmitt\n\nMarkranstädter Automobilfabrik\n\nNAG\n\nNSU\n\nOpel\n\nPinguin\n\nPorsche\n\nRuf Automobile GmbH\n\nRumpler\n\nSmart\n\nStoewer\n\nTrabant\n\nTreser\n\nVauxhall\n\nVictoria\n\nVolkswagen\n\nWanderer\n\nWartburg\n\nWendax\n\nWiesmann\n\nYes!\n\nZender\n\nZundapp\n\nWant to learn more about German automakers? Here is an article dedicated only to German automobile production companies\n\nGhana\n\nFrom Ghana we only found one car brand to mention:\n\nKantanka\n\nGreece\n\nWhile Greece may be extremely famous all across the globe for its dream destinations and its incredible culture and history, when it comes to its car selection it does appear to be lacking to say the least.\n\nIn the past, there were quite a few Greek car brands, with the oldest of them actually dating back to the 1920s when a man by the name of Nikos Theologou ended up founding his own business constructing and even designing buses, trucks and everyday cars.\n\nThe problem here lies with the fact that although he did find moderate success in his country, there was no real market that would accept him and his ideas overseas, which is why his brand of cars didn’t really last all that long after his passing.\n\nThere were some other names that tried to make it big in the country, including Namco, Mevea, Biamax, Addica, Scavas and others, but as you can tell, none actually managed to stick well enough to actually represent their country.\n\nList of all Greek car brands:\n\nAlta\n\nAttica\n\nAutokinitoviomihania Ellados\n\nAutomeccanica\n\nBiotechnia Ellinikon Trikyklon\n\nAR aka ARCO\n\nDIM Motor Company\n\nDinap\n\nEmporiki Autokiniton\n\nELVO\n\nMAVA\n\nNAMCO\n\nNeorion\n\nPan-Car\n\nScavas\n\nTheologou\n\nHungary\n\nAnother country from Europe that’s mostly focused on the car parts-making industry, Hungary is doing pretty well in this field, but they don’t have too many local car brands to mention:\n\nBalaton\n\nCsonka\n\nFejes\n\nPuli\n\nIndia\n\nAlthough many have yet to notice this, India has actually managed to become one of the world’s fastest growing car industries and this has been happening right under our noses the whole time. They actually managed to surpass South Korea and take its place in terms of the production and selling of commercial and passenger cars.\n\nOn top of that, the Indian auto industry has already become one of the country’s top sources of income, literally reaching a total of 7.1 percent of its gross income practically overnight. Let’s not forget the fact that India also has some of the top car manufacturers in the world in it, and on too of that they did manage to tackle both the two wheeled and the four wheeled industries at once.\n\nYou also have Indian car brands such as Hindustan Motors, Force, Tata and Mahindra all fighting amongst each other to become the leaders in the country, and while they do so they are also actively improving the country’s value on the market and of course, its popularity as well.\n\nList of all car brands in India:\n\nChinkara Motors\n\nForce Motors\n\nIPML\n\nHindustan Motors\n\nMahindra & Mahindra\n\nMahindra Reva Electric Vehicles\n\nMaruti Suzuki India\n\nOpel India\n\nPremier Ltd\n\nSan Storm\n\nSML Isuzu\n\nStandard\n\nTara International\n\nTata Motor\n\nWant to learn more about Indian auto industry?

But there aren’t too many Irish car brands to mention:\n\nAlesbury\n\nHeinkel Kabine\n\nShamrock\n\nTMC Costin\n\nIsrael\n\nThere are numerous companies in Israel focused on producing OEM and aftermarket parts using various high-end solutions to manufacture some of the best car components and accessories, but they haven’t had any active local car brands for years. Only Automotive Industries Ltd. seems to keep going, a company that’s actually the major supplier for the Israeli Security Forces.\n\nAutocars Co. Ltd.\n\nAutomotive Industries Ltd.\n\nAIL\n\nQoros Auto Co\n\nItaly\n\nBack in the 1880s, Enrico Zeno Bernardi made history when he invented the internal combustion engine. He did it at the exact same time as Karl Benz did, but the difference between the two is that Enrico actually used this engine on his own son’s tricycle and his daughter’s sewing machine, so Karl Benz got more credit for it.\n\nSoon after however, he realized the potential of the engine which led to the creation of motor vehicles. This led to the creation of FIAT and Itala later down the line. But that’s not the end of the story, in fact, it’s just the beginning, because SO many brands of cars were launched ever since. Now the country’s GDP based around the automotive industry is of around 8.5%, which just comes to show you how much of a difference a single man can do to a country’s future.\n\nOf course, the current day market is controlled by the FIAT Group because they own some of the most famous brands in the world, including Maserati, Lancia and Alfa Romeo. They have won multiple World Car of the Year awards thanks to these brands and they even managed to qualify for the European Car of the Year title almost every year since.\n\nDid we say anything about Ferrari, Lamborghini or Pagani? Those are some of the world’s most popular sports car brands.\n\nList of all Italian car brands:\n\nAbarth\n\nAnsaldo\n\nAlfa Romeo Automobiles\n\nASA\n\nATS\n\nAutobianchi\n\nB Engineering\n\nBandini Automobili\n\nBertone\n\nBizzarrini\n\nCasalini\n\nCastagna\n\nCentenari\n\nChiribiri\n\nCisitalia\n\nCizeta\n\nCovini Engineering\n\nDe Tomaso\n\nDR Motor Company\n\nFaralli and Mazzanti\n\nFerrari\n\nFiat\n\nFioravanti\n\nFornasari\n\nGhia\n\nGiottiline\n\nInnocenti\n\nIntermeccanica\n\nIso\n\nIsotta-Fraschini\n\nItala\n\nItaldesign\n\nIntermeccanica\n\nLamborghini\n\nLancia\n\nLMX\n\nMaserati\n\nMomo\n\nMoretti\n\nNardi\n\nNazzaro\n\nOM\n\nOsca\n\nOSI\n\nPagani\n\nPicchio\n\nPininfarina\n\nSiata\n\nSPA\n\nSpadaconcept\n\nTemperino\n\nVignale\n\nZagato\n\nZust\n\nHere is a list of all automakers from Italy. If you want to learn more, click here to see all Italian auto manufacturers\n\nJamaica\n\nFrom Jamaica we only found one local car company:\n\nExcel Motors Limited\n\nJapan\n\nThe Japanese have always been good at everything technology based. Regardless of whether you agree with their impressive work ethic or not, you do have to give props to them because when it comes to their car industry, they’re literally one step above the rest and that’s a fact.\n\nThey have some of the top car names in the industry today, including Toyota, Mazda and Honda which have pretty much overtaken most of their competitors by now. And if you are on the market for something more luxurious, they’ve got your back too. You have names such as Lexus and Infiniti for that and by God, they deserve every bit of the praise they receive.\n\nMost of their automotive industry lies upon the foundation they have built for them all across the main cities of Ota, Yokosuka, Taeta, Shizuka, Hiroshima and Yokohama. With names such as Nissan, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Honda, Suzuki and Toyota behind their success, who can really say that they didn’t expect them to be at the top of the leaderboard by now?\n\nList of all car brands from Japan:\n\nAles\n\nAsahi\n\nASL\n\nCentral Motor Co., Ltd\n\nDaihatsu\n\nDatsun\n\nDome\n\nDuesen Bayern\n\nHino\n\nHonda Motor Company\n\nAcura\n\nHonda\n\nHope Motor Company\n\nIsuzu\n\nIHI Corporation\n\nJiotto\n\nLexus\n\nMazda\n\nMitsubishi\n\nMitsuoka Motors\n\nNissan Motor Company\n\nInfiniti\n\nNissan\n\nOhta Jidosha\n\nOtomo\n\nPrince Motor Company\n\nScion\n\nSubaru\n\nSuminoe\n\nSuzuki Motor Corporation\n\nTommykaira\n\nToyota Motor Corporation\n\nLexus\n\nScion\n\nToyota\n\nTsukuba\n\nVemac\n\nYamaha\n\nFor detailed information, click here to see our detailed article about Japanese car brands.\n\nKenya\n\nAnother African company with a small but decent presence in the automotive world, Kenya has two local car brands to mention:\n\nMobius Motors\n\nNyayo\n\nKorea\n\nWe’ll mostly talk about South Korea here, because we don’t know too many things about the North Korean market. South Korea is famous for a lot of things to say the least, but when it comes to its automotive industry let’s just say that they’re pretty much amongst the leaders of the current worldwide market.\n\nThey are by car one of the most popular car producing countries in the Asian region, with over 4.5 million vehicles having been produced in the country alone this year. Out of these, 2 million have been exported abroad which means that they produced around 5 percent of the world’s purchases.\n\nAlthough their industry got a big boost only back in the 1960s, they instantly adopted the first five-year plan which made them successful from the get go. Every year since they’ve improved upon their craft, literally becoming one of the leaders of the industry for sure.\n\nThey have a ton of different world-class manufacturers under their belt too, with Renault Samsung Motors, Kia Motors, Hyundai Motor and SsangYong Motor being at the top of the food chain as we speak. They are literally unstoppable on the open market, and on top of that they also continue to improve with every passing year which is no easy feat.\n\nNorth Korea\n\nPyeonghwa Motors\n\nSouth Korea\n\nCT&T United\n\nDaewoo Motors\n\nKia Motors\n\nHyundai\n\nProto Motors\n\nRenault Samsung Motors\n\nSsangYong Motor Company\n\nFor detailed information, click here to see the page about Korean automakers.\n\nLatvia\n\nLatvia might be a small country but their automotive industry is surprisingly big and varied. They don’t have too many local car brands though:\n\nDartz Motorz Company\n\nRiga Autobus Factory\n\nLebanon\n\nFrom Lebanon we only found information about W Motors. an Emirati-based supercar maker that was actually founded in this country back in 2002.\n\nW Motors\n\nLibya\n\nDictators have wacky ideas and the Libyan Rocket was the former leader’s intention to design and build a Libyan-made car. With a name like that, we’re surprised it didn’t lift off the ground.\n\nLibyan Rocket\n\nLiechtenstein\n\nFor a country as tiny as Liechtenstein we’re surprised they even have one local car brand, but some of the world’s richest people live there, so there’s no shortage of people with funds and ideas.\n\nOrca Engineering\n\nMalaysia\n\nThe automotive industry in Malaysia is actually the third largest in SE Asia and it ranks in the top 25 car producing countries worldwide. They’ve made more than 500,000 vehicles last year and even though they don’t have too many local brands of cars to mention, Proton and Perodua are pretty popular there.\n\nBufori\n\nNAM\n\nPerodua\n\nProton\n\nMexico\n\nThe Mexican car industry has shown everyone that you don’t need the largest budgets in the world to actually compete with some of the richest countries you could think of. They put a lot of heart and soul into their mechanical engineering industry and this clearly shows in the end product.\n\nInstead of just focusing on passenger vehicles though they have also put a lot of emphasis on their trucks and specialized vehicles, which led to Mexico becoming one of the best producers in those niches. On top of that, they also have incredibly prestigious brands to back them up too, including Mercedes Benz, BMW, General Motors, FORD, Honda, VW, Toyota and Chrysler amongst others.\n\nSo, just to reemphasize, you don’t need to have the budget that some of the other countries on this list have to actually make it big out there. All that you need is a few good car brands and the rest is history. Let’s not forget the fact that they also have Mastretta MXT under their belt, aka one of the top supercars in the world. With names such as these backing them up who could ever ask for more?\n\nInferno Automobili\n\nMastretta\n\nVAM\n\nZacua\n\nDINA\n\nSolana\n\nMASA\n\nS.R. Motors\n\nRon Automóviles\n\nFor a detailed look at Mexican car brands, check out this article.\n\nMonaco\n\nFrom Monaco we only have one car brand to mention:\n\nVenturi\n\nMorocco\n\nMorocco has recently became the biggest passenger car manufacturer in Africa, surpassing South Africa as the biggest exporter on the continent too. They only have one local car brand to mention though:\n\nSOMACA\n\nNetherlands\n\nWorld War II was devastating for most countries out there and that’s a fact. Regardless of whether they ended up on the winning side or not, every country had a lot of catching up to do in order to get back to the state they were in before.\n\nNetherlands managed to take up their spot at the top of the leaderboard of the automotive world as soon as the war ended by tackling a niche that was, for the lack of a better word, empty. DAF Trucks hit the scene, completely replacing the bankrupt DAF company. Soon after this led to the creation of its first small passenger car around the middle of the 20th century.\n\nNowadays that place was actually overtaken by a brand known as MINI, and although DAF is still around, they were reduced to only manufacturing simple trucks these days. Netherlands do have Spyker supercars to boast with too, although they only really became known after they made it big in the Formula One races.\n\nList of all car brands in the Netherlands:\n\nBurton\n\nDakar\n\nDAF\n\nDonkervoort Automobielen BV\n\nLandFighter\n\nRuska\n\nSpyker N.V.\n\nVDL Nedcar\n\nVandenbrink\n\nVencer\n\nWaaijenberg\n\nFor an in-depth look at all car brands from the Netherlands, please check out our article on Dutch cars.\n\nNew Zealand\n\nThe saddest part about New Zealand is the fact that although they used to have some of the most reputable car names in the game, they actually no longer have a vehicle assembly industry for passenger cars these days, instead opting to get their cars from abroad.\n\nThey also ended up completely shutting down their assembly plants for the sake of their local industry simply because they could not compete with any of the overseas titans.\n\nThis is a real shame considering just how prominent they were back in the 80s. They actually had an annual output of over 100,000 cars back then, but as soon as the Asian market import started growing more and more popular, they just couldn’t keep up anymore.\n\nThey still have a few small companies that manufacture original kit and replica cars by using their local-made car bodies to sell across the seas. Hopefully they can get back to their former glory though as we would love to see what these brilliant minds could do these days if only they put a little more emphasis on their passenger car production.\n\nList of all car brands in New Zealand:\n\nAlmac\n\nAlternative Cars Limited\n\nAnziel Nova\n\nBeattie\n\nChevron Engineering Specialties\n\nFraser Clubman\n\nHeron\n\nSaker\n\nTrekka\n\nNorway\n\nThink Global used to be a very promising electric car brand from Norway that might have been the next Tesla but unfortunately their story ended back in 2011. Today, the Norwegian auto industry is mostly focused on auto parts.\n\nList of car brands from Norway:\n\nBjering\n\nBuddy\n\nGeijer & Co\n\nFYK\n\nKewet\n\nNorsk Automobil & Vagnfabrik AS\n\nThink Global\n\nTroll\n\nPakistan\n\nWe didn’t find too many things about car makers from Pakistan but there are two companies to mention:\n\nAdam Motor Company, Ltd.\n\nHabib Motors\n\nPeru\n\nFrom Peru there’s only one local car company, a Peruvian automobile that was built back in 1908.\n\nGrieve\n\nPhillipines\n\nDespite the fact that motorcycles are the most common means of transportation in the Philippines, the country’s automotive industry is the 9th largest in the Asia-Pacific region. There’s only one local car brand to mention:\n\nChariot Motors\n\nPoland\n\nNot only is the automobile industry in Poland one of the best in the world, but it is also one of the main cogwheels that power up the country’s economy. More than 11 percent of the country’s industrial production is based around it, and it isn’t hard to see why this is.\n\nThey mostly focus on their light vehicles production, which is why they are the ones behind most of the passenger cars that are driven around in Central and Eastern Europe. They actually became the 23rd largest automakers in the world as of 2013 and they’ve been on the rise since.\n\nAmongst their top car names you have Fiat, Opel, Toyota, Man, Volvo and of course, Volkswagen. Besides these they also have Solaris, one of the top bus and truck producers in the world.\n\nIt was created and it is currently owned by Polish investors, meaning that as far as we know, Poland may very well be one of the top up and comers of the 21st century. Only time will tell though whether they’ll rise to the top or have their success run cut short.\n\nList of all car brands from Poland:\n\nArrinera\n\nBosmal\n\nFSO\n\nFSC Lublin\n\nNysa\n\nSyrena\n\nWarszawa\n\nŻuk\n\nPortugal\n\nThe automotive sector represents over 2% of Portugal’s economy with hundreds of companies that manufacture cars and components and over 150,000 direct jobs. There aren’t too many car brands that have been started in Portugal though, but we do have to mention:\n\nEdfor\n\nMarlei\n\nPORTARO\n\nUMM\n\nVinci\n\nRomania\n\nRomania is a perfect example of a country that has never given up on its market value, to the point where it almost seems like a joke to them. They started off during the communist regime quickly becoming one of the most advanced car industries in central Europe.\n\nAs soon as 1989 rolled around however, their auto industry pretty much fell apart in no time, mostly due to the many unsuccessful privatizations and the fact that although they had plenty of enterprises leading the market, most of them went bankrupt by the end of the century.\n\nSo, as soon as 1990 started they put their efforts all in the construction of passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles as a last-ditch effort to resuscitate their market value. This led to the creation of some of their best brands of all time, including Igero (now El Car), Roman Brasov, Ford Romania and of course, Automobile Dacia.\n\nThis story does have a happy ending however, since as of 2014 they have become the fifth country in Central Europe when it comes to their car assembly volume alone.\n\nARO\n\nDacia\n\nEl Car\n\nFord Romania\n\nRocar\n\nRoman\n\nRussia\n\nBelieve it or not, the automobile industry in Russia is actually thriving as we speak, being in the top 20 globally. Although this is quite a remarkable feat, what’s even more impressive about it is the fact that this itself doesn’t actually hold that much leverage over the country’s economy overall.\n\nInstead, what it does is it offers a ton of authentic models of cars and trucks which are meant to help the locals operate under their current conditions.\n\nAmongst their top car brands we have names such as IZH, Lada, Niva, VAZ and of course, GAZ. Currently, their top passenger car manufacturer in Eastern Europe is none other than AvtoVAZ, and as far as their freight transport production goes, we can’t possibly forget about KAMAZ.\n\nNeedless to say, although Russia has seen better days in terms of its overall economy, they have done a pretty good job at keeping themselves at the top of the leaderboard for quite a long time now, and even with their current predicaments they keep on pushing themselves to better and better results as we speak.\n\nList of all car brands in Russia:\n\nAton Impulse\n\nAvtoVAZ\n\nAZLK\n\nDerways\n\nDragon\n\nGAZor\n\nIZh\n\nLada\n\nMarussia Motors\n\nODA\n\nOka\n\nMoskvitch\n\nRusso-Balt\n\nSpetsteh\n\nTchaika\n\nTREKOL\n\nUAZ\n\nVolga\n\nYo-Mobil\n\nZiL\n\nZIS\n\nFor detailed information, click here to see the page about Russian automobile companies.\n\nSerbia\n\nFrom Serbia we have two local car brands to mention:\n\nIDA-Opel\n\nZastava Special Vehicles\n\nSlovakia\n\nCompared to its neighbor, the Czech Republic, Slovakia isn’t doing too great when it comes to building their own cars but they do have a thriving automotive industry mostly focused on car parts. There were only two automakers that were originally from Slovakia:\n\nAeromobil\n\nTAZ\n\nSouth Africa\n\nSouth Africa has actually been the leader in the African automotive industry for many years now as it currently produces well over 500,000 cars annually. They also rank up to the 21st position in the world thanks to how many cars they produce every year, and as far as the local car brand market goes, they’re on the 16th place.\n\nFor the most part though, they focus a lot of their resources on producing trucks and military vehicles, although they still have a lot of foreign brands running around in their country as well. As far as numbers go though, South Africa ranks third in the South African economic sector, which may not sound like much but it does quickly add up over time.\n\nThey have a ton of incredibly top-grade brands to brag with, including General Motors, Ford, FIAT, Dimian Chrysler, Volkswagen, Toyota and even BMW for that matter. Needless to say, while they are definitely not competing with the top dogs at the moment, we can definitely see a bright future ahead for South Africa as they’re quickly catching up to their competition as we speak.\n\nList of all South African car brands:\n\nAAD\n\nBirkin\n\nBasil Green Motors\n\nGSM\n\nLDS\n\nNetuar\n\nPerana Performance Group\n\nSri Lanka\n\nFor a small country like Sri Lanka they sure have found the right name for a car company started there:\n\nMicro Cars\n\nSudan\n\nThere aren’t too many African car brands to mention, but Sudan’s Giad Auto is doing pretty well, even though it’s mostly building cars for other companies like Hyundai, Renault or Lada.\n\nGiad Auto\n\nSpain\n\nInternational car brands are actively using Spain as a platform for the production of their machines. What you might not know about Spain though is that it is believed that the Italians laid the foundation for the car industry in this country back in 1919, when FIAT opened a branch near Barcelona.\n\nDespite this, Spain has enough of its own models of cars and trucks. Domestic companies such as Advanced Design Tramontana, Sociedad Española de Automoviles de Turismo (SEAT) and others are widely represented globally and compete well with foreign brands.\n\nSEAT is definitely not the only worthy Spanish car brand around and only a few really car-savvy people know that the history of automotive industry in the kingdom lasts more than a hundred years!\n\nList of all car brands in Spain:\n\nAbadal\n\nAspidis\n\nAuthi\n\nBenimar\n\nCupra\n\nIFR Aspid\n\nIrizar\n\nHispano-Suiza\n\nHurtan Desarrollos S.L.\n\nPegaso\n\nSantana Motor\n\nSpania GTA\n\nSEAT, S.A.\n\nTauro Sport Auto\n\nTramontana\n\nFor detailed information about Spanish automakers, check out our article on Spanish car brands.\n\nSweden\n\nYou may think that Sweden is mostly focused on its truck industry simply because they have at their disposal the two largest truck producers in the world, them being Volvo AB and Scania AB. Despite this however, they actually mostly focused on their passenger vehicles and this truly shows considering their recent developments.\n\nRegardless of whether you’re talking about their cars or their buses, they have always strived to bring us unsurpassed quality and incredibly high-grade safety to make sure that we have the time of our life while riding around in their own creations.\n\nBut although they do sell a lot of their cars and buses in their own country, they actually sell off as much as 95% of their heavy vehicles and almost 85% of their passenger cars around the globe. If you’ve ever heard of a brand named Koenigsegg then you already know why that is, since this is a luxury car brand that only the top one percent in the world could ever dream of owning.\n\nOther than that, however, they also have Volvo, NEVS, Polestar and Uniti Sweden AB. They used to have others in the mix too, but they were eventually consumed or overrun by these aforementioned brands.\n\nList of all Swedish car brands:\n\nAMG\n\nEsther\n\nJösse\n\nKoenigsegg\n\nSaab\n\nScania\n\nVolvo\n\nTo get more information on cars from Sweden, see this page about Swedish automakers.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSwitzerland is world famous for its watches, cheese, finance and of course, we can’t possibly forget about their Toblerone. But besides these avenues they also have carved themselves a special place in the car industry, even getting a special nickname for their endeavors.\n\nCommonly referred to as “Swiss Cars”, this umbrella term covers every single passenger car that they’ve released since the 1970s, as they all have one thing in common: They are incredibly sleek, fast and unique by all definitions of the word.\n\nMany would argue that the Swiss auto industry actually peaked in the 70s and that it never got back to full force since, but what many people don’t realize is the fact that they changed from being main producers to creating and distributing auto component parts and accessories instead.\n\nSo, while they may not be the juggernauts that they used to be in the past, they are still amongst the top names in the world for sure.\n\nList of car brands from Switzerland:\n\nAjax\n\nDufaux\n\nEnzmann 506\n\nLeblanc\n\nMartini\n\nMonteverdi\n\nRinspeed\n\nSbarro\n\nTaiwan\n\nIn Taiwan there are apparently over 3,000 automotive-related car companies, with Hotar Motor accounting for almost a third of the total car sales in the country. But they only have two car brands that have been founded here:\n\nCMC\n\nLuxgen Motor Co., Ltd.\n\nThailand\n\nFrom Thailand there’s only one local car brand to mention:\n\nThai Rung\n\nTunisia\n\nTunisia’s automotive industry is also pretty big, mostly because they’re working for European car brands. It’s one of the country’s major economic sectors that’s growing with every year that goes by. Despite that, there’s only one car local brand that have been started here.\n\nWallyscar\n\nTurkey\n\nWhen it comes to its automotive industry, Turkey has definitely not been messing around as it is one of the most important parts of their economy as we speak.\n\nAs a result, back in 2012 Turkey ended up producing as many as 1 million units on the market, literally inserting themselves into the industry and becoming a staple of the global network of production bases. Amongst their most reputable brands we have Tofas and Otosan/Anadol.\n\nList of car brands in Turkey:\n\nAnadol\n\nDevrim\n\nDiardi\n\nEtox\n\nTofaş\n\nUAE\n\nThe UAE started to establish itself as an international automotive hub with spectacular growth in these last couple of years. They’re a huge market for exotic cars and even though there aren’t too many car brands that have been originally started here we’re sure that’s all about to change in the next couple of years. These are the only local car brands from the UAE right now:\n\nAl Araba Company\n\nW Motors\n\nUkraine\n\nDespite the fact that Ukraine is one of the Europe’s biggest countries, its automotive industry is relatively small. But we’re sure that it will be one of the fastest growing sectors in the next couple of years. There are only four Ukraine-based car brands to mention:\n\nAvtoZAZ\n\nLuAZ\n\nUkrainian Automobile Corporation JSC\n\nZAZor Zaporizhia Automobile Building Plant\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nWhat started off as a distant dream in the 19th century Great Britain soon became one of their most prestigious avenues for the country as they were already considered to be the world’s second-largest transport producers.\n\nThey exported most of their vehicles as well, but sadly they couldn’t keep up with the United States, Germany, France or even with Asian automakers, which led to them losing a lot of their influence overseas.\n\nThey were even forced to sell off some of their big car names overseas, including Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Land Rover. Nowadays however, for the most part they focused their attention towards super luxury cars, and as of late they also started to put in the work regarding their armored vehicles.\n\nList of all British car brands:\n\nABC\n\nAberdonia\n\nAC Cars\n\nAdams\n\nAJS\n\nAlbion\n\nAllard\n\nAlldays\n\nAlta\n\nAlvis\n\nAndre\n\nArash\n\nArab\n\nArgyll\n\nAriel\n\nArrol-Johnston\n\nArmstrong Siddeley\n\nAscari Cars Ltd.\n\nAster\n\nAstra\n\nAston Martin\n\nAustin\n\nBatten\n\nBelsize\n\nBentley\n\nBerkeley\n\nBond\n\nBAC\n\nBristol\n\nBrooke\n\nBritish Salmson\n\nBrough Superior\n\nBSA\n\nBuckler\n\nCalthorpe\n\nCaparo\n\nCaterham\n\nClan\n\nConnaught\n\nCooper\n\nCostin\n\nCrossley\n\nCSC\n\nDaimler\n\nDavid Brown Automotive\n\nDavrian\n\nDe Lorean\n\nDeep Sanderson\n\nDellow\n\nDiva\n\nDutton\n\nEcosse\n\nElva\n\nEterniti Motors\n\nFairthorpe\n\nFarbio\n\nFarboud\n\nFBS\n\nFrisky\n\nGilbern\n\nGinetta\n\nGKD\n\nGKN\n\nGN\n\nGnome\n\nGordon-Keeble\n\nGrinnall\n\nGuy\n\nHealey\n\nHillman\n\nHRG\n\nHumber\n\nInvicta\n\nIota\n\nJaguar\n\nJBA Motors\n\nJensen Motors\n\nJowett\n\nKieft\n\nLagonda\n\nLammas-Graham\n\nLanchester\n\nLand Rover\n\nLea-Francis\n\nLeader\n\nLeidart\n\nLightning\n\nLola\n\nLister\n\nLotus\n\nLTI\n\nMarauder\n\nMarendaz\n\nMaudslay\n\nMcLaren\n\nMarcos Engineering\n\nMG Motor\n\nMini\n\nMK Sportscars\n\nMorgan Motor Company\n\nMorris Motors\n\nNoble\n\nOgle\n\nPanther\n\nParamount\n\nPeel\n\nPeerless\n\nPerry\n\nProdrive\n\nRadical\n\nRailton\n\nRapier\n\nRaymond Mays\n\nReliant\n\nRiley\n\nRochdale\n\nRolls-Royce\n\nRover Company\n\nRuston-Hornsby\n\nScott\n\nSheffield-Simplex\n\nSinger\n\nSpectre\n\nSquire\n\nStrathcarron\n\nSunbeam\n\nSwallow Doretti\n\nTamplin\n\nThames\n\nTornado\n\nTrident Cars Ltd\n\nTriking\n\nTriumph Motor Company\n\nTurner\n\nTrojan\n\nTVR\n\nUltima Sports Ltd.\n\nUnicar\n\nUnipower\n\nVale\n\nVanden Plas\n\nVauxhall Motors\n\nVegantune\n\nWarren-Lambert\n\nWarwick\n\nWestfield Sportscar\n\nWolseley\n\nFor detailed information on cars from the UK, check out our article about British car companies.\n\nUnited States\n\nOf course that the United States’ auto industry is doing just fine nowadays, after all, they’ve been at the literal top of the leaderboard since they first decided to tackle the market. The US is currently second only to China when it comes to the number of cars that they’ve produced, but as time moves on the gap is getting smaller and smaller.\n\nThey have a ton of different brands to pick from, including Ford Motor Company, General Motors and of course, Stellantis North America. The Great Depression caused a lot of the top car brands to go bankrupt back in the days, but these managed to pull through regardless.\n\nAmerican car manufacturers were literally revolutionaries regardless of how you want to spin it. Tackling every market there is to tackle out there, they’ve changed up the game as we know it literally turning in a profit even when there was no market to appeal to in the first place.\n\nMajor Auto Manufacturers from the US:\n\nChrysler\n\nChrysler\n\nDodge\n\nJeep\n\nRam\n\nFord Motor Company\n\nFord\n\nLincoln\n\nGeneral Motors\n\nBuick, formally the Buick Motor Division\n\nCadillac\n\nChevrolet\n\nGMC\n\nTesla Motors\n\nHennessey\n\nOther Automakers from US\n\nAC Propulsion\n\nAjax\n\nAM General\n\nAmbassador\n\nAMC\n\nAmerican\n\nAmerican Underslung\n\nAnteros Coachworks\n\nApollo\n\nApperson\n\nArnolt\n\nAuburn\n\nAurica Motors\n\nAvanti\n\nBrewster\n\nBrisco\n\nBrush\n\nBXR\n\nCarroll Shelby\n\nCase\n\nChadwick\n\nChandler\n\nChecker\n\nComet\n\nCommuter\n\nContinental\n\nCord\n\nCunningham\n\nDagmar\n\nDavis\n\nDe Soto\n\nDMC\n\nDetroit Electric\n\nDevon Motorworks\n\nDiana\n\nDort\n\nDu Pont\n\nDuesenberg\n\nDurant\n\nDuryea\n\nEagle\n\nEdsel\n\nElcar\n\nEMF\n\nEshelman\n\nFageol\n\nFalcon Motorsports\n\nFirestone-Columbus\n\nFisker Automotive, Inc\n\nFitch\n\nFlint\n\nFranklin\n\nGardner\n\nGeo\n\nGEM\n\nGM\n\nGraham\n\nGrant\n\nGray\n\nGriffith\n\nHAL\n\nHertz\n\nHudson\n\nImperial\n\nJordan\n\nKaiser\n\nKeller\n\nKissel\n\nKnox\n\nLa Fayette\n\nLa Salle\n\nLexington\n\nLocomobile\n\nLozier\n\nMarmon\n\nMartin\n\nMaxwell\n\nMercer\n\nMercury\n\nMerkur\n\nMitchell\n\nMohs\n\nMosler Automotive\n\nMuntz\n\nNash\n\nNavistar\n\nNational\n\nOakland\n\nOldsmobile\n\nOverland\n\nPackard\n\nPaige\n\nPanoz\n\nPaterson\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhantom Corsair\n\nPierce-Arrow\n\nPiontek\n\nPlayboy\n\nPlymouth\n\nPolaris Industries\n\nPontiac\n\nQvale\n\nRambler\n\nRossion Automotive\n\nRCH\n\nRevere\n\nRickenbacker\n\nRoamer\n\nRossion Automotive\n\nSainte Claire\n\nSaleen\n\nSaturn\n\nSaxon\n\nSSC North America\n\nScripps-Booth\n\nShelby\n\nSRT\n\nStanley\n\nStearns Knight\n\nStephens\n\nStudebaker\n\nStutz\n\nSuperformance\n\nTucker\n\nTwombly\n\nVector Motors Corporation\n\nVelie\n\nWaltham\n\nWills\n\nWillys\n\nWillys-Overland\n\nWoodill\n\nZimmer\n\nFor detailed information, click here to see the page about American car brands\n\nVietnam\n\nLast but not least, we also have to mention two car brands from Vietnam:\n\nMekong Auto\n\nVinaxukior Xuan Kien\n\nCar Brands FAQs\n\nIf you have burning questions about car brands, here are some of the most frequently asked questions and their answers.\n\nWhat is the most reliable car brand?\n\nAccording to recent Consumer Reports, Honda, Toyota, Kia, Nissan, Lexus or Hyundai are the most reliable car brands in the world. But big players such as Ford, GM or Fiat have also upped their game and started delivering more and more reliable cars.\n\nWhat is the best car brand?\n\nOf course, we all might have a different answer to this question. It really depends on what you want from a car. If want reliability, the answer is right up here. If you want an electric car the answer is Tesla, if you want a cool-looking car, built with speed and performance in mind the answer is probably Porsche and if you want a popular choice the answer could be Ford, BMW, Audi or Mercedes-Benz.\n\nHow many car brands are out there?\n\nThe exact number of active car makers is probably unknown right now but only in this list we’ve mentioned exactly 990 car brands, active or non active, which makes this article the most detailed post on car brands out there. But the real number is probably over 1,000 car makes, as more and more electric start-ups are founded every single month.\n\nWho owns which car brands?\n\nThis question should have a dedicated article by itself, but it we could summarize it, this would be the answer:\n\nVolkswagen AG owns: Audi, Bentley, Bugatti, Cupra, Ducati, Lamborghini, Porsche, SEAT, Skoda, and of course, Volkswagen.\n\nToyota Motor Corporation owns: Daihatsu, Lexus and Toyota.\n\nGeneral Motors owns: Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC. Plus a few Chinese brands.\n\nHonda Motor owns: Honda and Accura.\n\nBMW Group owns: BMW, MINI and Rolls Royce.\n\nFord Motor Company owns: Ford, Lincoln, Mustang and Troller.\n\nDaimler AG owns: Mercedes-Benz, AMG, and Smart.\n\nHyundai Motor Group owns: Hyundai, Genesis and Kia.\n\nRenault-Nissan-Mitsubishi owns: Alpine, Dacia, Datsun, Infinity, Nissan, Mitsubishi, Venucia, Lada, and of course, Renault.\n\nStellantis (born from the merger between Fiat Chrysler and Peugeot Citroen) owns: Alfa Romeo, Citroen, Chrysler, Dodge, DS, FIAT, Jeep, Lancia, Maserati, Opel, Peugeot, RAM, and Vauxhall.\n\nTata Motors owns: Land Rover, Jaguar and of course, Tata.\n\nSuzuki owns: Suzuki and Maruti Suzuki.\n\nGeely Auto Group owns: Lotus Cars, Polestar and Volvo.\n\nIndependent car brands: Aston Martin, Ferrari, McLaren, Tesla Motors, Mazda, Subaru and many other less known companies.\n\nWhat are the luxury car brands?\n\nWe’ve made a special article with the most expensive car brands in the world. We definitely have to mention Rolls-Royce, Bentley or Maybach as the most luxurious car brands, but we can also count exotic car makers such as Lamborghini, Ferrari, McLaren, Pagani, Aston Martin, Bugatti, Koenigsegg, SSC North America, and even Maserati, Jaguar, Porsche or Lotus Cars in here.\n\nSome people also consider BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Cadillac, Genesis, Land Rover or even Tesla Motors as luxury car brands, but we think they’re mid-level cars.\n\nWhat car brands last the longest?\n\nOnce again, if you’re looking for reliability the answer is probably Honda, Toyota, Kia, Nissan, Lexus or Hyundai. But if you’re wondering which is the oldest car in the world, the answer is La Marquise, an 1884 car made by Frenchmen De Dion, Bouton and Trépardoux.\n\nSummary\n\nThis list was compiled by looking at the Wikipedia articles and our own research on other various sites.\n\nIf we missed out on any car companies from your country, please feel comment below to let us know.\n\nSo which car makes do you think are the best?"
