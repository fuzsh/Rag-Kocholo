        "text": "Westfield Sportscars are manufacturers of both factory built and kit versions of several two-seater, open top sportscars. Their main product line is a Lotus Seven inspired car - vehicles originally designed by Colin Chapman with only the bare essentials for motoring in order to give the rawest and most exhilarating driving experience.\n\nHistory[]\n\nWhilst Caterham Cars bought the rights from Lotus Cars, Chris Smith set up a rival company and manufactured kits with very similar styling and construction. This led Caterham to threaten litigation (based on Industrial design rights) in the late 1980s which was eventually settled out of court and resulted in Westfield improving and changing the design of their cars. Whilst externally sharing a common look, Westfield and Caterham cars are somewhat different in construction. Westfield prefers to employ the same glass fibre body method that Lotus has traditionally used for their other models such as the Elise, Esprit, and Elan, rather than the aluminium used by Caterham.\n\nWestfield has also pioneered technical innovations such as Independent rear suspension and a wider chassis, which other manufacturers have since adopted. The company has recently introduced a version of its SEi kit that uses donor parts from the Mazda Mx5 Miata. This is generally called an SDV (Single Donor Vehicle) kit. There is also an SDV kit that uses a Ford Sierra as a donor.\n\nAccording to figures given to the magazine Total Kit Car, Westfield produces about 450 SEi and XTR chassis each year.[1]\n\nIn the first series of BBC's Top Gear, a Westfield XTR2 driven by the black Stig set a faster lap time than the reigning record holder of that series, the Pagani Zonda.\n\nIn December 2006, Westfield became a part of Potenza Sports Cars Limited.[2] In December 2007, it was announced that GTM Cars also became a part of Potenza Sports Cars.\n\nModels[]\n\nFW400\n\nMegabusa\n\nMegablade\n\nSE\n\nSEi & Sport\n\nSEiGHT\n\nSDV\n\nSport Turbo\n\nXTR2\n\nXTR4\n\nXI\n\nRacing models[]\n\nAeroSport\n\nAeroRace\n\nPrototypes and concept cars[]\n\nTRZ\n\nTopaz\n\nSee also[]\n\nLotus Cars\n\nCaterham Cars\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]\n\nOfficial[]\n\nWestfield Sportscars Ltd.\n\nInformation on the current Westfield XI\n\nInformation on the current Westfield XTR2\n\nClubs & Forums[]\n\nWestfield Sports Car Club - Black Country Area\n\nWestfield Sports Car Race Drivers Association\n\nWestfield Sports Car Club\n\nWestfield XTR2 Forums\n\nWestfield versus Caterham on youtube\n\nFM Westfield builder forum\n\nResources[]\n\nPictures, info and Technical help on Westfield Sports Cars\n\nInformation on Westfield kit cars and other kit car manufacturers\n\nBuild Diaries[]\n\nJohn Williams's Westfield - An example of a builders website\n\nA nut & bolt account of rebuilding a Westfield - by Paul Crisp\n\nMellow Yellow - A build up of a Vauxhall powered Seiw Westfield - by Tigger\n\nA build up of a Sierra based SDV - by Rob Sims\n\nRacing[]\n\nBARC Westfield Championship\n\nNew race formula for 2008 in The Netherlands\n\nTemplate:Westfield Sportscars range\n\nThe British car industry â€“ companies & marques Marque 1900s 1910s 1920s 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s Rolls-Royce Rolls-Royce Limited Rolls-Royce Limited & Bentley Rolls-Royce Motors Rolls-Royce Motors (Vickers) BMW & VW Group BMW Bentley Bentley VW Group Armstrong Siddeley Siddeley-Deasy Armstrong Whitworth Armstrong Siddeley Bristol Siddeley Rolls-Royce Limited Rolls-Royce plc Aston Martin Aston Martin Aston Martin Lagonda PAG (Ford) Aston Martin Lagonda Lagonda Lagonda Tickford Tickford Jaguar SS Cars Jaguar Jaguar\n\n&\n\nDaimler BMH British Leyland Jaguar\n\n&\n\nDaimler PAG (Ford) Tata Daimler Daimler BSA BSA Lanchester Lanchester Rover Rover Rover Rover Austin Rover Group\n\n&\n\nLand Rover Group (BL plc) Rover Group (BAe) Rover Group\n\n(BMW) MG & Rover (BMW) Land Rover PAG (Ford) Alvis Alvis BAE Systems Standard Standard Standard Triumph Leyland Motors British Motor Heritage Triumph Dawson Triumph BMW Riley Riley Nuffield Organisation BMC BMH MG Morris Garages (MG) Rover Group\n\n(BMW) MG Rover Group (Phoenix) SAIC\n\n+\n\nNAC SAIC Morris Morris Morris Wolseley Wolseley Austin Austin Austin Vanden Plas Vanden Plas Mini Mini (BMW) Austin-Healey Austin (BMC) & Donald Healey Jensen Jensen Motors Britcar Holdings Jensen Cars Reliant Reliant Reliant Bond Bond AC AC Cars (several ownership & company name changes) Argyll Argyll Argyll Bristol (cars) Bristol Cars Caterham Caterham Crossley Crossley Dutton Dutton Dutton Ginetta Ginetta Gordon-Keeble Peerless & Warwick Gordon-Keeble Jowett Jowett Blackburn Lea-Francis Lea-Francis Lotus Lotus GM Europe (General Motors) Proton McLaren McLaren Marcos Marcos Marcos Marcos Morgan Morgan Napier Napier Turner Turner TVR TVR Westfield Westfield Potenza Sports Cars GTM GTM Vauxhall Vauxhall Motors General Motors GM Europe (General Motors) Vulcan Vulcan Hillman Hillman Humber Rootes Chrysler Europe (Chrysler) Peugeot (PSA) Humber Humber Singer Singer Rootes Sunbeam Sunbeam Sunbeam-Talbot-Darracq Rootes (As Sunbeam-Talbot) Rootes Rootes Talbot Talbot Marque 1900s 1910s 1920s 1930s 1940s 1950s 1960s 1970s 1980s 1990s 2000s"
