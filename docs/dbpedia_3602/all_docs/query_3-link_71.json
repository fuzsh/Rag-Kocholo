        "text": "Moving from cost to value: The agile framework for Global Business Services\n\nChanges in the cost-benefit equation—driven by new technology and a changing, unpredictable labor market—are altering the way companies think about how and where they deliver services. As companies evaluate what's core to their businesses, they are focusing more on the changing technology, data and talent landscape. This means automation and upskilling play bigger roles in the modern framework for Global Business Services (GBS) to solve not only for cost, but quality and innovation.\n\nWhat is Global Business Services (GBS)?\n\nGlobal Business Services describes the different types of organization models a business can use to deliver enabling services, including shared services (business-owned and operated), outsourcing (3rd party owned and operated), Centers of Excellence, Hybrid and automation. Services can include both back office support functions (finance, HR, IT, procurement, legal, tax) and front office, customer facing functions (customer service, call center, engineering, R&D).\n\nThere is no one size fits all approach- GBS can employ a number of levers depending on the company’s culture, industry, and business dynamics.\n\nThe GBS Journey\n\nAs organizations have matured, we have seen a move from siloed functional shared services or outsourcing, to today’s more holistic end-to-end process lifecycle. The rise of digitalization enables GBS to provide value-added benefits that are as important as lower costs. Centers can incorporate automation, visualization, analytics, and other digital tools to develop more effective ways to support the business. Where technology can automate low-complexity activities, there is an opportunity to retrain and refocus your people on more value added areas. GBS has become a valuable partner and capability, rather than simply a transactional processing center.\n\nPwC is here to work with YOU\n\nOur PwC team is uniquely positioned to work hand in hand with clients to support their Global Business Services journey by bringing 1,500+ professionals in over 30 countries with operational, functional and technical expertise to each transformation, from strategy through execution.\n\nThe following are key capabilities to accelerate your organisation’s service delivery transformation at every phase. Your approach will depend on whether you plan to outsource to an external party or create captive shared services within a lower-cost area. Here’s a closer look:\n\nPwC's Global Business Services 2020 Study: Key to Agility\n\nCOVID has shattered antiquated perceptions of what activities need to be performed side by side in an office and what can be performed effectively in a remote or centralised location. GBS organisations emerged from the past year more agile than ever before and a greater partner to the business.\n\nThis study is the sixth in a series of publications produced every two years. The survey on which the study is based was conducted from November 2020 to January 2021, and included companies throughout the world and from a wide variety of industries. The results cover more than 300 shared service centers, enabling us to provide a comprehensive overview of the status quo, current developments, existing challenges and upcoming challenges. The study also covers the implications of these issues on strategy and vision, organisation and governance, processes, technology and data, and people and culture, as well as providing an outlook on upcoming key trends and further developments in shared service centers.\n\nExplore the survey"
