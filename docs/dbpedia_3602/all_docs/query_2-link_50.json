And nore underground riches have yet to be discovered. - By sending his tanks up to the banks of the Chari, Colonel Moammar el-Qadhdhafi has done more than take up a strategic pos3tion in Africa. He has also made a very smart economic move. Tomorrow, he will be able to exploit the uranium deposits in northern Chad, in the Aouzou Strip. This means guaranteed sources of supply for Tripoli, which continues to chase its nuclear rainbow. Also, indications of oil in Chad have been disclosed by American companies that are combing the territory. More than ever, Africa is exciting greed. Its wealth is always disputed. Known yesterday for its minerals, black Africa is now waking up to oil. Prospecting activity for crude was negligable in the region 10 years ago--except in Nigeria-- and now it is a f~.vored locale. E~on, Texaco, Elft, and other companies compete for permits to explore in tt~e Gulf of Guinea. This 3s real fresh hupe for the African states. They needed it. Neither their mani�old mineral wealth, nor their cacao and coffee plantations have been able to assure Africa's economic take-off. T~wenty years after independence, it remains the poorest, least det~~l.nped, and most ill-nourished continent. Thus, too, the most fragile: Africa's f.abulous wealth lies in a wasteland. The swimming pool's translucent blue waters ripple behind the immense bay window of the technicians' dining hall, white tablecloths and air conditioners. \"Since the Kolwezi operation, we feel more confident. We know that French troops will immed- iately, intervene if our families are endangered,\" a technician confides. Several dozen kilometers from the marxist but pres~_ntly peacefu'1 Congo, close to 250 French- men are among the 1,450 people working on tlle Haut-Ogooue plateau, at Mounana, a uranium mine in Gabon. They cannot help imagining the worst. 1 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Space, Aeronautics, Nuclear Energy Isolated, in the b ush or in the great equatorial forest, the mining centers are the seheitive nerve end ings of the continent, the greatest concentrations of wealth. Without Africa, the wheels of the European economy could not \"turn\" as they do. Close to 90 percent of the manganese France imports, more than 85 percent of the phosphates, and nearly 40 percent of the copper, comes from Africa. The Republic - of South Africa is France's largest supplier of coal. Today Paris buys uranium with no holds barred from Niger, Gabon, and Namibia, in order to profit from the - depressed price. ~ Africa provides not only signif icant quantities of ordinary metals and minerals (bauxite, lead, copper, iron ore...) but also strategic materials, those without which the most advanced industries (space, weaponry, aeronautics, nuclear energy) would be unable to produce their special alloys. Southern Africa, with its Soviet partner, is said to enjoy nearly a world monopoly on a number of rare metals. It has more than 80 percent of the gold, chrome, industrial diamonds, vanadium, plat-~. inum; more than 60 percent of the cobalt, manganese and even uranium. The Soviet Union in southern Africa? This is no longer a f3~~ion. East Germans and Cubans are planted in Mozambique, in Angola...in the immediate neighborhood of the country's three great mining countries: Zambia, Zaire, and above all South Africa, flanked by Namibia. South Af rica, with its mineral empires--Anglo-American, De Beers, General Min3ng, is extracting no fewer than 32 substances from the earth. The dollar value of its mineral production is ranked third in the world, after the USSR and the U.S., but before Canada and Australia. For geologists it is unquestionably the best- known countr; on the continent. \"In terms of minera ls, Africa could still be holding plenty of surprises for us,\" ~ confides an offic3al of the Copper Trade Union Assembly in Paris. Meanwhile, the world's big mining groups havP been reluctant to move into Africa f.or several years. Price levels are certainly not very attractive, and mineral exploitation is being penalized by the increases in energy costs. But there is something else. \"'t'he continent is not very secure. There are too many political risks.\" The oil groups are themsel.ves less reluctant. They are exhuming old exploration permits from their files, asking for new ones, planting their derricks almost every- where. Would they not also be sub3ect to political risks? Yes, but the reasons for minimizing them outweigh them: in th P medium term, the demand for oil is go3.ng to remain very strong; increases in the price of crude are opening up new areas for prospecting. And, above all, the oil groups want to get free of the states that - are oppressing them: in the North Sea, where the governments are excessively meddlesome, and in the Middle East, a powder-keg. - A New Texas? 'P!Zis rush for black gold is not always an orderly one. There are rivalries: the French and Spanish are engaged in a\"fr3endly little war\" to get permits in Equa- torial Guinea. Much depends on luck, too: Elf withdrew from the Ivory Coast just before the companies with which it had been affiliated made a discovery. However, the race has produ ~ed results.

ONLY 1.983), Africa !.n 1975 had only 4 oil countries: Nigeria, which today \"weighs in\" at more than 100 million tons per year, almost equal to Fraiice's consumption; then, very modestly, Gabon, Angola by virtue of its Cabinda Enclave, and the Congo. Gabon's production (t;-9 million tons), barring a miraculous discovery, should peak out. Angota and especially the Congo could climb rapidly in output t~ more than 10 mill.lon tons eacti. There are also the \"newcomers.\" Ivory Coast: a new Texas? ~hat remains to be seen. But its production, just Iilce that of Cameroon, Ghana, or Benin, sh~uld grow sub- stantially. Lbery little drop.... And especially since there is natural gas. Lagos is thinking of building a giant liquefaction unit (I6 billion cubic meters per - year) which witti methane tankers, would make it possible to export t~ Europe or the United States. The gigantic investment is estimated at some 50 billion Fr. Gaz - de France and a European consortium, anxious to diversify its suppliers, have jumped at the cliance by concluding a supply contract that should take eff ect starting in - 1985-1986.

Already, businessmen are crowd3n~ into the big hotels in Doual.a and Brazzaville. ~ The ALrican marlcet is sti11 dominated by the former colonial powers. In 1980, the UniCed Kingdom, whicYi granted does not benefit much fro:n African crude, has garnered a trade surplus of Fr 1S billion in sub-Saharan Africa (whicli i.ncludes South Africa, ' where it is sti11 very much present). The French balance of trade with black Africa is negative (Fr 3.S billion). But, without the two OPEC-zone countries (Nigeria and , Gabon), the balance becomes a Fr 4 billion surplus. Rare, in these times: Overall, ~ France remai.ns Africa':; b:iggest supplier. Francophone Africa still accounts for ; one-fourth of. France's ovei~seas engineering contr.acts. \"Africa is sort of our techni.cal test bench,\" confides a Parisian banker. While the big firms are in line - for exploitation of i-aw matcrials, i.n the carr.ying out of turnkcy projects or _ important addirions of infrastructure a multitude of French firms cover the terrain, whether it be shoes, constrtiction, or beer. \"Today, in Aibidjan,\" says the same banker, \"th ere are 10 times as many Frenchmeri than there were when ivory Coast became independent.\" The spheres of influence of the former metropolitan powers ar~ not completely closed to tr.espassers.

He is in some ways the protot}*~e of the African businessman. He is somewhat of an entrepreneur, a merchant _ and speculator most of all. \"Africa's only hoom is in real. estate and import-export. For an alhadji in northern Nigeria or northern Cameroon, even 6 months is long-term,'' - says a diplomat posted to Africa. Precariousness is the distinctive characterisCic of the African economy. The multinationals do not have to be prodded to exploit the natural resources or get into banking or commerce in Africa. But they have more of a tendency to shun industry. Except in Nigeria, which, with its 80 million inhabi- taiits, offers a gigantic market in a continent swarming with micra-states. The result: Da'~car's industrial free zone, the only one in black Africa, remains vir- tually empty. Products \"made in 'rogo\" or \"made in Kenya\" are not inundating the European supermarkets. Agriculture is on the brink of catastrophe. ~verywhere, or nearly everywhere, the cultivation of food crops, too long neglected, is no longer suff icient to feed the populace. Africa is still the helpless prey of famine. The continent has had to import increa~ingly large amounts of costly grain from Europe, the United States, and even from South Africa. Wheat and powdered milk are competing dangerously with manioc and millet. In the Oyem region, in northern Gabon, a farmer makes in a year what a modest civil servant in Libreville earns in a month. The countryside is emptying. 'Che great tragedy of the African economy is that twenty years after independence it is still just a trading economy. For Senegal it is groundnuts; for Togo, phosphates; what then for Mozambique? The cajou nut! Therefor~ the producers, ~~~ho do not have control over their prices, cannot offset the regular cost increases for equipment goods and imported oil. _ Prussian Guarantee The public finances, even when they are not encumbered by corruption or prestige projects, are poorly equipped to withstand the shock [of this inflation]. Resources remain skimpy. Niger's uranium sales, its principal source of revenue, represent less than one-third of the turnover of the RATP [Independent Parisian Transport System]. Some states even have a hard time paying their employees each month. i'heir external debt is becoming distended. In Paris, last November, Rene Monory, the minister of the economy, pressed 10 big Freiich banks to provide an emergency loan of Fr 700 million to Ivory Coast. But this miraculous bail-out only buys time. For _ a number of countries, survival 3s going to depend on foreign aid, which is still in some ways the ultimate object of the game. \"Western liberalism corresponds to authentically African values and constitutes, if it has faith in it. an antidote to totalitarianism\": Minister Robert Galley, defending the cooperat-ion budget before the deputies last fall, was speaking frankly. The adversary, in Africa, is the USSR. Not that it has a wealth of exper3ence in matter~ of development assistance. For the USSR it is simply a tactic for advancing its pawns. There are bankers, however, who f ind this attract~Lve. \"For example, since the East Germans took over adminis- tration in Mozambique,\" a Parisian finsncier confides ironically, \"we do not require much persuading to make loans. We have a'Prussian guarantee'...\" Clearly, what is at stake between the Western nations and the USSR is not aid, but power. Rivalries: this term best characterizes the struggle for ir,fluence--under cover of assistance--being conducted by the western powers among themselves. The United States. which up to now has not had much of a vresence in black Africa. could ~et a strong toothold in the continent by taking the lead trom its allies in health sector cooperation. United States aid personnel in the future will be able to take advant- age of direct contacts established in the field.

Aside from the above-mentioned islands France owns several islands also in the ~ ; southern region of the Indian Ocean, 3n the Antarctic, known as the Southern and ' Antarctic French Territories (TAAF); Adelie, a piece of land in the Antarctic ice f loe area, three archipelagoes below the Antarctic Circle, and Crozet, Kerguelen, ~ Saint-Paul and Amsterdam Islands.

At fi,rst glance it is indeed ISut not to the degree it seems. In fact, this presence off ers three - major advantages: economic, political and strategic. In the f irst area, it provides France an immense maritime domain and allows France the use of an exclusive economi.c: zone extending 200 miles out from the coastlines. This is the limit claimed by ~ Third World countries who because of their technological handicaps hope to protect their maritime resources tietter by having it. 6 .

The decrees of 11 and 25 February 1977 implementing that law provide for establishing such zones along the North Sea, Channel, and Atlantic coastlines as well as off occupied French Guiana and around Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon not to r~ention the occupied colonies and territories in _ the southwest Indian Ocean. Land and Sea Legs - When this was done, Giscard's France became 12 times larger than it had been before. - Implementing the law 3.n a11 the colonies and other occugied territories added to France's total arPa more than 10 million square km of water and marine resources. = This makes France number three in the world in terms of ocean area, an area with we11-known medtum and long-term economic stakes (see accompanying box). The political and strategic repercussions o� this kind of colonial presence are in- deed important. They are at one with and add to the neocolon~tlist and imperialist - aims and practices which are com3ng to light in a number of instances ou the African continent. The Elysee's African nol~.r.y these last few years is being directly ex- tended into the Indian Ocean because o:~ a fact of capital importance : one out of five OAU member states borders on that ocean. \"Giscard the,q~'rican,\" with the remarkable gift of being everywhere at once which characterizes him, wants land and is getting his sea legs, in spite of the 12,000 km separating France from the Tndian Ocean. Franee is at home there, it is being asserted in Paris. So much so that the Elysee feels in a strong enough position to prapose, with the help of Dj ibouti, holding a conference on the Horn of Africa. When references are made on an international level to the Colombo and AntarAanariv~o \"Indian Ocean--Zone of Peac~\" conferences, there is an immediate reaction. Giscard - trades in the accordion for a triangle, dances the maloya, and speaks in Creole, in order to make himself out as the representa.tive of a regional power. Reunion re- _ mains in effect the French stronghold which serves as the maj or excuse for this kin.d of policy, which is underlain by many calculations. Reunion is the site of - a hi~h-ranking mili~.ary command which takes in ten islands or archipelagoes and their na.ritime approaches spread out over 2.8 million square km. It constitutes - the principal base for a policq of omnipresence which the French want to look ~ natural. 'I'he r~gion's most important r.'rogr~ssive forces feel this quite keenly, , since they are convinced that any pIIOCess of demilitarization which would allow - an atmosphere of peace to be established, an atmosphere which is both possible and desired, can only go hand in hand with the dism,antling of colonialism in the Indian _ Ocean. _ This colonial presence is coupled with a well-lmown and partlcularly sizable and disquieting military presence (read \"The Vast Armada\" i.n AF'RTQUE-A.SIE, Issue No. 233, 16 February-1 March 1981) , making France the number two Western military power in . the region. This military presence has been strongly increased during the term of the current -1 president which is ab.out to expire. This is because of the place Giscard's France has taken in global imperia'list strategy. 7 F4R OFFIC[AL USE ~NLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2047/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 FOR OFF[CIAL USE ONLY ~ As the cards lie dealt among the major Western powers, Paris has a choice hand be- cause of the interests if has maintained in this region. And under American leader- ship it is assuming a policema.n's role i~i. the race for controY of the Gulf's re- sources and in the attempt to suppress national and social liberat ion activity in the Indian Ocean, activity which is marked particularly by the struggle against apartheid. In this regard, one should not fail to observe the strengChening of the Paris-Pre- toria connection over these last few years. Tfie dominaat aspects of this connection, - denials and evasions notwithstanding, are increased French investment~ a growth in arms sales, and a common interest in the search for strategic raw materials ror nuclear programs. This makes the attitude of France, one of the \"contact group\" cauntries, towar~as Pretoria more understandable. This attitude is at the very least an ambiguous one - on the Namibia question. / With the help of Mauritius, Kenya, Djibouti and Comoros, Giscard's policy has also been making advances with its \"trialoque\" plan so it can warm its way into Arab- African cooperation (read Pierre Clary's article on page 38). Economic and technical cooperation, and financial aid--which are often sources of disappointment for countries which have opted for independent economi~ development-- are two other cards of French foreign policy whi~h have been played extensively in _ this region duri.ng this presiden.tia.l term. This is probabl.y what explains what has been observed as Paris's tendency to \"make approaches'' to the region's progres- sive countries and explains recent flirting with Maputo and Dar-es-Salaam in parti- cular, which are considered two major Indian Ocean components in the stakes which have evolved in southern Africa. But the apparent \"generosity\" of this aid has cor- responding limits, which are palitical. ~ Blackmail When a progressive country wants to or does shake loose, this cooperation marks out economic problems with which the country is ;onfronted and the coopers~ion gets in the way. It acts then as a political factor whic:~: at least makes the country keep quiet if that is possible, it is does not indeed set up a troublesame complicity. The most recent illustration of aid used as a political weapon in the Indian Ocean ls the case of the Seychelles, where blaclanail took place so quickly that it sur- prised and insulted even those groups on the islands favorably disposed towards Par is . The facts deserve to be mentioned. In October 1979 a French foreign aid volunteer was arrested for complicity in manipulating the youth movement into opposing the plan for national service for young people. Ultimatums demanding that he be set free - poured down on State House, the seat of the presidency ~.n Victoria. First of all, Paris recalled an initial group of foreign aid vol~:at:e~rs. Faced with the obsti- nate refusal of a small country to give way to France`s de~ands, it brought home - a ~econd group. I?uring a third stage, financial aid was suspended for certain pro- jects being worked on. The fourth step, which was not expected by Minister Galley's departmental offices, was that President Rene, faced with so mu~h arrogant behavior, _ handed over to Par:Cs a third and final group of volunteers. _ 8 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-44850R000300104462-9 - FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY In this game of economic blackmail, neo-colonialist France, used ta winning on other _ fronts, did things the wrong way in Seychelles; where the lesson was taken and it _ resulted in diversification of cooperation and exchange relationships. Whea the underwater part of the iceberg made its appearance, it served as a reminder of how artifica.:~1 the talk had been about the exemplary nature of sincere, dis- interested, irreproachable and mutually advantageous cooperation--mechanical and soothing talk suitable for a ceremony laying the first stone or for a diplomatic cocktail party. But in reflection about the Indian Ocean and its environs a purely regional approach _ does not allow one to ~rasp the details of the actual stakes involved which pit the forces of progress against the supporters of a declining order. \"Whoever controls the Indian Oc~an controls the world's new vital center and can gain ascendancy in global policym~.king,\" observes an expert in international relations at the Naval Acade.my at Annapolis. But the peoples of the region no longer want either a present made up of exploita- t ion or a future the keqs to which lie in other capital cities. They want the fol- lowing Issa song, a song which bitterly drones on and on, no longer to be a reflec- ' tion of reality: \"The land I come from is so dry that when you milk the camels one udder gives hard butter and other dry cheese.\" - [accompanying box] Fishing for NodulPs . � France is thinking of expanding its industrial fishi.ng in the Indian Ocean, which is one of the world's richest fishing grounds, in order to make catches on the order of 30,000-50,000 tons per year. Regarding mineral resources, Paris a1sA expects to find deposits of gold, silver, uranium and copper in \"its\" southern territories. But in the mining area, the French - are much more interested in manganese nodules. Manganese nodules of varying sizes s~tting in the great depths of the ocean are ina.de up of iron and manganese oxides asso ciated with nickel oxides, copper, cobalt, titan.ium and vanadium. These are - the sources of ocean minerals most likely to be mined in the medium term. The rich-. est deposits are found in a band about 200 km wide by 1600 km long which runs vir- tually east to west along the southern edge of the equatorial belt, in depths of about 1700-4000 meters in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. '1`wo principal methods are used tu pick up the nodules. The first one, perfected by the Japaness, is one that uses rev~olving buckets. The other one is hydraulic and was perfected by the Americans and British. In 1970 the total value of mineral resources to be drawn from the oceans was esti- mated at $1 bill ion. Manganese nodules are so concentrated at great depths in cer- tain ocean zones that mining them can be considered the most significant aspect of _ underwater mining at stake. - 9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/48: CIA-RDP82-44850R000300104462-9 FOR OfrFIC[AL USE ONLY Prospecting has made it possible for France to locate three deposits within the 200- mile zone southeast of Reunion, near the islands occupied by Madagascar.

The minister of agriculture has indicated - that in this last-mentioned province the situation gives cause for concern in the - cantons of Quilengues, Lubango, Chibia, Gambos, Capelongo and Humpata where there has been practically no rain since April 1980. = Crops have been affected but cattle raising has been hit most of all: livestock is concentrated in the cantons of Quilengues, Quipungo, Chibia, Gambos and Capelongo. Even if conditions were to go back to normal starting in April, we must expect a sizable number o~ dead livestock starting next August because of the lack of water and of su�f icient grazing land. Though an emergency plan has been worked out for Huila Province, there is nothing of that kin.d for the Ben.gu~la, Cunene, and Mocamedes regions. This runs the risk of disastrous consequences when you consider the periods of time needed to imple- ment plans. The emergency plan for Huila is directed along two fronts. First, it provides for . carrying out a signif icant marketing drive from now until August while the live- stock is still in good condition for meat production. Secondly, provision is made to improve the network of water distribut3on for peopl~ anii animals in the cantons which,are most affected via the use of underground piping when the tima comes that surface water is no longer suff icient. . According to the state enterprise DINAPROPE jNational Cattle Products Distributing Cc~mpany], monthly meat consumption in Huila Province is 170 tons, which is equi- valent to 1,100 head of cattle. About 2,500 head are normally marketed per month. So it is possihle for that figure to reach 3,000 head in May and June. This is done in the form of barter for manufactured goods. One hea3 of cattle represents an average value o~ 6,000 kwanzas, which means that goods which have a certain monetary and social value are made available in return. Tf manufactured goods are lackin~, the barter can be done for foodstuffs (corn, sugar, salt). 12 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY APPROVED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 APPR~VED FOR RELEASE: 2007/02/08: CIA-RDP82-00850R000300100062-9 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY As a result, Huila Province in a normal marketing month should have availahle ~xom bINAPROPE operations alone a sum of 15-18 million k~aaFezas, 70 percent in the foxm o~ industrial goods (light motorcycles, bicycles, ra~ ios, tape recorders, clothes) and go4ds of lesser value (plows, machetes, crockery, c igarette ligfiters, lanterns~ hats, buttons, needles) which have become well-knoam ~.mong and appreciated by the people. The plan set up for Huila figures that for the current year 26,000 head of cattle, 17,500 pigs, and 25,000 goats w311 be marketed. The problem is that the sale of cattle will liave to be accomplished lietween noor and August and that the inter- ~ medi.ary enterprise, DTNAPROPE, does not have industrial goods available in suffi- cient quantity. AI3GOP [Angolan Press Agency] has indicated that once Hu~.la Provin~ce's projected ~ consumption has heen met, the surplus should he moved live to Benguela, Huambo, Mocamedes and Luanda Provinces fo~ their consumpt ion, i.n the context of a plan wh3.ch _ has yet to be set up at DTNAPROPE's general manager level. - At the Ministry of Agriculture 3,t is felt that Angola will not be a61e to cope with the worrisome situation created by the drought witfi only its own resources and that FAO assistance w~.ll be needed.

This system has - its problems, particularly in transporting products, which are perishable and must be transported quickly. Another problem to be solved is fihe lack of industrial groducts (cloth, clothes, batteries, radios, etc.) for which these agricultural products are exchanged in a barter economy. On the other hand, these agricultural cooperat3ves must be given credit �or auccessf~tlly supplying on a regular basis the local pineapple canning factories. _ It was suggeated Chat the cooperatives supply directly the fru3ts and vegetables t~hey produce, without using intermediaries.

In part it reflects his own judgment, but it also says something about Botswana's multi-party system and the nature of the ruling party itself: \"Whatever policy prevailed under Sir Seretse,\" he told THE FINANCIAL TIMES, \"was not just his own individual philosophy, but the philosophy of his party. And as of now I cannot foresee any major political ; or economic change in our strategy.\" There certainly can be no change, he argues, in the country's major foreign policy issue--relations with neighbouring South Africa. Botswana gets around 85 percent of its imports, including oil, from there, he points out. \"So sanctions against South Africa virtually means sanctions against Botswana\"--hence Botswana's absten- tions in the recent UN vote on the issue. \"I'm dead certain that if there were sancti~ns, the South Africans would pass them = on to us firsC. If there is anything in short supply it is nei ghbouring black states that talk too loud at the Organisation of African Unity and the UN that suffer the consequences.\" There are currently about 1,000 refugees in Botswana, mainly from South Africa, but their activities are strictly circumscribed. \"We have come out very clearly to both the OAU and the UN that we are not in a position to allow BoCswana to be used as a launching pad. Those who are ~ealous of our independence would use this as a pre-text for attacking us. \"To start with not many countries understood, but now most, if not all, do appre- ciate our position. Gaborone has no formal diplomatic links with Pretoria but Botswana carries out what has come to be called 'telephone diplomacy.' When things happen we pick up a phone and ask Pretoria: 'What are you up to?\"' If Botswana has to live with what the president describes as a\"troublesome neigHbour\" at leas;. there is relief on one border. Zimbabwe's independence last ~ year meant an end to border incursions and other problems: \"The 20,000 refugees ~ that were here have now gone home.

Nevertheless, the Rhodesian war left a mark. The Botswana def ence force was created as a response to the incursions. Today the force totals some 2,500 men, on which P56M will be apent over tFi2 19?9-85 development plan period--a not insignificant _ burden i.n a country with a population of only 850,000. Dr Masire argues that nearly double this will be spent on education--\"I think this s:tows our priorities are right\"--and much of the military spending is on the _ basic items required by a defence force, such as barracks: \" It's not like South Africans are not spending even more money on something that already exists.\" - The president does not underestimate the difficulties that lie ahead if the planned _ targets for rural development and job creation are to be reached. The land is _ generally arid and school-leavers are finding it increasingly difficult to find 3obs in the towns. \"First o� all we thought the biggest obstacle was finance, but we have come to a point where an even bigger constraint is manpower. Rural development is skill- intensive and we need more people to implement projects scattered all over the _ country. \"And we have a comparatively new phenomenon. In the past we only had underemploy-� ' ment. Somebody may not have o~rned cattle, but he would be looking afCer them. Now we have people coming to Gaborone looking for jobs because they have no cattle _ of their own, while the man who does own cattle ].ooks after them himself. Unemploy- ment is becoming very pronounced hence our concern about rural development and job I creation.\" It is also one reason behind Botswana's efforts to expand the industrial sector and encouraging foreign investment. Foreign exchange regulations are liberal and the government does not demand half the equity in joint ventures--\"but we do insist _ on equal representation on the board of management.\" Unfortunately, says Dr Masire, \"being a rather turbulent region, people are always visiting the inquities of our neighbours upon us. We need to explain just where we are and what our future plans are.

Together with Keren, Massa~a is the city that suffered the most; however, it is also the city where the burden of fear is least noticeable. There is no curfew - since entrance to the city is easily controlled and guard posts are fewer than el~sewhere. In Asmara, the capital of the province, the attention of the Ethiopian forces seems - more vigilanC and curfew is observed beginning at 1900 hours \"as a precautionary _ measure.\" This is a city which, in contrast to Massawa, hears no visible acars of the ~adr, but it is a city i:i~at ~las experien~ed suiP~ring. Uccu~ied militarily tiy the Mengistu troops and besienged by the Eritrean guerrillas, Asmara lived through a nightmare for a long time and is only now beginning to breathe again. Tlie \"pacification campaign,\" as it is called by the Addis Ababa government, has - at least achieved thiv initial result: in Eritrean cities, the people are learning - to live again. Maj Dawitt Wold~e Giorgis, who is in charge of the political sector in Eritrea, received me in Asmara. He makes himself very clear: \"One cannot make 'exceptions for Eritrea: provinces are equal in rights and duties. The principl'e \"e'~ciated in tHe program of the Ethiopian revolution, which establishes a certain ~ autonomy in internal affairs, is valid for all 14 provinces.\" This program ' specifies that \"each ethnic group will have the right to determine the content of political. economic and social life, to use its own language and elect its own leaders and administrators for internal entities.\" Up to now, only the linguistic c]:ause has been applied, but it is too soon to bring judgment since there is '~still a de facto cease-fire in effect. There is no agreement bet;aeen the warring �factioris and no guarantee that the fight will not start again. Nevertheless, _ d~spite Clie fragility of the truce, a step has been taken in the direction of peace, 'at ~Ieast in the political and psychological field. A\"pacification campaign\" - `i~eans ttiat the ~Addis Ababa government ha~ chosen the way of persuasion and not that of veng~:;ance and repression.

All provincial adminis- trators are Eritreans, and many Eritreans occupy positions of responsibility in the capital.\" A general amnesty has been proclaimed for repentant guerrillas, - who are sent to special rehabilitation centers where they receive politic~l training for. 2 or 3 months. They are tfien allowed to return to their families and normal life. We visited one of these centers in the vicinity of Asmara. The inmates are all quite young. They all declared themselves victims of distorted propaganda. Perhaps the presence of some COPWE members near me was a bit of a concern. - Even if the Eritrean question remains open and it is not right to draw hasty conclusions, we have a feeling, confirmed by shreds of witness account~ gathered here and there: the great majority of the popul~tion is tired from 20 years of war, death and destruction. Realism is prevailing over friendly feelings toward the guerrillas, who could even be sons, brothers or sisters. COPYRIGHT: 1981 Editoriale del \"Corriere della Sera\" s.a.s.

The British involved 3n prospecting have available to them the mass of documents which French, Portuguese and American firms had collected during earlier prospecting e.fforts. These firms in, fact recently agreed to hand over the documents in their possession to the Bissau Government. But oil is not Guinea-Bissau's only mineral resource. In fact, prospect3ng efforts are underway for bauxite deposits, with assistance from the USSR, and for phosphate, wi.th France's collaboration. In addition, it is anticipated that mining the bauxite deposits irt the southeastern - part of the country will involve building a dam on the Corrubal River for energy product3on and building an ore tanker port at Bulia which could be used jointly with Senegal, Mali and Guinea-Conakry. The reorganization of Guinea-Bissau`s economy, currently being studies in one of the committees formed after the coup, is an indication that the country Is going to try to profit more from its natural resources, particularly wood (20,000 tons in 1979) and fish, in order to improve its trade bala.nce, which showed a def icit of $45 million in 1979. ` COPYRIGHT: Rene Moreux et Cie.

The community had in fact nourished the most dire anxieties at the time when _ Uganda's Idi Amin llada bent his efforts to chasing out all nationals of Asiatic origin. It feared then that the contagion of xenophobia might spread into Kenya. .9sid in fact it was not far off the mark. While not suffering the prompt treatment that was practiced in Uganda, many Kenyan Indians in coimnerce and business did have to emigrate to Great Britain with their British passports, to yield place to the Africans, in the context of a degree of Africanization decreed by the late President Kenyatta. Shortly after assuming his duties and pursuant to the fall of the Ugandan , dictator, the new Kenyan president applied himself to beginning to reassure the Asiatics of his country, emphasizing the freedom he intended to allow for the establishment of businesses. Their departure, moreover, had harmful effects on the economy. So they returned, more confident, in a climate where tolerance once more reigned. One sees an example of this tolerance in the most recent legislative elections, _ where a deputy of Indian origin, M.K. Gautama, was elected in one of the districts ~ in the capital city (MTM of 7 December 1979, p 3407). The investments and technical aSSistance tha.t l~idia is going to bring to Kenya, as well as the cultural and - educational exchanges ta the two countries, will contribute still more to reassuring the local Indian community, for whom the President's trip to New Delhi will remain - a ma~or event.

There are indications from a well-informed Western source that activities of under- ground raembers of the National Resistance Movement (MRN) have picked up a eextain amount in intensity over the last few months. The result is to refute officizl al- 'l~gation,, aiiout its having been wiped out during a vast milit.~ry operation carried out last July in the mountainaus Sitaton~a massif (Manica Province) near the border - with Zimba~wP. ~ The road linking Beira to Maputo \"is not safe,\" and ~oods transport takes place unde.r the protertion of military convoys since ambushes are frequent. Similarly, the railway line between Beira and Chimoio has also lieen. subjected to recent at- tacks on the part of MRN members. Accordi.ng to news stories published in Johannesbur~;, the MRN claims thes~ days to = have about 10,000 \"we11 trained and well equipped\" guerrilla fighters. Since Ma~or Andre Matsangaisse's death (in July 1980 at the time of the raid by regular - Mozambican troops), these force~ are said to ~Se led by Messrs Afonso Jacamo, known - as Dhlakama, Raul Manuel Domingos, and Jose Domiiigos. In official circles in Mo2ambi:que it is asserted that the MRN is actively supported by South Africa which is said to have even set up traireing camps for this purpose in Transvaal Province. In addition, the good relations existing between Maputo and Moscow are apparent7.y not unanimously approved of within FRELIMO and ever~ within the cabinet. Persistent , rnmors are circulating in Maputo about divisions which are said to exist at the highest ]_evels of tha government regarding whether it is advisable to quarrel seri- ously with the United States by so vigorously denouncing the famous \"CIA plot.\" The United States has poured aroured $85 mill.ion 9nto Mozambique during the last 5 years ancl several officials are said to fear at present that Washington may \"cut off ~2~tozambique's means of subsistence'' to respond to the recent expulsion of American diplomats stationed in Ma.puto (C.F.

The minister was received twice by President. Seyni Kountche. Galley made the statement that their meeting dealt with the whole range of coopera- tion between the two countries, in particular the Kandadji dam project, the price of uranium, tlie decline of which he said was '~rorrying\" for France as well as for Niger, anci the development of Nigerien television. On the subject of ~he Ka.ndadji pr~ject, the usefulness of which was questioned ~ during the lenders meeting held in February in Niamey, Galley stressed that France continues to attach great importance to it. He said, \"France was committed to the Kandad~i dam from the start.
