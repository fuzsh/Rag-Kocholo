        "text": "Nine Columbus Crew SC players received a call-up from their respective national teams and are competing for their countries around the globe this week.\n\nThe players called-up include: defenders Harrison Afful (Ghana), Sergio Campbell (Jamaica) and Waylon Francis (Costa Rica); midfielders Kevan George (Trinidad and Tobago), Cedrick Mabwati (DR Congo), Justin Meram (Iraq), Ben Swanson (United States Under-20) and Wil Trapp (United States Under-23); and forward Kei Kamara (Sierra Leone).\n\n“A lot of theses guys have done a great job of putting themselves in position to get called-up,” Sporting Director and Head Coach Gregg Berhalter says. “It’s part of our recruiting process, we’re looking for good players. When you’re a good player, along with that comes international attention, and potentially, international call-ups. This is something we’ve been dealing with. We have a large selection of guys that are in these games, so it’s a good thing for the club.”\n\nCrew SC defender Harrison Afful was the first one in action on Tuesday, leading Ghana to a 3-2 victory as the Black Stars’ captain. Afful went the full 90 minutes in an entertaining friendly that saw Ghana and Congo exchange goals in added time. Next, Afful and the Black Stars will take on Rwanda in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.\n\nHere’s a running list of all Crew SC call-ups this week:\n\nTuesday, September 1\n\nHarrison Afful – Ghana vs. Congo – 3-2\n\nThursday, September 3\n\nJustin Meram – Iraq vs. Chinese Taipei (World Cup Qualifiers) – 5-1\n\nBen Swanson – United States U-20s at Serbia (Stevan Vilotic-Cele Tournament) – 1-3\n\nWil Trapp – United States U-23s at England – 0-1\n\nFriday, September 4\n\nBen Swanson – United States U-20s vs. France (Stevan Vilotic-Cele Tournament) – 1-6\n\nSergio Campbell – Jamaica vs. Nicaragua (World Cup Qualifiers) – 2-3\n\nKevan George – Trinidad & Tobago vs. Mexico – 3-3\n\nSaturday, September 5\n\nHarrison Afful – Ghana at Rwanda (Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier) – 1-0\n\nWaylon Francis – Costa Rica vs. Brazil – 0-1\n\nSunday, September 6\n\nCedrick Mabwati – DR Congo at Central African Republic (Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier) – 0-2\n\nKei Kamara – Sierra Leone vs. Ivory Coast (Africa Cup of Nations Qualifier) – 0-0\n\nMonday, September 7\n\nBen Swanson – United States U-20s vs. Israel (Stevan Vilotic-Cele Tournament) – 2-0\n\nTuesday, September 8\n\nSergio Campbell – Jamaica at Nicaragua (World Cup Qualifiers) – 2-0\n\nWaylon Francis – Costa Rica vs. Uruguay – 1-0\n\nJustin Meram – Iraq at Thailand (World Cup Qualifiers) – 2-2\n\nAfful, Campbell, Francis, George, Kamara, Mabwati, Meram, Swanson and Trapp are among a contingent of players from Sporting Director and Head Coach Gregg Berhalter’s squad to earn international call-ups in 2015, also including Kristinn Steindorsson (Iceland) and Romain Gall (United States U-20). Crew SC’s roster also features Jack McInerney and Michael Parkhurst (both United States) as well as Emanuel Pogatetz (Austria) with senior National Team call-ups."
