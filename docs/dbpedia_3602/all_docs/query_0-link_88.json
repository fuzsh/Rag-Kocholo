        "text": "Do you remember where you were in the summer of 2002? I was 12 years old, and I was about to complete my first year in secondary education at school.\n\nGrowing up with a so-called 'learning disability' in Romford - a small market town in the suburbs of north-east London - was a real challenge at times. I found it quite difficult, if not impossible to make any meaningful friends. Self-esteem did not come easy to me at all.\n\nWhat I did have, though, was an incredible desire to learn about a wide range of subjects. I excelled at mathematics and literacy (which probably explain's why Im such a stickler four grammar), but I was particularly fascinated with two things: computers and football.\n\n2002 was the year of the 17th FIFA World Cup, which was the first edition of international football's quadrennial premier competition to be staged in Asia. This was the first World Cup that I truly immersed myself into, even though most of the matches coincided with school.\n\nWhile France 1998 was my World Cup 'debut', I was very young back then and I was still learning about this wonderful sport. I don't think I even fully realised that a red card was a particularly bad thing to receive until that night when David Beckham petulantly kicked out at Argentina's Diego Simeone, sending England on their way to a typical penalty shoot-out defeat.\n\nThe 2002 World Cup would be particularly captivating to me, as it was hosted by South Korea and Japan - two exotic oriental countries that were considerably further away from me than my grandparents' home in Hornchurch. While I pored over all the team previews, I also endeavoured to learn more about the two host nations.\n\nPrior to the World Cup, I knew very little of South Korea, except that the red-and-blue circle on the national flag bore a rather striking resemblance to the Pepsi logo. I had rather more experience of Japanese culture, predominantly through anime TV series such as 'Pokémon' and 'Digimon'. I loved both those programmes whilst growing up, and those minor obsessions were only just beginning to wane by that golden summer.\n\nI've been a football fan for 20 years now, and as far as I am concerned, no World Cup before or since 2002 has delivered more excitement or drama. It began on 31 May, with Papa Bouba Diop and his Senegal team-mates - coached by the late Bruno Metsu - dancing to an incredible victory over holders France. The West Africans would eventually dance all the way to the Quarter Finals, where a Turkish own goal ended their incredible fairytale.\n\nAs for France, they returned home in disgrace, with more controversial Thierry Henry red cards to their name than goals. Argentina too were dumped out early, thanks in part to yet another match-defining moment from twinkle-toes striker Michael Owen, and a redemptive penalty from Beckham.\n\nDespite Kevin Keegan's shock resignation as manager after defeat in their first qualifier against Germany at the old Wembley Stadium, England went further in this World Cup than they had done four years previously. Under the guidance of suave Swede Sven-Göran Eriksson, the Three Lions breezed through Round 2 against a Denmark side who were so poor that even Emile Heskey scored against them.\n\nUnfortunately, we then came up against a magnificent Brazil team spearheaded by Ronaldinho, who could probably still bring David Seaman to tears 16 years after that free-kick. Granted, the buck-toothed magician was sent off just minutes later for nobbling Danny Mills, but I don't think he dwells on that in his sleep. Did Mills ever win the Champions League with Barcelona, or did he instead end up as one of the worst pundits on radio? I rest my case.\n\nOur near-neighbours from the Republic of Ireland also had a tournament to remember. Though captain Roy Keane decided that he'd rather spend his days walking his dog Triggs than working for professional Yorkshireman Mick McCarthy, Robbie Keane's last-minute penalty took the Irish to extra-time in their Round 2 match with Spain. It was just a shame that Robbie's compatriots weren't quite so prolific from 12 yards out.\n\nSoccer fans across the Atlantic discovered that the pinnacle of the beautiful game was not, as 'The Simpsons' might have led them to believe, a riot-inducing pass-fest between Portugal and Mexico. The United States of America - previously regarded by many foreigners as the international game's biggest laughing stocks - swept both those nations aside before running into the Michael Ballack-shaped wall that was Germany.\n\nWhile Japan petered out against Turkey, co-hosts South Korea enjoyed an incredible run of good fortune, particularly when it came to refereeing decisions. They reached the Quarters thanks to a golden goal from Ahn Jung-Hwan, though not before Italy had one disallowed themselves. Ahn would later be sacked by his Serie A club Perugia, because Italian football executives are renowned for being patient and forgiving.\n\nMore refereeing blunders would see South Korea eliminate Spain in the last eight, though nobody - not even the co-hosts - could have possibly denied Germany victory in the Semi Finals. The Mannschaft had progressed through the knockout rounds with surgical precision, ultimately booking a showdown with Brazil in Yokohama on 30 June.\n\nThere was to be no consolation bronze medal for the Koreans, who lost a five-goal thriller against fellow dark horses Turkey, having conceded to Hakan Sükür after just 11 seconds. Four years after Croatia's Davor Suker had lit up France 98, his near-namesake was also making headlines.\n\nBy the end of the tournament, though, there was only one name on everybody's lips: Ronaldo. The 25-year-old Brazilian striker dubbed 'O Fenômeno' may have been dogged by illness in his last World Cup Final appearance, but his second saw him rip Germany apart with a couple of second-half goals. Germany's usually reliable goalkeeper Oliver Kahn - voted the best player of the entire tournament - had reserved his worst performance of the tournament for the most vital game.\n\nLed by right-back and captain Cafú, Brazil lifted the World Cup for a record-breaking fifth time. They had demonstrated once again that while the English had invented modern football, only the boys from Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo had truly mastered it.\n\nSo, that was what happened in one of the greatest World Cup tournaments of all-time... but could it have been even better?\n\nWhat if we could go back in time to the summer of 2000, and rewrite two years of footballing history? What if Keegan never had his toilet-based breakdown at Wembley in October, and stayed on for a full World Cup qualifying campaign? Would King Kev have guided England to the tournament itself, and would he have fared any better than Sven?\n\nWould Ronaldo's old injury woes flare up again just when Brazil needed him most? Could Germany take advantage and go a step further than they did in reality? Would South Korea and Japan have enjoyed strong tournaments off their own bats instead of having to rely on questionable officiating?\n\nWhat about France and Argentina; could they have learned from past mistakes and returned to their former glories? Would Italy have celebrated a fourth World Cup triumph, four years ahead of schedule? Would the perennial bridesmaids from the Netherlands have even qualified this time, let alone won? And would Scotland have... no, of course they wouldn't!\n\nThat's where the power of my other big obsession - computers - comes into play. I have been into computer games and football for as long as I can remember, and Championship Manager (or Football Manager, as it's now known) is the perfect fusion of those two passions. You will be hard-pressed to find another PC gaming franchise that simulates the world of football more realistically than this (which could explain why nobody writes fan-fiction about FIFA Manager or Ultimate Soccer Manager anymore).\n\nI will be using Championship Manager: Season 00/01 - in my opinion, the best Championship Manager game of the CM3 era - to simulate the entire 2002 World Cup, from the first continental qualifiers to the end of the Final itself. Dreams will be revived or broken, new heroes and villains will be made, new underdogs may rise forward... heck, we might even get England vs Finland in the Final! (That really did happen to me in a previous save game, honest!)\n\nSo, would you care to join me on this journey back through time?\n\nQUALIFYING: HOW IT WORKS\n\nWe start off with an incredible 196 countries harbouring dreams of winning the FIFA World Cup - dreams that range from realistic (think teams such as Brazil and Italy) to so downright fanciful that not even Terry Pratchett would consider writing about them (Northern Ireland).\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone can take part at a World Cup, although governing body FIFA are trying their hardest to fit everyone in, \"for the love of the game\". This is the second tournament in a row with 32 finalists, following the post-1994 decision to expand from 24 teams.\n\n(Back in the future, FIFA have already drawn up plans to stage a 48-team World Cup in 2026, or maybe even as early as 2022. There really is hope for anyone. No, sorry... I don't mean you, Scotland.)\n\nThree places at the 2002 finals have already been taken up. Co-hosts Japan and South Korea are already through without having to qualify, which is probably just as well, considering how rubbish their teams were at France '98.\n\nAs the World Cup holders, France also got a bye into the finals stage. This means Les Bleus will have skipped the qualifying phases of the 2002, 1998 AND 1994 World Cups... or at least they wish they'd skipped 1994. (It is worth noting that the 2002 tournament was the last one where the defending champions didn't have to pre-qualify.)\n\nThat leaves room for another 29 teams to book their places in the biggest tournament international football has to offer. So, how do the qualifiers work?\n\nFIFA is made up of six continental federations - or confederations - covering every corner of the planet. Except Antarctica. They don't play football on Antarctica. Or at least they didn't when I last watched 'Pingu' as an eight-year-old.\n\nAnyway, every confederation gets a set number of qualification spots based on their size and stature. UEFA get a minimum of 13 places, while there are 5 for CAF, 4 for CONMEBOL, 3 for CONCACAF, and 2 for AFC, but sadly no automatic places for OFC. That frees up two more spots, which will be filled by the winners of Intercontinental Playoffs (more on those later).\n\nSo let's look at all the qualifying competition structures one-by-one, listed in the order they appear in-game:\n\nCAF (Africa)\n\n50 of CAF's 52 members entered the qualifying phase. However, there is some discrepancy from reality with regards to those who entered and those who did not. For instance, there's no sign of Equatorial Guinea or Somalia in the qualifiers, even though they were present and correct in reality, losing to The Congo and Cameroon in the first round respectively.\n\nNiger didn't enter the qualifying stages of the actual World Cup, but they are included in the virtual version alongside Burundi (who had withdrawn from the qualifiers at the last minute). Guinea also feature, despite their real-life expulsion from the second round due to \"government interference\" (FIFA does love that old chestnut).\n\nAnyway, the qualifying format is simple enough:\n\nRound 1\n\nAll 50 teams enter at this stage. They are each paired with another team for a two-legged knockout match, with both legs being played in April 2000. The winners go through; the losers go out.\n\nRound 2\n\nThe 25 opening-round winners are drawn into five groups of five. Every team plays their group opponents twice - at home and also away - meaning that they have eight games apiece. All matches take place between June 2000 and July 2001.\n\nAfter the group phase, the five group winners all qualify for the World Cup, with plenty of time to prepare for their Far Eastern exploits. All the other teams will have to stay at home.\n\nNow, there was a bug in CM99/00 - as well as the original version of CM00/01 - whereby all the highest-seeded teams in this round would go into Group 1, the next-best teams in Group 2, and so on. It was possible that you could have the likes of Cameroon, Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia clustered together in Group 1 fighting for one place, while a bunch of minnows scrapped for another in Group 5.\n\nThat bug made for some rather odd African World Cup qualifiers in unpatched games on CM99/00 and CM00/01. With the v3.89 patch installed, though, that shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAFC (Asia)\n\nExcluding co-hosts Japan and South Korea, there were 43 AFC members in-game, yet only 38 took part in the qualifiers. Afghanistan, Bhutan, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Yemen were all absent.\n\nCuriously, two nations who didn't compete in the real qualifiers - Myanmar and North Korea - changed their minds for the game. I hear that the North Koreans are very optimistic about their chances of success.\n\nRound 1\n\nAll 38 entrants come into the field here. They are split into 10 groups, which mostly consist of four teams apiece, although a couple only have three.\n\nAnyway, group opponents play each other once over the course of a little less than two months; the action starts on 6 May 2001 and ends on 24 June. Once that's settled, the 10 group winners advance to the next phase.\n\nRound 2\n\nThe 10 remaining teams are paired into two groups of five. Everyone in a group plays each other twice - home-and-away - over 10 consecutive weeks between September and November 2001. (There was no such thing as an official international match calendar back then.)\n\nThe group winners qualify for the World Cup, no further questions asked. However, the group runners-up must play each other in a single Playoff match, with the victors going through to an Intercontinental Playoff.\n\nCONCACAF (North & Central America & the Caribbean)\n\nWe've got 35 CONCACAF members in the game, and they are all present in the qualifiers. Guyana actually withdrew from their first qualifier in reality, but they get another chance here.\n\nIt's worth noting that the four strongest teams in CONCACAF - Jamaica, Mexico, the United States of America, and (ahem) Canada - progress straight to the Semi Final phase and don't have to negotiate the regional qualifiers.\n\nNow this is where things get a little complicated...\n\nCaribbean Zone\n\nThe Caribbean Zone (or the Carribean Zone, as it was erroneously spelt in-game) consists of 24 teams, who compete in three home-and-away knockout rounds.\n\nRound 1 takes place in March 2000, with the 24 teams paired up. The 12 winners then advance to...\n\n...Round 2, which is held in April. The winners of the six knockout ties in that round then continue to...\n\n...Round 3, in May. This time, the three winners qualify automatically for the Semi Finals, but it's not all over for the losers. Instead, they advance to the Interzone Playoff, which I'll get to in a bit. However, there's another zone I must look at first...\n\nCentral American Zone\n\nAs the name suggests, this zone features all the Central American countries - well, all of them except Honduras, who go straight into the Interzone Playoff.\n\nThe six teams are divided into two groups of three, with home-and-away matches being played between March and May 2000. The group winners progress to the Semi Finals, but the runners-up must enter the Interzone Playoff. There are no rewards for last place; it's game over.\n\nInterzone Playoff\n\nHonduras are joined in this phase by the three losers from Caribbean Zo... nope, sorry, Carribean Zone Round 3, and the two group runners-up from the Central American Zone.\n\nThe six teams are split into three knockout ties, with matches again being played home-and-away in June 2000. If you win, you're into the Semi Finals. If you lose, you're gone.\n\nSemi Finals\n\nWe now have our 12 Semi Finalists. Joining Canada, Jamaica, Mexico and the United States of America are three teams from the Caribbean, two teams from Central America, and another three from the Interzone Playoff.\n\nThere are three groups of four teams each. Everyone in a group plays each other twice, between July and November 2000. The top two in each group are rewarded with progression to the Final Round.\n\nFinal Round\n\nThe surviving six are paired into a single group (or a 'hexagonal', as I believe they call it back here in the 2010s). Everyone plays each other twice between March and November 2001.\n\nOnce the dust has settled, the top three teams in this concluding round qualify for the World Cup. The bottom three don't.\n\nUEFA (Europe)\n\nAh, the good ol' UEFA qualifiers. They hardly ever change, do they?\n\nFrance are automatically through to the World Cup as holders, which leaves the other 50 UEFA members having to battle it out for between 13 and 14 qualification berths.\n\nYes, you read that right. Almost half the World Cup field will be from Europe - a curiosity that dates to when the tournament was almost exclusively European/South American. Things have been slightly tweaked somewhat in subsequent World Cups to benefit countries from other continents, but that increased diversity wasn't in place come 2002.\n\nGroup Stage\n\nOur 50 European nations are divided into nine groups. There are five groups consisting of six teams, and another four groups consisting of only five.\n\nYou know the drill now. It's home-and-away matches all the way, from September 2000 to October 2001.\n\nThe nine group winners automatically progress to the World Cup finals, while the runners-up progress to a playoff round. One of these 2nd-placed teams is chosen at random to go into an Intercontinental Playoff. (In the actual World Cup qualifiers, the Republic of Ireland got this gig, and travelled to Iran for a game. Lucky them.)\n\nPlayoffs\n\nAs for the eight other UEFA runners-up, they are simply paired with one another to contest two-legged playoff matches in November 2001. The four winners earn their tickets to the World Cup, while their vanquished opponents are left dreaming of what could've been.\n\nOFC (Oceania)\n\nSpare a thought for the OFC; they are regarded as so weak and insignificant that they don't even have an automatic place at the World Cup. Only one of their teams will get so much as an Intercontinental Playoff - and if that team isn't either Australia or New Zealand, then it'll go down as one of the biggest shocks in international football history.\n\n10 of the 12 OFC members entered these qualifiers. New Caledonia (the birthplace of 1998 World Cup winner Christian Karembeu) and Papua New Guinea (the inspiration for a 90s dance classic by 'The Future Sound of London') did not, either in-game or in reality.\n\nGroup Stage\n\nThe 10 teams are divided into two groups of five teams. Unfortunately for everyone else, the Aussies and Kiwis are kept apart.\n\nEvery team plays each of their group opponents twice (as opposed to just once, which was the case in reality). Matches are all played in one host city - Wellington for Group 1, and Melbourne for Group 2 - over the course of about four weeks between January and early February 2001.\n\nOnly the group winners advance further in the competition. Somehow, I'm not expecting them to be American Samoa and Samoa.\n\nFinal\n\nWith just two teams left, the natural thing to do is to pit them against each other. This 'Home and Away' tie (please excuse the obvious Aussie soap pun) takes place in August 2001, and the winners over two legs qualify for the Wor... no, wait, they don't. Like I said, they'll have to get through the Intercontinental Playoffs first.\n\nCONMEBOL (South America)\n\nCONMEBOL is the smallest of FIFA's confederations in terms of size, with only 10 member nations. They have the simplest - and arguably the most democratic - qualification system for the World Cup.\n\nAll 10 countries go into a big league-style competition, where they must play one another home-and-away. That's 18 matches per team, for the benefit for those of you who slept through maths classes at school. I didn't, obviously.\n\nThis is an elongated process, beginning in March 2000 and ending in November 2001. At the end of it, the top four teams qualify for the World Cup, and the bottom five are knocked out. But what about that odd team out in 5th place? Well, their journey's not quite over...\n\nIntercontinental Playoffs\n\nThe Intercontinental Playoffs - staged in early December 2001 - determine which teams get the final two places at the World Cup. Four teams enter this phase, and just to remind you, those teams are:\n\nThe winners of the AFC Playoff round.\n\nA randomly-chosen UEFA group runner-up.\n\nThe winners of the OFC qualifiers.\n\nThe 5th-placed team in the CONMEBOL qualifiers.\n\nA random draw is held to decide who plays who in these Playoffs. Once again, they are home-and-away affairs, with the winners finally booking their spots at the World Cup. Only now can they relax... for about six months, anyway\n\n4 MARCH 2000\n\nAnd so it begins. To misquote the only palatable song in Aqua's catalogue, we have \"turned back time\".\n\nThe world in 2000 is very different from the world in 2018. There are charismatic left-wing leaders in 10 Downing Street and the White House. There are dictatorships in Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Manchester United.\n\nThe BBC is a reputable broadcaster, and some people occasionally watch Channel 5. The Internet is only just beginning to catch on, and social media is not a thing, which means disgruntled Arsenal fans don't have a place where they can secretly wish ill upon Arsène Wenger.\n\n\"Pure Shores\" by All Saints (think Little Mix, except these women actually wear clothes) is the best-selling single in the UK. \"Amazed\" by country band Lonestar tops the Billboard Hot 100 in the USA, and is played almost non-stop in the Fuller family car (thanks, Mum). \"Candle In The Wind 1997\" is probably still the number 1 single in Canada.\n\nOh yeah, and England's footballers tend to choke at tournaments. Well, some things never change...\n\nToday, just 830 days before the FIFA World Cup officially kicks off in the Far East, the qualifying phase gets underway with the first leg of Caribbean Zone Round 1. Note that I wrote Caribbean. I'm not going to put up with Sports Interactive's misspelling anymore. That's their problem, not mine.\n\n[Checks that I didn't misspell 'misspelling'.] Yep, I'm good...\n\nBefore I go any further, there are a couple of things I need to clarify.\n\nFirstly, in CM00/01, it is not possible to start a game in March 2000, as that was technically last season (that's what Championship Manager: Season 99/00 covers). That means I cannot jump into a save game where certain World Cup qualifiers haven't already been played.\n\nThe earliest date I can start a CM00/01 game on is 17 June 2000 - the default start date for the Polish leagues. Any World Cup qualifiers scheduled before that date are simulated automatically, but there are no fully-detailed reports for said games. Therefore, any summaries I write for matches prior to 17 June will be much shorter than for subsequent fixtures.\n\nSecondly, you'll notice that I said there were 830 days until the opening match. If CM followed reality, the first fixture would be played on 31 May 2002, which is only 818 days from now. However, for some reason, we're kicking off this tournament on 12 June - almost a fortnight later. Feel free to insert your own joke about Southampton being late starters (or, from a 2017/2018 perspective, Crystal Palace).\n\nNow that's all sorted, let's have a look at the draw:\n\nCONCACAF Caribbean Zone Round 1\n\nDraw\n\nNetherlands Antilles vs Cayman Islands\n\nBarbados vs Cuba\n\nSt Lucia vs Anguilla\n\nBahamas vs St Vincent & The Grenadines\n\nHaiti vs Grenada\n\nAntigua & Barbuda vs Montserrat\n\nPuerto Rico vs Trinidad & Tobago\n\nBermuda vs Guyana\n\nSt Kitts & Nevis vs Aruba\n\nUS Virgin Islands vs Surinam\n\nDominican Republic vs British Virgin Islands\n\nDominica vs Turks & Caicos Islands\n\nThere are a few interesting ties there, not least Haiti vs Grenada. If youngster Jason Roberts can replicate his fine scoring form for Bristol Rovers on the international stage, he might just pull Grenada through. Antigua & Barbuda will be red-hot favourites to defeat Montserrat, who apparently have one of the worst national teams in the world.\n\nFurther down the draw, there's an intriguing 'battle of the strikers' between Bermuda's Shaun Goater and Guyana's Carl Cort. Manchester United ace Dwight Yorke should fire Trinidad & Tobago to a comfortable win against Puerto Rico, and Surinam will surely have too much quality for the US Virgin Islands.\n\nLeg 1 Results\n\nAntigua & Barbuda - 0\n\nMontserrat - 1 (J Mendes 41)\n\nThis match was played at Viv Richards' Stadium, but it was his fellow Antiguans who were hit over the boundary line here. A goal on the stroke of half-time from Dunfermline's Junior Mendes decided the match and put Montserrat on course for the next round.\n\nBahamas - 0\n\nSt Vincent & The Grenadines - 1 (R Jack 83)\n\nJulian Joachim might have been named 'man of the match' for St Vincent, but it was Crewe icon Rodney Jack who won the first leg late on. The Bahamas had striker Liburd Hercules sent off just before full-time, presumably for failing his 12th labour and letting the (multi-headed) dog out. Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.\n\nBarbados - 1 (G Goodridge 57)\n\nCuba - 0\n\nIt was a good day for Greg Goodridge. The Bristol City right-winger's goal was crucial in earning Barbados a narrow first-leg victory over Cuba. Fidel Castro won't have been too chuffed with that result, so expect repercussions if the Leones del Caribe can't win their home leg convincingly.\n\nBermuda - 0\n\nGuyana - 0\n\nThis was a bore draw in which neither side managed more than a single shot on target. Bermuda couldn't feed Shaun 'The Goat' Goater, and the Manchester City hotshot didn't score. The game's big talking-point came in the 71st minute, when Goater's compatriot Daran Corry was dismissed for two bookable offences.\n\nDominica - 1 (D Pugh 76)\n\nTurks & Caicos Islands - 0\n\nI once saw a darts player named Darrin Pugh record a pitiful average score of 51 points per visit in a match that was televised on Sky Sports. An obscure reference, I know. At least his near-namesake Dane Pugh was rather more clinical for Dominica. A goal at the back end of the second half saw his country take a narrow lead going into the second leg.\n\nDominican Republic - 0\n\nBritish Virgin Islands - 2 (B McIntyre 34, N Willetts 82)\n\nThe Dominican Republic should stick to baseball. They suffered a shock 2-0 home defeat to the British Virgin Islands, who had Darron Sampson sent off after just 11 minutes. Goals in either half from Bryn McIntyre and Norton Willetts turned the tie around for Richard Branson's favourite national team.\n\nHaiti - 1 (S Parra 5)\n\nGrenada - 0\n\nWhat's the point of bringing Monaco ace Wagneau Eloi over from France when a greyed-out right-back can score for you? That was what Haiti were asking themselves when Salim Parra took just five minutes to break the deadlock against Grenada, who couldn't muster a single shot on target.\n\nNetherlands Antilles - 1 (F Hernandez 74)\n\nCayman Islands - 1 (W Allison 16)\n\nThe Cayman Islands went 1-0 up after just over a quarter of an hour, thanks to Wayne Allison (of Huddersfield and Tranmere fame). However, the Netherlands Antilles salvaged a draw through Ferdino Hernandez (Remember him, Wigan fans? Thought not). This was a particularly surprising result, as the hosts had both captain Raymond Victoria and midfielder Marthijn van de Broek sent off.\n\nPuerto Rico - 0\n\nTrinidad & Tobago - 1 (S John 54)\n\nIn the city of San Juan, it was Stern John who saved Trinidad & Tobago from an embarrassing draw against Puerto Rico. However, the Soca Warriors would have to go into the home leg without midfielder Lynden Andrews, who was sent off late on.\n\nSt Kitts & Nevis - 1 (C Willock 85)\n\nAruba - 0\n\nNo, that isn't Chris Willock who scored that late winner for St Kitts & Nevis. For one thing, he's only two years old. Instead, it was Fulham teenager Callum Willock who condemned Aruba to defeat. I hope Joan Armatrading's Kittitian compatriots showed Callum some love and affection afterwards.\n\nSt Lucia - 1 (K Sellars 11)\n\nAnguilla - 0\n\nHmm, the 1-0 scoreline sure is popular today. Midfielder Kerry Sellars bought the St Lucians an invaluable first-leg goal versus little-known Anguilla. Kudos to Barnet's defensive rock Warren Hackett for helping his team preserve a clean sheet.\n\nUS Virgin Islands - 0\n\nSurinam - 1 (R Sion 10)\n\nAnd there we have it again. One goal was all Surinam could muster, with Romano Sion of Portuguese side Vitória claiming the plaudits. It remains to be seen whether it'll be enough, or if the American board-game geeks can save themselves in South America.\n\n5 MARCH 2000\n\nSo, that's the first day of World Cup qualifiers over and done with. Have you enjoyed the ride so far?\n\nYes? Well, let's crack on. / No? Don't worry; it'll get better. [Delete where appropriate]\n\nThe Caribbean sides have showcased their talents (or, in some cases, lack thereof), so now let's look at what Central America has to offer.\n\nJust to remind you, there are seven Central American nations in the qualifiers, and we'll see six of them here - Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama. The odd nation out are Honduras, who are apparently so good that they get to go straight to the Interzone Playoff round.\n\nThe six teams are divided into two groups of three, and every team plays their group rivals on a home-and-away basis. The group winners are fast-tracked to the Semi Finals, and the runners-up are moved to the Interzone Playoffs. The stragglers must stay behind and watch the others from afar.\n\nCONCACAF Central American Zone\n\nGroup Draw\n\nGROUP 1:Belize, Costa Rica, Guatemala\n\nThere's no doubting which team is odds-on to win this group. Costa Rica might have only graced the World Cup once before (in 1990, officially the greatest year of all-time), but Paulo Wanchope's comrades should go through comfortably.\n\nGROUP 2:El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama\n\nGroup 2 looks like this will be a two-way battle between El Salvador and Panama, who - coincidentally - play each other in the opening match. Nicaragua are traditionally Central America's whipping boys and will do well to even get a Playoff place.\n\nGroup 1 Result\n\nCosta Rica - 3 (P Wanchope 16, R Gomez 17,pen86)\n\nGuatemala - 1 (M Machon 15)\n\nWe had three goals in three minutes! Firstly, Martin Machon arrived from Miami to grab an early opener for Guatemala. Paulo Wanchope and Ronald Gomez then turned the tie on its head before Gomez - the one who didn't play for West Ham - sealed a 3-1 Costa Rican win from the penalty spot.\n\nGroup 2 Result\n\nEl Salvador - 1 (R Diaz Arce pen58)\n\nPanama - 3 (R Bello 5, J Dely Valdés 59, JC Dely Valdés 71)\n\nPANAMA! took just five minutes to break the deadlock through the brilliant, if very grey Rayco Bello. Raul Diaz Arce drew El Salvador level from the spot, but the Dely Valdés twins - Jorge and Julio César - then bagged a goal apiece to take the points back to the 'Puente del Mundo'.\n\n18 MARCH 2000\n\nAfter a fortnight's break, it's time for the Caribbean nations to get back to business. By the end of today, 12 countries will be safely through to Round 2 of the Caribbean Zone qualifiers. A dozen others will see their dreams of World Cup glory burnt to ashes right here.\n\nNow... the last time I covered the Caribbean Zone, you might have read that I'd referred to some 'greyed-out players', or 'greys' for short. In that case, I wasn't referring to Gary Lineker's hair, or even David Platt's personality.\n\nIn Championship Manager, teams that don't have enough real players in the database are usually populated with computer-generated players, who can't be signed by other clubs and generally have as much footballing talent as Ali Dia. They will disappear from the game when 'actual' players join the team and are re-generated when those 'actual' players leave. In-game, their names appear in grey font, hence the tag.\n\nThe CM00/01 database has approximately 90,000 people (players, staff, referees, etc), compared to around 600,000 in the database for Football Manager 2018. Most national teams don't have enough real players to complete their squads, hence the need for 'greys' to fill in the vacancies.\n\nThe limited national pools also have an impact on the generated names of some grey players. If there aren't enough names to choose from in a certain nation, CM will often come up with generic names based on the that nation's main language. For example, grey players from Aruba and Surinam get generic Dutch names, while greys from the British Virgin Islands and most other Caribbean nations get English names.\n\nFor some countries, the game will just select any old names at random, regardless of language. When we start looking at Myanmar, for example, you can expect their players to have all sorts of jumbled-up names that don't fit well (e.g. Ji-Sung McDonald, or Mehmet Khumalo, or Hasney Aljofree).\n\nSo that's what I mean when I write about grey players. Their names might seem out of place in some areas, but they're a necessary evil in the earlier CM games.\n\nCONCACAF Caribbean Zone Round 1\n\nLeg 2 Results\n\nAnguilla - 2 (C Coynes 8, C Westwood 66)\n\nSt Lucia - 0\n\n[Anguilla win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nWho'd have thought it? St Lucia have fallen to the mighty Anguilla! Chick Coynes levelled the tie just eight minutes into the second half, but it was right-winger Che Westwood who made sure that he got the adulation of Anguilla's most eligible bachelorettes.\n\nAruba - 0\n\nSt Kitts & Nevis - 1 (B Bowry 13)\n\n[St Kitts & Nevis win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nAnother single-goal win suited the Kittitians to the ground, with Bobby Bowry the hero on this occasion as they went through at Aruba's expense. That's a shame. I had written all sorts of witty remarks about John Fashanu's catchphrase from 'Gladiators', but now they'll go to waste...\n\nBritish Virgin Islands - 0\n\nDominican Republic - 1 (EJ Espinal 9)\n\n[British Virgin Islands win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nIt was just as well that Branson's boys had won the first leg by two goals. The Dominican Republic were on the verge of turning things around when 17-year-old Elpys José Espinal halved the deficit after just nine minutes. However, Dominican defender Gavin Wild got a little too wild in the 22nd minute, and his team weren't able to equalise without him.\n\nCayman Islands - 1 (W Allison 23)\n\nNetherlands Antilles - 1 (S Huizing 21)\n\n[2-2 on aggregate, Netherlands Antilles win 3-1 on penalties]\n\nA missed penalty from Jamie Wood in the second minute was an ominous sign for the Cayman Islands. The hosts fought out another 1-1 draw after Wayne Allison cancelled out Sandor Huizing's Dutch Antillean opener. However, it was the boys from Curacao who ultimately took the spoils in a shoot-out.\n\nCuba - 0\n\nBarbados - 0\n\n[Barbados win 1-0 on aggregate]\n\nI fear we might have another Cuban missile crisis on our hands. The Leones del Caribe survived 16 shots from Barbados (and their star performer Emmerson Boyce) without conceding, but they couldn't claw back the deficit from the first leg. The Bajans will dance on.\n\nGrenada - 1 (J Roberts 1)\n\nHaiti - 2 (E Bakadal 11, L Risso 79)\n\n[Haiti win 3-1 on aggregate]\n\nA goal in the first minute was as good as it got for Grenada frontman Jason Roberts - the 22-year-old nephew of the great Cyrille Regis. Haitian greys Eugène Bakadal and Ladislas Risso retaliated in style, ensuring that at least one half of Hispaniola would be represented in Round 2.\n\nGuyana - 1 (C Cort 61)\n\nBermuda - 0\n\n[Guyana win 1-0 on aggregate]\n\nMrs Cort must be immensely proud of her sons. While Leon Cort marshalled Guyana's defence superbly, his big brother Carl went up the other end and scored the decisive goal after just over an hour. Sadly, Shaun Goater had to return home to Manchester on an empty stomach.\n\nMontserrat - 1 (J Mendes 6)\n\nAntigua & Barbuda - 1 (K Lwando 28)\n\n[Montserrat win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nWho said that Montserrat were nobodies on the international stage? Junior Mendes bolstered their aggregate lead early on in Plymouth (which, incidentally, is nowhere near Devon). Kim Lwando's retaliatory strike was not enough for Antigua & Barbuda, who will now get back to drawing new Flintstones cartoons.\n\nSt Vincent & The Grenadines - 1 (J Joachim 16)\n\nBahamas - 1 (T Sheringham 63)\n\n[St Vincent & The Grenadines win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nThe Bahamas might have given us the soundtrack to this summer, but they haven't given us any great footballers. Julian Joachim effectively secured St Vincent's place in Round 2, though the visitors did get a consolation goal through Tom Sheringham, who bore a striking resemblance to a certain Manchester United forward. Andy Cole wasn't available for comment.\n\nSurinam - 1 (J Temmink 35)\n\nUS Virgin Islands - 0\n\n[Surinam win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nJimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Clarence Seedorf, Gus Uhlenbeek... you can now add Johan Temmink's name to the list of Surinam-born football legends. He burst forward from defence to drive in the goal that sent 11 sweatpants-wearing Star Trek aficionados retreating to their parents' attics.\n\nTrinidad & Tobago - 2 (D Yorke 48,52)\n\nPuerto Rico - 0\n\n[Trinidad & Tobago win 3-0 on aggregate]\n\nRenowned ladies' man Ricky Martin might have sung the 1998 classic 'The Cup of Life', but Puerto Rico's World Cup dreams are dead. A couple of early second-half goals from Manchester United's Dwight Yorke ensured that Trinidad & Tobago sailed through to the next stage.\n\nTurks & Caicos Islands - 0\n\nDominica - 0\n\n[Dominica win 1-0 on aggregate]\n\nThis wasn't a classic by any means, but Dominica's fans didn't mind, for they were celebrating an aggregate win come full-time. That said, they weren't exactly pleased when defender Leon Gayle picked up two bookings and left his 10 team-mates holding on for the final 25 minutes or so.\n\n19 MARCH 2000\n\nAfter the storm of yesterday's Caribbean qualifiers, today sees the relative calm of the Central American preliminaries. We've got just two matches to cover as the group stage enters its second round.\n\nCosta Rica and Panama won the opening group ties, but they've got the day off. Instead, Guatemala and El Salvador are attempting to bounce straight back following their defeats on 5 March.\n\nGroup 2 sees El Salvador travel to Nicaragua, which is a less daunting journey now than it was about a decade or two ago. Meanwhile, Guatemala are at home to Group 1 rivals Belize - the only country to lend their name to a Blondie song. \"Oh Belize doo-be-do, I'm in love with you, Belize doo-be-do...\"\n\nCONCACAF Central American Zone\n\nGroup 1 Result\n\nGuatemala - 1 (MA Martínez Lara 11)\n\nBelize - 1 (L Campagna 19)\n\nThere were no winners in the battle of the regional minnows. Marco Antonio Martínez Lara drew first blood for Guatemala after 11 minutes, only to see Lil Campagna equalise within eight minutes. If Belize had brought Big Campagna along as well, they might have eked out a win.\n\nGROUP 1 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

The DC United striker was the embodiment of coolness during a 12-minute spell that overwhelmed Nicaragua. He was then joined on the scoresheet by Victor Dubon, who plays for FC Jazz in Finland.

Now it's time to see for the first time what Africa's finest are capable of.\n\nWhile nations from UEFA and CONMEBOL are still dominating international football, CAF looks like the confederation most likely to challenge the old world order. Pelé once predicted that an African nation would win the World Cup by the year 2000, and though the great Brazilian proved to be as accurate as Nostradamus, there's no doubt that the continent's teams are improving year-on-year.\n\nTo date, current African Cup of Nations champions Cameroon are the only team from the continent to have reached the World Cup Quarter Finals, doing so in 1990. The Indomitable Lions also qualified for the finals in 1994 and 1998, and they might well enjoy another decent run in South Korea and Japan in 2002... provided they qualify, of course.\n\nThe other four African representatives from France '98 - Morocco, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia - are also confident of qualifying again. Nigeria looked very strong when co-hosting the ACN with Ghana earlier this year, ultimately losing the Final on penalties to Cameroon.\n\nGhana haven't yet qualified for a World Cup, but they are amongst several African nations with realistic hopes of doing so this time around. You can also put Senegal in that bracket. In real life, the Lions of Teranga went on to emulate Cameroon's class of Italia '90 by reaching the last eight of Korea/Japan 2002. Who's to say they can't do that in-game as well?\n\nAnother team that will be worth looking out for is Liberia. That, of course, is the home of current Chelsea loanee George Weah, who twice won the Serie A scudetto with Milan and was the first African to receive the Ballon d'Or in 1995.\n\n33-year-old Weah is currently ranked alongside the likes of George Best, Alfredo Di Stefano and Nigel Spink as one of the greatest footballers never to have played at a World Cup. Can he and his fellow Liberians change that?\n\nLet's quickly remind you of how the CAF qualifiers work. Round 1 sees the 50 entrants paired with one another in home-and-away knockout matches. Obviously, there are seedings in place, so that the top nations can't knock each other out. That said, not even the likes of Cameroon and Nigeria can afford too many mistakes, else they'll be eliminated early.\n\nThe 25 winners from Round 1 progress to the group phase that is Round 2. I'll have more on that round closer to the time, but let's get these opening matches out of the way first, shall we?\n\nCAF Round 1\n\nDraw\n\nMalawi vs Zimbabwe\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo vs Swaziland\n\nEgypt vs Djibouti\n\nEritrea vs Ivory Coast\n\nBurkina Faso vs Morocco\n\nGhana vs Mauritius\n\nAngola vs Cape Verde Islands\n\nMauritania vs Togo\n\nLiberia vs Seychelles\n\nSierra Leone vs Benin\n\nBurundi vs Gabon\n\nZambia vs Mali\n\nTanzania vs Namibia\n\nGuinea-Bissau vs Sudan\n\nNiger vs Cameroon\n\nSenegal vs São Tomé & Príncipe\n\nAlgeria vs Chad\n\nSouth Africa vs Botswana\n\nRwanda vs The Congo\n\nMozambique vs Madagascar\n\nLesotho vs Gambia\n\nGuinea vs Nigeria\n\nCentral African Republic vs Kenya\n\nLibya vs Ethiopia\n\nTunisia vs Uganda\n\nPredictably, we've got a lot of very one-sided matches in this round. Egypt and the Ivory Coast will be particularly pleased with their draws, both against minnows from the Horn of Africa. Morocco might have to do a bit more work to get past Burkina Faso, and similarly, Angola are unlikely to have things all their own way versus the Cape Verde Islands.\n\nContinental champions Cameroon have a nice, simple warm-up against Niger, even though the Ménas are only a couple of letters away from being remotely threatening. Senegal's push towards a debut appearance has been hindered by the fact they have to play against not just São Tomé, but also their neighbours Príncipe. Zambia vs Mali looks like a pick 'em match-up.\n\nWhile Senegal have to play against 22 men, Algeria only need to get past one bloke - named Chad - to qualify for Round 2. South Africa and Tunisia will also be thanking their lucky stars that they got simple draws, but Nigeria won't. The Super Eagles' opening opponents Guinea are blessed with some half-decent players... and Titi Camara of West Ham.\n\nLeg 1 Results\n\nAlgeria - 1 (F Ghazi 90)\n\nChad - 0\n\nAlgeria put in a strong performance against future American football star Chad Pennington, yet it took them almost exactly 90 minutes to break the deadlock. Troyes striker Farid Ghazi - one of goodness knows how many French-based players in the Fennecs' squad - was the late hero.\n\nAngola - 1 (Quinzinho 70)\n\nCape Verde Islands - 0\n\nQuinzinho was quids in for Angola, securing them a first-leg victory after 70 minutes. The Cape Verde Islands would go into their home leg a goal down, and a man light. Left-winger Mirandinha - or 'Little Miranda', if you prefer - was sent off in the 78th minute.\n\nBurkina Faso - 0\n\nMorocco - 4 (S Bassir 1, A Elkhattabi 31,33,79)\n\nAs soon as Salaheddine Bassir scored for Morocco in the very first minute, Burkina Faso knew that they were in trouble. Sure enough, Ali Elkhattabi - the man from Sparta in Rotterdam - put three more goals past the Stallions, who also lost defender Cyriaque Razurel to a red card.\n\nBurundi - 0\n\nGabon - 3 (T Nguema 14,70, A Ossey 56)\n\nThere was a time when Burundi didn't produce a couple of semi-decent players once in a generation. This was well before Saido Berahino and Gaël Bigirimana's time. Gabon's Theodore Nguema (who curiously shares his name with the long-time President of Equatorial Guinea) scored a brace either side of a goal from Armand Ossey. The visitors are surely heading into the next phase.\n\nCentral African Republic - 1 (Malet 81)\n\nKenya - 1 (Valdo 43)\n\nKenya defender Musa Otieno was sent off in the 35th minute, but compatriot Valdo scored just eight minutes later. Central African Republic tried something similar in the second half. Luciano Ray Djim was dismissed early on, paving the way for Malet to hammer in an equaliser nine minutes from time.\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo - 0\n\nSwaziland - 0\n\nSwaziland (or should that be eSwatini?) is a country more renowned for long-reigning kings with hundreds of heirs than for football. Mind you, they did record a creditable goalless draw against DR Congo in Kinshasa. The 'man of the match' award went to Congolese defender Nzelo Lembi, but don't ask me why.\n\nEgypt - 2 (R Yasser 34, AS Hosny 75)\n\nDjibouti - 0\n\nThere were no shocks in Cairo, with German-based stars Radwan Yasser and Ahmed Salah Hosny making light work of Djibouti. However, the hosts' fiery 18-year-old striker Mohamed Zidan would later be dismissed, apparently for butting an opponent in the stomach. My money was on Jean-Marc Prat being the victim... or Marco Materazzi, if he's somehow obtained a Djiboutian passport.\n\nEritrea - 0\n\nIvory Coast - 1 (I Bakayoko 88)\n\nIf you played Championship Manager in the late 1990s, you'll surely know all about Ibrahima Bakayoko. The iconic ex-Everton striker scored a belated winner for the Ivory Coast against plucky Eritrea, whose resistance finally cracked shortly after winger Shawn Lilwall was sent off.\n\nGhana - 2 (E Tetteh 37, A Nyarko 88)\n\nMauritius - 3 (JM Ithier 22,74, E Rowley 28)\n\nGoals from Emmanuel Tetteh and Alex Nyarko were not enough to save Ghana from a shock defeat to 10-man Mauritius. Jean Marc Ithier bagged a brace for Les Dodos, and captain Ellis Rowley also found the net, though he would soon follow that up with a red card.\n\nGuinea - 1 (Tawel Camara 5)\n\nNigeria - 1 (Aliyu 7)\n\nTawel Camara (no relation to Titi) was on target for the hosts after a mere five minutes. Sadly for him, Aliyu drew Nigeria level shortly afterwards. Guinea striker Souleymane Oulare didn't take that disappointment well, as he was sent off in the 26th minute. Despite that, his compatriots held firm for a 1-1 draw, and put the Super Eagles under real pressure going into the second leg.\n\nGuinea-Bissau - 0\n\nSudan - 1 (M Al-Owairain 11)\n\nYou'll probably remember that goal from Saudi Arabia's Saeed Al-Owairan at USA 1994. Well, his Sudanese knock-off Mohammed Al-Owairain also scored a tremendous World Cup strike, which put Guinea-Bissau's hopes of making the finals in serious jeopardy.\n\nLesotho - 0\n\nGambia - 3 (J Ceesay 20,30, Ebou Sillah 29)\n\nThe Gambia could have selected teen sensation Cherno Samba, but they clearly didn't need him here. Jatto Ceesay's double and Ebou Sillah's strike - all secured within 10 minutes - left Lesotho in a spot of bother. Their left-winger Roland Addicoat got his coat early after being sent off in the 66th minute.\n\nLiberia - 1 (J Nagbe 59)\n\nSeychelles - 0\n\nLiberia's superstar captain George Weah was the main attraction, but he was upstaged by someone who played for Panionios in Greece. Take a bow, defensive midfielder Joe Nagbe, whose strike before the hour mark earned a narrow win over the Seychelles.\n\nLibya - 0\n\nEthiopia - 1 (A Enge 31)\n\nI don't think we'll be seeing too many of Libya's players again after this performance. Khalid Tadrus might well have feared for his life after his red card in the 15th minute. Another quarter-hour later, Afsin Enge's goal sent Ethiopia one step closer to a place in Round 2.\n\nMalawi - 0\n\nZimbabwe - 1 (P Ndlovu 33)\n\nFans of Coventry and Birmingham will testify that Peter Ndlovu is rather decent for a striker. He certainly lived up to expectations for his native Zimbabwe, with a 33rd-minute goal seeing off Malawi. However, a late red card for away midfielder Kennedy Chihuri could well have boosted Malawi's chances of a comeback.\n\nMauritania - 0\n\nTogo - 2 (K Agboh 45, B Salou 48)\n\nTogo looked in fine fettle as they began their quest to qualify for a maiden World Cup. Kwami Agboh's opener on the stroke of half-time was complemented by an early first-half goal from Bachirou Salou. It could well be all over for Mauritania already.\n\nMozambique - 1 (Dário 51)\n\nMadagascar - 0\n\nMadagascar face a real battle if they're to progress any further. Mozambique took a narrow lead after the first leg through Dário - a fresh-faced 23-year-old striker from Académica. Ironically, a 38-year-old Dário was the oldest goalscorer at the FIFA World Championship in one of my other CM/FM universes!\n\nNiger - 1 (A Lambo Zakari 6)\n\nCameroon - 3 (P Mbomba 2, R Douala 6,88)\n\nNiger striker Andrey Lambo Zakari now knows - you don't equalise against Cameroon. He did it shortly after Patrick Mbomba had given the Indomitable Lions an early lead, but Rudolph Douala restored Cameroon's advantage within seconds. Douala then added another goal for good measure.\n\nRwanda - 1 (D Mbonabucya 12)\n\nThe Congo - 0\n\nThis hasn't been a good day for either Congo. The Brazzaville Congo fell behind to an early Rwandan goal from Desiré Mbonabucya, and then had captain Shabani Nonda sent off before succumbing to defeat. They probably wish that Nonda had opted to play for Burundi instead.\n\nSenegal - 1 (L Sakho 77)\n\nSão Tomé & Príncipe - 1 (Jairson 58)\n\nI would call this a surprise, though to be fair, Senegal did have to play against two separate countries. Coentro Joaquim was sent off for São Tomé before Jairson gave Príncipe the lead. Future Leeds goal machine Lamine Sakho then levelled for Senegal. No, hang on a minute - that was the surprise.\n\nSierra Leone - 0\n\nBenin - 0\n\nIf I told you that Kanu had played a blinder, you'd probably reply, \"But Chris, you've done the Nigeria game already!\" Ah, but I'm talking about Mohammed Kanu - the Cercle Brugge and Sierra Leone defender. It was largely thanks to him that the Leone Stars ground out a stalemate against Benin.\n\nSouth Africa - 1 (B McCarthy 23)\n\nBotswana - 0\n\nSouth Africa bombarded Botswana with shots, but their only goal came from a svelte, cool-headed Bennedict McCarthy in the 23rd minute. There were also strong performances from defender Mark Fish, striker Glenn Salmon, and winger Steve Guppy. (Okay, I might've made the last guy up.)\n\nTanzania - 0\n\nNamibia - 2 (J Lowndes 9, C Berry 89)\n\nNamibia may have been blessed by the God-given talents of Quinton Jacobs, but it was two computer-generated greys who turned this match in their favour. Julian Lowndes and Christer Berry scored at the start and end respectively, while poor old Tanzania were caught in the middle.\n\nTunisia - 1 (J Clayton 72)\n\nUganda - 0\n\nI believe that José Clayton was one of the first Brazilians to play international football for another country. The Tunisian trendsetter, who plays at left-wing for Bastia, earned his adopted country a first-leg victory against a Uganda team who clearly regretted not calling up Chris Kiwomya.\n\nZambia - 1 (M Miti 59)\n\nMali - 2 (A Coulibaly 16, M Bagayoko 89)\n\nThe match of the day saw teenage defender Adama Coulibaly open the scoring for Mali before Zambian frontman Mwape Miti retaliated. However, the day was to end in agony for the home team, as another Malian youngster - winger Mamadou Bagayoko - pinched a first-leg lead in the dying moments.\n\n22 APRIL 2000\n\nThe butterfly effect is a concept that states that \"small causes can have larger effects\".\n\nNo, I didn't just copy that from Wikipedia. Okay, maybe I did. But the idea that the flap of just one butterfly's wings could have a far-reaching ripple effect on later historic effects certainly apply to playing video games such as Championship Manager retrospectively.\n\nNow you're probably thinking that I've turned into an old French philosopher, like Sartre or Descartes or Cantona, but it's true. As soon as you click 'Continue Game' for the first time in a new CM career, all hell breaks loose, and so many little things happen that could have a huge effect in the future.\n\nWhen it comes to the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, today is where we start to see the butterfly effect in, erm, full effect. It's entirely possible that some African nations who qualified for the real-life finals might not even make it past Round 1 of the CAF preliminaries in-game.\n\nSenegal - the boys from West Africa who took the Far East by storm in reality - are particularly vulnerable. They only drew 1-1 in their home leg against minnows São Tomé & Príncipe, and will probably need an away win to keep alive their qualification hopes. Can Bruno Metsu's men deliver when it most matters, or will the East Asian public be spared the sight of Elhadji Diouf's phlegm flying into an opponent's face?\n\nAn arguably even more sensational story would be written if Nigeria failed to reach Round 2. They go into their home leg with Guinea locked at 1-1 against a team that was actually expelled from the qualifiers in real-life.\n\nCurrent African champions Cameroon probably won't have too many problems in despatching Niger. You'll also get long odds against either South Africa or Tunisia being eliminated today at the respective hands of Botswana or Uganda.\n\nNow, to quote King Eric, \"When the seagulls follow the trawler...\"\n\nCAF Round 1\n\nLeg 2 Results\n\nBenin - 2 (L D'Jaffo 74, J Nicolas 82)\n\nSierra Leone - 0\n\n[Benin win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nSierra Leone goalkeeper Gani Goodliffe wasn't exactly living the good life in Porto Novo. Laurent D'Jaffo (of Sheffield United) gave Benin the lead late in the first half, and Jeremie Nicolas (of Team Grey) doubled it to end the Leone Stars' dreams.\n\nBotswana - 0\n\nSouth Africa - 5 (B McCarthy 1,31, S Zuma 21,44, M Fish 26)\n\n[South Africa win 6-0 on aggregate]\n\nBafana Bafana barely won on home soil, but they rediscovered their mojo upon crossing the border into Gaborone. A couple of strikes each from Bennedict McCarthy and Sibusiso Zuma, along with a very rare goal from Mark Fish, sent South Africa coasting through.\n\nCameroon - 1 (P Mboma 70)\n\nNiger - 0\n\n[Cameroon win 4-1 on aggregate]\n\nNiger's slim hopes of progression arguably ended as soon as left-winger Siradji Sani was sent off in the 33rd minute. That said, goalkeeper Fousseni Cerullei did put up a strong resistance before finally conceding to Patrick Mboma midway through the second half. The Lions are still indomitable.\n\nCape Verde Islands - 1 (AJ Vicente 18)\n\nAngola - 1 (Jordão 60)\n\n[Angola win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nCape Verde Islands negated their first-leg deficit through Artur Jorge Vicente in the 18th minute. Sadly for them, they then conceded a fateful away goal to Angola's West Brom midfielder Jordão in the 60th minute. Despite losing João Elias to a late red card, the visitors went through.\n\nChad - 2 (H Chevrollier 7, H Gagneux 83)\n\nAlgeria - 0\n\n[Chad win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nI wasn't expecting that! Though Algeria led narrowly after the first leg, Chad striker Hermann Chevrollier rolled them over after seven minutes. Captain Hugues Gagneux then added a second goal for Les Sao in the dying moments to spring a huge surprise. The Fennecs had been outfoxed!\n\nDjibouti - 0\n\nEgypt - 2 (A Sabry 84, M Emara 88)\n\n[Egypt win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nAgainst a far stronger team than Djibouti, Egypt might well have regretted Sami El Sheshini's first-half red card. As it was, the Pharoahs could afford to toy with their opponents before Benfica's Abdelsater Sabry and Rostock's Mohammed Emara eventually killed them off.\n\nEthiopia - 2 (V Gigli 28, S Kole 66)\n\nLibya - 0\n\n[Ethiopia win 3-0 on aggregate]\n\nWhere was future Perugia legend Al-Saadi Gaddafi when Libya needed him? His father won't have been too chuffed to see his country knocked out of the World Cup by Ethiopian greys Vitaly Gigli and Scott Kole. The very real Ethiopia centre-half Mohammed Ibrahim was then sent off in the 89th minute, not that it made any difference to the outcome.\n\nGabon - 1 (A Ossey 44)\n\nBurundi - 0\n\n[Gabon win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nGabon built on their 3-0 advantage from the first game through Armand Ossey, who scored the only shot on target in the entire second leg. Burundi claimed no fewer than four yellow cards, but delivered nothing that even remotely resembled a test for Gabonese goalie Jean-Cédric Cazenave.\n\nGambia - 3 (E Sillah 43, J Ceesay 50, K Ceesay 64)\n\nLesotho - 1 (L Seema 12)\n\n[Gambia win 6-1 on aggregate]\n\nLehlohonolo Seema - aka the Mosotho Father Christmas - got the first of three goals Lesotho needed to complete an incredible comeback. Sadly, The Gambia then added another trio of goals to their tally through Ebou Sillah, Jatto Ceesay and Kemo Ceesay (the Ceesays aren't related). With Lesotho surprisingly unable to create five goals in the final 26 minutes, the tie was easily won.\n\nIvory Coast - 1 (I Bakayoko 89)\n\nEritrea - 0\n\n[Ivory Coast win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nIf you played Championship Manager in the late 1990s, you'll surely know all about Ibrahima Bakayoko. The iconic ex-Everton striker scored a belated winner for the Ivory Coast against plucky Eritrea, whose resistance finally cracked... and yes, I did just copy and paste the first-leg report!\n\nKenya - 0\n\nCentral African Republic - 0\n\n[0-0 on aggregate, Kenya win 1-0 on penalties]\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we've found two countries that are even worse at penalties than England and the Netherlands! Kenya's Phil Perego wasted a spot-kick in the 94th minute of another dour goalless draw, which went all the way to a shoot-out. The Kenyans spurned three more penalties and scored one, but CAR missed five on the spin and crashed out!\n\nMadagascar - 0\n\nMozambique - 0\n\n[Mozambique win 1-0 on aggregate]\n\nThere was more penalty woe here, this time for Saïd Karani. Had the Madagascar left-back scored from 12 yards in the 67th minute, this tie might well have gone into overtime. As it transpired, Mozambique's solitary first-leg goal was enough to keep Eusébio's legacy alive.\n\nMali - 0\n\nZambia - 0\n\n[Mali win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nBlimey, another goalless draw! Did most of Africa's teams use up their goal allowances a fortnight ago? Anyway, a 0-0 was fine for Frédéric Kanouté and Mali, who reached the next round courtesy of their 2-1 win in Zambia. We sadly shall not be seeing the Copper Bullets' ageless former PSV striker Kalusha Bwalya in the finals.\n\nMauritius - 0\n\nGhana - 3 (E Duah 2,24, E Tetteh 56)\n\n[Ghana win 5-3 on aggregate]\n\nGhana trailed 3-2 after their home leg, but a first-half brace from Emmanuel Duah turned the tie on its head. A red card for Mauritian captain Ellis Rowley added to the hosts' misery, which was further compiled when Emmanuel Tetteh sealed the Black Stars' comeback after the restart.\n\nMorocco - 2 (A Elkhattabi 3, Y Chippo 71)\n\nBurkina Faso - 0\n\n[Morocco win 6-0 on aggregate]\n\nHenri Michel's Morocco made serene progress to Round 2 after Ali Elkhattabi scored his fourth goal of a one-sided tie. Coventry's defensive midfielder Youssef Chippo then got the final word in, just because he could. Burkina Faso had had their chips, with a lot of vinegar and no tomato sauce.\n\nNamibia - 2 (Q Jacobs 20,55)\n\nTanzania - 0\n\n[Namibia win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nQuinton Jacobs is probably the only footballer on Earth who has played for both Partick Thistle and Duisburg. The journeyman winger scored two goals in his native Namibia to eliminate Tanzania, who had centre-back Blasko Chong sent off. His comedy partner Blasko Cheech could not be reached for comment.\n\nNigeria - 4 (V Agali 29,38,43,90)\n\nGuinea - 0\n\n[Nigeria win 5-1 on aggregate]\n\nWas there any doubt that Nigeria would qualify for the next phase? And was there any doubt that Victor Agali would score four goals to send Guinea packing? And was there any doubt that Nwankwo Kanu would get himself sent off... okay, maybe that was a bit far-fetched.\n\nSão Tomé & Príncipe - 0\n\nSenegal - 0\n\n[1-1 on aggregate, São Tomé & Príncipe win 4-1 on penalties]\n\nWow! We will not see a repeat of Senegal's real-life run to the Quarter Finals! The Lions of Teranga lost left-back Diope to a red card on 57 minutes and never recovered. They were taken to penalties by tiny São Tomé & Príncipe, whose spotlessness from the spot crushed the butterfly's wings.\n\nSeychelles - 0\n\nLiberia - 1 (K Sebwe 8)\n\n[Liberia win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nLiberia's superstar captain George Weah was again the main attraction, but this time, he was upstaged by someone who played for Panahaiki in Greece. Kelvin Sebwe scored the fateful goal after eight minutes at the People's Stadium in Victoria, leaving the people of the Seychelles distinctly unhappy.\n\nSudan - 0\n\nGuinea-Bissau - 0\n\n[Sudan win 1-0 on aggregate]\n\nWe've lost two Guineas today, with Guinea-Bissau going the same way as their similarly-named cousins. Central defender Amarildo Gomes excelled for the visitors, but the forwards failed to overturn Sudan's narrow lead. Papua New Guinea must be quaking in their boots now.\n\nSwaziland - 1 (D Masina 33)\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo - 2 (A Kona 16,94)\n\n[aet, Democratic Republic of Congo win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nAndre Kona opened the scoring for DR Congo, but things could have gone very wrong for the favourites after Denis Masina drew Swaziland level. Kona eventually came to the Leopards' rescue again, with his extra-time winner ending the valiant challenge of the Sihlangu Semnikati.\n\nThe Congo - 1 (R Akiana 66)\n\nRwanda - 1 (D Pedros 111)\n\n[aet, Rwanda win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nCongo left-back Jules Tchimbakala and Rwanda right-back Iranus Aliadiere (Jeremie's long-lost grey cousin) were both sent off in a combative first period. Richard Akiana's second-half goal for Congo then sent the tie into extra-time, where Djibril Pedros' away goal decided it in the Wasps' favour.\n\nTogo - 3 (KA Assignon 8, K Agboh 63, D Oyawolé 71)\n\nMauritania - 0\n\n[Togo win 5-0 on aggregate]\n\nTogo could well go a long way if this performance suggests anything. Komlan Agbeko Assignon strengthened their advantage after eight minutes, with Kwami Agboh and Djima Oyawolé later securing the win. Mauritania needed a lot more than they had.\n\nUganda - 0\n\nTunisia - 3 (A Sellimi 16,88, K Sdirir 38)\n\n[Tunisia win 4-0 on aggregate]\n\nTunisia are still going strong in the qualifiers, thanks to a couple of goals from Adel Sellimi in Kampala. Karim Sdirir also played his part in securing a comfortable aggregate win over Uganda for the Eagles of Carthage, whose captain Zoubaier Baya stupidly got sent off after an hour.\n\nZimbabwe - 1 (G Mushangazhike 3)\n\nMalawi - 0\n\n[Zimbabwe win 2-0 on aggregate]\n\nIf Madonna plans to adopt any Malawian babies in the future, the chances are that they won't have much footballing talent. Malawi were out of the World Cup quicker than a ray of light, thanks to Gilbert Mushangazhike, who must be a linguistic nightmare for Zimbabwean soccer commentators!\n\n17 JUNE 2000\n\nThis is it, folks. It's the middle of June, and you know what that means! It's Jordan Henderson's 10th birthday!\n\nMore importantly, today is the day that this CM00/01 save game officially starts. From now on, every match will be simulated in full. That means I'm able to write slightly more detailed match reports.\n\nRound 2 of the CAF qualifiers kicks off today, with the opening group games. Just to remind you, the 25 teams who came through Round 1 have been divided into five groups of four. Once everyone has played each of their group opponents twice, the top teams in each pool will secure their places at the 2002 World Cup.\n\nFour of the African teams who qualified for the real-life 2002 finals - Cameroon, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia - are still in the hunt. Significantly, those four teams have been drawn into separate groups, meaning that we could potentially see all of them in Asia. Then again, the likes of Angola, Egypt and Ghana might have other ideas.\n\nWe'll also see the second legs of CONCACAF's Interzone Playoff ties take place tonight. Once they're finished, we'll have filled the last three vacancies in the 12-team Semi Final line-up.\n\nGuatemala, Netherlands Antilles and Trinidad & Tobago all carry narrow first-leg leads into their rematches. Honduras could yet turn it around against Guatemala on home soil, as could Panama when they host the Trinbagonians. However, Surinam have it all to do in Curacao after losing their home leg to the Dutch Antilles.\n\nIn completely unrelated news, Conference side Nuneaton have announced the appointment of a total unknown as their new manager. Billy Holiday is a 35-year-old English/Albanian coach with no prior experience of managing at a semi-professional level, though he does have a fondness for jazz music.\n\nIt's not yet known whether Holiday will have a hands-on role at Manor Park. Some sceptical Boro fans have speculated that he might randomly jet off to various locations around the world to watch top-level international football and leave his assistant to run the club in his stead.\n\nCome to think of it, I'm not entirely sure why I mentioned that. You're only here because you're interested in the World Cup. Why should I be letting you know about events at some provincial club in Worcestershire?\n\nOkay, I've just been informed by my secretary - who also has a second job as my pet cat - that Nuneaton is in Warwickshire, not Worcestershire. Anyway, let's get back on topic...\n\nCAF Round 2\n\nGroup Draw\n\nGROUP 1:Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Namibia, Nigeria, Sudan\n\nNigeria might have the pedigree, but they've got to fend off a couple more big dogs to qualify this time around. Egypt are consistently amongst the top teams in Africa and were continental champions as recently as 1998. DR Congo probably have as good a chance of qualifying as they ever have done since reaching the finals as Zaire in 1974.\n\nGROUP 2:Benin, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Tunisia\n\nTonight's match between Ghana and Tunisia could effectively be a group decider. While Tunisia have graced the World Cup stage recently, Ghana have a strong and young-ish team hungry to make history. Liberia could also launch a challenge for top spot, provided that George Weah continues to make himself available for selection.\n\nGROUP 3:Angola, Ethiopia, Gabon, Rwanda, South Africa\n\nOf the top seeds, South Africa probably have the easiest group. Angola - with a decent team consisting largely of Portuguese-based diaspora - look like being Bafana Bafana's only real challengers on paper. I doubt that either Gabon or Rwanda can keep pace with those two in the long run, but they might be able to put some obstacles in the way.\n\nGROUP 4:Gambia, Ivory Coast, Morocco, Mozambique, São Tomé & Príncipe\n\nMorocco qualified for Round 2 comfortably, but the Ivory Coast are a fearsome team who could easily steal their tickets to the Far East. Those two sides clash in the opening round tonight, so we'll soon learn a lot about their credentials. The others - including 1960s legend Eusébio's birthplace of Mozambique - will probably only be fighting for pride.\n\nGROUP 5:Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Togo, Zimbabwe\n\n8 out of 10 cats will probably tell you that Cameroon are dead-certs make it through the group. The Indomitable Lions' pride could be their downfall, though, as complacency might well set in at some point. They can't afford to let that happen - not against Mali, Togo or Zimbabwe, who will all be primed to take advantage of any mistakes.\n\nGroup 1 Results\n\nEgypt - 1 (A Hassan 83)\n\nNigeria - 0\n\nAn inauspicious start for Nigeria. The Super Eagles had quite a few chances in the first half, but they couldn't find their way through a defensively resilient home team. Egypt then claimed a real smash-and-grab win in the 83rd minute - Denizlispor midfielder Ahmed Hassan stabbing home Mohammed Emara's cross with the Pharaohs' only shot on target. Please note that Ahmed Hassan is not to be confused with 17-year-old AA Gent striker Ahmed Hossam (otherwise known as Mido), who made his debut as a substitute.\n\nNamibia - 0\n\nSudan - 0\n\nThis wasn't a particularly gripping game by any means. Namibia had five shots at goal all game, but none were on target, with striker Grahjam Shelton proving to be about as accurate as his parents' spelling. Sudan were hardly any better, though Karim Jam'an did force home goalkeeper Ronnie Kanalelo into a couple of saves.\n\nGroup 2 Results\n\nGhana - 1 (E Tetteh 4)\n\nTunisia - 0\n\nTunisia's bid to reach back-to-back World Cups suffered an early blow after four minutes, when \"Tetteh scored!!\" No, really - that's all the match report says about Emmanuel Tetteh's goal. The reporter must have rushed back from the restroom at the El Wak Sports stadium in Accra. Anyone who missed that goal would have been gutted, as although Ghana had 10 more shots on target, Tunisian goalkeeper Boubaker Zitouni played a blinder to keep the scoreline at 1-0.\n\nKenya - 1 (D Jyrkin 16)\n\nBenin - 3 (L D'Jaffo 60,80, PE Bonalair 71)\n\nIt looked like being an uphill struggle for Benin when winger Rodrigue Akpakoun came off injured after just six minutes, and David Jyrkin fired Kenya into the lead 10 minutes later. However, the match turned in the 36th minute, when home midfielder Valery Urdaneta inexplicably headbutted Benin defender Jeremie Nicolas and received a straight red card. The Squirrels then fought back in the second half, with two goals from Laurent D'Jaffo and one from Pierre-Emmanuel Bonalair earning them an important early victory.\n\nGroup 3 Results\n\nAngola - 3 (Quinzinho 11,67, Mantorras 66)\n\nSouth Africa - 2 (P Masinga 45, G Mofokeng 48)\n\nQuinzinho's early headed goal for Angola set the tone for a thrilling tussle. Sadly, South African winger Steve Lekoelea had to miss most of it after twisting his knee in the 38th minute. His compatriot Phil Masinga equalised on the stroke of half-time, and when Ajax teenager Gabriel Mofokeng made it 2-1 early in the second period, Bafana Bafana looked to be getting the points. That was until two goals in the space of two minutes from Mantorras and Quinzinho turned the match on its head again! The Palancas Negras snatched a 3-2 win, and South Africa had some early soul-searching to do.\n\nRwanda - 1 (A Mateso 29)\n\nEthiopia - 0\n\nA close contest was decided on just a single goal, from Rwanda's Abdellah Mateso just before the half-hour. Mateso is a 34-year-old striker - currently at Dessel - who has spent pretty much his entire club career in Belgium. Despite Ethiopia's inability to score, their improbably-named grey defender Ricardo Henrique Marinucci-Palermo went home with the 'man of the match' award.\n\nGroup 4 Results\n\nGambia - 0\n\nSão Tomé & Príncipe - 2 (Orlando 4, JL Hernani 47)\n\nI'm a sucker for attacking players named Orlando, so imagine my delight when a player with that moniker gave São Tomé & Príncipe the advantage early on. Things weren't looking good for the Gambia, and they got worse when striker Edrissa Sonko and centre-half Momo Dou Loum each sustained injuries later in the half. José Luis Hernani then rubbed further salt into the wounds, with his early second-half strike giving Senegal's conquerors the perfect start to the group phase.\n\nMorocco - 3 (S Bassir 29,56,74)\n\nIvory Coast - 0\n\nAnything Ali Elkhattabi can do, Salaheddine Bassir can do as well. The Deportivo hotshot followed up his Moroccan compatriot's hat-trick in the last round by getting another three goals in a dominant display against the Ivory Coast. Bassir got his first after just under half an hour, and a couple more strikes beat Alain Gouaméné after the teams switched ends. Les Éléphants failed to register a single shot at goal, which was just what they deserved after failing to call up Didier Drogba.\n\nGroup 5 Results\n\nChad - 0\n\nMali - 1 (A Karembe 68)\n\nIf Frédéric Kanouté isn't firing for you, then why not call up one of Auxerre's 652 hot prospects to get your goals instead? Mali manager - and 'Bohemian Rhapsody' lyric - Christian Sarramagna subbed Kanouté off just before half-time, and then introduced Alfousseyni Karembe to his attack early in the second half. Sure enough, 20-year-old Karembe finally broke Chad's resistance in the 68th minute, just 10 minutes into his cameo. The Malians then defended with all their might (and Djimi Traoré) before grinding out a narrow win.\n\nZimbabwe - 2 (G Mushangazhike 79, Kennedy 87)\n\nCameroon - 0\n\nThe Indomitable Lions? More like Domitable Lions, am I right?! Cameroon shot from here, there and everywhere in Harare, but the quality of Zimbabwe's shooting late on won out over the Group 5 favourites' quantity. The hosts took the lead after 79 minutes through a free-kick from Gilbert Mushangazhike (yes, that man again). Eight minutes after that came a second goal, this time from the rather more pronounceable Kennedy. The Aris midfielder's full name is Kennedy Nagoli, but he probably dropped his surname to sound a bit more Brazilian.\n\nCONCACAF Interzone Playoff\n\nLeg 2 Results\n\nGuatemala - 2 (B Murúa 7, C Martínez Madrigal 18)\n\nHonduras - 1 (E Bennett 64)\n\n[Honduras win 3-2 on aggregate]\n\nGuatemala erased their 2-0 first-leg deficit within 18 minutes, as Benito Murua and Crescensio Martínez Madrigal put La Azul y Blanco on the cusp of causing a minor shock. To make matters worse for Honduras, their captain Josep Yeste had injured himself in a valiant attempt to stop Martínez Madrigal from scoring. However, salvation for Los Catrachos came on 64 minutes through Eduardo Bennett, who converted a rebound strike after Guatemala goalie Damián García Muñoz. Honduras might have lost the second leg, but they'd won the tie and qualified for the Semi Finals.\n\nNetherlands Antilles - 0\n\nSurinam - 0\n\n[Netherlands Antilles win 1-0 on aggregate]\n\nOur Surinam-loving hipsters are in mourning tonight. Netherlands Antilles never remotely looked like surrendering their first-leg lead during a tame second match in Curacao. Once visiting midfielder Harvey Reingoud was forced off with a knock in the 38th minute, it was very much an uphill struggle for the 'Suriboys'. Still, Richard van der Kuylen and company can return home with their heads held high.\n\nPanama - 2 (JC Dely Valdés 66, JG Luengo 77)\n\nTrinidad & Tobago - 0\n\n[Panama win 2-1 on aggregate]\n\nIf you haven't grown sick of my referring to a certain Van Halen song every time a certain team plays, then you're in luck! We won't be seeing Trinidad & Tobago in the Semi Finals, but we shall be hearing more from PANAMA! It took them 66 minutes to cancel out their deficit from the first leg through Julio César Dely Valdés. Not long after that, substitute José Gustavo Luengo delighted the home fans further, securing a 2-0 win that ended the dreams of Dwight Yorke's Soca Warriors.\n\n28 JUNE 2000\n\nAs we all know, South America is a hotbed for unconventional footballing heroes and villains, and a continent where shock results are never too far away. Even so, the table for the CONMEBOL World Cup qualifiers sure does look incredibly surreal after three rounds.\n\nOn the one hand, we've got Venezuela and Ecuador in the qualifying places, even though they've graced a grand total of zero World Cup tournaments between them. On the other, we've got Argentina, Brazil and Colombia outside the top five, and currently on course to miss the finals.\n\nOf course, the old saying goes that the cream always rises to the top. The CONMEBOL qualifying tournament is a marathon, but we've barely completed the first few miles at this point. There's plenty of time for the big boys to overtake the pace-setters.\n\nTonight, I have a feeling that the tide will start to turn in favour of the established powers. Argentina are at home to an inconsistent Uruguay team.\n\nBrazil also have a tricky match, but beating Chile away from home could be the moment where they start to show why they finished runners-up in France a couple of years ago. By that, I obviously don't mean that their star striker fell ill on the morning of the Final.\n\nAs for top-of-the-table Venezuela, don't be surprised if the same team who defeated Brazil at the Maracanã went on to lose at home to fellow minnows Ecuador. That would just be typical.\n\nCONMEBOL Qualifiers\n\nResults\n\nArgentina - 2 (G Batistuta 31, HJ Crespo 45)\n\nUruguay - 2 (Á Recoba pen19, D Silva 20)\n\nArgentina's nightmare start to the qualifiers worsened when a reckless two-footed lunge on Uruguay striker Darío Silva saw midfield destroyer Fernando Carlos Redondo concede a penalty and a red card. Álvaro Recoba scored said penalty, and Silva made it 2-0 to La Celeste barely a minute later. Luckily for La Albiceleste, they had two of Serie A's most-feared strikers to call upon, and Gabriel Batistuta and Hernan Jorge Crespo erased the arrears just before half-time. Though Argentina couldn't muster a third goal after the restart, they did at least avoid a third defeat.\n\nChile - 0\n\nBrazil - 2 (Vágner 20, Romário 23)\n\nChile's unbeaten start was crushed by the 'Ride of the Valkyries'. After 20 minutes, Celta's newly-capped Brazil midfielder Vágner decided on a whim that he would dribble halfway up the Estadio Nacional pitch and then lash in a fantastic solo goal. The Seleção doubled their lead three minutes later, with Romário getting his 54th goal in the yellow and blue. Chile battled hard to try and get back level, but Cafú was simply unbeatable in the Brazilian defence. All of a sudden, life is good for the four-time world champions again.\n\nParaguay - 2 (C Paredes 40, P Sarabia 65)\n\nColombia - 2 (H Lozano 51, I Córdoba 70)\n\nDefending went out the window in a thrilling contest. Carlos Paredes' clinical header in the 40th minute put Paraguay ahead until Harold Lozano nodded in a goal of his own six minutes into the second half. Colombia then had to come back from behind again, with left-back Iván Cordoba doing the honours after Paraguayan centre-half Pedro Sarabia had scored a similarly unlikely goal. La Albirroja remain without a loss, but Los Cafeteros are still to register their first victory.\n\nPeru - 2 (C Pizarro pen73, P Zegarra 87)\n\nBolivia - 0\n\nDespite being under pressure for most of the match, Bolivia were looking quite good until they imploded in the final 20 minutes. Grey Bolivian left-back José Emiliano Esnal had been on the pitch for mere seconds when he pulled on Peru midfielder Martin Rodriguez's shirt in his own area. Esnal left the field without so much as breaking sweat, and Claudio Pizarro's penalty put Peru on track for a victory that they then secured through Pablo Zegarra. By then, La Verde had gone down to NINE men, as Erwin Sánchez had himself been sent off after 77 minutes for a two-footed lunge on Nolberto Solano.\n\nVenezuela - 1 (G Savarese 39)\n\nEcuador - 1 (D Herrera 89)\n\nThis battle between the two CONMEBOL members that had never qualified for the World Cup was as tense as you would probably expect. Leaders Venezuela's pursuit of the opening goal yielded a reward in the 39th minute, when Giovanni Savarese headed home from Félix Hernandez's cross. It looked like they would go on to secure a third win in four matches, but Ecuador had other ideas. Substitute winger Diego Herrera's header in the penultimate minute salvaged a draw, and silenced the hosts' maracas in Caracas. (I'm here all week!)\n\nP W D L F A GD PTS 1.

Anywhere alone.\n\nBelgium and the Netherlands had co-hosted a truly wonderful European Championship, which had been enjoyed by everyone involved (okay, maybe not Phil Neville... or the Belgian police). The Final between France and Italy proved to be a fitting climax.\n\nWhen Marco Delvecchio gave Italy the lead after 55 minutes, it looked like the Azzurri would claim their first major trophy since 1982. However, a last-minute equaliser from France's Sylvain Wiltord (who would later become one of my favourite Arsenal players) sent the match into extra-time, where David Trezeguet's golden goal turned the World Cup winners into European champions.\n\nLes Bleus will now set their sights on what would be a record third consecutive major trophy victory. Meanwhile, the race to join them at the 2002 World Cup finals continues tonight, in Africa.\n\nRound 2 of the CAF qualifiers began three weeks ago, with more than a few surprises. Cameroon, Nigeria, South Africa and Tunisia - four of Africa's five representatives at the last World Cup - all lost their opening group fixtures, and they'll all be desperate to make amends tonight.\n\nNigeria made a shaky start in Group 1, but they should collect their first points when they host the Democratic Republic of Congo. Meanwhile, the Super Eagles' early conquerors Egypt are targeting back-to-back victories when they travel to Sudan.\n\nTunisia are also looking to recover from an early setback in Group 2, with an apparently simple home match against Kenya looking like the ideal game to kick-start their Round 2 campaign. Their opening loss came against Ghana, who travel to Liberia next.\n\nIn Group 3, South Africa had been rather unfortunate to lose their first fixture 3-2 to Angola, having led 2-1 with half an hour to go. Bafana Bafana will need to keep calm when they welcome Gabon to Johannesburg. Angola's second victory could come in Ethiopia.\n\nOf Africa's so-called 'big five', Cameroon look most vulnerable in Group 5. A couple of late goals from Zimbabwe condemned the so-called Indomitable Lions to an opening-day loss, and a home meeting with Togo represents another potential banana skin for them.\n\nIn Group 4, Morocco were the only African finalists from France '98 to win their opening fixture, seeing off the Ivory Coast by three Salaheddine Bassir goals to nil. Bassir looks in fine fettle going into the Atlas Lions' away match against Mozambique, so I expect even more goals from the 27-year-old Deportivo striker.\n\nIt's worth noting that there will be a long break from World Cup qualifying action for the African nations after this round of fixtures. They won't be kicking any more balls in anger - and certainly not like Zaire's Mwepu Ilunga at the 1974 finals - until January.\n\nCAF Round 2\n\nGroup 1 Results\n\nNigeria - 3 (V Agali 13, G Lawal 39, JJ Okocha 71)\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo - 0\n\nAfter a shock opening-day loss, Nigeria's Super Eagles have taken flight. Victor Agali began a convincing win over DR Congo by heading in Finidi's right-wing cross in the 13th minute. Agali then assisted for left-winger Garba Lawal just before half-time. Jay Jay Okocha completed the rout in the 71st minute with a vicious piledriver that will undoubtedly have impressed Bolton's up-and-coming coach Sam Allardyce. DR Congo did put up a brave fight, but they were no match for a far superior team.\n\nSudan - 1 (R Al-Sadik 41)\n\nEgypt - 3 (Mido 9,66,78)\n\nLadies and gentlemen, remember the name - erm, Mido! The man otherwise known as Ahmed Hossam volleyed in a weighted ball from Ahmed Hassan after nine minutes. Sudan equalised through a stunning free-kick from captain Rifat Al-Sadik on the stroke of half-time, but the second half was dominated by a 17-year-old Egyptian starlet. Mido confidently chipped Sudanese keeper Don Sulaimani in the 66th minute, and then beat the Don for a third time 12 minutes later. His dream hat-trick sends the Pharaohs to the top of Group 1.\n\nGROUP 1 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

The visitors hammered shots at goal, only to be routinely denied by Liberia goalkeeper Anthony Tokpah. As for Ghana's number 1... well, things didn't go to plan for Richard Kingston. The man who will soon lose a 't' from his surname lost the plot in the 82nd minute, collecting a red card for a professional foul on Robbie Cuss. As George Weah was busy negotiating a move to Manchester City, Daniele Gould fired the subsequent penalty past sub keeper Richard Attram, earning the Lone Stars a surprise win over the Black Stars.\n\nTunisia - 3 (Z Tlemcani 20, S Fekhi 32, A Sellimi 61)\n\nKenya - 0\n\nTunisia registered their first win of this phase, and in some style. Jet-heeled striker Ziad Tlemcani opened the scoring midway through the first half before Kenya's hopes were dented further by an injury to Brazilian-sounding centre-back Valdo (real name Evans Nyabaro). Sofiane Fekhi piled on the visitors' misery after half an hour, and Adel Sellimi made it 3-0 at the hour mark. After two defeats from two games, it'll take one heck of a comeback for the Harambee Stars to qualify now.\n\nGROUP 2 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

Ethiopia's central defender Waldenildo Jeffers (no relation to Francis) was named man of the match after a valiant display that restricted Angola to just a single goal. The Palancas Negras took 51 minutes to break through, eventually doing so through a fantastic low drive from Porto striker Quinzinho. The visitors had further chances later on, but one goal was enough to keep them at the head of Group 3.\n\nSouth Africa - 3 (JL Moshoeu 8,57, Q Fortune 79)\n\nGabon - 0\n\nJohn Leshiba Moshoeu sadly died from cancer in 2015, but his legacy lives on in Championship Manager. 'Shoes' - as the popular South African midfielder was nicknamed - scored in either half as Bafana Bafana won their opening home game of this qualifying round. Mark Fish and Quinton Fortune each provided assists for Moshoeu. Indeed, Manchester United winger Fortune would himself find the net in the 79th minute. Gabon never got close to scoring, partly because Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has only just celebrated his 11th birthday.\n\nGROUP 3 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

Gabon 1 0 0 1 0 3 -3 0\n\nGroup 4 Results\n\nIvory Coast - 1 (D Bakari 14)\n\nGambia - 0\n\nLille striker Dagui Bakari perhaps isn't as well-known as some of his Ivory Coast team-mates. Nevertheless, he came to the fore in Abidjan, where he volleyed in the decisive goal against Gambia. A sublime volley from Félix Dja Ettien's delivery into the penalty area proved too much for away keeper Dembo Touray. Things then got too much for compatriot Ebou Sillah, who twisted his knee in the 57th minute. The Gambia have now had THREE players leave a match injured already in this group phase, which begs the question: Have they borrowed Darren Anderton's physio?\n\nMozambique - 0\n\nMorocco - 4 (S Bassir 19, H Regragui 24, A Elkhattabi 41, M Hadji 50)\n\nNorth Africa's great entertainers put on another goalscoring feast in Maputo. An early red card for Mozambique winger Mário Artur, who'd pushed Youssef Chippo in full view of the referee, allowed Morocco to run riot. Salaheddine Bassir (Deportivo) opened the floodgates in the 19th minute, and he would soon be joined on the scoresheet by Hoalid Regragui (Toulouse) and Ali Elkhattabi (Sparta). The rout was then finished off early in the second half by an outstanding midfielder who'd already produced two assists - Mustapha Hadji (erm, Coventry).\n\nGROUP 4 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

The Indomitable Lions had 10 shots on target, but their first goal came in the 34th minute through a Pierre Njanka penalty after Geremi had been fouled by Vikash Thirion. The second half then saw teenager Samuel Eto'o smash in a howitzer before politely asking his club Deportivo for a small raise on his £2,000-per-week salary. The rout was completed by another reasonably young (but no less talented) Cameroonian striker in Pierre Wome.\n\nMali - 2 (F Kanouté 53, M Keita 89)\n\nZimbabwe - 0\n\nIt's just typical of Zimbabwe to beat Cameroon, but then get comprehensively outplayed by Mali. The first half flew by with no highlights whatsoever, but that all changed in the second period. Frédéric Kanouté bagged his first goal in Malian colours eight minutes after the restart. Surprisingly, the Eagles wouldn't score again until captain Makan Keita sealed the points in the penultimate minute. I like Keita already, simply because he plays for a Greek club named Panelefsiniakos. I hope they qualify for the Champions League one day, if only to hear David Pleat have a go at pronouncing their name!\n\nGROUP 5 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

Things won't be quite so easy for them tonight, as they face what will surely be their toughest tests of the CONCACAF Semi Finals.\n\nCanada's eclectic squad could slip up for the first time in Group 1 when they visit Costa Rica. Los Ticos might have lost their group opener to Honduras, but having home advantage could spur Paulo Wanchope and co to pick up their first points.\n\nIn Group 2, we've got a mouth-watering battle between the United States of America and Jamaica. You should always expect fireworks when these two countries compete, whether it's on an athletics track or a football pitch. (If any prospective West Ham owners are reading this, I'd like to point out that it's probably not a good idea to combine the two.)\n\nThe USA have a very experienced team, and to be honest, I thought they would've freshened things up after the debacle that was their France '98 campaign. However, the likes of Predrag Radosavljevic (37), Thomas Dooley (39) and Marcelo Balboa (55 - no, wait, that's Rocky Balboa) have been retained by new head coach Bruce Arena.\n\nHeh, heh... Bruce Arena. That sounds like what Aston Villa's new 60,000-seater stadium would be called if Steve led them to the 2022 Champions League title on FM18. It's possible, y'know...\n\nBefore I lose my train of thought, I'll quickly touch on Mexico in Group 3. They made light work of Guyana last time out, but I suspect El Tri might struggle to put 'tri' goals past a decent El Salvador team tonight. I certainly don't expect Los Cuscatlecos to score another 'tri', as they did in Panama.\n\nCONCACAF Semi Final\n\nGroup 1 Results\n\nBarbados - 2 (M McCammon 3, G Goodridge 18)\n\nHonduras - 1 (J Martínez 1)\n\nHonduras were very quick out of the blocks, with Coventry's Jairo Martínez exploiting some sleepiness in the Barbadian defence in the very first minute. At the other end, the Central Americans' own defenders took their time to wake up as well. Mark McCammon levelled for the Bajans after three minutes, and he then set up a goal for Greg Goodridge a quarter-hour later. Honduras had plenty of time to try and get back in the game, but they couldn't, and succumbed to a surprise defeat.\n\nCosta Rica - 0\n\nCanada - 3 (D Xausa 2, A Bunbury 43, K McKenna pen84)\n\nIt's two wins in two for Canada, and Costa Rica are in a real battle to save themselves. Los Ticos were up against it as early as the second minute, when Davide Xausa volleyed Paul Fenwick's header home. Alex Bunbury then had a host of opportunities to double Canada's advantage, eventually doing so just before half-time. The Canucks' third, game-clinching goal came from the penalty spot four minutes from the end. Kevin McKenna scored after Jason De Vos had had his jersey pulled by Costa Rican right-back Vinicio Montero, who perhaps couldn't wait to swap shirts with the Dundee United defender.\n\nGROUP 1 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

Star striker Robin Nelisse rounded off a sublime team move with an emphatic finish past St Kitts goalkeeper D Perpetuini (yeah) in the 30th minute. Teenager Nelson Wau wowed the home fans with a second goal five minutes later, and the Kittitians never really recovered. Though Callum Willock did get a goal back in the second period, he and his countrymen are finding out just how strong you need to be at this level to progress further.\n\nUnited States of America - 2 (E Wynalda 20,23)\n\nJamaica - 0\n\nMiami's Eric Wynalda is challenging to be the top scorer in the 2000 Major League Soccer season. Based on this performance, he might have a chance of winning the Golden Cleats, or whatever they call that award over there. A couple of first-half goals - both assisted by Predrag Radosavljevic - helped Wynalda to fire the USA towards a second group win in succession. The Yanks lost Frankie Hejduk to injury in the first half, while Jamaican midfielder Darryl Powell was injured himself in the 75th minute. Powell was replaced with Jason Euell... who was sent off within two minutes for pushing Eddie Pope.\n\nGROUP 2 P W D L F A GD PTS 1. USA 2 2 0 0 6 0 6 6 2.

Considering that Mexico had three times as many shots at goal as El Salvador, perhaps one would. Mexico's 39-year-old midfielder Benjamin Galindo rattled the bar just before half-time, though he would eventually score in the 63rd minute. It looked like Old Man Ben's strike would be the decisive one, until El Salvador registered their first shot on target nine minutes from time. Raul Diaz Arce struck his free-kick past El Tri goalkeeper Jorge Campos - who signed for West Brom literally today - and salvaged a point for the hosts.\n\nGuyana - 0\n\nPanama - 0\n\nOkay, this draw was so poor that I can't be bothered to make any of my usual quips about the Cort brothers or 1980s glam metal. These two teams only managed a couple of shots on target apiece in a low-quality 'contest'. Both teams remain winless in the group, and to be honest, I can't see either of them making it to the Final Round. Feel free to mock me if I prove to be wrong.\n\nGROUP 3 P W D L F A GD PTS 1.

Guyana 2 0 1 1 0 3 -3 1\n\n29 JULY 2000\n\nWe're about to reach a critical stage in CONMEBOL's World Cup qualifiers. Tonight, we could learn a lot about whether Venezuela are ready to make their debut appearance in the global showpiece.\n\nImprobable as it sounds, La Vinotinto currently head the pack in the race for qualification. They also have the last remaining unbeaten record, but that will surely be put to the test when Argentina face them in Caracas. We know that La Albiceleste have enough firepower to fill the home defence with holes, but whether their own backline survives intact will probably determine the result.\n\nIf Venezuela do slip up, that would open the door for Brazil to potentially take top spot. A draw against Uruguay in Rio de Janeiro would do the job, but they will want a victory to assert themselves as South America's top dogs.\n\nThat's the current top four covered. The other matches concerning the bottom six are genuinely too close to call, and I'm not going to bother predicting anything. For all I know, the opposite would probably happen instead.\n\nInstead, I'll just mention that Chile and Paraguay are meeting in the battle of the so-called one-man bands. It's the unstoppable force (Marcelo Salas) versus the immovable object (José Luis Chilavert).\n\nBottom-dwellers Ecuador are hoping to climb up the table by defeating Bolivia, which would leave La Verde at risk of dropping to last place. That would depend on Peru avoiding defeat against mid-table Colombia.\n\nCONMEBOL Qualifiers\n\nResults\n\nBrazil - 1 (Vágner 90)\n\nUruguay - 1 (Á Recoba 88)\n\n50 years after 'Maracanaço', we very nearly had a repeat result in Rio de Janeiro! Brazil set their stall out to attack Uruguay immediately, but were routinely thwarted by tough tackling from Martín Rivas and fine goalkeeping from Álvaro Núñez. And when Álvaro Recoba curled in a beautiful shot against the run of play in the 88th minute, it looked like Uruguay would emulate their heroes from the 1950 World Cup decider. That was until the dying moments, when another sublime solo goal from Celta's defensive midfielder Vágner earned Brazil a point.\n\nChile - 1 (M Salas 45)\n\nParaguay - 0\n\nIs Marcelo Salas the only Chilean capable of scoring a goal? Paraguay goalkeeper José Luis Chilavert put in a typically outstanding display to keep out shots from Manuel Alejandro Neira, Alejandro Osorio and Esteban Valencia in the first period. However, just as the ref was about to blow for half-time, Lazio's Salas popped up to stab in a Valencia cross for his - and Chile's - fourth goal of the qualifiers. That was the decisive moment in a one-sided contest that saw Paraguay come away with nothing, except an injury sustained by forward Derlis Soto nine minutes from the end.\n"
