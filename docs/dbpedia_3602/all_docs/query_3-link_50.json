        "text": "A Note From Our Board\n\nThe VisionFund International Board of Directors has been blessed beyond measure to oversee the work of our Network of 25 microfinance institutions around the globe. Every day our financial inclusion work paves the way for life in all its fullness for vulnerable families on the journey out of poverty.\n\nSince our founding in 2003 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of World Vision, VisionFund has grown to be the world’s largest Christian network of microfinance institutions, serving over one million clients every year. Livelihoods and economic empowerment are our ministry, and we seek to see lives transformed by Jesus Christ as He works through our lives, deeds and signs to bring tools to those marginalised by traditional finance mechanisms.\n\nOur 7,600 staff work tirelessly to design and implement financial and livelihood solutions that ensure our most vulnerable clients have access to tools to build sustainable livelihoods out of poverty. From our field-based officers to our senior directors, all our staff are called to serve clients with care, compassion and commitment.\n\nOur grassroots and community-based approach to change allows us to know the people, the problems, and the potential of each community we serve. Wherever we go, our local staff and particularly our community officers know and understand the community’s needs, supporting our clients to make the right decisions for their businesses, but more importantly for their families and children.\n\nThrough the tools of micro-credit, micro-insurance and micro-savings, we are continually innovating to ensure our products match the needs of our clients, whatever their situation. VisionFund is proud to have women make up 70% of our worldwide client base, and we take their specific needs into account in all that we do. When women are able to create their own incomes, their families are better cared for and we witness change in children’s well-being, both in childhood and throughout their lives."
