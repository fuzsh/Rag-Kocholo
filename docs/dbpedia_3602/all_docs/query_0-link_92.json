        "text": "Humanitarianism has neither a single past nor predetermined future. As the bastard child of the Enlightenment and Christianity, national foreign policies and non-governmental organisations, the early development of humanitarianism is often written entirely within the confines of Europe, with no reference to events in Africa. A familiar cast of heroes crusades against an equally familiar backdrop of horrors, such as Henry Dunant's campaign for the Red Cross Movement beginning in 1863. Simultaneous events, such as European expansion into Africa, fall outside the landscape of this history. The goal of the present article is to show how histories of humanitarianism in the former Congo Free State and German Southwest Africa shed light on the varied influences, priorities, and strategies of selective acts of compassion during the first decade of the twentieth century. What becomes abundantly clear, in turn, is the absence of any single humanitarian consensus at the fin de siècle.\n\nThe common perception of the American anti-imperialist movement that opposed US expansion after the Spanish–American War is one that was driven by domestic concerns like economics, security and political traditions. While this was certainly a component, there also existed a transnational element that was not spurred by domestic motives, but rather by the international context. Two particular contexts captured the attention of anti-imperialists in these years: the Boer War and the reform of the Congo Free State. The anti-imperialists presented the Boer War as a challenge to traditional US notions of republican brotherhood and as a test of the Anglo-American relationship. In the case of the Congo, they argued that the atrocities in that territory were a challenge to the American understanding of human rights. Both cases also exhibit the development of the Anglo-American relationship and international context that was central to anti-imperialism.\n\nThe paper explores the demise of the ‘colonial war’ category through the employment of French colonial troops, under the 1918 armistice, to occupy the German Rhineland. It traces the prevalence of—and the anxieties underpinning—antebellum doctrine on using ‘Barbarous Forces’ in ‘European’ war. It then records the silence of postbellum scholars on the ‘horror on the Rhine’—orchestrated allegations of rape framed in racialised terms of humanity and the requirements of the law of civilised warfare. Among possible explanations for this silence, the paper follows recent literature that considers this scandal as the embodiment of crises in masculinity, white domination, and European civilisation. These crises, like the scandal itself, expressed antebellum jurisprudential anxieties about the capacity—and implications—of black soldiers being ‘drilled white’. They also deprived postbellum lawyers of the vocabulary necessary to address what they signified: breakdown of the laws of war; evident, self-inflicted European barbarity; and the collapse of international law itself, embodied by the Versailles Diktat treating Germany—as Smuts warned, ‘as we would not treat a kaffir nation’—a colonial ‘object’, as Schmitt lamented. Last, the paper traces the resurgence of ‘colonial war’. It reveals how, at the moment of collapse, in the very instrument ambodying it, the category found a new life. The Covenant’s Art.22(5) reasserted control over the colonial object, furnishing international lawyers with new vocabulary to address the employment of colonial troops—yet, now, as part of the ‘law of peace’. Reclassified, both rule and category re-emerged, were codified, and institutionalised imperial governance.\n\nTo justify the plundering of today's Democratic Republic of the Congo, U.S. intellectual elites have continuously produced dismissive Congo discourses. Tracing these discourses in great depth and breadth for the first time, Johnny Van Hove shows how U.S. intellectuals (and their influential European counterparts) have been using the Congo in similar fashions for their own goals. Analyzing intellectuals as diverse as W.E.B. Du Bois, Joseph Conrad, and David Van Reybrouck, the book offers a theorization of Central West Africa, a case study of normalized narratives on the \"Other\", and a stirring wake up call for all contemporary writers on international history and politics.\n\nAbstract A central task for a criminology of state crime is to explain why the cruelty and destructiveness of regimes of terror so often seem to exceed anything required by the rational pursuit of organizational goals. This article explores competing explanations of terror through a case study of the Congo Free State (1885–1908) and argues that 'excesses' are committed in circumstances where it is rational for organizations and individual actors to minimize the moral costs of cruelty."
