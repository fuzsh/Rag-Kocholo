CAPUCHIN BISHOPS 1581-1988 1.1581,... consecrated:Jean (a Grignasco) Saliaschi, Titular Bishop of Cyrene or Cyrra, Auxiliary Bishop of Poitiers; named in 1581; Titular Archbishop of Antiochia in Posidia in 1588; died in 1592.J 2.1592, summer, at Naples, Cathedral. Annibale de Capua, Archbishop of Naples consecrated: Lorenzo (Orazio) Acquaviva d'Aragona, Bishop of Caiazzo , born at Conversano; Capuchin around 1572; named 19 June 1592; died 13 June 1617.2 1 This prelate does not appear in the standard reference works on the hierarchy, Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae and Hierarchia Catholica Medii et Recentioris Aevi He appears in the Lexicon Capuccinum and the 1916 edition of Annuaire Pontifical Catholique. In the latter work, he appears twice, under different names: on page 400, under the titular see of Cyrra, he is called \"Jean Saliaski, F.M.\", occupant of that see from 1581 to 1588 and also Auxiliary of Poitiers. On page 358, under the titular see of Antiochia in Pisidia, he is called \"Mgr. de Gregnasco, F.M.Cap. ou O.P. (1592).\" He has been included in the present list based on his inclusion in the Lexicon Capuccinum. While the Annuaire entries would throw some doubt as to his religious community, the Lexicon entry appears to remove any doubt in that regard. 2 This bishop, according to the Hierarchia Catholica, was a Cistercian. The Series Episcoporum also lists him as a Cistercian. The Lexicon Capuccinum states that he became a Capuchin in 1572 or 1574, and it is on that basis that he is included in this work. 176ANDRÉ CHAPEAU AND CHARLES BRANSOM 3.1596,... consecrated: Miguel Rangel, Bishop of Congo e Angola, born in the Diocese of Coimbra in 1541; priest in 1581; named 20 May 1596; died 16 August 1602 at Sao Salvador , Congo.3 4.1600,... January, at Paris, Chapel of the Bishopric. Cardinal Pierre de Gondi, Bishop emeritus of Paris, assisted by Arnaud de Pontac, Bishop of Bazas, and by Leger de Pias, Bishop of Lectoure, consecrated: Leonard de Trapes, Archbishop of Auch, born at Nevers; named 3 November 1599; died at Auch 29 October 1629. 5.1602, 1 September, at Nancy. Lothaire von Metternich, Archbishop of Trier, assisted by Cosme Classe, Bishop of Chalons, and by Christophe de La Vallée, Bishop of Toul, consecrated: Eric de Lorraine, Bishop of Verdun, born at Vaudemont 14 May 1576; named 9 June 1593; resigned in 1610; became a Capuchin with an induit dated 24 December 1611; died at Nancy 27 April 1623. 6.1604, 30 May, at Grasse, Cathedral. François Martinego, Bishop of Nice, assisted by Jacques Martin, Bishop of Senez, and by Pierre du Vair, Bishop of Vence, consecrated: Etienne Le Maingre de Boucicault, Bishop of Grasse, born at Aries in 1562; became a Capuchin in the province of St. Louis; became an Observant by pontifical; named 24 March 1604; died at Grasse 17 April 1624.4 3 This prelate is listed in the Hierarchia Catholica as a Capuchin; in the Series Episcoporum, as a Franciscan without any further clarification. The absence of his name from the Lexicon Capuccinum presents a serious question as to his religious community. Since it has not been clarified he is included in the present work. 4 Although not a Capuchin at the time of his consecration, this prelate is included in this work because of his Capuchin origins. He is also included in the Observant list. Franciscan Bishops177 7.1607, 24 February, at Rome, Sistine Chapel. Pope Paul V, assisted by Cardinal Luis de Torres, and by Cardinal Marcello Lante della Rovere, Bishop of Todi, consecrated: Cardinal Anselmo Marzato, Archbishop of Chieti, cardinal 9 June 1604; named 12 February 1607; died at Frascati 17 August 1607. 8.1625, 2 February, at Rome, private papal chapel.
