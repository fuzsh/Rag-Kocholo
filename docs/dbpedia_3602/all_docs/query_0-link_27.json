        "text": "DR Congo came from behind to beat Guinea 3-1 and book a semi-final spot at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nMohamed Bayo put Guinea ahead with a 20th-minute penalty after the forward was fouled by Chancel Mbemba, who then fired in from a narrow angle at the other end to equalise seven minutes later.\n\nDR Congo had a penalty of their own in the second half when Julian Jeanvier clipped the legs of Silas and Brentford forward Yoane Wissa converted to give the Leopards the lead with 25 minutes left.\n\nThe West Africans had little in response after going behind and the result was sealed when Arthur Masuaku's free-kick from wide on the left caught out Guinea goalkeeper Ibrahim Kone at his near post.\n\nDR Congo had drawn all four of their previous games in Ivory Coast, beating Egypt on penalties in the last 16, and now prepare for a first semi-final outing since the Central Africans finished third in 2015.\n\nSebastien Desabre's side will face the winners of Saturday's quarter-final between Mali and hosts Ivory Coast (17:00 GMT) in the last four on Wednesday."
