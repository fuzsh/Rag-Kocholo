Luis Alberto Moreno is a member of the Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center’s Advisory Council. He joined Allen & Co as managing director in February 2021, after concluding his fifteen-year tenure as the president of the Inter-American Development Bank Group. There, he led a profound transformation of the organization while also chairing the board of executive directors of IDB Invest. Prior to that, Moreno served a Colombia’s ambassador to the United States for seven years, during which he helped facilitate unprecedented bipartisan and bilateral assistance programs that supported a radical improvement in security and economic conditions, primarily through the approval of Plan Colombia—an ambitious program to fight drug trafficking and promote social and economic recovery.

Moreno has had a distinguished career in business and government. He served as Colombia’s minister of economic development and was head of the Instituto de Fomento Industrial, Colombia’s public sector holding company. In the private sector, he was the executive producer of TV Hoy, an award-winning broadcast news program, and a strategic advisor to major Colombian companies and foreign investors.
