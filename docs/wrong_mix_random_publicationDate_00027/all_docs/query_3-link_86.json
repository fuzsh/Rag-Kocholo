        "text": "Fisticuffs for Winehouse at British festival\n\nAmy Winehouse was packing a punch at the Glastonbury music festival in London this weekend.\n\nAfter taking the stage Saturday, the troubled singer climbed down into the pit and scuffled briefly with a reveler.\n\nIt was unclear what sparked the altercation but witnesses say a fan tried to grab Winehouse.\n\nShe shocked fans by performing at a special birthday concert for Nelson Mandela.\n\nThe performance came just after she was hospitalized. Her father says she developed emphysema from smoking cigarettes and crack cocaine, although her spokeswoman has said Winehouse only has pre-emphysema symptoms.\n\n‘Velvet Teddy Bear’ weds in Alabama\n\nFormer American Idol Ruben Studdard has married Surata Zuri McCants at a church in a suburb of Birmingham, Ala. But there was no singing during the 30-minute ceremony — just an exchange of vows, prayers and music provided by a string ensemble. A reporter from The Birmingham News attended the ceremony.\n\nThe groom, nicknamed the “Velvet Teddy Bear” on Idol for his big frame and sonorous voice, wore a black tuxedo with white bow tie for Saturday’s ceremony. His bride wore a white and ivory wedding gown.\n\nAlabama will be their home as the 29-year-old-singer gets set to release a new album later this year.\n\nTyler sought ‘safe environment’ in rehab\n\nSteven Tyler sought the “safe environment” of rehab last month to recover from more than just surgery — the Aerosmith frontman now says was fighting a dependency on pain and sleep medication.\n\n“To have your feet done, to have your leg done, you have to be on narcotics,” Tyler told The Associated Press on Friday. “You have to be on sleep aids at night. I don’t know about Joe (Perry) but I was off and running, and I didn’t like the me that was me.”\n\nTyler released a statement in late May saying he checked into a rehab facility in search of a “safe environment” to recover from several foot surgeries and physical therapy. Tyler said the procedures were to correct longtime foot injuries resulting from his physical performances as the singer for the blues-rock band.\n\n“This was a month ago, so I just put the brakes on and checked into detox and just pulled the plug on all of it,” he said.\n\nThe 60-year-old was known for heavy substance abuse in the 1970s and early ’80s, but completed rehab in 1986.\n\n‘WALL-E’ tops box-office competition\n\nA lonely little robot made millions of friends during the weekend — and even outgunned Angelina Jolie.\n\nWALL-E, the Pixar Animation tale of a robot toiling away on a long-abandoned Earth, debuted as the No. 1 movie with $62.5 million in ticket sales, with Jolie’s assassin thriller Wanted opening in second place with $51.1 million.\n\nThe previous weekend’s No. 1 movie, the Warner Bros. comedy Get Smart, slipped to third place with $20 million, raising its total to $77.3 million.\n\nRounding out the top 10 for the weekend at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC:\n\n4. Kung Fu Panda, $11.7 million.\n\n5. The Incredible Hulk,$9.2 million.\n\n6. The Love Guru, $5.4 million.\n\n7. Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, $5 million.\n\n8. The Happening, $3.9 million.\n\n9. Sex and the City, $3.8 million.\n\n10. You Don’t Mess With the Zohan, $3.2 million.\n\n— SUN NEWS SERVICES"
