        "text": "Post by shaq91 on\n\nRuben Studdard shoots 'Together' video in Nashville[/b]\n\nRuben Studdard spent yesterday in Nashville shooting a video for his single Together at the new nightclub Fuse.\n\n“I do a performance in the club, and you’ll see these two workers here that have a relationship,” says American Idol’s second-season winner, who makes the single available as a download today. “It goes through the complexities of what’s going on with them.”\n\n“His voice kind of brings all these people together,” says director Roman White, who previous has done videos for Kelly Clarkson (Don’t Waste Your Time), Josh Gracin (Favorite State of Mind) and Carrie Underwood (pretty much all of them). “We have a primary couple –- kind of a bartender and a waiter -- who work in the nightclub and have been giving each other faraway glances for a long time, always kind of missing each other. Finally, they see each other at the very end and finally find true love. You know, just like it happens in the real world -- just with better lighting and a nice soundtrack.”\n\n“The cool thing about this video is that the focus is not all on me,” Ruben says. “I really like when artists do videos that really aren’t centered on them.”\n\nTogether was written and produced by the Stargate production team,\n\n“It’s a song that talk about how nothing is better than sticking into a relationship and nothing matters other than the person that you’re with, and everything will work out if you just stay together,” Ruben says. “That’s a really good message for a song.”\n\nIt’s the first single from Ruben’s new album, Love Is, which comes out May 19.\n\nRead the rest on Idol Chatter\n\nPost by shaq91 on\n\nRuben Studdard Covers Michael Jackson, Bryan Adams On Love Is\n\n'American Idol' winner also co-wrote a handful of songs on the new album, due May 19.\n\nIt's been almost three years since former \"American Idol\" winner Ruben Studdard has released an album. But the man they call the Velvet Teddy Bear has spent that time cooking up some new tunes and unique covers for his upcoming album, Love Is, which he thinks will lure back his longtime admirers.\n\n\"A lot of people will be pleasantly surprised. ... The music is really good,\" said the laid-back singer, who performed the silky first single \"Together\" on \"Idol\" Thursday night. After parting ways with his longtime label following the disappointing sales of 2006's The Return, Studdard, 30, regrouped and hooked up with two of the most accomplished R&B producers in the business, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis (Janet Jackson, Usher, Mariah Carey), who produced the majority of the new album.\n\n\"I co-wrote four to five of the songs,\" said Studdard, who is releasing the album of love songs through Hickory Records/ 19 Recordings on May 19. \"This time, the record company was willing to let me be more involved in the process. Not to say that J Records wasn't, but the proof is in the pudding!\" Studdard said Jam and Lewis have the unique ability to bring the best out of the artists they work with, and the duo pushed him to go beyond his comfort zone.\n\nThat might explain how he came to cover such nontraditional tunes as hair-metal act Extreme's smash \"More Than Words\" and Canadian rocker Bryan Adams' \"Heaven,\" with an assist on the latter from Boyz II Men.\n\nHe also tackles Michael Jackson's \"I Can't Help It\" on the album, which includes an original tune Studdard co-wrote for his wife called \"A Song for Her.\" Along with Jam and Lewis, the album features co-production from New Jack Swing legend Teddy Riley and Big & Rich's John Rich.\n\nWhile he's been busy touring in a revival of the Fats Waller Broadway musical \"Ain't Misbehavin',\" in which he stars alongside fellow \"Idol\" alums Frenchie Davis and Trenyce, Studdard is looking forward to getting back to being an R&B singer after a rough few years in which he's endured some financial stress due to tax issues, successfully sued a former manager, gotten married and lost more than 100 pounds after once tipping the scales at 450 pounds.\n\n\"It's a lot of work. We dance from top to bottom,\" Studdard said of his eight-show-a-week schedule on \"Misbehavin',\" which he'll be on the road with until May. \"But I'm excited to get back out there and do a promotional tour and do some radio stuff and hopefully after that get some tour dates together.\"\n\nStuddard has also teamed up with the Sickle Cell Anemia Foundation to spearhead the health campaign \"Be Sickle Smart,\" encouraging sufferers of the blood disease — which primarily affects African-Americans — to learn more about maintaining a healthy diet.\n\nwww.mtv.com/news/articles/1607916/20090326/studdard_ruben.jhtml"
