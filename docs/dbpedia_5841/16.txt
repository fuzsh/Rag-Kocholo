Satellite Name: DASH 2

Other Names:

NORAD Catalog Number 00624

Launch Date: 1963-07-19

Launch Time: 03:50:00 UTC

Launch Site/Country: Point Arguello, United States

Launch Vehicle: Atlas-Agena D

On-orbit Dry Mass: 1 kg

Description:

The DASH 2 satellite was a 2.5-m-diameter balloon used to measure air densities at altitudes of approximately 3,500 km. The area-to-mass ratio for the spacecraft was 40 sq cm/g. The orbit, originally circular, increased in eccentricity rapidly under the action of solar radiation pressure. DASH 2 reentered the Earth's atmosphere on 1971 April 12.
