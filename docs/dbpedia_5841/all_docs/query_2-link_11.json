The area-to-mass ratio for the spacecraft was 40 sq cm/g. The orbit, originally circular, increased in eccentricity rapidly under the action of solar radiation pressure. DASH 2 reentered the Earth's atmosphere on 1971 April 12.\n\nMission(s):\n\nEarth Science\n\nSponsoring Agency/Country:\n\nDepartment of Defense—Department of the Air Force/United States\n\nSource: NSSDC Master Catalog"
