        "text": "OV1-20P - . Mass: 70 kg (154 lb). Nation: USA. Agency: USAF STP. Class: Earth. Type: Magnetosphere satellite. Spacecraft: OV1. Decay Date: 1971-08-28 . USAF Sat Cat: 5394 . COSPAR: 1971-067A. Apogee: 1,932 km (1,200 mi). Perigee: 136 km (84 mi). Inclination: 92.00 deg. Period: 105.90 min.\n\nAtlas 76F, with two upper stage Orbital Vehicle propulsion modules, OV1-20 and 0V1-21, was launched from Vandenberg as part of SAMSO's Space Test Program (STP). This mission, STP 70-2, successfully placed six spacecraft with nine separate payloads into polar orbits. Space craft engaged in investigation of spaceflight techniques and technology (US Cat A).\n\nPolar Bear - . Payload: Transit O-16 / P 87-1. Mass: 125 kg (275 lb). Nation: USA. Agency: USAF STP. Class: Earth. Type: Magnetosphere satellite. Spacecraft: Transit. USAF Sat Cat: 17070 . COSPAR: 1986-088A. Apogee: 1,013 km (629 mi). Perigee: 955 km (593 mi). Inclination: 89.60 deg. Period: 104.80 min.\n\nTranist O-17 had been turned over to the National Air and Space Museum in 1976 and was displayed to the public for more than 8 years. In 1984, it was refurbished at APL and launched as the Polar Beacon Experiment and Auroral Research satellite to collect data for studying communications over the Earth's polar regions.\n\nFORTE - . Nation: USA. Agency: USAF STP. Manufacturer: Los Alamos. Class: Technology. Type: Navigation technology satellite. Spacecraft: FORTE. USAF Sat Cat: 24920 . COSPAR: 1997-047A. Apogee: 833 km (517 mi). Perigee: 799 km (496 mi). Inclination: 70.00 deg. Period: 101.20 min.\n\nFORTE - 'Fast On-orbit Recording of Transient Events' - was a US Los Alamos National Laboratory satellite designed to study natural and artificial radio emissions from the ionosphere. This data was needed to develop technology for monitoring nuclear test ban treaties. Air dropped in Point Arguello WADZ.\n\nTSX 5 - . Payload: P95-2. Mass: 247 kg (544 lb). Nation: USA. Agency: USAF STP. Manufacturer: McLean. Class: Surveillance. Type: Military surveillance satellite. Spacecraft: STEP. USAF Sat Cat: 26374 . COSPAR: 2000-030A. Apogee: 1,695 km (1,053 mi). Perigee: 412 km (256 mi). Inclination: 68.94 deg. Period: 106.19 min.\n\nMilitary Technology satellite. Launch delayed from May 20 and June 6. Fifth STEP (Space Test Experiments Program) satellite. The satellite's main section was the STRV-2 experiment module, sponsored by the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and the UK Ministry of Defense. This was to take infrared images of UK military aircraft at perigee, and then downlink data via laser. STRV-2 also carried vibration isolation and debris impact sensors. A secondary payload was the S97-1 CEASE (Compact Environmental Anomaly Sensor). This was an AFRL prototype sensor package to provide warning of spacecraft charging and radiation events. Air dropped in Point Arguello WADZ.\n\nMightysat 2.1 - . Payload: SA-200B. Mass: 120 kg (260 lb). Nation: USA. Agency: USAF STP. Manufacturer: Gilbert. Class: Surveillance. Type: Military surveillance satellite. Spacecraft: SA-200. Decay Date: 2002-11-12 . USAF Sat Cat: 26414 . COSPAR: 2000-042A. Apogee: 581 km (361 mi). Perigee: 547 km (340 mi). Inclination: 97.78 deg. Period: 95.86 min.\n\nMightysat 2.1, also known as Sindri, used a Spectrum Astro SA-200B satellite bus. The spacecraft carried a hyperspectral imager for earth imaging and spectroscopy, as well as satellite technology experiments such as advanced solar arrays. An Aerospace Corp./DARPA picosatellite experiment, consisting of two small boxes connected by a deployable tether, was deployed later. Similar picosats were deployed on the previous Minotaur launch in January 2000."
