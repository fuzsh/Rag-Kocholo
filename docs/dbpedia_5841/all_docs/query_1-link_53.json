        "text": "Mission: Historical reports: Ranger VI was a 365-kg lunar probe that would impact the lunar surface. The only scientific instruments onboard spacecraft were six TV cameras, designed to provide more than 3,000 photographs of the lunar surface during the last 10 min. of the 66-hr. flight. This was the first Ranger launch since October 1962, when extensive review of the Ranger project was undertaken because of previous Ranger failures. For Ranger VI, changes were made in subsystems to improve reliability and provide redundancy in some areas; also, sterilization requirements for Ranger spacecraft were relaxed, since excessive heat was suspected of causing some previous malfunctions. Target for the lunar spacecraft: Sea of Tranquility.\n\nOn 2 February 1964, Ranger VI crashed onto the moon on target in the Sea of Tranquility, but its onboard camera system failed to return TV photographs of the lunar surface. Indications were that the two TV systems responded to Central Computer and Sequencer (CCS~Sc) command to warm up, but the cameras did not complete the warm-up to picture taking. Ranger VIs cameras (two wide-angle and four narrow-angle) were to have made more than 3,000 photographs during its last 10 min. The photographs were to have provided scientific data on lunar topography and supported the Surveyor unmanned soft-landing spacecraft and Apollo manned lunar landing program.\n\nRanger VI impacted the Moon withing 30-km of its target and within one third of a second of the predicted afrival time. Sir Bernard Lovell, Director of Jodrell Bank Experimental Station which tracked Ranger VI on its course to the Moon, said of the spacecrafts accurate impact of the Moon: I think this represents a very great achievement for American rocket engineers. This achievement is underlined by the fact that it is now four and a half years since either the Russians or the Americans have made a direct hit of this nature on the lunar surface, despite repeated attempts. (NASA planned three more Ranger TV flights this year.)\n\nOn 2 April 1964, NASA Administrator, James E. Webb, detailed possible causes of failure of Ranger VI. Although not yet identified any specific cause for failure were identified, Mr. Webb outlined five major faults in the spacecraft: 1. The two oaboard TV systems were more complex than required and were not completely redundant. They included a number of common components in which a single failure would lead to disablement of both television systems. 2. Possibilities of failure increased as a result of practices employed in the design and construction of the spacecraft.  3. Preflight ground testing may have obscured potentially dangerous situations which could have enhanced accidental triggering of critical control circuits. 4. The antenna for transmitting the lunar photographs had never been tested with the TV transmitters. 5. Because of reluctance to risk possible damage to the space vehicle, pre-launch systems verification was not complete. \n\nOn 27 April 1964, Dr. Homer E. Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Sciences and Applications, said before House Subcommittee on NASA Oversight about Project Ranger:  From the outset, the concept was advanced. It was conceived to seize the initiative in space exploration from the Soviet as well as to obtain important information about the moon. Had it succeeded, it certainly would have been a major first for this country, and it may still obtain that objective. The spacecraft itself is quite complex. It is comparable to the most sophisticated launch vehicles in terms of electromechanical system complexity. Launch vehicles developed in this country have typically taken 20 or more flights to achieve 50% reliability. Some have not done much better than this after many more firings. Indeed, we have read recently that last year there were 13 consecutive failures of the Atlas. In addition, the Discoverer project took 13 attempts to recover its first payload from orbit. Polaris experienced 5 initial failures before its first success. Skybolt experienced 5 flights without achieving complete mission success. In each of these projects, partial success in early flights helped improve later flights. Although I believe Skybolt was dropped for other reasons, Atlas, Discoverer, and Polaris all went on to become vital elements in the defense posture of this country.\n\nRanger is going through this same process. We have solved some of our launch vehicle problems to the point where the reliability is improving appreciably. The basic spacecraft bus has been retained and has now demonstrated its capabiIity to deliver a payload to a precise spot on the lunar surface. We now must make the payload work. The payload also is pushing the state of the art in high power television telemetry. This was necessary to obtain high resolution photographs Our reviews of the Ranger system continue to convince us of its capability of performing the mission. While we how we cannot have100% reliability with launch vehicle, spacecraft, or payload, we expect to achieve at least one complete success with the remaining three flights.\n\nRanger is a tough job. Although success has eluded us, it is within our grasp. We must have the fortitude to proceed. Space will only be conquered by those who do have such fortitude. It might be well to point out that our competitors in this area of exploration are not lacking in this respect. It is reported that the Soviet Union has failed in from 15 to 20 consecutive lunar and planetary mission attempts since Lunik IIIphotographed the back side of the moon in 1959.\n\nEven should subsequent Rangers fail through unforeseen causes, we must move ahead. We must look at the totality of the space program. The over-all picture is very good and is most convincing of this countrys capability to successfully complete these undertakings. The trends are all in our favor.  * * * * * Current overview: Ranger VI was a 365-kg (or 362 or 381 kg) lunar probe designed to transmit high-resolution photographs of the lunar surface during the final minutes of flight up to its impact. The spacecraft carried six television cameras, 2 full-scan cameras (one wide-angle and one narrow-angle) and 4 partial scan cameras (two wide-angle, two narrow-angle). The cameras were arranged in two separate chains, each self-contained with separate power supplies, timers and transmitters so as to afford the greatest reliability and probability of obtaining high-quality pictures. No other experiments were carried on the spacecraft.\n\nRangers 6 was the first of the so-called Block III versions of the Ranger spacecraft. It consisted of a hexagonal aluminum frame base, 1.5 meter across, on which was mounted the propulsion and power units, topped by a truncated conical tower which held the TV cameras. Two solar panel wings, each 73.9 cm wide by 153.7 cm long, extended from opposite edges of the base with a full span of 4.6 meters, and a pointable high gain dish antenna. A cylindrical antenna was seated on top of the conical tower. The overall height of the spacecraft was 3.6 meters. (Total research, development, launch, and support costs for the Ranger series of spacecraft (Rangers 1 through 9) was approximately $170 million. )\n\nRanger 6 was injected on a lunar trajectory and the midcourse trajectory correction was accomplished. On 2 February 1964, 65.5 hours after launch, Ranger 6 impacted the Moon on the eastern edge of Sea of Tranquility at 9.358° North, 21.480° East. Unfortunately, no video signal was received and no camera data obtained. A review board determined the most likely cause of failure was due to an arc-over in the TV power system when it inadvertently turned on for 67 seconds approximately 2 minutes after launch during the period of booster-engine separation. Mission: Historical reports: Ranger VII is a 365-kg lunar probe which carried six television cameras to take closeup pictures of the Moon. Earth-Moon flight took 68 hours and 36 minutes, with the pictures taken during the last 15 minutes before craft impacted. Ranger VIIs launching was so accurate that, even without the standard midcourse correction maneuver, the probe would had hit the Moon. However, scientists wanted pictures of the Sea of Clouds region and made on 29 July a midcourse correction to put the craft on its final collision course.\n\nOn 31 July 1964, Ranger VII successfully completed an historic mission by taking 4,316 high-quality close-range photographs of the Moon, in an area northwest of the Sea of Clouds. The closest pictures were snapped 2.3 sec. before impact, at 10.7° south latitude and 20.7° longitude. All six onboard cameras worked properly, sending back photographs of the Moon that improved the resolution of lunar detail as seen from the Earth by a factor of a thousand.\n\nAfter 68.6 hours of flight, Ranger 7 impacted in an area between Mare Nubium and Oceanus Procellarum at 10.63° South latitude and 20.60° West longitude. Impact occurred at 13:25:48.82 UT at a velocity of 9,500 km/h. The spacecraft performance was excellent, returning 4,308 photos.\n\nAt news conference on preliminary results, Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, principal experimenter, said: I would say, in summing up, that the new region of knowledge is in a true sense an extension of the earlier knowledge. I think it shows that the craters continue to occur down to sizes of about three feet [one meter] in diameter, about one foot [30 cm] depth. This clearly implies that we are not dealing here with enormous layers of dust, of very. loose dust, that is, very loose material, where one would not expect any small features to be visible at all. It is not like sand, in other words.  (See the 1964 video Lunar Bridgehead: The Ranger 7 Story.)\n\nOn 1st August 1964, Homer Newell, NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science and Applications, reports that Ranger 7s principal investigators, Dr. Gerard Kuiper and Dr. Eugene M. Shoemaker, had tentatively concluded that because there exists such sharp little craters here on the surface, this indicates that there is not a deep layer of dust in this area. There would be expected to be a layer of dust on the lunar surface there has been much speculation about how deep it would be. Some people had speculated as much as a thousand feet [300 meters]. Many as much as 30 or 4o feet [10 meters]. Others had said no, it cant be. And those who said no, it cant be, Dr. Shoemaker now thinks were right. At least as far as this area is concerned. He adds that:  as far as the Apollo Program is concerned, it confirms that the basic assumptions that they were making about the sort of surface we are going to have to land on is probably correct. Dr. Newell also stated that Ranger 7 amounts to a big jump in lunar science equivalent to the jump that occurred when Galileo turned the telescope on the heavens.\n\nRanger 7 marked the first successful mission from the United States to explore the moon and produced the first close-up photos of the Moon. The achievement was an important step in the space race between the United States and Soviet Union because, for the first time, U.S. feels ahead of U.S.S.R. in an important aspect of the race. President Johnson echoed this sentiment when he declared: We started behind in space. We were making many apologies just a few years ago. We had our failures, but we kept our faith in the ways of freedom, and we did not follow the easy or the inexpensive course. We know this morning that the United States has achieved fully the leadership we have sought for free men I think we can say this morning that this is a victory for peaceful civilian international cooperation in this hour of frustration, when so many people are getting upset at some minor disappointments.\n\nOn a 5 August 1964 briefing, Dr. Gerard Kuiper adds about the nature of the lunar surface: It is not just a loose pile of sand, dust. It has considerable stiffness. it is sort of like snow or a biscuit, a cracker. N evertheless, it looks as if the Moon may have considerable bearing strength. That, however, is something which must be measured with separate equipment. However, we can say that there are not enormous depths, which would simply not have permitted formation of the sharp little craters as we observe them.\n\nOn 28 August 1964, NASA presented Ranger VII press briefing in which refined flight data were announced. Ranger VII impaced on the moon within 19 sec. and 10 km of the planned time and target. It launded in one of the rays from the crater Tycho. Dr. Eugene M. Shoemaker and Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper expressed opinion that the crater rays were lava flows. Dr. Kuiper stated the impact area was not typical of the lunar surface. Of the Ranger VII lunar photographs, he revealed that the photographs resolved objects down to 25-to 40 cm, and the resolution was considered 1,000 times better than the very best Earth-based observation and 5,000 times better than routine Earth-based observation. On the question of the nature of the lunar surface, no firm conclusion was drawn.\n\nResponding to criticism, Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, director of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the Univ. of Arizona and principal scientific investigator on the Ranger project, replied: Ranger was the U.S. pioneering program of deep-space research and accomplished much more than getting the 4,300 lunar photographs. It established the worth and feasibility of the parking orbit and other concepts of space ballistics, power supply, and communication, as well as preparation for Mars and Venus probes The cost of the 4,300 lunar records is therefore not the full $270 million (which moreover includes Rangers VIII and IX, not yet flown) but, say, $50-$100 million. No ground-based effort, even with the 7½-10-m telescope costing over $100 million, would, even in the absence of our disturbing atmosphere, have yielded 100th of the magnification (resolution) obtained in Ranger VII. I definitely know of no better and cheaper way to get high-resolution photographs \n\nOn 18 February 1965, Dr. George E. hlueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, reports: Regarding the lunar surface. the data from Ranger VII have been very helpful. The large area photography has indicated the probability that there are many areas of the moons surface where the design of the lunar excursion module is adequate with respect to surface slope and roughness  Mission: Historical reports: On 4 October 1964, the seventh anniversary of orbiting Sputnik, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin said in Trud interview that U.S.S.R. was preparing a manned space flight: We are working and making studies and are preparing for a new launching. It is not our custom to advertise, but Ill tell you that new and more complicated research work is in store for us.\n\nOn 12 October 1964, U.S.S.R. launched Voskhod I spacecraft with three-man crew: pilot-cosmonaut, Eng. Col. Vladimir Komarov; scientific co-worker cosmonaut, Candidate of Technical Sciences, KonstantinFeoktistov; and physician-cosmonaut, Boris Yegorov. This was historys first multi-manned space flight and marked the entry into space of a scientist and a physician. TASS announced purposes of the space flight were to: test new multiseat manned spacecraft; investigate work capability and interrelationship, in flight, of a group of cosmonauts consisting of specialists from various branches of science and technology; conduct scientific physico-technical research under actual spaceflight conditions; continue study of effects of spaceflight conditions on human organism; and conduct expanded medicobiological investigations under conditions of prolonged flight.\n\nTelevision photographs of the cosmonauts, wearing lightweight woolen suits rather than spacesuits, were received in U.S.S.R. and transmitted both taped and live by TV stations during the day. On its eighth orbit, as the spacecraft passed over U.S., the crew radioed greeting: From aboard the spaceship Voskhod we convey our best wishes to the industrious American people. We wish the people of the United States peace and happiness.\n\nProf. Leonid I. Sedov, Soviet space official, said in Izvestia interview that success of Voskhod I opens up new horizons in space. It now made realistic any plans about building an orbiting space platform, a flying space institute, which could serve as a springboard for further interplanetary expeditions. And Lt. Col. Cosmonaut Pavel Popovich said in TASS interview that flight of Voskhod I was of great significance because our aim is to send space stations to distant planets. Dr. N. M. Sissakian, member of presidium of Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in Paris that U.S.S.R. hoped to present scientific results of Voskhod I space flight to international symposium on manned space flight in Paris next June.\n\nBritish Labor party leader Harold Wilson said Soviet Voskhod I spacecraft was forerunner of missile-launching satellites that would make Polaris missile obsolete. Such space-based weapons, he said, would mean that the all-American deterrent on which Sir Alex Douglas-Home hases his defense argument, will soon be made obsolete by space missile development. (British election was three days away.)\n\nOn 13 October, Voskhod I landed safely after orbiting the Earth for 24 hrs., 17 min. (16 orbits). All three crewmen were reported to be in good condition after Voskhod I landed at the pre-arranged spot. Indications were that the men remained inside the craft to completion of landing. Official announcement asserted that Voskhod I had completed its task before landing and was landing according to schedule. Soviet news report indicated the crew had requested permission to continue the flight for another 24 hours, but Chief Designer had replied that we shall stay within the program.\n\nSpeculation about why Soviet Voskhod I space flight was terminated after 24 hours was proferred by experts around the world. U.S. space engineers generally indicated Soviets operated according to plan by terminating flight when they did. However, officials of other Western countries speculated Voskhod I was brought down prematurely, for reasons variously given as illness among the crew, faulty radio transmitter, and improper orbit. Sen. Clinton P. Anderson (D.-N. Mex.), Chairman of Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences, said, We knew the shot was coming and we had information it would involve a week - thats why they had the doctor along. He suggested technical problems had caused premature ending of trip. Some sources pointed to Soviets own announcement the previous day, which referred to conditions of prolonged flight At least one press analysis, in retrospect, said Voskhod I was perhaps ordered back to Earth because of political events in the Soviet Union - Soviet Premier N. Khrushchev was being removed from office by Presidium of the Communist Party Central Committee -, an occurrence not made public until 15 October 1964 (see Notes below).\n\nAnalyzing impact of Voskhod I flight, John Finney said feeling of U.S. Government officials was that Voskhod I probably was the prelude to a longer flight sometime soon and to the unveiling of a more powerful rocket for launchings. In itself, Voskhod I flight was considered of more psychological than technical significance.\n\nOn 19 October 1964, during the first public appearance of new U.S.S.R. leadership, the principal address was given by CPSU First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, who said: The Soviet Union has still further outstripped the United States of America in the space race. [We] do not regard our space research as an end in itself, as some kind of race. In the great and serious cause of the exploration and development of outer space, the spirit of the frantic gamblers is alien to us. We see in this cause part and parcel of the tremendous constructive work of the Soviet people in conformity with the general line of our party in all spheres of the economy, science and culture in the name of man, for the sake of man. \n\nOn 19 October 1964, NASA Administrator James E. Webb said that he had predicted in 1961 that U.S.S.R. could launch a multi-manned spacecraft on a lunar-orbiting mission - and this might still be attempted soon. He added: Nothing that occurred during the recent three-man flight has caused me to deviate from the prediction I made in 1961.\n\nOn 21 October 1964, Mstislav V. Keldysh, president of Soviet Academy of Sciences, said in Moscow press conference that vehicle used to launch Voskhod I was more powerful than that used before to put into orbit any instruments or astronauts. He said Voskhod I was first of a series but revealed nothing about future flights.\n\nOn his part, cosmonaut Konstantin Feoktistov revealed he had made astronomical observations during the space flight, practicing aeronavigation by means of a sextant. He predicted that on interplanetary flights it will be possible to fix the spaceships position autonomously on board the spaceship. Feoktistov also disclosed Voskhod 1s attitude control system was based on ion propulsion engine. He described its return to Earth as a featherbed landing. Of the spacecrafts landing system, Vladimir Komarov said after parachutes were opened, a second retrorocket was fired to achieve the soft landing. Boris Yegorov disclosed that sharp movements of the head caused slight dizzy sensations, sensations of general discomfort for both him and Feoktistov.\n\nOn 8 November 1964,Pravda disclosed that the three crew members onboard Voskhod I never used seat straps during their 24-hour flight except during the launching and landing stages. These men also said that their craft was equipped with a new control system that made it possible to orient the vehicle even when it was flying on the dark side of the earth.\n\nThe same day, Dr. Thomas B. Weber, formerly at Aerospace Medical Center, Brooks AFB, Tex., said that all space-cabin simulation experiments so far have had to be called off within a few days because of accumulation of toxic elements in the closed atmospheres. This may be the reason Russias recent three-man space flight, which was expected to last several days, ended after only 24 hours. Dr. Weber continued.\n\nOn 15 January 1965, the U.S.S.R. filed a brief report with the International Aviation Federation on the flight of Voskhod I for confirmation of the flight achievements as absolute world records, and of world records in the orbital flight class in multi-seat spacecraft: duration of flight: 24 hrs., 17 min., 0.3 sec.; flight distance: 669,784,027 km; flight height: 408 km; and maximum weight raised to the flight height: 5,320 kg.\n\nIn January 1965, Dr. John M. Keshishian, associate in surgery on the George Washington University School of Medicine faculty, said, following his visit to Russia at the invitation of the Soviet Academy of Science: It is not generally known that just before Voskhod was ordered into reentry, the pulse rate of one cosmonaut dropped to 40. When your pulse rate drops below 40 heartbeats a minute, youre in trouble. The Russians havent said anything about this but it could be another one of the problems their space medicine is encountering for which there seems to be no ready solutions.\n\nFor example, some Russian cosmonauts have suffered severe. hallucinations, both in flight and afterwards. Others have suffered equally severe and, thus far, inexplicable vertigo during which they cant be certain whether the floors coming up to meet them or vice versa, or whether theyre spinning, or the room is. And Russian physicians have found that , . . space flight environment -- possibly weightlessness -- draws calcium from the blood and expels it in the urine.\n\nIn March 1965, Dr. Boris Yegorov reported nothing about any ill effects of spaceflight conditions, but did say: Several times, we tried to break away from the chair and hang a bit in the cabin. I must tell you that its far from a pleasant sensation. Its also entirely inconvenient to sleep thus. One tries rather to lean on something: either with his head against ceiling or with his feet against the chair. During weightlessness, its much more pleasant to be tied to the chair During the time, we worked none of us had any unpleasant sensations because of weightlessness: we felt fine. * * * * * Current overview: Voskhod 1 was a 5,320-kg piloted spaceship which carried the first three-men crew into space. (It was the first multi-manned flight and first to carry a scientist and a physician into space.) Crew members were Vladimir Komarov, command pilot, Boris Yegorov, physician, and Konstatin Feoktisov, scientist. This mission was designed to test the new multi-seat spacecraft, to investigate the capacity of a group of cosmonauts who were specialists in different disciplines of science and engineering, to conduct physical and technical experiments, and to perform an extensive medical-biological investigation program. During the flight, live TV pictures were returned. This mission was also designed to upstage the upcoming Gemini and Apollo programs. The cosmonauts risk their life during a very risky spaceflight with no spacesuits, ejection seats or escape tower. The mission was a success and had a significant worldwide impact, in particular In the United States and for the \"space race\"."
