        "text": "Landform in Santa Barbara County, California\n\nPoint Arguello (Spanish: Punta Argüello)[1][2] is a headland on the Gaviota Coast, in Santa Barbara County, California, near the city of Lompoc.[3] The area was first used by the United States Navy in 1959 for the launch of military and sounding rockets. It was transferred to the United States Air Force in 1964,[4] at which time it became part of Vandenberg Air Force Base.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1769, the Spanish Portola expedition became the first Europeans to explore this area by land. Soldiers of the expedition named a nearby point Los Pedernales or Punta Pedernales, because they found flints there.[6] The point was given that name on some early maps, but in 1792 British naval explorer George Vancouver dubbed it Point Arguello for José Darío Argüello, a Spanish frontier soldier who was Commandant of the Presidio of Santa Barbara and acting governor of Alta California.[7]\n\nUSS Edith wrecked off Point Argüello in 1849.[8]\n\nA High-frequency direction finding (HFDF) was established here by the Navy during World War II. These radio intercept sites along the coast could track Japanese warships and merchant marine vessels as far away as the Western Pacific. The other stations in California were at Farallon Islands, Point Saint George, and San Diego. Bainbridge Island, Washington also hosted a station.[9]\n\nLaunch pads\n\n[edit]\n\nRockets listed in italics were launched from the complex after its transfer to Vandenberg Air Force Base in 1964.\n\nOriginal Designation Later Designation\n\n(Vandenberg Air Force Base, from 1966) Rockets LC-1-1 SLC-3W Atlas-Agena\n\nThor-Agena\n\nThorad-Agena\n\nAtlas E/F LC-1-2 SLC-3E Atlas-Agena\n\nAtlas E/F\n\nAtlas H\n\nAtlas IIAS\n\nAtlas V LC-2-3 SLC-4W Atlas-Agena\n\nTitan IIIB\n\nTitan 23G LC-2-4 SLC-4E Atlas-Agena\n\nTitan IIID\n\nTitan 34D\n\nTitan IV\n\nFalcon 9 PALC-A N/A Sounding rockets PALC-B N/A Sounding rockets LC-C PLC-C Sounding rockets PALC-D SLC-5 Scout\n\nPALC-A\n\n[edit]\n\nLaunch Complex A or LC-A at the Point Arguello Naval Air Station in California, United States, subsequently Point Arguello Launch Complex A or PALC-A at the Vandenberg Air Force Base, is a launch complex that was used for a number of sounding rocket launches between 1959 and 1966. It was originally built as Launch Complex A or LC-A at the Point Arguello Naval Air Station, and was subsequently transferred to Vandenberg Air Force Base as PALC-A following the merger of Point Arguello into Vandenberg AFB in 1964.\n\nBlue Scout Junior, Astrobee, Black Brant, DAC Roc, Honest John-Nike-Nike, Javelin, Journeyman, Nike-Asp and Seagull rockets were launched from the complex whilst it was active.\n\nLaunch History\n\n[edit]\n\nDate/Time (GMT) Rocket Mission Remarks 14 July 1959, 17:45 Nike-Asp 17 July 1959, 17:40 Nike-Asp Failed 24 July 1959, 16:34 Nike-Asp 7 August 1959, 17:05 Nike-Asp 14 August 1959, 16:00 Nike-Asp 22 August 1959, 02:30 Nike-Asp 24 August 1959, 22:47 Nike-Asp 28 August 1959, 16:10 Nike-Asp 31 August 1959, 22:53 Nike-Asp 1 September 1959, 01:01 Nike-Asp 1 September 1959, 19:00 Nike-Asp 2 September 1959, 00:03 Nike-Asp 19 September 1960, 16:35 Journeyman 1 August 1961, 20:18 Astrobee-1500 15 November 1961, 13:42 Journeyman 18 November 1961, 13:42 Journeyman 4 December 1961, 04:00 Blue Scout Junior O-2 8 December 1961 Astrobee-1500 31 May 1962, 17:08 Blue Scout Junior SLV-1C ERCS 279L-1 9 July 1962 Journeyman 24 July 1962, 17:29 Blue Scout Junior SLV-1C ERCS 279L-2 21 November 1962, 18:20 Blue Scout Junior SLV-1C ERCS 279L-3 19 December 1962 Blue Scout Junior SLV-1B 2 February 1963, 06:56 Blue Scout Jr SLV-1C ERCS 279L-4 12 February 1963, 01:47 Journeyman 14 March 1963, 01:01 Blue Scout Junior SLV-1C ERCS 279L-5 17 May 1963, 23:00 Blue Scout Junior SLV-1C ERCS 279L-6 1 July 1963 Black Brant III 24 October 1963 DAC Roc 7 November 1963 Black Brant III 18 November 1963 Honest John-Nike-Nike HAD-1 10 December 1963 DAC Roc 20 December 1963 Seagull 6 February 1964 Honest John-Nike-Nike HAD-2 Failed 14 March 1964 Honest John-Nike-Nike HAD-3 29 August 1964, 09:36 Blue Scout Junior SLV-1B 22 December 1964, 04:00 Blue Scout Junior Failed - premature third stage cutoff 19 March 1966, 12:31 Javelin HITAB-1 25 March 1966, 09:42 Javelin HITAB-2\n\nPALC-B\n\n[edit]\n\nLaunch Complex B or LC-B at the Point Arguello Naval Air Station in California, United States was a launch complex which was used for twenty three sounding rocket launches between 1960 and 1963.
