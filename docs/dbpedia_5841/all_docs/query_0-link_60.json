One of the events that might generate a large number of debris is the in-orbit explosion. Within this complex framework, it is of paramount importance to use a monitoring and surveillance system to understand the number and the distribution of fragments, in an area around the Earth extremely populated by man-made objects. This entails a growing international interest in Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST), where optical observation stands out as an interesting method to obtain information about orbital objects. In this paper, the Sapienza Space Systems and Space Surveillance Laboratory (S5Lab) presents the results of an observing/observational/observation campaign focused on the energetic characterization of the explosion and the monitoring of the fragments generated by a low orbit explosion of the third stage of the Rus..."
