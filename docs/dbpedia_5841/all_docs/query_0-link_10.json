        "text": "Three additional backup Apollo missions studied - . Nation: USA. Related Persons: Kraft. Program: Apollo. Flight: Apollo 8.\n\nDirector of Flight Operations Christopher C. Kraft, Jr., said that MSC had been directed by NASA OMSF to outline technical problems and both cost and schedule impact of adding three backup Apollo missions to the planned flight schedule. The missions to be evaluated would be AS-207/208 or AS-206/207; AS-503D; and AS-503F. Each of these missions would provide alternate means of obtaining primary program objectives in the event of flight contingencies during tests or of major schedule adjustments. Additional Details: here....\n\nSpace and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO) created. - . Spacecraft: ABRES.\n\nThe functions and personnel of Space Systems Division and Ballistic Systems Division were combined to form the new Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO). Major General Paul T. Cooper, former SSD commander, becoming Deputy Commander for Space, and Major General John L. McCoy, the last BSD commander, becoming Deputy Commander for Missiles. Headquarters SAMSO took over SSD headquarters while General McCoy remained at Norton AFB with the Minuteman and Advanced Ballistic Reentry Systems (ABRES) program offices.\n\nIDCSP 3-1 - . Payload: IDCSP 16 / OPS 9331. Mass: 45 kg (99 lb). Nation: USA. Agency: USAF. Class: Communications. Type: Military communications satellite. Spacecraft: IDCSP. USAF Sat Cat: 2862 . COSPAR: 1967-066A. Apogee: 33,515 km (20,825 mi). Perigee: 33,030 km (20,520 mi). Inclination: 11.90 deg. Period: 1,309.60 min.\n\nA Titan IIIC booster (Vehicle #14) launched from Cape Canaveral placed a multiple payload of six satellites into orbit. Three of the satellites completed the Pacific link of the Initial Defense Satellite Communication System (IDSCS) program between Washington D.C., and South Vietnam. A fourth was a special communications satellite, the Despun Antenna Test Satellite (DATS), designed to test a despun antenna system for possible use on future communications satellites. DATS was designed to transmit 75 percent of radio signal strength to earth stations compared to the 15 percent for previous systems. Also included in the payload were a Defense Department Gravity Gradient Experiment (DODGE) satellite and a Lincoln Experimental Satellite, LES-5, the first all solid-state Ultra-high Frequency (UHF) band communication satellite intended to test communications with frontline troops. Space craft engaged in investigation of spaceflight techniques and technology (US Cat A).\n\nDODGE 1 - . Mass: 102 kg (224 lb). Nation: USA. Agency: USN NASC. Class: Technology. Type: Gravity gradient technology satellite. Spacecraft: DODGE. USAF Sat Cat: 2867 . COSPAR: 1967-066F. Apogee: 33,670 km (20,920 mi). Perigee: 33,257 km (20,664 mi). Inclination: 12.00 deg.

Related Persons: Borman.\n\nBorman was to arrive with his wife and two sons (ages 15 and 17). There is lots of high-level interest in the visit and meetings. They are unsure -- is Borman just a visiting astronaut or an official representative of the American aggressors? Borman's plane makes an emergency landing in Canada when an engine fails en route. His late arrival wrecks Kamanin's carefully-laid out schedule for his trip. Kamanin notes that in June 1968 the VVS suffered four times the accident rate as a year earlier. Two An-12's, one An-12 and an Il-14, and two Tu-22's were lost in three midair collisions, costing 131 lives.\n\nSoyuz 11 capsule evaluated at landing site. - . Nation: Russia. Related Persons: Dobrovolsky, Patsayev, Volkov. Program: Salyut. Flight: Soyuz 11. Spacecraft Bus: Soyuz. Spacecraft: Soyuz 7KT-OK.\n\nAt 05:00 specialists arrive from Moscow to the Soyuz 11 landing site to test the hermetic seal of the cabin. By 08:00 the pressure tests of the cabin show a slight loss, but it takes 1.5 hours for the cabin to fully depressurise. There are no cracks or holes in the cabin. Therefore the only cause could be the two air valves. The medical experts have already determined that the cosmonauts died from depressurisation of the spacecraft. The crew have haemorrhages in their brains, blood in their lungs, and nitrogen in their blood. The flight recorder shows that four seconds after the depressurisation began Dobrovolsky's breathing rate went to 48/minute (normally 16/minute), asphyxiation began, and 20 to 30 seconds later he was dead. By 19:30 Kamanin is in Moscow, and he sees the bodies laying in state at 21:40. They are cremated at 22:00.\n\nGorizont 23 - . Payload: Gorizont s/n 34L. Mass: 2,125 kg (4,684 lb). Nation: Russia. Agency: MOM. Class: Communications. Type: Civilian communications satellite. Spacecraft Bus: KAUR-3. Spacecraft: Gorizont . Completed Operations Date: 1992-06-24 . USAF Sat Cat: 21533 . COSPAR: 1991-046A. Apogee: 36,188 km (22,486 mi). Perigee: 36,158 km (22,467 mi). Inclination: 6.80 deg. Period: 1,455.90 min.\n\nStationed at 103 deg E. Maintenance of telephone and telegraph radio communications and transmission of television broadcasts. Positioned in geosynchronous orbit at 103 deg E in 1991-1992 As of 5 September 2001 located at 159.68 deg E drifting at 4.917 deg W per day. As of 2007 Mar 10 located at 0.82W drifting at 4.909W degrees per day.\n\nSTS-57 - Wakeup Song: I'll Be Home For Christmas - . Flight: STS-57.\n\n\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\" The mission was extended twice to wait for acceptable landing weather in Florida. On July 1st if the weather was acceptable it would land in Florida, otherwise it would be sent to California. So it wasn't a question of whether they would land that day but where. Of course after that many delays the crew may have wondered when they would finally make it home... Capcom Susan Helms played\"I'll Be Home For Christmas\". Given that it was July 1st they presumably did make it home in time.\n\nSTS-94 - . Call Sign: Columbia. Crew: Crouch, Gernhardt, Halsell, Kilrain, Linteris, Thomas, Voss, Janice. Payload: Columbia F23 / Spacelab LM Unit 1 / EDO. Mass: 115,900 kg (255,500 lb). Nation: USA. Related Persons: Crouch, Gernhardt, Halsell, Kilrain, Linteris, Thomas, Voss, Janice. Agency: NASA Houston. Manufacturer: Bremen. Program: STS. Class: Manned. Type: Manned spaceplane. Flight: STS-94. Spacecraft Bus: Shuttle. Spacecraft: Columbia. Duration: 15.70 days.

Period: 90.50 min.\n\nSTS-94 was the reflight, with the same equipment and crew, of the curtailed STS-83 mission. Cargo Bay Payloads:\n\nMSL-1: The Microgravity Science Laboratory included the first test of the International Space Station's EXPRESS Rack. MSL-1 also contained numerous other experiment payloads to test materials and combustion processes in zero gravity.\n\nCRYOFD: The Cryogenic Flexible Diode (CRYOFD) heat pipe was a Hitchhiker payload.\n\nOARE: The Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment was a self-calibrating instrument that monitored extremely small accelerations and vibrations experienced during orbit of the Shuttle.\n\nIn-Cabin Payloads: SAREX, MSX\n\nThe mission this time went for its full two week duration and the crew completed the full list of experiments. The deorbit burn was on July 17, 1997 at 09:44 GMT and Columbia landed on KSC's Runway 33 at 10:46:34 GMT."
