        "text": "Introduction\n\nWhy Fighters Are Worthless\n\nI know all you Battlestar Galactica fans are not going to want to hear it, but looking from a cost/benefit analysis, space fighter craft do not make any sense. Go to the Future War Stories blog and read the post Hard Science Space Fighters.\n\nAnd before you rage at me for taking away your cherised X-Wing you might want to review the section on Respecting Science.\n\nKen Burnside tells it like it is:\n\nWhy Fans Cling So Desperately\n\nWhy do spacefighter fans cling so determinedly? The simple answer is that at a young age fans imprinted on space fighters. In other words it is a case of computer baby duck syndrome.\n\nWhy is there a constant stream of media science fiction featuring space fighters, readily available for new fans to imprint on? I suspect what Charles Stross calls \"Second Artist Effect.\" The first artist sees a landscape and paints what they see; the second artist sees the first artist's work and paints that, instead of a real landscape. In this case the first artist is George Lucas in 1977 with his World War 2 X-Wings and T.I.E. Fighters.\n\nBut it might be a bit more complicated. Here's my reasoning:\n\nIt seems to me that the space fighter is nothing more that people taking a dramatic and comfortable metaphor (sea-going aircraft carriers and combat fighter aircraft) and transporting it intact into the outer space environment. But if you think about it, interplanetary combat is highly unlikely to be like anything that has occurred before.\n\nHere's an analogy: Imagine a speculative fiction writer back in the Victorian era, such as Jules Verne. Say they wanted to write a novel about the far future, when heavier than air flight had been invented, and the age of Aerial Combat had arrived.\n\nThey might take the dramatic and comfortable metaphor of sea-going frigates and battleships and transporting it intact into the aerial environment. Held aloft by dozens of helicopter blades, the battleships of the air would ponderously maneuver, trying to \"cross the T\" with the enemy aerial dreadnoughts.\n\nSee how silly it sounds? Well, combat spacecraft behaving like fighter aircraft is just as silly. In both cases a metaphor is being forced into a situation where it does not work.\n\nIn reality, when the Wright brothers invented heavier-than-air flight and Fokker Triplanes started dog-fighting Sopwith Camels, it was totally unlike anything that had occurred before. Biplanes never ever tried to cross the T, and a sea-going battleship had never ever performed an Immelmann turn.\n\nTherefore, by analogy, when interplanetary combat arrives, it too will be totally unlike anything that has occurred before.\n\nAs Ken Burnside puts it:\n\nJustifications For Fighters\n\nWhile space fighters in general are pretty worthless, it is possible for an author to establish a specialized situation making them practical.\n\nAs Ken Burnside said: \"What do fighters do better than, or exclusively related to, larger ships? Answer this, and you get a reason for fighters in a setting.\"\n\nIf the author has already allowed handwaving faster-than-light travel into their literary universe, it should be straightforward enough to tweak it such to allow the existence of spacefighters. TV Tropes says just use Applied Phlebotinum or Minovsky Physics.\n\nOne example using handwaving faster-than-light starships is the Traveller Battle-Rider.\n\nAnother example are the fighter starship of William H. Keith's Star Carrier series. They use a handwaving carrot-on-a-stick drive, accelerating at 50,000 g and reaching relativistic velocity in about ten minutes flat. So sorry, huge capital ships and carriers cannot use this marvelous propulsion system, so they cannot act like fighters. Sadly while the carrot drive's gravity gradient across a twenty meter fighter is negligible, it will rip apart a one kilometer battleship with tidal forces.\n\nTV Tropes Analysis\n\nCulture\n\nJack Staik makes the case for space fighters existing due to sheer inertia and entrenched cultural bias. Cue Tevye singing the song \"Tradition\".\n\nHowever, culture only goes so far. Currently (2012) in Afghanistan, the US Air Force is used to attack partisan forces. But more and more the attacks are carried out by remotely piloted drones, not by valiant Top Gun piloted fighter aircraft.\n\nThe Air Force pilots are quite angry about this. They are angry that their role is shrinking, they are angry that their chances of flying exciting missions grow slim, they are angry that fat-bottomed desk-jockys controlling a drone from an office in New Mexico are called \"fighter pilots\" just like them, they are just angry.\n\nBut culture or no, in 2011 the Air Force said it trained more drone pilots than fighter and bomber pilots combined.\n\nIn 2016 things got worse for human fighter pilots. Researchers developed software that (in computer simulations) reliably defeated human pilots. So instead of being replace by a fat-bottomed desk-jocky, they are being replaced by a computer.\n\nCarriers/Mothership\n\nKeeping with the World War 2 motif, if military aircraft translate into space fighters, then aircraft carriers translate into space carriers. Basically a mobile fighter base, containing launch and recovery facilities and all the logistics needed for fighter resupply. Militarily it is a capital ship where the weapons operate at some distance from the main ship.\n\nScience fiction writers commonly use the historical Battle of Midway as their model for combat. Since there were no orbital reconnaissance satellites in 1941, the carrier groups on both sides of the conflict spent most of their time trying to find the tiny motes of hostile ships lost in a giant ocean. They sent out waves of scout aircraft to play needle-in-the-haystack with enemy battle groups. When they finally found the enemy, then the friendly carriers would launch ship-killer aircraft to try and elude the hostile combat air patrol and blow the enemy carriers out of the water with torpedoes. In Midway, the carrier groups were about 1,000 kilometers apart, way over the horizon. The ships never saw each other, just hostile aircraft.\n\nWhich is exactly like space carriers and space fighters. Except there are reconnaissance satellites, carriers groups on both sides will always know where the hostile ships are down to the millimeter, scouts are not needed, there is no horizon in space, and the ships will see each other (abet through a telescope).\n\nThe science fiction author can alter the situation to more closely mirror the Battle of Midway model if they must, generally by adding weird constraints to the ship's faster-than-light propulsion. The most popular constraint is on faster-than-light radar. It needs to exist, but the range has to be adjusted. What you want is to reproduce the detection capabilities of the Battle of Midway: detection at conventional radar ranges exists but not detection over the entire freaking Pacific ocean like orbital reconnaissance satellites. Pacific ocean is about 15,500 km wide, carrier radar can see 4.7 km to the horizon, scouts have a range of about 1,000 km but can only spot something within 200 km of the scout.\n\nFleet Carriers\n\nHaving space carriers being motherships to space fighters like an outer space version of the Battle of Midway is somewhat dubious from a hard science standpoint.\n\nBut if you scale it up a bit so that the fighters are more like full scale space warships, and the carrier is more like a titanic interstellar propulsion unit (slower-than-light or faster-than-light), then it makes more logical sense.\n\nThe idea is that the interstellar propulsion, if present in every single warship, will consume an unwelcome portion of the ship's mass budget. Meaning that an almost identical non-interstellar warship design can replace the stardrive mass with more weapons and defenses. The non-stardrive warship can beat the pants off its stardrive cousin.\n\nIn the role-playing-game Traveller, such non-stardrive ships are called System Defense Boats. Their advantage is they are cheaper or more heavily armed compared to equivalent stardrive ships. The disadvantage is they are a pain in the posterior to move between star systems.\n\nTo counter this, the solution is the Fleet Carrier. It is a huge mothership which carries lots of system defense boats. The advantage is that the fleet carried will also be system defense boats and thus be on an even footing with the system's defense fleet. The disadvantage is that if the mothership is destroyed, the invading fleet is up doo-doo-pulsar with no gravity generator.\n\nHegemony Interceptors\n\nHegemony is hardSF novel by Mark Kalina. I know it is hard because he used this website as reference.\n\nThe space carriers are called Lance ships. The fighters are called interceptors.\n\nThe Lance ships not only ferry the interceptors into battle, but they are the interceptor's power supply. The Lance ships have six huge laser arrays. In addition to being used as laser weapons, some can be tasked to energize the laser thermal engines on the interceptors. Laser thermal engines are incredibly lightweight compared to most other rocket engines, giving the interceptors a huge thrust-to-weight ratio, which in turn gives fanatastic acceleration. This gives the interceptors much greater maneuverability than a Lance ship, and makes them very hard to be targeted by hostile weapons fire.\n\nThe draw-back is that the interceptor's power plant is not present in the interceptor, it is back on the Lance mothership. If anything happens to the Lance, or if the Lance needs all its lasers to defend itself, the interceptor might suddenly find its laser thermal engines inoperable. For such emergencies the interceptor has an auxiliary rocket engine with a very limited supply of fission pellets.\n\nThe Lance's lasers can focus sharply enough to be used as weapons to damage enemy targets up to range X (until diffraction spreads the beam too much). But the lasers can energize interceptor engines at a longer range than X because the engines can utilize a more diffuse beam. In addition the interceptor has lightweight laser combat mirrors which can focus diffuse Lance laser beams down to ship-destroying pin-points on the enemy.\n\nThe interceptors also carry loads of bomb-pumped x-ray lasers.\n\nInterceptors cannot carry human pilots since 100+ g accelerations would kill them in a fraction of a second. But the interceptors must carry human pilots because of Burnside's First Law (the SciFi novel readers hate reading stories about the Adventures of Droney, the unmanned combat aerial vehicle). Mr. Kalina's solution is that the pilots are carried onboard the interceptors, for certain values of \"carried.\" The pilot's brain patterns are digitally uploaded into the interceptor's computer. The digital pattern contains the pilot's consciousness, memories, and combat skill. But it does not contain squishy brains, breakable bones, and rupturable organs; so it is immune to high g acceleration. If the digital pilot thinks that destruction of the interceptor is imminent, it will attempt to upload itself back to the mothership.\n\nBDM Carrier\n\nThis is more a carrier with a load of planetary exploration ships, as opposed to a load of deadly combat fighters. However, the \"shoot down threatening meteor\" function would work equally well as a \"shoot down hostile warship\" function. For a BDM carrier optimised for combat fighters, see here.\n\nBDM Battlecruiser\n\nThis is a combat warship with a honking huge laser. It can use the laser to energize the laser thermal engines of Monocle Fighters, so that the fighters can boost payloads into orbit. Or so the fighters can act as mobile laser combat mirrors. The battlecruiser carries a combat wing of monocle fighters.\n\nThe fighters use laser power from the battlecruiser to maneuver close to the enemy. They then angle their combat mirror, and the battlecruiser does a bank shot off the mirror and into the enemy ship.\n\nThe battlecruiser has three rotating bed particle nuclear reactors with a total output of 7.5 gigawatts of thermal energy for a few seconds at a time. How much of that energy can be converted into laser energy by the free-electron laser is unclear. Probably a few gigawatts. Laser efficiencies been as poor as they are, the battlecruiser needs huge heat radiators.\n\nYou can find more details here.\n\nTraveller Battle Riders\n\nThe role-playing game Traveller has an interesting variant on the The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation.\n\nIn our real-world universe where combat spacecraft use rockets for propulsion, spacecraft are huge propellant tanks with an engine at one end and some weapons bolted on. Orbital bases are not subject to the Rocket Equation Tyranny, since they have no rockets. So they can take the design mass budget ordinarily consumed by propellant and engines and instead use it for more weapons. Which means an orbital base out-guns a combat spacecraft of the same mass by several orders of magnitude.\n\nIn the Traveller universe, however, spacecraft use a handwaving reactionless drive (\"maneuver drive\"). Which means the Rocket Equation Tyranny does not apply to Traveller warships.\n\nWith one important exception.\n\nYou see, Traveller maneuver drives are only used for interplanetary travel, between planets in a given solar system. For interstellar travel, you have to use a faster-than-light \"jump drive\". As it turns out jump drives are subject to a limited form of the Rocket Equation Tyranny. They require absolutely huge amounts of hydrogen.\n\n(What the hydrogen is required for is unclear. If it is used in a fusion reactor it means the smallest tramp freighter in Traveller in one jump burns 20 tons of hydrogen producing 380,000 megawatt-years of power, or about 160% of the energy the US produces in a single year. This is why some Traveller fans are retconing that the hydrogen is needed as coolant or something.)\n\nThe Jump-drive Equation Tyranny has two main effects on Traveller spacecraft combat.\n\nFirst off, it creates a ship type called a System Defense Boat. They are warships with no jump drives nor huge jump drive hydrogen tanks. So like orbital bases they are more heavily armed than a combat starship of equal mass. System defense boats are also quicker and easier to build, since weapons are less difficult to construct than complicated jump drives. Not to mention all the expensive Lanthanum required for a jump drive. Large system defense boats are called \"monitors\".\n\nThe main draw-back to system defense boats is they are a major headache to shift between solar systems. For obvious reasons.\n\nWhich leads us to the second major effect on Traveller spacecraft combat. I give you the Battle Rider.\n\nWhat you do is basically make a detachable jump drive. This takes the form of a \"Jump Tender\" which is a large framework capable of carrying multiple large system defense boats (called \"battle riders\"), along with a freaking huge jump drive and lots of hydrogen tanks. The tender typically carries six to eight battle riders. The jump tender transports itself and all of its child battle riders into a hostile solar system.\n\nAfter entering the hostile system the battle riders detach and leap into battle with the hostile local system defense boats (or even better, with the hostile combat starships). The jump tender runs away from the battle and hides in a location it hopes is safe. It returns to its children once the battle is over. Or it escapes by jumping out system if all its children are killed.\n\nThe advantage is that the battle riders will be evenly matched against hostile system defense boats and will have an actual advantage against hostile combat starships. Also, spending your ship building budget on battle riders increases the number of spinal mount weapons you will get for your warship dollar (because each warship can only have one spinal mount. More warships per dollar = more spinal mounts per dollar). Due to the way the Traveller game mechanics treat spinal mounts, the side with the larger number of spinal mounts tend to win the battles.\n\nThe disadvantage is the cost of of building the jump tender. And the fact that if the hostiles manage to obliterate the tender, the battle riders will be up doo-doo pulsar with no gravity generator. The battle riders will be trapped in the solar system with no way out. Pure combat starships can concentrate on the battle at hand, they do not have to always be simultaneously trying to protect their jump tender. The tender is the \"Achilles heel\" of a battle rider squadron.\n\nEven if the jump tender is safe, it still makes it difficult for the battle riders to escape a battle gone wrong by jumping outsystem.\n\nIf a group of combat starship jump into a system, advance into combat, then suddenly discover that they are seriously outnumbered, escape is possible by simply activating their jump drives and fleeing to another solar system.\n\nIf a group of battle riders discovers that they are heading into a futuristic reenactment of Custer's Last Stand, they have to\n\nRetreat under fire while suffering losses\n\nFight a running battle back to the mother jump tender\n\nHope they can latch on and be jumped outsystem before the hostiles scrag the jump tender\n\nOr they can bravely do their best General Custer impressions and heroically allow the jump tender to escape.\n\nThe battle-rider concept has some vague similaries to Dean Ing's detachable fuel torus.\n\nThere have been a few articles written on the topic of \"battle riders vs. Battleships\" in various Traveller publications. The last I read the consensus was that the battle rider concept looks nice on paper but is at a disadvantage in real combat.\n\nSome of the analysis suggests that it is more cost effective to have each jump tender only carry a single battle rider, to avoid stranding six to eight battle riders with the destruction of one jump tender. However this defeats the \"maximizing number of spinal mounts\" advantage.\n\nOthers suggest using combat starships on the front line and holding battle riders in reserve. This means battle riders called into a battle underway will be jumping into a known situation instead of possibly being fatally surprised.\n\nBut If You Must They Act Like This\n\nIf you just can't live without your T.I.E. fighter (or if you are an author pandering to your audience) you might as well get the rest of the science correct anyway. Think up some justification to allow space fighters to exist, then try to live within the draconian constraints.\n\nKeep in mind that even if you have space fighters, they are not going to fly like winged fighters in an atmosphere. I don't care how the X-wing and Viper space fighters maneuvered. It is impossible to make swooping maneuvers without an atmosphere and wings.\n\nNo such thing as space dog fighting with banking turns. Not yours.\n\nYou also cannot turn on a dime. The faster the ship is moving, the wider your turns will be. Your spacecraft will NOT move like an airplane, it will act more like a heavily loaded 18-wheeler truck moving at high speed on a huge sheet of black ice.\n\nAnd another thing: if you maneuver, you are NOT going to be slammed into walls by high gee forces like a NASCAR race car driver. It doesn't work that way unless you have an atmosphere and wings. The only thing you will feel is a force in the same direction that the rocket exhaust is shooting, which will be equal to magnitude to the acceleration the engine is producing. Since Rockets Are Not Boats, the force generally be in the direction the crew considers as \"down\", as defined by the rocket's design. It will never be \"sideways\" (except under silly situations, like occupying a spinning centrifugal gravity ring while the rocket is accelerating).\n\nIt doesn't matter if you are thrusting in some other direction that the rocket's direction of travel (see Rockets Are Not Arrows) nor does it matter the rocket's current velocity (relative to what?). If the rocket engine cannot provide more than 0.5 gs of acceleration, the crew is never going to feel more than 0.5 gs of acceleration. Even if the ship is moving at a large fraction of the speed of light.\n\nFighter Roles\n\nFighter Missions\n\nASTEROID ZERO-FOUR\n\nIn the simplified board game Asteroid Zero-Four, the US and the USSR each have a valuable asteroid to mine. And each asteroid is armed to the teeth to ensure that it stays in the owner's possession. A prologned solar storm cuts both asteroids off from Terra, so the asteroids have a private little nuclear war to capture the other asteroid.\n\nThe two sides attack each other with:\n\nInter-Asteroidal Ballistic Missiles with MIRVed nuclear warheads\n\nFighter spacecraft (lots of anti-fighter weapons, limited nuclear bomb capability)\n\nBomber spacecraft (limited anti-fighter weapons, large nuclear bomb capability)\n\nFighter-bomber mulirole spacecraft (intermediate amount of anti-fighter weapons, intermediate nuclear bomb capability)\n\nAnti-fighter laser installations on asteroid\n\nUSSR has fighters and bombers, US only has fighter-bombers. Both have IABMs and anti-fighter laser installations. There are a variety of nuclear bomb loadouts that a spacecraft can be armed with, only spacecraft on a \"Strike\" mission have bombs installed. During each turn, each player takes their fighters that are ready (not currently being refueled and reloaded) and secretly allocates them among the mission types. They also launch IABMs to add to the STRIKE mission, number of missiles limited to number of undestroyed launch silos.\n\nThe missions are:\n\nSTRIKE (S): IABMs separate into MIRVed bombs and explode on their designated targets on the enemy asteroid. Spacecraft drop their nuclear bombs on their designated targets on the enemy asteroid and return to home base, while undergoing weapons fire from the asteroid's laser ack-ack batteries.\n\nCOMBAT SPACE PATROL (CSP): defend your asteroid from incoming hostile spacecraft and IABMs.\n\nEach of your spacecraft on CSP engages in combat with one of the incoming hostile spacecraft on a STRIKE ESCORT mission. The hostile ships on SE can return fire.\n\nIf you have more ships on CSP than the hostiles have on SE, the remainder can attack hostile IABMs and enemy ships on S missions on a one-on-one basis. The poor enemy ships cannot return fire, they are focusing on bombing.\n\nIf you have less ships on CSP, the enemy strike goes streaking past you. There it dumps bombs on your base while your CSP is tangled up dealing with the enemy SE.STRIKE ESCORT (SE): defend your friendly spacecraft on S missions from enemy spacecraft on CSP mission.\n\nSTRIKE HOLDING (SH): Ships held in reserve to throw the enemy off stride. Friendly ships returning from a S or SE mission have to sit out the next game turn while they are refueled and rearmed. Ships on an SH mission can be quickly thrown into CSP or even S missions in response to enemy action, which makes the enemy think twice before starting anything.\n\nREAR AREA (RA) Ships on an RA mission are sent to safe remote bases to avoid combat. Sometimes used to avoid losses if a huge enemy strike is anticipated at an awkward time. After the enemy strike ships can return from RA to join surviving refueled friendly spacecraft.\n\nIn other words: each asteroid base is surrounded by mutually-friendly fighters on Combat Space Patrol, tasked with defending the base from incoming hostile strikes (missiles with nuclear warheads and bomber spacecraft loaded with nuclear bombs). The incoming strike is surrounded by mutually-friendly fighters on Strike Escort, tasked with defending the strike from hostile Combat Space Patrol. The escorts are trying to keep the enemy CSP off the back of the friendly bombers and IAMBs, poking a hole in the asteroid's defenses so that the bombers can bomb the crap out of the enemy asteroid's various installations. Meanwhile the asteroid's ack-ack laser batteries are doing their darnedest to shoot down all the bombers and IAMBs. The latter explode on target, surviving bombers return to base to be refueled and rearmed.\n\nIf there are more CSP fighters than SE fighters, the excess CSP can either double-up on SE fighters (two-on-one dogfight) or penetrate to shoot up the enemy Strike (which is the preferred option, it's the mission objective after all). Enemy fighters on SE can return fire on the CSP, poor enemy ships on Strike cannot. The strike ships are concentrating on laying their bombs, they cannot defend themselves.\n\nIf there are more SE fighters than CSP fighters, they can double-up on the CSP fighters. The Strike sails by unencumbered by the hostile CSP.\n\nIn either case, surviving SE fighters return to base to be refueled and rearmed.\n\nBraking Overshoot\n\nThis is a trick fighter maneuver. TV Tropes calls it Dodging by Braking.\n\nThe earliest instance I could find was the premier episode of classic Battlestar Galactica \"Saga of a Star World\" (1978). Apollo in his viper fighter has some Cylon raiders on his tail, barraging it with laser bolts. Apollo hits his breaking thrusters and abruptly slows down. The Cylons, still traveling rapidly, are caught flat footed. They overshoot Apollo and suddenly he is the one behind the enemy, firing laser bolts up the Cylon's buttocks. He quickly blows them both to Em-See-Squared.\n\nInstances of this maneuver I've manage to find include:\n\nBattlestar Galactica ep 1 (1978)Buck Rogers in the 25th Century episode 1b, where the tactic is called \"good old-fashioned red-dogging\" but I don't think that is the proper term. (1979)Top Gun, where it is called the Cobra Maneuver. (1986)Starcom: The U.S. Space Force, episode #1 \"Nantucket Sleighride\" (1987)The Mandalorian (2019)\n\nYou never see the Starfuries in Babylon 5 do this maneuver. That's because the writers know that rockets are not arrows. If an enemy fighter is on your tail, just spin in place and blow their face off. They also got it right in Space Above and Beyond and the Battlestar Galactica reboot.\n\nRealistic Designs\n\nMost of these are classic \"arrow\" or \"spear\" designs. That is, they look like a long rod with a sharp pointy thing at the top. The rod is the booster that lofts the fighter into orbit, while the pointy thing is the fighter proper. Some of the fighters actually have wings, which enhances the arrow motif. The technical term is \"spaceplane\".\n\nMonocle Fighter\n\nThe Monocle Fighter is a beam rider energized by a mothership, much like a Hegemony Interceptor. It is basically a mobile laser combat mirror.\n\nA scaled-up version can be used to boost cargo into orbit (or land them).\n\nThe name \"monocle\" is from the fact that the fighter looks like a round mirror, similar to the single eyeglass. In operation, the fighter does yaw-pitch-roll until the fighter is oriented such that the mothership can fire its laser in a bank shot off the fighter combat mirror and into the enemy ship. Since the fighter is closer to the enemy than the mother, it can aim more precisely. The mother can aim at the fighter with more accuracy because the fighter is constantly transmitting its location to the mother.\n\nThe monocle also allows the mothership to do a laser attack on an enemy that is not in the mothership's line-of-sight. Say, if the enemy was hiding behind the horizon of a planet. The monocle allows the mothership to shoot around the corner and nail the enemy anyway.\n\nLockheed proposed a \"binocle\" fighter which had two telescopes linked by an optical train of mirrors. The larger telescope is fed by the laser from the mothership, the smaller transmits the laser to fry the hapless target. It is basically two sets of beam expanders linked end-to-end (i.e., don't be fooled by the word \"binocle\": it is only one optical train, not two). Advantages: can isolate the laser train from fighter vibrations that spoil the aim, it is easier to aim the beam at the target since you don't have to rotate the entire fighter. Disadvantage: by focusing the beam small enough to fit into the optical train of mirrors, the increased intensity will increase the thermal load on the mirrors.\n\nThe BDM Corporation proposed a \"perinocle\" fighter. It only had two large mirrors with a rotary joint in the middle. Much like a periscope. Basically a binocle minus the optical train of mirrors. Advantages: makes it easier to aim beam at target, has no optical train of mirrors subject to thermal loads. Disadvantage: rotary joint and aiming mechanism adds more points of failure compared to the simple monocle design.\n\nSpace Cruiser/STAR\n\nSTAREARLIEST DESIGNMass ScheduleDry Mass989 kgFuel Mass1,941 kgWet Mass2,930 kgPerformanceEnginePlug NozzleIsp323 secExhaust\n\nVel3,169 m/sMass Ratio2.96ΔV3,443 m/s1984 STAR ReportMass ScheduleDry Mass\n\n(no payload)1,950 kgFuel Mass2,631 kgWet Mass\n\n(no payload)4,581 kgPerformanceEnginePlug NozzleIsp316.85 secExhaust\n\nVel3,108 m/sMass Ratio\n\n(no payload)2.35ΔV\n\n(no payload)2,655 m/sΔV\n\n(no payload\n\nCentaur 1st\n\nStage)8,908 m/sΔV\n\n(with payload)See TableLOWTHER\n\nRECONSTRUCTIONMass ScheduleThermal Tiles272 kgLifting Surfaces163 kgStructure249 kgBallast153 kgAPU98 kgLife Support176 kgAvionics/Comm124 kgElevons36 kgRecovery155 kgPropulsion38 kgACS20 kgFuel,\n\nTankage767 kgPilot218 kgPayload113 kgDRY MASS1622 kgWET MASS2,584 kgPerformanceMass Ratio1.59FuelHypergolic/Storable\n\nNitrogen tetroxide +\n\nPAAB-1Isp323 secExhaust\n\nVel3,170 m/sΔV1,476 m/sLength8 mMax width1.4 mLife span100 missionsThrust/engine836 NNum Enginex16x16 Thrust13,380 Nx16 Thrust\n\n(Plug Nozzle)13,600 N\n\nThis is a popular design since it is the closest thing to a space fighter in the real world. It periodically appears in breathless aerospace articles. However, it was more like a manned missile than it was a Viper from Battlestar Galactica.\n\nInformation is from Spaceplane Technology And Research (STAR), Aerospace Project Review Extras: Space Cruiser part 1, Aerospace Project Review US Spacecraft Projects #2: Spaceplanes, Astronautix Space Cruiser, and STAR: The USAF’s “Everything” Spacecraft.\n\nBack in the early 1970's the US Navy wanted a manned spacecraft to attack Soviet spy satellites if war broke out. The catch was they wanted the blasted thing carried and launched from a submarine. At the time submarines were the next best thing to having a cloaking device. The invisible sub could unexpectedly surface, launch the space cruiser into LEO, cruiser scrags the Soviet spy satellite in less than one whole orbit, and returns to Terra before being detected by Soviet radar.\n\nFred Redding Jr. was given the job of trying to design the space cruiser. Sadly no spacecraft small enough to fit in a submarine's Poseidon missile tube could make it even halfway to orbit. Not with 1970s technology at any rate. The US Navy lost interest.\n\nOne relic of this work was the space cruiser's pointy shape. It was based on the profile of hypersonic MIRV nuclear ICBMs, though scaled up a bit.\n\nAnyway Mr. Redding managed to pry his work out of the Navy's hands and got DARPA and the US Air Force interested. The name was changed from space cruiser to Spaceplane Technology and Research (STAR).\n\nThe STAR was redesigned to launch from a conventional booster, which was a heck of a lot easier than squeezing it into a sub missile launching tube. The cross-section was changed from circular to oval, converting it from a cone into a sort of lifting body. This also increased the size of the inadequate fuel tanks. Putting wings on a cone that wouldn't be instantly ripped off by hypersonic flight had been an unsolved problem, using a lifting body instead of wings neatly avoided the problem.\n\nReading between the lines it appears that Mr. Redding was quite upset at how the US Navy's desire for a one-trick pony made the project vulnerable to cancellation. To avoid a repeat, he tried to come up with as many different missions as possible for his baby. A thousand and one uses, indeed.\n\nThe STAR could get an astronaut into space, but with zero frills and luxuries. Strictly bare-bones. The crew compartment was barely large enough to sit in. It had no pressurization, the astronaut had to wear a space suit for the entire mission (24 hours of oxygen, wearing a diaper). No hydraulics, no ejection seat, not even landing gear. Blasted thing landed by a Rogallo wing like was proposed for the Gemini. One drogue chute located in the center of the engine plug cluster, one Rogallo at the fuel tanks, and one Rogallo directly forwards of the fuel tanks.\n\nIn space the pilot's hatch opens so they can straighten up and stick their head out of the hatch. Much like a World War 1 fighter plane, actually: \"open cockpit.\" Of course they will have to squeeze back in and close the hatch before reentry unless they want to barbecue their head.\n\nIn yet another desperate attempt to reduce the spacecraft mass the pilot had a heads-up display projected on the inside of their space helment. Much less mass than physical instruments. Some spacecraft functions can be voice controlled, which comes in handy when the astronaut is performing an EVA for satellite repair and is not physically at the controls.\n\nThe spacecraft can fold roughly in half to allow it to fit into cramped launch shrouds. This exposed the front arry of sensor system and forward attitude control thrusters. The front area can also carry a larger payload, or used as a tug to push satellites. Of course the front will have to unfold back into place before reentry.\n\nFor missions beyond the Van Allen belts the skin will have to be increased to 1.3 centimeters for more radiation shielding.\n\nTo increase endurance a sidecar habitat module can be added. This is an aluminum cylinder 1.2 meters in diameter, 3.7 meters long, 454 kgs. It is mounted over the pilot's hatch. It has to be jettisoned before reentry. Consumables for extended missions is 91 kg/day, where 41 kg is water for environmental cooling and 45 kg is APU fuel. A solar power array would eliminiate the need for the APU fuel.\n\nDrop tanks can add up to 953 extra kilograms of fuel and an additional 886 m/s of delta-V.\n\nTo be able to reach geosynchronous orbit, the STAR can be mounted on a Centaur-G. Performance as per the tables below. 4,267 m/s (14,000 fps) is needed to travel from a 100 nautical mile orbit inclinded at 28.5° (a bare bones launch from NASA's Kennedy Space Flight Center) to geosynchronous orbit.\n\nNotes on table:\n\nAPU: Auxiliary power unit including generator, batteries, and power conditioning. Runs on same rocket fuel\n\nLife Support: a space suit. 24 max endurance\n\nRecovery System: a Rogallo wing\n\nThermal Protection Tiles: the re-entry heat shield\n\nPilot: includes person, Extravehicular Mobility Unit (for satellite repair EVA), and acceleration couch\n\nFuel: PAAB-1 is Proprietary Aerojet Amine blend no. 1.\n\nACS: Attitude control system.

And a mercury trim adjuster is used to keep the center of gravity from drifting during re-entry, avoiding the whole tumbling and exploding into fiery debris problem.\n\nPayload: 113 kg is not much. Probably sensors or light weapons to kill unfriendly satellites.\n\nx16 Thrust (Plug Nozzle): Sixteen thrusters at 836 N each would ordinarily provide 13,380 N total thrust.

The article describes a mysterious 1961-1963 NASA-Ames wind tunnel report on an intriguing vehicle, but with zero info about who designed it, what project it was part of, and what was the subsequent history of the vehicle in question.\n\nAll that is known is it was some species of winged re-entry vehicle. Which doesn't help much because back in the 1960s pretty much every US aerospace company was frantically working on spaceplanes.\n\nThe interesting detail about this bird, though, is that it could be used as an orbital taxi…or as a fighter jet. With jet engines, weapons, and everything. Launch mass of both versions was 9,000 kilograms. Blueprints below contain mass schedules.\n\nThe vehicle launched into orbit, flew to a space station or something, and re-entered the atmosphere, all while folded up into a lifting body shape. That is, the opposite of a flying wing with all wing and no fuselage. Instead the lifting body was all fuselage and no wing, but with the fuselage cunningly shaped so it provided wing-like aerodynamic lift anyway. This is an advantage when you are aerobraking into atmospheric re-entry, since the atmospheric drag will be doing its darnedest to savagely rip right off any freaking wings. Lifting bodies stick their tongues out at atmospheric drag since they have no wings.\n\nOn the other hand, lifting bodies make lousy fighter planes because they maneuver with all the grace and elegance of a pregnant hippo. Just ask Steve Austin.\n\nTo deal with this, when it slows down from hypersonic re-entry speeds to mere low supersonic speeds, the Ames fighter unfolds so it has wings. The wings allow high speed jinking and dogfighting. Oh, and it also ejects a cover protecting the under-nose jet engine inlet. During re-entry an uncovered inlet will allow atmospheric drag to grab the poor aircraft by the nose and turn it inside out like a sock.\n\nThe orbital taxi version is a civilian thing with cargo capacity, room for three passengers, a tiny jet engine inlet and a single jet engine.\n\nThe military version is a lean, mean, fighting machine. No cargo, no passengers, added fuel capacity, a huge jet engine inlet, and four turbojet engines each larger than the civilian engine. Plus weapons and ammo. Weapons were not specified in the report, but were probably either a brace of machine guns or a rocket gun firing guided/unguided missiles.\n\nUpon re-entry the wings would start unfolding at an altitude of 37 kilometers and a speed of Mach 5. The turbojets would start at 18 km and between Mach 1 and 2. Cruising speed was Mach 2. The four jet engines produce 62,000 Newtons of thrust.\n\nSince the orbital taxi version was meant to be orbital, the military version would have a global range at the very least. Can probably reach any spot on Terra in 45 minutes flat. Sadly there ain't no more details.\n\nScott Lowther has a speculative idea, which makes sense to me. About the same time that the Ames fighter was being designed, Douglas Aircraft took their RHOMBUS plug nozzle heavy lift vehicle concept and made a it into a semi-single-stage-to-orbit intercontinental troop transport called Ithacus carrying 1,200 soldiers. It can reach any spot on Terra in 45 minutes flat. Gee, where have I heard that number before? Scott's idea is that a flight of Ames fighters can accompany an Ithacus on its suborbital hop and act as an escort. The fighters can neutralize any anti-Ithacus weapons, and provide air cover for the Ithacus during and after landing, until slower conventional fighters can arrive. Because frankly an Ithacus is an unmaneuverable fat hard-to-miss pig with a neon bulls-eye painted on the side, and conventional defensive fighters will take hours to show up.\n\nScott also says he'd be delighted if anybody has further information on this concept, and I'd like to see it as well.\n\nSatellite Interceptor\n\nHistorically this was a project created by the US military in 1957. Officially cancelled in 1962, it apparently is still undergoing some top-secret development as late as 2018. From a science fiction standpoint this would only make sense on a balkanized planet (i.e., more than one soveregn nation), not on a planet totally controlled by a single government. The project was called SAtellite INTerceptor or SAINT.\n\nThe idea seems to be to deal with the threat of Soviet satellites. On the one hand they might be orbital nuclear warheads. On the other hand if the US just preemptively destroyed out of hand any satellites the Soviets launched, the international political situation would deteriorate rapidly. So it would be well if the US could send up at an hours notice a crewed spacecraft to inspect the new Soviet satellite. If it turns out to be a nuke, then you can destroy it.\n\nOne of the proposed missions for the Boeing X-20 Dyna Soar was satellite inspector.\n\nPye Wacket was an apparent re-fit of a flying saucer shaped missile project that was in danger of being cancelled. They tried to apply it to the Blue SAINT program, making it a crewed satellite interceptor. Sadly it was in direct competition with the X-20 Dyna Soar project, so Py Wacket got axed by McNamara in 1962.\n\nThe Convair Space Shuttle was not an official part of SAINT. But it was intended to deliver repair crews to satellites for fixing malfunctions and maintenance. I'm sure it could be adapted to SAINT with little trouble.\n\nCode Name: Pye Wacket\n\nPye Wacket was a flying saucer shaped air-to-air missle the US Air Force developed from 1957 to 1961. At the end, it was studies as a possible design for a manned antisatellite spacecraft.\n\nIn 1957, the main part of the US nuclear deterrence strategy was nuclear armed B-52 bombers. Once they penetrated Soviet airspace, the Soviets would throw everything but the kitchen sink at them. The USAF figured the B-52 would need some kind of defense besides hiding and trying to look small. They started to look into some kind of defensive air-to-air missile the B-52 could carry, to deal with Soviet air-to-air missiles, surface-to-air mssiles, and manned interceptors. But the defense could not be allowed to interfere with the main goal of getting within bombing range of the target ASAP. Later the specification was changed from being launched from a B-52 to a B-70\n\nThe idea was to make an \"omnidirectional\" missile, that could fly in any direction upon release. The developers started looking into a lens-shaped design, much like the popular conception of a flying saucer. This was probably encouraged by the release of the USAF Project Blue Book study on UFOs, Paul Hill's attempts to explain UFO performance as seen in sightings using only conventional physics, and Alan Kehlet promoting his lenticular spacecraft.\n\nThey developed a shape that was sort of like a wedge that had been punched with a circular cookie cutter.\n\nBut then the project fell on hard times. The B-70 project was having difficulty getting the aircraft to travel fast enough even with no defensive missiles at all, it would be impossible if such missiles were carried. About this time a USAF U-2 spyplane got shot down in Soviet airspace at an altitude of 21 freaking kilometers. This lead to USAF's decision to turn to intercontinental ballistic missiles as the primary nuclear delivery force instead of bomber planes. The B-70 project got cancelled, and Pye Wacket along with it.\n\nOr did it?\n\nThe USAF had a project called Project SAINT (SAtellite INTerceptor) started in 1958. Top secret. This was a system to travel into orbit, inspect evil Soviet satellites, and destroy them if they posed threats to US national security. SAINT I used unmanned vehicles in the Green SAINT and White SAINT segments.\n\nThen there was Blue SAINT, using a manned vehicle.\n\nBlue SAINT was in direct competition with Boeing's X-20 Dynasoar program, so things quickly turned nasty. Blue SAINT was essentially cancelled in October 1962 by McNamara\n\nWhich may explain why Convair executive Earl Honeywell got away with his revelation at the Eighth Symposium on Ballistic Missile and Space Technology in San Diego on 17 October 1963.\n\nHoneywell went into considerable detail about Convair's Manned Anti-Satellite System. It looked suspiciously like a failed proposal for the ultra top clam Blue SAINT.\n\nBut what we are interested in is the fact it was based on Pye Wacket.\n\nThe spacecraft could intercept a Soviet satellite within 100 of the Soviet launch. It would stop at a safe distance, and send a remote controlled intercepter to the (possibly booby-trapped) Soviet satt. The interceptor would then scan the Soviet interloper with radar, infrared, and a TV camera. The manned crew would then decide whether or not to trigger the interceptor's warhead and vaporize the Soviet into a down payment on the Kessler Syndrome.\n\nHowever, you can see that the lenticular reentry vehicle is pure Pye Wacket.\n\nFor more details, refer to the Pye Wacket article\n\nThere are many theories about where the code name \"Pye Wacket\" came from. Strategic Air Command Colonel James \"Jimmy\" Stewart had appeared in a movie called Bell Book and Candle where the Greenwich Village Witch (played by Kim Novak) had a feline familiar named Pye Wacket. Some say that the name was suggested by a secretary in the project office who had seen the movie. Others say that Jimmy Stewart himself suggested it. But there is no definitive answer.\n\nBoeing DS-1\n\nThis is a spaceplane whose purpose is to investigate and/or nuke suspicious satellites placed by hostile governments. Note that concept-wise it is quite close to Stine's Space Scout.\n\nNorth American X-15A-3\n\nX-15A-3Enginex1 YLR-99FuelLOX/NH3Thrust 262,450 NWet Mass25,000 kgBurnout Mass8,557 kgDry Mass5,000 kgIsp276 secExhaust Velocity2,710 m/sMax SpeedMach 8ΔV2,400 m/sPeak Altitude30 kmAir-Launch vehicleXB-70Length19 mSpan6.8 m\n\nThe North American Aviation X-15 was an experimental hypersonic rocket-powered aircraft operated jointly by the U.S. Air Force and NASA (then NACA). The rocket plane was carried by a B-52 mothership to an altitude of about 14 kilometers and launch at subsonic speeds (my father was a radar/nav on a B-52). The very successful program had its first flight in 1959 and was winding down in 1968.\n\nIn 1956 the USAF was invested in the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar, because it was military. No space explorer this, it was a hypersonic bomber designed to drop nuclear bombs on targets in the Soviet Union. The annoying part was even though the X-20 project had already started, it was going to be years before it actually flew. The USAF figured a quick program could be inserted into the schedule until X-20 was ready. After the X-15 program started they tried the quick-and-dirty route with a modification called the X-15B. This was cancelled in 1958 when NACA became NASA, and replaced with Project Mercury.\n\nIn 1965 NASA tried to keep the X-15 program going by proposing a version with delta wings instead of those ridiculous little stubs sported by the stock X-15. The USAF was not interested in funding this, they saw their involvement with the X-15 was at a close. By 1967 the delta-wing X-15 program had advanced to a point where they could issue a formal Request For Proposals for formal conceptual design studies from interested corporations in the aerospace industry.\n\nThe only response was from North American Aviation, but it was a lulu! They submitted a two-volume, 500-page proposal containing detailed engineering concepts and cost data. And this was just the proposal to do the actual study. Most of the information in this section is from that study.\n\nThe X-15A-3 would have a much lower peak altitude than the X-15, but after all it was designed to study hypersonic flights at relatively low altitudes. Keep in mind that the program could easily be developed into a full blown spaceplane capable of reaching LEO.\n\nJust so you are not puzzled by the illustrations, there were two main variants about the wings.\n\nIn the \"wing forward\" position, the front-most apex of the wing is 1.981 meters behind the nose. In the \"wing midpostion\" position, the front-most apex of the wing is 2.616 meters behind the nose.\n\nThe difference is a whole 0.6 meters, which you probably cannot tell by looking at the pictures. However the wing-forward type has tip fins with four sides, while the wing-midposition type has tip fins with six sides. That you can easily see in the pictures.\n\nIt doesn't make much difference, but I didn't want you fretting about the different types of tip fins in the various pictures. And there were other variants.\n\nSomebody along the line figured that a X-15A-3 could fly higher and faster if it had a mothership more powerful than a pokey old B-52. Like say…a freaking XB-70 Valkyrie! Which also by some strange coincidence just happened to be developed by North American Aviation. This monster could fly at an altitude of 20 kilometers at about Mach 3.\n\nIt is hard to view this proposal as anything other than showmanship. In order to launch an X-15A-3, the Valkyrie would basically have to be re-designed from scratch. And the fatal M-12/D-21 launch disaster showed how dangerous Mach 3 launches are. For better or worse the actual studies looking into this are unavailable.\n\nBoeing X-20 Dyna-Soar\n\nX-20 Dyna-SoarPayload450 kgThrust71,190 NWet Mass10,125 kgDry Mass7,435 kgHeight14.5 mSpan6.34 m\n\nMost of this is from Aerospace Projects Review issue V3N4. If you have any interest in the Dyna Soar at all, you need to purchase this.\n\nThe X-20 had the confidential nickname 'Dyna-Soar' (for Dynamic Soarer) and the unclassified title 'Hypersonic Strategic Weapon System'.\n\nThe concept was born in those dire years of the 1950s, before the invention of ICBMs. The prevailing opinion was that ballistic missiles would never be accurate enough to entrust the responsibility for US nuclear deterrence. The then current system used bomber aircraft, which would have to somehow avoid every Soviet intercepter, fighter, and anti-aircraft weapon along the way. Surely there must be a better way.\n\nSo the Dyna Soar was sort of a hypersonic nuclear bomber. It could travel to the target in the fraction of the time a conventional bomber would take, be very difficult to intercept, and carrying a human pilot/bombardier to deliver the weapon much more accurately than any missile. It could evade intercepters by \"skip-gliding\", bouncing along the upper reaches of the atmosphere much like a flat stone skipping across the water. This idea dates back to the German Silbervogel concept.\n\nIt was actually more a hypersonic nuclear-bomb carrying glider, but you can't have everything.\n\nThe program was started in 1957. Sadly it was only a couple of years before the advent of ICBMs accurate enough to plant nuclear warheads right on the bulls-eye. Such missiles were even faster, carried no crew with all their limitations, and were much cheaper. The Dyna Soar program was in peril. The proponents quickly re-labeled it as an experimental reentry vehicle (the X-20). When that grew thin it was touted as a sort of an all-purpose space jeep.\n\nThe developers had quite a few missions that the Dyna-Soar was capable of fullfilling. Alas, in every single case there developed a smaller-lighter-cheaper solution that could use a smaller boost vehicle. The program was cancelled in 1963. Arguably it lives on in the top-secret X-37B, which can perform many of the same missions but is unmanned.\n\nThe final form was the Model 844.2050E. It was a delta-winged glider with no propulsion system except for its RCS. Actually it would perform most of its missions with the top stage of the rocket booster still attached to the rear (called the \"transtage\"). At the end of the mission it would jettison the transtage, use the one-shot engine in the transition section to deorbit, ditch the transition section, do a reentry aerobrake exactly like the Space Shuttle, and finish as a hypersonic glider doing a dead-stick landing on some salt flats (again just like the Space Shuttle).\n\nThe plan was to use a Titan IIIC as a booster.\n\nDoing an aerobraking reentry (aka almost but not quite burning to a cinder in the atmosphere) is guaranteed to make a hot spacecraft. They calculated that the belly would reach 1340°C. That's red-hot, a mere 35 degrees below the melting point of cast iron. It won't melt at that temperature, but it will turn into something about as strong as taffy on a hot summer day. So the designers decided to use René 41 super alloy.\n\nHowever the designers heat strategy was a little surprising: garden variety radiative cooling. In other words hope it can radiate away the heat before the wing melts. More modern heat shields use ablative cooling: the shield slowly chars and flakes away. Which means they have to be replaced after each use. Using radiative cooling is an attempt to avoid that.\n\nThe designers went with a layer of D-36 columbium alloy, insulated from the René 41 by a layer of Q-felt silica fiber. The leading edges got even hotter, 1550°C. So the wing and fin leading edges, the outboard rudder surfaces, and lower surface of elevons used panels of TZM molybdenum instead of columbium alloy. These got a double layer of TZM separated by an air gap, just in case of a burn-through. The black color is from a coating of disilicide for oxidation protection, otherwise the the columbium and molybdenum would \"burn\" away. The coating would have to be replaced after each reentry, but it can be easily sprayed on like paint. Nothing like the nightmare of replacing Space Shuttle tiles.\n\nBut the nose of the Dyna Soar got hottest of all: a blazing 2010°C! These had to be made out of ceramics.\n\nA small triangular columbium heat shield covers the forward pilot windows, otherwise reentry would melt the windows and the blowtorch of hot air would incinerate the crew. The side windows are not covered since they can survive the lower heat there. Once reentry is over the window heat shield is jettisoned so the pilot can see to land.\n\nCONTROLS\n\nSince the Dyna Soar's major movement was by skip-gliding, the most important instrument in the pilot cockpit was the Energy Management Display Indicator (EMDI). What it boils down to is the instrument shows the pilot where the Dyna Soar can go. Possible landing areas given the Dyna Soar's current position, velocity, and maneuver capability (keeping within the allowable heating rate of the structure). The instrument is especially important since the Dyna Soar is a blasted glider, it has no engines. If you miss a landing you cannot do a go-around, instead you crash.\n\nThe EMDI was a cathode ray tube with a 10 centimeter diameter display. It could show up to ten dots, each a possible landing site. Overlaying was a long strip of film that could be advanced one frame at a time, each with a different graphic overlay. This was ultra-high tech back in 1962, it looks like stone knives and slide rules to us nowadays.\n\nThe pilot used typical rudder foot pedals for rudder control. The joystick was a pain in the posterior though. Instead of the then-standard central control stick, there were two side stick controls. Common nowadays but high tech back then. The right-hand stick controlled the wing flaps by a—gasp!—fly-by-wire system (ditto). The left-hand stick controlled the RCS jets.\n\nIn vacuum the pilot used the left stick, in atmo the right stick. But during reentry the poor pilot had to use both sticks since neither system was at its best during the transition.\n\nLANDING\n\nUnlike the later Space Shuttle, Dyna-Soar did not have wheels on its tricycle undercarriage as the rubber tires required cooled compartments or they would burn like a tire fire covered in thermite during re-entry. Instead Goodyear developed retractable wire-brush skids made of the same René 41 super alloy as the airframe. Sure it will be a bumpy ride, but René 41 is fireproof.\n\nGLIDER\n\nThe interior compartments were not built into the skin of the Dyna Soar, because that skin got red hot. Instead they were suspended within the structural trusswork, and had active cooling. The entire outer surface was covered with water filled panels surrounded by Q-felt silica fiber insulation. The water walls dropped the 980°C trusswork down to 93°C which the cockpit air conditioning and pilot's space suit could handle. The water walls were about 0.84 cm thick and had about 5 kilograms of water per square meter. The water was solidified with cyanogum 41 jelling agent and contained in wicks. The water would eventually boil and the steam would be dumped overboard. Hopefully the reentry would run out of heat before the walls ran out of water.\n\nTRANSITION SECTION\n\nTRANSTAGE\n\nIn orbit the glider remained attached to the third stage of the Titan. This transtage was a restartable rocket capable of enormous maneuvers. Before ignition it had a gross mass of 12,250 kg, of which 10,300 kg was storable nitrogen tetroxide/Aerozine-50 propellants. The transtage would fire initially to place the Dyna-Soar in orbit. Available remaining propulsion would depend on the mission initial orbit and glider mass. On a typical mission it was expected the total mass (glider+transtage) orbited would be 12,700 kg, leaving the transtage with 5700 kg of propellants, enough for a single maneuver of over 2 km/sec. Such huge maneuvers would greatly complicate the enemy's ability to predict the overflight path and time of the Dyna-Soar on a reconnaissance, bombing, or satellite interception mission.\n\nHydrazine + Nitrogen Tetroxide is storable, and hypergolic (you don't need an igniter). Drawback is the low specific impulse.\n\nLiquid Fluorine + Liquid Hydrogen has fantastic specific impulse. Fluorine is also denser than oxygen, so the tank is smaller. Drawback is LH2 is cryogenic so it is a royal pain to store. And fluorine is insanely dangerous to work with. Both toxic and it dissolves pretty much every single material a spacecraft is built out of.\n\nLiquid Oxygen + Liquid Hydrogen has pretty good specific impulse. Drawback is LH2 is cryogenic so it is a royal pain to store.\n\nMission Configurations\n\nMike Billard is an engineer who is learning the art of 3D CGI graphics. The YF-19A Saber is a TOTALLY FICTITIOUS SCIENCE-FICTIONAL hypothetical outgrowth of the 1960's Dyna Soar project. Of course, the engineering detail are meticulous. He can be found on the SciFi Meshes forum under the handle Mikey-B.\n\nIn the last four images below, the black X-20 mesh was created by an artist named Burncycle for the space simulation Orbiter.\n\nSpace Scout\n\nThis is from a book entitled The Answer to the Space Flight Challenge by Frank Tinsley (1958).\n\nNoted rocket engineer G. Harry Stine designed this vehicle in the early 1950's. He figured that manned space stations would be controlled by the nation that built them. Therefore a scientific station could be instantly transformed into a martial moon at the sound of a trumpet! Horrors! Armed with atomic missiles, they could strike any spot on Earth. What a hideous threat to freedom and democracy the world over.\n\nThe space scout is designed to deal with this menace, blowing up hostile stations with atomic missiles before they can strike. Without it, the world stands unarmed and helpless before the threats of a technologically advanced dictator.\n\nAt least according to Mr. Stine. In reality it would probably be far more cost effective to just launch flight after flight of surface-to-orbit missiles until the evil space station was vaporized.\n\nIt is boosted into orbit atop a three-stage rocket. The spacecraft flies nose first in space, driven by the liquid fuel rocket engine. It flies tail first in the air, driven by the three jet engines. This means that the jet engine exhaust goes \"upward\", that is, in the opposite direction of the rocket exhaust.\n\nThe jet engines are mounted on \"M\" shaped supersonic wings fitted with conventional airplane control surfaces. Note that the control surfaces are on the upper edge of the wing, not the lower. The elongated nose cone of each jet engine doubles as a landing leg. Velbor points out that this is a poor design decision. A hard landing will transmit shock directly to the delicate mechanism of the jet engine turbines. They may explosively delaminate, shooting turbine blades at everything in line with the turbine plane. Which you may have noticed includes the fuel tanks.\n\nThe tail of the spacecraft is bulbous to increase the heat radiating surface area, and corrugated with liquid oxygen cooling pipes. In other words it is trying to do the same job as the heat shield on the base of the Apollo command module.\n\nThe three transparent blisters on the flight deck help the pilot to land by providing full ground visibility via a system of reflecting mirrors.\n\nWith the three man crew, two are always on duty while the third sleeps. In combat conditions all three are on duty. The craft is designed for a three-day mission, with a maximum life-support endurance of a week. It is armed with three missiles packing nuclear warheads.\n\nNote that concept-wise, this is very similar to Boeing's DS-1 Satellite Inspector. Including the nuclear missiles.\n\nConvair Space Shuttle\n\nThe Convair Shuttle was designed by Dr. Krafft Ehricke. From the vague hints I've found it was apparently intended to deliver repair crews to expensive satellites for fixing malfunctions and maintenance.

However in 1969 it was repackaged as the \"Space Police\" ship in the Space Pursuit combination plastic model kit.\n\nActually it isn't a bad fit. Like all the other space fighters in this section it is a fighter ship boosted into orbit with a multistage chemical rocket. It certainly has enough delta V to be a fighter, given the nuclear engine and all. All it needs are weapons.\n\nThe booster was a two-stage rocket whose sole purpose was just to get the Moon Ship (stage three) from the ground into low Terra Orbit. \"Halfway to Anywhere\" strikes again. The original design had stage I and II chemical rockets using liquid oxygen and and alcohol.\n\nFor the plastic model kit, the designer had to shorten the stage I and II tanks to keep the kit within Revell's planned price range. The booklet says the overall length is 34 meters, I'm not sure if that with the shortened stages or not.\n\nWith the truncated tanks the designer was forced to use the more powerful (but insanely dangerous) oxidizer Liquid Fluorine, which has probably killed more rocket researchers than any other chemical. Or any chemist for that matter. It is sometimes used with liquid methane when you need the specific impulse of liquid-oxygen/liquid-hydrogen but cannot afford the voluminous fuel tanks required. Angle then doubled-down on danger by using hydrazine instead of methane. Hydrazine is not quite as deadly as its close cousin Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (which Troy Campbell calls \"explosive cancer\") but it is certainly bad enough.\n\nThe MoonShip/SpaceFighter (stage III) does not play around with feeble chemical engines, it has a full blown nuclear thermal rocket. When I look at the mass budget, I find it difficult to believe it also has a full blown radiation shadow shield thick enough to protect the crew from a lethal dose. Even if it did, the Moon Ship's wings and propellant tanks stick outside the shadow, so they will backscatter harmful radiation all over the place.\n\nAttitude control is by two monopropellant RCS engines that flank the nuclear engine, and by an internal flywheel.\n\nUpon return to Terra, spacecraft uses aerobraking by a series of braking ellipses over a period of two days. The drags covering the hydrogen propellant tanks do most of the work. When the velocity slows enough, the drags and the propellant tanks are jettisoned. It then does a dead-stick landing using the wings and aerodynamic control surfaces exactly like the old NASA Space Shuttle.\n\nYou can find one or two more details at the main article.\n\nStageWet Mass\n\n(kg)Propellant\n\nBurnt\n\n(kg)ΔV Totals\n\n(m/s)Thrust\n\n(N)I616,698332,0302,2228,006,796II215,456122,0165,4902,224,110III10,2515,5849,65688,964\n\nRocketpunk Orbital Patrol Ship\n\nOrbital Patrol ShipStatsPropulsionChemical\n\nH2-O2Exhaust Velocity4,400 m/sSpecific Impulse449 sThrust3.5×106 NThrust Power7.7 gigawattsTotal ΔV6,100 m/sMass BudgetEngine Mass7 mtonHeat Shield Mass15 mton\n\n(15% re-entry mass)Terra Recovery\n\nparachute, retro,\n\nlanding gear5 mton\n\n(5% landing mass)NonTerra Recov\n\nlanding legs\n\nLuna, Mars5 mton\n\n(5% landing mass)Misc\n\nattitude jets,\n\nelectrical, etc.20 mton\n\n(20% dry mass)Aerodynamics\n\ncontrols,\n\nfarings, etc.5 mton\n\n(5% dry m)Tankage body18 mton\n\n(6% of\n\n300 mton\n\nH2-O2)INERT MASS75 mtonPayload,\n\nhab module\n\ncargo bays25 mtonDRY MASS100 mtonPropellant\n\nH2-O2300 mtonWET MASS400 mtonMass Ratio4.0Plus\n\nbooster rocket? mton\n\nThis is a splendid spacecraft designed by Rick Robinson, appearing on his must-read blog Rocketpunk Manifesto. This was designed for his Orbital Patrol service, which he covered in three previous posts.\n\nThe important insight he noted was that if you can somehow get your spacecraft into orbit with a full load of fuel/propellant, it turns out that most cis-Lunar and Mars missions have delta V requirements well within the ability of weak chemical rockets. So you make a small chemical rocket and lob it into orbit with a huge booster rocket (heavy lift launch stack). This will be the standard Orbit Patrol ship.\n\nIt can also be boosted into orbit by a smaller booster rocket, then using the patrol ship's engines for the second stage. So as not to cut into the ship's mission delta V, it will need access to an orbital propellant depot to refuel. At a rough guess, you'll need 9,700 m/s delta V to boost the patrol ship into orbit (7,900 m/s orbital velocity plus gravity and aerodynamic drag losses). So the booster will need 9,700 m/s with a payload of 400 metric tons. Bonus points if the booster is reusable.\n\nActually, it reminds me a bit of the old Three Man Space Scout.\n\nAt a rough guess, Rick figures that if the ship is capsule shaped it will be about 12 meters high by 14 meters in diameter. If it is wedge shaped, it will be about 40 meters high by 25 meters wide by 8 meters deep.\n\nIn both cases, total interior volume of 1,200 m3 (of which 900 m3 is propellant), and a surface area of 800 m2\n\nPresent day expandable propellant tanks have a mass of about 6% of the mass of the liquid propellant. Rick is assuming that in the future the 6% figure will apply to reusable tanks as well.\n\nIf my slide rule is not lying to me, the 300 metric tons of H2-O2 fuel/propellant represents 33.3 metric tons of liquid hydrogen and 266.7 metric tons of liquid oxygen. About 470 m3 of liquid hydrogen volume (sphere with radius of 4.8 m) and 234 m3 of liquid oxygen volume (sphere with radius of 3.8 m). This is a total volume of 704 m3 which falls short of Rick's estimate of 900 m3 so I probably made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLanding on Terra will use retro-rockets, the heat shield for aerocapture, maybe a parachute, and aircraft style landing gear for belly landing. Landing on Luna or Mars will be by tail-landing on rear mounted landing legs. That will also mean reserving some of the propellant for landing purposes.\n\nNote that the heat shield is rated for the ship's unfueled mass (heat shield mass = 15% of ship's re-entry mass), there is not enough to brake the ship if it has propellant left. This assumes a \"low-high'low\" mission profile: start at LEO, go outward to perform mission while burning most of the propellant, then return to LEO or even land on Terra. So 15 metric tons for heat shield is for a ship with a mass of 100 metric tons at re-entry (ship's total dry mass).\n\nIf the ship is going to aerobrake then return to higher orbit, it will need more heat shield mass to handle the extra mass of get-home propellant. This will savagely cut into the payload mass, which is only 25 metric tons at best. For example, if the mission had the ship heading for translunar space from LEO after aerobraking, the extra propellant mass at aerobrake time will increase the heat shield mass from 15 metric tons to 31. This will reduce the payload from 25 metric tons to 8. But by the same token a ship that will not perform any aerobraking can omit the heat shield entirely, using the extra 15 metric tons for more propellant or payload.\n\nPayload includes habitat module (if any) as well as cargo, since hab modules are optional for short missions. The gross payload is 25 metric tons, of which 20 is cargo and the other 5 mtons are payload bay structure and fittings. If you assume two tons of life support consumables per crew per two week mission; then the ship could carry a crew of five plus 12 mtons of removable payload, or a crew of 10 and 4 mtons of payload (the more that payload is consumables, the less mass needed for payload bay structure).\n\nPatrol MissionsMissionDelta VLow earth orbit (LEO) to geosynch and return5700 m/s powered\n\n(plus 2500 m/s aerobraking)LEO to lunar surface (one way)5500 m/s\n\n(all powered)LEO to lunar L4/L5 and return\n\n(estimated)4800 m/s powered\n\n(plus 3200 m/s aerobraking)LEO to low lunar orbit and return4600 m/s powered\n\n(plus 3200 m/s aerobraking)Geosynch to low lunar orbit and return\n\n(estimated)4200 m/s\n\n(all powered)Lunar orbit to lunar surface and return3200 m/s\n\n(all powered)LEO inclination change by 40 deg\n\n(estimated)5400 m/s\n\n(all powered)LEO to circle the Moon and return retrograde\n\n(estimated)3200 m/s powered\n\n(plus 3200 m/s aerobraking)Mars surface to Deimos (one way)6000 m/s\n\n(all powered)LEO to low Mars orbit (LMO) and return6100 m/s powered\n\n(plus 5500 m/s aerobraking)\n\nAircraft Carrier Micro Fighter\n\nThis is from Investigations of a Micro-Fighter / Airborne Aircraft Carrier Concept. The study was performed under a contract from the US Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory. The idea was to make a flying aircraft carrier. Shades of Captain Scarlet's Cloudbase or S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Helicarrier.\n\nThis is for an aircraft, not a spacecraft, but it does have interesting features. I'm sure it will be fascinating to fans of Super Dimension Fortress Macross / Robotech. But if you write a novel using this as is, RocketCat will give you an Atomic Wedgie while screaming ROCKET ARE NOT BOATS!\n\nFighter Traffic Control\n\nSince any mothership carrying large numbers of fighters often acts like a crowded airport, it will need the equivalent of air-traffic controllers. Or fighters will start colliding.\n\nSpace Fighters In Fiction\n\nGallery\n\nDrones\n\nA one man fighter spacecraft would be a more effective weapon if you removed the fighter pilot, their life support, and their acceleration limits, and then replaced them with a computer. You would basically be converting the fighter spacecraft into a roving missile bus, and removing the logical justification for the existence of fighter spacecraft altogether. But it would be overwhelmingly more effective. Even over and above the fact you can send them on the equivalent of a suicide mission, since nobody living is onboard.\n\nIn other words, hard-science stories are far more likely to have drones in lieu of manned fighters.\n\nIf you are an author, try not to think about Burnside's Zeroth Law.\n\n3D artist Scott Halls has made an amazing website illustrating technical information about Peter F. Hamilton's Night's Dawn trilogy. Above are the \"Combat Wasps\", which are a sort of armed drone. Left to right are the Kinetic Harpoon, Electronic Warfare, Fusion Torpedo, and Particle Beam Cannon Wasps.
