Failed Atlas-Agena rocket launch attempt, 1960s. Footage of the attempted launch of an Atlas-Agena rocket, with the engine cutting out a few seconds after launch resulting in the rocket falling back onto the launch pad and exploding. An example of such a launch pad failure was the Atlas-Agena B LV-3 launch of 9 September 1961, resulting in the destruction of the Samos 3 satellite payload. This launch took place at Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 3, California, USA. The launch pad used was the SLC-3W (Space Launch Complex 3 West), also called the Point Arguello Launch Complex (PALC-1-1).
