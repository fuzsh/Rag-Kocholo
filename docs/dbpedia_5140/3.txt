This week the New York Yankees will honor their 1998 World Series team with a 20th anniversary celebration. That team was led by five homegrown players, all of whom have had their number retired. Bernie Williams and the "Core Four" are each deservedly remembered with a plaque in Monument Park, but do they all merit a retired number?

To answer that question, let's review the Yankee Hall of Famers whose numbers are retired. And while we're at it, let's look at all the Yankee Hall of Famers who don't have their number retired.

Hall of Fame

There are 11 Yankees who are in the Hall of Fame and also have their numbers retired. In addition Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera are guaranteed first ballot inductees, which will bring the total to 13. Here they are in the order that their numbers were taken out of circulation.

Babe Ruth

#3 retired: June 13, 1948

Joe DiMaggio

#5 retired: April 18, 1952

HoF induction: 1955

DiMaggio had his number retired before the first home-opener following his final game.

Mickey Mantle

#7 retired: June 8, 1969

HoF induction: 1974

Mantle’s number was retired less than a year after the end of his career.

Casey Stengel

#37 retired: August 8, 1970

HoF induction: 1966

Stengel, pictured above with pitchers Eddie Lopat, Vic Raschi and Allie Reynolds, was the first of three managers to have his number retired. However, in 1932 Miller Huggins, who didn’t wear a number as the manager of the 1920s teams, was honored with the first monument in what later became known as Monument Park

Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey

#8 retired: July 22, 1972

These two great Yankee catchers both wore the number eight and shared the retirement ceremony in 1972. Berra was inducted into the Hall of Fame that same summer while Dickey had been inducted in 1954.

Whitey Ford

#16 retired: August 3, 1974

HoF induction: 1974

Like Berra, Ford’s number was retired upon his enshrinement in Cooperstown.

Phil Rizzuto

#10 retired: August 4, 1985

HoF induction: 1994

Rizzuto was not yet in the Hall of Fame when the Yankees retired his number. At that point he was known as much for his broadcasting as his shortstop play.

Reggie Jackson

#44 retired: August 14, 1993

HoF induction: 1993

Owner George Steinbrenner and Jackson had their feuds, but Steinbrenner was frequently quoted as saying that letting Jackson leave for free agency in 1982 was his "greatest mistake." In 1993 Jackson joined the Hall in a Yankee cap and Steinbrenner retired his 44 that same year despite only having played five years in the Bronx.

Jackie Robinson

#42 retired: April 15, 1997

HoF induction: 1962

Robinson's number was retired by all of baseball on the 50th anniversary of his Major League debut. Mariano Rivera continued to wear 42 until his retirement in 2013.

John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Mariano Rivera

#42 retired: September 22, 2013

HoF induction: 2019 (projected)

Rivera will be a first-ballot Hall of Famer, and is clearly deserving of having his number retired. On that day in 2013 he was joined in Monument Park by Robinson's widow Rachel Robinson, above.

John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Joe Torre

#6 retired: August 23, 2014

HoF induction: 2014

Like so many Yankees, Torre left on bad terms. But by the time of his Hall induction in 2014, Torre was back in the Bronx, wearing a Yankee hat and getting his number retired.

John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Derek Jeter

#2 retired: May 14, 2017

HoF induction: 2020 (projected)

When Jeter makes the Hall of Fame there will still be 11 Yankees in Cooperstown with him who don't have their number retired.

Not in Hall of Fame

William Perlman | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Nine Yankees with retired numbers are not in the Hall of Fame including Bernie Williams, Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte, above. Do these nine diminish the honor of having a retired number? Would it be enough to have a plaque in Monument Park and keep the numbers in circulation?

Thurman Munson

#15 retired: August 2, 1979

Deserving? Yes

Although his number was officially retired the following year, Munson's tragic death on August 2, 1979, meant no Yankee would ever wear 15 again. He was the team's first captain since Lou Gehrig and was the spirit of the 1970s teams that won three pennants and two World Series.

Elston Howard

#32 retired: July 21, 1984

Deserving? Yes

Howard joined the Yankees in 1955, becoming the first African-American in pinstripes. He was a very good catcher with an MVP in 1963 and played 13 years in the Bronx followed by a season-and-a-half in Boston. He should be honored as a pioneer.

Roger Maris

#9 retired: July 21, 1984

Deserving? No

Now we are getting into the area of players that deserve a plaque in Monument Park, but don't merit a retired number. Maris had three amazing seasons with the Yankees, followed by four so-so seasons. Of course he hit 61 home runs in 1961 and won back-to-back MVP awards in '60-'61. But for a non-Hall-of-Famer to have his number retired, he should be a life-long Yankee great, or at least close to it.

Billy Martin

#1 retired: August 10, 1986

Deserving? No

Martin was an infamous Yankee player and manager. But retiring his number in the middle of an on-again-off-again feud with owner George Steinbrenner was clearly a publicity stunt.

Don Mattingly

#23 retired: August 31, 1997

Deserving? No

This one is painful. Mattingly was a special Yankee during a dry spell when they went 14 years without a World Series appearance. Isn't a plaque in Monument Park enough on a team with so many all-time greats? There are nine players in Cooperstown wearing Yankee hats that haven't had their numbers retired (see below) and six of the nine aren't even honored in Monument Park. It feels like more of a popularity contest out there than a place to honor the players that have been a part of 27 World Championships since 1923.

Ron Guidry

#49 retired: August 23, 2003

Deserving? No

Just like Mattingly, it's hard to say "no" to a career Yankee, a great player and a fan-favorite. But given the talent on the Yankees throughout history, Guidry belongs with those honored with a plaque but not a number.

John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Bernie Williams

#51 retired: May 24, 2015

Deserving? No

Williams was a career Yankee and the first of the 1996-2000 World Series teams to have his number retired. A section honoring those teams would be great. But numbers should be reserved for the special Yankees, Jeter and Rivera, who will soon be in Cooperstown.

John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Jorge Posada

#20 retired: August 22, 2015

Deserving? No

If there was any question whether the Yankees were trying to create as many special days as possible in the summer of 2015, the evidence is here. Williams, Posada and Pettitte each had a separate day and a separate sellout crowd.

John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Andy Pettitte

#49 retired: August 23, 2015

Deserving? No

Pettitte is the only member of the "Core Four" who didn't spend his whole career in pinstripes when he and Roger Clemens left together for Houston in 2004. A big-game pitcher who should be remembered with the special Yankees, but let someone else wear 46.

Hall of Famers who are not properly honored

The Yankees have been sending players to Cooperstown since its inception, but six of those players don't even get a plaque in Monument Park and three more have plaques but their numbers are still in circulation. All are more deserving of a remembrance than Williams, Posada and Pettitte.

Jack Chesbro

No retired number, no plaque

HoF 1946

Yes, Chesbro didn't wear a number, he played for the Highlanders and his career began in 1903. But he does wear an NY cap in Cooperstown. Isn't that deserving of a plaque?

Waite Hoyt

No number, no plaque

HoF 1969

Hoyt didn't wear a number in his ten seasons with the Yankees from 1921 through 1930. But he did pitch in six World Series, going 6-3 with a 1.62 ERA. The Yankees won three championships in those years. That sounds like a big-game pitcher. A plaque in Monument Park would be nice.

Herb Pennock

No number, no plaque

HoF 1948

Pennock went 5-0 with a 1.95 ERA in four World Series for the Yankees from 1923 through 1933. How about a plaque next to his teammate Hoyt?

Earle Combs

#1 not retired, no plaque

HoF 1970

Combs spent his entire 12-year career with the Yankees from 1924 through 1935, finishing with a .325 batting average. He batted .350 in four World Series, winning three. No plaque, really?

Tony Lazzeri

#6 not retired, no plaque

HoF 1991

Lazzeri wore number six for most of his 12 years playing second base for the Yankees. An average season during that span was 14 home runs, 96 RBI, while batting .293. He played in six World Series from 1926 through 1937, winning five rings.

Red Ruffing

#15 not retired, plaque July 10, 2004

HoF 1967

Ruffing basically took over the World Series from Hoyt and Pennock, going 7-2 in seven October Classics from 1932 through 1942. Yay, a plaque!

Lefty Gomez

#11 not retired, plaque August 1, 1987

HoF 1972

Want to talk post-season dominance? Gomez was 6-0 with a 2.86 ERA in seven World Series starts. He didn't have extra rounds of playoffs to pad his post-season stats, but he was unbeaten while winning five rings. He pitched 13 years with the Yankees from 1930 through 1942, going 189-102 for a .649 winning percentage.

Joe Gordon

#6 not retired, no plaque

HoF 2009

From 1938 through 1943 Gordon averaged 24 home runs, 95 RBI and batted .278, while playing second base for teams that won four World Series titles in five appearances. His career was interrupted by two years of military service during World War II.

Goose Gossage

#54 not retired, plaque June 22, 2014

HoF 2008

Being honored with a plaque seems perfect for Gossage. He played for nine different teams in his 22-year hall-of-fame career, but he entered the Hall wearing a Yankee cap.

A category of his own

John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com

Alex Rodriguez

A-Rod is a unique case among the Yankee greats. His statistics are among the best in MLB history, but his PED use may keep him out of the Hall. Do PEDs keep him out of Monument Park, too?

There are no definitive answers, but the overall feeling here is that given the number of players wearing NY caps in Cooperstown, shouldn't that be a requirement for a number being retired, with the exception of Munson and Howard? There are other ways to honor those that were important Yankees but not all-time greats.
