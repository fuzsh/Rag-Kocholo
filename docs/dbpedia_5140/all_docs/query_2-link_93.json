Outside the daily operations within a franchise, the number on a player's jersey carries little value unless that player earns it.\n\nThroughout the history of the NFL, NHL, MLB and NBA, the greatest players transformed a simple number into something more symbolic, something almost magical. No. 23 isn't just any number—it's the number that belongs to the greatest basketball player in NBA history, Michael Jordan.\n\nHere are the greatest players ever to wear each number, from 00 to 99, in any sport.\n\nNo. 00: Robert Parish, NBA\n\n1 of 100\n\nHall of Fame center Robert Parish spent most of his 21-year career in the NBA with the Boston Celtics.

Whether or not he ever wins another championship, Brady's legacy is already set in stone.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 12: John Stockton, NBA\n\nNo. 12: Terry Bradshaw, NFL\n\nNo. 12: Joe Namath, NFL\n\nNo. 13: Wilt Chamberlain\n\n14 of 100\n\nAfter a stint with the famed Harlem Globetrotters, Hall of Fame center Wilt Chamberlain played the most productive seasons of his 13-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe 13-time All-Star won two NBA Championships with the Lakers and was named the league's MVP four times.\n\nChamberlain is the only player in NBA history to score 100 points in a single game, and he is the league's fourth leading scorer of all-time.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 13: Dan Marino, NFL\n\nNo. 13: Alex Rodriguez, MLB\n\nNo. 13: Pavel Datsyuk, NHL\n\nNo. 14: Pete Rose, MLB\n\n15 of 100\n\nDue to accusations that he gambled on baseball while playing for and managing the Cincinnati Reds, Pete Rose will probably never be inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame—but had circumstances been different, there's no denying his career achievements would have qualified him.\n\nOver a career spanning most of three decades, Rose won three World Series Championships, three NL batting titles, two Gold Glove Awards and was selected as an All-Star 17 times—to name just a few of his countless accomplishments.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 14: Brendan Shanahan, NHL\n\nNo. 14: Bob Cousy, NBA\n\nNo. 15: Bart Starr, NFL\n\n16 of 100\n\nPackers legendary quarterback Bart Starr played his entire career in Green Bay—where he won five championships (two Super Bowls, three NFL Championships).\n\nStarr was selected to the Pro Bowl four times over his career and was named the MVP of Super Bowl's I and II.\n\nThe Packers retired Starr's number, and he was inducted to the Hall of Fame in 1977.\n\nNo. 16: Joe Montana, NFL\n\n17 of 100\n\nHall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana is (arguably) the best quarterback of all-time—it's tough to argue against him, considering his four Super Bowl Championships with the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMontana was named the Super Bowl MVP in three of the 49ers four victories, was selected to the Pro Bowl eight times and was twice named the AP Press Male Athlete of the Year.\n\nMontana may have finished his career with the Kansas City Chiefs, but it's his legendary career with the 49ers that will be remembered—his number has been retired by the franchise.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 16: Brett Hull, NHL\n\nNo. 16: Pat LaFontaine, NHL\n\nNo. 17: Dizzy Dean, MLB\n\n18 of 100\n\nHall of Fame pitcher Dizzy Dean won the World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1934—the same year he was selected as the NL MVP.\n\nA four-time All-Star, Dean's number has been retired by the Cardinals.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 17: John Havlicek, NBA\n\nNo. 18: Peyton Manning, NFL\n\n19 of 100\n\nIndianapolis Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is often referred to as the greatest regular season quarterback in NFL history—and the 11-time Pro Bowler has the stats to back up that assertion.\n\nManning has been named the AFC Player of the Year six times, the AP NFL MVP four times and is the fastest player ever to reach 50,000 yards passing.\n\nManning hasn't just delivered in the regular season—he has led the Colts to two Super Bowl appearances, winning and being named the MVP of Super Bowl XLI.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 18: Dave Cowens, NBA\n\nNo. 19: Steve Yzerman, NHL\n\n20 of 100\n\nHall of Fame center Steve Yzerman played every season of his illustrious 22-year NHL career for the Detroit Red Wings.\n\nBetween 1997 and 2002, Yzerman led the wings to three Stanley Cup Championships and the 10-time All Star is the sixth leading scorer in NHL history.\n\nYzerman's is just one of six numbers to be retired by the Red Wings.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 19: Johnny Unitas, NFL\n\nNo. 19: Willis Reed, NBA\n\nNo. 20: Barry Sanders, NFL\n\n21 of 100\n\nDetroit Lions legendary running back Barry Sanders may have never won a Super Bowl in his 10-year career in the NFL, but the 10-time Pro Bowler was rated the most elusive running back of all time by NFL.com.\n\nOver his career, Sanders led the NFL in rushing four times, was twice named the AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year and was named the 1997 NFL MVP.\n\nSanders is the third leading rusher in NFL history, and his number has been retired by the Lions—the only team he ever played for.\n\nOthers of Note:\n\nNo. 20: Ed Reed, NFL\n\nNo. 20: Luc Robitaille, NHL\n\nNo. 21: Roberto Clemente, MLB\n\n22 of 100\n\nRoberto Clemente played all 18 seasons of his career with the Pittsburgh Pirates before a 1972 plane crash tragically ended the career, claiming the life of one of baseball's greatest legends.\n\nClemente was a 15-time All-Star selection, 12-time Gold Glove Award winner, four-time winner of the NL batting title and won two World Series Championships with the Pirates—being named the World Series MVP in 1971.
