        "text": "The last holdouts were the Philadelphia Athletics. In 1937, Connie Mack’s A’s succumbed to the modern trend by putting uniform numbers on their home and road jerseys. Since then, all but three double-digit numerals have been worn in big-league games. As you await the return of baseball, take a stroll through its history, as The Athletic rates the best players to don each one.\n\n0: Al Oliver\n\nUT. Texas Rangers, 1979-1981. Montreal Expos, 1982-1983. Philadelphia Phillies, 1984. San Francisco Giants, 1984. Los Angeles Dodgers, 1985. Toronto Blue Jays, 1985.\n\nThere were a couple of decent candidates to represent the zero. Adam Ottavino has fashioned himself a fine career in relief. Oddibe McDowell rocked the number for four seasons with Texas. But Oliver was an easy choice, a three-time Silver Slugger and seven-time All-Star. Oliver hit .300 in 11 seasons, including nine consecutive years from 1976 to 1985. He received MVP votes in 10 different seasons. An obvious inductee into the Hall of Very Good, Oliver remained a lively hitter into his mid-30s, punishing opposing pitchers with Texas and Montreal.\n\n00: Bobo Newsom\n\nRHP. Washington Senators, 1943, 1946-1947.\n\nA wide variety of players — from Don Baylor and Jose Canseco to Bobby Bonds and Jack Clark — wore No. 00, almost always in the late stages of their career. Louis Norman Newsom donned the double zero for three seasons, including 1946 when he received MVP consideration.\n\n1: Ozzie Smith\n\nSS. San Diego Padres, 1978-1981. St. Louis Cardinals, 1982-96.\n\nThe Wizard gets the nod over Lou Whitaker, Pee Wee Reese and Richie Ashburn, a formidable trio of contenders for this honor. Smith manned the sport’s most challenging position for two decades. He might have been the best to ever do it. Don’t believe me? Take three minutes to watch for yourself. No shortstop has won more Gold Gloves than Smith, who collected 13. He represented the National League in the All-Star Game 15 times. He inspired Jack Buck to tell fans to go crazy.\n\n2: Derek Jeter\n\nSS. New York Yankees, 1995-2014.\n\nYou could make a strong case for Charlie Gehringer. He was born in the exurbs of Detroit and spent 19 years with the Tigers. They called him the Mechanical Man because he played baseball like a metronome — steady and quiet and productive. He was worth 83.8 wins above replacement in his career. Yes, you could make a strong case for Gehringer. But if you did, you’d be flayed alive on social media and the BBWAA might strip your membership. So raise a toast to The Captain, Mr. November!\n\n3: Babe Ruth\n\nOF. New York Yankees, 1929-1934. Boston Braves, 1935.\n\nTough break for Jimmie Foxx. The Yankees actually started wearing uniform numbers in 1929, which means Ruth only wore No. 3 during his late-period seasons. You know, when he slashed .338/.468/.659 with 40 homers and 132 RBI a year. His decline phase, if you will.\n\n4: Lou Gehrig\n\n1B. New York Yankees, 1929-1939.\n\nIt was tough choosing between Gehrig and Mel Ott. They were close to equals as players — Gehrig was worth 114.1 bWAR, Ott was worth 110.7. Ott hit more homers. Gehrig had a better OPS. Gehrig had the better nickname, one of the best of all time, The Iron Horse. Ott, though, was blessed with the euphonic perfection of a one-syllable first name and one-syllable surname. There isn’t a lot of daylight here, but Gehrig gets the nod for his larger legacy in the sport.\n\n5: Albert Pujols\n\n1B. St. Louis Cardinals, 2001-2011. Los Angeles Angels, 2012-present.\n\nSo many icons wore this number: Joe DiMaggio, Brooks Robinson, Johnny Bench, George Brett. Even among that elite group, Pujols stands out. Only counting his 12 seasons, Pujols produced 91.5 bWAR, a total worth more than DiMaggio’s 12-year career (79.11 bWAR), Robinson’s 21 seasons (78.38), Bench’s 17 seasons (75.15) and all 19 of Brett’s years in Kansas City (88.6). Pujols was a terror as a Cardinal. His average season for St. Louis: .328/.420/.617, 40 homers, 41 doubles and 121 RBI.\n\nMusial after hitting his 300th home run in 1955 (Bettmann / Contributor)\n\n6: Stan Musial\n\n1B. St. Louis Cardinals, 1941-1963.\n\nI assume a lot of baseball fans are aware of the parallels between Musial and Ken Griffey Jr. — but come on, this puts the “fun fact” in “fun fact.” Both were born on Nov. 21. Both were born on Nov. 21 in Donora, Pa. That’s weird, man! The Wikipedia entry for famous Donorans consists of seven people: Musial, Griffey, Griffey’s father, a judge, a quarterback from the 1950s and two scientists who “investigated the 1948 Donora smog.” The Donora Smog Museum is set only a few blocks away from the house where Musial was born. You learn something new every day.\n\n7: Mickey Mantle\n\nOF. New York Yankees, 1951-1968.\n\nIt is interesting to revisit history with modern statistics. You can recast so many MVP races from the previous century and use analytics to correct imperfect votes. Unless, of course, the voters got it right the first time, like they did with Mantle in 1956 and 1957. He produced a combined 22.5 bWAR those seasons, each of which is considered one of the top 17 in baseball history.\n\n8: Cal Ripken Jr.\n\nSS. Baltimore Orioles, 1981-2001.\n\nThis story might be apocryphal, but there’s an old sportswriting yarn that one day in the midst of his permanent attendance, Ripken met with some writers in a visiting city. They all gathered around. And the first question was, “Cal, talk about the streak.” Indeed. I could have easily gone with Carl Yastrzemski here, but it was hard to pick between the two careers, and I wanted to tell that story.\n\n9: Ted Williams\n\nOF. Boston Red Sox, 1939-1960.\n\nOf all the indelible moments in Richard Ben Cramer’s iconic portrait of Williams, this is my favorite: Cramer is explaining why Williams, in his retirement, does not accept invitations to dinners: “One reason is he does not wear ties, and probably hasn’t suffered one five times in a quarter-century. Neither does he go to parties, where he’d have to stand around, with a drink in his hand, ‘listening to a lot of bullshit.’ No, he’d rather watch TV.” Never before had a mythic figure like Williams felt more relatable.\n\n10: Chipper Jones\n\n3B. Atlanta Braves, 1995-2012.\n\nMy favorite moment during the one year I covered the Yankees came before the season started. It was the spring of 2013. The team was decimated by injuries. Brian Cashman had just broken his leg jumping out of a plane. It was a strange time. One day before a Grapefruit League game, Cashman rolled up to a few writers. Jones had retired the previous autumn, but Cashman still had a vacancy at third base. So Cashman asked us writers if we could tweet that the Yankees wanted to sign Jones to gauge his interest. (Jones declined, and has remained retired.)\n\nLarkin wearing No. 11 in 1994; the Reds retired it in 2012. (Sporting News / Getty Images)\n\n11: Barry Larkin\n\nSS. Cincinnati Reds, 1988-2004.\n\nI had to choose between Larkin and Edgar Martinez. The on-base aficionado inside me leans toward Edgar, with his .418 career OBP. Mariano Rivera used to say Martinez was the toughest hitter he ever faced. But I still went with Larkin, the Cincinnati native who manned the middle of the Reds infield for 19 seasons. It was really close. Please don’t yell at me.\n\n12: Roberto Alomar\n\n2B. San Diego Padres, 1988-1990. Toronto Blue Jays, 1991-1995. Baltimore Orioles, 1996-1998. Cleveland Indians, 1999-2001. New York Mets, 2002-2003. Chicago White Sox, 2003-2004.\n\nAlomar’s homer off Dennis Eckersley in Game 4 of the 1992 ALCS erased a two-run deficit, prevented Oakland from taking a 3-1 lead in the series and kept the door open for Toronto to win back-to-back titles. The play might be memory-holed here in America — you almost never see it in highlight packages consisting of the sport’s most prominent moments — but it looms large in Canadian lore.\n\n13: Alex Rodriguez\n\n3B. New York Yankees, 2004-2016.\n\nWith apologies to Omar Vizquel, Dave Concepcion, Lance Parrish and Zack Greinke’s two seasons as with the Brewers, no player sported Lucky No. 13 with more style than A-Rod. He won two MVPs in New York, galvanized his team to a title in 2009, got suspended for performance-enhancing drugs, waged a year-long war against his own club and somehow emerged on the other side as one of baseball’s more lovable characters.\n\n14: Ernie Banks\n\n2B. Chicago Cubs, 1953-1971.\n\nPete Rose wore No. 14 for 24 seasons, long enough to merit serious consideration for this one. But let’s go with Banks, the 14-time All-Star and two-time MVP. There were a few other beloved options, though they resided on a lower tier than Banks and Rose: Gil Hodges, Jim Bunning, Jim Rice, Julio Franco, Paul Konerko.\n\n15: Carlos Beltran\n\nOF. Kansas City Royals, 2000-2004. Houston Astros, 2004, 2017. New York Mets, 2005-2011. San Francisco Giants, 2011.\n\nThe legacy of Beltran became complicated this winter when he emerged as one of the architects of Houston’s sign-stealing scheme. The scandal cost him his job as manager of the Mets. It might prevent his entry into the Hall of Fame. Is it enough to overshadow the rest of his achievements as a player? I just don’t know.\n\n16: Hal Newhouser\n\nRHP. Detroit Tigers, 1939-1953. Cleveland Indians, 1954-1955.\n\nWhenever I read a story about how the analytically driven clubs have destroyed the art of scouting, I think about Newhouser and Derek Jeter, and I remember the imperfection of this pursuit. Newhouser was a scout for the Astros in the 1990s. Newhouser, the AL MVP in 1944 and 1945, advised his club to select Jeter with the first pick of the 1992 draft. When the Astros picked Phil Nevin instead, Newhouser retired.\n\nHelton in 2013 (Doug Pensinger / Getty Images)\n\n17: Todd Helton\n\n1B. Colorado Rockies, 1997-2013.\n\nYou have some time to kill? You want to watch Helton play quarterback? I bet you do. He had a brief time behind center for Tennessee in 1994, when he was already established as a top-flight baseball prospect. The starter went down with a knee injury. Helton stepped up, only to injure his own knee. His replacement was Archie Manning’s kid. Helton focused on baseball. It worked out well for everyone.\n\n18: Johnny Damon\n\nOF. Kansas City Royals, 1996-2000. Boston Red Sox, 2002-2005. New York Yankees, 2006-2009. Detroit Tigers, 2010.\n\nNot an easy one, No. 18. Lots of interesting choices. Moises Alou, Jason Kendall, Ben Zobrist, a gentleman named Mel Harder who apparently wore these digits for the entirety of the 1930s with Cleveland. All worthy choices. Damon won two World Series, one as a bushy-bearded member of the curse-breaking 2004 Red Sox, another as a clean-shaven contributor to the 2009 Yankees. Damon was better than you think for longer than you remember.\n\n19: Robin Yount\n\nUT. Milwaukee Brewers, 1974-1993.\n\nHow can you choose between Yount and Tony Gwynn? Each man played 20 seasons with the team that drafted them. Gwynn hit at least .300 in every season he played after his rookie year. Yount won an MVP at 26 and another at 33. Gwynn was more consistent. Yount had a higher ceiling. It’s hard. There are no correct answers. I went with Yount because Baseball-Reference.com indicated he was worth about eight WAR more. But I don’t feel good about it. And I wouldn’t feel good going the other way, either.\n\n20: Mike Schmidt\n\n3B. Philadelphia Phillies, 1973-1989.\n\nSigh. I’m regretting this project. Frank Robinson is an icon, as both a player and a manager. So only another icon could supplant him in this position. Schmidt is the best third baseman in baseball history: 10 Gold Gloves, 548 home runs, a career .908 OPS.\n\n21: Roberto Clemente\n\nOF. Pittsburgh Pirates, 1955-1972.\n\nA book recommendation, as you wait for Opening Day: “Clemente” by David Maraniss. It is a sweeping portrait of Clemente’s life and the circumstances that led to his untimely death. Maraniss is able to suss out in detail Clemente’s interior life during his years with the Pirates. I would also read a Maraniss book about Warren Spahn, who also wore No. 21, but alas that book does not exist.\n\n22: Roger Clemens\n\nRHP. New York Yankees, 1999-2003, 2007. Houston Astros, 2004-2006.\n\nLike most rational, non-voting observers, I have deduced that neither Clemens nor Barry Bonds will meet the 75 percent threshold required by the BBWAA to reach the Hall of Fame. But every year, I track their votes because I’ve noticed an interesting pattern. Clemens usually gets at least one more vote than Bonds. Some years it is two or three more votes. Some years it is just one. But every year there is at least one person who believes Clemens merits entry into the Hall, and Bonds doesn’t. I’d be interested in that person’s process.\n\n23: Ryne Sandberg\n\n2B. Chicago Cubs, 1982-1997.\n\nHere are a few things I learned about Sandberg: The Hall of Famer’s middle name is Dee. His nickname when he was a younger player was “Gabby,” because he didn’t talk much. As a 36-year-old second baseman in 1996, despite sitting out the entirety of the previous year in retirement, he hit .244/.316/.444 with 25 homers. His last game at Wrigley Field was also the last game Harry Caray called at Wrigley.\n\n24: Willie Mays\n\nOF. New York Giants, 1951-1957. San Francisco Giants, 1958-1972. New York Mets, 1972-1973.\n\nHow great was Mays? What follows is a list of other players who wore No. 24: Rickey Henderson, Tony Perez, Ken Griffey Jr., Miguel Cabrera, Manny Ramirez, Dwight Evans, Robinson Cano and Early Wynn. And it remained a slam dunk to choose Mays. He won Rookie of the Year when he was 20. He led the National League in homers when 24, in OPS when he was 34 and in OBP when he was 40. He is the game’s greatest living player.\n\n25: Barry Bonds\n\nOF. San Francisco Giants, 1993-2007.\n\nBased on at least one metric, FanGraphs’ version of WAR, Bonds is responsible for the three best seasons in baseball since 1950: He was worth 12.7 WAR in 2002, 12.5 WAR in 2001 and 11.9 WAR in 2004. The only other players to author seasons worth 12 wins or more are Babe Ruth (five times), Lou Gehrig (once) and Rogers Hornsby (once). Bonds wore No. 24, to honor his godfather Willie Mays, as a Pirate. His years as a Giant were even more prodigious, and even the specter of his performance-enhancing drug usage can’t obscure that.\n\n26: Chase Utley\n\n2B. Philadelphia Phillies, 2003-2015. Los Angeles Dodgers, 2015-2018.\n\nWill Utley make the Hall of Fame? It’ll be close. He has a strong case on peak performance. From 2005 to 2010, among position players, only Albert Pujols was worth more WAR than Utley, according to FanGraphs. Utley made it to the majors a little late, though — he debuted at 24, and endured injuries in the back half of his career. He finished with 62.9 fWAR, which compares reasonably well to Hall of Fame second basemen such as Craig Biggio (65.8 fWAR), Roberto Alomar (63.6) and Ryne Sandberg (60.9).\n\n27: Mike Trout\n\nOF. Los Angeles Angels, 2011-present.\n\nThe least-productive full season of Trout’s career came in 2017. A thumb injury limited him to 114 games. He still hit 33 home runs. He led the American League in OBP and slugging percentage. He finished fourth in the MVP race. Again: This was the worst season of his career. He is a generational talent.\n\n28: Bert Blyleven\n\nRHP. Minnesota Twins, 1970-1976, 1985-1988. Texas Rangers, 1976-1977. Cleveland Indians, 1981-1985. California Angels, 1989-1990, 1992.\n\nBlyleven struck out 3,701 batters during his 22 seasons, more than any pitcher who ever graced the majors besides Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, Roger Clemens and Steve Carlton. Blyleven still spent the majority of his career residing beneath the radar of acclaim. He made only two All-Star teams. He received Cy Young Award votes in only four seasons, and never finished higher than third. He was perpetually overlooked, even past his retirement. He achieved his just due and made the Hall of Fame during his final year of eligibility.\n\n29: Adrian Beltre\n\n3B. Los Angeles Dodgers, 1998-2004. Seattle Mariners, 2006-2009. Boston Red Sox, 2010. Texas Rangers, 2011-2018.\n\nAfter he finished his contract with Seattle in 2009, Beltre returned to the open market. He took a one-year deal with a $9 million guarantee with Boston, turning down a pair of three-year, $24 million offers with Philadelphia and Oakland. He bet on himself. It was a shrewd move. Beltre got a six-year, $96 million deal from Texas the next winter. And he lived up to it during his time with the Rangers, re-emerging as one of the game’s best third basemen and a lock for the Hall of Fame.\n\n30: Tim Raines\n\nOF. Montreal Expos, 1980-1990, 2001. Chicago White Sox, 1991-1995. Oakland Athletics, 1999. Baltimore Orioles, 01. Florida Marlins, 2002.\n\nThe 1987 campaign of Raines is commendable on the surface. He posted a career-best .955 OPS, and subbed a slight diminishment in base-stealing (only 50) with the most homers he would ever hit in a season (18). Now consider this: Raines didn’t make his 1987 debut until May. He had reached free agency the year before, only to run smack into the teeth of collusion. Unable to find a fair deal elsewhere, he returned to the Expos and delivered a 6.7 WAR season, according to Baseball-Reference.com.\n\n31: Greg Maddux\n\nRHP. Chicago Cubs, 1986-1992, 2004-2006. Atlanta Braves, 1993-2003.\n\nFergie Jenkins and Dave Winfield could have slid into this spot. But does either man have a statistic named after him? Nope. A Maddux, in the accounting parlance, is a shutout completed in fewer than 100 pitches. The namesake did it 13 times. No other pitcher has done it more than six times. Maddux also offered one of my favorite baseball quotes, as anthologized by Tom Verducci of Sports Illustrated: “People think I’m smart? You know what makes you smart? Locate that fastball down and away.”\n\n32: Steve Carlton\n\nLHP. St. Louis Cardinals, 1965-1971. Philadelphia Phillies, 1972-1986. Chicago White Sox, 1986. San Francisco Giants, 1986. Cleveland Indians, 1987.\n\nLet’s get this out of the way. I am aware that Sandy Koufax wore No. 32. I opted for the long-term greatness of Carlton over the short-term transcendence of Koufax. Perhaps this was a mistake — we’ll see how things go in the comments. But Carlton was a magnificent pitcher, a four-time Cy Young Award winner who ranks fourth all-time in strikeouts, ninth in innings pitched and 11th in wins. Only seven pitchers in history faced more batters than Carlton did.\n\n33: Larry Walker\n\nOF. Montreal Expos, 1989-1994. Colorado Rockies, 1995-2004. St. Louis Cardinals, 2004-2005.\n\nWith his induction in January, Walker became only the second Canadian to reach the Hall of Fame. Fergie Jenkins was the first. Joey Votto has a chance to become the third. Otherwise, Walker and Jenkins are likely to be lonely representatives for their country. Walker reached on his 10th and final year of eligibility. He should have made it sooner. His numbers did inflate during his time in Colorado, but he remained a dangerous hitter deep into his 30s after leaving Coors Field for Busch Stadium.\n\nNolan Ryan pitching for the Astros in the mid-1980s. (Focus on Sport/ Getty Images)\n\n34: Nolan Ryan\n\nRHP. New York Mets, 1966-71. California Angels, 1972-79. Houston Astros, 1980-1988. Texas Rangers, 1989-1993.\n\nRyan pitched for a long, long time. How long? He wore No. 34 for 15 years. But he wore No. 30 for the entirety of the 1970s. Yes, 27 seasons is a long, long time. Ryan struck out more batters than anyone in history. He also walked more batters. He started more games than any pitcher not named Cy Young. He debuted seven years before the implementation of the designated hitter and he pitched his final season during the debut campaigns of the Marlins and Rockies.\n\n35: Phil Niekro\n\nRHP. Milwaukee Braves, 1964-1965. Atlanta Braves, 1966-1983, 1987. New York Yankees, 1984-1985. Cleveland Indians, 1986-1987. Toronto Blue Jays, 1987.\n\nThe only pitcher in the modern era to log more innings than Nolan Ryan? That would be Niekro. The knuckleball is a hell of a drug. Across his 24 seasons, Phil relied on the pitch more than his brother, Joe, who played 22 seasons of his own. Niekro was far from a prodigy. He didn’t reach the majors until he was 25. But he lasted, for decades, thanks to his floating baffler.\n\n36: Gaylord Perry\n\nRHP. San Francisco Giants, 1963-1971. Cleveland Indians, 1972-1975. Texas Rangers, 1975-1977, 1980. San Diego Padres, 1978-1979. New York Yankees, 1980. Atlanta Braves, 1981. Seattle Mariners, 1982-1983. Kansas City Royals, 1983.\n\nThis was a close call between Perry and Phillies stalwart Robin Roberts. I went with Perry because of the sheer gall it took to title his autobiography, “Me and The Spitter: An Autobiographical Confession.” That would be like calling the Astros’ 2017 World Series DVD, “The Boys and The Can.” The chutzpah from Perry is impressive. So was his career, which he finished with 314 wins.\n\n37: Dave Stieb\n\nRHP. Toronto Blue Jays, 1979-1992, 1998.\n\nStieb didn’t pitch in the 1992 postseason. He was waylaid by injuries that year, so the Blue Jays charged to their first championship without him on the mound. Stieb still earned a ring as a member of the club and got to be part of a milestone for a team he helped carry through the 1980s. Stieb made seven All-Star teams for Toronto. He won the ERA title in 1985, the year the Blue Jays won the American League East for the first time. He was a vital piece of franchise lore.\n\n38: Curt Schilling\n\nRHP. Philadelphia Phillies, 1992-2000. Arizona Diamondbacks, 2000-2003. Boston Red Sox, 2004-2007.\n\nIt is unclear if Schilling will ever make the Hall of Fame. We don’t need to delve into how his post-retirement commentary might have damaged his case. But on the merits, he should have gotten in on the first ballot. He won more games than John Smoltz. He had a lower ERA than Tom Glavine. He threw more innings than Pedro Martinez. He struck out more batters than Mike Mussina. He should have been inducted years ago.\n\n39: Dave Parker\n\nOF. Pittsburgh Pirates, 1973-1983. Cincinnati Reds, 1984-1987. Oakland Athletics, 1988-1989. Milwaukee Brewers, 1990. California Angels, 1991. Toronto Blue Jays, 1991.\n\nOutside of owning the best T-shirt of all time, Parker teamed with Willie Stargell as the best hitters on the 1979 champions. Parker won the MVP in 1978 and finished second in 1985 (although a reassessment of that season suggests Dwight Gooden should have run away with the award). Parker remained a slugging force through his 30s. He swatted 21 homers and 30 doubles for the Brewers in 1990, the year he turned 39.\n\nBartolo Colon pitched for the Rangers in 2018. (Tim Heitman / USA Today)\n\n40: Bartolo Colon\n\nRHP. Cleveland Indians, 1997-2002. Montreal Expos, 2002. Chicago White Sox, 2003, 2009. Los Angeles Angels, 2005-2007. Boston Red Sox, 2008. New York Yankees, 2011. Oakland Athletics, 2013. New York Mets, 2014-2016. Atlanta Braves, 2017. Minnesota Twins, 2017. Texas Rangers, 2018.\n\nColon pitched long enough to have three distinct career phases, a chronology that appears jumbled compared to most players. There was his time as a young flamethrower, from 1997 to 2005, when he won the American League Cy Young Award. There was his decline phase, over the next five years, as he battled a variety of injuries. And then there was his rejuvenation, when he was an All-Star for both the Athletics and the Mets.\n\n41: Tom Seaver\n\nRHP. New York Mets, 1967-1977, 1983. Cincinnati Reds, 1977-1982. Chicago White Sox, 1984-1986. Boston Red Sox, 1986.\n\nThe Franchise faced a robust challenge from longtime Braves infielder Eddie Mathews, but it is hard to argue with Seaver. He arrived in the majors fully formed as a No. 1 starter: Seaver was an All-Star in each of his first seven seasons, a period in which he won two of his three Cy Young Awards. He won 25 games for the 1969 Miracle Mets and led the National League with 18 complete games for the 1973 edition. At age 38, during a one-year reunion with the Mets, he logged 231 innings with a 3.55 ERA. Not bad!\n\n42: Jackie Robinson\n\n2B. Brooklyn Dodgers, 1947-1956.\n\nThis one should be self-explanatory. Mariano Rivera was the last to wear this number. Other luminaries include Dave Henderson, Mo Vaughn and Bruce Sutter.\n\n43: Dennis Eckersley\n\nRHP. Boston Red Sox, 1978-1984, 1998. Chicago Cubs, 1984-1986. Oakland Athletics, 1987-1995. St. Louis Cardinals, 1996-1997.\n\nEckersley has won acclaim over the past 20 years for his charming zaniness as a broadcaster and his equanimity when reminded of his prior failings (see: Gibson, Kirk) or confronted about his commentary (see: Price, David). He was also a darn good pitcher. After more than a decade as a quality starter, he became one of the best relievers in the sport’s history.\n\n44: Hank Aaron\n\nOF. Milwaukee Braves, 1955-1965. Atlanta Braves, 1966-1974. Milwaukee Brewers, 1975-1976.\n\nThe consistency and constancy of Aaron are breathtaking. He topped 40 homers for the first time in a season at 23, when he bopped 44. Sixteen years later, he hit 40 more (with a 1.045 OPS, by the way). He reached 755 bombs despite never hitting more than 47 in one season. To get there, he hit 30 or more in 15 different campaigns. Remarkable.\n\n45: Bob Gibson\n\nRHP. St. Louis Cardinals, 1960-1975.\n\nNow here is a debate. You have to win Game 7 of the No. 45 Derby. Your two choices are Gibson or Pedro Martinez. It’s hard to make a bad choice. Martinez tamed hitters at the height of the steroid era, and his stretch from 1997 to 2003 rivals Sandy Koufax’s prime. For Game 7, you should probably pick Pedro. But for an entire season? Gibson is tough to beat. His performance in 1968 contributed to sweeping changes in the game. Gibson holds the slight edge over Martinez for his durability while shouldering a heavy load in the 1960s.\n\n46: Andy Pettitte\n\nLHP. New York Yankees, 1995-2003, 2007-2010, 2012-2013.\n\nThis isn’t really relevant, but one time Pettitte was doing a postgame interview and he referred to Mark Trumbo as “Mark Trombone.” It was one of the most charming things I’ve witnessed on the baseball beat. Pettitte was a fierce competitor, who held himself to an exceedingly high standard. He was rarely pleased with himself, even after his best outings. His evolution from thrower to pitcher provided a template for teammates such as CC Sabathia and lefties across the land.\n\n47: Tom Glavine\n\nLHP. Atlanta Braves, 1987-2002, 2008. New York Mets, 2003-2007.\n\nIn June 1984, Glavine got drafted twice. The Los Angeles King took Glavine in the fourth round of the NHL Draft. Two days later, the Braves took him in the second round of MLB’s amateur draft. Glavine was a talented center. So why did he choose baseball? “The big thing that really influenced my decision was being a left-handed pitcher,” Glavine told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 1999. “I knew it gave me a distinct advantage in baseball that I didn’t possess in hockey.” Hard to argue with the Hall of Fame results.\n\n48: Rick Reuschel\n\nRHP. Chicago Cubs, 1972-1981, 1984. New York Yankees, 1984. Pittsburgh Pirates, 1985-1987. San Francisco Giants, 1987-1991.\n\nAccording to Baseball-Reference.com, five players have gone by the nickname of “Big Daddy,” a list comprised of Jeff D’Amico, Cecil Fielder, Matt Holliday, Stan Williams and Reuschel. So kudos to Reuschel, a veteran of 19 seasons, for achieving two sizable distinctions: He was the best No. 48 in baseball history, and the best “Big Daddy” in baseball history.\n\n49: Ron Guidry\n\nLHP. New York Yankees, 1975-1988.\n\nAmong the charms of Phil Hughes’ baseball card videos on YouTube is the personal connection the former Yankee holds with so many players and coaches. Here is what he had to say upon discovering a card featuring Guidry, a native of Louisiana, five-time Gold Glover and the 1978 American League Cy Young Award winner: “He was my first pitching coach coming up, he was the Yankees pitching coach, if you remember, in 2007. I liked Gator a lot. He would always make frog legs.”\n\n50: Mookie Betts\n\nOF. Boston Red Sox, 2014-2019.\n\nWhen will Betts get to wear this number for the Dodgers? During his six seasons in Boston, he accomplished enough — an MVP in 2018, four Gold Gloves, three Silver Sluggers — to outpace fellow No. 50s such as Adam Wainwright, Jamie Moyer and Sid Fernandez. The arrival of Betts in Los Angeles appeared to be the precise antidote to the Dodgers’ postseason drought. Now we wait to see when he will take the field with his new club.\n\nRandy Johnson pitching a no-hitter against the Detroit Tigers on June 3, 1990. (Duncan Livingston / Associated Press)\n\n51: Randy Johnson\n\nLHP. Montreal Expos, 1988-1989. Seattle Mariners, 1990-1998. Houston Astros, 1998. Arizona Diamondbacks, 1999-2004, 2007-2008. San Francisco Giants, 2009.\n\nJohnson is the best pitcher of all time. This is my opinion. It might be wrong. But I believe it. Look at what he did from 1995 to 2002: 2.61 ERA, 302 strikeouts per season, 220 innings per year, 1.069 WHIP. He led his league in strikeouts nine times in his career. His 2001 postseason was preposterous, with a 1.52 ERA in six outings, including the final four outs of the final game after throwing seven innings the night before.\n\n52: CC Sabathia\n\nLHP. Cleveland Indians, 2001-2008. Milwaukee Brewers, 2008. New York Yankees, 2009-2019.\n\nSabathia was about six weeks away from free agency when the Brewers asked him to pitch on short rest. Milwaukee had fired manager Ned Yost the day before Sabathia pitched on Sept. 16. During his final three outings, Sabathia went on only three days of rest. He pitched the Brewers into the playoffs, with 21 2/3 innings of 0.83 ERA baseball. He soon parlayed his resume into a $161 million contract with the Yankees. When the Yankees won the World Series that next autumn, Sabathia pitched on short rest for the duration of the postseason.\n\n53: Don Drysdale\n\nRHP. Brooklyn Dodgers, 1956-1957. Los Angeles Dodgers, 1958-1969.\n\nThe career of Drysdale was twinned with Sandy Koufax for obvious reasons. They spent a decade as teammates. They held out as a tandem before the 1966 season, one of the milestones on the path to free agency. After Koufax retired following that year, Drysdale made the All-Star team in 1967 and 1968, before arm injuries forced him into the broadcast booth.\n\n54: Goose Gossage\n\nRHP. Chicago White Sox, 1972-1976. Pittsburgh Pirates, 1977. New York Yankees, 1978-1983, 1989. San Diego Padres, 1984-1987. Chicago Cubs, 1988. San Francisco Giants, 1989. Texas Rangers, 1991. Oakland Athletics, 1992-1993. Seattle Mariners, 1994.\n\nGossage occupies a curious space for modern baseball fans. For anyone born after Generation X, Gossage is the cranky fellow ranting about the sport every spring. To be clear: Gossage painted himself into this corner. He got himself banned from visiting Yankees camp because he can’t stop himself from barking about those on his proverbial lawn. But as a pitcher, he was tremendous.\n\n55: Orel Hershiser\n\nRHP. Los Angeles Dodgers, 1983-1994, 2000. Cleveland Indians, 1995-1997. New York Mets, 1999.\n\nFull disclosure: I got to know Hershiser pretty well during my time covering the Dodgers. I consider him a friend. We dine together on the road on occasion. When fate brought us together at the poker table, he usually took it easy on me. He was less relenting on opposing hitters. During his first six full seasons in the majors, from 1984 to 1989, among starters, only Dwight Gooden posted an ERA lower than Hershiser’s 2.68. Hershiser won 98 games during those years — only Gooden (100) and Frank Viola (106) won more.\n\n56: Mark Buehrle\n\nLHP. Chicago White Sox, 2000-2011. Miami Marlins, 2012. Toronto Blue Jays, 2013-2015.\n\nOne time when I was on the Royals beat, Buehrle was starting on a Sunday getaway game against Jeremy Guthrie. These were two of the quickest workers in baseball. I thought it would be fun to see if the game lasted longer than The Clash’s “Sandinista!” The game wrapped up at 2:14. The record lasted 2:24. Bless Mark Buehrle.\n\nJohan Santana celebrates his no-hitter for the Mets in 2012. (Mike Stobe / Getty Images)\n\n57: Johan Santana\n\nLHP. Minnesota Twins, 2000-2007. New York Mets, 2008-2012.\n\nAn icon for two different franchises, Santana won a pair of Cy Young Awards as a Twin and authored the only no-hitter in Mets history. He had a peak worthy of the Hall of Fame, but shoulder injuries prevented him from securing the longevity.\n\n58: Jonathan Papelbon\n\nRHP. Boston Red Sox, 2005-2011. Philadelphia Phillies, 2012-2015. Washington Nationals, 2015-2016.\n\nWon a World Series. Set a record for the most lucrative free-agent contract for a reliever. Fought his own teammate in broad daylight. That’s a career, baby.\n\n59: Carlos Carrasco\n\nRHP. Cleveland Indians, 2009-present.\n\nCarrasco was a worthy selection for The Athletic MLB’s Person of the Year in 2019. Don’t take my word for it. Let Zack Meisel tell you why. Carrasco has spent the entirety of his career in Cleveland. Only 10 active players have spent more days in one uniform than Carrasco, who debuted in September 2009.\n\n60: Dallas Keuchel\n\nLHP. Houston Astros, 2012-2018. Atlanta Braves, 2019.\n\nBlame it on the social distancing, but I found myself cracking up the other day about Coach Finstock’s advice in “Teen Wolf,” which included: “Never play cards with a guy who’s got the same first name as a city.” Anyway, Keuchel was incredible in 2015.\n\n61: Liván Hernández\n\nLHP. Florida Marlins, 1996-1999. San Francisco Giants, 1999-2002. Montreal Expos, 2003-2004. Washington Nationals, 2005-2006, 2010-2011. Arizona Diamondbacks, 2006-2007. Colorado Rockies, 2008. Minnesota Twins, 2008. New York Mets, 2009. Atlanta Braves, 2012. Milwaukee Brewers, 2012.\n\nAdam Kilgore of the Washington Post once described Hernández as “a right-hander with spaghetti in his arm.” Livo did not throw hard, but he threw often. Hernández made 30 or more starts in 13 different seasons, wearing No. 61 in each of them.\n\n62: José Quintana\n\nLHP. Chicago White Sox, 2012-2017. Chicago Cubs, 2017-present.\n\nJoba Chamberlain was on the path to being History’s Greatest No. 62 before injuries derailed his career. Quintana was actually a Yankees farmhand during the years of the Joba Rules. He didn’t attain prominence until the White Sox signed him as a minor-league free agent for 2012.\n\n63: Rafael Betancourt\n\nRHP. Cleveland Indians, 2003-2009. Colorado Rockies, 2009-2015.\n\nWe can sum up Betancourt with this delightful couplet from MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince: “It took Michelangelo four years to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. It takes Rafael Betancourt nearly that long to pitch an inning of a baseball game.” Castrovince wrote those lines after Betancourt twice got called for an automatic ball for taking too long in between pitches … in 2007.\n\n64: Emilio Bonifacio\n\nUT. Kansas City Royals, 2013. Chicago Cubs, 2014. Chicago White Sox, 2015. Atlanta Braves, 2016-2017.\n\nBonifacio had his best season, 2011 with the Marlins, while wearing No. 1. But he moved into sexagenarian territory as he approached his 30s. Bonifacio hasn’t played in the majors since 2017, but he was in camp with Washington this spring on a minor-league deal, hoping to make it back to the bigs at age 34.\n\n65: Phil Hughes\n\nRHP. New York Yankees, 2007-2013.\n\nHughes had an admirable career for a variety of reasons, including this tweet. He was an important cog in the Yankees bullpen during their 2009 championship run. He was a credible starting pitcher for half a decade. He made an All-Star team and bundles of money. In his retirement, he started an entertaining YouTube channel. What more can you ask for?\n\nYasiel Puig homering in the 2018 World Series. (Harry How / Getty Images)\n\n66: Yasiel Puig\n\nOF. Los Angeles Dodgers, 2013-2018. Cincinnati Reds, 2019. Cleveland Indians, 2019.\n\nIf they play baseball in 2020, where will Puig play it? He remained unsigned as the sport went on hiatus. There were rumors about him receiving offers from Japan and Korea. His time with the Dodgers was fascinating.\n\n67: Francisco Córdova\n\nRHP. Pittsburgh Pirates, 1996-2000.\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Córdova handled the initial nine innings of the first combined, extra-innings no-hitter in baseball history. His pal Ricardo Rincón recorded the final three outs before reserve Mark Smith hit a walk-off in the bottom of the 10th. “I wanted to keep going,” Córdova said. “But it wasn’t my decision.” We’ve all been there.\n\n68: Dellin Betances\n\nRHP. New York Yankees, 2011-2019.\n\nBetances was an excellent reliever with the Yankees. He also played an unfortunate role in a spat that revealed the lack of nuance in the arbitration system. He lost his case before the 2017 season, when he requested $5 million, and received a $3 million payday. The dispute prompted an all-time quote from Yankees president Randy Levine. “It’s like me saying, ‘I’m not the president of the Yankees; I’m an astronaut,'” Levine said. “No, I’m not an astronaut, and Dellin Betances is not a closer.” Simpler times.\n\n69: Bronson Arroyo\n\nRHP. Pittsburgh Pirates, 2000-2002.\n\nI’ll be honest: I had no memory of Arroyo pitching for Pittsburgh. In my mind’s eye, he was a rookie on the 2003 Red Sox. In truth, the Pirates waived him that February. All in all, a nice career.\n\n70: George Kontos\n\nRHP. New York Yankees, 2011, 2018. San Francisco Giants, 2012-2017. Cleveland Indians, 2018.\n\nKontos has a 6.14 career postseason ERA, but he also pitched four scoreless outings for the Giants in their rollicking NLDS victory over Cincinnati in 2012, so I suppose it evens out.\n\n71: Wade Davis\n\nRHP. Chicago Cubs, 2017. Colorado Rockies, 2018-present.\n\nDavis is the best player to wear No. 71, but his best years came when he wore No. 17. He switched to that number in 2014 to honor his stepbrother, Dustin Huguley, who had passed away the year before.\n\n72: Carlton Fisk\n\nC. Chicago White Sox, 1981-1993.\n\nThe career of Fisk was remarkable. He made his first All-Star team at 24. He made his last at 43. In between, he created one of the most iconic images in Red Sox history. After 11 seasons in Boston, Fisk stayed sturdy behind the plate for another 13 years in Chicago.\n\n73: Tony Phillips\n\nIF/OF. Anaheim Angels, 1997. Chicago White Sox, 1997.\n\nPhillips played for 18 seasons and exasperated pitchers during most of them. His eye at the plate was keen. He was also the first player Mariano Rivera struck out in the majors. When asked about facing Rivera in 2013, Phillips, then 53, replied, “I would either walk or get a fucking knock. He ain’t gonna punch me out.”\n\n74: Kenley Jansen\n\nRHP. Los Angeles Dodgers, 2010-present.\n\nYou could spend a while arguing about who was the best reliever of the 2010s. But you need only three guesses to name the three best relievers of the decade: Craig Kimbrel, Aroldis Chapman and Jansen. From 2011 to 2017, Jansen fanned 14 batters per nine innings and struck out more than six batters for every guy he walked.\n\nZito in 2015, which would be his last season. (Stephen Dunn / Getty Images)\n\n75: Barry Zito\n\nLHP. Oakland Athletics, 2001-2006, 2015. San Francisco Giants, 2007-2013.\n\nIn order to win three times in five seasons, a cavalcade of improbabilities must occur. Improbabilities like Game 5 of the 2012 NLCS, when Zito logged 7 2/3 scoreless innings in an elimination game at Busch Stadium to ignite the Giants coming back from a 3-1 deficit. Zito struggled often during his time as a Giant — one doubts the fanbase much cares, in retrospect.\n\n76: José Iglesias\n\nSS. Boston Red Sox, 2011.\n\nA bunch of players wore this one as something of a numerical waystation, holding onto the high number until getting sent back to the minors. Iglesias traded it for single digits as he bounced from Detroit to Cincinnati and got nearly a decade’s worth of service time.\n\n77: Joe Medwick\n\nOF. Brooklyn Dodgers, 1940-1941.\n\nNot to slight Reggie Willits and D.J. Carrasco, but Medwick was a 10-time All-Star and won a Triple Crown.\n\n78: Julio Urias\n\nLHP. Los Angeles Dodgers, 2016.\n\nUrias downsized to No. 7 after his rookie season. But his rookie season might have been his best. He debuted at age 19 and aided the team as both a starter and a reliever in October. He’s been working back from injuries to reclaim that spot ever since.\n\n79: José Abreu\n\n1B. Chicago White Sox, 2014-present.\n\nThere’s a chance — maybe not a likelihood, but at least a chance — the White Sox retire Abreu’s No. 79 someday. He is adored by both teammates and his employers. His production has ebbed and flowed during his six seasons in the majors, but he has been a relatively steady contributor during a rocky time for the franchise.\n\n80: Ryan Eades\n\nRHP. Minnesota Twins, 2019.\n\nOnly one ballplayer has worn Jerry Rice’s digits in the majors. Eades appeared in two games with Minnesota last season before getting traded to Baltimore. As an Oriole, he donned the more pedestrian No. 36.\n\n81: Eddie Guardado\n\nLHP. Cincinnati Reds, 2006-2007.\n\nThey called him “Everyday Eddie.” He pitched for 17 years. He made two All-Star teams. He wore No. 18 for most of them, but swapped his digits in Cincinnati because the Reds had retired 18 to honor Ted Kluszewski.\n\n82: Johnny Lazor\n\nOF. Boston Red Sox, 1943.\n\nLazor spent only 83 games sporting No. 82, and no one has followed in his footsteps. He got called up when Ted Williams and Dom DiMaggio went to war. After the regulars returned post-war, Lazor spent a few more years in the minors before hanging them up.\n\n83: Eric Gagne\n\nRHP. Boston Red Sox, 2007.\n\nI chose Gagne’s brief spell in Boston over Justin Turner’s cameo in Baltimore because I wanted you to watch this at-bat. This is the greatest at-bat of all time. I watch it every few months. I know the outcome and it is still riveting.\n\nFielder follows through in 2016. (Jim Cowsert / USA Today)\n\n84: Prince Fielder\n\n1B. Texas Rangers, 2014-16.\n\nWhen Detroit traded Fielder to the Rangers before the 2014 season, Fielder ditched No. 28. He selected the year of his birth, to signify rejuvenation. A series of neck injuries ended Fielder’s career in 2016. He acquitted himself admirably during his 12 years in the majors, with 319 homers, an average OPS of .887 and six All-Star appearances.\n\n85: Luis Cessa\n\nRHP. New York Yankees, 2016-present.\n\nCessa was part of the package the Mets sent to Detroit to acquire Yoenis Céspedes in 2015. The other piece? Michael Fulmer. One of the impossible things about predicting baseball is how volatile young pitchers can be. Fulmer looked like a future Cy Young Award candidate during his first two seasons in Detroit. He hasn’t pitched since September 2018, having undergone knee surgery and Tommy John surgery.\n\n86: Never worn.\n\n87: Dan Otero\n\nRHP. San Francisco Giants, 2012.\n\nOtero wore this number briefly, before embarking on a career in relief that took him to Oakland and Cleveland. He was trying to make the Yankees on a minor-league deal when the season shut down.\n\n88: Albert Belle\n\nOF. Baltimore Orioles, 1999-2000.\n\nIn terms of sociological impact, it is tough to ignore Gerardo Parra’s one season wearing No. 88, when his walkup music captivated and confounded baseball fans across the land. In terms of actually being good at baseball, Belle was one of the 1990s’ most fearsome hitters.\n\n89: Never worn.\n\n90: Adam Cimber\n\nLHP. San Diego Padres, 2018. Cleveland Indians, 2018-present.\n\nCimber was, you guessed it, born in 1990.\n\n91: Hideo Nomo\n\nRHP. Kansas City Royals, 2008.\n\nJosé Guillén occupied Nomo’s No. 11 when Nomo arrived in Kansas City for what would be his final year in the majors. Nomo hadn’t pitched in the majors in two seasons before his three-outing denouement as a Royal.\n\n92: Never worn.\n\n93: Pat Neshek\n\nRHP. Philadelphia Phillies, 2018-present.\n\nNeshek, the veteran sidearmer, decided to become the inaugural No. 93 after signing with the Phillies.\n\n94: José Mesa\n\nRHP. Detroit Tigers, 2007.\n\nCredit to The Athletic’s Jayson Stark, back during his days of writing for another website, for preserving in internet amber this quote from Mesa after Omar Vizquel criticized Mesa in his autobiography: “If I face him 10 more times, I’ll hit him 10 times. I want to kill him.” Ballplayer feuds aren’t what they used to be.\n\n95: Takahito Nomura\n\nLHP. Milwaukee Brewers, 2002.\n\nNomura is the only player in baseball history to wear No. 95. He chose it himself because it was the same number he wore with the Yomiuri Giants. Nomura appeared in only 21 games before heading back to Japan. He was not very good. He lives on through his numerical uniqueness.\n\n96: Bill Voiselle\n\nRHP. Boston Braves, 1947-1949. Chicago Cubs, 1950.\n\nHis nickname was “Big Bill.” In case you were wondering.\n\n97: Joe Beimel\n\nLHP. Tampa Bay Rays, 2005. Los Angeles Dodgers, 2006-2008. Washington Nationals, 2009. Colorado Rockies, 2009-2010. Pittsburgh Pirates, 2011. Seattle Mariners, 2014-2015.\n\nThe internet’s memory is infinite. “How he ended up with the Dodgers, I don’t know. But thank God it happened.”\n\n98: Onelki Garcia\n\nLHP. Los Angeles Dodgers, 2013.\n\nGarcia rocked No. 98 for three games. He was the first of his number, and thus far the only.\n\n99: Manny Ramirez\n\nOF. Los Angeles Dodgers, 2008-2010, Chicago White Sox, 2010.\n\nMaybe in a few years, Aaron Judge or Hyun-Jin Ryu might supplant Ramirez. The legacy of Mannywood still lives on, a decade after his departure from Chavez Ravine. One time in college, while watching the Dodgers in the playoffs, I was arguing with a few friends about who was the best hitter in baseball. I insisted it was Albert Pujols. My friends argued it was Ramirez. We decided we would settle the debate with Ramirez’s next at-bat. And then he did this.\n\n(Top graphic: Adrian Guzman / The Athletic)"
