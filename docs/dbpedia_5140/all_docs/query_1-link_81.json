        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers are one of the most recognized organizations in American sports.\n\nIn fact, they share with the Boston Celtics the honor of being the NBA franchise with the most championships, 17, adding their stay in California and their past in Minneapolis during their first years of existence.\n\nDuring this journey, there is no team that has had more basketball legends, which makes its list of retired jerseys the most exclusive in the in the world.\n\nA list that will soon be joined by Pau Gasol, whose number 16 will hang from the ceiling of the Crypto.com Arena along with some of the best basketball players who ever stepped on a basketball court.\n\nTwelve bibs and a microphone will hang from the ceiling. The latter in honor of Chick Hearn, legendary commentator of the Lakers from the 1960s until 2002.\n\nAmong other curiosities are the two numbers retired from Kobe Bryant, 8 and 24; and the recent inclusion of George Mikan, the first great dominator of the NBA with the Minneapolis Lakers.\n\nComplete list of numbers retired by the Los Angeles Lakers\n\nJamal Wilkes (52)\n\nSmall forward of the 'Showtime' Lakers. He played 575 regular league games with the franchise and won three rings.\n\nWilt Chamberlain (13)\n\nThe man-of-record played a total of five seasons with the Lakers and won the 1972 ring with them. He totaled 339 games with the purple and gold and was an All-Star four times with them.\n\nElgin Baylor (22)\n\nEternally underrated, Baylor was in charge of making the transition between Minneapolis and Los Angeles without suffering along the way. Between the two cities he totaled 14 seasons and 846 games from 1958 to 1972 without winning a single ring with them. The only one on the list who lacks costume jewelry.\n\nGail Goodrich (25)\n\nInseparable partner of Jerry West in the Lakers of the 60s and 70s. He spent two stints with the club from 1965 to 1968 and, after a stint in Phoenix, from 1970 to 1976. He played 687 games and won the '72 ring.\n\nKobe Bryant (8 and 24)\n\nHe played from 1996 to 2016, playing 1198 games and winning five championship rings. He is the only player with two retired numbers, wearing each for 10 years.\n\nJerry West (44)\n\nThe logo of the NBA. One of the greatest legends in the history of the Angelinos who played 14 seasons, reached the Finals nine times and won the 1972 ring. He is the only MVP of the Finals playing for the losing team. After retiring, he became one of the most successful managers in NBA history.\n\nEarving 'Magic' Johnson (32)\n\nThe second candidate to be the best gold and purple in history. He changed the future of the franchise in 1979 and was the great on-court promoter of Showtime. He played 12 seasons until 1991, when he had to retire affected by the HIV virus. He returned briefly for the 95-96 season to complete his 906 games and five championship rings.\n\nJames Worthy (42)\n\nAnother of the great stars of the golden era of Showtime. The power forward came to the Lakers as number one in the draft and retired there in 1994. He played a total of 926 games and won three rings.\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar (32)\n\nOne of the best players in history. His 'Sky Hook' is a world sport heritage. He came from Milwaukee to the Lakers in 1975 and played there 14 seasons, 1019 games and earned five championship rings in addition to the one he won with the Bucks.\n\nShaquille O'Neal (34)\n\nHe arrived at the Lakers in 1996 and reigned with an iron fist during the first years of the new century. He won three consecutive rings in 2000, 2001 and 2002 with two Finals MVP awards. He played 514 games before leaving for Miami in 2004.\n\nGeorge Mikan (99)\n\nThe first great 'laker' legend and the last to have retired his dorsal before Pau. He only played during his time in Minneapolis, inaugurating the NBA as a unified league in 1948. He played seven seasons in which he won five championships."
