        "text": "Hey folks, it’s quiz time. This isn’t school — it’s the summer version.\n\nThat is, it’s meant to be fun.\n\nGrab a pen or a pencil. Challenge your pals. And see how you do.\n\n1. Can you name a Hall of Famer who played his entire career with one club and led that club in home runs in 18 consecutive seasons?\n\n2. Which, if any, of these has happened in World Series play?\n\na) A batter hit for the cycle.\n\nb) A pitcher throw a perfect game.\n\nc) A fielder turn an unassisted triple play.\n\nd) A runner steal home.\n\ne) A manager make a substitution because he was ordered to do so by the Commissioner of Baseball.\n\n3. Who is the only person to have won the Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player and Manager of the Year awards during his career?\n\n4. Can you name five men who managed both the Yankees and the Mets? (Bonus points: Which two of these five played for the Phillies before they managed?\n\n5. Between 1980 and 1991 (12 seasons), Rickey Henderson led the American League in stolen bases 11 times. Which player interrupted that streak in 1987?\n\n6. In 1907 Roger Bresnahan became the first catcher to wear shin guards. He strapped on equipment already in use in another sport. What was that sport?\n\n7. Can you name the only player in history who was twice traded for Cy Young Award-winning pitchers? (Hint, this player is still active, but the last time he was dealt it was for a player to be named later.)\n\n8. Can you name a player who played for a World Champion baseball team and three NBA championship teams?\n\n9. Browns, Colt .45s, Highlanders, Pilots and Robins were all nicknames used and eventually abandoned by teams in the 20th Century. By what names are those teams known today?\n\n10. What player played the most career games at shortstop? (Hint: He is not in the Hall of Fame.)\n\n11. Which current manager is the son of a man who also managed in the majors?\n\n12. The home team trails by one run in the bottom of the ninth inning. With the bases loaded the manager orders a suicide squeeze and all three runners break as soon as the pitch is released. The bunt is popped up and fielded on the fly by the pitcher, who then jogs over to first base and doubles the runner for the third out. While the visiting players are high-fiving one another in the infield, the home team manager approaches the home plate umpire and points out, correctly, that the runner from third scored before the third out was recorded and therefore the game is tied.\n\nThe umpire should:\n\na) Inform the manager that the run cannot count and the game is over.\n\nb) Inform the visiting team that the run counts and it needs to prepare to play the tenth inning.\n\nc) Inform the manager that the runner left third base illegally and the run will count only if the visiting team leaves the field without making an appeal at third base.\n\nd) Rule that the popped up bunt was an infield fly and the batter is out but the ball is dead.\n\n13. Can you identify the Hall of Famers associated with the following nicknames?\n\na) The Iron Horse\n\nb) The Flying Dutchma\n\nc) The Big Train\n\nd) The Splendid Splinter\n\ne) The Georgia Peach\n\n14. What franchises were associated with these names?\n\na) The Gashouse Gang\n\nb) The Lumber Company\n\nc) Harvey’s Wallbangers\n\nd) The Hitless Wonders\n\ne) Murderer’s Row\n\n15. Between 1932 and 1950 the Homestead Grays of the Negro Leagues split their home games between two different cities. Can you name the cities?\n\n16. Can you name a Hall of Fame manager who began his managerial career with Trenton’s Interstate League team?\n\n17. Prior to Billy Martin, who was the last Yankee to wear uniform number 1?\n\n18. Which major league park was the first to install lights and play a night game?\n\n19. Can you name the future U.S. President who played in the 1947 College World Series?\n\n20. Only once were there batting triple-crown winners in the National and American Leagues in the same season and those two players played in the same city that year. Can you name the players and the city? (You get a bonus if you can name the year as well.)\n\nSuper Bonus Question: There are three rules for postseason games that do not apply to regular season games. How many can you name? Anyone who can name all three can go to the head of the class.\n\nThe answers will appear next week.\n\nFormer Hall of Fame voter Jay Dunn has written baseball for The Trentonian for 56 years.
