        "text": "# Player Date/Year Retired 1 Billy Martin August 10th, 1986 2 Derek Jeter May 14, 2017 3 Babe Ruth June 13th, 1948 4 Lou Gehrig July 4th, 1939** 5 Joe DiMaggio April 18th, 1952 6 Joe Torre August 23, 2014 7 Mickey Mantle June 8th, 1969 8 Yogi Berra July 22nd, 1972 8 Bill Dickey July 22nd, 1972 9 Roger Maris July 22nd, 1984* 10 Phil Rizzuto August 4th, 1985 15 Thurman Munson September 20th, 1980 16 Whitey Ford August 3rd, 1974 20 Jorge Posada August 22nd, 2015 21 Paul O'Neill August 21st, 2022 23 Don Mattingly August 31st, 1997 32 Elston Howard July 22nd, 1984* 37 Casey Stengel August 8th, 1970 42 Mariano Rivera September 22, 2013 44 Reggie Jackson August 14th, 1993 46 Andy Pettitte August 23rd, 2015 49 Ron Guidry August 23rd, 2003 51 Bernie Williams May 24th, 2015\n\nNotes:\n\nIn 1997, MLB retired Jackie Robinson's number 42 meaning no other player in MLB could ever wear it. However, it was grandfathered to anyone who was currently wearing the number. Of course, Mariano Rivera was one of those already sporting #42 so when Mariano's number 42 was retired on September 22, 2013, the number hung alongside all the other retired numbers was changed to the Yankee pinstriped style with matching font. To honor Robinson, a plaque was placed in Monument Park.\n\nMariano Rivera is the only Yankee to appear as an active player while wearing his retired number.\n\nSix Yankees wore their previously retired numbers in a managerial/coaching role: Billy Martin, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, Whitey Ford, Don Mattingly and Ron Guidry.\n\nMariano Rivera and Whitey Ford are the only two Yankees to have their numbers retired while still wearing them in an active role on the team (Mariano was still playing and Whitey was a coach in 1974 when the number was retired.) (Thanks Michael R. from Irvine, CA)\n\nOf all the numbers that have been retired, only Bill Dickey would later go on to wear a different uniform, #33, as a coach (Thanks again to Michael R.)\n\n*Michael R. from Irvine, CA notes that #9 and #32 were planned for retirement on Saturday, July 21, 1984 (Old-Timer's Day), but rain resulted in a cancellation and the ceremonies were moved to the next day.\n\n**Michael R. from Irvine, CA notes that the 2013 Yankees Media guide states that while Gehrig's number retirement was announced to the public (an on-field announcement by co-owner Ed Barrow) on that famous July 4, 1939 afternoon, the number wasn't \"officially\" retired until January 6, 1940. For the purposes of this website, I'll choose to go with the more widely accepted first announcement of July 4, 1939 as the retirement date, but in the interest of completeness, I felt the unusual January 6th \"announcement\" deserved mention. Here's a link to an archived article."
