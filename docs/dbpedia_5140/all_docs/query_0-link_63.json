        "text": "Every year, on the anniversary of Jackie Robinson’s big league debut, the baseball world pauses to remember his unmatched contributions to the game.\n\nIn 1997, Commissioner Bud Selig made sure Robinson's work would be honored for all time by permanently retiring his No. 42.\n\nIn a ceremony before the April 15, 1997, game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the New York Mets at Shea Stadium, Selig declared that No. 42 – Robinson's number with the Brooklyn Dodgers – would be permanently retired throughout Major League Baseball. Players who were wearing No. 42 at the time were allowed to continue with the number, with the understanding that no more would follow.\n\nThe New York Yankees' Mariano Rivera, who retired following the 2013 season, was the last active player to wear No. 42."
