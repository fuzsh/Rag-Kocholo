        "text": "Boston Red Sox left fielder Alex Verdugo wears number 99. Closer Kenley Jansen wears number 74. At first glance, you may think these are not typical baseball uniform numbers. The organization has 11 options that are immediately unavailable. The Red Sox retired numbers include 10 players that are forever Yawkey Way legends, and one player who is forever a MLB legend.\n\nThe Red Sox first retired a uniform number in 1984. It was #4 which belonged to Joe Cronin, who spent 48 years in baseball. The nod was to honor the fact that Cronin was a player, manager, and executive with Boston. Five days later (May 29, 1984) the Red Sox retired Ted Williams’ #9. It would be four years until another number was retired with Bobby Doerr.\n\nIn April of 1997 all of Major League Baseball retired #42 in honor of Jackie Robinson.\n\nWalking into Fenway Park you will see banners draped along the outside walls of the stadium honoring each player who has their number retired. You will also see them displayed high above right field inside the park, complimenting the Pesky pole.\n\nSo, if you are catching a game this year and wondering why a starting pitcher like Nick Pivetta is sporting #37, it’s important to know what his options were to select from. Here are the Red Sox retired numbers."
