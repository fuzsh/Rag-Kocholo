        "text": "Photo: AP\n\nNew York Yankees retire Derek Jeter's No. 2\n\nThe New York Yankees will retire legendary shortstop Derek Jeter's No. 2 on Sunday in a pregame ceremony prior to a 7:30 p.m. game against the Houston Astros.\n\nJeter, a 14-time All-Star, is considered to be one of the most popular players in New York Yankees history. He retired following the 2014 season. The future Hall of Famer collected 3,465 hits, sixth most in baseball history, and won five World Series titles with the Yankees over his 20-season career.\n\nThe Yankees will also give him a plaque in Monument Park at Yankee Stadium.\n\nJeter will become the 22nd player to have his number retired by the Yankees. Here is a look at the Yankees legends Jeter will join in that club.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo.1 Billy Martin\n\nBilly Martin's No. 1 was retired by the Yankees in 1986.\n\nMartin played an integral part in four World Series in the 1950's as a player and added another ring managing the Yankees in 1977. His .333 lifetime World Series batting average is fourth with at least 75 at-bats on the all-time list.\n\nMartin famously was fired and re-hired by former Yankees owner George Steinbrenner five times.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo.3 Babe Ruth\n\n\"Heroes get remembered, but legends never die\"\n\nThat's what a fictional Babe Ruth told young Benny Rodriguez in the movie 'The Sandlot.'\n\nRuth is baseball's greatest legend and one of its most colorful figures.\n\n'The Sultan of Swat' was sold to the Yankees for $120,000 by Red Sox owner Harry Frazee in 1920 and his 54 home runs that year were more than any other American-League team.\n\nRuth hit 714 career home runs,, hitting 60 in 1927. He led the Yankees to seven World Series appearances, winning four titles.\n\nRuth is a member of the inaugural class of Baseball Hall of Fame inductees in 1936.\n\nHis No. 3 was retired by the Yankees in 1948.\n\nAP\n\nNo. 4 Lou Gehrig\n\nLou Gehrig played in 2,130 consecutive games for the Yankees between 1925 and 1939.\n\nGehrig drove in at least 100 runs for 13 straight seasons (1926-38) and established an American-League record with 184 RBI in 1931.\n\nGehrig compiled a .340 lifetime batting average and hit 493 home runs in a career shortened by terminal illness.\n\nHe was honored at Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939 where he delivered the famous \"luckiest man on the face of the earth\" speech.\n\nGehrig was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1939. His number was retired by the Yankees that same year.\n\nAP\n\nNo. 5 Joe DiMaggio\n\nThe \"Yankee Clipper\" is one of the best all-around baseball players in history.\n\nDiMaggio compiled a .325 lifetime batting average from 1936 to 1951. DiMaggio, a three-time MVP, powered the Yankees to the first of four consecutive World Championships in his 1936 rookie season.\n\nDiMaggio's 56-consecutive-game batting streak, set in 1941, still stands as a record today. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1955.\n\nThe Yankees retired his No. 5 in 1952.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo. 6 Joe Torre\n\nJoe Torre managed the Yankees to 1,173 regular season wins between 1996 and 2007.\n\nTorre won 10 division titles, six American League pennants and World Series championships in 1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000.\n\nThe Brooklyn native earned American League Manager of the Year honors in 1996 and 1998.\n\nHis No. 6 was retired by the Yankees in 2014. He was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo. 7 Mickey Mantle\n\n\"The Mick\" is one of the most popular players in Yankees history. He led the Yankees to 12 World Series appearances in 14 years that included seven World Championships.\n\nHe still owns records for most homers, RBI, runs, walks, and strikeouts in World Series play.\n\nIn 1956, Mantle had one of the greatest seasons ever at the plate. He hit 52 homers with 130 RBI and a .353 average to win baseball's Triple Crown.\n\nMantle spent his entire 18-year career with the Yankees, finishing with 536 home runs.\n\nMantle was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1974. The Yankees retired his No. 7 in 1969.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo. 8 Bill Dickey\n\nBill Dickey is one of the greatest and most durable catchers in baseball history. He caught more than 100 games in 13 consecutive seasons (1929-41), an American-League record.\n\nDickey hit over .300 in 10 of his first 11 seasons while hitting 202 homers during his career. He handled Yankee pitching staffs on eight World Series teams, winning seven championships.\n\nThe Yankees retired his No. 8 in 1972.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo. 8 Yogi Berra\n\nYogi Berra was a beloved Yankee for his play on the field and famous for expressions like \"it ain't over till it's over\" and \"it's like deja vu all over again.\"\n\nHe won three Most Valuable Player awards and was selected to play in 15 successive All-Star games.\n\nHe played on 14 pennant winners and 10 world championship teams for the Yankees.\n\nThe former catcher also led the Yankees to the 1964 pennant as manager.\n\nHe was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1972. The Yankees retired his number in 1972.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo. 9 Roger Maris\n\nIn 1961, Maris hit 61 home runs, a Major-League record which stood until 1998 and is still the American-League mark.\n\nThe two-time American League MVP (1960-'61) is also considered as one of the best fielding right fielders in Yankee history.\n\nThe Yankees retired his number in 1984.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nNo. 10 Phil Rizzuto\n\n\"Scooter\" played for the Yankees for 13 seasons and went to the World Series in 10 of those seasons.\n\nRizzuto was a durable, outstanding shortstop, skilled bunter and enthusiastic baserunner who finished with .273 lifetime batting average.\n\nIn 1950 Rizzuto earned the A.L.
