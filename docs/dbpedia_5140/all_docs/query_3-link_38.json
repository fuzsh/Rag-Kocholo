        "text": "NEW YORK – On Tuesday, the Yankees reached the season’s 50-game mark, with a comeback 10-inning win, 6-5, against the second-place Baltimore Orioles.\n\nDespite some key injuries to the rotation, bullpen and starting lineup, they've done a better job lately of staying afloat in the ultra-competitive AL East, sitting in third place behind the Rays and O's.\n\nAs we head toward Memorial Day weekend, here’s a ranking of the current Yankees players (minimum 65 at-bats and 15 innings pitched):\n\n23. Clarke Schmidt, RHP\n\nRemains in the rotation and hopes to build off his last outing at Cincinnati, but toting a 6.00 ERA in 10 starts.\n\n22. Albert Abreu, RHP\n\nShows positive flashes and possesses swing-and-miss stuff, but 16 walks in 23.1 innings is way too high.\n\n21. Willie Calhoun, OF\n\nLimited to occasional starts versus right-handers but provides competitive at-bats and needed bench depth.\n\n20. Isiah Kiner-Falefa, OF-IF\n\nPoints for adjusting well to outfield play after a brief spring training trial, adding versatility that contributed to Aaron Hicks’ farewell.\n\n19. Oswaldo Cabrera, OF-IF\n\nJust when you think he’s on the verge of being optioned, he does something to remind you of his overall value. But if Oswald Peraza stays hot at Triple-A, Cabrera’s spot could be in jeopardy.\n\n18. Jhony Brito, RHP\n\nOptioned last week to make room for Luis Severino, but credit for patching the rotation in his first big-league experience.\n\n17. Kyle Higashioka, C\n\nBackup catcher is now in something of a platoon role with Ben Rortvedt, with Jose Trevino on the injured list.\n\n16. Clay Holmes, RHP\n\nPatches of inconsistency with his signature sinker have contributed to fewer save opportunities, but still capable of dominant outings.\n\n15. Nestor Cortes, LHP\n\nMaybe that last start at Toronto gets him going, where he finally got through six innings for the first time since April 20.\n\n14. Ron Marinaccio, RHP\n\nSignature change-up hasn’t been as effective as last year when it was deadly. Needs to limit the walks.\n\n13. Domingo German, RHP\n\nProbably the club’s second-best starter lately but did his team no favors with that sticky-stuff suspension.\n\n12. Ian Hamilton, RHP\n\nHad quickly graduated to high-leverage bullpen usage with his “slambio’’ pitch, and now out for a month or more due to a strained groin.\n\n11. Jose Trevino, C\n\nBatting much closer to .200 than .300 this year, but his value to the team and pitching staff goes way beyond stats. Hopeful of a return from the IL (hamstring) by Monday.\n\n10. Jimmy Cordero, RHP\n\nAnother key reason an injury-riddled bullpen has still been a strength, with a 2.14 ERA, 0.86 WHIP and holding opponents to a .176 average.\n\n9. Anthony Volpe, SS\n\nThe overall stats might not be eye-popping now, but his daily growth at a key position and speed/power element with steady defense is evident.\n\n8. Michael King, RHP\n\nLess than a year removed from a fractured right elbow, King has resumed being a bullpen force.\n\n7. DJ LeMahieu\n\nHaving an average year, but a healthy LeMahieu’s value to the lineup is plainly apparent, including solid defense at third base.\n\n6. Wandy Peralta, LHP\n\nThe bullpen’s MVP, adaptable to any role – including as the occasional closer – with a 1.83 ERA and limiting hitters to a .183 average.\n\n5. Gleyber Torres, 2B\n\nOccasional lapses defensively and on the bases, but has greatly improved his plate discipline and is driving the ball with more consistency.\n\n4. Harrison Bader, CF\n\nThe team has won 15 of 20 games since he arrived back from the IL, with difference-making power, speed and defense.\n\n3. Anthony Rizzo, 1B\n\nEarning every dollar of his new contract with a clutch .300 average, more power, and the usual Gold Glove-caliber defense.\n\n2. Gerrit Cole, RHP\n\nApril’s AL Pitcher of the Month is still winless in May, but he's been the unquestioned ace of a club with serious rotation issues through the season’s first quarter.\n\n1. Aaron Judge, OF\n\nIn 13 games since he arrived back from the IL (hip), the team is 10-3 and the current AL Player of the Week is batting .367 with a 1.402 OPS, eight homers and 19 RBI."
