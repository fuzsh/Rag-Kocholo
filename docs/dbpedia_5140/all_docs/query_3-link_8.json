        "text": "The City Connect series started in 2021, the idea was to celebrate deep rooted history, culture, and spirit of all the cities and bring the clubs and their communities together. Some teams are really “out there” like the Red Sox jersey is yellow with blue letters, and the Padres have neon pink and seafoam green and the Rockies basically have a license plate theme on theirs.\n\nThe New York Yankees are all about “sticking to their guns” and being all about tradition. NY has a strict facial hair policy as I wrote on a while ago, and even a newer policy I didn’t know about till this year, and only because it involves a player who just came to the Yanks this year, Alex Verdugo… he’s basically the white Mr. T with the chains around his neck, Verdugo was asked to tone it down to one or maybe two chains and kind of keep them out of site as much as possible.\n\nCity Connect hopes to connect with a new generation. Lets face it some of the uniforms are cool and really nice, and some are hideous.\n\nWhy haven’t the Yankees joined in and grabbed ahold of this idea and ran with it? There’s lots of money to be made by an alternate jersey and a City Connect jersey as well. Is tradition really that important that NY wouldn’t adopt a new jersey? The only time we see the Yankees wear anything other than the classic Pinstripes or “road greys” as they call the road uniforms is during Spring Training and I think those black jerseys are amazing, in my opinion.\n\nYou either love ’em or you hate ’em. There is no in between. But we all understand that the New York Yankees are the most collectable team on the planet, from the NY hat to the jerseys. The Yankees have a very long history the first Yankees jersey was 1903 the New York Highlanders, and this jersey was more of a heavy wool sweater/long sleeve turtleneck with a huge N over the right breast and Y over the left.\n\nDid you know the Yankees changed their jerseys 7 times from 1903 to 1913? Albeit minor details but they did change them 7 times. Then the name actually changed too from Highlanders to Yankees. Long story short here, The Yankees changed jersey styles, companies and slight variance of color about 22 times since 1913 till present day. The jersey companies went from Spalding, Wilson, Rawlings and the newest brand Nike.\n\nTraditions and history are plentiful in the Yankees’ past, but the unwillingness to change is seriously a Steinbrenner concept. Before 1973 the Yankees were not owned by the Steinbrenners and as I discussed changed jerseys several times.\n\nWhy has Hal been so reluctant to try something new? The City Connect thing is cool for 29 other teams, why not the most notorious team?\n\nLastly and this is my opinion/suggestion. I would make the new City Connect jersey be similar to the Spring Training jersey, but instead of New York written across the front I would put “BRONX BOMBERS”, and have a cannonball type bomb with a wick designed like a baseball exploding.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments below, feel free to follow me on ‘X’ @HENDO19750 or message me on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/HENDO.1975\n\nPhoto Credit; Royal Retros, Reddit, Fox News, and Nike\n\n***Are you interested in sports betting?
