        "text": "The Boston Red Sox, one of the oldest and most storied franchises in Major League Baseball history, boast a rich history. Founded in 1901 as one of the American League’s original eight teams, the Red Sox quickly established themselves as formidable contenders in the league.\n\nThe Red Sox achieved their first World Series victory in 1903, just two years after their inception, and went on to win four more championships in 1912, 1915, 1916, and 1918. During this period, the team featured several legendary players who have since been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Notable among them are Tris Speaker, Harry Hooper, and Babe Ruth, who began his career as a pitcher for the Red Sox before becoming a legendary slugger with the New York Yankees.\n\nHowever, the Red Sox experienced a drought in World Series victories that lasted for 86 years, commonly known as “The Curse of the Bambino.” This supposed curse was attributed to the trade of Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1919. It wasn’t until 2004 that the Red Sox finally broke the curse and won their sixth World Series title, an iconic moment in baseball history.\n\nThe Red Sox retired numbers include ten players who are forever legends of Jersey Street. The list includes Ted Williams (#9), Joe Cronin (#4), Bobby Doerr (#1), Carl Yastrzemski (#8), Carlton Fisk (#27), Johnny Pesky (#6), Jim Rice (#14), Pedro Martinez (#45), Wade Boggs (#26), and David Ortiz (#34). These players made significant contributions to the team and etched their names in baseball history.\n\nThe Red Sox also retired one number that holds significance beyond the team’s legacy. Jackie Robinson’s #42 was retired by the entire MLB in 1997 to honor the trailblazing player who broke the league’s color barrier in 1947. Robinson’s legacy symbolizes the fight against racial segregation in baseball and stands as a testament to the power of courage and determination in sports.\n\nFenway Park, the home of the Red Sox, serves as a living testament to the team’s history and legacy. The plaques displayed along the exterior walls and above the right field pay tribute to the great players who have graced the field and left an indelible mark on the franchise. As fans walk into Fenway Park, they are reminded of the team’s glorious past and the unforgettable moments that have shaped the history of the Boston Red Sox.\n\nHERE’S THE FULL LIST OF JERSEY NUMBERS RETIRED BY THE BOSTON RED SOX:"
