        "text": "Click here for an updated version of the list below (as of March 28, 2019).\n\nWhen the Yankees take the field tonight, their uniforms will be emblazoned with two patches honoring the recent deaths of long-time public address announcer Bob Sheppard and principal owner George Steinbrenner. Unlike in the past when the team has used either a black armband or number to honor a fallen team legend, this time around the Yankees have opted to be more descriptive.\n\nThe Sheppard patch, in particular, uses the image of microphone enclosed by a diamond along with an apt inscription to evoke the memory of “the voice of Yankee Stadium”. It will be worn on the left sleeve, following tradition.\n\nThe Steinbrenner patch is ironically more understated, offering only a collage of his name, initials and “The Boss” moniker. It would have been nice to have an image incorporated into the tribute (maybe a turtle neck?), but then again, the Boss always provided his own embellishment anyway. What is unique, however, is the positioning of the patch, which will be worn just above the heart (i.e., the interlocking NY on the home uniform and “York” portion of the road uniform). The Yankees have never worn a memorial patch on the front of their uniform, but if anyone deserves such a distinction, it is the Boss.\n\nSince the tragic death of Indians’ shortstop Ray Chapman, who was beaned in the head by Yankees pitcher Carl Mays, the Yankees have used their uniform as a means of offering tribute to the passing of legendary figures or commemorating tragic events. Below is a list of such honors:"
