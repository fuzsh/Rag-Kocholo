        "text": "Ryan Hatch | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\n\nBest Yankees by jersey #\n\nSome of these, especially the single-digit numbers, you probably can already guess. (Like Mr. No. 2 pictured here, for instance.) But how about all of the teens, or the 20s?\n\nSee here for the best Yankees players to ever wear jersey numbers 1-33, the first of a three-part series we're rolling out this holiday weekend (34-67 on Sunday, 68-99 Monday). Hit the share button above to send to a fellow Yankees fan.\n\n(Photo credit: Greg M. Cooper | USA TODAY Sports)\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 1, Bobby Murcer\n\nThe outfielder played 13 seasons with New York, socking 175 home runs. He was an All-Star every year from 1971-'75.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 2, Derek Jeter\n\nNeed we say more? Jeter won five world championships with the Yankees in his 20 years as New York's shortstop.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 3, Babe Ruth\n\nRuth remains the most famous baseball player to have ever lived. His 714 home runs are third-most in history.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 4, Lou Gehrig\n\nNo other Yankee has ever worn No. 4. The Iron Horse played 17 seasons with the Yankees and hit 493 home runs. Gehrig's name will likely be remembered forever because of his association with the disease that killed himâ€”Lou Gehrig's disease, also known as ALS.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 5, Joe DiMaggio\n\nDiMaggio, owner of a 56-game hitting streak, is a Hall of Famer who won three MVPs. He lost three seasons to World War II.\n\nAP\n\nNo. 6, Joe Gordon\n\nThe Hall of Famer played seven years in New York (1938-1946) and slugged 153 home runs in that span. He was an All-Star six of those seasons.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 7, Mickey Mantle\n\nAmong the top-5 most famous Yankees ever, Mantle slugged 536 home runs in his 18 seasons with New York and won three MVPs.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 8, Yogi Berra/Bill Dickey\n\nBerra won three MVPs and 10 World Championships with the Yankees from 1946 to 1965.\n\nDickey, also a Hall of Fame catcher, was an 11-time All-Star with the Yankees from 1928-'46.\n\nThe number is retired by the Yankees in both Berra's and Dickey's name.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 9, Roger Maris\n\nIn 1961 Maris broke Babe Ruth's single-season home run mark of 60, slugging 61, which stood until 1998 when it was broken by Mark McGwire. Maris played seven years in New York and won two MVPs.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 10, Phil Rizzuto\n\nThe Hall of Fame shortstop won an MVP in his 13 seasons with New York (he won in 1950) and would likely have put up even bigger numbers if he hadn't lost three years due to World War II.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 11, Lefty Gomez\n\nThe lefty (get it?!) pitched 13 seasons in New York and is in the Hall of Fame after posting a 3.34 ERA and winning 189 games.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 12, Wade Boggs\n\nThe Chicken Man made his name in Boston with the Red Sox but put up good enough numbers in four years with the Yankees to earn this spot. His ride around old Yankee Stadium on a horse after the 1996 World Series victory remains one of the most famous moments of that era.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 13, Alex Rodriguez\n\nA-Rod, as you may know him, has 692 career home runs and 2016 is his 12th year in the Bronx. His legacy is complicated and controversial (he was suspended for the entire 2014 season because of a link to steroids), but he remains one of the best players to ever play the game.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 14, Curtis Granderson\n\nShockingly few Yankees have worn No. 14 and shined. Granderson played for the Yanks from 2010-2013 and smacked 115 home runs, finishing fourth in the MVP race in 2011. He's now the right fielder for the Mets.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 15, Red Ruffing\n\nThe Yankees have No. 15 retired in honor of Thurman Munson, but it was Ruffing who put together the more impressive career wearing the jersey. He won 231 games as a Yankee and his ERA was 3.47. He is in the Hall of Fame, having played a total of 22 years.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 16, Whitey Ford\n\nFord won the Cy Young in 1961 and finished his career, all in New York, with 236 wins and a 2.75 ERA.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 17, Mickey Rivers\n\nEnos Slaughter may have worn No. 17 for longer but Rivers was better. Rivers hit 34 home runs in 3.5 years with the Yankees and finished in the MVP voting for three straight seasons from 1976-'78.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 18, Johnny Damon\n\nJersey number 18 doesn't produce a very rich history among Yankees players. Damon, who helped the Yanks win a World Series in 2009, tops the list.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 19, Dave Righetti\n\nRighetti played 11 years in New York and was Rookie of the Year in 1981. He finished his career with 252 saves.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 20, Jorge Posada\n\nYou remember this guy. The Yankees retired Posada's No. 20 last year and the catcher, one-fourth of what's remembered as the \"Core Fore\" (Posada, Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera), won four World Championships with the Yankees.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 21, Paul O'Neill\n\nO'Neill manned right field for the Yankees from 1993-2001, part of four World Series championships. He 185 home runs as a Yankee.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 22, Roger Clemens\n\nClemens won two World Series with the Yankees (2000, 2001) and the AL Cy Young in '01. Clemens isn't exactly remembered fondly throughout baseball for his off-the-field drama tied mostly to steroids, but he's still the best Yankee to ever wear No. 22.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 23, Don Mattingly\n\nMattingly played 14 years in the Bronx, winning the MVP in 1985. Only in 1995, his last season, did the Yankees make the postseason during his tenure at first base.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 24, Robinson Cano\n\nCano played nine seasons in New York before bolting for Seattle after the 2013 season. While in New York Cano hit 204 homers and was a six-time All-Star.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 25, Mark Teixeira\n\nYou could argue No. 25 should go to Tommy John (91-60 in eight seasons), but Teixeria has hit 194 home runs with the Yankees and should eclipse 200 this season as long as this neck issue doesn't seriously plague the year.\n\nTeixeira, of course, was part of the 2009 World Series team, his first year in New York.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 26, Orlando Hernandez\n\nEl Duque won three titles with the Yankees and finished his career with a 2.55 postseason ERA.\n\nDrake Moffat | Twitter\n\nNo. 27, Butch Wynegar\n\nSlim pickings for No. 27, but Wynegar put up some decent numbers from 1982-'86 with the Yanks, driving in 168 runs with a .368 on-base percentage.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 28, Sparky Lyle\n\nFrom 1972-'78 Lyle saved 132 games and posted a stellar 2.50 ERA. A different time with less offense, sure, but still impressive. He won the Cy Young in 1977.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 29, Catfish Hunter\n\nThe Hall of Fame righty made his name in Oakland and won a three World Series there, but he wasn't bad in New York, winning 63 games '75-'79. He won two World Series with the Yankees, giving him five for his career.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 30, Willie Randolph\n\nRandolph was a five-time All-Star with the Yankees in his 13 years here at second base. Randolph never hit more than seven home runs in a season but finished his career with 271 steals.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 31, Dave Winfield\n\nThe Hall of Famer clocked 205 home runs with the Yankees in nine seasons and went to 12 All-Star games in his career.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 32, Elston Howard\n\nNot a lot of 32s from Yanks over the years, but Howard put together a nice career in the Bronx from 1955-1967. He hit 161 home runs as a Yank and won the MVP in 1963.\n\nHoward was the Yankees first-ever black player.\n\nMLB\n\nNo. 33, David Wells\n\nRemember the perfect game? Come to Yankee Stadium and they'll be sure to remind you time, after time."
