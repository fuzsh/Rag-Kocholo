        "text": "Although Alex Rodriguez did help the New York Yankees win the World Series in 2009, the team decided to not retire his No. 13 jersey. Instead, they recently gave this number to outfielder Joey Gallo. A move that upset Alex Rodriguez but he had never talked about it until now. The former third-base star totalled 351 homeruns during his 12-season run with the Yankees. In total, he has a 696 career homeruns, which place him ince a list of only five players to reach those numbers in MLB history. In a different scenario, Alex rodriguez would get hims jersey number retired from every single MLB ball club he represented throughout his career. But the constant off-the-field issues were more than enough for the Yankees to decide against that.\n\nAlex Rodriguez is upset with the Yankees\n\nAlthough he had a truly brilliant career in Major League Baseball, Alex Rodrguez will sadly be remembered mostly for his PED scandal. He was suspended 162 games for taking performance-enhancing substances and that was all the Yankees needed to not retire his jersey number. In a recent interview on the Evan Tiki show at WFAN-AM in New York, Rodriguez was asked about this. Here's what he said about it: \"It did not make me happy. Yeah, of course it bothers me. It's less about bother, but of course it would be nice to be recognized in one of the coolest places to be in Yankee history, but that's not my decision.\"\n\nThe suspension Alex Rodriguez got was back in 2014 but that wasn't the only reason the Yankees decided to not retire his number. As an MLB analyst, Rodriguez has criticized the team in multiple accassions. Also, it was recently known that he ratted out other MLB stars who were also using PEDs in order to shorten his own punishment. Throughout the Yankees history, they have retired a total of 22 jersey numbers and honored 24 players in the process. Alex Rodriguez is not amongst those illustrious names. It remains to be seen if he will ever be part of that prestigious list of names."
