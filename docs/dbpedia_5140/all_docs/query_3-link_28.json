        "text": "No, your TV isn't broken. The Boston Red Sox are wearing yellow and light blue jerseys.\n\nThe jerseys stray from the traditional red and white color scheme for the club.\n\nThe team was one of the first to have City Connect jerseys, which the MLB introduced in 2021.\n\nESPN last year ranked it 7th out of 15 jerseys of the style.\n\nThis year, new City Connect jerseys are being released for nine other teams: the Cleveland Guardians, Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, New York Mets, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Tampa Bay Rays, and the Toronto Blue Jays.\n\nIn 2024, the Red Sox will wear them first on Saturday, April 13, against the Los Angeles Angels. Two days before the Boston Marathon, which inspired the color scheme.\n\nWhy are the Red Sox uniforms yellow and blue?\n\nDuring the 2024 season, the Red Sox will wear the yellow and blue City Connect jerseys for the Saturday home games, manager Alex Cora said in a podcast back in November.\n\nThe jerseys, unveiled in 2021, feature \"Boston\" across the chest in a stencil font in blue letters that pays tribute to the finish of the marathon at Boylston Street.\n\nWhat do each part of the Red Sox City Connect jerseys mean?\n\nThe shirts are in bright yellow and on the left sleeve, there is a patch that mimics a marathon bib with the number \"617,\" the area code for Boston and Fenway Park. The caps feature the iconic \"B\" but are in sky blue.\n\nA tribute to the victims: Red Sox unveil yellow and sky blue uniforms to honor Patriots' Day weekend, Boston Marathon\n\nWhat games will the Red Sox wear their blue and yellow jerseys?\n\nIn years past, Cora said the yellow and blue Red Sox jerseys were worn randomly. If they follow their home Saturday schedule, here are the 14 games when the team will don the uniform:\n\nApril 13, vs. Los Angeles Angels, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nApril 27, vs. Chicago Cubs, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nMay 11, vs. Washington Nationals, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nMay 25, vs. Milwaukee Brewers, 4:10 p.m. start time.\n\nJune 1, vs. Detroit Tigers, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nJune 8, vs. New York Yankees, 7:15 p.m. start time\n\nJune 29, vs. San Diego Padres, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nJuly 13, vs. K.C. Royals, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nJuly 27, vs. New York Yankees, 7:15 p.m. start time\n\nAug. 10, vs. Houston Astros, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nAug. 24, vs Arizona Diamondbacks, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nSept. 7, vs. Chicago White Sox, 7:15 p.m. start time\n\nSept. 21, vs. Minnesota Twins, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nSept. 28, vs. Tampa Bay Rays, 4:10 p.m. start time\n\nWhy are the Boston Red Sox wearing number 42?\n\nMarathon Monday is also Jackie Robinson Day, the 77th anniversary of breaking the color barrier in the league.\n\nMajor League Baseball celebrates Jackie Robinson Day on April 15 each year, commemorating and honoring the day Robinson made his major league debut, breaking the sport’s color barrier. Celebrated at all MLB ballparks on this day each year, all players, coaches, and managers on both teams wear Robinson’s uniform number, 42.\n\nNames and faces: Local celebrities running the 2023 Boston Marathon\n\nWhy is the Red Sox game so early on Patriots’ Day?\n\nOn Patriots’ Day, the Red Sox will play at 11:05 a.m., as per tradition for the day. The start time is close to when the elite men's runners will pass Fenway Park about a mile before the Boylston Street finish line.\n\nThey will be sporting jerseys with “Boston” on the front of the Red Sox home jerseys, just as the team did the first time during the Boston Marathon tribute at Fenway Park on April 20, 2013, five days after the bombing at the finish line.\n\nUSA Today content was used in this story."
