        "text": "Deion Sanders – No. 2 – Cornerback\n\nDeion Sanders’ place in the history of college football was immortalized over a five month period in 2011 when he was inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame in August and the College Football Hall of Fame in December. Sanders redefined the position of cornerback over his historic career winning the 1988 Jim Thorpe Award as a senior at Florida State and landing two-time consensus All-America honors. He left FSU second on the all-time interceptions list, first for career punt return yards and became one of college football’s all-time brightest stars.\n\nPeter Warrick – No. 9 – Wide Receiver\n\nWarrick was a two-time consensus All-American, earning the honor in both 1998 and 1999. His 32 receiving touchdowns are more than any player in FSU history, and he finished his career as the ACC’s all-time receiving yardage leader with 3,517. When he graduated, his receiving yards and 207 catches ranked behind only Ron Sellers on FSU’s respective lists. As a senior, Warrick caught 71 passes for 934 yards and eight touchdowns for an average of 13.2 yards per reception and also ran for 96 yards on 16 carries and three touchdowns. Warrick also was a dangerous punt return man who averaged 12.6 yards on 18 returns and scored one touchdown. He further showcased his versatility by lining up at quarterback, running for two scores and throwing a touchdown in that role. Warrick carried a school-record streak of 40 straight games with at least one catch into the Sugar Bowl to cap the 1999 season, then set a bowl record by scoring three touchdowns and adding a two-point conversion to help Florida State claim its second national championship. Following his career as a Seminole, he was selected fourth overall in the first round of the NFL Draft by the Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nDerrick Brooks – No. 10 – Linebacker\n\nBrooks was a two-time consensus All-American at outside linebacker for the Seminoles where his blend of speed and athleticism set a new standard for the position. He starred at FSU from 1991-94 leading FSU to its first national title as a junior and earning first team All-ACC honors as a sophomore, junior and senior. He was named the ACC Player of the Year in 1994 and was a finalist for the Butkus, Lombardi and Football Writer’s Defensive Player of the Year Award in both 1993 and 1994. Brooks was just as highly regarded off the field earning first team Academic All-America honors in 1994 and winning an NCAA Postgraduate Scholarship. In addition, he was committed to public service causes throughout his Seminole career. Brooks carried his excellence both on the field and as a citizen into his Hall of Fame career as the NFL’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ all-time leading tackler. He was voted to 10 consecutive Pro Bowls (11 total) and at the time of his retirement had made an NFL-leading 200 consecutive starts. He led his beloved Tampa Bay team to the Super Bowl title in 2002. As a professional, Brooks was the recipient of several prestigious awards, including the 2000 Walter Payton/NFL Man of the Year award, the 2003 Bart Starr Award, the 2004 Bryon “Whizzer” White Award, and the 2008 JB Award for community service through the NFL Players Association, all of which recognize an NFL player annually for their commitment to the communities in which they live.\n\nChris Weinke – No. 16 – Quarterback\n\nChris Weinke literally rewrote the Florida State record book over his career as the Seminoles’ quarterback. He set 26 school records, including both the FSU and Atlantic Coast Conference records for career passing yards with 9,839. He led the Seminoles to an undefeated season and the national championship as a junior in 1999. He became FSU’s second Heisman Trophy winner as a senior in 2000, while leading the nation in passing with 4,167 yards and averaging 347.3 yards per game. Weinke compiled a remarkable 32-3 record as the starting quarterback at FSU, which ranked as the seventh best winning percentage in NCAA history. His 79 career touchdown passes ranked as the 12th best performance in NCAA history and his career passing yards placed him at 18th on the NCAA’s all-time list. Weinke owned the first, second and fourth best passing games in FSU history headlined by a school record 536 passing yards against Duke in 2000. His accomplishments were even more impressive considering he suffered a potentially career-ending neck injury as a sophomore. Weinke’s place among Florida State’s all-time greatest players was recognized when his jersey was retired in 2001, at the time making it one of only seven retired numbers/jerseys in school history. His place among the ACC’s all-time best was recognized when he was voted one of the 50 best players in the history of the conference.\n\nCharlie Ward – No. 17 – Quarterback\n\nFlorida State’s Charlie Ward began his senior season in 1993 chasing both the school’s first national championship and the Heisman Trophy. Ward’s passing and running skills were already well known qualities by 1993, but his inspired leadership and poise under pressure during his senior year elevated him to one of the game’s all-time greats. So exceptional was Ward’s command of the offense that coaches moved him into the shotgun to allow him to make adjustments during the play. Ward set 19 school and seven Atlantic Coast Conference records over his two years as the starting quarterback for the Seminoles. A consensus All-American, Ward won over 30 individual awards in addition to the Heisman. Ward ranks second in career total offense at FSU with 6,636 yards and has the highest completion rate for a career (62.3%) and lowest interception percentage (2.90%). Ward set the FSU record for touchdown passes in a season with 27 in 1993. Thousands of fans poured into Doak Campbell Stadium for a celebration of the national championship and Ward’s Heisman, which included the surprise retirement of his number. He joined Fred Biletnikoff and Ron Sellers becoming only the third player in FSU history to be so honored.\n\nFred Biletnikoff – No. 25 – Wide Receiver\n\nBiletnikoff played wide receiver at Florida State from 1962-64 under Head Coach Bill Peterson. He was FSU’s first consensus All-American. As a senior, he ranked fourth in the nation with 57 receptions for 11 touchdowns, not including four touchdown catches in the Gator Bowl. Following his collegiate success, Biletnikoff went on to star for the Oakland Raiders of the National Football League for 14 years. During that time, he played in four Pro Bowls and was the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl XI.\n\nTerrell Buckley – No. 27 – Cornerback\n\nFlorida State retired the jersey of former Seminole and NFL star cornerback Terrell Buckley at halftime of the ULM game on Sept. 3, 2011. Buckley owns most of FSU’s interception records following his outstanding three-year career from 1989-91 including the single season mark with 12 interceptions as a junior. He became FSU’s second Jim Thorpe Trophy winner following the 1991 season and finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy balloting. He totaled 21 career interceptions as a Seminole. Buckley was also one of FSU’s all-time great punt returners and he scored seven career touchdowns, four on interceptions and three on punts. He also played two years for the FSU baseball team and ran track for the Seminoles. Buckley was the fifth player taken overall in the 1992 NFL Draft by the Green Bay Packers. He went on to an outstanding 15-year NFL career in which he totaled 50 career interceptions.\n\nWarrick Dunn – No. 28 – Running Back\n\nWarrick Dunn’s four-year career at Florida State established him as one of the most popular players in all of college football and the finest running back in school history. Dunn is the only Seminole ever to rush for over 1,000 yards in three consecutive seasons. His 3,959 career rushing yards broke Greg Allen’s school record set in 1984. He also broke Allen’s single season rushing record when he ran for 1,242 yards as a junior in 1995. Dunn has the record for most touchdowns scored in a career with 49 over four seasons and rushed for over 100 yards more times (21) than any player at FSU. He was a three-time All-ACC selection as well as a member of the ACC All-Academic Team. He was selected to the First Team Football Writer’s All-America squad as a senior and earned Second Team Associated Press honors that same year.\n\nRon Sellers – No. 34 – Wide Receiver\n\nSellers remains the most prolific receiver in FSU history. He held most of the NCAA receiving records from the end of his senior season in 1968 until 1987. A flanker for Florida State from 1966 to 1968, he accumulated 3,979 yards on 240 receptions. Sellers’ career was marked by consistency, quality and quantity. He caught passes in 30 consecutive games, averaging 119.9 yards per game. Sellers also led Florida State to three bowl games during his playing days.\n\nRon Simmons – No. 50 – Noseguard\n\nThe greatest defender in Florida State history, Ron Simmons’ No. 50 was retired in 1988. Simmons anchored the center of the defense that took FSU to a pair of Orange Bowl appearances in 1979 and 1980, resulting in FSU’s highest national rankings ever at that time. A dominating nose guard and the Tribe’s first two-time consensus All-American, Simmons seemed to camp out in opponents’ backfields. He totaled an FSU record 25 quarterback sacks and 44 tackles for loss — a mark that held top ranking at FSU for 23 years. He was the first Seminole defender to have his number retired.\n\nMarvin Jones – No. 55 – Linebacker\n\nJones won both the Butkus and Lombardi Awards as a junior in 1992 and finished fourth in the balloting for the 1992 Heisman Trophy. He recorded 369 tackles over three seasons with the Seminoles, a mark that sits eighth all-time in the FSU record books. Jones played a vital role in leading Florida State to three top four finishes including a ranking of fourth in the Associated Press poll in 1990 and 1991, and second in 1992 with an 11-1 record and a 27-14 win over Nebraska in the Orange Bowl. He was inducted into FSU’s Sports Hall of Fame in 2000. A graduate of Northwestern High in Miami, Jones left FSU following his junior season and was selected with the fourth overall pick of the 1993 NFL Draft by the New York Jets. He played his entire 10-year professional career with the Jets and finished with 1,022 tackles over 142 games.\n\nBob Sura – No. 3 – Guard\n\nBob Sura tallied 2,130 points during his four seasons at FSU to become the program’s all-time leading scorer. After being named ACC Rookie of the Year as a freshman, he went on to become the first player in Florida State history to be named First Team All-ACC. He was selected with the 17th overall pick in the 1995 NBA Draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nSam Cassell – No. 10 – Guard\n\nPerhaps one of the greatest junior college transfers in Seminole history, Sam Cassell added an offensive and defensive threat to the Seminole arsenal. With a season-record 97 steals in his ‘92-93 campaign, Cassell also dished out 170 assists that same season along with an average of 18.3 points per game. He thrived on pressure situations and routinely came through in the clutch. Cassell was drafted by the Houston Rockets in the first round of the 1993 NBA Draft. During his first two seasons in the NBA he was an integral part of the Rockets’ World Championship teams. He currently is an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\nDave Cowens – No. 13 – Center\n\nHonored as one of the 50 greatest players in NBA history, Dave Cowens is arguably the single greatest player in Florida State history. While at FSU, he averaged 18.9 points and 17.2 rebounds per game while shooting 52 percent from the field. Cowens also owns most Seminole rebounding records including rebounds in a season (456) and career rebounds (1,340). His talent caught the eye of the Boston Celtics who selected him fourth overall in the 1970 NBA Draft. During his rookie season with the Celtics, he averaged 17 points and 15 rebounds per game and won NBA Rookie of the Year honors. In 1973, he took home both the All-Star MVP and League MVP trophies. Cowens’ intensity and desire earned him seven all-star appearances and two championship rings with the Celtics in 1974 and 1976 and in 1991 an induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame.\n\nHugh Durham – No. 25 – Guard\n\nAfter leading the Seminoles as a player in the ’50s, Hugh Durham returned to lead the Seminoles as their head coach in the ’60s and ’70s. As a player, Durham ranks third in points scored in a single game (43) and also scored more than 500 points in two seasons. Perhaps most notable was Durham’s coaching career at FSU when he led the Seminoles to three NCAA Tournament appearances including a national championship game appearance in 1972. His career winning percentage as the Seminoles head coach was .708 which still ranks among the best in the nation.\n\nRon King – No. 33 – Forward\n\nRon King owns FSU’s single-game scoring record with a 46-point outing against Georgia Southern in 1971. He was an All-American in 1972 and the NCAA Mideast Regional MVP in leading the Seminoles to the Final Four. He was selected by the Golden State Warriors of the NBA in 1973.\n\nDave Fedor – No. 43 – Forward\n\nA left-hander known for his ability to do almost anything on the court with either hand, Dave Fedor led the Seminoles as co-captain in both his junior and senior seasons. Fedor’s hard work and consistency were evidenced by his streak of 49 consecutive games scoring in double figures. He became the first FSU player ever picked in the NBA Draft when he was selected by Philadelphia in 1962. His jersey was honored at Florida State in 2012.\n\nDick Howser – No. 34 – Shortstop/Head Coach\n\nThe first All-American in Florida State history, Dick Howser led FSU into District III Playoffs each season from 1956-58, to the District Championships in 1957 and ’58 and earned All-American recognition from the American Baseball Coaches Association both of those years. In 1956, Howser’s .422 batting average set an FSU season mark. Upon graduation, Howser played professional baseball for the Kansas City Athletics, the Cleveland Indians and the New York Yankees. The highlight of his playing career was being named the American League Rookie of the Year in 1961 while with the Athletics. After playing in the majors until 1968, Howser then made the transition to coaching and later to management. Howser served as a coach for the Yankees before accepting the head coach’s position at his alma mater, Florida State, in 1979. Under Howser, the Seminoles completed a season record of 43-17-1 as well as a trip to the NCAA regional tournament. Returning to the Major Leagues after one season at FSU, Howser garnered an overall coaching record of 507-425 with the Yankees and Kansas City Royals, including winning the 1985 World Series with the Royals. Howser passed away in 1987 after a battle with cancer, and the baseball stadium at FSU was dedicated in his honor in March 1988 in an exhibition game between Howser’s two former teams, FSU and Kansas City.\n\nJ.D. Drew – No. 39 – Outfielder\n\nJ.D. Drew became the first player in college baseball to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in a season, finishing with 31 and 32, respectively, in 1997. He hit .455 on the season and pulled off the triple-triple with 106 hits, 110 runs scored and 100 RBI in being named the national player of the year by Baseball America, Collegiate Baseball, and Sporting News. Drew also earned the Golden Spikes and Dick Howser Awards as the nation’s best player. Drew was a two-time consensus All-America selection as a sophomore and junior in 1996 and 1997. The Hahira, Ga., native totaled 69 home runs and hit .391 over his three-year Seminole career. In 2011, he was named to the College World Series Legends Team after leading FSU to Omaha in 1995 and 1996. Drew was the second overall pick in the 1997 MLB Draft by the Philadelphia Phillies and the fifth overall pick in the 1998 MLB Draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. Drew enjoyed a 14-year Major League career with the Cardinals, Braves, and Dodgers, and was a member of the 2007 World Series Champion Boston Red Sox. Drew was elected to the Florida State Hall of Fame in 2003 and enshrined in the National College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nMike Martin – No. 11 – Outfielder/Head Coach\n\nMike Martin was a two-year centerfielder for Florida State in 1965 and 1966 and a five-year assistant coach in the late 1970s before being named the Seminole baseball head coach prior to the 1980 season. Martin would go on to record the most wins in college baseball history, with 2,029, including 17 trips to the College World Series. The Seminoles won at least 40 games and reached the NCAA Tournament in all 40 of Martin's seasons as head coach, and he was inducted into the Florida State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2018; his home-state North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame in 2018; the American Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2007; and the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 2005. He won 19 conference championships, coached 19 first-round draft picks, was a seven-time ACC Coach of the Year and two-time national coach of the year. He was the keynote speaker at the 2017 FSU Graduation ceremony and was one of FSU's 100 distingushed graduates in celebration of the FSU Alumni Association centennial.\n\nBuster Posey - No. 8 - Catcher/Shortstop/Pitcher\n\nBuster Posey was a two-time first team All-America catcher for the Seminoles in 2007 and 2008 and won virtually every award in baseball including the Golden Spikes Award, Dick Howser Trophy, Brooks Wallace, Johnny Bench and Player of the Year honors by Baseball America, Collegiate Baseball and Rivals.com in his junior season. Posey also earned All-America honors as a freshman in 2006 at shortstop for the Seminoles before moving behind the plate. Posey’s records from his consensus All-America junior season included leading the nation in six offensive categories including batting average (.463), hits (119), RBI (93), total bases (226), on-base percentage (.566) and slugging percentage (.879). His batting average was the highest recorded in a single season in Seminole baseball history. He led FSU to the College World Series in 2008, and led the ACC in eight categories en route to being named 2008 Player of the Year and became just the fourth player in ACC history to capture the triple crown as he led the league in batting average, home runs (26) and RBI. After being drafted fifth overall in the 2008 MLB Draft, Posey led the San Francisco Giants to three World Series titles and was the 2010 Rookie of the Year, the 2012 National League MVP and a two-time Comeback Player of the Year recipient.\n\nBrooke Wyckoff – No. 21 – Forward/Assistant Coach\n\nBrooke Wyckoff was a star forward for head coach Sue Semrau’s first hoops teams from 1997-2001. Wyckoff spent nine years in the WNBA, playing for the Orlando Miracle, Connecticut Sun and the Chicago Sky. Wyckoff was one of the top high school players in the country but chose to leave West Chester, Ohio, to play for Semrau and Florida State. She made an immediate impact setting an FSU record with 80 blocked shots as a freshman in 1997. She went on to earn All-ACC honors as a sophomore and junior and capped her senior season (2001) with first team All-ACC honors as well as All-America honors. She was also FSU’s only four-time Academic All-ACC performer and received an ACC postgraduate scholarship. Wyckoff scored 1,350 points over her storied FSU career and finished as the second-best shot blocker the Seminoles have ever produced with 209. She grabbed 804 career rebounds to also rank among FSU’s all-time Top 10.\n\nWanda Burns – No. 22 – Guard\n\nOne of Marynell Meadors’ first recruits, Wanda Burns was a highly-touted 5-foot-8 guard out of Macon, Georgia. Burns averaged 11 points a game and led the team with 92 assists as a sophomore, helping FSU to its first winning season since 1983. She electrified the team in 1989-90 and sparked FSU to a 21-9 record and to the NCAA Tournament. Burns set an FSU record for free throw percentage and led the team in scoring, three pointers and steals. In 1990-91, her final season, Burns was named Metro Conference Player of the Week, set a single game record with 10 steals in a game and led the team in three-point shooting. FSU enjoyed one of its most successful seasons with a record of 25-7. Burns led the Metro Conference in scoring at 18.5 points per game and scored double figures in 38 consecutive games. She was named Metro Conference Tournament MVP and Player of the Year and also earned Hanes Her Way NCAA Woman of the Year and Second Team All-American honors. Burns still ranks among FSU’s top 10 in two career and seven single-season statistical categories.\n\nTia Paschal – No. 30 – Forward\n\nA forward from Thomson, Ga., Tia Paschal was an immediate contributor for Florida State and was a three-year starter after averaging 20 minutes of play as a rookie. She ended her career averaging 19.4 points and 7.4 rebounds as a senior while earning first team All-ACC honors and second team All-America honors by the American Women’s Sports Federation. During her career, she helped lead the Seminoles to two consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances in 1989-90 and 1990-91 as well as a Metro Conference championship in the 1990-91 season. Paschal is among FSU’s top 10 in five season and six career records and ranks third all-time in scoring with 1,662 points. Honors came in abundance for Paschal throughout her career. After redshirting the 1988-89 season with a knee injury, Paschal took the conference by storm as a freshman, earning Metro Conference All-Rookie Team honors. She earned Metro All-Tournament Team honors two seasons and was twice named the conference Player of the Week.\n\nSue Galkantas – No. 43 – Forward\n\nSue Galkantas is the most prolific scorer in Seminole basketball history, totaling 2,323 points from 1981-84. That total is the most points ever scored by a player, male or female, in Florida State history. By the time Galkantas graduated in 1984, her name was listed in nearly every statistical category in the FSU records book. Averaging 19.4 points per game in her career — a mark that still ranks number one on the career lists — was just a glimpse of the impact that she had as a Seminole. In her rookie year, she broke the FSU freshman scoring record and was named a freshman All-American in numerous publications. By her sophomore year, Galkantas had already scored her 1,000th point and established herself as one of the top 20 scorers in the nation. In her junior season, she led FSU to a 24-6 record and to its first trip to the NCAA Tournament. Overall, she scored in double figures in 115 of 120 games and still holds six career and single-season records. After earning All-Metro Conference honors in 1981, 1983, and 1984, in 1989, Galkantas became the first female FSU athlete to have her number retired."
