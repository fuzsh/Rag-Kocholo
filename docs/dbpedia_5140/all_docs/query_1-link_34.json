        "text": "It's a mystery as to why Graig Nettles doesn't have a plaque in Monument Park.\n\nThe Bills and Sabres each have new GMs, but it's tough to predict how they'll do.\n\nForty years ago, eccentric Atlanta Braves owner went down to the dugout and managed his team.\n\nDerek Jeter will return to Yankee Stadium Sunday night to have his plaque in Monument Park unveiled, and, more significantly, to have his No. 2 retired.\n\nWhen the ceremony is complete, the key members of the last Yankee dynasty – Jeter, Andy Pettitte, Mariano Rivera, Paul O’Neill, Tino Martinez, Jorge Posada, and Bernie Williams – will all have been honored with at least a plaque, while all but O’Neill and Martinez will have had their numbers taken out of circulation.\n\nBut once that iconic No. 2 – which had been the last single-digit ever worn by a Yankee – is retired, it might be quite a while before the Yankees get to do this again.\n\nThere are some Monument Park plaque-worthy candidates who could be feted in the years to come. My list for consideration would include pitchers Roger Clemens, Mike Mussina, and CC Sabathia, outfielder Hideki Matsui, first basemen Mark Teixeira and Jason Giambi, and second baseman Robinson Cano.\n\nOf the pitchers Mussina might have the best credentials. He played eight years in the Bronx and put up a record of 123-72, an ERA of 3.88, a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.02, and a WHIP (walks/hits per innings pitched) of 1.212 across 248 starts. He was 5-7 for the Yankees in the postseason with a 3.80 ERA.\n\nSabathia is the only man still active with the Yankees. Now in his ninth season, he’s 108-70 with a 3.80 ERA, a 3.00 strikeout-to-walk ratio, and a 1.264 WHIP in 235 starts through his start Wednesday. In the postseason, he’s 7-2 with a 3.49 ERA.\n\nClemens does not match up to either statistically as a Yankee. He was in New York for six seasons and went 83-42 with a 4.01 ERA, a 1.307 WHIP, and a 2.55 strikeout-to-walk ratio across 174 starts. However, Clemens was a part of four AL pennant-winning teams and two world champions, posting a record of 7-4 and a 3.24 ERA.\n\nOf the position players, Cano has the strongest resume. In nine years he had a Yankee slash line of .309 BA/.355 OBP/.504 slug, with 204 homers and 822 RBI, he made five All-Star teams, and won two gold gloves.\n\nMatsui played seven years in New York and his slash line was .292/.370/.482 with 140 homers and 597 RBI. Giambi was also a seven-year Yankee who slashed .260/.404/.521 with 209 homers and 604 RBI. And Teixeira was an eight-year player who declined, mostly due to injury, after his first three pinstripe seasons. He finished .248/.343/.479 with 206 homers, 622 RBI and three gold gloves.\n\nAnd then there’s the case of Alex Rodriquez who, based on numbers alone, would warrant a jersey retirement, a plaque, and a bust in Cooperstown. In 13 years in the Bronx, A-Rod slashed .283/.378/.523 with 351 homers, 1,096 RBI, won two MVP awards, played in seven All-Star games, and was the key cog in the 2009 World Series championship season. Sadly for him, he may never get any of those honors thanks to his history with performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nSo, of all these players, is any worthy of becoming the 23rd man to have his Yankee jersey retired? I’d say no, which means once No. 2 goes up on the wall, there may not be another jersey put away for perhaps a couple decades.\n\nIf it were up to me …\n\nThe Yankees would right a wrong and reward Graig Nettles with a plaque in Monument Park. This omission has always been a little puzzling when you take a look at Nettles’ Yankee career.\n\nHe played 11 years in New York (1973-83), so he’s longer tenured than any of the players I mentioned above except A-Rod. His slash line wasn’t great at .248/.329/.461, but he hit 250 homers, drove in 834 runs, was a five-time All-Star, a two-time gold glover, and helped the Yankees win four pennants and two World Series.\n\nOf the men of that era, Reggie Jackson, Thurman Munson, Ron Guidry, and Billy Martin have plaques and numbers retired, while Willie Randolph and Goose Gossage have plaques. Nettles deserves a place in that hallowed ground.\n\nTaking my shots\n\n► I have no tangible thoughts on the Sabres’ hiring Jason Botterill as their new general manager, just as I really had no penetrating thoughts on the Bills’ hiring of Brandon Beane. These guys wear suits, and they do almost all of their work behind the scenes in their respective sports. They don’t have won-loss records like coaches, they don’t accrue statistics like players, so gauging their performance is much more difficult.\n\nAdd the fact that this will be the first time in the big office for both of them, so we don’t really have meaningful data that would shed light on how they will perform in Buffalo, at least not until they start calling own shots. For now, I’ll reserve judgement, just as I’m doing with new Bills coach Sean McDermott. All I can truly say with conviction is this: I like that both organizations will have the coach and GM on the same track, starting at the same time, joined at the hip, pulling the rope in the same direction. That has to be a good thing, right?\n\n► Count me among the disappointed that the Edmonton Oilers got knocked out of the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Anaheim Ducks. Because Connor McDavid plays on the prairie in Edmonton, we rarely get the chance to watch the young superstar on television during the regular season, though I think that might change next year now that the Oilers have made the playoffs after a decade away. The Oilers are a young, exciting team with a home crowd that is one of the most energetic in the league. It’s too bad we won’t get to watch Edmonton play Nashville – another exciting team with a great fan base – in the Western Conference finals.\n\n► There’s clearly no such thing as parity in the NBA. I’m not a big NBA guy so I’m not watching, but I do see the nightly results and some of the highlights, and it’s obvious to me that the Finals will match, for the third year in a row, Golden State against Cleveland. And that’s fine. What else would NBA fans rather see than LeBron James against the Warriors’ triumvirate of Steph Curry, Kevin Durant, and Tray Thompson? Until then, persevere, NBA fans. I had to laugh when I heard that Charles Barkley was moved to say the other night that he’d rather be watching the NHL playoffs because the games and competition have been so much better. No argument from me on that, Sir Charles.\n\nThis week in baseball\n\nForty years ago this week, former Atlanta Braves owner Ted Turner went a little too far in wielding his executive power. Frustrated by the Braves’ 16-game losing streak, Turner traded in his suit and tie for a uniform, went down to the dugout, and managed the team during a 2-1 loss to the Pirates. Turner, then 38 years old and two years away from founding CNN, admitted he let coaches Vern Benson and Chris Cannizzaro make the strategy decisions, though he added, “I could have made some if I wanted. Maybe I will sometime.”\n\nWell, no he wouldn’t. National League President Chub Feeney prohibited Turner from managing the team, and baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn backed Feeney, thus ending a move that baseball fans of the day might have expected Yankees owner George Steinbrenner to pull.\n\nThe numbers game\n\nCourtesy of Elias Sports Bureau\n\n► The St. Louis Cardinals have been playing since 1892, but this week, they achieved a first in franchise history. They went 6-0 on a road trip to Atlanta and Miami, the first time they have ever gone undefeated on a roadie of at least six games.\n\n► Tuesday night, six teams scored four or more first-inning runs in their games. It was only the third day in major-league history that six different teams scored at least four runs in the opening inning, and the only other times it happened both occurred in 1890.\n\n► Wednesday night, the Nationals trailed the Orioles by five runs entering the eighth inning, but rallied to win. Washington hadn’t won a game in which it was down by four or more runs in the eighth inning or later since July 29, 2012 at Milwaukee. Baltimore’s last such loss was even further back, against the Red Sox on July 1, 2009.\n\nMAIORANA@Gannett.com"
