        "text": "Randy Miller | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com\n\nBest Yankees by uniform number\n\nHere's our second installment of picking the greatest Yankees by uniform number. Here we give you No. 34-67, and some were a piece of cake to pick, such as Mariano Rivera (pictured) at No. 42. Others weren't easy. Go throughout our slideshow to see who did what wearing what. And be sure to check out the video for our No. 37. It gets quite funny!\n\n(Hit the share button above to send this to another Yankees fan)\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 34, A.J. Burnett\n\nBurnett gets the nod over 47 other Yankees who have worn No. 34. The right-hander had just a 34-35 record with them from 2009-11, but he came up big in the Yankees' last championship season, winning 13 games plus Game 2 of the 2009 World Series. Other Yankees who have had No. 34: SS Tony Kubek (1957), 3B Clete Boyer (1959-61), RHP Pascual Perez (1990-91), RHP Doug Drabek (1986) and C Brian McCann (2014-16).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 35, Mike Mussina\n\nMussina was 123-72 with a 3.88 ERA pitching for the Yankees from 2001-08, ending his career with a 20-win season in '08. Two Hall of Famers briefly wore No. 37 as Yankees, C Yogi Berra from 1946-47 and RHP Phil Niekro from 1984-85. Others who have had it include LHP Don Gullett (1977-78), RHP John Wetteland (1995-96), RHP Hideki Irabu (1997) and RHP Michael Pineda (2014-16).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 36, David Cone\n\nCone had a 64-40 record with a 3.46 ERA, plus six postseason wins, four championships and a perfect game wearing No. 36 as a Yankee from 1995-2000. Other Yankees who have had 36 niclude Hall of Fame 1B Johnny Mize (1949-53), RHP Pat Dobson (1973-75), LHP Jim Kaat (1979-80), Hall of Fame RHP Gaylord Perry, 1B Nick Johnson (2002-03) and Carlos Beltran (2014-16).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 37, Casey Stengel\n\nThe Old Perfessor managed the Yankees to a record seven World Series championships and 10 pennants from 1949-60. The Yankee retired No. 37 in Stengel’s honor in 1970. Only two players have worn No. 37 as Yankees, both in 1946 … LHP Herb Karpel (2 games) and C Gus Niarhos (37 games).\n\nMitsu Yasukawa | The Star-Ledger\n\nNo. 38, Johnny Blanchard\n\nYogi Berra is the greatest Yankee to wear No. 38 because he had it when debuting in September 1946, but that was just 22 ABs. A catcher and outfielder, Blanchard had the number as a Yankee for eight seasons (1955, 1959-65) and hit .345 in five World Series (10 for 31, 2 HR). Other Yankees who donned 38 include LHP Steve Kline (1970-74), LHP Ken Brett (1976), OF Carlos May (1976-77), RHP Eddie Whitson (1985-86), C-OF Matt Nokes (1990-94), OF Ricky Ledee (1998), RHP Ramiro Mendoza (2005) and RHP Ian Kennedy (2009).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 39, Darryl Strawberry\n\nStrawberry is Mets great, but won three World Series providing power as a platoon DH for the Yankees from 1995-99. He wore No. 26 his first season, then switched to 39. Also wearing 39 as Yankees: LHP Steve Hamilton (1963-70), LHP Larry Gura (1974-75), RHP Joe Niekro (1986-87), OF Roberto Kelly (1987-92), OF Melky Cabrera (2005) and RHP Kerry Wood (2010).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 40, Chien-Ming Wang\n\nThe righty from Taiwan was one of baseball's best starters until injuries derailed his career. He was 55-26 pitching for the Yankees from 2005-09, winning 19 games in each of his first two full seasons. Other notable Yanks who had No. 40: OF Jackie Jenson (1950-51), RHP Ewell Blackwell (1952-53), RHP Lindy McDaniel (1968-73), C Fran Healy (1976-78), RHP Andy Hawkins (1989-91), RHP Bartolo Colon (2011) and RHP Luis Severino (2015-16).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 41, Randy Johnson\n\nThe Hall of Fame left-hander won 17 games in each of his two seasons as a Yankees, 2005 and 2006. The Big Unit wore No. 51 earlier when he was starring in Seattle and Arizona, but it was taken on the Yankees by Bernie Williams. Other Yanks who have had 41 include 1B-RF Joe Collins (1949-52), C Jake Gibbs (1962-71), 1B-C Cliff Johnson (1977-79) and C Jorge Posada (1996).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 42, Mariano Rivera\n\nNo. 42 is an iconic number in baseball because of Jackie Robinson and Rivera, the greatest closer ever. Mo saved a record 651 games wearing No. 42 for the Yanks from 1995-2013. The last to have 42 before Rivera were RHP Domingo Jean and RHP John Habyan, both in 1993. Earlier, 2B Jerry Coleman had 42 from 1949-57 and was an All-Star in '50.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 43, Jeff Nelson\n\nNelson was a tremendous right-handed bullpen arm who won four World Series and five pennants wearing No. 43 as a Yankee from 1996-2000 and 2003. Nelson's 331 games pitched as a Yankee are 16th in franchise history. Thirty-eight others have worn No. 43 as Yankees, including OF Raul Mondesi (2002-03), Tim Stoddard (1986-88), Rudy May (1974-76) and Jim Ray Hart (1973-74).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 44, Reggie Jackson\n\nReggie was an All-Star in his five Yankee seasons, won two World Series, became Mr. October and had a candy bar named after him when he was wearing No. 44 from 1977-81. The Yankees retired No. 44 in the Hall of Fame slugger’s honor in 1993. Six Yankees wore No. 43 before Reggie, including 1B Bill Sudakis (1974, .232, 7 HR).\n\nTwitter\n\nNo. 45, Stan Bahnsen\n\nThe two-generations-ago right-hander had a 17-win rookie season and two 14-win campaigns wearing 45 from 1968-71 and beats out outfielder Chili Davis, an outfielder-DH on the Yankees' 1998 and 1999 World Series title teams.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 46, Andy Pettitte\n\nPicking Pettitte, who is third on the Yankees' career wins list with 219, was a no-brainer, but Don Mattingly wore No. 46 during his first three years and in 1984, his first full season in the bigs, he hit .343 win the AL batting title. Besides Pettitte (1995-2010, 2012-13) and Mattingly, the other Yankees to wear No. 47 for more than one season were C Rick Dempsey (1973-76), OF Gene Locklear (1976-77) and OF Henry Cotto (1985-97).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 47, Luis Arroyo\n\nThe Yankees first Puerto Rican player was a 5-foot-8 left-hander who had one of the best seasons ever by a Yankees reliever in 1961, going 15-5 with a 2.19 ERA and an AL-best 29 saves in 65 relief appearances. Arroyo, who pitched for the Yankees from 1960-64, edged out pitcher Tom Sturdivant (1955-59), the first of 42 Yankees to wear No. 47. Other notable Yankees who had 47 include Andy Messersmith (1978), Jim Kaat (1979), Lee Smith (1993), Jesse Orosco (2003) and Ivan Nova (2010-16).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 48, Andrew Miller\n\nThe 6-foot-7 lefty reliever has been sensational the last two seasons with the Yankees and beats out a field that includes some good names who had more success either for the Bombers wearing another number or with other clubs, the likes of Roy White (1965-68), Mike Torrez (1977), Dave Kingman (1977), Rick Reuschel (1981) and Neil Allen (1987).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 49, Ron Guidry\n\nLouisiana Lightning is fifth on the franchise's all-time wins list and won 20 three times in his 14-year career, all of it with the Yankees from 1975-88. The Yankees retired No. 49 in Guidry's honor in 2003, but the last to have it was pitcher Jeff Johnson in 1992.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 50, Jay Howell\n\nA couple big names in Yankees history briefly wore No. 50, the likes of Ralph Houk (1947) and Chris Chambliss (1988), but Howell gets the nod due to his 1984 season as a Yankees reliever. He was bad in 25 games mostly as a starter the two previous seasons, but was 9-4 with a 2.69 ERA in 61 games in ’84, all but one as a reliever.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 51, Bernie Williams\n\nBernie was the 12th and last player to wear 51 as a Yankee, as it was retired following his distinguished career from 1991-96. The former switch-hitting center fielder was a five-time All-Star who was a main cog on four Yankee championship teams. Other Yankees who were 51 include pitchers Pete Mikkelsen (1964-65) and Cecilio Guante (1987-88).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 52, CC Sabathia\n\nThe big lefty who has been with the Yankees since 2009 won 59 games his first three seasons in New York, including 21 in 2010. Other notables who wore 52 as Yankees include Doyle Alexander (1976-83), David Weathers (1996-97) and Jose Contreras (2003-04).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 53, Johnny Kucks\n\nThe Hoboken-born righty who went to high school in Jersey City pitched for the Yankees from 1955-59. His only great year as a big leaguer was 1956, when he was 18-9 and an All-Star in the regular season and then pitched a three-hit shutout to beat Brooklyn in Game 7 of the 1956 World Series at Ebbets Field.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 54, Goose Gossage\n\nThe Hall of Fame closer was a great Yankee pitching to a 2.14 ERA and saving 151 games from 1978-83. Others who wore 54 include Ron Guidry (10 games in 1975) and 2016 closer Aroldis Chapman.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 55, Hideki Matsui\n\nGodzilla was a superstar slugger in Japan before his Major League days, then was a good Yankee from 2003-03 who went out a legend by winning the 2009 World Series MVP. Others who wore 55 include Jorge Posada, who had it for eight games in 1996.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 56, Jim Bouton\n\nBest known for authoring best seller \"Ball Four,\" Bouton had two big seasons wearing No. 56 as a Yankees pitcher from 1962-68. The former right-hander who was born in Newark was 21-7 with a 2.53 ERA in 1963, the only season in which he was an All-Star. The next season, he was 18-13 with a 3.02 ERA, then 2-0 with a 1.59 ERA in a World Series won by St. Louis in seven games.\n\nBob Sherman | AP\n\nNo. 57, Steve Howe\n\nThe late lefty reliever who died at age 48 in 1996 is best known for transforming from a young star with the Dodgers to having drug problems. He spent the second half of his career wearing No. 57 as a Yankee, and he had three good seasons and three bad ones going 18-10 with a 3.57 ERA over 497 games from 1991-96.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 58, Randy Choate\n\nAlfonso Soriano debuted in the majors in 1999 going 1-for-8 in nine games wearing 48, but Choate wins out, as he was 3-2 with a 3.72 ERA over 59 relief appearances wearing the number from 2000-01.\n\nChris O'Meara | AP\n\nNo. 59, Juan Rivera\n\nThe last of nine Yankees to wear 59, the Venezuelan outfielder hit .266 with 8 homers and 32 RBIs with the number from 2002-03. Others who were No. 59 briefly included Damaso Garcia (1979), Roberto Kelly (1987) and Hensley Meulens (1992).\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 60, Nick Johnson\n\nThe lefty-swinging first baseman played a lot from 2002-03 wearing No. 36, but he debuted in the majors in 2001 wearing No. 60. While batting just .194 in 23 games, Johnson hit his first career homer in a win over Boston and his second ignited a 5-4 comeback win in Baltimore in a game the Yankees had trailed 4-0. Johnson beat out former Marlins-Red Sox star third baseman Mike Lowell, who hit .267 in eight September 1998 games as a Yankee.\n\nJeff Zelevansky | AP\n\nNo. 61, Ted Lilly\n\nIt was tough picking a winner out of the 23 Yankees who wore No. 61 since 1980. Dellin Betances began his career with 61, wearing it for his two games in 2011. Adam Warren also had it for his debut in 2012. Our pick is Lilly, a lefty who became a two-time All-Star after his Yankees days. He was 8-12 with a 4.65 ERA in 49 games with the Bombers from 2000-02.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 62, Joba Chamberlain\n\nJoba was an easy winner here, as he was a phenom for a while setting up closer Mariano Rivera, but Yankees great Jorge Posada wore No. 62 debuting in the majors in 1995 for one game. Chamberlain wore 62 way longer than anyone else and was 23-14 with a 3.85 ERA in 260 games as a Yankee from 2007-13.\n\nTwitter\n\nNo. 63, Mike Morgan\n\nMorgan famously pitched for 12 clubs during his 22-year career (1978-89, 1982-2002), and while with the Yankees in 1982 the righty was their first player to wear No. 63. Playing for three managers in 1982, Morgan was 7-11 with a 4.37 ERA in 30 games, 23 as a starter.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 64, Hector Noesi\n\nEleven Yankees have worn 64 since 1987, including Jose De Paula, Jacob Lindgren and Rob Refsnyder in 2015. Noesi spent the most time with 64 and did a decent job going 2-2 with a 4.47 ERA over 30 games, 28 in relief, for the 2011 Yankees.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 65, Phil Hughes\n\nThe right-hander was a runaway winner here, beating out a field that included fellow pitcher Bryan Mitchell (2014). Hughes wore 65 while going 56-50 with a 4.53 ERA pitching for the Yankees from 2007-13. He was an All-Star in 2010 when going 18-8 and was 16-13 in 2012.\n\nYouTube\n\nNo. 66, John Ryan Murphy\n\nThe three-name catcher is one of five Yankees to wear a number most associated with Hockey Hall of Famer Mario Lemieux. Murphy hit .242 over 126 games during stints with the Yankees from 2013-15, the start of his big-league career.\n\nGregory Fisher | USA TODAY Sports\n\nNo. 67, James Pazos\n\nThe lefty reliever is the last of seven obscure Yankees to wear 67 and the most successful. In 2015, Pazos appeared in 11 games and worked scoreless innings."
