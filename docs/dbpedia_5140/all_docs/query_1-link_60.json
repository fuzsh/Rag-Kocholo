Original content six days a week, straight to your inbox and straight from the hearts of baseball fans.\n\nPregame Pepper\n\nDid you know…\n\nAll-Star closer Josh Hader has been a bust since joining the Padres in a surprise Aug. 1 swap from the payroll-purging Brewers. Hader, a 28-year-old lefty who throws heat, went 1-1 with a blown save and a 16.20 ERA in his first 3.1 innings pitched since joining the Padres and lost his late-inning job — at least temporarily . . .\n\nSwitch-hitting slugger Josh Bell posted All-Star caliber numbers prior to his trade from the Nationals to the Padres but hit just .121 in his first 16 games with the Pads before recapturing the stroke he left in Washington . . .\n\nThe first three pitchers with 15 wins this year were Justin Verlander, Tony Gonsolin, and Kyle Wright . . .\n\nOrioles assistant pitching coach Darren Holmes walked over to the stands during a game to watch the official engagement of his daughter Courtney . . .\n\nThe father of Boston manager Alex Cora founded the Little League team in his hometown in Puerto Rico . . .\n\nBaltimore manager Brandon Hyde has met five presidents, including George W. Bush at the Little League Classic last Sunday . . .\n\nBy the time the Braves play the Mets again, they’ll probably have Ozzie Albies at second base, Vaughn Grissom in left field, and Mike Soroka on the mound . . .\n\nMets closer Edwin Diaz has emerged as a serious NL Cy Young Award contender.\n\nLeading Off\n\nThe Most Forgotten Yankee?\n\nIf they must retire another number, let it be Gil McDougald’s.\n\nBy Jeff Kallman\n\nWhen Paul O’Neill stood in Yankee Stadium for the retirement of his uniform number 21 last Sunday afternoon, he gestured to five former teammates at his side—Hall of Famer Mariano Rivera plus Tino Martinez, Andy Pettitte, Jorge Posada, and Bernie Williams—and spoke of winning.\n\n“The fans remember the teams that win,” the former right fielder now a Yankee commentator for their YES Network said. “And we won a lot.” They’ve also retired a lot of uniform numbers. To be precise, 22 of them. (If you’re scoring at home, they haven’t retired number 22. Yet.)\n\nFew baseball organizations are as conscious of their own history as the Yankees. Few fans are as steeped in that history as Yankee fans. But no one more than the Yankees have made the number retirement almost meaningless. The time may not be too distant when you see mostly triple-digit numbers on Yankee backs.\n\nIf O’Neill wanted to say (accurately) the fans remember the teams that win, there was a generation of Yankees who won a third more than O’Neill’s generation. Those were the teams of Casey Stengel on the bridge, Hall of Famer Yogi Berra behind the plate, Hall of Famer Whitey Ford on the mound, and Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle launching baseballs into the next state when not fighting his body and his demons.\n\nThey were also the teams of maybe the most forgotten but truly most valuable Yankee other than Berra, the arguable greatest team player of the 20th Century in any sport. This forgotten Yankee wore number 12 his entire Yankee career. The very thing that made him the second-most valuable team-play asset behind Yogi might be the very thing that kept him from being a star, never mind a Hall of Famer.\n\nGil McDougald was a genuine Yankee jack of all trades. He was a fine hitter (including one American League leadership in triples), an American League Rookie of the Year (1951, though Hall of Famer Minnie Miñoso should have won the award), but most of all a defensive virtuoso at the three toughest positions in the infield.\n\nStop laughing. McDougald finished his career in double figures on the positive side for defensive runs above his league average at all three. (Second base: +46. Shortstop: +16. Third base: +13.) “McDougald . . . was versatile,” wrote Stengel biographer Robert W. Creamer.\n\nHe was Stengel’s third baseman, second baseman, and shortstop in different seasons, and he led the league in making double plays at each position. Of all the players Stengel managed in New York, none better exemplified the kind of team he was trying to develop than the talented, professional McDougald.\n\nO’Neill played for five Yankee pennant winners and won four World Series rings out of the five. McDougald played for eight Yankee pennant winners—including the final three of Stengel’s unprecedented five straight as a manager—and won five Series rings.\n\nFor all his versatility, McDougald wasn’t exactly one of the Stengel Yankees’ big stars, which probably suited the quiet man from San Francisco just fine. But he may also get too-short shrift because of a Cleveland pitching legend named Herb Score.\n\nTo this day there are probably people who believe McDougald destroyed Score’s promising career with a line drive right back to the box and off Score’s face in 1957. Not quite. Score returned in 1958 and, took a short spell to find his proper form again. Once he did, alas, he did he had the misfortune to blow his elbow out pitching on a damp night.\n\nThat—not the McDougald liner—turned Score from comer to mediocre. As it happens, while McDougald was blocked from visiting Score in the hospital, no less than Score’s mother told Score’s sister, “You need to go down to the church and say your prayers for Herb, but more than that to pray for Gil McDougald. That man is a hurting man.”\n\nLittle did she know. Two years earlier, McDougald suffered a similar injury in spring training. Chatting with a Yankee coach, McDougald took a batting practise line drive behind an ear. (“The blow had broken a hearing tube,” he once said) The injury would leave McDougald completely deaf by the mid-1970s.\n\nThat story would be told by New York Times sportswriter Ira Berkow in 1994, in “McDougald, Once a Quiet Yankee Star, Now Lives in a Quiet World.” Not long after, as McDougald himself would say through happy tears, “They’ve turned the music back on”: the former infielder received a cochlear implant that restored his hearing for the final fifteen years of his life. (He died at 82 in 2010.)\n\nBerkow’s essay plus his happy followup, “For McDougald, the Miracle of Sound,” were republished in the Berkow anthology Summers in the Bronx: Attila the Hun and Other Yankee Stories.\n\nLong before, after the heartbreak of the 1960 World Series loss and the dismissal of Stengel, the Yankees left McDougald open to the first American League expansion draft. The incoming Los Angeles Angels selected him, but McDougald chose to retire, instead. At 32.\n\nIt’s not that I want to encourage further Yankee uniform retirements to deepen the lack of meaning in the honour. But retiring number 12 for McDougald wouldn’t be truly meaningless. Role player? McDougald was a third of the cast for the price of one and enhanced, not eroded the scenes.\n\n“The way that Stengel used him,” Bill James wrote in due course (in The New Historical Baseball Abstract) “kept him from becoming a star . . . But then, Gil McDougald wasn’t born to be a star. He was born to be a Yankee.” A dirty job, but somebody had to do it.\n\nJeff Kallman is an IBWAA Life Member who writes Throneberry Fields Forever.

A week ago tonight, for example, they pounded the far more experienced Boston Red Sox, 15-10, in a game that featured 37 hits. Five of those were Oriole homers.\n\n“We don’t have any boring wins,” said relief pitcher Joey Krehbiel. “We’re getting hits when we’re supposed to, getting strikeouts when we’re supposed to. It’s never just another win. It’s always something exciting, which makes it very fun to watch.”\n\nAlthough the Baby Birds nearly landed on the wrong side of no-hitters twice this month, they avoided that embarrassment with timely shots. They are a team of kids that doesn’t take no for an answer.\n\n“It kind of reminds me of 1966,” said one-time Oriole hero Boog Powell, who keeps up with the O’s from his home in Key West, Florida. “A couple of years ago, I was sitting there watching and wondering what they were doing. Then all of a sudden, everything came together.”\n\nAfter three straight 100-loss seasons, this year’s O’s started as if they would produce more of the same. But then the kids got a chance.\n\nIn their 15-10 win over the Red Sox, the Birds got big contributions from Cedric Mullins, Anthony Santander, Ryan Mountcastle, Adley Rutschman, and Jorge Mateo, among others.\n\nIt was the first time since 2015 they finished with at least 11 extra-base hits.\n\n“I was uneasy until two outs in the ninth inning,” said manager Brandon Hyde, who has made a habit of exchanging text messages with highly-respected Ravens football coach John Harbaugh after games.\n\nNo longer considered spoilers in the tough American League East, the Birds are considered contenders. Dark-horse contenders maybe but nobody is ruling them out.\n\nWith playoffs expanded to six entries per league, the Baltimore Orioles are creating chaos — and even wearing T-shirts with that word on the front.\n\nWith eight walk-off victories, it’s obvious the team’s on-the-job training is paying off.\n\n“They’re relentless,” said Boston manager Alex Cora of the Orioles. “They hit everything. They have some good hitters over there. They’re a really good club.”\n\nAnd they’re one of the 2022 season’s most memorable feel-good stories.\n\nFormer AP sportswriter Dan Schlossberg of Fair Lawn, NJ is on a book-signing tour.
