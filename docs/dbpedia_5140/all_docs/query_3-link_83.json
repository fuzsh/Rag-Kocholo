        "text": "Remember the picture of Aaron Judge donning a Red Sox shirt that made waves last summer? Well the New York Yankees outfielder finally gives us an explanation.\n\nDuring Aaron Judge’s 2017 Rookie of the Year campaign, jealous Red Sox fans decided to try and tear him down. But the New York Yankees superstar was not fazed.\n\nFans, on the other hand, were perturbed when a picture of Aaron Judge wearing a Red Sox shirt surfaced from Judge’s younger years. How could the biggest piece (literally and figuratively) on the Yankees betray fans with that?\n\nWell, Judge had an explanation for that, as he told reporters during Friday’s event to promote Oakley’s new line.\n\nYankee fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief that their All-Star is, indeed, not a Red Sox fan. He was just a victim of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nI guess we should all be okay with this, seeing as how getting his start in the Cape Cod brought him to the Yankees. The past is the past and now, Aaron Judge is clobbering home runs for the New York Yankees and that is all that matters.\n\nJudge, who is currently sidelined with a fractured wrist, is batting .285 so far this season with 26 home runs. However, the Yankees are also missing his leadership in the dugout and his glove in right field. For the time being, Shane Robinson has been taking over Judge’s spot and, well, he’s no Aaron Judge.\n\nHis return cannot come soon enough for the Bombers, who are in the midst of the playoff hunt. However, they don’t want to rush him back from that injury too soon in case he aggravates it even more.\n\nFingers crossed for the best case scenario in regards to his wrist. At least we have some good news right now in terms of that whole shirt debacle."
