No notes.\n\nThe team released a statement and quotes, but it’s the usual new deal corporatespeak, about how proud the club is to strike this deal while completely ignoring the significance of what the team is doing here.\n\nSo that’s it, anything’s possible now. The rest of the league’s teams are going to fall in line pretty quickly now. Buckle up."
