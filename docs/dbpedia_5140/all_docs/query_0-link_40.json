        "text": "# 3 - Frank \"Pep\" Saul\n\nKnown as \"Pep,\" Frank Benjamin Saul was one of the Pirates' top players during a thrilling run in the 1940's. Seton Hall's first 1,000 point scorer, Saul played on the 1942-43 squad before serving a term in World War II. He later returned to captain the team for three years from 1946-49, leading the team in scoring in each of those seasons. His 1,011 career points ranks 39th on the school's all-time list. Elected into the Seton Hall Athletics Hall of Fame in 1973, Saul was drafted by the NBA's Rochester Royals in 1949 and went on to win four NBA titles in his career.\n\n# 5 - Walter Dukes\n\nAn unrivaled force of dominance in school history, Dukes donned the blue & white from 1950-1953 and proceeded to terrorize opponents night-in and night-out. Dukes powered the Pirates to an 80-12 record during his career, highlighted by a 1953 National Invitation Tournament (NIT) Championship run, of which he was named Most Valuable Player. An All-American selection and a recipient of the Haggerty Award as the top player in the Metropolitan area, Dukes etched his name into college basketball lure forever thanks to his astounding propensity for rebounding the basketball. He averaged 18.9 rebounds per game for his career, and grabbed a NCAA single-season record 734 boards (22.2 per game) in 1952-53, a mark which still stands almost 50 years later. Dukes went on to play a year with the legendary Harlem Globetrotters, before earning three All-Star selections and averaging a double-double over eight years in the NBA.\n\n# 6 - Kelly Smith\n\nWidely regarded as the greatest women's soccer player in Pirates history and consistently rated among the best of her generation, Smith became the first player from the women's soccer program to be inducted into the Seton Hall Athletics Hall of Fame. In three years at Seton Hall, Smith tallied a school record 76 goals and 174 points in just 51 matches. The first and only player in the program's history to receive All-America honors, she was named the BIG EAST Offensive Player of the Year three times. The NCAA statistical champion in goals and points per game in 1998 and 1999, Smith currently holds two NCAA records in career points per game (3.41) and goals per game (1.49). On the international stage, she has earned over 100 caps for her native England including on the World Cup and European Championship stage. She is the nation's all-time leader in goals with 45 tallies for her country.\n\n# 9 - Marteese Robinson\n\nThanks to first baseman Marteese Robinson, 1987 was one of the greatest years on record for the Seton Hall University baseball team. The Pirates finished the season with a 45-10 record, capturing Seton Hall's first BIG EAST Conference baseball title, an accomplishment that was not repeated until May 2001. Teamed up with Mo Vaughn and Craig Biggio, Robinson is part of one of the greatest 3-4-5 combinations in college baseball history. Robinson and Vaughn were tied for second in the nation in 1987 with 90 RBIs. In 1987, Robinson led the nation in hitting; his .529 batting average remains among the highest in NCAA history, earning him NCAA Co-Player of the Year and All-America honors. His 126 hits that season still sit near the top of the NCAA's all-time list. In his three years at Seton Hall, Robinson posted a .423 career batting average. Following his explosive performance in his junior year, Robinson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics. In October 2001, Robinson and Rick Cerone became the first baseball players to have their numbers retired by the University.\n\n#11 - Bob Davies\n\nSimply put, Davies was one of the most prolific players of his time and a pioneer in the game of basketball. He played with a signature flare that helped him become a genuine star at Seton Hall from 1939-42. Often cited as the innovator of the behind-the-back dribble, Davies was half showman and half clutch performer, earning All-American honors and leaving a creative impact that transcended his era. At SHU, Davies led The Hall to a three-year record of 55-5 as a member of the renowned \"Wonder Five,\" and was later inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1970 following a standout professional career.\n\n# 12 - Jodi Brooks\n\nBrooks is credited with helping to put the Seton Hall women's basketball team on the national map. In 1994, she played a starring role in what is often referred to as the Pirates best season, earning a NCAA Tournament berth and advancing to the \"Sweet 16.\" That year, the team posted a 27-5 record and boasted a national ranking of 14. She also was named Player of the Year for New Jersey and the Metropolitan Area, and received an Honorable Mention as an All-American. Brooks was a two-time All-BIG EAST selection in 1993 and 1994. Brooks is the only player in Seton Hall history to record more than 1,500 points, 500 rebounds, 400 assists and 200 steals. In what proved to be an immaculate senior season, she led the team in scoring, averaging 18.6 points per game, the second highest single-season average in program history and scored in double-digits in 44 of her last 45 games. Also that year, Brooks set single-season school records in steals (96) and three-point field goal percentage (.424). She also made the third most field goals by a Pirate in one season (218), and dished out the fourth-highest single season assist total with 144. Upon graduation, Brooks remained directly involved with the Pirate program, serving for the next three seasons, as a women's basketball graduate assistant coach.\n\n#12 - Richie Regan\n\nOne of the most impactful figures in Seton Hall Athletics history, Regan was considered one of the finest playmakers in school history on the court. He was the catalyst of the 1953 NIT Championship team and finished his career with 1,167 total points. Following graduation and brief stints in the marine corps and the NBA, Regan returned to South Orange where he coached the Pirates from 1960-70. He later became the school's athletics director and Executive Director and Founder of the Pirate Blue Athletic Fund. In an act that served as a microcosm of his generosity and love for Seton Hall, Regan agreed to the \"un-retiring\" of his #12 for use by standout point guard Andre Barrett '04, who later ceremoniously returned the number to the Regan family. For over 50 years, Regan remained affiliated with Seton Hall men's basketball in some capacity - player, coach, administrator, etc. - until his passing on Dec. 24, 2002. His name still graces the school's on-campus recreation center.\n\n# 15 - Rick Cerone\n\nPrior to departing after being taken in the first round by the Cleveland Indians following his junior season, Cerone swung his way into the school record book in his three seasons behind the plate for the Pirates. A part of back-to-back College World Series appearances in 1974 and 1975, Cerone led the squad in home runs in each of his three years in South Orange. Cerone left SHU as the school's all-time leader in batting average (.363) and home runs (26) and now ranks seventh overall in each category. A First Team ABCA All-America selection following the 1975 campaign, Cerone's 15 home runs and .776 slugging percentage during that year still rank fifth on the school's all-time single season list, while 64 runs batted-in represent the ninth highest total in one season by any Pirate on record. He went on to have a successful 17-year professional career, playing for eight major league clubs including the New York Mets and three stints with the New York Yankees. A native of Newark, Cerone brought professional baseball to his hometown in 1998 when he founded the Newark Bears.\n\n# 17 - Mike Sheppard Sr.\n\nIn his 31 years as head coach at Seton Hall from 1973-2003, Sheppard recorded 28 winning seasons and 27 postseason berths, highlighted by 15 BIG EAST Tournament appearances. He was named the BIG EAST Coach of the Year three times (1985, 1987, and 1989), and guided the Pirates to the conference tournament title in 1987. Sheppard's squads reached the NCAA Tournament 12 times while he led Seton Hall to appearances in the College World Series in 1974 and 1975. Under Sheppard's tutelage, the Pirates won 20 or more games 30 times, 30 or more games 22 times, and 40 or more games five times. He holds a career record of 998-540-11 and ranks in the top 75 on the list of NCAA's all-time winningest coaches (by victories). During his tenure, more than 80 Seton Hall players have gone on to sign professional contracts, with 30 of them moving on to play in the major leagues, including Charlie Puleo, John Morris, and Pat Pacillo. He coached John Valentin to a fifth round draft pick plus eight first round draft picks that consisted of such stars as Craig Biggio, Rick Cerone, Jason Grilli, Matt Morris, and Mo Vaughn. In addition to coaching, Sheppard spent a total of 40 years as a full-time faculty member for the university beginning as an associate professor for Health and Physical Education, and later serving as the Department Chairman within the College of Education. His unquantifiable contribution to Seton Hall baseball and the university as a whole led to Sheppard being named head coach emeritus, a position he still holds. He was inducted into the American Baseball Coaches Association (ABCA) Hall of Fame on Jan. 7, 2011, the Seton Hall University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1996, and had his number 17 retired by the Pirates in 2004. In the spring of 2012, the home of Seton Hall softball was renamed \"Essex County Mike Sheppard Sr. Field.\"\n\n# 24 - Terry Dehere\n\nThe only active Pirate to ever have his number retired, Dehere led SHU in scoring during all four of his seasons (1989-93) and still stands as the school's all-time leading scorer. In four seasons, he amassed 2,494 career points, finishing with an average of 19.5 per contest. The engine behind an era of huge successes for Seton Hall, Dehere steered the Pirates to two BIG EAST Tournament and regular season titles, along with three NCAA Tournament appearances, highlighted by a berth in the 1991 West Regional Final. As a senior, Dehere raked in the personal accolades, earning consensus All-American honors as well as being named BIG EAST Player of the Year and MVP of the league tournament. He went on to play five seasons in the NBA with the Los Angeles Clippers, Sacramento Kings and Vancouver Grizzlies.\n\n#32 - Robin Cunningham\n\nCunningham was the first woman ever to receive an athletic scholarship to Seton Hall, and was also the first inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984. She finished her basketball career with 1,003 points, which currently ranks her 19th on the all-time scoring list. To this day, Cunningham ranks among the program's all-time leaders in rebounds, blocks, steals and field goals made as well. In 1981, she became the first Pirate women's athlete to have her uniform number retired. Cunningham also played tennis and softball at Seton Hall, posting a 52-15 career record for the tennis team.\n\n# 34 - Glenn Mosley\n\nUnquestionably one of the best big men ever to put on a Seton Hall uniform, Mosley averaged 17.4 points per game over a stellar career, and sits 19th on the school's all-time scoring list with 1,441 points. He supplemented his scoring output with a staggering 15.2 rebound per game average that still ranks among the best in NCAA history. As a senior in 1976-77, Mosley led the nation in rebounding, grabbing 16.3 boards per contest. He finished his career second all-time at SHU with 1,263 career rebounds, a spot he still holds. His collegiate exploits led to Mosley becoming a first-round draft choice of the Philadelphia 76ers in 1977 (20th overall).\n\n#44 - Craig Biggio\n\nA two-time First Team All-BIG EAST selection, Biggio dominated as the Pirates' catcher from 1985 through 1987. Named NJCBA Player of the Year in 1986 and First Team All-America by Baseball America in 1987, he led the Pirates to a three-year record of 121-55-1 and their first BIG EAST Championship in 1987. Biggio is Seton Hall's career leader in triples, is second in runs scored and ranks in the Pirates' top-10 in 18 other single-season and career statistical categories. A career .342 hitter with 27 home runs, 148 RBIs and 90 steals, he was inducted into the Seton Hall Athletics Hall of Fame in 1996. Following his time at SHU, Biggio embarked on a historic 20-year professional career, establishing himself as one of the most dangerous offensive second basemen in the game's storied history. A seven-time all-star, he is one of only 28 players in MLB history to record 3,000-career hits, currently ranking 21st all-time with 3,060 base knocks.\n\n#44 - Nick Werkman\n\nNick \"the Quick\" Werkman established a legacy as one of the most prolific scorers in college basketball history during his time on the hardwood for the Pirates. Despite ranking second on the school's all-time career scoring list, the blue and white has never adorned a finisher who could fill the basket at the rate which Werkman made a nightly standard. Werkman poured in 2,273 points all told during his three varsity seasons, averaging an astounding 32.0 points per game from 1961-64. Twice named an All-American, he was crowned the NCAA scoring champion following the 1962-63 season with a 29.5 points per game average. Ironically, that year was the least productive in terms of scoring numbers during his time as a Pirate. Werkman had averaged 33.0 points per game as a sophomore the previous year and as a senior averaged a career-best 33.2. Despite his scoring prowess, Werkman was far from just an offensive machine. He graduated with a career rebounding average of 14.6 per game and held 25 individual SHU records at the time of his departure."
