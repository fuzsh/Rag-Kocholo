        "text": "Every single-digit number has been retired by the New York Yankees. Well, except for zero.\n\nThis season, Yankees reliever Adam Ottavino will become the first player to don the No. 0 for the Yankees. The team officially introduced him on Thursday.\n\nOttavino made headlines earlier this offseason when he took a shot at another Yankee that wore one digit: Babe Ruth. The recently-signed reliever said on a podcast that he could easily strike out the baseball legend.\n\n\"I'm not trying to disrespect him, you know, rest in peace, you know, shoutout to Babe Ruth,\" Ottavino said. \"But it was a different game. I mean, the guy ate hot dogs and drank beer and did whatever he did. It was just a different game.\"\n\nYankees fans can hope that Ottavino's Yankees tenure ends as well as the players who wore Nos. 1-9.\n\nYankees retired numbers\n\n1: Billy Martin\n\n2: Derek Jeter\n\n3: Babe Ruth\n\n4: Lou Gehrig\n\n5: Joe DiMaggio\n\n6: Joe Torre\n\n7: Mickey Mantle\n\n8: Bill Dickey and Yogi Berra\n\n9: Roger Maris\n\n10: Phil Rizzuto\n\n15: Thurman Munson\n\n16: Whitey Ford\n\n20: Jorge Posada\n\n23: Don Mattingly\n\n32: Elston Howard\n\n37: Casey Stengel\n\n42: Mariano Rivera\n\n44: Reggie Jackson\n\n46: Andy Pettitte\n\n49: Ron Guidry\n\n51: Bernie Williams"
