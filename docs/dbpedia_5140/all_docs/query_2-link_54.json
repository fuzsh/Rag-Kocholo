        "text": "TAMPA, Fla. – If most New York Yankees’ fans had their way, Paul O’Neill’s number would have been retired years ago by the organization.\n\nIn effect, O’Neill’s No. 21 has been retired since 2008.\n\nIt was last worn by LaTroy Hawkins, who – through no fault of his own – caused a public relations uproar by pitching to a 5.71 ERA in 33 games while wearing No. 21 in pinstripes.\n\nAs a Yankees official said at the time, there might not have been such outrage if an outfielder or infielder had No. 21 on his back.\n\nBut a Yankees pitcher getting roughed up with \"The Warrior’s\" No. 21 front and center on the TV camera? Different story.\n\nFor a short time in 2017, there was talk about whether Todd Frazier might ask O’Neill for his blessing to wear No. 21, a number the veteran third baseman had worn throughout his career.\n\nUpon his arrival in the Bronx, O’Neill won the fans’ affection by wearing his emotions on his pinstriped sleeve, treating each at-bat as a personal war and helping to lift the Yankees from their early 1990s darkness to the Canyon of Heroes.\n\nAnd now, all the unofficial-ness about O’Neill’s mothballed number and the speculation about when it might ever be re-issued is over.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Yankees got around to announcing that O’Neill’s No. 21 would officially join their long list of retired numbers in a ceremony – fittingly – on Aug. 21 at Yankee Stadium.\n\nAccording to the Yankees, all guests in attendance for that day’s game against the Toronto Blue Jays will receive a commemorative Paul O’Neill Day ticket.\n\nO’Neill is the 23rd Yankees player or manager to have his number retired, and the first since Derek Jeter in 2017.\n\nVia Twitter, YES Network analyst Jack Curry said he spoke to O’Neill about the honor and “he said he had goosebumps when he got the call,’’ and added that “this is my Hall of Fame.’’\n\nO’Neill already has a plaque in Monument Park, dedicated in 2014.\n\nHe was an essential part of the Yankees’ transition into a powerhouse, thanks to the shrewd trade Gene Michael made before the 1993 season, sending Roberto Kelly to Cincinnati for the lanky, lefty-hitting right fielder from Ohio.\n\nO’Neill would spend his last nine big-league seasons in the Bronx, earning four World Series rings (1996, 1998-2000) while batting .303 with an .869 OPS.\n\nHe won the AL batting title in the strike-shortened 1994 season, batting .359.\n\nBut the O’Neill that Yankees fans came to love was never one to give away an at-bat, which is why no exposed dugout watercooler was safe during an 0-for-4 game.\n\nA guy who could be difficult and self-critical in media settings as a player has become a jovial presence on Yankees telecasts for the YES Network, trading wisecracks with his fellow broadcasters along with offering his insights on the game today and from his 17-year MLB career.\n\n\"Wow,'' O'Neill said via Twitter of receiving \"the greatest honor of my life'' from the Yankees.\n\n\"My heartfelt thanks to the Steinbrenner family, the entire Yankees organization, YES Network, my teammates and coaches over the years, and most importantly the fans of New York.\n\n\"I'm forever grateful for all you have done for me and my family.''"
