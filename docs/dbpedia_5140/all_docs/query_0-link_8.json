        "text": "He's right, of course. Election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame is baseball's highest honor, but it is largely determined by the worthiness of the honoree's numbers.\n\nBut the number – singular – is where honor goes to hang in forever glory in the honoree's home ballpark.\n\n“Look at that, good kid, I made it, 'Top of the World,' ” the late No. 20, 91-year-old Monte Irvin, told Murphy, who was the “good kid” that Monte first called him when they met in 1962 – and called him that again on the day the Giants retired Irvin's number in 2010.\n\nIrvin’s “20” is baseball’s most frequently retired number at 11 times. Baltimore’s Frank Robinson was first (Spring Training 1972) – barely beating out Pittsburgh’s Pie Traynor (Opening Day, 1972) – and also the most recent (2017, Cleveland, where he was baseball’s first African-American manager). In between, Robinson’s number was retired in 1998 (Cincinnati).\n\nThe other 20s include Luis Gonzalez (Arizona), Frank White (Kansas City), Don Sutton (Los Angeles Dodgers), Jorge Posada (New York Yankees), Mike Schmidt (Philadelphia), Lou Brock (St. Louis) and Irvin.\n\nBack in the day, Willie Mays would order – by the bushel-load – the most famous No. 24 jersey of them all, and trade them for the No. 24 uniforms of visiting players, even offering to buy the number right off their backs for $1,000 apiece.\n\nMays inspired at least two generations of young ballplayers, especially those who fancied themselves as center fielders, to wear the double dozen. Ken Griffey Jr. is the \"24\" today's players often emulate. The tradition lives on.\n\n“Somewhere, Willie has a closet full of those 24s,” said Murphy, chuckling at the memory.\n\n“Players like their numbers,” he added. “You (used to) see players wear the numbers on a chain around their neck, fans with the numbers on their back. There's just something about baseball numbers. The number becomes who that player is to the fans and is forever associated with him.”"
