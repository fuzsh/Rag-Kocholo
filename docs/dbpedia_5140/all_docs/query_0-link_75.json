        "text": "Paul O’Neill’s place in New York Yankees history is secure. The club announced Tuesday it will retire the No. 21 worn by the five-time World Series champion (four with the Yankees, one with the Cincinnati Reds).\n\nHere is the list of Yankees’ retired numbers:\n\n1 Billy Martin August 10, 1986\n\n2 Derek Jeter May 14, 2017\n\n3 Babe Ruth June 13, 1948\n\n4 Lou Gehrig July 4, 1939\n\n5 Joe DiMaggio April 18, 1952\n\n6 Joe Torre August 23, 2014\n\n7 Mickey Mantle June 8, 1969\n\n8 Yogi Berra July 22, 1972\n\n8 Bill Dickey July 22, 1972\n\n9 Roger Maris July 22, 1984\n\n10 Phil Rizzuto August 4, 1985\n\n15 Thurman Munson September 20, 1980\n\n16 Whitey Ford August 3, 1974\n\n20 Jorge Posada August 22, 2015\n\n21 Paul O’Neill August 21, 2022\n\n23 Don Mattingly August 31, 1997\n\n32 Elston Howard July 22, 1984\n\n37 Casey Stengel August 8, 1970\n\n42 Mariano Rivera September 22, 2013\n\n44 Reggie Jackson August 14, 1993\n\n46 Andy Pettitte August 23, 2015\n\n49 Ron Guidry August 23, 2003\n\n51 Bernie Williams May 24, 2015\n\nMORE MLB:\n\n- MLB rumors: Yankees’ stopgap shortstop solution might be off the trade market\n\n- MLB rumors: Ex-Yankees, Mets left-hander announces retirement plans\n\n- MLB insider can’t wait to scout elite Yankees prospect in spring training\n\nHere are the details of the retirement ceremony from Yankees PR:\n\nNew York Yankees today announced that Paul O’Neill will be honored on Sunday, August 21, as his No. 21 will be permanently retired prior to the Yankees’ game vs. the Toronto Blue Jays. All guests in attendance will receive a commemorative “Paul O’Neill Day” game ticket.\n\nO’Neill becomes the 23rd Yankees player or manager to have his number retired and the first since Derek Jeter on May 14, 2017. Other Yankees from O’Neill’s playing days to have had their numbers retired are Jeter (No. 2), Don Mattingly (No. 23), Andy Pettitte (No. 46), Jorge Posada (No. 20), Mariano Rivera (No. 42), Bernie Williams (No. 51) and Manager Joe Torre (No. 6).\n\nO’Neill was previously celebrated at Yankee Stadium on August 9, 2014, when he received a plaque in Monument Park.\n\nCurrently a game analyst for the YES Network, O’Neill spent the final nine seasons of his 17-year Major League career in the Bronx (1993-2001), winning four World Series with the Yankees (1996, ‘98-2000) and appearing in a fifth (2001). He concluded his Yankees career with a .303 batting average, 304 doubles, 185 home runs, 858 runs batted in, a .377 on-base percentage and an .869 OPS, claiming the American League batting title in 1994 with a .359 average. Additionally, he was a four-time All-Star with the Yankees (1994-95, ‘97-98).\n\nAffectionately referred to as “The Warrior” by fans and known for his powerful throwing arm, the left-handed-hitting O’Neill played in 235 consecutive games in right field without making an error from July 1995 to May 1997. In 2001, he became the first 38-year-old in Major League history to steal 20 bases and hit 20 home runs in the same season — a mark later equaled by Gary Sheffield in 2007.\n\nThank you for relying on us to provide the journalism you can trust.
