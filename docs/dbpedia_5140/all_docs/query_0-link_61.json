        "text": "It's only a number.\n\nOr is it?\n\nNo. 42. It's not just another number in baseball. It's the jersey number of Jackie Robinson, who broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball in 1947.\n\nMLB retired the Hall of Famer's number in 1997 – 50 years after his debut with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Now, the last player to wear the No. 42 – Mariano Rivera – will follow in Robinson's footsteps into the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday, along with Mike Mussina, the late Roy Halladay, Edgar Martinez, Harold Baines and Lee Smith.\n\nRivera wore No. 42 when he began his career with the New York Yankees and was permitted to keep the number until he retried in 2013.\n\nAnd like Rivera and Robinson, many other elite players are identified by their jersey number.\n\nHere are the best Hall of Fame players at each uniform number – from Ozzie Smith at No. 1 to Carlton Fisk at No. 72.\n\n1 – Ozzie Smith\n\n2 – Charlie Gehringer (until Derek Jeter is eligible in 2020)\n\n3 – Babe Ruth\n\n4 – Lou Gehrig\n\n5 – Joe DiMaggio (Honorable mention: Johnny Bench, Brooks Robinson, George Brett)\n\n6 – Stan Musial\n\n7 – Mickey Mantle (Honorable mention: Ivan Rodriguez)\n\n8 – Cal Ripken Jr. (Honorable mention: Yogi Berra, Gary Carter, Joe Morgan, Willie Stargell, Carl Yastrzemski)\n\n9 – Ted Williams\n\n10 – Chipper Jones (Honorable mention: Lefty Grove)\n\n11 – Barry Larkin\n\n12 – Roberto Alomar\n\n13 – None (apologies to Alex Rodriguez)\n\n14 – Ernie Banks (apologies to Pete Rose)\n\n15 – Red Ruffing\n\n16 – Whitey Ford\n\n17 – Dizzy Dean\n\n18 – None\n\n19 – Tony Gwynn (Honorable mention: Bob Feller, Robin Yount)\n\n20 – Frank Robinson (Honorable mention: Mike Schmidt)\n\n21 – Roberto Clemente (apologies to Roger Clemens)\n\n22 – Jim Palmer\n\n23 – Ryne Sandberg\n\n24 – Ken Griffey Jr. (Honorable mention: Willie Mays, Rickey Henderson; apologies to Barry Bonds)\n\n25 – Jim Thome (apologies to Barry Bonds)\n\n26 – Wade Boggs\n\n27 – Juan Marichal (Honorable mention: Vladimir Guerrero)\n\n28 – Bert Blyleven\n\n29 – Rod Carew (Honorable mention: John Smoltz)\n\n30 – Tim Raines\n\n31 – Greg Maddux (Honorable mention: Dave Winfield)\n\n32 – Steve Carlton (Honorable mention: Sandy Koufax)\n\n33 – Eddie Murray\n\n34 – Nolan Ryan (Honorable mention: Kirby Puckett)\n\n35 – Rickey Henderson (Honorable mention: Frank Thomas)\n\n36 – Gaylord Perry (Honorable mention: Robin Roberts)\n\n39 – Roy Campanella (Honorable mention: Hoyt Wilhelm)\n\n41 – Tom Seaver\n\n42 – Jackie Robinson (Honorable mention: Mariano Rivera )\n\n43 – Dennis Eckersley\n\n44 – Hank Aaron\n\n45 – Pedro Martinez (Honorable mention: Bob Gibson)\n\n47 – Tom Glavine\n\n51 – Randy Johnson\n\n53 – Don Drysdale\n\n54 – Goose Gossage"
