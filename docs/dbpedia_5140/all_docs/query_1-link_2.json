        "text": "The New York Yankees have a lot of double-digit jersey numbers on the field.\n\nJersey numbers was one of the storylines on Sunday in the Blue Jays-Yankee game — in addition to Whit Merrifield’s improbable two-bounce home run — with Paul O’Neill’s No. 21 coming off the board.\n\nO’Neill, an outfielder who was part of four Yankees World Series championships between 1996 and 2000, had his number retired prior to New York’s 4-2 win over Toronto.\n\nSo, how many jersey numbers do the Yankees have left?\n\nAfter Sunday’s retirement, the Yankees have retired the jersey of 24 players and managers.\n\nSo what’s left?\n\nThe numbers 1-10 are all out.\n\nBilly Martin.\n\nDerek Jeter.\n\nBabe Ruth.\n\nLou Gehrig.\n\nJoe DiMaggio.\n\nJoe Torre.\n\nMickey Mantle.\n\nYogi Berra, Bill Dickey.\n\nRoger Maris.\n\nPhil Rizzuto.\n\nThe numbers 11-14 are available, but the late Thurman Munson’s No. 15 is retired, as is No. 16 for Whitey Ford. That leaves 17-19 before Jorge Posada’s No. 20 becomes unavailable.\n\nHere are the rest of the retired numbers for the Yankees.\n\n21. Paul O’Neill.\n\n23. Don Mattingly.\n\n32. Elston Howard.\n\n37. Casey Stengel.\n\n42. Jackie Robinson, Mariano Rivera.\n\n44. Reggie Jackson.\n\n46. Andy Pettitte.\n\n49. Ron Guidry.\n\n51. Bernie Williams.\n\nThe numbers 52-99 leave another 48 available numbers.\n\nIn total, 22 jersey numbers are retired for the Yankees, leaving 77 numbers for current players. It remains to be seen if the current No. 99, MVP candidate Aaron Judge, stays with the Yankees and eventually ends up with his jersey retired.\n\nThe lowest number on the current roster is 12, worn by infielder Isiah Kiner-Falefa."
