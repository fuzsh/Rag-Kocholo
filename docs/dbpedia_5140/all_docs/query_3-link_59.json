        "text": "HOUSTON – In a throwback to the days of DiMaggio, Mantle, and Berra, the 2024 Yankees will debut jerseys on Opening Day like those worn decades ago.\n\nGone is the white outlining to “New York’’ and to the number on the back, which will now be a plain navy blue against the traditional gray uniform.\n\nAdditionally, the dark blue and white trim on the sleeve cuffs has been eliminated.\n\nOPENING DAY: See the Yankees and Astros' starting lineups\n\nIt’s the most significant alteration to the Yankees jersey since flannels went out after the 1973 season, and the idea came from a group of Yankees players.\n\nAfter the 2021 Iowa “Field of Dreams’’ game, when the Yankees donned throwback jerseys like what they’ll be wearing in Thursday’s season opener at Minute Maid Park, Yankees captain Aaron Judge and others were said to have approached Yankees officials about adopting this look full time.\n\nThe request made its way to owner Hal Steinbrenner, who approved it for the 2024 season.\n\nJUAN SOTO: How he changes the Yankees' lineup and outlook as season begins\n\nAccording to a person familiar with the change, the alteration was also a welcome change because the striped cuffs at sleeve bottom proved irritating unless a longer t-shirt was worn underneath.\n\nSee what the Yankees' road uniforms look like"
