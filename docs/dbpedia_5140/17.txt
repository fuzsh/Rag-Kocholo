Here are the details of the retirement ceremony from Yankees PR:

New York Yankees today announced that Paul O’Neill will be honored on Sunday, August 21, as his No. 21 will be permanently retired prior to the Yankees’ game vs. the Toronto Blue Jays. All guests in attendance will receive a commemorative “Paul O’Neill Day” game ticket.

O’Neill becomes the 23rd Yankees player or manager to have his number retired and the first since Derek Jeter on May 14, 2017. Other Yankees from O’Neill’s playing days to have had their numbers retired are Jeter (No. 2), Don Mattingly (No. 23), Andy Pettitte (No. 46), Jorge Posada (No. 20), Mariano Rivera (No. 42), Bernie Williams (No. 51) and Manager Joe Torre (No. 6).

O’Neill was previously celebrated at Yankee Stadium on August 9, 2014, when he received a plaque in Monument Park.

Currently a game analyst for the YES Network, O’Neill spent the final nine seasons of his 17-year Major League career in the Bronx (1993-2001), winning four World Series with the Yankees (1996, ‘98-2000) and appearing in a fifth (2001). He concluded his Yankees career with a .303 batting average, 304 doubles, 185 home runs, 858 runs batted in, a .377 on-base percentage and an .869 OPS, claiming the American League batting title in 1994 with a .359 average. Additionally, he was a four-time All-Star with the Yankees (1994-95, ‘97-98).

Affectionately referred to as “The Warrior” by fans and known for his powerful throwing arm, the left-handed-hitting O’Neill played in 235 consecutive games in right field without making an error from July 1995 to May 1997. In 2001, he became the first 38-year-old in Major League history to steal 20 bases and hit 20 home runs in the same season — a mark later equaled by Gary Sheffield in 2007.
