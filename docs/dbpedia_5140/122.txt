The New York Yankees will retire Derek Jeter’s No. 2 jersey on Sunday — Mother’s Day — at Yankee Stadium, as a thank you to their iconic shortstop.

With the respect obviously being reciprocal, Jeter wanted to convey a big thank you to the Big Apple ahead of the ceremony, in which the team will unveil his monument plaque. He did so in the form of a letter on the Players' Tribune on Thursday, as well as a heartfelt video of New Yorkers reading that letter.

In the letter, Jeter credited New York for shaping him as a player and a man — from a kid from Kalamazoo, Mich., “who was just trying to keep up with everyone else.”

He wrote: “Thank you, New York, for asking a lot of me. For challenging me. For giving this kid a place to grow up. I wasn’t born a New Yorker — you asked me to earn it. I wasn’t born a Yankee, but you made me into one.

“In those difficult moments — those moments that feel unique to New York — you always showed me a sign.”

Jeter’s jersey will be retired at a pregame ceremony ahead of the Yankees’ game against the Houston Astros on Sunday (6:38 p.m. ET, ESPN). He will become the 22nd player in franchise history to have his number retired, and the first since teammates Bernie Williams, Jorge Posada and Andy Pettitte each had their number retired during the 2015 season.
