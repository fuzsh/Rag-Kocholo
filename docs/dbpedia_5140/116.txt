As the New York Yankees prepare to retire #2 in honor of Derek Jeter, the story of Yankee uniform numbers takes center stage in the Bronx as all single digit numbers, with the exception of #0 which has never been worn by any Yankees. Jeter’s number is the 21st different number retired by the Bronx Bombers with #8 and #42 being honored for multiple players.

The Yankees were the first team to regularly wear uniform numbers, debuting them in 1929, with players assigned number according to their position in the regular batting order. Despite being the first team to have numbers on a regular basis, the Yankees have never had the name on the back of their jerseys, making them the only team in the four major leagues to never wear their names on the back of their uniform. Some teams like the Boston Red Sox don’t wear names on their home jerseys, but wear them on the road.

#4 Lou Gehrig retired July 4, 1939

The first number, retired in baseball was that of Lou Gehrig, who was forced to retire after his 2,130-consecutive game streak came to an end, due to his diagnosis with amyotrophic laterals sclerosis (ALS) also called Lou Gehrig’s disease. Gehrig’s number was retired at the same ceremony where he gave his famous “Luckiest Man” speech. Lou Gehrig is the only player to wear the number 4 with the Yankees.

#3 Babe Ruth retired June 13, 1948

Like Lou Gehrig, Babe Ruth got his number due to his position in the batting order. Despite Ruth’s notoriety the Yankees did not retire #3 until 1948, more than a decade after the Sultan of Swat retired. The Yankees had seven players wear #3 between 1935-1948, with Cliff Mapes being the final player to wear the number. (More on Mapes later) Babe Ruth’s number was retired just two months before his death, with many of his former teammates on hand. That occasion would lead to a new tradition at Yankees Stadium, as it was also the first “Old Timer’s Day” as they celebrated the 25th Anniversary of Yankee Stadium also called “the House Babe Ruth Built” in the Bronx.

#5 Joe DiMaggio retired April 18, 1952

The New York Yankees did not wait to retire #5 before the home opener in 1952, the year after he retired. A little-known fact is that Joe DiMaggio did not always wear number #5 for the Yankees. In his rookie season, the Yankee Clipper wore #9, as Frank Crosetti was wearing #5 in 1936. In another #5 oddity, the Yankees issued #5 to Nick Etten from 1943-1945, while DiMaggio was enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force, where he served as a Physical Education instructor during World War II.

#7 Mickey Mantle retired June 8, 1969

One of the reasons for Joe DiMaggio’s retirement following the 1951 World Series, was an up and coming Centerfielder who was about to become the matinee idol of all Baby Boomers and the first superstar in the card collecting era. Like DiMaggio, the Yankees quickly acted to retired #7 for Mickey Mantle drawing a crowd of 60,096 in an era in which the Bronx Bombers were in decline and struggling at the gate. Like Joe DiMaggio, Mantle had a different number when he first came up, wearing #6 when he first came up in 1951. However, after Bobby Brown returned from military service, the Brown reclaimed his number and Mantle took #7. The last players before Mickey Mantle to wear #7 was Cliff Mapes, who took #7 after he gave up #3 for Babe Ruth’s retirement ceremony in 1948.

#37 Casey Stengel retired August 8, 1970

The Yankees honored #37 for longtime Manager Case Stengel in 1970, a decade after he was fired following the 1960 World Series. Stengel who later went on to manage the New York Mets in their early days is the only person to have his number honored by both of New York teams (other than Jackie Robinson who is honored throughout baseball). Stengel is one of just three men to wear #37 after Gus Niarhos and Herb Karel for in the Yankees as the number was not very popular.

#8 Yogi Berra and Bill Dickey retired July 22, 1972

The Yankees went two for one when they retired #8 in honor of legendary catchers Bill Dickey and Yogi Berra, both of whom are considered among the greatest catchers of all-time. Dickey first wore #10 as he was not part of the regular lineup in 1929, but after becoming the starting catcher wore #8 the rest of his career. In between Dickey’s final season in 1943 and Yogi taking over #8 a pair of players wore the number, with Yogi Berra first wearing #35 made he made his debut. The Yankees had waited until Yogi Berra was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame to double honor #8.

#16 Whitey Ford retired August 3, 1974

Like other players before him Whitey Ford did not always wear #16 with the Yankees, as he had previously used #18 and #19. However, once he took over #16 it was his number alone. The Yankees, however waited until Ford was elected to the Hall of Fame before deciding to honor his number. This made the retirement ceremony for Whitey Ford to be the oddest of all numbers retired by the Yankees, as the ceremony in the summer of 1974 was held at Shea Stadium as the Yankee Stadium was undergoing a massive two-year renovation. Prior to Ford, #16 was worn by 13 other players, most of whom were also pitchers.

#15 Thurman Munson retired August 3, 1979

Tragedy led to the next number to be retired by the New York Yankees, as #15 was hung up for good a day after Thurman Munson, the Yankees Captain was killed in a plane crash. Munson wore #15 for his entire career, taking over the number that had been worn for nine seasons by Tom Tresh. Before Munson and Tresh, number 15 had been a popular choice for some key players including Hall of Fame Pitcher Red Ruffing who used the number from 1932-1942.

#32 Elston Howard retired July 21, 1984

The Yankees posthumously honored Elston Howard at Old Timer’s Day in 1984, the decision to retire #32 was announced earlier in the season, with members of Howard’s family on hand. Elston Howard was the first African American to play for the Yankees, making his debut in 1955 and wearing #32 his entire career and when he later became a coach for the Yankees. Sadly, Elston Howard died due to heart disease in the winter of 1980. Prior to Howard the most notable Yankee with the #32 was longtime backup Catcher Ralph Houk.

#9 Roger Maris retired July 21, 1984

On the same day, the Yankees retired #32 in honor of Elston Howard, they surprised Roger Maris by retiring #9. Maris who set the single season record with 61 home runs in 1961 did not enjoy his time in New York as fans and the media were tough on the Roger Maris, who was not seen as a true Yankee after being acquired from the Kansas City Athletics. However, after two decades fans began to appreciate Maris, and the feeling was mutual. The Yankees had to wait to retire #9 as it was worn from 1973-1983 by longtime third baseman Craig Nettles who some believe should also be honored by the Yankees. Prior to Maris the most famous #9 for the Bronx Bombers was Hank Bauer, with Joe DiMaggio also using #9 in his rookie season.

#10 Phil Rizzuto retired August 4, 1985

The Yankees pulled out all the stops when the retired the Scooter’s number 10 in 1985, bring a cow with a halo on the field. The cow of course knocked Rizzuto over, adding some comedy to their longtime announcer’s ceremony. Before joining the booth, Phil Rizzuto was a hustling shortstop who won the 1950 American League MVP and was considered one of the best bunters in the game. The #10 was regularly used before Rizzuto arrived and after he retired in 1956. Among the notable players, it was used by Tony Kubek (1958-1965), Chris Chambliss (1974-1979) and Rick Cerone (1980-1984) before finally being honored in 1985. The game that followed would be remembered as they day Tom Seaver won his 300th game with the Chicago White Sox.

#1 Billy Martin retired August 10, 1986

One of the most star-crossed careers for the New York Yankees was Billy Martin, who was a brawling middle infielder who became popular with teammates and fans for his hardnosed style of play. After being traded following a much-publicized brawl at the Copacabana in 1957, Martin became manager of the Yankees during the tumultuous 70’s. While constantly fighting with Owner George Steinbrenner, Martin led the Yankees to two World Series in 1976 and 1977, winning the Fall Classic in 1977. After resigning in 1978, Martin returned in 1979 and began a series of strange managerial tenures that would continue for the next decade. The Yankees retired #1 after his fourth term of manager in 1985, and before his fifth and final tenure in 1988. Sadly, Billy Martin would be killed in a Christmas Day car accident in 1989, as rumors of a sixth term as rumors of a sixth tenure were being discussed. Among the other notable Yankees to wear #1 include 1960 World Series MVP Bobby Richardson, and longtime fan favorite Bobby Murcer in his first Yankees tenure.

#44 Reggie Jackson retired August 14, 1993

One of the more controversial numbers retired by the Yankees is the #44 honored for Reggie Jackson. Mr. October only played in the Bronx for five seasons, though they were the most successful and eventual five years in the history of the Yankees. Reggie Jackson led the Yankees to four division titles, three pennants and two World Championships, highlighted by his three home run game in the 1977 World Series. Reggie Jackson was among the first big money free agents and had some of his better seasons with the Oakland Athletics. It is believed, the Yankees got Reggie Jackson to wear a Yankee hat on his Hall of Fame plaque by promising to retire #44. Prior to Reggie, the number had been worn sporadically by a group of relatively unknown players over the years in the Bronx.

#23 Don Mattingly retired by August 31, 1997

No Yankee was more popular than Don Mattingly, who became team captain and the face of the franchise during the 1980’s. Mattingly had the misfortune of playing for the Yankees during a dry spell in which they went 14 years without a playoff appearance. By the time his career was finished following the 1995 ALDS his career was impacted by a bad back which short circuited what likely would have been a Hall of Fame career as he was one of baseball’s best pure hitters between 1984-1988. A year after his departure the Yankees would begin their latest dynasty with the arrival of Derek Jeter and the core four. In his early days with the Yankees, Mattingly wore #46, as #23 was being used by Barry Foote. The number who was the last of a long line of players to wear the number.

#49 Ron Guidry retired August 23, 2003

The Yankees retired Ron Guidry’s #49 more than a decade after he threw his final pitch. The star of the 1978 season, was one of the Yankees best pitchers for a decade before blowing out his arm in 1988. Over a 14-year career, the Gator won 170 games, winning a Cy Young and two ERA titles. When Ron Guidry made his debut in 1975, he wore #54, while the #49 was briefly issued to Jeff Johnson in 1992. Prior to Guidry’s arrival the number was used sporadically without distinction.

#42 retied across Major League Baseball for Jackie Robinson on April 15, 1997

#42 Mariano Rivera retired September 22, 2013

When Major League Baseball retired #42 in honor of Jackie Robinson’s 50th anniversary of breaking the color barrier, Mariano Rivera was one of nine players who were grandfathered and allowed to keep the number. It was the same season Rivera took over as Yankees closer following the departure of John Wetteland. When Rivera retired in 2013, he was the final player in the majors wearing #42, and bring the number great distinction. Over the 16 years he served as closer for the Yankees, Mariano Rivera set many records including career saves with 652 and is considered widely to be the best reliever of all time. The Yankees retired #42 for Rivera prior to Rivera’s final home game. Prior to Mariano Rivera, the #42 was most notably worn by utility infielder and longtime San Diego Padres announcer Jerry Coleman.

#6 Joe Torre retired August 23, 2014

When he was first hired by to manage the New York Yankees for the 1996 season, the New York tabloids called him “Clueless Joe” ripping the decision. When he was fired a decade later, Joe Torre was fondly remembered as one of the greatest leaders in the history of the Yankees, taking them to the playoffs all 12 seasons at the helm, with six pennants and four World Championships. The Yankees would retire Torre’s #6 a season after he was inducted into the Hall of Fame as Manager with the interlocking NY on his plaque. Before Joe Torre, #6 was commonly issued, with several notably Yankees wearing it including Hall of Famer Tony Lazzeri, who was the first to use the number. The number was also worn by 1942 AL MVP Joe Gordon, former AL President Bobby Brown, Mickey Mantle in his rookie season, Clete Boyer, longtime fan favorite Roy White, Steve Sax, and was last used by Tony Fernandez prior to Joe Torre’s tenure.

#51 Bernie Williams retired May 24, 2015

Throughout his 16-year Yankees career Bernie Williams carried himself with a quiet dignity. Of the new blood to come up from the minors, Bernie Williams was the first to arrive in 1991, when the Yankees were still suffering through their dark days. Williams was tormented in his early days by Mel Hall and some called for him to be traded when he struggled early in his career. However, the Yankees showing new patience they were able to develop into a homegrown dynasty. While not considered a member of the core four, Bernie Williams was just as important. The #51 was chosen by Bernie Williams as a tribute to his native Puerto Rico, considered unofficially the 51st state. Williams who always joked he was not retired finally had his number honored in 2015 nine years after his final game.

#20 Jorge Posada retired August 22, 2015

The second of the core four to have his number retired, following Mariano Rivera, Jorge Posada was honored as part of a special weekend of ceremonies that also honored Andy Pettitte. Posada a five-time All-Star spent his entire 17-year career with the Yankees, finally settling on #20 after briefly wearing #62, #41, #55, and #22 in earlier call ups. Among the 35 players to use #20 before Posada the most notable players include Bucky F. Dent, whose home run in the 1978 one game playoff against the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park made him a Yankee hero. The final player to wear #20 was Mike Stanley who also played catcher.

#46 Andy Pettitte retired August 23, 2015

The Yankees retired Andy Pettitte’s number a day after Posada’s ceremony. Pettitte spent 15 seasons, with the Yankees and was the rock of their rotation during their five most recent World Championships. Despite leaving for a brief three-year stint with his hometown Houston Astros, Pettitte was considered part of the core four, winning 219 games in 15 seasons in pinstripes. He was also a clutch performer in October, winning 19 postseason games with the Yankees. Ironically during his three year stay in Houston, the Yankees were quick to reissue #46 as five different players wore it in three seasons. The number 46 was worn by Don Mattingly in his rookie season, and the infamous Ken Phelps.

#2 Derek Jeter retired May 14, 2017

Over the last 20 years nobody was more the face of Yankees than Derek Jeter who was the team’s longest serving captain and leads the team in all-time hits. When his number is retired tonight it will be the 22nd most among all professional sports teams. Before Derek Jeter made #2 his own the number was used by players like Red Rolfe, Paul Blair and Bobby Murcer in his second tenure with the Yankees. The final Yankee to wear #2 before Jeter was Mike Gallego from 1992-1994.
