My name is on the spine, but it has been authored just as much by those who have suffered through and enjoyed the listening/writing process with me. This process began for my family and me on December 25, 2008, when we landed, so to speak, in the United States. Suffered is perhaps not the most precise term, but I will use it here as a kind of placeholder for something deeply felt but perhaps less melodramatic in nature. It is no stretch to say that this book began with an act of sacrifice for me and those closest to me: to leave one’s home and language is a rupture, and it requires one to undergo a sometimes painful (and always awkward) second birth in another language and place. Listening, I discovered over the process of writing this book, is inseparable from birth and death. The present book is the result of many experiences of hearing and mishearing, of listening and misunderstanding, of being lost in translation and found anew in unforeseen transcreations. It is also the result of a focused taking-into-account of the subtle nuances that occur between, below, and above languages (and other meaningful sounds) and that continually shape people’s diverse ways of being, communicating, and quite literally making sense. I indexed my dislocation from Brazil to the United States in my first book, Maranhão-Manhattan (2009), through the hyphen, which acts as a bridge and a passage not only from one word to the next, but also from the Global South to the North. From the first moment of my arrival, I began to inhabit a foreign country and a distant hemisphere; I swapped the Southern Cross for Ursa Major, and my home became a place to be missed, far away in a South that gradually became my new North. I also discovered through this process that one indeed must leave Brazil to\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\nre-encounter it (a recurrent topic in Brazilian literature and history). There is no fixed itinerary, but there are key signposts and stopovers: Latin America, Latinx/Chicanx culture, African American culture, the Pacific Rim, the United States and Canada in all their wild and diverse immensity. In the end, one comes to imagine or envision an America prior to continental or national divisions: Amerindian, Asian, and beyond, all echoing through these spaces and our time. English, it must be said, is not my language. In producing and listening to a foreign tongue, I began to notice the vast canyons of echoing difference between English and my native Portuguese. Here it is not so much the meaning of words alone that matters. The problem is muscular and sensory, manifesting itself in the way in which one has to move one’s tongue so as to enunciate certain phonemes or difficult consonantal clusters. An example (one that became a favourite for my Brazilian-born but American-educated kids) is the English word world – it remains for me a word-world that my tongue refuses to circumnavigate. Like Fernão de Magalhães before me, I come up short (so my kids tell me), ending my word-journey on some tropical island, far from home, shipwrecked. There are also advantages if one wishes to remain attentive to them. The nearly constant presence of English in my ears has made me notice a certain singularity present in works written in Brazilian Portuguese, a production that revolves around a particular listening stance. This observation, for which I at first had no words or means of formal expression, serves to explain my excitement upon rediscovering – in the spring of 2010, and in the context of a course I was then offering – the following passage from Clarice Lispector’s final novel, The Hour of the Star: “The question is: how do I write? I can verify that I write by ear, just as I learned English and French by ear.” Since its first inscription, writing by ear thus finds itself connected to the presence of multiple languages and soundscapes, a sonorous world (that word again) that informs and makes possible a certain writing practice based primarily on acoustics and listening. Looking back, it becomes clear to me that I lived my arrival in North America nearly a decade ago as a double movement. Moving in one direction (the Portuguese word sentido is closer to what I mean, and I strain not to reach for it), I found myself immersed in a foreign soundscape, one that has often been characterized more by inexplicable silences than by sound itself. At the same time, I had been invited to the United States to teach and reflect on literature and cultural expression in my own\n\nPreface xiii\n\nlanguage, to contemplate and somehow live Brazil from my new, Northern Californian circumstances. By interacting in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, and all held in place by unmistakably Anglo-Saxon notions of decorum, I was born again as a listener. The result of this prolonged escuta is a study that operates at and attempts to map the intersection (that hyphen), where writing meets the ear and the ear meets writing.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nDá-me tua mão Lispector, A Paixão Segundo G.H.\n\nThis book would never have emerged from its amorphous state of seemingly endless listening had it not been for the help of colleagues and students who lent me their own writing ears. Vincent Barletta, in this respect, was more than an interlocutor and translator; he was in a strict sense a poetic transcreator of this book, a brother-in-ears who generously lent his impeccable English to the project and helped me to find the manuscript’s final rhythm, including the translation of citations from the original Portuguese. The corpus of secondary literature on Clarice Lispector is, to put it mildly, intense and extensive, and very little of this material (and, unfortunately, much Portuguese-language literary theory and criticism in general) is available in English translation. Of the many poetic solutions that Vincent found, I would like to cite his rendering of Oswald de Andrade’s early statement on writing by ear: “A gente escreve o que ouve, nunca o que houve” (“We write what we hear, not what was here”). This is writing by ear at its purest, most essential level. One of the many gifts that my move to California brought me was my new brother; and brothers offer their hands. Other co-translating hands participated in this project from its inception. The first among these to offer her assistance was Karen Sherwood Sotelino, an expert translator of Machado de Assis, Raul Brandão, and Raduan Nassar. Helga Wild also helped immensely with the early stages of the writing process. Jamile Pinheiro Dias was from the first a dream collaborator, a marvellous co-editor, and my Amazonian sister. Adam\n\nxvi\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nMorris and Rachel Lee likewise lent their insights at different moments of the project. The manuscript revision process drew much from the valuable collaboration of Thales Augusto Barretto de Castro and Tom Winterbottom, whom I thank with all my heart. I also owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the many students (both undergraduate and graduate) who worked with me over the past eight years. Atticus Bergman, Robert Casas Roigé, and Christopher Kark participated actively in the fleshing-out of my initial idea, as well as with my readings of Georges Bataille and Clarice. Victória Troianowski Saramago (a Vic) was involved in the writing process with her sweet presence and attentive reading while she was a PhD student at Stanford and after beginning her professorial career. Ami Schiess offered her generous listening while translating and studying Cobra Norato. I cannot hope to list the names of all the students who helped me with their questions, their own research, and their attention, so I present here a sample to stand in for the whole: Gabriela Andicoechea Fischmann, Gabriela Badica, Mackenzie Barnes, Miguel Bota Burgués, Alessandra Carneiro, Cynthia Casas, Anna Castillo, Caroline Egan, Serena Ferrando, Cuauhtémoc GarcíaGarcía, Samuel Blue Gibson, Mariana de Heredia, Daniel Hernández, Sebastião Macedo, Alexis Marie Pearce, Juan Esteban Plaza Parrochia, Virginia Ramos, Luis Rodríguez-Rincón, Sarah Sadlier, Fatoumata Seck, Lena Tahmassian, Kiah Thorn, Cristóbal Trujillo, Monica VanBladel, Callie Elizabeth Ward, and André Zollinger, among others. More recently, the arrival of Bruno H. Castro brought new energy to the project, along with unforeseen cinematic and auditory connections. This book also belongs to the wonderful students from UC Berkeley who regularly made the hour-long trip to Stanford to attend my seminars. Ashley Brock, Alexandra Gila Brostoff, Nathalia Saliba, and Yael Segalovitz help fashion a literal bridge for thought. Thanks to Segalovitz’s excellent dissertation project on Hebrew and Brazilian literature, I was also able to have very productive interactions with Berkeley professors Judith Butler, Dorothy J. Hale, and Chana Kronfeld. Natalia Brizuela and Candace Slater were also a consistently friendly source of interaction and dialogue during the writing of this book. Special thanks are due to my many colleagues and friends at Stanford University. A special thanks to Joan Ramon Resina, whose work to expand our field has been so inspiring to my academic life. A special thanks also to Gabriella Safran, whose questions, listening, and reading contributed to the revision of my text, for her continuous support. The instructors\n\nAcknowledgments xvii\n\nin the Portuguese language program at Stanford, above all Lyris Wiedemann, were likewise a source of constant enthusiasm and companionship. I also benefited tremendously from readings and discussions associated with two research groups: “Sense and Sound” (co-directed with Vincent Barletta) and “Materia: Latin American and Comparative PostAnthropocentrisms” (directed by my dear colleagues Héctor Hoyos and Ximena Briceño). I am especially indebted to the department’s kind and insightful staff. Substantial parts of Writing by Ear were written during my time as a faculty fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center (2013–14). This fellowship offered me time, space, and an interdisciplinary conviviality that were fundamental to advance my research. This year was and will remain a dream that came true. I remember with joy all the lunches we shared together and the animated conversations with Lilla Balint, Daniel Heller, Dorinne Kondo, Yi-Ping Ong (and her Art of Being), Benjamin Paloff, Ugur Pece, Jean Petitot, and Daniel Rosenberg, among all the other fellows. My special gratitude goes to Robert Barrick, Roland Hsu, Patricia Terrazas, and Caroline Winterer. Thanks also to Rania Sanford, for always finding me a place at the Faculty Writers’ Retreat, an excellent initiative co-hosted by the Hume Center for Writing and Speaking and the Office of the Vice Provost for Faculty Development and Diversity. Stanford’s Center for Latin American Studies, the lovely Casa Bolívar, quickly became my second home, and I have no words to express how much I have learned from its conferences, invited speakers, and weekly events with visiting and Stanford professors. It was my honour to advise the wonderful and supremely intelligent students in their MA program. Thanks to Alberto Diaz-Cayeros, Rodolfo Dirzo, Herbert S. Klein, and Elizabeth Saenz-Ackermann, and all the Center’s staff members, including Jessica Barajas, Angela Doria-La, and Laura Quirarte, for this space of warmth and solidarity. Finally, I wish to thank my colleague Beatriz Magaloni, who shared with me the bright hope for Brazil’s future through two of her wonderful students and research assistants, Veriene Melo and Vanessa Mello. Their intelligence, beauty, and perseverance were always inspiring. This book has benefited tremendously from dialogues with colleagues and through events such as “Writing/Listening,” with James Clifford, Steven Feld, Paul Robinson, and Miyaki Inoue at the Stanford Humanities Center; the Stanford Working Group on the Novel, with Roland Greene;\n\nxviii\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nand the Philosophical Reading Group, with Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht and Robert Pogue Harrison. Thanks to Michael Taussig for having accepted my invitation to come to Stanford to talk of “humming.” Preliminary versions of this book were presented at the conventions of the Modern Language Association, the American Comparative Literature Association, the American Portuguese Studies Association, BRASA, LASA, and ABRALIC. I’m thankful to the organizers who invited me to present my research: Eduardo Sterzi and Mario Santana, at Unicamp, my colleagues from “A Curva,” in Rio de Janeiro, Maria de Fátima do Nascimento, Thomas Fairchild, and Mayara Ribeiro Guimarães at Universidade Federal do Pará, Adriana X. Jacobs and Claire Williams, at the University of Oxford, Susanne Klengel, at the Freie Universität of Berlin, Ana Paulina Lee, Ana Maria Ochoa, and Graciela Montaldo at Columbia University, and Piero Scaruffi, director of the Leonardo Art Science Evenings (LASERs). Luciana Namorato, Estela Vieira, and Kathryn BishopSánchez allowed me to test my hypotheses with specialists on Machado de Assis at Indiana University. I am also grateful to Christopher T. Lewis, Rex Nielson, James Krause, and their enviable numbers of Portuguese students at the University of Utah and Brigham Young University. At the University of Chicago, with Dain Borges, Victoria Saramago, Lúcia Sá, Gabriel Giorgi, and others, I was also able to share my work on Echopoetics in a bracing debate on Post-Humanism. I owe a warm welcome and expression of friendship to Pedro Meira Monteiro, who has helped me to navigate my North American exile through his intellectual work and personal delicadeza. He and many members of the American Portuguese Studies Association (APSA) have become my academic faculty family over the past years. I do not have the space here to thank all of them, but I cannot but express my gratitude to Luiz Fernando Valente, who first received me at the association. At the risk of failing to mention some names, my thanks go out to many friends and colleagues: Severino Albuquerque, Vivaldo Andrade dos Santos, Fernando Arenas, Rebecca Atencio, Idelber Avelar, Sophia Beal, Leopoldo Bernucci, Kátia Bezerra, Paulo Blikstein, Dain Borges, Cesar Braga-Pinto, Bruno Carvalho, Alfredo César Melo, Odile Cisneros, Kimberley da Costa-Holton, Paul Dixon, Katrina Dodson, Christopher Dunn, Rubén Gallo, Nicola Gavioli, Adam Joseph Shellhorse, Marguerite Harrison, Janet Hendrickson, Victor K.

The opportunity to meet and receive feedback from Earl E. Fitz and Marta Peixoto is a gift that I will carry forever. I have also learned so much from my dear friends in Italy, Ettore Finazzi-Agrò and Luca Bacchini. In Portugal, Abel Barros Baptista, Carlos Mendes de Sousa, and Clara Rowland have been a constant presence in my writing and teaching. In Brazil, I am thankful for the reception that my work has received from faculty and students at the Núcleo Diversitas at the University of São Paulo (USP). My colleagues from the Faculdade de Filosofia, Letras e Ciência Humanas at USP, Álvaro Faleiros and Roberto Zular, are as always friends in my travels, thoughts, and words. For different moments of dialogue, my thanks go to Dau Bastos, Vagner Camilo, Alessandra Carneiro, João Cezar de Castro Rocha, Sueli Cavendish, Regina Dalcastagné, Jaime Ginzburg, Hélio Guimarães, André Goldfeder, Lucia Helena, Marcelo Jasmin, José Luís Jobim, Stélio Marras, Pedro Mandagará, Anita Moraes, Marcello Moreira, Anderson Luís Nunes da Mata, Fernando Paixão, Godofredo de Oliveira Neto, Anélia Pietrani, Lúcia Ricotta, Eliane Robert Moraes, Yudith Rosenbaun, Marta de Senna, Deonísio da Silva, Lynn Mario de Souza, Leopoldo Waizbort, and Tazio Zambi. Thanks to the organizers of “Variações do Corpo Selvagem” in São Paulo, I was able to discuss my work on echopoetics with Cecilia Cavalieri, Flavia Cêra, Déborah Danowski, Pedro de Niemeyer Cesarino, Alexandre Nodari, João Camillo Penna, Eduardo Sterzi, Tania Stolze Lima, Roberto Taddei, André Vallias, Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, and José Miguel Wisnik. The research group “Performar a Literatura” expanded this discussion in our meetings in Rio and Curitiba. On this last occasion, one of the most beautiful moments of my research process came through a question and comment by Camila de Caux and our subsequent conversation on the listening subtleties of deafness, and her plans for an ethnography of the ear. Thank you, Frederico Coelho, for your questions and for your brilliant article, “Por uma escuta fabuladora.” I also offer my most sincere thanks to my editor at the University of Toronto Press, Mark Thompson. He and the editorial board at UTP expressed immediate and unflagging enthusiasm for this project, and this did much to keep me writing. Lisa Jemison and Judith Williams provided fundamental support in the final revision of the manuscript. I would also like to thank the press’s anonymous readers, whose valuable\n\nxx\n\nAcknowledgments\n\ncomments have unquestionably made this book better than it would have been otherwise. I have done my utmost to include their suggestions, and any weaknesses that remain are solely my own. This book would not have been possible without the enormous help given to me to gain permission to reproduce copyrighted material. My warm thanks to Clarice’s son, Paulo Gurgel Valente, for his immediate answer, and to Ana Paz at the Carmen Balcells literary agency, Benjamin Moser and Christopher Wait at New Directions, Foichl Miah at Carcanet Press, and Augusto de Campos, Ivan Pérsio de Arruda Campos, Marepe, Alice Ruiz, Diemut Strebe, and Luisa Strina for allowing me to use their work. My special thanks to Alessandra Santos and Jason Stanyek, editors of the special issue of Critical Studies in Improvisation, “Brazilian Improvisations,” where I published my first article on “Writing by Ear” in 2011, translated by Camille Sutton. Thanks to Niklas Damiris for our many conversations, and for a wonderful Mother’s Day brunch. Thanks also to my Stanford colleague Russell Berman for his solidarity, support, and friendship. To my teachers, João Adolfo Hansen and Luiz Costa Lima, I can only offer the most sincere and warm expression of my never-ending gratitude. Thanks also to Jacob Pinheiro Goldberg, for being always there for us. I’m grateful to Mariah Portugal and her invention of “Livrofonia,” and to Arrigo Barnabé, and his “Supertônica” radio program, for our conversations. I am ever grateful to Ewa Domanska and Pola Oloixarac for their stimulating comments and their love for las teorías salvajes. My friends, las chicas poderosas, Claudia Quiroga, Elizabeth Sáenz-Ackerman, Teresa Bousa, and Rachel Dickins, are everywhere within this book: the writing plans with Claudia, Saturdays with Elizabeth, the many walks with Teresa, Rachel’s stories … Yes, we did it! The “Friday Pagode” at Kit Miller’s house, with Eugenia, Eric, Diana, Megha, and Mestre Beiçola (among many others), provided the music that rocked this book. Thanks to them, I discovered I can sing. My fond recognition to the authors and translators who expressed to me their own “writing by ear”: Júlia de Carvalho Hansen, João Paulo Cuenca, Ana Miranda, Nuno Ramos, and Veronica Stigger. My thanks also to my very personal friends from Brazil and California: Inês Cardoso, Eliane Cavalleiro, Isabel de Lorenzo, Maitê Filizola, Luciana Gama (a Shlo), Rachel Gutiérrez, Paul Little, Chung Liu, Beta Macedo, Nadejda Marques, Renata Martino, Júlio Minoz, Carolina Moraes-Liu, Adega Olmos, Gheu Sousa Teixeira, Nikko S. da Paz, Thaicia Stona, Guga Stroeter, and Denise Zmekhol.\n\nAcknowledgments xxi\n\nChapter 4, which connects the work of Clarice Lispector with that of Vincent van Gogh, is dedicated to Pascal Rochette, whose paintings listen to and reforest the world. Thanks to him for everything and for all time. My thanks to Gabriel, my son, for the many years of patience and for his keen sense of humour. When I began writing this book, you were four years old, and now, as I finish it, you are eleven and already taller than me. Thanks also to Alice, my daughter, for her beauty and her youthful wisdom, which is much like that of her grandmother. A sincere thanks to my father, Louremberg Nunes Rocha, and to my sisters, Anasha, Fernanda, and Loureana. And also to my US family: Evan, Eleanor, Karen Wigen, and Martin Lewis. Gabriel’s friends, Sam, Sophia, Ashvin, and Richie, brought enormous joy to so many California days with their playdates and sleepovers. In Brazil, Pedro and Mel joined the group. Sérgio Bairon was there when the writing of this book was at its most difficult, softening those moments of doubt and confusion and resolving them with his ear, his soul, and his voice. Gratitude, and love.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nNote on Copyright and Translations\n\nExtracts from the published books by Clarice Lispector in Portuguese and images of her paintings are reproduced by kind permission of Agencia Literaria Carmen Balcells.

(… deepening what there was in her of sweetness and listening – for this was her nature.) Lispector, A cidade sitiada\n\nIf we listen closely, we can hear the pulse of a uniquely auditory mode of writing in the work of several authors of the modern period, and specifically at the heart of Brazilian literature. In the present book, I examine the broader significance of the explicit articulation of a writing by ear found in the work of Brazilian novelist Clarice Lispector (1920–77). If listening, and audition more generally, can be examined within fields as diverse as ethics, law, medicine, physiology, anthropology, folklore studies, philosophy, politics, rhetoric, music, and psychoanalysis, I argue in this study that there is a listening in writing. What it implies, first of all, is a mode of writing that has as its foundational image the “orelha à escuta, grande, cor-de-rosa e morta” (“ear listening, large, pink and dead”) that appears at the beginning of Lispector’s first novel, Near to the Wild Heart, published in 1943 (13; 3).1 This image would return only slightly altered in the final novel she published in her lifetime, The Hour of the Star (1977), in the guise of a male narrator, who quite perfunctorily claims: “escrevo de ouvido” (“I write by ear”) (18; 10). This is an idea that suggests a reframing of authorship as a form of active and fertile aural reception. It also recasts the written text as a mute sign that nonetheless resonates and echoes within the mind (and body) of the reader. Throughout this\n\n6\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nbook, I read Lispector’s ear, “dead” and separate from any body and yet active and listening, as a figurative and eminently modern theory of writing. My goal is to come to an adequately theorized understanding of what it means to “write by ear,” and how such resonance, fashioned in the silence of writing (and reading) fiction, comes to have its power and produce its effects. Lispector is a point of departure insofar as she persistently proposed throughout her career a conceptualization of writing by ear and opened a path for such writing and analysis, which finds representation in the work of other writers, both within and beyond Brazil. I argue that Lispector’s “ear” is connected to her experience with a range of languages (e.g., Brazilian Portuguese, English, French, Hebrew, and Yiddish). This ear also situates us within a third space beyond the traditional binaries of speech/writing, orality/literacy, activity/passivity, and sound/silence. Such a stance has far-reaching implications in Latin America and the Global South; however, it likewise matters a great deal for texts produced in a wide range of cultural settings and frameworks. Lispector was, after all, a writer deeply attuned to forms of listening and verbal/aesthetic practice in Brazil and in the world at large. It is this “listening-to” the world that ultimately constitutes the central focus of the present book. In what follows, I unpack the notion of listening in writing, an idea that I break down into three constituent parts or concepts: 1) writing by ear; 2) the aural novel; and 3) echopoetics. In addition, I offer a kind of précis of Lispector’s biography. Finally, I describe the structure of the book, its style, and its scope. Listening in Writing: Between Orality and Literacy For some time, historical, philosophical, literary, linguistic, and anthropological studies have discussed the relation between literacy and orality, above all in the context of Latin American literature. Important examples include the work of Angel Rama (1982; 1998), Antonio Cornejo Polar (1994), Carlos Pacheco (1992), and Martin Lienhard (1991), among others. These studies consistently call attention to the relation, at times conflictive and at times complimentary or even magnetic, between these two poles. In this line of research, the proposed divide between speech and writing amounts to a “rhetorical device” used not to inscribe an essentialized orality but to create an effect of orality that helps to displace the written system itself (Millay 2005, 19). In the end, it serves to contest the ideology and power attributed to literacy, and in this context,\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n7\n\nwriters effectively position themselves as cross-cultural mediators. In these foundational studies, one can say that the focus rests, above all, on the way in which European literary forms were adapted and transformed within the colonial and postcolonial context. Writing by Ear inserts itself into the tradition of these studies, but it proposes that critics include a third term between writing and orality: listening in writing. The presence of hearing/listening in writing calls on its readers to contemplate a sense that has been left largely (if paradoxically) unexplored in previous discussions on the relationship between orality and writing. It is my intention to show that the inclusion of the ear changes the panorama of the discussion. Despite the differences between speech and writing, both are manifestations of language. But what does it mean to think about the relationship between the ear and the process of writing? The ear does not produce language: the ear is mute, it does not speak, and it has no voice. Although it occupies a fundamental position in the cycle of spoken language, the ear is basically a receptive organ, the channel and the labyrinth through which the sounds of the outside world enter and communicate within our body. Unlike voice and writing, which produce speech and texts, listening is silent and receptive. From this receptivity, the following questions arise: What is the specific aesthetic for which listening in writing calls? What is the relation that listening in writing establishes with silence, echo, and the sounds of the world? How are we to understand authorship when writers present themselves as objects of reception rather than subjects of production? What is the relation that exists between the book – a mute text – and the verbal practice of the world that surrounds it? What is the relation between written literature in Brazil and the significant percentage of Brazil’s population that does not possess alphabetic literacy? In which ways does the robust oral and aural culture of Brazil shape literary genres and forms with unmistakably European roots? Throughout Writing by Ear, I am concerned at once with shedding light on the narrative representation of listening and with a broader reconceptualization of fiction through listening, considering it an auditory practice that transcends the dichotomy of speech and writing. The main point of the argument is that listening, as a third term, takes part in both poles: listening is part of the oral dimension of speech, and it is likewise part of the silent dimension of written words. Listening, as we will see (or hear), is not merely sonorous but is also steeped in silence. At first, one might think that the auditory question might just be another\n\n8\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nway of linking writing to orality, since audition would signify the audition of voices. Taking into account Lispector’s work, however, it becomes clear that theorizing the relation between listening and writing requires a differentiated approach: listening in writing necessarily refers not to audible sounds alone but to silence as well. This is not about an opposition between written silence and orality, or between text and speech, or between silence and sound; rather, it is the conjugation of these two moments – their friction. It is a writing by ear; that is, a text that is the result of the hearing of sounds that remain in writing, as silence. A Listening Literary Turn Writing by Ear approaches Lispector’s work through the notion of listening in writing. In this sense, this is not only a critical reading of Lispector’s work; my aim is rather to show readers how to use Lispector as a theoretical source capable of helping one to rethink fiction in general as an aural practice. For this reason, I make use of Lispector‘s fiction to theorize listening in writing through her own words, a fact that explains why direct quotations from her work form an important part of the main argumentation and of my close readings. What does it mean to write by ear? This is the question at the centre of the present book. To answer it, I undertake “a close listening” (Bernstein 1998) of Lispector’s voice as it emerges from the silence of her writing. In the interstices that lie between voice and silence, one finds listening: a place of speaking through mute silence, a place of writing through voice that allows one to hear silence, the final vibration of language. Lispector is at once a writer and the principal theorist of what she refers to as “writing by ear.” That this is a theory of language and literature authored by a woman adds to the feminist appeal of the present book. That Lispector is a writer working within the between-space of twentieth-century Rio de Janeiro and incorporates within herself a host of subjects – she is a Judeo-Brazilian woman born in the Ukraine, and from her position of unquestionable whiteness, she chooses to incorporate a Brazil that is at once black, Indigenous, Catholic, animist, umbandista, and formed through candomblé while also taking in the accents acquired during her long sojourns outside of Brazil – is what makes her writing so amply pluralist and multiversal. José Américo Mota Pessanha’s seminal 1965 study on The Passion According to G.H. provides an early signpost for the theoretical potential of Lispector’s work. As he puts it, her writing “has the iconoclastic force\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n9\n\nof philosophy’s beginning” (Pessanha 1965, 184). Pessanha also points out that Lispector’s fiction presents silence as a “source of language” (186). Benedito Nunes (1989), a central figure of Lispector scholarship, underscores the failure of language as a theme of her writing and points to the link she maintains with improvisational music and with “a kind of schizophrenic mode of writing” (68), both important aspects in a discussion of writing by ear, as I show over the course of the following chapters. Nevertheless, it is Plinio W. Prado Jr’s 1989 analysis of the “sublime failure” at the heart of Lispector’s fiction that indicates quite specifically the importance of listening for understanding her work: “To write, according to C.L., is first to listen, it implies an attempt to capture that which speaks by means of what is said” (Prado 1989, 26). This is a fundamentally important observation; however, Prado’s goal is not to theorize listening but rather to focus on what he refers to as the “unnamable.” This, he argues, is achieved through the failure of language, a “vertigo or defect” (26). As a text that acts through subtraction (and through amputation, as I discuss in chapter 4), the ineffable is expressed negatively, as if it were pronounced through mute silence. This formulation is crucial for the present book, which relates listening and writing through muteness and silence. Earl E. Fitz, a pioneer in Brazilian studies within the United States, has likewise pointed out the importance of silence in Lispector’s work and the development of the “lyrical novel,” a term that I adapt and refashion as the “aural novel.”2 Considering Lispector’s fiction as a case study and a source for theory, Writing by Ear presents a theory of the novel derived from listening and based on readings of Near to the Wild Heart (1943), The Besieged City (1949), The Passion According to G.H. (1964), Água Viva (1973), The Hour of the Star (1977), and A Breath of Life (1978), as well as the literary columns (crônicas) brought together in The Discovery of the World (1984). With the terms “writing by ear,” the “aural novel,” and “echopoetics,” my broader aim is to offer new vocabularies for the study of literature focused on the act of listening in writing. I am particularly interested in describing what I call the “aural novel,” which corresponds to a certain configuration that the novel has acquired in Brazil at least since the work of Machado de Assis in the late nineteenth century. I consider both “writing by ear” and the “aural novel” to be part of a broader poetics of listening that I refer to as “echopoetics.” “Echopoetics” is a term that refers to a poetics of resonances that considers the aesthetic, ethical, and ecological reverberations of the imaginary. It is through an echopoetics that we might begin to attend more\n\n10\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nadequately to the semantic spirit of words as echoes of the material presence of voices, rumours, and noises that surround writers in their time and life, and that resonate with each reader. A written text founded on listening is first a receiving text rather than a producing one. By “echopoetics,” I refer to such a receptive capacity as an unconditional openness to the outside, and as a result of being completely inside in the sense of belonging, of being part of something that can be the womb, the world, and/or the planet itself, as Lispector articulates it. Rather than a study of sound and sense (to recall José Miguel Wisnik’s magnificent 1989 book O Som e o sentido), the present book is an invitation to construct a relatively new field of study: the study of listening in writing. In dialogue with philosophical notions of listening articulated by Jean-Luc Nancy, Jean-François Lyotard, Peter Sloterdijk, Way Chee Dimock, and Adriana Cavarero, and in parallel to the field of sound studies, voice, and poetry (discussed in the works of Charles Bernstein (1998), Craig Dworkin (2011), and Antonio Sergio Bessa (2009), among others), this book can fairly be considered part of a “listening turn” in literary studies. This turn is close to what Ana María Ochoa Gautier describes in her study Aurality. Listening and Knowledge in Nineteenth-Century Colombia (2014): So what is happening when we talk about an “aural turn” is not necessarily that suddenly hearing has emerged on the scene today. As historians of sound increasingly show us, the archive tells us on the one hand, that many practices and disciplines central to modernity have to do with hearing and, on the other, that the history of globalization needs to take into account histories and understandings of listening that come from radically different regions, that point to different ontologies and politics of life and cannot be subsumed under the epistemic formations of Western modernity. Rather, what is crucial is that the changing relation between nature and culture regarding questions about hearing implies a reorganization of our own questions and disciplinary divisions around sound. (213)\n\nWhereas my focus is the ear and the literary text, the focus of Ochoa’s study is the relation between the ear and the voice, between practices of listening and vocalization, i.e., the acoustics involved in several practices (from popular music to Afro-descendant religions, from Indigenous sonorities to the “vocal pedagogy of the nation-state” [212]). In my case, the focus rests upon silence, muteness, resonances, and echoes.\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n11\n\nIf writing is silent, listening to what is written does not simply imply an ability that has to do with sound. In addition to the sounds of the world to which it points, there are sounds inside the reader’s mind, which emerge when we repeat the words we read in silence. Garret Stewart, in Reading Voices (1990), has shown the magic of this internal noise that so affects us at the embodied level in silent reading. Addressing the “reading body,” Stewart argues: “This somatic locus of soundless reception includes of course the brain but must be said to encompass as well the organs of vocal production, from diaphragm up through throat to tongue and palate. Silent reading locates itself, that is, in the conjoint cerebral activity and suppressed muscular action of a simultaneously summoned and silenced enunciation” (1). The practice of what Stewart defines as phonemic reading (processed in silence by the “listening reader” [278]) “has to do not with reading orally but with aural reading” (2). Aural reading resonates internally within our body, as the muted interior sound never fully ceases to be sound, even if it is never louder than the faintest whisper. Writing by ear involves these two dimensions: sound and silence. If on the one hand acoustics matters in this discussion, the presence of listening in writing involves hearing non-sonorous sounds – in other words, sounds that are not audible. We call them “silence” for lack of a better term, since we tend to think of silence as opposed to sound, even if we are aware that sound is audible, and silence vibrates. As Lispector herself has presented this idea, in her best-known novel, The Passion According to G.H.: “a respiração contínua do mundo é aquilo que ouvimos e chamamos de silêncio” (“the continual breathing of the world is what we hear and call silence”) (98; 99). This approach corresponds to one of the critical questions proposed by Jean-Luc Nancy (2007): “Is even listening itself sonorous?” (98). Not necessarily, as it turns out. Deafness, partial or not, is an important aspect to be considered in a theory of listening in writing. This is also a way to escape the fate of sound studies and its obliviousness to the “non-cochlear ear,” to call to mind Seth Kim-Cohen’s expression (2009). Kim-Cohen’s book distinguishes sonic art from music and the audible with the aim of conceptualizing non-sonorous sound in order to consider an expanded field of artistic experiments from the 1950s onward: “The expanded situation of sound is the idea that I have been trying to bring into play – … so that the implications of thinking soundbeyond-sound and/or sound-without-sound might take root” (xix). The sonic arts that Kim-Cohen studies are contemporary with Lispector’s first\n\n12\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nnovels: “Pierre Schaeffer’s initial experiments with musique concrète, John Cage’s first silent composition, and Muddy Waters’s pioneering electric recordings – all occurred in the same year: 1948” (xix).3 Visuality has until now received the lion’s share of the attention in critical works on Lispector written in Brazil and elsewhere. Among the studies focused on the eye and the poetics of seeing in Lispector, one might turn to the important readings of Wisnik (1988) and Regina Pontieri (1999). Carlos Mendes de Sousa’s 2012 study, based on the uses of the term “figural” (according Jean-François Lyotard’s definition), is also predominantly concerned with images, i.e., with vision but also with blindness. However, Sousa’s “figures” can be adapted to the notion of reverberation that I adopt in my own reading, as a study that follows the figurations of listening in Lispector’s writings. At the same time, it is important to state that a focus on listening does not mean any backgrounding of the sense of vision. In my own approach, I make ample use of the visual arts – especially painting and photography – to speak of sound art. By privileging a verbivocovisual approach to literary texts, I avoid the “audiovisual litany” (Sterne 2003, 15), i.e, the clear division between sound and sight as opposing poles (similar to the division between oral speech and written texts discussed above). In The Audible Past: Cultural Origins of Sound Reproduction, Sterne shows that sound, hearing, and listening are central aspects of modernity, but, similar to Nancy’s critique of the oculo-centric character of philosophy, Sterne signals the predominance of a visual terminology in the theoretical domain. If the culture of listening/hearing is predominant as the culture of seeing in modernity, philosophical knowledge is predominantly ocular. As Sterne has put it, there is “a disjuncture between the aurality of a practice and the ocularcentric language used to describe it” (12). In this way, a listening in writing (and its resonant silence, its mute shrieks, its vibrant muteness) is the central theme of the present book. For this reason, I focus on hearing and the ear as processual synonyms that constitute a third way beyond the conventional dichotomy between speech and writing. In fact, hearing produces an affinity between writing and orality, and it helps us to think of a new distribution and mobilization of the senses: listening in writing, visual audition, silent but resonant reading, mute but speaking writing, and so on. The result, I argue (following Lispector’s conception), is a writing by ear, with the novel as an eminently aural space and authorship as a locus of reception more than production.\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n13\n\nLispector’s Ears When most European readers still had little knowledge of Lispector’s work, Hélène Cixous would offer a series of startling comparisons: If Kafka had been a woman. If Rilke had been a Jewish Brazilian born in the Ukraine. If Rimbaud had been a mother, if he had reached the age of fifty. If Heidegger had been able to stop being German, if he had written the Romance of the Earth. Why have I cited these names? To try to sketch out the general vicinity. Over there is where Clarice Lispector writes. There, where the most demanding works breathe, she makes her way. (133)\n\nEven more suggestive than the genuine pathos and enthusiasm of this passage, however, is what Cixous affirms directly afterward: “But then, at the point where the philosopher gets winded, she goes on, further still, further than all knowledge. After comprehension, step by step, she plunges trembling into the incomprehensible shuddering depth of the world, the ultrasensitive ear, tensed to take in even the sound of the stars, even the minimal rubbing of atoms, even the silence between two heartbeats” (133, my emphasis). Cixous is here attuned, one might say, to Lispector’s writing; she echoes it and it resonates with her.4 And one should not lose sight of the fact that while she points to Lispector’s similarities to Kafka, Rilke, Rimbaud, and Heidegger, she also gestures to what is different in her work, a fiction that moves forward when philosophy falls silent to listen to that which exceeds reason’s grasp. Lispector’s “ultrasensitive ear” is the most precise unit of analysis within the present book. It is through this ear that I work to understand (to hear) the theory of listening that Lispector develops in her writing. Here it is helpful to turn to a point made by Jean-Luc Nancy, namely that to create a philosophy of listening, it is necessary to learn from poets and writers of fiction. For Nancy (2007), and the philosophical tradition to which he belongs, listening represents an escape from the dominance of language and signification, and in order to think it, one must bend language a bit so as to hear and give sense to the extra-semantic modes of signification, to that which makes sense primarily as sound, timbre, and tone.5 Reminding his reader that there is quite possibly “more isomorphism between the visual and the conceptual,” Nancy criticizes the vision-centric character of philosophy from Plato to Lacan (30). Instead of terms (metaphors) such as accent, tone, timbre, resonance, sound, amplitude, density, vibration, or undulation, philosophical knowledge has\n\n14\n\nWriting by Ear\n\ninstead drawn from terms associated with the visual domain: form, idea, representation, aspect, and phenomenon – all of which serve to maintain the dominance of the visual rather than that of “acoustic penetration” (3). If listening is what escapes theorization, it is because it is also what quite naturally escapes the gaze. Nancy reminds his reader that one cannot see what one hears, and that it is thus necessary to move from an eyeoriented phenomenology to an ear-oriented ontology, which also implies “surmounting, outsmarting [déjouer], or displacing the ‘impossibility of circumscribing the essence of listening’ within a theoretical system” (78). What if, as a thought experiment, we were to imagine the allegorical cave in Plato’s Republic as a space of echoes instead of shadows? Can it be done? Might one, for instance, theorize listening (and timbre) by undoing the “primacy of language and signification” (30)? Would the resulting “negative semantics or paradoxical hermeneutics” provide enough of a foundation upon which to build (34)? According to Nancy, a philosophy of listening must satisfy three demands. First, it needs to consider resonance as a special particularity of hearing that can serve as the foundation of all senses. Second, it must foreground the “listening body” as a resonant chamber: From the first cry of a newborn to the last murmur, a listening body releases “something produced in the throat, a borborygmus, a crackle, a stridency where a weighty, murmuring matter breathes, opened into the division of its resonance” (27). Third, it must frame the subject as a “diapason-subject,” by which Nancy means a presence that occurs not “in view of” but rather in a process of constant referral, an echo (16). Such a framing effectively transcends the subject-object distinction and goes back “from the phenomenological subject, as intentional line of sight, to a resonant subject, an intensive spacing of a rebound that does not end in any return to self without immediately relaunching, as an echo, a call to the same self” (21). The subject here is reverberation itself. Writing by Ear and Multilingualism: “I Live by Ear” The expression “I write by ear,” which appears in Lispector’s The Hour of the Star, is the fictional version of a personal note that Claire Varin found in one of Lispector’s notebooks, and which became a point of departure for Varin’s study: “Vivo de ouvido. Vivo de ter ouvido falar” (“I live by ear. I live by having heard [others] speak”) (2002, 26). This was perhaps not by chance. It is in fact striking that Varin, a native of Canada who had travelled to Brazil to study Lispector’s work and learn Portuguese, could\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n15\n\ncapture the importance of voice and listening in Lispector’s writing, or as Varin has so beautifully put it, the “ecstasy of the voice before all apprehension” (69). Varin’s study opened possibilities for new work in this area, such as the present one, which focuses specifically on understanding the term “writing by ear” (something not analysed in Varin’s work) and its possibilities for wider application. The question of later-acquired languages affecting the maternal one is fundamental to consider when defining writing by ear. Interviewing Lispector’s eldest sister, Varin discovered that their parents spoke Yiddish at home, a language that Clarice heard but never formally learned or spoke: “Final truth, or first hidden truth: Yiddish, a language wandering among other languages” (61). Another writer, Grace Paley (1989), also a foreigner to Brazil, has made a keen and acute observation in this regard: “Clarice Lispector spent the first two months of her life in the town of Chechelnik in the Ukraine. This is a small short fact. The interesting question, unanswered in the places I’ve looked for it, is – at what age did she enter the Portuguese language? And how much Russian did she bring with her? Any Yiddish? Sometimes I think this is what her work is about … one language trying to make itself at home in another. Sometimes there’s hospitality, sometimes a quarrel” (ix). The daughter of Yiddish-speaking Jewish immigrants, Lispector was born on December 10, 1920, and she would die the day before her fiftyseventh birthday, on December 9, 1977, of a cancer that was diagnosed far too late for effective treatment. She was born in Ukraine, in the village of Chechelnik, precisely when her parents were leaving Russia in order to escape the growing persecution of Jews.6 After a long process, Lispector’s parents along with Clarice and her two older sisters managed to board a ship in Hamburg that was headed to Brazil. They arrived in 1922, when Clarice was about one year old. They disembarked in the Northeast, in Maceió (Alagoas), where her father had family. Her father would initially work as a peddler, and the family was inarguably quite poor. Lispector’s experience of Northeastern Brazil would expand when her family moved to Recife (Pernambuco). Besides hearing Yiddish at home, Lispector attended a Hebrew school in Pernambuco, the Colégio Hebreo-Idisch-Brasileiro: In the third grade, before her mother died, she went to a new school, the Colégio Hebreo-Idisch-Brasileiro, on the Rua da Glória, a block or so away from the Praça Maciel Pinheiro. As the name indicates, the school taught\n\n16\n\nWriting by Ear Hebrew and Yiddish in addition to the usual disciplines … There are no references to Hebrew in her work, but the child with the gift for words apparently made up the gap quickly, for she was chosen to give one of the three year-end discourses the students presented to the faculty and parents, in Hebrew, Yiddish, and Portuguese. The small Clarice gave the Hebrew discourse, which means she was at the top of the class. (Moser 2009, 65)\n\nWhen she was fifteen years old, the family moved to Rio de Janeiro. Lispector’s mother, who suffered from a chronic paralysis, would die in 1930.7 After studying law, acquiring Brazilian citizenship, starting a career as a journalist, and publishing her first novel (1943), Lispector would marry the young Brazilian diplomat Mauricio Gurgel Valente and undertake a series of travels that would keep her out of Brazil for sixteen years. It was then that other languages, especially English and French, would insinuate themselves upon her ears. As Varin argues, on the bilingualism and even multilingualism of Lispector’s fiction: Yiddish rests within her almost as a stowaway, as she would never learn to express herself in the language of her mother, who had died when Clarice was only nine years old. Mothered in Yiddish, she would assimilate the Portuguese of the land chosen by her parents … She would constantly cultivate a binary mental structure through the acquisition of other languages (French, English, and Italian during her residence in Italy (1944–46), Switzerland (1946–49), England (1951), and the United States (1952–59) and thanks to her activities as a translator over the last fifteen years of her life … Raised with the instability of a limited bilingualism, she worked, quite naturally, in the margins. Her syntax, which surreptitiously translates a singular mix of languages, emerges like a kind of foreign accent. (27)\n\nThis particular “mix of languages” makes Lispector an exemplary case of someone who writes language as a foreigner, making her especially responsive to hearing nuances, timbres, and intonations (material that precedes semantic comprehension):8 Pois, como eu disse a palavra tem de se parecer com a palavra, instrumento meu. Ou não sou um escritor? Na verdade sou mais ator porque, com apenas um modo de pontuar, faço malabarismos de entonação, obrigo o respirar alheio a me acompanhar o texto. (1998e, 29–30)\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n17\n\n(Since as I said the word has to resemble the word, my instrument. Or am I not a writer? Actually, I’m more of an actor because with only one way to punctuate, I juggle with intonation and force another’s breathing to accompany my text.) (2011, 14)\n\nTo “juggle with intonation” is to write by ear like a foreigner who mentally repeats the sonority of the language she hears to learn how to play with it and manipulate it into meaningful if idiosyncratic shapes. It follows logically from this that the punctuation of Lispector’s text seeks to capture a particular intonation, which in turn makes it very difficult for her to write, as she constantly makes clear in her fiction and non-fiction. Anyone who has read Lispector knows that her writing serves as a persistent attempt to capture a vibration – a said that strives to inscribe what is unsaid. As a writer, Lispector is not satisfied with her material, the words that are chosen and used; as a writer, she wants her reader to look at the written word and be able to read – or, better still, to hear – all the words that were not chosen, which remain as non-realized virtualities, as if it were possible to write not according to syntagmatic axes but rather simply according to the axes of the paradigm (to recall Ferdinand de Saussure’s and Roman Jakobson’s semiotic terminology). This is why colours (vision) and sound (hearing) are her principal paradigms. This is also why reading Lispector can be an experience that is as difficult as it is pleasurable. Her words reach us first as sounds, with the body, and they touch unexpected regions. The translator of her Complete Stories, Katrina Dodson (2015), expresses her impressions of Lispector’s work: “Reading Clarice Lispector is a disorienting experience” (629). She continues: What remains constant is the intimate physicality of Clarice’s voice – its strong rhythms and the way she seems to be whispering in your ear like a sister, mother, and lover, somehow touching you from far away. Part of her rhythm comes from a fondness for repetition: refrains that produce an incantatory feel or thematic crescendo, anaphoric structures that lend a biblical tone, the slapstick effect of a repeated catchphrase, or the compulsive reiterations of an obsessive mind, like Laura’s in “The Imitation of the Rose.” Her words hold onto a sensory coherence, even when their semantic logic threatens to come undone … She haunts us each in different ways. I have presented to you the Clarice that I hear best. (635)\n\n18\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nThe Form of the Book and Its Chapters I present the form of the book through two specific notes. From the first, I explain that the book itself possesses a rhetorical structure that resembles the theory I wish to develop. In this sense, this text not only speaks about writing by ear, it also shows it through the very form of its argumentation. The book has an openly paraphrastic, fragmentary, or even kaleidoscopic structure, which operates on many occasions through repetitions, jumps, and insights. As becomes apparent throughout the argumentation, a theory of writing by ear presupposes a rhetoric that questions and problematizes conventional forms of (written) reason. Such a rhetoric is present throughout Lispector’s work, as well as in the broader evolution of the novel in Brazil. The second note refers to the diction that I employ. This book is written largely in the rich and difficult interstices of American English and Brazilian Portuguese, and with the explicit intention of producing mutual resonances. As stated in the Preface, Writing by Ear came to be through the (strange and estranging) experience of teaching LusoBrazilian literature in English and in the United States. It thus has its origins in certain observations, interactions in my teaching and research that came to form theoretical inquiries revolving around spatial and linguistic dislocation. The next two chapters situate listening in writing in the broader context of Brazilian literature. The other chapters focus, solely, on a reading of Lispector’s novels. The chapter “Writing by Ear” starts with a comparison between Lispector’s “writing by ear” and Augusto de Campos’s poetic notion of “pulsation,” in order to highlight the aural aspect of poetry and prose. The main goal is to present a listening history of Brazilian literature while also refining questions of concern to scholars of Latin American literature related to the semantics of edges and borders, to a semiotics of corporeality, and to a performativity directed by the sense of hearing. In this chapter, it is also important to underscore that “writing by ear” as a fictional framework has particular relevance for literatures that tend to maintain an ethical, poetic, and political connection with communities deeply shaped by forms of verbal communication that do not rely on the mediation of writing. It is no secret that these communities, both within and beyond the social sciences, have been pejoratively framed as “illiterate” or “unlettered.” As a conceit, “writing by ear” unquestionably finds itself resonating strongly with and in many cases travelling alongside marginalized communities in Latin\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n19\n\nAmerica, the Caribbean, and Africa – and this even if we leave aside the wide range of ways in which this idea reverberates with Native American thought. Presented as a theoretical tool, a kind of vade mecum concept, writing by ear, and its extension in the aural novel and the echopoetics, allows me to disclose a particular configuration that the international field of literature acquires in and through Brazil; at the same time, it brings out the inherently cosmopolitan character of Brazilian literature and the omnivorous and ever-attentive relationship that it has to other literatures and languages.9 My concern is to escape, by all means necessary, any essentialized or isolationist reading of Lispector’s work so as to grasp a more intimate and planetary sense of writing that has taken place in Brazil. In chapter 3, “The Aural Novel,” I trace out the contours of Lispector’s “aural novel,” a rubric that brings to the forefront a neglected aspect of polyphony in fictional prose. I first conceptualize the term in accordance with novelists such as Mia Couto and Toni Morrison, to then present a reading of Lispector’s A hora da estrela (The Hour of the Star, 1977), in which the notion of “writing by ear” finds its first explicit expression. I pay special attention to the form of the aural novel in Brazil, in a genealogy that goes back to the pioneering work of Joaquim Maria Machado de Assis in the late nineteenth century, and I discuss the work of Oswald de Andrade and of João Guimarães Rosa as important figures for the formation of the “aural novel.” As this is a book focused on Lispector’s work, when I do speak of other writers, I tend to focus on the same literary tradition within which she participated: that of the modern Brazilian novel. My broader suggestion, not developed here, is that the work of other modern Brazilian writers such as Mário de Andrade (1893–1945) and Graciliano Ramos (1892–1953), as well as more recent authors such as Hilda Hilst (1930–2004) and Paulo Leminski (1944–89), and even contemporary novelists such as Veronica Stigger, Nuno Ramos, Evandro Afonso Ferreira, Ana Miranda, and many others, can be profitably read through the lens (or, more accurately, within the echoing space) of a writing by ear, forming in this way an entire lineage of aural works. In chapter 4, “Hearing the Wild Heart,” I offer a close analysis of Lispector’s first novel, Perto do coração selvagem (Near to the Wild Heart, 1943). The goal is to present the first development of “writing by ear” through an examination of the image of the “dead ear,” which appears in the first paragraph of her first novel. There is here (hear), I suggest, a deep connection to Vincent van Gogh’s act of cutting his ear, itself a\n\n20\n\nWriting by Ear\n\ngesture that marks modern art. This unusual comparison has required the development of a sinuous argumentation that follows the flow of unconscious connections. The “dead ear” offers an occasion to understand a series of Lispector’s motifs that will reappear in Água Viva, published thirty years after her first novel, and narrated by a character who is also a painter. I describe these motifs in Lispector’s texts and, also, in the paintings she produced in the 1970s. In my reading, the motif of the sacrifice of the ear corresponds, for Lispector, to the sacrifice of the voice in silent writing. At the same time, as an ear detached from the individual body, it signals an expanded sense of listening to the world. Following George Bataille’s reading of van Gogh’s sacrifice in relation to his paintings of sunflowers and withered flowers, I also explore other salient motifs in this chapter: the voice of “the woman” in relation to the figure of the mother, the link between the ear and the uterus, between hearing and childhood, between hearing and mourning. The status of Lispector’s presentation of her protagonist as a very clear “portrait of the artist as a young (wo)man” is related to the force of creation as radiation, and the solar images that appear both in Lispector and van Gogh. Born from a sacrifice, the process of writing is described through the figure of amputation, the figure of the inaudible, the “it” language, and its echolalias. Finally, at the end of her first novel, the body of the protagonist expands itself to the wild world and is reborn as a horse, a motif that will reappear in all of the subsequent chapters until the conclusion. In chapter 5, “Loud Object,” I turn my attention to Água Viva (1973), which bore the working title “Objeto Gritante.” I trace the image of this “loud object” as being the union of the ear and the typewriter. Friedrich Kittler’s discussion of Nietzsche and the typewriter (1999) is an occasion to relate Lispector’s work to that mode of modernity according to which the sacrifice of the mother’s voice gives rise to an attentive and (un) authorial listening. In chapter 6, “The Echopoetics of G.H.,” I focus on Lispector’s bestknown work, A paixão segundo G.H. (The Passion According to G.H.), published in 1964. Understood as a study of metamorphosis, the novel, I argue, presents its structure in and through the operation of echo. A verbal art founded on the mythological figure of Echo, the term “echopoetics” serves to conceptualize and give expression to the reverberations of both sound and silence in Lispector’s prose masterpiece as well as to the notion of authorship as a receptive (and responsive) stance. A comparison with the myth of Echo (as presented by Ovid) also helps my\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n21\n\nreader to understand the development of a poetics of listening in Lispector’s novel that moves in an ultimately inhuman direction and takes on a planetary dimension. I begin the concluding chapter, “Hearing Horses,” with a chance encounter, a productive trompe l’oreille. It involves my sonic confusion between “horse” and “Horace” at an academic talk that ended up giving form to my poetic and philosophical project, and which brought me closer to understanding Lispector’s poetics. Most dramatically, there is the stark poetic difference between Horace and Ovid, and Lispector’s consistent preference for the latter. Instead of coherence and verisimilitude (Horatian precepts), writing by ear – and Lispector’s entire oeuvre – produces literary metamorphoses, a whole continent of fecund and beautiful monsters. What we find in Lispector are plurivocal texts, forms in flux, and numerous beasts – some mythological, such as centaurs and sirens, and some woven together in novel settings of juxtaposition and co-presence. For Lispector, it also happens that the horse is by far (and perhaps not incidentally for the personal anecdote with which I begin this chapter) the most important figure in her extensive bestiary. It is thus of particular significance that the central event in A cidade sitiada (The Besieged City, 1949) is the Ocyrhoe-like transformation of a suburban woman into a horse. Philosophically, the horse of Lispector/Lucrécia is related (as in a genealogy) to other horses in the history of thought, in particular to the “philosopher-Centaurus,” Friedrich Nietzsche. According to the image developed by Peter Sloterdijk (1986), Nietszche, the thinker whose gesture to protect a horse is said to have been the last one witnessed before he entered the madness that clouded the final years of his life, established the modern form of literature as a hybrid text in between philosophy and fiction. This is also Lispector: a fictionistphilosopher, a writer-Centaurus (centaurus, one should keep in mind, is a grammatically feminine word in Latin). Lispector attempts to unite form and movement, thus moving past the traditional binary of form and theme. Against the fixity of the written text, her consistent (even obsessive) aim was to create texts able to capture the instant of time in movement. Following the horse sign, I compare Lispector’s form and movement to what Eadweard Muybridge managed to do, in the late nineteenth century, through the use of stop-motion photography. The ear in writing thus has a relation to the non-human world, to modern technologies of sound and image, and (above all) to the way in which focused attention on both has shaped the production of fictional prose in Brazil.\n\n22\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nA Certain Intimate Sense In a famous essay, “Notícia da atual literatura brasileira – Instinto de Nacionalidade” (“Report on Contemporary Brazilian Literature – The Instinct for Nationality”) (1994 [1873]), Machado de Assis rejects the representation of local picturesqueness or “colour” in novels and defends the idea that writers should reveal their connection to a certain time and/or country through the expression of a “certo sentimento íntimo” (804), a “certain intimate feeling.” Machado wrote the essay with the intention of publishing it first in the United States, which brings to the fore a confrontation between the foreigner and the local – between a here and a there – that is an integral part of any definition of a “national literature.” That is, for Machado de Assis, the question of what makes a Brazilian author (or one of any other nationality) distinct from all other sorts of authors is an instinctive belonging to a certain time, to a certain language, and to a certain territory. A kind of writerly habitus. The question for us is, beyond imperfect approximations borrowed from the social sciences, how are we to understand the matter of “instinct,” this simultaneously concrete and vague expression of a “certain intimate feeling”? My suggestion is to translate this feeling or sentiment as sense, specifically, the sense of audition, which is so overwhelming and recurrent in Brazilian authors (and, a fortiori, Machado de Assis) that one can seriously and productively talk about a “philosophy of the ear” in Brazilian literature. Ultimately, Writing by Ear presents fiction writers as literary theorists. It is, at its most basic level, an invitation to include within current theoretical and speculative debates regarding world literature specific conceits with origins in the writing practices of Brazil’s modern novelists, and articulated primarily in Brazilian Portuguese. In this aspect, it is a study that directly responds to a statement by anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro (2016): I’ve said it elsewhere, and I’ll repeat it here: Oswald de Andrade, Guimarães Rosa and Clarice Lispector, after Machado de Assis, are the true authors of a philosophical reflection that is truly Brazilian, the inventors of an original aesthetic, metaphysical, and political language capable of bringing to light the obscure conceptual potentialities of the language(s) that we speak in our country, just as Borges or Lezama Lima did for American Spanish. (12)\n\nIntroduction: A Certain Intimate Sense\n\n23\n\nWhen I choose to translate the intimate sense(s) of Brazilian literature through the notion of “writing by ear,” what I am performing is an act of invention in the sense re-given to the word by the American anthropologist Roy Wagner (1981): not as testing something new as in a scientific experiment, but in the ancient rhetorical sense of producing analogies. If an ethnographer translates a foreign culture according to the terms of her culture of origin, similarly, I am conceptualizing the term “writing by ear” as a way to describe and to translate a culture and language of origin after being affected by the effects of other cultures and languages. As we know, it is by being outside of a place that we recognize its particularity while defamiliarizing ourselves with it in a process of turning foreigner and operating through barbarisms, translations, and mistranslations. Finally, Writing by Ear reflects a genuine effort on my part to speak simultaneously within, together with, and beyond the traditional disciplinary and regional (not to mention national and linguistic) concerns of Brazilianists and Latin Americanists. That is, the theory of a writing ear is most directly concerned with opening up a broader dialogue on listening and literature. Much like an act of literary and philosophical diplomacy, one of my basic goals for the present book is for it to serve as a conversation starter. That is, I hope to present and analyse dialogues, resonances, and connections in Lispector’s fiction in the Anglo-American critical idiom. Here I would like to quote James Clifford (2013), who highlights the ways in which culture is “local, tied to blood and language, rather than emergent, multiplex or coalitional” (147–8). For Clifford, the tendency to equate “language with culture oversimplifies more complex affiliations” (149). These affiliations can include provisional groups established by trade, by conflict, by kinship, or through multilingualism and dialects. For me, the question of the ear is fundamental in a process of finding, inventing, and producing an “emergent, multiplex or coalitional” field of relations based on multilingualism, accents, and dialects, for the ear opens the possibility to receive all languages as sounds even if not semantically understandable; that is, the ear establishes connections that go beyond the linguistic link to accentuate the musical and sonorous aspect of language. This is how the ear comprehends the musical sphere of tones and accents that allow us to understand the intention of a speech even if we don’t understand its meanings. Besides that, the ear brings the vibrating aspect, the sonic\n\n24\n\nWriting by Ear\n\ntexture (Bairon 2005) of a text when it is heard in my silent reading (Stewart 1990) or vocalized and performed aloud (Bernstein 1998). The notion of Writing by Ear aims, though, to contribute to “the existence of multiple affiliations,” based specifically on listening, i.e., on a pre-language zone of murmurs and rumours, whispers and jokes, tricksters’ puns, witticisms, translations and mistranslations populating the contact zone between local-regional-world-planetary, as well as animal-human-earth relationships.\n\n2 Writing by Ear\n\nOuço a música antiga de palavras, sim, é assim. (I hear the ancient music of words and words, yes, that’s it.) Lispector, The Hour of the Star\n\nIn The Hour of the Star, published in 1977 two months before her death, Clarice Lispector, in the guise of a male narrator, made a complex connection between written words and the sense of hearing: “E a pergunta é: como escrevo? Verifico que escrevo de ouvido assim como aprendi inglês e francês de ouvido” (“And the question is: how do I write? I can confirm that I write by ear as I learned English and French by ear”) (18; 10). Around the same period, in 1975, Augusto de Campos wrote “O Pulsar,” a poem that takes the form of a telegram from the stars, part of the series “Stelegramas” (1975–8), published in the 1979 collection VIVA VAIA. In the English translation by Augusto de Campos in collaboration with Charles Perrone (2006), we read: “Wherever you may be / on Mars or Eldorado / open a window to see / the pulsar nearly mute / embrace of light years / that no sun cheers / and emptied echoes o(e)ver see.” Visually, the words of the poem stand white on a black background with two letters transformed into patterns: the “o” is designed as a small solar circle, and the “e” is replaced by the image of a star, with the letters acting as punti luminosi. In the poem, the stars threaten to become extinguished as they become smaller and smaller on each line. Even if the poem asks the observer/reader to “open a window” and “see the pulsar nearly mute,” as a message spread across the page or the sky, the pulse of the pulsar was heard by Caetano Veloso, who in 1978 set the poem to music, traversing\n\n26\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nFigure 2.1 Augusto de Campos’s “O Pulsar.” Reprinted by permission of the author. Translated by the author in collaboration with Charles Perrone.\n\nthe connection among writing, vision, and hearing as part of the “verbivocovisual” program of the concrete “poets of fields and spaces” (as Veloso sang in “Sampa” [Veloso 1978]). In the context of the present book, Lispector’s The Hour of the Star, written by ear, and the stars of Campos’s poem – with their “pulsar nearly mute” – resonate together like a message to be deciphered. The poem’s pulsating stars, as well as the death of the protagonist, Macabéa, at the end of Lispector’s novel, coincide in a darkness that somehow shines and with the written word that pulses even if it remains silent. In an interview with Jorge Luis Borges, Augusto de Campos (2013) explains to his Argentinian counterpart that the word “pulsar” in Portuguese exists as a verb and a noun to designate the heartbeat. The same word has also become a neologism originating from the English expression “pulsating radio sources,” transformed into an acronym, “pulsar,” which made him think of pulsating star. In this way, the beating (pulsar)\n\nWriting by Ear\n\n27\n\nof the heart corresponds to the luminous pulsating of the stars. Years later, on the back cover of his collection Despoesia (1994), Campos once again reaffirms his use of pulsar/pulsating and its relationship to the poetic act: “A flor flore / A aranha tece / o poeta poeta / quer o vejam, quer não / ele pulsa / o pulsar quase mudo” (“The flower flowers / The spider spins / The poet poets / Seen or unseen, it pulsates / The nearmute pulsating”). That same “near-mute pulsating” made its appearance in Lispector’s writing through Macabéa, the semi-literate heroine of The Hour of the Star: “Morta, os sinos badalavam mas sem que seus bronzes lhes dessem som. Agora entendo essa história. Ela é a iminência que há nos sinos que quase-quase badalam” (“With her dead, the bells were ringing but without their bronzes giving them sound. Now I understand this story. It is the imminence in those bells that almost-almost ring”) (86; 76). This “pulsar nearly mute” as vibrations appears again in the description of another Lispector character, Angela from A Breath of Life (1978): “Angela é o tremor vibrante de uma corda tensa de harpa depois que é tocada: ela fica no ar ainda se dizendo, dizendo – até que a vibração morra espraiando-se em espumas pelas areias. Depois – silêncio e estrelas” (“Angela is the vibrating tremor of a tense harp-string after it’s been plucked: she stays in the air still saying, saying – until the vibration dies spreading out in froth across the sands. Afterwards – silence and stars”) (45; 35). Connecting Lispector’s writing-by-ear with Augusto de Campos’s pulsar nearly mute is part of a study intended to describe a distinctive quality of literary texts,1 and its specificity in Brazilian modern fiction: this fiction’s sharp sense of hearing, in other words, the way fictional writing captures timbres and nuances, accentuated in a culture where orality and musicality are predominant.2 Although Concrete Poetry has mostly been understood as a visually oriented form of artistic production, centred on the creation of poems appealing to the eyes, in a 1992 interview, Augusto de Campos argues for his poetry’s intense connection to aurality, an argument framed as the response to the following question: It’s also argued, of course, that CP [Concrete Poetry] distorts or denies the orality of lyric discourse. The North American poet and critic John Hollander, for instance, has written that “since a true concrete poem cannot be read aloud, it has no full linguistic dimension, no existence in the ear’s kingdom.” Haroldo de Campos has a poem, “o pavilhão da orelha” (“the outer ear”/“the pavilion of the ear”), that not only (ironically) shows the Portuguese common usage of a phrase like Hollander’s, but as a critical\n\n28\n\nWriting by Ear poem, a kind that the Brazilian concretistas seem to specialize in argues for the aurality of itself and poems like it. (Greene 1992, 25)\n\nCampos’s response to this point is extremely telling: In our experience, we always saw CP as a “verbivocovisual” proposition that did not exclude “the ear’s kingdom,” but integrated it into a new conception of concretude, of the materiality of poetic language … And a large number of concrete poems have involved or emphasized the auditory level, in a way unexplored even by the traditional lyric … Or one might recall the many musical works that have adapted their texts from CP. All this is empirical evidence that the general conception of CP has never implicitly excluded the aural dimension … In the great majority of cases, however, we can say that the emphasis on the visual element, by means of repetition or paronomasia, sustains a parallel emphasis on the aural level. What’s required, in this scheme, is a comparative rupture with the linearity of a traditional reading: a convocation of various voices, a simultaneity or multiplicity of readings, the introduction of the pause or silence as a structural element. (26–7)\n\nIn another interview, Campos relates not only the creation of poems but also the act of transcreations, intensely practised by the Concrete poets, to an acute sense of listening: Art translation holds the same tension in relation to the original as the musical interpreter does in relation to the composer. In this sense I can invoke the liberty that jazz singers and instrumentalists have, for example, to give “their” version of classics such as Gershwin or Cole Porter. There is a great difference between hearing “Summertime” sung by Billie Holiday or Janis Joplin, each with a personal and unique reading of the song, and by a lyrical singer like Barbara Hendricks, who gives an orthodox performance. Or by someone who just sings it in tune. For this very reason, although I try to stay attuned as much as possible to the literal original, I have no interest in keeping this literality when I feel the desire to recreate it, in the sense of “making it new,” to make a regenerative and differenced interpretation in my language that makes it come alive in Portuguese as a work that “everyone wants to recite by memory.” There are no absolute rules about this, although technique becomes “the test of sincerity,” as Pound said. It is, above all else, a question of hearing. (Translation by Jackson 2010, 142)\n\nWriting by Ear\n\n29\n\nLispector’s poetics, as I argue throughout the present book, is the result of an analogous “question of hearing.” We can say that both authors, Lispector and Campos (and their related poetics), appeal to readers to perceive the vibrations or the imminence of sounds and images in printed-mute words, in order to encounter the text as an object to be seen and to be heard. Both authors, in this sense, are writing to escape the fate announced once by Marshall McLuhan: “literacy gave us an eye for an ear” (1997, 124). In his famous sentence, literacy leads to four hundred years of silent reading. As explained by McLuhan’s editor, Michael A. Moos: “The phonetic alphabet inaugurates purely visual thinking because it begins to circumvent the ear … typography silences the ear altogether by making silent reading possible” (1997, 154). Distinct from literacy and “its stress on fragmentation and specialization,” the electronic age would return us to a tribalized collective sense of hearing, for “we hear from all directions at once; this creates a unique unvisualizable space” (McLuhan 1997, 123). For McLuhan, this auditory space is “a kind of orchestral, resonating unity” (124). In accordance with McLuhan, but in defence of silent reading, this study argues that the opposition between oral/written and aural/visual forms cannot be applied to fictional texts as resonant objects. Printed poetry and prose in fiction are oral/written/aural/visual at the same time, as verbivocovisual products. If the analysis of sounds is mandatory in the interpretation of poems, the texts focused on in my study belong to the genre of fictional prose. But the point is that, when we start to consider a text as a resonant unit, the lines or the limits between genres are not as important as their hybridism, with fictional prose acting out as poems or prose poems. What is of central importance in the present book is fiction; i.e., my focus is on written texts that create and establish an imaginary relationship with the world, that constitute themselves in more or less deliberate ways as objects that invent or become a world in their own right. Resonances Following the beats of the “Pulsar,” I wish to compare a fictional text to a closed music box: each time a book is opened, one is able to hear the pulse of its words reverberating past experiences in a written form while sending new resonances into the future with each rereading. Wai Chee Dimock’s “theory of resonance” (1997) advances a similar argument. She argues for a turn to hearing and to listening in order to redefine the (printed) literary text as an “aural object,” which changes semantically\n\n30\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nwith the passage of time. Resonance, understood as “the traveling frequencies of sound,” is thus for her the key concept to apply to literary texts. Dimock reverses the traditional answer to the question, why a printed literary text endures. It is not because it is a fixed and completed stylistic object, but rather because it is incomplete and has an “unstable ontology.” This means that a (printed) literary text is affected by the interpretive readings it receives over time, incorporating new meanings in its materiality. This process of absorbing is a resonant effect. A literary meaning is, then, not only multiple but also mutable and malleable. She argues: “The literary is not an attribute resident in a text, but a relation, a form of engagement, between a changing object and a changing recipient, between a tonal presence and the way it is differently heard over time” (1064). Dimock also makes the claim that our hearing has become insensitive to perceiving such nuances, and that we need to reintroduce the importance of the ears, which have been muted by the supremacy of the eye in Western thought. Similarly, in his small but fundamental book Listening, Jean-Luc Nancy (2007) proposes that we consider resonance as the foundation of all senses. Nancy’s text helps us think the transference from the auditory/ musical field to the literary, when he distinguishes between the terms “hearing” and “listening” (entendre and écouter in French). On the one hand, “hearing” means to understand the meaning of the message, to understand what is being said by means of the intellect. On the other hand, “listening” denotes intense and special concentration on that which is received in terms of bodily resonance, paying attention above all to the intonation, the timbres, the noises, and the silences. Thinking about listening means thinking about what comes before articulated language, like an infra-language (noises, babbling, murmurs, whispers), and what comes after, the ultra-sound that outlasts and transcends language like an extended rhythm or an echo that rebounds. Silence is a special case, as it is as much infra- as ultra-, and is placed as easily before and after semantic language. In this expression, “I write by ear,” which is akin to a self-discovery, Clarice Lispector opens the doors to a world that is still little explored in the printed literary universe: the study of the auditory and acoustic properties of writing, present not only at the moment of fictional creation, when the writer “hears” voices and inscribes them, but also during silent reading, when an imaginary world is awakened by the vibrations of the words’ sounds and images. Taking the expression “writing by ear” literally, and unfolding the web of its musical and auditory metaphors,\n\nWriting by Ear\n\n31\n\nthe aim is to describe the form it takes in fictional prose. The doubly implied metaphors, “playing by ear” and “learning by ear,” suggest that “writing by ear” functions as an allegory (a metaphor of the third degree) for the production and interpretation of fictional texts based on musical acoustic non-writing practices. Writing by ear also requires readers who are able to “hear” a written text, in order to capture precisely that which passes between the lines, like the form and design of an intonation, a tone or a timbre. Given the robust plurivocality that has characterized literature in Brazil since its colonial inception, and the eminently (and explicitly) receptive stance that many of its modern authors have adopted, I have structured my argument in the present chapter to follow two intersecting paths. In the first instance, Lispector’s notion of “writing by ear” serves as a foundation for a renewed history of Brazilian literature, framed as a history of active listening with the sense of hearing and specific acts of audition as its main focus. In the second place, my goal is to offer a Luso-AfroAmerindian-Brazilian contribution to Latin American criticism, turning the semantic range of terms related to edges, margins, and borders to a more explicit semiotics of corporeality and performativity revolving around the ears and sound, more generally. Notes for a Listening Literary History The literature produced in Brazil is as much the result of colonial encounters and mis-encounters as it is the writing of a language continuously emerging from contact between European Portuguese and Amerindian languages, especially the creolized língua geral spoken in Brazil for nearly two centuries along with Nheengatu in the Amazonian region, Guarani and Latin American Spanish in the South, Bantu and other languages from Africa, and, more recently, the languages spoken by Spanish, Catalan, Jews, Syrian, Lebanese, Italian, and Japanese immigrants (among many others) who established themselves in Brazil. It would be a mistake to consider Brazilian Portuguese a mere variant of European Portuguese. When working with Brazilian literature, one is always working with multiple cultures entextualized and recontextualized by writers looking to develop a mode of expression (each time a singular, contingent phenomenon) capable of disclosing the multiple cultures and languages simultaneously in play within the necessarily fictionalized concept of nation, and always against any description or self-designation based on monolingualism.\n\n32\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nIn the Brazilian history of conquest, instead of mind-oriented subjecthood, one finds what Roland Greene (1999) has framed as widespread “objecthood.” Greene examines the early colonial moment during which Brazil’s name emerges from pau-brasil (brazilwood), a commodified object exported to Europe, and the land itself is transformed into an object of desire by the fascination produced by pau-brasil’s deep red colour, linked both to passion and love, and to blood violence. As Greene puts it, there is a singularity to Brazil as a cultural (and unrequited) object of love and conquest in the Americas, a singularity that finds ample modern expression through Oswald de Andrade’s “Brazilwood Poetry” in the 1920s and the “Concrete” poetry of the 1950s. Instead of reacting against this image of objecthood (trying, for example, to proclaim Brazilian identity as a form of unique and fully formed (national) subjecthood), I would like to take advantage of it for a literary and cultural analysis of fiction produced “by ear.” What kind of authorial subject is the one predominantly informed by the ears? My study suggests that rather than a speaking-oriented subject, an ear-oriented author acts less as a subject than as an object of reception (like an anthem); hence conventionally negative aspects such as “belatedness” or “passivity” receive a positive value of openness while concomitantly dealing with the historical and socio-political constraints of Brazil and South America as a whole. An earoriented author is the one (dis)oriented by foreign tongues, by babbling and rumours, erotically and unconsciously moved by that to which s/he listens. Such perspectives, which closely approximate animal perception, for instance, abound in João Guimarães Rosa’s and Lispector’s fiction. In this sense, an ear-oriented author is informed by lyricism, and the text’s message is less the result of an individual quest and more the buzz or pulsar of a collective voice (which otherwise remains unconscious or unheard.) Antonio Vieira and the Línguas The presence and importance of audition in Brazil has a long history that, in my own ear-centric approach, goes back to the línguas (interpreters), people so called because they personified the role of translators living in between the Indigenous languages and the Portuguese spoken by the church. Whether the línguas were Natives being trained by priests or priests who were learning Indigenous languages, they learned by ear before becoming able to produce or to help in the production of the first grammars of the língua geral.3 As is well known, during the colonial\n\nWriting by Ear\n\n33\n\nperiod the focus was on the incorporation of Christianity into the Indigenous languages, with the idea of eliminating the “barbarians,” their way of life, their language, and their way of thinking, and transforming them into converts to Catholicism; later, when the slave trade began, a similar notion was applied to the Africans considered as “boçais” (“obtuse”), incapable of correctly pronouncing the Portuguese language. The following comment on Indigenous language by Antonio Vieira, in his 1657 sermon on the Holy Spirit, is very indicative of this process of an ear-oriented relationship: Por vezes me aconteceu estar com o ouvido aplicado à boca do bárbaro, e ainda do intérprete, sem poder distinguir as sílabas, nem perceber as vogais ou consoantes de que se formavam, equivocando-se a mesma letra com duas e três semelhantes … outras tão interiores e escuras, e mais afogadas na garganta que pronunciadas na língua; outras tão curtas e subidas, outras tão estendidas e multiplicadas, que não percebem os ouvidos mais que a confusão, sendo certo, em todo rigor, que as tais línguas não se ouvem, pois se não ouve delas mais que o sonido, e não palavras desarticuladas e humanas. (2000, 428–9) (At times I found myself with my ear closed to the mouth of the barbarian, and even on that of the interpreter, without being able to distinguish the syllables or understand the vowels and consonants from which they were formed. I’d mistake one letter for two or three similar ones … others were so short and raised, and others so extended and multiple that that one’s ears make out nothing but confusion. In all truth, it’s correct to say that such languages are not heard; that is, one hears in them only their sound rather than discrete human words.)\n\nVieira’s ears could not pick up the meaning of the words being pronounced. What he heard was but the sonorous “confusion” of “línguas escuras” that lacked any divine light. As Alcir Pécora has argued in the context of a commentary on this well-known passage from Vieira’s extensive collection of sermons, it was first and foremost the responsibility of Jesuit missionaries in the Amazon to train (reduzir) the Indigenous tongue in such a way that it might produce sound that was “intelligible” to the Christian ear (2008, 70). Of course, while Vieira’s description would serve as a useful colonial tool to discard the language of nonChristian “barbarians,” it also reveals a great deal about the limitations of the Jesuit ear, i.e., its inability to make sense of foreign languages to\n\n34\n\nWriting by Ear\n\nwhich access is not given through reading but by listening. Roy Wagner gives an excellent description of this complex process of cross-cultural and cross-linguistic listening/hearing. This is a process that tends to be forgotten in a “high literate civilization”; however, it is reawakened whenever one needs to learn a foreign language by ear: Consider what happens when we speak. Often it seems to me that members of a highly literate civilization like our own imagine spaces between the word they use when they talk, rather like those that appear between words on the printed page … In fact, what we produce in speech is a kind of blurred and mumbly music, and one has to learn how to resolve this orchestration into conventional forms and units if one is to make sense of it, much as a trained musician learns to resolve a roar of sensuous tonality into notes, chords, harmony, melodic line, and structural form … what matters, insofar as communication is concerned, is whether the speaker (who is, of course, listening to his own music) and the listener make the same resolutions. (1981, 53)\n\nOswald de Andrade and the “Auracular” World The ethico-politico-aesthetic reversal implicit in a writing by ear would be precisely the focal point of Oswald de Andrade’s denunciation of Vieira and the European colonial project.4 With his ears pricked to the “contribuição milionária de todos os erros” (“wealthy contribution of all the mistakes”) (2011, 61), he draws attention through his philosophy of anthropophagy to an ethic/aesthetic of audition: instead of “civilizing” the Amerindians, one should listen to them: “O homem europeu falou demais … É preciso ouvir o homem nu” (“The European spoke too much … We need to hear the naked man”) (1990, 285). In one of his literary columns (crônicas), part of a series not incidentally titled Telefonema (“Telephone Call”), Andrade accentuates the relation between the anthropophagous mouth and listening: “O movimento aqui em São Paulo desenvolvido com o nome de ‘Antropofagia’ nunca excluiu as conquistas técnicas da cívilização nem os sonhos do momento "
