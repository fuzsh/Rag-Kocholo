Until the late 1980s, critical literature on the subject was, quite simply, nonexistent. The lack of critical works was so dire that if one reads the seventh volume of Francisco Rico’s canonical Historia y crítica de la literatura española (1984), devoted to the period between 1914 and 1939, one can find statements like these: “The history of Spanish literary Avant-Garde is yet to be written” (205); “we still need a thorough study of Ramón’s [Gómez de la Serna] novels” (210); or “1920s Spanish prose – meritorious exceptions notwithstanding – is yet to be studied” (528). We can all agree with Ródenas’ statement: Spanish\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi 10.1163/9789004310186_002\n\n2\n\nGregori and Herrero-Senés\n\nliterary criticism suffered some sort of cultural pathology. This pathology, in our opinion, is structured around three main dysfunctions: the traditional generational division of Spanish literary history, the Francoist cultural program, and the cultural revisionism of the Spanish democratic transition. In opposition to mainstream European practices, Spanish literary criticism has traditionally understood modern literature (since, at least, the last decades of the nineteenth century) as a succession of literary generations; that is, cultural groups composed of writers and intellectuals who were born around the same time and that, supposedly, shared the same cultural views and artistic aspirations. The person responsible for this peculiar understanding of literary history, as for so many additional concepts, was the Spanish philosopher, cultural critic, and public figure José Ortega y Gasset (1883–1955). Ortega followed Auguste Comte and Wilhelm Dilthey in his own hybrid development of the literary generational theory, as explained in his En torno a Galileo (1933). Literary historians followed suit, and the canonical works of Pedro Salinas (Literatura española. Siglo xx, 1940) and, most particularly, Julián Marías with his crucial El método histórico de las generaciones (1949), contributed to the consolidation of the generational method among Hispanists. The importance of the assumption of this method among Spanish literary critics is paramount because it has effectively shut off Spain’s modern literature from the rest of Europe. Instead of having a modernist period and an Avant-Garde, Spanish literature was conceptualized as consisting of a so-called Generation of 1898, a Generation of 1914, a Generation of 1927, and so forth. To complicate things further, the Generation of 1927 – roughly corresponding to the Avant-Garde movement in the rest of Europe – was conceived as made almost exclusively of poets including Federico García Lorca, Rafael Alberti, Vicente Aleixandre, Luis Cernuda and others. In sum, traditional Spanish literary history marginalized the narrative production of the 1920s under layers of artificially-constructed “generations” that precluded any comparatist understanding of Spanish mo­­ dernism. The mere notion of modernism was regarded as foreign until the pu­­ blication of José-Carlos Mainer’s seminal La Edad de Plata (1981). Even Mainer avoided using it, preferring instead the much more palatable “Edad de plata” [Silver Age] by virtue of its association with the Golden Age [“edad de oro”] of Quevedo, Calderón and Cervantes. Younger scholars, particularly Domingo Ródenas, Nil Santiáñez, Mary Lee Bretz, and C. Christopher Soufas, have contributed decisively to the normalization of the term “modernism” for the cultural period spanning, roughly speaking, from 1898 to 1936. After the victory of General Francisco Franco’s insurrected troops in April 1939 following nearly three years of a bloody – both literally and metaphorically – civil war, a new cultural program began and dominated Spanish literary history until at least the very late 1960s. In a nutshell, Francoist cultural ideology tried\n\nIntroduction: The Cultural Pathologies of Spanish Modernism\n\n3\n\nto re-appropriate Spanish culture as a fundamentally nationalist endeavor, while re-interpreting the immediate cultural past (i.e., modernism) as a precursor of the current intellectual climate. In that way, modernist writers like Unamuno or Azorín came to be associated with the nationalist concern about Spain (“el tema de España”), while many of the best modernist and AvantGarde creators were either exiled (Guillén, Cernuda, Salinas, Aub, Alberti, Jarnés…) or killed (Lorca). The aestheticism of art for art’s sake and the exube­ rant creativity of vanguardism was dismissed as, at worst, fundamentally antiSpanish and, at best, childish games unworthy of serious critical inquiry. To be fair, the critical dismissal of the Avant-Garde was not the exclusive doing of the political right and of Francoism; it happened before and after Franco amongst leftist activists. The so-called “literatura de avanzada” [advanced literature] or “literatura re-humanizada” [re-humanized literature] of former Avant-Garde figures like César Muñoz Arconada or José Díaz Fernández implied a sustained criticism of the Avant-Garde for its lack of political involvement during the 1930s. As was often the case with other European writers, many Spanish vanguardists filled the ranks of Communism and of Fascism, and both poles of the ideological spectrum criticized the Avant-Garde on the same political grounds. Many decades later, with Franco’s death in 1975 and the ensuing democratic transition (1975–1982), the cultural field was re-organized around a long overdue recognition of the culture of the Spanish Second Republic (1931– 1939) and of the political exiles in Europe and the Americas. Literary historians emphasized the importance of writers like Rosa Chacel, Rafael Alberti (and, with him, the whole so-called poetic group of 1927), Francisco Ayala and Max Aub. Nothing could be more appropriate than this meritorious recognition. However, it would be naïve to regard this renewed interest in the letters of the Spanish Republic as purely cultural; it was also a very conscious political act. As the field of literary history veered towards leftist positions in an attempt to show a more balanced picture of Spanish literature than the one it was forced to ­perpetuate for forty years, it also committed an injustice: it left behind a group of writers whose works were apolitical and unconcerned with social commitment, namely, the Avant-Garde. Given this state of affairs, it’s not surprising that the Avant-Garde remained, for many decades, the story of an absence. At this point, however, it is important to make a general distinction between poetry and narrative. Both genres suffered the consequences of the cultural pathologies we have been explai­ ning; however, poetry was critically privileged since the very beginning. AvantGarde prose, subsequently, suffered a double discrimination in this regard. Not in vain, the history of the Spanish Avant-Garde is too often limited to the short lifespan of the only vanguardist movement identified as such in Spain: Ultraísmo. Around that term, Rafael Cansinos-Assens and Guillermo de Torre\n\n4\n\nGregori and Herrero-Senés\n\ngalvanized a small number of poets who dominated the poetic scene through their texts in the pages of journals like Grecia, Ultra, Horizonte, Alfar, and other “ultraísta” venues between 1919 and 1923. However, as the “manifiesto ultraísta” (January 1919) makes abundantly clear, the movement was much more an act of cultural marketing than a reflection of an innovative poetic quest. CansinosAssens published the ultraist manifesto in the journal Cervantes, where he had just been appointed director of the Spanish literature section. The obvious intention of “Ultra. Un manifiesto de la juventud literaria” was to gather the literary youth under Cansinos’s command. In order to do so, ultraísmo was defined, from the very beginning, as “indeterminado” [indefinite] (2). It was precisely this planned indeterminacy, this rejection of any programmatic direction, that allowed ultraístas to become the only representatives of the Spanish Avant-Garde because by definition all Avant-Garde was ultraísta: “Nuestro lema será ‘ultra,’ y en nuestro credo cabrán todas las tendencias, sin distinción, con tal que expresen un anhelo nuevo […] todas esas tendencias que hasta aquí se denominaron con diversos nombres, pueden acogerse a este lema ‘Ultra,’ que, como dice el manifiesto, no es el de una escuela determinada, sino el de un renovador dinamismo espiritual” [Our motto is ‘ultra’ and our creed fits all trends, without distinction, provided they express a new longing […] all these trends so far called by various names are eligible for this slogan ‘Ultra’ that, as the manifesto says, does not follow a particular school, but a renewed spiritual dynamism] (3–4). Besides Cansinos himself, the signing members of the movement were Xavier Bóveda, César A. Comet, Fernando Iglesias, Pedro Iglesias Caballero, Pedro Garfias, J. Rivas Panedas, J. de Aroca, and a very young (and very ambitious) Guillermo de Torre. Every ism was, to a greater or lesser extent, an example of cultural marketing, and ultraísmo was no exception in this regard. Born in the era of high capitalism, Avant-Garde artists were perfectly aware of the need to market themselves, to create a demand for their products, and to sell them to the best of their abilities. The same rings true for narrative, as Domingo Ródenas will further elaborate in the first chapter of this book, but it is important to note the peculiar conditions under which Avant-Garde prose was both cultivated and critically received. The Avant-Garde was seen as a mostly poetic endeavor, while prose was universally regarded as less conducive to AvantGarde experimentations. Such a prejudice affected both writers and critics. Eppur si muove… The progressive transformation of modernist prose – mainly represented in Spain by the decadentism of Valle-Inclán, the delightful morosity of Azorín and Miró, and the metafictional mise-en-abyme of Unamuno – into a coherent Avant-Garde narrative was explored in two main formats: poetic prose and\n\nIntroduction: The Cultural Pathologies of Spanish Modernism\n\n5\n\ncritical essay. Following the end of the Great War (1918) and well into the 1920s, some writers started to explore the aesthetic possibilities of poetic prose. Perhaps the two best-known examples would be the literary critic and cultural journalist Rafael Cansinos-Assens, with texts like El candelabro de los siete brazos (1914), as well as the poet Juan Ramón Jiménez, with Platero y yo (1914) and several narrative excerpts in Diario de un poeta recién casado (1917). Other modernist writers also partook in this poetic prose vogue, like Valle-Inclán with La lámpara maravillosa (1916). Around 1920 we find the first texts of a younger generation that publishes their narratives – either in short poetic prose format or as critical essays – in the pages of ultraísta journals, as well as in the pages of two of the most important cultural publications of the time, España, edited by Ortega, and the literary journal Indice, led by Juan Ramón Jiménez. The critical essay is represented by the selection that Antonio Marichalar compiled in 1924 to represent the new literature of Spain in the French journal Intentions, with texts by Jorge Guillén, Adolfo Salazar, José Bergamín, Fernando Vela, and by Marichalar himself. Rather than using the term Avant-Garde, the most common terms to refer to these emerging forms of writing (in both verse and prose) were “arte nuevo” [new art] or “nueva literatura” [new literature]. “Arte Nuevo” would be the exact term used by Ramón Gómez de la Serna in his seminal lecture in the Madrid Ateneo (1909), and it would also be Cansinos-Assens’ preferred name in his important article “El arte nuevo. Sus manifestaciones entre nosotros” (Cosmópolis 2, 1919), among many other examples. It is customary to equate the birth of the new, Avant-Garde Spanish prose with the launching of the collection “Nova novorum” (1926) in the publishing press of Revista de Occidente – another fundamental cultural journal, edited by the omnipresent Ortega y Gasset beginning in 1923 –. This is precisely what Gustavo Pérez Firmat does in his influential Idle Fictions: The Hispanic Vanguard Novel, 1926–1934 (1982), when he points out that …the lifespan of vanguard fiction is thus bracketed by the two editions of Jarnés’ novel [El profesor inútil]: 1926 and 1934. Before 1926 there was no general awareness of the genre, nor was there a corpus of works that could have engendered it; by 1934 – after the publication of perhaps three dozen works – the interest in this sort of fiction has all but dissipated. (29) However, it is simply erroneous to take the date of publication of the collection “Nova novorum” as the starting point of the Spanish Avant-Garde narrative. Doing so would ignore the many longer texts already published by such an important figure as Ramón Gómez de la Serna before 1926 (seven novels, to be\n\n6\n\nGregori and Herrero-Senés\n\nprecise), as well as other texts by Claudio de Torre and Valentín Andrés Alvarez; not to mention the myriad of shorter narratives published elsewhere. AvantGarde narrative in Spain, therefore, was born out of the ashes of modernist prose, manifested in the two main venues of poetic prose and critical essays, between the last half of the 1910s and the first half of the 1920s. Around 1925, there was a group of young writers who were able to publish longer AvantGarde narratives under the intellectual leadership of Ortega y Gasset and Fernando Vela (main collaborator of Ortega in Revista de Occidente), in a period that extended until the early 1930s, when the cultural climate changed, preferring a more politically-engaged literary production, and the experimentation of the Avant-Garde progressively fell out of favor. To this general picture, one has to add the impressive figure of Ramón Gómez de la Serna (1888–1963) who, coming into contact with European artistic innovations through his travels and readings, created an astonishing Avant-Garde oeuvre beginning as early as 1910 with El libro mudo and stretching until his last publication, Piso bajo, two years before his death. The writers and creators of the Spanish Avant-Garde were at the crossroads of their time, the interwar period, belonging intrinsically to it as their temporal and intellectual framework. During these twenty frantic years there was an unprecedented socio-political and cultural transformation that positioned the country on par with other European nations. Therefore, Spanish writers shared with the rest of their Western colleagues the same zeitgeist and anxieties: nihilism, a sense of crisis, epistemological skepticism, a (or the) feeling of insecurity and lack of foundation and solid values, the experience of continuous transition and the redefinition of the role of the intellectual amidst such a climate. Spanish Avant-Garde writers, open-minded and cosmopolitan, reacted by adopting the ideas and fashions of the most refreshing European trends, incorporating and adapting them to Spanish reality. They gave voice to new ways of seeing and writing that were reflected primarily in the dozens of magazines and periodicals published all over Europe and America. These creators were declared enemies of the past and felt a particular loa­ thing for the nineteenth-century heritage, romanticism and realism, and for their topical language, outdated and full of pomposity. Against this, the AvantGarde claimed an art without dogmas or transcendence, free from preconceptions and clichés. The new writers refused seriousness and any goal external to the work itself. Therefore, style gained unusual importance and every sentence, even every word, had its own autonomy and value. All of these factors ended up producing literary works with a syncopated aesthetic where brevity was key. The proclivity for conciseness had its reasons beyond the desire for linguistic\n\nIntroduction: The Cultural Pathologies of Spanish Modernism\n\n7\n\nrenewal. It was a protection against triviality, a way of opposing monolithic thought, and the clearest path to recognizing fragmentation, discontinuity and the lack of unequivocal meaning of reality itself. This aesthetics of brevity contributes to the explanation of why in Spain there were no examples of long hypertrophic works such as those by Proust, Joyce, Musil or Mann. The other key element of the new Avant-Garde style was the use of original and surprising metaphors and images. Metaphor is a creative act that reveals language as process and construct, not necessarily conditioned to referentia­ lity. Stretching referentiality, Avant-Garde authors questioned and made fun of standardized ways of looking at reality, and released language of its dependence on objects. Therefore, their texts and art works required a strong deco­ ding effort, and demanded a reader/spectator who was active and willing to face the challenge posed by the texts. It is only natural that the charge of elitism was filed against these new artistic modes. To the two main features of Avant-Garde works listed above (fragmentation and metaphor), we could also add a wide range of new procedures, among them, cinematic techniques such as montage, travelings, cubism, stream of consciousness, multiplication of narrators, simultaneity or new vocabulary utilizing neologisms, specialized language from science or sports, words from foreign languages or terms that refer constantly to new phenomena such as technology, jazz or other forms of leisure linked to mass culture. Avant-Garde writers claimed that their creations were to be judged primarily as autonomous aesthetic artifacts, but the outside reality was inevitably present, and today we can see that these works are also precious signs and documents ­concerning modernity, from the glorification of the present – in its cosmopolitanism, modernization, adventure, relaxation of morals, and release of old standards – to the exhibition and criticism of the alienating aspects of capita­ list societies on the brink of totalitarianism. To sum up, the Avant-Garde in Spain embraces a wide variety of creators, from writers and painters to architects, dancers and filmmakers, whose works exhibit traces of dadaism, futurism, surrealism, new classicism, romanticism or new objectivity, among others. The attempts to narrow its scope and ­potential – as the “generation of 1927” label did for several decades – are now over and the most productive Avant-Garde scholarship about it today is precisely the one that acknowledges its multi-faceted status and traces exchanges inside Spain and abroad, while emphasizing the fruitful connections and overlapping between genres, creators, realizations, and the public sphere. Since the 1980s, many foundational essays have been published, consolidating the critical field of the Spanish Avant-Garde and producing a scholarly recuperation among Hispanists of this cultural period in all its complexity. Suffice it to list\n\n8\n\nGregori and Herrero-Senés\n\nhere three imperative books: the aforementioned La edad de plata (1981) by José-Carlos Mainer, Domingo Ródenas’ Los espejos del novelista (1998) and Travesías vanguardistas (2009). In the 1990s and early 2000s several edited volumes were published, both in the United States and abroad, which contributed to a heightened critical awareness of the Spanish Avant-Garde: Gabriele Morelli’s Treinta años de vanguardia española (1991), Derek Harris’ The Spanish Avant-Garde (1995), Javier Pérez Bazo’s La vanguardia en España: arte y literatura (1998) and Maria T. Pao and Rafael Hernández Rodríguez’s Agítese bien: a new look at the Hispanic Avant-Gardes (2002). During these last years, the scholarly community has also witnessed the publication of an important monograph on Spanish Surrealism and an excellent feminist analysis of Avant-Garde visual culture: Robin Adèle Greeley’s Surrealism and the Spanish Civil War (2006) and Shirley Mangini’s Maruja Mallo and the Spanish Avant-Garde (2010), respectively. To these works, one must add a growing number of scholarly articles and monographs dealing with such figures as Benjamín Jarnés, Francisco Ayala, Antonio Espina or Rosa Chacel, as well as many valuable contributions on topics ranging from the urban experience, non-Castilian Spanish cultural productions of the 1920s, media, or the controversial relationship between the Avant-Garde and Fascism, among many others. In addition to this critical upsurge, several publishing projects need to be commended for their promotion of key Avant-Garde fi­­ gures. In this respect, the publication of the complete works of Ramón Gómez de la Serna by Galaxia Gutenberg (1998–2014), the complete works of Ortega y Gasset by Taurus (2004–2010), and the excellent editions of modernist and Avant-Garde writers published by Fundación Banco Santander, need to be praised here. The scholarly interest on the Spanish Avant-Garde that we have been experiencing in the last decade is, without a doubt, very promising and exciting, but in order to solidify and expand our field we need many more critical editions and English translations of key Avant-Garde texts. With the exception of the Avant-Garde poetry of Lorca (Poet in New York), Alberti (Concerning the Angels) and other important members of the so-called Generation of 1927, the sobering reality is that the vast majority of Spanish Avant-Garde writers have yet to be translated into English. Avant-Garde scholars have come a long way from the critical moors of the past, but much work still lies ahead. This edited volume, Avant-Garde Cultural Practices in Spain (1914–1936): The Challenge of Modernity, is the culmination of a project that was born out of a panel on the Hispanic Avant-Gardes during the Kentucky Foreign Languages and Cultures Conference in 2012. What started as a conversation on the culture of the 1920s, soon developed into a desire to contribute to the critical modernization of the field. We wanted to show the vitality, promise, and potential of\n\nIntroduction: The Cultural Pathologies of Spanish Modernism\n\n9\n\nAvant-Garde critical work, and – perhaps more importantly – we wanted to position the Spanish Avant-Garde squarely where it belongs: in the mainstream of European modernism. From the beginning our intention was to open up the field to a comparatist appreciation and to catch the interest of other colleagues who might not have a Hispanist training but who are curious about what was going on in the Spanish Avant-Garde culture. We have divided the articles into broad sections, understood as thematic units: Inventions, Spaces, Alterities, Intermedialities, and Politicizations. Under “Inventions,” we have grouped together two articles that deal with the critical reception of the Avant-Garde in Spain. In the opening article Domingo Ródenas addresses the question of the Avant-Garde search for a new reading public. He points out that within the Avant-Garde project lies a rather prominent need to create a new audience endowed with unique capabilities; the urge to foster a community of readers who had to be previously instructed in the way to react towards the new art. He therefore argues, in the vast literary Avant-Garde movement educating the new Man, one of the dreams of the utopianism of modernity, was the unspoken goal. Andrés Pérez-Simón, in the se­­ cond article, investigates the reception of James Joyce’s Ulysses in Spain, and how its criticism (or lack thereof) shaped the way Spaniards came to u ­ nderstand their own Avant-Garde vis-à-vis European Modernism. Under the broad term “Spaces,” we have grouped together articles that have a more theoretical slant and that aim at the study of particular currents within the Avant-Garde from a philosophical perspective. Juan Herrero-Senés, in the opening article of the section, delves into the notion of “honesty” as a fundamental goal of every Avant-Garde cultural production. By “honesty,” HerreroSenés (following Salvat Papasseit, Ortega, and Fernando Vela, among others) means the attempt to capture the world in its original purity, without artificial mediations. He argues it is in this way that the traditional understanding of mimesis started to break down and shatter in the new anti-representational paradigm of the Avant-Garde. In “1947: Nomadology, Schizoanalysis and Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s El hombre perdido,” John McCulloch explores the interconnection between theory and the Avant-Garde (recently contended by Stephen Ross in his Modernism and Theory) in Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s novel. In particular, McCulloch takes Deleuze and Guattari’s notions of “noma­ dology” and “schizoanalysis” as critical tools to study the open-endedness and the multi-layered subjective experience of inhabiting the urban space of Buenos Aires. Lastly, Eduardo Gregori, in “Things: Material Ontology in El Rastro (1914),” proposes a reading of Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s book in the light of Avant-Garde tensions between the marvelous and the quotidian. Gregori argues that this important and often neglected book anticipates not\n\n10\n\nGregori and Herrero-Senés\n\nonly many of Walter Benjamin’s critical tenets (the aura, the trace, the profane illumination…) but also Surrealism’s emphasis on the marvelous quotidian. Ramón’s Rastro is a tumultuous blend of the material refuse of modernity, but it also becomes a trace (“rastro,” in Spanish) of the object’s forgotten link with ourselves. Articulating such a lost connection is, according to Gregori, Gómez de la Serna’s aim. “Alterities” includes two articles that change their focus from a purely Castilian understanding of the Spanish Avant-Garde to a broader, polyglot reality of the Iberian Avant-Gardes. Jennifer Duprey proposes a reading of Joan Salvat Papasseit that underlines the Catalan poet’s articulation of a dialectical consciousness of form and content. Duprey contends that direct experience is constantly emphasized over the preconceived and traditional order of things in Salvat Papasseit’s poems. In the following chapter, Antonio Sáez Delgado presents an appealing argument for an Iberian interpretation of Modernism and the Avant-Garde, through an analysis of the critical and artistic dialogue between Spanish and Portuguese literatures of the period 1890–1936. The next thematic unit, “Intermedialities,” emphasizes the many ways in which Avant-Garde cultural practices effectively erased the artificial bounda­ ries between artistic genres. In her inaugural article, Rosa Berland presents a compelling study of Remedios Varo’s reimagining of her role as a woman artist, and of 1930s Barcelona as a cultural hub of the European Avant-Garde. Next, Regina Galasso studies José Moreno Villa’s Pruebas de Nueva York (1927) and Jacinta la pelirroja (1929) as two intermedial experiments where literature, photography, painting, and music attempt to capture an intimate portrait of New York. Finally, Marcos Eymar studies French texts by Picasso, Dalí and Buñuel in order to understand not only the importance of French in the deve­ lopment of the Spanish culture of the 1920s and 1930s, but also – and most importantly – the role of bilingualism and cosmopolitanism as key elements in the Avant-Garde’s overcoming of the traditional equation between nationstate and literary language. The last unit, “Politicizations,” begins with Evelyn Scaramella’s take on the Avant-Garde fascination with medieval al-Andalus and, particularly, Sephardic culture. She argues that this historical revisiting informed and expressed politi­ cal views on Spanish colonialism and Spain’s politico-cultural future. Focusing on Américo Castro’s article “Judíos,” written for the inaugural issue of Giménez Caballero’s La Gaceta Literaria (15 February 1927), Scaramella investigates how the nation’s Sephardic past triggered a number of works by scholars – Américo Castro, Emilio García Gómez and José Ortega y Gasset – as well as writers like Ernesto Giménez Caballero and Rafael Cansinos-Assens, among others. The last article of the section, and of our book, is Lynn Purkey’s “Disarming Prince\n\nIntroduction: The Cultural Pathologies of Spanish Modernism\n\n11\n\nCharming: Los Príncipes iguales as Subversive Fairy Tale.” Hers is a critical rea­ ding of Joaquín Arderius’ Los príncipes iguales (1928), a text that subverts formulaic aspects of the fairy tale through ridicule, caricature and irony, ultimately destabilizing the traditional discourse of prince charming and the institution of monarchy at large. Drawing on Bakhtin’s theories of the novel and the carnivalesque, Purkey examines the subversion of the fairy tale genre in Arderius’ text as part of a general cultural tendency towards popular art, which would become manifest during the Second Republic. It is our hope that this book might contribute to the growing critical field of the Spanish Avant-Garde while also highlighting the new and exciting scholarship carried out by Hispanists and Comparatists working on modern Spanish culture. We also hope that our book might normalize critical conversations on the Spanish Avant-Garde, allowing a fruitful (re)discovery of Spain in the gene­ ral culture of European modernism.

The novelty of their codes, often defined as a challenge to the established languages or as provocation to the public at large, may explain the difficulty of assimilating the most innovative works. However, within the AvantGarde project of remaking art lies a rather prominent need to create a new audience, a group of readers endowed with unique capabilities, excellent and minority readers who had to be instructed. Therefore, within the vast literary Avant-Garde movement was the unspoken goal of educating the new man, one of the utopian dreams of modernity.\n\n…\n\nPaul Valéry wrote in his Notebooks that ever since speed had conquered mo­­ dern life, “everyone tends to read exclusively what everyone could have written.” In Valéry’s opinion, however, a writer’s aspiration should be to turn their rea­­ders into creators of sorts, criticizing their old ways, their mental laziness or even their inadequate intelligence. Valéry defined in this quotation two images of the reader that would appear in almost every discussion on the Avant-Garde: the passive reader, comfortable in obsolete ways of reading and entrenched in the conventions of traditional and old literature, and, opposed to that image, the ready and active reader who contributes by completing the meaning of the poetic or narrative text, even when the text violates the norms that regulated previous literary writing. No writer, Avant-Garde or otherwise, wants their readers to be satisfied with the already known and the already predictable; but Valéry goes beyond the logical preference for the reader who values broken expectations. Valéry wants writers to teach their readers by fighting their comfortable inertia, blocking their known exit lines, challenging their intelligence. In sum, he wanted them to challenge readers by modifying their exegetic practices. And that goal is an intrinsic part of the Avant-Garde project: the creation of a readership that did not exist before, especially in Spain. Even by 1928, when the stage of the most effervescent Avant-Garde (that of Ultraísmo and Creacionismo) had long been finished, Federico García Lorca\n\n© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi 10.1163/9789004310186_003\n\n16\n\nde Moya\n\nimagines a farewell to the Old Art and its substitution by the New Art. In his prose poem “Nadadora sumergida,” he describes the farewell to a decrepit love representing Old Art saying: “Since then I abandoned the old literature that I had so successfully practiced. It is necessary to break it all so that dogmas are purified and rules acquire a new shivering” (García Lorca 1928: 495). That call to break it all, to purify the principles and reinvent the laws (the norms) of art was nothing new, but rather shared many elements of the iconoclast and radical discourse that was almost twenty years old, if we consider its beginning as either Marinetti’s 1909 futurist manifesto or its Spanish translation by Ramón Gómez de la Serna. A nihilist discourse (“it is necessary to break it all”) that had given way to a more constructive discourse (“we must build a new art over the ruins of the old art”) and that, by then, 1928, was dragging on like an old, yet still functional cliché. Literary history is articulated by creating new traditions once the past has been rejected and discarded. But the success of a new aesthetic language, peripheral or non-hegemonic, is not completely possible until its practitioners have won over or conquered an audience beyond their own circle of initiates, taking root therefore as a dominant option (or established at the center) whereby the proposal of today wants to project itself into the future as a proposal that comes from yesterday (Lotman 1996: 28). The “conquest of the audience” has been part of the ordinary fight of artists and writers since Romanticism, and has lived many sweet and sour episodes, as is the case with any mutuallydependent relationship. The incorporation of the creator to the field of artistic activity has tended to happen between two opposing imperatives: (1) the vindication of an artistic language radically different from the established norm and, consequently, hardly understandable by an audience educated in the domina­ ting modes; and (2) the creation of an audience that would favor their social homologation, and with it, their economic independence. New artists have tended to offer a product for which previous demand did not exist, and for its acceptance they could only count on the complicity of other new artists and those mediators (editors, critics, mentors and patrons…), interested in moving away from the proposals of the canon and the conventional. The most important disagreement between creators and audience happened at the beginning of the 20th century with the different Avant-Garde movements, when the public incomprehension of the new styles opened a chasm of indifference and rejection. Artists could make a virtue out of necessity, and turn the silence of the audience into a sign of identity and gregarious acknowledgement, but such an entrenchment in their own difference and the disdain of the obtuse and shortsighted public was not conducive to expanding their market. Unpopularity became a sign of aesthetic distinction, but the pu­­ blic was shut off from the understanding of modern art. The difficulty of this\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n17\n\nnew artistic product became the safe conduit to access a literary practice that was identified with the most advanced exploration of modernity, which appealed to the readers’ intelligence over their sentimental disposition (Diepeveen 2003). Some writers, nonetheless, were able to perceive the on­­ going cultural transformations since the late 19th century, always in growing democratization and opening to new audiences, a process that forced the writer to eliminate his elitist resistance as well as to accept the role that marketing was to develop in the construction of his public image and the success of his professional task. Ramón Gómez de la Serna was one of the first to understand this phenomenon, and he started to create his own recognizable trademark at the same time that he diversified his writing to make a significant part of it accessible to the public at large (Dennis 2009: 201–206), be that in the atomic form of his greguerías or in his short novels published in popular narrative collections, of which I will have more to say afterwards. These exceptions notwithstanding, the Avant-Garde writer tended to validate “the old duel between nineteenth-century artists, confronted to the simplicity of their bourgeois public, and the popularly-accepted arts (which would later be called art for the masses)” (Puelles Romero 2011: 265) in such a way that this antagonism was irreversible. Rejecting the bourgeoisie on one side and the masses on the other, modern art had no more audience than that of the experts, formed by the artists themselves and by the critics and theoreticians that played the role of interpreters and propagandists. In 1921, Jean Epstein wrote these words, which were to become famous in Spain due to Ortega y Gasset’s paraphrasing, at the beginning of La poésie d’aujourd’hui: “Il y a deux clas(s)es de gens: ceux qui comprennent et les autres” (1921: 6) [There are two types of people: those who understand and the others]. But Epstein’s statement did not imply a banishment of those who didn’t understand, but rather the starting point of a determinist distinction between a lite­ rature for minorities and another for majorities: “Il y a aussi deux littératures. Aucune république n’y fera rien. La physiologie crée une minorité de sensibilités aristocratiques et tout un peuple d’organismes vulgaires.” (1921:6) [There are also two literatures. No republic will fix this. Physiology creates a minority of aristocratic sensibilities and entire people of vulgar organisms]. According to Epstein, the spread of literacy in modern society had produced a majority of readers (a mass of readers) lacking sensitivity but overflowing with sentimentality, a majority which was to be fed the “sub literature” of feuilleton that marked the main tendency of the market. “La civilisation […] après avoir diminué les énergies de son aristocratie, finit par atteindre aussi celles de la masse” (11–12) [Civilization […] after decreasing the energies of its aristocracy, eventually reaching as those of the mass]. There exist in coexistence, therefore,\n\n18\n\nde Moya\n\na monotonous and formulaic production destined to the masses, and some minority products that Epstein identifies as modern art, whose essential cha­ racteristics are “l’à peu pres et la schématisation” [the roughly and schematization] which “ne sont point des synonymes” [are not synonyms] (48), given that “l’aproximation est un défaut d’exactitude où on sousentend: nonchalance, paresse, ignorance ou fatigue,” [the approximation is a lack of accuracy invol­ ving nonchalance, laziness, ignorance or fatigue] at the same time that the “schéma est une simplification voulou, artificielle où on supprime une bonne partie des accesoires” [scheme is a reached and artificial simplification in which many accessories are removed]. In this way, Epstein understands that the vast majority of the audience is not capable (or willing) to understand these texts that are not artificial in style and are elusive in their presentation of their possible worlds. Nevertheless, when the reader can think that sensitivity and intelligence suffice to be part of the exquisite audience that is opposed to the masses, Epstein clarifies that such qualities “ne suffisent pas toujours à la compréhension des auteurs modernes,” [are not always sufficient for understan­ ding the modern authors] because “il y faut encore unce certaine érudition que contribue davantage encore à limiter leur public” (1921: 63) [they demand a certain erudition which further contributes to limiting their audience]. The grammatical freedoms – sometimes frankly gymnastic – and the associative games of modern literature demand a cultivated reader, one that is predisposed to modify his reading methods as one would accept changing the rules of a game. In actuality, “aujourd’hui le lecteur qui manque d’habitudes littéraires et de culture, ne pourra suivre les auteurs modernes où il aura voulu pénétrer tout à trac et il se cassera le nez parce qu’il n’aura point quelque deux ou trois mille lectures préalables à son actif” (1921: 65) [now the reader that lacks literary habits and culture will not be able to follow the modern authors and if he persists he will break his nose because he does not have two or three thousand readings to his credit]. Bound to break his nose in trying, the audience turned his back to the difficult, hermetic, and confusing literature of the esprit nouveau. It is well known that Ortega, upon writing his diagnosis of the characteristics of the New Art in 1924, started his essay La deshumanización del arte with an epigraph entitled “Unpopularity of the New Art” (1925: 353–356). In it, he admitted to have discovered the impossibility of separating the aesthetic consideration of the Avant-Garde from the sociological aspects it entails, that is, from its potential readers, themselves an immense minority. The New Art, in his opinion, “is not for everyone,” and it causes the effect of dividing the public in “two sides: one – minimal – formed by the limited number of those who favor it; other – majoritarian, innumerable – hostile” (354). Later on, Ortega\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n19\n\nwould add that these two groups constitute two human castes: those who understand because “they possess an organ of understanding” and those who don’t and get upset for it (the ‘masses’) as they have been denied that “organ of understanding.” His whole essay is structured from that point onwards to the analysis of the reasons for that fracture in the audience. This idea, resonating with Jean Epstein’s argument, had already been stated in March 1921 in a short essay, “Musicalia,” where Ortega reflected on the reasons why the music of Debussy or Stravinsky were less well-liked that that of Mendelssohn. He started with the realization that “everything new is not popular,” adding that “there are things that are still unpopular even at old age” (1921a: 237), which implies that the elements that prevent the approval of the majority of the public are constitutive and not circumstantial. This fact led him to point out that there are whole unpopular cultures, arguing that modern culture is extremely unpopular in all its manifestations, be they scientific (and he mentions the new physics) or artistic. But its unpopularity is not caused, in his opi­ nion, by its complexity but rather by the opposing spiritual attitude between the new artists and the general public. While the public celebrates the matching of any given work with their own sensibility, the new art forces the reader to substitute that interiorization of the object for an “outward concentration” (245), that is, for a distanced contemplation which favors the judgment of aesthetic beauty, a predominantly intellectual experience, without sentimental contagions. In his analysis, Ortega traced the reasons for the unpopularity and the difficulty of the New Art to the realm of the spiritual hierarchy. He stressed the higher sensibility of the artist vis-à-vis the public, but above all the need for the New Art readership to be on a par with its practitioners, constituting all of them as a select minority towards which the masses will always show incomprehension and hostility. This argument resonated with Ortega’s doctrine on minorities as pivotal centers of historical and cultural changes, but it was far from reality; the New Art was much more challenging in its codes than romanticism or realism, and the difficulty of its techniques and processes could not just be conquered by being part of an elite, but rather required training in those compositional modes. To use Bourdieu’s terms, what was at stake was an inadequacy between the habitus of the readership and that of the writers. The interpretative scheme of the audience should be expanded and modified (Bourdieu 1980: 93) so that the new artistic proposals could have any possibi­ lity to be decoded and later accepted or rejected. Without the assimilation of the rules, which inspire the new artistic practices, there is no possibility of appreciation because these rules have not been integrated in that “structuring structure organizing the practices and the perception of practices” that is the habitus (Bourdieu 1980: 169).\n\n20\n\nde Moya\n\nAntonio Marichalar explored the topic of the readership’s resistance to the Avant-Garde in 1926, one year after the publication of La deshumanización del arte. He did it in his essay “Girola,” which was originally a presentation at the Modern Art Museum where he even corrected Ortega without mentioning him. He begins yet again with the confrontation of mimetic art – understandable for most audiences, who recognize in it their own perception of reality (including their emotions and feelings) – and the New Art, which comes to stir – he says – a purely aesthetic fiber, and not a human or vital one: “If some spectators feel indignation, or laughter, it is because they are not ready yet; because they have not penetrated into the work of art deeply enough to be in a position to understand it, and acquire the right to judge it” (1926: 23). But Marichalar does not think that these spectators lack an “organ of comprehension,” rather he thinks they are too lazy: “what cannot be done is rejecting a work without having used, at least, a minimum of intelligence.” And the initial surprise that every AvantGarde work causes is just the indication that a new focus is needed – even an infantile regression of unconditioned perception – by the audience. Marichalar is even more clear: “It is not lack of intelligence that prevents the penetration of the mystery, but rather lack of humility and elemental desire” to understand. Or, in other words, not going beyond effortless routines: “Today’s spectators are everywhere dozing off in a wing chair,” and from this cushioned vantage point, they look suspiciously at creative art, and let themselves be fooled by all sorts of sensationalisms. The ideal audience for the New Art, on the other hand, has erased all previously-acquired norms, has un-learned everything that limits their apprehension until their mind is like a child’s, someone for whom nothing is strange because everything is new. Therefore, “every little thing would be a true discovery, unprecedented in the archive of their empty memory; and since everything would be new and different, everything would enrich them” (1926: 25). It is obvious that this type of purified reader is an idealization, but it nevertheless points toward the direction I’m interested in: the need to promote this readership or, even better, the need to create it, to furnish its sensibility, that is to say, to purify it from any conditions that keep it rigid. One can only apprecia­ ­te modern aesthetics with renewed senses, teaching them to overcome formal difficulties: “modern sensibility feels that this initial point of resistance with which one stumbles is the point that, in order to move the world, demands the aesthetic leverage” (1926: 30). Marichalar’s essay was disseminated starting in June 1926 and his ideas resonate, like those of Ortega, in other essayists who insist upon reflecting on the difficult reception of the new artistic forms. Fernando Vela’s celebrated essay “El arte al cubo” starts with a paradoxical statement: The Sinfonietta, by Ernesto Halffter, “was applauded precisely because it was not understood” (Vela 1927: 95).\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n21\n\nIncomprehension as the origin of acceptance, an incomprehension due to the fact that the audience only paid attention to its sonority (much in the same way that they look at the colors and shapes of a painting or the words and plot of a story) and not to the game with musical tradition that constituted the hidden skill of Sinfonietta’s modernity. Modern art is unconcerned with that primary level of perception, rather it aims at a complex decoding that shifts those traditional elements that are parodied and mocked, as it challenges the viewer to overcome its structural perplexity. That is why Vela considers that “the typical trait of modern art is the unveiled presentation of all its problems” (98), pointing out that “to a large extent, modern art exists as an answer to its predecessor,” that is, that tradition is already presupposed in modern art, it is already constituted as prerequisite for its semantic meaning. These two characteristics, self-referentiality and ironic subversion of tradition, put up a wall of difficulty for its potential audience. According to Vela, only irony can relieve this over flow of semiotic content, (these terms are obviously not his own), in an art that only admits a detached, intellectual apprehension, an apprehension far removed from the numbness caused by the connection with pathos. Therefore, he wonders at the end: “Are we in such a situation that music needs to evoke previous music and, on top of it, make fun of its own evocations? Does form need deformation and rhythm its opposite in such a way that no artistic component is directly enjoyed, but always indirectly […]?” (99). His answer is that art has never been innocent and that the aesthetic enjoyment – that is, the effect of its perception on the audience – is always born “out of the awareness of a duplicity,” that of the evoked tradition and the ludic irony with which it is evoked, at least in modern art. Vela’s analysis matches Ortega’s in their diagnosis of modern art as a mino­ rity product, but Vela refines his opinion in pointing out that it is an art that postulates a type of readership that is educated and able to recognize the cons­ titutive elements of tradition (forms, genres, themes and motifs) and ready to enjoy aesthetically with the re-use (or deconstruction) of such elements. As George Steiner observed, “A Mann, a Joyce, a Pound, or a Stravinsky may ‘invent backwards’,” counterposing “modernity of technical means and expectations against a reborn presence of the distant archetype” (Steiner 2002: 268). In any case, we again find the reasons why Avant-Garde art cannot be popular. Vela is not too far removed from the ideas that T.S. Eliot had expressed seven years before in “Tradition and the Individual Talent” regarding the impossibility to understand an artist if one doesn’t take into consideration their tradition, be that through continuation or reaction: “No poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone. His significance, his appreciation is the appreciation of his relation to the dead poets and artists. You cannot value him alone; you\n\n22\n\nde Moya\n\nmust set him, for contrast and comparison, among the dead” (Eliot 1932: 15). The deterrent for its adequate reception occurred because the readership of modern literature lacked, generally speaking, the necessary knowledge to locate the new work among the work of the dead, and, at the same time, value its different relations across texts, in Genette’s words (1982). Eliot’s acknow­ ledgement of this difficulty is revealed by the fact that he added a number of erudite notes to The Waste Land destined to give the reader all the connections with previous literature, a knowledge that – presumably – his readers lacked. This “contamination anxiety,” as novelist Jonathan Lethem has called it (2012: 98), was not common to all modern creators, many of whom accepted – with pride or resignation – the necessary selective character of their readership. That was the case of, for instance, Hermann Broch, who in some critical notes to Der Tod des Vergil (published posthumously), proudly accepts his minority condition, pointing out that “correctly understood, not ‘darkness’ nor ‘incomprehensibility’ undermine a work’s worth” (Broch 1955: 335), and he even ascertains, with a very modernist intellectual aristocratism, that “darkness is little less than a glorious hue.” Broch reframes the issue from a work’s comple­ xity to the incompetence of its readership, in consonance with other previously reviewed discourses. Moreover, he links the mismatch between artistic object and audience with the confusion produced by every break in established models: “It cannot come as a surprise, therefore, that every new artistic form causes the impression of a monstrous difficulty among its contemporaries, a complexity that will become the more incomprehensible the less their capacity to see and understand the imperious need that reclaims its presence” (337). Broch, during late Modernity, assumes that modern art’s complexity constitutes an “imperious need,” as if the laws of persistence of the institution of art might imply such a need. It’s not necessary to discuss that evolutionary and ecological notion of art according to which art is transformed by changing its internal and external morphology so as to survive in a (social) means that changes constantly. What interests me here, regardless of its veracity, is that the majority of the readership tended to render unnecessary those changes in the morphology of art and, as a consequence, tended to reject them, be that with their contempt, mockery or even grudge of those who felt excluded. And perhaps it’s not superfluous to state the obvious here: such a break had started with Romanticism and not with the 20th-century Avant-Gardes, as one can see in the laughter and indignation caused in 1863 by, respectively, Olympia and Le dejeuner sur l’herbe by Édouard Manet (Bataille 2003: 26). With an audience coarsened by ignorance and conventionalities, modern artists were forced to disdain those readers while thinking about training, or even creating, their ideal readership. Given the reality of the lack of an optimal public, they simply had to invent one.\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n23\n\nOther Voices, Other Publics\n\nNevertheless, such a public did exist. Clearly not as a sophisticated audience able to discern the interpretive rules of modern art, but it certainly existed as a community of narrative readers. It is important to remember at this time that there was a commercial and literary operation that proved that such a readership existed but had yet to be conquered. The battle for its conquest was fought before the Avant-Garde audacity would split the audience between those rea­ ders who “get it” and those who “don’t,” but it occurred alongside the first part of Ramón Gómez de la Serna’s work. It was a bloodless battle that in January of 1907 allowed the launching of a successful business: a collection of short perio­ dical novels written by well-known authors and intended for a not-so-­cultivated middle class that had considerable means and a strong wish to acquire a certain cultural veneer. With such premises, Eduardo Zamacois created El Cuento Semanal at a price that was prohibitive for many back then: 30 cents (Magnien 1986). He very much knew what he was doing because this project became so successful that it spurred many other similar collections. What is interesting here is that the readership that El Cuento Semanal addressed was limited (due to economic reasons), but the potential market for those who might enjoy these narratives was much bigger. Zamacois couldn’t achieve his goals due to the suicide of his equity partner, Antonio Galiardo, and the long legal battle that ensued with his widow for the management of the company. Zamacois resigned, and in January of 1909 launched an identical collection, even in terms of its physical format: Los Contemporáneos survived until 1926 and published almost nine hundred issues (Cabello 2012). Nine years later, in 1916, yet another collection was created, La Novela Corta, which – without significant changes in its authors – offered the same texts for a sixth of the original price, only 5 cents (Mogin-Martin 2007). These collections were very popular and they sought, above all, the reader who would not dare come into a bookstore yet was willing to buy magazines at a kiosk. The example of kiosk short novels illustrates well the operation of “conquest” of a potentially preexistent readership. Quite different was the situation of the Avant-Garde narrators, even though some did collaborate in these collections, starting with the first among them, Ramón Gómez de la Serna. They could not even raise the question of the conquest of their readership as long as their audience was limited to the interpretive community composed of the young writers themselves so often playing the role of both producers and consumers, creators and critics of their own work. Those young writers who had assumed the aesthetic program of international Modernism experienced that incomprehension that Ortega, and so many after him, was talking about in 1921. Benjamín Jarnés, in the 1930s, wrote\n\n24\n\nde Moya\n\nin his private notebooks that “the only authentic position is this: to write as if the readers did not exist, without any intention to please or disdain them” (Jarnés 1988: 26). That is, to write for an inexistent or virtual readership, an imaginary community of readers able to understand and appreciate the type of elliptical, self-referential and anti-sentimental literature they claimed and practiced. At that same time, in a letter to Carlos Fortuny, Jarnés regrets that Spanish writers were forced to reduce their intellectual size in order to make it similar “to their readers’. One writes for the readers, understanding them not as the real readers, but as those invented by a publisher or a businessman…” (Jarnés 2003: 424). It’s certainly ironic that Jarnés would express his complaint to one of the most successful erotic writers of his time, Álvaro Retana, who wrote under the pen name Carlos Fortuny in his collaborations with abc, and who represented precisely the type of writer most detested by the Avant-Garde writer: the one who spurs the expectations – and the low passions – of the masses. In any case, the invention of a readership by the publishing industry was much more feasible than the invention of a cultivated and competent readership by the writers themselves. Jarnés reflects at times upon the ambivalence of the Avant-Garde writer who wishes to have the large readership of a popular writer. His position shows how hard it was for a novelist to assume that “the heretical break with assumed artistic traditions finds its authentication criteria in disinterestedness” (Bourdieu 1995: 320). The task of inventing a readership was a pedagogical one because one had to teach the readers to read from another vantage point, and even without a vantage point at all; blindly, that is, deconstructing their acquired prejudices like searching for external references or looking for correspondences between text and reality. In sum, one had to educate the readers in a non-figurative, nonlinear, non-analogical and non-metonymical representation. One had to teach them to understand (i.e., to decode) their discourse. And then, even more difficult, one had to persuade the readers of the aesthetic value of one’s work. It was necessary, in other words, to take the reader from a poetics of familiarity to a poetics of estrangement, in which the artistic object becomes unrecogni­ zable and, therefore, autonomous. One had to make the invented readership enjoy the new work, which was not offered to them as a reflection of experience but as an artifact that gene­ rated experience. Antonio Espina remarked that the New Art “has suddenly demanded of readers, in order to be understood and enjoyed, a great effort. First their attention, then their intelligence, and finally their whole consciousness” (Espina 1927: 39). Such an effort to understand and enjoy modern art demanded a similar pedagogical effort, but such a task was alien to the radical Avant-Garde, which was satisfied with the denunciation of institutional art\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n25\n\nand its contempt for all those who do not understand, the masses and the plebeians. That educational factor, however, was an evident sign of most Spanish writers of the 1920s. And this is not a puzzling fact because it can easily be explained by the discipular relationship they all kept with José Ortega y Gasset and with the ambitious program of social pedagogy that the philosopher stated and carried out since he first articulated it publicly in Bilbao’s El sitio.1 A titanic task of national modernization but a task for which many intellectuals from two different generations took a stand, nonetheless, because it was necessary to start all engines in order to pull the nation from its traditional immobilization, in order to advance through the highways of modernity. One had to topple down and build, challenge and cement, defend an exquisite literary practice and engender a cultivated readership.\n\nCreating the Audience\n\nLiterature, and narrative in particular, needed a renovation in line with new international aesthetic forms. In that regard, the journal España – founded in 1915 by Ortega y Gasset – played a seminal role and, in its pages, so did the lite­ rary criticism of Enrique Díez-Canedo and the musical criticism of Adolfo Salazar; the collaborations of José Moreno Villa or Ramón Gómez de la Serna, even though Ramón’s influence would be fundamental, given that it was disseminated among journals, and in book-length format, since 1917. Since October 1918, moreover, there existed in Seville the journal Grecia, under the leadership of Isaac del Vando Villar, even though its transformation in the headquarters of Ultraísmo would not occur until 1919, months after Rafael Cansinos Assens stated in a famous interview for El Parlamentario in December 1918 (with Xavier Bóveda) that it was imperative to overcome fin-de-siècle decadence and that the way to achieve it should be the eclectic assimilation of all new stimuli. Just three months afterwards, the believers of the religion of novelty published their Ultra manifesto in the Madrid press, and in the Spring of 1919 they celebrated the first ultraist party at the Seville Ateneo, all the while casting their nets to colonize the journal Cervantes that had been founded by a modernist, Francisco Villaespesa, in 1916, or appropriating the journal Cosmópolis which had been launched by Enrique Gómez Carrillo. For two years, the effervescence of young ultraístas, (in occasional confusion and 1 A cultural association that promoted public lectures by well-known writers and intellectuals of the time. Many key Spanish cultural figures visited El sitio, like Unamuno and Ortega, among others. Translator’s note.\n\n26\n\nde Moya\n\ndispute with Vicente Huidobro’s Creacionismo, and under the protection of Cansinos Assens), animated the literary field, but their production had no larger audience than that of the receptive community that they themselves constituted. On January 1921, the literary magazine Ultra was published. It was the culmination of the new energies, gathering together familiar names in other ultra journals with some that came from the publications by Ortega y Gasset, like Adolfo Salazar. It was again a minority platform representing the aesthetic rebelliousness of a group of young writers striving to harmonize the claims of cubism with a vague and apolitical Dadaism introduced by Guillermo de Torre. Evidently, this was not a journal conceived as an instrument for its potential readership but rather as a collective organ of group expression and identification. Its minority character could have created in Ortega y Gasset the transitory illusion of associating his concept of political aristocratism (his confidence in national leading elites, in every field) with that minority of nonconformist youth. Surprisingly, in December of that same year, 1921, Ultra published a text by Ortega, the speech he had delivered the previous November at Pombo in order to thank Gómez de la Serna for the banquet he organized in his honor. It is a text of well-measured words where he clearly shows his lack of confidence in those shaggy vanguardists to consolidate a real and lasting aesthetic relay, through which there would arise the possibility of creating new audiences. If he regards them as “the last barricade” it is because he believes the war to be over: “You have demolished the last, almost imperceptible vestiges of literary tradition, and before your very eyes the land is again flat and deserted” (Ortega 1921b: 2). But in that sandlot it won’t be them who will build up the New Art, but rather a younger generation: “Far away, I think I can see other men, even younger men than you are. A next generation, in which a new anti-liberal sense of life begins to vibrate. Loving all the hierarchies, the disciplines, the norms, they’ll start to gather together building blocks to demand a new tradition” (2). We can only imagine the astonishment of those who understood the anticipated retirement that Ortega was preparing for them. By then two more journals that appealed to the intention to create a select readership had already appeared, but none of its editors conformed to the youth announced by Ortega. They were Indice and La Pluma. The former had been launched months before, in July of 1921, by Juan Ramón Jiménez with the help of Alfonso Reyes, who was in Madrid at the time, and the painter and printer Gabriel García Maroto. The journal, of which only four issues were published, wanted to be a venue for the new creators that aligned themselves with the high calls of rigor and discipline demanded by Ortega, or with the claims for excellence that Eugenio d’Ors had defended in 1915 at the\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n27\n\nResidencia de Estudiantes in his conference Aprendizaje y heroísmo. No ultraist could have a place in the journal, only the constructive talents capable of articulating the fundamental elements of a new potential tradition would. Guillermo de Torre tried unsuccessfully to publish in Indice, (today we can read the pathetic letters he wrote to Juan Ramón), but it was all in vain. In contrast, all of these young writers, (in addition to older ones), published there: Pedro Salinas and Jorge Guillén, Dámaso Alonso and García Lorca, José Bergamín and Gerardo Diego, Adolfo Salazar and Juan Chabás, the older brothers José Moreno Villa, Corpus Barga and Alfonso Reyes himself, as well as Antonio Marichalar, who would become a crucial link in the internatio­ nalization of the group through his friendship with Valéry Larbaud (to whom he sent a copy of the journal). There we can find some of the very first examples of the new fiction, like “Un conocido por conocer” by Salinas (which, incidentally, is not included in the 2007 edition of his complete works), where we can read many of the characteristics of modern (or modernist) narrative. And the elitist spirit that they all shared can be attested to by one of the youngest collaborators, who would later conquer a larger audience indeed, Federico García Lorca. He writes, in a letter to his parents dated on March of 1921 when he already knows of Juan Ramón’s acceptance of his work for the journal, “I feel better equipped as a poet every day, as a pure poet, as an exquisite artist. That is what one must become. Every day I detest a bit more the vulgarity and the acclamation of the ignorant” (García Lorca 1997: 704). Those are the framing terms of the new artist: exquisite and pure, rejecting the ignorance of readers. La Pluma, in its turn, had been born some months before that, (specifically, in June 1920), directed by Manuel Azaña and his future brother-in-law, Cipriano Rivas Cherif, perhaps influenced by a recent stay in the Paris of Cocteau, the Russian ballets of Diaghilev, and Darius Milhaud. The exhilaration of the new had conquered them and that anti conventional spirit can be felt in “Dos pa­­ labras que no están de más” from the first issue, as well as in the note closing the journal: “This journal will not count with the collaboration of…” Ortega y Gasset and Eugenio d’Ors, among others. But beyond that light iconoclastic veneer, the pedagogical impulse is key here; the intention to create a body of intelligent readers, informed of the ongoing cultural changes of the time, particularly in the arts. So, in that first issue of La Pluma we find several authors who are later contributors to Indice: Díez-Canedo, Pedro Salinas, Adolfo Salazar and Alfonso Reyes, while in later issues (up to 1920) we read – among the laurea­te names of turn-of-the-century writers – those of Jorge Guillén, Antonio Espina, Francisco Vighi and Moreno Villa, to whom we must add in January of 1921 Valentín Andrés Álvarez and Lorca. They all shared the implicit project of\n\n28\n\nde Moya\n\ncreating a Spanish readership that was both discerning and receptive to the intellectual novelties of the new century. That is why in 1923, when Ortega launches – with the help of Fernando Vela – Revista de Occidente, he would enroll many of his peers from Indice, and evidently also from España and the newspaper El Sol. Until 1926 the new journal would publish narrative texts or prose poems at the same time that other, more literary journals were doing it too. Ortega and Vela contacted many writers whose profiles seemed to be compatible with the editorial line of the journal. They searched for writers with both an acute critical sense (to maintain their review section), but also with a creative talent that would allow them to articulate a new fictional and non-fictional prose. They found that profile from the beginning in Corpus Barga, Antonio Marichalar, and Antonio Espina, to whom they would add newer talents later on. That was exactly the case with Benjamin Jarnés in 1925, after his collaboration in many youth journals during several years and the publication of a short story in Plural, or with Guillermo de Torre after the publication of his Literaturas europeas de vanguardia. The journal aspired to educate an elite by disseminating modernity’s intellectual currents and aesthetic movements. That implied the modification of the audience’s expectancies and its familiarization with the new codes of modernism. The disdain for those who do not understand or those who flatly reject their new art, represented by the image of the putrefacto [i.e., putrid] derived from Ultraísmo, is common for all of this youth. However, it is not only the putrefacto who is excluded from their audience but also the uninformed bourgeoisie, and, without a doubt, the working class. The alliance with this public would arrive very soon, around 1929, and abundantly during the following decade (Santonja 1989), but not in the middle of the 1920s.\n\nA Tough Code to Break\n\nNew Art’s narrative fiction during these years, between 1923 and 1929, had dreams of purity. It aspired to an aesthetic similar to that of poetry. It wanted to be poiesis, an autonomous creation, but it also aimed to produce that poiesis in its audience, to select and mold it. That dislodged narrative assumed a poe­ tics of estrangement which could puzzle the reader, as well as the axiom that the work’s incomprehension does not abate its beauty, like Brémond had stated: “It’s not that I praise nonsense; I merely point out that lack of sense does not necessarily imply lack of poetry” (Abril 1933: 60). What had changed were the forms (techniques and procedures) and the structure, but the topics remained essentially the same; like Shklovsi had remarked, a “new artistic form\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n29\n\ndoes not appear to express a new content, but rather to replace an old form that has already lost its artistic value” (Eichenbaum 1970: 35). And, in the case of narrative, that old form was the one representing a 19th century paradigm. In contrast with this, the Avant-Garde text became a fragment or a tile. Not in the fragment of the romantic tradition, but in the synecdoche that includes a body which remains invisible. If we compare realist narration to a (corporeal) boy that is complete, then the Avant-Garde offered up a portion of this body, implying a lack of totality, opposing this totality on all fronts: against the unique effect it searches for a multiple and constant effect; against the structuring conflict, it prefers its omission, abstraction or multiplication; against a visible plot, it prefers ellipsis or parody. The transgression of the mimetic paradigm is arti­ culated on the formal, semantic and pragmatic levels. It is also articulated in its rhetorical elaboration, in the configuration of the world it creates, and in the perlocutionary effect of the text which does not consist in inducing the readers to an act of recognition of an extra textual reality, nor an emotive identification with a given character, but in the shattering of their expectations, in the attack against their cognitive schemes, in surprise and shock. The transgression of these basic structural elements of every story can themselves justify a narrative text that substitutes its characters for objects, its action for a static landscape, and the only outcome for several alternative endings, like in the case of “La verdad saliendo del pozo” by Benjamín Jarnés (1928: 2). The objective was the creation of an autonomous and self-sufficient work, free from referential servitude to external reality, cohesive in its own rules often implicit in the text. Salinas’s short story “Mundo cerrado” (1926: 7–28) can illustrate this principle on a metafictional level whereby the artistic work constitutes its own free reality in which the transient experience is trapped. But this story also illustrates another compositional principle: the fragmentary nature of the text, operating as synecdoche of a larger narrative discourse. “Mundo cerrado,” which is an entirely independent narration, can also be read as an integral part of Víspera del gozo, and even as a sign of Víspera del gozo. This double condition of the Avant-Garde short story is verified in dozens of texts that were published as independent narrations only to be later dovetailed into a larger narrative frame. And a clear example of this are the accompanying titles of Salinas’s in the Nova Novorum collection: Benjamín Jarnés’s El profesor inútil and Paula y Paulita; as well as Antonio Espina’s Pájaro Pinto and, perhaps less so, his Luna de copas. That collection (Nova Novorum) was endorsed – rather unconvincingly – by Ortega in 1926, only to be cancelled in 1929. Their editions were modest, ranging between 1,000 and 1,500 copies. The potential readership, therefore, was very limited. To this we must add the fact that some copies were shipped to Buenos Aires, México and La Habana, where there existed groups of young\n\n30\n\nde Moya\n\nwriters who shared with their Spanish peers a feeling of brotherhood in their quest for a modern aesthetic and an intellectual aristocratism. Avant-Garde writers were located in a field of opposing forces: on the one hand, the wish for novelty above all; on the other hand, the call to structural cohesiveness and the configuration of a new tradition. This call for order did not come only from Ortega and D’Ors, not even from Jean Cocteau’s rappel a l’ordre; it was a general conviction since the early 1920s. In 1923, Marichalar could state that “today we are possessed by a strong desire of classicism,” and earlier still, in 1921, Vicente Huidobro proclaimed from the editorial pages of his bilingual journal Création/Creación that “The period of destruction is over; now let us start a time of creation.” Ortega, in March of that same year, explained how such a constructive task was only appropriate for the chosen ones. He wrote in an article in El Sol, to which I referred above (“Musicalia”), where he defended the music without listeners of Debussy against the “expression of the sentimental commonplace” of Mendelssohn’s romanticism, concluding in violent terms that “whatever is worth anything on this Earth has been made by a handful of few select men, in spite of the general public, in hard fight against the stupidity and the grudge of the masses” (Ortega 1921a: 236). Harsh words to express an intellectual attitude that his collaborators and peers at the tertulia of Revista de Occidente would know all too well, and which would be disseminated, in a more diplomatic fashion, through important essays like Ernst Robert Curtius “Restauración de la razón” in 1927. The new writers had been convinced that their work came from a privileged minority and would hardly exceed that same minority. José Moreno Villa, in his me­­ moirs, counted the members of such an elite in Madrid as one hundred, in his remembrance of the “renaissance murmur” that he had experienced for twenty years: “Living like this is worthwhile. A hundred first-rate people working with enthusiasm and commitment” (Moreno Villa 1976: 141). However, not even those one hundred egregious individuals can be said to constitute the readership that the Avant-Garde required, so that a consistent alternative to the mimetic model could be created. By 1927, Guillermo de Torre had already noted that the literary novelties “formally and internally must be aligned with traditional structures” as part of the repertoire for both writers and readers. Nevertheless, he was clearly aware that “inserting the new into the old is harder than just breaking the historical timeline” (Torre 1927: 72).\n\nReadership, at Last\n\nThe equation “innovation + knowledge of tradition + compositional rigor = minority readership of experts” started to fall apart in 1929 because the market\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n31\n\nimposed its final laws. The feeling of belonging to a select group, however, would not change. When Dámaso Alonso, living in the u.s. at the time, writes to some friends (at least Salinas and Jarnés) asking for information and books to prepare a conference on the novísima Spanish literature, he means precisely “our” literature, emphasizing the possessive adjective. That is exactly the same thing that Salinas had done, back in 1926, when he published Víspera del gozo, and dedicated the book to Jarnés: “On the road to our prose,” but it was precisely Jarnés who was one of the first to realize the narrowness of such a limi­ ted definition of “our.” To put it differently, the existence of a large readership was not a utopia nor, much less, an unseemly aim, but the fate of the AvantGarde narrative could not be modified by then, as much as he tried. In Spain, Avant-Garde prose was to come to an end without having achieved a big enough audience to validate its innovations, and without incorporating them into the habitus of future readers. The discovery I am referring to happened casually, and came about hand in hand with three important political personalities: doctor Juan Negrín, future president of the Spanish Republic during the Civil War; Julio Álvarez del Vayo, socialist minister in the Negrín government; and the socialist Luis Araquistáin, who had been the editor of the journal España until Manuel Azaña took his position. Thanks to Araquistáin and Álvarez del Vayo, (who happened to be brothers-in-law, as they were married to two Swiss sisters), and to Negrín’s financing, the publishing house España was founded in May 1929. Its name came to evoke the liberal publication crafted by Ortega. A month prior, both of them had served as witnesses in the incorporation of Negrín to the Socialist Party, which rendered perfectly clear the political orientation of the publisher. One of the very first titles they wanted to incorporate was Erich Maria Remarque’s All Quiet on the Western Front in the original German, recently published in January of that same year. They immediately secured the rights from the German publisher, Ullsterin, and hired the translation services of Eduardo Foertsch. The translator, who had been a friend of Benjamín Jarnés since 1925, asked him for his collaboration in re-writing the Spanish version and splitting up the meager earnings they might have earned with it. In June of the same year, the Spanish translation was out in the streets in an edition that was double the amount of the usual run: 6,000 copies. In only one month the first edition was already exhausted, and in July they ran another 6,000, which disappeared at the same speed. That encouraged them to double the edition up to 12,000 copies, but there were still not enough to satisfy the demand, so they had to run 18,000 in September. The publisher continued to print the novel in the following months, to the same popular acclaim and, therefore, the same benefits. There was, then, a large readership who had been disdained by experimental writers, but that was clearly willing to pay for the books they\n\n32\n\nde Moya\n\nwere interested in (5 pesetas). Álvarez del Vayo, in his memoirs, remembers that “they almost made us rich” (1974: 216). That literary business caught everyone by surprise, spurring the creation of left-winged publishers devoted to political books and showing Jarnés what it meant to connect with the readership. His anger at Negrín, Araquistáin and Del Vayo for not sharing the royalties as he deemed appropriate, was clumsy and pathetic. He even asked Foertsch for more money, while the translator replied: “What can I do now? I cannot give you what they don’t give me” (2003: 95). That readership that had suddenly emerged did not have to be invented, even though it didn’t correspond to the middle classes that still read Galdós or Baroja or Armando Palacio Valdés. The invention of an adequate audience for the Avant-Garde narrative started to fail right then and there, or rather, its fai­ lure was confirmed at that time. The growth of left-winged publishers from that moment onwards was astounding. Most of them branched off from Ediciones Oriente, whose editor and c.e.o., José Venegas, remembered in his exile how they were surprised by their success, since they “had planned it for selfless reasons […] and we found it could be a great business” (Venegas 1943: 150). The demand was much higher than their projections: they had stumbled upon a goldmine of readers. The discovery of this untapped market ended friendships and multiplied publishing houses, while many deserted the Avant-Garde or, at the very least, reconsidered their positions. That same year Jarnés was honored as the best writer of Avant-Garde prose with a reception at the Hotel Nacional, but he had started to feel a perplexity that would follow him until the Civil War. Consequently, in his interview with journalist Darío Pérez – later published in the book Figuras de España (1930) – his opinions share the severity of a penitent. To him, the Spanish AvantGarde seems to have been formed by some true heroes, “who, overall, have failed,” and by a majority of writers still deeply attached to old literature, giving them a neo-classical character. And to this oxymoron of a neoclassical AvantGarde, he adds a lacking general impression: “the group called Avant-Garde has hardly fulfilled its promises. Their books are scant and short” (Pérez 1930: 268). Jarnés’ distinction is similar to that which Habermas would make much later, between “the new fad or the merely stylish, [which] will soon become outmoded” and the “modern new, [which] preserves a secret tie to the classical” (Habermas 1983: 4) and therefore survives. The practice of the Spanish Avant-Garde was mostly a fad, and it couldn’t establish a modern and lasting narrative paradigm, which would have entailed the creation of an interpretive community beyond that of the writers themselves and favorable critics. Jarnés acknowledged, however, the quality of those disoriented vanguardists. But the\n\nThe Invention Of An Avant-garde Readership\n\n33\n\nquest for such a quality came at the expense and indeterminacy of a readership that remained, as a consequence, yet to be invented.

My aim is to reconcile Joyce’s enormous influence on European letters after the publication of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and especially Ulysses (1922), on the one hand, and his minimal presence in the critical panorama of mid-1920s Spain dominated by Ortega and the group of authors involved in Revista de Occidente (most notably, Benjamín Jarnés and Antonio Espina), on the other. I also discuss how two journals, Nós and La Gaceta Literaria, enlisted Joyce in such causes as the normativization of Galician language and the questioning of bourgeois taboos, respectively. Their investment in the Irish author was so great that in 1927 the two journals rivaled each other for the honor of having published the first translated excerpts of Ulysses in Spain.\n\n…\n\nD’iste home, d’iste escritor de quen todos falan e que, se cadra, ninguén leeu, si qu’un pode pensar – si é tal e coma nol-o pintan – que ten pauto con Demo. vicente risco, “A moderna literatura irlandesa” (1926)\n\n…\n\n[Of this man, of this writer that everyone talks about and that, it is believed, nobody reads, one could come to think – if he is as he is painted – that he has made a pact with the devil.]\n\n∵ © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, ���6 | doi 10.1163/9789004310186_004\n\n36\n\nPérez-Simón\n\nIn this essay I do not propose an exhaustive review of the reception of a given author (Joyce, in this case) in a foreign country (Spain) in a given period (the mid-1920s) because of the simple fact that very few Spaniards had a solid grasp of Joyce’s work during those years, not to mention the number of actual readers of his work was insignificant, as the Galician scholar Vicente Risco notes in the sentence quoted above. Instead, I conceive of Joyce as a focal point for a varied range of cultural discourses, some of them only tangentially related to the Irish author. The consequence of this analytical strategy is that Joyce’s figure now appears to be a corpus of heterogeneous interpretations rather than a singular biographical subject or a monolithic work to be transmitted by an allegedly qualified group of interpreters. I situate Joyce in a cluster of discussions heavily influenced by the notion of the ‘Arte Nuevo’ presented by José Ortega y Gasset in La deshumanización del arte and Ideas de la novela (both works published as a single book in 1925). It is well known that the implicit model behind Ortega’s theory of the novel was Marcel Proust, and to a lesser extent Fyodor Dostoevsky, but never Joyce, about whom Ortega knew very little. My aim is to reconcile Joyce’s enormous influence on European letters after the publication of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916) and especially Ulysses (1922), on the one hand, and his minimal presence in the critical panorama of mid-1920s Spain dominated by Ortega and the group involved in Revista de Occidente, on the other. I do not subscribe to the idea of an early and fruitful assimilation of Joyce’s work in Spain in the years following World War i. In an essay on Gabriel Miró’s El obispo leproso, for example, Adolfo Sotelo Vázquez enthusiastically refers to the existence of “una densa internacionalidad de las relaciones literarias en el campo de la novela – basta escuchar las voces y los ecos españoles que convocan el ciclo proustiano, el Retrato y el Ulysses o Los monederos falsos de André Gide” (2012: n.p.). Despite the suggestiveness of this assertion, the Joycean echoes Sotelo Vázquez mentions were, after all, of minor importance, as Luis Fernández Cifuentes demonstrated as early as 1982 in his classic Teoría y mercado de la novela en España: Del 98 a la República (1982: 141–143, 293–296). In other instances, the desire to enroll Joyce in the Spanish cause has produced an inaccurate account of historical events. Factual errors can occur in the heat of the moment, as they did in Antonio Marichalar’s essay “James Joyce en su laberinto,” published in issue 17 of Revista de Occidente in November 1924. Introducing Joyce to the cultivated readers of Ortega’s magazine, Marichalar affirmed that Madrid was one of the cities where Joyce had lived, a false statement that he later corrected in the revised version of the essay that was published as prologue of Dámaso Alonso’s translation of A Portrait of the Artist as Young Man that appeared in 1926.1 One can find more recent examples of biographical 1 See this amended passage in Marichalar 2002: 72.\n\n(mis)reading Joyce In The Context Of The ‘arte Nuevo’ Narrative\n\n37\n\ninaccuracies, such as the one we see in Darío Villanueva’s essay “Valle-Inclán y James Joyce.” To establish some sort of biographical relation that would strengthen the case for a shared aesthetics, Villanueva affirms that Ramón M. Valle-Inclán’s signature appeared in an international letter of protest against a pirated version of Ulysses that was published in the usa in 1927 (Villanueva 1994: 56–57). Yet the truth is that Valle-Inclán never signed that letter, nor was he mentioned among the Spanish intellectuals whose signature Sylvia Beach, Joyce’s assistant, asked Mari"
