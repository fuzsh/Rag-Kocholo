De tener, no tengo ni remedio; sí gratitud: mil gracias.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn which the author brieﬂy introduces the topic and current debates, or an explanation of a death foretold, which never came, as well as of the author’s goals in once more returning to the topic Somos víctimas de una verdadera e insensata obsesión y así de tan manoseada identidad se nos dice, ¡imagínense el disparate!, que es urgente defenderla, que se nos la quiere hurtar, pero sobre todo se nos dice, como si se tratara de un tesoro escondido, “que la gran tarea de politólogos, historiadores e intelectuales latinoamericanos de todos los plumajes consiste en entregarnos a la búsqueda de nuestra identidad”. Y así se da el caso de que hasta el secretario de un municipio encaramado en una sierra anda al hallazgo de la identidad de “nuestra” América, porque, eso sí, nunca falta el bendito pronombre posesivo que inviste a quien lo usa de un inequívoco tinte de acendrado patriotismo latinoamericanista. Pero lo grave en esa grita y algaraza es que no sólo hay broma; hay el gato encerrado de un muy serio problema que, perentorio, reclama ahora nuestra atención. —Edmundo O’Gorman, “Latinoamérica: Así no,” Nexos, no. 123 (March 1988): 13\n\nThe idea of “Latin America” ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory. Or so I thought years ago.1 But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed. Then again, neither God nor égalité ever truly existed. To be sure, “Latin America” has never designated a geographically or historically tangible reality—at least not with a minimum of empirical and conceptual rigor. Alas, the expression has worked as the title, as the generic name of a well-known plot that is both the autobiography of the term (“Latin America”) and the story of a belief that has escaped extinction since its origins as an idea and a project in the 1850s. Nonetheless, as durable as the term has been, it has rarely been a matter of vulgari eloquentia. It certainly has undergone a barely\n\n2 / Introduction\n\nendurable intellectual metempsychosis. For the adjective Latin in “Latin America” has stored a basic array of racial, historical, and cultural beliefs that have functioned as the elementary syntax with which long-lasting, if messy, modern yeses and nos have been phrased—progress and tradition; the machine and the milpa; empire and/or nation; Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft; race and culture; alienation and authenticity; modern freedom through, or despite, history; identity as personal achievement, as ecstasy, or as a reluctant inevitability. Thus, the idea of “Latin America” has been used during nearly two centuries to essay these basic yeses and nos in a variety of fashions: Latin, meaning French imperialism vis-à-vis US expansionism; Latin, meaning, in Spanish, an alternative ontology, neither Europe nor the US; Latin, meaning speciﬁc obstacles to industrialization or to democracy; Latin, meaning, in Spanish or in English, a Marxist modernizing revolution or an indigenous, post-Marxist, antimodernizing revolution. Leftovers from various explanatory feasts can still be felt in the term. But just as when we unwisely yield to the temptation to debate the existence of God, attempting to prove or disprove the existence of “Latin America” would already be to take part in the plot embodied in the term. But it has never been a real place, a clear civilization, or a well-demarcated and unique culture or group of cultures. Moreover, I believe the term has often obscured more than it has revealed. Throughout this book, therefore, the term Latin America should be taken with a grain of salt—regard it as being always surrounded with what are called “scare quotes.” Like the common Spanish surname Matamoros, which so starkly tells of tragedy, yet passes unnoticed in common Spanish parlance, Latin America is taken for granted, a form of common sense despite its nonexistence and its unpleasant historical connotations. Hence the concept deserves respect. It was capable of incarnating itself as the geographical and cultural assumption of post–World War II theories of modernization, which took for granted the existence of a Latin part of the Americas—traditional, Catholic, patrimonialist, backward, messy, violent—where a new social engineering could be applied. The power of the term lies precisely in its ability to be taken for granted—serving less the supposition of a place, a culture, and a people, and more the need of the other America for a mirror, like the one appealed to in the fairy tale: “Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?” The concept also enchanted Marxist revolutionary utopias to the extent that by the 1970s la revolución and Latinoamérica were fully synonymous. Then, maybe for the ﬁrst time, the term became widely used by more than\n\nIntroduction / 3\n\njust intellectuals and university students (see chapter 5). Moreover, the latest postcolonial, or “coloniality” approach, the recent liberation, trans, post, alternative modernity kinds of treatment of the term Latin America have been, as it were, a “más me quere [sic], más me pega” (The more he loves me, the more he hits me) for the very idea of Latin America. The concept’s potential to designate a unique civilization, homogenous in its universal promiscuity and ontologically different from the assumed paradise of mechanism and power, has only been made more alluring by the neo-indigenista, postcolonial, alternative episteme kinds of critiques of the idea of Latin America. Since it is so enduring, it would be foolish to dismiss the inﬂuence of the term Latin America as, in Nietzsche’s terms, “second nature.”2 No. The term is here to stay, and it is important. What shall we do with it?\n\nThe ﬁrst thing to do is to expose, to enjoy, and to dwell on the irony of the history of the idea of Latin America. Rome was both the imperium populi Romani—the adoption of Roman laws and institutions—and the Roman Empire itself, formed by the often violent conquest of vast territories whose inhabitants sometimes resisted and sometimes demanded Latin urbanitas and all that Roman culture brought with it. “At the beginning of his fortune,” wrote Leopold von Ranke in the 1820s, “. . . Ataüf, King of the Visigoths, conceived the idea of gothicising the Roman world, and making himself the Caesar of all; he would maintain the Roman laws. . . . He later despaired of being able to effect this. . . . Eventually the purple of a Caesar passed to the German houses in the person of Charlemagne. At length these likewise adopted the Roman law. In this combination six great nations were formed—three in which the Latin element predominated—viz., the French, the Spanish, and the Italian; and three in which the Teutonic element was conspicuous, viz., the German, the English, and the Scandinavian.” Thus, here we have it, Rome and Latinity, dividing the world; this is an old story, one that was—in a way, still is—what Ranke believed: the division “of our nations into hostile camps upon which all modern history is based.” The Crusades spirit “gave birth to colonization.” The hate between “Teutonic” and “Latin” races included, according to Ranke, the fear of absorbing Jewish and Moorish features. This is hence the old master plot.3 The idea of a Latin part of America was somehow a modern twist on an old imperial idea—a twist that resulted from the clash of the modern nations and empires. The imperial and racial nature of the term has per-\n\n4 / Introduction\n\nsistently charged it, to a degree that extends beyond the mere peccadillo of its uses during the French Second Empire’s attempt to stop the “AngloSaxon races” in Mexico. In fact, it is nearly impossible not to voice imperial and racial connotations when articulating the concept of Latin America. To be sure, Napoleon III’s l’Amérique latine in Mexico failed, but not that other latinité: the uniﬁcation of the Latin people par excellence (Italy). The military alliance among all “Latin nations” of Europe failed, but the racial, cultural, and political assumptions that were embodied in the term Latin did not. Historiographically and philologically, Latin America still connotes not only an obvious and durable imperial anti-Anglo-Saxonism, but also echoes of many other cultural, racial, and political imperial projects.4 There has never been a meaning for Latin America that did not involve conterminously Europe and the Americas. Indeed the opposition of Anglo vs. Latin in the Americas was a peculiar recasting of lasting European dichotomies. Latin America, to be sure, has meant many things over the nearly two centuries of its odd existence. It has been used and abused culturally or racially by Jacobin liberals and by reactionary Catholics; by monarchists and by republicans; by populist regimes and by Marxist ideologues; by conservative US think tanks and by avant-garde US anthropologists. To extract from the concept’s inherent anti-US nature a truly liberal, even liberating democratic and antiracist essence would be the same as to consider, say, Pan-Slavism a real democratic struggle just because it was deﬁned against England and France. Of course, Latin America, like many other raciocultural nineteenth-century ideas, at times was used as a call for social inclusion. And yet, it was so used not as an antiracist but as a racial argument, claiming superiority over other “races,” excluding certain groups and often maintaining a strong faith either in an enlightened oligarchy or in impossible forms of direct popular ruling with no need for the ugly games of electoral democracies. Latin has been charged with such strong utopian content (a continental union, a spiritual superiority) that when intellectuals and politicians used it, they rarely felt the need to speak of speciﬁcs (How can we achieve or improve Latin American democracy? How can we achieve Latin American equality?). Moreover, Latin meant always not barbarian, and thus often not black and not Oriental. What the concept meant initially, for instance, among 1850s Chilean or Colombian intellectuals, varied depending on whether they were in Paris— as was often the case—or in Santiago or Bogota.5 The 1850s meaning was marked, in America, by the Mexican-American War, and the 1856 US intervention in Nicaragua; in Europe, by the growth of Pan-Slavism, iberismo,\n\nIntroduction / 5\n\nand Latinism resulting from the post-1848 reconstruction of empires. Thus Latin America began then to be used as a form of antibarbarism (the barbarous being US individualism and materialism, or Eastern European Jewish and backward enclaves, or Russian-sponsored Pan-Slavism). The term also began to imply unity of a natural spirit (the Latin), that entelechy at times articulated with romantic eloquence and at times considered simply a racial (scientiﬁc) fact. Hence the idea of Latin America became a synthesis of enduring languages: that old one of civilization (Rome) vs. the rest; of Catholic Spain vs. its countless enemies; the one used in France to oppose Russian imperialism, deﬁning Eastern Europeans as barbarians in need of civilization; and that of iberismo, understood as unity in diversity of peoples belonging to a common God and spirit—alas, with diverse sovereignties. In 1850s Paris, one of the ﬁrst proponents of the term Latin America, Chilean Francisco Bilbao (1823–1865), advanced the concept (mostly referring to South America) as a direct echo of French anti-Pan-Slavism. For Latin America, as an idea, was born simultaneously as an enchanting grand perspective but also as a challenging earthly reality whose speciﬁcity has been hard to demarcate. For Bilbao—a Mason, a radical exponent of a Catholic social agenda (friend, follower, and translator of the controversial French Catholic thinker and friend of Auguste Comte, H. F. R. de Lamennais)—the Mexican-American War and US intervention in Nicaragua made indispensable the need to contest “Yankee” individualism—which, he believed, had expanded in the same way that “Pan-Slavic servitude” had conquered Eastern Europe. From a clear-cut grand perspective, Russia appeared to Bilbao as “la barbarie absolutista” (absolutist barbarism), and the United States was “barbarie demagógica” (demagogic barbarism). In terms of speciﬁcity, however, the picture blurs. Bilbao’s guide, Lamennais (1783–1854), had developed a democratic ecumenism by considering all religions equal but Christianity the universal tradition and the voice of the masses. Bilbao’s ecumenism was as utopian but not as egalitarian. He was adamant about the exclusion of Brazil and Paraguay from his notion of Latin America. “We do not include Paraguay and Brazil,” he argued sustaining unity for South America (La América en peligro, 1862), because “we don’t deem them worthy to be part of the struggle’s front line.” After all, Brazil was then a slave society and an imperial monarchy: “An Empire rises and gets wealthier over tears,” he said of Brazil.6 Therefore, the early proponents of the term Latin America, like Bilbao, had no clear geography for Latin America; it meant in fact South America but without Brazil and Paraguay. Not even Mexico was truly included in\n\n6 / Introduction\n\nBilbao’s early use of the term Latin America. For him, Mexico lacked a real republican consciousness, precisely because of its complicated relationship with the United States. In Mexico, he observed, “the opposition against the U.S. is a hate that also encompasses the republican spirit of its own neighbor, which in turn Mexico cannot understand, for Mexico comes from very different principles and antecedents. In the resulting confusion, we see doubt emerging out of lack of beliefs, caudillos resulting from the lack of principles, and hence overall selﬁshness. Where is unity in Mexico’s nationality?”7 As a grand perspective, the original idea of Latin America could breath freely the oxygen of many large American and European debates. In speciﬁc terms, though, it always was an unresolved enigma. Therefore, when speaking in general terms, Latin America became, for Bilbao and other early advocators of the term, the incarnation of the durable nineteenthcentury Romantic traditionalism that still resonates today: the Bilbao Law, as it were—we, the “Latins,” said Bilbao summarily in the 1850s, though he could be speaking of Latin America today, “have not lost the tradition of human destiny’s spirituality. We believe in, and love, everything that unites; we prefer the social over the individual, beauty over wealth, justice over power, art over commerce, poetry over industry, philosophy over texts, absolute spirit over calculations, duty over interest.” If the name Latin America has had a lasting sense, this is it: the Bilbao Law.8 Indeed, Bilbao, the early proponent of Latin America, synthesized the clichés and truths that still resonate in the term. But he also, as did very few—maybe only the Cuban José Martí (1853–1895) in the late nineteenth century—distanced himself from what the term would overwhelmingly connote in the long run. For he advocated, on the basis of his radical version of social Catholicism, a kind of social inclusion that the term Latin America would only regain, at least ideally, in the second part of the twentieth century: “The Black, the Indians, the deprived, the hopeless, the weak, ﬁnd in us the respect owed to the title and dignity of human being.”9 This meaning was redeﬁned by the momentous French intervention in Mexico in the 1860s. Then there were two Latin Americas: one sponsored by old republican champions of an anti-US Latin American unity (mostly meaning southern Spanish American, excluding Brazil), and the new Latin America championed by the monarchical and French-sponsored anti-Anglo-Saxonism centered in Mexico. The enemies of the latter were not only liberal republicans like Benito Juárez but also the Lincoln administration. Thus the Latin America of the old South American republicans became, if momentarily, supportive of the United States. In the 1862\n\nIntroduction / 7\n\nCongress of the Sociedad de la Unión Americana, in Santiago, Chile, the 1850s proponents of Latin America rejected the French-sponsored Latin America by making their idea of Latin America akin to a sort of early PanAmericanism. They even reevaluated the Monroe Doctrine as an American (Pan-American) defensive policy against European powers—as did such contemporary intellectuals as J. M. Torres Caicedo and Justo Arosemena, and such later ﬁgures as Brazilians Manuel de Oliveira Lima and J. M. Machado de Assis, although they rejected any sense of unity with Spanish America. Therefore, in the 1860s, Lincoln’s United States was considered radically different from the pre–Civil War United States. The US envoy at the 1862 Santiago Congress, Mr. Mackie, was warmly welcomed, and his words directly addressed 1850s Latin Americanism by referring to the 1856 US involvement in Nicaragua as an action of the “wrong” United States: “Walker’s ﬁlibusters, added Mr. Mackie, were the same who today are rebels [the Confederates].”10 In turn, in the 1860s struggles of semantics over the expression Latin America, Brazil excluded itself ambivalently, supporting Maximilian but rejecting a French-led Latin America, and above all fearing the radical measures taken by the Lincoln administration over the course of the war regarding slavery and citizenship for former slaves. And the term kept changing. Just after the defeat of Maximilian’s empire in Mexico, a group of US and South American intellectuals launched, as it were, an anti–Latin American publication from New York: Ambas Américas: Revista de educación, bibliografía y agricultura (1867–68). Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, then one of the most prominent writers in Spanish of America, launched the publication. His travels in the United States and the context of educational and agricultural transformation during Reconstruction had convinced him of a less Latin and more Ambas Américas route for the continent. It was a journal intended as a forum where US and Spanish American intellectuals could interact, especially in terms of practical educational and agricultural ideas. The effort lasted for two years, translating and criticizing education policies throughout the continent. It was not an iberista or pro-latinité proposal, but it was rooted in a well-established South American liberalism and sponsored by progressive US educators and Hispanists. Sarmiento counted on the input of Mary Mann (Mary Tayler Peabody), the widow of the prominent Massachusetts politician and educator Horace Mann; she was the translator of Sarmiento’s Facundo into English. Sarmiento also had the support of the Boston Hispanist elite (George Ticknor, especially). The magazine did not refer to Latin America or to any notion of continental union or common spirit—neither was there mention of Pan-\n\n8 / Introduction\n\nAmericanism. It was simply the recognition that the United States was the educational, industrial, and agricultural model to follow, which needed to be known in the rest of the continent. And it was also a call for the US intelligentsia to recognize the intelligence of the other America. It did not last, but it was one of the many projects in the midst of those advanced by Spanish American intellectuals in Paris and South America. In 1872, Ramón Páez—son of Venezuela’s hero of independence and longtime caudillo, José Antonio Páez—continued this trend with Ambas Américas: Contrastes (1872). A writer and painter, Ramón Páez had been partly educated in England, and was then living in New York. He was a convinced believer in the US educational revolution, which was the path to follow by the “morohispánica” (not Latin) America, including such an un-Latin thing as women’s education. All these efforts certainly sounded, both then and now, un–Latin American.11 But over the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, other periodicals, in French and Spanish, supported one or another Latin Americanism through literary Hispanism or through senses of iberismo. For instance, there were the prominent philological journals, such as the Revue Hispanique (1894–1933) and the Revue des Langues Romanes (started in 1870), devoted to all the Iberian languages, which included a lot about the American world. There were also the Revue de l’Amérique latine (1922–1932), sustained by the prominent French Hispanist Ernest Martinenche; the Bulletin de l’Amérique latine (1911–1921), published by the Sorbonne; and L’Amérique latine (1923–1940s), a fusion of various journals devoted to America and Brazil. There were also the Argentinean periodical Nuestra América (1918– 1926), edited by E. Stefanini, and the Unión Ibero-Americana (1885–1926), a successor to the Revista de las Españas, published in Madrid. In Brazil, the Revista Americana (1909–1919), a diplomatic endeavor launched by the Barão de Rio Branco, sought a certain cultural rapprochement with both the United States and South America. In such a way, by the mid-twentieth century the idea of Latin America had gained some institutional intellectual existence (see chapter 2).12 All in all, by the 1890s Latin America had lost its strong French connotations and had won emphatic senses of spiritual superiority through hispanidad or iberismo. By the early twentieth century, racial theory was more important to the concept than either any form of republicanism or the early twentieth-century philological and cultural arguments that sustained, for instance, iberismo. The violence consubstantial to the concept—as encounter of civilization vs. barbarie, spirit vs. matter, or as clashes of antagonist cultures, religions, and empires—also kept changing. As was the case with\n\nIntroduction / 9\n\nRanke, for Bilbao, both the Anglo-Saxons and the Latin Americans were in a state of perpetual violence with each other, upholding a cosmic order that could exist only by preserving the equilibrium: “America, in its twofold nature as Saxon and Latin, witnesses not the contradictions of ideas, as in Europe, but the exclusivity of ideas. America has crippled harmony. Harmony is individualism and sociability. The North embodies individualism; the South, sociability. The Saxon-Yankee is Protestant and federal; the Spanish American is Catholic and a centralizer; . . . the Yankee is the centrifugal force; the American from the South is the centripetal force. Both are necessary for order to exist.” By the 1970s, the idea of Latin America, still expressing its “spiritual” and racial connotations, had transformed the Bilbao-like violent equilibrium into a morally sanctioned call for revolution. Latin America was then, in the words of Eduardo Galeano, “the region of the open veins,” which had been the eternal victim of Europe and the United States—the “proxenetas de la desdicha” (procurers of misery).13 The concept of Latin America, however, has been deeply rooted in profound European and American ways of knowing. Thus, once it was articulated, it kept reinforcing enduring social and intellectual explanations while gradually eliminating old connotations or adding new meanings. These added meanings lasted or not, depending both on speciﬁc circumstances and on their harmony or disharmony with the enduring commonplaces so eloquently evoked, as it were, by the Bilbao Law.\n\nWithin its European roots, the idea of Latin America belonged to one of the many related cultural and political reformulations that since the late eighteenth century sought to redeﬁne imperial contours. The simultaneity in the articulation and actions of these various reformulations made each one what it was or is—there were both large-scale projects (such as Pan-Slavism, Pan-Germanism, or iberismo) and smaller ones, such as the many forms of “imperial nationalisms” (Provençal, Catalan, Portuguese, Hispanic, Mexican, Brazilian, French, or Italian). In the 1860s French sense, l’Amérique latine meant anti-Anglo-Saxonism—and still does—after a racial fashion. But it also implied Catholic antimodernism, anti-Semitism, and anti-Protestantism—which were also somehow present in, say, early twentieth-century Mexican, Catalan, French, and Spanish nationalisms. The United States, as the Comte de Gobineau maintained, was “infected by all the corrosive fruits of modernity.” And all sorts of Latins echoed this basic notion, with or without reference to the United States\n\n10 / Introduction\n\n(or England); with either self-pride in authentic Latin institutions and “spirit,” or with self-critical revulsion at the historical burden of Latinity. Alfonso de Maia—the embodiment of Iberian values, a character in the late nineteenth-century Portuguese masterpiece Os Maias (J. M. Eça de Queirós)—phrased his simultaneous dislike of both US individualism and the modernizing attempts of the Portuguese Empire: “to politicians–‘less liberalism and more character’; to men of letters–‘less eloquence and more ideas’; to citizens at large–‘less progress and more ethics.’” In the 1930s, in Argentina, the inﬂuential Spanish ideologue of hispanidad, Ramiro de Maeztu, defended not liberté, égalité et fraternité but “servicio, jerarquía y hermandad” (service, hierarchy, and brotherhood). In the same decade, an “oriental Latin,” as he then called himself, Mircea Eliade, saw the Salazar regime in Portugal as the natural result of the exhaustion of nineteenthcentury, non-Latin “demoliberalismo.” For Eliade, António de Oliveira Salazar was the true spiritual renovation of “latinidad.” And in the 1990s, in English, distinguished scholar Ilan Stavans unveiled, as if for the ﬁrst time, the Quixote-like condition of Latinos in the United States: their inability to distinguish between reality and dreams.14 Indeed, the adjective “Latin” has implied antimodernism, which in turn implied strong authority, distrust of full liberty, spirit over matter, subjectivity over objectivity, and distrust of individualism (corporate and spiritual goals over individual passions and interests)—that is, the Bilbao Law. Throughout the nineteenth century, the meanings of Latin America were part of debates over iberismo and latinité. As an ingredient in these debates, Latin America was a conservative idea by birth, a dream not only of the unity of a supposed race, but also of all the enemies of individualism, democracy, and modernization. In Second Empire France, advocates of a Latin empire toyed with the idea of supporting the Confederate states in the US Civil War—emphasizing in latinité its love of order, of local autonomy and tradition (as in the defenses of latinité in the South of France in the 1850s). If, as John Phelan argued in the 1960s, Napoleon III’s SaintSimonian Minister, Michel Chevalier, was the mastermind of the idea of l’Amérique latine during the 1860s French intervention in Mexico, it was because Chevalier’s 1830s trip to the United States had fostered in him both respect and fear for the United States through reactionary notions of latinité. In his report from his 1839 trip to the United States, he conﬁrmed that France was better ﬁtted than Austria, Prussia, England, or the United States to reestablish order in Spanish America. France “has a physiognomy more strongly marked, a mission more clearly deﬁned, and above all, she\n\nIntroduction / 11\n\nhas more of the social spirit. She is at the head of the Latin group; she is its protectress.” For, “in the events which seem about to dawn upon us, France may, then, take a most important share. . . . She alone can save the whole [Latin] family from being swallowed up by a double ﬂood of Slavonians and Germans.” And yet, by the 1860s, latinité seemed to Chevalier to be compatible with France’s recognition of the Confederate states. “The recognition of the Southern States will be the consequences of our intervention [in Mexico],” wrote Chevalier in 1861. The North planned to make, he argued, “the negro food for powder,” but France’s notion “of philanthropy and our moral sense alike revolt from these ferocious exaggerations of the love of liberty.” Slavery was not a problem for recognition of the South: “France will use her inﬂuence to secure the gradual emancipation of the slaves without making slavery a ground for refusing recognition.”15 In turn, Mexican liberals were allies of the “Black president,” Abraham Lincoln against the Latin empire. And understandably so. For the antimoderns, the French Mexican adventure was the Crimean War all over again: the Russian role was played by the United States; the role of Turkey went to Mexico, which was to be defended from itself by a European Latin power, thus establishing a Latin kingdom. And yet, before, in the early 1850s, the idea of Latin America as a dream of unity in South America—in such thinkers as Colombian (Panamanian) Justo Arosemena or Bilbao— was a liberal reaction to US policies in Central America. But it was then also a statement against individualism, Protestantism, mechanization, and materialism. Moreover, this early use of the term also involved a sort of exorcism: Latin America meant the liberal un-Latinizing of illiberal Spanish America, the end of decades of unbound reactionary passions and caudillismo. In 1864 Lima, in another congress calling for the unity of Spanish America, Arosemena put it clearly: “If there are fraternity and love among the American peoples, the Congress is hardly necessary; if there are not, the Congress is hardly possible.” And thus he pointed to the need to exorcize the idea of Latin America before the real Latin America could exist: “The Spanish race of America has the selﬁshness of the Conquistador, the distrust of the Indian, and the pride of the old Castilian. Thus its vices and some virtues.”16 By the mid-twentieth century, no one using the term Latin America dreamed of a Latin anti-Slavic kingdom or of exorcizing the vices of the Spanish American race from Latin America. But the term did mean a defense of tradition and some form of spiritual superiority over the materialistic Protestant world. The history of the term’s antidemocratic and antiliberal connotations\n\n12 / Introduction\n\nis convoluted. To be sure, the term has always included a populist call for the authentic people—whether the Latin race; or the Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking peoples; or the proudly hybrid, mythological, Catholic race of America; or the anti-imperialist proletariat of the tropics—to unite, resist, or emerge. Moreover, Bilbao, in a way, could be considered the early promoter of the idea of Latin America as a democratic, all-inclusive polity, and José Martí as a late nineteenth-century example of the same. The problem is that Bilbao’s idea of Latin America did not include what today is seen as Latin America—not Brazil, not Paraguay, and not really Mexico— and did not accept any sense of practicality in democratic representation. He rejected any form of parliamentary and delegated representation, and thus advocated a sort of direct and constant self-representation in a Catholic community (El evanjelio americano, 1864).17 Another early liberal advocator of a Latin American union, Justo Arosemena, supported full citizenship for all, regardless of race, in a hypothetical Latin American union, but he was clear that this was hardly attainable through democratic means: “A large nationality constituted by disperse elements, as homogenous as they might be, requires a very powerful domination, an irresistible imperative, so much so that, if not for Bolívar, San Martín, or Iturbide, I cannot see how that nationality could have existed. Those who dream of this gigantic construction [a South American union] think of treaties and pacts among peoples, and forget that such transactions are unknown in history because they go against the nature of things.” For him, Rousseau’s social contract had “desbordado la democracia” (overﬂowed democracy), and Hobbes had “engreído el despotismo” (made despotism conceited). For Arosemena, Anglo-Saxons were better than Latins, for in them the “principio de razas” (race principle; i.e., racial superiority) had “cumplida aplicación” (had been fully applied): “In the Anglo-Saxon race, passion does not prevail over reason, as it does in the Hispanic race.” Anglo-Saxon America had the climate and the predisposition to attract European immigration, “whose mixture improves the original population in political, moral, and industrial respects.”18 Hence, Latin America, for these early proponents of the term, was far from a fully democratic and antiracist idea. For it was an idea of its times, no less, no more. In turn, José Martí’s democratic creed derived from his own experience of the United States—its Civil War, its large African American struggle, and its assimilation of immigrants, including Chinese.19 But he did not live long enough for us to see what his democracy for Cuba would have entailed. Yet his 1877–78 support of Guatemalan dictator Justo Ruﬁno Barrios cannot\n\nIntroduction / 13\n\nbe read as a doctrine of democratic development for “Nuestra América.” Martí lived in Guatemala during those years—the years of his love for María, “La niña de Guatemala” of his poem—and became close to Barrios and his intellectual allies, who supported a liberal authoritarian modernization of Guatemala. Barrios himself supported Cuban independence. But Martí’s views of the Barrios modernization and of the vast Indian population in Guatemala are not very different from those expressed by “bad” liberals such as Justo Sierra or Barrios himself: Indians would overcome their atavism, laziness, and backwardness through education, becoming liberal citizens.20 The truth is that Martí’s “Latin America” was in fact something else: “Nuestra América,” meaning a modern, liberal, if not fully democratic, modernizing utopia, including the US experience, which was Martí’s. I believe that in very few historical moments, and only very recently, has the term Latin America designated a struggle for liberal democracy— maybe only in the “Latin” undertones of the Portuguese and Spanish (and then Brazilian, Argentinean, Chilean, Uruguayan, and even Mexican) transitions to democracy, starting in 1974 with Portugal’s Carnation Revolution. By the early twenty-ﬁrst century, however, Latin America, spoken in English, has returned to populist ideas of indigenous power and spiritual and moral superiority vis-à-vis an imaginary West. In Spanish, the term regained its populist, antiliberal connotations in, for instance, the Venezuelaled “Bolivarian revolution” and among its admirers in the United States. More irony: Washington Irving’s views of Spain, together with European iberismo and latinité, were echoed by late nineteenth-century US hispanismo, only to later become the patrimony of precisely what US Hispanism was not supposed to be from the very beginning: “Latino Studies.” That is, l’Amérique latine became the equally imperial but now US-based and lasting term “Latin America” (in English), which was articulated as the non– United States or as the United States that somehow was, and is, not really the United States—Latino, Latina: the racio-cultural cluster of things that were assumed to be the authentic realm of a large part of the US population. Now, in the twenty-ﬁrst century, all of them, on either side of the southern US border, are Latins, as Napoleon III would have had it—millions of them US citizens but somehow exoticized as different, as belonging to another cultural ontology, mythically linked to a nonexistent Atlantis: “Latin America.” The identity politics that has sanctioned Latinos in the United States electorally and commercially has not brought obsolescence to the term Latin America; rather, it has furnished the ethereal concept with a very material political and commercial market (see chapter 4).\n\n14 / Introduction\n\nIn terms of legal infrastructure, the expression Latin America has meant very little, despite either the various nineteenth-century legal uniﬁcation attempts or the academic and diplomatic presence of the term in English or French. The few instances in which the region known as Latin America acquired as a whole some legal infrastructure were when it was included in the International Bureau of the American Republics, later the Pan-American Union, and later the Organization of American States. These organizations, however, were meant precisely to dissolve the “Latin” unity within a Western hemisphere unity commanded by the United States. They incorporated the US, English- and French-speaking Caribbean, and Canada. The lasting expression of this Pan-Americanism was its building (1911), designed by Albert Kelsey and French architect Paul P. Cret, and erected in Washington, DC, bordering the Washington Mall. The building embodied commercial and cultural features of decades of US attempts at hemispheric union: from Washington Irving–like views of Spain to US interests in the continent’s natural resources; from fascination with Maya and Aztec archaeology to the stereotype of a patio inspired by Catalan and Mexican architectures. Two sculptural groups representing the North and South Americas, each composed of a maternal ﬁgure and a boy, still guard the entrance of the building. Their signiﬁcance was explained in 1911 by the director of the Pan-American Union: “In the North American group the boy, strikingly alert in feature and action, expresses the more energetic spirit of the fully awakened North. The ﬁgure of ‘South America,’ while young and strong, has a softer and more sensuous quality, expressive of tropical ease and luxuriance. . . . [The boy] conveys a sense of great future possibilities of which he is not yet conscious.” Good or bad, this is the history of the Latin regions acting institutionally together in world affairs, and the Pan-American view of the “luxuriance” of the South was not very different from that of twentieth-century Latin Americanism.21 The institution “Latin America,” unlike the institution “Europe” in the last ﬁve decades, has meant very little compared with such powerful documents as Mexican, Brazilian, or Peruvian passports. To be sure, late eighteenthcentury “criollo patriotisms” and early nineteenth-century “Americanisms” were important political and intellectual tools for imagining both a new world made of modern nation-states and a continental group of newcomers. The 1850s notions of Latin America included these connotations. Moreover, the term Latin America has acquired important symbolic connotations during the twentieth century, beyond those of intellectuals. But its political\n\nIntroduction / 15\n\nand economic importance pales vis-à-vis not only a national citizenship but also “natural” multi-citizenships: Mexican and American for Mexico; Italian, Spanish, and Israeli for Argentina and Uruguay; black, Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish for Brazil; black, French, Spanish, and English for many parts of the Caribbean. Latin America thus connotes a feeling that is hard to measure and difﬁcult to interpret. In the few recent surveys that actually ask about selfidentiﬁcation in different Spanish-speaking countries (with such options as Latin American, Caribbean, North American, South American, Central American, citizen of the world. . . .), the results show no Latin American pattern. Mexico, for instance, the only country for which data differentiate between the general population and the leaders, turns out to have more ordinary citizens than leaders who self-identiﬁed as Latin American. But the “popular” Latin American feeling seems to be in decline in Mexico: in 2006, 62% self-identiﬁed as Latin American, while 50% did so in 2012, and 43.5% in 2014. Mexico’s leaders, however, felt less Latin American, but their feeling shows growth: in 2006, 49% of the sampled leaders selfidentiﬁed as Latin American; in 2012, 51% did so. In Colombia, 43% selfidentiﬁed as Latin American in 2008; 51% in 2012, and 59% in 2014. In Ecuador, 41% did so in 2010, 50% in 2012, and 53.4% in 2014; in Peru, 25% in 2008, 34% in 2010, and 38% in 2014; and in Chile, in 2008 only 31% self-identiﬁed as Latin American (almost equivalent to the 27% of Mexicans who in 2012 identiﬁed themselves as “citizens of the world”). Mexico has been at the core of the meaning of Latin America as it is projected to the world, mainly due to its long coexistence with the United States. Thus the Latin American identiﬁcation seems important in Mexico, as if, being so close and so entangled with the United States, self-identifying as Latin American helps to maintain one’s own Mexicanness. Brazil, on the other hand, is a very different story: in 2014 3.7% of interviewed Brazilians identiﬁed as Latin American, 13.5% as citizens of the world, and 79.4% as Brazilians. In any case the term clearly has some symbolic power in the region, but it can hardly be said to denote a real institution or a homogenous symbolic identity of the people south of Nogales, Sonora22 (see chapter 6).\n\nOver the last decades, especially in Spanish and Portuguese, there have been several criticisms of the very utility of the term Latin America.23 Prominent writers of my generation, such as Jorge Volpi, have appointed themselves the post–Latin American writers who do not deal with Latin\n\n16 / Introduction\n\nAmerican landscapes: the ﬁrst true cosmopolitans in our poor valleys of Comalas (Juan Rulfo), tropical Pasagardas (Manuel Bandeira), and Macondos (Gabriel García Márquez). Thus Volpi announced the end of Latin America, or at least of the Latin American writer, and unveiled the painful truth once again, as if for the ﬁrst time: Latin America does not exist. Oh, really? What intellectual, writing in Spanish, or Portuguese, or Nahuatl in the nineteenth or twenty-ﬁrst century, is not cosmopolitan, is not both more and less than Latin American? Another Mexican writer, Juan Villoro, as a young pupil in the 1960s at Mexico City’s Deutsche Schule, discovered the advantages of satisfying his teachers’ exoticist desires by assuming his own non-Westernness, his Latin Americanness. But as an accomplished writer in the twenty-ﬁrst century, he saw it clearly: “La única patria verdadera se asume sin posar para la mirada ajena” (The only real fatherland is adopted without posing for the foreign gaze). And yet, the current success of writers like Volpi in the monopolistic, Spanish-speaking literary market is nothing more than the merchandizing of an old notion and a familiar position, that of the Latin American writer—a position that young writers assume proﬁtably, if not happily, if they want to gain fame in Barcelona or New York.24 Moreover, in 2014 even the late Eduardo Galeano—the author of the old Latin Americanist manifesto (still a best seller in English translation), The Open Veins of Latin America (1971)—changed his mind. The “open veins,” he said, were not a metaphor—it was suicide: “I wouldn’t be capable of reading this book again,” he said at a Brazilian book fair, “I’d keel over. For me, this prose of the traditional left is extremely leaden, and my physique can’t tolerate it.” But of course his American editor (at Monthly Review Press) disagreed. “Please! The book is an entity independent of the writer and anything he might think now,” argued the editor of Galeano’s best seller in English—though a Brazilian critic considered that Galeano “should feel really guilty for the damage he caused.”25 The recent success of Roberto Bolaño’s novels in English seems to have redeﬁned the understanding of Latin American literature in the United States, beyond the so-called magical realism of the 1960s and 1970s boom. Bolaño was indeed a unique and complicated character, difﬁcult to portray as an embodiment of Latin America. Yet the texture of language games that display the absurdity and irony of a Latin American identity in Los detectives salvajes (1998) is hard to translate into English. Who cares about this absurdity and irony in English? Instead, in English, Bolaño has been molded into a new ﬁgure of Latin America, the world of his works, as Sarah Pollack has argued, “recast this time in visceral realist but equally exotic terms as a\n\nIntroduction / 17\n\nspace safeguarding the adolescent idealism of the 70s, ripe with sexy, savage, Che Guevara-esque adventurers of uncompromising artistic and existential rebellions, an argument since echoed by Horacio Castellanos Moya and Jorge Volpi, among others.”26 The question is, What is new about this? Success in English for a writer of Spanish in America still requires formatting by the lasting meanings of Latin America. Also, it has become a cliché of certain conservative, Spanish-speaking intellectuals—from the 1976 liberal criticism by Carlos Rangel of the idea of Latin America to those by Álvaro Vargas Llosa—to mock the Latin American condition, which is a rather easy target. Yet the politics of some of these criticisms is so radically conservative that they have achieved little resonance in larger intellectual or academic circles, whether in Spanish or English. Besides, their own anti-Latinism backﬁres: some of them are the star Latino intellectuals of mainstream Miami or New York.27 More telling is the recent Brazilian anti–Latin Americanism that seeks to expose the nonsense of the term Latin America, as in Leandro Narloch and Duda Teixeira’s Guia politicamente incorreto da América Latina (2011). To be sure, this is an old crusade, in which Brazil distinguishes itself from the rest of the continent—a task skillfully performed in the 1820s by José Bonifácio and by Joaquim Nabuco and Eduardo Prado in the 1890s (see chapter 3). Of course, there was also an eloquent, if small, Brazilian pro–Latin Americanism, more a form of self-criticism than of love for Latin America, better expressed in Sérgio Buarque de Holanda’s self-criticism of the Portuguese colonization of Brazil vis-à-vis Spain’s colonization of Mexico and Peru; or in Manuel Bandeira’s ironic “Rondó dos cavalinhos” (1920s): “Os cavalinhos correndo,/ E nós, cavalões, comendo . . . / Alfonso Reyes partindo,/ E tanta gente ﬁcando . . .” (The little horses running / and we, big horses, eating . . . / Alfonso Reyes is leaving / and so many others staying).28 This is thus an old story. But Leandro Narloch and Duda Teixeira use humor to mock what they see as intrinsic to the idea of Latin America: constant lamentation, the making of all local expressions into a form of cultural resistance, the love of violence. They do this by addressing Latin American icons such as Che Guevara, Simón Bolívar, Francisco Villa, or Salvador Allende: “The more nonsense [bobagens] they [the heroes] talk, the more they sabotage their own countries, the more monuments and T-shirts will be produced to honor them.”29 But in fact Brazil’s increasing global relevance is bringing about the obsolescence of the term Latin America much more effectively than any book or critic . . . at least for Brazil. Former Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva at times made geostrategic use of Latin America—showing solidarity with Evo Morales’s Bolivia or Hugo Chávez’s\n\n18 / Introduction\n\nVenezuela. But that was only one, and not the most important, geostrategy used by Lula; it paled vis-à-vis his playing the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) or the Luso-Africa-America cards.30 The best analysis in Spanish—and for that matter in any language—of the origins and challenges of the term Latin America is by Miguel Rojas Mix (1991).31 This was indeed a full anatomy of the term, a serious criticism of its imperial and racial connotations. Rojas Mix’s account included a robust reading of the early 1850s Chilean, Colombian, and Venezuelan advocators of a defensive union of republics (always excluding Brazil) against, ﬁrst, the United States, and then Europe itself. Rojas Mix, moreover, covered with erudition and parsimony, as very few had done, the telling challenges to the idea of Latin America advanced by indianismo and Afro-Americanism. He showed that the former, in its post-1970s radical version (Fausto Reinaga, Guillermo Bonﬁl Batalla), if fully followed, would obliterate the idea of a Latin or any other America other than a pre-America—a region returned to indigenous people who would have remained, one might assume, immune to any change, endlessly the same. On the other hand, Afro-Americanism, in Rojas Mix’s view, was the conﬁrmation of the anti-black consensus of most of the European and American sponsors of the idea of Latin America—with few exceptions. As Rojas Mix showed, from Torres Caicedo to Catholic José Vasconcelos or radical José Carlos Mariátegui, Latin meant not black. In Mariátegui’s Inca socialism of the 1920s, blacks were still seen, as Rojas Mix showed, mostly as a source of “sensuality, superstition, and primitivism”—an “obstacle made of barbarism.” In the same way, César Vallejo, the great Peruvian poet, while living in 1920s Paris, wondered and afﬁrmed too much simultaneously: “Europe can ignore the Africans, the Australians, but us [Latin Americans]?”32 Nevertheless, Afro-Americanism, Rojas Mix argued, was an important literary trend that began to radicalize in the 1970s through the inﬂuence of Franz Fanon’s writings (and, one should add, of the African American civil rights struggle, and of the decolonization of Africa). Rojas Mix’s account was conceived in the context of the bitter debates around the ﬁfth centennial of Europe in America (1992). At that time, the literature on “Afro-Latin America” had not yet reached the productive stage of the last two decades. But “Afro-Latin America” is an idea that, as an academic trend and as a social movement, is also disintegrating the very concept of Latin America, either in the name of an Afro-American large experience (including above all the United States and Africa) or in the name of important national agendas: Afro-Colombian or Afro-Brazilian rights and struggles. The idea of Latin America is a rather odd complement to these struggles.\n\nIntroduction / 19\n\nRojas Mix, however, also made a strong defense of what he believed to be the “socialist and libertarian” connotations in the works of some early advocators of the idea of Latin America—especially Bilbao (1850s) and Martí (1890s). As he put it, somewhat bombastically, “Bilbao not only preceded other thinkers in the use of the term ‘Latin America,’ but he is also the precursor of the meaning the concept would later acquire in the Latin American lefts. In Bilbao, the concept is framed within an anticolonial and anti-imperial thought, within a project of a socialist society.” Thus, not surprisingly, at the end Rojas Mix made a call to save the idea of Latin America; such a union was for him, in 1991, not utopia but urgency. But it was one based not on the archaeology of utopian versions of the term, but in an identity yet to be realized, inspired in the future. “Latin America,” he argued, could not be a choice of the Hispanic, the Afro, the Indian, or the “usaica” identity; it would be a “we” still in the making that nevertheless— O magic of Latin America!—already included the we: “It is not through pike and hoe that we are to ﬁnd it [Latin American identity]. It is a creative problem. . . . It is the materialization of a project that will go on selecting its own past. Latin American identity will be what we do with it, and that is why its roots are in the future.”33 I myself share and applaud the conclusion—identity as a constant making, ﬁnding roots in the future. Yet, I do not see why it has to be coped by such strong dictum as “Latin America.”\n\nIn Spanish and Portuguese, art historians and critics have done much to mock the “neurosis identitaria” (Gerardo Mosquera) implied in the concept of “Latin American art.”34 In the 1940s and 1950s what was known as the Mexican artistic renaissance was canonized as quintessential Latin American art by world collectors and critics—through various prominent exhibitions of Mexican art in the United States and Europe and, not least, through various US commissions granted to the holy trinity of Mexican painters (Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros). The customer is always right, and thus post-revolutionary Mexican regimes became the generous primary patron of this art, which was marketed as the ﬁnal return to an authentic, popular, and ethnically proud Mexico. Hence, despite the artistic boom in Buenos Aires or São Paulo (starting in the 1920s), Latin American art in the world came to be seen mostly through Mexico-centric eyes. São Paulo’s momentous artistic modernism and Buenos Aires’s avant-gardism of the 1920s did not seek a Rivera-like ethnic and nationalist art. Of course, Mexican revolutionary art was somehow part of Paulista and Porteño experi-\n\n20 / Introduction\n\nments, as were the many world vanguards that fed both the Mexican artistic renaissance and São Paulo’s modernism. São Paulo and Buenos Aires, however, did not have the appeal of a revolution in a revolutionary era; moreover, they could not count on a lasting connection to US cultural markets and desires that projected Mexican revolutionary art to the world. Brazilian modernism’s accent was on radical avant-gardism; Rivera sought political radicalism by taming his own twenty years of Parisian artistic avant-gardism. Mexico was sexier for world artistic taste in the 1930s; it seemed too exotic and ethnically radical vis-à-vis the less exotic, though radical, vanguard experiments of either São Paulo or Buenos Aires. As the 1920s Peruvian intellectual Antenor Orrego put it, commenting on the possibility of a truly new American art, “Mexico represents Europe’s lack of understanding of America, that is, of what is uniquely American. Argentina represents America’s understanding of Europe, that is, of what is sublimely European.”35 Thus, if art had to “un-frog” itself from its European spell, Mexico was the elixir to drink. Starting in the 1970s, the mere possibility of a Latin American art was deeply contested. Post-1945 Argentine, Mexican, or Brazilian artists often aggressively vetoed the idea of a Latin American art. In one of the various symposia on the matter from the 1960s to the 1990s, Argentinean painter Ernesto Deira maintained, “Latin America does not exist as such. . . . If Latin America does not exist as a concept, how could one ask for something characteristic of its art?” But US and European critics defended the existence of Latin American art—often with Mexico-centric eyes. And they did so at various points on the grounds of commonality in resistance and oppression, based on the suffering of the two conquests (Shifra M. Goldman)—the Spanish and the US conquests—or on the belief in a sublime collective and anti-individualist spiritualism. All of these arguments, to be sure, were mere echoes of the idea of Latin America. “The concern for human values constitutes perhaps the most cohesive force throughout Latin America,” wrote the leading US art historian of Latin America, Jacqueline Barnitz, in the 1960s. “Because of it there exists a sort of ideological consistency far greater than among North American artists who are still trying to reconcile what little individuality remains with the overpowering spokes of the industrial wheel.” This is Latin American business as usual.36 The debates over the possibilities of Latin American art in the 1960s and 1970s displayed a common dilemma in the arts and literature. On the one hand, there was the clear de-Latin-Americanizing aspiration of artists in Mexico City, São Paulo, and Buenos Aires, or of Argentinean, Mexican,\n\nIntroduction / 21\n\nand Brazilian artists living in Paris, New York, Barcelona, or Madrid (from José Luis Cuevas to the Brazilian concretists). On the other, there was the dogged fencing off of any artistic or literary expression of “Latin” people within the conﬁnes of the lasting meanings of Latin America by collectors, art critics, and scholars in New York, Paris, or Chicago. Mexican art critic Jorge Alberto Manrique lucidly captured this dilemma in the 1970s. Both the temptation of Europe, he argued, and that of non-Europe (the place deﬁned as ontologically different from and alternative to what was believed to be European) were American (from all of America). For him, both in fact constitute what it means to be American. In a way, without the constant conﬂicts and chaotic struggles caused by both temptations, there was no possibility either of art in general or of Latin American art. When, as in the case of Mexico’s post-revolutionary art, one of the temptations seems to have been absolutely victorious, artistic creation stagnates, and art becomes an ideological and stylistic cage: “The more successful the movements of the 1920s were as movements, not as the personal work of artists, the more they mortgaged their future in the long run.”37 For Manrique, post-1945 artists in the Americas clearly opted to “sentirse universales” (to feel themselves to be universal). But in the 1970s, he wondered if that was the last of it: “Is this just another swing of the pendulum that makes us alternate between opening up to the outside and closing down on ourselves?” The doubt was there (would Latin America return to some form of identity nativism?); at the same time, it was not there (he used the “we,” meaning Latin America). For as Manrique himself claimed, it was impossible to conceptualize Latin American art outside the conﬁnes of the concept of Latin America and all that it implied—Iberian conquest, mestizaje, “dependence, exploitation, neocolonialism, ﬁctitious economics . . .” And yet every part of Latin America was different: “The desire to be the same, when indeed we are different, is an invention begun by Bolívar, Fray Servando Teresa de Mier, Talamantes, or Miranda, and many others. Perhaps it is a ﬁction: it was then and maybe—somehow—it is still.” However, “this ﬁction has been created and maintained for so long that it has come to have the shape of reality. We have invented the concept of Latin America, and we have succeeded, in a curious way, in making reality look like the concept with which we describe it.” And he believed that this had happened because, in a sense, the category of Latin America was seen as a way to gain citizenship in world art.38 Thus if there was and is a Latin American art, it would mean that the world had recognized an “arte propio” and yet “universal.” Manrique be-\n\n22 / Introduction\n\nlieved that the Latin American artist would never have the peace of mind of a Frenchman to create and would always have to struggle with selfdeﬁnition within the parameters of what Latin America meant. He believed that this constituted the possibility of Latin American art. And yet, ironically, to achieve a true world artistic citizenship would mean “that the concept of Latin America, of Latin American art, would disappear, and it would be replaced by something else.” Hence, in Manrique we ﬁnd a lucid analysis of how the category of Latin America could achieve timely and important artistic expression, only to disappear a moment later, like the maguey plant, which ﬂowers and then dies.39 In the arts, in literature (e.g., Octavio Paz’s El laberinto de la soledad, 1950), even in 1950s forms of philosophical and sociological indigenismo (e.g., Luis Villoro’s Los grandes momentos del indigenismo en México, 1950), this enigma prevails: the hope that by being very, very local (native), art would ﬁnally reach universality. But then the problem becomes not that of a Mexican or Latin American identity, nor even that of being universal, but that of being accepted as such, as universal. Even in very contemporary art criticism, the term Latin America has shown great survival skills. In a recent lucid, Aby Warburg–like essay, Atlas portátil de América Latina (2012), Graciela Speranza destroys and reconstructs the Latin Americanness of art in a single paragraph, as if the very hope (of newness, of being an alternative) implied in the term Latin America ought not to die. In one paragraph, Speranza ﬁrst takes for granted the map of Latin America and then reveals its falseness, only to rescue the hope in the name of the lasting implications of the term Latin America: please include us, Latin Americans, as yours: I myself, who believe that artists and writers from Latin America neither have to show passports nor wave ﬂags; [I who believe that] art has to speak in its own way without any sign of origins; . . . [I myself who] have come to wonder whether Latin American art or Latin America exists, am myself surprised when I consider the possibility that we ought to denaturalize these overused categories in order to reinvent them through other critical strategies and tools until the art of Latin America becomes part of the visible world, on the global map, which is being taken apart and put back together in the 21st century, this time around not so as to fulﬁll a condescending quota, not as the last fetish of the Others, but as art that reimagines . . . the world that it carries on and expands, without losing its singularity, [which is] the horizon of difference.”40\n\nIntroduction / 23\n\nIn sum, in debates about the arts, Latin America seems to be an enigma that at times dissolves the term, at times recomposes it. Baltasar Gracián’s old Agudeza y arte del ingenio (1648) seems to apply: “Poco es ya discurrir lo possible, sino se trasciende a lo impossible [sic]” (as things are, it is of little use to discuss the possible if the impossible is not overcome).\n\nIn English, however, the idea of Latin America has not been much criticized, aside from the very historicizing of the old and new imperial connotations of the term and of the Cold War origins of Latin American Studies in the United States. Starting in the 1970s, an empirically solid and politically necessary criticism of the Cold War connotations of Latin American Studies emerged. This constituted an important intellectual and political terrain on which to base a non-imperial, more socially conscious, and even radical US Latin Americanism. Soon, other criticisms emerged about the lack of rigor and politicization of US Latin American Studies. Moreover, by the end of the Cold War, the distinguished US Latin Americanist Peter Smith wondered whether the 1990s world circumstances “presented an occasion to re-evaluate the entire concept of ‘Latin America’ and its practical signiﬁcance.” Thus, he clearly stated that “perhaps it was an outmoded construct, a romantic relic of an idealistic past.” But then this expert in US-Latin America relations saved the term from extinction with more of the same: “Ironically these doubts were spreading just at the time when political and diplomatic coordination could provide Latin America’s leaders with a potent and practical weapon for confronting and shaping global prospects in the century to come.” I have my doubts whether the way to face twenty-ﬁrst-century massive violence, total Mexican and Central American (human and economic) integration with the United States, the new US-Cuba relation, terrorism, and inequality is more Latin Amerianism. But the fact is that none of these criticisms was ever truly about the idea of Latin America and its deep-rooted cultural, racial, and linguistic innuendos.41 In the 1990s, as a result of post–Cold War scenarios, religious faith in globalization and hyper-specialization in various social sciences (especially economics, political science, and anthropology), US area studies, including Latin American Studies, were considered passé. So much talk about the post-this and post-that global world meant many challenges for the kind of US Latin Americanism that had boomed in the 1970s and 1980s. But the\n\n24 / Introduction\n\nvery idea of Latin America was never truly challenged. By 2011, three former presidents of the US Latin American Studies Association (LASA), Sonia Álvarez, Arturo Arias, and Charles R. Hale, articulated what was advanced as the alternative form of Latin Americanism for the twenty-ﬁrst century, for a world that had lost all its innocence, especially its epistemological naïveté. They proposed a revisualizing and decentering of Latin American Studies: “We contend that LAS [Latin American Studies] has beneﬁted enormously from deepened engagement with feminist theory, critical theories of race and ethnicity, various currents of inter- and postdisciplinary intellectual work associated with cultural studies, and with general epistemological scrutiny, starting with the very idea of ‘Latin America.’”42 Hence the authors called for LASA’s inclusion of Latin Americans, of oppressed people within Latin America, of the academic production by Latin Americans, and of Latin American epistemics, philosophy, and aesthetics. For, they argued, following Walter Mignolo, Latin America was “no longer a geographical entity to be studied,” it was now “a reorientation of knowledge, an epistemology that looks at global concerns from a Latin American perspective.” In other words, Latin America is no more, and yet there is a “Latin American perspective.” In this way, the authors considered the idea of “Latin America” to have been criticized and redeﬁned, and nonetheless to have survived all this, like a cat that always lands on its feet, no matter how far it falls. In fact, this serious criticism mentioned no doubts whatsoever about the very notion of Latin America. A Martian reader would understand that there had been many political, conceptual, and moral debates regarding Latin America, but would not learn exactly what a category such as Latin America was, or why it was needed.43 Thus the advantage of revisualizing Latin Americanism was simply more Latin America, assumed as an unquestioned automatism in English. Revisualizing Latin America would mean, the authors stated clearly, not questioning what Latin America means, but including more voices in the same meanings. Needless to say, this was no small feat in English, but it did not cast serious doubt on the category of Latin America. A signiﬁcant, relatively recent criticism of the idea of Latin America in English was Walter Mignolo’s The Idea of Latin America (2005): “An excavation,” he argues, “of the imperial/colonial foundation of the ‘idea’ of Latin America that will help us unravel the geo-politics of knowledge from the perspective of coloniality, the untold and unrecognized historical counterpart of modernity.”44 Indeed, this was a devastating criticism of the undeniable imperial DNA of the term, made in the name of a new perspective, that of “coloniality,” which, Mignolo explains, “emerge[s] out of the con-\n\nIntroduction / 25\n\ndition of the ‘colonial wound,’ the feeling of inferiority imposed on human beings who do not ﬁt the predetermined model in Euro-American narratives.” As important as this criticism could be, I believe, it was not a doubting of but rather a strong reafﬁrmation of essential parts of what Latin America has meant for a long time: a real, racio-cultural, different, and alternative ontology (if now based not on racial and cultural mixture, not on French or Spanish versions of Latinity, but on the purity of its intrinsic indigenous component). Like the old ﬁlosofía de lo latinoamericano, Mignolo’s work maintains the connotation of Latin America as a cultural place that naturally calls for utopias; as a constant peeling out of layers of inauthenticity in order to get to the real heart of the artichoke: an unspeciﬁed native soul formed either by reference to Nahuatl- or Quechuaspeaking peoples, in sixteenth- or twenty-ﬁrst-century Mexico or Peru, or to the so-called Latinos in the United States. Thus, as Mignolo argues, it is possible to afﬁrm that “40 million Latino/as in the U.S. have already given themselves a shake and begun to brush the imperial memories out of their/our bodies.” Don Santiago Ramón y Cajal—that wise, early twentiethcentury Spanish (I guess “Latino”) neuroscientist—would not only have marveled at the very possibility of forty million very different people having the same imperial memories; he would also have wondered what the other real memories in those Latin neurons might have been. All in all, I think Mignolo’s criticism was not a questioning of Latin America, but a reafﬁrmation of Latin America as business as usual: it radicalized, and comme il faut in English and through an assumed radical alterity, the lasting and powerful ethno-cultural utopian implications of the term Latin America.45 Mignolo’s coloniality partook of the larger “new” Latin Americanism that began to emerge in the literature departments of US universities in the 1990s. This trend was advanced, as it were, as an odd edict: “no longer there is either a reality or an epistemology to stand on and yet Latin America, the concept, we love you.” This was a post-post-modernist disenchantment that once more proved that the poet’s truth has no tense: “La decadencia añade verdad pero no halaga” (decadence adds truth but it does not cajole).46 Through the 1960s and 1970s, for many US progressive students and scholars, Latin America meant either the Marxist or Maoist struggles in Cuba, Nicaragua, Peru, or Argentina or the vital US solidarity with people repressed by murderous dictatorships. During the 1980s and 1990s, however, too many things happened to their idea of Latin America—too many in the realm of academic concerns and theories, and too many in the world. Ugly democracies—there are no other kind—emerged all over the continent; revolutions in Cuba and Nicaragua lost their utopian and\n\n26 / Introduction\n\ncandid appeal; Marxism and “scientiﬁc materialism” became “passé” in academic forums full of “epistemological” daily revolutions; and then 1989 happened. Thus the revolt of epistemology—“the investigation of what distinguishes justiﬁed belief from opinion,”47 which challenged the scientiﬁc and political conviction of the “Latin America” of revolutions, dependencia theory, and ﬁxed political teleologies. US literature departments began to advance Latin Americanism in different and contentious combinations, as a self-assumed radical—in both theoretical and practical political terms—category in which no scientiﬁc or cultural assumption was left unchallenged—except for the very idea of Latin America. Thus such literary scholars as Alberto Moreiras, Román de la Campa, Jon Beasley-Murray, and John Beverley have engaged in a sort of disciplinary soliloquy on the meaning of this radical option. Beyond theoretical nuances and grandiloquent assertions—difﬁcult to follow for outsiders to the soliloquy like myself—it is hard to pinpoint a simple questioning of the use of the term Latin America. They indeed repackage the old connotations of the term with lots of new options for the US-centered academic left, meant to serve a post-1960s, post-1970s, and post–September 11 world. Moreiras, for instance, questions—or so I reckon—all epistemological assumptions that had justiﬁed romance philology or literary criticism, or history itself, but he has few doubts about the “civilizational” role that the very idea of Latin America still has to play in a supposed unseen “history threshold”: “The Latin American civilizational crossroad [El cruce civilizacional latinoamericano] and its intermediate or vestibular [sic] position in relation to the macro-process associated with globalization, furnish today’s Latin America with a crucial role in the crossroad [encrucijada] of history.”48 But, one wonders, when in the midst of a presumed new universe big bang would it make logical and practical sense to wonder about the role to be played by the earth’s mythical Atlantis? For his part, John Beverley, as a “gringo bueno” (his phrase), though not advocating violent struggle as the strategy to follow in today’s Latin America, expressed nostalgia for the old revolutionary violence—thus, he disdained such intellectuals as Beatriz Sarlo, who have engaged in a serious self-criticism of the violent option. “Part of the originality and promise of the armed struggle in Latin America was embodied in the cultural superstructure,” he argued. Hence Gabriel García Márquez or Julio Cortazar, he suggested, came from the “vanguard functions of the guerrilla focus.” Still, one could be, as Joseph Roth or Stefan Zweig were, nostalgic for the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but neither they in the 1930s nor anyone today talks of reembodying the Austro-Hungarian Empire as civilization. And I\n\nIntroduction / 27\n\ndo not really know whether Che Guevara, as Beverley argued, ought to be considered the cause of the 1970s Latin American literature; the human condition, however, is such that indeed great violence has produced indispensable artistic achievements that are valuable—unlike the idea of Latin America—as our species’s reminders of evilness, not as nostalgia for violence or creativity.49 The revolt of epistemologists is sensitive to the criticism of engaging in jargon, and especially of being a US-centered academic trend that ultimately could be seen as imperial epistemology all over again. Beverley thus considers Argentineans or Mexicans who criticize the US revolt of epistemology as “neo-Arielistas”—old fashioned criollos or mestizos who grasp neither the authenticity of Latin America nor the worth of UScentered academic theories. So Mexican or Brazilian intellectuals who pursue old-fashioned philology or partake of the conﬁnes of their respective languages—those who write about, say, the problem of the very notion of Latin America and ﬁnd tools more in Jorge Cuesta or Carlos Vaz Ferreira than in the last cultural studies reader (in English)—all would be, for Beverley, “neo-Arielistas” who have not overcome “a colonial genealogy.” They represent neither their people nor any good social struggle but “the anxiety of intellectuals of bourgeois or middle-class background [that is, all intellectuals], generally ethnically European or mestizo [that is, everybody in the Latin conﬁnes of America], who are threatened with being pushed off the stage of history by, on the one hand, neoliberalism and globalization [Which one? Christendom, the Spanish and Portuguese languages? Modern times? The cosmopolitanism inherent in any kind of cultural production? Or the Internet?] and, on the other, by a heterogeneous and multiform proletarian/popular subject on whose behalf they had pretended to speak [Who pretends to speak for whom?].”50 In sum, the revolt of epistemologists, though hard to follow, is clear in its democratizing will—although expressed in a very elitist language and setting—in its anticapitalist but unclear political options, and in its dependence on the idea of Latin America. Beverley is adamant about his goal: “the afﬁrmation of the distinctiveness of Latin America as a ‘civilization’ in the face of North American and European domination, without falling back on the exhausted formulas of complacent creole-mestizo nationalism.” I myself consider the revolt of epistemologists less than a proof of the import of Latin America as a civilization and more as one more reason, if not the most important, to give up the very idea of Latin America. How would an epistemological revolt in US university literature departments look without recourse to Latin America?51\n\n28 / Introduction\n\nIn turn, historian Michel Gobat advanced, in English, a new and more nuanced examination of the origins of the term Latin America. Unlike both Mignolo and the epistemologists, Gobat’s account of the idea of Latin America fully includes the vast literature on the subject in languages other than English. Rather than emphasizing the input of the French Empire to the term, he rightly highlighted the impact of the 1856 regional protests against the William-Walker-ﬁlibustered regime established in Nicaragua. In fact, Gobat’s is the ﬁrst full-ﬂedged account of the Nicaraguan affair and its multiple echoes among Spanish American intellectuals. Before the French-led invasion of Mexico, the Walker adventure in Nicaragua was the event that shocked many republics in the continent; it was a great stimulus for “unity” among the newly created republics against the imperial and ﬁlibuster policies of the United States. But Walker’s was not the only ﬁlibuster adventure launched from US territory after the Mexican-American War. There were many, begun not only by US citizens but, for instance, by the Cuban Narciso López, who attempted to invade Cuba. Walker himself had tried before to take over Baja California and Sonora. What is common in all these ﬁlibuster adventures is the support not of the entire United States but of US southern governments, often in opposition to the federal government (in 1848, López offered the direction of his Cuban adventure to Senator Jefferson Davis and to Robert E. Lee, who declined). Walker’s Nicaraguan adventures say more about US internal contradictions than about all-powerful US imperialism; more about the origins of the US Civil War than of the post-1898 US empire. Walker ended his days with no support from the US federal government and abandoned by his men who had been armed by southern states, shot by a Honduran ﬁring squad in 1860. But Gobat derives from the reaction to Walker’s Nicaraguan adventure an archaeology of hope in the term Latin America as a democratic, antiimperialist, and antiracist idea.52 For Gobat, the early proponents of the term Latin America were liberals, democrats, and antiracists who fought the imperial racist policies of the United States. Thus, regardless of the conspicuous racial, undemocratic, and elite connotations of the term, which Gobat acknowledges, he ﬁnds in the term a recessive gene of moral hope. Gobat is clear, or clearer than his 1850s historical characters: “Spanish American intellectuals, politicians, and diplomats increasingly viewed their relations with the United States in terms of a race war.” For “strategic concerns alone did not push Spanish American elites to identify their societies with the Latin race.\n\nIntroduction / 29\n\nThey also adopted the concept to counter the racist views undergirding U.S. expansionism.” Because racism was somehow alien to Latin America and had to be imported: “An inﬂux of U.S. travelers during the California Gold Rush brought U.S. racism to the Southern Hemisphere in dramatic ways.” Hence, following Miguel Rojas Mix but pushing the argument forward according to current race theory in US academe, Gobat highlights the interesting democratic contentions of such intellectuals and statesmen as Bilbao or Arosemena, making them soldiers in an antiracist army of nonstate popularizers of the idea of Latin America—though all of them were statesmen tout court, and though the term was never really popular in the nineteenth century. Hence Gobat’s Latin Americanist conclusion: One way to decolonize Latin America might indeed be to erase the term from the global map. But it is also true that an anti-imperial and democratic ethos undergirded this geopolitical entity from the start. That this spirit is still alive is evident not just in the passionate latinoamericanismo of leftist leaders such as Venezuela’s recently deceased Hugo Chávez, but also in the efforts of some Latina/o activists to remap the U.S.-Mexican borderlands— and perhaps the entire United States—as Latina/o America. . . . Given the vast movement of Latina/os and Latin Americans between North and South America, perhaps it is not preposterous to imagine, as the image created by Pedro Lasch suggests, that one day the entire Western Hemisphere may be remapped as Latina/o America.53\n\nTo each saint his veladora, and to each Latin Americanist her hope; but, since I do not see or feel the hope, the redeeming democratic aspects, in either the latinoamericanismo of the Hugo Chávez style, or in the genetics of Latinness, or in the Begriffsgeschichte of the term Latin America, I cannot say how beautiful or interesting it will be when the entire continent becomes Latino/a. What I can say is that among the earlier articulators of the idea of Latin America, there were indeed a few insightful characters who advanced ideas of equality and justice, at times beyond the strong, nineteenthcentury racial lines—as when Bilbao opposed Chile’s war against the Araucano Indians in the name of “the good news of fraternity supported in the respect of races’ autonomy.”54 But that does not make Latin America— which is, after all, a racial term—a spring of profound antiracism in the language of twenty-ﬁrst-century US identity politics. Indeed, republican or liberal networks of nineteenth-century Spanish American intellectuals were of great symbolic magnitude, for these characters were at the core of the thinking and governing of their respective\n\n30 / Introduction\n\nnations. They all wrote poems, history, essays, political plans, technocratic treaties, or travel books at the same time that they were senators or even presidents of their respective countries. But that does not make them popular messiahs of antiracist republicanism, as Gobat and, more recently, James E. Sanders have maintained. “It is Latin Americans,” writes Sanders, commenting on mid-nineteenth-century Colombian and Mexican liberals, “who challenged the importance and meaning of race, posing universalism as a powerful opposing force.”55 Thus, Bilbao, and Giuseppe Garibaldi in Uruguay, become, for Sanders, “counter-mentalité” (vis-à-vis Europe and the United States), despite the fact that they and many others were at times more liberals than democrats, or the other way around; at times admirers and connoisseurs of the United States, at times critics; often Masons and Catholics; always Spanish and French speakers, always part and parcel of French, Spanish, US, and English discussions of constitutionalism, liberalism, republicanism, equality, freedom, and fraternity. To be sure, in the 1880s Martí was what can be called a radical republican; but he was so because he was a Catholic, an admirer of Thoreau, obsessed with war and violence, and a follower of Henry George (socialist but racist)—“aquel mismo amor del Nazareno puesto en la lengua práctica de nuestros días” (that same love of the Nazarene articulated in the practical languages of our times), said Martí of George’s Progress and Poverty (1877).56 Politically and intellectually, Bilbao, Arosemena, and Martí deserve the admiration displayed by Gobat—or Rojas Mix or Sanders. But, on one hand, a twenty-ﬁrst-century believer of atomic theory can indeed ﬁnd surprising and telling Lucretius’s ideas about particles; but it would be unwise to call him Einstein. On the other, the best that can be said about them is not that they were sublime counter-mentalités, the true and only antiracists. No. The best homage to these and other Spanish American thinkers, yesterday or today, is to de-exoticize them, to consider them as skillful and unskillful as Tocqueville, as good and as bad. That Latin America was originally an anti-imperialist concept was true to the extent that it was anti-US. But Latin America was and is an imperial concept. And yet, it would be as misleading to say that the use of the term Latin in Bilbao or among late nineteenth-century mulatto Cuban intellectuals in the United States was a full-ﬂedged racial marker—meaning what “Latino” means in today’s United States—as it would be to say that it was conclusively antiracist. In fact, 1850s articulations of Latin America were part of the secularization and modern translation of the Enlightenment and Catholic senses of brotherhood. Of course, before the “Latin” preﬁx even existed,\n\nIntroduction / 31\n\n“universal brotherhood” was part of modern political theology and of late eighteenth-cenury criollo patriotisms. The Americanism of the wars of independence often used “fraternidad,” though the term was then closer to its old Catholic roots than to the French revolutionary sense. Moreover, early versions of the concept of Latin America—articulated either by Bilbao or M. Chevalier—charged the term with a strong sense of fraternity derived from the many trends that fed the concept. Old Catholic, Iberian notions of “fraternidades,” together with French revolutionary notions of fraternité, as well as Masonic fraternité (many of the Spanish-speaking early sponsors of Latin America were Masons), Saint-Simonianism, nineteenth-century mutualism—all charged the term with a sense of fraternity. This was a sense not free from contradictions, especially in view of the strong “universalism”—beyond the Latin command—implied by nineteenthcenury notions of fraternité. Therefore, at times the fraternidad implied in the meaning of Latin America was a sense of racial fraternidad, at times a Catholic sense beyond race and Latinity, as when Bilbao afﬁrmed, “Amar á tu prójimo” (Love thy neighbor): “Fraternity is both a principle and a feeling. It is a great refuge against life’s sorrows and against frightening indifference. How could one not love one’s own neighbor, one’s own brother, that who recognizes in himself the omnipotence of liberty. My neighbor is another me; he is the depositary of my same spirituality; hence the embrace, the love within the community and identity of this great essence is necessary. Here lies the ineradicable fundament of democracy [Hé aquí el fundamento inexpugnable de la democracia].”57 Fraternidad was the keyword of nineteenth-century conservative Spanish thought. In the 1820s, the inﬂuential Catholic thinker and priest Francisco Alvarado asked Spanish liberals, “Charlatans without substance, from where have you taken if not from the Gospel those words Equality, Liberty, and Fraternity, . . . whose meaning you do not even understand?” The most inﬂuential nineteenth-century conservative thinker in the Spanish-speaking world, Juan Donoso Cortés, also argued that equality, freedom, and fraternity came not from the French revolution but from Calvary, and republican ideas had only made of them blasphemies: “la república de las tres mentiras” (the republic of the three lies). Bilbao appealed to the less reactionary, but not less Catholic, sense of fraternity, that of Lamennais, whose “règne de la fraternité” included modern liberal policies and economic reforms in order to allow people access to property, credit, and education.58 This was indeed revolutionary in terms of nineteenth-century racial theory, but not in those of the twenty-ﬁrst century. During the nineteenth century, the idea of fraternity, like that of Latin\n\n32 / Introduction\n\nAmerica, was racialized in, for instance, mutualistic societies in the United States. And yet, in the idea of Latin America there remains indeed a sense of quasi-Catholic fraternity, which has gained good and bad uses over time. Gobat identiﬁes this fraternity and sees it as fully antiracist. I wish it had been that. For if indeed, as Gobat argues, early proponents of the idea of Latin America conceived their antagonism against the United States as a race war, the idea of Latin America was simply their racist weapon among the then-available racist arsenal. The concept has implied peculiar forms of racism that indeed cannot be necessarily equated to those of the United States. As much as I would like to share Gobat’s philological and political optimism about the trajectory of the concept, I do not ﬁnd any empirical or philosophical argument in the history and functioning of the term to be very optimistic about. But what is more telling in Gobat’s recent account is in fact the enduring power of the term Latin America: it still stirs the alluring ideas of liberation and hope. Why the need to ﬁnd in such a dubiously racial and ill-reputed term such interesting lessons for the present? Why not simply ﬁnd them in redistribution, equality, or freedom of circulation in the continent? About Latin America, it seems, we can say what Bernard Williams said of religion: “It will be hard to give it up even if it is an illusion.”59\n\nWhat is in a name that makes it so eloquent and enduring? First, I will state some very basic connotations of the term in order to then say something more about the concept’s roots in iberismo and latinité, which explain many of its lasting connotations. A note on Brazil and past and present anti–Latin Americanism, as well as a brief review of the impact of the term Latinos in the United States with regard to the current meaning of Latin America, will then be indispensable. Then I take a brief detour in order to test the actual presence of Latin America and its connotations in popular parlance. To be sure, this is a difﬁcult ﬁeld to explore; thus I construct, through memory, my memory, and through popular music, a window through which to examine the popular diffusion of the idea of “Latin America.” I do all this in order to submit a commentary on the most important twenty-ﬁrst-century form in which the term has survived—namely, the UScentered textbook existence of Latin America. This is my own backdoor attempt, as a historian, at self-therapy. But let me be clear at once: there is plenty of extraordinary scholarship in English about Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia. But Latin America is another question entirely, and the problem\n\nIntroduction / 33\n\nis that this ﬁne scholarship often feels the need to format its ﬁndings in a Latin American manner. As historian José Moya has stated, “A focused interpretation of scattered studies could demonstrate that, as broad categories go, this one has more historical signiﬁcance and cultural meaning than other continental labels such as Europe, Asia, and Africa.” Indeed so, for Latin America was a racial idea (like “Africa”) that has undergone a moral upgrading (unlike “Africa”), as did that originally imperialist and racist idea, “Mitteleuropa” (Friedrich Neumann), which after 1914, through nostalgia, acquired the meaning of a mythical time of coexistence of nations and races, of tolerance and fruitful cultural promiscuity. And yet, whereas post-1919 “Mitteleuropa” implied the old “saggezza asburgica” (Habsburg wisdom), as Claudio Magris put it—the art of “postponing the end, of delaying dusk,” ﬁnding an “ironic and painful arrangement”—the expression Latin America in the twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst centuries has implied a presumably blissful ethnic exit from Western history through an un-ironic encroachment on a Western cliché.60 As a historian, in showing US Latin Americanism’s limitations, I only highlight the enduring power of the term Latin America. “Area studies can very rapidly become parochialism,” Sanjay Subrahmanyam has taught us, commenting on the category of South Asia. He goes on to say that “it is as if these conventional geographical units of analysis, fortuitously deﬁned as givens for the intellectually slothful, and the result of complex (even murky) processes of academic and non-academic engagement, somehow become real and overwhelming. Having helped create these Frankenstein’s monsters, we are obliged to praise them for their beauty, rather than grudgingly acknowledge their limited functional utility.”61 Indeed, I therefore conclude with a happy, if circumscribed and simple, historian’s embrace of the concept. For the term is a malleable vessel ready to be ﬁlled with interesting, important, more-than-national histories, and not only Latin American ones. As I was writing this, I was, after all, the director of the University of Chicago’s Center for Latin American Studies. I thus carefully embrace the term, like Father Guillermo Schulenburg, former abbot of the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, who neither believed in Juan Diego nor in the divine painting of the image, but who nevertheless had no doubt about the relevance of mi santísima Virgen de Guadalupe.\n\nONE\n\nThe Connotations of an Idea: On the basic connotations of the term Latin America, though said connotations are further elucidated as the essay unfolds and are only stated baldly here De vegades, cal ser pervers per misericòrdia. —Joan Fuster, “Aforismes i insolències” (Sagitari, 1985), in Joan Fuster, Indagacions i astúcies: Antología de textos assagístics (Barcelona: El Garbell, 1995), 111\n\nLatin America is a modern concept. This much we know. No one but the poets of the ancient lingua franca were considered Latins in seventeenthcentury New Spain or in eighteenth-century France. Also, “Latin America” is a phrase that did not occur in spoken vernacular Spanish and Portuguese until recently. And there is that other certitude: “Latin America” alludes to history, language, and culture. In fact, it constitutes a lasting conﬁrmation of racial beliefs. Thus, as a modern, highbrow conjecture about culture, but indeed about race, the term Latin America is unable to designate a rapidly changing reality. It is not surprising that the term has undergone two centuries of semantic reincarnations. But, so far, I believe, every rebirth has been a renewal of belief in the term’s ability to designate the same region, people, and phenomena as it has from the outset—the Bilbao Law for Latin America. In fact, “Latin America,” more than as a name, has served as an ossiﬁed metaphor whose lasting linguistic presence bears witness to itself—a metaphor and an institution that have captured poetically, as it were, important beliefs and empirical data whose collective meaning no single concept seems capable of capturing in various European languages. As Giambattista Vico believed, to conceive metaphors is to grasp the intricate relations of phenomena that at ﬁrst sight appear dissimilar. In poetry, as María Zam-\n\nThe Connotations of an Idea / 35\n\nbrano believed, “the metaphor has a deep, prior role in culture. . . . Its function is that of deﬁning a reality unfathomable to reason, which can be captured in another way, . . . a form of continuity with long-distant times and mentalities.” Hence the importance and indispensability of metaphors in historical knowledge. Thus also their danger: they tend to ossify, to serve as mental routines and not as attempts at knowing or at deciphering. Ossiﬁed historical expressions that, for those in the know, truly work as vital metaphors—such as “las dos Españas,” “la España invertebrada,” or “the frontier in American history,” “melting pot,” or “community”—become a way of avoiding something that is otherwise hard to understand.1 In brief, through its changing historical meanings, the metaphor of Latin America has conveyed the following meanings. 1. The encounters of modern empires. Thus it has meant imperial agendas or resistance to empire: the French Empire vs. the Anglo-Saxon; the Spanish Empire vs. the American (US); or the new race, the Cosmic one, Ariel, vs. the old races; or the notion of internal colonialism, say, in thinking of Latinos/as in the United States, or of the Guatemalan national economy, or of Nahuatl speakers within Mexico. Thus the term has incorporated the following. —Anti-Americanism: speciﬁcally, anti-US expansionism and Catholic anti-Protestantism. Over time anti-Americanism in “Latin” latitudes has sometimes become, as in France or Spain, a form of anti-Semitism (for “everybody knows,” said certain forms of nineteenth-century European Latinism, that Slavs or Germans have Jewish blood; or, “everybody knows” that the Jewish lobby controls the United States). Anti-Americanism also has been expressed as protest against something huge called “the System” (for “everybody knows” that the United States controls world capitalism and globalization). José Enrique Rodó’s Ariel (1900) was for long this antiAmericanism’s overused metaphor—“No se puede exigir una ingenuidad más uruguaya” (A more Uruguayan naïveté cannot be demanded), said his contemporary Julio Herrera y Reissig of Rodó’s book. As early as 1926, Mexican writer (then resident in the United States) Martín Luis Guzmán already considered the Ariel trope “a set of established ideas almost always a priori . . . which has been maintained over a century of practical nullity and with neither time nor calm to think.”2 —Violence. Latin America as a concept has not only included violence as part of its history (what history escapes this characterization?), but has incorporated a fascination with redemptive violence. That is, it is not that Latin America was or is violent, but that Latin America means love for some\n\n36 / Chapter One kind of violence—which is so"
