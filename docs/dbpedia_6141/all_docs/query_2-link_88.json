The document lists 65 notable writers from Kingsley Amis to Andr√© Malraux who held right-wing, conservative, or reactionary political views across a range of ideologies including nationalism, imperialism, Catholicism, libertarianism, and in some cases support for fascism or Nazism. It discusses how some writers like Saul Bellow, Kingsley Amis, and John Dos Passos moved from early left-wing views to the right as they aged. The list includes novelists, poets, playwrights, historians and others from many countries who expressed right-wing stances through their works or public statements on issues like politics, religion, and culture.",
