        "text": "consecrate your being to pure love.\n\nTurn every thought to Goddess Tara.\n\nShe will bear you tenderly across the raging sea\n\nof separation and individuality.\n\nBe utterly dedicated to her reality.\n\nCry aloud Ma Kali, Ma Kali.\n\nKnow that she can clarify\n\nthe inconceivable maze of relativity.\n\nTo hope for assistance and guidance through this world\n\nfrom wealth, relatives, and religious rites\n\nprovides no profound solution.\n\nHave you forgotten that everyone is lost?\n\nWhere are you now? Why are you traveling?\n\nThis cosmos is the strange theater where souls act,\n\nwearing various costumes and disguises.\n\nThis intricate play of transparent energy\n\nis initiated, sustained, and dissolved by Kali,\n\nwho is the dream power of Absolute Reality.\n\nAt this very moment, you are resting\n\non the vast lap of Mother’s cosmic dream\n\nthat you misperceive\n\nas the narrow prison of suffering.\n\nWhy abandon the kingdom of awareness\n\nto obsession with self and disdain for others,\n\nto hollow passion and abject clinging?\n\nYou are creating a disease without a remedy.\n\nThe brief day of your earthly life is almost over.\n\nMeditate now on beautiful Black Tara.\n\nShe is seated upon the jewel island of essence\n\nin the transparent sea of ultimacy.\n\nThis poet sings drunkenly:\n\n“Tara! Tara! Tara!\n\nYour name is ambrosia.\n\nMay all beings enter the secret sanctuary\n\nthrough this name,\n\ntasting your unique sweetness,\n\nself-luminous awareness.”"
