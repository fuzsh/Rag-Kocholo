        "text": "This time I shall devour Thee utterly, Mother Kali!\n\nby Ramprasad (Ramprasad Sen)\n\nOriginal Language Bengali\n\nThis time I shall devour Thee utterly, Mother Kali!\n\nFor I was born under an evil star,\n\nAnd one so born becomes, they say, the eater of his mother.\n\nThou must devour me first, or I myself shall eat Thee up;\n\nOne or the other it must be.\n\nI shall besmear my hands with black\n\nand with black my face;\n\nWith black I shall besmear the whole of my body.\n\nAnd when Death seizes me,\n\nwith black I shall besmear his face.\n\nO Mother, I shall eat Thee up\n\nbut not digest Thee;\n\nI shall install Thee in my heart\n\nAnd make Thee offerings with my mind.\n\nYou may say that by eating Kali\n\nI shall embroil myself\n\nwith Kala, Her Husband,\n\nbut I am not afraid;\n\nBraving His anger,\n\nI shall chant my Mother's name.\n\nCome what may, I shall eat Thee up \n\nThee and Thy retinue \n\nOr lose my life attempting it.\n\n-- from Kali: The Black Goddess of Dakshineswar, by Elizabeth U. Harding\n\n<<Previous Poem | More Poems by Ramprasad (Ramprasad Sen) | Next Poem >>\n\nView All Poems by Ramprasad (Ramprasad Sen)\n\nIvan M. Granger\n\nRamprasad's poetry to the Mother Goddess Kali is playful, petulant, blissful, rageful -- and sometimes shocking. His poetry shows the whole tempestuous relationship between a child and his Mother, between the soul and God. He doesn't just show one face to the Divine Mother, he doesn't just pretend to be 'the good little boy;' he communicates everything to Her nakedly. And, in doing so, he achieves a profound intimacy with the Divine.\n\nThough many may find this particular poem disturbing, honestly this is one of my favorites. You could say it is a tantrum of devotion. Ramprasad gives the Mother Goddess an ultimatum: Consume me utterly, or I will consume you! \"One or the other it must be.\" Consider that for a moment: What does it mean to eat God? What does it mean to be eaten by God?\n\nThen he gives us this haunting image of covering himself completely in black. \"With black I shall besmear the whole of my body.\" What does that mean?\n\nTo understand this, it helps to know more about the imagery associated with the Goddess Kali. Kali is depicted with black skin and she is naked, symbolic of the Eternal Void with which she clothes herself. So when Ramprasad says he is besmearing his hands and face and whole body with black, he is declaring that he is making himself like her, clothed in the purity of the Void. He is intentionally erasing himself, removing all separation between himself and the Divine. This sounds so deliberate, that it may actually be part of a ritualized Tantric visualization used in meditation.\n\nRamprasad even says that when death comes for him, he will blacken death's face, as well. He is saying that he will turn even death into representative of the Eternal. Death will no longer be death, but simply one more expression of Kali.\n\nIn the Hindu pantheon, when Kali is depicted with her male aspect, with her \"husband,\" that husband is Shiva, the white-skinned representation of God as the Eternal beyond manifestation. But sometimes the name Kala is used to represent her husband, in counterpoint to Kali. Kala means 'time.' So when he states, \"You may say that by eating Kali / I shall embroil myself / with Kala, Her Husband,\" he is saying that he might get caught up in time, the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. But he proclaims, \"I am not afraid; / Braving His anger, / I shall chant my Mother's name.\" When the mind is securely fixed on the Divine Mother, on God, what does it matter whether you're caught on the wheel of life and death or not? If you have God, is there anything to fear?\n\nWe are all consuming God and, in turn, being consumed by God. To lose one's life, to become completely \"black,\" by throwing ourselves fully into that process -- well, that is the goal.\n\nRecommended Books: Ramprasad (Ramprasad Sen)\n\nThis Dance of Bliss: Ecstatic Poetry from Around the World Singing to the Goddess: Poems to Kali and Uma from Bengal Kali: The Black Goddess of Dakshineswar Mother of the Universe: Visions of the Goddess and Tantric Hymns of Enlightenment Great Swan: Meetings with Ramakrishna More Books >>"
