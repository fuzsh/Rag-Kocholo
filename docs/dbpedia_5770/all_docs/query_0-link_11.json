        "text": "1st Question :- HOW MANY AVATARS ARE THEIR OF MAA KALI ?\n\nIt is always said in Hindu Culture that all Goddess are one . but this is said because all the mother goddess are the avatar‚Äôs of the Maa Adi Shakti or Maa Adi Bhagwati or Maa MahaKali . but this doesn‚Äôt mean that all avatar‚Äôs have no difference in between them. Their are considerable differences in between all the mother goddesses .\n\nTo Note :- for example their are 64 goddesses , who are collectively called as ‚ÄúYogini Devi‚Äù. but each are different in every possible way ..\n\nSimilarly during navaratra we worship nine goddesses who are collectively called as ‚ÄúNava Durga Mata‚Äù . but each are greatly different from one another .\n\nIn The Same Context it is general thinking of people who know less or nothing about mother Kalika that their is only one form (or avatar) of her but in our study across various puranik literature and tantrik references we were able to find different ‚Äì different incarnation of goddess who is called by the same name ‚ÄúKali or Kalika‚Äù . And all these different forms or incarnation though have the same name but have a completely different iconography moreover the entire DIFFERENT mythological story is told in the reference of that particular avatar or incarnation .\n\nIn this section we will only try to understand about those different incarnation ,and yes when we are done with we may feel that all are about single mother goddess but we will also know that all the incidence of when Maa Kali Appeared or took an Avatar. How these forms are similar or what are the striking difference in between each of them ..\n\nBut Before going into details of What we have find out about different Incarnations who are called Maa Kali , First we will like to answer of How Many forms are their of Mahakali ?\n\n:‚Äì> 1St Page Reference :- Now when we were researching about the Different Incarnations of Mother Kali we find out about various references but the first one which attracted our attention was was a statement from ‚ÄúForward‚Äù Section of The Reference Book we Have Used in our Stude about Maa Kali. The Name of The Reference in ‚ÄúMahaKala Samhita:- Kamakala Khand‚Äù which was written by Dr Kishor Nath Jha . In the Forward Section which was written by G.C.Tripathi who was the Principal of G.N.Jha K.S. Vidyapeeth, Allahabad Who wrote and we quote :-\n\n‚ÄúGoddess Mahakali, according to this text, is the Chief Goddess of the whole Tantric System based on Vamacara Practices Who Manifests Herself in 51 (Fifty one) different female forms, Some Furious and other benign, in order to receive worship from her devotee according to their own concept of divinity and subjective preferences .‚Äù (Page snapshot attached below)\n\nfrom these lines we were able to get some idea their may be 51 Different forms or incarnations or manifestations of Mother Mahakali. So we dived into the reference for further study .\n\n:‚Äì> 2nd Page Reference :- When we read our reference tantrik book we were introduced to ‚ÄúNava Kali‚Äù i.e Nine forms of Kali Maa described by Dr.Kishor Nath Jha.\n\nThe Name of the Nava Kali (i.e 9 [Nine] manifestations of Kali Maa) are:- (as per Mahakala Samhita Uttara Khanda :- Kamakala Kali Khand written by Dr Kishor Nath Jha )\n\nDakshina Kali\n\nBhadra Kali\n\nShamshan Kali\n\nKaal Kali\n\nGuhya Kali\n\nKamaKala Kali\n\nDhana Kali\n\nSiddhi Kali\n\nChand Kali\n\n:‚Äì> 3rd Page Reference :-after researching the concept we were drawn to a second Writer who also tried to explain the concept of Mahakala Samhita Kamnakala Khand by converting the text to Hindi from Sanskrit . Dr Kishor Nath Jha has given us a detailed Introduction on Various concept described in Mahakal Samhita KamaKala Khand but did not present a Hindi Translations of all The Shloks , so to get a much better understanding we read the reference ‚ÄúMahakala Samhita Kamnakala Khand by Acharya Radheshyam Chaturvedi‚Äù .\n\nWhen we read this reference in Introduction we find some similar piece of references but when we started reading the book in detail then in its 14th Chapter (Chaturdashtam patal) we were able to find names of 25 different forms of Mata Mahakali .\n\nIt should be told here that Mata Mahakali has said in this section while she is answering to Lord Shiva & Lord Vishnu when they both asked her of How many forms or Manifestations of her are their in existence ? To this Question She answered :-\n\n‚ÄúShe has Many Crores of her forms which are beautiful , in all of them ‚ÄúThe Tripurasundari‚Äù is the Ultimate Beautiful Form. and\n\nShe has Eight Crore avatars or manifestations which are furious in appearance of which ‚ÄúKamakala Kali ‚Äù is the Ultimate furious form ‚Äù\n\n‚Äì 14th Patal Mahakala Samhita Kamnakala Khand\n\nAnd in the same answer she describes the Name of her Famous Manifestations or avatars which are commonly known in Agam Shastra:-\n\nThe 25 (Twenty five) manifestations which are mentioned here are as follows :-\n\nChamunda Bhairavi\n\nBhima\n\nGuhaKali\n\nDakshina kali\n\nChhinmasta\n\nEkjata\n\nKaal Samkarsini Kali\n\nShmashan kali\n\nKorangi\n\nBhadrakali\n\nKubjika\n\nUgrachanda\n\nPrachanda\n\nChandoga\n\nChandanaika\n\nChanda\n\nChandavati\n\nChandachanda\n\nChandi\n\nChandika\n\nBabhravi\n\nShivaduti\n\nKatyani\n\nDharmastaka\n\nKamakala Kali\n\nAfter this we in our research we expanded our research and obtained another reference or two difference reference which gave us more names of forms of Maa Kali .\n\n:‚Äì> 4th Page Reference :-These reference are :-\n\n‚ÄúStudies on The Tantras‚Äù which was published by ‚ÄúThe Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture‚Äù In Year 1989.\n\nA Research paper Written By Sikha Sarkar for PDH (Arts) In History in Year 1997 from University of Burdwan, West Bengal Entitled ‚ÄúThe Cult of Mother-Goddess in Bengal :- Its Origin And Development Upto 12th Century AD. ‚Äú\n\nFrom both these references, we got the Names of 11 (Eleven) different avatars of Maa Kali :-\n\nThe 11 (Eleven) Forms of Maa MahaKali which are described here are :- (As Per 1.)‚ÄúStudies on The Tantras‚Äù by ‚ÄúThe Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture 2.) Research paper entitled ‚ÄúThe Cult of Mother-Goddess in Bengal :- Its Origin And Development Upto 12th Century AD‚Äù. written by Sikha Sarkar 3.)‚ÄùJayadratha Yamala‚Äù [As Both Quoted this reference])\n\nKalika\n\nDambara Kali\n\nRaksa kali\n\nIndivara Kali\n\nDhandakalika\n\nRamana Kalika\n\nIsana Kalika\n\nJiva Kali\n\nVirya Kali\n\nPrajna Kali\n\nSaptarna Kali\n\nNote :- It is To be noted that these Both References has actually Quoted an another Older Agam text called ‚Äù Jayadratha Yamala‚Äù .\n\n:‚Äì> 5th Page Reference :-Our reading further extended to an really old Agama Text Which is really interesting and Its Author is also Equally Interesting and Mysterious. We are Talking about The Great Kali bhakta :- ‚ÄúTHE KALIDAS‚Äù and his tantrik Work Entitled ‚ÄúCidg Gana Candrika‚Äù for our research we used the English Introduction written by Sir Arthur Avalon. from this Old reference we Get the Names of 7 different forms of Kali Maa which were originally found written in Tantrik Work entitled ‚ÄúTantraloka‚Äù by ‚ÄúAbhinava gupta‚Äù.\n\nThe 7 (Seven) Different forms which are named and described here are :- (as per Cidg gana Chandrika by Kalidas (Translated to English by Arthur Avalon) & Tantraloka by Abhinava Gupta [As Cidga Gana Chandrika quoted Tantraloka])\n\nSrsti-Kali\n\nSthiti-Kali\n\nSamhara Kali\n\nRakta kali\n\nMrtyu Kali\n\nCandogra kali\n\nKalasamkarsani kali\n\n:‚Äì> 6th Page Reference :- Now after the above stated reference their are some forms which are fairly common in many of the Tantrik Works and also you will find the names in the above citations also .

As per Todal Tantra.\n\nNote 1. :- We have already eliminated the repeated names common in different references and mentioned all the references which we can find in the brackets infront of the name of manifestations . and it is also to be noted that the above list is based on very ancient reference however , we have not considered every tantra shastra in the above list for example like many scholars such as Rajesh dixit and more who have created a great work on Tantra Shastra have also said that , their are multiple forms of every single manifestation mentioned in the above list here for ex :\n\n‚Äù Karali, Vikarali, Matrujughosha, Chandrarekha, Chitrrekha, Dwija, Neelpataka, Yakshani (All 32 types), Tara, Chitra ‚Äù :- All these manifestations are considered as manifestations of Dakshina Kali . but we have left all these manifestations and just counted the primary source as per the consideration of ancient references and research papers based on ancient reference .\n\nNote 2. :- We have also left the name ‚ÄúMahaKali‚Äù from the above list because , as per all the above research , she is seen as the Prime Mother , How have Taken different avatars or manifestations, and the list of above mentioned 51 manifestations are just few of her forms .\n\nNote 3 :- It should also be noted that we haven‚Äôt read all the tantrik, mantrik & pauranik references , and so their could be More Number of Avatars left out , from which we are still not familiar with for example in the Kali Sahasranaam Stotram we can find 1000 names of just Mahakali where each name represents one manifestation of Mata Mahakali .\n\nwe will describe, about few of the thousands of which we could find of in the following sections .but list is a lot ..\n\nSo the Answer to the above Question :- HOW MANY AVATARS OR MANIFESTATIONS ARE THEIR OF MATA MAHAKALI ?\n\nAns :- By considering all the above cited references and considering the fact that we have not yet read all the Great mythological references in great detail Still\n\n‚ÄúIT IS SAFE TO SAY NOW THAT AT-LEAST THEIR ARE 51 AVATARS OR MANIFESTATIONS OR FORMS OF MATA MAHAKALI‚Äù. (As already told by various scholars like Dr Kishor Nath Jha , G.C.Tripathi and Acharya Ajay Kumar Uttam)\n\n(Note :-And this Number Could Easily Increase in the Near Future, based on our Further Readings, and We think that this Number Will not go down but it will surely go up.\n\nWe have just read Few Pauranik and Tantrik (Agam) References and we are looking forward to read More to see the Greatness of Mata Mahakali )\n\nSo Now After getting the answer of how many forms of Maa Mahakali are their , We will now consider mythological pauranik and tantrik references in detail and will tell you how these different avatars came into existence as per mythology. Here we are discussing the details about all the incarnation or avatars of Adishakti or Mahakali, who are referred by the name Kalika or Mother Kali and sharing the snapshot of the resource along with the explanation .\n\n1st Avatar.) MOTHER MAHAKALI (Or Just ‚ÄúKali Maa‚Äù):-\n\n‚ÄúTHE CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE & THE MOTHER OF ALL THREE GODS ‚Äì BRAHMA VISHNU & MAHESH (SHIVA)‚Äù\n\nMahakali is a eternal form who is commonly seen as the creator of universe. She is the supreme goddess of all creation and in various tantra shastra she is said to have 51 different manifestations by different scholars and tantriks, in which some appears to be furious and some appears to be benign. but all depends on the concept of divinity and based on subjective preference. this number has been in detailed explained in various pauranik and tantrik shastra.\n\nNow to start with the first form i,e The Great Mother Mahakali. we can find about her in the respected Tantrik text ‚Äì ‚ÄúYogini tantra, Neel tantra and Kali tantra‚Äù & A Upa-puran called ‚ÄúKalika puran ‚Äúand also in Shiva Puran (where the concept is slightly different) . we will explain our findings as per the reference . we will talk about the reference used in our study also but is a separate section of this website entitled ‚Äù Reference Study.‚Äù\n\na.) ‚ÄúMAHAKALI ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúYOGINI TANTRA‚Äù\n\nIn yogini tantra which is actually a collection of dialog‚Äôs between Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati .Here the Tantrik reference (ref to the reference tab for more info) while describing the creation of all Lord Vishnu and lord Brahma, Lord Shiva described about Mother Mahakali and called her as his (Lord Shivas) mother .\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MATA MAHAKALI (AS PER YOGINI TANTRA ):- Not much is said about her appearance in one instance in the stories of yogini tanta , only a slight description about her appearance is present in the stories of yogini tantra .\n\nIn the story of origin of the three gods, when Lord Shiva First saw, Mata Mahakali he described her appearance by saying :-\n\n‚ÄúShe is glowing like Sun , Moon and Fire . Beautiful Smelling flowers was all around her and she wear many jewelries standing in a place where nothing is present, She Exists‚Äù.\n\nHowever at the start of the Yogini tantra Lord Shiva worships Mata Mahakali and Describes her appearance in great detail .\n\nAt the beginning of this yogini tantra Mata Parvati ask her husband lord Shiva to describe Yogini tantra to her. to Which Lord Shiva replied that it is the most fruitful of all the tantra and as he is bound by her love and devotion, he will surely tell this great secret to her . But Before Starting he worships the Great Mother Mahakali . and Lord Shiva starts by describing the goddess as the cosmic mother (Vishvamata), He describes her appearance further by saying :-\n\nShe is dark as a thunderstorm, and he bows down to this form.\n\nAnd like the great Lightning her teeth is visible in her wide open mouth.\n\nShe is wearing a garland of Heads\n\nShe is ‚Äúdigambaram‚Äù (i.e devoid of maya) with disheveled long hair\n\nShe has a lolling tongue,\n\nShe has three reddened eyes, and from her bright face many moons get originated\n\nHer hairs are long and dark like the amavasya night and has the corpses of two corpse as her earrings who are adorned with various gems,\n\nShe wears a moon digit on her forehead, which are of the brightness of the Sun and the Moon.\n\nShe wears a waist-band of hands of the dead and she makes a terrifying roar and Laughs loudly,\n\nshe has two streams of blood pouring from her mouth, while her throat is red with blood.\n\nIn her four arms and\n\nIn Two arms she holds A cleaver, A head, and her other two arms are in Varadh Mudra (mudra of granting boons) and Abhaydaan Mudra (mudra of dispelling fears)\n\nLord Shiva further says that Mata Mahakali, is the supreme Parama and Nitya, and he bown down to the great goddess who is standing on a Shivaprat and exist over Mahakaal‚Äù.\n\nLord Shiva Further describes that Her Left Foot is over the heart of the corpse and in her right foot all the world and universe is completely present\n\nHer face is glowing like missions of suns shining\n\nShe is standing above ‚ÄúMahakala‚Äù . (In Some Tantric scriptures while describing ‚ÄúHaadi Kram Dhyaan‚Äù it is said that she is seated in viparita with Mahakala (Please note ‚ÄúKaadi Kram Dhyan is the main Dhyan Form with the Beej Mantra ‚ÄúKreem‚Äù which also says that Maa Kali is Standing above mahakali ,this is greatly explaine in our Tab Why KƒÅli Maa has her Tongue Out ? & What are Other Aspects of her Appearance? (As Per Devi Mahatmya, Shiva Puran , Mundaka Upnishad & Other Important Pauranik , Tantrik and Theological references)..) ‚Äù . However mainstream Tantrik Scriptures like Yogini Tantra and Mahanirvan Tantra and as Said the main ‚ÄúKaadi Kram Dhyan ‚Äù ect just Describe that Maa Kali is Standing Above ‚ÄúShivpret or Mahakala‚Äù describing that she is Beyond ‚ÄúThe Great Kala i.e Mahakala ‚Äù , and thats why she is Been Called as ‚ÄúMahakali Maa‚Äù.\n\nShe is Surrounded by Various jackals, yoginies and many bharava-gana.\n\nHer appearance is fearful like annihilation of the universe .\n\nShe exists in the cremation ground where all the gods (like Brahma ect) is worshipping her . lord shiva bows to the great goddess Mata Mahakali .\n\nthis is how she is been described in the Yogini tantra .\n\nEach time she is been described she is seen as a great goddess with great spiritual glow, which enlightened most of the universe and she is surrounded by animals like foxes and in presence of many yogini and shivaagan and Lord Shiva Worships her as his great mother and the goddess of all Creation .\n\n[ It is to be noted that this is the popular form in which we normally see her . How ever her form has a deeper meaning and all the Tantra Sahitya Books greatly describes her . this appearance is greatly described in our other tabs:- Why KƒÅli Maa has her Tongue Out ? & What are Other Aspects of her Appearance? (As Per Devi Mahatmya, Shiva Puran , Mundaka Upnishad & Other Important Pauranik , Tantrik and Theological references).. but we are dealing with the concept here in short. ]\n\nDescription of Appearance Of Mata Maha Kali :- as per :-\n\nMahakala Samhitakamkala khand By, Dr.Kishoor Nath Jha.\n\nKali Tantra By, Rajesh Dixit\n\nKali Upasana By, Rajesh Dixit\n\nKali Rahasaya by Pandit Shivdatt Misra Shastri.\n\nKali Tantra by Acharya Ajay Kumar Uttam\n\nKali -The Feminine Force By Ajit Mookerjee.\n\nColor of the Skin :- The Tantra believes that similar to the fact like all the color like red , green , yellow ,ect gets absorbed in the Dark Color , the Color of the Skin of Maa Mahakali is also dark like the dark Universe in which all the creations will get absorbed on day . Mata Mahakali is Nirgun (meaning She is Devoid of features and facts ) & Nirakar (Meaning she is Devoid of Form).\n\nShe resides in Cremation Ground :- The Great Goddess Mata Mahakali is Called as ‚ÄúShamshan Wasani‚Äù meaning one who resides in the cremation ground , but here tantra shastra means a place where all the Panchbhoot ( meaning five elements of life i.e Prithvi, Jal, Agni, Vayu & Aakasha) gets dissolved. Tantra Sahitya further says that Mata Kali only resides in the heart of a person whose heart is devoid of emotions .\n\nChita Burning in Cremation Ground :- This Means that in the heart of her devotee the Fire of Knowledge should be always burning so that human emotions could be easily controlled by that fire of knowledge. just like the burning fire in the Cremation Ground destroys the human body and the panchbhoot to nothing but ashes.\n\nPresence of Skulls and Bones along with Howling Jackals ect present in the Cremation Ground :- As per Tantra Shastra Skull and Bones are the symbolic of ultimate truth and howling Jackals are the symbolic representation of left overs of Panchbhoots . for ex a emotion of anger or rage can be suppressed by our minds by using the influence of knowledge but the emotion is not dead and like the howling jackals in the burning cremation ground the sound of that emotion will remain present howling in your hearts and mind.\n\nShavaAssan :- meaning the seat of the corpse . In Tantra Shastra it is said that a Shava (i.e a corpse) is a panchbhoot (i.e the 5 elements of Life) devoid of Shakti (i.e The Life force) . Tantra Shastra says when a devotee offers his/her own life force to Maa MahaKali. Then Maa MahaKali Truly provides her Blessings to that soul i.e provide salvation.\n\nMoon on her forehead (‡§∂‡§∂‡§ø ‡§∂‡•á‡§ñ‡§∞‡§æ):- Maa Mahakali is been called as ‚ÄúShashi Shikhar‚Äù in Tantra Shastra The Soft Moon Represents the peace of soul which get offered to a devotee when he/she meets his/her mother.\n\nMukt Keshi (‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ï‡•ç‡§§ ‡§ï‡•á‡§∂‡§ø‡§®‡•Ä) :- She is been called mukt keshi meaning she has long disheveled long hair which means that Mata Mahakali is Devoid of earthly Complexities and emotional ties.\n\nShe has TrinetrƒÅ :- Meaning she has Three eyes . As per Tantra Shastra Her Three Eyes represent , The Sun , The Moon and The Fire, and by these Three Eyes Mata Mahakali can see The Past , The Present and The Future .\n\nShe is Called as ‚ÄúMƒÅhƒÅGhorƒÅ‚Äú(‡§Æ‡§π‡§æ‡§ò‡•ã‡§∞‡§æ) :- Meaning one who has loud fierce voice . As Per Various Tantra Shastra it is Said that The Voice of Mata Mahakali Ends all The Evil of The world or the Evil of the Heart of Her Devotee .\n\nShe is called ‚ÄúBƒÅlƒÅvata·πÉsƒÅ‚Äù (‡§¨‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§µ‡§§‡§Ç‡§∏‡§æ) :- Meaning ‚ÄúMahakali who is wearing the body of dead children in her ears‚Äù . By this The tantra Shastra means that the Body of Child represents a panch bhoot (i.e five elements of life) who are innocent as a child . Mata Mahakali keeps her devotee close to her ears and she listens to all of their requests to the great mother.\n\nFrom Both Sides of her Mouth Blood Drops are Falling :- As per Tantra Shastra , this means the The Great Mother Goddess is devoid of ‚ÄúRajogun ‚Äù and ‚ÄúTamogun‚Äù. She only contain ‚ÄúSatogun‚Äù.\n\nShe is seen Biting her Tongue by her bright shiny teeth :- here as per tantra shastra The Tongue represents the ‚ÄúRajogun‚Äù and ‚ÄúTamogun‚Äù which is stopped by the teeth which represents the ‚ÄúSatogun‚Äù. this is why she is been called as ‚ÄúPraktitardana‚Äù.\n\nShe is Seen always with a Great Smile on her bright radiant face (i.e ‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§§‡§Æ‡•Å‡§ñ‡•Ä):- This is Symbolic of her motherly nature. that is why she is been called as ‚ÄúSimant mukhi‚Äú.\n\nShe has large Breast :- her Breast are symbolic of her motherhood nature. she is the one who can nurture the whole universe .\n\nShe wears Garland of Heads with blood dripping :- Tantra Shastra explains that The Whole creation is Bound to the Shabd Brahma , That is the Ultimate Sound of the Universe. and each heads (total 51) represents a Shabd Brahma , and from the Falling Blood which is the Symbolic of ‚ÄúRajogun‚Äù, Mata Mahakali Creates new Creation . because Blood is the Source of creation by which new life is formed . ( the concept greatly explained in our other tab of this blog)\n\nShe is Called ‚ÄúDigambrƒÅ‚Äù ( ‡§¶‡§ø‡§ó‡§Ç‡§¨‡§∞‡§æ):‚Äì Meaning Devoid of Maya. i.e Their is Nothing in this world which could cover her. she is like the great dark sky of the Universe. and nothing of the universe could ever bound her , except the devotion of her devotees.\n\nShe wears Girdle of Severed Hands of Corpse :- Here First of all many symbolic representation are their, like the hand represents the deeds done by humans . corpse again means ‚ÄúThe Five Elements of Live i.e the panchbhuts‚Äú. The Girdle of Hands tied to her represents that untill and unless the human being are not given salvation by the great mother they are Tied to her by their deeds.\n\nShe wields a Sword in her Left Top Hand (Vaam Hastae Kripaan) :- The Sword here represents the Divine Knowledge by which Mata Mahakali Cuts the ties of Maya . Her Left top hand (i.e She is Called as Vaam Hastae),actually , an another name of Lord shiva is ‚ÄúVaam deva‚Äù, and Maa MahaKali grants Salvation to the ones who follows this path of Lord Shiva.\n\nShe holds a Severed Head in her Left bottom Hand :- By This Tantra Shastra Means that the Head actually represents The Pure Material Knowledge , which is well considered inferior as per the Left hand tradition.\n\nHer Two Right Hands are in Varadh Mudra (mudra of granting boons) and Abhaydaan Mudra (mudra of dispelling fears) :- This actually means that She is balancing the Left Hand Tradition of Selfless and Salvation i.e acts which involve leaving the earthly bonds with the Right Hand Tradition of Wish and Hope of Living with Maya (i.e the earthly bonds) . Just to explain You wont Need Boon unless you have any wish in your Life and You wont need Protection when you are in the course to attain salvation . The Two are anti to each other , and mata Mahakali is the balanced force to mediate in between.\n\nShe is seated in reverse (vipƒÅrita) intercourse with Mahakala :- Tantra Shastra Explains (ref Mahakala Samhita Kamkala Khand) that Mahakaal (meaning The Great Time ) is not a Person but a place which is devoid of time and as Maa MahaKali is above all the Time and Creation She is seated above Mahakala. Now she is Said to give Mahakala the Energy to move , i.e the energy to create and destroy .\n\nShe is Seen always Youthful :- as Per Tantra Shastra her everlasting Youthfulness is a Symbolic of that No Change occours in her . She is everlasting and devoid of any change.\n\nShe is Called ‚ÄúKaral-vadna‚Äù :- This Means the By looking at the Huge body of Maa MahaKali The Evil doers are Terrified and they hide in fear of her.\n\nThe above stated 23 Points gives a brief understanding of how the appearance of Mata Mahakali is been described by various Tantra Shastra which is based on and old tantrik mythological reference like the above described Yogini tantra where Lord Shiva worships the great mother Mahakali who has the above stated appearance. The Concept of her appearance in been explained in various Tantra Shastra by various scholars .\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY FROM YOGINI TANTA ABOUT MATA MAHAKALI & THE DESCRIPTION OF THE ROLES OF THE THREE GODS :-\n\nIN Yogini tantra it is said that Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu were created by mother Mahakali Sweat, while she was dancing with all the yogini‚Äôs and Shivaa Gaana (servants of shakti ‚Äì were called Shivaa Gaana.) Two sweat drops fall from her chin and from these two drops of sweat Bhahma and Vishnu came into existence.\n\nIt is further said that when these two gods were created they have no knowledge of the existence and they started running here and their. Then Shiva Stopped them and gave them divine mantra which he got from mother Kali and the purans and vedas which made them self aware .\n\nThis tantra further says that when lord Vishnu and lord Brahma became self aware they now know who they are and along with lord Shiva they started worshiping Mother Mahakali with tears in their eyes for millions of years. Mother Mahakali was pleased by their prayers Mother Kali Said to Brahma ‚Äì ‚Äú Brahma as you have all the knowledge of shastra and creation so you will become the creator of this universe‚Äù .\n\nthen she turned towards lord vishnu and told him that ‚Äì ‚ÄúVishnu as you are my great devotee who have the knowledge of vedas, you know everything about ‚ÄúGunalaya‚Äù i.e every nature and emotion and you know all about ‚Äúdharma‚Äù so you will control the creation ‚Äú.\n\nthen she turned towards lord Shiva and pleased by her prayers she said ‚Äì ‚ÄúShiva as you are ‚ÄúAgam‚Äù,‚ÄùMahapragya‚Äù,‚ÄùMahayarahit‚Äù,‚ÄùSagun‚Äù, ‚ÄúMahayogi‚Äù ‚Äù So you will be the End of all creation.‚Äù\n\nThe tantra further says that one receiving the statement of Mother goddess Lord Shiva understood his role and started worshiping mother Mahakali and time of five crore years passed after that Mother Maha Kali Asked Lord Shiva ‚Äì‚ÄúO Shiva what do you wish for ? what ever you want I will Give it to you ..‚Äù\n\nOn Hearing Her saying the Lord Shiva Said ‚Äì O Great mother If you are Truly pleased by my prayers So please Give me a Place by the side of your Feet‚Ä¶\n\nThe text gives us a correct understanding of why lord Shiva is Present below the feets of Kali Maa..\n\nThe Tantrik text i.e Yogini tantra and Other tantra like Kali Vilas Tantra and Maha Nirvan Tantra sees mother Maha Kali as the Supreme Mother of all creation and even the Three Gods i.e Brahma Vishnu & Mahesh are seen as her children who are just following her orders.\n\nb.) ‚ÄúMAHAKALI ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúKALIKA PURAN‚Äù\n\nIn kalika puran section ‚ÄúNarad Muni agaman‚Äù we again find a reference describing the grace of Mata Mahakali , where Mata Mahakali is being worshiped by Manika devi who is the wife of King Himwan and listening to her prayers Mata Mahakali graced Manika devi , that mahakali will take birth as her (Manika devi) daughter who is later called as Parvati.\n\nthe section is described in great length in the following subsection of maa parvati , who is by the above quoted reference of kalika Puran is the Avatar of Adishakti Mahakali Mata.\n\nc.) ‚ÄúMAHAKALI ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúNEEL TANTRA‚Äù\n\nin Shaktism and Tantrism Mahakali is always seen as the great mother of Creation and worshiped as a Source of all Creation and power . for ex the bellow passage is a snapshot from the Reference ‚ÄúRenouned Goddess of desire‚Äù by Biernacki Loriliai (Ch ‚Äì The Kali Practice Pg 38 ) lines described from Neel Tantra, and similar to yogani tantra here also .Mother Kali is seen as an ultimate creator the reference passage from great blue tantra tells us that it is Mother MahaKali who provided the dust (present below her feet) as the source of all creation to lord Brahma\n\n(Please note :- that we are researching the original Neel tantra to obtain the correct lines and as soon as we find the real reference material , we will upload the content as well)\n\nd.) ‚ÄúMAHAKALI ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúSHIVA PURAN‚Äù\n\nIn all of the Tantra and Shaktism sect mythology we see Maha Kali as the mother of Three Gods and that she created the universe and allotted the rolls to the three gods . but their is an another reference from Shaivism sect where the mother Great Goddess has appeared ..\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY FROM SHIVA PURAN :-\n\nThe reference is from Shiva Puran .. here in Section ‚ÄúRudra Samhita subsection ‚Äì Sati Khand‚Äù the tale of Maa Sati is being told , here it is been described that after maa sati left the world Lord Shiva got really angry and in anger he broke his one hair lot or Jata (‡§ú‡§ü‡§æ ) and smash a mountain with it .The mountain turned into a rubble of dust and ‚Äúthe Jata broke into Two Parts ‚Äú- .\n\nFROM THE EASTERN PART ‚Äì A GREAT WARRIOR WITH TWO THOUSAND ARMS APPEARED ‚Äì WHO IS KNOW AS ‚ÄúVEER BHADRA‚Äù .\n\nAND FROM THE OTHER PART ‚Äì THE GREAT MOTHER GODDESS MAA MAHAKALI APPEARED IN HER MOST POWERFUL FORM.\n\nThe two most powerful forces then Ended the Yagya of Daksh Prajapati (father of Maa Sati), along with lord shiva .\n\nso this piece of text from Shaivism sect also a give a account of appearance of Maa Mahakali and may be because of this Section an idea came into existence that Mahakali is the Most Destructive form which is popularized by Wikipedia.\n\nhowever the above quoted text is the only paurinik reference which shows terrifying form of mother Mahakali .\n\nSO Both Shaivism Sect & Shaktism Sect give us a remarkable image of Mother Mahakali . and we can conclude by saying as stated below :-\n\nConclusion drawn about Mata Mahakali , from the above Pauranik and Tantrik research:-\n\nAS PER SHAKTISM SECT(BOTH PURANIK (Ref ‚Äì Kalika puran) AND TANTRIK MYTHOLOGY (ref ‚Äì Yogani Tantra , neel tantra, kali tanta ) :- MOTHER MAHA KALI IS THE MOTHER OF ALL UNIVERSE AND CREATOR OF THE THREE GODS . SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND LOVE FOR HER CHILDREN . SHE IS THE SUPREME BEING AND THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF ALL CREATION .. SHE IS THE GREAT CREATOR AND THE MOTHER OF ALL UNIVERSE .\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\nAND SHAIVISM SECT SHOWSTHAT MOTHER MAHAKALI IS THEGREAT WORRIER WHO APPEARED WHEN LORD SHIVA WAS IN TERRIBLE PAIN AND SHE IS THE ULTIMATE POWER AND DESTROYER OF THE EGO (AS SHE ENDED THE EGO OF KING DAKSHA BY DESTROYING HIS YAGYA)‚Ä¶\n\n2nd Avatar.) MOTHER YOGNIDRA\n\n(ALSO KNOWN AS MAHA MAYA or MAHA KALI) :-\n\nThe Creator of Great illusion we call Life..\n\nMata Yognidra is the creator of Maya (the force which drives Life and Death).\n\nWe were able to find that DIFFERENT PAURANIK REFERENCE WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR MOTHER YOGNIDRA HAVE REPEATEDLY REFEREED HER AS MATA MAHAKALI . FIRST:\n\na.) ‚ÄúMATA YOGNIDRA ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúKALIKA PURAN‚Äú\n\nIn Kalika puran we get a detailed information on Mata Yognidra. here their are two subsection One called ‚ÄúKALI STUTI VERNAN ‚Äúand the other continued section Called ‚ÄúYOGNIDRA STUTI‚Äù . (please note that the Hindi Kalika puran is divided into susections but you can easily find the content inside the subsedtion in all versions of kalika puran like sanskrit version , sanskrit to english version).\n\nIn the Section ‚ÄúKali Stuti Vernan‚Äù it is been said by Lord Brahma that :\n\n‚ÄúO Maa you are ‚ÄúHinsa‚Äù and ‚ÄúAhinsa‚Äù you are the great ‚ÄúFour Faces Kali‚Äú,\n\nyou are the mother of the Creation and the Annihilator of all Creation .\n\nYou are the Creation and you are devoid of all creation,\n\nyou are devoid of atoms and still you are the creator ‚Äú\n\nso we clearly see that mata yognidra and Mata MahaKali are the same deity .\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MATA YOGNIDRA (AS PER KALIKA PURAN) :- as per Kalika Puran Section ‚ÄúKali Stuti vernan‚Äù her appearance is described by sant sootji maharaj , while quoting lord Brahma, the following is been stated .\n\nShe has a beautiful appearance .\n\nShe has four arms.\n\nShe is sitting on a Lion.\n\nShe has a Sword and a Blue Lotus.\n\nHer hair is Open.\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY FROM ‚ÄúKALIKA PURAN‚Äù:-\n\nIn continues with the section ‚ÄúKali Stuti Vernan‚Äù the next Section ‚ÄúYognidra Stuti‚Äù accounts for ‚Äì when Lord Brahma got troubled that who has the ability to be the wife of Lord Shiva as he cannot create any divine soul who could be eligible to be the wife of lord shiva , as it was important for the well being of the entire creation. so he went and prayed Mother YOGNIDRA to guide him .\n\nIn repose to his prayers, mother yognidra said the she will take an avtar as the daughter of Daksh Prajapati who will marry lord Shiva .\n\nthe second popular description is from Durga Saptashati , where mata Yognidra is again Described.\n\nb.) ‚ÄúMATA YOGNIDRA ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúSRI DURGA SAPTASHATI‚Äù\n\nIn Ref ‚Äì Sri durga saptashati Section 4 ‚Äì Adhaya- 1 ‚Äú madhu ketab wadh ‚Äù. (Reference dated back to ‚Äì 400-600 CE) we get a detailed account of Mata Adi Shakti ‚Äì Here Refereed to as ‚ÄúYOGNIDRA‚Äù. Here we See Lord Brahma saying That she gave the three gods Life and Power . She is the Ultimate Mother of the Three Gods .\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY FROM ‚ÄúSRI DURGA SAPTASHATI ‚Äú:-\n\nHere the story calls that when lord vishnu was sleeping, two demons came into existence from the ear was of Lord Vishnu ‚Äì they were called ‚Äì Madhu & Khetab .. who immediately went after lord Brahma .. Lord Brahma on Seeing the Demon came running to lord Vishnu and tried to wake him Up so that lord Vishnu could stop the demons from attacking him . But Lord Vishnu was deeply Sleeping in a state of Yoga .. and no matter of what lord Brahma would Do he was not able to wake lord Vishnu .\n\nSo Lord Brahma immediately focused his mind on Adi Bhagwati -Adi Yogmaya (or Mahakali as the description of both the goddesses are identical to be exact) .. who on hearing lord Brahma‚Äôs Prayer came in-front of Lord Brahma . Lord Brahma asked Ada yogmaya to free Lord Vishnu from the Yogic sleep of his and help him to fight the Demons who are attacking him .\n\nMata Yogmaya or Mahakali answered lord Brahma‚Äôs prayer and released lord vishnu from the deep sleep . and waking lord Vishnu started fighting the Two demons but the battle continued for 1000 years . and still the two demons were not loosing . So lord Brahma again asked Mata Mahakali to help lord Vishnu end the Demons .. and hearing his request , Mata Mahakali used her great power Maya and enchanted the two demons .. who started saying ..\n\n‚ÄúO lord Vishnu ask us a wish and you are a great warrior and we are pleased by you ‚Äú.\n\non hearing this statement lord vishnu immediately said\n\n‚ÄúO great demons if you are truely pleased by me ,please Die by my hands ‚Äù .\n\nthe demons enchanted by Maya of Mahakali (or yogmaya) said ,\n\n‚ÄúO lord Vishnu where their is No water we will Die their‚Äù\n\non hearing this. lord Vishnu the Great protector , put both the demons on his thighs and ended the demos by his sudarshan chakra ‚Ä¶\n\nthe reference is important as we see here that all the quotes Describing Mata Yognidra is the Same used for Mother ‚ÄúMahaKali‚Äù in Yogani Tantra and Kalika puran confirms that Yognidra ,MahaMaya & Mahakali are all the same Goddesses.\n\nConclusion drawn from the above Pauranik research:-\n\nSo our findings from both the pauranik reference describing about Mother Yognidra clearly shows that Mahakali Maa and Maa Yognidra are the same Goddess But both played a different roles .\n\nas per many scholar and our research of the ancient text mata Yognidra and Mata mahakali are the same Goddesses but they both are different refereed meaning\n\nwhen we are talking about ‚Äúvashnava‚Äù sect ‚Äì then we are using the name Mata Yognidra .\n\nand when we are talking about ‚ÄúShakta ‚Äúsect ‚Äì then we are using the name Mata MahaKali.\n\npurans like the above mentioned have tried to merge the identities of both the goddesses as One by repeatedly saying that they both are the same Mother Goddesses.\n\n3rd Avatar.) MOTHER TRINATRI KALI\n\n(ALSO KNOWN AS YOGANI DEVI)\n\n:- ‚ÄúTHE SYMBOL OF POWER AND MOTHERLY LOVE .\n\nTHE GREAT GODDESS WHO APPEARED FROM THE THIRD EYE OF LORD SHIVA\n\nThis avatar of Mata Maha Kali is been described in another mythological reference from Shaivism Sect which is famously known as ‚ÄúLING PURAN SECTION ‚Äì SHIVA TANDAVA VERNAN‚Äù .\n\na.) ‚ÄúTRINATRA KALI ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúLING PURAN‚Äù\n\nThis is another avatar who is also known as Kali maa (or yogani devi) . in section ‚ÄúShiva tandava vernan‚Äù of Ling Puran we get an account of the great warrior and primary nature of mata Trinatra Kali as ‚Äì A Mother.\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY FROM LING PURAN :-\n\nHere the describer of the incident is ‚ÄúMuni Sootji maharaj‚Äù who told that :-\n\nOnce upon a time their was a asur named Daruk. The Asur was so powerful and evil . most of the gods like Eshan , Yama , Indra and others when got really troubled by the demon (asur) went to lord Vishnu and asked his help to defeat the great demon . lord Vishnu rallied an army and tried to fight the great demon but due to a boon of the great asur , ‚Äúno God could defeat him in battle‚Äù . all the gods tried to fight the battle by summoning themselves into a female form but was still could not defeat the great demon Daruk.\n\nOn Loosing the battle the Gods and lord Vishnu went to Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati for Help . They Worshiped them and said\n\n‚ÄúGods ‚Äì O lord Shiva, Please protect us from this demon Daruk who could only be stopped by a great Goddess‚Äù .\n\nListing to their Prayers Lord Shiva and Maa Parvati Smiled and then Lord Shiva said to mother Parvati\n\n‚ÄúO kalayani (the goddess who bless the universe) please i request you to end this demon Daruk how can only be ended by a Great Goddess .‚Äù\n\nListening to Lord Shiva a Spiritual divine Part (‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§∂) of Maa Parvati emerged and entered into lord Shiva . That spiritual part got mixed with the ‚ÄúKaral Vish ‚Äù (great poison) present in Bhagwan Shiva‚Äôs Throat and The great Warrior Goddess (who is called as Kali or Yogani Devi) emerged from the third Eye of Lord Shiva..\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MAA TRI-NATRA KALI (AS PER LING PURAN) :- This Great Goddess who has appeared in front of Lord Shiva and Mother Parvati Looked really destructive and her appearance is as follows\n\nShe has a Dark Skin\n\ntheir is a sign of ‚ÄúKARAL VISH‚Äù on her neck.\n\nShe has Three Eyes on her forehead just like lord Shiva. (Note ‚Äì THIS AVATAR IS NOT DESCRIBED WITH A LOLLING TONGUE A APPEARANCE FEATURE OF PAURANIK MAA KALI)\n\nShe wears as Moon like a crown. (moon is always represented as a crown with shiva and it is never represented as a crown with (Pauranik) Maa Kali\n\nShe wields a ‚ÄúTRIDENT‚Äù is in her hand instead (not ‚ÄúSHACKLE‚Äù like weapon).\n\nShe is also wearing a Divine dress (or ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞)\n\nAnd she is dressed with jewelry of different kind\n\nThen By The Orders Of Maa Parvati, Maa Kali Ended the Great Demon ‚ÄìDARUK.\n\nBut she was so angry on the demon that the whole world started fearing her rage .\n\nGods then Came to Lord Shiva and asked Him to calm Kali maa Down as no one could\n\ndare to approach her . So to calm her rage down Shiva Took a Avtar of an ‚ÄúInfant child‚Äù or ‚ÄúBAAL AVTAR‚Äù and lied in the ‚Äúshamshan‚Äù and started crying . as soon as ‚ÄúMaa Kali heard the cry of a innocent baby she immediately stopped hunting demons and started looking for the crying child, and when she found the child, she took the child in her own hand and nurtured the child out of motherly love.\n\n[This section of ling puran (dedicated to Bhagwan Shiva) also holds importance for shiva did the famous Natraj dance.] IN Here ‚ÄúLing puran Section ‚ÄúShiva Tandava Vernan‚Äù this Kali avatar was further named as ‚ÄúYogani‚Äù by the gods after they worshiped her and Maa Parvati together..\n\nThe Story clearly gives the description that ‚ÄúMaa Kali ‚Äù the mother ; Even her rage was feared by all but ‚ÄúShe is just a mother‚Äù we know we can see Puran stating that the word feared and felt the fire of her rage but puran also describes that she was easily cooled down by a crying baby. She felt and cared more about a crying helpless baby than about the rage and destruction.\n\n‚ÄúMaa Tara save‚Äôs Lord Shiva from the Halahala vish‚Äù\n\n(A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT CONCEPT ‚Äì DON‚ÄôT MIX IT‚Ä¶.)\n\nWell an Interesting Similar concept is also found and a similar incident nurturing Lord\n\nShiva by Maa Tara is also know among the famous know saying (we think that it is just a saying as we were not able to find any real pauranik or tantrik reference as was claimed to us) .\n\nTHE COMMON MYTHOLOGICAL SAYING :- The story that is depicted by the below image is the legend that when during the samudra manthan, first came the ‚Äúhalahal‚Äù vish . the vish has the capacity to end all life and creation , so all the chief gods went to lord shiva and asked him to contain the great sea of poison. Lord Shiva drank ‚Äòhalahala‚Äô, but he was writhing in pain, seeing this the adishakti appeared in an avatar most commonly knows as Maa Tara and fed Lord Shiva Her own breast milk. Lord Shiva recovered after this.\n\nOUR FINDINGS :-\n\nOur Initial Finding suggests that this incident is not found in any ancient pauranik or tantrik scripture so far as we know. But the incident is been described in many books, the most famous being ‚ÄòMahapith Tarapith, Bipul kumar Gangopadhyay, Jay Tara Publishers, Vol 1.\n\nthe other famous Reference is of Pramod Kumar Chattopadhyay, who wrote it in the second volume of ‚ÄòTantraavilashir Sadhusanga‚Äò quoting Sri Sri Bamakhepa, the famous saint of Tarapith :-\n\nThat Primal Goddess Who gives birth of a child in form of human mother, appears in his life later as wife. Prakriti thus goes on serving Purusha in every possible way.\n\nTHE COMMON MYTHOLOGICAL EXCEPTION :-\n\nApart from the fact that their is also another story where it is told that lord shiva didnt drank all the halahal vish (poison) , he actually contained it in his neck . and thats what turned his neck blue . because of this he is called as ‚ÄúNeelkanth‚Äù literally meaning The Blue Throated One.\n\nHow ever we are not questioning the authentication of the incident as we havent researched that deep And their are multiple sides of a single incident, that‚Äôs what our blog is all about .\n\nbut we can see a clear difference in both the incidents , and may be the incident look alike and many Buddhist believe that both are the same incidents , but however similar they may seem they are entirely different.\n\n1.) In ling puran it is clearly stated that Lord Shiva took an Infant avatar and started crying as a hungry child would do, who was nurtured by Maa Kali, and by this act she showed that she is the symbol of Motherhood.\n\nHowever Maa Tara fed Adult Shiva to reduce the effects of ‚ÄúHalahal‚Äù vish or ‚ÄúKaalkoot Vish‚Äù or ‚ÄúKaral Vish‚Äù.\n\n2.) In Ling Puran the Primary Nature of Maa Kali is been clearly shown, which is Motherhood and ‚ÄúNot‚Äù Violence . but the Concept related to Maa Tara is Entirely Different, as it is focused upon an incident when lord shiva felt intense pain and to cure him Maa Tara came.\n\n3.) Moreover Ling Puran says that a divine part of Mother parvati entered in lord shiva and got mixed with the ‚ÄúKaral Vish‚Äù which is present in the Neck of Lord Shiva and avatar appeared out of the third eye of Lord Shiva.\n\n(It is to be noted that, it is not clearly mentioned that the Karal Visha or the KaalKoot Vish and The Halahal Vish are the same or different. If they all are the same than the Ling Puran place the incident of avatar of Tri-Natra Kali Maa and her battle with the demon king Daruk, after The Samudra Manthan Incident as maa trinatra kali existed from the poison already present in the neck of Lord Shiva)\n\nHowever the origin of Maa Tara is clearly seen as the avatar of Maa Adishakti . and if we believe the above mentioned Tantra and Purans than the Great Asishakti is also called as ‚ÄúMata MahaKali.‚Äù\n\n4.) MATA BIPRA ‚Äì KUMARI KALIKA\n\n:- HERE LIES THE ANSWER OF WHY KUMARI POOJA IS BEEN DONE\n\nTHIS IS A BRAHMAN CHILD INCARNATION WHO ENDED KOLASUR , A DEMON WHO WAS BORN FROM LORD VISHNU‚ÄôS HEART AND WAS SO POWERFUL THAT HE CONTROLLED ENTIRE CREATION.\n\nTHEN AS PER YOGANI TANTRA MOTHER MAHAKALI TOOK THE AVATAR OF A BRAHMAN CHILD AND ENDED DEMON KOLASUR ..\n\nTHIS BEGAN THE TRADITION OF ‚ÄúKUMARI POOJA‚Äù\n\na.) ‚ÄúBIPRA ‚Äì KUMARI KALI ‚Äú\n\nFrom Reference :-\n\n‚ÄúYOGANI TANTRA‚Äù\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY FROM YOGANI TANTRA :-\n\nFirst Kumari Pooja Was Done By Lord Brahma & Vishnu. They Worshiped Mother Mahakali (The Original Entity Who Created The Three Gods ) So That Demon Named Kolasur Who Ripped Both The Gods From Their Homes Could Be Ended ..\n\nMahakali Then Took The Avatar Or Incarnation Of A Small Brahman Female Child. And Went To The Demons Kingdom . On Encountering The Demon , She Asked The Demon That She Has No Parents , Could He Offer Her Something . Charmed By The Maya Of Mahakali . He Told The Goddess Child That She Can Have Whatever She Wants . So In That Second, Demon Was Ended Like Their Was Nothing Present And So Did His Kingdom Like A Void Or A Zero .\n\nGods Worshiped The Child Goddess , And Lord Brahma & Vishnu Returned To Their Role ‚Ä¶ Since Then Kumari Pooja Is Done .\n\nAbout Kumari pooja :-\n\nWorship of the Almighty as Divine Mother is an age-old tradition in India and a refined part of Indian culture. According to Yogini Tantra by Biswanarayan Shastri ‚Äúkumari pooja‚Äù was originated in the city of Kanci in South India . From Here it migrated to Kampilya and other Places .\n\nWorship of the divine mother has been Worship of the divine mother in existence since prehistoric times, but geographically it is limited to Asian countries in general and India in particular, in the current century. The history of ancient civilizations of Indus, Greece, Rome, Babylon and Egypt bears evidences to the worship of Divine Mother in different forms ‚Äì nature, art, learning, culture and enlightenment. But Mother Worship has evolved from a tradition into a living religion for Indians. In India, it has reached the highest level of devotion and faith in feminine manifestation of the Divine.\n\nIn Bengal, Durga Puja or worship of Goddess Durga, an incarnation of Shakti, is the most pious and popular form of Mother Worship. In the Bengali community, the elderly people address young girls as Ma out of affection. ‚ÄúTo look upon God as Mother is the purest and the highest form of Sadhana,‚Äù said Sri Ramakrishna, who is believed to have worshiped his wife as Divine Mother. Mother is all-in-all for a child.\n\nKumari Puja, a special attraction of Durga Puja festival in Bengal, is held to celebrate this faith through ceremonious worship of young girls in sense of Divine Mother. Kumari Puja is called Kanya Pujan in North India. Bengal celebrates it on Maha Ashtami, the eighth day of Durga Puja, while it is held on the ninth day or the last day of Navaratri in other states of India. The place to be for Kumari Puja in Bengal is Belur Math, the headquarters of Ramakrishna Mission ashrams across the globe.\n\nKumari Puja is held wherever Ramakrishna Math & Mission is in the world. But, it is a cultural refinement, grand ceremony and spectacular ritual at Belur Math on the Hooghly River flowing between Howrah and Kolkata. Swami Vivekananda, the founder of Belur Math, had initiated Kumari Puja in appreciation of Sri Ramakrishna‚Äôs devotion to Divine Mother and faith in Mother Worship.\n\nThe saffron-clad monks of the Ramakrishna Order at Belur Math look upon a young girl as mother and worship her as a goddess, on Maha Ashtami. According to Sri Ramakrishna, little girls at the tender age when they are away from negative forces of the materialistic world are manifestations of the Divine Mother.\n\nThe rituals are performed to worship the Kumari (young unmarried girl) and the offerings are made to her as those during the worship of Goddess adishakti Bhagwati mata. A spectacular arati is performed. Monks and devotees offer flowers at her obedience.\n\nImportance of Kumari pooja :\n\nIn Yogani Tantra It Is Said That Any Child Is The Avatar Of Goddess Mahakali . So If We Offer Her Food And Worship her Our Sins Will Be Forgiven.\n\nAnd Their Is No Cast Of A Child She Is Just Seen As A Goddess. and who ever worship her is awarded all what he wants . People Have Forgotten This Respected Mythological Event But Still Practice The Tradition Known As ‚ÄúKumari Pooja‚Äù.\n\n5th Avatar.)

They went to fight her along with all their demon army .\n\non reaching to lord kailash where the great mother goddess was residing on a lion.\n\nThe great Goddess when saw such huge army of demons approaching , she got furious .\n\nand in anger her face turned black and her eyebrows got shrunken and immediately from those eyebrows Maa Kali came into existence .\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MAA PAURANIK KALI (AS PER DEVI MAHATAMYAM) :-\n\nshe was welding ‚Äúa sword‚Äù and ‚Äúa rope‚Äù. she also holds ‚Äì ‚ÄúA Khatang‚Äù (a mace like weapon).\n\nshe was wearing a sari of cheeta‚Äôs skin\n\nand a garlands of human heads.\n\nher body skin looked compleatly dried .\n\nonly bones were visible.\n\nher mouth was really large\n\nand had a looling tongue.\n\nher eyes looked sunken and red\n\nand her voice sounded like a terrible roar, hearing which many demons died instantly\n\nshe looked totally terrifying.\n\nas soon as Maa Kali came into existence , she started ending demons. she destroyed the entire army and eat most of the demons weapons and destroyed many of them.\n\non seeing this the demon commander Chand rises and starting fighting the great mother kali. He fired many arrows at once but all arrows were cancelled by maa kali‚Äôs chakra.\n\nThe great goddess then laughed loudly . then the great goddess lifted a long sword and loudly said ‚Äù ‡§π‡§Ç ‚Äù and cut the head of the demon general by holding his head by his hair‚Äôs .\n\nOn seeing the death of Chand , his demon brother Mund ran towards the great mother Kali. But the great Goddess Maa Kali, strike the demon down to death by her sword.\n\non Seeing the death of both of the generals , the demon army started running away.\n\nMaa Kali took both the demons head in her hands and went to Maa Ambika (here called as chandika) with a terrible laughter.\n\nThen Maa kali Said:-\n\n‚Äù O devi , I am presenting you these two terible animals called Chand- Mund, now end demon shumbh and nishumbh in this Great War‚Äù\n\nOn hearing this Maa Chandika replied:\n\n‚ÄúO devi | you will be named Chamunda by the world as you have brought these two demon‚Äôs to me‚Äù\n\nthe section Seven of devi mahatmya ended here.\n\n[Note :- Chamunda devi Temple at Kangra District , Himachal Pradesh is said to be the place where Maa Chamunda first appeared to fight demon called Chand & Mund .\n\nMany scholars like Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar says that Goddess Chamunda was originally an indigenous goddess worshiped by the Munda peoples of the Vindhya range of central India. These people worshiped her as per tantrik rituals . ]\n\nIn the next section, i.e section 8 entitled ‚ÄúRaktbeej wadh‚Äù. Maa Kali (with same appearance came into existence )\n\nOn seeing the loss of demon army , the demon King Shumbh ordered his complete army to launch an attack on Maa Ambika..\n\nThe demon King Said :\n\nAll 86 demon army Generals collectively knows as ‚Äúudayadh‚Äù (‡§â‡§¶‡§æ‡§Ø‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß) march into the battle.\n\nAll 84 Demon army Generals belonging to the catougry ‚ÄúKambu‚Äù (‡§ï‡§Æ‡•ç‡§¨‡•Ç) should join the battle this instant .\n\n50 demons from ‚ÄúKotiverya‚Äù Kul\n\n100 demons from ‚ÄúGrom‚Äù kul all should join the battle.\n\non hearing the order from their demon king shumbh all these mounted onto the battle.\n\nSeeing such a huge army approaching Mata Ambika used her bow to rise a loud sound, and her lion started roaring loudly , the sound was further increased by a great ghanta.\n\nOn hearing the loud sound Maa Kali also increase her mouth size. meanwhile all the demon army started gathering around both the great goddesses. but for the good of the innocents and the end of evil the shakti of many gods i.e brahma, shiva, kartekaya,vishnu, indra and shakties of other gods entered the battlefield .\n\nFirst of all came goddess brahmani , the shakti of lord brahma. she was riding on a swan with ‚Äúkamandal‚Äù in her hands.\n\nSecond came the shakti of Lord Shiva, riding a bul , wearing a snake garland and a crown of moon on her head , she was wealding a trishul, in her hands.\n\nThird came the shakti of Lord Kartikaya , riding a peacock and wealding a shakti in her hands.\n\nsimilarly the shakti of Lord Vishnu came to fight the great battle while riding a vulture. she is seen weilding a shankh, chakra , gadha, dhanush and a khand.\n\neven the goddess varahahi was also their , who is the shakti of lord varaha (the avatar of lord Vishnu)\n\nthe goddess narshinghi also came , who is the shakti of lord narshingh (the other avatar of lord Vishnu)\n\nThe shakti of Indra also joined the great battle while riding the great elephant airawat, and she welded a wajra,in her hands.\n\nall the goddess looked similar to the gods they came from.\n\nthen lord shiva asked the great goddess to end all the demons. on hearing this a powerfull form appeared out of ambika ,( the puran call her ‚Äúugra-chandika‚Äù ). but goddess ambika asked lord shiva to go to the demon king shumbh and nishumbh as her messenger .and tell them to return back to patal and leave the world and parts of yagya , otherwise all will meet their doom. (because lord shiva himself weant as her messenger ‚Äì the goddess was also given the name ‚Äúshiva-dutie‚Äù).\n\nbut on hearing these words from lord shiva the demon king got enraged and rushed towards the great mother goddess. the great demon started fighting the mother goddess with all the weapons in his hand. but all the weapons were cancelled by the great goddess by just a sound of her bow like it was a child‚Äôs play.\n\nMother Kali also fought fiercely with her trishul . and destroyed most of the demon army.\n\nGoddessed brahmani was also destroying the demon army , as the water in her kamandal destroyed the demons tej and prakaram . and other shakties were also fighting the great battle and a lot of demon army was destroyed in just few seconds.\n\nSeeing such destruction the Demon Army Started Fleeing From The Battle Field .\n\nSeeing This, A Great Demon (Or Maha-Datya) Named ‚ÄúRaktbeej‚Äù Came Forward To Fight The Battle , He Was Given A Boon By Lord Shiva That If A Drop Of Blood Falls On The Ground It Will Produce A Similar Powerful Demon Like Raktbeej . And This Was An Amazing Gift In The Times Of War As When The Battle Started\n\nFirst Goddess To Attack Raktbeej Was Goddess ‚ÄúIandri‚Äù (The Shakti Of Lord Indra) ‚Äù . She Hit The Demon With Her Ultimate Weapon ‚ÄúWazra‚Äù. As A Result Demon Raktbeej Was Wounded Severely & A Lot Of Blood Of Raktbeej Started Falling . As The Blood Of Raktbeej Touched The Ground A Army Of Many Demons Appeared From The Blood , And All Were Similar In Fighting Skills As Was Raktbeej . She Again Hit Raktbeej On His Head And A Lot Of Blood Started Falling Out Of His Head And Like Earlier , A Million Demon Appeared From That Blood .\n\nSecond Was Goddess ‚ÄúVashnavi‚Äù (The Shakti Of Lord Vishnu) , Who Attacked Demon Raktbeej With Her ‚ÄúChakra‚Äù , And Accompanying Her Goddess Iandri Also Used Her ‚ÄúGadha‚Äù To Attack The Great Demon. The Result Was The Same Billions-Trillions Of Demons Appeared From That Blood And All Started Fighting The Great War .\n\nThen Three Goddess , Goddess ‚ÄúKaaumari‚Äù (Attacked By Her ‚ÄúShakti‚Äù (Lightning))\n\nGoddess ‚ÄúVarahai‚Äù(The Shakti Of Lord Varaha) (Attacked By Her Sword)\n\n& Goddess ‚ÄúMaheshwari‚Äù (The Shakti Of Lord Mahesh) (Attacked By Her Trishul (Trident))\n\nAnd Wounded Raktbeej More Severely. But The End Result Was The Same .. Multi Trillions Demons Appeared From His Blood And All Started Fighting The Great War.\n\nSeeing This ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs Got Afraid & Started Losing Hope‚Äù . Seeing This Goddess ‚ÄúChandika Maa‚Äù (Durga Maa) Asked Goddess Kali (Or Chamunda Maa) .\n\n‚ÄúO Devi Chamundae (One Who Ended Demon Chand-Mund) , Open And Extend Your Mouth And Whoever Demons Formed From Blood Of Demon Raktbeej Eat Them With That Rash Mouth Of Yours .\n\nEat All Those Demons Who Are Appearing From The Blood Of Raktbeej And Roam Freely While Doing The Same.\n\nBy Doing This, When All The Blood Of The Demon Raktbeej Ends Up He Will Die By Itself\n\nOnce You Have Eaten All Those Demons , No New Demons Will Appear ‚Äú\n\nWhile Saying This To Goddess Kali , Goddess Chandika Attacked Demon Raktbeeh By Her Trishul And Then Goddess Kali Contained All The Blood Falling From The Demon.\n\nThe Demon Raktbeej Infuriated With Anger Attacked With ‚ÄúGadha‚Äù In Return. But It Could Not Harm The Mother Goddess . A Lot Of Blood Was Falling From The Body Of Raktbeej But Now All The Blood Was Contained By Goddess Kalika (Chamunda) . Goddess Further Ate All The Demons Who Appeared From The Blood Which Fall On The Ground Than She Drank All The Blood Of Raktbeej Too Then Goddess Chandika Attacked The Demon Blood Less Body By Various Weapons Like ‚ÄúVazra, Chakra, Arrows And Sword‚Äù. And The Demon Died Due To Loss Of Blood And By The Attack Of These Terrible Weapons.\n\nthis is the end of section 8 , giving the complete account of Maa Pauranik or Adh -Kali\n\nIMPORTANT FACTS:-\n\nNOTE :- we have used the name ‚ÄúPauranik‚Äù kali from Kalika Puran and ‚ÄúAdh-Kali‚Äù from kali tantra.\n\nwell it is to be clearly noted that both the text have repeteadly stated that this avatar is entirly different from Maa Kali which we all see and know .\n\nCONCLUSION DRAWN FROM STUDING DURGA SHAPSHATI AND KALIKA PURAN AND KALI TANTRA\n\nMaha Kali is the Mother of all Universe but Pauranik kali is the goddess of Tamoguna.\n\nfollowing are the clips of the reference which clearly tells us , that may be this avatar of maa kali is one of the most popular one‚Äôs but this is just one of the avatars of mata mahakali.\n\nThe Famous Mantra of Maa Chamundae Kali is as follows :-\n\n6th Avatar.) MAA BHADRA KALI\n\n(THE DAUGHTER OF LORD SHIVA, THE GODDESS OF SALVATION, THE GENERAL OF THE ARMY OF LORD SHIVA)\n\nShe is one of the fierce forms of the Great Mother Goddess ‚ÄúMata MahaKali‚Äù who is worshipped as the great mother, protector and Warrior who fought . Their are Three Main Pauranik Mythological References which Gives us all the information about her fierce form and about her greatness.\n\nThe First reference in a Pauranik Reference Known as ‚ÄúKalika Puran‚Äù section called ‚ÄúSection ‚Äì Mahishasura Upakhyan‚Äù .\n\nA.) As Per Kalika Puran\n\nMaa BhadraKali is described as a Great Worrier but also a Really Kind Mother who is seen as the Mother of salvation by the Great Demon Names Mahisasur.\n\nMAHISASUR THE GREAT DEMON KING SAW A DREAM ONCE THAT HE DIED BY THE HANDS OF MOTHER KALI. SO HE STOOD UP KNOWING IT IS A SIGN AND HE STARTED WORSHIPING MOTHER BHADRAKALI . PLEASED BY HIS PRAYERS MOTHER BHADRAKALI APPEARED.\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MAA BHADRA KALI (AS PER KALIKA PURAN) :-\n\nShe is found seated in the north west grounds of the ‚ÄúSheer Sagar‚Äù.\n\nHer Skin Tone is of the Colour of Alsi flower (Flax Blossom Flower).\n\nHer Ears Kundal are pure Gold and shines brightly with a holy glow.\n\nshe wears a Three notched golden crown with a half moon on it .\n\nshe has a hair lot just like lord Shiva.\n\nShe wears the Garland of Snakes and many Golden Necklaces are resent in her neck.\n\nShe Sits on the Back of a Lion .\n\nIn Total Maa Bhadrakali has 16 (Sixteen) Arms\n\nIn her Right Eight Hands she wields many weapons like Shool, Chakra ,Khand, Shankh, Baan (Arrow), Shakti (Thunder Bolt) And Vazradand.\n\nAnd In her Left Eight Hands She Wields many weapons like Kheatak , Charm, Chaap, Pash (Rope), Ankush , Ghanta (Bell), Parshu & Mugdal (mace).\n\nShe Has Three flaming Eyes Just Like Lord Shiva.\n\nShe Stands on Top of the Dead Body of Demon Mahishasur with the thumb of her Left foot on the Demon Beheaded Body.\n\nShe Has a Motherly Glow and A Divya Smile on her Face . (Note: However In Kalika puran She is not characterized by Lolling tongue and garland of heads )\n\nTHE GODDESS APPEARED IN THE ABOVE STATED SIXTEEN ARMED FORM INFRONT OF THE DEMON MAHISHASUR . ON SEEING THE UNIVERSAL MOTHER MAHISHASUR GREETED HER AND WORSHIPED HER WITH UTMOST DEVOTION. AND THEN HE SAID ‚Äì THAT HE KNOWS HE WILL CERTAINLY DIE BY HER HANDS AND HE HAS NO COMPLAINTS ABOUT THIS , HE IS SATISFIED AS HE HAVE ACHIEVED THE POSITION OF LORD INDRA.\n\nHE FURTHER SAID THAT HIS DEATH IS INEVITABLE AS IS A RESULT OF ‚ÄúA CURSE‚Äù OF RISHI KATYAYAN. WHICH THE GREAT SAINT (RISHI) GAVE TO MAHISHASUR AS HE DISTURBED A STUDENT OF RISHI KATYAYAN. THE NAME OF THE STUDENT WAS ‚ÄúRODRASHAVA‚Äù. MAHISHASUR DISTURBED HIS ‚ÄúTAAP SADHNA‚Äù BY ACQUIRING A FEMALE FORM .\n\nSO HIS CURSE WAS THAT AS HE USED A FEMALE APPEARANCE TO DISTURB THE SAGE STUDENT, HE (THE DEMON MAHISHASUR) WILL DIE BY THE HANDS OF A FEMALE. AFTER TELLING HIS STORY HE STARTED WORSHIPPING THE GREAT MOTHER MAA BHADRA KALI AGAIN.\n\nMOTHER BHADRAKALI WAS PLEASE BY HIS WORSHIP MOTHER BHADRAKALI ASKED HIM OF WHAT HE WANTS .\n\nTO WHICH MAHISHASUR SAID ‚Äì ‚ÄúO MOTHER IF YOU ARE REALLY PLEASED WITH MY PRAYERS , PLEASE GIVE ME TWO BOON :-\n\n1.) I WANT THE PART OF YAGYA POOJA &\n\n2.) TILL THE TIME SURYA DEVA EXIST I WANT A POSITION BY THE SIDE OF YOUR FEET . I DON‚ÄôT WANT TO LEAVE THE SERVICE OF YOUR FEET.\n\nIF YOUR ARE PLEASED WITH ME PLEASE AWARD ME THESE TWO BLESSINGS.\n\nOn hearing his request Mother Bhadrakali Said :\n\nO DEMON LISTEN TO MY WORDS . AS ALL THE PARTS OF YAGYA IS ALREADY GIVEN TO THE GODS , I CANNOT GIVE YOU ANY PART OF THE YAGYA RIGHT NOW , BUT WHEN YOU DIE BY MY HANDS YOU WILL NEVER LEAVE THE SIDE OF MY FEET . AND YOUR BODY WILL GET THE PART OF POOJA BY THE TOUCH OF MY FEET. (THIS MEANS THE GREAT MOTHER PROMISED A PART OF HER SHARE OF THE POOJA TO HIM)\n\nOn hearing the words of the ‚ÄúGoddess Mahishasur‚Äù felt proud as the morning came.\n\nMAHISHASUR FURTHER SAID : ‚ÄúO UGRACHANDA, O BHADRAKALI, O DURGA, O DEVI‚Äù, I BOW TO YOU. Then He asked ‚ÄúO MOTHER IN WHAT FORM OF YOURS I WILL BE REMEMBERED BELOW YOUR FEET‚Äù.\n\nTO WHICH BHADRAKALI STATED : ‚ÄúO DEMON THE FORM YOU JUST MENTIONED, WITH ALL THAT FORM YOU WILL ALWAYS BE WORSHIPPED BELOW MY FEET ‚Äú.\n\nSHE FUTHER TOLD MAHISHASUR THAT IN HIS FIRST BIRTH (WHEN HE WAS REALLY CURSED) HE DIED BY THE HANDS OF ‚ÄúMAA UGRACHANDA‚Äù , IN HIS SECOND AND PREVIOUS BIRTH HE DIED BY HER HANDS AS ‚ÄúBHADRAKALI‚Äù AND IN HIS CURRENT BIRTH (THIRD BIRTH) HE WILL DIE BY THE HANDS OF HER INCARNATION MAA DURGA.\n\nAFTER THAT SHE SHOWED HOW THE MAHISHASUR WAS PREVIOUSLY ENDED BY HER AND HER UGRACHANDA FORM. SEEING HIS ENDING FROM PREVIOUS TWO BIRTH WHERE HIS BODY WAS BE-HEADED PRESENT BELOW HER FEET AND HEAD PRESENT IN HER HANDS .\n\nMAHASHASUR GOT SACRED BY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SAME WILL BE GOING TO HAPPEN SOON. BUT SUDDENLY HE REALISED THAT THE GREAT MOTHER OF SALVATION IS STANDING RIGHT BEFORE HIM. SO HE AGAIN STARTED WORSHIPPING HER AND THEN HE SAID ‚Äì\n\n‚ÄúO MOTHER IF YOU ARE REALLY HAPPY WITH ME AND YOU ARE TO SHARE YOUR YAGYA PART WITH ME. THEN PLEASE GRANT ME SALVATION . I DON‚ÄôT WANT TO TAKE ANY REBIRTH AND PLEASE DONT BE-HEAD ME THIS TIME‚Äù‚Äù\n\nand Mother Bhadrakali Granted His wish of Salvation ..\n\nIMPORTANT FACTS:-\n\nNOTE :- MAA BHADRA KALI IS SEEN AS THE GREAT FIERCE WORRIER WHO HAD ENDED DEMON MAHISHASUR TWO TIMES IN TWO OF HIS PREVIOUS BIRTHS BUT STILL HE WORSHIPS HER BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT SHE IS REALLY KIND AND GENTLE MOTHER AND IT IS HIS OWN PAST DEADS BECAUSE OF WHICH HE IS GETTING PUNISHED. AND HE SEES HER AS THE GREAT MOTHER OF SALVATION.\n\nCONCLUSION DRAWN FROM STUDYING KALIKA PURAN\n\nMATA BHADRAKALI IS SEEN AS THE GREAT WORRIER AND ALSO AS THE KIND MOTHER OF SALVATION.\n\nThe Second pauranik reference which describes mother BhadraKali is Shiva puran Section Rudra-kahand .\n\nB.) As Per Shiva Puran\n\n(Section ‚Äì Rudra Samhita ‚ÄúYuddh Khand‚Äú)\n\nMaa BhadraKali is described as a Great Worrier and a General of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Army\n\nThis Section describes a battle of Demon ‚ÄúShankh- Chur‚Äù and Lord Shiva ..\n\nHe also joined the Battle against the Asur Army from the side of Lord Shiva and Kumar Skandh (Kartikeya) to subdue the demon and his army ..\n\nThe Sub section is entitled ‚Äì ‚ÄúKali aur shankhchur ka divya astro sa yudh‚Äú\n\nThis Subsection of Shiva Puran Says :-\n\n‚Äù When Kali maa Entered the Battle. Her voice and gimps filled the hearts of demon army with fear. many demon soldiers lost their fighting spirit and started running away from the battle field .seeing this Demon King ‚ÄúShankh-Chur‚Äù came forward and started supporting his army , and took the battle field control in his own hands ..‚Äù\n\nfirst Kali maa fired a ‚Äúagani astra‚Äù which Shankh -chur cancelled with his own ‚Äúvashana-astra‚Äù\n\nThen she fired a ‚Äúnirani- astra‚Äù which shankh-chur dogged .\n\nThen she again fired ‚Äúbramha-astra‚Äù which shanks-chur again dogged.\n\nAfter this the Demon himself attacked mother Kali by several ‚Äúabahamantrit‚Äù arrow‚Äôs then Kali maa opened her mouth and swallowed all those weapons in an instant and then she laughed loudly which put all the demon army to fear her.\n\nThen the demon Shankh attacked with a great weapon which was ‚Äúhundred Yogan ‚Äù in length , but was easily cancelled by the mother goddess.\n\nThen the demon fired ‚Äúvashnava astra‚Äù which was cancelled by ‚Äúmaheshava- astra‚Äù\n\nall the gods started to watch the battle\n\nafter this the Great goddess got really angry and she purified her ‚Äúpashupat-astra‚Äù by mantra . but as she was to fire this weapon , an ‚Äúakashwani‚Äù (voice of god) happened which said ‚Äì\n\n‚ÄúO devi , please dont use this terrible weapon. this is easily an ultimate weapon but this demon will not die by the use of this weapon ,so find an another way to end this demon.‚Äù\n\nListening to the akashwani Kali Maa didn‚Äôt fired the great and ultimate weapon but she ate hundred lakhs demon soldiers is just an instant\n\nafter this she started approaching Demon Shankh to end him but she was stopped by ‚ÄúRodra-astra‚Äù\n\nThen the Demon Shankh used ‚Äúsurya-khag astra‚Äù and fired it towards the goddess.\n\nKali Maa swallowed this weapon too.\n\nLike this She cancelled multiple weapons of demon Shankh.\n\nand She came forward to eat him alive but , the demon by using ‚Äúmaya‚Äù disappeared .\n\nWhen the Great Goddess didnt find the Demon on his ‚ÄúRath‚Äù (chariot). She punched the ‚ÄúRath‚Äù and ended the demon chariot‚Äôer and the chariot..\n\nThen the demon reappeared and he fired a ‚ÄúChakra‚Äù which The great goddess handled with just her left hand and swallowed it too.\n\nthen the great goddess in great anger punched The demon ‚ÄúShankh‚Äù and he became unconscious .\n\nafter Regaining Consciousness , he stood us but seeing the great goddess as his mother he did not try to fight her with bare hands.\n\nBut the great goddess was angry at him she caught hold of him and swinged him in sky . the demon fall back to the ground\n\nThe demon then did ‚Äúnamaskar‚Äù to the great goddess seeing her as the great mother , and he stood on his new chariot and started to fight the army of devas.\n\none the other hand goddess Kali was also ending the demon army , then suddenly and another Akashwani happened :\n\n‚ÄúO devi chandika, in this battle field another one lakh demon are still present. these demons are terrible, so please end them and drink all their blood , O devi, please stop fighting Shankh-chur as you are not the one who will end this demon, ‚Äú\n\nListening to the akashwani she left the demon-king Shankh-chur and eat and drink all the blood of the remaining demon and returned to lord shiva ‚Ä¶\n\nlater the demon Shankh-chur was ended by Lord Shiva himself.. However the Section accounts for a different version of Maa Bhadrakali\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MAA BHADRA KALI (AS PER SHIVA PURAN) :-\n\nThis form of Maa BhadraKali is Seen with 100 (Hundred) Arms.\n\nShe is Riding a Chariot in which Bright Shining Gems are attached .\n\nOn Her Whole Body a Red Chandan paste is present , because of which she is appearing red.\n\nShe is Happy and She Dances while her devotees Sings Song.\n\nShe has a Long Lolling Tongue which lengths to 100 Yojan.\n\nShe Welds Many Great weapons listed as ‚Äì Shankh , Chakra, Gada, padr, Dhal, Talwaar, dhaunash , Baan, A Khaar with a diameter of 1 yojan , a Trishul which touches Sky, a Shakti which lengths 1 Yojan , Mujdal, Musal, Vazra,Kharag, Tikha Falak, Vashva-astra, Varuna-astra, Vavya-Astra, Naag-pash, Nasrayan-astra, Gandharva-astra, Brahma-astra, Garur-astra, anjar-astra, Pashupat-astra, Jimbhan-astra, parvat-astra, Survya-astar, Kaal Kaal, Mahanal, Maheshwar-astra, Yamdand-astra and many thousands of Astra (weapons).\n\nShe is Followed by Yojiniya, Dakniya, Bhoot, preat, pishac, Kushmand, BrahmaRakshas, Yaksh And Kinnar.\n\nCONCLUSION DRAWN FROM STUDYING SHIVA PURAN\n\nMATA BHADRAKALI IS SEEN AS THE GREAT FIERCE WORRIER WHO FIGHTS ON BEHALF OF DEVAS AND DESTROYS THE DEMON ARMY .\n\nThe Third greatest pauranik reference about Maa Bhadrakali is based on a story that originated in the Markandeya Purana, and is called the ‚ÄúBhadrakali Mahatmyam‚Äù or ‚ÄúDarika-vadham‚Äù . It is currently found written in Malayalam Language.\n\nC.) Bhadrakali Mahatmyam\n\n( or ‚ÄúDarika-vadham‚Äù)\n\nHere Maa BhadraKali is described as a Great Worrier and a General of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Army and also She is Seen Showing her Motherly nature\n\nHere Maa BhadraKali is described as a Great Worrier and a General of Lord Shiva‚Äôs Army and also She is Seen Showing her Motherly nature\n\nIn Kerala, Maa Bhadrakali is most commonly worshipped as ‚ÄúDarikajit,‚Äù meaning one who ended demon named Darika.\n\nThe asura Darika was said to have a very powerful wife, Manodari, who had in her possession a special mantra that would keep her husband invincible, and thus her marriage forever safe. Darika used his newfound invincibility to torment the lokas and usurp the kingdom of the Devas.\n\nThe Land Of Kerala was Created by Parasurama (6th incarnation of Lord Vishnu), But the Land was was harassed by the demon king Daruka. So he prayed to Lord Shiva to help him.\n\nWhen Lord Shiva came know about the misdeeds of demon Darika, and in as an answer to Lord Parasurama request he opened his fiery third eye and the massive ferocious form of Bhadrakali emerged (In this incarnation, the Goddess was not his wife, but her daughter.)\n\nShiva ordered Bhadrakali to destroy Darika, with a Vetala as her vehicle.\n\nHowever the Goddess found it impossible to kill the demon as he was ever in the protection of his wife‚Äôs mantra chanting. So the Goddess split her form into that of her fierce warrior self that continued to engage in combat and that of a common woman.\n\nThe Goddess went to Manodari, claiming to be the wife of a soldier who was fighting for Darika in his army in the losing battle. With this, Manodari broke her chanting to console the worried woman, breaking Darika‚Äôs broke invincibility shield. Maa BhadraKali immediately disappeared from Manodari‚Äôs presence while on the battlefield she had already managed to injure Darika.\n\nAs Darika lay at her feet, about to be killed, It is Said that as he knew the motherly nature of maa BhadraKali he appealed to her motherly nature as a last resort, with faux praises and prayers. But the Devas gathered there began to sing praises to the Goddess, thus reminding the Goddess of the atrocities Darika had committed that caused her birth in the first place.\n\nAs The Demon deeds were unforgivable, and when Maa BhadraKali remembered how much trouble the demon has brought to her other innocent children‚Äôs Maa Bhadrakali became very angry and in that anger she severed the demons head and held it aloft in her left hand as she danced around in the battlefield.\n\nBut her anger would not succumb and so the Devas invoked Lord Shiva to intervene and calm Kali down, as when in anger Kali had the tendency to reduce the universe into nothingness. Shiva lay in her path as a crying baby and this time (Gandakarna), Kali‚Äôs true motherliness was awakened.\n\nIt is said that Maa Bhadra Kali expressed her wish to Lord Shiva to stay at the spot and protect the local people till the end of time. The spot where she remained is said to be the Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple.\n\nThe people of Kodungallur believe that this temple was, in the olden days, a Shiva shrine and it was Parasurama who installed the murti of Bhadrakali close to one of Shiva.\n\nBhadrakali at Kodungallur still remains one of her 3 most auspicious temples in Kerala, along with Thirumandhamkunnu Temple and Parumala Valiya Panayannarkavu Devi Temple. It is also listed as one of the 13 ‚Äòkaavu‚Äô temples of Kali and as one of the main 64 Bhadrakali temples in Kerala.\n\nNote :- It is True that this Story is Kind of similar to that of the Trinetrakali who is been described in the Ling Puran , however it is different in many aspects of the story .\n\nIn Ling puran It is Never said that it was ‚ÄúBhadra Kali‚Äù who fought the battle neither it is suggested that she is riding a Vetala as her vehicle. (Reference from lingpuran already cyted in the snapshot above)\n\nAnd the name of the Demon is also different , In Ling Puran It is Daruk and in Bhadrakali Mahatmayam it is Darika .\n\nand in Ling Puran It is Stated that it is a Divya Ansh Of Maa Parvati who entered into Lord Shiva and Got Mixed with the Karal Vish present in his Neck and then that emerged out from the third eye of Lord Shiva . however in BhadraKali Mahatmyam the entire mythological story and the appearance described is entirely different.\n\nHowever the similarity also exists in destroying the demon and than as per some sources loosing control of anger , which is calm down by Lord Shiva , who in both the Pauranik incidents turned into a Baby and appealed to the Motherly Nature of Maa Bhadra Kali ..\n\nCONCLUSION DRAWN FROM STUDYING BHADRAKALI MAHATMAYAM\n\nMATA BHADRAKALI IS SEEN AS THE GREAT FIERCE WORRIER WHO FIGHTS ON BEHALF OF DEVAS AND DESTROYS THE DEMON DARIKA . SHE IS ALSO SEEN AS THE GREAT WORRIER WHOSE TRUE NATURE IS MOTHERLY LOVE WHICH THE DEMON ALSO KNEW AND LORD SHIVA SHOWED IT TO THE WORLD.\n\n‚Äî\n\nAtharvana Bhadrakali\n\nThe Combined Power of Lord Vishnu , Lord Shiva & Mata Shakti. Also Famously Known as Mata Pratyangira and Narasimhi.\n\nThis is actually a different form of Adishakti, Who is also given the Name Bhadra Kali and in South India she is worshipped as goddess the ruling Goddess of the Atharva Veda (i.e the Veda famous for spells and magic ect) (That‚Äôs why the concept is been added here) .\n\nShe is seen as one who reverses any black magic attacks thats what her name Pratyangira means i.e Prati means reverse and Angiras means attacking. She is also known as Siddhilakshmi or Narasimhi and she is also said to be an avatar of a form of MaaGuhya Kali (described in detail below).\n\nShe is considered to be a powerful repellent of the influences generated by witchcraft and is said to have the power to punish anyone doing Adharma . Even the Three gods Brahma, Vishnu or Siva are not safe if they do any adharma.\n\nIt is said in the reference The Hymns of the Atharva-Veda: The Sacred Books of the East by Max Muller that when she shakes her Lion‚Äôs Mane, she throws the stars into disarray. This is considered as the great powerful form of Adishakti Mahakali (as per all Tantras and Kalika Puranas it is MahaKali) who is much more powerful than the three gods combined .\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY ABOUT DEVI ATHARVANA BHADRAKALI\n\nin Markandeya Purana and Shiva Purana, in the beginning of the Treta yuga, Lord Narasimha, (an avatar of Vishnu), ended the demon King Hiranyakashipu by tearing up his body and drinking his blood. However it is said that Because of the anger in Hiranyakashipu‚Äôs body and blood Lord Narsimha drunk on rage and could not be stopped. To calm him down, Lord Shiva came down in a a bird-animal-human who is known as ‚ÄúSharabha‚Äù. Upon seeing this, Lord Narasimha created a two headed bird form known as Gandaberunda, and started Fighting Sarabha.\n\nMost of the times has been seen that Lord Shiva has to come to calm the outrageous nature of Maa Kali but this time It was Maa Kali who stepped down to Stop the battle between these two powerful avataars of Lord Shiva and Lord Narshimha .\n\nThese two beings fought a long time terrorising the world without reaching a conclusion. Hence seeing this AdiShakti Mahakali invoked her form known as Pratyangira or Atharvana Bhadrakali.\n\nPratyangira or Atharvana Bhadrakali appeared before these fighting beings and roared. When she roared, the fight between Sharabha and Gandaberund stopped and the peace was restored again.\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MAA ATHARVANA BHADRA KALI.\n\nShe is shown as dark complexioned, terrible in aspect\n\nShe is having a lion‚Äôs face with reddened eyes.\n\nShe rides on a lion\n\nShe is found wearing black sari.\n\nshe wears a garland of human skulls;\n\nshe holds a trident, a serpent in the form of a noose, a hand-drum and a skull in her four hands.\n\n7th Avatar.) MAA UGRA CANDA (OR CHANDA)\n\n(THE FIRST AVATAR OF MATA MAHAKALI WHO ENDED DEMON MAHISASUR IN HIS FIRST BIRTH )\n\nIn the above description we have already told you the story of The Dream of Demon Mahisasur, and how he got his Boon . And from the same reference of Kalika Puran, Section ‚Äì Mahishasura Upakhyan we know that before Bhadrakali maa ended Demon Mahisa and severed his head. It was Goddess Ugra Canda (or Chanda) who ended Demon Mahisa in his First Birth.\n\nA.) As Per Kalika Puran\n\nTHE APPEARANCE OF MAA UGRA CANDA KALI (AS PER KALIKA PURAN) :-\n\nThe appearance of both these goddesses as Per Kalika Puran is same except for a small difference which is that The BhadraKali avatar of Mata Mahakali is 16 (Sixteen) armed , while the avatar Ugra Canda (or Chanda) is 18 (Eighteen) armed\n\n, and in these two extra arms she is seen holding a club (in her right arm)\n\n(and in her Left arm) she is seen holding a Drinking Cup ,\n\nshe also rides a Lion Like Maa Durga and Bhadrakali.\n\nThis is the Only difference in appearance of Mata Ugra canda (chanda) and Mata Bhadra Kali.\n\n8th Avatar.) MAA DURGA\n\n(THE THIRD AVATAR OF MATA MAHAKALI WHO ENDED DEMON MAHISASUR IN HIS THIRD BIRTH AND GRANTED HIM SALVATION)\n\nIn the above described reference of Kalika puran about the story of The Dream of Demon Mahisasur . The Demon Finally ended By The hands of Maa Durga .\n\nAnd As Per the Boon Given by Maa BhadraKali , In his Third Birth his Head was not severed and he was granted his wish to get the ‚ÄúPooja Bhaga‚Äù while he is present below the feet of Maa Durga .\n\nFrom the same Reference of Kalika Puran it is clear that All three avatars i.e UgraCanda, BhadraKali & Maa Durga , are the Avatars or manifestations of Adishakti Mahakali .\n\nKalika Puran clearly tells us that Maa Durga, is and avatar of Mata Mahakali , Who is The Ultimate ParamShakti and Mother of all Universe . Pauranik Literature call her as Mahamaya. Maa Durga ended Demon Mahisasur but because of the boon he Obtained from Maa Bhadra Kali . :-\n\nDemon Mahisasur achieved salvation. (as per Kalika puran)\n\nHis Head was not severed in his Third Birth . [ The reason and complete concept is described in detail in our Tab Why Shiva is present below the feet of KƒÅli Maa ?(As Per Kalika Puran & Yogani Tantra)]\n\nHe got the Part of Pooja as he is present at the feets of Maa Durga , Maa Ugrachanda & Maa Bhadrakali\n\nAnd because of the same Boon We Indians still picture him below the feet‚Äôs of Maa Durga in Every Navaratri Pooja .\n\n9th Avatar.) MAA PARVATI\n\n(THE REASON WHY MAA KALI IS SOMETIMES CALLED THE WIFE OF LORD SHIVA ? )\n\nWe were able to find the correct answer of why mata kali is sometimes referred as the wife of Lord Shiva ? ..the answer is incredible.\n\nA.)\n\nTHE MYTHOLOGICAL STORY FROM ‚ÄúKALIKA PURAN‚Äù\n\n(section- ‚ÄúNarad Agman Vernan‚Äù in hindi edition & ch 41 in the sanskrit to english edition)\n\nAs per Kalika Puran section narad agman vernan , it is told to us that the queen of King Himvata who was knows as Menaka, with a view of having an offspring used to observe fasting on the eighth day of the month of Chaitra (March- April) and on the ninth day worshipped the great goddess Mahakali by offering ‚Äúmodala‚Äù(a type of sweets), bali (oblation of food) ,pista , payasa, sandal past and flowers; thus beginning with the month of Caitra, she after making herself pure worshipped her (i.e Mahamaya Mahakali) every day for twenty seven years.\n\nafter twenty seven years the mother of the world was pleased with her and appeared to her and spoke to lady Meneka :-\n\n‚Äù O majestic lady ! please do now ask for everything what you had desired of me, I shall full all your desire‚Äù\n\nMeneka on seeing her great mother was rejoiced and started worshipping her. she didn‚Äôt stop worshipping her until mother Mahakali re-asked her of what is desired boon.\n\nThen the glorious one (Menaka) first prayed for having one hundred sons endowed with strength and long life, wealth and success.\n\nand then she sought the boon for having a beautiful daughter with all the good qualities , who would bring joy to both the families (parents and in-laws) the type of which is rare in the three worlds.\n\nin response to the wish of lady Meneka mother goddess Mahakali said :‚Äì\n\n‚ÄúLet you have one hundred sones of powers , the first one among them shall be the most powerful one.\n\nand for the welfare if gods , men , rakshasas and the entire world I myself shall be born as your daughter.‚Äù\n\nMenaka in the course of time gave birth to ‚ÄúMainaka‚Äù the superior most of the mountains , who challenged the lord of the gods and up still now lives with his wongh in the modst of the ocean . ans Subsequently Menaka gave birh to other ninty nine sons one by one.\n\nThreafter the great goddess Mahakalika yognidra, the embodiment of the world , who had given up her former body of Sati in order to be born , went to Menaka and was conceived by her in the dur course , un her womb. She was born at the midnight on the ninth day (navauni tithi).\n\nAnd at the time of putting rice for the first time into the mouth of her daughter Himvat gave her the name ‚ÄúKali‚Äù as she resembled the petals of blue lotus in her complexion. and other relatibes called her by that name , and also by the name Parvati and Girinandani (i.e daughter of the mountain)\n\nso it is also further described by sage Narad also that Maa Parvati is the reincernation of Maa Sati and the section clrarly tells us that both the avatars i.e Maa parvati and Maa Sati are the incarnation of Maa Mahakali Adishakti.\n\nCONCLUSION DRAWN FROM KALIKA PURAN :\n\n1.) BOTH SATI AND PARVATI ARE THE AVATARS OF MAA MAHAKALIKA\n\n2.) THE CHILDHOOD NAME OF MAA PARVATI IS ‚ÄúKALI‚Äù BECAUSE SHE LOOKED LIKE A BLUE LOTUS (WHICH WE FREQUENTLY SEE IS PRESENT IN HER HANDS). THE NAME WAS GIVEN BY HER FATHER KING HIMVATA.\n\n3.) ONLY PARVATI MAA IS CALLED AS THE SHAKTI OF SHIVA, AND ACCEPT THIS NO OTHER AVATAR OF ADISHAKTI IS CALLED THE WIFE (SHAKTI) OF SHIVA BY ANY OF THE PURANS AND TANTRAS.\n\n10th Avatar.) KRISHNA KALI\n\n(Actually Lord Krishna is worshiped as the Avatar of Maa MahaKali)\n\nTo learn about Krishna kali is really important as this avatar connects Vashnavism and Shaktism.\n\nWell in this relation their are TWO CONCEPTS :\n\nA.) FOLK STORY OF LORD KRISHNA TURNING TO KALI MAA TO SAVE RADHA\n\n(NOTE ‚Äì WE HAVE NOT FOUND ANY MYTHOLOGICAL REFERENCE DESCRIBING THIS STORY OF KRISHNAKALI)\n\n‚Äù FOLK tales narrate a story of how Krishna assumed the form of Kali Maa as a lila or divine play .\n\nThe event unflods in the puranic forest of Vrindavana where the cowherd Yadavas were peacefully residing with their much loved leader and friend , Sri Krishna.\n\nEvery night , hearing the flute of Krishna at midnight Srimati Radharani would quitely slip out from her home to secretly meet with her lover Sri Krishna in the deep forests . However this was eventually observed by the shrewd sister in laws of Radha , Jatila and Kutila who informed her husband Ayan of his wife‚Äôs Actions.\n\nInfuriated Ayan set off in anger, into the deep woods . However the lord of all beings , Sri Krishna already knew what has happened . He quickly asked Radha to pick up all the wild fruits and flowers that she could find and sit down at his feet in an worshipful gesture .\n\nRadha obeyed what krishna said and lord Krishna, raised a sickel in his hands , wore the garland of red flowers, let his long hairs loosened in air and stuck his tongue out and hence transformed himself to an image of Kali Maa ‚Äî who is the kuldevi of Radha‚Äôs husband Ayan . and when Ayan finally arrived on the spot he found his wife doing puja of their family deity . Thus Srimati Radharani was saved .\n\nThis is how as per the story, Lord Krishna turned himself to maa kali and saved his friend, lover and devotee -Radha rani . since then lord Krishna has been worshiped as KRISHNA KALI.‚Äù\n\n(NOTE:- it should be noted that if we accept this story then the story clearly tells that the worship of maa kali is older then the worship of lord krishna, and this statement is in accordance of fact that Vaishnavism came after Shaktism. and this points us out to our only conclusion that Lord Krishna Is an avatar of Maa Kali. )\n\nB.) As Per Mahakaal Samhita\n\nLord Krishna is the avatar of Maa Kali\n\nWe were not able to find any Mythological reference stating the above folk lore however while researching Majakaal Samhita, Kamkala Khand, (Uttradh Bagh) we were able to find a reference where Mahakaal samhita tells us that :-\n\n‚Äù In Dwapar Yuga Maa Kali took avatar of Lord Krishna for the good of all life. ‚Äú\n\nhowever scholars like Dr. Kishoor Nath jha , the writter of Mahakaal Samhita uttradh bhag ‚Äì Kamkala khand also believe that, in many tantric writings like ‚ÄúTodal Tantra‚Äù ,‚ÄùMundmala Tantra‚Äù & ‚ÄúShakti-Sangam Tantra‚Äù (these are most noticable in this reference) have tried to stablish a connection between the Ten Mahavidyaas and Ten Avatar‚Äôs of Lord Vishnu .\n\nLike Todal Tantra Chapter 10 we find the following declaration:\n\n‚ÄúShri Shiva said: Tara Devi is the blue (fish) form, Bagala is the tortoise incarnation, Dhumavati is the boar, Chinnamasta is Narisimha, Bhuvaneshvari is Vamana, Matangi is the Rama form, Tripura is Jamadagni, Bhairavi is Balabhadra, Mahalakshmi is Buddha, and Durga is the Kalki form. Bhagavati Kali is the Krishna murti.‚Äù\n\nand in the similar connection Mahakaal Samhita (an much older reference)tells us that :\n\n‚ÄúLord Krishna is an avatar of Maa Kali‚Äù.\n\nWell in the last 500 years, shakti sadhaks of eastern India personally felt the unity of these two important forms of Hindu pantheon . Many songs and poems were composed in honor of this united form which was named ‚ÄúKRISHNA-KALI ‚Äú.\n\nIn many such song the sadhak poses himself as a little child requesting his loved mother to drop her ghastly look to assume the more pleasing form of Krishna with kadamba garlands , yellow robes and enchanting crown of flowers and peacock feathers . It is also to note that many scholars have said that their are separate beej mantras of Krishna and Kali maa . But in Many Many Mantras ‚ÄúKreem‚Äù is the Same Beej Mantra also used in Mantras of Lord Krishna .\n\nIn the words of an Eighteenth century self realized kali sadhak known as Premik Maharaj . The first few lines of the song translates as ‚Äî-\n\n‚Äù My mother has become Krishna on seeing the enchanting night of full moon in the season of spring .\n\nMy black moon(Kali) has now started the divine pla"
