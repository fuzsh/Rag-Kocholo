He describes how we can constantly contemplate > on God even while doing our daily chores; A while back I was reading a book about feminine aspects of divinity in Hinduism or some such and one of the articles in that book was about Ramprasad (Sen?) and his poetry. According to the article he was an influential figure in the development of Bengali literature but nowadays he is considered somewhat old-fashioned and is not that popular. Is this true? Anyway, he was ardent bhakta of Kali Ma and there were some translations of his poems which were absolutely terrific. The book was otherwise too expensive compared to its' worth but I felt like buying it for those translations alone. Jagannath, if you or some other knowledgeable person could post some more of his poems, especially the ones that clearly bring out Advaita bhava like the one above, I'm sure the list members would find it very interesting. -- Jaldhar H.
