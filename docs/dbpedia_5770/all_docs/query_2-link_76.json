This blog came into existence after several devotees of Shri Radhe Guru Maa across the globe suggested that such a page be created to give them an opportunity to keep track of Shri Radhe Guru Maa’s Darshan schedule, Bhakti Sandhya and itinerary.\n\nThe views expressed in this space are being made public as an act of thanksgiving for the wonderful presence of Shri Radhe Guru Maa’s miraculous grace in the lives of her devotees. Shri Radhe Guru Maa’ has no role as such in writing, editing or publishing these articles. We request readers who have queries, doubts or feedback to address their messages mail on admin@radhemaa.com"
