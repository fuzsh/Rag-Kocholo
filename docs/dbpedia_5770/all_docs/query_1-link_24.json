He was a great saint in Shakta cult. But, he was too a natural poet and composer. \r\nThe songs are hymns to Goddess Mother Kali couched in rustic words and symbols of everyday life. Yet, most of this symbolism is a rare mosaic of the occult mystery of Tantrashastra and carry a double meaning. Thus, flying kites, the blind ox trudging routine endless circles of the village oil-machine (ghaani), the small town courtroom, the sailing craft of life--are all symbols of the highest mystic Shakta worship of Goddess Durga or Kali (Mahashakti). \r\nThe English rendering aims to echo the nuances of the original in its threefold uniqueness: (a) simplicity and rustic symbols, (b) their inner spiritual mystique, and (c) muse and rhymes. The volume will treat the English speaking world to a taste of this rare Indian spiritual songs and poetry.\r\nAbout the Author:Prof. Shyamal Banerjee is a student of English literature. Teachings of Swamiji and Sri Aurobindo. English (Hons.) and M.A. (Econ.) of Calcutta University. First in English in IAS. Former Sr. Professor, IIM (Joka), Kolkata. Author of many books and poems in English (and Bengali) – he took to translation spurred by a challenge to bring rare and unique Sanskrit and Bengali classics to the European reader without spoiling the savour and muse of the original. \r\nThe result was his rendering into English of Michael Madhusudan Dutt’s Meghnad Badh Kavya (original in Bengali); Vidyasagar – The Ocean Man of Compassion (Karunasagar Vidyasagar in Bengali); Kalidasa’s Meghadootam; Srimadbhagabad Geeta (original in Sanskrit); and now The Divine Songs of Sage Poet Ramprasad (original in Bengali).\r\nÂ \r\nÂ",

Thus, flying kites, the blind ox trudging routine endless circles of the village oil-machine (ghaani), the small town courtroom, the sailing craft of life--are all symbols of the highest mystic Shakta worship of Goddess Durga or Kali (Mahashakti).\n\nThe English rendering aims to echo the nuances of the original in its threefold uniqueness: (a) simplicity and rustic symbols, (b) their inner spiritual mystique, and (c) muse and rhymes. The volume will treat the English speaking world to a taste of this rare Indian spiritual songs and poetry.\n\nAbout the Author:\n\nProf. Shyamal Banerjee is a student of English literature.
