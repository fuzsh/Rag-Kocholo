        "text": "Interview w/a chair\n\nI thought that if I sat in the old chair, I would be safe from any other thing in the room.\n\nMy innocence was no longer the sole focus of my thoughts.\n\nSitting in the chair, I absorbed the sound of a morning rain.\n\nI got up and left and came back to the chair.\n\nI used the disinfectant and the rag to remove any dirt from it.\n\nNow that the chair was clean, I could sit in it forever.\n\nSoon I fell asleep there.\n\nIn my dreams I could send fearful messages to it.\n\nThe chair allows one person at a time to sit on its seat. Unoccupied, it stands strangely, even awkwardly. It takes up space and makes no sound.\n\nI can kick over the chair and send it skidding into the wall. I can stand at the bay window with the overturned chair at my feet, looking out at the face of the hill.\n\nWhen the day seems bright and unrelenting outside, I am the only one who remains inert. My family is taking their loud laughter out into the road. There is an erased landscape I am seeing.\n\nI bow at the hips 1000 times to show the truth to them. At a certain point, the chair tells me we can only last a few minutes more. After that I will have to yield to something.\n\nWhen I paint the chair, I do it lovingly, with a soft expensive paintbrush. Instead of paint, though, I use plain water. In the room, there is the faint taste of my own spit.\n\nThe chair says something forever, and I am going to be the one to hear it.\n\nThe chair answers silently when I ask if someone else has ever sat in it before.\n\nA better question would be, do you remember the name of the person who is speaking to you?\n\nWhen I ask this, the chair reminds me of my preference.\n\nNow we rearrange the room, letting our long hair flow behind us.\n\nSince we are very many, it only took a few moments; all we had to do was each choose one thing and put it somewhere else.\n\nI slid the chair across to where the bookcase was. I sat down on the side of the overturned chair, amazed at how quickly it was done.\n\nOnce the others were gone, I began to sink down and get comfortable in the chair, breaking it somewhat.\n\nI let my hair down again, wishing for it to be even longer."
