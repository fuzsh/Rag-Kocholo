        "text": "Ramprasad Sen – (1718 – 1745) Ramprasad was a Bhakti poet of eighteenth century Bengal. His devotional poems, known as Ramprasadi, are usually addressed to Mother Kali. The poems of Ramprasad were popularised by Sri Ramakrishna.\n\nTaking the name of Kali,\n\nDive deep, O mind,\n\nInto the heart’s fathomless depths,\n\nWhere many a gem lies hid\n\nDive deep and make your way\n\nTo Mother Kali’s realm.\n\n– Ramprasad Sen,\n\nSelected Poems of Ramprasad\n\nA Country Fair\n\nA Serious Grievance\n\nCall out Kali, Kali\n\nCome on Mind\n\nDoes Suffering Scare Me?\n\nI spent my days in fun\n\nI’m Sick of Living Mother\n\nMind Don’t Sleep\n\nO Longing Mind\n\nShe’s Playing in my heart\n\nThe Diamond Essence of Awareness\n\nWho in this World\n\nWho Knows your magic\n\nWhy is Mother Kali so radiantly Black?\n\nView: Poems of Ramprasad\n\nRamprasad is one of the most inspired poets in Bengali literature. Born at Kumarhati in West Bengal in 1718, he was well educated in medicine and languages. However, he had no interest in material life. It is said that, after marriage, he obtained a job as a book-keeper for an accountant. However, he wrote Divine Mother’s name all over the ledgers. The employer saw this and recognized a saint in making. He sent him home with a promise to support him and his family.\n\nRamprasad used to wade into the river Ganges up to his neck and sing the songs in honor of the Divine Mother. Boats cruising the Ganges would stop to listen to his songs, people dying on the banks of the river would ask Ramprasad to sing to them. Ramprasad became a favorite of the local king but he was never attached to riches till he passed away in 1775.\n\nRamprasad’s songs are still sung to his day by everyone, even school children. His songs became very famous in the west because Sri Ramakrishna used to quote from it.\n\nLinks"
