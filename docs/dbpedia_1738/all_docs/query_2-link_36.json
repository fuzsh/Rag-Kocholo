VERDIER were married in 1846 in Lincoln Co., MO.114527 The place requires proof - the Sitton-Gibson genealogy gave KY, but it would appear more likely to have been close to the birthplace of Saphrona, which was Lincoln Co., MO, which was also where Robert Verdier died. His having been there for the last 20 years of his life indicates a greater likelihood of stability, and a lesser chance that he went to KY for a marriage and then returned. If Mary accompanied her brother John Trimble Temple to Lincoln Co., MO in 1843, then she was in place for the death of Robert's first wife and available for him to marry her in 1845 or 1846.\n\nSaphronia VERDIER114527 was born on 11 September 1844.
