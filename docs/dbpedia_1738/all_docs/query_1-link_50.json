        "text": "Yvette Andréyor was born as Yvette Louise Pauline Royé in Paris, France in 1891. She was the daughter of the artist Jean-Baptiste André Roye and Marie-Louise Carcel. At age six, she made her stage debut at the Théâtre de l'Odéon. She continued her artistic training at the Conservatoire where she would win the first prize in 1913. Then she played at the Théâtre Antoine and in Belgium. She made her film debut in 1910 for the Gaumont studio. Opposite Léonce Perret she played the wife in Le Haleur/The Hauler (1911, Léonce Perret). In Le Bossu/The Hunchback (1912, Andrew Heuzé) with Henry Krauss, she was the first performer of Aurore de Nevers. Director Louis Feuillade noted her and made several short films with her, alongside Renée Carl, René Navarre, André Luguet or Suzanne Grandais. The next ten years, she was known as one of the favorite performers of Feuillade. In 1912, she played Josephine in Fantômas (1913, Louis Feuillade), a serial in twelve episodes with René Navarre in the title role. Three years later, she played the sweet Jacqueline Aubry in another serial, Judex (1913, Louis Feuillade). Aubry is a young widow who falls in love with the popular hero, played by René Creste, though her father, the evil banker Favraux, has caused the death of Judex/Jacques' father. Judex wants to take justice (henceforth judex=justice), but the sight of the innocent Jacqueline and her little son prevents him. In 1917 Andreyor married actor Jean Toulout. They made several films together and divorced in 1926. In 1917-1918, she acted again in Feuillade's sequel La nouvelle mission de Judex/The new mission of Judex. It would turn out to be her final collaboration with Feuillade.\n\nYvette Andréyor worked with many other filmmakers, such as Gaston Ravel, Jacques de Baroncelli, Robert Peguy and Germaine Dulac. She played with Romuald Joubé, her husband Jean Toulout and Gaston Modot in Mathias Sandorf (1921, Henry Fescourt), an adaptation of the adventure novel by Jules Verne. In 1923, she returned to the Théâtre de l'Odéon where she had made her stage debut. For several years she devoted herself exclusively to the stage. In 1928, she appeared in one last silent film, Les deux timides/Two Timid Souls (1928, René Clair), featuring Jim Gérald and Pierre Batcheff. In the 1930's, Andréyor only played in some short films and was offered supporting roles under the direction of Alberto Cavalcanti and Robert Peguy. After the war she shared the bill with Georges Marchal in Torrents (1946, Serge de Poligny) and with Bourvil in Pas si bête/Not so stupid (1946, ). The actress later focused mainly to the theatre where she played in Luigi Pirandello's Six Characters in Search of an Author and François Mauriac The Fire on the Earth. She finished her film career with the role of the governess of Yves Vincent in La planque/The Hideout (1961, Raoul André). In total anonymity, Yvette Andréyor died in 1962 in Paris. She was 71. Her former husband Jean Toulout had died just 12 days before her.\n\nMusidora was a French actress, film director, and writer. She is particularly remembered for portraying the vamp villainess Irma Vep in the crime serial film \"Les Vampires\" (1915-1916) and the gang leader Diana Monti/Marie Verdier in the revenge-themed film serial film \"Judex\" (1917). Her screen persona depicted her with \"heavily kohled dark eyes, somewhat sinister make-up, pale skin and exotic wardrobes\". Her characters were among the most popular femmes fatales of their era.\n\nMusidora's real name was Jeanne Roques. She was born in a Parisian family of artists. Her father was the composer Jacques Roques, while her mother was the painter Adèle Clémence Porche. Musidora started an acting career in her teen years, and made her film debut in 1914. She took the stage name Musidora, naming herself after a character of that name in the novels of Théophile Gautier. The name means \"gift of the Muses\".\n\nEarly in her film career, Musidora collaborated with the film director Louis Feuillade. He was a pioneer in the development of the crime thriller as distinct genre. By playing villainesses, Musidora became one of the most famous French actresses of the 1910s. But she also found some success as a film director and a film producer. She directed 10 films between the late 1910s and the early 1920s, though only two of them have survived. Two of her films were adaptations of the novels of Colette (1873-1954). The novelist happened to be a personal friend of Musidora, and was willing to help with the screenplays for the adaptations.\n\nMusidora's acting career ended by 1926, but she continued working as a writer and film producer until the early 1950s. In her old age, she worked in the ticket booth of the Cinémathèque Française. In 1957, Musidora died in Paris. She was buried in the Cimetière de Bois-le-Roi.\n\nThis blonde stunner and German-born foreign import started life on May 18, 1908, in Berlin as Nathalie Margoulis (or perhaps Natalia Lyech) the daughter of a Russian banker and French pediatrician. The family moved to Paris when she was young where she received her schooling both there and in Switzerland. While little is known about her father, her mother was Ina Löscht (née Blumenfeld), who served at a French field hospital at the onset of WWII.\n\nLya broke into the business as a model and first appeared on film in the Francis Lederer starrer Irene Rysbergues große Liebe (1929). MGM, checking out European actors, took notice of Lya and signed her, among others including Charles Boyer, to perform in French-language version of Hollywood movies. It was during this time she starred in the classic Luis Buñuel film Das goldene Zeitalter (1930), which was co-written by none other than Salvador Dalí.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, she failed to hit stardom as her thick accent was a primary hindrance. During this turbulent time, she met and married actor Charles Morton in 1931. That very brief marriage produce one daughter. A second marriage in 1932 to business manager Percy Montague also ended quickly. She became a U.S. citizen in 1933. Touring successfully with the 1936 play \"Night of January 16\", only one decent film came her way, Wer ist Martin Mills (1937), but more money problems and an emotional breakdown stopped the momentum dead in its tracks. She made a brief return to Paris to perform in the play \"The King's Dough\" but was forced to escape with rise of Nazism. Left destitute now, she made a failed suicide attempt with pills.\n\nFollowing unbilled parts in such films as George White's 1935 Scandals (1935) and Vagabond Lady (1935), she made a comeback of sorts, courtesy of a Warner Bros. contract, with the film Ich war ein Spion der Nazis (1939). This success led to roles in Das zweite Leben des Doktor X (1939) and her last, Murder in the Air (1940), starring Ronald Reagan. A third short-lived marriage occurred with Chicago vending machine operator John Gunnerson, who was once married to silent star Anna Q. Nilsson.\n\nThe war-era 1940s saw major financial and career setbacks once again, eventually filing for bankruptcy. Later work included torch song singing as a club chanteuse and writing as a fashion newspaper columnist. Her life vastly improved following her stable fourth marriage to George Feit, which lasted until her death. The couple settled in Newport Beach, California where she involved herself in charity work. Lya died of a heart ailment at age 78, on June 2, 1986.\n\nOne of the brightest film stars to grace the screen was born Emilie Claudette Chauchoin on September 13, 1903, in Saint Mandé, France where her father owned a bakery at 57, rue de la République (now Avenue Général de Gaulle). The family moved to the United States when she was three. As Claudette grew up, she wanted nothing more than to play to Broadway audiences (in those days, any actress or actor worth their salt went for Broadway, not Hollywood). After her formal education ended, she enrolled in the Art Students League, where she paid for her dramatic training by working in a dress shop. She made her Broadway debut in 1923 in the stage production of \"The Wild Wescotts\". It was during this event that she adopted the name Claudette Colbert.\n\nWhen the Great Depression shut down most of the theaters, Claudette decided to make a go of it in films. Her first film was called For the Love of Mike (1927). Unfortunately, it was a box-office disaster. She wasn't real keen on the film industry, but with an extreme scarcity in theatrical roles, she had no choice but to remain. In 1929 she starred as Joyce Roamer in The Lady Lies (1929). The film was a success and later that year she had another hit entitled The Hole in the Wall (1929). In 1930 she starred opposite Fredric March in Manslaughter (1930), which was a remake of the silent version of eight years earlier. A year after that Claudette was again paired in a film with March, Honor Among Lovers (1931). It fared well at the box-office, probably only because it was the kind of film that catered to women who enjoyed magazine fiction romantic stories. In 1932 Claudette played the evil Poppeia in Cecil B. DeMille's last great work, Im Zeichen des Kreuzes (1932), and once again was cast with March. Later the same year she was paired with Jimmy Durante in The Phantom President (1932). By now Claudette's name symbolized good movies and she, along with March, pulled crowds into the theaters with the acclaimed Aufruhr in Utopia (1933).\n\nThe next year started a little on the slow side with the release of Four Frightened People (1934), where Claudette and her co-stars were at odds with the dreaded bubonic plague on board a ship. However, the next two films were real gems for this young actress. First up, Claudette was charming and radiant in Cecil B. DeMille's spectacular Cleopatra (1934). It wasn't one of DeMille's finest by any means, but it was a financial success and showcased Claudette as never before. However, it was as Ellie Andrews, in the now famous Es geschah in einer Nacht (1934), that ensured she would be forever immortalized. Paired with Clark Gable, the madcap comedy was a mega-hit all across the country. It also resulted in Claudette being nominated for and winning the Oscar that year for Best Actress. IN 1935 she was nominated again for Oberarzt Dr. Monet (1935), where she played Dr. Jane Everest, on the staff at a mental institution. The performance was exquisite. Films such as Das Mädchen, das den Lord nicht wollte (1935), Trommeln am Mohawk (1939) and Keine Zeit für die Liebe (1943) kept fans coming to the theaters and the movie moguls happy. Claudette was a sure drawing card for virtually any film she was in. In 1944 she starred as Anne Hilton in Als du Abschied nahmst (1944). Again, although she didn't win, Claudette picked up her third nomination for Best Actress.\n\nBy the late 1940s and early 1950s she was not only seen on the screen but the infant medium of television, where she appeared in a number of programs. However, her drawing power was fading somewhat as new stars replaced the older ones. In 1955 she filmed the western Des Teufels rechte Hand (1955) and wasn't seen on the screen again until Sein Name war Parrish (1961). It was her final silver screen performance. Her final appearance before the cameras was in a TV movie, Society (1987). She did, however, remain on the stage where she had returned in 1956, her first love. After a series of strokes, Claudette divided her time between New York and Barbados. On July 30, 1996, Claudette died in Speightstown, Barbados. She was 92.\n\nDiminutive, fiery-tempered Simone Simon was born in France, but spent much of her early childhood in Madagascar, where her father managed a graphite mine. Her schooling was somewhat unsettled, her family moving from city to city (Berlin, Budapest, Turin) before finally establishing themselves in Paris in 1930. Simone started as a dress designer, fashion model and occasional performer in stage musicals. She eventually met the director Marc Allégret, who took her under his wing. Her film debut was in 1931 and she had her first major hit as Jean Gabin's co-star in Bestie Mensch (1938), directed by Jean Renoir.\n\nThere were two halves to Simone's history in Hollywood. In 1936, Darryl F. Zanuck signed her to a contract at 20th Century Fox on the strength of a picture she had made two years earlier, Allegret's Lac aux dames (1934). She was launched with an expensive publicity campaign which accentuated her continental allure, particularly, her 'sexy pout'. During her tenure, problems surfaced regarding her command of English and also her limited singing skills. Dissatisfied with the roles she was given, Simone returned to France and 'La Bete Humaine'. She made a second attempt at Hollywood, acting in William Dieterle's Der Teufel und Daniel Webster (1941) as Belle, the devil's handmaiden. The New York Times review of October 17 considered her 'completely out of key'. Simone's best work, however, was to come in the shape of the cult horror classic Katzenmenschen (1942). Producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur used her triangular-faced feline qualities to best effect in the story of a girl who obsesses about an ancient Balkan curse turning her into a panther. The film was stylish and subtle, creating imagined rather than actual menace. Simone's performance was commensurate with perfectly studied cat-like mannerisms. During the production of 'Cat People', Simone was under FBI surveillance because of her relationship with MI5 spy Dusko Popov. She made two further, less successful, films at RKO, then returned to France for good. Simone made several films there and worked on the stage. In spite of many affairs and relationships, she never married."
