        "text": "Updates (Version October 2021)\n\nLetters\n\nLetter 66, n. 1 changed to:\n\nGeorge Eliot’s novel Felix Holt, the radical (1866) tells the love story of Felix Holt and Esther Lyon, which ends in their marriage. It ‘is a study in the Radicalism of the time of the Reform Bill, contrasting the ideal radicalism of Felix Holt, who, with talent which might command material success, prefers to spend himself in social service, and the political radicalism of the good business man, Harold Transome, who breaks away from the Tory traditions of his family’. See I.G. Mudge and M.E. Sears, A George Eliot dictionary. The characters and scenes of the novels, stories and poems alphabetically arranged. London 1924, p. xxii. Van Gogh’s parents also read the book (FR b954, b2234).\n\nLetter 114, n. 8, after ‘Godsdienstoefening in eene dorpskerk (Divine service in a village church) by Adolf Carel Nunnink, in Kunstkronijk 3 (1862), NS, no. 15’:\n\nAlso included in a scrapbook from the estate (Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, t*1487, 36). Ill. 1818.\n\nLetter 133, note 2, added at the end of the note:\n\nVincent’s second poetry album for Theo (1875, see letter 29, n. 2) also contains seven fragments from Carlyle’s works, one of them (the sixth quotation) from Carlyle’s The French Revolution. However, when Van Gogh copied these fragments in English, he most probably copied them from Taine’s Histoire de la littérature anglaise, vol. 5, Les contemporains. In fact, Van Gogh’s choice (cuts and ellipses) coincides with Taine’s choice in all fragments, quoted in English in Taine’s footnotes. See Guzzoni 2020, p. 214 (n. 18), and Pabst 1988, p. 25.\n\nLetter 135, note 18:\n\n‘Leidsestraat 28’ changed to ‘Keizersgracht 453’.\n\nLetter 151, n. 2 changed to:\n\nCharbonnage de Marcasse/Saint-Antoine (Escouffiaux no. 7) d’Hornu-Petit-Wasmes. For an illustration of this mine, see Eeckaut 1990, ‘Annexes’, p. 16. This was the second time that Van Gogh went down a mine, as indicated by ‘700 metres deep this time’ later on in the letter. He had written in January to his father about his first descent in a mine, 635 metres deep; see letter 150, n. 2.\n\nLetter 178, translation:\n\n‘those like you and I’ changed to ‘those like you and me’.\n\nLetter 193, note added:\n\n25. Taken from the poem ‘Onvermoeid’ (Tireless) by P.A. de Génestet: see letter 179, n. 4.\n\nLetter 193, n. 26:\n\nThis utterance is quoted again in letter 458, where the word ‘énergique’ has been added.\n\nLetter 234, n. 16:\n\n‘Ernest Philippe Boetzel (1830-c. 1920)’ changed to ‘Ernest Philippe Boetzel (1830-1913)’\n\nLetter 286, n. 3 changed to:\n\nThese are studies like ‘Worn out’ (F 997 / JH 267) and (the compositionally different) Sorrowful old man (F 998 / JH 269). It is clear from letter 287, however, that Van Gogh worked with two different models, one of them Adrianus Zuyderland, and only the study of him survived: Study for ‘Worn out’ (F - / JH -), see Meedendorp 2021.\n\nLetter 287, n. 6 changed to:\n\nTwo drawings connected to the lithograph ‘At eternity’s gate’ (F 1662 / JH 268) are known: ‘Worn out’ (F 997 / JH 267), which was the immediate model for the lithograph, and Study for ‘Worn out’ (F - / JH -). The study with the other model remains unknown, see also letter 286, n. 3. The compositionally different Sorrowful old man (F 998 / JH 269) was probably made somewhat later, see Otterlo 2007, pp. 172-4.\n\nLetter 292, translation:\n\n‘Young corn’ changed to ‘Young wheat’.\n\nLetter 325, n. 4, added:\n\nVan Gogh mentions Leech, Cruikshank and Barnard in sequence. This suggests that he had in mind the illustrators of Dickens’s work; see Guzzoni 2020, p. 213, n. 15. Van Gogh’s conclusive comment ‘Leech, though, is strong with street urchins’ probably refers to the illustrations that Leech created for the first edition of The Haunted Man and the Ghost’s Bargain, which comprises four striking scenes with boys (London 1848, pp. 48, 68, 130, 145).\n\nLetter 387, n. 3 changed to:\n\nTralbaut thought that it was the cemetery of the village of Pesse, to the north of the Dutch Reformed Church (Tralbaut 1959); this was accepted by later researchers, in part on the basis of the church spire. Metselaar, on the other hand, believed that it was the churchyard in Hollandscheveld, a hamlet near Hoogeveen. See Metselaar 2000, and (also for the debate) Dijk and Van der Sluis 2001, pp. 119-122. New research has revealed that it was indeed the cemetery of Pesse, see Annemiek Rens et al., ‘In de Drentse voetsporen van Van Gogh’, Waardeel. Drents historisch tijdschrift, 40-4 (2020), pp. 22-31.\n\nLetter 511, n. 2, added:\n\n‘Joseph van der Harten (1852-1925)’ changed to ‘Johannes Renier Joseph van der Harten (1852-1925)’\n\nCf. Jack van Hoek, ‘Over een kerkuil en een kalong’, Drijehornickels 29-3 (2020), pp. 33-36.\n\nLetter 547, n. 2:\n\n‘Head of a prostitute (F 206 / JH 972)’ changed to ‘Head of a woman’ (F 206 / JH 972). Also in letter 550 n4.\n\nLetter 550, n. 3:\n\n‘Portrait of a prostitute (F 207a / JH 1204)’ changed to ‘Portrait of a woman (F 207a / JH 1204)’.\n\nLetter 583, n. 8:\n\n‘We do not know which of the two was an amateur artist’ changed to ‘The one who visited Van Gogh must have been Giraud.’\n\nLetter 594, n. 2, changed to:\n\n… the sizes of the paintings he had made up to this point are 25 (F 555 / JH 1380 and F 403 / JH 1378), 20 (F 394 / JH 1379 ) and 15 (F 553 / JH 1387 and F 556 / JH 1383), and F405 is half the size of a no. 30 canvas. Van Gogh wasn’t always accurate when it came to giving canvas sizes; in letters 611 and 620 he called a 25 ‘figure’ canvas a size 30. ‘The pink peach trees’ is the painting Pink peach trees (‘Souvenir de Mauve’) (F 394 / JH 1379).\n\nLetter 595, n. 5:\n\n‘Pink peach trees (F 404 / JH 1391)’ changed to ‘The pink peach tree (F 404 / JH 1391)’\n\nLetter 622, Sketches:\n\n‘bordé’ changed to ‘bordée’.\n\nLetter 637, n. 7:\n\n‘Olive trees, Montmajour (F - / JH add. 3)’ changed to Trees, Montmajour (F - / JH add. 3)’. Also in letters 638, n. 3, 639, n. 1, and 640, n. 15.\n\nLetter 649, n. 7, added:\n\nThe print (a heliogravure) is in the Van Gogh estate (Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum). Ill. 2203.\n\nLetter 659, n. 6, added:\n\nA similar composition with thistles in the foreground appears in a colour illustration by Frédéric Montenard, in Daudet’s Tartarin sur les Alpes (Calman Lévy, Paris 1885, p. 321). The caption of the illustration may also have inspired Van Gogh: ‘That lovely Tarascon road, all white and dry with dust’ (Cette belle route tarasconnaise, toute blanche et cracquante de poussière). See Guzzoni 2020, pp. 125-127.\n\nLetter 716, Location:\n\nVan Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, inv. no. b9122V2020.\n\nLetter 732, n. 5 changed to:\n\nIn letter 735 Van Gogh reports that this doctor came from Paris, but it is not known to whom he is referring. In any case, it is certain that Albert Delon had studied at the medical university in Paris (below his contributions to L’Homme de Bronze is written ‘ancien interne des hospices de Paris’, the honorary title of graduates of L’Internat des Hôpitaux de Paris). He treated Van Gogh in February 1889. See letter 747, n. 1. Dr Auriol, who had also been trained in Paris, also worked at the hospital as a surgeon (ACA).\n\nLetter 767, n. 1:\n\n‘Sunflowers in a vase (F 458 / JH 1667)’ changed to ‘Sunflowers in a vase (F 457 / JH 1666)’.\n\n‘F 457 / JH 1666’ changed to ‘F 458 / JH 1667’.\n\nLetter 780, n. 1 changed to:\n\nOlive trees (F 715 / JH 1759). See exhib. cat. Dallas 2021, pp. 85, 90 (n. 2).\n\nLetter 782, n. 7 changed to:\n\nThis was Olive trees with the Alpilles in the background (F 712 / JH 1740), which Van Gogh later mentions with F 612 (see letter 805).\n\nLetter 783, n. 2, last paragraph changed to:\n\nThe twelfth canvas could be Olive trees (F 715 / JH 1759) or Green wheatfield with rising sun (F 720 / JH 1728).\n\nLetter 789, n. 13 changed to:\n\nThis was presumably Olive trees (F 714 / JH 1858), measuring 51.1 x 65.4 cm (no. 15 canvas). Specifying that the first two works are ‘no. 30 canvases’ implies that the others are smaller, so he cannot be referring to the three olive groves on no. 30 canvases (F 585, F 712 and F 715).\n\nLetter 804, n. 9 changed to:\n\nLoti gives a detailed description of the boudoir of the Romanian queen. Commenting on Delacroix’s painting, Loti said: ‘When she was seated at her work, I could see, from the spot she had indicated to me on the first day, and which it was my habit to resume, her face and her veil standing out in front of a large, superb canvas by Delacroix: the entombment of Christ.’ (Lorsqu’elle était assise à travailler, de la place qu’elle m’avait indiquée le premier jour et que j’avais coutume de reprendre, je voyais son visage et son voile se détacher en avant d’une grande et superbe toile de Delacroix: la mise au tombeau du Christ.) This was in fact a copy of Delacroix’s The lamentation, 1844 (Saint-Denis du Saint-Sacrement, Paris). Van Gogh must have misidentified this painting as the Pietà he was interested in. See Johnson 1981-1989, vol. 5, p. 80, n. 1.\n\nLetter 805, n. 23 changed to:\n\nThis was either Olive trees (F 715 / JH 1759) or Olive grove (F 585 / JH 1758). Whichever painting remained was included in the next consignment, which also contained an olive grove (see letter 806). See exhib. cat. Dallas 2021, pp. 88, 91 (n. 17).\n\nLetter 806, n. 8 changed to:\n\nOlive trees (F 715 / JH 1759) or Olive grove (F 585 / JH 1758). See letter 805, n. 23.\n\nLetter 806, note added:\n\n21. Van Gogh’s description of the trees and the soil corresponds quite closely with the ones in Olive grove (F 711 / JH 1791). That must have been the painting he was working on, and the smaller, more sketchy Olive grove (F 709 / JH 1760) probably shortly preceded it. See exhib. cat. Dallas 2021, pp. 109, 115.\n\nLetter 822, n. 16 changed to:\n\nA little later in the letter Van Gogh says that he has five no. 30 canvases of olive groves. These were Olive trees (F 710 / JH 1856), Olive grove (F 707 / JH 1857), Olive trees (F 708 / JH 1855), Olive grove (F 586 / JH 1854) and Women picking olives (F 654 / JH 1868). See exhib. cat. Dallas 2021, p. 132 (n 8).\n\nLetter 823, n. 6 changed to:\n\nThese five no. 30 canvases of olive groves are Olive trees (F 710 / JH 1856), Olive grove (F 707 / JH 1857), Olive trees (F 708 / JH 1855), Olive grove (F 586 / JH 1854) and Women picking olives (F 654 / JH 1868). See exhib. cat. Dallas 2021, p. 132 (n. 8).\n\nLetter 824, n. 7 changed to:\n\nIt is unclear which painting this refers to. Orchard in blossom at the foot of the Alpilles (F 723 / JH 1722), the only work with blossoming orchards from Saint-Rémy, dates from January-February 1890. It is unlikely that Van Gogh is referring to an olive grove, as Pickvance assumed in exh. cat. New York 1986 (p. 301), since in that case Van Gogh would have written ‘verger d’oliviers’. He could not be referring to the studies of blossoming orchards made in Arles in 1888, because he had already sent them to Theo (see letter 606). He had also sent the paintings of blossoming orchards made in Arles in 1889 (see letters 789 and 805).\n\nLetter 827, n. 12, first sentence changed to:\n\nThe twelve large canvases included the five paintings mentioned in letter 823 – Olive trees (F 710 / JH 1856), Olive grove (F 707 / JH 1857), Olive trees (F 708 / JH 1855), Olive grove (F 586 / JH 1854) and Women picking olives (F 654 / JH 1868).\n\nLetter 834, n. 13:\n\n‘Olive pickers (F 587 / JH 1853)’ changed to ‘Olive grove with two olive pickers (F 587 / JH 1853)’.\n\nLetter 853, Location:\n\nAmsterdam, Van Gogh Museum (gift of Mr. and Mrs. Cheung Chung Kiu), inv. no. b9119 S/2019\n\nLetter 879, n. 7:\n\n‘buttercups’ changed to ‘turban buttercups’.\n\nLetter 879, n. 15 changed to:\n\nPierre Puvis de Chavannes, Inter Artes et Naturam (Between art and nature), 1890 (Musée de Rouen). Ill. 316. A smaller version is now in the Metropolitan Museum in New York. Van Gogh had seen the large painting at the exhibition of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts. See exhib. cat. Paris 1890-4, p. xxii, no. 718, and RM21. Van Gogh made the letter sketch (F - / JH -) from memory.\n\nLetter 889, n. 8:\n\nWild flowers in a vase (F 763 / JH 2030): ‘oil on canvas’ changed to ‘oil on torchon’\n\nLetter 894, n. 9:\n\nCamille Corot, Souvenir of Nemi. Rocks and shrubs: ‘1844-1845’ changed to ‘1844’.\n\nLetter RM16:\n\n‘[x] [la nuit étoilée [?]]’ changed to ‘5 [la nuit étoilée [?]]’.\n\nLetter RM16, translation:\n\n‘[x] [the starry night [?]]’ changed to ‘5 [the starry night [?]]’.\n\nLetter RM20, n. 9 changed to:\n\nThese were the eight paintings that Van Gogh had made in Saint-Rémy in May 1890 after his last period of illness: Irises in a vase, (F 678 / JH 1977), Irises in a vase (F 680 / JH 1978), Roses in a vase (F 681 / JH 1976), Roses in a vase (F 682 / JH 1979), The garden of the asylum with dandelions and tree-trunks (F 676 / JH 1970), Meadow in the garden of the asylum (F 672 / JH 1975) and Road with a cypress and star (F 683 / JH 1982).\n\nLetter RM21, n.4 changed to:\n\nHere Van Gogh is probably thinking of Olive trees (F 715 / JH 1759) and Olive grove (F 585 / JH 1758), see letter 805, n. 23.\n\nLetter RM23, note added:\n\n5. Van Gogh's paintings of olive trees that were at Theo's, see letters 823, 834, and 863.\n\nLetter RM25, Additional:\n\n‘that horrible day’ changed to ‘the day of the accident’.\n\nBiographical & historical context\n\nn. 9 changed to:\n\nFR b980, Mrs Van Gogh to Theo, 7 June 1878.\n\nCorrespondents\n\n4.2 Lost correspondence:\n\nTersteeg’s son Johan (Johan Tersteeg, 1873-1953).\n\nCredit lines\n\nStill life with coffee pot (F 410 / JH 1426): Lausanne, Collection Goulandris’ changed to ‘Athens, Basil & Elise Goulandris Foundation’\n\nBibliography\n\nExhib. cat.

He was aged 21 rather than 23, as Vincent assumed.\n\nLetter 76, n. 8:\n\n‘William Port Stokes (c. 1832-1890)’ changed to: ‘William Port Stokes (1833-1890)’ ‘Lydia Ann Stokes-Blyth (before 1835-1878)’ changed to: ‘Lydia Ann Stokes-Blyth (1834-1878)’\n\nLetter 84, n. 9 changed to: Three photographs of paintings by Paul Delaroche, Good Friday, Mater Dolorosa and Gethsemane; see letter 54, n. 14.\n\nLetter 151, n. 5: ‘Coal mine in the Borinage (F 1040 / JH 100)’ changed to: ‘Cokes factory in the Borinage (F 1040 / JH 100)’\n\nLetter 168, n. 2 and 3:\n\n‘Utrecht, Centraal Museum’ changed to: ‘Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum’\n\nLetter 235, n. 21 changed to: In the estate there are three prints by George Henry Boughton: Verregnet, Genrebild aus der Bretagne (Rain-soaked, genre scene from Brittany) from Über Land und Meer (t*822); The poisoned cup from The Graphic 9 (20 June 1874), p. 600 (t*494); and an untitled engraving (t*1487), whose source is unknown.\n\nLetter 273, n. 14:\n\n‘Horace Harral (fl. 1844-1891)’ changed to: ‘Horace Harral (1817-1905)’\n\nLetter 275, n. 51: They appeared in L’Univers Illustré 24 (18 June 1881)’ changed to: ‘They appeared in L’Univers Illustré 24 (18 June 1881), p. 388 (t*449) and 24 (10 September 1881), p. 628 (t*216)’\n\nLetter 293, n. 13:\n\n‘Godefroy Durand (1832-1920)’ changed to: Godefroy Durand (1832-1896)’\n\nLetter 359, n. 23:\n\n‘Alfred William Hunt (1830-1896)’ changed to: ‘Alfred Hunt (active 1860-1884)’\n\nLetter 398, n. 10: Man burning weeds changed to: Peasant burning weeds\n\nLetter 405, n. 3: ‘The figure he describes is probably the third figure from the left, standing against a rock’ changed to: ‘The figure he describes is probably the man with the helmet and sharp profile, sitting on a rock’\n\nLetter 574, n. 15: ‘he suspected that one of her cousins, Anthonius van Rooij or Francis van Rooij, was the father’ changed to: ‘he suspected that one of her cousins was the father’\n\nLetter 578, n. 3:\n\n‘In the spring of 1887, following his stay with the brothers in rue Lepic (see n. 6 below), the Scottish art dealer Alexander Reid, a friend of Theo and Vincent in Paris’ changed to: ‘In the spring of 1887, the Scottish art dealer Alexander Reid, a friend of Theo and Vincent in Paris’\n\nLetter 578, n. 6 changed to:\n\nThe Van Gogh brothers befriended Reid in February 1887. See Fowle 2010, p. 31, and cf. also n. 3 above.\n\nLetter 580, n. 10 changed to:\n\nIt is not known which new study this was. Previously it was thought to be Bowl of potatoes (F 386 / JH 1365), but that painting dates from early 1889; see Van Tilborgh et al. 2012, pp. 112, 119.\n\nLetter 583, n 4: ‘a study, possibly Bowl of Potatoes (F 386 / JH 1365) (see letter 580)’ changed to: ‘an unidentified study (see letter 580)’. Also in letter 585 n.4, and letter 606, n. 4.\n\nLetter 618, location:\n\nPrivate collection\n\nLetter 635, translation: ‘fire in our bellies’ changed to: ‘fire in our bones’\n\nLetter 635, note added: 9. Jer. 20:9.\n\nLetter 679, n. 1:\n\n‘The letter to Gauguin’ changed to: ‘The letter from Gauguin’\n\nLetter 765, n. 32 changed to:\n\nVan Gogh no doubt found Sunflowers in a vase (F 455 / JH 1668) and F 457 / JH 1666 ‘worthy of being put on stretching frames’ (l. 158). The first two versions, F 456 / JH 1561 and F 454 / JH 1562, were indeed in the consignment but cannot be the paintings in question because they were already framed with strips of wood and thus already on stretching frames (see letter 776). Sunflowers in a vase (F 458 / JH 1667) must have been sent on a stretching frame too; Van Gogh had enlarged the composition by adding a strip of wood to the canvas (see Hendriks et al. 2019). This means that the painting could not be taken off the stretching frame anymore. The consignment probably also included F 453 / JH 1559 and F 459 / JH 1560; see letter 774, n. 7.\n\nLetter 784, n. 1 changed to:\n\nVincent’s reply to his mother’s letter is letter 788. Mrs van Gogh had addressed her letter ‘to the Hospital at Arles’, as she said in a letter she wrote to Theo and Jo on 29 April 1889: ‘I hope he received it and am greatly longing to hear something from him.

The brothel was on the corner of rue des Glacières and rue du Bout d'Arles. Police officer Alphonse Robert later recalled that the girl worked under the name of Gaby (Doiteau and Leroy 1939, p. 6).

Van Gogh cited the title of this book in letter 129, see letter 129, n. 24.\n\nLetter 148, n. 25 changed to:\n\nThe first line of this quotation seems to have been taken from Emmanuel Soudan, Petite description géographique du globe, au point de vue belge, Ghent 1854, p. 28. Most of the fragment was copied almost literally from Adolphe Siret, Récits historiques Belges, Brussels 1855, pp. 217-218. See Bart Moens, ‘Van Gogh in Brussels: a little-known but decisive stage in his early development as an artist’. In exhib. cat. Mons 2015, p. 117, n. 11 and 12. It was also cited in A. Anthelme Fritz, Esquisse d’une nouvelle Géographie de la Belgique..., Deuxième édition, Brussels 1860, pp. 45, 49-50; and in A. Anthelme Fritz, La Belgique physique, politique, industrielle et commerciale..., Brussels 1864, pp. 45, 49-50. With thanks to Dominique Guillet.\n\nLetter 153, n. 4, added at the end of the note:\n\nThe family lived at Rue de l’Activité (Werkzaamheidstraat) 24, Sint-Lambrechts Woluwe (SAB, municipal register, 1876 - U fol. 47).\n\nLetter 157, n. 23 changed to:\n\nVan Gogh’s mention of Reapers binding sheaves probably refers to a reproduction of Jean-François Millet’s pastel Buckwheat harvest, 1868-70 (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts). Ill. 3112. This was published as an engraving in the Gazette des Beaux-Arts of 1 May 1875, p. 438. See exhib. cat. Boston 1984, p. 210, cat. no. 142.\n\nLetter 162, n. 12 changed to:\n\nThis postscript seems to be a reaction to a remark made by Theo, who had become acquainted with Victor Horta through a colleague at Goupil’s. The colleague was probably Tobias Schmidt, whom Vincent had visited the previous October (letter 159). Horta, who later gained...\n\nLetter 211. n. 12 changed to:\n\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, paintings by Dutch artists destined for the annual Salon in Paris were exhibited for a few days in the Logezaal hall on Fluweelen Burgwal before being sent to Paris. This was probably arranged by Pulchri Studio, possibly in collaboration with Goupil & Cie. See, for example, Algemeen Handelsblad, 6 March 1876, 3 and 7 March 1880, and 15 March 1882.\n\nLetter 246, n. 6 changed to:\n\nThe windmill De Laakmolen near The Hague (F 844) and View of The Hague from the northeast (F 916). By ‘experiment’ Van Gogh very probably meant the works on Harding paper, which he discusses further on in the letter (l. 178-179). The windmill De Laakmolen near The Hague is on Harding paper.\n\nLetter 280, n. 19:\n\n‘The series was reissued in 1859’ changed to: ‘The series was reissued in 1853 and in 1859’\n\nLetter 280, n. 24 changed to:\n\nJean-François Millet’s The gleaners, 1857 (Paris, Musée d’Orsay). Ill. 1891. This was published as an engraving and photogravure in the Musée Goupil series: Les glaneuses (NB 90.I.2.2275 and 95.I.2.611); an aquatint by Alphonse Masson, titled Gleaning in Belgium, appeared in The Art Journal 14 (NS, 1875), facing p. 188.\n\nLetter 354, n. 12, added at the end of the note:\n\nThe type of pencil Van Gogh is referring to is known as a Försterstift in German (forester’s pencil). It is a thick pencil sturdy enough to mark wet wood. Although there are no known drawings from the Hague period that were made with this kind of pencil, it may have been used for letter 362 and the associated sketch, F - / JH 380, as well as for the Drenthe drawing, Ploughman and three women (F 1096r / JH 411). See Van Gogh's studio practice, ed. Marije Vellekoop et al., Brussels 2013, pp. 392, 405.\n\nLetter 381, n. 1 changed to:\n\nLandscape with leaning trees (F 196 / JH 957).\n\nLetter 381, n. 2 changed to:\n\nFarm in Loosduinen near The Hague (F 16 / JH 391).\n\nLetter 477, n. 4:\n\n‘based on a fairy tale by Grimm’ changed to: ‘inspired by Swedish folklore’\n\nLetter 535, n. 1, added at the end of the note:\n\nThe consignment probably also contained a still life with potatoes, which Van Gogh overpainted with a flower still life in Paris, Still life with gladioli (F 248 / JH 1146).\n\nLetter 577, n. 2:\n\n‘Arles had a population of about 23,500 in 1888’ changed to: ‘The commune of Arles, including the surrounding villages, had 23,500 inhabitants in 1888 (ACA). The town itself had a population of about 13,300 in 1888. See Murphy 2016, pp. 38, 265 (n. 10).’\n\nLetter 577, n. 3 changed to:\n\nVan Gogh took the express train from Paris to Marseille (the ‘Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée’) that left at 9.40 pm on Sunday 19 February and arrived in Arles at 4.49 pm the following day. The train passed through Tarascon, a small town about 20 km to the north of Arles. See Murphy 2016, pp. 25, 36, 263 (n. 33), 264 (n. 3).\n\nLetter 577, n. 5 changed to:\n\nVan Gogh wrote that the antique dealer had his premises ‘in this very street’; however the address books do not record any in rue Amédée-Pichot or rue de la Cavalerie. The closest antique dealer was Berthet, 5 rue de la Sous-Préfecture, just off rue Amédée-Pichot.\n\nLetter 585, n. 8:\n\n‘stabbed to death … The investigation of the crime…’ changed to: ‘stabbed to death when leaving a brothel in rue des Récollets after a row with three Italian labourers. This brothel, the 'maison de tolérance' no. 14 on the corner of the rue du Bout d’Arles and rue des Récollets, must have been the one that Van Gogh visited. See Murphy 2016, pp. 60-61, 270 n. 8. The investigation of the crime...’\n\nLetter 595, n. 4 changed to:\n\nThe painting intended for Tersteeg was The Langlois bridge with washerwomen (F 397 / JH 1368); the repetition of this is The Langlois bridge with washerwomen (F 571 / JH 1392). The name Pont de l'Anglais was often used at the time, although the bridge was later usually known as Pont de Langlois. See Martin Bailey, Studio of the South. Van Gogh in Provence. London 2016, pp. 73, 202 (n. 2).\n\nLetter 602, n. 19 changed to:\n\nThe Service du cadastre (land register) in Arles lists one Aimé Verdier, ‘propriétaire à Milhaud (Gard)’ as the owner of lot numbers 398 and 399 from 1858 to 1910. The ‘Maison Verdier' was all of 2, place Lamartine as well as the large building behind. When Van Gogh lived at 2 place Lamartine, it was no longer owned by Aimé Verdier, who had died in 1872. The house had passed on to his daughter, Marie Louise Verdier, and her husband, Raymond Triare-Brun. See Murphy 2016, p. 273 (n. 13).\n\nThe left-hand side of place Lamartine 2 was occupied by the grocer’s shop run by François Damase Crevoulin and his wife Marguerite Favier; the right-hand side was the accommodation rented by Van Gogh. In the summons of February 1889, Soulè is described as ‘landlord, of 53 avenue Montmajour ... managing agent of the house occupied by Mr Vincent van Gogh’ (see Documentation, 27 February 1889). The land register records only one building in his name: 53 avenue de Montmajour (lot number 373), diagonally opposite the Yellow House, in the block where the police station was also located. Soulè was therefore not the owner of the Yellow House but the agent who collected the rent on behalf of Mme Verdier.\n\nLetter 603, n. 5 changed to:\n\nIn the estate there are various photographs of Willemien at about 20 years old; Van Gogh may have had one of these portraits in mind. Ill. 2183 and Ill. 3113. It is difficult to say how old she is in these photographs, but judging by Van Gogh’s remark the second is the most likely. Later Willemien actually did go mad; she died in an asylum in 1941.\n\nLetter 621, original text and translation:\n\n‘Rue Coëllogon’ changed to : ‘Rue Coëtlogon’\n\nLetter 638, n. 17 changed to:\n\nThe cleaning woman was Thérèse Balmoissière. See Murphy 2016, p. 94. Van Gogh paid her 20 francs a month (see letter 736). See also letter 747, n. 1.\n\nLetter 657, translation:\n\n‘I’ve worked on another figure of a Zouave’ changed to: I’ve worked again on a figure of a Zouave’\n\nLetter 663, n. 1, added at the beginning of the note:\n\nPatience Escalier has not been identified. Perhaps ‘Patience’ was a nickname; in that case a man called François Casimir Escalier (1816-1889) from the nearby village of Eyragues may have been Van Gogh's model (Murphy 2016, p. 98).\n\nLetter 677, n. 12 changed to: Thérèse Balmoissière (see letter 638, n. 17). In 1888 Thérèse was 49 years old, had eight children and numerous grandchildren.\n\nLetter 691, translation:\n\n‘the fields are mauve’ changed to: ‘the areas of land are mauve’\n\nLetter 705, translation:\n\n‘bedspread’ changed to: ‘blanket’\n\nLetter 706, translation:\n\n‘bedspread’ changed to: ‘blanket’\n\nLetter 712, n. 2 changed to:\n\nGauguin arrived at four in the morning on Tuesday, 23 October. It had taken him from Sunday afternoon until Tuesday morning to get from Pont-Aven to Arles, as he told Schuffenecker on 25 October 1888. See Merlhès 1989, pp. 124-127. For the route he took see Correspondance Gauguin 1984, p. 510 (n. 294), exhib. cat. Chicago 2001, p. 54 (fig. 5), and Murphy 2016, p. 281 (n. 1).\n\nLetter 736, n. 5: ‘Theo handwriting … New Year’ changed to: ‘His handwriting is recognizable, and the number ‘67’ in the postmark refers to place des Abbesses (office 67), the address of the post office where the letter was franked. There are also two postage stamps, one yellowish green, the other blue. They are probably one of 15 centimes, which was the normal rate for a letter, and one of 25 centimes, which was the extra postage for a registered letter. In the top left corner of the envelope there is a capital letter in a rectangle, probably R for Recommandée (Registered), so it is likely that this was the envelope containing Theo's letter and the 100 franc note that Vincent received on 23 December.’\n\nLetter 745, translation:\n\n‘a little music of local colour’ changed to: ‘a little music of colour from here’\n\nLetter 745, n. 18:\n\nThe ‘Chronique locale’ in Le Forum Républicain of Sunday, 30 December 1888 reported that in the night of 23 December Van Gogh had offered his severed ear to ‘a certain Rachel’ (la nommée Rachel) at ‘brothel No. 1’ (maison de tolérance No. 1) in rue du Bout d’Arles. The brothel was on the corner of rue des Glacières and rue du Bout d'Arles. Police officer Alphonse Robert later recalled that the girl worked under the name of Gaby (Doiteau and Leroy 1939, p. 6). In fact her name was Gabrielle; see Murphy 2016, pp. 66-69, 217-227.\n\nLetter 745, n. 19:\n\n‘Van Gogh most likely means that he should consult … recommended by Raspail, namely home medication’ changed to: ‘Van Gogh most likely means: just like Ricord cures venereal disease, Raspail will be able to give me the best advice, namely home medication.’\n\nLetter 749, n. 4:\n\n‘Salles’s letters to Theo of 2 and 18 March have been preserved (FR b1051 and FR b1049)’ changed to: ‘Salles’s letters to Theo of 1, 2 and 18 March have been preserved (FR b1048, b1051 and b1049).’\n\nLetter 761, translation :\n\n‘It will perhaps turn out all right in the end.’ changed to: ‘It may return in the long run.’\n\nLetter 800, n. 3 changed to:\n\nThis must refer to the repetition, The bedroom (F 484 / JH 1771), which exhibits substantial areas of paint loss that accord with what Van Gogh describes. See Inge Fiedler et al., ‘Material, intention, and evolution’, in exhib. cat. Van Gogh’s bedrooms. Chicago (The Art Institute of Chicago), 2016, p. 94.\n\nLetter 804, n. 18 changed to:\n\nGuillaumin exhibited his Self-portrait with palette in 1880 at the fifth exhibition of the Impressionists (no. 72, Portrait de M.G.). Portrait of a young woman was shown at the eighth and last exhibition, in 1886 (no. 65, Portrait). See Ruth Berson, The new painting. Impressionism 1874-1886. Documentation. Volume II. Exhibited Works. San Francisco 1996, pp. 150, 244.\n\nLetter 896, n. 9 changed to:\n\nThat is a Paris address. When he was in Auvers Walpole Brooke stayed at Hotel-restaurant du Cadran in rue Victor Hugo, which is the address scribbled on a calling card of his in the family estate: ‘Holet [i.e. Hotel] du Cadran / Auvers-sur-Oise’ (FR b9063).\n\nLetter RM09:\n\n‘weefsel’ changed to: ‘welfsel’\n\n‘Maar toonloos’ changed to: ‘Naar, toonloos’\n\nLetter RM09, translation:\n\n‘Drapery looming’ changed to: ‘Looming vault’\n\n‘His burial was just as drab’ changed to: ‘His burial was as grim and drab’\n\nLetter RM09, n. 1 changed to:\n\nNine of the quotations copied out on these sheets are translations by Bernhard van Meurs of poems by Ludwig Uhland. They are included in Het leven van Ludwig van Uhland en vertalingen uit zijn dichtbundel, Nijmegen 1877. (Abbreviated below as Van Meurs 1877). There are several textual discrepancies, mostly small ones, and differences in punctuation. Those variants may indicate that Van Gogh used a slightly earlier edition. He occasionally omitted lines or stanzas. The first poem is ‘Het Orgel’ (Van Gogh used the title ‘Avondzang’). Van Meurs 1877, p. 130. Van Gogh quoted the German version in two of his poetry albums. See Pabst 1988, pp. 34 and 45. The source text has ‘Mijn hart’ (My heart) in line 4.\n\nLetter RM09, n. 4 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘De pelgrimstogt’. Van Meurs 1877, pp. 95-98. Translated from Ludwig Uhland. Van Gogh omitted ‘En juublende zangen’ (between lines 53 and 54) from the source text, wrote ‘zijn’ instead of ‘mijn’ (l. 73 and 75), ‘zijgt’ instead of ‘zinkt’ (l. 76), and ‘Zacht’ instead of ‘Zoet’ (l. 104). The poem was also published in De Katholiek. Godsdienstig-, geschiedkundig en letterkundig Maandschrift 69, Nieuwe reeks, derde deel, Leiden 1876, pp. 124-127. Van Gogh quoted five stanzas from the German version (‘Der Pilger’) in one of his poetry albums. See Pabst 1988, p. 42.\n\nLetter RM09, n. 5 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘Een geluk in de kindsheid’. Van Meurs 1877, p. 152. Translated from Ludwig Uhland.\n\nLetter RM09, n. 6 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘Lied van een gevangene’. Van Meurs 1877, p. 150. Translated from Ludwig Uhland. Van Gogh quoted only the first of the two stanzas.\n\nLetter RM09, n. 7 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘De koning op het torenplat’. Van Meurs 1877, pp. 141-142. Translated from Ludwig Uhland. The source text has ‘ook’ instead of ‘steeds’ (l. 160).\n\nLetter RM09, n. 8 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘Een wintermorgen’. Van Meurs 1877, pp. 151-152. Translated from Ludwig Uhland.\n\nLetter RM09, n. 9 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘De leeuweriken’. Van Meurs 1877, p. 157. Translated from Ludwig Uhland. The last two lines in the source text read ‘Eén belust op tierelier / Fladdert in mijn binnenst’ hier!’ (l. 193-194).\n\nLetter RM09, n. 10 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘Het kerkhof in de lente’. Van Meurs 1877, p. 153. Translated from Ludwig Uhland. Van Gogh quotes the first and third stanzas but omits the three lines of the second stanza, probably because of their harsh tone: ‘Ach, ik vrees dat straks de dood / Naar uw vunzen donkren schoot / Een der mijnen weg zal dragen’ (Oh, I fear that death / Will soon take one of mine / To your dark and filthy lap).\n\nLetter RM09, n. 11 changed to:\n\nBernhard van Meurs, ‘Avondwolken’. Van Meurs 1877, p. 164. Translated from Ludwig Uhland.\n\nAbout this edition\n\nSection 4.2.4:\n\nThe translations of colours and pigments have been kept as close as possible to Van Gogh’s wording. For example, ‘vert éméraude’ is translated literally as ‘emerald green’ and ‘vert Véronèse’ as ‘Veronese green’, whereas technically ‘vert Véronèse’ is emerald green (copper acetoarsenite green) and ‘vert éméraude’ is viridian (hydrated chrome oxide green). (For pigment terminology in French and English see Elisabeth West FitzHugh (ed.) Artists' pigments: a handbook of their history and characteristics, Washington (National Gallery of Art) 1997, vol. 3, chapters 8 and 9, and exhib. cat. London 1990.)\n\nGlossary of Materials and Techniques\n\nvert éméraude viridian (hydrated chrome oxide green).

In Loti’s novel Madame Chrysanthème, which Van Gogh was reading at the time (see letters 637 and 639), there are similar illustrations of cicadas. See Loti 1888, pp. 107, 286 and 312.\n\nLetter 639, n. 6 changed to:\n\nThe painting Sunset at Montmajour (F - / JH - ), which he had done two weeks earlier on Montmajour (see letter 636).\n\nLetter 677:\n\nNotes 9 and 10 have been reversed.\n\nLetter 721, n. 15:\n\n‘1880’ changed to: ‘1881’\n\nLetter 776, n. 7:\n\n‘Island fisherman’ changed to: ‘Icelandic fisherman’\n\nLetter 783, n. 5:\n\n‘Parrin’ changed to: ‘Perrin’\n\nLetter 790, n. 7, added at the end of the note:\n\nCf. letter 638, n. 4.\n\nLetter 791, n. 1 changed to:\n\nOn Sunday, 7 July 1889 Van Gogh undertook a supervised journey to Arles (see letters 787 and 789).\n\nLetter 865, n. 3 changed to:\n\nThe estate contains a heliogravure of The raising of Lazarus (Ill. 357), published by Amand-Durand in the series Eaux-fortes et gravures des maîtres anciens, an engraving and a reproduction (Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum, inv. nos. t574, t476 and p991, respectively). The heliogravure is a reproduction of the fifth state of Rembrandt’s etching (B73), which was in the Dutuit Collection in Paris. Van Gogh’s painting The raising of Lazarus (after a detail from an etching by Rembrandt) (F 677 / JH 1672) is based on the heliogravure; cf. the sketch in letter 866.\n\nLetter 873, Date, changed to:\n\nThe letter was most likely written on the day of Van Gogh’s arrival in Auvers. In this letter he tells about his first visit to Gachet and reflects on his stay in Paris. Dr Gachet noted in his diary on 20 May: ‘M. Van Gogh’. See Paul Gachet, Deux amis des impressionnistes: le docteur Gachet et Murer. Paris 1956, p. 106. On 20 May 1890 Jo van Gogh-Bonger made entries in her Household book for ‘railway’ and ‘carriage’ (0.20 en 2.00 francs, respectively). These expenses presumably indicate that Vincent went to the station that day (Wednesday, 21 May contains no entries that could be connected with his departure on that day). See Household book of Mrs Theodorus van Gogh-Bonger, April 1889 - September 1891 (FR b2211). Jo’s brother, Andries Bonger, wrote on 21 May 1890 to his parents: ‘Vincent the painter has already left’ (FR b1852). On the basis of this information, we have dated Van Gogh’s letter to Tuesday, 20 May 1890. Twenty-five years later, however, Jo said that Vincent had left on 21 May (Brieven 1914, p. lxi), though her reasons for saying this are not clear.\n\nLetter 896, n. 9:\n\n‘Edmund Walpole Brooke (?-?), (English?) artist’ changed to: ‘Edmund Walpole Brooke (1865-?), Australian artist’\n\nRM15, note added:\n\n1.

He and the art dealer Daniel Cottier were business partners in London in the years 1874-1882. Their gallery was at 8 Pall Mall. See Heijbroek and Wouthuysen 1999. The windows are located in St Andrew’s Church in Owslebury, near Winchester. They were commissioned by William Carnegie, 8th Earl of Northesk, as a memorial to his wife and daughter, who both died before him. Both women are depicted as the Virgin Mary. In the family scrapbook of the earl’s descendants, Max Donnelly found photographs of the designs that Van Gogh had described. See Max Donnelly, ‘“Such a noble face”: Vincent van Gogh, Daniel Cottier and the Northesk memorials’, Burlington Magazine 153 (2011), pp. 568-571. Ills. 3099-3102.\n\nLetter 93, n. 15 changed to:\n\nHeb. 11:1. The quotation that Van Gogh saw in the original design was replaced with: ‘Fear not, only believe’. See Max Donnelly, ‘“Such a noble face”: Vincent van Gogh, Daniel Cottier and the Northesk memorials’, The Burlington Magazine 153 (2011), p. 571.\n\nLetter 262, Location:\n\nAuction Monte Carlo, 18 July 2012.\n\nLetter 280, n. 7 second paragraph changed to:\n\nThere are several versions of Daumier’s The third-class carriage; see Maison 1968, vol. 1, pp. 141-143, cat. nos. I-165 and I-166. In 1888 and 1890 Theo was to sell two works with this subject (GRI, Goupil Ledgers). Theo had probably seen the version now in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa (Ill. 58); which was sold at auction in Paris on May 8, 1882 (no. 7). The version in the Metropolitan Museum was in a private collection by 1878 and is not known to have been seen publicly until purchased by Durand-Ruel in 1892. See cat. Daumier 1808–1879 (National Gallery of Canada, 1999), no. 270 and https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436095.\n\nLetter 361, translation:\n\n‘the large one in Mesdag’ changed to: ‘Mesdag’s large one’\n\nLetter 500, n. 19 changed to:\n\nMillet’s The church at Gréville, which Van Gogh had seen in the Musée du Luxembourg in 1875; see letter 36, n. 9.\n\nLetter 509, original text:\n\n‘in zijn eigen land’ changed to: ‘in mijn eigen land’\n\n‘buiten mijn eigen land’ changed to: ‘buiten zijn eigen land’\n\nLetter 569, n. 13:\n\n‘Charles Antoine (also known as Antonio Cristobal)’ changed to: ‘Cristóbal de Antonio (1862 or 1870 - ?)’\n\nLetter 636, n. 3 changed to:\n\nSunset at Montmajour (F - / JH -).

See letter 636, n. 3.\n\nLetter 683, n. 29 changed to:\n\n… lessons.’ Quoted in Verzamelde brieven 1973, vol. 3, p. 95. The music teacher was Hein van der Zande (1820-1903), according to Dimmen Gestel in Het Eindhovensch Dagblad, 10 October 1930. Charles Blanc had written …\n\nLetter 716, Location:\n\nPrivate collection.\n\nLetter 716, Source status:\n\nOriginal manuscript.\n\nLetter 716, original text:\n\n‘e[n] train’ changed to: ‘en train’\n\nLetter 736, n. 5:\n\n‘possibly’ changed to ‘probably’.\n\nLetter 774, n. 3 changed to:\n\n… with Theo. From letter 775 it emerges that Joseph Roulin had at least one portrait in his possession, though which of the above-mentioned it was cannot be said with certainty either. It could not have been the large Joseph Roulin (F 432 / JH 1522) that Van Gogh had withheld from the August consignment (see letter 660) because he used that to make three more portraits of Roulin. See cat. Otterlo 2003, p. 267. Roulin may have received this painting later. It came into the possession of Cornelis Hoogendijk, who probably acquired it from Vollard. In 1900 …\n\nLetter 811, n. 9 changed to:\n\nLandscape in the neighbourhood of Saint-Rémy (F 726 / JH 1874). Ill. 3107.\n\nLetter 879, n. 11, added at the end of the note:\n\nHe had sent the painting to Theo on 29 April, see letters 863 and 867.\n\nLetter 891, n. 6 changed to:\n\nProbably Landscape in the neighbourhood of Saint-Rémy (F 726 / JH1874), which measures 33 x 41 cm. Another possibility is F 723 / JH 1722, which measures 37.5 x 30.5 cm.\n\nImages\n\nLetters 246, n. 13 and 594, n. 16:\n\nNew image of Rousseau’s The descent of the cattle in the High Jura mountains (ill. 402).\n\nLetter 280, n. 7:\n\nImage of Honoré Daumier, The Third-class Carriage, c. 1863-1865, National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa (ill. 58).\n\nLetter 691:\n\nNew images of pages 2r:5 and 2v:6.\n\nLetter 716:\n\nNew images of the letter (recto and verso).\n\nLetters 811, n. 9 and 891, n. 6:\n\nImage of Landscape in the neighbourhood of Saint-Rémy (F 726 / JH 1874) (ill. 3107).\n\nLetter 842:\n\nNew images of the letter (recto and verso).\n\nChronology\n\n1886, 1 May-30 June: ‘Visits the Salon, and lists the names of 21 painters who exhibited there in his sketchbook of the period (Amsterdam, Van Gogh Museum).’\n\nPublication history\n\n‘she was also guilty of outright censorship; she expunged from the correspondence all mention of her sister-in-law Anna, with whom she did not get on.’ changed to: ‘she also expunged from the correspondence – probably by mutual agreement – paragraphs about people who were still alive.’\n\nBibliography"
