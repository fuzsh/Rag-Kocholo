        "text": "Nine climbers have been killed in an avalanche near the French Alpine ski resort of Chamonix.\n\nThree of those killed were from the UK, three from Germany, two from Spain and one from Switzerland. Twelve other climbers were reported injured.\n\nLocal authorities deployed rescue teams in helicopters and said it was the deadliest avalanche in recent memory.\n\nPolice said four others believed to have been missing - two Britons and two Spaniards - had now been accounted for.\n\nThe Britons had started out on their climb but turned back, while the Spaniards had chosen a different route, said Emmanuel Vegas, a lieutenant with Chamonix police.\n\nThe alarm was sounded at 05:25 local time (03:25 GMT) by one of the injured on the slopes of Mont Maudit.\n\nThe route is popular with summer tourists heading for the summit of Mont Blanc.\n\nIn all, 28 climbers were roped together in several groups on Thursday morning.\n\nThey are believed to have reached 4,000m (13,120 ft) when the avalanche struck.\n\nChamonix mayor Jean-Louis Verdier told Reuters news agency the avalanche was completely unexpected.\n\n\"We had no more reason than usual to be alarmed,\" he said.\n\n\"It's a steep mountain face. There are big plates of snow where an avalanche can easily occur. But this morning we had no reason to expect an avalanche of this size and such a tragedy.\"\n\nThe French authorities described the avalanche as \"the most deadly\" in recent years.\n\nChamonix-based mountain guide Richard Mansfield described the area as \"very beautiful\", but said that it was avalanche-prone."
