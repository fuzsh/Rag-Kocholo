        "text": "Bio She was a British tennis player. She won the women's doubles title at both the French Championships and Wimbledon in 1956 with her playing partner, Althea Gibson, at her latter success becoming the first British-Jewish player to win a title at Wimbledon.\n\nBuxton was born in Liverpool one of two children born to Harry and Violet (Greenberg) Buxton. Her grandparents on both sides were Jews who had immigrated to England from Russia. She was raised partly in South Africa, where she began playing the game while she spent the war years over there with her mother and brother. Buxton's father owned a successful cinema chain in northwestern England, which allowed her to attend boarding school at Gloddaeth Hall, in Llandudno, North Wales. While there, a coach noticed her tennis ability and urged her to acquire more training.\n\nBuxton began playing tennis at a young age. After spending time undergoing training in London and Los Angeles, in 1954 she earned the British No. 4 ranking. Buxton then reached the 1955 Wimbledon singles quarterfinals and climbed to World No. 9 in the rankings. She played in Wightman Cup competition for the United Kingdom in 1954, 1955 and 1956.\n\nBuxton had her most successful tennis year in 1956. She won the women's doubles title and she also became the first British woman in 17 years to reach the ladies' singles final at Wimbledon, losing to American Shirley Fry. She won the English Indoor and London Grass Court singles championships and the English Hard Court doubles crown (with Darlene Hard). At the French Championships, she reached the singles semifinals and won the women's doubles title with Althea Gibson, who was the first African-American champion. Buxton was ranked World No. 5 by World Tennis Magazine and World No. 6 by Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail.\n\nBuxton also won the women's singles title at the 1953 Maccabiah Games.\n\nAfter suffering a serious hand condition in late 1956 (tenosynovitis), Buxton was forced to retire following the 1957 season at the age of 22.\n\nBuxton was one of the first to be inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in Netanya in 1981. In 2014, she was inducted into the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. In 2015, the Black Tennis Hall of Fame inducted Buxton, honoring her for her doubles partnership and friendship with Althea Gibson as well as her efforts to raise funds for the ailing Gibson near the end of her life. (Gibson lost almost the money she ever earned, and Buxton raised $1m for her.)\n\nBuxton wrote the tennis books Tackle Tennis This Way, Starting Tennis, and Winning Tennis and Doubles Tactics.\n\nBuxton founded the Angela Buxton Tennis Centre in Hampstead Garden Suburb. In later years she divided her time between Altrincham and Florida, where she kept a winter home and regularly attended tournaments and mentored players. She died on August 14, 2020, at the age of 85 at her home in Fort Lauderdale."
