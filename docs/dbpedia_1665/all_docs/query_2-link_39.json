        "text": "Active Female Tennis Players\n\nThe following female tennis players are active and currently playing on the WTA tour.\n\nHowever, keep in mind that some players may be playing on reduced schedules or making fewer appearances due to injury.\n\nSerena Williams\n\nAs one of the greatest tennis players of all time, Serena Williams likely needs no introduction.\n\nSince turning pro in 1995, Serena has dominated the sport and accumulated 39 Grand Slam titles. For 319 weeks throughout her career, she’s held the No. 1 ranking and has four Olympic Gold medals, 1 in singles and 3 in doubles.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country United States Birthday September 26, 1981 Grand Slam Titles 23 singles / 14 doubles Career Titles 73 singles / 23 doubles Olympic Medals Gold singles / Gold x3 doubles Instagram @serenawilliams / 13.9m followers\n\nVenus Williams\n\nAlthough Venus never reached the same level of accomplishment as her younger sister, Serena, her achievements are substantial, and she’s left an enormous impact on the game and is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable names in our sport.\n\nDuring her career, she’s amassed 21 Grand Slam titles, reached world No. 1, and won four Gold medals at the Olympics.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country United States Birthday June 17, 1980 Grand Slam Titles 7 singles / 14 doubles Career Titles 49 singles / 22 doubles Olympic Medals Gold singles / Gold x3 doubles Instagram @venuswilliams / 1.4m followers\n\nNaomi Osaka\n\nAlthough Naomi Osaka only has seven titles to her name, four are Grand Slam victories. Based on her success and worldwide appeal, Naomi has received lucrative endorsement deals resulting in her becoming the highest-paid female athlete in 2021.\n\nHowever, beyond her success on the court, Naomi has earned recognition as an activist, showcasing support for the Black Lives Matter movement, and in 2021 she became the first tennis player to light the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nWithout a doubt, Naomi Osaka is one of the most recognizable names in tennis and female sports more broadly.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country Japan Birthday October 16, 1997 Grand Slam Titles 4 singles Career Titles 7 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @naomiosaka / 2.8m followers\n\nSimona Halep\n\nIf there’s one word that comes to mind when I think of Simona Halep, it’s consistency.\n\nDespite not having accumulated massive results in Grand Slam tournaments or the Olympics, she did win the French Open and Wimbledon.\n\nFurthermore, she’s owned the world’s No. 1 ranking for a total of 64 weeks during her career and is the first Romanian ever to do so.\n\nBeyond her results on the court, Simona is well-liked among her peers and fans, having won the WTA Most Popular Player of the Year twice and WTA Fan Favorite Singles Player of the Year three times.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country Romania Birthday September 27, 1991 Grand Slam Titles 2 singles Career Titles 22 singles / 1 doubles Olympic Medals – Instagram @simonahalep / 1.6m followers\n\nVictoria Azarenka\n\nIn 2012, Victoria Azarenka became the first Belarusian player to win a Grand Slam singles title, which she defended in 2013 for her second and helped elevate her name worldwide.\n\nBeyond that, Vika made it to the US Open finals three times and became world No. 1 on January 30, 2012, which she’s held for a total of 51 weeks throughout her career.\n\nCombined with lucrative endorsements from a range of high-profile companies, including Nike, Red Bull, and American Express, to name a few, Victoria Azarenka is undoubtedly one of the most famous female tennis players in the world.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country Belarus Birthday July 31, 1989 Grand Slam Titles 2 singles Career Titles 21 singles / 9 doubles Olympic Medals Bronze Singles Instagram @vichka35 / 700k followers\n\nGarbiñe Muguruza\n\nThroughout her career, Garbiñe Muguruza has made it to three Grand Slam finals and won two of them, at the French Open in 2016 and Wimbledon in 2017.\n\nOn September 11, 2017, Muguruza reached the world No. 1 ranking, which she held for four weeks. Along with lucrative endorsements that feature her in marketing materials from Adidas, Babolat, Rolex, and Mazda, to name a few, she’s become one of the most famous tennis players.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country Spain Birthday October 8, 1993 Grand Slam Titles 2 singles Career Titles 10 singles / 5 doubles Olympic Medals – Instagram @garbimuguruza / 886k followers\n\nEugenie “Genie” Bouchard\n\nA few years after turning pro, Genie reached the semi-finals at the 2014 Australian and French Open for an excellent start to the year.\n\nHowever, she’d take things one step further that year, earning a spot in the finals at Wimbledon before falling to Petra Kvitová. Her results eventually netted her a career-high ranking of No. 5 on October 20, 2014.\n\nAfter a successful year, Bouchard struggled in 2015 but managed a solid appearance at the US Open before suffering a concussion in the locker room, which forced her to withdraw from the fourth round and effectively ended her season.\n\nSince then, her career has been up and down. She did win her first doubles and singles titles in 2019 and 2020, respectively.\n\nOff the court, Bouchard has attracted a massive fan following on social media, and she’s been featured in Sports Illustrated’s Swimsuit edition on two separate occasions. In 2021, she worked as a commentator for The Tennis Channel.\n\nHighest Rank 5 Country Canada Birthday February 25, 1994 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 1 singles / 1 doubles Olympic Medals – Instagram @geniebouchard / 2.1m followers\n\nEmma Raducanu\n\nBursting onto the scene in 2021, Emma Raducanu became the youngest British woman to reach the round of 16 at Wimbledon after receiving a wildcard into the tournament. Unfortunately, she retired due to breathing difficulties.\n\nLater that year, Emma earned her way into the US Open main draw through the qualifiers and managed to reach the tournament’s final without dropping a set. As a result, she became the youngest woman to reach the final since Maria Sharapova did so in 2002.\n\nEmma defeated Leylah Fernandez in the finals to become the first qualifier to win a Grand Slam tournament in the Open Era, which resulted in her meteoric rise and overnight stardom.\n\nAlthough it’s very early in her career, Emma has already earned sponsorships from Nike, Wilson, Tiffany & Co., and Dior, which will undoubtedly increase her worldwide exposure.\n\nHighest Rank 19 Country Great Britain Birthday November 13, 2002 Grand Slam Titles 1 singles Career Titles 1 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @emmaraducanu / 2.1m followers\n\nAngelique Kerber\n\nGerman tennis player, Angelique Kerber, is a successful female tennis player with three Grand Slam titles to her name and thirteen titles overall.\n\nOn September 12, 2016, she ascended to world No. 1 for the first time, and she won a silver medal at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics.\n\nBeyond her success on the court, she’s inked various endorsements over the years, including Adidas and Yonex for tennis. However, her fame has grown further as she’s become a global ambassador for Porche, along with others, including insurance company Generali, Bare Minerals cosmetics, and Rolex.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country Germany Birthday January 18, 1988 Grand Slam Titles 3 singles Career Titles 13 singles Olympic Medals Silver singles Instagram @angie.kerber / 675k followers\n\nPetra Kvitová\n\nLefty Petra Kvitová started her career on the WTA tour in 2006 and has achieved substantial success, winning 28 titles.\n\nHer two most significant achievements came in 2011 and 2014 as the champion of Wimbledon. However, she also had an opportunity as the finalist at the Australian Open in 2019.\n\nOn top of her international exposure coming from her success on the court, Petra has earned many endorsement deals from Nike, Wilson, ALO diamonds, to name a few.\n\nHighest Rank 2 Country Czech Republic Birthday March 8, 1990 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 28 singles Olympic Medals Bronze singles Instagram @petra.kvitova / 625k followers\n\nCori “CoCo” Gauff\n\nTeenage tennis star CoCo Gauff first burst onto the scene in 2019 when she defeated Venus Williams in the first round at Wimbledon after earning her way into the tournament through qualifying at the age of 15.\n\nHer results at Wimbledon received significant media attention, resulting in her matches receiving the highest viewership the days ESPN covered them.\n\nCoCo has consistently achieved results on the WTA tour, including her first two singles titles and a handful of doubles titles. As a young athlete, she’s received a handful of endorsements from Head, New Balance, and Barilla.\n\nHighest Rank 19 Country United States Birthday March 13, 2004 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 2 singles / 3 doubles Olympic Medals – Instagram @cocogauff / 734k followers\n\nKarolína Plíšková\n\nAlthough Karolína Plíšková hasn’t won any Grand Slam titles, she’s come close on several occasions. She’s reached the finals of the US Open and Wimbledon and the semi-finals of the Australian Open and French Open.\n\nHer consistent performance during her career has netted her 16 singles titles, which combined helped her to reach the world No. 1 ranking on July 17, 2021, a position she held for eight weeks.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country Czech Republic Birthday March 12, 1992 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 16 singles / 5 doubles Olympic Medals – Instagram @karolinapliskova / 441k followers\n\nSloane Stephens\n\nAt the relatively young age of 19, Sloane Stephens burst onto the scene when she reached the Australian Open semi-finals in 2013, which was unique because she defeated world No. 3, Serena Williams, en route.\n\nSince then, Sloane Stephens has performed consistently on the WTA tour and won six titles while gaining a substantial fan base. She also made it to the finals of the French Open in 2018.\n\nDuring her career, she’s reached a world No. 6 ranking and accumulated several strong endorsements from companies like Nike, Mercedes-Benz, and American Express.\n\nHighest Rank 6 Country United States Birthday March 20, 1993 Grand Slam Titles 1 singles Career Titles 6 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @sloanestephens / 528k followers\n\nBianca Andreescu\n\nAlong with her success as a young athlete, Bianca Andreescu became the highest-ranked Canadian tennis player on the WTA tour in October of 2019 as world No. 4.\n\nHer ranking came from her success that year, where she defeated Serena Williams twice on her way to winning the Canadian Open and US Open. At 18 years old, she was the first teenage Grand Slam champion since Maria Sharapova in 2006.\n\nBianca Andresscu receives strong fan support in Canada, where she was born and Romania, due to her heritage in that country.\n\nHighest Rank 4 Country Canada Birthday June 16, 2000 Grand Slam Titles 1 singles Career Titles 3 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @biancaandreescu_ / 701k followers\n\nSofia Kenin\n\nLike many players, Sofia Kenin started playing tennis early, but she drew attention to her skills from the age of five, which is unique.\n\nHowever, what put Kenin on the map was winning the Australian Open in 2020 at 21 years old, making her the youngest American woman to win a Grand Slam since Serena Willimas in 2002.\n\nDespite some ups and downs, Sofia Kenin remains a strong competitor on tour, and endorsements from companies like Fila, Nike, Babolat, and Motorola have helped increase her fame and exposure throughout her career.\n\nHighest Rank 4 Country United States Birthday November 14, 1998 Grand Slam Titles 1 singles Career Titles 5 singles / 2 doubles Olympic Medals – Instagram @sofia.kenin / 210k followers\n\nIga Świątek\n\nBreaking onto the WTA tour in 2019 and making it to the French Open’s fourth round, Iga debuted in the top 50 at the age of 18.\n\nHowever, in 2020, Iga managed to take things a step further, winning the French Open. She also earned WTA Fan Favorite Singles Player of the Year, which helped raise her exposure.\n\nAs a result of her relatively quick success on tour, Iga has earned several endorsements from companies like Asics, Red Bull, Xiamoi, and Lexus, further increasing her fame.\n\nHighest Rank 4 Country Poland Birthday May 31, 2001 Grand Slam Titles 1 singles Career Titles 3 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @iga.swiatek / 460k followers\n\nLeylah Fernandez\n\nAt the 2021 US Open, Leylah Fernandez made it to the finals but eventually lost to Champion and fellow teenager Emma Raducannu.\n\nDespite the loss, Leylah Fernandez achieved international recognition, especially considering she defeated three top-5 players on her way to the finals of that tournament.\n\nLeylah’s career is still in its infancy, but she’s quickly made a name for herself and already owns one title, which she won earlier in 2021 at the Monterrey Open in Mexico.\n\nHighest Rank 24 Country Canada Birthday September 6, 2002 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 1 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @leylahannietennis / 316k followers\n\nCamila Giorgi\n\nIn 2006, Camila Giorgi turned pro, and for a few years, she achieved moderate results on tour.\n\nHowever, fast forward to 2012, Camila made it to the fourth round of Wimbledon, her second appearance at the Championships. The result would push her into the top 100 rankings.\n\nIn 2014, Camila found her way into the top 50 rankings after reaching the finals at two tournaments. Then in 2015, she debuted in the top 30 along with her first singles title at the Topshelf Open in Rosmalen, Netherlands.\n\nCamila has continued her consistent performance throughout her career and logged her most impressive win at the Canadian Open, a WTA 1000 event, defeating Karolína Plíšková.\n\nOff the court, Camila is well-known for her appearance and has a solid social media following, which has helped increase her awareness on and off the tour.\n\nHighest Rank 26 Country Italy Birthday December 30, 1991 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 3 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @camila_giorgi_official / 511k followers\n\nAjla Tomljanovic\n\nIn December 2009, Ajla turned pro, initially playing for her birth country of Croatia. However, she eventually established a permanent residence and citizenship in Australia and has played for the country since February 2018.\n\nAjla has delivered consistent results on the court, earning her regular appearances in virtually all Grand Slam tournaments since 2014.\n\nHowever, despite her success, she hasn’t claimed any WTA titles. Her best result is at Wimbledon, where she reached the quarterfinals in 2021. Outside of that, she’s found her way to the finals at four different tournaments.\n\nOne factor that has increased her exposure is her relationships with high-profile ATP athletes, including Nick Kyrios and Matteo Berrettini, who have career-high rankings of 13 and 7, respectively.\n\nHighest Rank 39 Country Australia Birthday May 7, 1993 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles – Olympic Medals – Instagram @ajlatom / 193k followers\n\nMadison Keys\n\nAmerican Madison Keys first joined the WTA tour in 2009 and since then has delivered consistent results on the WTA Tour.\n\nIn Grand Slam tournaments, she’s made it deep into the events on numerous occasions, including a finals appearance at the 2017 US Open, where she lost to fellow American and Sloane Stephens.\n\nIn 2016, Madison debuted in the top 10 rankings for the first time, and she remains one of the strongest competitors on tour.\n\nOf the court, Madison has boosted her exposure through endorsements with Nike, Wilson, Evian, Acuvue, and others.\n\nHighest Rank 7 Country United States Birthday February 17, 1995 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 5 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @madisonkeys / 201k followers\n\nDonna Vekic\n\nCroatian Donna Veckic turned pro in September 2012 and, since 2013, has consistently appeared in nearly all Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nIn 2019 and 2021, she reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and the Australian Open, respectively. Donna has also won three titles during her career, including her most recent at the Courmayeur Open in Italy.\n\nAs a result of her success in 2019, she finished the year ranked No. 19, the highest during her career.\n\nOff the court, Donna’s appearance has provided her with several endorsement opportunities, including Nike, Yonex, and most recently Peugeot.\n\nHighest Rank 19 Country Croatia Birthday June 28, 1996 Grand Slam Titles – Career Titles 3 singles Olympic Medals – Instagram @donnavekic / 207k followers\n\nSu-Wei Hsieh\n\nIn 2001, Su-Wei Hsieh turned pro, but it wasn’t until 2008, when she made it to the fourth round of the Australian Open, that she’d make a name for herself as the first Taiwanese player to go that far.\n\nSince then, she’s claimed three singles titles and is well known as a challenging opponent with an unorthodox style of play.\n\nHowever, beyond singles, Su-Wei Hsieh has made a name for herself in doubles with thirty titles, including four at the Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nOverall, she’s a WTA tour veteran and well-respected by her peers.\n\nHighest Rank 23 Country Taiwan Birthday January 4, 1986 Grand Slam Titles 4 doubles Career Titles 3 singles / 30 doubles Olympic Medals – Instagram @sw.hsieh / 30.7k followers\n\nSvetlana Kuznetsova\n\nA highly accomplished player in singles and doubles, Svetlana Kuznetsova is a tour veteran who reached a career-high ranking of No. 1 on September 10, 2007.\n\nAt Grand Slam tournaments, she’s delivered some fantastic results, including a singles title at the US and French Open in 2004 and 2009, respectively.

She’s also one of only five players to complete a Grand Slam, winning all five majors in a single season.\n\nOn top of it all, she ended up marrying Andre Aggasi, one of the greatest male tennis players of all time and is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable players in history.\n\nIn 2004, Steffi Graf was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nHighest Rank 1 Country Germany Birthday June 14, 1969 Grand Slam Titles 22 singles / 1 doubles Career Titles 107 singles / 11 doubles Olympic Medals Gold and silver singles, Bronze doubles Instagram @(fan page) / 21.9k followers\n\nMargaret Court\n\nMargaret Court is considered by many to be the greatest female tennis player of all time, and for a good reason.\n\nShe holds the record for the most Grand Slam singles titles at 23 and earned 19 victories at Grand Slam events. In total, Margaret has 192 titles to her name.\n\nOne factor that makes her accomplishments unique is that her records span the amateur and open eras, which tends to lead to some debate regarding whether she’s truly the best player ever to play the sport or not.\n\nAt the Australian Open, she even has a stadium named after her.
