        "text": "Dear Players,\n\nWe are really excited to organize the HUNGARIAN INDOOR CHAMPIONSHIPS ZSUZSA KÖRMÖCZY as the first Hungarian MT1000 tournament in Budapest, in February 2024. We all hope that you will be part of this extraordinary event.\n\nIn order to avoid too many late matches, we will have two venues during the whole week of the tournament: one will be in Buda side, the well-known Park Tenisz Klub, while the other one will be the Mini Garros Tenisz Klub in Pest side. Although the two venues are not close to each other, a shuttle service will be in place to ensure the transfer between the official hotel(s) and the venues.\n\nSome useful and important information\n\nFor those coming by car, there will be free parking places right at the entrance of both tennis clubs (however, the number of available places is limited at Park Tenisz Klub). There will be ITF boards with flashes indicating to direction to the clubs (Mini Garros is just behind the shopping mall ASIA CENTER).\n\nFor those who stay in the official hotel(s) of the tournament, a shuttle is to be organised during the day. We will release updated information before the tournament.\n\nThe onsite sign-in deadline for doubles and mixed doubles is at 4 PM on the day when the singles of the given category start. However, the start of doubles and mixed doubles will depend on the number of players. You can enter 2 events: singles + doubles, or singles + mixed doubles, or doubles + mixed doubles. However, if the number of entries remains below 350, we will allow the entry for 3 events. Those willing to play in the consolation draw have to sign-in right after the lost match at the tournament desk of the venue.\n\nThe matches will be scheduled the following way: the first round will be scheduled for 1 hour (e.g. from 9AM to 10AM), the second round for 2 hours (e.g. from 10AM to 12AM), etc. This will ensure that no court will be empty throughout the day. You are requested to arrive to the designated club at least 15 minutes before the planned start of your match.\n\nYou will have the possibility to buy warm meals, drinks, coffee, sandwitches, etc. in the club houses.\n\nIn view of the limited number of tennis courts and the important number of players, there is no practice court during the day. You will have the opportunity to warm up in the morning before the start of the matches.\n\nFor the draws being finished before Thursday evening, the price giving ceremony will be held at the players’ party. More information about the players’ party will follow soon.\n\nZsuzsa Körmöczy (25 August 1924 – 16 September 2006) was a Hungarian tennis player. She reached a career high of World No. 2 in women’s tennis, and won the 1958 Franch Open at the age of 34.\n\nIn Hungary, as a 16-year-old in 1940 she won the national doubles and mixed doubles titles, and she later won the national singles title six times, and the doubles or mixed doubles trophies 10 times.\n\nAccording to Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Körmöczy was ranked in the world top 10 in 1953, 1955, 1956, and 1958 and again from 1959 through 1961 (no rankings issued from 1940 through 1945), reaching a career high of World No. 2 in those rankings in 1958 at the age of 34.\n\nShe won the singles title at the 1958 French Championships at the age of 33 and reached the semifinals at Wimbledon in 1958. She was named Hungarian Sportwoman of the Year in 1958 after having won the French Championships the same year. She became the first sportswoman granted this award. She won eight of the nine tournaments she entered in 1958, and reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon. In 1959 she made Wimbledon’s ’round of eight’, finishing sixth, and was the French Open Singles runner-up.\n\nShe retired from competition in 1964 to work as a coach for Vasas (the Ironworker Union’s Sports Club) and act as the national tennis association’s manager. After the fall of communism, she was decorated by new democratic governments in 1994 and 2003.\n\nIn 2007, she was inducted posthumously into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame."
