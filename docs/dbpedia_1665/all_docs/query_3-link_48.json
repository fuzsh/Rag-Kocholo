She was the first African American to play in the U.S. grass court championships at Forest Hills, N.Y. (1950), and at Wimbledon, England (1951). In addition to many international tournament victories, she won the French women's singles championship in 1956 and the U.S. and British championships in both 1957 and 1958. She retired from competition in 1958. In 1971 she was named to the National Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nSee her autobiography, I Always Wanted to Be Somebody (1958).\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.
