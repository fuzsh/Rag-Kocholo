        "text": "Profession: Tennis Player\n\nBiography: Althea Gibson was an American tennis player, best known for her achievements and the fact that she was the first was the first African American of either gender to play professional tennis.\n\nAlice Marble came out in support of her being allowed to play, saying: \"If Althea Gibson represents a challenge to the present crop of women players, it's only fair that they should meet that challenge on the courts.\"\n\nGibson met this challenge, winning the French Open in 1956 and then a year later winning the women's singles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. She would win both of these latter two again in 1958.\n\nBorn: August 25, 1927\n\nBirthplace: Clarendon Country, South Carolina, USA\n\nGeneration: Greatest Generation\n\nChinese Zodiac: Rabbit\n\nStar Sign: Virgo"
