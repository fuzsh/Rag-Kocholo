The Australian Open and the U.S. Open are both played on hard courts, and the French Open is played on clay.\n\n3. C\n\nDon Budge was the first to win the Grand Slam all in one year, 1938.\n\n4. B\n\nThe first tennis racket strings were made of the stretchy outer lining of sheep intestine.\n\n5. D\n\nIn 1903 Englishman Laurie Doherty, who won 13 Wimbledon titles between 1897 and 1905 (including five consecutive singles titles), became the first non-American to win the U.S. Open singles championship.\n\n6. D\n\nIn 1971 Rod Laver became the first professional tennis player to win more than $1 million in career prize money.\n\n7. B\n\nMolla Mallory is the only woman to have won the U.S. Open singles championship eight times. She won her first in 1915 and her last in 1926.\n\n8. D\n\nOn July 7, 1985, 17-year-old German tennis player Boris Becker became the first unseeded player to win Wimbledon’s men’s singles championship. At the same time, he became the youngest person to win any Grand Slam title in men’s singles and the first German to win Wimbledon.\n\n9. A\n\nAlthea Gibson dominated women’s tennis in the late 1950s. She was also the first Black player to win the French Open (1956), Wimbledon (1957–58), and U.S. Open (1957–58) singles championships.\n\n10. C\n\nJohn McEnroe won his first U.S. Open in 1979, and by the year’s end he was rated one of the best players in the world; he went on to become the first man since Bill Tilden to win the U.S. Open singles championship three consecutive times.\n\n11. A\n\nMartina Navratilova holds the record for the most professional tennis championships, dominating women’s tennis in the late 1970s and the ’80s. In 1982 alone Navratilova won 90 of 93 matches, including 41 consecutive matches, and 15 tournaments, notably the Wimbledon women’s singles and the French Open women’s singles. On winning her 158th title (in 1992 in Chicago), Navratilova had accumulated more championships than any other player, male or female, in the history of tennis. She retired after the 1994 season, having won 167 singles titles in all.\n\n12. D\n\nThe neighbourhood of Wimbledon, located about 8 miles (13 km) southwest of the City of London, is the site of the annual All-England Championships, better known as the Wimbledon championships.\n\n13.
