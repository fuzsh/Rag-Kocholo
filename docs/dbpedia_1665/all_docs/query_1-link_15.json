        "text": "The French Open began its existence as a men's singles tournament for members of French clubs. It was held for the first time in 1891 at the Stade Francais club in Paris. Six years later, the tournament added women's singles competitions. At the same time, the World Hard Court Championships also were being held in France and have often been considered the true precursor to the Open, as it was open to international players.\n\nAs for the French Championships, international players were invited to participate in 1925. For the next three years, the new French Internationals was held at the Stade Francais and Racing Club de France, until 1928, when the Roland Garros Stadium was built.\n\nThe 1928 French Internationals was the first event held in Roland Garros, built to host the Davis Cup later that year. Over the next five years, the French Internationals established itself as a major international tournament -- thanks in large part to the success and popularity of the \"Musketeers,\" the men who had won the Davis Cup in 1927 and several years in a row after that.\n\nThose four men and a few other established French tennis stars excelled in the first few decades of the tournament, and it was only in 1933 that a non-Frenchman won the men's title for the first time, when John H. Crawford beat Henri Cochet.\n\nThe championship was cancelled from 1940-45 due to World War II, but it returned strong as tennis continued to grow in popularity in the 1940s and 1950s. In 1956, American Althea Gibson won the women's singles title, becoming the first African-American to win a Grand Slam singles event.\n\nIn 1968, the tournament became the first Grand Slam event to join the \"Open\" era, allowing professionals to join the championships. That allowed some incredible years in the following decades, including Bjorn Borg's impressive six victories between 1974 and 1981 (four of them consecutively). At the same time Borg was dominating the men's competition, Chris Evert was easing through the women's tournaments -- winning six titles, more than any other female player, all between 1974 and 1986.\n\nIn 1981, the Open added several new prizes to the competition: the Prix Orange, for the player with the most sportsmanship; the Prix Citron, for the player with the best personality; and the Prix Bourgeon, for the tennis player revelation of the year.\n\nSince 2006, the tournament has begun on a Sunday, not a Monday, as most tennis tournaments. The following year, the Open provided equal prize money to men and women for the first time. The current purse for a singles' winner is 1,200,000 euros.\n\nAfter Frenchmen dominated the early years of the Open -- before internationals were allowed to play -- it has been Spanish citizens most often holding the title in recent years. Spain has the most men's single titles in Open history with 13 -- France sits behind the U.S. and Australia (both 11) with 10. The Spanish domination is most evident, of course, in the current holder, Rafael Nadal. Nadal has won the tournament eight times, the most singles titles by one player at any of the four Grand Slam events.\n\nThe French Open is held at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris. The stadium was built in 1928 and named after aviator Roland Garros, the first man to fly over the Mediterranean Sea. The complex contains 20 courts, including three stadiums, as well as a restaurant, museum, and the French national training center.\n\nRoland Garros was built in 1927, when French tennis was at a new peak. The \"Musketeers\" of French tennis -- Rene Lacoste, Jean Borotra, Henri Cochet and Jacques Brugnon -- had just won the Davis Cup in the United States in 1927, a relatively large upset. The French decided to defend their title on home soil in 1928, and Roland Garros was built to house the event. The land was received by the Stade de France under the condition that the complex was named after Garros, a respected World War I pilot. The 1928 French Championships christened the new stadium that spring.\n\nThe center court seats 14,840 spectators and is considered the centerpiece of Roland Garros. Originally known simply as Court Central, the court was renamed in 1998 after Philippe Chatrier, a long-time president of the French tennis federation. The four grandstands in the stadium are named after tennis' four \"Musketeers.\" Court A -- later renamed Court Suzanne Lenglen -- was built in 1994 and holds 10,068 spectators. The court is named after one of the first stars of women's tennis and a six-time French Open (and Wimbledon) winner.\n\nRoland Garros features clay courts, making the French Open the only Grand Slam event played on clay. The material that makes up the courts is more than just clay: the courts are surfaced with a combination of white limestone and powdered red brick dust on top. In 1928, the surface was completely innovative and meant to deal with clay courts' largest problem, poor drainage. Since then, few true clay courts have been built, but courts made with the limestone and brick mixture play similarly to true clay courts and are classified as clay courts. The red brick layer on top of the court must be relaid often -- sometimes daily, during major tournaments.\n\nIn 2009, the French tennis federation commissioned an expansion of Roland Garros, now the smallest of the Grand Slam arenas. The expansion included not only renovations of several existing courts but the construction of at least one new stadium and two more courts. The federation faced opposition from the city government, and the next year, officials contemplated moving the French Open to a new, larger stadium somewhere else in Paris.\n\nThe federation voted to keep the French Open at Roland Garros in 2011, citing the cost of building a new stadium, which would be almost double the expected cost of renovations. They still hope to expand Roland Garros sometime soon in the coming years."
