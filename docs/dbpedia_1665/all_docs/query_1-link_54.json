        "text": "The Term’s Origin & Use\n\nWhen Wimbledon, one of the world’s most significant tennis tournaments, started in 1877, the notion of a Grand Slam didn’t exist, and for a good reason, the other major tennis tournaments hadn’t yet begun.\n\nHere’s a quick timeline of when each tournament first opened its doors.\n\nWimbledon: 1877\n\nUS Open: 1881\n\nFrench Open: 1891\n\nAustralian Open: 1905\n\nOver time, these tournaments established themselves as premier events, which held significant weight. Until 1932, many players competed in all four events, but no player won more than two in a single year.\n\nHowever, in 1932, Australian tennis player Jack Crawford made history when he won the first three majors back to back and then found his way to the finals of the US Open against Fred Perry of the UK.\n\nAhead of the match, New Your Times writer John Kieran wrote that Jack’s success against Fred would be akin to a Grand Slam, referencing a bidding convention in the popular card game bridge.\n\nAlthough Jack Crawford wasn’t successful, losing in five sets to Fred Perry, the term stuck. Interestingly, Fred Perry narrowly missed his opportunity at a Grand Slam the following year, only losing the French Open.\n\nFive years later, American Don Budge became the first player to complete a Grand Slam, winning all four tournaments in the calendar year.\n\nTo date, only five players, male or female, have achieved the feat playing singles. Here’s a list of the players who have completed a Grand Slam.\n\nPlayer Year Country Discipline Don Budge 1938 America Singles Rod Laver 1962 Australia Singles Rod Laver 1969 Australia Singles Maureeen Connolly 1953 United States Singles Margaret Court 1970 Australia Singles Steffi Graf 1988 Germany Singles\n\nRod Laver’s accomplishment is unique because he not only achieved it twice but did so as an amateur before and after the Open Era, which began in 1968.\n\nAs a side note, Stefan Edberg achieved a Grand Slam in boys singles, standing alone in that achievement.\n\nBeyond singles, there have been nine players to achieve a Grand Slam in various doubles. Here’s an overview of those.\n\nPlayer Year Country Discipline Ken McGregor 1951 Australi Men’s Doubles Franck Sedgman 1951 Australia Men’s Doubles Maria Bueno 1960 Brazil Women’s Doubles Martina Navratilova 1984 United States Women’s Doubles Pam Shriver 1984 United States Women’s Doubles Martina Hingis 1998 Switzerland Women’s Doubles Margaret Court 1963/1965 Australia Mixed Doubles Ken Fletcher 1963 Australia Mixed Doubles Owen Davidson 1967 Australia Mixed Doubles\n\nToday, a Grand Slam remains one of the most significant achievements in tennis. Serena Williams came close in 2015, and Novak Djokovic also missed an opportunity in 2021.\n\nMargaret Court is the only player to complete the Grand Slam in two disciplines – singles and mixed doubles.\n\nEvolving Use Of The Term\n\nInitially, the term Grand Slam only referred to a specific achievement where a player won all found majors in a calendar year.\n\nHowever, the term has been somewhat genericized in that these days players and fans from around the world more broadly refer to the majors as Grand Slam events or simply Grand Slams.\n\nHere are a few examples of the more generic term used in a sentence:\n\nAndre Agassi won 8 Grand Slams during his career.\n\nWhat Grand Slams have you attended?\n\nThe Australian Open is the first Grand Slam of the year.\n\nTechnically, it would be more accurate to call swap Grand Slam in the above sentences for ‘majors’ or ‘Grand Slam events.’ Still, the above usage is perfectly acceptable and widely understood.\n\nRelated Achievements\n\nAlthough the Grand Slam remains one of the most recognizable achievements in tennis, there is a wide range of similar or related accomplishments that are noteworthy and impressive.\n\nThis section will touch on each and share the players that have achieved them throughout history.\n\nNon-Calendar Grand Slam\n\nAlthough arguably not as prestigious, a player achieves a non-calendar Grand Slam when they hold all four major titles simultaneously, but not in a single calendar year.\n\nFor example, suppose a player missed the Australian Open, the first major of the year, but won the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open and returned the following year to win the Australian Open. In that case, they’d have completed a non-calendar Grand Slam.\n\nMany argue the feat is equally as impressive as a Grand Slam, but it doesn’t hold quite as much weight. Here’s a list of players who have accomplished this feat in singles or doubles.\n\nPlayer Period Country Discipline Novak Djokovic 2015–2016 Serbia Men’s Singles Martina Navratilova 1983–1984 United States Women’s Singles Steffi Graf 1993–1994 Germany Women’s Singles Serena Williams 2002–2003/2014–2015 United States Women’s Singles Bob Bryan 2012–2013 United States Men’s Doubles Mike Bryan 2012–2013 United States Men’s Doubles Louise Brough 1949–1950 United States Women’s Doubles Martina Navratilova 1986–1987 United States Women’s Doubles Pam Shriver 1986–1987 United States Women’s Doubles Gigi Fernández 1992–1993 United States Women’s Doubles Natasha Zvereva 1992–1993/1996–1997 Belarus Women’s Doubles Serena Williams 2009–2010 United States Women’s Doubles Venus Williams 2009–2010 United States Women’s Doubles Billie Jean King 1967–1968 United States Mixed Doubles\n\nCareer Grand Slam\n\nOnce introduced to the topic of a Grand Slam in tennis, you’ll likely stumble upon the Career Grand Slam, which refers to any player who won all four Grand Slam tournaments throughout their career.\n\nAlthough it remains an impressive feat, the non-consecutive or time-boxed nature of a career Grand Slam makes it not quite as prestigious.\n\nOnly 18 players have accomplished a Career Grand Slam in singles, while 62 players have done it in doubles. To avoid table overload in this article, I’m only going to include the 18 players in singles.\n\nPlayer Period Country Discipline Fred Perry Amateur Era Serbia Men’s Singles Don Budge Amateur Era United States Men’s Singles Rod Laver x2 Amateur Era Australia Men’s Singles Roy Emerson x2 Amateur Era Australia Men’s Singles Andre Agassi Open Era United States Men’s Singles Roger Federer Open Era Switzerland Men’s Singles Rafael Nadal Open Era Spain Men’s Singles Novak Djokovic x2 Open Era Serbia Men’s Singles Maureen Connolly Amateur Era United States Women’s Singles Doris Hart Amateur Era United States Women’s Singles Shirley Fry Irvin Amateur Era United States Women’s Singles Margaret Court x3 Amateur Era Australia Women’s Singles Billie Jean King Mixed United States Women’s Singles Chris Evert x2 Open Era United States Women’s Singles Martina Navratilova x2 Open Era United States Women’s Singles Steffi Graf x4 Open Era Germany Women’s Singles Serena Williams x3 Open Era United States Women’s Singles Maria Sharapova Open Era Russia Women’s Singles\n\nListed next to relevant player names, I’ve identified those who have achieved a career Grand Slam more than one time.\n\nGolden Slam\n\nA Golden Slam takes the notion of a Grand Slam and ups the ante. In addition to winning all four majors in a calendar year, the player who wins a Golden Slam must also win Olympic Gold that same year.\n\nConsidering the summer Olympics only happens every four years, this is a particularly unique accomplishment. It’s worth noting that tennis wasn’t an Olympic sport from 1924 to 1987, so many players throughout history never had the opportunity to compete for a Golden Slam during their careers.\n\nAcross the ATP and WTA tours, Steffi Graf is the only player to have achieved a Golden Slam in her career. However, it’s also worth noting that wheelchair tennis players Dylan Alcott and Diede de Groot also managed to accomplish the feat.\n\nSteff Graf pulled it off in 1988, and Dylan Alcott and Diede de Groot accomplished it in 2021. The tennis community coined the term Golden Slam when Steffi Graf first pulled it off during her career.\n\nAs you might expect, the tennis world also keeps track of players who complete a career Golden Slam. That is, a player who wins all four majors and Olympic gold independent of time frame.\n\nPlayer Country Discipline Andre Agassi United States Men’s Singles Rafael Nadal Spain Men’s Singles Steffi Graf Germany Women’s Singles Serena Williams United States Women’s Singles Todd Woodbridge Australia Men’s Doubles Mark Woodforde Australia Men’s Doubles Daniel Nestor Canada Men’s Doubles Bob Bryan United States Men’s Doubles Mike Bryan United States Men’s Doubles Pam Shriver United States Women’s Doubles Gigi Fernández United States Women’s Doubles Serena Williams United States Women’s Doubles Venus Williams United States Women’s Doubles\n\nDuring their 2012 and 2013 seasons, doubles players Bob and Mike Bryan became the first to achieve a non-calendar Golden Slam.\n\nSuper Slam\n\nAlthough a Golden Slam feels like a near-impossible accomplishment for many, a Super Slam takes things one step further.\n\nIn addition to winning all four majors and Olympic gold, a player must also win the season-ending finals in a calendar year to achieve a Super Slam. In 2021, that would include winning the ATP or WTA finals for men’s and women’s tennis or the Wheelchair Tennis Masters for players with disabilities.\n\nUntil 2021, no player had accomplished the feat. However, Diede de Groot managed to become the first player ever to do so.\n\nFurthermore, Steffi Graf achieved a non-calendar Super Slam when she won the season-ending championships in 1987, then followed it up with her impressive year in 1988, winning all majors and Olympic gold.\n\nAs you might expect, the notion of a career Super Slam does exist with three players in singles, seven players in doubles, two players in wheelchair singles, and ten players in wheelchair doubles. I’ve listed the players in singles and doubles below.\n\nPlayer Country Discipline Andre Agassi United States Men’s Singles Steffi Graf Germany Women’s Singles Serena Williams United States Women’s Singles Todd Woodbridge Australia Men’s Doubles Mark Woodforde Australia Men’s Doubles Daniel Nestor Canada Men’s Doubles Bob Bryan United States Men’s Doubles Mike Bryan United States Men’s Doubles Pam Shriver United States Women’s Doubles Gigi Fernández United States Women’s Doubles\n\nThree-Quarter Slam\n\nPlayers who miss winning a Grand Slam by one event are said to have achieved a Three-Quarter Slam. More specifically, a player must win three Grand Slam events in a calendar year.\n\nThere are quite a few players who have achieved this feat during their career, but only five were in a position to win the Grand Slam while competing at the final major of the year.\n\nIn total, the following number of players have achieved this feat:\n\n19 singles\n\n47 doubles\n\n6 wheelchair singles\n\n7 wheelchair doubles\n\n5 junior singles\n\n20 junior doubles\n\n104 total\n\nA handful of these players had the opportunity to achieve a Grand Slam during the year’s final major, including Jack Crawford, Lew Hoad, Novak Djokovic, Martina Navratilova, and Serena Williams.\n\nSurface Slam\n\nAs it might sound, Surface Slam is a term that describes any player who wins a Grand Slam title on each of the three court surfaces, which include hard court, clay, and grass. Here are the tournaments and their respective surfaces.\n\nAustralian Open: Hard\n\nFrench Open: Clay\n\nWimbledon: Grass\n\nUS Open: Hard\n\nTherefore, a player can win either the Australian Open or US Open, plus the French Open and Wimbledon in a calendar year, to claim a Surface Slam.\n\nHere’s the number of players to achieve a Surface Slam by discipline.\n\n5 singles\n\n16 doubles\n\n3 wheelchair singles\n\n13 wheelchair doubles\n\n4 junior singles\n\n13 junior doubles\n\n108 total\n\nAlthough less discussed, there’s also the notion of a non-calendar Surface Slam and career Surface Slam.\n\nChannel Slam\n\nTwo of the sport’s most prestigious tournaments, Wimbledon in London and the French Open in Paris, take place a few weeks apart.\n\nAs a point of reference, for 2022, the French Open will take place from May 16th to June 5th. At the same time, Wimbledon will begin on June 27th and end on July 10th. Only 22 days separate the end of the French Open and the beginning of Wimbledon.\n\nThis timeframe is unique mainly due to the difference in court surfaces, clay for the French Open, and grass for Wimbledon. Clay is the sport’s slowest surface, while grass is its fastest, making transitioning from one to the next tricky, especially with limited time.\n\nPlayers who win these tournaments back to back have won a Channel Slam, arguably one of the most challenging accomplishments a player can achieve. The term comes from the English Channel, which geographically separates these two tournaments.\n\nIn total, the following number of players have achieved this feat:\n\n22 singles\n\n78 doubles\n\n3 wheelchair singles\n\n16 wheelchair doubles\n\n17 junior singles\n\n32 junior doubles\n\n276 total\n\nProfessional Slam (Pro Slam)\n\nUp until the Open Era, tennis players fell into one of two camps: amateur or professional. Amateur players didn’t compete for money, while the pros played tournaments to make a living.\n\nAs a result, these players didn’t compete against each other. Most notably, professionals weren’t allowed to play in the majors, i.e., the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.\n\nDespite that, the men’s pro tour did have a set of tournaments that were rough equivalents to the majors played by amateurs, which included the Wembley Championships in London, the French Pro Championships in Paris, and the US Pro Championships, held at a variety of venues throughout the United States. It’s worth noting that these tournaments did not offer a women’s draw.\n\nA player claimed a Professional Slam when they won all three of these events in a calendar year, which Ken Rosewall and Rod Laver achieved in 1963 and 1967, respectively.\n\nPlayers who achieved a career Professional Slam include Americans Ellsworth Vines and Don Budge and German tennis player Hans Nüsslein.\n\nBoxed Set\n\nPerhaps one of the lesser-known accomplishments in tennis is the boxed set, a career achievement where a player wins at least one of every major title across each discipline in tennis: singles, doubles, and mixed doubles.\n\nMore specifically, a player needs to win a major title in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open for a total of 12 major titles.\n\nOnly three female players have achieved this feat, including Margaret Court, Doris Hart, and Martina Navratilova.\n\nGrand Slam Tournaments\n\nEvery year there are four Grand Slam tournaments or events. A player who wins all four of them in a calendar year has achieved a Grand Slam.\n\nThese tournaments are the most significant in tennis for a variety of reasons, including their history, size, ranking points, and prize money. As a result, they also garner the most attention from fans.\n\nAustralian Open\n\nThe Australian Open is the first major of the year, taking place in Melbourne Park every January. Initially, it was a grass court tournament, but it changed to hard courts in 1988.\n\nDue to its remote geographic location, the Australian Open has a unique history. The tournament first began in 1905 but wasn’t officially designated as a major until 1924.\n\nMany of the sport’s top players skipped the tournament rather than make the long journey by boat, which would have caused many players to miss the holidays, i.e., Christmas and the New Year.\n\nEventually, when air travel became common in the 1950s, more players began to travel to the tournament, but player attendance didn’t pick up significantly until the 1980s. These days, the event is a crucial stop on the calendar for the world’s top players.\n\nLocation Melbourne, Australia Surface Hard Draw 128 singles / 64 doubles Ranking Points for Winner 2,000 Prize Money $71,500,000 (2021) Attendance 812,000 (2020)*\n\n*Showing pre-pandemic attendance number\n\nFrench Open\n\nFollowing the Australian Open on the calendar, the French Open, otherwise known as Roland Garros, kicks off every year at the end of May and is the only major played on clay courts.\n\nThe tournament takes place at the Stade Roland-Garros in Paris, France, named after World War I aviation hero Roland Garros.\n\nIn 1891, the event opened its doors for the first time, but it wasn’t designated a major until 1925.\n\nLocation Paris, France Surface Hard Draw 128 singles / 64 doubles Ranking Points for Winner 2,000 Prize Money $47,995,331 (2019)* Attendance 480,575 (2019)*\n\n*Showing pre-pandemic attendance and prize numbers\n\nWimbledon\n\nWimbledon is the world’s oldest tennis tournament and therefore considered by many to be the most prestigious.\n\nHeld at the All England Lawn Club, the Wimbledon Championships first took place in 1877. The tournament is the third major of the year, which runs during July on grass tennis courts in Wimbledon, London.\n\nLocation Wimbledon, London Surface Grass Draw 128 singles / 64 doubles Ranking Points for Winner 2,000 Prize Money $50,829,750 (2019) Attendance 500,397 (2019)*\n\n*Showing pre-pandemic attendance and prize numbers\n\nUS Open\n\nThe US Open is the second oldest major, which takes place in New York City, NY, at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\n\nLike the Australian Open, the US Open is a hard court tournament and the final major of the year, which begins at the end of August.\n\nIn 1881, the tournament first took place at the Newport Casino, which now houses the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nLocation New York City, NY, US Surface Hard Draw 128 singles / 64 doubles Ranking Points for Winner 2,000 Prize Money $57,426,000 (2019)* Attendance 631,134 (2019)*\n\n*Showing pre-pandemic attendance and prize numbers\n\nFAQs\n\nHere are a handful of common questions players ask about Grand Slams.\n\nHas any tennis player won all four Grand Slams?\n\nYes. Five players have won all four Grand Slam tournaments in a calendar year, including Don Budge, Maureen Connolly, Rod Laver, Margaret Court, and Steffi Graf. The tennis world refers to this achievement as a Grand Slam.\n\nHowever, more broadly, more players have won all four Grand Slam tournaments throughout their careers. Here’s are the numbers that have achieved this feat across various disciplines.\n\nSingles: 18\n\nDoubles: 62\n\nWheelchair Singles: 2\n\nWheelchair Doubles: 18\n\nJunior Singles: 1\n\nJunior Doubles: 1\n\n*Above figures include men and women.\n\nWhy are there only four Grand Slams in tennis?\n\nThe Grand Slam tournaments are the oldest and most prestigious in tennis, each playing a vital role in developing the sport.\n\nThere are only four because no other tournaments come close to the history, scope, and tradition they each hold.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the ATP and WTA do not run these tournaments. Instead, they organize their schedules around them.\n\nWith that in mind, there will likely never be another Grand Slam named as it would significantly detract from the emphasis placed on these tournaments, which all four would surely oppose.\n\nWhich tennis Grand Slam comes first in the year?\n\nThe Australian Open comes first in the year, followed by the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.\n\nHere are their planned dates for the 2022 season:\n\nAustralian Open: January 17th – January 30th\n\nFrench Open: May 16th – June 5th\n\nWimbledon: June 27th – July 10th\n\nUS Open: August 29th – September 11th\n\nWho qualifies for tennis Grand Slams?\n\nGrand Slam singles events have 128 player draws. Of these athletes, 104 qualify through ranking, 16 qualify by winning three qualifying rounds ahead of the tournament, and eight through wildcards.\n\nHow are tennis Grand Slam draws determined?\n\nA Grand Slam tournament’s singles draw is determined via three different mechanisms. First, the 104 top-ranked players who sign up for the event automatically qualify.\n\nNext, each tournament hosts qualifying rounds, and players who win three matches make it into the draw. Finally, each major selects eight players for automatic entry as wild cards.\n\nHow many rounds in a tennis Grand Slam?\n\nA Grand Slam tournament features a 128 player draw, which results in seven rounds from the first through the finals. Here’s a snapshot of the rounds that take place during each Grand Slam event.\n\nFirst Round: 128 players\n\nSecond Round: 64 players\n\nThird Round: 32 players\n\nFourth Round: 16 players\n\nQuarter-Finals: 8 players\n\nSemi-Finals: 4 players\n\nFinals: 2 players\n\nHow many sets in a tennis Grand Slam?\n\nGrand Slam tournaments in singles are best of five sets for men and best of three sets for women. Doubles and all other events, i.e., wheelchair tennis, juniors, etc., are all best of three sets.\n\nWhich Grand Slam has the highest prize money?\n\nThe US Open offers the highest prize money out of the four Grand Slam tournaments. For the sake of parity, I’m using 2019 pre-pandemic prize money for comparison. Here’s what each event offered.\n\nTouranment Local Currency US Dollars Australian Open $62,500,000 $45,134,687 French Open €42,661,000 $47,994,051 Wimbledon £35,016,000 $46,828,472 US Open $57,426,000 $57,426,000\n\nHow much do tennis players make in Grand Slams?\n\nTennis players make varying amounts of money relative to how many rounds they win and the discipline they compete in, i.e., singles, doubles, etc.\n\nAs an example, here’s what men and women earned playing singles at the US Open in 2021.\n\nRound Total Per Player Winner $2,500,000 Runner-Up $1,250,000 Semifinalists $675,000 Quarterfinalists $425,000 Round of 16 $265,000 Round of 32 $180,000 Round of 64 $115,000 Round of 128 $75,000 Total $40,560,000\n\nWhich tennis Grand Slam has the highest attendance?\n\nThe Australian Open has the highest attendance out of the four Grand Slam tournaments. For the sake of parity, I’m using 2019 pre-pandemic attendance numbers for comparison.\n\nHere’s what each event offered.\n\nAustralian Open: 812,000\n\nFrench Open: 480,575\n\nWimbledon: 500,397\n\nUS Open: 631,134\n\nWhich tennis Grand Slam wasn’t played in 2020?\n\nDue to the pandemic, Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam tournament that event organizers canceled.\n\nThe Australian Open took place in January before the pandemic hit hard. The French Open, which usually runs in May each year, moved to the end of September, and the US Open kept its regular dates beginning at the end of August.\n\nWho is the youngest tennis Grand Slam winner?\n\nDuring the Open Era, Martina Hingis is the youngest player to win a Grand Slam tournament winning the 1997 Australian Open at 16 years and 117 days old.\n\nOn the men’s side, Michael Chang won the 1989 French Open at 17 years 110 days old, the youngest male in history.\n\nWho is the oldest tennis Grand Slam winner?\n\nKen Rosewall is the oldest player to win a Grand Slam tournament, defeating Malcolm Anderson 7-6, 6-3, 7-5 at the age of 37 when playing the Australian Open in 1972.\n\nWhat is a double career Grand Slam in tennis?\n\nA career Grand Slam refers to any player who wins all four Grand Slam tournaments during their career independent of timeframe. A player who wins a double career Grand Slam has accomplished the feat twice.\n\nWhich tennis Grand Slam is the most prestigious?\n\nFans and players widely regard Wimbledon as the most prestigious Grand Slam as it is the oldest of the four majors and carries a significant amount of history and tradition."
