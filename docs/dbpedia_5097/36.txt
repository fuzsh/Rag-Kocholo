Théophile Gautier was a French poet, dramatist, novelist, journalist, and art and literary critic. He is most remembered today for his short stories and his poetry, which represent some of the finest examples of French Romantic literature.

Gautier's poetry is characterized by its precise imagery, formal perfection, and evocative language. He was a master of versification and sought to achieve a sense of painterly beauty in his work. Gautier’s commitment to the “art for art’s sake” movement, which emphasized aesthetic beauty over social or moral messages, distinguished his work.
