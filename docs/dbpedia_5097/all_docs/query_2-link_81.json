        "text": "Dangerous Liaisons by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos\n\nThis epistolary novel, published in 1782, is one of the major literary works of the 18th century. It recounts the perverse alliance between the Marquise de Merteuil and her friend and former lover the Viscount de Valmont. Using each other for their own purposes and deceiving their respective companions, the Machiavellian duo plays with the high society of which they are part. This book mixes intrigue with manipulation, recounting the libertine lifestyle of the time. I may have fallen into oblivion during the 19th century but took its place as a classic of French literature in the early 1940s.\n\nBel–Ami by Guy de Maupassant\n\nBel-Ami, a realist book published in 1885, recounts the adventures of Georges Duroy in his quest for power. As a young railway employee, he climbed the social ranks thanks to his many mistresses and mocked the codes of his society. Maupassant used his own experience to establish the close links between capitalism, politics and the press of the time in his novel. Even today, Bel-Ami is considered one of the greatest works in French literature.\n\nLe Père Goriot by Honoré de Balzac\n\nThis novel is part of the immense collection La Comédie Humaine, which brings together 90 works by Honoré de Balzac. Le Père Goriot recounts the daily life of the residents of the Maison Vauquer boarding house. Eugène de Rastignac, a student among them, is eager to make a place in Parisian high society and can be found in several of the author’s novels. Through the hand dealt to him by fate, the young man finds himself linked to a bankrupt widower and fellow boarder, Jean-Joachim Goriot. The story highlights the unreasonable paternal love of the latter along with the boundless ambition of de Rastignac, depicting Parisian society through its different social strata.\n\nThe Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas\n\nThe Three Musketeers, a legendary cloak and dagger tale, was published in 1844. The adventures of Athos, Porthos, Aramis and d’Artagnan, famous musketeers of King Louis XIII who try to thwart the Machiavellian plans of Cardinal Richelieu, and the mysterious Lady de Winter, have fascinated readers for centuries. This novel uses real historical characters, thus blurring the boundaries between reality and fiction. Alexandre Dumas adapted his literary work into a play after the novel’s success. Almost 200 years after its publication, The Three Musketeers continues to inspire readers today.\n\nThe Red and the Black by Stendhal\n\nThis novel is undoubtedly one of the greatest books in the history of literature. The Red and the Black recounts Julien Sorel’s two-part journey. The first part takes place during his younger years while he lived in the Franche-Comté region of France. In the second part, he goes to Paris and becomes secretary to the Marquis de la Mole, whose daughter entangles him in a game of passion. The novel paints a portrait of France during the Restoration in the 1830s. Stendhal himself subtitled his novel “A Chronicle of the 19th Century.”\n\nThe Ladies’ Paradise by Émile Zola\n\nThe Ladies’ Paradise is the 11th novel in the Rougon-Macquart series by Émile Zola. This naturalist novel published in 1883 tells of the arrival of department stores in a Paris undergoing Haussmann reconstruction at the beginning of the Third Republic. It is the story of a time when small neighbourhood merchants fought to survive in the face of large stores who were stealing the affluent Parisian clientele. Émile Zola describes the beginnings of capitalist society, where the weakest needed to find their place.\n\nAround the World in Eighty Days by Jules Vernes\n\nDo you want to travel around the whole world in just 300 pages? Jules Verne invites readers to participate in a crazy race across the globe in this adventure novel published in 1872. The London gentleman Phileas Fogg bets half of his fortune that he can go around the world in 80 days. Accompanied by his servant Jean Passepartout, he set off on a unique trip while racing against the clock. Jules Verne gives us an exotic work mixing fiction and true scientific data set in the Industrial Revolution.\n\nThe Princess of Cleves by Madame de La Fayette\n\nPublished anonymously in 1678, The Princess of Cleves is a foundational classic. It depicts Mademoiselle de Chartres’ affairs of the heart after arriving at the court of Henri II at only 15 years old. Between illegitimate romances and heartbreak, it is counted as one of the first modern psychological novels. The book was an immediate success when it was published, and it took months to get a copy. Madame de La Fayette, who frequented the same circles as Madame de Sévigné, inspired some of the greatest authors with her work, such as Balzac and Jean Cocteau.\n\nMadame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert\n\nMadame Bovary is considered one of the first works in literary realism and shocked readers as soon as it was published. It tells the story of Emma, a young wife who tries to escape the boredom caused by her new marital life in a small French town. This story of a country doctor’s wife who lived beyond her means and had adulterous relationships was quickly considered immoral, and author Gustave Flaubert was put on trial by the public prosecutors. Once he was acquitted in 1857, he published his novel which became a resounding success that carries on today.\n\nCandide by Voltaire"
