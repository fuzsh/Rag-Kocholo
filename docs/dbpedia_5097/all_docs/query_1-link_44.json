        "text": "This book traces the trauma of France's colonization of Algeria, which caused Théophile Gautier, Eugène Fromentin, Gustave Flaubert, and Pierre Loti to respond in evocative prose. It seeks \"to uncover the layers of disquiet in the above authors' fiction and travelogues\" (10) as they experience discomfort remembering their time abroad. Their uneasiness recurs due to moral revulsion at the despoliation after recent warfare. An eerie, haunted aspect pervades their writing. In 1845, Gautier began a récit de voyage with Algeria as its focus. His trip was to be illustrated in pictorial and written format. The more Gautier immersed himself in his new setting, the more ill [End Page 247] at ease he became. His sense of self was challenged, he grew disconnected emotionally. A spectral quality permeates his narration, as when he describes an Aissaoui dancer, writhing in demonic tensions, lips quivering, eyes bulging, as nervous vibrations shook his body from top to bottom. Even twenty years later he writes of \"shuddering memories\" (38), still shaken by what he saw. Fromentin made three visits to Algeria between 1846 and 1853. On his third visit he traveled to the freshly conquered town of Laghouat, ravaged by the army. Fromentin's epistolary work, Un été dans le Sahara, is a travel account of the striking natural beauty and brutal aftermath of French conquest, citing for example the bodies of dismembered women dancers. Sainte-Beuve applauded this work for its moral reflection on the depiction of extreme violence as practiced by French soldiers. The novel Salammbô, set in the third century B.C., provides an ancient prototype that for Flaubert reflected contemporary French policies and practices. Even if he did not pointedly draw a parallel between France and Carthage, critics have shown similarities between wealthy Carthaginians and the French ruling class. Both shared commercial, materialist, and imperial concerns. In the novel, extreme violence, sexual depravity, and sadism earned it a reputation for decadence. If atrocities during wartime became the best way to crush resistance, many were haunted by the moral gangrene which had taken hold. Loti published articles and drawings in Parisian journals, as had Gautier and Fromentin. Making repeated visits to Algeria, Loti was devastated by the changes he saw each time he returned: \"The deserted Kasbah, now a place of prostitution and vulgar debauchery! It bewilders the imagination\" (97). Loti's \"Les trois dames\" is a morality tale. A family whose father perished in the war leaves mother and two daughters starving in the Casbah. Three drunken sailors wander looking for some amusement. They spend the night in the house, each sailor with one of the women. By the end of the story we learn that each sailor contracted a virulent form of syphilis that killed one and infected the offspring of the other two. Thus, the effects of colonization literally haunt France like an infection, harming both victor and vanquished. This book is recommended reading for those interested in colonial or nineteenth-century studies."
