        "text": "April 30, 2019\n\nA little repetitive, Gautier has a bit of a one track mind although you might see that as the collection being nicely themed. The main issue is Gautier's languidly descriptive style which can be quite infuriating unless your in a very patient mood.\n\nStill worth the price of admission for the very early vampire tale Clarimonde, aka La Morte Amoureuse (1836).\n\nOctober 10, 2014\n\nThough hyperbolic to a fault, Gautier's collection of stories showed no shortage of color or vocabulary in its parade of fantastic and seemingly anti-realistic characters. Each tale explores a common theme of impossible love grasped at by different men, each readily asserting that the heart above all else is worth living and dying for. The objects of their affection are just that, described for their physical attributes at lengths that definitely tried my patience, and who show little dimension beyond murderous and/or sexual aims. But, this particular artifact of (mostly) bygone misogyny still showed an expertise with language and ancient times that wholly immersed me in the worlds Gautier created. The tapestries he raises are thick with profusions of vocabulary that scale the loftiest levels of indulgence and posturing. It's fun to watch an obvious master dance so well, but the enjoyment is skin-deep (so to speak) when any social or gender awareness is found wanting.\n\nRead\n\nJune 2, 2014\n\nGautier is now chiefly known for Mademoiselle de Maupin, and even there the preface - wherein was immortalised that bold slogan of the aesthetics, \"art for art's sake\" - is better known than the tale itself. A shame, for it's as fine and ridiculous a decadent edifice as one could ever hope to lose oneself inside. These tales...well, hunting in a pack may mean they'll all go hungry. Any one of them, in isolation, might haunt. Taken together, you have half a dozen peculiar young men, each stricken by love for a beautiful woman unattainable through royalty, death or supernatural status (if not some combination of the three). Even read with extensive breaks between stories, the initial sense of strangeness soon becomes a bathetic awareness of the formula. They may feature visions of orgiastic excess, but Gautier's short stories should clearly be taken sparingly.\n\nMarch 15, 2016\n\nI stopped reading this book when the main characters in the first story - One of Cleopatra's Nights - began to seem like nightmare versions of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.\n\nThe author, Theophile Gautier, paints beautiful word pictures. But no matter how spectacular his imagery, too many passages like the following made it impossible for me to persevere:\n\n\"The banks [of the Nile] were desolate, a solemn and mighty sadness weighed upon this land, which was never aught else than a vast tomb, and in which the living appeared to be solely occupied in the work of burying the dead. It was an arid sadness, dry as pumice stone, without melancholy, without reverie, without one pearly gray cloud to follow toward the horizon, one secret spring wherein to lave one's dusty feet; the sadness of a sphinx weary of eternally gazing upon the desert, and unable to detach herself from the granite socle upon which she has sharpened her claws for twenty centuries\".\n\nThat's just two sentences worth!\n\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nOne of Cleopatra's nights--2\n\nClarimonde (aka La Morte Amoureuse, aka The Beautiful Vampire, aka The Dreamland Bride)--2\n\nArria Marcella--2\n\nThe mummy's foot--3\n\nOmphale: a rococo story--3\n\nKing Candaules--2\n\n***\n\nThe nest of nightingales--2\n\nJanuary 21, 2021\n\nModern English readers may likely find \"King Candaules\" the most exciting of the stories in terms of the strength of its narrative, but much of Gautier's writing is so compelling because of his spectacular descriptions and elaborate style, which befits the extravagance of the subject matter, especially in \"One of Cleopatra's Nights\". The shorter stories in between are worth reading for reasons which are unique to each of them, but \"Clarimonde\" deserves special mention: it is of a genre that is well-known to modern readers, and has to be considered one of the greatest of its kind.\n\nApril 4, 2021\n\nI read this for a reading challenge and was entertained- well when I remember this was a male from the 1800s, and he had very little idea of what women really wanted or were like.\n\nI did read that some of these stories were the first of 'supernatural' love ... where the woman wasn't the victim, the man was.\n\nI different look at the world, from a different time.\n\nOctober 8, 2022\n\nThis collection has given me complicated & mixed feelings, review to come.\n\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nI love his style and artistic sense. Male perspective, lack of respect for culture I hate."
