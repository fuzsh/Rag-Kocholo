        "text": "Nerval, a lifelong friend from school, introduced Gautier to Hugo. Nadar was another friend for life; Gautier published many of his photos. Dumas was from the same salon de l’Arsenal côterie. Balzac told Gautier he was talented, Hugo is credited with turning him from painting to literature, and du Camp had a volume of Gautier’s poetry dedicated to him. Gautier wrote about his drug experiences at the Club des Haschischins, which he founded, other members being Delacroix, Baudelaire, Dumas and Nerval. The composers Liszt, Wagner and Meyerbeer were among his correspondents, and Flaubert another friend."
