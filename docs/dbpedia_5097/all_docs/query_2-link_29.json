        "text": "Victor Hugo’s France was one of great turmoil and change. The 19th-century saw Democracy rise and Monarchy fall as well as the Restoration and the July Monarchy. One such reflection of the changes is literature. Throughout the century, French literature enjoyed great success and can be broken up into three literary periods: Romanticism, Realism, and Naturalism. The first half of the century saw Romantic writers used imagination and emotion to fuel their writing in a world that François-René de Chateaubriand claimed was cold and empty. Beside Victor Hugo, Alexandre Dumas represented French Romanticism with his novels of adventure and escapism. During the mid 19th-century, Realism reacted to the Romantic movement with literature accurately depicting French life and society. One such writer who channeled his energy into writing what he saw as truth is Honoré de Balzac. Lastly, the tail end of 19th-century literary movements was Naturalism. French Naturalism rejected Romanticism and instead strove to portray the lives of the working class by writing accurately about their poor living conditions. Émile Zola wrote about the extremes of both the reputable and the disreputable with stark frankness characteristic of the time.\n\nMAIN POINT: In my research of French novelists, my aim was to find what they wrote about and what their goals were. I often came across articles that talked in depth about what certain novelists aimed to achieve. For example, writers like Balzac wrote honestly about what they saw even if it shocked readers. His aim was to shock with reality, more or less like Victor Hugo who tended to be slightly more dramatic with his writing. On the other hand, novelists like George Sand were on the forefront writing about women and what she wanted to be changed in the way society viewed women and laws regarding issues that had to do with women such as divorce and marriage laws. Within the novels of both Balzac and Sand, I found their voices emboldened by their styles of writing and blatant exhibition of their beliefs. In sum, I was able to analyze the role that novels had on French society, which was that novels provided an escape for readers from the problems of their time by reading about the views held by the writers of the novels.\n\nEVIDENCE:\n\n“Finally, these novelists are still valued highly because they are able to combine the illusion of reality with imaginative boldness, and because their language is more inventive and their novel-structures more skillful than those of those contemporaries” (Finch 36). This quote describes why exactly the French novel triumphs over its counterparts that were perhaps more popular and more widely read. This quote explains that the novels of Balzac and others go beyond the stereotypes of their time and move between the dramatic and the comic without using much melodrama or sentimentality- unlike those of female novelists.\n\n2. “The post-Revolutionary sentimental novel is structured around a conflict between two equally valuable moral imperatives: first, the imperative to build and sustain the collective social order which these novels represent as duty to the family; and second, the natural imperative to happiness; the imperative to pursue individual freedom and be true to what these novels call the ‘heart’” (Cohen 56). This quote refers to the French female novelist tradition, which tends to involve a sentimental code that novels by French males do not. The sentimental novel captures the air of post-Revolutionary France well because it addresses the problems in the political theory and practice of its time. The article goes on to describe female writers and their overwhelming popularity and then fall once realism started to emerge.\n\n3. “Nothing is so easy as to deceive one’s self when one does not lack wit and is familiar with all the niceties of language. Language is a prostitute queen who descends and rises to all roles. Disguises herself, arrays herself in fine apparel, hides her head and effaces herself; an advocate who has an answer for everything, who has always foreseen everything, and who assumes a thousand forms in order to be right. The most honorable of men is he who thinks best and acts best, but the most powerful is he who is best able to talk and write” (Sand 47). An excerpt from one of George Sand’s best known novels that exemplifies the sentimentality in her writing. Here, Sand’s biting words refers to the lofty language often used by male writers who are now often more well-known than female French writers. Sand’s novel serves as a plea for the way women are viewed by French society and calls for vast social change that includes a change in French marriage laws.\n\n4. “Holding this book in your hand, sinking back in your soft armchair, you will say to yourself: perhaps it will amuse me. And after you have read this story of great misfortunes, you will no doubt dine well, blaming the author for your own insensitivity, accusing him of wild exaggeration and flights of fancy. But rest assured: this tragedy is not a fiction. All is true” (Balzac 3). This quote exemplifies the dissertation that many of the male French novelists of the time had a large influence on the French public because of their no-nonsense honest writing that used the real to evoke a reaction in readers instead of sentimentality.\n\nCONNECTIONS: There are many ways in which these documents aid my research. The first source helps to delve into literature and its influence much deeper that the superficiality that are the novels themselves. The book contains articles that examine the time period of 19th century France and provides samples from the most essential novels of the time to aid various discussions centered around the different existing types of novels. The second and third sources relate to my research in that they are the foundation that my research is based upon. They provide the most basic examples of writing and will be used to bring to life my webpage.\n\nM.I.T. (most interesting thing): note one aspect of each document that you found to be the most interesting. [THIS OFTEN CAN SERVE AS A POINT OF DEPARTURE OR BASIS FOR YOUR INTERPRETIVE THEME, CONCLUSION, AND MAIN POINT.]\n\nThe most interesting thing I found in “The Cambridge Companion to the French novel: from 1800 to the present” was the idea that female French novelists tended to write more about the emotional aspects of their time while male French novelists tended to try and be more objective about their portrayals of French society during the 1800s. This serves as a vast divide between the different styles of writing and how different female and male novelists were treated.\n\nThe most interesting thing I found about “Indiana” by George Sand is the portrayal of how women were treated by men coming from a female writer. Though many female French writers enjoyed success in the 19th century, they were still outnumbered by the male French writers of their time and many of those male writers did portray women. I think it is especially imperative to compare the treatment of different subjects, such as female rights, by men and women alike.\n\nPROMPTINGS/REFLECTIONS: One idea I came up while reading these primary sources was to explore the vast divide between novels by females and novels by males.\n\nEVALUATION: State brief answers to these questions:\n\nThese sources revealed the complexity of issues surrounding their time. More than the summary of a novel, the novels themselves gave a point of view that allowed me to see the general views held by the writers and to see how they treated different subjects. With “The Cambridge Companion” I was able to see what was underneath the skin of the novels, that is what more they can reveal about the time they were written during and how they effected French society.\n\nAll of my sources contain suitable evidence to support my conclusion and main point in that they all are multi-faceted and bring into focus the most important ideas.\n\nI must remember with writers that often they only express the point of view they most believe in and often fail to explore beliefs, ideas, and subject matters that go beyond what they most are apt to write about.\n\nCONCLUSION: the overarching significance of 19th century French novelists cannot be understated. French novelists of all genres, backgrounds, and beliefs played a rather large role in the influencing of public opinion and continue to inspire generations from all over the world to this day because they are so influential in content and in style. It is evident that the French novels that are still well-known today are so because they artfully blended the illusion of reality with bold imagination that evoked both interest and outrage in the novel’s subject matters.\n\nKEY TERMS OR VOCABULARY:\n\nRealist: Realism is the trend, beginning with mid 19th century French literature and extending to late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century authors, toward depictions of contemporary life and society as it was, or is. In the spirit of general realism, Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of a romanticized or similarly stylized presentation.\n\nSentimentalism: Sentimentalism is the practice of being sentimental, or the tendency to be governed by feelings instead of reason."
