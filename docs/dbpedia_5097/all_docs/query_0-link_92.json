While themodel of the stable single author that prevailed during the Romanticperiod dominates the beginning of the century, the authority of thespeaking subject is increasingly in crisis through the century'spolitical and social upheavals. Chapters consider the breakdown ofauthorial presence across different constructions of authorship,including the numerous cenacles of the Romantic period; collaborativeventures in poetry through the practice of the \"Tombeaux\" and as seenin the Album zutique; the interplay of text and image throughillustrations for literary works; the collective ventures of literaryjournals; and multi-author prose works by authors such as the Goncourtbrothers and Erckmann-Chatrian. Interdisciplinary in scope, theseessays form a cohesive investigation of collaboration that extendsbeyond literature to include journalism and the relationships andtensions between literature and the arts. The volume will interestscholars of nineteenth-century French literature, and more generally,any scholar interested in what's at stake in redefining the role of theFrench author\n\nSommaire:\n\nIntroduction: on collaboration, SethWhidden; Collaboration Before the Revolution: How often did authorswrite alone?: ways of becoming an author in early modern France, JoanDeJean; ''Le dîner des philosophes'': conviviality and collaboration inthe French Enlightenment, John R.
