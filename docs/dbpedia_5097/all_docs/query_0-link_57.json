        "meta_description": "This article considers the representation of catalepsy—a trance-like nervous condition characterised by rigidity of the limbs that resembles death—in the literature of 19th-century France. It begins with an overview of the medical literature on catalepsy and its influence on the literature of the period, which reveals a particularly gendered aspect to the fate of the cataleptic, before turning to its primary case study: George Sand’s Consuelo novels (1842–44). These two texts provide Sand’s most sustained engagement with catalepsy, but they also set Sand’s depiction of the condition apart from how her (male) contemporaries represented it. While in the work of writers like Honoré de Balzac (1799–1850), Jules Barbey d’Aurevilly (1808–89), Théophile Gautier (1811–72), and Émile Zola (1840–1902) the cataleptic is generally an unstable male genius whose tale ends in death, madness, or oblivion, Sand elaborates an alternative model that allows these superior individuals to find self-actualisation (irrespective of their gender). The occult knowledge associated with the cataleptic is not to be feared in Sand’s texts; rather, it provides personal fulfilment and offers new purpose that benefits society. Catalepsy in Sand’s texts is thus endowed with political significance, representing the potential for new beginnings and a move beyond traditional ways of being. Drawing on the Consuelo novels as a model, this article then turns to Sand’s wider oeuvre to posit the poetics of the ‘cataleptic novel’ as inherent to Sand’s literary enterprise.Featured Image:&nbsp;A photograph of Marie 'Blanche' Wittman in a cataleptic pose taken around 1880, in&nbsp;Iconographie photographique de la Salpêtrière: service de M.

        "text": "As the recent Routledge Companion to Death and Literature reminds us, death has provided an object of literary fascination since the dawn of literature itself, transcending genre, era, and culture (Wang, Jernigan and Murphy, 2021). If literature has long offered ways of thinking through the inevitability of death, it has also had to contend with its unknowability. Philippe Ariès locates the 18th and 19th centuries as moments of new explorations of our relationship to death in Western societies (1974: 55–56), and this manifests itself in the literature of the period, which routinely presents death scenes. Yet, as Elisabeth Bronfen cautions, death can never be anything more than a cultural construct since it lies beyond the realm of any living person’s experience (1992: 54). In this light, catalepsy, as a form of living death, presents a peculiar aberration. Catalepsy is a neurological condition in which the sufferer’s muscles become rigid and they cease responding to external stimuli. As such, catalepsy resembles death, and literary depictions dwell on the possible forms of knowledge such an apparent return from death might entail: as we will see, catalepsy is frequently associated with almost occult access to the beyond. The literary potential of such possible knowledge seems to have been irresistible to 19th-century writers in the West: despite the relative rarity of the condition, it holds a particular place in the literary imagination of the period.\n\nThe evolving representations and imaginative engagements with death in the literature of 19th-century France were accompanied by another crucial development that contributed to catalepsy’s status in the period: the 19th century was also the golden age of French psychiatric science (Goldstein, 1987: 1). This article will offer a survey of the representations of catalepsy in 19th-century French texts to establish the various representational practices with which catalepsy was associated in the period, before focusing on the work of the century’s foremost female novelist, George Sand, pseudonym of Amantine Aurore Lucile Dupin (1804–76). In scholarship on Sand, catalepsy is typically considered in passing, if at all, in relation to her Consuelo novels (Consuelo and its sequel, La Comtesse de Rudolstadt [The Countess of Rudolstadt], both published serially in La Revue indépendante between 1842 and 1844), and usually evoked as a mere plot device. Placing Sand’s cataleptics alongside those of her (male) contemporaries reveals that Sand’s use of catalepsy is indicative of a wider narrative practice on her part; one that subverts expected approaches to death in the 19th-century novel.\n\nIn his articulation of a literary masterplot, Peter Brooks asserts that literary texts, and especially 19th-century realist texts, are underpinned by a structure that resembles Freud’s death drive (1992: 90–112), an impulse Freud posited as a means of understanding our desire to repeat traumatic experiences even though this seemingly contradicts our desire for pleasure. The satisfaction associated with repeating these traumatic experiences suggested to Freud that, in truth, what we hoped for was death. Brooks identifies a similar urge at work in the 19th-century death scene:\n\nWhatever their specific content, and whatever their degree of tragic awareness or melodramatic enunciation, all such scenes offer the promise of a significant retrospect, a summing-up, the coming to completion of a fully predicated, and readable, sentence (1992: 96).\n\nDeath, in Brooks’s formulation, provides novels with a satisfying sense of finality, one that Sand’s cataleptic texts playfully undermine.\n\nMore recently, Enda McCaffrey and Steven Wilson have suggested that French literature shifted in the 20th century to explore more fully the experience of dying, a shift they identify as part of a broader socio-cultural turn. They contrast this with the representation of death in the 19th century, when it figured ‘more often than not as a trope allowing for the ultimate neat ending, or a commentary on the fate of a seemingly subversive protagonist’ (2021: 3). If the novel is indeed organised around the death drive, an analysis of Sand’s cataleptics contrarily suggests that her novels offer a determined resistance to such narrative superstructures. This resistance has a gendered dynamic, shifting away from the tradition of death and marriage as the typical endings for women in fiction. Catalepsy, in Sand’s configuration, is doubly political: the Sandian cataleptic usually returns from their ‘death’ to engage in acts of political resistance, but Sand’s use of catalepsy itself also subverts dominant 19th-century narrative tropes by destabilising traditional narrative endings: endings that replicate models of masculine domination. This article will suggest, therefore, that catalepsy is far more than a mere plot device in Sand’s texts, and that it offers a useful way of thinking through Sand’s poetics and ideology, such that we might even consider her texts to be ‘cataleptic novels’.\n\nNotes\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nI would like to extend my thanks to Kit Yee Wong, the general editor of this Special Collection, for her support of this article and her helpful comments at the various stages of its production.
