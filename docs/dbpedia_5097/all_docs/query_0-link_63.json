        "text": "Bibliography\n\nby Pauline de Tholozany\n\nPh.D., Brown University 2011\n\nThis annotated bibliography is designed for undergraduate students doing research on Paris in the nineteenth century. It has sections on Visual Arts, Architecture, Urbanism, Literature, Music, and History, and therefore can be useful for a wide range of subjects. An independent section is dedicated to the Arcades Project, since the book touches on all of the disciplines listed above.\n\nThe bibliography is meant to be consulted online, with hyperlinks that will allow the users to click directly on the section that is of particular interest to them. It is also available as a PDF printable version.\n\nIn each section the books are arranged alphabetically. Titles are hyperlinks that will take the user directly to the bibliographic record in Josiah. They are followed by the location of the book on the Brown campus (Rockefeller Library, Hay Library, Science Library, and Orwig Library, mainly). A short commentary describes the content of the book listed.\n\nBooks that relate to two or more topics are cross-listed and will appear in more than one section. This happens particularly in the subdivisions of the History section, which is the longest and which encompasses a wider range of topics. If a book is cross-listed, the bibliographic references will be followed by a note indicating in which other sections the book is mentioned. Here is an example of a book listed in two subdivisions of the History section (“Foreigners and Exiled”/”Political History”). In the “Foreigners and Exiled” section, it will appear as follows:\n\nKATZ, PHILIP MARK. From Appomattox to Montmartre: Americans and the Paris Commune.

Dictionnaire des monuments de Paris. Paris : Editions Hervas, 1993.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume has a 20 pages introduction about the development of the city from the roman era to the present. The dictionary has entries about the history of streets, piazzas, avenues and arcades. It also lists buildings (libraries, schools, hotels and restaurants) and has several entries about the main parks and gardens of the capital.\n\nFIERRO, ALFRED. Historical Dictionary of Paris. Lanham, Md.: Scarecrow Press, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nA dictionary of monuments, places, and political figures related to Paris, from the Roman Era to the present. The book has a short introduction about French History, and a very good bibliography (nearly 50 pages, classified according to themes such as politics, urbanism, society, culture, economy, Americans in Paris). At the end of the volume, there is also a whole set of statistics about population, number of streets, foreigners in Paris, tourism, housing, etc.\n\nHILLAIRET, JACQUES. Dictionnaire historique des rues de Paris. Vol.1-2. Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1963.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is one of the most complete dictionaries on the subject. There is a fifty page introduction at the beginning of the first volume: the text covers roughly the story of the capital’s urbanization and the evolution of the city from the Romans until today. The book has sections dealing with specific topics (such as “Graveyards”, “Transportations”, “schools”), and providing a brief chronological outline for each entry. The dictionary itself is extremely complete and precise: the author provides a detailed description for each street, and then describes its history. He also makes an inventory of the houses and of their numbers, sometimes describing facades that are particularly meaningful. He also specifies who built the houses, who lived in them, and how the streets were named. At the end of each volume, the book has a list of ancient street names, and of their contemporary counterparts.\n\nLAZARE, FELIX & LOUIS. Dictionnaire administratif des rues et des monuments de Paris. 1855 (2nd ed). Paris : Editions Maisonneuve et Larose, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nFelix and Louis Lazare both worked for the city council of Paris before Haussmann started his urbanization plans. They both lamented his project, and the project of the Dictionnaire consisted in recording as much data as possible, before Paris was irrevocably transformed. The volume contains information about various things such as water plants, sewers, gas lightning, and statistics about streets and carriages in the capital. It also has population studies, and includes data about consumption in Paris in the 1850’s.\n\nThe Arcades Project [ top ]\n\nThe Arcades Project\n\nBENJAMIN, WALTER. The Arcades Project. Cambridge, Mass.; London : Harvard University Press, 2002.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nIt is difficult to classify The Arcades Project, because it is a work that deals with many aspects of Parisian life in the nineteenth century: consumerism, Art, fashion, Architecture, Politics, Philosophy, Poetry and Literature, among others. It is a succession of notes, and a collection of quotes and thoughts about consumer culture and its links to modernity. Benjamin started this book in 1927, and it remained a work in progress for the next thirteen years. It was published posthumously in 1980.\n\nBENJAMIN, WALTER. Das Passagen-Werk.

They all present contemporary views on Benjamin’s works, and they deal with subjects such as fashion, architecture, and the streets of Paris.\n\nRICHTER, GERHARD, ed. Benjamin’s Ghosts: Interventions in Contemporary Literary and Cultural Theory. Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2002.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is a collection of articles about Benjamin’s works. For Richter (the editor of the volume) some of Benjamin’s concepts function as “ghosts”, in the sense that they can never be, and are not intended to be, fully grasped or circumscribed. This happens in particular with the notions of Culture and History, two concepts that are recurring tropes in the introduction and in the articles: how do we understand these fragmented, dispersed concepts? The book is divided into four sections: “Culture of the image”, “Textualities of experience”, “Rethinking history”, and “Figures of finitude”.\n\nArchitecture [ top ]\n\nGeneral works\n\nCOUPERIE, PIERRE.

For each time period, there is a map of Paris on the left page, while the right page has information on specific buildings built at that period. It is a good place to start reading about the development of urbanism and Architecture in Paris.\n\nLEMOINE, BERTRAND. Architecture in France, 1800-1900. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book deals with French Architecture in the nineteenth century. It is not restricted to Paris: it includes many examples of buildings from Lyon, Toulouse, Bordeaux, and several other cities. It is very well illustrated, and the text gives a general idea of Architecture in nineteenth century France.\n\nLOYER, FRANÇOIS. Paris Nineteenth Century: Architecture and Urbanism. New York: Abbeville Press, c1988.\n\nCross-listed with Urbanism.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume gives a chronological history of urbanism and Architecture in Paris. It has many reproductions of plans, elevations, and architectural details. The book deals with different types and styles of buildings, as well as with topics such as apartment layouts, room distribution, individual houses, and gardens.\n\nLOYER, FRANÇOIS.

Architecture of the Nineteenth Century. Köln: Evergreen Benedikt Taschen, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nA very complete survey of nineteenth century Architecture in Europe and in the United States, with many references to Paris. The book starts with chapters dealing with different architectural styles, explaining their motifs and their aesthetic postulates. Several of the following chapters focus on various types of buildings. There are long sections on shopping arcades in Paris, railway stations, prisons, and hospitals.\n\nPEROUSE DE MONTCLOS, JEAN-MARIE. Paris City of Art. New York: Vendôme Press, 2003.\n\nCross-listed with Fine Arts – General Works.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis 700 page book deals with the History of Art and Architecture in Paris from the Roman era to the present. The author discusses Art and Architecture in relation to the History of Paris. There are many illustrations with notes and descriptions. The third part of the volume is entitled “Contemporary era”, and focuses on Art in Paris during the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth. These chapters would be a good place to start reading about Architecture and Fine Arts in Paris. There are several sections that could be particularly useful to acquire a general idea of the topic: “Architecture, between orthodoxy and public opinion”, “Urban development and private building”, as well as the sections on Painting, Sculpture, and on the industrialization of Art.\n\nPEROUSE DE MONTCLOS, JEAN-MARIE. Paris. Paris: Hachette, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book works like a dictionary: the author gives a description as well as a summary of each building’s history. There are maps, prints, and photographs to illustrate the various stages and transformations of the buildings. It includes summaries of many monuments’ history.\n\nArchitecture [ top ]\n\nBooks on specific topics\n\nACCOLTI GIL, BIAGIO. Paris: vestibules de l’éclectisme. Paris: Vilo Editeur, 1982.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book deals with vestibules and entrance halls of Parisian buildings in the nineteenth century. It analyses the relation between facades and interiors, and how it was linked to Haussmann’s work in Paris. The author argues that entrance halls, which used to reflect one’s social position, were no longer spaces of display after Haussmann: instead, they became common spaces, and were a sign of the shift from the aristocratic way of life to the bourgeois lifestyle.\n\nBABOULET, LUC, ed. Le Paris des maisons: objets trouvés. Paris: Picard; Pavillon de l'arsenal, 2004.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is not specifically about the nineteenth century, but several chapters could be very interesting for someone working on the private sphere and the emergence of the domestic space during that period. This is a collection of articles on various subjects related to private dwelling. Several types of buildings are analyzed: the “hôtel particulier”, the villa in the suburbs of Paris, and collective dwellings, among many others. The texts deal with the representation of the private sphere and its architectural incarnations.\n\nBORSI, FRANCO. Paris 1900: Architecture and Design. New York: Rizzoli, 1989.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nA book about Art Nouveau, and its philosophical/political implications. The introduction analyses how it was perceived as a threat to nationalism. There is also a chapter on the 1889 universal exhibit.\n\nBRESC-BAUTIER, GENEVIEVE. Le photographe et l’architecte: Edouard Baldus, Hector-Martin Lefuel et le chantier du nouveau Louvre de Napoléon III. Paris: Éditions de la Réunion des Musées nationaux, 1995.\n\nCross-listed with Fine Arts – Photography\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book documents the constructions in the Louvre under Napoléon III. The book comments both on Lefuel’s (the architect in charge) plans and buildings and on Baldus’ photographs of the process. Baldus was hired by the Emperor to document the demolition and construction around the Louvre, and several albums were created with his photographs. The first chapter deals with the photographer’s task of documenting the progression of Lefuel’s work, and the second chapter gives a detailed chronology of the construction of the Imperial Louvre. The last two chapters discuss both the exterior decorations and the interiors of the new Louvre, giving insights from the architect and the photographer’s perspective.\n\nCANTELLI, MARILU. L’illusion monumentale: Paris, 1872-1936. Liège: Mardaga, 1991.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis text questions the notion of « monument », and how it shifted after Haussmann’s transformation of Paris. The author argues that in the bourgeois buildings, the monumental characteristic is displaced to the outside ornaments. She calls “monumentalité mineure” the transformation of the concept by the bourgeois culture.\n\nDes grands chantiers… Hier. Photographies, dessin: outils de l’architecte et de l’ingénieur autour de 1900. Paris: Mairie de Paris, direction des affaires culturelles, 1988.\n\nCross-listed with Fine Arts – Photography\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book explores the relations between photographs (and, to a lesser degree, drawings) and Architecture at the end of the nineteenth century. It is the catalog of an exhibit held in 1988-1989. It contains little text (except for a few opening essays on the photographer Albert Fernique and on the architect Jean-Camille Formigé). The rest of the book is a catalog with many reproductions of the photographs that were part of the exhibit. There are sections on the first uses of photography in Architecture, on the photographers’ roles in the urban construction sites (particularly Paris), on metal Architecture, Universal Exhibits, and on the way photography influenced the architectural drawing. A few of these photographs are accompanied by a short commentary.\n\nDUMONT, MARIE-JEANNE. Le logement social à Paris, 1850-1930. Les habitations à bon marché. Liège: Pierre Mardaga éditeur, 1991.\n\nCross-listed with History – Classifying and Policing: Social Classes and Social Types.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nDuring the Third Republic, the French government started to build many apartment houses for city workers from the middle and lower classes. The author argues that Architecture books usually give little attention to these buildings. Dumont’s aim in this book is to describe the evolution of this specific type of construction, as well as the way of life it presupposed. She shows how the houses were built according to new sanitary norms, how they were adapted to family life, and how the rooms were usually distributed in an apartment. The book is extensively illustrated, giving many examples of maps, plans, inside views, and photographs.\n\nLERI, JEAN-MARC, EMMANUEL DAYDE, AND JACQUELINE LAFARGUE. Du palais au palace. Des grands hôtels de voyageurs à Paris au XIXe siècle. Paris: ACR: Paris Musées, 1998.\n\nCross-listed with History – The Emergence of Mass Culture – Mass Culture and Consumer Society.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book was published on the occasion of a 1999 exhibit at the Musée Carnavalet. It is more a synthesis on the subject than a classic exhibit catalogue. It deals mainly with the hotels’ architectural features: size, interiors, decoration, and organization of the rooms. Through many examples, the book shows the evolution in the way hotels were built, and how the American model influenced French Architecture and affected the building of larger hotels during the Second Empire (such as the Grand Hôtel du Louvre, which contained almost 700 rooms). The book starts with a section on the Consulate and on the Empire; it analyzes the evolution of different types of buildings through several case studies. There are also sections on hotels in the vicinity of train stations, on the “palace” (this model is illustrated by the Hôtel Ritz), and on the hotels’ staff.\n\nMARREY, BERNARD. Le fer à Paris. Paris: Picard : Pavillon de l'Arsenal, 1989.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nBernard Marrey retraces the history of iron in Parisian Architecture. Most of the book deals with nineteenth-century Paris, since it is at that time that iron became a visible material in public buildings. The author raises several important questions about iron and Architecture: why is it that before the nineteenth century, iron was never displayed in the facades of buildings? It was used extensively in Architecture before, but only as a framework, and most of the time it was hidden under stones or bricks. Iron started to become “visible” in the nineteenth century, but curiously, only in public buildings such as libraries, train stations or arcades.\n\nMARREY, BERNARD. La brique à Paris. Paris: Editions du Pavillon de l'Arsenal: Picard, 1991.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyses the role of brick in Parisian architecture. After being abandoned by the eighteenth-century architects, brick was used extensively in the nineteenth century, either on its own on in conjunction with stone, for both collective and private buildings. Each chapter has a short introduction, and then gives a list of the buildings which are relevant to the topic.\n\nMARREY, BERNARD. Les grands magasins: des origines à 1939. Paris: Picard, 1979\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nHere Bernard Marrey develops the subject of commerce, trade, capitalism, and their relations to the architecture of arcades, shops, and department stores. The first chapters give a chronological background to the history of department stores and arcades from the revolution until the 1930’s. The following chapters deal each with a different department store, explaining the history of the building and its architectural structure.\n\nMEAD, CHRISTOPHER CURTIS. Charles Garnier's Paris Opéra: Architectural Empathy and the Renaissance of French Classicism. New York, N.Y.: Architectural History Foundation; Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1991.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nA very readable history of the Opéra Garnier. The author starts with a biography of Charles Garnier, and then deals with his architectural theories. He then describes some of the projects for the building of the Opera, after which he focuses again on Garnier and on the stages in the construction of the building.\n\nMUSÉE NATIONAL DES MONUMENTS FRANÇAIS. Photographier l’architecture, 1851-1920. Collection du musée des Monuments français. Paris: Éditions de la Réunion des musées nationaux, distribution Seuil, 1994.\n\nCross-listed with Fine Arts – Photography\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is the catalogue of an exhibit held in 1994 about the relations between Architecture and Photography. The catalogue itself is preceded by short essays on Photography and Architecture. It is then divided into sections with themes such as the representation of Paris, the Mission Héliographique, the discovery of the Orient, etc... The commentary texts and the choice of photographs that are reproduced focus particularly on the 1851 Mission Héliographique, a project commissioned by the state and whose aim was to gather photographs that would document the changing cityscapes of France. It involved famous photographers who were then beginning their careers, such as Le Secq, Le Gray, or Baldus. The catalogue also has a section on Marville, who is particularly famous for his 1865 work, L’album du vieux Paris. This project had also been commissioned by the state, in order to document the changing streets of the old Paris which were about to disappear.\n\nOLSEN, DONALD J. The City as a Work of Art: London, Paris, Vienna. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1986.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nCross-listed with Urbanism.\n\nOlsen argues that cities are “complex but legible documents that can tell us something about the values and aspirations of their rulers”. His analysis is political: he understands the rise of national capitals as concomitant to that of the nation state. Olsen tries to think about architecture in relation to political projects and social issues. At the end of the book, he also analyses the city and its relation to domestic space: for him, the two main conceptual models of the nineteenth century are the family on the one hand, and the nation state on the other, both of them being mirrored in architecture.\n\nVAN ZANTEN, David. Building Paris: Architectural Institutions and the Transformation of the French capital, 1830-1870. Cambridge, England; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1994.\n\nCross-listed with Urbanism\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThe author shows how the French government and the state institutions played a crucial role in the nineteenth century, both in public and in private Architecture. For a very long time indeed, state Architecture was particularly influential and would set a tone for the whole nation in terms of style. However, Van Zanten argues that little by little, innovations started to happen in the private sphere. The rise of Art Nouveau is particularly significant, since it was the first style that originated in private Architecture. There are chapters on subjects such as representational buildings (palaces or state buildings), and private versus institutional buildings. Van Zanten also concentrates extensively on the “Quartier de l’Opéra”, and on government architectural services and policies.\n\nVAN ZANTEN, DAVID. Designing Paris: the Architecture of Duban, Labrouste, Duc, and Vaudoyer. Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1987.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is a study of the aesthetic theories and architectural achievements of four prominent architects in the Second Empire: Duban, Labrouste, Duc, and Vaudoyer. The four of them were sent to the French Academy in Rome, where they shared many architectural principles and innovations. The author follows a chronological approach to describe their lives and works, after which he dedicates one chapter to each of the four architects’ most famous building. There is, for instance, a whole chapter on Labrouste’s Bibliothèque Nationale.\n\nUrbanism & City Planning [ top ]\n\nGeneral works\n\nCHRIST, YVAN. Les métamorphoses de Paris.

Napoleon III and the Rebuilding of Paris. Princeton, N. J. : Princeton University Press, 1958.\n\nLOCATION: Annex / Electronic resource: http://josiah.brown.edu/record=b4164439\n\nThis book is a very good synthesis of Napoleon III’s urban policy in Paris. The volume covers roughly the period between 1850 and 1871. It gives information about the implementation of Haussmann’s plans, and about the political project that triggered them. There are also chapters on water and sewer systems, on underground Paris, and on the financing of Haussmann’s project.\n\nSZAMBIEN, WERNER. De la rue des colonnes à la rue de Rivoli.

The book has a chronological pattern, and describes Haussmann’s career and his successive jobs in the French administration, insisting mainly on the years when he was Préfet de Paris. The last section of the book deals specifically with the transformation of Paris, how it was implemented, and how it affected private dwelling.\n\nCARMONA, MICHEL. Haussmann.

Volume 4 (entitled Le temps de l’éloquence, 1775-1825), focuses mainly on Classicism, Historical painting, the Arts under Napoleon and the beginnings of museography. The fifth volume (entitled Le XIXe Siècle, 1819-1905) has chapters on French Romanticism and Realism, as well as a long section on Paris and the emergence of the modern city.\n\nCHU, PETRA TEN-DOESSCHATE. Nineteenth Century European Art. Upper Saddle River, NJ : Prentice Hall, 2006.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nAlthough this book is about European Art, the majority of its chapters deal with France. It is an excellent synthesis of artistic movements from the end of the enlightenment to the period known in France as “la belle époque”. This work replaces French Art in a European perspective, and it also analyses artistic practices in relation to History and to the political context of the time. It is very well illustrated, and each chapter has a very complete bibliography (divided into the following sections: general works, primary sources, monographs and catalogues, films and videos).\n\nCHU, PETRA TEN-DOESSCHATE, AND GABRIEL P.

Nineteenth Century Art: A Critical History. New York, N.Y.: Thames and Hudson, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is divided into four sections: “Classicism and Romanticism”, “New World frontiers”, “Realism and Naturalism”, “Modern Art and life”. The text is not organized chronologically, but rather according to themes and concepts. This book would be a very good starting point to examine the artistic theories of the nineteenth century.\n\nFRASCINA, FRANCIS, et. al. Modernity and Modernism: French Painting in the Nineteenth Century. New Haven: Yale University Press, in association with the Open University, 1993.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book questions the definition of the modern and of modern painting as opposed to academic painting. It covers the second half of nineteenth century Art, and most particularly Realism and Impressionism. There is also a section about gender and representation, in which the author studies the role of women in these two artistic movements. Although it deals with very specific art theories, this book remains very approachable.\n\nNineteenth Century Art Worldwide. A Journal of Nineteenth Century Visual Culture. College Park, MD: Association of Historians of Nineteenth-Century Art, 2002-.\n\nLOCATION: Electronic resource.\n\nThis journal is published twice a year, and contains articles on nineteenth century Art, as well as essays on subjects like fashion, the representation of women, and visual culture in general. Many of the essays focus on one work in particular, and give a detailed analysis of it. But there are also articles about more general patterns, including a very interesting special issue about the influence of Darwin’s theories on Art.\n\nOxford Art Online. 1998. Laura Macy. Oxford University, England: Oxford University Press. http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/\n\nOxford Art Online (formerly Grove Art Online) is both a dictionary of Art terms and a repertory of artists from all over the world. For each artist the database gives a detailed biography, a bibliography, and a description of the main characteristics of his or her work. One can also look for technical terms and names of artistic movements (Realism, Impressionism, Classicism, etc.).\n\nPEROUSE DE MONTCLOS, JEAN-MARIE. Paris City of Art. New York: Vendôme Press, 2003.\n\nCross-listed with Architecture\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis 700 page book deals with the History of Art and Architecture in Paris from the Roman era to the present. The author discusses Art and Architecture in relation to the History of Paris. There are many illustrations with notes and descriptions. The third part of the volume is entitled “Contemporary era”, and focuses on Art in Paris during the nineteenth century and at the beginning of the twentieth. These chapters would be a good place to start reading about Architecture and Fine Arts in Paris. There are several sections that could be particularly useful to acquire a general idea of the topic: “Architecture, between orthodoxy and public opinion”, “Urban development and private building”, as well as the sections on Painting, Sculpture, and on the industrialization of Art.\n\nROSEMBLUM, ROBERT. 19th Century Art. New York: Abrams, 1984.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nUnlike Eisenman’s book on the same topic, this volume is organized chronologically, each chapter covering two to three decades of the century. In each chapter, there is a section on painting and one on sculpture, and these sections are themselves divided into various parts, one for each country. This book is a descriptive introduction to Art in the Nineteenth century.\n\nTUFFELI, NICOLE. Nineteenth Century French Art. Edinburgh: Chambers, 2004.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nAn excellent synthesis of the evolution of Painting, Sculpture, and Photography in the nineteenth century. In a hundred pages, the author gives a concise panorama of the Arts during that period. It is well illustrated, and there is a selective bibliography of works on the same topic at the end of the book.\n\nVAUGHAN, WILLIAM. Arts of the 19th Century. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1998-1999. v. 1. 1780 to 1850 -- v. 2. 1850-1905.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThese two volumes deal with Nineteenth Century Art, mainly in Europe and in the United States. The first volume covers the period between 1780 and 1850, and the second volume focuses on the years between 1850 and 1905. The chapters are not organized in a chronological order, but rather according to genres, or techniques: historical painting, portraits, nature paintings, sculpture, graphic arts. In every chapter there is a section for each country. These two volumes have many full page illustrations.\n\nFine Arts [ top ]\n\nArt and Politics\n\nAGULHON, MAURICE.

Art in an Age of Bonapartism. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume looks at the Arts (painting in particular) in conjunction with historical and political events.

Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2004.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book follows the preceding volume on Napoleon, but this time it deals both with Europe and the United States. It has many chapters on France, and deals with the Arts under Charles X and under the July Monarchy. It also deals with graphic Arts and Photography.\n\nBOIME, ALBERT. Art and the French Commune. Imagining Paris after War and Revolution. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1995.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book looks at Impressionism and its relation to the Paris Commune. Boime argues that although many Art books mention the Commune as a political context, very few critics try to consider the influence that the events could have had on the impressionists’ art, which developed right after the Commune events. He focuses on the decade between 1870 and 1880, and argues that the political changes after the Commune encouraged the painters to focus even more on modern and everyday life subjects. It also led the way to a more favorable reception of the Impressionists’ art. There are chapters on the critical reception of the paintings, on the impact of the commune on the Impressionists, and on their artistic, aesthetic, and political agenda.\n\nPORTERFIELD, TODD B. The Allure of Empire: Art in the service of French Imperialism. Princeton N.J: Princeton University Press, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is about French Orientalism in Arts and in politics at the beginning of the Nineteenth Century. It links colonization to Orientalism, and shows how politics and military conquests are linked to Orientalism as it manifested itself in the Arts. There are chapters on the Obelisk at the Place de la Concorde, as well as on representations of Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign, on the Musée d’Egypte, and on the Women of Algiers, a recurring theme in the paintings of the time.\n\nFine Arts [ top ]\n\nNeoclassicism\n\nCLIFTON-MOGG, CAROLINE.

Crow comments on the influence they had on each other, and on the family-like relationship Drouais and Girodet had with David. He dwells in particular on the theme of the father figure, and explains how it emerges in many of their works.\n\nIRWIN, DAVID G. Neoclassicism. London: Phaidon, 1997.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is a richly illustrated history of Neoclassicism in Europe, destined for non-specialists. The book deals with practices associated with Neoclassicism (collecting, archaeological practices, the “Grand Tour”) as well as with the fields it influenced: public and private architecture, landscape painting, historical and political painting, and interior decoration.\n\nMONNERET, SOPHIE. David and Neoclassicism. Paris: Terrail, 1999.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is a chronological study of Jacques Louis David’s work, and of his role in Neoclassicism. The author analyzes his most famous paintings, but the focus is primarily on David’s life and career.\n\nWEST, ALLISON. From Pigalle to Préault. Neoclassicism and the Sublime in French Sculpture: 1760-1840. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nIn this book about French Neoclassical Sculpture, the author argues that with the emergence of a new style, new themes were developed. She particularly insists on the new concept of “secular mortality”, and on the fact that the religious tradition lost ground as an implicit moral value behind the work of Art. On the other side, because Neoclassicism primarily represented antique figures, the author argues that the representation of Royal figures became less pervasive in the public sphere. This chronological study also takes into account the Roman and Greek sources which greatly inspired these sculptors. The last chapter of the book deals with the Elgin Marbles and the influence of their discovery on Neoclassical Sculpture.\n\nFine Arts [ top ]\n\nRomanticism\n\nBENOIST, LUC. La sculpture romantique. Paris: Gallimard, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nA 300 page book about French Romantic sculpture, with chapters on Lyricism, historical Sculpture, portraits and caricatures.

New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book gives various perspectives on French Romanticism both in the visual Arts and in Literature. There are chapters on Gros, Delacroix, and Ingres, as well as on writers such as Musset and Baudelaire.\n\nBROWN, DAVID BLAYNEY. Romanticism. London; New York: Phaidon, 2001.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is a condensed description of Romanticism in Europe. Brown describes the ideas and principles behind the Romantic Movement. He deals with topics such as the changing status of the artist, the treatment of the historical past, and the Romantic visions of the self and of Nature. This book is not arranged chronologically, but rather according to these main themes. It is intended for a general public.\n\nIVES, COLTA FELLER. Romanticism and the School of Nature: Nineteenth-Century Drawings and Paintings from the Karen B. Cohen collection. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is the catalogue of an exhibit held at the Metropolitan Museum. The exhibit dealt with several Romantic artists and their visions of Nature (including landscapes, seascapes, and animal paintings). It deals mainly with British and French artists, with one section per artist including detailed comments and analysis for each painting or drawing.\n\nNOON, PATRICK J. Crossing the Channel: British and French Painting in the Age of Romanticism. London: Tate Publishing, 2003.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is the catalogue of an exhibit held at the Tate Gallery which sought to compare French and British versions of Romanticism. There are sections on the reception in England of The Raft of the Medusa, as well as on exhibitions and salons in both countries, on representations of historical and literary heroes, portraits, animals, modern life, and landscapes.\n\nTRAPP, FRANK ANDERSON. Delacroix and the Romantic Image: Oriental Themes, Wild Beasts, and the Hunt. Amherst, Mass.: Mead Art Museum, Amherst College, 1988\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is the catalogue of an exhibit held at the Mead Art Museum. The exhibit dealt with oriental themes in French paintings, and in particular in Delacroix’s. The book has an introduction about the collection and the works on display. The pictures reproduced here are more rarely seen than Delacroix’s most famous paintings, and therefore can add to our vision of him as a romantic artist.\n\nFine Arts [ top ]\n\nRealism and Naturalism\n\nMcPHERSON, HEATHER. The Modern Portrait in Nineteenth Century France. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.\n\nCross-listed with Fine Arts – Impressionism and Fine Arts – Photography.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyzes the shifting cultural significance of portraits in the second half of the nineteenth century. The time period coincides with the advent of photography. It has traditionally been argued that the emergence of photographs caused the progressive abandon of realistic painting. The author seeks to nuance that assumption, by showing the different approaches that renewed the genre of portrait painting, in relation and in opposition to photography. From Ingres’ photographic precision to Picasso’s abstractions, McPherson seeks to trace the evolution of a genre which is rarely addressed by critics. The book consists of six case studies, including Courbet’s portrait of Baudelaire, the iconography of the actress Sarah Bernhardt, and Cézanne’s self-portraits. The last chapter compares the representations of the artist in Vuillard’s works to Proust’s descriptions of Elstir in In Search of Lost Time.\n\nMALPAS, JAMES. Realism. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nJames Malpas understands Realism in its broad sense: he argues that Realism is not limited to the Nineteenth Century Art Movement led by Courbet. He understands Realism in a broader perspective as an “Art which opposed the imitation of Realism in order to establish itself as new reality”. After a short chapter on nineteenth-century Realism, the author analyses mainly twentieth-century paintings. This book would therefore be useful for someone working on the influence of the Realist movement in the twentieth century, but not for a study of the movement itself.\n\nNEEDHAM, GERALD. Nineteenth Century Realist Art. New York: Harper and Row, 1988.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume is a good supplement to Nochlin’s book on Realism, because it analyzes several of the same themes from a chronological perspective. It seeks to explore the evolution of Realism throughout the nineteenth century, replacing it in a historical and political context.\n\nNOCHLIN, LINDA. Realism. Harmondsworth, New York: Penguin, 1971.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nIntended for the general reader, this book questions the notion of Realism as an artistic movement and a philosophical issue. After defining the term, Nochlin deals with topics such as the trivialization of Death, the relations between Realism and modernity, and the way in which Realists represented contemporary life. The epilogue of the book has a short section on Architecture.\n\nNOCHLIN, LINDA. Realism and Tradition in Art, 1846-1900. Sources and Documents. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1966.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume is a collection of nineteenth century primary sources about Realism and Naturalism.

The Art of Gustave Moreau: Theory, Style, and Content. Ann Arbor, Mich.: UMI Research Press, 1982.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book has a first chapter on Moreau’s views about Art, with several excerpts from letters and notes.

Maison d’artiste/maison-musée: l’exemple de Gustave Moreau. Paris: Ministère de la culture et de la communication, reéunion des musées nationaux, 1987.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis short volume looks at Moreau’s home: the artist worked for several years on transforming his house in Paris into a Museum of his own works.\n\nMATHIEU, PIERRE-LOUIS. Gustave Moreau. Paris: Flammarion, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is a comprehensive study of Moreau’s work and career.

New Haven: Yale University Press, 2000.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis comprehensive study deals with the Impressionists’ innovations in technique. Callen compares their methods to those of artists from other periods, and deals with issues such as treatment of light, palette tones, canvasses (size, texture), brushes, and frames.\n\nCLARK, T.J. The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and his Followers. Princeton N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1999.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is an important reference in the study of Impressionism. It analyses the movement’s relation to modern life, and seeks to understand if Impressionism criticizes or celebrates what it depicts (some of the predominant themes of Impressionist painting are consumption, leisure, commerce, and the “petite bourgeoisie”). Clark also analyzes the shifts in the subjects chosen by the painters: at first, Impressionists depicted mainly scenes of private leisure, (typically picnics scenes, or moments of “flânerie”). But as time passed, these scenes of leisure tended to be more and more located in public spaces, such as cafes, bars, or “grands magasins”. Clark tries to see if this development is representative of a change of attitude towards modern life.\n\nENGELMAN, INES JANET. Impressionism: 50 paintings you should know. New York: Prestel, 2007.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is intended for a general reader with little knowledge about Impressionism.

Impressionism: Paint and Politics. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyses Impressionism and the movement’s relation to social and artistic norms. House tries to provide an interdisciplinary approach. He deals with social and political questions as well as with aesthetic problems (such as techniques and subject matter). There are chapters on the Impressionists’ representations of Paris and on the vision of modern life that emerges in their paintings.\n\nISKIN, RUTH. Modern Women and Parisian Consumer Culture in Impressionist Painting. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is about the relation between Impressionist painting and the rise of a new consumer culture.

London: Phaidon, 1999.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is an introduction to Impressionism. It is designed for the general reader. The chapters are for the most part organized chronologically, but they sometimes focus on one specific theme or aspect, such as the relations between Impressionism and politics. The book has a bibliography that can provide the reader with suggestions for additional readings (each section of the bibliography corresponds to a chapter of the book).\n\nWALTHER, Ingo. Impressionist Art, 1860-1920. New York: Taschen, 2002.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is a comprehensive introduction to French Impressionism, and retraces its emergence as well as its later evolution (Neo and Post-Impressionism).

The Graphic Arts and French Society, 1871-1914. New Brunswick, NJ.: Rutgers University Press: Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum,1988.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume is about the evolution of graphic arts in France (newspapers, advertising, and prints) after the Franco-Prussian War and the Commune. There are four essays by different scholars. The first one is about the artists’ vision of Paris, and the way it changed after the beginning of the third Republic: artists no longer focused exclusively on Medieval parts of Paris, but also represented modern streets and buildings. Other essays deal with illustrations, as well as with the representation of women and of Paris as a city of pleasure.\n\nCHAM.

It analyzes the social and cultural shifts provoked by photography, as well as the emergence of a “photographic consciousness”. The book is divided into two parts: the first part describes the techniques, their evolution, and the way in which the business of photography functioned and developed in Paris. Part two consists in five case studies about Nadar, Braquehais, Collard, Aubry, and photographic Art reproductions. The conclusion deals with the role played by the political regime in the development of photography.\n\nMcPHERSON, HEATHER. The Modern Portrait in Nineteenth Century France. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001.\n\nCross-listed with Fine Arts – Realism and Fine Arts – Impressionism.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyzes the shifting cultural significance of portraits in the second half of the nineteenth century. The time period coincides with the advent of photography. It has traditionally been argued that the emergence of photographs caused the progressive abandon of realistic painting. The author seeks to nuance that assumption, by showing the different approaches that renewed the genre of portrait painting, in relation and in opposition to photography. From Ingres’ photographic precision to Picasso’s abstractions, McPherson seeks to trace the evolution of a genre which is rarely addressed by critics. The book consists of six case studies, including Courbet’s portrait of Baudelaire, the iconography of the actress Sarah Bernhardt, and Cézanne’s self-portraits. The last chapter compares the representations of the artist in Vuillard’s works to Proust’s descriptions of Elstir in In Search of Lost Time.\n\nMARBOT, BERNARD. After Daguerre: Masterworks of French Photography (1848-1900) from the Bibliothèque Nationale. New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1980.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is about French photography, and does not specifically deal with Paris. It focuses on photography as an Art (in opposition to the documentary use it had been put to by Marville or Le Secq), and thus deals more with portraits, nudes, landscapes, and still life. There are, though, several photographs of Paris reproduced in the book, in particular facades of monuments and a few cityscapes. This book reproduces a great variety of work from many photographers, many of them little-known. For each photographer the authors give a brief biographical summary and a description of their works.\n\nMARBOT, BERNARD. Une invention du XIXe siècle, expression et technique, la photographie: collections de la société française de photographie. Paris: Bibliothèque nationale, 1976.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis catalogue presents a selection of photographs from nineteenth-century France. It has an index of the photographers whose works are reproduced at the end of the volume. It is not a general introduction, but rather a series of reproductions with short commentaries.\n\nMUSÉE NATIONAL DES MONUMENTS FRANÇAIS. Photographier l’architecture, 1851-1920. Collection du musée des monuments français. Paris: Éditions de la Réunion des Musées Nationaux, distribution Seuil, 1994.\n\nCross-listed with Architecture.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis is the catalogue of an exhibit held in 1994 about the relations between Architecture and Photography. The catalogue itself is preceded by short essays on Photography and Architecture. It is then divided into sections with themes such as the representation of Paris, the Mission Héliographique, the discovery of the Orient, etc... The commentary texts and the choice of photographs that are reproduced focus particularly on the 1851 Mission Héliographique, a project commissioned by the state and whose aim was to gather photographs that would document the changing cityscapes of France. It involved famous photographers who were then beginning their careers, such as Le Secq, Le Gray, or Baldus. The catalogue also has a section on Marville, who is particularly famous for his 1865 work, L’album du vieux Paris. This project had also been commissioned by the state, in order to document the changing streets of the old Paris which were about to disappear.\n\nPARRY, EUGENIA. Henri le Secq: Photographe de 1850 à 1860. Catalogue raisonné de la bibliothèque des arts décoratifs, Paris. Paris: Flammarion, 1986.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nHenri le Secq was a collector of art, an engraver, and a photograph. Le Secq particularly liked to take photographs of architecture, and understood photography as a means to document the past state of the city. Most of the photographs presented in this monograph were taken in Paris. Le Secq took many pictures of Notre Dame, and the book also comments on Charles Nègre’s photograph of Le Secq on the cathedral tower, standing next to the “stryge”. This book provides a great example of photography as a means to record and describe architecture in the middle of the nineteenth century.\n\nRÉUNION DES MUSÉES NATIONAUX. L’invention d’un regard (1839-1918). Paris: Éditions de la réunion des Musées nationaux, 1989.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is about the birth of photography in France. Its first chapters deal with the medium in general (technical advances, negatives, uses of light, perspectives and framing of pictures), while the last ones deal more with the styles of photographs that emerged from the discovery of that medium: realism and abstraction, close ups and portraits. Several photographs are about Paris, but this book is primarily a general introduction to French photography in the nineteenth century.\n\nRICE, SHELLEY. Parisian Views. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press, 1997.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book gathers a collection of essays on photography and its relation to modern Parisian life. The introduction, entitled “Time Zones” discusses photography and its shifting relation to time: the speed that characterized modern Parisian life could not be represented when photography started. Daguerre’s photographs represent for the most part empty streets, simply because the time of exposure was so long (about thirty minutes) that the figures of passersby could not appear on the daguerreotype. The second essay is entitled “Parisian Views”, and discusses photography’s rendering of the city. It deals with texts by Baudelaire and photographs by Baldus, Nègre, Le Secq and Braun. The third part, “Still Points in a Turning World”, deals mainly with Marville’s photographs, and in particular those commissioned by Haussmann to document the changing shapes of the streets of Paris. The fourth chapter is on Notre Dame, and the fifth chapter, “Souvenirs”, deals with poetic and photographical representations of Paris as a city in decay. This chapter also includes a long section on Nadar’s aerial views of Paris, as well as on his photographs of the sewers. The last chapter deals with travels and travelers, trains, and boats in photography.\n\nLanguage and Literature [ top ]\n\nBANCQUART, MARIE CLAIRE. Paris « fin de siècle» : de Jules Vallès à Rémy de Goncourt. Paris: Editions de la différence, 2002.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book describes and analyzes representations of Paris in novels by Zola, Maupassant, Balzac, Huysmans, Rimbaud and Vallès. The introductory chapter dwells on Flaubert and Baudelaire’s legacies, since the city had a particularly important role in their texts. The following chapters analyze Paris as a mythological figure. They focus primarily on texts about the Commune, social marginalities and modern style Paris. The book is richly illustrated, and tries to show the relation between Literature and the changing Parisian cityscape.\n\nBONNEFOY, YVES. Le poète et “le flot mouvant des multitudes” : Paris pour Nerval et Baudelaire. Paris: Bibliothèque nationale de France, 2003.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book gathers a series of Bonnefoy’s articles about Paris in Nerval's and Baudelaire’s works. More specifically, it describes how the city is often depicted as an abyss or an ocean in their metaphors.\n\nBROOKS, PETER. Realist Vision. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nOne chapter in this book is entitled “Unreal City: Paris and London in Balzac, Zola, and Gissing” (Chapter 8). This chapter is particularly interesting because of the link that it makes between urbanism and realist fictions.\n\nCITRON, PIERRE. La poésie de Paris dans la littérature française de Rousseau à Baudelaire. Paris: Editions de Minuit, 1961.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is about the poetic representations of Paris in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It provides a description and an analysis of themes, motifs and metaphors linked to Paris in the texts of Mercier, Hugo, and Baudelaire.\n\nCLEBERT, JEAN-PIERRE. La littérature à Paris: l’histoire des lieux, la vie littéraire. Paris: Larousse, 1999.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nEach section of this book is about a street or a neighborhood in Paris: after a brief presentation, the author gives an account of its literary representations, quoting abundantly from novels and poems. This volume would be a very good reference book. It has an index of the names of authors cited in each section.\n\nCOOPER, BARBARA T., and MARY DONALDSON EVANS. Moving Forward, Holding Fast: The Dynamics of Nineteenth Century French Culture. Atlanta, G.A.: Rodopi, 1997.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThe nineteenth-century representation of the city is fundamentally linked to the ideas of speed and dynamism. This book is a collection of papers about the ideal of progress in literature, but also about trends that resisted it and idealized the past (the introduction cites as examples the troubadour genre in painting, or the architectural restorations made by Viollet-le-Duc). There are numerous essays on Balzac, Flaubert, Stendhal, Maupassant, Baudelaire, and Zola.\n\nD’SOUZA, ARUNA, & MCDONOUGH, TOM, Eds. The invisible flâneuse? Gender, Public Space, and Visual Culture in Nineteenth-Century Paris. Manchester and New York: Manchester University Press, 2006.\n\nCross-listed with History – The Emergence of Mass Culture and History – Classifying and Policing: Social Classes and Social Types\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume presents a collection of essays from prominent critics specialized in Art History and in Feminism. It deals with the place of women in Paris, and more specifically in the city’s public spaces. There are essays on subjects such as the figures of the “bourgeoise” and the “flâneuse”, the place of women in parks and theatres, magazines, advertising, and department stores.\n\nDUFIEF, PIERRE-JEAN. Paris dans le roman du XIXe siècle. Paris: Hatier, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is designed as an introduction for a general public. It has a short historical summary about Paris in the nineteenth century, followed by a series of nine excerpts from novels by Balzac, Hugo, Maupassant and Zola. Each short excerpt (about one page) is accompanied by a commentary text. The last section of the book deals with general topics, such as panoramas, or metaphorical representations of Paris.\n\nFERGUSON, PRISCILLA PARKHURST. Paris as Revolution: Writing the Nineteenth Century City. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyses Paris as a city which was linked to revolutionary dynamics and ideals. The successive revolutions that happened there (1789, 1830, 1848, and 1871) shaped a specific image of the city, not only as the place of past revolutions, but also as a space which could always be pregnant with new revolutionary potential. Ferguson argues that, for the writers of that time, seeking to encompass the figure of Paris was also a means to search into the Revolutionary state of mind.\n\nGLUCK, MARY. “Theorizing the Cultural Roots of the Bohemian Artist.” Modernism-/-Modernity. 2000; 7 (3 Sept): 351-378\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nAbstract (source: infogate): A historical and theoretical expansion of the figure of the bohemian artist through the linkage of social and aesthetic dimensions. Traces the origins of bohemian culture to the 1820s-1830s, from romantic drama, melodrama, and the comedie-Vaudeville to allegorical romance. Focusing on literature and especially theatrical performance, explores issues such as self v. collective, and high culture v. popular culture. Includes discussion of Latin Quarter regulars such as Théophile Gautier as well as some Daumier satirical drawings of Vaudeville.\n\nHARVEY, DAVID. “The Cartographic Imagination: Balzac in Paris”. Cosmopolitan Geographies: New Locations in Literature and Culture. Darkwadker, Vinay, ed. New York: Routledge, 2001.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis article deals with the Balzac’s novels (in particular History of the Thirteen and Old Goriot) and the place of Architecture and Urbanism within these texts.\n\nLEE, D. “The catastrophic imaginary of the Paris Commune in Jules Verne's 'Les 500 millions de la Begum'.\" Neophilologus. 2006; 90 (4) : 535-553.\n\nLOCATION: Online.\n\nAbstract: (source: infogate) The bitter memory of the Prussian siege of Paris in 1870 and the Commune of 1871 underwrite several late nineteenth-century French novels. In the domain of popular literature, Jules Verne's \"Les 500 millions de la Begum\" of 1879 pits two opposing cities -one French and utopian, the other German and dystopian - against each other. Less than a simple representation of a French revenge against their Prussian enemies, however, the cities stand in for the troubling tendencies of urban modernity above and beyond nationalism. Moreover, the figure of Pompeii, a model of urban catastrophe linked to the specter of the Paris Commune, lurks underneath the novel's progressive and hopeful surface.\n\nLIDSKY, PAUL. Les écrivains contre la commune. Paris: F. Maspero, 1970.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book provides a detailed description of the writers’ reactions to the Paris Commune. It quotes extensively from the letters and articles of the most prominent writers’ of the time and analyzes their positions about the Commune. The author quotes extensively from Zola, Flaubert, George Sand, Hugo, Vallès, and Anatole France.\n\nMAXWELL, RICHARD. The Mysteries of Paris and London. Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1992.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyzes nineteenth-century novels and their urban settings. Maxwell comments mainly on works by Dickens and Hugo, and he is interested in the function of the city in their texts. The city is more than a décor. In a chapter about Notre Dame de Paris, Maxwell shows that Paris is represented as a maze, with Esmeralda playing a role similar to that of Ariane in ancient mythology. He also analyzes the insistence of Hugo on the difficulty to read the city, a place where many different codes, languages, and kinds of slang cohabit.\n\nMORETTI, FRANCO. Atlas of the European Novel. 1800-1900. New York: Verso, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is an attempt to analyze nineteenth-century French and English Literature according to geographical parameters: on the one hand, Moretti wants to describe literature in space : that is, novels as they relate to the place where they were created. And on the other hand, he is also interested in the place of space in literature, and on the way that the fictional discourse treats its décor. The first part of the book is devoted to the novel as a genre concomitant to the rise of the Nation State. The second part of the book is probably the most interesting for our topic: entitled “A tale of two cities”, it deals with novels taking place in London and Paris, and draws maps which represent the errands of the characters in these cities. Moretti intends to reveal patterns behind these various trajectories in the capitals, focusing primarily on Balzac’s and Flaubert’s novels (Lost Illusions, Père Goriot, and The Sentimental Education).\n\nParis au dix-neuvième siècle: aspects d’un mythe littéraire. Lyon: presses Universitaires de Lyon, 1984.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is a collection of papers read at a colloquium in Lyon in 1982. They deal with the representation of Paris in texts such as Balzac’s La fille aux yeux d’or, Flaubert’s L’éducation sentimentale, and Eugène Sue’s Les mystères de Paris.\n\nPRENDERGAST, CHRISTOPHER. Paris and the Nineteenth Century. Cambridge, USA: Blackwell, 1992.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume is a reference for nineteenth century Literature scholars. Christopher Prendergast analyzes the conflicting representations of Paris in a time when the city was radically changing. The capital was seen as the center of progress and of European cultural life. Writers like Hugo have described Paris as prefiguring a glorious future for civilization, which suggests that the city is actually readable, and has a meaning that can be deciphered. But, Prendergast argues, Haussman’s works in Paris paradoxically did not trigger representations of Paris as legible: the city’s identity, on the contrary, becomes blurred and uncertain for many writers. Prendergast’s study deals with these conflicting attitudes toward the city, by analyzing a variety of objects of study (such as speed, cityscapes, panoramas, underground Paris, and insurrections, among others topics).\n\nMusic [ top ]\n\nBARBIER, PATRICK. Opera in Paris, 1800-1850: a Lively History. Portland, Or: Amadeus Press, 1995.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book is a factual description of the world of Opera in the first half of the century. It starts with a description of the relation between Napoleon and Opera, and gives details about the laws that were regulating the field at the time. It then portrays the evolution of Court Theater after the fall of the Empire, and the various functions and roles of the staff that worked in Opera, from composer to chorus, including dancers and musicians. The book includes descriptions of scenery, stage machinery, and administrative offices. It goes on to draw a general chronological perspective on the changing aesthetics of Opera and on the various careers of the composers. It also deals with subjects such as the audiences’ social status, the artistic life, and the representation of Opera in the Press.\n\nBLOOM, PETER, Ed. Music in Paris in the Eighteen-thirties. Stuyvesant, NY: Pendragon Press, 1987.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis volume gathers papers which were originally presented during a conference at Smith College in 1982. A ten page preface describes the particularities of Paris and of the cultural/musical context of that decade. The volume contains 22 papers, a few of which are in French (in which case they are followed by a short summary in English). The topics of the articles vary considerably: composers (Mendelssohn, Chopin, Verdi, Wagner and Liszt), French popular songs, chamber music, representations of musicians in comedies, music instruments in the world fairs, operas and melodramas, among other subjects.\n\nBRODY, ELAINE. Paris: the Musical Kaleidoscope, 1870-1925. New York: G. Braziller, 1987.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book describes the various musical currents that influenced French Music at the turn of the century. It has thirteen chapters, each of which describes a particular trend: Wagner’s love-hate relationship with France and the influence that he had on French music, “Japonisme” and Orientalism, Art, Literature, “Expositions universelles” and the way in which music was represented there. The book also describes cabarets and popular music, as well as Russian, Spanish, and American influences on French music.\n\nGERHARD, ANSELM. The Urbanization of Opera: Music Theater in Paris in the Nineteenth Century. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book proposes an analysis of new modes of representation in Opera. In the nineteenth century, both “tragédies lyriques” and operas ceased to be staged in the royal court. Instead, their premieres always took place in the city, and the author argues that their subject matter often portrayed “city ways and attitudes”. Gerhard calls this trend “urbanized Opera”. In this book, he describes the visual culture of an era (panoramas, dioramas, and kaleidoscopes), and the way in which operas began to draw a new public. The chapters of the book often deal with a single composer or author (Rossini, Eugene Scribe, Meyerbeer, Victor Hugo, and Verdi, among others).\n\nHUEBNER, STEVEN. French Opera at the Fin de Siècle: Wagnerism, Nationalism, and Style. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book deals with French Opera and its relation to Wagner, whose work had a very strong impact in France in the last decade of the century. This study addresses a scholarly public. The book contains a general introduction on the subject, and is divided into four parts: “Jules Massenet”, “Ambivalent Wagnerians and conservative renewal”, “Wagnerian renewal”, and “Realist opera”. The last part has chapters on Bohemian Montmartre and on Zola’s influence on Alfred Bruneau.\n\nLACOMBE, HERVE. The Keys to French Opera in the Nineteenth Century. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book can be read both by a general public and scholars alike. It focuses on the Second Empire (1852-1870). The first part deals with the material conditions of creating and performing an opera. It also dissociates the various genres that prevailed at the time (“Grand Opéra” and “Opéra Comique”), and describes in detail the practical stages that anyone wanting to mount an Opera would have had to deal with (commissioning, censorship) as well as the roles of the main participants (theater director, librettist, publisher). The second part focuses on the music and the poetry (construction of drama, space and time, poetic and musical expression). The last part is entitled “society, Genres, and Aesthetes”. It describes the careers of several composers, and goes back to the question of genres, describing them in more detail. The last chapter is a study of the aesthetic principles of the time, and exposes the different visions and conceptions of Opera that prevailed in the nineteenth century.\n\nPATUREAU, FREDERIQUE. Le palais Garnier dans la société parisienne: 1875-1914. Liège: Mardaga, 1991.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book is an in-depth account of the way in which the Opera Garnier was administered, and of the types of shows which were staged there. A first part deals with the functional administration, and includes sections on the relation between the opera and the state, financial organization, budget, and wages. The second part is about the repertoires and the types of Operas that were staged in the building (here the author describes the commissioning, the main composers, and the efforts made to renew the repertoire). The last part describes the public at the Opera, which mainly consisted of social elites, even though Patureau also describes what she sees as a “democratization of the public”.\n\nPERLOFF, NANCY LYNN. Art and the Everyday: Popular Entertainment and the Circle of Erik Satie. Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1991.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book deals with “the startling blend of popular and art idioms” that Erik Satie and his group “introduced in French music” (p. 2). Although the author focuses more particularly on the first two decades of the twentieth century, a few chapters can be very useful for the study of cabarets and popular entertainments in the late nineteenth century (see in particular the introduction, and chapter 1, “Popular Institutions in Turn-of-the-Century Paris”).\n\nSPIES, ANDRE MICHAEL. Opera, state, and Society in the Third Republic, 1875-1914. New York: P. Lang, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis book examines the links between the state and the Opera at the turn of the century, focusing particularly on the ideology which Opera could potentially convey. The book describes the Opera’s administration, and the links between Opera and nationalism (chapter 2: “The State and the Ideology of the Opera: Carmen or Jeanne d’Arc?”). Spies goes back to the question of ideology in the third chapter, this time in so far as the public related to it: he dissociates the social concerns and struggles as exposed in the “Opéra Comique” from what was staged in the aristocratic Opera (which typically attracted an audience that was not very receptive to social themes). The book goes on to describe the role of the state in the choices of repertoire. The final chapters are on public opinion and critics, as well as on the impact of the librettists.\n\nWEBER, WILLIAM. Music and the Middle Class: the Social Structure of Concert Life in London, Paris and Vienna between 1830 and 1848. Aldershot, Hants, England; Burlington, VT: Ashgate, 2004.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nThis study focuses on London more than on Paris or Vienna, but it is a very good introduction to the history of the emergence of concert life in the middle class. The book deals with the social characteristics of the public, and with the rise of the middle class. The two decades at stake here are decades of economical growth, which triggered a rising standard of living in the three capitals. Weber calls these phenomena a “cultural explosion”, and he analyzes the repercussions of this shift in his first chapter. The following sections include topics such as popular-music, classical-music (focusing particularly on the kind of public that would attend those performances), and concert life.\n\nWHITING, STEVEN MOORE. Satie the Bohemian: from Cabaret to Concert Hall. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999.\n\nLOCATION: Orwig Library.\n\nErik Satie was a music composer from the turn of the century. He was also very active in the milieu of cabaret and music-hall, and composed several popular songs and humoristic works. This book dwells on these two aspects of Satie’s work, and on his conception of music as an art that should depart from its classical frames. The first part of the book describes the milieu of the café-concerts, music-halls and cabarets at the turn of the century. The second part is more specific, since it deals with Satie’s involvement in the Chat Noir, the Divan Japonais, and the Auberge du Clou, among others. The last part describes and analyzes Satie’s work as a composer of both ballets and songs.\n\nHistory [ top ]\n\nGeneral historical and cultural studies\n\nCHARLE, CHRISTOPHE. Paris fin de siècle. Culture et Politique. Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1998.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is about Paris as a cultural, philosophical, and intellectual center. It understands Paris as one of the main poles of modernity at the end of the century, and seeks to show its specificity as a cultural metropolis (through a comparison with Berlin in particular). There are chapters on universities, artistic and literary circles, intellectual figures, the evolution of the discipline of History, politics in literature, the building of a literary nationalism, and the Dreyfus affair.\n\nGAILLARD, MARC. Paris au XIXe siècle. Paris: Nathan, 1981.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is organized chronologically and gives a richly illustrated description of Paris and its evolution in the nineteenth century. There are sections on sewers, gardens, new streets, fountains, docks, train stations, etc…\n\nHARVEY, DAVID. Paris, Capital of Modernity. New York: Routledge, 2003.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyzes the concept of modernity as it is related to Paris and to the nineteenth century. It focuses particularly on the July monarchy (1830-1848) and the Second Empire (1851-1871). It has chapters on Balzac, revolutionary politics, labor power, the condition of women, consumerism, spectacle and leisure, sciences, and urban transformations. There is also a final section on the building process of the Sacré coeur in Montmartre.\n\nHIGONNET, PATRICE L.R. Paris Capital of the World. Cambridge Mass.: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2002.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis long book (about 500 pages) can be used as a general cultural introduction to the city’s history in the nineteenth century. Each chapter can be read separately, and can prepare the way for further research. There are chapters on themes such as Revolution, crime, science, Parisian myths, alienation, literary representations of the city, Paris as a capital of pleasure, and phantasmagorias.\n\nMARCHAND, BERNARD. Paris, histoire d’une ville: XIXe et XXe siècle. Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1993.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book is divided into six parts, three of which concern the nineteenth century. These six sections are arranged chronologically. The text is a detailed and well-documented description of demographical, social, spatial, and political changes in Paris. It analyzes various issues such as poverty, the modernization of the city, the development of transportation, social classes, etc…\n\nOSTER, DANIEL. La vie parisienne. Anthologie des mœurs du XIXe siècle. Paris: Sand/Conti, 1989.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis volume gathers a collection of texts and illustrations from the nineteenth century about the city life in Paris. The very long introduction describes the relations between the city and the artistic and journalistic milieus. The texts of this anthology are classified according to a series of themes related to Parisian life: streets and boulevards, underground Paris (sewers and catacombs), public places (woods, gardens, cafes, restaurants, cabarets, balls, universal exhibits, theaters), Parisian types. Very often, the illustrations for the texts were not part of the original publication, and come from other sources (such as newspapers or magazines).\n\nHistory [ top ]\n\nEverydaylife studies\n\nAMATO, JOSEPH ANTHONY. On foot: A History of Walking. New York: New York University Press, 2004.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library / Online: http://josiah.brown.edu/record=b4229859\n\nThis book deals with the physical, social and economical significances of walking. Practices of walking vary through the ages and according to their function (marching, going for a walk, carrying, etc). Two chapters are of particular interest: chapter 4, entitled “mind over foot. Romantic walking and rambling”, talks about the romantic ideal of walking and the links that it could draw between man and nature. Walking, for the romantics, is a way of flying away from the industrial world and from the urban space. In Chapter 7, “a new footing for the nation: taming and cleaning up in revolutionary Paris”, Amato describes the policies of the successive French governments to try and control the mobs and their displacements, in a century that was constantly under the threat of revolt and revolution.\n\nARON, JEAN-PAUL. Essai sur la sensibilité alimentaire à Paris au 19e siècle. Paris: A. Colin, 1967.\n\nCross-listed with History – The Emergence of Mass Culture – Mass Culture and Consumer Society.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book deals with the place of food in nineteenth-century Paris: it describes consumption and eating practices in relation to wealth and social class. It also questions the notion of taste, and gives a list of the groceries which would have been considered as luxury goods at the time. More generally, the book draws a picture of the food consumption habits of the first half of the century. It uses sources such as restaurant menus and grocery store bills to trace the social practices of eating out, and it compares the prices of the various goods which were available at the time in cafes and restaurants.\n\nBARNES, DAVID S. The Great Stink of Paris and the Nineteenth Century Struggle against Filth and Germs. Baltimore, Md: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006.\n\nCross-listed with History – Medicine.\n\nLOCATION: Science Library / Online: http://josiah.brown.edu/record=b4350520\n\nThis book studies the last quarter of the nineteenth century and the way scientific discoveries influenced public health politics: Barnes is particularly interested in what he calls the bacteriological revolution, led in France by Pasteur at the end of the century. Between 1870 and the 1890’s, the approach to health had radically changed, leading from what Barnes calls the “sanitary era” to the “bacteriological” one. In other words, hygiene, filth, heredity and habits were understood to be at the root of health problems in the 1870’s. The bacteriological revolution, with the discoveries of microbes and of the way they function, changed that assumption and gave to science a predominant role over habits and ways of life. The author here is more interested in mentalities and social consequences of this revolution than in the scientific problems as such.

Les douze heures noires: la nuit à Paris au XIXe siècle. Paris: Albin Michel, 2000.\n\nLOCATION: Rockefeller Library\n\nThis book analyzes the tropes of night and darkness in 19th century Paris. The eighteenth century was dominated by the figures of light and enlightenment.

She analyzes the importance of night in the construction of Paris as a myth, and how this role changed with the emergence of street lighting. There are sections on nightlife and entertainment (gambling houses, balls, carnivals), as well as on nocturnal police and crime.
