        "text": "Ah, France—the food, the wine, the style. And of course, the capital: Paris, hailed as the City of Lights and the City of Love. From the famed Eiffel Tower to the enchanting countryside, France is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Whether you're busy planning your dream vacation or you're ready for a virtual trip right now, French literature is one of the best ways to become immersed in France’s fascinating history, people, and culture.\n\nWithout French literature, there would be no Little Prince or Hunchback of Notre Dame, no Man in the Iron Mask or Tartuffe.
