        "text": "There were many technical innovations in printing between 1800 and 1900 that had important effects on newspapers and novels. The use of metal presses, steel engraving and, after 1848, of stereotypes and mechanical presses completely altered the production process. Marketing techniques changed too: circulating libraries (Figure 7), railway station bookstalls and cheap reprints of successful titles helped to establish and satisfy a market that expanded with the rising population, increased literacy (Figure 5) and greater educational opportunities. In Britain, newspapers were hampered by taxation until 1855, but by the end of the century mass circulation newspapers had developed.\n\nChanges in the novel\n\nThe novel never suffered taxation problems but was otherwise similarly affected by these changes. The huge problems of the new industrial cities offered fresh subject-matter to be interpreted in the new intellectual climate of Europe after the French Revolution. Even two such early novelists as Jane Austen (1775–1817) and Walter Scott (1771–1832) (Figure 1) reveal a distinct if conservative responsiveness to change. Jane Austin's domestic comedies, carefully structured in six novels, are at once amusing and deeply serious. Scott virtually invented the historical novel. His popular success brought him a considerable personal fortune.\n\nJane Austen concentrated on witty, incisive descriptions of rural English society. Her sense of form had its roots in the classical English comedy of Congreve and Jonson. She was the first of a remarkable line of women novelists whose lives were otherwise provincial and obscure. During her lifetime she earned only Â£250 for six novels, but time has discriminated in her favor and she is now regarded as an immortal of English literature. Two of her best works are Pride and Prejudice (1813) and Emma (1816), both about ordinary people unaffected by world events.\n\nPopular success was also enjoyed by his Victorian successors William Makepeace Thackeray (1811–1863), Anthony Trollope (1815–1882) and above all by Charles Dickens (1812–1870) (Figure 2) and George Eliot (1819–1880). Dickens built up an astonishingly close relationship with his readers in his sentimental but brilliantly funny and sometimes despairing vision of city life. George Eliot, on the other hand, was provincial in her subjects and European in the range and discipline of her thought. The mid-century also saw the publication of the Bronte sisters' novels. Charlotte (1816–1855), author of significant poems as well as of the novel Wuthering Heights, has since been more highly regarded. Important later novelists include George Meredith (1828–1909), George Gissing (1857–1903), Samuel Butler (1835–1902) and Thomas Hardy (1840–1928). Hardy's novels frequently express a passionate feeling for man's tragic involvement in nature and estrangement from it.\n\nMass circulation newspapers became possible after the development of new printing techniques and the ending of the newspaper tax in 1855. Serious, major journalistic innovations, like The Times' coverage of the Crimean War (top), probably had less influence on novels than \"gutter press\" sensationalism (bottom).\n\nThe novel in Western Europe\n\nFrench fiction in this period was much more urbane and less prudish than English. The realists, Stendhal (1783–1842), Honore de Balzac (1799–1850) (Figure 3) and Gustave Flaubert (1821–1880), depicted French history and bourgeois life at a great length and in minute detail. Romantic experience and attitudes, however, were given vivid expression in the works of Victor Hugo (1802–1885) and George Sand (1804–1876). Emile Zola (1840–1902) (Figure 6), leader of the naturalists, produced franker and more painfully pessimistic studies of the workings of heredity and environment in human affairs (Figure 4). The enormous popular success of Alexandre Dumas the father (1802–1870) and his historical romances were matched by that of his son of the same name (1824–1895).\n\nThe giant figure of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) overshadows nineteenth- century German literature. In his wake the regionalist anti-romanticism of Theodore Storm (1817–1888) and Fritz Reuter (1810–1874) seems relatively less significant. Italian prose in this period was dominated not by one great man but by one great book, The Betrothed by Alessandro Manzoni (1785–1873), a patriotic Romantic who was greatly influenced by Scott. The task of modernizing the Italian novel fell to Giovanni Verga (1840–1922) and Antonio Fogazzaro (1842–1911).\n\nThe literary tradition in Russia\n\nIn some ways the most surprising national achievement in the evolution of the novel was that of Russia. The first major Russian novelists were Mikhail Lermontov (1814–1841) and Nikolai Gogol (1818–1852); their successors, Ivan Turgenev (1818–1883), Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881) and Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) were to make a deep impression on Western European culture when their works were translated into French, German and English. Tolstoy's War and Peace and Anna Karenina are among the greatest of all literary works.\n\nTolstoy's funeral was the first non-religious Russian funeral, yet he died with the reputation of a saint because of his religious and political devotion to the ideal \"simple peasant\" life. In What is Art? (1897) he had repudiated most of European literature including his own and Shakespeare's works, yet in his own ascetic and prophetic old age he demonstrated the same sort of passion and contradictory idealism with which he had invested his fictional heroes..\n\nWhile Dostoevsky's intellectual perspectives are significantly modern it was Henry James (1843–1916) who introduced modern techniques into the novel. Although he spent most of his life in Europe, he remained in important ways American. The formal complexity and ironic indirectness of his work is also characteristic of Nathaniel Hawthorne (1806–1864), Herman Melville (1819–1891) and Mark Twain (1835–1910). In his own fiction James abandoned the convention that the author knows everything and selected one or two characters from whose point of view he told his story. Although most of his own novels are long, this technique led on to the writing of shorter, more economical works. As well as the artistic reasons for this development there were also strictly commercial ones: with the advent of cheap editions that readers could buy for themselves the great circulating libraries were in decline and publishers became less interested in length alone. The age of the Victorian novel was over."
