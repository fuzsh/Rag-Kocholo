ROYAUTE Un beau matin, chez un peuple fort doux, un homme et une femme superbes criaient sur la place publique: \"Mes amis, je veux qu'elle soit reine!\" \"Je veux être reine!\" Elle riait et tremblait. Il parlait aux amis de révélation, d'épreuve terminée. Ils se pâmaient l'un contre l'autre. En effet ils furent rois toute une matinée, où les tentures carminées se relevèrent sur les maisons, et tout l'après-midi, où ils s'avancèrent du côté des jardins de palmes. We think that this poem tells that the woman screaming to be a queen, means by that, that she wants to marry her partner and by doing that she will become a queen, that is an indirect way to say that her partner is a king. They end up marrying each other at the end of the poem. « LES ILLUMINATIONS » , par ARTHUR RIMBAUD\n\n34. His name is Paul Verlaine.
