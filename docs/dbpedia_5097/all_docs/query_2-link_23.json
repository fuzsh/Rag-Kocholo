        "text": "The new respect for the short story was also evident in France, as Henry James observed, “when [in 1844 Prosper] Mérimée, with his handful of little stories, was elected to the French Academy.” As illustrated by “Columbia” (1841) or “Carmen” (1845), which gained additional fame as an opera, Mérimée’s stories are masterpieces of detached and dry observation, though the subject matter itself is often emotionally charged. Nineteenth-century France produced short stories as various as 19th-century America—although the impressionist tale was generally less common in France. (It is as if, not having an outstanding impressionist storyteller themselves, the French adopted Poe, who was being ignored by the critics in his own country.) The two major French impressionist writers were Charles Nodier, who experimented with symbolic fantasies, and Gérard de Nerval, whose collection Les Filles du feu (1854; “Daughters of Fire”) grew out of recollections of his childhood. Artists primarily known for their work in other forms also attempted the short story—novelists like Honoré de Balzac and Gustave Flaubert and poets like Alfred de Vigny and Théophile Gautier.\n\nOne of the most interesting writers of 19th-century France is Alphonse Daudet, whose stories reflect the spectrum of interest and techniques of the entire century. His earliest and most popular stories (Lettres de mon moulin, 1866; “Letters from My Mill”) create a romantic, picturesque fantasy; his stories of the Franco-Prussian War (Les Contes du Lundi, 1873; “Monday Tales”) are more objectively realistic, and the sociological concern of his last works betrays his increasing interest in naturalistic determinism."
