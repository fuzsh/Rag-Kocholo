Hotel Colorado is known for its impeccable service, modern amenities and well-appointed rooms; and is close proximity to world-class hot springs, skiing, whitewater rafting and a 16-mile, paved Glenwood Canyon Recreation Trail for biking or hiking. The hotel also has a lot of packages to choose from to experience the best of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, which by the way, is only a 57-minute drive from Aspen.

There are more than 17 unique guest rooms with 19th-century Italy décor, and four delectable dining choices on-site. “While Glenwood Springs has much to offer its visitors including famous hot springs and a mountain-top theme park, Hotel Colorado is the central location that offers guests relaxation, an abundance of history and a truly unique experience during all of their adventures,” says Kaylyn Radden, the hotel’s Assistant General Manager.
