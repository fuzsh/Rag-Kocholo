        "text": "Dr. Bell's Carriage House, which is probably the oldest standing structure in Manitou Springs, was built in 1871 but was sadly neglected for years. It was part of the original Briarhurst estate and was constructed by one of the founders of little Manitou Springs. Its elegant Gothic Revival architectural style inspired the three Bed and Breakfast structures that we built 25 years ago. In 2011, the Carriage House was completely restored and lovingly renovated. It is now used as the innkeepers' home."
