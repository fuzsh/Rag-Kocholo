        "text": "The General Palmer Hotel is the only 4 star hotel in Durango, CO and lives up to its billing!\n\nThe decor of the lobby, sitting area, reading room as well as the multiple areas to sit, relax and talk are all period correct. The hotel, named after General Palmer who bought the railroad to the mining towns of Silverton and Durango in the late 1800’s was built in a true Victorian fashion.\n\nOur room was decorated in true Victorian fashion with a huge four poster bed, an extremely comfortable mattress, multiple pillows and nice terry cloth robes to relax after a long day on the railroad or just walking around town.\n\nThe shower and bath area was ample and the soaps and shampoo’s supplied were keepers, all in all a very enjoyable experience.\n\nWe had nearly the entire hotel for our guests for our wedding back in June. Although there were a few management changes during our planning, the owner and staff of the hotel did everything that they could do to make sure our weekend was perfect. Everybody was so nice and accommodating!\n\nThe rooms are cute and clean. We keep having friends comment on how neat and historic the hotel was. It is in the perfect location in downtown Durango, right next to the train station. This hotel has tons of character and is one of a kind.\n\nWe appreciate everything that they did for a bunch of us crazy Texans and for making our wedding weekend unforgettable! Look forward to getting back to Durango soon!\n\nRight on Main Street, so everything is accessible. It’s fun just to look out your room window and see all that’s happening.\n\nIf you like to walk around Durango and see all the shops, eat at different restaurants, and really sense the spirit of this cool little town, you must have a room at the General Palmer! It’s a beautiful and charming hotel. It’s like having an old, classy aunt you can stay with, who caters to you but knows you’re a big kid who does your own thing. The General is so convenient to everything you’d like to do in town. The hotel smells so great. Old wood that has been polished, gleaming copper and brass, great coffee and tea in the greeting area, newspapers to read, and a most attentive staff make this an ideal place to start and end your day. You can easily come back to your room for a shower or nap and then go out again. We just love the place. We will always stay at The General Palmer."
