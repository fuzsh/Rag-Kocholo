        "text": "Napkin doodle to Space Needle\n\nSeattle hotel executive and chief organizer of the 1962 World’s Fair, Edward E. Carlson, traveled to Stuttgart Germany where he was inspired by a broadcast tower featuring a restaurant. He doodled an idea of a dominant central structure for the fair on a napkin, convinced that such a tower could become an enduring symbol for Seattle. He called it a “Space Needle.”\n\nMaking Space\n\nEarly investigations indicated there was no room for a tower at the fairgrounds, but just 13 months before the World’s Fair, a suitable 120- foot-by-120-lot on the site of an old fire station was found and sold to investors for $75,000 in 1961.\n\nA Rainbow of Fame and Flame\n\nThe Space Needle officially opened the first day of the World’s Fair. During the expo the tower hosted an estimated 2.65 million visitors including many well-known faces.\n\nThe original mast atop the structure was a natural gas torch that was lit up at night in rainbow colors.\n\nFalling for the Needle\n\nFor April Fools’ Day, the KING-TV Almost Live comedy show ran a spoof news announcement that the Space Needle had fallen over. The live broadcast included a mocked-up graphic of the tower in ruins on the ground. The prank received international attention and overwhelmed Seattle’s 9-1-1 emergency system with people who believed it was real.\n\nShining Higher\n\nThe Space Needle unveiled its Legacy Lights for the first time. The powerful beam of light is powered by lamps that total 85 million candela (a light’s luminosity) shining upwards from the top of the tower.\n\nThe Legacy Lights remained lit for eleven days straight in response to the September 11th attacks in 2001 and continue to honor national holidays and special occasions.\n\nY2 Upgrade\n\nThe tower completed a $20 million revitalization in 2000. The project included construction of the Pavilion Level, Spacebase retail store, SkyCity restaurant, Observation Deck improvements, exterior lighting additions, exterior painting and more. In comparison, the Space Needle was built for about $4.5 million dollars in 1962.\n\nSpace Race\n\nFor the Space Needle’s 50th anniversary, it sponsored “Space Race 2012,” a contest that selected one lucky individual to win an actual flight into orbit. The contest was announced by Buzz Aldrin, the Apollo 11 astronaut who was the second man to walk the moon.\n\nA Breath of Fresh Air\n\n“The Century Project” renovation began in September 2017, revealing the tower’s internal structure and harkening back to the original conceptual sketches. Thanks to its 360o Spacelift, guests can now enjoy two levels of breathtaking floor-to-ceiling views from the outdoor observation deck, down the Oculus Stairs, to The Loupe—the world’s first and only rotating glass floor."
