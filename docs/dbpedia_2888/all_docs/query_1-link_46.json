        "text": "When it first opened its doors in 1881, Union Depot was the tallest building in the West. Complete with electric lights and a 180-foot clock tower, the station consolidated Denver’s numerous railroad depots into one convenient, central location, simplifying travel to and from the Mile High City.\n\nAfter an electrical fire consumed the Depot’s central hall and clock tower in 1894, a larger replacement structure was quickly built, integrating the surviving Romanesque-style wings of the original Union Depot which still stand to this day.\n\nBy the turn of the century, the Transcontinental Railway had forever changed the face of the West. Colorado’s rail network was rapidly expanding to keep pace with the demand for train travel, growing from 328 miles of track in 1870 to half-a-million miles by 1900. Not surprisingly, our booming city soon found that it had outgrown the original Union Depot, and work began in earnest on a larger replacement.\n\nMade from carved granite in the popular Beaux-Arts architectural style, the newly renamed Denver Union Station opened to the public in 1914, ushering in the city’s golden age of rail travel. Over the next century, it would play host to notable dignitaries from Presidents to European Royalty.\n\nWith the advent of the Interstate highway system, the popularity of rail travel gradually fell by the wayside, and by the close of the 20th century Denver Union Station had fallen into disrepair. In 2001, the Union Station Alliance — led by Dana Crawford, the pioneering preservationist who oversaw the revitalization of the Oxford Hotel and Larimer Square — began efforts to reimagine the iconic landmark for a new age.\n\nThe Station officially reopened to the public in 2014, one hundred years after the building’s original opening. This crown jewel of downtown Denver is home to world-class dining, shopping, and cultural events, along with the award-winning Crawford Hotel.\n\nInspired by the journey of the past decade, in 2024 Denver Union Station underwent an extensive refresh to reflect its place as a thriving transit hub and cultural destination. This renovation included a refresh of the Great Hall, Cooper Lounge, private event venues, along with a new lobby space and private elevator access for the 112-room Crawford Hotel. Unveiled in Summer 2024, this latest revitalization marks the beginning of yet another exciting chapter in the Station’s storied history."
