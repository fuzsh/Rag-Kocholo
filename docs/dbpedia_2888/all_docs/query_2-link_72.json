        "text": "Just ranked by USA Today as one of the five best new hotels in the United States and dubbed a “keystone” project by Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, the ART Hotel is one of the crown jewels of Denver’s burgeoning hospitality scene. Located in the heart of Denver’s Golden Triangle Museum District, it joins its neighbor, the Daniel Libeskind-designed Denver Art Museum, as beacons of Denver’s ascent into national cultural relevance. Essentially a museum itself, the ART Hotel features rotating artwork by highly-esteemed artists such as Sol LeWitt, Frank Gehry, Larry Bell, Josef Albers, Jim Dine, Clyfford Still, Ed Ruscha, Leo Villareal and many more, thus creating an aesthetic experience unrivaled by any other hotel in Denver.\n\nThe ART Hotel is made even more special for FLC thanks to our collaborators. We were fortunate enough to be able to work with some extraordinary individuals on this project, and the ART Hotel will always have special personal significance thanks to the involvement of a dear friend.\n\nJust ranked by USA Today as one of the five best new hotels in the United States and dubbed a “keystone” project by Denver Mayor Michael Hancock, the ART Hotel is one of the crown jewels of Denver’s burgeoning hospitality scene.

We were fortunate enough to be able to work with some extraordinary individuals on this project, and the ART Hotel will always have special personal significance thanks to the involvement of a dear friend.\n\nThe ART Hotel had to be excellent. It had to be beautiful, energy-efficient and culturally relevant. A design-build project led by Mike Ikenouye at LEI Companies, Inc., the lighting objective was put forth early on: specify LEDs to make it energy-efficient, and make it look amazing. As in a museum, the ART Hotel’s collection of artwork had to be highlighted first and foremost while minimizing the visibility of the lighting itself. Collaborating with Mike, the Davis designer Guadulupe “Lupe” Cantu, R2H Engineering and Greg Mackell at 186 Lighting Design Group, FLC worked to create a truly stunning experience for the city of Denver using LED products crafted by a variety of our finest manufacturers. The ART Hotel is one of the best showcases of LED architectural lighting in the entire Rocky Mountain region.\n\nThe result? Some of our finest work to date, and one of our most meaningful collaborative experiences.\n\nThe ART Hotel had to be excellent. It had to be beautiful, energy-efficient and culturally relevant.

Some of our finest work to date, and one of our most meaningful collaborative experiences.\n\nThe ART Hotel has coves throughout, but none of them are more important than the ones at the ART’s entrance. An important first impression upon entering was, for obvious reasons, deemed critical. The coves had to not only look beautiful, but provide great ambient lighting for visitors that would also complement the Juno Conix II LED track fixtures’ illumination of the stunning pieces of art by Sol LeWitt, Frank Gehry and others. With a whopping 90 CRI, 4.4 watt Acolyte Ribbonlyte LEDs were the obvious solution. While providing a clean, beautiful ambient light, they also help the Juno Conix II LEDs render the bold colors of the artwork extremely well, giving them a stunning pop. Additionally, a small amount of Acolyte RGB Ribbonlyte can be found coupled with a DMX controller surrounding the installation by famous Los Angeles Minimalist Larry Bell at the Fire bar.\n\nThe ART Hotel has coves throughout, but none of them are more important than the ones at the ART’s entrance.

Here you can find the lobby, the FIRE restaurant, bar and terrace, numerous works of art and numerous conference rooms. Everything had to look great from either inside the building or out on the terrace. The thought here was to use distinctive linear patterning with the ceiling fixtures to create a sleek, modern look. Specifying Precision Architectural Lighting’s (PAL) Microlinea Recessed LED Fixtures was a no-brainer. The Microlinea’s marriage of aesthetics and high-output performance makes it one of the best LED series on the market. The high CRI is also a must for any hallway adorned with artwork. PAL Microlinea LED Fixtures truly provided the perfect look for the ART Hotel’s 4th floor, and they look great from the FIRE terrace.\n\nThe heart of the ART Hotel is found on its 4th floor.

PAL Microlinea LED Fixtures truly provided the perfect look for the ART Hotel’s 4th floor, and they look great from the FIRE terrace.\n\nThe 4th floor of the ART Hotel is of critical importance: it houses the lobby, myriad conference rooms and FIRE, the restaurant, bar and terrace. Something special was needed to complement the PAL linear recessed LEDs and extend the unique linearity theme running along the 4th floor hallway ceilings. EDGE Lighting’s 90° Dot LEDs proved to be the perfect solution. Generating 64 lumens out of 1 watt, each Dot LED is arranged to follow the lines created by the PAL fixtures (see picture). Each EDGE Dot LED also has extremely high CRI, which was an important consideration in the design process due to the proximity of artwork (this particular hallway is currently dominated by a very cool series by Larry Bell).\n\nThe 4th floor of the ART Hotel is of critical importance: it houses the lobby, myriad conference rooms and FIRE, the restaurant, bar and terrace.

Enter the CALI MarketLite ML2000 LED String Lights. A classic choice for restaurants, bars and amusement areas, they look great, provide great energy savings over their incandescent brethren, and are extremely easy to work with. In addition to being a cinch to install, the ML2000’s versatility in the field makes them a superb choice for hospitality applications. Due to the ease with which one can create any desired aesthetic, they were an obvious choice for the staff at the ART Hotel and its Fire restaurant and bar.\n\nThe Fire outdoor terrace is stunning, but it needed a bit of extra pop above the private tables in the back (as pictured).

That’s why we specified these extraordinary LED track fixtures. With an eye-popping 93 CRI at only 16 watts per unit and an attractive body to boot, these beauties were ideal for the ART Hotel. The LED track fixtures throughout the ART Hotel have been fitted with diffusion lenses, linear spread lenses and uniformity lenses to best suit their targeted artwork. “These fixtures’ versatility and quality lets the artwork dictate the lighting rather than the other way around,” according to Greg Mackell of 186 Lighting Design Group, who aimed the fixtures. “They’re also extremely easy to work with.” The manufacturer also created a series of custom 2″ recessed fixtures specifically for the ART Hotel.\n\nThe ART Hotel’s primary aesthetic focus is on its rotating permanent collection of artwork; nothing less than the industry’s best track fixtures would do.

To do so, a dimmable LED light source that could be installed discretely in the ceiling was needed; patrons were to primarily see the effect of the luminaires, rather than the light sources themselves. These flush-mount 2″ LED Precision Luminaires were an impeccable solution. With an enormous variety of trims, pinhole options and haze reflectors, we were able to select a discreet look that offered amazing performance with minimal lighting source footprint.\n\nThe FIRE Lounge is situated between the lobby and the FIRE bar and restaurant, and offers patrons a more intimate, private place to sit and enjoy their drinks.

One of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, Denver is putting Colorado on the map for more than just the mountains, and the ART epitomizes one of the main reasons: its growing cultural relevance. The Golden Triangle Museum District has grown tremendously in the past decade, and has brought bigger and better artists and architects to the Mile High City – the ART Hotel is the culmination of both, and brings with it a style and sophistication rarely seen in mid-size US cities. The ART Hotel is also energy-efficient, its use of LEDs a testament to how far the medium has come in recent years in its aesthetic value in architectural illumination applications.\n\nThe ART Hotel is one of the most exciting new additions to a city full of changes.

Mike Ikenouye, the brilliant Preconstruction Manager at LEI who led the design-build aspect of the ART Hotel, passed away a few short weeks after its opening. A dear friend of Greg Fisher’s, Mike was deeply respected for his understanding of the true meaning of collaboration and teamwork, of what can be accomplished when people set their egos aside to work together and create something great. A humble, ethical and honorable man, Michael R. Ikenouye brought a great light into this world that will not soon be forgotten."
