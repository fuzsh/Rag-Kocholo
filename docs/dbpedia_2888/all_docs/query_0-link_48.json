        "text": "The Jacques Benedict Awards biennially celebrate excellence in classical & traditional design in our region, returning again in 2025. ICAA Award Programs across the country look to the past to honor professionals who exemplify the advancement of the classical vernacular in the various regions.\n\nThe awards honor the esteemed architect who designed nearly 80 Beaux Arts style buildings in the Rocky Mountain region in the early 20th century. Benedict’s classical proportions, restrained ornamentation and unmatched beauty continue to serve as an enduring source of delight and inspiration, and the awards recognize today’s contemporary architects, interior designers, builders, craftsmen, artisans, students and patrons whose work displays the same expression of legacy, creativity and excellence in the classical tradition.\n\nImage: 2018 Newman Award-winning project, \"Denver Union Station & The Crawford Hotel\"\n\nJeffrey Dungan Architects, KYOTO IN COLORADO, Residential Architecture Less Than 5,000 Square Feet\n\nRuggles Mabe Studio, CHATEAU Á LA CAMPAGNE, Residential Architecture More than 5,000 Square Feet Certificate of Merit\n\nKGA Studio Architects, HISTORIC TUDOR COTTAGE REMODEL, Architecture Addition/Renovation/Folly\n\nSteve Bass Architects, TWO PONDS EDUCATIONAL PAVILION, Civic/Commercial/Institutional Architecture\n\nWRJ Design, HOME ON THE RANGE, Residential Interior Design\n\nDonna Mondi Interior Design, UNDERSTATED SANCTUARY, Residential Interior Design Certificate of Merit\n\nEberlein Design Consultants, Ltd., LONE MOUNTAIN, THE GREAT ROOM, One Room Interior Design\n\nPeace Design, J.W.
