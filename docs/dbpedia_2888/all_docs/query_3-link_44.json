        "text": "Gothic Revival 1840 - 1880\n\nSteeply pitched cross gables with ornately decorated verge boards are definitive of the Gothic Revival style. Windows commonly extend into the gable ends. Rooflines were often decorated with patterned metal ridge cresting ending with a tall finials at the peak’s edge.\n\nItalianate 1840 - 1885\n\nItalianate architecture is typically boxy in proportion. Two or three story structures have gently sloping roofs with wide overhanging eaves. Paired and single brackets appear on undecorated cornices beneath the eaves. Tall narrow windows appear, singly or in pairs, frequently topped with hood moldings or pediments. Single story bays, porches and flat- roof areas are topped with balustrades. Italianate houses are least common in the southern states where the Civil War and depression that followed led to little new construction until after the style has passed from fashion.\n\nQueen Anne 1880 - 1910\n\nQueen Anne architecture presents an irregularity of plan and asymmetrical massing through cross gabling, projecting and angled bays and a variety of steeply pitched roofs. Identifying features of Richardsonain Romanesque architecture are round-topped arches that occur over windows as well as porch supports, masonry walls and round towers supporting battlements. This form of architecture became very popular for large public buildings.\n\nColonial Revival 1880 – 1955\n\nThe Colonial Revival style is somewhat less formal that the Georgian style from which it derives many of its characteristics. Colonial Revival was largely an outgrowth of a new pride in America's past and the restoration of Independence Hall in 1898. The side- gabled version was the most predominate house design- Symmetrical horizontal dimensions contain a strong cornice line and are intersected with a central entry portico. The Georgian influence often appears in battered chimneys, some of which contain windows or niches.\n\nSwiss Chalet 1885 – 1910\n\nSwiss Chalet houses are typically square or rectangular, two and one half stories in height and exhibit low-pitched roofs with wide eave overhangs. In most examples the upper story is wood covered with the lower story coated with stucco or covered with stone or brick. Most are front gabled with a second floor balcony. Flat decorative balustrades produce the lattice look that we associate with Swiss architecture. The Swiss Chalet style was never widespread in the United States, but enjoyed some popularity in Cincinnati.\n\nNeoclassical Revival 1895 - 1950\n\nGrand two-story full-height porticos, supported by classical columns, emphasize the centrality of design. Their facades contain central entries and balanced window placement. Classic cornices and prominent gables are framed with heavy molding. Neoclassical structures have solidity, weight, simplicity, with a feeling of grand scale, while maintaining freedom from excess.\n\nPrairie Style 1900 - 1920\n\nInspired by Frank Lloyd Wright this architectural style represents the relationship of a building to its natural surroundings. Structures are characterized by low-pitched roofs with very wide overhangs, one story wings or porches, the emphasis of horizontal lines, windows banded in horizontal ribbons, large square or rectangular piers, masonry flower boxes and contrasting wall materials that emphasizes the upper portion of the upper story.\n\nDutch Colonial Revival 1900 - 1925\n\nThe gambrel roof is the distinguishing feature of the Dutch Colonial Revival. The lower slope of the roof is often flared forming a deep overhang. Other characteristic elements include wide overhangs, dormers, and a porch under the overhanging eaves of the gambrel roof that is supported by columns.\n\nCraftsman Bungalow 1905 - 1930\n\nBrothers Charles Sumner Greene and Henry Mather Green are credited with inspiring tins architectural style in Southern Califon3ia in 1903. Many designs for these homes were published in House Beautiful, Good Housekeeping, Ladies Home Journal and various architectural magazines. A low-pitched gabled roof with wide unenclosed eave overhangs distinguishes the Craftsman style. Roof rafters are usually exposed and false beams or braces are commonly added under gables. Tapered square columns support porch roofs. A variety of wall surfaces are used such as brick, clapboard, shingling, stucco and concrete block.\n\nSpanish Eclectic 1915 - 1940\n\nThis architectural style uses decorative details borrowed from the entire history of Spanish architecture. Landmark houses in this style are rare outside of Florida and the Southwest. Architect Bertram Goodhue sponsored the Panama-California Exposition, held in San Diego in 1915. From this exposition, rich Spanish architectural traditions, different than the n3ission style, gained popularity. These structures were defined by tile roofs, arched entries with an arched balcony above, arcaded walkways or arcaded covered porches and decorative iron grille work. The walls are usually surfaced with stucco.\n\nStripped Classicism 1925 - 1935 (American Movement)\n\nArchitects Cret and Goodhue inspired this variation of classicism, which was devoid of ornamentation- Classical decorative elements are hinted at but are not fully expressed. This form of Classical architecture leaves molding, ornamentation and detail eluded to with only the structural and proportional systems visible."
