        "text": "[upbeat music]\n\n[Narrator] At Conde Nast Traveler, we know\n\nthat the right hotel can make a vacation truly spectacular.\n\nAnd now that we're traveling again,\n\nour annual Conde Nast Traveler Hot List\n\nof the best hotel openings from around the world is\n\nwhere to begin trip planning.\n\nEach of the 69 properties on the list wows us\n\nfor their connection to local communities,\n\nreinventive approach to food and drink, and stellar service.\n\nHere, an urban lifestyle brand in Denver,\n\na boutique addition to New Orleans, and a 1920-style estate\n\nin the heart of Texas are three of our favorites\n\nfrom this year's hot list.\n\n[playful upbeat music]\n\nIn a few short years,\n\nthe tech savvy Lifehouse Group has made waves\n\nin the boutique hotel space; bringing hip,\n\nbut destination-inspired interiors to places\n\nlike Miami and Nantucket.\n\nFor their Colorado opening\n\nin Denver's trendy Lower Highlands,\n\nthey looked for inspiration from the Wild West;\n\noutfitting the lobby with club chairs\n\nand cabinets of curiosity with turquoise jewelry\n\nand beaded Western hats; all set to a soundtrack\n\nof Wilco and Johnny Cash.\n\nA big selling point is the Italian inflected restaurant\n\nwhere you'll find leading local chef William Harris\n\nin the kitchen; plating heavenly rounds\n\nof pugliese burrata alongside local ingredients.\n\nAfter dinner, there may be no better nightcap\n\nthan the bar's signature smoked old fashioned.\n\nRooms are snug and comfy\n\nwith a selection offering Life House's\n\nvery grownup bunk beds.\n\nAll playing to the theme of the Wild West,\n\nthe pallet channels Colorado's wild flowers and cowboy past\n\nwith Le Labo in the bathrooms.\n\n[soft upbeat music]\n\nThere's a different narrative entirely at The Chloe,\n\na thoughtfully designed, new addition to New Orleans\n\nunder-the-radar Garden District.\n\nInside the converted 19th-century family home is a study\n\nin smart, sophisticated New Orleans.\n\nPetite parlors are filled with art,\n\nand outdoor yards are places for margaritas and live music.\n\nAnd this being New Orleans, the restaurant is a showstopper;\n\nserving modern takes on Creole dishes\n\nlike spicy crab baked Gulf oysters.\n\nLocal designer Sara Ruffin Costello preserved\n\nthe Victorian origin of the hotel,\n\nbut punched up the interiors to feel at home\n\nin the 21st century with plush rugs\n\nand upholstered seating and cooly painted walls.\n\nThough there are plenty of places for a cocktail\n\nfrom the porch to the hammocks,\n\na favorite may be poolside where it is not unusual\n\nto catch families who have come with kids unfurl\n\non the loungers for most of the day.\n\nRooms are spacious, light flooded and really special.\n\nAnd Ruffin Costello along with owner\n\nand local hospitality kingpin Robert LeBlanc wanted each\n\nto feel singular.\n\nKeeping with the decorative theme,\n\narmoires replace wardrobes\n\nand record players spin a collection of local musicians,\n\nwhich is just a lovely soundtrack to start your day.\n\n[mellow upbeat music]\n\nOver in Austin, think of Auberge Resorts' new\n\nCommodore Perry Estate as a retreat in the city.\n\nLike a lot of Texas, this place is huge.\n\nIt's an Italianate former home coming in\n\nat over 10,000 square feet on 10 acres\n\nthat is just 10 minutes from Central Austin.\n\nThe original owners, the Perrys, were known\n\nfor their high-flying parties\n\nat the estate during the 1920s.\n\nAnd appropriately, everything about this spot feels grand\n\nand fantastical; from the checkered floors\n\nto the English-style gardens and smartly decorated salons\n\nthroughout with pieces sourced by design whiz Ken Fulk\n\nat Texan antique fairs.\n\nAuberge has maintained the feeling of a country home\n\nwith large fireplaces and plenty of comfy couches\n\nto sink into for the day and night.\n\nAt Lutie's, named for the Perry family matriarch,\n\nhusband and wife duo Bradley Nicholson and Susana Querejazu,\n\nchannel the resort's former 1920s glamor\n\nin the ornate dining room\n\nwhere nearly everything served is hyper-local\n\nincluding fruit plucked\n\nright off the trees dotting the property.\n\nFor something really special, have the staff set up a picnic\n\nfor you under the tent;\n\nit's one of so many reasons why\n\nyou will never have to leave the\n\nimpeccably manicured grounds at all.\n\nThese three hotels from Conde Nast Travelers Hot List make\n\nthe return to travel easy and enjoyable.\n\nBrought to you by Capital One.
