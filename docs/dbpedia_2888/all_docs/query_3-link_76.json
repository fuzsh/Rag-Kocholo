        "text": "Perrysburg has an unusual heritage of structures representing most of the domestic architecture styles of America from the early 1800's to the mid 1900's.\n\n​\n\nDomestic homes are of either folk houses or styled houses. Folk houses are those designed without any conscious attempt to copy what was fashionable in their time. They were just meant to provide comfortable shelter. Styled houses were built with at least some attempt at being fashionable. As such, they show the influence of shapes, materials, detailing, or other features that make up architectural style that is or was currently popular.\n\n​\n\nMost of our architecturally stylish houses, especially along Front Street, are classified as Victorian. But Victorian is not an architectural style. It is a period of time (when Queen Victoria of England ruled) during which a number or architectural styles became popular and were copied here in Perrysburg. Some were designed by professional architects and some were copied from so-called pattern books which local builders could follow for construction.\n\n​\n\nThe primary Victorian styles found here include Greek Revival, Italianate, Gothic Revival and Queen Anne. Houses of the same style are not all alike, but they each have identifiable features. And they are not hard to learn. Some of these features are illustrated here.\n\n​\n\nGreek Revival houses usually feature low-pitched roofs with a wide front gable; cornice lines with a wide band of trim called a frieze; a classical pediment in the front gable; columns to support a front porch, or if not, pilasters that are intended to resemble Greek columns either at the sides of the front door or at the corners of frame houses; and front doors with a narrow band of glass panes up and down the sides, called sidelights, and a separate window or separated panes over the top, called a transom. A good example of a Greek Revival house is the one at 345 East Front Street.\n\n​\n\nItalianate houses are often box-shaped and usually have low-pitched roofs, sometimes with a crest or tower; widely over-hanging eaves supported by decorative brackets; tall, narrow windows with elaborated window crowns, or tops; and double front doors. Good examples are seen at 208 East Front or at 203 East Second Street.\n\n​\n\nGothic Revival houses usually have steeply pitched roofs, often with gables with decoratively carved vergeboards; windows with pointed arches; and front porches. A good example is the elaborately decorated one at 510 West Front Street, and the one at 333 East Front Street. Saint Rose Church is also an example of Gothic architecture.\n\n​\n\nQueen Anne homes usually have a steeply pitched roof with multiple gables and an irregular roof line; sometimes a tower at one corner with a conical roof; large front porch often extended along one or more sides; and patterned wood shingles on the second story and clapboard on the first. Good examples are at 228 East Front Street and 221 East Second Street.\n\n​"
