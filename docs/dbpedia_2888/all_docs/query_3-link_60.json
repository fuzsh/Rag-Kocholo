        "text": "Italianate-style homes were among the most popular built in the United States between 1840 and 1885. They feature a low-pitched or flat roof, symmetrical rectangular shape, tall appearance (2, 3 or 4 stories), wide eaves with brackets and cornices, square cupola, porches topped with balconies, side bay windows and heavy double doors. Roman or segmented arches are common above windows and doors and the windows are tall, narrow and double-paned. Italianate is also known as Tuscan, Lombard, or simply, bracketed style.\n\nLow-pitched or flat roof\n\nWide eaves with brackets\n\nTall, narrow windows"
