        "text": "If you’re like most people, being able to identify a building’s architectural style is about the same as being able to recognize whether your favorite song is in 2/4 time or 4/4 time. It matters little to most of us. All we know is we like certain songs and not others. Similarly, most of us may like the way a certain historic building looks, but very few of us care how the slight nuances in the size, shape or location of its elements can define it as one style or another.\n\nBut even if we don’t have a desire to learn all about the various types of historic buildings, it is still important that architectural surveys are done to help us identify the structures in our districts. Knowing a building’s style is like a blueprint. It provides clues to what a building would have looked like originally, especially if it has undergone changes in the past. Knowing a building’s style can help to determine roughly when it was built, and conversely, knowing when it was built can sometimes help us determine what style it is/was and what window styles and storefront designs are appropriate.\n\nIf we strive to respect our local heritage, then our historic buildings are vital in helping us understand the people, times, fashions, lifestyles, technologies, and industries that existed before us, and how they shaped our communities, regions, and state.\n\nBut if you’ve ever read books or researched online about building styles, you’ve no doubt found that most of the examples they show are of historic homes, not commercial structures. This can make it very difficult for the average person to make a determination about a Main Street building’s style. Also, most books or online guides show only one or two examples for each style, despite the fact that most styles have numerous variations.\n\nFurthermore, some buildings defy categorization, so preservation consultants must guess, or lump them into what I call “catch-all” styles, such as “Commercial Vernacular”, or the even more vague “Other Vernacular”. The problem is, there is then no one unifying characteristic of vernacular, so it’s difficult to use its classification as a blueprint for a renovation or restoration project.\n\nBut beyond building elements, European immigrants made their mark on the state, shaping the character of our communities here in Wisconsin when they arrived. Their old world knowledge and construction skills influenced their building material choices. Miners in Mineral Point preferred the local limestone, while Germans in eastern Wisconsin built from local fieldstone. In the Northwoods, Finns and Swedes preferred log and timber construction. In some places, like Milwaukee, immigrants built styles popular in the homeland, such as t Flemish and German Renaissance Revival style buildings. Most commonly, commercial architectural styles were borrowed from the dominant styles popularized in the eastern United States such as the Federal Style or the Italianate Style.\n\nAs a result, most of America’s popular building styles are represented within the state, from the more decorative Italianate and Queen Anne, to the more utilitarian twentieth century styles. Since most of the development in Wisconsin began in the mid-1840s, examples of early styles, such as Georgian, Colonial, Jeffersonian, or Dutch Colonial are not prevalent in the state. But one early style that pre-dated Wisconsin’s statehood is the Federal style, which survives mainly in historic mining towns in the southwestern part of the state, such as Mineral Point and Platteville.\n\nA list of the major historic commercial building styles found in Wisconsin today can be found below (in order from most prevalent to least) along with multiple illustrations of each. While virtually every building style exists in the larger cities of Milwaukee and Madison, nearly all of the examples highlighted are purposely from smaller communities, both urban and rural.
