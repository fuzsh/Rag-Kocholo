        "text": "Our hotel was founded by Walter Devereux in 1893 at the height of Westward expansion. Mr. Devereux spared no expense in building what came to be known as the Grande Dame, serving the wealthy and offering a playground to society’s elite in the heart of the Colorado Rockies.\n\nA 185-foot fountain provided an exclamation point in the center of the building’s courtyard with a 12-foot-wide waterfall and pool situated where the lounge is now located. While the scenery has changed, many things have remained the same: guests look to the Hotel Colorado to provide exceptional service and a relaxing environment to make memories with loved ones.\n\nLearn more about the history of Hotel Colorado by clicking the button below"
