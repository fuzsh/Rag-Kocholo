For our more inquisitive travelers, we’ve curated a list of well-to-do historic hotels in the Rocky Mountains and across this beautiful state.\n\nTrust us, there are many amazing places across the country that exude beauty, glam and wealth. But for those who like to try something a little different, there are few places that boast a vibrant Wild West past like Colorado. With that being said, we’ve handpicked 5 historic hotels in the Rocky Mountains and spread across the Front Rangefor you to explore. These refined relics all do their best to preserve an addictive old-world charm and grandeur reflective of their early days. So, without further ado, it’s time to experience an awe-inspiring luxury stay at some of Colorado’s oldest hotels, which have been around since the late nineteenth century.\n\nThe Oxford Hotel\n\nThe Oxford Hotel\n\nTim Romano\n\nMarissa Daily\n\nThe Brown Palace\n\nThe Brown Palace\n\nHotel Colorado\n\nHotel Colorado is known for its impeccable service, modern amenities and well-appointed rooms; and is close proximity to world-class hot springs, skiing, whitewater rafting and a 16-mile, paved Glenwood Canyon Recreation Trail for biking or hiking. The hotel also has a lot of packages to choose from to experience the best of Glenwood Springs, Colorado, which by the way, is only a 57-minute drive from Aspen.\n\nThere are more than 17 unique guest rooms with 19th-century Italy décor, and four delectable dining choices on-site. “While Glenwood Springs has much to offer its visitors including famous hot springs and a mountain-top theme park, Hotel Colorado is the central location that offers guests relaxation, an abundance of history and a truly unique experience during all of their adventures,” says Kaylyn Radden, the hotel’s Assistant General Manager.\n\nHotel Colorado\n\nTable Mountain Inn"
