        "text": "So, how do you recognize an Italianate building? When you spot a friend from a distance, you recollect not the colour of the eye or the small lines around the lip, but the overall silhouette. Eatons College Street in Toronto, the former Right House in Hamilton, the Dominion Building in Halifax, now the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, all have the silhouette of a Renaissance palazzo. They have a three or four story fa√ßade with a huge cornice held up by decorative brackets. This silhouette is the signature feature of the Italianate.\n\nThe original owners of Italianate homes would often have been third or fourth generation Canadians, probably descended from United Empire Loyalists. The Loyalists were refugees. They left the newly formed United States because they disagreed with fundamental policies of the new republic, one of them being slavery. Many of the Loyalists left beautiful properties, large homes and good lives with only the belongings they could fit on their backs or in a wagon. They would have been pleased to see their descendants living in comfort. In addition, they would have been happy to see that their descendants had maintained the same moral principles that forced their own migration.\n\nIn some of the large Italianate houses from Sarnia to Wolfville, there are small rooms in the basement with no windows and no external egress. These were not wine cellars, though they are often used\n\nas such now. They were rooms that could be neither accessed nor detected from the outside, so no escaping light or heat could betray the precious contents within. These were rooms used to house people escaping in the Underground Railway. Few records were kept, there was no website, no listing in the Yellow Pages, but a peculiarly detailed room, with a hidden entrance and possibly an undetected air source is usually a room set up for escaping slaves.\n\nUnique to Ontario is a design for a two story square residence with projecting eaves and ornate cornice brackets promoted by The Canada Farmer journal in 1865. This residence provided a classical alternative to the Gothic Cottage. Italianate residences often have a frontispiece, large sash windows, quoins, and ornate detailing on the windows and roof brackets. Classical elements are used, but in a secondary role.\n\nAlso important are the many Italianate commercial buildings found on almost any street in Ontario. The next time you are stopped at a stoplight, or someone else is driving, take note of the lovely cresting and elegant window surrounds, all cast iron, that were built in the Italianate style.\n\nAll buildings below are in Ontario."
