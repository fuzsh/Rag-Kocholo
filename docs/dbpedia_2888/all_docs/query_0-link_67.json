Zugelder. It is said that he carried out the first sample of the granite on snowshoes to be sent to Denver for testing as the potential building material for the Capital building. The granite from the Aberdeen Quarry was said to be of the finest and highest quality of its kind and therefore was selected for the State Capitol building. To transport the granite to Denver, the D&RG Railroad put in a spur to the quarry.\n\nAberdeen had a Post Office, a population of 149, and a school for four pupils. The quarry operated from August 1, 1889 to June 15, 1892. After the quarry closed, a few people continued to live at Aberdeen for a time. Today all that remains of the town is piles of weathered lumber on the ground where buildings once stood.\n\nOwned for a number of years by Louis Borland and Bill Endner, both deeded the quarry to the Gunnison County Pioneer and Historical Society. Throughout the summer months jeep tours are scheduled to the Quarry by the Pioneer Museum.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBomber Crash Site\n\nAddress: 21 miles NE of Gunnison\n\nLegal: Part of Sec 10, T15S , R83W, 6thPM\n\nCurrent Use: Tourist Site\n\nContact: USFS\n\nDesignated: May 2, 2000\n\nThe B-24E Crash Site is located near Forest Service Road 742. The B-24 crashed at the site at about 1145 hours on 19 July 1943. A small clearing in the forest marks the location of the airplane impact. Remains of the bomber are currently located within a 200 foot diameter area at 9008 feet elevation.\n\nAll ten members of the crew and one passenger, perished in the crash and their bodies were badly burned by the ensuing fire. The B-24 Crash Site is considered a funerary site; the crash severity and fire resulted in partial interment of the body of one or more crew members. A 50th Anniversary Memorial Service was held at the crash site at 1150 a.m. on 19 July 1993...the service was full military ceremony and about 75 people attended, including family members of those deceased. A bronze marker is now affixed at the site to a granite rock on which the port main strut of the crashed B-24 rests.\n\nBack to Top\n\nBon Ton Hotel\n\nAddress: 329 Main Street, Pitkin\n\nLegal: Blk. 38, Lot 21-24, Pitkin\n\nCurrent Use: Rustic Hotel\n\nContact: Joan Bannister\n\nDesignated: July 5, 2000\n\nThe original Bon Ton Hotel burned in December of 1903. It was rebuilt in 1904. The Bon Ton Hotel was considered \"modern\" not western. The exterior is of stone, and had an awning over the front windows, with a walkway under the balcony. It had a porch roof over the back extending to the outdoor toilets. There was also a pulley upstairs over the balcony door to pull up steamer trunks. Both the exterior and interior of the building is a great example of finer hotels of the era. The original windows, stairway, wainscoting, basement is still intact, including the meat room and the well. The upstairs rooms include skylights in some of the rooms.\n\nPitkin at one time was 12th in population in Colorado. The Alpine Tunnel was above Pitkin and trains came through three times weekly to carry out the ore from surrounding gold and silver mines. Many people stopped for the night at the Bon Ton Hotel and Restaurant. It is still an active Hotel, and to visit it is to step back into history. This property is also on the Colorado Historic Preservation Register.\n\nBack to Top\n\nChance Gulch\n\nAddress: 2.5 miles SE of Gunnison\n\nLegal: Parts of Sec 16 & 17 , T49N , R1E , NMPM\n\nCurrent Use: Grazing, Research\n\nContact: WSC/Bureau of Land Management\n\nDesignated: September 19, 2000 The Chance\n\nGulch Site is a highly significant archaeological site was first recorded about 1980. The site is a multi-component campsite with buried, stratified deposits that represent the Paleoindian through historic periods, circa 11,000 BP (years before present) through 50 years BP. While archaeological remains of all of the encompassed periods of prehistory stand to yield vital new information about past human lifeways, the Chance Gulch site's particular and unique significance lies in its potential to teach us about the land use and subsistence strategies of occupants of the Rocky Mountains during this period. Presently, students at Western State College participate in research of the site.\n\nBack to Top\n\nDorchester Guard Station\n\nAddress: Dorchester Townsite\n\nLegal: Part Sec 28 , R83W , T12S, 6th PM\n\nCurrent Use: Tourist Site\n\nContact: US Forest Service\n\nDesignated: September 18, 2001\n\nThe Dorchester Guard Station is one of only two original Forest Service Guard Stations remaining in Gunnison County. It represents a unique Rocky Mountain style cabin construction and remains the only structure of the old town of Dorchester. The cabin is a one-room log cabin, originally built in 1905, in a remote area of Taylor Park. It was adjacent to the stagecoach road from Tincup to Aspen. Postal service was initiated for Dorchester on August 2, 1900 and the new cabin was designated the Post Office after its construction until July 31, 1912 when the post office was discontinued. During this time period the building also functioned as a general store, stage stop, and Forest Service phone point. By 1920, the town of Dorchester was abandoned. The land and associated structures, including the cabin, have reverted back to the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nBack to Top\n\nFairview Schoolhouse\n\nAddress: 4514 County Road 730, Ohio Creek\n\nLegal: Parts of Sec 26, T51N , R1W , NMPM\n\nCurrent Use: Community Center\n\nContact: Fairview School Association\n\nDesignated: September 2, 1999\n\nFairview School was built shortly after District Number Ten was organized in 1881. The school was located on Ohio Creek on land donated by Lewis Easterly. Because of its location, with its clear views of the Anthracites and Carbon Peak, it was named Fairview School. The original two story school was built of logs and included a cloak room and stage. In 1906, the old log building was replaced with the current structure. In 1948, Fairview school was closed and the students bused to Gunnison. The building continues to be used for community functions.\n\nBack to Top\n\nGothic Townsite Buildings\n\nThe Gothic town site was established in 1879 following a silver strike up Copper Creek in what is now the Maroon Bells-Snowmass Wilderness area. The town grew rapidly and within two years contained as many as 3000 residents. The town of Gothic had a brief life and was fading into oblivion. In 1928, Dr. John C. Johnson formerly of Western State College, with others founded the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory on the town site, purchasing several of the buildings and land. Initially the Lab used many of the original buildings from the mining days as laboratories, classrooms and dormitories. Over the years RMBL has developed a reputation as one of the leading terrestrial field stations in the world. Each summer 150 scientists and students conduct research and classes. Seven buildings in the town site have been designated for their historical value including the Gothic Town Hall, Swallow's Nest, Ore House, Mammal Lab, Barclay Cabin, Mc Cloud Cabin, and the Richards Cabin.\n\nBack to Top\n\nGreat Wall\n\nLocation: 23 miles N of Gunnison, Ohio Creek Pass\n\nLegal: E2, Sec23, T14S, R87W, 6th PM\n\nCurrent Use: Tourist Site Contact: USFS\n\nDesignated: January 6, 1998\n\nEven though this Palisade was never completed, it still is an amazing structure and represents the end of an era for the Denver South Park and Pacific Railroad who dreamed of building a railway over Ohio Pass down to the North Fork of the Gunnison River and on to California.\n\nThis Palisade was built by Italian Stone Masons brought over specifically for this job from Italy as masons from this country were not capable of doing the work. This Palisade is almost impossible to see from the Ohio Pass Road even though it is close to the road. An interpretive sign has been placed at this site.\n\nBack to Top\n\nJohnson Building\n\nAddress: 122-124 N. Main Gunnison\n\nLegal:\n\nCurrent Use: Gallery/offices\n\nContact: Nancy Tredway\n\nDesignated:\n\nThe property on which the Johnson Building was built changed hands seven times in 1880 with the price fluctuating from $20 to $275. Then in 1881 the building was built on the property and Mary Thomas bought it for $250, immediately selling it for $800. Walker Burkett bought the building and the property in 1901, and when Effie Jane Lashbrook arrived in Gunnison with her sick husband and children in 1901, she took over the empty building. She turned the lower floor into a restaurant and made living quarters for her family upstairs and named the restaurant the Royal Café. Burnett leased the building to Sam and Anna Francis (Frankie) Johnson for their restaurant in 1904 and at that time, it became the Johnson Restaurant. Johnson's bought the building on October 20, 1920. Sam and Frankie (after Sam's death in 1923) continued the restaurant until Frankie died in 1942. Their daughter Sarah Trine and her husband Harry bought her brother's share. Sarah continued to operate the restaurant (summers only in later years) until 1985. In 1996, the Tredway family bought the Johnson Building from Sarah Trine. They have restored and renovated both floors of the building. The lower floor is now a Gallery where many of the original antiques are on display. The upper floors are offices.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMountaineer Site\n\nAddress: Top of Tenderfoot Mountain\n\nLegal: W2 , Sec7 , T48N , R1E , NMPM\n\nCurrent Use: Radio\n\nTransmitters/Research Contact: WSC\n\nDesignated: September 19, 2000\n\nThe Mountaineer Site is an archaeological site with several significant components. First the site contains several Folsom occupations. These areas have yielded fragments of thirty distinctive Folsom projectile points which date between 10,000 and 11,000 years ago. This time is the end of the last great Ice Age. Folsom occupations are rare and especially so in western Colorado. A second important aspect of the Mountaineer Site is the alignments of stone cairns and pits. It is believed to be a sign of game drive systems. Finally there is an early Archaic occupation on the Mountaineer Site which is evidenced by large triangular side-notched projectile points. Research is continuing on this site by Western State College.\n\nBack to Top\n\nNarrow Gauge Railroad Exhibit at the Pioneer Museum\n\nAddress: 803 E. Tomichi, Gunnison\n\nLegal: part of Sec 1, T49N,R1W,NWPM\n\nCurrent Use: Museum Exhibit\n\nContact: Pioneer Historical Society\n\nDesignated: July 5, 2000\n\nThis exhibit consists of the Denver and Rio Grande railroad depot, steam locomotive No 268 and tender, a string of five rail cars, and the water-tank. These all relate to the narrow gauge railroad which dominated the Gunnison Country between 1881 and the 1950's when the tracks were removed. The Denver & Rio Grande steam locomotive number 268 operated extensively in the Gunnison area from the time it was built in 1882 until it was retired in 1955. It is one of only three still existing of its kind. The string of cars, all built between 1885 and 1903 were used by the D&RG in the Gunnison area.\n\nThe railroad station and water tank are excellent examples showing the design of railroad buildings and structures in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nIn addition to providing transportation to and from the outside world, the D&RG route through the Black Canyon to Cimarron was a popular tourist attraction. It also made moving cattle and sheep viable for the local ranchers.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOhio City Jail\n\nAddress: Miners Avenue\n\nLegal: Lots 26 and 27 Block 16, Ohio City\n\nCurrent Use: Mailbox site\n\nContact: Gunnison County\n\nDesignated: January 22, 2001\n\nThe Ohio City Jail if one of the few original buildings remaining in the small community of Ohio City. The Ohio City Hall which is also on the County Historical Preservation list is adjacent. The jail is in remarkable condition considering that it was built in 1906. The two cells in the back of the building have bars on the doors and windows. After the closure of the Ohio City Post Office, the Postal Service installed \"cluster boxes\" for the residents of the old mining town, and permitted the community to retain the name of Ohio City.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOhio City School\n\nAddress: 115 Miners Avenue Ohio City\n\nLegal: Lots 26/27 Block A Stephensons Addition\n\nCurrent Use: Community Center/Tourist site\n\nContact: Quartz Creek Improvement Assn.\n\nDesignated: May 4, 2004\n\nDuring the early years of Ohio City, school was held for three months during the summer and three months during the winter. Children living up the gulch of Gold Creek could only attend during the summer as the snows were too deep. The first school was held in a log house and in 1895/96 school was held in the section house at Ohio City. The present school house was built in 1897 and was in continuous use until the 1945/46 term when the children were taken by bus to Gunnison. From that time until 1961, the children were taught by Margaret Flick. After consolidation of the rural schools, Mrs. Flick obtained the lease on the school house, using it as a museum. In April of 1988, the school board sold the building and land to the Quartz Creek Improvement Assn. and it has been used for winter and spring meetings.\n\nBack to Top\n\nOhio City Town Hall\n\nAddress is: 8503 County Road 76, Ohio City\n\nLegal Address: Block 16, Lot 24, Roe's Addition\n\nCurrent Use: Community Center\n\nContact: Gunnison County Date\n\nDesignated: June 18, 1996\n\nThe Ohio City Town Hall represents a significant type of architectural style predominant around the turn of the century. This late Victorian vernacular building possesses typical features from this period such as storefront glazing, front facing gable with a false wood front and tin siding embossed in a stone of block pattern. A distinguishing characteristic is the corner entrance.\n\nOriginally, the town hall building was constructed in 1906 as a mercantile company to serve the growing mining community of Ohio City. The building was then used as a restaurant for a short time before it became the Ohio City Town Hall in 1914. Now the center of public activity in town, it serves as a community center.\n\nAlterations to the town hall's exterior are minor. The storefront has been replaced with windows after being boarded up for many years. The rest of the exterior is unchanged. There are two outhouses behind the main building.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRock Culverts & Railbed Trail\n\nAddress: 23 miles N of Gunnison, Ohio Pass\n\nLegal: parts of Sec 23 & 24, T14S, R87W 6th PM\n\nCurrent Use: Tourist Site\n\nContact: USFS\n\nDesignation: December 8, 1998\n\nThe unfinished section of the railbed of the Denver, South Park, and Pacific Railroad on upper Ohio Pass (1881-1882) was known as the Ohio Creek Extension. The DSP&P had plans to access the coal fields up the Ohio Creek Valley near Carbon Peak and beyond to Floresta, then over Kebler Pass to Grand Junction and beyond. The construction was completed to the lower Ohio Creek Coal Mines at Kubler and Baldwin.\n\nMuch work went into the construction of the railbed, and it was simply abandoned before completion. The fact that it was left as \"work in progress\" gives a better glimpse of the incredible and intact engineering remnants of a bygone era. Among the visible remains are the 3 old rock culverts which were used to divert a tributary of Ohio Creek under the railbed. The water pools on the upstream side, goes down a drain, passes under rock culvert on the downstream side. Two were completed while one was not finished and gives a better idea of how they were constructed.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSewell's Gulch Gravesite\n\nAddress: 10 miles E of Gunnison\n\nLegal: Part of Sec 16, T498N, R2E\n\nCurrent Use: Cemetery/no entry\n\nContact: Bureau of Land Management\n\nDesignated: January 21, 1997\n\nThis historic site is a gravesite with at least two graves. The graves are outlined with a rectangle of local uncut rocks, which local informants claim were laid out in 1994. The site has one white marble military headstone. The engraving on this stone reads \"Charles E. Sewell, CO I 45 PA Inf.\" The other possible grave has no headstone or marker, but is suggested by a slight depression and by the size of the rectangular stone outline. There are no other depressions, however according to local informants, there may be at least ten graves clustered in two groups on this hilltop. At one time, two wooden fences enclosed the graves.\n\nCharles Sewell was born in 1846 in Philadelphia, Pa. In 1864, at the age of 19 Sewell enlisted in the 45 Penn. Infantry. Military records list his occupation as a farmer. He was discharged as a private in 1865 in Alexandria, Va. He settled in the Tomichi Creek Valley before 1880, where he died between 1879 and 1880 aged 33 or 34 leaving behind a wife, Lucinda Sewell, aged 25 and five daughters 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8. Sewell's Gulch is named for him.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSmith Opera House\n\nAddress: 114 North Boulevard Street Gunnison\n\nLegal: Blk 13, Lots 1-8 W. Gunnison Addition\n\nCurrent Use: Offices\n\nContact: Joe Puchek\n\nDesignated: October 5, 2000\n\nThe Smith Opera House was constructed in 1882 by Frank C. Smith. It is typical of those constructed in mining towns of the 1880's. It demonstrates an eclectic style of architecture including the Greek symmetry of design evident in the straight lines, gabled windows with lintels and colonnades on the front of the building. The design overlaps with the Italianate bracketed roof overhang and arched lintels over the windows. The Victorian influence that dominated this period is accented through the floor plan which features a central staircase and long, broad rooms and hallways. Red brick was used in the construction of the building.\n\nThe building was constructed with commercial use in mind, perhaps retail and office space on the first floor. The second floor was opened as an Opera House in 1883. In 1884, failed economics doomed the opera house and the building was sold at a sheriff's sale. It was then converted to rooming house/apartments and was renamed the Grand Apartments. The building has been renovated and is now in use as offices.\n\nBack to Top\n\nSpencer School\n\nAddress: 21miles SW of Gunnison\n\nLegal: part of Sec 4, T47N, R2W, NMPM\n\nCurrent Use: Tourist Site\n\nContact: Bureau of Land Management\n\nDesignated: January 21, 1997\n\nIn September of 1894, the citizens of Spencer petitioned for the formation of a school district. The petition was granted and School District #15 was soon organized. The first school was held in January 1895 in a rented log cabin. After two years, the booming mining town of Spencer decided that they could afford their own school building and in 1897 they bought a lot with a stable on it and converted the stable into a school building. By 1902 the Spencer citizens decided they needed a more substantial school in a more suitable location. They tore down the old schoolhouse and built a new building at a convenient point near the center of the town. This structure served Spencer and the surrounding area as a schoolhouse and social center of many decades, coming to an end after the abandonment of the Lake City Branch of the Rio Grande Railroad and the development of better roads and school buses. The schoolhouse was finally abandoned after the 1945/46 school year. The school is one of the few building left standing in the ghost town of Spencer. During the 1960s and 1970s the schoolhouse was used sporadically as a cow camp and hunting camp.\n\nBack to Top\n\nStar Mine\n\nAddress: US Forest Service Road 759, Gunnison\n\nLegal: Part Sec335/2 , T12S , T13S , R84W\n\nCurrent Use: Restoration/No entry\n\nContact: Dennis Larratt\n\nDesignated: January 21, 2003\n\nThe Star Mine is located in the Tin Cup Mining District in the Northwestern portion of Taylor Park. It is located in the cirque basin to the east side of Italian Mountain, North Italian Mountain, and Lambertson Peak at an elevation of approximately 11,650 feet, just below timberline. The Star Mine site includes a fully equipped shaft house, and two, two-story bunkhouses/offices. The site also housed a sawmill, of which only the sliding carriage remains.\n\nThe site retains a high degree of historical contents including a complete set of equipment and machinery. The hoisting system within the shaft house is intact and possesses all its components. The system includes a single-drum steam hoist, two large locomotive boilers, plumbing, a two-post gallows head frame. The blacksmith shop is equipped with original tools ; and the assay shop is almost as complete. The boardinghouses feature furniture and historic artifacts, as well as dated graffiti left by the original miners."
