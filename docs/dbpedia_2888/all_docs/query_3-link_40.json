        "text": "Channeling the romance of a rural Italian villa, the Italianate house leaves behind the rigid stuffiness of the past for a rambling and relaxed floor plan with the flair of a low-pitched roof, deep and decorative eaves, arched windows, and decorative cupolas for admiring the natural view.\n\nTime Period: 1840–1885\n\nCharacteristics: Low-hipped roof, arched windows\n\nPlan Your Perfect Summer Adventure: Get The Free Ultimate New England Summer Guide!\n\nEmail(Required)\n\nFamous Example: Maine is home to two fine examples: Stephen King’s spooky Bangor residence and the house museum Victoria Mansion in Portland\n\nWhere to Find Italianate Homes: In established but still prosperous and growing cities along the northeast coast\n\n1. Exterior: Decorative belvederes (seen here), cupolas, or towers\n\n2. Roof: A low-pitched design with deep overhanging eaves with highly decorative cornices and brackets\n\n3. Windows: Tall and narrow, with rounded or arched tops\n\nAimee Tucker\n\nAimee Tucker is Yankee Magazine’s Home Editor and the Senior Digital Editor of NewEngland.com.
