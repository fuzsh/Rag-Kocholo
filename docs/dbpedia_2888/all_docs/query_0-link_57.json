        "text": "Downtown's Historic Architecture. Not to be confused with Lower Downtown, the Downtown Denver Historic District was created in 2000 by the City of Denver as a non-contiguous district within the core Downtown area consisting of 43 buildings identified as architecturally or historically significant and worthy of preservation. While Lower Downtown's buildings were built primarily in the 1870s, 1880s, and 1890s as warehouse or mercantile buildings, many of the buildings in the Downtown Denver Historic District were built in the first few decades of the Twentieth Century and feature more elaborate designs reflective of their original uses as banks, hotels, and office buildings. These 43 historic buildings create a stunning contrast to the glassy modern towers that surround them, provide the framework for the urban fabric of Downtown, and greatly enrich the pedestrian and visual experience of the central business district.\n\nClick on a thumbnail to view the photograph.\n\nPhotographs were taken in May, 2006.\n\nArchitectural and historical data courtesy of the following sources:\n\nGuide to Denver Architecture, by Denver Foundation for Architecture, Westcliffe Publishers, 2001.\n\nColorado Historical Society, Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation; Directory of Colorado State Register\n\nof Historic Properties, available at: www.coloradohistory-oahp.org\n\nThe Denver Tramway building was built in 1911 and held the city's public transportation system offices and attached street-car barn until 1971. The structure was designed by the firm of Fisher & Fisher and restored in the 1990s and is now home to the upscale Hotel Teatro.\n\nThe Denver Dry Goods building was completed in various stages between 1889 and 1906 and was home to the prominent local retailer until the 1980s. In the 1990s it was fully restored and converted into shops, offices, and lofts. The building was designed by Frank Edbrooke.\n\nThe Symes Building was built in 1906 and was designed by the New York firm of Hunt & Hunt. The building was one of the first steel-framed buildings in Denver and for years was home to the Downtown Woolworths store on the ground floor. The building now holds a mix of office and retail.\n\nThe A.C. Foster/University Building was built in 1911 and was designed by Fisher & Fisher. The 12th floor appears as the building's cornice and features green pin-stripes. Now holding private offices, it once was purchased for the University of Denver, giving the building its current name.\n\nThe Tritch/Joslins Dry Goods building was built in 1887 as a 4-story building, with the fifth floor added in 1927. For decades it was home to the Joslins department store, until the the store's closing in the 1990s. The building has since been renovated into the Downtown Courtyard by Marriott.\n\nInspired by St. Mark's Campanile in Venice, the D&F Tower was built in 1911 to anchor the Daniels & Fisher Department Store. The tower barely escaped demolition in the 1970s. It has since been restored and is one of Denver's most beloved landmarks.\n\nThe venerable Brown Palace Hotel was designed by Frank Edbrooke and completed in 1892. It features carved sandstone on a base of granite and was the country's second fireproof building. Over a century later, the Brown Palace remains one of Denver's finest hotels.\n\nThe Midland Savings building, a fine example of the Early Italian Renaissance Revival style, was built in 1925 and designed by Fisher & Fisher, and features terra cotta gargoyles on the penthouse. The building was renovated in the late 1990s and is now the Midland Lofts.\n\nThe Denver Club Building, one of two Early Modernism buildings to be included in the Historic District, was built in 1954 and designed by Raymond Ervin & Associates. The building was the first tower built Downtown after World War II and the first of the city's Modernist high-rises.\n\nThe Equitable Building features a lavish Italian Renaissance Revival style and a footprint shaped like a double \"E\". It was designed by Andrews, Jacques and Rantoul and completed in 1892. Its interior is equally ornate and was built to be the finest office building in the city at its time.\n\nThe US National/Guaranty Bank Building (now the Bank Lofts) was built in 1921 and designed by Fisher & Fisher in a reserved Chicago Commercial style. In the 1980s it sat vacant and was almost razed, but fortunately received landmark status and a subsequent full renovation into lofts.\n\nThe First National Bank building (1911) was 17th Street's first \"skyscraper,\" being the first to exceed 9 stories. Its facade was covered with cement in the 1960s to \"modernize\" it, and then it sat vacant in the 1980s. After a full restoration in 1993, it is now the elegant Magnolia Hotel.\n\nBuilt in 1907 for the Ideal Cement Co. (it was the first reinforced concrete tower west of the Mississippi), the building later became home to banks. The building features a facade of travertine marble and decorative carvings, and was fully restored to its original condition in the 1990s.\n\nThe lower half of the Colorado National Bank building was built in 1915 in a neoclassical design featuring marble from the Colorado Yule Marble Company. The upper half of the building was added as an addition in 1926 with a slightly more modern interpretation of the neoclassical base.\n\nThe Ghost Building, built in 1889 and designed by William Lang, originally stood at the corner of 14th and Glenarm. In 1974, the building was disassembled and its facade's 1,700 stones placed in storage until 1984, when it was reconstructed at its present location at 18th and Stout.\n\nThe Hayden, Dickenson & Feldhauser building was built in 1891 as a brick commercial structure. In 1909 it was expanded by the addition of several floors, and in 1937, it was given its terra cotta Art Deco facade and renamed the Colorado Building.\n\nThe Filbeck Building at 1527 Champa Street was built in 1917. It was designed by Colorado architect John J. Huddart and over the years has housed the Champa Bar, the Changing Scene Theater, and is currently the home of the Bovine Metropolis Theater.\n\nThe building at 1531 Champa was built in 1907 and served as the home for the I.N. Rogers & Son Mortuary for many years. More recently, the building housed the popular Yankee Dollar restaurant from 1977 until 2000. The building still features an historic painted commercial sign.\n\nThis building was home to the Kistler Stationery Co. from its construction in 1916 until 1966. The Art Deco/ Commercial style building features glazed terra cotta pinnacles and other ornaments, and was designed by Harry Edbrooke. The building has since been converted to lofts.\n\nThis neoclassical building was built in 1910 and designed by Marean & Norton as the home to the Denver Chamber of Commerce. It was later covered with a metal facade and fell into disrepair, only to be faithfully restored in the late 1990s including the 400 electric lights in the facade.\n\nThe original Denver Fire Clay Building was built in 1892. In 1937 it was gutted by fire and rebuilt as an annex to the Buerger Brothers Building next door and given a new streamlined Art Moderne facade in the process. A recent renovation has converted the building to residential lofts.\n\nThe Baur Building was built in 1886 for Baur's Candy Company, and later became the home of Baur's restaurant until the 1970s. The structure has recently undergone a major renovation and restoration including the removal of a false front to reveal the original historic facade.\n\nThe Hover Building was constructed in 1901 to house the offices and storerooms for the W. A. Hover wholesale drug company. The structure was designed by Robert Roeschlaub and features an early Commercial style design. The building has been restored and houses a design studio.\n\nThe A. T. Lewis New Building was built in 1917 as an annex to the firm's main building next door, and features terra cotta detailing in a mix of Commercial and Romanesque Revival styles. Frank Edbrooke was the architect. The building received a full renovation into lofts in 1998.\n\nThe A. T. Lewis & Son Department Store building was built in 1891 and later expanded in 1902. The structure was designed by Robert Roeschlaub and was home to dry goods stores until the 1970s. A recent renovation has returned dry goods retail to the historic structure.\n\nThe humble A. E. Meek Trunk & Bag Company Building was built in 1896 to house the retail function for this company originally founded in 1876. The firm manufactured their products at a factory on the 2400 block of Curtis Street. The building is currently vacant and in need of attention.\n\nThe current Downtown Comfort Inn was built in 1959 as the \"Brown Palace West\" and is still managed today by the historic hotel. The pinkish hue to this early modernist tower is meant to reflect the red sandstone of its historic neighbor. The two buildings are connected by a skybridge.\n\nThis Victorian structure was built in 1880 originally as the first co-ed college west of the Mississippi. It later served as a gambling hall and brothel (the Navarre) and later as a Western Art museum. It currently houses the private art collection of Denver billionaire Philip Anshutz.\n\nThe Steel Building was built in 1923 to house the new Steel's Department Store. More recently, the building was home to Fontius Shoes until the late 1980s. Since then, the handsome building with muted Art Deco elements has sat vacant and in disrepair due to the negligent property owner.\n\nThe Masonic Building was built in 1889 and designed by Frank Edbrooke in a Romanesque style. The building was gutted by fire in 1985 leaving only its stone exterior walls. A thorough reconstruction and renovation followed, bringing it back as one of Denver's finest historic buildings."
