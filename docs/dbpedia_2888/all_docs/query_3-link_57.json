Like Palladianism and Neoclassicism, the Italianate style combined its inspiration from the models and architectural vocabulary of 16th-century Italian Renaissance architecture with picturesque aesthetics. The resulting style of architecture was essentially of its own time. \"The backward look transforms its object,\" Siegfried Giedion wrote of historicist architectural styles;[2] \"every spectator at every period—at every moment, indeed—inevitably transforms the past according to his own nature.\"\n\nThe Italianate style was first developed in Britain in about 1802 by John Nash, with the construction of Cronkhill in Shropshire. This small country house is generally accepted to be the first Italianate villa in England, from which is derived the Italianate architecture of the late Regency and early Victorian eras.[3] The Italianate style was further developed and popularised by the architect Sir Charles Barry in the 1830s.[4] Barry's Italianate style (occasionally termed \"Barryesque\")[1] drew heavily for its motifs on the buildings of the Italian Renaissance, though sometimes at odds with Nash's semi-rustic Italianate villas."
