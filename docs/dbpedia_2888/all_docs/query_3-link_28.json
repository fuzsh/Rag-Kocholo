        "text": "Italianate architecture has roots in Italy’s countryside villas, palaces, and overall romantic building aesthetic. Those ancient buildings inspired a new wave of home design that borrowed from the classic concepts found throughout a country beloved for its classic details and charm. Let’s dive into this special version of Mediterranean design to learn what makes it so appealing.\n\nHistory of Italianate Architecture\n\nEmerging in the early 1800s as part of a classic architecture movement of the time, the Italianate architectural style was inspired by Italy’s awesome and inspiring classic buildings. The goal in creating this style of home design was to share the grand and charming characteristics of Italian architecture with the world. Closely associated with the Victorian period, Italianate architecture gained popularity in Europe and the U.S. during the 19th century.\n\nWhat is Italianate architecture?\n\nFor those who dream of taking a vacation to an Italian villa or countryside estate, this architectural style is for you. Square and symmetrical, homes built in this style are typically constructed from brick, stone, or stucco with well-constructed masonry walls. Common features of these distinct homes include tile flooring, columned entryways, and rounded windows.\n\nItalianate houses typically have low-pitched roofs or a belvedere to capture views and emphasize verticality. The windows are a focal point of Italianate home exteriors. Tall and narrow, they are decorated with elaborate crown molding or hoods, evoking the grandeur of palatial Italian buildings. The Italianate style comes in many shapes and sizes, from townhouses and row houses to countryside estates and mansions.\n\nSome home designs reach way back through history. Greek Revival architecture is inspired by the principles of design formed in ancient Greece. These stately homes evoke a formal and traditional atmosphere akin to the feeling you get standing in the presence of the Parthenon. Let’s explore the history and features of these unique homes to understand what makes them so special.\n\n5 Features of Greek Revival Architecture\n\n1. Grand Entryways with Columns: The columns found in Greek Revival architecture are the defining characteristic of the style. Without these towering features, these homes simply wouldn’t feel the same. When used in a residential setting, columns help to create a feeling of grand stature by combining stories and stretching the verticality of the house. Columns were commonly found in important buildings constructed in ancient Greece, and today, they give Greek Revival architecture its timeless appeal.\n\nTimeless Home Design\n\n2. Large Front Porches: In a residential setting, ample porch space creates a natural connection between the home and the outdoors. For all their grandeur, the way these homes are designed, there’s still a connection between them and their surrounding environment. As Greek Revival spread throughout the United States in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, different variations of the style were adopted to fit needs of the homeowners in different regions. However, porch space remained a universal feature of homes created in this style.\n\n7 Vintage Design Elements That Are Still Popular Today\n\n3. Decorative Windows: If the columns don’t give it away, the decorative dormer windows found in Greek Revival homes are a telltale sign of the style. These important features maximize natural light, which is perfectly displayed in the open layouts commonly found in these homes. The windows stretch vertically to complement the columns and give a very structured look to the exterior.\n\n4. Ornate Details: Looking back at the most inspirational and renowned design works of ancient Greece, it’s no wonder that the opulent detailing of these magical buildings continued to be an important feature during the revival period. Intricate molding, ornate carvings, towering columns, and luxurious tile designs all reinforce the beauty of these homes. Marble was commonly used throughout these homes originally, inspired by the ancient Greeks’ preference for the rock in their building construction.\n\nTimeless Tile Designs\n\n5. Greek Revival Architecture Color Scheme: The dominant color in the Greek Revival palette is white. Yes, white marble was prevalent throughout temples in ancient Greece, but the preference for white amongst the designers behind the revival movement had just as much sway in how we see this style represented today. Many Greek Revival homes found today are constructed with wood or stucco and painted white. In terms of interior design, this typically whitewashed palette gives you a clean slate to decorate on top of. Primary colors and natural, organic hues pair well with these classic buildings.\n\nColorful Modern Design Trends for Your Home\n\nTo refine your taste in real estate and learn about different residential exteriors, explore our Architectural Styles page.\n\n­­­­­­Featured Image Source: Getty Images – Image Credit: mtcurado\n\nThere’s so much beauty in the countries that border the Mediterranean Sea, it’s no wonder the design style derived from this area of the world has the same effect on a home’s interior. Mediterranean interior design, part of the larger coastal design family, creates interiors that harmonize with the outdoors. Here are a few of its most common features.\n\n5 Features of Mediterranean Interior Design\n\n1. Mediterranean Materials\n\nThis style borrows primarily from the longstanding traditions found in Greece, Spain, and Italy, with additional influence from Mediterranean countries like Morocco and France. People have lived in this area of the world for thousands of years, each civilization attaining high levels of achievement in art and culture. Accordingly, the common materials that make up this interior design style show a timeless appeal. Dark wood, marble, or terra cotta tile are popular flooring choices, while the walls are typically made of stucco or plaster.\n\nTimeless Home Design\n\n2. Mediterranean Color Palette\n\nPrepare to be inspired. The colors found in a typical Mediterranean palette are tailor-made to make your interior come to life. Each hue is a rich variation of the colors we’re most familiar with in interior design. Golden yellows, olive greens, rich reds, and cobalt blues form the basis of the Mediterranean style. These colors all pop against a white stucco backdrop and evoke liveliness while being grounded in natural and organic elements like the sun, trees, and water.\n\nColorful Modern Design Trends for Your Home\n\n3. Harmony with Nature\n\nThe ultimate Mediterranean interior is at one with nature; it’s somewhere you can walk around barefooted while a gentle breeze blows through the room. From its exposed wood beams to natural stone walls, everything about Mediterranean interior design embraces the outdoors and the elements derived from it. Open-air patios are often the central entertaining space, putting an emphasis on indoor-outdoor living.\n\n5 Ways to Incorporate Nature into Your Home\n\n4. Mediterranean Decorative Elements\n\nOverall, Mediterranean design takes a less-is-more approach to home décor. Relying on the natural beauty of its elements, its philosophies on design have more in common with mid-century modern interior design than, say, eclectic style. Common decorative items include textured walls, tapestries, mosaic inlays, and Italian-style pottery and art. The countries that form the inspiration for Mediterranean style all have their unique take on sculpture art, commonly found in historical buildings and traditional architecture. Accordingly, sculpted detailing is a fitting décor feature in this style.\n\n5. Bringing People Together\n\nAt the end of the day, people are an important part of Mediterranean interior design. Family spaces are a priority, as are communal seating arrangements in areas like the living room, dining room, and outdoor patio. Once you design your home this way, you can’t help but invite family and friends over to celebrate together. The open spaces and natural elements create a welcoming environment that is meant to be shared.

With its uniquely detailed decorations, it helped to define the style of homes in its era. These special homes still exist in large numbers today around the world, perhaps none more famous than San Francisco’s “Painted Ladies” near Alamo Square pictured above. Let’s dive into the history of Victorian architecture and some of its defining features.\n\nWhat is Victorian Architecture?\n\nBursting onto the scene in the mid-1800s, Victorian architecture spawned several styles, creating multiple branches of the Victorian home design tree. Borrowing elements of other architectural styles of that era such as Gothic, Greek Revival, and Italianate, the highly ornate style reflected the expensive taste among the British people of the time, who were experiencing increased wealth due to the industrial Revolution. Much of the work required for building Victorian homes could be done by machine, and due to the industrial innovations of the time, the parts could be easily shipped across the country by train. Pretty soon, Victorian homes were popping up everywhere.\n\nFeatures of Victorian Architecture\n\nTwo to three stories\n\nSteep, pitched roofs\n\nHigh ceilings\n\nWood construction with detailed woodwork\n\nDecorative trim and crown molding\n\nTowers and turrets\n\nSpacious porches\n\nRecessed balconies\n\nIron railings\n\nBay windows\n\nStained glass\n\nStyles of Victorian Homes\n\nThough there are several styles of Victorian homes, they are all multiple-story structures with steeply pitched roofs. Part dollhouse, part palace, their vintage character remains popular today. The Stick Victorian style resembles a gingerbread house with its decorative cladding and trim. The Queen Anne style is known for its asymmetry and cross-gable rooflines, while the Folk style is more symmetrical, cutting down on excessive ornamentation. As if the architecture itself wasn’t loud and eclectic enough, many Victorian homes were painted in bright colors to further differentiate their style from other homes—especially Queen Anne Victorian homes.\n\nTo learn more about the various styles of home design, visit our Architectural Styles page:\n\nWindermere – Architectural Styles\n\n­­­­­­Featured Image Source: Getty Images – Image Credit: Mlenny\n\nOne look at a Tudor style house and you’re instantly transported to the English countryside. This distinct architecture dates back hundreds of years, borrowing elements of Renaissance and Gothic design, and later experienced a revival in the United States that continued to grow in popularity through the mid-twentieth century. Similar to cottage homes, their medieval imagery evokes a storybook charm, and their unique combination of materials makes for a truly signature look.\n\nFeatures of Tudor Style Houses\n\nKnown for their brown-and-white color scheme, Tudor style houses are typically built from stone or bricks, with a façade of stucco and exposed timbering framing. The framing creates straight lines that connect each level of the home, giving it a sense of geometry. Their steep-pitched, intersecting gabled roofs are tailor-made for climates that experience high levels of precipitation; snow slides off before accumulating, and rainwater has a natural path to the gutter system.\n\nFrom the outside of a Tudor home, you can imagine sitting around the hearth under exposed wood ceiling beams, taking in the cozy atmosphere as the fireplace crackles. And your imagination would be spot on! A large fireplace is a central feature of these homes, given that they were the primary heating source for households early on in their history. Arched entryways with stonework accents, decorative chimneys, and narrow, closely grouped windows are also defining features of Tudor architecture.\n\nOnce World War II-era housing development began to shift toward addressing suburban sprawl affordably, the masonry-heavy Tudor style house became less popular. However, they are still found throughout the U.S. today.\n\nTo learn more about the various styles of home design, visit our Architectural Styles page:\n\nWindermere – Architectural Styles\n\n­­­­­­Featured Image Source: Getty Images – Image Credit: quackersnaps\n\nThe distinct rambler architectural style is known by several names: rambler, ranch house, California ranch, and more. Whatever you call it, it has played an important role in the evolution of the American home. From its spacious interior to its welcoming layout, these homes are tailor-made for a comfortable home life.\n\nHistory of the Rambler House\n\nIt wasn’t until the 1950s and 1960s that the rambler became a staple of domestic American life as the suburban boom reached new heights. The intention behind the architecture was simple: design the perfect post-war American home. The term “rambler” was a reference to the way the single-story design sprawled—or rambled—across the landscape. This home design mirrored the landscape of the American West and allowed for expansive views of surrounding land on a level plain.\n\nOver time, the rambler style began to take on elements of modern design and eventually evolved into split-level homes, creating variants such as “raised ranch style,” “suburban ranch style,” and “storybook rambler.” To this day, these homes are found in great numbers across the country.\n\n5 Features of Ranch-Style Rambler Homes\n\n1. Low-Pitched Roof and Eaves\n\nSimilar to the Craftsman style home, it’s common for ranch-style homes to have low-pitched roofs and overhanging eaves. These architectural features help to give ranch-style homes their distinct sprawling look.\n\n2. Open Floorplan\n\nRamblers are known for their open interiors that allow for easy movement throughout the home’s horizontal spaces. The spacious layout is often anchored by a central area which creates a feeling a continuity between rooms, a concept that was influenced by modern architecture.\n\n3. One-Story Buildings\n\nThough their wide layouts make for large footprints, the majority of rambler homes are one-story structures. The terms “rambler” and “ranch house” are used interchangeably. However, raised ranch houses and split-level ranch houses will often have a basement, whereas the classic rambler home is a one-story building with a ground-level entry.\n\n4. Attached Garage\n\nThis was one of the first architectural styles to incorporate an attached garage into the home design. This evolution in home design perfectly suited the needs of the modern American family in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n5. Connection to the Outdoors\n\nIn another nod to modernist homes, ramblers often prioritized outdoor spaces for entertaining and gathering. This connection to the outdoors is reinforced by large windows and easy access to back patios to create a connection between nature and the home itself.\n\nFor more information on different home designs, check out our Architectural Styles page.\n\n­­­­­­Featured Image Source: Getty Images – Image Credit: JohnnyGreig\n\nSome architectural styles go hand in hand with certain environments. A-Frame architecture is a popular design of lodge-style homes, cabins, and other dwellings in wooded or mountainous areas. Its steeply angled roofline is its most defining characteristic, giving the homes designed in this style a truly unique aesthetic.\n\nA-Frame Style Architecture\n\nAny home designed with an A-Frame architectural style stands out amongst its neighbors. The roof structure that starts near the foundation and rises together to a point at the roof’s apex, creating a capital “A” shape, is a unique take on what is usually a more horizontal line elsewhere in residential home design. The vertical nature of an A-Frame roof allows snow to easily slide off rather than accumulate and cause damage. This is just one reason why these homes are so popular as cabins, lodges, and mountain homes in snowy climates.\n\nA-Frame designs are often used in vacation homes. Their unique structures compliment forested and mountainous landscapes, making them a perfect choice for homeowners looking to purchase or build vacation homes in natural surroundings. Usually two- or three-story buildings, A-Frames typically utilize the top floor as a loft. The roof lines make a triangular shape, perfect for large windows that let in lots of natural light and capture panoramic views. Relatively simple to design, A-Frame homes often have smaller living spaces due to the decreasing square footage from bottom to top.\n\nA-Frame homes have become so popular that prefabricated design kits are now widely available. Building an A-Frame from scratch and purchasing a ready-made kit both have their respective advantages. The kits are generally faster to build, cut down on wasted materials, and give you the opportunity to build your own cabin home. Building from scratch gives you more control over the elements of design and allows you to make modifications as desired before the home is finished. Between the two options, what’s more affordable depends on the size of the home, whether additional preparatory work is needed on the property before building, contracting costs, and more.\n\nTo learn more about A-Frame homes, cottages, colonial style, and other home designs, head to our Architectural Styles page:\n\nWindermere – Architectural Styles\n\n­­­­­­Featured Image Source: tyerivercabinco.com – Image Credit: Kyle Smith\n\nOf all the alternatives to single-family detached homes that remain popular today, row houses may have the longest history. Some of the oldest and largest cities on the East Coast such as New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia still have row houses in great numbers. These iconic structures have served as the backdrop for some of America’s most beloved TV shows, including Full House and Cheers. Given their storied history and prime location, row houses represent the best of the past and the present in home design.\n\nHistory of Row Houses\n\nSince their beginning in the early 1600s, row houses have presented an economical solution to housing for home builders. They allowed builders to divide a plot of land into different living units that increased the number of tenants on the property. In the 19th and 20th century, the easy-to-build and inexpensive nature of the housing style fit the building demands of the era, and they proliferated throughout what are now some of the country’s most popular metropolitan areas.\n\nDifference Between Townhouses and Row Houses\n\nThere are slight differences between townhouses and row houses. Row houses share a common façade along a street, whereas townhouses may be grouped throughout a development. Row houses have a consistent roofline and share a common wall, whereas townhouses may not adhere to the same uniformity of height and width.\n\nBoth types of housing may be governed by a Homeowners Association (HOA), which lays out guidelines for property upkeep and maintenance, enforces restrictions on making addition/remodels, and charges monthly fees that go toward the community’s shared spaces, property maintenance, and amenities.\n\nOne well known variety of row houses is the “brownstone.” As the name suggests, brownstones’ signature exterior is a mixture of sandstone that produces a dark brown color. Brownstones are commonly found in historic districts throughout New York City, such as Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Harlem.\n\nRow Houses and the “Missing Middle”\n\nRow houses, along with duplexes, courtyard apartments, and other similar housing types, were constructed in great numbers prior to World War II but are now far less commonly built. The term “Missing Middle” was first coined by Opticos, a team of urban designers and strategists who realized that this type of housing was largely missing in today’s market. In an episode of Monday with Matthew, Windermere Chief Economist Matthew Gardner explained how these “missing middle” housing types can improve housing affordability:\n\n“And the key function of this type of housing is to meet the rising demand for walkable neighborhoods, respond to changing demographics, and provide housing at different price points. You see, rather than focusing on the number of units in a structure—think high rise apartments or condominiums—this type of housing emphasizes scale and heights that are appropriate for and sympathetic to single-family or transitional neighborhoods.”\n\nFor more information on the various architectural housing styles, visit our Architectural Styles page.\n\n­­­­­­Featured Image Source: Getty Images – Image Credit: benedek"
