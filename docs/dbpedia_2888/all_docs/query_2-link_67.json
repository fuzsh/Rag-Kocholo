        "text": "HOSPITALITY-FOCUSED DESIGN\n\nJNS is a leading architecture and interior design firm in Denver, built on 30+ years of experience. With a portfolio spanning hotels, multifamily housing, adaptive reuse and historic preservation projects, our approach is universally rooted in a sense of storytelling and community impact. For us, this human-centered ethos is the essence of hospitality, a spirit of service toward the end-user—whether neighbor, tenant or guest.\n\nThe Ramble Hotel\n\nThis 32,000 square foot, 50-room hotel has become a local landmark in Denver’s gritty, colorful RiNo neighborhood. With architecture informed by the surrounding historic warehouses and interiors inspired by the tradition of “salons” as community hubs for the exchange of ideas, this project evokes a sense of history far older than its 2018 opening.\n\nArt Studios\n\nThis office-to-residential conversion was inspired by the building’s former life as the home of the Art Institute of Colorado. Peeling back layers of additions and dirt, our work showcases the building’s relevance as a treasure of modern architecture, while creating 192 versatile micro-units and engaging community spaces.\n\nPierside South\n\nJust 45 minutes north of San Diego, this live-work development was envisioned as an elevated, yet attainable apartment community by the Oceanside pier. Inspired by the laidback ethos of Southern California, this amenity-rich, natural light-filled property is both a work-from-home and commuter-friendly paradise.\n\nDowntown Denver Sheraton\n\nOur renovation of this 1950s I.M. Pei landmark was inspired by the explosion of midcentury leisure and business travel. A study in geometry and light, our goal was to create a definitive arrival and hospitality experience for the hotel lobby, ground-floor bar and meeting rooms."
