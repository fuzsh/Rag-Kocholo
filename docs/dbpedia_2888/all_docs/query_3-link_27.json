        "text": "Lisanne! says:\n\nVenetian architecture has long been a standard to which architects aspire to equal. Here on the United States, Venetian, and other Italianate styles are the inspiration for some really fine buildings. Unfortunately there are some whose talents for design are small, and they, as well as their clients, lack the critical ability to recognize the difference between class and crass. The results of this may be comical to view, but seeing such tasteless design offends the sensitivities of those who do appreciate the artfulness of an intelligently concieved structure.\n\nIn NYC this trend towards tastelessness has reached a zenith. The most garish of buildings advertise their \"Italianate\" influence as selling points. These \"palaces\" misuse every feature distinctive of Italianate architecture (along with other styles) in such garish proportions that the result looks more like the facade of an amusement park than a office or residential building. Italian visitors to New York City would be appalled to see what is being presented by developers as Italianate buildings. And just when New Yorkers thought they had seen the worst of the worst along comes a developer who conceives a design so horrible that Venice should sue to protect their good name.\n\nIt's called the Venetian, and it is being built in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn. A short distance from where this is being constructed there is a community of Italian Americans which dates back to the early years of the last century. I assure you that these people are quite offended by this misapplication of Italianate style, and even more offended by the naming of this monstrosity.\n\nClaiming inspiration from such notable Italian architects as Palladio, they describe the Venetian as having a \"dramatic and distinctive exterior design reminiscent of Renaissance era Italian architecture.\" I would say \"comedic\" would be a more applicable description, but those of us who see it aren't laughing. As for distinctive, it is definitely distinctively tasteless. As for it being reminiscent of Renaissance Italianate architecture I can only say that it's parody not imitation.\n\nThis is a photo I took of the \"monster' a few weeks ago.\n\nNow this awful exercise of architectural excess will contain residences for the wealthy. The prices for these apartments start at over a million dollars. Will people actually pay that much money to live here? In New York, one never knows. But they ought to change the name. If only out of respect for real Venetian architecture.\n\n9:20AM, 28 June 2008 PDT"
