        "text": "The Hotel Maxwell Anderson (formerly The Hotel Denver) is a new chapter in our Glenwood Springs hotel’s rich history. Experience the same hospitality our first guests did 100 years ago, blended with modern rooms and suites with a century of stories to tell.\n\nEvery room has been completely renovated and updated with modern bathrooms, plush new bedding, and modern amenities, balanced by the charm of the exposed brick and antique accents of our 100-year-old hotel. We’ve also added several new suites, ensuring your stay is as stylish as it is comfortable.\n\nPrepare to be dazzled as you walk into our brand-new, larger lobby, which is filled with rich new lounge chairs and couches and a crackling fire.\n\n“staff went out of their way”\n\n“My fiancé and I came up to Glenwood Springs for our five year anniversary and were blown away at how beautiful the town was. Hotel Maxwell Anderson was a great place to stay. Coming from Denver we love our beer and it was awesome that the hotel had a brewery inside. The beer and food were very tasty and reasonably priced. What made our stay at Hotel Maxwell Anderson was the employees, their kindness and hospitality were beyond amazing. We forgot our day passes for the hot springs and the hotel staff went out of their way to drop them off for us so we could enjoy the hot springs. I definitely recommend staying here!”\n\nZachary F.\n\n“fell in love with this hotel the minute we walked in”\n\n“We came to Glenwood for a weekend get-a-way and the original hotel we had booked was not what we were expecting. We came to the downtown area and fell in love with this hotel the minute we walked in and decided to book a room here for the weekend. It is very clean, nicely decorated, in a great location, and the service here is the best you will receive! The staff truly changed the beginning experiences of our weekend! Don’t make the mistake of ‘shopping around,’ book at this hotel and you won’t regret it!”\n\nJeremy H.\n\n“I wish we could give this place six stars”\n\n“This is the second time my wife and I have stayed at this charming hotel in Glenwood Springs. The staff is so wonderful! They were able to get a pet friendly room and were instrumental in helping the three of us in having a great night! When we checked out the next morning, the staff member at the front desk was so helpful and her warm personality helped us to start our day off right. I wish we could give this place six stars for its warm atmosphere, friendly helpful staff and great brew pub and food! STAY HERE, you won’t be disappointed!”\n\nMarc W.\n\n“great view of the river and the hot springs pool”\n\n“I had been planning a romantic weekend with my husband, and I chose the Hotel Maxwell Anderson for our stay. The hotel is historic, interesting, and quite pleasant. Check in was easy, and we were given instructions about convenient parking and easy ways to access the hot springs pool and other restaurants. The room was delightfully cute and historic, and had a great view of the river and the hot springs pool. This was a lovely place to stay, and we will definitely be back!!”\n\nMeredith D.\n\n“Best hotel stay and best room I’ve ever had”\n\n“This place is a slice of heaven. The front desk staff had been exceptional from start to finish. Not only is the hotel AMAZING, the staff is as well. My initial reservation was for one night. Realizing we needed a little more time on our getaway weekend, the staff worked with us to get us an amazing room with the best views. We will be back, and we will definitely be staying here again. Best hotel stay and best room I’ve ever had by far.”\n\nShyann S."
