        "text": "ByGretchen Small\n\n•\n\n28 May, 2021\n\n•\n\nWhat I love about the study of history are the interesting little stories you come across. This is the case with this month’s blog. At first glance, two photographs from the archives do not tell much of a story.\n\nWe see Mary Deere, her daughter Anna Wiman, and Anna’s son Charles. The setting tells us little. It is just a sweet picture of three generations of one family.\n\nThe story grew as it led us in a different direction through the inscription on the back of one photograph. I could tell that this photograph was taken the same time and location as the one above. The inscription includes, May 1896, Glenwood Springs. (See Below) I wasn’t surprised when I saw the name of a hot springs. A trip to a hot spring was very popular during the late 1800s and early 1900s. The healing waters were a popular destination for families, the wealthy, and the famous. Other photographs in the collection show the Deere family visiting Baden Baden in Germany, Hot Springs in Arkansas, and French Lick in Indiana.\n\nOut of curiosity, I wondered what Glenwood Springs was like and through the glory of google, I came across a brief history of the town. What drew my eye was the photograph of the hot springs and the Hotel Colorado. (See below) The central courtyard with the arched entrances led to my next research step. Hotel Colorado still exists so I emailed them. I sent them our 1896 photograph to see if it was taken in their courtyard. A staff member promptly answered me that our photograph was taken in their courtyard.\n\nHotel Colorado at Glenwood Springs, Colorado. “In 1888, the world’s largest hot springs pool was born in the newly established town of Glenwood Springs. It became world-renowned as a healing wonder set in a mountain paradise.” The sandstone bathhouse and lodge were built for $100,000 in 1890. Go to https://www.hotelcolorado.com/our-hotel/history to read more about the hotel and its interesting history during World War II.\n\nShe also shared several other historic photographs which give us a clearer picture of what the Deere family experienced at Hotel Colorado.\n\nI can imagine Mary and Anna walking through these spaces and taking Charles out to the courtyard to play with his toy train. I wish I knew why they decided to go to Glenwood Springs. Did one of the family go for the healing waters of the springs? I assume they traveled by rail to reach the springs. Today the railroad still runs along the Colorado River through Glenwood Canyon.\n\nI hope you have enjoyed this month’s little story. I never know where my research will lead, but I do enjoy these pieces of history."
