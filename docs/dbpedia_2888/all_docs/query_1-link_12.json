        "text": "A charter member of Historic Hotels of America, The Strater Hotel has stood as a renowned local landmark in downtown Durango for more than a century. This magnificent historic holiday destination debuted at the height of the Gilded Age, just as the specter of the Old West was starting to fade away into history. Durango itself was transiting into a modern American town, having operated as a remote mining camp for many years prior. Dozens of modern commercial enterprises opened in the heart of Durango, as did a wealth of brilliant residences that conveyed the latest architectural styles of the age. Amid this great cultural transformation arrived a pharmacist from Cleveland named Henry Strater, who saw great economic opportunity in Durango’s immediate future. Determining that a contemporary Durango required a grand hotel, Strater endeavored to develop such a business in the center of town. But the cost of construction proved to be too prohibitive, prompting the aspiring hotelier to form a partnership with his father, Frank Atone, and his two brothers. Together, they constructed a brilliant building that featured an eclectic mixture of Italian Romanesque, Renaissance Revival, and several other popular forms. The project was quite the undertaking, as it ultimately took some $70,000 to construct the new hotel. (For context, the family spent roughly $1.7 million in today’s currency.) Furthermore, the Straters had to use more than 376,000 red bricks just to create the exterior façade!\n\nWhen the building finally opened as “The Strater Hotel” in 1887, it quickly endeared itself among the residents of Durango. Many even reserved guestrooms during the winter months when their homes became too cold. Interestingly, Henry Strater never desired to operate the business himself, deciding to lease it outright to H.L. Rice. Instead, Strater spent his time operating a pharmacy at the corner of the hotel, which occupied most of his time. Under Rice’s tutelage, The Strater Hotel emerged as the primary social gathering spot in all of Durango by the start of the 20th century. Many fell in love with the hotel’s stunning array of luxurious conveniences, which separated it from any other hotel for miles. Each guestroom, for instance, contained its own wood-burning stove and lavish décor. A few even contained pianos and washstands. But all was not well between Rice and Henry Strater. In a surprising twist, Strater had forgotten to exclude his own pharmacy from the lease, enabling Rice to levee high rent onto the business. The move infuriated Strater, who subsequently opened a second, rival hotel nearby called the “Columbian Hotel.” Both men were soon embroiled in a fierce rivalry that lasted for years. Yet, the lingering national effects of the Panic of 1893 eventually bankrupted each hotel. In the wake of the economic crisis, the Bank of Cleveland repossessed The Strater Hotel and sold it to Hattie Mashburn and Charles E. Stilwell. The two worked in concert to revitalize the ailing business, investing heavily into its growth. They made The Strater Hotel a destination for those who yearned for sophistication, offering programs that ranged from operatic performances to fine dining.\n\nStilwell and Mashburn remained in control over the building until 1926, when Earl A. Barker, Sr., acquired it with a group of fellow investors. Barker then set about preserving The Strater Hotel’s prestigious status that his predecessors had striven so hard to create. Barker and his family continued to operate The Strater Hotel for the remainder of the century, with his son, Earl Barker Jr., eventually taking over the business. Alongside his wife, Jentra, Earl Jr., made sure that the hotel’s historical charm was never lost. Illustrious guests continued to visit The Strater Hotel as well, including actor Will Rodgers, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, and the original band members of The Grateful Dead. President Gerald Ford also stayed at the hotel twice and a few of the Apollo astronauts had traveled to the destination, too. Renowned author Louis L’Amour was known to live at the hotel, specifically residing in Room 222 for weeks at a time. In fact, L’Amour wrote most of his novels involving the fictional Sackett family inside The Strater Hotel! Several nations even meet at The Strater Hotel to discuss the “6th Trans-Atlantic Treaty,” in which the members agreed to establish new telephone lines between North America and Europe. Then in 1983, Roderick E. Barker—Earl’s son—assumed complete control over The Strater Hotel. Rod has since followed in his family footsteps, overseeing his own extensive series of renovations that have persevered the character of the business. Working with master woodworker Charles Schumacher, he redesigned many of the hotel’s iconic venues, including the Office Spiritorium, the Mahogany Grille Restaurant, and the Pullman Room. Today, The Strater Hotel continues to be among the best places to stay in all of Colorado."
