REJOIXIIER SUBNITTEII BY THE GOVERNllENT\n\nOF THE UNITE11 STATES OF AkIEKICA\n\nThis Rejoinder is in ansurer to the Reply filed by the French\n\nGovemment in this case on February 15, 1952.\n\nThe procecding was instituted hy the French Govemmcnt as\n\na result of difficultiesbetween the Parties \\\\.hich followed the\n\nenactment by Morocco on Ilecernber 30, 1948, of a decree\n\nre-establishing in full force and effect prcvioiis Moroccan legis-\n\nlation absoliitclyprohibitiiig the import into &Iorocco of al1\n\nforeign goods and merchandisc, excepting French imports.\n\nThe legal issues placed beforc the Court by the Government\n\nof France in the Application, and by the Government of the\n\nUnited States by way of counterclaim, are, in the order followed\n\nin hoth the Counter-Mernorial and the Reply :\n\nThe econoriiic issue, involving:\n\nThe validity of a treaty right to freedoin of importation,\n\nThe proper method of customs \\.aluation of imports uiidcr\n\nthe Act of Algeciras,\n\nThe application of taxes to Amcrican imports in Morocco;\n\nThe issue of extraterritorial jurisdictiori, and the corollary\n\nirnmunity of American citizens, in the absence of assent by this\n\nGovernrnent, [rom the application of the local law.\n\nThe argiiments presented in the Reply on thesc various points\n\nwill no\\\\, be examinecl and answered in the ortler indicated. CHAPTER 1\n\n. 171~~~ ï0 I~i1~0l<rFKEEI.YIWO &~OHOCCO\n\n(liel>ly, pp. 17-31)\n\nIiicstablishing in the Couritcr-Alemorial its cl;iiiii to a rcgiinc\n\nof frce trade barring prohibitions on imports, tlie Governmeiit\n\nof the United States relied, through the most-favored-nation\n\nclause, upon the provisions of the British Treaty of 1856; the\n\nSpanish Treaty of 1861 and the Act of Algeciras (1111 3.27-343,\n\nVol. 1). III the Reply, the French Government conteiids that these\n\nl)rovisions do not support the claim.\n\nThe argument of the French Government is twofold. It denies\n\non the one hand the existence in the British Treaty of 1856 and\n\ntlie Spanish Treaty of 1861 of provisioiis barriiig generally prohi-\n\nbitions on imports. These treaties. according to the argument,\n\nwhile recognizing the priiiciple of liberty and equality in niatters\n\nof commerce, reservcd the right for hlorocco to decrcc any prohi-\n\nbitions on imports as long as the prohibitions were not discn-\n\nmiiiatory nor vexations (Reply, pp. 18-19). Even if these treaties\n\nbarred prohibitions on imports, moreovcr, the Act of Algeciras\n\ninodifieil and transformed their meaning and effect by iiitrodiicing\n\na regime of liberty aiid equality which clearly did not bar i\\Iorocco\n\nfrom enacting such prohibitions (lieply, p. 20). It asserts on the\n\nother hand that thc right to impose any prohibitions for the\n\npurpose of l'ordre public, was already included in the Treaties\n\nof 1Sj6 and 1861 and was indeed recognized in the .Act of Alge-\n\nciras ; Morocco, the argument states, \\vas required by the Act\n\nto become a modern State ; thus it \\vas authorized to enact al1\n\nprohibitions the purpose of which is to maintain l'ordre public,\n\nal1 previous treaty provisions to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nk1:leasuresof coritrol' of imports arc rncasures based on considera-\n\ntions of l'ordre p~iblic,and are, therefore, measures permitted by\n\nthe Treaties (Reply, pp. 20-26).\n\n(1) Consideratiori must first be given to the side of the French\n\nargument which denies the existence in the treaties and the Act\n\nof Algeciras of a regime of free trade \\vithout prohibitions on\n\nirnports. The British Commercial Treaty of Deceinber 9, 1856,\n\nestahlishes Ireedoiii of commerce as its controlling principle in\n\nArticle 1:\n\n\"Theri: sliall be reciprocal freedom of commerce between the\n\nI3ritislidoininions anclthe dominions of the Sultan of Morocc....\"\n\n(Counter-Jlemorial. Annes 21.) KEJO~NDEX OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV 52)\n\n94\n\nThe scope of the principle is defined with respect to the two-\n\nfold aspect of trade-exportation and importation-and in terms\n\nwhich are striking precisely because of their general character.\n\nWith respect to exportation, Article 5 of the Treaty reserves to\n\nthe Sultan the righb ta prohibit exports from Morocco :\n\n\"Should the Sultan of Morocco at any time think proper to\n\nprohibit the exportation of any kind of grain or other article of\n\ncommerce from his dominions ....(Counter-Memorial,Annex 21.)\n\nWith respect to importation, on the contrary, the Sultan expressly\n\nundertakes in Article 6 not to prohibit imports, exception made\n\nfor enumerated products :\n\n\"Merchandise or goods, except the articles enumerated in\n\nArticleII, imported by British subjects in any vessel, or from any\n\ncountry, shall not be prohibited in the territories of the Sultan\n\nof Morocco ....(Counter-hfemorial.Annex 21.)\n\nThe general character of the undertaking is emphasized in Article z,\n\nwhich lists the products referred to in Article 6 :\n\n\"The Sultan of Morocco engages ta abolish al1 moiiopolies or\n\nprohibitions on imported goods, except tobacco, pipes of al1kinds\n\nused for smoking, opium, sulphur, powder, saltpetre, lead, arms of\n\nal1kinds,and ammunition ofwar ....(Counter-Alemorial,Annex 21.)\n\nAccording ta the Reply, however, the general character of this\n\nbar against prohibitions on imports would be negated by other\n\narticles of thetreaty where the Sultan is recognized by implication,\n\nit isasserted, ta possess a discretionary right ta prohibit al1imports\n\n(Reply,p. 18). Such is, according ta the Reply, the case of Article 5,\n\nin fine :\n\n\"....No prohibition, eitheras to the exportation or importation\n\nof any article, shall applya British subjects, unless such prohibi-\n\ntion shall apply to suhjects of every other nation.\" (Counter-\n\nMemorial, Annex 21.)\n\nThe argument is that since Article 5 in fine does not specify what\n\nprohibitions on imports are involved, the prohibitions refer to\n\nany imports and any exports. This argument ignores the mles\n\nof construction ordinarily applicable in the matter. If there is\n\ndoubt as ta the meaning or the scope of the prohibitions referred\n\nta in Article 5 in fine, it is enough ta look ta Article 5 as a whole,\n\nand to Articles z and 6, to perceive readily that the Sultan had\n\nretained a right to prohibit some imports and al1 exports. The\n\nSultan, as a result, could at any time grant in respect ta bath\n\nsome specific imports and all exports more advantageous rights\n\nta other foreigners. British citizens, therefore, were guaranteed\n\nby Article 5 in fine that the prohibitions applicable under the\n\ntreaty in respect to some specific imports and al1 exports would\n\nnot be applied ta them unless they applied equally ta al1 others. REJOINLlEK OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV 52) 95\n\nAt no tiinc do the texts give risc to the implication that ail imports\n\nwere subject to prohibition. It should be noted, moreover, that\n\nthe French argument is predicated to a very large extent upon\n\na misleading translation of the English text of Article 5 in fine\n\nwhich changes the meaning and effect of the words \"any article\"\n\nby changing their relationship in the sentence to the words\n\n\"exportation and importation\". In the English text, \"any article\"\n\nclearly refers to bath \"exportation and importation\". In the\n\nFrench text, the clause is divided and the words \"any article\"\n\nare thus made to appear to refer only to the word \"importation\" :\n\n\"No prohibition, either as to the exportation or importation of\n\nany article, shall...\"\n\n\"Aucune prohibition, soit quant à l'exportation, soit quant à\n\nl'importation d'aucun article ne s'appliquer....\"\n\nThe Spanish Treaty of Novcmber 20, 1861, like the British\n\nTreaty of 1856, reserves to the Sultan the right to prohibit exports\n\nin Articles 48 and 50, and bars generally prohibitions on imports\n\nin Article 49 :\n\n\"The merchandise and produce imported into ports of Morocco\n\nby Spanish subjects, from any place or country, shall not be\n\nprohibited in the territory of the Sultan of Morocco....\"(Counter-\n\nMemorial, Annex 22.)\n\nIt also contains, like the British Treaty, refcrences to \"articles\n\nnot prohibited\" or \"articles the importation and exportation of\n\nwhich are not prohibited\" (Articles 44 and 45). The Reply,\n\naccordingly, also draws in the case of this treaty the inference\n\nthat the Sultan therehy reserved a discretionary right to prohibit\n\nany import, and emphasizes that there is no mention in this\n\ntreaty of a specific list of imports over which the Sultan reserved\n\na right to prohibition (Reply, p. 19). This reasoning, however,\n\nis open to objections. Whether there be or not a specific list of\n\nprohibited imports, the French Government reaches the same\n\nconclusion ;if the existence of the list were a controiling factor,\n\nthe French Government should reach opposite conclusions with\n\nrespect to the two treaties. The French Government reaches in\n\nthe Reply ccinclusions which contradict its analysis of the British\n\nand Spanish treaties in the Memonal ; there it emphasizcd the\n\ngeneral character of the commercial freedom afforded by these\n\ntreaties and the strictly limited character of the exceptions to\n\nthis freedom :\n\n\"(a) Commercial freedom.\n\nThe principle of reciprocal freedom of commerce is asserted\n\nbetween Great Britain and Spain, on the one hand, and Morocco,\n\non the other hand. Thc entire freedom of commercial transactions\n\ncarried out by foreigners onMoroccm territory is also guaranteed\n\n(Great Britain, Art.I,2, 4, 6; Spain, Art. qq, 45, 47.49).96 l<l<JOlSi)Ei<OF THE U.S.A.

Artjaiid 7; Spain, Art. 4S\n\n;uid jo).\" (Italics added;translatioii;Mernorial,p. 40, Vol. 1.)\n\nThe argument, finally, is not based on reasonable rules of con-\n\nstruction. Article 49 dcals specifically with imports. Articles 44\n\nand 45 dcal with local commercial transactions in Morocco, not\n\nisith imports or esports. Such refcrences as they contain to\n\n\"prohibited\" articles are incidental and subsidiary to thcir piirpose.\n\nThey do not justify, therefore, giising to Article 49 a meaning\n\nprccisely oppositc to the one it has by its plain terms. Article 49\n\naccordingly should not be coiistrued as reserving to the Sultan\n\na discretionar? right to prohibit aiiy import but should retain\n\nits plain meaning of a general obligation not to prohibit imports.\n\nl'hc explanation for the referenccs to prohibited imports in\n\nArticles 44 and 45 is that the import of certain prodiicts had always\n\nand traditiorially bcen prohibited in Morocco. Whether expressly\n\nstated, as in the British Treaty, or tacitly espressed as in the\n\nSpanish Treaty. those prohibitions always remaiiied in force. The\n\npoint has been noted by a French authority on bloroccan treaties\n\nwho commented \\\\rith respect to the regime of free importation\n\nprovided by both the Spanish and thc British Trcat'ics :\n\n\"Tlie iinport:rtion has always beeii prohibited of tlie following\n\nproducts :arms of al1types, ammunition of war, powder,saltpetre,\n\nsulphur, Icad, tobacco and other herbs for smoking....\" liouard de\n\nCard, Les Traitd éesComn~ercc eoriclisrrrleMuroc(1907)9, ilote 4,\n\n61, note I (traiislatioii).\n\nWith respect to the Act of Algeciras, thc French Go\\rernment\n\ncontends that the regime of commercial freedom established by\n\nthe British and Spanish Treaties was not in any everit incorporated\n\niii the Act. Al1thc Act coiitains, according to the French Govern-\n\nment, is the affirmation of a vague priiiciple of eco~iomic libcrty\n\nwhich does not bar prohibitions on imports. Thc mcre fact of\n\nhaving recourse to prior treaties to cstablish the nieaiiiiig of this\n\nprinciple is, according to the Reply, an admission that the Act\n\nper s6 does not bar prohibitions on imports (Reply, pp. 20-21).\n\nBeyond thesc assertions, the French Keply presents no argu-\n\nments and proceeds to determiiic the incaning of thc principle\n\nof economic liberty by referencc to international agreements\n\nconcluded after World War 11. At no time does it answer the\n\nfully documentcd argument of the Counter-bfemorial which, it\n\nis beliered, clearly established that the iriclusion of the principle\n\nof economic liberty in the Act was intended precisely to guarantee\n\nto the parties their traditional right to a regime of comrncrcial\n\nfreedom mithout prohibitions on imports. There is no need to REJOINDER OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV52) 97\n\nrepeat this argument (see Coiinter-Memorial, pp. 330.335, Vol. 1).\n\nexcept to the extent ofnoting that, for the purpose ofestablishing the\n\nintent of the parties at the time, the recourse made in the Counter-\n\nMemorial to the history of the diplomatic negotiations leading\n\nto the conclusion of the Act of Algeciras \\vas proper and in con-\n\nforinity with accepted principles of interpretation.\n\nIt is submitted that the French Reply fails in its contention\n\nthat the British and Spanish Treaties and the Act of Algeciras\n\ndid iiot establish a regime of free trade without prohibitions on\n\nirnports.\n\n(2)Consideration must now be giveu to the other aspect of\n\nthe French argument according to which the Act of Algeciras,\n\nas well as previous treaties, must be interpreted as authorizing\n\nal1 prohibitions motivated by a desire to maintain l'ordre Pz~blic,\n\nincluding prohibitions on imports (Reply, p. 23).\n\nPrior to dealing with the substance of this argument, the Gov-\n\nernment of the United States notes that the problem, as presented\n\nand developed hy the French Government, is strictly a problem\n\nof interpretation of treaties. In the circumstances. the argument\n\npresented in the Reply caüs for two preliminary observations.\n\nAccording to generally accepted principles of interpretation,\n\ntreaty provisions must be construed in the manner most likely\n\nto reflect the intent of the parties at thetime thetreaty was concluded.\n\nThe principle is practically axiomatic in international law. While\n\nnot expressly admitting as much, the French Reply obviously\n\nproceeds on the theory that the Act of Algeciras should be inter-\n\npreted as though it arere being concluded today. This reasoning,\n\nit is submitted, does not meet the issue, since the issue is the\n\nintent of the parties to the Act in 1906, and not their intent if\n\nthey were to conclude the same agreement today.\n\nIn order to justify the absolute prohibition on imports re-\n\nestablished in effect by the Decree of December 30, 1946. the\n\nFrench Reply puts a great deal of ernphasis on the motivation\n\nof so-called ordre jbzbblicwhich inspired such prohihition (see\n\nReply, p. 24). The motives which induced an act may not he\n\nentirely irrelevant to.the determination of its legality. Yet treaty\n\nprovisions may be violated, and are indeed frequently violated.\n\nfor good motives as well as had. To predicate a treaty violation\n\non good motives instead of bad ones does not make it the less\n\na violation. The issue here is not whether the absolute prohibition\n\non imports of December 30, 1946, was induced by a good motive,\n\nbut, rather, whetlier it violated the principle of economic liberty,\n\nas interpreted in the light of the intent of the parties to the Act\n\nof Algeciras at the time of its drafting.\n\nTuming now to the examination of the concept of ordre Public\n\nwhich is the substance of the French argument, the Government\n\nof the United States subrnits that it is not an accepted principle\n\nof interpretation. Indeed. it does not appear to be a principle\n\n798 REJOINDEH OP THE U.S.A. (18IV 52)\n\nof international law at all, so far as an examination of decisions\n\nby international bodies and the works of recognized authorities\n\ncan estahlish. The principle is a principle of domestic law, and\n\nmore specifically of civil lawl where it is understood by this\n\nGovernment to fulfil in some respects purposes which are covered\n\nin the common law by the concept of public policy. Leaving\n\naside the question whether the transposition of a principle of\n\ninterpretation from domestic law to international is a proper\n\nprocedure, the manuer in which the principle is utilized by the\n\nFrench Govemment in the present case gives rise to the most\n\nserious objections.\n\nThe French Govemment starts from the preinise that measures\n\nfor the protection of public health, protection of public morals,\n\nand control over trading with the enemy are measures designed\n\nto insure Z'ordre$ublic and involve some degree of prohibition\n\non imports. They have been put into effect pursuant to inter-\n\nnational agreements in point or as a part ofa program of reforms\n\nand modernization of the lloroccan State. If the Act of Algeciras\n\nestablishes a regime of free trade without prohibitions on imports,\n\nthe French Government States, I\\lorocco must be deemed illegally\n\nto have concluded such international agreements or to have\n\nattempted to become a modem State. Or, in the alternative,\n\nthe Act of Algeciras must be construed as permitting any prohi-\n\nbitions on imports based on the ground of ordre$ublic, as contended\n\nby the French Government. Since au prohibitions based on\n\nfinancial and monetary considerations are based on the ground\n\nof ordre public, they are permitted under the Act of Algeciras\n\n(R~P~Y. P. 23).\n\nThis argument, in the view of the United States Government, is\n\nspecious because the problein of interpretation need not and does\n\nnot arise in the terms imagined by the French Government. The\n\nfirst alternative set up by the argument is entirely artificial. It is\n\nnot necessary to conclude that because the Act of Algeciras estah-\n\nlishes a regime of free trade barring prohibitions oii imports,\n\ninternational agreements coiicluded by Morocco for the protection\n\nof public health, public morals and the control of trade in time of\n\nwar have been illegally concluded. No problem arises when the\n\nparties to the international agreements in point are aiso parties\n\nto the Act, since the later agreements prevail over the Act to the\n\nextent necessary for adaptation of its relevant provisions. No prob-\n\nlem arises when, the measures being based entirely upon clomestic\n\nlegislation, the parties to the Act overtly or tacitly assent in the\n\nresulting modification. And if the problem of interpretation does\n\narise, it is perfectly reasonable to interpret the principle of economic\n\nliberty as meaning that imports shaü not be prohibitcd except\n\nthose genuinely needed for the protection of public health and\n\nAleaning the çystemç of domestic law which derive from Roman law KEJOIXDEK OF THE U.S.A. (18IV j2)\n\n99\n\nniorals aiid control of trading with the enemy in tinie of war. Thc\n\nsecond alteniative is equally artificial and is no more than an argu-\n\nment of dialectics directed to the establishment of an incorrect\n\nsyllogism. Assuming as a premise that measures for the protection\n\nof public health and morals and control over trading with the\n\nenemy are designed to insure l'ordre public,it reaches the conclusion\n\nthat al1 prohibitions based on l'ordre public are permitted under\n\nthe Act. The strict conclusion of the syllogism, however, irnposed\n\nby the very terms of the premise on which it is predicated, is that\n\nprohibitions in furtherance of measures which are assumed to\n\ninsure I'ordrepublic-i.e. those for the protection of public health\n\nand morals and trading with the enemy-are permitted under the\n\nAct. In both cases, the French argument results iii unwarranted\n\ngeneralizations.\n\nThe Government of the United States submits, moreover, that\n\nthe theory of ordrepublic advûnced in the argument is of a character\n\nso arbitrary as to clearlyommand its repudiation both as a general\n\nprinciple of international law and as a principle of specific applica-\n\ntion in this particular case.\n\nThe theory of ordre public advanced in the Reply is not a cohe-\n\nrent and organized theory. The Reply does not even attempt to\n\nindicate its meaning in some general sense; much less does it\n\nattempt to suggest the limits of its application. The specific cases\n\nwhich are listed as being normal applications of the theory of\n\nordre public are disparate cases among which there is little if aiiy\n\nrational relationship, unless it be that any purpose in which the\n\nState has an interest is covered by the theory. Any doubt on this\n\npoint cannot subsist in the face of the flat assertion of the Reply\n\nthat al1 restrictions placed on imports on financial and monetary\n\ngrounds are restrictions based on considerations d'ordre public\n\nbecause their purpose is to protect the financial or economic\n\ninterests of the State. There are no import restrictions or prohibi-\n\ntions for which some financial or economic justification cannot be\n\ngiveu. The theory of ordre public advanced by the Reply simply\n\nuur~orts to vest such arbitrarv <us>ifications with the character\n\nbf îegitimacy.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to point to the threat to the stahility of\n\ninternational relations which is imulicit in this conceut of l'ordre\n\n$~61ic.Besides being an innovation: the theory is a negation of the\n\nwhole interriational treaty structure. since it permits States to\n\navoid treaty obligations through the simple expedient of selecting,\n\nif not creating, a given interna1 condition and claiming that corn-\n\npliance with the obligation would create a danger, actual or threa-\n\ntened, to the amorphous whole known as l'ordre pz~blic.It is a\n\nrejection of the established procedures of negotiation and agreement\n\nbetween parties for modification or adjustment of treaty obliga-\n\ntions iii favor of a rule of interpretation based entirely on the uni-\n\nlateral and arbitrary action of one of them. The sweeping scopc100 REJOIIIDER OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV52)\n\nof the theory can be best illustrated by pointing out that if Morocco\n\nmay reject the obligations of the Act of Algeciras on the groiind of\n\nordre pzdblic,MO~OCC mOay just as ive11reject its obligations under\n\nthe Treaty of Protectorate of 1912 on the ground that further\n\ncompliance is prejudicial to its ordre9ublic. Indeed, if the theory\n\napplied in this case, it would apply a fortiori to the Treaty of Fez.\n\nsince the threat to tordre fiz~blicresulting from lack ofindependence\n\nand self-government might conclusively be shown by Morocco to\n\nbe direct and actual, while the threat to l'ordre9ublic resulting from\n\nfinancial and economic difficulties under the Act is hypothetical,\n\nas will now be estahlished.\n\nThe theory of ordrefiziblic,iii the present iiistancc, is predicated\n\nupon a misleading confusion between the interests of France and\n\nthose of Morocco. According to the French Reply, import prohi-\n\nbitions are based on considerations d'wdre fiublic when their\n\npurpose is to protect either the financial or the ecoiiomic interests\n\nof the State cnacting them. The import prohibitions in this case\n\ndo not appear to be so motivated.\n\nThe French Zone of 3Iorocco has heen absorbed iii the French\n\nfranc area by making the currencies of the two areas freely con-\n\nvertible one into the other. The Moroccan franc, moreover, has\n\nbeen rigidly pegged to the value of the French franc. Thus, the\n\nMoroccan currency is not an independent currency seeking its\n\nown level, but a currency tied, as a result of an enforced parity,\n\nto the fortunes of the French monetary system. including its\n\ndevaluations, shortages, and other difficulties. The financial cori-\n\nsiderations upon which France relies in this case, accordingly,\n\nare not really those concerning Morocco, but primarily those\n\nconceming France. It is significant in this connection that in\n\nadducing evidence to justify the imposition of the prohibitions\n\nof December 30, 1948, in Morocco, the French Memorial should\n\npresent a chart of the rates of exchange of dollars on the French\n\nblack market. and figures relating to the inflationary effect of\n\nfree transactions on the French franc. Since the prohibitions at\n\nissue are primarily intended to protect the financial interests\n\nof France, the theory of ordre fiz~blicadvanced in the French\n\nReply is utilized in a misleading and inaccurate manner. Correctly\n\nstated, the French argument is that import prohibitions enacted\n\nin Morocco are primarily intended to protect l'ordre fiziblic of\n\nFrance.\n\nThe subordination of the Moroccan hancial system to the\n\nFrench system permits the channeiiing of trade between the\n\ntwo areas and the preferential development of French economic\n\ninterests in Aloroccowhiie proportionaliy reducing the opportunity\n\nof the local State freely to select its sources of supply of goods\n\nand services. It permits France to circumvent the guaranty of\n\nequality of treatment of the Act of Algeciras by sweepingly\n\ndenying eiitry to al1foreign goods on grounds of balance ofpayment HEJ0ISI)EH OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV 52) 101\n\ndifficulties, and excepting on the contrary ali goods coming from\n\nFrance for which no paymerit difficulties can anse since the\n\ncurrencies are freely and artificially interconvertible. The economic\n\nconsiderations upon which France relies in this case, accordingly,\n\nare not so much those concerning Morocco as those concerning\n\nFrench interests in Morocco. It is significant in this connection\n\nthat the French Government, while agreeable to liberalizing\n\nimport prohibitions in France proper and the overseas territories\n\nof France pursuant to an agreement between the States parties\n\nto the Organization for European Economic Co-operation, failed\n\nsimilarly to liberalizc the import prohibitions applicable in\n\nAforocco, a position which is indicative of a desire to maintain\n\nprotection for French goods (Rejoinder, Annex 1).The economic\n\nconsiderations in point, like the financial considerations which\n\npredetermined them, do not support the contention that the\n\nprohibitions in this case are intended to protect l'ordre 9zcblic\n\nof Morocco.\n\n.4ny possible doubts about the tme motivations of the import\n\nprohibitions established on December 30, 1948, and which ordre\n\n$z~blicthey were intended to protect, are removed by the explan-\n\natory statenient offered in this connection by the French Resident-\n\nGeneral of Morocco in date of January II, 1949. The prohibitions,\n\nhe stated, were imposed on formal order from the French Govern-\n\nment, and despite his own objections:\n\n\"You know Iiow this question arises.

(18IV 52)\n\nand economic interests of France and Morocco cannot be separated\n\nis not to providc a valid answer to the issue in this case. The\n\nassimilation of such financial interests, resulting in an assimilation\n\nof economic interests, has taken place indeed from the early days\n\nof the Protectorate. At the same time, however, no attempt,\n\nor no senous attempt, has ever been made by France to provide\n\nMorocco with an independent financial system of its omn. The\n\nFrench Govemment has made a choice of policies. The Govem-\n\nment of the United States does not need to consider the intrinsic\n\nvalidity of these policies. Indeed, it has conducted its program\n\nof Economic Co-operation on this very assum11tion and has left\n\nit to the French Govemment to utilize the financial aid extended\n\nunder this program, within the framework of whatever financial\n\npolicies France maintained with blorocco. But the French Govern-\n\nment cannot rely on the fact that a financial assimilation exists\n\nto argue that it has become entitled to a right to disregard existing\n\ntreaty obligations. It would be tantamount to arguing that the\n\nFrench Govemment may properly choose to impose upon the\n\nMoroccan financial system the vicissitudes which afflict its own\n\nin order to become entitled thereby to disregard restraining treaty\n\nobligations, instead of organizing or re-establishing the independent\n\nand separate financiai system which will be needed by the Moroccan\n\nState when France has concluded the mission of trust which it\n\nassumed by the Treaty of Protectorate. The French Govemment\n\ncannot create an artificial situation, for which there are obvious\n\nalternatives, and rely on the situation so created to nullify the\n\ntreaty rights of other Powers. Finally, to the argument that the\n\nprotection of the financial interests of one is necessarily beneficial\n\nto the protection of the other, it is sufficient to aiiswcr that this\n\nopinion does not appear to be shared in Morocco. Thus, the\n\nCouncil of Government, a body elect, is on record as objecting\n\nto the harmful effect of artificial panties between the French\n\nfranc aiid the hloroccan franc, and advocating separation of the\n\ntwo currencies :\n\n\"In the present circumstances the monetary problem cannot\n\npass unnoticed and the question of our franc presents itself in al1\n\nits acuteness.\n\nLet us examine the factors which militate in fnvor of a legal\n\ndissociation of our currency.\n\n(1)Economic factors :\n\nIf the importance of a currency is judged only hy the purchasing\n\npower which it represents, on the interna1plane as on the external\n\nplane, the hIoroccan franc, in this regard, occupies a position\n\nfavorable for the eventuality of its independence.\n\nsustain itself without foreignsupport, but this thesis is wrongsincc\n\nit is and can be established on unquestionably st;lhlç h;ises,such as I REJOIXDER OF THE U.S.A.

The right to maintain L'ordre Public the\n\nFrench Government states, is an absolute right, inherent to the\n\nvery sovereignty of the State. Since it is absolute and unqualified,\n\nthe French Govertiment contends it invests the State with the\n\nunilateral and nrbitrary right to impose any prohibitions based\n\non consideratioiis d'ordre fwbli r,espective of treaty obligations\n\nto the contrary. The other parties to the treatiescreating the obliga-\n\ntion have no right to rccluest prior consultation or the conclusion\n\nof an agrcenient to suspend or modify the obligation. While they REJOINDER OF THE U.S.A.(18 IV52)\n\n*O4\n\ncannot be prohibited from challenging the validity of the prohihi-\n\ntions, they must have resort to other legal remedies in international\n\nlam. if they wish to obtain the removal of such prohibitions\n\n(Reply, P.25).\n\nIn the view of the United States Govemment, this is nothing\n\nbut a thinly veiled claim on the part of the French Government\n\ntoan absolute right to discard at willailfettering restrairits attached\n\nby the treaties to its actions in hlorocco, while preserviiig a color\n\nof legality through the expedient of the theory of ordpubli c.e\n\nFrench Government twice expressly disclaims that the principle\n\nof economic liberty without inequality of the Act of Algeciras has\n\nbeen in any sense abrogated (seeReply, pp.24 and 27).At the same\n\ntime it proposes to make of the principle an empty shell and\n\nrender it devoid of any practical significance by subjecting its\n\napplication in any given case toan arbitrary ruling by the French\n\nGovemment that L'ordre publi requires its suspension. By itself,\n\nthe claim is inconsistent with the obligations of the French Govern-\n\nment as a party to the Act of Algeciras, and a repudiation of the\n\nspecific promises to maintain and respect such treaty obligations\n\nwhich the French Government expressly assiimed as a condition\n\nprecedent to its assumption of political power in Morocco. It is\n\ninconsistent, moreover, with the mission wh'ichis incuinbent upon\n\nit by virtue of its position of protecting Power, sincc it proceeds\n\non a theory of ordre pzcbl nhich, mhile purporting to protect the\n\ninterests of the protected State, in effect seems to l>e designed\n\npnmarily to protect itsown. The Government of the United States\n\ncould not be a party to a course of action which purports to nullify\n\ntreaty limitations which, properly assented to by the sovereign of\n\nMorocco, have become in effect its constitution and its charter and\n\nrepresent, in the peculiar relationship of a protectorate, the\n\nguaranties of' its survival and progressive rehabilitation to a\n\nposition of independence and self-government.\n\nThe Government of the United States has always been ready,\n\non the other hand, to negotiate with both France and Morocco\n\nany iemporary or permanent arrangement consistent with the\n\nexistence of these guarantees. Contrary to the assertiori of the\n\nReply (p.25), the Counter~Memorialof the United States has not\n\nintroduced the slightest confusion in maintaining that the tcm-\n\nporary waiver or suspension of its treaty right had to result from\n\nbilateral negotiations. The principle that mutual consent is legally\n\nnecessary to suspend the operation of the treaty is valid at al1\n\ntimes. independently and irrespective of any other consideration\n\nsuch as the practice of assent under extratemtorial jurisdiction,\n\nand the more so in a situation of this type where the treatics are the\n\nconstitutional guaranties of the State of which the fundamental\n\ninterests are at issue.

For anothcr, Article VIII,\n\nSection 6, of the Agreement dcals with the possibility that parties\n\nmay have anterior engagements conflicting with the exchange\n\nrestrictions contemplated in the special or temporary circumstances\n\nspecified in the Agreement, and expressly provides :\n\n\"Where under this Agreement a member is authorized in the\n\nspecial or temporary circumstances specified in the Agreement to\n\nmaintain or establish restrictions on exchange transactions, and\n\nthere are other engagements between members entered into prior\n\nto this Agreement which conflict with the application of such\n\nrestrictions, the parties to such engagements will consult with one\n\nanother with a view to making such mutually acceptable adjust-\n\nments as may be necessary.

It would\n\nbe a most peculiar result if the desire of the parties to establish\n\npolicies appropriate to their mutual needs, including palliatives to\n\nFrench financial difficulties, should be carried out by bilateral\n\nagreement, but construed as permitting one of them unilaterally\n\nand arbitrarily to impose upon the other its understanding of the\n\nmeans by which such mutually-agreed policies should be imple-\n\nmented.

ASSESSMEN TF CUSTOM S~UTIES\n\n(Reply. pp. 31-38)\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Government of the United States\n\nmaintained that, under Article 95 of the Act of Algeciras, customs\n\nduties on imported merchandise should be assessed on the basis\n\nof its value on the market of origin plus expenses incidental to its\n\ndelivery to the custom-house, but not includiiig customs duties\n\nand storage fees. (See Counter-Memorinl, pp. 343-354. Vol. 1.)\n\nThe French Government does not question as such this inter-\n\npretation, and admits both the validity of the method and its use\n\nby the customs aiithorities in I\\lorocco (see Reply, pp. 32, 33 and\n\n37). The French Government contends, however, that Article 95\n\ndefines customs value as the value of the merchandise at the time\n\nand place it is presented for customs assessments and that, under\n\nthis interpretation,Article 95 admits concurrently of two methods\n\nof valuation :the mcthod supportcd by the United States, and an l<EJOINDER OF THE U.S.A. (18 I\\'52)\n\nIo?\n\nadditional method according to which customs diities on imported\n\nmerchandise are calculated according to the prevailing price of\n\nsimilar merchandise on the Moroccan market on the day it is\n\npresented for customs assessment, deduction made of customs\n\nduties and storage fees.\n\nThe text of Article 95, in the view of this Government, does not\n\nadmit of the concurrent existence of the two methods of valuation\n\nwhich the French Government advocates. The text provides the\n\nfollowiug clues to the calculation of ad valorentduties : the customs\n\nvalue is \"the cash wholesale value\" of the merchandise \"delivered,\n\n\"rendue\", at the customs house and \"free\", \"franche\", fromcustoms\n\nduties and storage dues. Tosupport the CO-existenceof two methods\n\nof valuation. the French Government supplies a general principle\n\nof calculation which is not in the text of Article 95. The customs\n\nvalue, the Reply asserts, is always the value \"at the place and on\n\ntheday\" the merchandise is presented for assessmcnt (italics added ;\n\nReply, p. 37).This element of time ,ccording to the Reply, would\n\nbe implicit in the word \"delivered\", \"rendue\", since \"...it would\n\nappear to be a condition inherent in both men and things that they\n\nshould never be in a particular place without being there at a parti-\n\ncular time as well ....\"(Reply, p. 33). This pronouncement is true,\n\nbut entirely irrelevant to the issue. The question is not whetherthe\n\nmerchandise being \"delivered\",\"rendz~e\", is there on a particular\n\nday. The question is why the customs value should be determined in\n\nrelation to the localmarket price on the particular day of assessment.\n\nThe Reply fails to supply any justification forthe introduction of an\n\nelement of calculation which cannot be found in the text of Arti-\n\ncle 95.The Reply does not explain, moreover, how the principle that\n\nthe customs value is always calculated \"at the time\" of presenta-\n\ntion of the irnport for assessment can lead to two entirely opposite\n\nconstructions of the relevant elements of calculations provided by\n\nArticle 95. Under the method of valuationadvanced by this Govern-\n\nment as exclusive, and admitted by the French Government to be\n\na valid alternative method, \"cash wholesale value\" means the\n\nvalue of the import on the foreign market where it is bought.\n\n\"Delivered\", \"rendue\", accounts for transportation and other\n\ncosts incidental to completed delivery. \"Free\", \"franche\", means\n\nthat the customs duties are at no time included in the calculation of\n\nthe customs value of the merchandise. Under theadditional method\n\nwhich the French Government reads in Article 95, \"cash whole-\n\nsale value\" becomes the sale value on the local market, \"delivered\",\n\n\"rendue\", determines theday upon which the value of the merchan-\n\ndise is evaluated, and \"free\", \"franche\",means that the customs\n\nduties are subtracted from the customs value.\n\nThe texts of Articles 82, 85 and 86, further, do not admit of the\n\nccmcurrent existence of the two methods of valuation which the\n\nFrench Governmclit rcads into Article 95. The method of valuation108 REJOISDEK OF THE U S.A. (18 IV52)\n\nupon mhich the French Government and the United States Govem-\n\nment are in agreement leads to a reasonable and rational construc-\n\ntion of Articles82, 85 and 96. Since the primary consideration is\n\nthe value of the merchandise on the market where itwas bought,\n\nArticle 82 properly requires the importer to file a declaration of\n\nvalue which is a personal estimate, based on variable factors\n\nwithin his own knowledge. The customs authonties must then\n\nindependently estimate the value of the merchandise to check it\n\nagainst the declared value, but must be prevented from arbitrary\n\nassessments. To this end the Committee on Customs Valuations of\n\nArticle 96,with the help of established traders selected in relation\n\nto the relative importance of the commerce of each nation, are\n\nsupposed to determine from year to year, or at six months inter-\n\nvals when necessary, the minimum and maximum customs values\n\nof the principal merchandise. The estimate of the customs author-\n\nities is thus balanced against the value declared by the importer\n\nwithin the minimum and maximum limits fixed by the schedule.\n\nSince fraud in the declaration of value is still theoretically possible\n\nfor the merchandise on the schedule, and obviously possible for\n\nthose not on the schedule, Article 85 provides the penalties\n\napplicable in such a case. The additional method of valuation which\n\nthe French Government supports leads on the contrary to incon-\n\nsistencies and difficulties of interpretation. Article 82 loses its\n\nmeaning. The importer must file a declaration of value, but the\n\nvalue of similar merchandise on the local market on the day of\n\npresentation to customs is readily obtainable as a matter of public\n\nknowledge, and the customs duties paid on these merchandises must\n\nbe ascertained from the customs officials themselves. There is no\n\nneed for the filing of a declaration of value. Nor is there room for\n\nfraud. Article 85 equally loses al1 meaning. The French Reply\n\ndisposes of these inconsistencies by dismissing Articles 82 and 85\n\nas articles of pure form without any real or practical purpose and\n\nby construing Article 96 as a provision which deprives the\n\nimporter of the opportunity to calculate the customs value of his\n\nimport, substitutes fixed and predetermined values, and obviates\n\naccordingly the possibility of either argument or fraud. This,\n\nhomever, is a clear misconstruction of Article 96 since it does not\n\nrequire a determination of a fixed and predetermined value for\n\neach item of merchandise, but rather permits of the establishment\n\nof a schedule of minimum and maximum values. Moreover, the\n\nargument in respect to Article 96, as well as the argument presented\n\nin respect to Articles82 and 85, cannot remove the contradiction\n\nin which the duality of methodç of valuation siipported by the\n\nFrench Government results. Starting from the priuciple that, under\n\nArticle 95, the determination of customs value is made at \"the\n\ntime\" of assessment, the French Government obtains two coustruc-\n\ntions of Articles82. 85and 96 : one in which al1the articles have a REJOIKDER OF THE U.S.A. (18IV 52)\n\n'09\n\nreasonable meaning and show a logical correlation ; the other in\n\nwhich they have no meaning nor purpose.\n\nThe French Govemment attempts to explain the presence of\n\na dual method of valuation thus : in normal circumstances of\n\nfree competition the prices on the market of origin are close\n\nenough to those on the local market to be a matter of indifference\n\nand permit assessments based on the cost value of the import\n\non the market of origin ; but in extraordinary circumstances,\n\nthe competitive advantage enjoyed by the forejgn importer over\n\nthe local interests, i.e. French interests, must be nullified by\n\nadoption of the second method since, other\\vise, the customs\n\nduties would not reflect the actual sale value of the import. This\n\nreasoning, iii the view of the United States Govemment, can\n\nfind no support iii Article 95. The point becomes evident as soon\n\nas the normal rules of interpretation are applied which require\n\na determination of the intent of the parties ut the time the instru-\n\nment was negotiated. At the time of the conclusion of the Act\n\nof Algeciras, there was no contemplation in the mind of the\n\nparties of the extraordinary circumstances to which the Keply\n\nrefers. Only normal circumstances of full and open competition\n\nwere envisaged, as was made clear by the inclusion iii the Prearnble\n\nof the Act of the controlling principle of economic liberty without\n\ninequality. Article 95, therefore, did not contemplate the use of\n\na second method of assessment specially designed for extraordinary\n\ncircumstances and based on the sale ~~alueof the import on the\n\nlocal market.\n\nThe argument that the ad valoremduties of Article 95 coiicemed\n\nexport duties as well as import duties does not prove, as contended\n\nin the Reply, that imports were to be valued accordiiig to their\n\nsale price on the Moroccan market. Export duties in Morocco,\n\nexcept for very feu, exceptions, were specific duties, not ad valorem\n\nduties. To speak of ad valorem duties was equivalent to speaking\n\nof import diities. No difficulties i~rouldanse, in aiiy event, urider\n\nthe single rnethod of valiiation supported by both this Govem-\n\nment and acknowledged as a valid alternative method by the\n\nFrench Government, siiice the value on the market of origin\n\nin the case of exports would be the cost in Morocco.\n\nIn the circumstances, the method of valuation-supported by\n\nthe United States and admitted as valid by the French Goverii-\n\nment-which determines customs value on the basis of value\n\non the market of origin plus expenses incidental to delivery to\n\nthe custom-house but not including customs duties, is the only\n\nproper method of valuation under Article 95 of the Act of Algeciras.\n\nThis interpretation is corroborated by the letter of M.

COLI.ECTION OF TAXES\n\n(lteply, PP. 38-44)\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, the Goveriiment of the Eiiited States\n\nadvanced the claim that consumption taxes created by the Dahir of\n\nFebruary 28, 1948, were in contravention of the fiscal immunity\n\nprovided by the treaties, were illegally collected from America~i\n\nnationals, and shoiild be refunded to them upon presentation of\n\nadequately documentcd claims. This Govcrnment cxpressly dis-\n\nclaimed reliance on any capitulatory right of assent for the purpose\n\nof its argument. (Counter-hIemorial. pp. 354-358. Vol. 1.)\n\nIn answer, the French Reply contends that no treaty ha ever\n\nconferred upoii the United States any right to a tax immunity in 112 REJOINDER OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV j2)\n\nrespect 'of its nationals in Morocco. In support of this contention,\n\nthe French Government asserts first that the very claims made in\n\nthe past by the United States in respect to fiscal immunity were\n\nalways based. not on a specific treaty right to tax exemption, but\n\non a refusal to recognize as applicable to its citizens legislation to\n\nwhich it had not assented. The Reply refers (p. 39) to a note from\n\nthe American Diplornatic Agent at Tangier to the French Resident\n\nGeneral of Morocco in date of December 3, 1928, which isquoted in\n\nthe annexes to the Counter-Memorial on page 720, Vol. 1. The\n\nreference, in the view of the Governrnent of the United States,\n\nestablishes beyond question the contrary. The note clearly and\n\ncarefully proceeds on two separate grounds : first on the ground\n\nof an autonomoiis right to tax exemption ;second on the general\n\nground that local legislation, no matter what its nature, fiscal or\n\nothenvise, does not apply to Arnerican citizens without the prior\n\nassent of the United States :\n\n\"As Your Excellency is aware, the existing treaties, to which the\n\nShereefianEmpire and the United States are parties. categorically\n\ndebar the former from imposing upon the nationals of the United\n\nStates any taxation wliatsoever, except the customs duties and\n\ncertain other taxes which are specified in the said treaties. The\n\nprevious consent of the United States Government is therefore\n\nessential before any fiscal innovationcan be legally cnforced upon\n\nits citizens and proteges. Its furthermore beyond dispute that the\n\nAmerican Government enjoys the fullest liberty to grant or to\n\nwithhold, as it may think fit, its assent to the application to Ame-\n\nrican ressortissants in the Shereefian Empire of any legislation or\n\nfiscal enactments introduced by the Jloroccan Government.\"\n\n(Counter-3fernorial.Annex 49.)\n\nThe French Governinent next advances an analysis of treaties\n\nthe purpose of which is to show that no az~tonomous right to fiscal\n\nexemption ever existed in Morocco. Such imrnunity asthere existed,\n\naccording to the Reply, always derived. not from a specific treaty\n\nright to tax exemption, but from a capitulatory right-the right\n\nto refuse to recognize as applicable to foreigners any local law, fiscal\n\nor otherwise, by virtue of the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction.\n\nThe text of the treaties does not support the contention. -4rticle 4\n\nof the General British Treaty of 1856, on which the Reply first\n\nrelies, provides :\n\n\"They [British citizens] shall be entitled to hire, on lease or\n\notherwise, dwellings and warehouses ....They shall not be obliged\n\nto pay, uiider any pretence whatever, any taxes or impositions.\n\nThey shall be exempt from al1military service, whether by land or\n\nçea; from forced loans, and from every extraordinary contribu-\n\ntion....(Counter-Mernorial,Annex 20.)\n\nThere is nothing there to suggest that tax exemption is a capitula-\n\ntory privilege unless it be assurned that the right to hire, on lease\n\nor otherwise, dwellings and warehouses is equally of a capitulatory IIEJOISDER or; THE U.S.A. (18IV 52) 113\n\ncharacter. The same reasoning applies to the exemption from mili-\n\ntary servicc which, if it were a capitulatory privilege, should hardly\n\nhave been granted again to British subjects by the French Govern-\n\nnient in Articlc 8 of the 1937 Franco-British Convention for thc\n\nabrogation of capitrilations in hlorocco. The contention loses everi\n\nmore merit in the light of the fact that tax exemptions in commer-\n\ncial matters were granted in the British Commercial Treaty con-\n\ncluded on the same date as the Gencral Treaty ;it could hardly bc\n\nmaintained that commercial tax exemptions should bc deemed of a\n\ncapitulatory character. The Memorial of the French Govcrnment,\n\n' moreovcr, nevcr intimated in its review of treaties, or in the argu-\n\nments, that tax exemption in the Moroccan treaties wcre of a capi-\n\ntulatory nature ; nor did it ever indicate that it included under the\n\ndefinition of capitulatory privileges tax exemptions (sce pp. 33, 39,\n\n43, 52 and 53, Vol. 1).\n\nThe repeated assertion that al1 tax exemptions in the Moroccan\n\ntreaties, evcn the commercial ones, were of a capitulatory character\n\nare directed to cstablishing one point : the abrogation of the tax\n\nexemption provided in the British Commercial Treaty of 1856.\n\nHaving assertcd that al1tax exemptions, including those in matters\n\nof commerce, arc of capitulatory character, the Reply proceeds\n\nto demonstrate that al1the tax cxcmptions of British citizens were\n\nterminated as a result of the tcrmination of their rights of extra-\n\nterritorial jurisdiction. The reasoning, hourever, has no validity.\n\nThe renunciation to rights of extraterritorial jurisdiction, including\n\nthe right to refuse to recognize as applicable to British citizens\n\nany local legislation, fiscal or othcrwise, without the previous\n\nconsent of thc British Government rcsulted from the express terms\n\nof Article 1 of the 1937 Convention for the abrogation of capitula-\n\ntions and related articles. The abrogation of the specific right to\n\ntax exemption granted in Article 4 of the General British Treaty\n\nwas specifically accomplished in Article 4 of the Protocol of Signa-\n\nture (Counter-Dlemorial, Annex 93).\n\nThe Franco-British Convention of 1937 abrogated only those\n\narticles of the Gcneral British Treaty of 1856, which are specified\n\nin Article 4 of the Protocol, but had no effect on the Commercial\n\nTreaty concludcd oii the same date. (See Protocol of Signature,\n\nArticle 4, hlinutc, Article 4, and Exchanges of Xotcs, No. 9 ;\n\nCounter-Memorial, Annex 93.) Thc Commercial Treaty contains,\n\nin the terms of the Reply, a fiscal immunity for \"commercial\n\noperations\", meaning that iio tax, in addition to import and\n\nexport duties, may be imposcd on the goods of British subjects\n\n(see Articles 3, 7, 8 and 9). Through the most-favorcd-nation\n\nclause, the Governmcnt of the United States is crititlcd to the\n\nsaine fiscal immuiiity. The Dahir of Fcbroary 28, 1948. imposing\n\nconsumption taxes on merchandisc belonging to United States\n\nnationals, violated this right, indcpcndeiitly of any qriestion of\n\nassent under the regime of extraterritorial jurisdiction claimed in\n\n8114 REJOIXDER OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV 52)\n\nthis proc'eeding by this Government. The Counter-Menional has\n\ndevelo~ed alreadv the ar-uments on this latter oint (see\n\npp. 355-358, vol.. 1).\n\nIn the circumstances, this Government need not prescnt at\n\nthis timc extensive comments on thc other arguments advancecl\n\nin the Rcply, although it does not conccde their validity. The\n\nReply draws the inference from the terms of the Convention of\n\nMadrid that oiily certain protected persoiis eiijoyed fiscal exemption\n\nproperly speaking under the previous treaties, but not foreigners\n\nand protected persons as a whole (Reply, p. 41). This assertion\n\nflagrantly contradicts the statement of the Memonal conceriiing\n\nthe same Convention :\n\n\"1:oreignersand protectedpersons who had hitherto enjoyed the\n\nfiscalexemption are henceforth subject ta two taxes : the agricul-\n\ntural tax and the gate tax (Art12and 13).\" (Translation ;hlemorial.\n\nP. 43, Vol. 1.1\n\nArticlcs 12 and 13 of the Convention, as the Memorial properly\n\npoints out, substitute partial fiscal immunity for the geueral\n\nfiscal immunity previously in effcct ; those articles thereby con-\n\nsccrated a fiscal regime with respect to taxes which is still in force,\n\nsubject to the modifications introcluced under, or pursuant to,\n\nthe Act of Algeciras, and \\\\,hich cannot be abrogated \\vithout\n\nthe consent of the parties to the Convention. This was the position\n\nof French diplomatic and consular officers prior to the establish-\n\nment of the Protectorate. Thus the French Consul at Fez reported\n\non May 28, 1909, to the French Chargé in Tangier:\n\n\"'l'lie Sultan has ordered l'Amin Elmostafac to collect from\n\nEuropean nationals and proteges the duties and taxes from which\n\nthey were so far exempt.\n\nconimerce, foreignnationals and proteges cannot be subject but to\n\nestablished taxes: agricultural taxes, taxes on cattle, and customs\n\nduties.

(Translation ;italics added.)\n\nSo far as concerns the argument that the Act of Algeciras was\n\nahrogated, in respect of fiscal matters, by the establishment and\n\nrecognition of the Frcnch Protectorate, the Governmcnt of the\n\nUnited States refers to the statements and arguments in point\n\nin the Countcr-Memorial, pages 293-300, 391-396, Vol 1. With\n\nrespect to the propriety of an argument which alleges the\n\nnecessity of disregarding restraining treaty limitations for the\n\novert motive of modernization, reference is made to the argu-\n\nments presented in Chapter 1, A, of this Rejoinder.\n\nIt is suhmitted that the French Reply fails in its contention\n\nthat the right of exemption from taxes is not an autonornous\n\nright based upon distinct treaty provisions.\n\nSo far as coucerns the statemerit in the Reply that the French\n\nGovemment \"has never recognized\" the \"existence\" of the right\n\nof assent in fiscal matters, or otherwise, tbis Govcrnment notes\n\nthat the French Resident-General has requested the assent of\n\nthis Government to \"tax legislation\" no less than some 36 tiines\n\nin the period 1920-1937, and some 23 times from 1938-1948 In\n\naddition there is reproduced here the self-explanatory note\n\naddressed by RI.

Rlarchat recogiiized, an1gq8 ,he capitulatory immunity\n\nof American citizens from the application of any local legislation,\n\nor else he recognized the specific right of American' citizens to\n\ntax exemption under tlie treaties. This Government does not\n\ndeem it necessary to determine which of the two the letter\n\nrecognized, since either supports its contention that the taxes\n\nat issue were improperly collected from American citizens.\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nEXTRATERRITORIAL JURISIIICTIOX\n\n111its Counter->fernorial. the Governmeiit of the United States\n\ndirected its arguments to cstablishing t\\vo points : the scope of\n\nthe rights of extraterritorial jurisdiction mhich it rcceived from\n\nhlorocco ;the continuing validity of these rights after the establish-\n\nment of the Protectorate and up to the present date.\n\nIn order to establish the scope of the rights of jurisdiction\n\nreceived from Morocco. the Counter:Memorial relied on the prin-\n\nciple of personality of law whenever a problem of interpretation\n\nso required; thus the scope of the specific rights of jurisdiction\n\ngranted in the United States Treaty of 1836 was analyzed by\n\nreference to this principle. The meaning and effect of the most-\n\nfavored-nation clause in the hloroccan treaties was also deterinincd,\n\nto the extent possible, by reference to the special circumstances\n\nwhich prevailed at the time of its inclusion in treaties of capitu-\n\nlation.\n\nIn order to establish the continuing validity of thc rights after\n\nthe establishment of the Protectorate, the Countcr-Memorial\n\nrelicd, among other things, on custom and usage and on the\n\nfact that the United States could still claim throiigh the most-\n\nfavored~nation clause the jurisdictional rights granted to Spain\n\nin 1861. The practice of the French autbonties silice the surrender\n\nof British jurisdiction in1937 and the history of tlie negotiations\n\nfor the United States recognition of the French Protectorate\n\nwere also taken into consideration.\n\nWith respect to the argiiinents concerning the scopc of the\n\nrights received by the United States, the Reply ignores the fact\n\nthat the Counter-Rfemorial relies on the principlc of pcrsonality I<EJOISI>EK 01:THE U.S.A.(16 IV j2)\n\n117\n\nof la\\\\, solely as a principle of interpretation. The United States\n\nGovernment, the Reply alleges, argues for thc adoption of this\n\nprinciple in modcrn international law as a principle of gcneral\n\nand absolute application always prevailing i~i Mohammedan\n\ncountries, in place ofthc principle of territorial sovereigiity normally\n\napplicable. Similarly; according to the Reply, the historical inter-\n\npretation of the most-favored-nation clause advanced in thc\n\nCounter-Memorial purports to establish with respect to Morocco\n\nand other RIohammedan States a special rule resulting in an\n\ninequality of treatment not permissiblc uiider modern inter-\n\nnational la\\\\,.\n\nWith respect to argiiinents concerning the contiiiuiiig validity\n\nof United States rights after the establishment of the Protectorate,\n\nthe Reply alleges that the territorial sovercignty of the State\n\nof Morocco is iiicoml~atihle with the maintenance of such rights.\n\nAl1other foreign States, according to the Reply, have surrendered\n\nto Morocco the spccial rights of jurisdiction which thcy commonly\n\ncxcrcised in previous times ;the United States, thcrefore, cannot\n\nmaintain against Morocco these special rights. To hold otherwise\n\n\\vould be to advocatc the coiitinuance of a priiiciple of inequality\n\nbetween hforocco and other nations, and to csclude hforocco from\n\nthe henefit of the principles of equality and justice which are\n\nthe foundation of modem international law.\n\nThe Govcrnment of the United States proposes to answer the\n\nFrench argiimcnts within the general fraiiic~rork of the plan\n\npreviously followed in the Counter-Memorial ; this wiil include\n\nconsideratioii of arguments relating to the riglit of assent, siiicc\n\nthis right has been treated in the Counter-Memorial as a necessary\n\ncorollary of extraterritorial jurisdiction. This cxamination of\n\nspecific arguments will be followed by gencral conclusions and\n\nobservations oii the issue of extraterritorial jurisdictioti.\n\nA.

Xo agreement, nor any general principle of international\n\nlaw, the Reply objects, sustains today siich a doctrine. The\n\nobjection is entirely predicated upon a part of a sentence of the\n\nCounter4femorial whicli the French Reply translates and quotes\n\nas follows':\n\n\"....aujourd'liui [now] dans le moiide (le l'Islam, l'étranger\n\ndevrait [shoiild]Etre tenu en dehors de la vie clcla société locete\n\nde la protection juridictionnelle offerte par celle-ci et mener son\n\nexistence selon sa propre loi\". (Italicsddecl ;Reply, p. 45.) KEJOISDER OF THE U.S.A. (18 IV j2)\n\n118\n\nThis quotation has been taken out of context. The teuse of the\n\ncontrolling verb, moreover, has been changedl. The original\n\npassage of the Counter-Memorial is reproduced below :\n\n\"Szich was the historical developmentof the practice of extraterri-\n\ntoriality at thebeginning of the 16th century when theiropean States\n\nbegantoenterintoregtclartreatyrelationswith theMohammedanStates.\n\nThe practice was embodied in those treaties. Treaties concluded\n\nwith the Ottoman Empire, first by France (1528-1535)and there-\n\nafter by practically al1 European Powers-Great Britain, the\n\nNetherlands, Austria-Hungary, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Russia,\n\nSpain, Belgium, Portugal, etc.-and with Algiers, Alorocco,Tripoli.\n\nTunis, Persia, hfuscat and Zanzibar, Egypt, Ethiopia, etc., provided\n\nfor extraterritorial jurisdiction ranging from exclusive jurisdiction\n\nof the foreign consuls in cases, civil and criminal, iiivolving their\n\nnationals only, to jurisdiction in mixed cases, civil and criminal, in\n\nwhichtheirnationalsweredefendants. TheMohammedancommrrnities\n\nmerely continued the precedentsand practices which once in Europe\n\nand now in the Islamic world commanded thatthe Joreignerbe kept\n\noutside the life aitd jurisdictioi~alprotection of the local society and\n\nlive instead accordingto his own law. Differencesbetween the Chris-\n\ntian and hfohammedan civilizations, religious and othenvise,\n\nundoubtedly fostered the maintenance of relations according to\n\nthe principle of extraterritoriality.$'hile legal ivriters have given\n\nvarious explanations forthe continuance of the system in hfohamme-\n\ndan countries at a time when in Europe the principle of personality\n\nof law had given way to the principle of territorial sovereignty,\n\nthey agreeon the conclusionthat theorigin of the system of extraterri-\n\ntorialitytt Mohammedan countriesis to befound in the immentorial\n\npractice and respect of the principle of personality of law.\" (Italics\n\nadded.)\n\nThe Government of the United States is aware of the difficulties\n\nattaching to problems of translation. These difficulties, it must he\n\npresumcd, have led the French Government to interpret the state-\n\nment at issue in a sense quite different from that obviously assigned\n\nto it by the Counter-Alemorial. All possible error is removed,\n\nhowever, when the complete sentence is replaced in the context\n\nfrom which it is takeu, the verbs are left in their original tense,\n\nand the conclusion to which the paragraph leads is taken into\n\nconsideration. The Counter-Memorial clearly did not review the\n\ndevelopment of the principle of personality of law for the purpose\n\nof explaining the growth of capitulatory rights today, in 1952, but\n\nohviously invoked it as a principle of iriterpretation explaining the\n\ngrowth of capitulations in Mohammedan States \"at the heginning\n\nof the 16th century when the European States began to enter into\n\nregular treaty relations with the Mohammedan States\". The French\n\nobjection is without. validity.\n\n' The Government of the United States noted that the French translofthe\n\nCounteralernorial prepared by the Court rnaintainedverbin its proper tense. I<EJOiSDER OF THE U.S.A. (18IV 52)\n\nII9\n\nThe Reply, moreover, decliiies to interprct the meaning of the\n\nUnited States Treatics of 1787 and 1836 by reference to the intent\n\nof the parties nt the Limeoftheir drnfting. The sole issue in this part\n\nof the argument, it shoiild be noted, is whether or not the text of\n\nArticle zo of the Unitcd States Treaty of 1787, renewed in 1836,\n\nwas intended to graiit to thc American Consul jurisdiction in civil\n\nand criminal cases arising between his nationals, or only in civil\n\ncases. The Counter-Memorial accordingly presented arguments\n\ndirected to cstablishiiig the meaning of this provision by reference\n\nto appropriate treaties and the pnnciple of personality of law which\n\nthen controlled the developnient of extraterritorial jurisdiction in\n\nRlorocco.The Reply has advanced no answer to these arguments,\n\nexcept the assertion that the Counter~hlemonal did not rcproduce\n\naccurately the distinction advanced in the Memorial between\n\nConst6lnr Jz~risdiction and Cafiitz6latoryJzarisrliction and did not,\n\ntherefore, properly dispose of the issue. The Government of tlie\n\nUnited States denics this assertion and rests on the record of thc\n\narguments prescntcd in the Memorial on pages 53, 54, and 55,\n\nVol. 1, in thb Countcr-hlemorial on pagcs 363-369, Vol. 1, and in\n\nthe Reply on pages 46 and 47, Vol. 1.\n\nB. THEA~OST-F~\\\\~OKEII-XAT COASUSEAIIGU~IEST\n\n(Reply, pp. 47-57)\n\n(1)The Reply declines to interpret the most-favored-nation\n\nclause in the light of the circumstances which shaped its develop-\n\nment in treaties of capitulation. To propose an historical inter-\n\npretation of the clause in the Moroccan treaties is not, as contended\n\nin the Reply, to advocate the existence of a rule of inequality\n\nhetween Mohammedan States and other nations. The use of the\n\nhistorical approach is merely an application of thc normal rules\n\nof interpretation of international instruments.The attitude of the\n\nFrench Government in the matter is the more difficult to under-\n\nstand since the proposed method of interpretation would appear\n\nto be especially appropriate when dealing with a snbject as\n\nspecialized as extraterritorialjurisdiction. It is perfectly proper\n\nin the view of the Govemment of the Unitcd States to take notice\n\nof some historical considerations for the purpose of determining\n\nwhether the clause alwayshad in the Moroccan treaties the meaning\n\nwhich thc Reply would ascrihe to it today.\n\nIt was noted already in the Counter-Memorial, and the Reply\n\ndoes not deny it, that the most-favoured-nation clausc theory upon\n\nwhich the French Government relies is a modcrn theory, repre-\n\nsenting a crystallization of the practice of the end of the 19th\n\ncentury and the heginniiig of the 20th. Thc hloroccan treaties in\n\nwhich the inost-favored-nation clause is included are from an\n\nolder period. The practice which developed the modern theory\n\nwas essentially a European-Amencan practice, not a practice120 iIEJolsnlrl~01:THE U.S.:\\. (18 IV j2)\n\niiivolving &Iohammedan States. The rights upon rvhich the clause\n\ntvas to take effect were of an cntirely different character. Iii oiie\n\npractice the meaiiiiig of the clause \\vas developed priiicipally in\n\nconnectioii with commercial rights. In the other the clause often\n\nhad as a major purj~oscthe securing of capitulatory rights. In the\n\ncircumstaiices, it is a reasonablc contention that the most-favored-\n\nnation clausc of thc hforoccan treatics cannot be assumetl a 9riuri\n\nto have had at thc time of its incliision in such treaties the mcaiiing\n\nand effect upori which the modern practice is now in agrecmcnt. It\n\nis characteristic, morcover, of the problem of interpretatioii of the\n\nmeaning and effect of the clause in this particular case that the\n\ncontentions of the parties iiullify one another. The Goveriiment of\n\nthe United States objects that the general modern riile, in the\n\nabsence of contrary proof, caiinot be presumed to apply. The Freiich\n\nGovernment coiiversely objects that, in the absence of coritrary\n\nproof, the regionalizatioii of the effect of the clausc caiiiiot bc\n\npresumed to apply (p. 48).\n\nIt becomes imperativc, therefore, to give coiisideration to factors\n\nwhich may properly be determinative of the interpretation of the\n\nclause in the hloroccaii treaties. It is difficult to believe that the\n\nclause was utilized from the beginriing of aloroccan treaty proctice\n\nwith the inteiit of obtaining the same clear-cut and tlcfiiiitc effects\n\nwhich mark its opcratioii today in modern practice. And the more\n\nso since the precise effect of the clause was still a matter of debate\n\nand controvcrsy iiiEiiropean-American practice before the eiid\n\nof the 19th century. The precise intent or effect of the clausc in the\n\n?vIoroccantreaties is thus largely a matter of conjecture, iiridcr any\n\ntheory, and more particiilarly under a modern theory responding to\n\ndifferent needs and preoccupations. The clause must havc had,\n\nhowever, at least the effect which evcn authorities supportirig the\n\nmodern theory recogiiize as Iiaving been characteristic of its early\n\ndevelopment. Farra, Hornbeck and Ito (see Counter-&lemorial,\n\npp. 373-374, Vol. 1) have pointed out that originally it \\iras110 more\n\nthan a device to avoid the specific enumeration of advalitages graii-\n\nted in other treaties. tlt what point, if any,theclause wasiisedin the\n\nbforoccan treaties with the understanding that the original purpose\n\nof permanent incorporation by reference was to be terminated is\n\nobviously agaiii a matter of coiijecture. But if France fclt it could\n\nmaintain against Brazil froni 1857 to 1878, through the inost-\n\nfavored-nation clause, n clairn to the permanent benefit of rights\n\nnot any longer enjoyed by third States, it is not by aiiy nleaiis\n\nunreasonable to suppose tliat France and other foreign Powers inay\n\nhave conducted their treaty negotiatioiis in Morocco during the\n\nsame period or before with the coiitemplation of ascribing to the\n\nclause a similar effect. If anythin~, it mould have bceii e:isier to\n\nobtain in AIoroccosuch an efféctof Checlause, and the interest \\!,hich\n\nFrance aiid other Eiiropean Powers had or were iiicreasirigly iiitciit 1IEJOISI)ICK OF THE G.S.A. (16 1\\' j2) 121\n\niipon securiiig in that State makes it even more likely that they\n\nshould have wanted to obtain permanent rights in that couiitry.\n\nIn the light of these observations, the Government of the United\n\nStates helieves that therc is no reason for holding that the most-\n\nfavored-nation clause in the Moroccan treaties inteiidcd tocreate\n\nonly temporary aiid dependent rights of extraterritorial juris-\n\ndiction. The view applies as well to the most-favored-nation clause\n\nof the Madrid Convention aiid perhaps with even more logic, since\n\nit is difficult to see why this convention should establish on a per-\n\nmanent basis rights of protection originating from custom and\n\nusage, and at the same time recognize on a non-permanent basis\n\nthe jurisdiction needed by the parties for the exercise of their right\n\nover proteges.\n\nThe Government of the United States considers that the Conven-\n\ntion of 3Iadrid accomplished a collectivizatioii of jurisdictional\n\nrirhts in favor of al1 the i~arties and that it \\vas not intended to\n\nslbject these rights to the'rnechanical effect of acquisition and loss\n\nwhich characterizes the effect of the modern most-favorecl-nation\n\nclause. Instead, the prerogatives so acquired became an indivisible\n\nwhole, confirmed moreover by the Act of Algeciras, on which later\n\nrenunciations by some of the parties rcmain wholly withoiit cffect.\n\nTo the arguments made in bath the Memorial and the lieply that\n\nthe hladrid Convention could not be deemed to have been concerned\n\n\\rith extraterritorial jurisdiction, it may be pointed out that the\n\nFrench Government at one time took quite a different oiew of the\n\nmatter. The President of the French Cabinet, Rlinistcr of Foreign\n\nAffairs, addressed on t\\iigiist 21, 1905. a despatch to Freiich\n\nDiplomatic Representatives in Loiidon, Petrograd, Berlin, liome,\n\n\\lienna, Washington, Brussels, The Hague, Copeiihagen, Stock-\n\nholm and Lisbon instructiiig them as follows :\n\n\"Our Jlinister at Tangier informsme that the ShereefianGoverii-\n\nment has imprisoned one of our Algerian subjects ..:. ancl made\n\nknown ils intention to remove him from our jurisdiction.\n\nThis fact is a violatiori of treaties....\n\nAl1 the Powers signatories with Moroccoto the Madrid Conven-\n\ntion of July 3, 1680,or Iiavingadhered toit, have an interest in tlie\n\nrecognized by this international instrument, Rloroccaii proteges rule\n\nare removed from Moroccanjurisdiction ; a fortiori the loreigners,\n\nsubjects of the Powers, niust benefit of thesame advantage.\n\n1 would appreciate your indicating to the Government to whicli\n\nyou are accredited tlie point of view of the Governmeiit of tlie\n\n[French] Kepublic....\" Docirmeiztsdiplomatiques, .4faires du Maroc,\n\n1901-~goj. 275.

Vol. 1),thelaw-creatiiigpro-\n\ncess which culminated in the acquisitioii by thenationals of foreign\n\nPowers of a special regime in al1countries of extraterritorial juris-\n\ndiction $'as not an automatic and rigid procedure, but rather an\n\nheterogeiieous process combining sucli varied elements as custom,\n\nspecific trcaty ,provisions. and most-favored-nation treatment. The\n\nresulting regime, therefore, cannot bc deemed to owe its existence\n\nto the slxcific and mechanical effect of the clause which the French\n\nGovernment, proceeding from a modern and European-rlmerican\n\nconcept of the clause, assigns to it for the purpose of its argument;\n\nThe arguments advanced in the Counter-hlemorial on this point,\n\nfar from contradicting the arguments presented in relatioii to the\n\nspecific provisions of the treaties, arc their logical continuation.The\n\ntrcaties are a means of ascertaining the regime of extraterritorial\n\njurisdictioii to which, at the end of the development of the institu-\n\ntion of extraterritorial jurisdictioiiiiMorocco, the nationals of al1\n\nforeign Powers had become entitled. The negotiation by France of\n\na series of agreements for the surrcnder of rights of extraterritorial\n\njurisdiction with States whicli never had had treaty relations of\n\nany kind with Morocco confirms precisely the validity of the coii-\n\ntentioii of this Government (see Counter-Memorial, p. 385. Vol. 1.)\n\nThe Reply, hourever, suggests that these renunciations did iiot\n\nhave for their primary purpose the surrender of special privileges,\n\nbut were intended primarily to be forma1 declarations of acceptailce\n\nof the jurisdictional system recently established by France iii\n\nMorocco. The effect of these declarations, and the legal consequen-\n\nces which the French Government draws from them will now be\n\nconsidered in connection with the related question of the effect of\n\nthe renunciation by Spain of its rights of extraterritorial jurisdic-\n\ntioii in the French Zone of Morocco, under its Treaty of 1861.\n\n(3) According to the Reply, the position of the United States\n\nGovernment in asserting that the Spanish-hloroccan Treaty of\n\n1861 has never been abrogated is groundless. Thus the Reply\n\nconcludes that the Government of the United States caniiot\n\nrely upon its provisions to justify the continuing existence of\n\nits rights of extraterritorial jurisdiction in Rlorocco.\n\nBy way of preliminary remark, note should be taken of the\n\nruling of the Court of Appeals of Rabat in date of July 12, 1921,\n\npreviously quoted on page 381, Vol. 1, of the Counter-Rlemorial :\n\n!'\\Vhereasthis principle is more spccificallystated by Article 5\n\nof the Treaty concluded Uecember zo, 1861, between Morocco\n\nand Spain, treaty the benefit of which most foreign Powers can\n\nclaim by application of the most-favored-nation clause, clause\n\ngranted notably for France by the 1)iplomaticAct of May28, 1825,\n\ntheïreaty ofSept. 10, 1844,and the Conventionof Madridof July 3,\n\n1880(Art. 17) ....Rec. arr.

KEJOISUEK OF THE U.S.A(18 1%j2) 123\n\nEither the Court considcred that the most-favorcd-nation clause\n\nof the Convention of Madrid did incorporate permanently the\n\nprovisions of the Spanish Treaty of 1861, or else the Court in\n\n1924-10 years after the conclusion of the FrancolSpanish agree-\n\nments alleged to have abrogated the Spanish Treaty of 1861-\n\nwas taking the position that the Spanish Treaty of 1861 was\n\nstill in effect. The alternative arguments presented hy this Govern-\n\nment are consequently far from being as unfounded as the lieply\n\nwould assunie.\n\nThe Reply asserts that al1 questions concerning the validity\n\nof the Spanish Treaty of 1861 have been settlcd by the obser-\n\nvations presented by the French Government in the course of\n\nthe Preliminary Objection which took place earlier in this pro-\n\nceeding. The Government of the United States caiinot agree with\n\nthis sweeping generalization and confusion of issues. In its Preli-\n\nniinary Objection, the United States Government merely sought\n\nto secure clarification as to whether or not the States of France\n\nand Moroccowere Parties to the case. Theprecaution waswarranted,\n\nsince in the observation of this Government, the French Govcrn-\n\nment had been careful in the past to, specify in its international\n\nacts whether or not it was acting in a particular case for and\n\non behalf of Morocco. Examples were cited by this Government\n\nfor the single purpose of cstahlishing proof of this practice as\n\nwcll as the manner in which the distinction had been made clear\n\niii the past. The .comnients of the French Government on the\n\nsubstance of these examples were superfluous and unnecessary.\n\nAn unambiguous statement, consistent with the past practice in\n\npoint, would have met the objection and immediately clarified\n\nthe capacity in which France was acting, since thc Preliminary\n\nObjection did not at any timc question the general competence\n\nof the French Govcrnment to act for Rlorocco iii its capacity\n\nof protecting State, but sought to ascertain whet~Ithe spccific\n\ninstance, the French Government was erercising its competence\n\nto act -for Morocco. This simple statement was supplicd hy the\n\nFrench Agent, by lcttcr dated October 6, 1951.\n\nThe Reply argues that in both the French-Spanish Treaty of\n\nNovember 27,1912, and the Franco-Spanish Declaration of\n\nRfarch 7, 1914,the negotiations between France and Spain were\n\nthe implementation of the competence which Rlorocco recognized\n\nFrance to possess under the Treaty of March 31912 .he United\n\nStates Government does not, and has never denied, tkit the\n\nTreaty of March 30, 1912, so far as concerned States which\n\nrecognized the Protectorate, was effective totahlish France as\n\nthe protecting State of Rlorocco, nor does it deny that as an\n\noutgrowth of this position, France became competent to deal\n\nwith other States regarding its newly-acquired powcrs within\n\nthe whole of Rforocco. This acquisition of competencc, however,\n\ndoes not determine in advauce whether or not the competence KEJOISDEH 01: THI:u.s.:\\(1s IV jz)\n\n124\n\nis in fact exercised in a particular case. This must bc dctermined\n\nin cach particular instance and it is plain that France, in negotiating\n\n\\\\rith Spain regardiug Spanish iiiterests in hlorocco, negotiated\n\nfor itselfalone and that the agreements with Spain did iiot have\n\nthe effect of briiiging about ail agreemeiit with the State of\n\nRlorocco as \\\\.ell. It would not be in accord with the facts to\n\nmaintain that by virtue of the terms of Article 1 of the Treaty\n\nof March 30, 1912, France acted for llorocco in negotiating with\n\nSpain in 191~. Article 1 mcrcly scts forth that France would\n\ncoiisult with Spain regarding Spanisli intcrests. And the note\n\natldressed by the French Ambassador to the United States\n\nSecrrtary of State on January 19, 1917, makcs it clear beyond\n\nrr doubt that this Article rcferrcd to negotiations hetween the\n\nGovernments, \"not of Morocco, but of Francc and Spain\". (Coiinter-\n\nRlemorial, Annex 45.) Sincc the Government of Morocco \\\\,as to\n\nbc specifically excepted, ho\\v can it be argued now that the State\n\nof Norocco was included in the ncgotiations ? The French Govcrn-\n\nment fails to distinguish between possession of competence and\n\ncxercisc of competence. In the negotiations with Spain its com-\n\npetence to act for >Iorocco \\voi~ldhave been clear. But the French\n\nGovernment chose not to excrcise its competence and acted in\n\nthe negotiations for the French Government alone.\n\nThe French Reply notes an \"error in judgment\" (p.53) on the\n\npart of the United States Governmcnt which it attributes to \"a\n\nmisunderstanding as to the effects of the Protectorate Treaty\".\n\nIf so, the ahundant litcrature on protectorates for which French\n\nwriters are in large measure respoiisible is in surprising contrast\n\nwith the views which the French Government holds today with\n\nrespect to the status of the State of Morocco in international law.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the establishment of a protectorate rela-\n\ntionship does not entail the disappearance of the protected State\n\nas an international entity. There is no annexation and the terri-\n\ntories of the two States remain distinct. The Treaty of March 30,\n\n1912, did nothing more than to set forth restrictions on the exercise\n\nby Norocco of some of its powers because the State of Morocco\n\nso agreed. The State of hlorocco retained al1 that it did not relin-\n\nquish. It cannot be understood, therefore, how the French Govern-\n\nment could claim that, when the States of France and Spain reached\n\nagreement, Norocco was aii uniiamed but participating party.\n\nMorocco is not a part of France ; the Moroccan Government is\n\ndistinct from that of France; thus, whcn France negotiated, it\n\nnegotiated for it~elf alone. To bind hlorocco there should he at\n\nleast some express indication that Morocco was intended to bc\n\nbound. This proposition, persuasive because of its consisteiicy iii\n\nterms of logic andfact, finds addcd support in numerous statemcnts\n\nmade by writers fully familiar with thc status of protectprates.\n\nScelle notes the following : KEJOISDER OF THE U.S.r\\.

(l'r;inslatiori.)\n\nIt must bc readily apparent, therefore, that what is at issue bere\n\nis not a matter which involves merely questions of form, as the\n\nI<cply contérids.

The Covernment of the United\n\nStates, therefore, believes it necessary to maintain due regard for\n\ntlic lcgal position of Morocco, especially as concerns what the\n\nItcply describes as a pure matter of forrn.
