It’s a beautifully diverse city, but if you look closer, it’s apparent that the emotional needs are great. We, a Spanish couple with 2 elementary-aged children are excited to partner with God in what He is doing in this city and we are looking to grow our team! We’re looking for individuals, couples or families who are good at connecting with other people. We are looking for people who are willing to engage others and share God’s love with others in sometimes hostile environments. Are you willing and able to love people where they are at? Are you patient as you engage with people and their processes? Are you passionate about helping others make their lives better?"
