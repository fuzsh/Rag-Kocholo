        "text": "Global shipping and logistics provider GAC Group has opened an office in Algeciras, Spain. The move, which comes just three years after the opening of GAC Gibraltar, represents the latest step in the company’s European growth strategy, as the company continues to expand its presence in the region to better meet customers’ needs.\n\nLocated in the province of Cádiz, Algeciras is the country's largest port, with more than 10 km of quays catering to all types of freight and passenger traffic.\n\nThe Algeciras office will offer a range of integrated ship agency, husbandry and ship spares logistics services for up to 60,000 vessels that pass through the Straits of Gibraltar between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea every year. It will also strengthen GAC’s global coverage and add another service base to those the Group already has at key transit ports such as Singapore, Suez, Panama and Bosphorus.\n\nAs part of the cooperation between the two offices, GAC Gibraltar will provide vessel repair services and bunker fuels to ships docking at Algeciras."
