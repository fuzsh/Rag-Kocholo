I loved my course at La Janda\"\n\n\"Really nice, friendly atmosphere in a beautiful Spanish village\"\n\nLocation Colegio Español La Janda overlooks the historic part of Vejer and is conveniently located between the historic old town and the new. It is undeniably one of the most stunningly beautiful of the famous \"pueblos blancos\" of Andalusia; and only 10 k¨m away from the awe-inspiring beaches of Costa de La Luz. It has only recently been discovered as a travel destination, which means that it is a town in its own right and the locals tend not to speak English- perfect for a complete immersion experience.
