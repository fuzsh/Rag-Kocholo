        "text": "About Cernaval Group\n\nCernaval Group is one of the main Spanish and European shipyards specialising in repairing and maintenance of mid and large scale ships with more than 30 years of experience.\n\nThe group operates through two concessions, located in the ports of Algeciras (World Top 20 and European Top 5 by traffic volume) and Málaga.\n\nTransaction overview\n\nIn 2018, Cernaval was granted a new concession for 30 years by the Algeciras Port Authority located next to its current concession.\n\nThe new concession would allow the group to install a floating dock while leaving space to carry out afloat repairing to additional ships at 4 berths (1km of quays) (current concession structure 1 dry dock + 1 berth). This would allow them to increase the carrying capacity and provide services to larger boats, conducting dry reparations, afloat or a combination of both.\n\nThis would be a transformational project for Cernaval, positioning the Company as the reference repairing and maintenance centre in the Asia-Europe route that goes through the Strait of Gibraltar.\n\nThe plan was to raise the required financing in just a three month period for a total amount of €31m to, jointly with the current shareholders equity contribution, conduct:\n\nthe acquisition, transportation and installation of the floating dock and;\n\nthe beginning of operations of the new concession\n\nMirabaud contacted more than 20 potential reference investors (both national and international) including banks, as well as direct lending investors.\n\nThe transaction was structured as a long term Project Finance + Corporate Debt as it is a concessional asset affected by demand risk, complying with three targets:\n\nObtention of the required financing to accomplish the committed investment\n\nMatching the funds disposals to the investment needs (structuring three tranches) and the repayments to a conservative cash generation scenario, including a target balance mechanism in case of cash generation surplus after debt repayment\n\nAchievement of optimal cost conditions\n\nMirabaud contribution and added value\n\nDesign of the transaction structure (hybrid between Project Finance and Corporate Debt) allowing Cernaval to raise financing over 5.0x 2018 EBITDA at a very competitive cost.\n\nComprehensive advisory during all the process being able to design and execute the financing on a successful manner in just three months period.\n\nContact and negotiation with each of the identified potential investors, creating a competitive process that maximized the financing conditions (in both terms of costs and guarantees).\n\nAssistance in the selection of the most adequate proposal that fitted best with the future cash generation and the investment calendar and requirements.\n\nAdvisory and coordination of the closing between Cernaval and the selected financing entity, including the advisors due diligence and the financing and guarantees contracts."
