        "text": "There are currently 19,757 artists with their own dedicated web page on Pitchfork. But in the 25 years since the site first went live in 1996, some of those artists have taken on a special significance to the way this publication considers and consumes music. There are artists whose creative work has proven to be especially influential, expanding genres or creating entirely new ones. There are others whose outsized impact has shaped the music industry and popular culture at large. There are the indie pioneers and those who have regularly been awarded Best New Music, with records that have defined the underground and particular eras of our staff’s lives. There are some artists, of course, who have done all of these things.\n\nTo kick off our 25th anniversary retrospective, we’ve collected some of the best writing Pitchfork has published on a set of 200 of the most important artists to the publication’s history. The list is the result of much debate among the staff and select contributors over the last few months, and it includes artists who released all—or at least the bulk of—their defining work within the last 25 years. (So while a band like Pavement is certainly important, since most of their classic records came out before 1996, they are not featured.) At the top of the list, you’ll find “The Icons,” the 50 artists whose influence has changed music forever, in alphabetical order, followed by “The Essentials,” 150 nearly-as-important acts, also listed alphabetically.\n\nHere are the 200 most important artists in Pitchfork’s history:\n\nFor more of Pitchfork’s 25th anniversary coverage, head here.

Her legacy will only extend further now that Blackground Records has belatedly (and controversially) reintroduced her catalog for the streaming era. As Rawiya Kameir described in a 2019 Sunday Review:\n\nThe glossy girl- and boy-band era was at its peak at the turn of the century, and before pop acts would attempt to replace that sheen with cool, calling on “urban” producers like Timbaland and The Neptunes, Aaliyah modeled the perfect balance of pop, R&B, and hip-hop. Months before Britney Spears made headlines for performing with a snake at the MTV VMA awards in 2001, Aaliyah had done it in the video for “We Need a Resolution.” Her personal style, creative direction, and choreography were legendarily inventive. She made comfort look luxe as the original little shirt, big pants girl, and tore through dark-and-mysterious years before Keanu Reeves made leather trench coats trendy (in the early years, her omnipresent sunglasses and then side-swooped hair prompted widespread rumors of a lazy eye). By the time of Aaliyah, she’d reinvented herself yet again, this time brighter and more streamlined.\n\nNotable reviews: Aaliyah (2001)\n\nAphex Twin\n\nAs Aphex Twin, Richard D. James sat out roughly half of the last 25 years—a couple of obscure side-project releases and the Analord project comprises all the new material he issued between 2001 and 2014—but he’s still arguably the most important electronic producer to release music during that span. His astonishing gift for melody and kinetic sense of groove and swing keeps his music perennially fresh, whether he’s experimenting on a single synth, directing machines to play instruments, or crafting the warm, funky, and mysterious tracks with which he made his name. As Mark Richardson wrote of James’ comeback Aphex Twin album, Syro, in 2014:\n\nHere is 65 minutes of highly melodic, superbly arranged, precisely mixed, texturally varied electronic music that sounds like it could have come from no other artist. James throughout the ’90s was an influence sponge; part of his genius was how he took ideas and ran them through his highly idiosyncratic filter. The bizarro highlights came when he put his own spin on genres, making jungle weirder, pop more unsettling, and piano music more gorgeous. Syro also absorbs many different sounds, from loping breakbeat to drum’n’bass to techno proper to hints of disco, but in a more subtle way. It has a way of making other genres seem like they exist to serve this particular vision. And it’s a confident album precisely because it’s not self-consciously pushing the envelope. Electronic music with a strong beat not intended for the dancefloor was, if not invented by this guy, certainly perfected by him. So with his first trip back from the wilderness, he’s demonstrating exactly how it’s done.\n\nFurther reading: “Cover Story: Strange Visitor” (2014)\n\nBad Bunny\n\nBenito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, a native of the working-class Almirante Sur neighborhood of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico, was a 22-year-old college student pulling shifts at the local supermarket when his first hit, “Diles,” blew up on SoundCloud in 2016. He soon became one of the most visible and versatile figures in Latin pop, fusing reggaetón, bachata, dembow, trap, alt-rock, and more in giddily shape-shifting fashion. He has also proven to be something of a pop progressive, too, whether pushing against received notions of masculinity in his eye-catching dresses, or speaking out against misogyny, homophobia, and gender violence in his songs, videos, and performances. As Matthew Ismael Ruiz wrote in his review of 2020’s El Último Tour del Mundo:\n\nBad Bunny toes the line between rap braggadocio and vulnerable everyman with relative ease—even while crooning about alien sex. Standing on top of the world, with access to abundant fame, wealth, and critical success, he appears free of any pressure to conform, even to previous versions of himself. He’s a beacon of light in barrios around the world, an example for kids with secret skirts or Smashing Pumpkins CDs of what being yourself can look and sound like. When he says he does whatever he wants, we believe him. Maybe we can, too.\n\nIncreasingly, Beyoncé has used her art—that is, everything: the albums themselves, but also her videos, her tours, Instagram, and so on—to examine power imbalances and to show how people blanch when those imbalances are brought up to the surface for examination. Think about the “Formation” video, in which a Black child dances in front of a line of cops wearing riot gear, or her Super Bowl halftime show, where she paid homage to the Black Panthers, or her Lemonade longform visual, in which she reimagined images of American wealth and power with Black women at the forefront.\n\nIn a way, all of it was a prelude to Saturday’s set, which felt like her most definitive statement yet, the kind of show that requires a deep and widely-known catalog, ideological ambition, and a thorough knowledge of history (musical and otherwise). Beyoncé has a cultural sixth sense for finding the busted seams between regions and eras and styles, and the performance saw her stitching those breaks back together in a way that made them new again.\n\nD’Angelo\n\nD’Angelo’s 1995 debut album, Brown Sugar, set the Virginia singer up as a certified soul star with a rapper’s aesthetic and an old-school sound. But an air of mystique began surrounding him not soon after his follow-up, Voodoo, in 2000. It was the album that made music critics see D’Angelo as a bonafide visionary—with the video for “Untitled (How Does It Feel)” standing as a visual record of his becoming. But due to the spotlight’s glare, D’Angelo would eventually retreat from the public eye, resurfacing in 2014 with his masterful comeback album, Black Messiah. As Ryan Dombal wrote in 2012:\n\nVoodoo arrived five years behind D’s home-recorded R&B debut, Brown Sugar, and blew through its fair share of release dates before touching down on January 25, 2000. Its arrival came during the twilight of the mega-CD era—six months after Napster’s birth, two years before the iPod—but its four-year gestation occurred during the halcyon ’90s, a time when artists were afforded the chance to tinker for years on end while blazing through bottomless studio budgets. The record topped the Billboard albums chart during its first two weeks out, and looking at 2000’s other #1s—including N’Sync’s record-breaking No Strings Attached, Eminem’s angsty Marshall Mathers LP, and, uh, Limp Bizkit’s Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water—Voodoo stands tall with October’s Kid A as a paranoid, mysterious, and challenging artistic statement that somehow managed to scale the industry.\n\nNotable reviews: Brown Sugar (1995), Voodoo (2000), Black Messiah (2014)\n\nDestroyer\n\nWhen Dan Bejar sings in his nasally buzzing voice he sounds amused and accusatory, pointing out the ridiculous characters that surround him—an apothecary’s daughter, a distro king for the hearing impaired, a visionary prophetess East Van punk—but never sparing himself. The raconteur scuttled around the edges of rock for a half-dozen often-great albums until he stumbled on the perfect sonic background for his musings with 2011’s loungey synth-and-sax masterpiece Kaputt. Since then he’s become an indie-rock elder, rarely missing on record as he ages gracefully. As Amanda Petrusich wrote of 2017’s ken:\n\nIt’s hard not to reference the synth-pop and smooth jazz of the ’80s when contextualizing Bejar’s musical aesthetic—he uses saxophones and keyboards to express a particular kind of sleazy, noir-ish longing, a yen for anachronistic romance. The images ken conjures can feel nearly cartoonish: a midnight walk down a foggy street, smoking under the tepid yellow glow of a streetlight, wearing an elegant trench coat with the collar flipped high. Yet for Bejar, songwriting is almost exclusively about evocation. His lyrical work isn’t particularly narrative, nor is it directly engaged with the self; this can feel like a revolutionary choice in our present era, in which even more outré genres tend toward confessionalism, or intimate and specific narrations of loss and alienation. One gets the sense that Bejar finds these sorts of unmediated first-person pronouncements garish, if not corny. He isn’t interested in telling anybody exactly how he’s feeling; ergo, there are no easily discerned thematic arcs. Instead, he builds a strange, anxious atmosphere, writing couplets like, “Asleep in cars, theatre under stars/Shakespeare in the park, you’ve come undone.” All that computes, ultimately, is menace.\n\nFurther reading: “Destroyer’s Dan Bejar Serenades the Apocalypse” (2020)\n\nDrake\n\nMore than a decade ago, Drake willed himself from being a former Degrassi star with a promising mixtape into “Drake featuring Drake,” the pop-rap kingpin casting a regal finger in the air to determine global trends. As with many artists, his most exciting work came when he was still fighting his way up the ladder, from the opulent introspection of 2011’s Take Care to the cocksure braggadocio of 2015’s If You're Reading This It's Too Late mixtape, but this year’s Certified Lover Boy recently had the year’s best-selling week of any album—proof that it’s still the Drake era, and we’re just lurking on his girlfriends’ timeline. As Matthew Strauss wrote in his review of that recent album:\n\nThe Certified Lover Boy is selectively honest, occasionally heartless, and set in his ways. He’ll text, “I love you,” and pretend he doesn’t; he’ll ask for a sympathetic ear, but scoff and leave “if you throw another pity party” about your own troubles. He’s Drake—past, present, and future—and Certified Lover Boy, accordingly, is referential and reverential, an 86-minute omnibus of all things Drake. Being everything at once, the Drake of Certified Lover Boy is also indecisive and even fatigued. Drake is still trying to balance fame, intimacy, ambition, and insecurity, and he’s still learning who to trust—it’s always trust with Drake—but there’s a malaise that lingers across the record, as if Drake has lost himself in the Library of Drake, less sure where he’s supposed to devote his attention while an emptiness creeps into his life and lifestyle.\n\nErykah Badu\n\nEven today, Erykah Badu’s chart-topping debut Baduizm sounds timeless: a smoky offering of neo-soul spiked with humor and spirituality that set the stage for an expansive career. The Dallas native has put out four more definitive albums of jazzy R&B infused with mystical salves, political anthems, and a laid-back style, paving the way for countless acts in her wake. As Clover Hope wrote in her retrospective review of Baduizm:\n\nWhile recording a demo in her hometown of Dallas in 1995, Erykah Badu found love in the simplicity of a rim shot. It’s a fundamental drum technique: the act of striking the metal edge and the head of a snare simultaneously to produce a full, explosive hit. To her, it was also a creative spark. Badu called up producer-songwriter Madukwu Chinwah, asked what “that tick-tock sound” was, and had him compose an entire rim shot-based rhythm for her. They made a song out of it, connecting the kick and the snare with the stimulating sensation of love: Boom. Clack. Boom. Clack. She made all her music this way, letting the groove lead her into streams of consciousness that became worldwide gospel.\n\nOut of those demo sessions came her February 1997 debut, Baduizm, bookended by the original recording of “Rim Shot,” split into an intro and outro. The record went double platinum by summer and that year won the Grammy for Best R&B Album under the banner of a divisive new subgenre, neo-soul. Baduizm was an instant hit of intimate existentialism. It stripped the act of soul-searching down to its philosophical elements, mining abstract concepts like self-love, romantic love, and spirituality. There’s a throughline to albums like Solange’s 2016 opus A Seat at the Table, which similarly harnesses the power of Black music as a salve. They are full of control and surrender at the same time, confident in their search for answers even when there are none.\n\nFrank Ocean is the hinge artist of our time, the true voice of a generation because he takes long silences. With Blonde and its attendant works, his Boys Don’t Cry zine and Endless, he took his time building his staircase to somewhere. Elusive and independent, he weaves from genre to genre, sometimes shifting gears to obliterate category altogether, as he cruises past the conventions the culture still fears to let go. On Blonde, the languid guitar of surf rock coexists with soft doo-wop melodies; Frank the rapper—who is heady and occasionally, knowingly vulgar—coincides with Frank the singer, who is plaintive and longing. Sometimes, he just talks rhythmically, like in “Nights.” “Futura Free,” the triptych anchor of Blonde, moves from midtempo to atmospheric synth to a clanging guitar solo. The impressionistic lyrics mirror the feeling of wanting to disappear, for a spell: “Breathe till I evaporated/My whole body see through.”\n\nThe year 2016 crystallized the political disaster right under the surface. People theorized that we needed anthems to get us through the dark night. Big choruses, hooks as wide as highway signs, regular percussion that could gird us from chaos. But our mood was languorous; jingoism was the problem in the first place. We wanted the blurred, the softened, the existential. “Inhale, in hell, there’s heaven,” Ocean sings on “Solo,” capturing the whiplash experience of being young in this country in one line. Blonde is one synonym for American.\n\nNotable reviews: Nostalgia, Ultra (2011), Channel Orange (2012), Blonde (2016)\n\nGrimes\n\nTo know a great deal about Claire Boucher’s personal life is to wish you spent a lot less time online. But the tabloid stuff and the unfortunate statements obscure the fact that when it comes time to release a Grimes album she has, so far, always delivered. She’s a true original and an auteur in an era when being a skilled imitator with the right collaborators can take you far. Her mind just works differently and her warped brand of experimental pop still sounds like no one else’s. As Anupa Mistry wrote of 2020’s Miss Anthropocene:\n\nIn 2011, Grimes was eager to tell an interviewer that she had “been studying pop stars.” Since emerging out of Montreal’s freewheeling music scene 10 years ago as a DIY ingénue, Claire Boucher has become known for her experimental production that often traded discernible lyrics for otherworldly and synthetic vocal textures. The words she sang didn’t figure into what made her music so fascinating—it was how she used her vocals to mimic whalesong or aliensong, a futurist reimagining of the transfixing voices of Enya and Mariah Carey, over irresistible melodies. Yes, Grimes always wanted to be a pop star, but on her own creative terms.\n\nNotable reviews: Visions (2012); Art Angels (2015); Miss Anthropocene (2020)\n\nJAY-Z\n\nThe murders of Tupac and Biggie left a hole in hip-hop that JAY-Z has filled ever since, molding the genre in his image. From his cold-blooded early tales of drug dealing to his glossy anthems of excess to his more recent self-analysis raps, he has amassed one of the deepest catalogs in hip-hop history. At this point, at age 51, his only competition is himself. Reflecting on Jay’s classic album The Blueprint in 2015, Hanif Abdurraqib wrote:\n\nA king without a fully formed crown, the Jay-Z of 2001 was still looking for a mid-career masterpiece to transition him seamlessly from the block to the boardroom. The Blueprint still holds up as the album we needed before we knew we would need it. A love letter to reinvention, an ode to being rebuilt as a newer and stronger machine. In the aftermath of an unimaginable violence, I believed in “Takeover” as more than just a diss track, but also as a meditation on fear and fearlessness. A flag of our own making, stuck in fragile ground. This is not a wholly patriotic statement, rather, what it can feel like to wrestle power back from overwhelming anxiety. Owning your space while you still have it, even if it’s only for three minutes. I find this in hip-hop more than anywhere else, even now. It could be due to the idea that so many rappers are making music to legitimize their lives, or become less feared in a country that has always used its fear of them to justify their death. The Blueprint was a brave and immensely sad album, at a time when both of those things were equally felt, and equally needed.\n\nKamasi Washington\n\nIn 2015, Kamasi Washington broke through with his three-hour-long debut album, appropriately titled The Epic, and was immediately dubbed jazz’s latest savior. But the saxophonist and bandleader hardly came out of nowhere: Raised in Inglewood, California, he spent more than a decade making his name in and around Los Angeles, playing with the likes of Raphael Saadiq, Lauryn Hill, and Chaka Khan, as well as with a tight crew of local jazz aces. With The Epic, alongside his essential contributions to Kendrick Lamar’s game-changing To Pimp a Butterfly, Washington ushered in a style that combined elements of fusion, funk, and spiritual jazz, that was rooted in the past but not bound to it. As Jeff Weiss wrote in a 2017 interview piece:\n\nIf you asked random strangers in this Culver City café to look around the room and select the man who’s repeatedly been called “the future of jazz,” Kamasi Washington would be the No. 1 draft choice. He looks like Sun Ra reborn as a lineman: hulking but gentle, capable of thunderous cosmic wrath and meditative calm. His massive frame is swaddled in a long black tunic, medallions dangle from his neck, and a kaleidoscopic wooden skullcap protects a thick shrub of hair.\n\nThe Inglewood native speaks softly and carries a big stick. This isn’t figurative observation, but literal fact. His regular voice is as serene as his tenor sax is a roaring cataract. Washington also rarely leaves the block without an ornate wooden shark cane. It matches perfectly with the array of spiked panther rings on his right hand—one of which accidentally stabs me as we exchange greetings. Whether you prefer calling it a presence or an aura, there’s something about Washington that suggests this isn’t his first cycle in samsāra. In concert, his saxophone peals rumble out of an extra-sensory, multi-dimensional vale. Legendary jazz fusion bassist Stanley Clarke called him the heir to the astral master, Pharaoh Sanders. His music is a healing psychedelic balm in a time of bleary chaos.\n\nKendrick Lamar\n\nRap is always in search of the next greatest MC after the last great one, and from the beginning of his career, Kendrick Lamar immediately occupied the role. Since dropping his 2011 debut Section.80, the Compton rapper has straddled two disparate parts of the rap universe: the traditional neighborhood-groomed lyricists and the new-era misfits. This split personality has allowed him to be as experimental as he wants to be while acting as a bridge between two worlds and taking the genre to newer heights, like becoming the first rapper to win a Pulitzer Prize. As Tom Breihan wrote in 2011:\n\nKendrick Lamar is a weird kid, and rap music could always use more weird kids. The 24-year-old is a Compton native with a budding and mysterious Dr. Dre connection, but there's little-to-no link to his hometown’s gangsta-funk legacy in his music. Instead, Lamar is very much a product of the late blog-rap era—an introverted loner type who's willing to talk tough but is more interested in taking a Mag-Lite to his own personal failings and what he sees as the flaws of his generation. His rap style is fluid and melodic but approachable, and his frantic tumble of syllables evokes the feeling when you’re high enough that your thoughts arrive fast and interrupt each other. If one of the Bone Thugs guys had a dorky, overly sincere younger cousin who was really into Afrobeat and Terrence Malick movies, it’d be Kendrick.\n\nLCD Soundsystem\n\n“Losing My Edge,” the 2002 debut single from James Murphy’s LCD Soundsystem, might almost be called a novelty single were it not such a trenchant piece of music criticism in and of itself. But by the time the group performed its triumphant farewell show nine years later, it had become one of the defining bands of the 21st century. Since reforming in 2016, they have confirmed their bona fides as keepers of the indie-rock flame, continuing to expand their catalog of wryly relatable songs about aging, disappointment, and fidelity to the thing you love. In 2017, Ryan Dombal wrote of the band’s comeback album, American Dream:\n\nAs an ace student of the game—“LCD is a band about a band writing music about writing music,” he once quipped—James Murphy knew that he couldn’t just reunite for a lucrative victory lap, playing his most popular songs on Spotify to the genre-agnostic, dance-friendly demographic he helped cultivate throughout the 2000s. It would ruin the legacy and go against everything LCD stood for: integrity, respect, a sly but genuine love of just how much music can shape a human being’s identity. So even though a new album was always planned since the band officially reformed 20 months ago, the intervening hit-filled gigs could feel odd. Yes, they sounded great, and all the members looked excited to be playing together again, but the context was tweaked. LCD Soundsystem were no longer on the cusp of a cultish zeitgeist. Murphy still sang “This could be the last time” during “All My Friends,” though the line’s tang of finality was dulled.\n\nLil Wayne\n\nDuring the back half of the 2000s, Lil Wayne proved his claim of being the “best rapper alive” on what seemed like a daily basis. He sprinted ahead of a music industry still struggling to transition to streaming by dropping a spate of mixtapes, each one more virtuosic than the last; guest verses for everyone from OutKast to Enrique Iglesias; and chart-chomping singles. This age of abundance cleared a path for other hip-hop eccentrics, including Tyler, the Creator and Young Thug. Wayne’s untouchable era culminated in 2008’s Tha Carter III, of which Ryan Dombal wrote:\n\nInstead of hiding his bootleg-bred quirks in anticipation of the big-budget spotlight, he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions found on his recent mixtapes into a commercially gratifying package that’s as weird as it wants to be. As the major music industry continued to wheeze and splinter, Lil Wayne’s spitball marketing plan for Tha Carter III was an unprecedented masterstroke. Over the past couple of years, he’s given away more worthwhile free music online than most artists of his stature ever release officially. Using the mixtape market as a free-for-all training ground, Wayne expanded his persona, voice, and talent while presumptively killing off thousands of wannabe MCs hoping to charge five bucks for some garbage CD-R. For that alone, he deserves thanks. Wayne set the definition for a Web 2.0 MC—his output pours through computer speakers at broadband speeds.\n\nMissy Elliott\n\nBy the time she exploded into the mainstream’s consciousness wearing a trash bag in the “The Rain” video in 1997, Missy Elliott had already made her mark behind the scenes as a songwriter and producer, most notably on Aaliyah’s One in a Million alongside Timbaland. What followed was a game-changing string of singles, albums, and videos that cemented Missy’s status as one of the most brilliant minds in hip-hop history. As Rawiya Kameir put it in 2019:\n\nIn an era characterized by celebrity worship on one side and celebrity “canceling” on the other, Missy’s persona only amplifies her work, which is expansive, challenging, and inordinately fun. In 1997, as hip-hop was becoming a billion-dollar industry staked on authenticity, Missy exploded the concept of character. Growing up in Virginia, removed from the centers of rap and pop, gave her the freedom to do what made sense to her. She regularly juxtaposed the naturalism in her lyrics with the fantastical brick-by-brick world-building of her videos, which articulated mad-cap, space- and anime-inspired visions of not only the future, but of alternate dimensions. She often did the same within her songs, eschewing dense wordplay in favor of booming soundscapes that, for example, grounded a droning synth with the warm sound of a tabla.\n\nOutKast\n\nThroughout their 15-year recording career, Andre 3000 and Big Boi simply never dwelled in the present. Their music had no fixed boundaries but a distinct Atlanta style and drawl; their albums were abstract splashes that resist definition. It’s no small feat that they consistently sounded like they were dialed into contemporary rap while at the same time phoning in from the future. A decade and a half after their last album, the rest of the world is still catching up. As kris ex wrote in a 2018 Sunday Review of Stankonia:\n\nIdentity and location—and defining and observing the two on their own terms—have always been key with OutKast. All of their albums began with a disembodied intro track as a prelude, followed by a State of the OutKast declaration that proved that, as André would famously go on to say at the 1995 Source Awards, “the South got something to say.” Tellingly, André confessed, “I gots a lot of shit up on my mind,” on “Myintrotoletuknow” from their 1994 debut Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik. Their voices spat out harsh rhymes and stretched out melodic moments, but they also spoke about things widely and deeply, respecting and commenting on everything going on in hip-hop, largely by ignoring everything going on in hip-hop. Their sonic brashness and directness had Public Enemy’s Chuck D in its DNA, their fashion had antecedents in the Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five meeting Afrika Bambaataa’s Soulsonic Force, the subversive whimsy of De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest were their forebears, giving the group a musical intensity and breadth incomparable to any other major hip-hop act before or since. Those are weighty statements, but OutKast was OutKast—singular, inimitable, and unpredictable.\n\nFurther reading: “Atlanta to Atlantis: An Outkast Retrospective” (2013)\n\nRihanna\n\nBefore “release the album” became a tired internet cry, Rihanna was doing precisely that, dropping records like hotcakes almost every year. They were all stacked with singles—often to a tee, forsaking clear conceptual voice for chart placement. Then came 2016’s ANTI, her most refined and ambitious work to date, the record that most embodies the Bad Gal ideology. As Jayson Greene wrote in a 2017 piece about her influence as a vocalist:\n\nWhen people write about Rihanna’s singing, they often use words like “flat” or “thin” or “limitations”—something that suggests her voice is the secret defect hiding in her otherwise-brilliant plumage, the limp disguised by the swagger. She “doesn’t have the range,” as the deathless meme had it. It is indisputably the aspect of her art that gets the least critical attention. And yet listen to radio, when Rihanna isn’t on it—which, granted, isn’t too often—and you will hear molecules of her vocal style swarming around everywhere. Even-toned, husky but nasal, tinged with island breezes but essentially free of regional markers—that describes a whole lot of pop songs now, by a whole lot of people. My ears perked up most recently at the beginning of Lorde’s “Green Light”: Between the the lightly taunting way Lorde clips the word “bite” and the growling dip to “I hear sounds in my mind,” Rihanna’s ambient influence creeps in, like blunt smoke curling under a closed door.\n\nSOPHIE\n\nIn the mid 2010s, within the span of a few singles, SOPHIE effectively rewired pop music’s synapses. The Scottish producer’s radically experimental club pop gradually infiltrated the front lines of the mainstream: Vince Staples, Charli XCX, Madonna—even McDonald’s commercials. Yet SOPHIE’s influence was not strictly musical. As one of pop culture’s most visible trans artists, SOPHIE’s almost utopian belief in futurism was intimately connected to philosophical questions about selfhood and being in the world. Following SOPHIE’s death earlier this year at age 34, Philip Sherburne wrote:\n\nFrom the very beginning, SOPHIE came bearing something radical and new: a sound that had not been heard before, and a vision that peered up out of the present moment, periscope-like, in search of the unknown. SOPHIE knew that the future is fragile: It’s not just that so many Tomorrowland fantasies turn to kitsch but that the very idea of musical futurism, once so central to pop and the avant-garde alike, has become a relic. Culture’s ability to see past the horizon has become increasingly eclipsed by its addiction to the past. But this artist was not afflicted with that myopia. Across a string of singles, a handful of collaborations, and one staggering album, the music of the Scottish-born producer combined pop instincts, uncompromisingly experimental musical ideas, formidable programming chops, and a self-presentation that was at once mischievous and movingly guileless. The result was a body of work that was essentially hopeful, like a roadmap to a better world in which to be vulnerable was, ironically, synonymous with becoming indestructible.\n\nNotable reviews: PRODUCT (2015), OIL OF EVERY PEARL’S UN-INSIDES (2018)\n\nTame Impala\n\nKevin Parker’s Tame Impala debuted with Innerspeaker in 2010, a time of fierce competition in the world of psychedelic indie rock. He was small-time next to fellow travelers MGMT and Animal Collective, but within a few years he would have no peers as he transformed into one of the great record makers of the era. The astonishing and increasingly pristine production found on Lonerism, Currents, and The Slow Rush naturally brought pop superstars into his orbit, and he’s collaborated with people like Lady Gaga and Travis Scott. But his own music is resolutely personal, the sound of one dude alone in the studio trying to get everything just right. As Jillian Mapes wrote in her review of The Slow Rush:\n\nFor Kevin Parker, perfectionism is a lonely thing. The fastidious Tame Impala mastermind often copes with his self-isolation and doubt through stonerisms, highly portable mantras like “let it happen” and “yes I’m changing” and “gotta be above it” (said three times fast to ward off bad vibes). Their inverse is the negativity Parker’s trying to keep at bay in his head: “But you’ll make the same old mistakes.” It is easy to get lost in all the layers of groovy, time-traveling technicolor surround sound, particularly because Parker isn’t really trying to be clever or literary, but the internal tug of war within the Australian musician’s lyrics—between trying to better yourself and stay present, or succumbing to your own worst thoughts—is part of what keeps fans faithfully returning to Tame’s three albums, perhaps subconsciously. The repetition of phrases pairs well with the dubby, trance-like aspects of the music. Think of it as psychedelia for people with meditation apps and vape pens: Instead of opening your mind, you’re just trying to silence it.\n\nNotable reviews: Innerspeaker (2010); Lonerism (2012); Currents (2015)\n\n50 Cent\n\nThese days, 50 Cent is better known as a social media agitator than a chart-topper, but every villain has an origin story. In the mid-aughts, the rapper infamously shook up hip-hop, re-aligning the mainstream’s focus from crossover collaborations to gangsta fare—while still making literal candy-coated rap. That he rose so quickly from mixtape kingpin to pop antagonizer wasn’t surprising. As David Drake wrote in 2016:\n\nAfter the 2000 shooting that nearly ended his life, 50 Cent’s burgeoning career was deemed DOA. But hip-hop doesn’t much like certainties—it’s a genre bound by the narrative of the underdog. And though he arrived in mainstream America like a sure thing, cosigned by hip-hop’s biggest names and bankrolled by its most notorious label, it was his outsider status on the mixtapes 50 Cent Is the Future, God’s Plan, and No Mercy, No Fear that positioned him as the genre’s next superstar.\n\nThe 1975\n\nWith their omnivorous taste, zeitgeist-capturing lyrics, and arena ambition, the 1975 quickly became one of the 21st century’s most talked-about rock bands. As they bounce from genre to genre—their intentionally overwhelming releases filled with pop anthems, thrashy singalongs, and ambient interludes—their music is equally confrontational and crowd-pleasing. In addition to their own releases, the group’s in-house label Dirty Hit has become home to a diverse range of up-and-comers, establishing the 1975 not just as trend-setters but mentors for the next generation of pop iconoclasts. As Ryan Dombal wrote in a review of 2018’s A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships:\n\nThe 1975 dare to be too much. Led by frontman and lyricist Matty Healy, the quartet has made its name on an unruly brand of abundance throughout this decade: musically, referentially, emotionally, all of it. Did Healy pop pills, lick coke, and twirl a revolver before holding up a convenience store and getting shot in the torso—but ending up totally fine!—in the video for early hit “Robbers”? He did. Did they lavish the title I like it when you sleep, for you are so beautiful yet so unaware of it upon their second album because it was the only thing grandiloquent enough to match the record’s fizzy mix of sunblast synths, plastic guitars, and millennial neuroses? Of course. And did they preface their new LP, A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships, with a 24-page manifesto that includes manic scribbles (“THIS IDEA HAS BEEN DONE BEFORE”), a picture of Healy petting a dog whilst on the toilet, and a technophobic survey of our contemporary clusterfuck of an existence that concludes: “THE LEFT AND RIGHT GROW MORE APART BUT YOU CAN JUST CLICK ‘ADD TO CART”’ Yes, yes, and more yes. To infinity.\n\nA$AP Rocky\n\nBy the end of the aughts, New York rap was in a lull, having surrendered much of its luster and swagger to Southern MCs. Then came the A$AP Mob era. The crew’s frontman, A$AP Rocky, made the city worthy of a stylish crown again, reshaping the NYC rap scene in his gregariously flossy image. As Jeff Weiss put it in 2011:\n\nSince the emergence of Dipset and G-Unit in the first half of the last decade, NYC rap aspirants have largely fallen into four categories: ringtone wunderkinds (“This Is Why I’m Hot”, “Chicken Noodle Soup”), technically skilled personality voids (Papoose, Saigon), artful traditionalists (Action Bronson, Roc Marciano, Ka), and Maino.\n\nBy contrast, Rocky was telegenic and chanting swag. His lead singles poured syrup-slow Houston ride music atop the malt liquor melodies of Harlem’s Max B. What Rocky lacked in lyricism, he made up for in narcotic charisma. Seeking street-cred, Drake announced plans to take Rocky on tour. Seeking swag-cred, Lloyd Banks and Jim Jones hopped on tracks with him. Hype metastasizes fastest in New York, and it's easy to conflate the need for a standard bearer with the desire for a savior. Rocky was the chosen one.\n\nFurther reading: Interviews with A$AP Rocky from 2011 and 2013\n\nAir\n\nAir’s 1998 album Moon Safari so perfectly captured the sound of its era—head-nodding trip-hop, swooning easy listening, and hypnotic techno pop swirled into highly original space-age love songs—that they were associated with it forevermore. But they never made the same album twice and they could be surprisingly adventurous—their Virgin Suicides soundtrack and the Nigel Godrich-assisted Talkie Walkie are recognized classics, but the deeply weird 10000 Hz Legend sounds better than you remember. As Philip Sherburne wrote of the band’s 2016 best-of collection, Twentyears:\n\nFor many years, Air’s clever hybrid of downbeat electronic, 1960s pop, and Gallic kitsch served as a gateway to undiscovered worlds of cool. They brought their cachet to artists long out of fashion: the leather-voiced Serge Gainsbourg, the antic electronic experimenters Perrey and Kingsley, the easy-listening maestro Burt Bacharach, the mellifluous synth wizard Tomita. They spun effortless good taste into a form as frothy, weightless, and melt-on-your-tongue easy to consume as meringue.\n\nHowever, Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel are more than just hip foreign exchange students who lived with you in high school and left behind a bunch of really cool CD-Rs. Over the course of their two-decade career, the French duo expanded their dandelion-tuft pop sound across nine albums—among them groundbreaking film scores, Italian spoken-word collaborations, and a vinyl-only soundtrack to a museum exhibition. They’re not afraid to experiment.\n\nFurther reading: “Interview: Air” (2012)\n\nAmy Winehouse\n\nAmy Winehouse appeared like an apparition in 2003, sounding nothing like her contemporary soul peers but rather a callback to the scratchy-voiced legends of bygone eras destined to haunt us from beyond. Real-life trauma bled into her songwriting, often so brutally honest it hurt. It was this painful level of transparency that spawned a new era of marketable retro-soul acts both before and after her death in 2011. As Jess Harvell explained in 2011:\n\nThat’s what makes Winehouse’s loss so acute from a musical standpoint, and it’s what the legions of trend-grabbers and American Idol hopefuls essaying her songs never quite get. She could do a straight, tearful ballad like “Love Is a Losing Game,” something you could imagine any number of singers adequately covering. But in Winehouse’s best songs, there’s always something odd, pained, and ineluctably personal in lyric and voice alike. Record execs will likely be grateful that Winehouse’s brief success opened up a lucrative market for “real” music. Listeners can lament the fact that we lost someone who understood that “realness” is a sham without the candor and distinctiveness to back up the chops.\n\nAngel Olsen\n\nOn a series of increasingly ambitious albums released across the 2010s, Angel Olsen honed a deeply intimate songwriting style while nonetheless declining to offer “too much self” to her listeners. That balance of closeness and distance, and her inimitable singing voice, helped her to resurrect the grandeur of 20th century American pop and country, as she refracted the sounds of greats like Elvis, Hank Williams, and Emmylou Harris through ever more idiosyncratic lenses. As Laura Snapes wrote in her review of 2019’s All Mirrors:\n\nEach of her artistic developments has been heralded as some sort of permanent shift in her work or her commercial aspirations: Now she’s an indie star. Now she wants to be a pop star. Oh, she’s collaborating with Mark Ronson? She must really want to be a pop star. But the wild range of All Mirrors and Olsen’s vocal performance fly in the face of the idea that identity and artistry are fixed, and consequently turn over how much we can ever know each other, and ourselves. She finds nuance and enduring pleasure in her game of faces.\n\nANOHNI\n\nBorn of the mid-’90s downtown New York avant-garde, ANOHNI and her chamber-pop ensemble, the Johnsons, bridged the gap between the art world and indie music while subverting the status quo of both. Collaborating with Oneohtrix Point Never and Hudson Mohawke for her electro-pop opus HOPELESSNESS in 2016, she created protest songs about the climate crisis, drone warfare, and the disease of capitalism, amplifying her uncompromising voice. In a review of that album, Jenn Pelly wrote:\n\nHOPELESSNESS is a record where the American dream is a hallucination, where we are all called out. It is the sonic equivalent of a burning Shepard Fairey painting and all its embers. Poignant political realities have always grounded ANOHNI’s work, but now they are at the forefront, articulated with an incisiveness that stares you in the eye. The album places her alongside radical pop provocateurs like M.I.A., artists who propose difficult questions that mainstream America does not want to ask because it would not know what to do with the answers. But she insists that we raise our stakes. ‘A lot of the music scene is just a wanking, self-congratulatory boys club,’ she said in 2012. ‘It’s just so fucking boring and not useful. It’s such a waste of our time... another reflection of how astray we are as a civilization.’ HOPELESSNESS disrupts that.\n\nArca\n\nIn the same way that research into dark matter keeps reshaping our understanding of the universe, Alejandra Ghersi’s music as Arca upended fundamental assumptions about the nature of electronic music. In 2012, when she released the EP Stretch 1, she seemed to defy all the rules of the club; her elastic beats moved and shifted shapes with a logic all their own. But Arca’s interests weren’t merely formal. Across the course of releases like 2014’s Xen, 2017’s Arca, and 2020’s KiCk i—and collaborations with Björk, Rosalía, and SOPHIE—her breathtaking experimentation was intimately bound up in questions of identity and transnsness, inquiries as philosophical as they were musical. As Emilie Friedlander wrote in a retrospective review of Arca’s 2013 mixtape &&&&&:\n\nWhen &&&&& dropped out of the blue, it felt like we’d finally arrived in the future. The 25-minute mixtape sounded like a celebration of speed, of the infinity of musical information that the internet puts at our fingertips, of the wild emotional contrasts of a night spent staring down the barrel of one’s feed. Though the Venezuelan producer’s source materials (grime, trap, glitch, dub) derived largely from club culture, &&&&& seemed to take a mischievous pleasure in disrupting the metric grid that dance music was built on. Even the image that accompanied it—a bird-like creature with distended legs and translucent skin, courtesy of artist Jesse Kanda—seemed to suggest the birth of something new, quivering inside an amniotic sack of digital slime.\n\nIn truth, &&&&& was probably less the dawn of a novel genre of electronic music than the crystallization of a perspectival shift that had already been in the works for some time—and not just in the foggy rooms of GHE20G0TH1K, the joyfully irreverent LGBTQ and POC-focused dance party where Arca interned as a college student at NYU, though it probably started there. Where the cool kids of the late ’00s had met the rising tide of technology with a retreat to the obsolete sounds and formats of the past (think: the vinyl collector culture driving the global techno scene, the cassette tape fetish of the chillwave generation), a new generation of producers and DJs at the turn of the ’10s—armed with CDJs and sample packs and vape pens—seemed to see a new revolutionary potential.\n\nNotable reviews: &&&&& (2013); Xen (2014); Mutant (2015); Arca (2017)\n\nArctic Monkeys\n\nIn 2005, Arctic Monkeys burst out of what seemed like nowhere—actually Sheffield, England, and a then-emergent Myspace—with a clutch of catchy, vernacular garage-rock songs about debaucherous nights out. With their surprising shift into brawny riffs and sultry grooves on 2013’s AM, they wound up playing arenas around America, then launched themselves into even stranger destinations. As Jazz Monroe wrote in a review of 2018’s Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino:\n\nAlex Turner wrote Arctic Monkeys’ sixth album in Los Angeles on an upright piano in his spare room. As it took shape, he christened his makeshift studio the Lunar Surface, after the theory that Stanley Kubrick faked the Apollo moon landing on a soundstage. When Turner assembled his bandmates, they were alarmed to find he’d applied this concept literally: Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino is a song suite documenting a futuristic moon colony and the exodus that spawned it, told by an assortment of unreliable narrators who can sometimes barely string a sentence together. After 2013’s wildly successful AM, Turner is now writing lyrics in an entirely new idiom, swapping witty sleaze for absurdist suave.\n\nAgainst the odds, the resulting LP finds the former street poet at his most visionary: material only he could write, performed with a charm and bravado that only he could pull off. He veers from croons to falsetto, splicing together hyperrealist satire, sham biography, and interstellar escapism. Glints of social commentary yield to the whims of his narrators—forgetful, distractible oddballs and drunk egomaniacs who have no right to be so captivating.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nBy the spring of 2017, it was clear that Ariana Grande had the range. The Nickelodeon actress turned pop diva had three chart-topping albums, collaborations with superstars like Nicki Minaj, a Broadway credit, and a delicious scandal. But after a period of horrific tragedy, Grande retreated and reset, eventually emerging with music that pushed her artistry further as it asserted a magical trifecta of hope, joy, and a powerhouse voice. Meaghan Garvey captured Grande’s moment of transformation in 2018:\n\nMaking something joyful out of tragedy is no easy feat, but Ariana Grande has done it before. After a homemade bomb killed 22 people during the Manchester stop of her Dangerous Woman tour last year, the singer organized a massive benefit concert for the victims in less than two weeks. Grande closed out her set that night with a cover of “Over the Rainbow”; by the end, she was crying, along with most of the audience. Almost a year later, a rainbow prism softly illuminates her face in the artwork for “No Tears Left to Cry,” her first single since the attack.\n\nYou might expect “No Tears” to be some kind of somber ballad, and that’s how it begins. But then, as Grande sings, “Ain’t got no tears left to cry/So I’m pickin’ it up, pickin’ it up,” the percussion shuffles into a UK garage-inspired beat, another little nod to Manchester. Suddenly, we’re right in Grande’s sweet spot: soaring diva house. It’s a natural step in the direction the more upbeat moments of her catalog have been heading, from the climactic EDM balladry of 2014’s “One Last Time” to 2016’s “Be Alright,” which saw Grande dipping her toes into slick, Disclosure-style two-step. But on “No Tears,” she takes it all the way there and the results are superb, evoking turn-of-the-millennium, vocal-led garage buoyed by the kind of gospel delivery that Grande pulls off better than any of her pop peers. It’s striking in its optimism: the soundtrack for the exact moment you decide to keep going.\n\nThe Avalanches\n\nThe Avalanches’ sample-drunk 2000 debut Since I Left You was so brilliant it sustained interest in the Australian DJs for 16 long years, until the release of follow-up Wildflower. We stayed in love with that first record because nothing else could take its place—plenty of party-starting records came along, but none had the Avalanches’ sense of innocence and wonder. And when they returned again last year with We Will Always Love You, that quality was still intact. As Mark Richardson wrote in his review of Wildflower:\n\nTo listen to the Avalanches is to wrestle with time. The sample-rich music makes you think about where its pieces come from, what those fragments meant to you then, and what they mean to you embedded into the group's finished songs. There’s nostalgia and loss ingrained in every bar, and you can sense the erratic movement of past, present, and future from the first listen. When Since I Left You arrived in 2000 it seemed less like the arrival of a new kind of pop than a bittersweet farewell to a decade that was coming to a close. The album mixed the technique and spirit of the Dust Brothers and transported it from the urban street to an open field far somewhere far from civilization, some place where everyone is dressed colorfully and they’re either on MDMA or they remember their days taking it fondly.\n\nBeach House\n\nWhen Beach House issued their self-titled debut in 2006, the Baltimore duo was resurrecting a hazy sound that we hadn’t heard in a while—’80s and ’90s bands like Mazzy Star, Slowdive, and Galaxie 500 were early touchpoints. Across a remarkable run of records in the years since, Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally became the standard-bearers of the sound and vibe, the go-to reference for anyone making languorous and impressionistic music for dreaming. As Lindsay Zoladz wrote in her review of the 2012 album Bloom:\n\nTwo people from Baltimore started by making incense-smelling, curtains-drawn bedroom pop. Now, eight years later, they make luminous, sky-sized songs that conjure some alternate universe where Cocteau Twins have headlined every stadium on Atlantis. “Bloom” is also what these 10 songs do, each one starting with the sizzle of a lit fuse and at some fine moment exploding like a firework in slow motion. The word captures the music’s slow sonority: the round, gleaming edges of Alex Scally’s arpeggios and how, in Victoria Legrand’s unhurried mouth, all words seem to have a few extra vowels.\n\nNotable reviews: Devotion (2008); Teen Dream (2010); Bloom (2012); Depression Cherry (2015)\n\nBelle and Sebastian\n\nWhat began as the school project of a long-bedridden music obsessive grew into a charming cult phenomenon of the early internet, as word of this Scottish band’s two DIY miracles from 1996, Tigermilk and If You’re Feeling Sinister, spread across messageboards. In the 21st century, with newly tight live performances to go with glammed-up albums like Dear Catastrophe Waitress and The Life Pursuit, Belle and Sebastian reemerged to lead the burgeoning worldwide indie-pop congregation. As Elizabeth Nelson wrote in a review of the 2020 album What to Look for in Summer:\n\nIt’s been 24 years since Belle and Sebastian emerged from the Glasgow underground, clutching a surfeit of near-perfect songs. Their classic first two LPs established frontman and principal songwriter Stuart Murdoch as a generational talent, a writer who intuitively wedded the forensic character studies of Joni Mitchell to the chamber music of early John Cale, lending a Dylan-esque sophistication to the Sarah Records bands that were his sonic progenitors. Ever since then, they’ve endured personnel changes, sonic reinventions and on occasion, hurt feelings beyond repair. And yet they endure, having lasted a decade-and-a-half longer than the Beatles, Velvets, or Smiths.\n\nBen Gibbard (Death Cab for Cutie, The Postal Service)\n\nFormed in Bellingham, Washington, in 1997, Ben Gibbard’s band Death Cab for Cutie emerged from the ashes of the region’s grunge scene to embody a new model of indie rock, in which emo’s self-expression met the kinds of ambition—whether in terms of audience, concepts, or sheer sonics—that had long been anathema in the underground. Death Cab’s 2003 album Transatlanticism notched a new high-water mark for indie-rock striving; the same year, Gibbard’s group the Postal Service, a collaboration with producer Jimmy Tamborello, also featuring singer Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley, pioneered a fusion of emo and electro-pop that would go on to be just as influential in the following decades. As Ian Cohen wrote in a retrospective review of Death Cab’s 2003 album Transatlanticism:\n\nThe term “transatlanticism” was coined by Ben Gibbard to define the incomprehensible emotional gap between two lovers separated by comprehensible distances—the continental United States, an entire ocean, or, most likely, just a couple floors in your freshman dorm. In the 10 years since Death Cab for Cutie released their finest record, the title has taken on an unintended resonance in regards to their career. Before this album were three modestly performed and admirably successful LPs released on Seattle indie label Barsuk; after, three exquisite-sounding and wildly successful LPs released on New York City major label... Atlantic. Death Cab’s aesthetic hadn’t really changed all that much, and yet how do you span the distance between the uber-#feelings video for “A Movie Script Ending” and Grammy nominations, platinum sales (when they meant something), huge festival slots, and Zooey Deschanel? Look, it’s nigh impossible to extricate Death Cab’s ascendance from The O.C., so how’s this: From the moment the skyrocket guitars go off in “The New Year,” Death Cab are taking a leap of faith like Seth Cohen up on that kissing booth, risking embarrassment to tell as many people as possible that they may be dorks, but they’re not going to be anyone’s secret anymore.\n\nNotable reviews: Something About Airplanes (1998), Transatlanticism (2003), Plans (2005)\n\nBig Thief\n\nThe seeds of Big Thief were planted in 2012, when two recent New York transplants, Adrianne Lenker and Buck Meek, met by chance and began playing as a folk duo. When bassist Max Oleartchik and drummer James Krivchenia joined, the group expanded the dimensions of its sound exponentially without losing its essential intimacy. With every one of the four albums they have released across the last five years—not counting solo records and side projects—Big Thief have pushed further, establishing themselves as one of the most emotionally captivating bands in contemporary indie rock. As Jayson Greene wrote in his 2019 profile of the group:\n\nLenker’s songs are remarkably open and private at the same time—her voice is recorded with extraordinary clarity and intimacy, so that the songs sometimes seem to be blooming out of her rib cage. And yet their meanings are stubbornly opaque, the way a page from a stranger’s journal might be. On “Contact,” she tells a woman named Jodi that she is “both dreamer and dream” and sings, “I want to drink your milk.” The intimacy is unmistakable, but the context remains defiantly unclear.\n\nI ask her why she feels compelled to name the souls who occupy her songs. “Sometimes I’m saying real people’s names because there’s no better word for them,” she says. “Or maybe Jodi is a part of me. I really get quite tired of ‘I’ and ‘you’ in songs.” Here, she breaks into a fake, plaintive singing voice, mocking the world’s singer-songwriters and their tremulous self-absorption: “I wanted to, but I couldn’t. I feel this, and I feel thaaat*…” Lenker has a profound desire to duck out of the center of her own song’s narrative, she admits, and the names give some distance. She likens the people who populate her songs to guardian angels she can conjure at will.*\n\nBill Callahan (Smog)\n\nTwenty-four years ago, on the album Red Apple Falls, Bill Callahan fantasized about wanting nothing more than to be of use—like a candle, a horseshoe, a corkscrew. The sturdy work found on the 11 albums he’s released since—five as Smog, the rest under his own name—fulfill that wish. His songs, delivered with simple arrangements in his ever-deepening baritone, are useful above all else, showing us new ways to look at the world and maybe even new ways to understand ourselves. As Jayson Greene wrote in his review of the 2019 album Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest:\n\nHappiness is a difficult emotion to plumb for wisdom—we tend to reserve intensity of observation for the feelings we are trying desperately to get rid of, hoping that if we study them hard enough we might never have them again. Happiness? Well, happiness we just try to enjoy, praying we don’t fuck it up. And yet Callahan seems unafraid of fucking up his contentment by thinking too hard about it. Somehow, Callahan with a mile-wide grin on his face has as much to say about the universe as the grave, stoic guy he used to be. His career—from his early lo-fi instrumental experiments as Smog, to his slow evolution into the singer-songwriter he is today—is too rich and storied for easy superlatives, but Shepherd feels like his most something album ever—his warmest, his most generous, possibly his most profound. It is a high note, fond and deep and sustained.\n\nFurther reading: “Bill Callahan the Family Man” (2019)\n\nBillie Eilish\n\nBillie Eilish went viral at 13 with her SoundCloud ballad “Ocean Eyes” and then quickly became one of the world’s biggest and most distinctive pop stars—known for her baggy streetwear and bright, multi-colored hair, as well as haunted-house songs inspired by Wizards of Waverly Place or ones that sampled The Office. Eilish has since altered her sound and look and will inevitably go through multiple reinventions, but the pop landscape will continue to follow her. As Stacey Anderson wrote in a 2019 review of Eilish’s debut album:\n\nBillie Eilish is still waiting for her teeth to straighten out. This fact trumpets the arrival of When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?: For its intro, the 17-year-old removes her much-loathed transparent braces in a series of lightly gross, ASMR-worthy slurps, and proclaims, “I have taken out my Invisalign and this is the album.” She then dissolves into heaving cackles, the kind that alienates any onlookers too prissy to partake. There are several more oddball moments like this—absent-minded humming to a track, giggling asides—that remind us she’s still a precocious, creative teen girl on this rocket, and all her gothic proclivities don’t cancel out how much she’s enjoying the ride.\n\nBoards of Canada\n\nBoards of Canada make music out of dreams. The sun-bleached rural psychedelia of Scottish brothers Michael Sandison and Marcus Eoin is both influential and singular: many artists in their wake have incorporated fuzzed-out drones, crackly breakbeats, and warbly guitars, but none quite capture their uncanny magic. As Simon Reynolds wrote on the 20th anniversary of the duo’s essential 1998 album Music Has the Right to Children:\n\nThe record’s overall sound design broke with the clean, clear, clinical aura of the era. Instead, Boards of Canada used a mixture of analog and digital techniques to give their music a wavering, mottled quality redolent of formats like film, vinyl, and magnetic tape that are susceptible to decay and distortion with the passage of time. Listening to tracks like “Wildlife Analysis” or “The Color of the Fire” you can’t help but think of yellowing photographs in the family album, blotchy and washed-out Super-8 films, or the drop-out addled sound of favorite cassettes left too long on the car dashboard. In interviews around the album, the brothers talked of applying “a process of corruption” to their melodies, the vocals they sampled, and pretty much every texture in their music.\n\nBoredoms\n\nOsaka, Japan’s Boredoms tore apart rock music and rebuilt it from the ground up. Their supremely bent new version had the heaviest guitars, the wildest tape splices, and screams that could be joyous or terrifying; above all, Boredoms rock had drums, drums, drums, most often played by the mighty Yoshimi P-We. Bandleader Yamantaka Eye’s obsession with percussion led him away from record-making and toward participatory happenings, including the massive Boadrum concerts staged in 2007 and 2008. Boredoms have been mostly silent for years now, but listen closely and the echo is still there. As Mark Richardson wrote in a review of their 2009 album Super Roots 10:\n\nIn 1999, they were riding a wave of creativity the likes of which most bands can only dream about. In the year prior they’d released both Super Roots 7, which on better days sounds like the final word on the visceral power of rock’n’roll repetition, and Super Ae, on which they revealed themselves as masters of playful trance-inducing psychedelia with spiritual underpinnings. And they were about to put out Vision Creation Newsun, boasting a gentler but no less immediate vision that seemed to suggest that the musical possibilities in the decade to follow would be endless. All of this came after 10 previous years of painful noise, bad punk, hilarious song titles, pointless screams, and occasionally unmatched rock power. You couldn’t pin this band down.\n\nNotable reviews: Super Roots 6/7/8 (1996-1999); Vision Creation Newsun (1999)\n\nFurther reading: “Resonant Frequency: Heaven Sounding Sweeter” (2006)\n\nBrittany Howard (Alabama Shakes)\n\nWith the Alabama Shakes, Brittany Howard broke out as an electrifying songwriter and frontperson, setting a new standard for what rock music could be in the new millennium. In 2019, Howard’s solo debut Jaime—named for her late sister—delivered a warm mix of roots-rock, R&B, and soul that stared down a tumultuous political era with determination and empathy. As Jill Mapes wrote in a profile around that record:\n\nBrittany Howard thought about calling the album Black Björk. What the two composers share, besides their big-scale visions and hurricane voices, is a deep desire for their rightful due. After the Alabama Shakes’ second album, Sound & Color, captured a far more ambitious, almost-Afrofuturistic side of Howard’s songwriting compared to their debut, she got used to people wrongly assuming that Blake Mills, the band’s co-producer, must have written the songs. “Now I have to be adamant about what I did,” she says. “So I’ll just say that I’m very excited, as a woman in 2019, to have produced this record.”\n\nThe album’s most affecting moments occur when Howard reconciles the hate she sees in the world with her own commitment to hope. Written in response to Prince’s death, Trump’s election, and “the whole fucking world seeming depressed,” “13th Century Metal” feels like the spiritual centerpiece of Jaime*—an intergalactic journey of a jam session. Howard speaks sermon-like affirmations with steadfast wisdom, an almost enthusiastic fury, and yeah, a little* all we need is love. “I am a master student and my spirit...” she hollers, pausing dramatically before declaring, “will never be stomped out!”\n\nNotable reviews: Boys & Girls (2012), Sound & Color (2015), Jaime (2019)\n\nBroadcast\n\nBetween Broadcast’s debut in 1996 and cofounder Trish Keenan’s death in 2011, the UK group steadily developed their own sound world, cobbling bits and pieces from ’60s easy-listening pop, early electronic music, and avant-garde film soundtracks into recordings that felt like spectral emanations from another world. As Jess Harvell wrote in the days after Keenan’s passing:\n\nIn the mid ’90s, Broadcast were tagged as a clever genre-mixing, record-collecting retro act in an era not short on clever genre-mixing, record-collecting retro acts. But there was something deeper and odder going on in their music. Though Trish Keenan’s singing was always clear and lovely, in many ways pure indie pop, the band was neither cuddly nor sleek. And they had little to do with the retail-friendly post-Portishead brigade or the soporific surface-level “cool” of any lounge-pop revivalists. If anything they were far closer to Warp labelmates Boards of Canada, another group using wobbly, sometimes even grimy electronics to evoke the unreality of the everyday, the loveliness of supposedly artificial sound, the supernatural qualities of circuit-based music. Broadcast were tapping into older, more obscure, and often darker strains of American, European, but mostly British music: The psychedelic side of early synth music, the eeriness of old electronic TV and film soundtracks, the spooky suburban fairy tale vibe conjured by certain twee and industrial bands. True, there was plenty of Stereolab-ish kraut-pulse and ’90s beat culture and even sunny Bacharach-isms in their musical DNA, but Broadcast were never so easily reducible to one trend or another.\n\nFurther reading: “Afterword: Broadcast’s Trish Keenan” (2011)\n\nBroken Social Scene\n\nFormed around the core duo of Kevin Drew and Brendan Canning, Broken Social Scene stood at the epicenter of Toronto’s thriving indie rock scene throughout the 2000s. The thrillingly grandiose ensemble includes members of other outfits like Feist, Metric, and Stars, but they’ve always achieved a special alchemy when together as a collective. As Ryan Schreiber wrote in a 2003 review of their breakout album You Forgot It in People:\n\nI’ve been listening to this disc for months on repeat—sometimes just this disc for days—but it wasn’t until I began doing research for this review that it began to make sense how a band like this could materialize from out of nowhere with such a powerful and affecting album. I knew from the liners that the group has 10 members (15 if you include guests); what I didn’t know was that all of them have been wandering from band to band within the wildly experimental Toronto music scene for years, or that they all came together from groups like Stars, Do Make Say Think, Treble Charger, A Silver Mt. Zion, and Mascott with the unified goal of making, of all things, pop music. One of its members told a Toronto weekly that “we’d already made our art-house albums... the whole ideology of trying to write an actual four-minute pop song was completely new to so many of us.” Who could have imagined it would come so easily? You Forgot It in People explodes with song after song of endlessly replayable, perfect pop.\n\nBurna Boy\n\nBurna Boy was born Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, the grandson of a one-time manager of Fela Kuti, and he carries the mantle of that icon of African music. Burna dubs his own style “Afro-fusion”: a mixture of sounds from the continent along with global strains of hip-hop, EDM, and pop. In an era where correcting historical injustice feels more urgent than ever, Burna Boy’s all-encompassing, pan-Africanist style is helping to rectify deep-seated imbalances of power and representation. Reviewing his 2020 album Twice as Tall, Mankaprr Conteh wrote:\n\nAs a child, Damini Ebunoluwa Ogulu was fascinated by superhero comics. He wanted to be his own superhero, so he named himself Burna Boy, a moniker that has followed him into a career as one of the defining musical acts of today’s African diaspora. After his fourth studio album, African Giant, permeated the summer from Abuja to Brooklyn, and he sold out London’s Wembley Arena, Burna returns with Twice as Tall, a more resonant origin story that explains his ascent. In an accompanying motion comic, the Yoruba deity Orunmila chooses Burna to embody his “secret flame.” With it, Burna is challenged to restore the gods’ faith in humanity. He meets these Black gods again, in 2020, his mission completed through his resounding success. “You make music passionately, like you are waging a war,” one tells him, proudly.\n\nTwice as Tall is Burna’s battle cry. Compared to some of his previous work, it can feel heavy under the weight of Burna’s personal reflection and Pan-African crusade. His newly moody Afro-fusion amplifies his passion. Twice as Tall could’ve aimed to crystalize Burna’s position as a global Afropop star with easier, feel-good hits. Instead, he turns starkly inward, assuring himself of his power, and outward, reminding the world of its failures and its potential. It is a load worth carrying.\n\nFurther reading: “Afrobeats’ Global Takeover” (2020)\n\nCam’ron\n\nDuring the commercial rap surge of the late ’90s, Cam’ron emerged as the de facto ambassador of Harlem rap, bringing as much pomp to his rhymes as technical skill. The Dipset leader’s uniquely choppy flow is easily mockable and yet unimpeachable. As Tom Breihan broke it down in 2005:\n\nHis bored, arrogant voice rolls syllables around until he’s hit just about every possible permutation, transforming hard consonants into thrown rocks and idly toying with drug metaphors like they’re Rubik’s Cubes. In Cam’s world, he’s the king of Harlem, moving kilos, dispatching foes, and throwing around money with Machiavellian cool. Cam has the warped eloquence of an MF DOOM even when he’s bragging about violence (“Observe, cock, and spray/ We hit you from a block away/ Drinking saki on a Suzuk/ We on Osaka Bay”) or conspicuous consumption (“So I parked in the towaway zone, chrome/ I don’t care; that car a throwaway, homes”).\n\nCardi B\n\nEver since she burst onto the scene with “Bodak Yellow” in 2017, Cardi B has been unstoppable. No matter the platform—social media, television, or pop music—the Bronx star has dominated the cultural conversation with her distinctive voice, wit, and unfiltered candor. As Sheldon Pearce wrote of Cardi’s debut album Invasion of Privacy in 2018:\n\nCardi is a great talker, but her voice itself is its own instrument. It wraps around each word; her accent and inflections forge each syllable into a snap, making every utterance feel novel. She wields her voice like a weapon, and she can make even the mundane seem glamorous with a particularly choice phrasing. This specific economy of language is the core of her appeal, and every verse is imbued with its impact. Some punchlines are laugh-out-loud funny, others are immensely clever. A few are both.\n\nNotable reviews: Invasion of Privacy (2018)\n\nCaribou\n\nIn the early years of the 21st century, Ontario native Dan Snaith released a pair of intricately pieced-together IDM albums as Manitoba before adopting the name Caribou and flooding his music with psychedelic textures and luminous vocal melodies. Since then, he has flirted with more stripped-down styles of dance music (particularly under his Daphni alias) and explored both maximalism and minimalism, never veering too far away from his guiding pop instincts. Jamieson Cox wrote of his 2014 album Our Love:\n\nDan Snaith spent the first decade of his career attacking a wide range of genres with the intensity of an autodidact and the cerebral coolness of an academic. Back when he was still recording as Manitoba without fear of legal challenges from disgruntled punk veterans, he disassembled the IDM of the late ’90s and early ’00s before moving on to kaleidoscopic, colorful psychedelia. From there, it was on to chugging krautrock and rich, melancholy ’60s pop and the sounds of deep house and contemporary club music. Despite hopping from style to style, his music is always marked by an essential playfulness and engrossing curiosity.\n\nFurther reading: “5-10-15-20: Caribou” (2014)\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen\n\nA former Canadian Idol runner-up, Carly Rae Jepsen topped the charts in 2012 with the featherlight pop of “Call Me Maybe,” from her sophomore album, Kiss. Working alongside indie producers like Blood Orange and Rostam, she then expertly pivoted to an entire album of ’80s-inspired electro-pop yearning, E•MO•TION. She’s nurtured a cult following that has only grown since. As Anna Gaca wrote in her review of 2019’s Dedicated:\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen ties up bright, ribbony pop songs with the magnetism of a person who’s a little too modest to be a pop star. She goes for the big feelings, and as a result, inspires near-rapturous devotion. Jepsen’s most ardent fans feel called to defend her, to arm her with a sword, to catalyze the moment that will reveal her magic beyond doubt. With 2015’s E•MO•TION, they nearly had it. Dedicated, Jepsen’s fourth full-length album, returns to her signature combination of self-aware innocence and mature restraint. She’s doing what she does best, calibrating lovesick or lovelorn synthpop that’s neither too hot nor too cold.\n\nNotable reviews: E•MO•TION (2015), Dedicated (2019)\n\nCaroline Polachek (Chairlift)\n\nWhen fronting Chairlift, Caroline Polachek used her crystalline voice in service of smart and infectious electro-pop, but her range became more apparent when she went solo. Under the name CEP, she created an album of beguiling ambient pieces, and in 2019 she partnered with Danny Harle of PC Music for an album of future-facing pop with a neo-classical tinge. She’s a musically omnivorous shapeshifter who thrives in porous borders—the space between indie and mainstream, or where soundscapes bleed into song. As Katherine St. Asaph wrote in a review of 2019’s Pang:\n\nSometimes Pang sounds so sweeping it’s almost symphonic; the first few notes of “The Gate” almost sound like a synthetic orchestra tuning up. It’s a PR cliché to tout artists’ “classical training,” which can mean anything from actual classical training to a semester of voice lessons in college, but in her work, you genuinely can hear it. She’s mentioned writing melodies as wordless stretches of singing—she calls it “applesaucing.” For most of the decade, she’s taken classical voice lessons, specifically in baroque singing. This comes out not just in the soaring, near-operatic vocalizations throughout Pang, but in the crisp way she attacks words and syllables, the controlled vocal leaps, and precise staccato.\n\nCat Power\n\nChan Marshall got her start in the mid ’90s making stripped-down folk rock infused with the blues. But over the years she has strayed from that analog naturalism into more fantastic, more unexpected worlds—collaborations with Memphis soul musicians and French house producer Philippe Zdar; soundtracks for Karl Lagerfeld and covers of James Brown and Liza Minelli—dreamily arrayed around her smoky husk of a voice. In her 2012 profile “All This Light,” Amanda Petrusich wrote:\n\nIt feels corny and reductive to declare Chan Marshall “of another era,” yet my understanding of how she believes songs work—that they are channeled into existence by a handful of conduits, but in fact they belong to everyone, like a mountain or a river or an old forest—makes her seem innately better suited to a place like Nashville circa 1952, or maybe the Mississippi Delta in 1927, when almost all art was considered public domain, verses floated gently, and creativity was about interpretation rather than invention. On 1998’s Moon Pix, notice the way she sings a tiny bit of “Amazing Grace” in the middle of “Metal Heart,” or the nicked/decelerated/reversed “Paul Revere” sample that opens “American Flag.” She is not interested in ownership, not in the broadest sense.\n\nThere’s also her voice, which is effortless in a way that recalls a period before aggressively mustered melisma, when people sang because it felt good and necessary, like a long stretch. It’s conventionally pretty—honeyed and subtly textured—and so instinctive it makes me feel actual envy, like I will never do anything with as much intrinsic ease as Chan Marshall exhibits when she sings. That’s how she’s able to take a track as proverbial as “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction,” which opens 2000’s The Covers Record, and turn it into something unrecognizable; she eschews the song’s chorus (that dumb, galloping declaration: the ur-chorus), purposefully forgoing the obvious for the odd. Or is it obvious, not singing the chorus of a song like that? It’s hard to know what Marshall’s move is, when nothing feels like a move at all.\n\nNotable reviews: Moon Pix (1998),The Greatest (2006), Sun (2012)\n\nChance the Rapper\n\nChance the Rapper turned a high school suspension into an independent empire. He never signed a deal but surpassed the fame and accolades of most of his major-label peers, becoming someone notable enough to be (regrettably) praised by Trump. And he did it all off the power of the mixtape, bringing lighthearted energy to 10 Day, Acid Rap, and even the star-studded Coloring Book. As Sheldon Pearce wrote in 2016:\n\nChance hasn’t revolutionized the mixtape, but he’s stumped heavily for the format, including seeking to legitimize it with Grammys. His commitment is endearing, reiterating that music is a labor of love and not a tool of commerce, and Coloring Book is his grandest gesture. “Am I the only n---a still care about mixtapes?” he asked rhetorically (“Mixtape”). Alongside Wayne and Young Thug, he made a case for the transformative power of the medium, making his songs for free and also for freedom.\n\nCharli XCX\n\nSince she started posting songs on Myspace in 2008, Charli XCX has turned into both a pop star and a true pop connoisseur, always ahead of the curve instead of chasing trends. Her most fascinating work has been as a willfully irreverent solo artist, from the moody synth-pop of True Romance to hyper-catchy PC Music collaborations on Pop 2 to lockdown-era intimacy on how i’m feeling now. On Pop 2’s stunning finale “Track 10,” she’s a melancholy cyborg spreading the gospel of hyperpop, as if she’s receiving alien transmissions from the future. In a 2019 cover story profile set in a spa, Bobby Finger wrote:\n\nSitting cross-legged at a table in the spa’s Korean cafe, Charli reveals a part of herself that complicates her reputation as an enigmatic pop star whose life consists of only two things: partying and making music about partying. “I’m really a workaholic,” she tells me. “To a level that’s not cool.” She appears genuinely troubled by her compulsion towards the many jobs that comprise her career in the music industry—singer, songwriter, performer, producer, video director—and says that she has thought of joining a 12-step program like Workaholics Anonymous to help manage it.\n\nThat steadfast commitment to being a font of exuberant pop joyrides is as much a product of her own talent as it is a paradoxical act of self-care. When she’s working, she says, her mind isn’t spiraling. The sheer act of releasing and performing music prevents her from worrying about whether or not she’s doing it right. And by constantly moving ahead for nearly a decade, Charli has fine-tuned her sensibilities and settled into what has become an instantly recognizable sound: a sentient circuit board’s interpretation of dance-pop.\n\nChief Keef\n\nIn early 2012, Chief Keef was pumping out violent, rugged, emotionally complex music while on house arrest in his grandmother’s Chicago home. Within months he would take drill music from a local movement to a nationwide phenomenon, helping to birth the most important rap subgenre of the decade. By the end of 2012 he had released a major label album, Finally Rich, though he would soon go back underground and take his sound to unexpected—and decidedly strange—new places. As David Drake wrote in his 2014 review of Keef’s Back From the Dead 2 mixtape:\n\nListening now to Finally Rich, Chief Keef’s capstone 2012 release and only album with Interscope, it’s striking how easily the hits seemed to come to the then-17-year-old star. Even its unheralded album tracks hit a sweet spot of purposeful insouciance that promised a career in the spotlight. With songs selected and sequenced largely by producer Young Chop, Finally Rich is a creative success (if only a modest commercial one) because it sells Chief Keef as a hitmaker. In the pre-internet industry, perhaps that’s just what he would be. But today his interests lie elsewhere, and his path since has been a defiant refutation of any direction but his own.\n\nChristine and the Queens\n\nAround 2010, Héloïse Letissier invented her alter ego, Christine, “as a survival technique,” as she told Pitchfork a few years ago. Finding herself at a rough place in her life, she had abandoned Paris for London, where she fell in with a group of drag queens who taught her to reinvent herself. Her 2014 debut album, the spare, electro-pop Chaleur Humaine (later reissued in English as Christine and the Queens), was the fruit of that transformation, and in 2018, she followed it up with Chris, a hot-blooded pop-funk record about yet another alter ego. Throughout her transformations, her work has maintained an unflinching focus on themes of identity, vulnerability, strength, and desire. In 2015, Laura Snapes wrote of Letissier’s debut:\n\nChristine and the Queens is a beautiful, important negotiation of liminal states at a time when the media is quick to bandy about the term “post-gender,” as if the hard work is done. Her music is bold and fully formed, but Letissier unpeels the façade of outer confidence to shine a light on the way that queer identity requires constant negotiation, to deal with the world’s often unforgiving gaze and the one that can come from within—on “Safe and Holy,” she admits that her own eyes “mock and judge” her. It’s empowering, bold, and vulnerable, and made for dancing. Chaleur Humaine translates as “human warmth,” and the album makes good on that intimacy. You get the sense of Letissier guarding her own precious, burgeoning fire, and inviting listeners to share in its glow.\n\nClams Casino\n\nIn the early 2010s, New Jersey producer Michael Volpe’s woozy, warped beats helped define cloud rap—a seemingly niche combination of pillowy textures and hard-hitting drums that became an enduring influence on producers and artists in the underground and mainstream alike. Perhaps no song exemplifies the sound better than Lil B’s “I’m God,” with a Clams Casino beat that mangled an Imogen Heap sample almost beyond recognition. Though much of Volpe’s exemplary work was on mixtapes or EPs rather than official albums, his legacy lives on in emo-rap and beyond. As Nadine Smith wrote in a review of 2020’s Instrumental Relics:\n\n“Cloud rap” has been so absorbed into hip-hop’s identity that it’s hard to remember when it was subversive and new. The title of the latest installment in Clams Casino’s long-running beat-tape series implies that the tracks have been scavenged and preserved, like fading artifacts of a forgotten epoch. Michael Volpe wasn’t the only producer weaving ambient textures into trap beats at the start of the last decade—an era where experimental artists like Shlohmo and Evian Christ collaborated with the likes of Kanye and Drake—but few artists were linked as closely with the subgenre.\n\nClams’ influence on hip-hop has remained at the elemental level; his work with rappers like Lil B, A$AP Rocky, and Soulja Boy truly shifted the sonic window. Without Clams, it’s hard to imagine Yung Lean or Drain Gang, and rap’s ongoing infatuations with the alternative rock spectrum might not be so passionate either. He was out there sampling Thursday in 2011, and now he works alongside a new generation who would probably not be making music without his influence: Lil Peep, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Ghostemane, and Nedarb, who credits “I’m God” as the beat that made him want to start producing.\n\nFurther reading: “Rising: Clams Casino” (2011)\n\nConor Oberst (Bright Eyes)\n\nAs he evolved from Omaha, Nebraska’s teenage emo wunderkind into one of America’s most respected songwriters, gracefully fulfilling the “New Dylan” role that early critics placed on him, Conor Oberst remained in constant motion. From his early lo-fi masterpieces under the moniker Bright Eyes to the folk-leaning solo work he’s released under his own name, his long career has set a benchmark for how to evolve while maintaining your integrity as an indie artist in the 21st century. As Ian Cohen wrote in a review of a reissue of 2000’s Fevers and Mirrors:\n\nSo is Fevers and Mirrors the best Bright Eyes record? Some days I think it is, but the important thing is that Oberst gives you options, and just about everything he’s done since—even the hamfisted political punk of Desaparecidos and the misguided democracy of the Mystic Valley Band—is at the very least an attempt not to repeat himself. He’s become oddly undervalued even if I doubt whether he has another masterpiece in him. Depending on my mood, I prefer the monomaniacal scale of Lifted or the electro-goth narcosis of Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, and I get what others see in I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning, a record I find to be highly overrated on account of its playing by someone else’s rules for once—it was there where Oberst really attempted to be the “next Dylan” or “next Gram Parsons” rather than the only Conor Oberst. Which is exactly what we got on Fevers and Mirrors, a record steeped in roots, yet wholly of the moment, intelligent but prone to indefensible emotion, a very personal work made amongst talented friends. Most people discover Fevers and Mirrors at a time when they’re being bombarded with the canon, and the recognition of something that feels utterly yours instead of received wisdom created a true cult of admirers and imitations who had the same white-light experience as myself: When I first heard Fevers and Mirrors, it sounded exactly like the kind of music I’d want to make. Thankfully, Bright Eyes did it, so I didn’t have to.\n\nFurther reading: “The Music That Made Conor Oberst” (2020)\n\nDamon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz, the Good, the Bad, & the Queen)\n\nWith Britpop shapeshifters Blur, “virtual” hip-hop group Gorillaz, and on his own—not to mention a host of other projects, such as the Good, the Bad, & the Queen, DRC Music, and Africa Express—Damon Albarn has amassed a 30-year discography like few others. It’s a wonder that the same lead singer behind Blur’s art-rock pinnacle, 1999’s 13, was soon afterward brushing shoulders with Del the Funky Homosapien (on 2001’s Gorillaz) and De La Soul (among many others, on 2005’s Demon Days)—and continuing to break new ground. Once associated with his arch examinations of Britishness, in recent decades Albarn has ardently championed sounds and artists from elsewhere around the world, from China to Kinshasa. In a 2012 review of the comprehensive Blur 21 box set, Lindsay Zoladz wrote:\n\nChoose Damon. Choose Graham. Choose Damien Hirst’s cheekily agit-pop country house or Sophie Muller’s teen-spirit-stinking squat. Go pop, then spend a decade slowly deflating; study the songbook so you can tear it up with precision. Choose irony, choose sincerity. Choose your own worst NME: a Gallagher, any Gallagher, or maybe just yourself (“Do you feel like a chain store? Practically floored?”). Choose fame, or flee from it fast as you can in a milkman's suit. Choose Ray Davies, choose Stephen Malkmus; choose la-la-la or wooo-hoo. (And before you answer this next one know that the Queen is watching.) Choose Britain. Choose America.\n\nOr, you know, don’t choose. Blur have been a band for 21 years, and their story is long enough to speak a bunch of contradictions. That’s what happens to bands that house four egos and a pair of dueling geniuses. They rarely move in straight lines. One example of many: In 1994, Damon Albarn wrote a snide little number about the cultural allure of the West (sneeringly: “La-la-la-la-la/He'd like to live in Magic America/With all the magic people”). Three years on, he was a bit more forgiving (one more time, with earnestness: “Look inside America/She’s all right/She’s all right”). It’s not despite but because of these pivots and complexities that it feels appropriate to call Blur a defining band of the past two decades.\n\nNotable reviews: Blur: Parklife (1994), Gorillaz: Plastic Beach (2010), Everyday Robots (2014)\n\nFurther reading: “Interview: Damon Albarn” (2014), “The 50 Best Britpop Albums” (2017)\n\nDanny Brown\n\nDetroit’s most outlandish and excitable MC has always been brimming with talent, but it took the rest of the industry a few years to catch up. Wielding one of the rap game’s most distinctive voices, Brown matches Eminem’s penchant for shock and taboo with an infectious personality, all while redefining what a street rapper looks like and pushing the art form forward. As Jayson Greene wrote in a review of 2019’s uknowhatimsayin¿:\n\nDanny Brown’s breakout album came the year he turned 30. Now that he’s closing in on 40, he doesn’t seem to be settling into an elder-statesman role; judging by his new album uknowhatimsayin¿, he hasn’t settled at all. “Never look back, I will never change up,” he chants repeatedly on the first song—a vow to never let a groove become a rut, to stay the same without repeating yourself. It’s a lonely sort of promise, but it’s one that he’s kept: He remains as defiantly hard to situate now in the rap landscape today as he was in 2011.\n\nBack then, he was ostentatiously weird, a gap-toothed Detroit rapper with a hyena voice who forever altered the smell and taste of Cool Ranch Doritos, a weirdo fashion plate back when something as mild as skinny jeans could cost you a label deal. Now that he looks like an original X-Man to SoundCloud rap’s New Mutants, he’s still an outlier: His devotion to punchlines and similes makes him sound almost rigid in the melted, borderless landscape of current rap. But this is the joy and pain of being a three-dimensional human in your records, over and over again; if you do it correctly, you’ll never quite fit in anywhere, ever.\n\nNotable reviews: XXX (2011); Old (2013); Atrocity Exhibition (2016); uknowhatimsayin¿ (2019)\n\nDavid Berman (Silver Jews, Purple Mountains)\n\nLike a brown bird nesting in a Texaco sign, David Berman had a point of view. Two years on, it’s still hard to come to grips with the fact that he’s no longer with us. If you connected with his loose and shaggy music in Silver Jews and Purple Mountains, his startling and often hilarious lyrics taught you the joy of noticing things and that sadness can be transformed into something beautiful. As Mark Richardson wrote following Berman’s passing:\n\nHe had a gift for writing that, ironically, and in a very Berman-esque way, is hard to talk about. His use of language is so specific, it’s hard to find some of your own to describe it in a way that doesn’t diminish what you’re trying to convey. “The meaning of the world lies outside the world” is how he put a related idea, in another context, in his song “People.” But the way I’m describing it now makes it sound like something heady and tangled and complicated. It was the opposite. Berman had a knack for representing what was right in front of you in a way that made you see it as if for the first time.\n\nDeafheaven\n\nLike other black metal bands, San Francisco’s Deafheaven attempt to channel soul-scouring catharsis in great, surging waves of sound; unlike most of their peers, they fuse the genre’s blast beats, guitar solos, and larynx-shredding vocals with the unabashedly atmospheric sounds of shoegaze and post-rock. As Jayson Greene wrote in his review of 2015’s New Bermuda:\n\nNothing about the band Deafheaven makes literal sense, starting with their place in the world. They are a black metal-ish band, but black metal fans either hate them or engage in constant, spirited discussions about why they don’t. Their breakout, 2013’s Sunbather, took basic notions about black metal and shoegaze from their first album, Roads to Judah, and airlifted them into a rarefied emotional realm where track lengths dissolved into the whole along with straightforward interpretations: George Clarke’s lyrics compressed earthbound experiences—depression, material envy, struggles for purpose—into wild, leaping abstractions about love, oceans of light, tears. This was music that yearned palpably to leap across distances, closing gaps like a firing synapse.\n\nNew Bermuda, if anything, is more overwhelming than Sunbather. The roiling peaks of that album are the resting temperature of this one. They have shaped a suite of songs into one pliable and massive 47-minute arc that is as easy to separate into distinct quadrants as the stream from a fire hydrant. Clarke still screams euphoniously, leaning into long vowel sounds and open tones so that phrases like “on the smokey tin it melts again and again” function as color more than as thought. (You could never discern the words without the aid of a lyric sheet, anyway.)\n\nDeath Grips\n\nHailing from Sacramento, the provocative experimental trio of MC Ride, Zach Hill, and Andy Morin made waves with their 2011 mixtape Exmilitary, which fused intense noise and Hill’s startling drumwork with Ride’s urgent screams. Over the next decade, the group released albums at a remarkable clip, provoking both intrigue and confusion. As Zoe Camp wrote in a review of 2016’s Bottomless Pit:\n\nThe experimental band Negativland introduced the concept of “culture jamming” to the world in 1984, defining it as “an awareness of how the media environment we occupy affects and directs our inner life” … [Death Grips’] Zach Hill, Andy Morin, and Stefan Burnett (otherwise known as MC Ride) are easily the most talented, impactful culture jammers of the streaming age: a distinction primarily owed to just how seriously the California trio take those ideas. Never mind the Trojan Horse they pulled on Epic, the deep web album leaks, the no-shows—the real subversion’s in Death Grips’ music, which continues to draw huge audiences (see: the massive crowd who filled the Gobi tent for their headlining Coachella set) and unsurprisingly, co-signs from fellow pranksters like Tyler, the Creator and Eric André. It’s no surprise that the loudest contingency of their fanbase resides on an infamous image-board; Death Grips speak directly to the dark worldview that accompanies years wasted lurking online, getting high off digital schadenfreude. (Been there.)\n\nDeerhunter\n\nDeerhunter has a lot going for them musically—classically dark 4AD atmosphere, streaks of psychedelia, Bradford Cox’s narcoleptic sigh—but the band’s greatest accomplishment has been articulating a blown-out state of mind: beaten down and haunted by memory but with an eye for beauty and a kernel of hope. They make music about the desire to be alone but present it with such brilliant catharsis that you can’t help but want to hear it in a loud room surrounded by strangers. As Marc Hogan wrote in his review of 2010’s Halcyon Digest:\n\nDeerhunter unveiled their new album by asking fans to print out a vintage DIY-style poster, photocopy it, and tape it up all over town. In the last couple of weeks, band members have participated in all-night online chats with some of their most devoted fans. We’ll never be able to parse every lyric or tease out every technical intricacy—though somebody will probably try—but that is what Halcyon Digest is all about: nostalgia not for an era, not for antiquated technology, but for a feeling of excitement, of connection, of that dumb obsession that makes life worth living no matter how horrible it gets. And then sharing that feeling with somebody else who’ll start the cycle all over again.\n\nDev Hynes (Blood Orange)\n\nDevonté Hynes’ elegant pop-R&B nods to the ’80s and ’90s, with springing beats and wistful melodies that made him a go-to producer for pop stars and Oscar-nominated filmmakers alike. As Blood Orange, Hynes curates a wide net of guest stars—from Debbie Harry to Diddy—to add detail to deeply felt, collage-like albums that blend politics and Hynes’ nostalgia into one. As Jason King wrote as part of an interview story in 2016:\n\nAs a producer and songwriter, Hynes draws on an astonishingly rich archive made up of wildly diverse and sometimes forgotten sounds and styles of the past; it’s all in service of a contemporary, chilled-out, ethereal, fusion pop that we might call The Dev Hynes Sound. Along the way, his eccentric musical and visual choices have made him a unique emblem of destabilized, fluid expressions of gender, sexuality, and race. He’s an exquisite tastemaker who has somehow managed to find a way to feel free enough to pursue the volcanic, hyper-associative ideas in his head and his heart, no matter the personal cost or industry implications.\n\nDiplo\n\nIn the early ‘00s, when Thomas Wesley Pentz first began making mash-ups and mixes and throwing his Philadelphia-based Hollertronix parties with Low Budget, hip club kids looked to him as a surveyor of the global beat music underground. Diplo earned his cred via early collaborations with M.I.A. and Santigold, and his championing of the Brazilian baile funk scene, but he soon became the man to capitalize on anything mainstream American dance music didn't have a stronghold on. Successes with his group Major Lazer, as well as Jack Ü, his duo with Skrillex, helped Diplo land writing credits with Beyonce and Bieber, ultimately turning him into a Vegas residency/bottle-service club/EDM bubble celeb. Allegations of misconduct may yet eclipse his legacy, but Diplo’s adventurous ear helped define the wide-open sound of club music in the digital age. As Nate Patrin wrote in a review of Major Lazer’s 2013 album Free the Universe:\n\nFor the longest time, Diplo’s role as a producer has been steeped in importing, curating, and reconfiguring global dance sounds from favelas to shantytowns to the projects. That approach has been depicted as everything from transcendent, no-borders futurism to an exploitative colonialist ripoff, but most of his fans seem most interested in how much a given track bumps.
