        "text": "1922 Seeking better economic conditions, the Goldstein family moves to Los Angeles. There, Louis Goldstein, who had been a train engineer in Russia, is only able to find work as a junkman. In 1923, following a deep depression, Louis Goldstein commits suicide. It is 10-year old Phillip who finds him dead, hanging from a rafter in a shed.\n\n1925-26 Encouraged by his mother, Guston begins to draw at home, copying cartoon strips from newspapers and retreating into a closet lit by a single bulb hanging from the ceiling. Late in life Guston recalled: \"As a boy I would hide in the closet when the older brothers and sisters came with their families to Mama's apartment for the Sunday afternoon dinner visit. I felt safe. Hearing their talk about illnesses, marriages, and the problems of making a living, I felt my remoteness in the closet with the single light bulb. I read and drew in this private box. Some Sundays I even painted. I had given my dear Mama passionate instructions to lie.... 'Where is Phillip?' I could hear them.... 'Oh, he is away, with friends' I was happy in my sanctuary.... After a lifetime, I still have never been able to escape.... It is still a struggle to be hidden and feel strange, my favorite mood.\"\n\n1947\n\nThe Porch II, 1947-48\n\nMunson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute Museum of Art, Utica, New York, Museum Purchase\n\nA Guggenheim fellowship allows Guston to take a leave of absence from his teaching position. Despite all the acclaim his work has received, he is feeling increasingly dissatisfied. He moves his family back to upstate New York. \"Guston's withdrawal to Woodstock accelerated his descent,\" wrote Dore Ashton. \"No amount of reassurance from the outside world could dispel his suffocating sense of insufficiency during the next couple of years.\" He finds new friendship with painter Bradley Walker Tomlin, and writer Robert Phelps and his wife, painter Rosemarie Beck. As Phelps recalled, \"We knew just about every movie house in the Hudson Valley.\"\n\nGuston completes a series of works that culminate in The Porch II, begun in St. Louis. \"This was after the films of the concentration camps started coming back, the photos and stories,\" he said. \"I think I consciously thought of them not as children, but also as lost, agonized beings. All these figures are compressed, as if the chairs and legs and columns and horns and so on all become flat like paper pressed against each other.\"\n\nWith the completion of the almost wholly abstract The Tormentors in early 1948, Guston's inner conflicts make painting impossible. \"I felt I'd reached the end of this preoccupation,\" he later said. \"Then followed a year of destroying everything. Everything seemed unsuccessful to me, and I couldn't continue figuration. The forms I wanted to make couldn't take the shapes of things and figures... I felt that I had to drop figuration and let it go, and it was a very lengthy struggle to do that. I felt torn between conflicting loyalties... I mean the loyalty to my own past and the other loyalty to what you might still to do, or what you might still become, which is, of course, still unknown.\"\n\nThe Tormentors, 1947-1948\n\nCollection SFMOMA, Gift of the artist\n\nAbstraction 1950-59\n\nEllen Auerbach © The Estate of Ellen Auerbach, Akedmie der Künste, Berlin, courtesy Robert Mann Gallery, New York\n\nGuston’s long depression begins to lift when he takes a studio on 10th Street in New York, making regular visits to the Cedar Tavern and The Club, at 39 East 8th Street, where the artists are congregating. He begins drawing and painting again, but in a new way.\n\nWhite Painting, 1952\n\nCollection SFMOMA, T. B. Walker Foundation Fund purchase\n\n\"I wanted to see if I could paint a picture -have a run, so to speak -without stepping back and looking at the canvas and to be willing to accept what happened, to suspend criticism. Instead of walking back, pulling out a cigarette and thinking, to not suspend my own endeavors, but to test myself, to see if my sense of structure was inherent. I would stand in front of the surface and simply keep on painting for three or four hours. I began to see that when I did that, I didn't lose structure at all.\"\n\nGuston was not alone in exploring this way of working. A climate of radical invention and ferment was alive in New York at this time. Artists as diverse and individual in their work as Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottleib, David Smith, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Hans Hofmann, Franz Kline, Guston and others were later known as the New York School or as Abstract Expressionists-- terms rejected by Guston, who later exclaimed, “what do they think, that we’re all on the same baseball team?”\n\nYet their studios and galleries were clustered on Tenth Street. Many evenings they met to discuss ideas at The Club and to talk and drink far into the night at the Cedar Tavern.\n\n© Arthur Swoger Photography Collection\n\nGuston with Mercedes Matter and Willem de Kooning, at the Cedar Bar. Behind them sit Frank O’Hara and Elaine de Kooning.\n\nArt as an explicit agent of social change was over. The left had collapsed. The effect of the WPA had been to bring artists together as deserving of support in the post-depression and war years. But during the Truman and Eisenhower era, post-war America at large was indifferent to art.\n\nArtists turned inward, as New Yorker art critic Harold Rosenberg wrote: “Art consisted only of the will to paint and the memory of paintings…the artist’s struggle for identity took hold of the crisis directly, without ideological mediation.” Despite its lack of radical subject matter, what Rosenberg called “action painting…never doubted the radicalism of its intentions or its substance.” Dore Ashton, later Guston’s biographer, observed that these artists were united only by “their common need to denounce all rhetoric and elude all the nets cast by ambitious cataloguers and historians.”\n\nArthur Swoger Photography Collection\n\nA decade later, when British critic David Sylvester reviewed these painters’ work in an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, London, he entitled his review “New York Takeover.” “The main belief they shared was that the painter should function as far as possible without prejudices,” he wrote. “Painting was to be a leap into the unknown through which the artist might hope to arrive at an image that was really his. The only criterion by which that image could be judged was whether it seemed to be ‘authentic,’ ‘valid.’”\n\nAt the time, however, the new paintings emerging from these artists provoked mostly consternation. In writing about Guston’s first show of the new work in the Peridot Gallery in 1952, Time magazine focused on the change in his style, away from figuration, making the same kind of comment that would again plague Guston when he abandoned abstraction years later.\n\nFrom TIME. © 1952 TIME USA LLC.

Over the next year and a half, the exhibition travels to the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam; the Palais des Beaux-Arts, Brussels; the Whitechapel Gallery, London and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.\n\nCriticism of the direction his work has taken over the past several years continues to mount and to feed Guston’s own self-doubt and questioning. “I got into a collapse about it,” Guston later tells an interviewer, “and talked to the director who was doing the show, and cancelled it, as if I had to act out the fear of myself seeing it all together. Because by not seeing it all together, you could still perpetuate to yourself perhaps certain hopes and myths about yourself that you need. After I cancelled it, I thought then that this was some sort of defeat for myself. I wanted then to have it. It would be a greater defeat not to have it than to have it. I thought I better face it. I thought that in having it, exposing it to myself, and in being willing to be judged on your production, your work, that this might be a way I could get rid of it and move on.”\n\nOpening of the Philip Guston retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum, 1962 Photo by Dan Budnik\n\nWith repeated visits to the museum when it is closed on Mondays, Guston recounts that, “I began to regard the Guggenheim as an extension of my own studio....I have a capacity for self-criticism, and it enabled me to move on. I think I became more ruthless with myself in the work following..\"\n\nInstallation view: Phillip Guston, 05/03/1962- 07/01/1962. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Photo: Robert E. Mates\n\nEmily Genauer, critic for The New York Herald Tribune, says she is saddened by the Guggenheim retrospective, “The picture it presents of an immensely gifted artist perpetually frustrated on the one hand by his paucity of ideas, and on the other by his inability to find commitment to formalism sufficient.” Genauer continues to lament the artist’s turn away from figuration more than a decade earlier. “Guston, when he quit representational painting, knew more about the drama and excitement of the forms themselves than many painters ever learn. He failed to develop a new vocabulary of forms as he failed to develop new ideas.”\n\nInstallation view: Phillip Guston, 05/03/1962- 07/01/1962. Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York. Photo: Robert E. Mates\n\nBut it is the deeper response of two poets, Bill Berkson, in Kulchur Magazine, and especially Frank O’Hara, in ARTnews, that seems more prescient, given all that is to come later.\n\nTaking a stand against the “approved” critical formalism of the art taking over the art scene, Berkson quotes Picasso, who had said in 1935: “Nor is there any ‘figurative’ and ‘non-figurative’ art. Everything appears to us in the guise of a ‘figure.’ Even in metaphysics ideas are expressed by means of symbolic ‘figures.’ See how ridiculous it is then to think of painting without ‘figuration.’ “Berkson is able to keenly feel and articulate Guston’s “staggering ambiguities” and “dangerous accuracy, a difficult mixture of painfulness and freshness in worked-over images,” concluding that “Guston has made a lofty, expressive, brilliant and objective art.”\n\nIn a review for ARTnews, entitled “Growth and Guston,” Frank O’Hara describes the “introspective aggressiveness” in Guston’s work. “Through most phases of his work there runs a constant interior, and at the same time very ambitious dialogue with art both past and present.” Unlike most other critics, O’Hara finds the last paintings exhilarating. “The new oils have taken on an even stronger identity, an even more severe bulk of imagery.” In these the poet discovers “summations of feeling painted with an almost luxuriant intensity, compounding textural and formal ambiguities of the ‘finding’ of the painting into images of great certainty and power.” And, in a later passage, “the marvelous burgeoning into life of their surfaces, the visual velocity of the painter’s unerring hand, make of Guston’s self-imposed demands simultaneous triumphs.”\n\n© 2019 The Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, Inc. / Licensed by Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\n\nAt the end of October, the Sidney Janis Gallery opens a space on 57th Street with an exhibition entitled The New Realists. It is the first show of Pop Art in New York, and includes the work of Jim Dine, Robert Indiana, Roy Lichtenstein, Claes Oldenburg, James Rosenquist, George Segal and Andy Warhol. So-called “gestural abstraction”—the new term for Abstract Expressionism—no longer interests the influential critics, who are busy anointing its successors: Pop Art, Color Field painting and Minimalism. In protest against the commitment Janis has made to Pop Art, painters Mark Rothko, Adolph Gottlieb, Philip Guston and Robert Motherwell leave the Sidney Janis Gallery.\n\n1963\n\nIn January, the Guggenheim retrospective travels to the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Whitechapel Gallery, in London, the Palais des Beaux Arts, in Brussels and the Los Angeles County Museum in Los Angeles. “Guston is now in a position in which every move he makes is scrutinized, dissected, and where possible held up to ridicule,” writes Critic John Russell, in The Sunday Times. “This is always an unpleasant position, and it is especially so in the case of one who is essentially a scrupulous and introspective artist. Guston is fighting his way out with pictures which are larger, looser and less obviously fastidious than those which made his name.... The result is a long way from the tender perfections of 1952-53, but, if it wasn’t, Guston would by now be walled up in the history books.”\n\n1964\n\nIn his role as prime art world tastemaker, critic Clement Greenberg curates an influential exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art entitled Post-Painterly Abstraction. According to Greenberg’s dictum, Abstract Expressionism—or Painterly Abstraction, to use his term—has become the equivalent of the decadent Baroque and Mannerist painting in Europe that followed the classicism of the high Renaissance. “Painterly means, among other things, the blurred, broken, loose definition of color and contour,” Greenberg writes in his catalogue essay. “The opposite of painterly is clear, unbroken, and sharp definition.”\n\nOf Guston and his fellow painters in New York, Greenberg writes dismissively, “It turned into a school, then into a manner, and finally into a set of mannerisms.... The most conspicuous of the mannerisms into which Painterly Abstraction has degenerated is what I call the ‘Tenth Street touch’ (after East Tenth Street in New York), which spread through abstract painting like a blight during the 1950s...Its leaders attracted imitators, many of them, and then some of these leaders took to imitating themselves. Painterly Abstraction became a fashion, and now it has fallen out of fashion, to be replaced by another fashion—Pop Art—but also to be continued, as well as replaced, by something as genuinely new and independent as Painterly Abstraction itself was ten or twenty years ago.”\n\nSpeaking to students of this period from a later perspective in the early 1970s, when critics like Greenberg still held the power to determine what was—and was not—acceptable in the world of contemporary art, Guston made clear what he thought of this kind of art criticism:\n\n“I’ve been struck by the fact that because of certain developments in my thinking and painting which have occurred in the last number of years, and the reception to this work, it’s incredible to me how—well, bigoted isn’t the right word—but how doctrinaire the so-called modern movement is. There are certain shibboleths—certain myths exist—which are not at all provable, nor are they necessarily true, you know, like “Painting is flat.” We could make a whole list of things, like: “Do not use an overt subject matter,” “The painting is a concrete object.” I mean, who says so? As if these things are handed down from Mt. Sinai or something! And the original impulse in modern art of the masters, which we enjoy, is so difficult to remember—yet we must remember—is that what was once radical and truly subversive to art, was discovered later to be simply a continuity of art itself. In other words, I am proposing that painting and sculpture must, to continue, be continuously radical and question modern art itself.”\n\n1966\n\nIn this year Guston mounts a large exhibition of his most recent paintings and drawings at the newly renovated Jewish Museum in New York, curated by the director and art historian Sam Hunter. This is the second major exhibition of Guston’s work at a New York museum in four years.\n\nGuston with Sam Hunter, curator of the Jewish Museum exhibition\n\n© Renate Ponsold\n\nIn Yes, But..., a biography published a decade later, Dore Ashton traces the path that Guston was taking at the time of the Jewish Museum show:\n\n“Throughout the period of the gray paintings following the Guggenheim exhibition, Guston worked with increasing momentum, seizing upon whatever means he could to encompass the full range of his feelings. Since his feelings seemed always in a state of emerging, he worked from image to image, trapping now one state of mind, now another. The throbbing, heaving surfaces often mirrored both thought and thing instantaneously, in a way that many viewers found difficult to understand.”\n\n1967\n\nFollowing a painful separation from Musa, his wife of nearly 30 years, and a strained reconciliation after the end of a lengthy affair with a photographer, Guston again finds himself in despair. He has nowhere left to go in his painting, and the forms that have been gathering for nearly a decade are not yet ready to fully declare themselves. Later, of course, these dark, abstract figures and heads will be seen as “prototypes,” to use Dore Ashton’s term, but for this moment, after all the exposure and critical commentary, Guston wants only to withdraw from the art world completely.\n\nGuston in his Florida studio\n\nIn Florida for a winter teaching position at New College in Sarasota, Guston has stopped painting altogether.\n\nAs before, it is drawing that becomes both his refuge and his form of exploration. Over the winter, he makes hundreds of what he later calls “pure” drawings.\n\nThroughout the 1950s and 1960s, one of Guston’s closest confidants and friends has been the composer Morton Feldman. Reminiscing later, Guston later told this story of that year:\n\n“This winter, Feldman was in Texas and I was in Florida, and again I’m going through some kind of changes...I was doing a lot of drawings and I was really distressed. I was down to a line, a couple of lines.\n\nAnd he called from Texas and I said, “Oh, I’m going crazy, I’m down to one line.” He said, “Hold that line. I’ll be right there.” I picked him up at the airport, and all these drawings were on the walls and he didn’t say anything. After dinner we went walking along the seashore in the Florida moonlight. And I said, “What do you think of these new things?”\n\nGuston and Feldman in his Chelsea studio\n\n© Renate Ponsold\n\nAnd he said, “You know, the last trick of Houdini was that he locked himself in a trunk, they threw away the key and then threw the trunk off the Brooklyn Bridge, and he got out.”\n\nAnd then there was a long pause.\n\nWe walked another five minutes and he said, “But you haven’t thrown away the key.”\n\nPaw, 1968\n\n1968\n\n“There are times in one’s life,” Guston shares in a letter to his friend, the poet Bill Berkson. “When you begin all over again, from the beginning. A true turning over.”\n\nThe year 1968 signals a radical change for Guston, a clear break with the gradual evolution of his abstractions of 1950 to 1965. From within the cleansing process of the “pure” drawings, the seeds of figuration begin to grow and flourish. “[It was] about a year and a half of just drawing and this tug-of-war,” Guston explains to students at the Yale Summer Art School at Norfolk a few years later. “I mean, I became very reduced. Some of the drawings are just one or two lines. And then reacting against that, with a very deep desire to paint tangible things. And it began with just the forms around me. I mean, my shoe on the floor. Books. I did lots of shoes and lots of books. Lightbulbs. Just common things around. I wanted to wipe the slate clean. Get rid of ‘Art’.”\n\nUntitled, 1968\n\nPink Book, 1968\n\nUntitled, 1968\n\nDenise Hare © The Estate of Denise Hare\n\nGuston leaves his New York City loft for the solitude of a new cinderblock studio constructed on their Woodstock property, but the doctrinaire dictates of abstraction espoused by the New York critics continue to disturb him. “Who is a painter, after all?” he scribbles in a note to himself. “Man is image-making and painting is image-making. The abstract painters—What are they telling us? That this is absolute? Well, all right, so is this beer glass. But what else is man? There are many things that move him.”\n\nIncreasingly alienated from the New York art scene, Guston visits the City infrequently, although some connections that reflect his values endure. He occasionally gives talks and critiques at the New York Studio School, founded in 1964 by painter Mercedes Matter and her students at Pratt Institute to uphold studio classes at a time when many art schools appear to have abandoned traditional art education. In a 1963 ART news essay entitled “What’s Wrong with U.S. Art Schools?” Matter wrote about the necessity of “that painfully slow education of the senses,” especially through drawing, required for genuine artistic growth.\n\nOver the next several years, Guston lectures on his own creative process as his work continues to evolve at Boston University, pictured above, and at New York Studio School, where art students can still learn the practices Guston has embraced from his early days of drawing from and studying the Old Masters.\n\nAfter quitting the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1962, Guston, and the other Janis artists who also left in protest of the gallery’s new focus on Pop Art, decide to join the newly opened Marlborough-Gerson Gallery in 1964.\n\nIt is there, in 1967, that Guston first meets David McKee, then working for Marlborough, who begins to visit Guston’s studio regularly and is an essential and primary witness to Guston’s transition to figuration. With his wife Renee, David McKee was to become Guston’s exclusive dealer until the McKee Gallery closes in 2015, a span of 41 years.\n\nGuston's new Woodstock studio in winter\n\nWith the financial support of a second Guggenheim fellowship, and the moral support of poet friends like Bill Berkson and Clark Coolidge, who begin to visit him in Woodstock, Guston throws himself into the new imagery in the isolation of his new studio with renewed freedom and excitement. “The feeling of going out of my house, practically naked in just a pajama top, to look at the work of the night before,” he explains to a journalist. “No taxis, no trucks, no buses, no openings, no parties. I found my productivity practically quadrupled.”\n\nThe riots and police brutality at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago in part motivate a return to imagery that had expressed Guston’s outrage as a young man in 1930, when the Ku Klux Klan were visible and active in Los Angeles. David McKee was among the first to see the new paintings: “They were exciting because they reflected so much of what was happening in the world at that time in America, the civil rights disturbances and the marches and the fires and the anger and the disruption of everything. And we would talk about his own early interests in taking a position against social injustice.”\n\nConspirators, 1930\n\nWhen asked to explain his departure from abstraction some years later, Guston offers a further insight into the state of mind that propelled these works: “When the 1960s came along I was feeling split, schizophrenic. The war, what was happening to America, the brutality of the world. Conspirators, 1930 What kind of man am I, sitting at home, reading magazines, going into frustrated fury about everything—and then going into my studio to adjust a red to a blue?\"\n\nWhatever their apparent crudeness, to the hooded figures in the small panels and larger paintings of 1968-1970, Guston brings a more mature and complex reckoning of the sources of evil. These enigmatic hooded figures are more than Ku Klux Klansmen, and certainly more than comics. They call to mind the penitents and flagellants who appear in Christian imagery of the early Renaissance, expiating the sins of humanity. The hoods mask identity as figures in Venetian carnivale, or as the faceless mannequins of Giorgio de Chirico.\n\n\"When I went to Woodstock in 1969, I felt isolated, lonely,” Philip Roth later recounted to Dore Ashton. “Philip knew about solitude and isolation. But he was rather elated. He had this secret in his studio.”\n\nBy the end of 1969, Guston has filled his big new studio with dozens of paintings of the hooded figures in various scenarios. The small works yield to increasingly large canvases.\n\nThe Studio, 1969\n\n“It became apparent that this was a cohesive body of work,” David McKee says, recalling a studio visit. “And I said, ‘you know we’ve got to show these’ and he said, ‘you think so? You think people are going to get it?’ I said, ‘I don’t know, but it’s a wonderful body of work’. To me it was clear that it was a reflection of his sense of social injustice. That’s how I saw it from the very beginning and felt its importance.”\n\n1970\n\nFor the most part, the critical response to the 33 paintings in the October 1970 show at Marlborough Gallery is resoundingly negative. In a scathing review entitled \"A Mandarin Pretending To Be A Stumblebum\", The New\n\nYork Times critic Hilton Kramer denounces Guston’s radical departure as mere posturing on the part of an artist known for being a “colonizer, rather than a pioneer.” Time magazine’s Robert Hughes makes an equally damning argument, rejecting Kramer’s dismissal of the work as mere radical chic. “They are Guston’s authentic response to a personal sense of crisis,” Hughes writes. “The trouble is that painting has become a clumsy way of reporting a society as turbulent and wracked as this.” Some of Guston’s fellow artists are outraged, viewing the new work as embarrassing, a sort of clumsy, cartoonish betrayal of abstraction. But his friend fellow painter Willem de Kooning understands, as Guston recounts it later, saying, “But Phil, it’s all about freedom!”\n\nPerhaps John Perrault, the critic for the Village Voice, expresses it best, in this carefully labelled clipping that Guston’s wife, Musa, saves in her files. Immediately after the Marlborough opening, the Gustons escape to Italy, for a residency at the American Academy in Rome, where after a month or two of restless traveling to see his favorite painters again, Guston gets to work. In his studio at the Academy, he begins a series of oils on paper collectively known as the Roma paintings, in which the hooded figures, while still occasionally present, give way to the timeless beauty of Rome, with its pines and ancient ruins.\n\nThe Two Philips: Guston and Roth, 1972 © Barbara Sproul\n\nInspired by Roth’s excursion into satire, Guston embarks on a feverishly productive two-month drawing spree, during which he completes over 200 ink drawings in two sketchbooks on the life and times of Richard Nixon. The drawings take the form of a narrative running from Nixon’s boyhood to the current plans he and his administration are developing for a rapprochement with “Red China,” as the communist Chinese government was then known. This statesmanlike move Guston perceives as a deeply hypocritical and opportunistic act for a politician who has built his entire legal career on the virulent anti-communism of the McCarthy era.\n\nFrom these drawings, Guston chooses 73, which he collects in book form to tell a story he entitles Poor Richard. Over the next few years, Guston’s writer friends encourage him to submit Poor Richard for publication, but in the end, these extraordinary drawings are not exhibited or published until 2001, 21 years after the artist’s death in 1980.\n\nIn 2018, Philip Guston: Nixon Drawings 1971 &1975, the catalogue of an exhibition of over 200 of these overlooked drawings, wins the coveted FILAF d’Or international prize as the best art book of 2017.\n\n1973\n\nRepeatedly and for the rest of his life, Guston is asked to explain his return to figuration. He is called upon to justify his need to evolve, to explore, to go further, rather than to continue in an approved style. As if to forestall these questions, he begins a 1972 slide talk at the Yale Summer Art School in Norfolk by saying this:\n\n“It’s taken me years to come to the conclusion that probably the only thing one can really learn, the only technique to learn, is the capacity to be able to change. And it’s a very difficult thing. But as modern artists that’s our fate, constant change. I don’t mean novelty or anything like that. What I mean is that this serious play, which we call art, can’t be static. I mean you have to learn how to play in new ways, all the time.”\n\nBut why did he have to abandon the beautiful abstractions of the 1950s? Guston is asked.\n\nVoyage, 1956\n\nCollection Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY. Gift of Seymour H. Knox, Jr., 1957\n\n“What was I going to do—live in that world?” he replied. “I know that world of 1956. I like that painting very much, it’s fine. It’s one of my ‘nice babies.’ Do you know when I did that picture, I worked for six months trying to duplicate it. When you do something you love, you want to do more of them. That’s a very natural thing. I know what that picture is: it just moved through me. And then like a dope, I tried to do more for six months, trying to kid myself. But it didn’t work. It’s not rejection. I’m just not there anymore. I don’t live in that world anymore.” And In 1977, responding to a New York Post reporter: “You know a lot of people feel that if I’d stayed with what I was doing, I could have been a nice rich, successful artist. I’m not against money. I’m just for fulfillment more. I felt a range in me, you know… I wanted to be made whole again, between the way I thought and the way I felt. I wanted to become complete again, as I was when I was a kid.”\n\nIn July, in conjunction with the acquisition of an abstract painting and drawing, the Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibits a small survey of 20 works, entitled: Philip Guston Drawings 1938-1972. But the figurative drawings are displayed less prominently than the abstract work, discretely tucked into small vitrines where they are less visible.\n\nAs none of his new work is selling and he is no longer receiving a monthly stipend, as he had from the Marlborough Gallery, Guston accepts a teaching position at Boston University, traveling once a month to critique the work of graduate students in painting. More than 40 years later, some of his students still claim his profound influence, not so much in form or style, but in the lasting effects of his challenging them to dig deep within themselves and engage fully in the “serious play of painting.”\n\nIn spring of the following year, the Boston University Art Gallery holds a one-man show of Guston’s late work, in conjunction with the publication of an interview in the Boston University Journal.\n\nPainting, Smoking, Eating, 1973\n\nStedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, purchased with the generous support of the Vereniging Rembrandt and Mrs. Musa Guston, Woodstock, NY, 1983\n\n“They’re really very recent, these recumbent figures,” Guston tells the critic Harold Rosenberg in the interview. “Actually, I think of them as the painter in bed. One of them, the one with the French fries, is called, Painting, Smoking, Eating. Paint cans on his chest, imagining a painting above him. Thinking now about them, they are mostly about painting, they’re paintings about the painter.”\n\n1975\n\n“I am in a big painting streak,” Guston writes to his poet friend Bill Berkson that spring. “Keeps on going, stranger and more mystifying than ever…So this is what I’ve been after so many years—a good, heavy foot in the door of this room, finally. What a difference—to live out a painting instead of just painting it.”\n\nThat year, Guston receives the Distinguished Teaching of Art Award from the College Art Association.\n\nWith students at Boston University, 1978\n\nBefore going to press with her new book, Dore Ashton shares with Guston the manuscript proofs for Yes, but... A Critical Study of Philip Guston to be published the following year by Viking Press.\n\n1976\n\nGuston continues working furiously, and on a larger scale. In 1976 alone, 44 of what are to become his best known iconic and allegorical large paintings emerge from his studio.\n\nThe Door, 1976\n\n“I’ve been painting around the clock, 24 hours or more—sleep a bit and go back—it is totally uncontrollable now,” Guston writes to Bill Berkson that summer. “Phone has been off for months and I look at mail only when a painting is done. They are large, ten feet or so, and take complete possession of me…. It is a new ‘real’ world now that I am making—and I can’t stop. One to another and the sensation that there is always one picture—the last one. But then the need to staple up another canvas. Time—time! Is it my age or does it really take forty years or more to become an artist?”\n\n1977\n\nDavid McKee visits the studio regularly. Solo shows are mounted in 1974, 1975, 1977, 1978, 1979, including two month-long exhibitions in March and April of 1977 to accommodate the flood of work from the prior year. But the critical reaction is muted, and the new work still isn’t selling. Hilton Kramer, who remains foremost art critic for The New York Times, calls Guston’s new work, “silly.” “Putting paint to canvas, he is in complete control,” Kramer writes, “But when it comes to investing the results with big, extra-esthetic ‘meaning,’ he becomes mawkish and unconvincing.” Critics remain fixated on the cartoon-like aspect of his paintings. “Put it this way,” says a clearly exasperated Guston, about his early influences. “I remember lying on the beach at Venice, using the comic section of a newspaper for a mat, but I was looking at a book on Giotto.” In May, Guston’s long painting streak is interrupted by a series of strokes that leave his wife Musa hospitalized for a month, with damage to her cognitive and word-finding abilities. She is unable to write poetry, and her role as caretaker and guardian of Guston’s privacy is compromised. “Our way of life will have to change,” he writes despairingly to Bill Berkson. “Continued painting as I’ve been doing is for now, out.”\n\nRed Blanket, 1977\n\n1978\n\nAs his wife Musa gradually recovers, the new year brings a return to normalcy for Guston, and with it new optimism and energy. A long-overdue in-depth review of the late work is published in one of the major journals, Art in America.\n\nIn her extensive article Roberta Smith offers a close reading of the different periods and subjects of the late work in the context of his entire career.\n\nIn accounting for the interest of the younger artists who have been flocking to the McKee shows, she writes: “In some ways, Guston is not only underground, he is a young artist again—perhaps younger than ever before. His recent paintings have the peculiar cautionless indulgence of someone who has just found his artistic identity and with that, an incredible amount of energy… In comparison the figurative work of his youth looks old and academic. At the same time, however, Guston’s recent surfaces look as if they have been made by a man who has spent his life painting, whose experience gives him the freedom and courage to paint whatever image has the most urgency for him, without having to worry about the paint.”\n\n1979\n\nIn January, Guston travels to San Francisco to view this small exhibition of his paintings, and to meet the California collectors who have embraced his new work. After his return, he is felled by a massive, nearly fatal heart attack, spending several weeks in the hospital. But his drive to paint is undiminished. At home, he slowly recovers enough strength to work on smaller paintings.\n\n“So here I am back at the hospital—heart complications. Time wasted!” Guston writes to Bill Berkson in August, after a relapse. He laments that now that he will be forced to “work small” as he is no longer able to stand in front of his large painting wall for long bouts of work. Instead, he can only work for short periods, seated at his drawing table.\n\n“The TRUTH is, I am an old man. I always knew it was a PACT and the price to pay. So, the hell with it! The docs say it will be a year to get back to “normal” if I live right—i.e., change my way of life. And who the hell is going to do that?”\n\nUntitled, 1978\n\nWhile decades of heavy smoking and drinking have clearly taken a physical toll, the “pact” Guston is referring to reaches deeper than these “Bad Habits,” the ironic title he’d given one of the paintings in the 1970 Marlborough show.\n\n“I must quote you something from an essay by Evgeny Zamyatin,” Guston writes to Dore Ashton.\n\n“No revolution, no heresy, is comfortable and easy. Because it is a leap, it is a rupture of the smooth evolutionary curve and a rupture is a wound, a pain. But it is a necessary wound: most people suffer from hereditary sleeping sickness, and those who are sick with this ailment (entropy) must not be allowed to sleep or they will go to their last sleep, the sleep of death. This same sickness is common to artists and writers: they go contentedly to sleep in their favorite artistic form which they have devised, then twice revised. They do not have the strength to wound themselves, to cease to love what has become dear to them.”\n\nWhen a solo show of his 1979 paintings opens at the McKee Gallery in October, Guston feels well enough to attend the opening. “Mentally it will be better for me to come in,” he tells Bill Berkson. “I’ve been with doctors, hospitals, etc. for so long…”\n\nFinally, a few of Guston’s paintings have sold and there are more positive reviews, even one from The New York Times, this time from John Russell.\n\n“It is now almost 10 years since Philip Guston abandoned the swoony, deliquescent, freely brushed abstract paintings for which he was best known. In their stead, he began a long series of representational paintings in which a private demonology was set down on the canvas. Sometimes a single common object was summoned before us with hallucinatory force. Sometimes a complete inner landscape — usually of a grim, Beckettian sort — was built up on the grand scale.…These were somber images, but they were saved from bathos by the natural dignity of Mr. Guston's way with paint. That dignity is in no way abated in his recent paintings at the David McKee Gallery, 140 East 63rd Street. If the subject matter is on the whole still very grim, it has now redoubled element of exorcism in that Mr. Guston has lately come through a grave illness…As on earlier occasions, a wild humor breaks out when we least expect it these idiosyncratic works, which are on view through the end of October.”\n\nGuston begins work on a series of lithographs with Sidney Felsen for Gemini G.E.L., his fine arts print studio in California.\n\n“It’s not so much a painting show. It’s a life. A life lived,” Guston tells a small group of writers and critics assembled in the museum, as captured by filmmaker Michael Blackwood, who is filming at the museum for an hour-long Guston documentary. As the week wears on, the planned festivities, interviews and publicity take an obvious toll, but Guston, fearful of further hospitalization, refuses medical attention.\n\nWith the clarity of hindsight, it later appears to his family and friends that Guston has been keeping himself alive through sheer force of will long enough to witness his “life lived” on the walls of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.\n\nThree weeks after the festivities, on June 7, 1980, while dining at the home of Woodstock friends, Philip Guston suffers a second, fatal heart attack and dies. He is only 66 years old.\n\nAfter the funeral, the retrospective lives on as a fitting memorial, with Guston’s family and close friends gathering at each venue over the next year, as Guston’s life work moves to The Corcoran Gallery in Washington DC in July, to the Museum of Contemporary Art in\n\nPhilip Guston Retrospective 1930-1979 San Francisco Museum of Modern Art Catalogue\n\nChicago in November, to the Denver Art Museum in February and finally, to the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in June of 1981.\n\nWith the retrospective, critical response has changed. Now, the commentary is largely positive, emphasizing the importance of the paintings of the final 12 years of Guston’s life.\n\nOver the decades following his death much is written about the influence of Philip Guston on a younger generation of figurative painters, and his work and career are increasingly revered as an example not only of painterliness and inventive freedom, but of creative integrity in the face of relentless criticism.\n\nIn 1988, The Museum of Modern Art in New York mounted a drawings retrospective that travelled to the Museum Overholland, Amsterdam; the Fundació Caixa de Pensions, Barcelona; the Museum of Modern Art, Oxford; The Douglas Hyde Gallery, Dublin; and the Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Moderna e Contemporanea, Rome.\n\nDigital Image © The Museum of Modern Art/ Licensed by SCALA/Art Resource, NY\n\nIn 1989, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia in Madrid organized another major painting retrospective that travelled to the Palau de la Virreina, Barcelona; the Saint Louis Art Museum; and the Dallas Museum of Art.\n\nMuseo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, credit: Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC, Gift of the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Foundation,\n\nSince his death in 1980, interest in Guston’s work continues to expand, with hundreds of reviews and articles published, as well as many monographs and other books, all listed in the detailed bibliography on the Catalogue Raisonné section of our website.\n\nAll other major solo and group exhibitions around the world are also detailed on this website, as are the notable museum collections where Guston’s paintings, drawings and prints appear."
