        "text": "Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) is the capstone course for MICA's undergraduate Curatorial Studies Concentration. The course examines the curatorial process through the research, planning and production of a major exhibition. Students serve as curators, designers, and educators as they develop and implement proposals for the exhibit’s graphic and exhibit designs, interpretive texts, public programs, community outreach, website, publications, and public relations strategy. Fall semester is devoted to the conceptualization and development of the artistic, design and educational components for the exhibition in the spring semester.\n\nhistorically hysterical\n\nApril 11–28, 2019\n\nThe Peale Center, 225 Holliday Street\n\nHISTORICALLY HYSTERICAL: MICA’S EXHIBITION DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR\n\nBRINGS ANARCHA-FEMINIST ART TO THE PEALE CENTER\n\nMaryland Institute College of Art’s (MICA) Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) presents historically hysterical, a show featuring artists who reject the coercive hierarchy of gender roles in order to smash the patriarchy. Created by a class of twelve women curators, the exhibition uses installation, performance, photography, and mixed media fiber works—all created by contemporary women artists—to transform three floors of Baltimore’s historic Peale Center. The show opens with a public reception on Thursday, April 11 from 6–9pm, including a performance by Baltimore feminist hardcore punk band War on Women.\n\nhistorically hysterical features women artists from diverse backgrounds who reference some of the materials and methods of seminal feminist art from the 1970s but draw their content from the present moment. This link between past and present mirrors current political realities: As a record-breaking 102 women joined the U.S. House of Representatives in the wake of #MeToo and the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, some journalists dubbed 2018 the “Year of the Woman”—a title previously used to describe 1992, the year after Anita Hill testified against Clarence Thomas during his Supreme Court confirmation battle. The struggle for the acknowledgment of women’s experiences, contributions, and imaginative labor in a male-dominated system seems to echo across decades, forever unresolved.\n\nThe answer, the curators suggest, is anarcha-feminism, an ideology that rejects traditional power relationships and demands equity, horizontality, and free association. The spirit of anarcha-feminism might seem antithetical to the past life of the Peale, which, as the first purpose-built museum in the U.S., once reflected nineteenth-century hierarchical approaches to knowledge and culture. But by inviting women artists to occupy the Peale and excavate, transform, and repurpose its spaces, EDS asks viewers to feel the power of the future, be inspired, and be liberated.\n\nhistorically hysterical includes an installation by New York artist Katie Bell, created directly on the walls of the Peale with materials scavenged on-site; mixed-media fiber works by New York artist Tamar Stone incorporating corsets, dolls’ beds, and embroidered text; staged narrative photos exploring beauty politics and race by Baltimore-based artist Nakeya Brown; printed tapestries by Baltimore-born artist Amy Helminiak using found digital images to construct personal narratives; fiber-based sculptures and installation works referencing the human body by Louisiana sculptor Suzanna Scott; a performance and installation by Chicago-based artist Verónica Casado Hernandez; and photos of protest by East Baltimore photographer, educator, and freedom fighter Shan Wallace.\n\nIn addition to works and performances by these artists, the exhibition also features interactive elements, including a communal “hysteria room” in which visitors are encouraged to let loose, embrace the spirit of anarcha-feminism, and respond creatively—or viscerally. The Peale’s permanent historical exhibition on the ground floor will be supplemented with an exhibit resource area, including a library of anarcha-feminist texts selected by Baltimore’s anarchist bookstore, Red Emma’s.\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nThursday, April 11, 6-9pm\n\nExhibition opening reception featuring a performance by artist Verónica Casado Hernandez and live music from Baltimore-based feminist hardcore punk band War on Women.\n\nThursday, April 18, 6–8pm\n\nA roundtable discussion at the Peale Center exploring feminism in the post-gender binary present. Moderated by Leslie Cozzi, Baltimore Museum of Art Assistant Curator for Prints, Drawings, and Photographs, and including panelists Shawna Potter, lead singer for War on Women; featured exhibition artist Nakeya Brown, and Peale Center Director Dr. Nancy Proctor.\n\nWednesday, April 24, 9:30-11am\n\nA guided tour of the new facility for exhibition partner Red Emma’s, a radical, self-managed, collective bookstore and café, followed by a Q&A with staff members.\n\nhistorically hysterical is organized and curated by EDS students Hannah Ahn, Andrea Alvarado-Sierra, Yun Jung, Miry Kim, Deyane Moses, Agnes Oh, Chloe Phan, Victoria Schultz, Isabel Pardo, Hanul Song, Rivers Zhu, and Lily Wilkins. The exhibition is made possible by Friends of EDS.\n\nAmerican Made\n\nApril 29 - May 27, 2017\n\nMaryland Art Place, 218 W Saratoga Street\n\nAmerican Made: Mass Production/Mass Incarceration opens Saturday, April 29, and examines concepts of mass production and forced labor in art by prisoners.\n\nStudents in the Maryland Institute College of Art’s (MICA) Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) present “American Made: Mass Production/Mass Incarceration,” an exhibition and reading room that showcases photography, zines, video and other visual art forms produced by current and former prisoners that examines concepts of mass production and forced labor in prisons.\n\nThe exhibition opens with a reception and artist talk on Saturday, April 29, at 6 p.m., and runs through Saturday, May 27, at Maryland Art Place, 218 W Saratoga Street. Founded in 1997 by M.F.A. in Curatorial Practice founding director George Ciscle, EDS is a yearlong course that provides students professional experience in curatorial practice by working collaboratively with mentors to research, plan and produce a major exhibition. This year’s seminar was led by MICA faculty Jeffry Cudlin.\n\nFor “American Made,” EDS students examined how craft works as currency in the U.S. prison system, and organized the exhibition to showcase creativity as a reaction to incarceration while exposing production from forced labor.\n\nWork in “American Made” includes an installation by Philadelphia-based artist Jesse Krimes; text and photos by San Francisco-based anthropologist Sandra Cate and photographer Robert Gumpert; videos from the Real News Network presented by Baltimore-based artist Bashi Rose ; painting by Philadelphia-based artist Russel Craig; new drawings by Angelo, in collaboration with Chicago-based collective Temporary Services; posters by New York-based designer and artist Josh MacPhee; and zines and other publications including The Beat Within by David Inocencio (San Francisco), Tenacious by Victoria Law (New York), and South Chicago ARA/ABC Zine Distro by Anthony Rayson (Chicago).\n\nEVENTS\n\nSaturday, April 29, 6 - 9 p.m.\n\n“American Made” opening and talk by participating artist Jesse Krimes and performance by mentor and D.R.A.M.A. co-founder Soldier, followed by a reception catered by Eye Can Bmore, an organization staffed by formerly incarcerated individuals.\n\nThursday, May 4, 6 - 8 p.m.\n\nGuest speaker Anthony Rayson discusses his collaborations with prisoner writers and artists. He will present original prisoner artworks and zines, which will be followed by a zine-making workshop.\n\n“American Made” is organized and curated by EDS students Sera Boeno, Cynthia Fang, Maya Fell, Betty Gonzales, Sukhmani Kaur, Joe Leonard, Zoe Moldenhauer, Lucas Nelson and Jenna Rayman. The exhibition is made possible by Friends of EDS.\n\nRoom\n\nApril 8 - 29, 2016\n\nStation North Arts and Entertainment District,1727 N Charles Street\n\nMICA STUDENTS COMMISSION AND CREATE GIANT INFLATABLE ARTWORKS\n\n“ROOM” opens Friday, April 1, and features large inflatable structures created by Rhode Island art and design collective Pneuhaus. Maryland Institute College of Art’s (MICA) Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) presents ROOM, an exhibition featuring newly commissioned inflatable artworks by Rhode Island-based design collective Pneuhaus. Opening Friday, April 1 at 1727 N Charles Street, in the Station North Arts and Entertainment District, ROOM invites audiences to rethink their perceptions of public and private spaces through immersive interactive artworks.\n\n“The pieces in this show are designed to heighten viewers’ awareness,” says EDS student Kelly Zhong (‘18). “The artists and the EDS curators ask viewers to think about their reactions once they step inside these abstract shapes and compare them to spatial experiences they have every day.” The core of the exhibition is two giant inflatable structures that visitors enter one at a time. Inside these structures, the artists have created two very different spatial experiences, evoking feelings of connection and displacement. The exhibition will invite audiences to consider how pure, abstract, geometric form might relate to their day-to- day experiences in the city of Baltimore.\n\nAlongside these pieces, EDS will feature smaller works and models exploring Pneuhaus’s themes of space and form, as well as projects created by students in Olivia Robinson’s ‘98 (fiber) course, “Inflatables: Sculpting Air.” These students worked with Pneuhaus over the course of a weekend workshop to explore new technologies and create inflatable structures that respond to the human body. To activate these structures, the EDS class will present a series of programs in the gallery--including a performance night on April 7 with Baltimore’s EMP Collective.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nPneuhaus is an art and design collective formed by designers Matthew Muller, August Lehrecke, and Levi Bedall. Pneuhaus focuses on audience participation with large scale objects that serve a wide range of purposes, from abstract material explorations to functional temporary shelters.\n\nSupport for ROOM is provided in part by Friends of EDS.\n\nHand/Made\n\nJanuary 30–March 15, 2015\n\nDecker Gallery, 1303 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nMICA’S EXHIBITION DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR CONNECTS 19TH-CENTURY WILLIAM HENRY RINEHART SCULPTURE WITH CONTEMPORARY WORKS\n\nMaryland Institute College of Art’s (MICA) Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) students present HAND / MADE, an art show juxtaposing an original 19th-century marble sculpture by artist and former MICA student William Henry Rinehart with 3-D, performance and video works by contemporary sculptors and interdisciplinary artists.\n\nExhibited in MICA’s Fox Building: Decker Gallery (1303 W. Mount Royal Ave.) from Friday, Jan. 30–Sunday, March 15, HAND / MADE makes vital connections between traditional methods employed by artists working with 19th-century studio artisan teams and collaborative practices in contemporary studios. A reception will take place Friday, Feb. 6, 5–8 p.m.\n\n“HAND / MADE'' explores how sculptures are seldom the result of a simple transaction between a single artist, an idea and a given medium,” said EDS co-curator and class spokesperson Adenike Adelekan ’15 (art history, theory, and criticism). “The methods and practices that are sometimes used when creating a sculpture can involve multiple people beyond the artist. This can cause tension regarding the complex issue of authorship. Our exhibition aims to investigate this on-going discussion.”\n\nThe EDS class will show work from six contemporary artists, all with ties to MICA, of which five have been commissioned for new work. Fiber faculty member Annet Couwenberg, Nancy Daly ’11 (Photographic & Electronic Media), Director of the Rinehart School of Sculpture Maren Hassinger, Richard Vosseller ’95 (general fine arts) and Megan Van Wagoner ’00 (Mount Royal School of Art) are creating works that respond to Rinehart’s most reproduced sculpture, Sleeping Children. Each artist has been asked to reflect on the relationship between individual creative expression and artistic collaboration—and what it means when others’ labor is required to realize an artwork. MICA’s own Sleeping Children will be displayed alongside the commissioned pieces, allowing the audience to draw connections from the past to the present. Also on display will be contemporary marble work by Sebastian Martorana ’08 (Rinehart School of Sculpture), with his tools and maquettes (or scale models) to help viewers visualize the traditional carving process.\n\nCouwenberg utilizes 3-D printing technology to create abstract sculptures that refer to Dutch ruffled collars and traditional embroidery to explore how fabric impacts our lives from the past to the present. Daly creates interactive sculptures that give physical existence to digital phenomena and asks viewers to consider how social media and online technologies transform the texture of their lives. Originally trained in dance, Hassinger often bridges the gaps between sculpture and performance in her work. Vosseller creates large-scale wooden sculptures that mimic the forms of collapsed buildings or falling prizefighters to examine movement within static structures. Van Wagoner creates sculptures out of cast glass and aluminum that investigate our relationship to factory farming and the natural world. Martorana uses traditional carving methods to transform unyielding marble into unexpected textures and forms, including cushions, bath towels and stuffed animals.\n\nHAND / MADE at MICA will serve as a counterpart to Rinehart’s Studio: Rough Stone to Living Marble, a focus exhibition on Rinehart at The Walters Art Museum (600 N. Charles St.), Sunday, March 29–Sunday, Aug. 30, 2015.\n\nThe Walters’ Rinehart exhibition is curated by Jenny Carson, chair of MICA’s Department of Art History, Theory, and Criticism, with assistance from Jo Briggs, the Walters’ assistant curator of 18th- and 19th-century art and manager of curatorial fellowships. Carson has worked closely as a mentor to the EDS class during the exhibition planning process.\n\n“Carson’s show at the Walters, which focuses on Rinehart’s studio practices, has created a solid anchor to base our show around,” said MICA EDS student project coordinator Ricki Rothchild ’17 (painting). “By using Sleeping Children as the core for HAND / MADE, we’ve been able to utilize the comparison of the past and present to explore the issues of authorship in a more nuanced way.”\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nPanel Discussion\n\nFriday, Feb. 13, 5–6 p.m.\n\nMICA’s Fred Lazarus IV Center: Auditorium, 131 W. North Ave.\n\nThe topic of authorship in the contemporary art world is one that is often contested and debated. EDS welcomes the public to join in a conversation among the artists of HAND / MADE as they discuss their views on such a controversial topic and how that affects their own art and artmaking practice.\n\nMake Night and Gallery Talk\n\nThursday, Feb. 26, 6–8:30 p.m.\n\nThe Walters Art Museum, 600 N. Charles St.\n\nAnnet Couwenberg will lead a special Make Night and Gallery Talk at the Walters, discussing the role of fabric in the Golden Age of Dutch painting and in our lives now. The Make Night, assisted by EDS students, will consist of creating plaster casts of fabric. Registration and tickets will be available through the Walters website.\n\nGreen Mount Expedition\n\nSaturday, April 18, 11 a.m.–1 p.m.\n\nGreen Mount Cemetery, 1501 Greenmount Ave.\n\nThe Green Mount Expedition provides a way to explore Rinehart sculptures outside of the gallery or museum setting. Visitors can tour the cemetery to see the Rinehart marbles exhibited on these grounds and participate in a scavenger hunt.\n\nThe EDS class will design and print a joint MICA and Walters catalog, linking historical material at the Walters to contemporary works at the College. The catalog will be available at the museum during the Rinehart exhibition at the Walters Art Museum, while supplies last.\n\nMICA’s relationship to former student Rinehart includes the College’s establishing its Rinehart School of Sculpture—the first graduate-level art program of its kind in America—in 1896 through a bequest from Rinehart, administered by trustees of the Peabody Institute at the request of his estate executors, including William T. Walters, a close friend of Rinehart and father of Henry Walters, founder of the Walters Art Museum and former MICA trustee. EDS would like to thank the Friends of EDS for their generous support.\n\nWorkin’ the Tease: The Art of Baltimore Burlesque\n\nApril 22– May 7, 2014\n\nThe Patricia and Arthur Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric, 140 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nMICA’S EXHIBITION DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR SHOWCASES BALTIMORE BURLESQUE AS AN ART FORM THROUGH WORKIN’ THE TEASE\n\nLive Performance and Exhibition Examine the Evolution of Baltimore’s Many Burlesque Genres\n\nMaryland Institute College of Art’s (MICA) Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) presents Workin’ the Tease: The Art of Baltimore Burlesque, an exhibition celebrating burlesque as an art form that combines slapstick humor, dance and body spectacle strip tease. From Tuesday, April 22–Wednesday, May 7 at The Patricia and Arthur Modell Performing Arts Center at The Lyric (140 W. Mount Royal Ave.), Workin’ the Tease will look at burlesque’s rich history in Baltimore through live performance and more than 70 historical and contemporary artifacts. Receptions will take place Tuesday, April 22, 5–9 p.m., with a performance at 7 p.m.; and Wednesday, May 7, 5–7 p.m.\n\n“EDS is excited to work with the Modell Lyric to return burlesque to the opera house stage,” said Niamh Doherty, EDS co-curator and class spokesperson. “This show celebrates the evolution of Baltimore’s unique burlesque performance tradition by tracing its history from the Golden Age [in the early 20th century] to contemporary practice.” Visitors can discover burlesque’s evolution over the decades—from the early 20th century, when the section of East Baltimore Street known as “The Block” was home to a thriving burlesque club scene, to recent decades in which a vibrant underground culture formed after the fading of burlesque’s mass appeal during midcentury. Performers, such as Paco Fish, Short Staxx and Tapitha Kix, will provide some of the exhibited artifacts, which will include costumes, pasties, accessories, calling cards and posters from the Globe Poster Printing Corporation, now part of MICA’s collection. Workin’ the Tease will also feature new work from local photographer Sean Scheidt who is photographing the performers in the exhibition and the Best of Baltimore opening night event.\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nUndressing Baltimore\n\nThursday, April 17, 4–6 p.m.\n\nMICA’s Brown Center: Falvey Hall, 1301 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nIn this panel discussion, local burlesque performers give valuable insight into the theories that inspire their performances and the ways in which they use their bodies to tell stories. Audience members are invited to ask questions and get to know the performers as artists and everyday Baltimore residents.\n\nBest of Baltimore\n\nTuesday, April 22, 5–9 p.m., performance at 7 p.m.\n\nModell Lyric, 140 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nAn opening night reception and performance will pay homage to past and current performers on the Modell Lyric opera stage and showcase some of the city’s local talent. This live performance, featuring new and never-before-seen acts, will follow a traditional burlesque performance model, featuring an emcee and individual acts that capture the distinctive spirit of the city’s burlesque scene. Performances will include forms such as queerlesque (burlesque performed by a member of the LGBTQ community), boylesque (burlesque performed by a male), classical, sideshow and acrobatic burlesques.\n\nGlobe Poster Collection: New Perspective on Baltimore Burlesque\n\nSaturday, April 26, 10 a.m.–1 p.m.\n\nMICA’s Dolphin Building: PR 201, 100 Dolphin St.\n\nThis program welcomes participants to learn about Baltimore’s printing history and historical burlesque posters while printing their own. Held in MICAʼs own Dolphin Building, which hosts materials from the Globe Poster Printing Corporation, this workshop allows for participants to design their own dance/burlesque poster through a contemporary perspective.\n\nPREACH! NEW WORKS BY JEFFREY KENT\n\nFeb. 7–March 31, 2013\n\nBearman Gallery, 1417 Thames St.\n\nMICA’s Exhibition Development Seminar Presents Preach! New Works by Jeffrey Kent in the Bearman Gallery at Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park\n\nIn Preach! New Works by Jeffrey Kent, a solo show curated by the Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), Baltimore-based artist Jeffrey Kent(LeRoy E. Hoffberger School of Painting) uses racially charged imagery to criticize what he sees as some of the opinions maintained within the black Christian community on marriage equality for same-sex couples. Using painting, collage, sculpture and mixed-media installation, Kent draws parallels between the Civil Rights Movement and the recent fight for marriage equality in the United States. The exhibition will take place Thursday, Feb. 7*–Sunday, March 31, in the Bearman Gallery at the Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park (1417 Thames St.).\n\n“This [body of] work explores the premise that Americans, who fought to achieve justice and equality, now deny it,” Kent said. Kent fills his canvases with layered fields of garish color juxtaposed with elements of mixed-media collage, including authentic slave-picked cotton from antique chairs. Kent’s sculptures employ chairs, some precariously balanced atop stacks of books, so that the harmony of form is in direct contrast with the provocative materials, including adult magazines, slave-picked cotton, a Bible and prayer rugs. In Have Forgot…, Kent depicts stylized figures of iconic black archetypal characters, protesting against marriage equality. References to slave-picked cotton, jumping the broom, the slave trade and other aspects of black history create a compelling dialogue.\n\n“Jeffrey Kent’s evocative body of work is relevant to the changing political and social atmosphere in the United States concerning marriage equality,” said Abigail Parrish, EDS student co-curator and spokesperson. “In Preach!, Kent, as an alumnus of the Exhibition Development Seminar himself, collaborates with EDS students to establish a groundbreaking exhibition that will touch and affect the Baltimore community.” Kent’s portrayal of a legacy of inequality in American history is complemented by the exhibition location: the Frederick Douglass-Isaac Myers Maritime Park. The venue is a national heritage site that celebrates the lives of Frederick Douglass, a slave who became an abolitionist, and Isaac Myers, a national black leader in the labor movement. Born in Boston, Kent’s creative expression began in his youth through his dedication to community service, as a way of sharing his ideas and learning to set goals for success. Kent has said, “My art focuses on soliciting the viewer to critically reflect upon circumstances of contemporary life.” Although the artist identifies himself as straight, he believes all people deserve equal rights.\n\nIn 2003, Kent founded Sub-Basement Artist Studios, an alternative 12,000-square- foot underground artist studio and gallery space located in downtown Baltimore, which was named Best Gallery by Baltimore City Paper in 2005. Kent, both a MICA and EDS alumnus, was awarded Best Visual Artist by Baltimore City Paper and featured in Baltimore’s Top Ten Artist list by the Examiner, both in 2008.\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nPreach What You Love Opening Reception\n\nThursday, Feb. 14, 6–9 p.m.\n\nWant to experience an alternative Valentine’s Day? Come to the opening reception, Preach What You Love, to enjoy refreshments and wine, participate in bridal shower-related activities and meet artist Jeffrey Kent.\n\nArtist Talk\n\nThursday, Feb. 21, 6–9 p.m.\n\nJeffrey Kent will speak about his inspiration, process and exhibition experiences with Preach!\n\nCommunity Chat\n\nSaturday, March 9, 5–7 p.m.\n\nUsing brief video clips about marriage, religion, race and equality as a starting point, the Community Chat encourages a moderated open discussion amongst organizations, community groups and people of opposing viewpoints, including churches, colleges and LGBT organizations. Popcorn and cotton candy will be provided to help create a light atmosphere during a town hall style chat.\n\nUNDER COVER\n\nJanuary 27–March 11, 2012\n\nDecker Gallery, 1303 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nMICA’S EXHIBITION DEVELOPMENT SEMINAR EXAMINES MODERN-DAY SHELTER, PRIVACY THROUGH UNDER COVER\n\nThis year, Maryland Institute College of Art’s (MICA) Exhibition Development Seminar (EDS) class, along with 11 artists, examine the continuously shifting definitions of shelter and privacy through the interdisciplinary group exhibition, Under Cover. Taking place in Fox Building’s Decker Gallery, 1303 W. Mount Royal Ave., from Friday, Jan. 27–Sunday, March 11, the approximately 50 works of sculpture, photography and video explore how private dwellings and public spaces have begun to merge and how, as a result, concepts of and expectations for shelter, protection and privacy have been irrevocably altered. The class looks at how densely populated cities, surveillance of the public and digital overexposure of personal information have contributed to dissolving the boundary between public and private space. As public domain continues to advance, perhaps the only shelter left is in the privacy of the mind. A reception will be held on Thursday, Feb. 2, 7–9 p.m. with a press preview on Thursday, Jan. 26, 9:30–11 a.m.\n\n“The class has invited a group of artists to think about privacy in real and virtual spaces, new models of urban or nomadic living, and the omnipresence of surveillance in contemporary life,” EDS faculty member Jeffry Cudlin said. “All of these issues are at the forefront of how we live now. They directly affect a group of students who are warily eyeing the current economic climate and trying to navigate a world in which all activities could be regarded as suspicious—and monitored accordingly.”\n\nThe annual EDS enables students to examine the curatorial process through the research, planning and production of a major exhibition.\n\nFEATURED ARTISTS\n\nJames Coupe, Jen Davis, Vin Grabill, Nate Larson and Marni Shindelman, Kelly Loudenberg, Mary Mattingly, Patrick McDonough, Anne Percoco, Keith Perelli, Saul Robbins\n\nUnder Cover is made possible partially through generous support from the Friends of the Exhibition Development Seminar.\n\nPROGRAMS\n\nOpening Reception\n\nThursday, Feb. 2, 7–9 p.m.\n\nFox Building: Decker Gallery, 1303 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nCelebrate the opening of Under Cover, an interdisciplinary group exhibition featuring the works of MICA faculty member Nate Larson and visiting artists James Coupe, Jen Davis, Vin Grabill, Kelly Loudenberg, Mary Mattingly, Patrick McDonough, Anne Percoco, Keith Perelli, Saul Robbins and Marni Shindelman. The catered gallery event will include live entertainment and a variety of “comfort foods.”\n\nArtist Talk: Nate Larson\n\nFriday, Feb. 10, 6 p.m.\n\nFox Building: Decker Gallery, 1303 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nJoin artist Nate Larson for an informal conversation about his series, Geolocation, which is featured in the exhibition, Under Cover. Refreshments will be provided.\n\nFilm Screening: Grey Gardens\n\nSunday, Feb. 12, 7 p.m.\n\nBrown Center: Falvey Hall, 1301 W. Mount Royal Ave.\n\nEDS presents a screening of the 1975 documentary Grey Gardens (directed by Albert and David Maysles). Similar to the works in the exhibition, the film explores themes of boundaries between the private and public, as well as concepts of shelter, protection and privacy. Refreshments will be provided."
