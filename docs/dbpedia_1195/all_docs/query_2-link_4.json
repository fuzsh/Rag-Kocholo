        "text": "Richard Prince\n\nDavid Robbins\n\nRichard Prince initiated rephotography in New York in 1977. Simply expressed, rephotography is photographing existing images and it is an activity that since its invention has been frequently cited as among the most compelling evidence of a genuinely postmodern phase of visual art. Richard Prince is also the author of a novel, Why I Go to the Movies Alone, which elucidates many of his attitudes toward images and their role as social mediators.—Ed.\n\nDR: We’ve become proficient at interpreting the subtle subtexts of mass-culture images, like a generation of social phrenologists, so much so that whereas Godard used to speak in the ’60s of his films being concerned with “the children of Marx and CocaCola,” the popularization of semiotics in the ’70s and ’80s has spawned a generation we might aptly term “the children of Barthes and Coca-Cola.”\n\nA lot of the critical support your work has received has been for its alleged “deconstruction of the advertising image.” Do you see your work as being engaged with this?\n\nRP: To some extent I’m interested in what we produce and what we consume. What we think we own and what we think we control. Do we own and control our TV sets, that kind of thing. I’m interested in the assumptions we make in relation to those interests. I have read where my work is a deconstruction of the advertised image. Well, that’s an extremely narrow reading of the work, if you ask me. Madison Avenue’s decisions don’t particularly interest me. My work is not about illustration, allegory, irony. I’m interested in what some of these images (that happen to appear in the advertising sections of magazines) imagine. I like the presumptuousness and the shame usually associated with these images. I like how unbelievable these images appear to be. How psychologically hopped-up a watch can look! I’ve never felt threatened by these images and certainly never felt compelled to buy what’s represented in the advertisements. Sometimes, most of the time, what’s represented is just wishful thinking. I’m interested in wishful thinking.\n\nDR: How do you locate your images?\n\nRP: My art supply store is a magazine store. I look at magazines in stores, in friend’s houses, on planes. ... I just went to Burbank, California. They have one of the biggest magazine stores in the world. Sometimes it takes a long time to give my pictures the that’s-the-way-they’re-supposed-to-look look. You have to look at a lot of magazines to find four images, for example, that appear to be normal and work together.\n\nDR: I like your work because it zooms in on the dreamy unrealities that are constantly directed toward us by television, the movies, advertising, magazines: the public fictions in which we are steeped, images that other people want us to consume. If I turn on my TV, I get hundreds of “personalities” floating toward me, and it’s hard after 25 years of viewing to know where they stop and I start. Surely most art just adds more fiction—personal fictions—without in any way clarifying our relationship to such images.\n\nRP: Sometimes I think all my work got sent away for. You know, like I saved up my box tops, sent them off to Battle Creek, Michigan, and this is what I got back in the mail. “Baking soda makes the submarine go under water and propels it!” But I’m not just making another fiction. That wouldn’t interest me at all. I’m interested in the fiction becoming true. You know what I mean?: it wouldn’t surprise me if the day came when the earth really did stand still. I’m interested in the idea of making nonfiction art. In other words, I’m interested in making a fiction look true. It seems to me that trying to present something believable might be about asking too much. I’m interested in my photographs asking too much.\n\nDR: Certainly the fictions are out there, thriving away. But how does one go about making nonfiction art?\n\nRP: The fact that my pictures already exist in public helps to establish their reality. I obviously don’t make the images up. My style is hopefully a convincing style. Réphotography is photographing what’s already been determined, so obviously rephotography is about overdetermination. Basically, I’m not interested in impressions, and I like to think I’m in the habit of telling the truth. I always liked the TV shows “To Tell the Truth,” “Truth or Consequences,” and “Who Do You Trust?”: “Okay, panelists, let’s turn all the cards over.”\n\nDR: The speculative image has been central to the art of this century: the artist’s feelings about a given image as the image. But you are disinclined to operate this way. Why are you so suspicious of the speculative?\n\nRP: This is the scenario: The “Perry Mason Show,” right?, and I have to appear before the court. The court doesn’t admit impressions or an expression about something. The judge says, “Okay, mister, what makes your picture so real? Back it up!” The jury pipes up and says, “We already have our own nightmares and dreams, we don’t need yours ... we don’t want what’s you, ya schmuck. What have you been doing all your life, living in the Black Forest in a castle? What do you think you are, special? Show us evidence!” Perry Mason throws my photographs on the mercy of the court, and the court takes one look at them and lets me off scot-free. My family breaks down and cries. Reporters shake my hand and take my picture. And I get a proposal for marriage three days later from one of the members of the jury. How do you like it? I’m going to call it I’m So Excited. Simply put, I’m not interested in people having to take my word for anything. DR: Your work departs from much of what came before it— and is distinct certainly from all expressionisms—in that it is not based on the objective correlative. That is, the traditional artist manipulates inanimate material of one kind or another to communicate an experience he!she has already had, or to recreate in the viewer an experience the viewer has already had. That’s something that’s always bothered me about art, that fundamentally nostalgic impulse. The wish for childhood, the curatorial wish. Such work may look really wild, may be all frothy and rabid with paint, but with such work our understanding of the nature of art stays just where it “belongs,” it doesn’t question either its social position or psychological use.\n\nIn contradistinction, your work doesn’t seem to be about recreating an experience the viewer has already had.\n\nRP: Or that I’ve already had. I tend to take pictures that I’ve never seen, pictured, or observed in my own day-to-day routine. I like to try to figure out where I fit in, my relation to an image that I have no memory of. Just what is part of my experience? My relationship turns out to be more about my personality than my personal feelings or experiences. You know, sometimes I think I wouldn’t even dream of the pictures I take.\n\nDR: Right, pop memory: is it Ella or is it Memorex and what the hell has either to do with me?\n\nRP: Yes. So it is a species of discovery, surely, but it is not a rediscovery. It’s not nostalgia, even if the pictures can be associated with particular pop histories. I have something to do with that picture, personally, because of that picture’s personality, because of my personality—I wouldn’t want to say otherwise. But it’s not a personal reaction. I’m not kneejerking against the picture. I’m not trying to put any kind of distance between myself and the subject matter. On the contrary: I’m trying to get as close to that picture as possible.\n\nDR: The art historian Svetlana Alpers writes about 17th-century Dutch painting in a similar way. She says that the Dutch “sidestep the issue of style or manner almost completely to put nature seen before personal style or self. ...”\n\nRP: I like to take an unbelievable picture and present it as normally as possible. I like to present it with a sensation of normalcy. I like to think of normality as the next special effect. DR: How did you arrive at the decision to rephotograph magazine reproductions?\n\nRP: Well, certain social facts helped to point the way. The ’60s had created an atmosphere whereby the manipulation and control of consumption, of the flow of products and images, became quite accessible, quite understandable by the average guy. I always liked the promises that went along with some of these products. You know, like “Relief in just two hours.” The awakening of desire. These authorless images are very good at living it up. I mean, I wouldn’t even mind being relieved for two hours.\n\nDR: And on top of the ’60s came the one-two punch of Vietnam/ Watergate, which really rattled people’s belief in the authority of institutions—what intellectuals refer to as the “crisis of legitimation.”\n\nRP: Yeah, and in this instance, the result of that sweeping skepticism was, for me, to stop getting my information from history. What’s been presented as “history” of course has turned out to be the real fiction.\n\nDR: The official fiction. Something like the Westmoreland suit against CBS really highlights this. The deinstitutionalization, if we can use the word, of history is a pretty unsettling realization, from which we’ve seen half the nation freak out and seek an antidote in the nostalgia trip of Reagan. In any case, a different breed of art was bound to emerge from these social explosions. RP: Personally, I started practicing without a license. Not waiting for permission. I don’t want to trivialize this realization. It takes a certain ability to perceive the fictiveness of history, and to proceed from there. To just decide one day, History is Fiction—it wasn’t really that it was a shock, because it certainly makes sense, but once you realize it you have to come to terms with it, and begin to see the degree to which things have to do with representation. The tough part is, a lot of the time, you’re on your own.\n\nDR: When you began rephotographing in the late ’70s, was it clear to you that your particular use of the camera—as a selector of already created images—paralleled another significant cultural change: namely, the tremendous increase in the unauthorized reproduction of music? A lot of music got transmitted and wound up in people’s homes via cassettes, taping off the radio. The proliferation of New Wave and experimental music in the late ’70s, with the attendant tiny independent labels, drew people’s interest away from the corporate rock that had dominated the decade. It was the decentralizing of culture. I bring this up to show that ideas about “property” were in the air, as aestheticized politics.\n\nRP: I think the term at that time was “pirating.” It was a business term. To me it was just stealing. “Appropriation” was a more sanitized version of the word. I’m interested when something offensive becomes respected. Taken for granted. I’m interested in being taken for granted. You know, marrying the sheriff’s daughter.\n\nDR: How does one come to the decision to put a photograph or reproduction—in your case a magazine reproduction—in front of a camera? And how does one make the break whereby one goes from tearing the picture out of a magazine and pasting it so there was still an element of collage, to literally sticking the picture in front of the camera, photographing the picture, and presenting the result as a real photograph?\n\nRP: Frankly, part of what drew me to the idea of rephotography was the fact that I’d never really liked my work. I’d sold paintings since the early ’70s, had solo shows, was successful. But I never liked my work. Ever. Because I did it. Obviously, if you don’t like your work, a logical alternative is to take someone else’s—and call it yours. The activity of taking seemed reasonable. I started to think of the camera as a pair of electronic scissors. The public images I would take didn’t really need anything done to them. They didn’t need to be silkscreened or painted on or collaged. The photograph that I presented had 10 to resemble, as much as possible, the photograph that had initially attracted me. It was a matter of being as presumptuous as the original picture. I was interested in the camera as a technological device rather than as a mechanical one. I’m interested in sitting at my desk with my hands folded neatly in my lap.\n\nMy notion of rephotography came about because I didn’t want to aestheticize the picture and I didn’t want to deal with collage. I didn’t want to deal with a seam because, in fact, I wanted my picture to be believed by the audience.\n\nDR: The seamless real.\n\nRP: It’s another ingredient that helps to suspend the disbelief that normally accompanies the viewing of unbelievable pictures. As far as I’m concerned1, Freud was Montgomery Clift.\n\nDR: What’s it feel like when you look through the camera at a two-dimensional image, essentially a “landscape”?\n\nRP: It’s strange. It’s as if I can suddenly distinguish between its manifest content and its latent content. It’s like the picture starts to behave simply because I’m looking at it.\n\nDR: Much of what you’ve said points to a major shift in the conception of the camera. The modernist conception of the camera was at base a belief that the camera by its nature told the truth: the nature of the device, mechanically, was such that it was obligated to record accurately that which occurred before its lens. It’s essentially a passive conception, with Warhol as the apotheosis of this presupposition. But by the beginning of the ’70s, artists knew there was no particular reason to believe in the institutionalized truthtelling characteristics attributed to the camera: all other “governing bodies” were cast in doubtful light, and the camera’s reportorial abilities came to be included. So, in the work of people like Robert Cumming and William Wegman, you start to see the concocting of overt lies that they would get the camera to believe. (In a way, it was what Avedon was doing in fashion photography in the ’50s, photographing scenarios. It’s also connected to what motion pictures have been involved with for years: seamless special effects.) Almost all of Wegman’s work with Man Ray can be read this way. Our thinking changed from believing the camera told the truth to an understanding that the camera believes what it’s told. Our current conception is that it is a dumb beast obligated by its very nature to do so. The camera will “believe” visual lies and report them as truths. So artists started to turn the camera’s obligation to record accurately that which occurred before its lens against itself, and, I think, by extension, against the audience’s prior willingness to believe the photographic truth. There is perhaps a sadism-in-the-service-of-truth here. In the late ’70s and early ’80s, artists started to make the lies less obvious, to remove the seams: Cindy Sherman, yourself, Sherrie Levine, Laurie Simmons. . . . Yeah, I’m interested in all their work, and Welling, Casebere, and Kruger.\n\nRP: When I saw Cindy Sherman’s pictures for the first time, I died. There’s a picture she did of herself with a diver’s mask on, swimming. That picture is really it. I love that picture. That’s one picture I’d be prepared to brag on. Your description seems pretty accurate, though I’m not sure whether one makes the “lying” more or less obvious by hiding the seam. RP: Yes. We're interested in Stu Sutcliff and Pete Best. We're interested not just in \"what happened\" but in what actually happened. I'm interested in people who were almost Beatles. DR: That's one of the primary anxieties in New York, being left out of history. RP: What becomes a legend most. I assume things like the Blackglama campaign are about power and history. Lifestyles of the rich and famous. I'm kind of interested in the lifestyles of the poor and unknown. I don't know, I can't take power and history that seriously. Second banana is interesting to me. I'm not that stupid, to want to be top dog. DR: As your work has progressed, it's become more difficult to determine your sources. The early ones are pretty straight forward about their ad-image source, but around 1980 it opens up a lot more. Do you search for images that work together or do you just wait until they appear in publications? RP: Well, obviously I can only go after certain images, those without copy or logo that fit within the 3 mm frame. There was. repetition, optically, in the early commodity photographs that I liked: four living-room interiors that look the same some how but are all very different, very detailed. This similarity, this sameness within the difference, this equivalence was some thing I hoped would produce an official fiction. You know, a \"look\" that appeared to be reasonable. A look without question. It was when you turned around and went out the door that you got run over, hit from behind, flattened, floored, four on the floor, fuel injected. The boost comes in after you look at it. I’m interested in exactly when and where you’re going.to go out of control. I’m interested in delayed density.\n\nWhen I first started exhibiting these photographs, the reaction was not very . . . welcoming. Very few people liked them. But it’s funny if I think about it now. People would say, “What do you mean it’s a photograph of a photograph? What are you talking about?” I think what gave people a problem was that they couldn’t understand what the actual object was. It wasn’t like a collage. The literalness of the actual, physical object was disorienting. And the thing was, it looked like a photograph because it was a photograph. They’d say things like, “What do you mean it’s not your photograph?” Then, what I was rephotographing was a disaster. Four men looking in the same direction. Advertisements, models, accessories, pens, watches, cigarettes. Not very accommodating images. It was hard to locate where the author was. Anyway, a lot of the reaction was defensive and silly. I was taking photographs; it wasn’t like I was kidnapping the neighbors’ ten-year-old boy. DR: As far as your own use of the camera as electronic scissors—is there really such a tool? RP: Sure. It’s used by art directors. You sit down at a terminal and type a picture on the screen. Instead of pressing the shutter, you press a letter on a key. Any information you want in your picture has already been stored in the machine. It’s just a question of entering a command. Aesthetically, I suppose, there’s another kind of freedom involved in producing an image this way. I have a feeling that artists are becoming obsolete.\n\nDR: Do you think of your images as dead images? RP: No. I think my images are too good to be true. DR: If you are thinking of the camera as an electronic scissors which obviates physical coilaging, what now is being collaged, juxtapositioned, against what? RP: My personality. “Who do I do.” When I was growing up, I liked buying what they used to call “personality posters.” These things came out in the mid6o’s: large black-and-white posters of your favorite film stars. I’d go into Harvard Square on Saturday afternoon with my friends and we’d each pick one out and buy one. They only cost a dollar. I picked Steve McQueen. I always thought the choosing of a personality was in itself some kind of expression. It was enough. All my friends did it. We put them on our walls, in our bedroom. I’ve just kept doing it. DR: You’ve just made your own, personalized the technology. RP: Yes. I guess you additionalize your own personality onto the image. The other things I had on my walls (this is when I was about 15 years old) were pictures of Jackson Pollock and Franz Kline. Not, you understand, pictures of their paintings but pictures of them. I was interested in the portrait of Pollock, not the paintings he did. His portrait looked it. Unbelievable. Posed. Self-conscious. Complete. Classic. Extreme. Just what an artist was supposed to look like. DR: So you’re involved to some degree with mapping the contours of popstar fan identification. Like a pop scientist locating identity extenders. RP: I like to think that I make “hit” pictures. I try to put “I Heard It Through the Grapevine” in my pictures. DR: A hit means reciprocity, somehow. George Trow describes the hit as “it loves you because you love it because it’s a hit.” RP: My photographic “gangs” are about making hit pictures: psychologically hopped up, “The best of.” Instamatic ambience. DR: Do you ever think of the “gangs” as portraits of subcults, a locating of subcults? I ask this because I’m thinking that your work corresponds quite logically to a number of social facts. The decentralization of an institutionalized, dominant view of history coincides with or is responsible for both the rise of the special-interest lobbies in Washington and the incredible proliferation of magazines that occurred in the ’70s—magazines specialized for every taste, every group, and then some. So history becomes demography, the significant expression of preferences by large groups of people. If history is perceived as the official fiction, if authority isn’t believed, then the concept of marginality, of the fringe or subcult, is obviated, because history is fragmented into lifestyle-histories, with none predominating. RP: Specifically, the “Girlfriends” came from biker magazines. The “Girlfriends” is a new type of picture for me. The biker boys take pictures of their girlfriends and then send these pictures to a biker magazine, get them published, and then go out and buy the magazine. Strange. The consumer becomes the consumed. I don’t think that’s about being a subcult. I imagine it’s about wanting to be recognized by yourself. DR: It’s the Fifth Beatle syndrome: wanting to be included in recorded, i.e. media, history. RP: Yes. We’re interested in Stu Sutcliff and Pete Best. We’re interested not just in “what happened” but in what actually happened. I’m interested in people who were almost Beatles. DR: That’s one of the primary anxieties in New York, being left out of history. RP: What becomes a legend most. I assume things like the Blackglama campaign are about power and history. Lifestyles of the rich and famous. I’m kind of interested in the lifestyles of the poor and unknown. I don’t know, I can’t take power and history that seriously. Second banana is interesting to me. I’m not that stupid, to want to be top dog. DR: As your work has progressed, it’s become more difficult to determine your sources. The early ones are pretty straightforward about their ad-image source, but around 1980 it opens up a lot more. Do you search for images that work together or do you just wait until they appear in publications? RP: Well, obviously I can only go after certain images, those without copy or logo that fit within the 35 mm frame. There was repetition, optically, in the early commodity photographs that I liked: four living-room interiors that look the same somehow but are all very different, very detailed. This similarity, this sameness within the difference, this equivalence was something I hoped would produce an official fiction. You know, a “look” that appeared to be reasonable. A look without question. It was when you turned around and went out the door that you got run over, hit from behind, flattened, floored, four on the floor, fuel injected. The boost comes in after you look at\n\nThen in 1980 I made a series which appeared to be an obvious extension of the other work but which was a big change: three women, each looking to the left. The change is that I simply realized you could photograph black-and-white images with color film and it would give them a more even quality. It would create an equivalence which made them look even more real. DR: So in 1980 you began a discreet manipulation of the image. RP: I wanted to keep up or in ... I wanted to keep in the habit of telling the truth. I started to try to simulate the technology of how the picture originally was presented in the magazine. Hopefully my pictures would look as up to date as the latest picture in the latest magazine. You know, it was like setting up an artificial reality to deal with what was already artificial. That’s what I like about Jack Goldstein’s work. Anyway, the pictures I was taking were already directed, managed, manipulated, retouched, and so on. ... I just thought mine had to be the same . . . just like theirs. I’m interested in the closest thing to the real thing.\n\nDR: Do you think of each series being your own campaign? RP: Sure. Sometimes they’re like the “Sunsets” and sometimes they’re like the “Cowboys.” It’s sort of how 20th Century Fox could put out a comedy film one month, a horror film the next, and a western after that. It’s more like a movie than a campaign.\n\nI mean the “Sunsets” were an attempt to put on a show. I wanted the audience who came to the gallery to be entertained. DR: Did this interest in “putting on a show” lead somehow to the “Entertainers” series?\n\nRP: The “Entertainment Pictures” were similar to the “Sunsets” in that I wanted to, on one hand, produce a “look” that looked “bought,” “produced,” “managed.” I started to collect actors’ and actresses’ publicity photos. It was like I was casting the next “show.” I’d go to places where they worked. Nightclubs here in New York. I’d go backstage and watch them make up in the mirrors. Usually I got the pics from theater and nightclub managers. The movie The Sweet Smell of Success, a film about the manipulation of small histories à la Walter Winchell, is in those pictures. Let’s see, what else? ... I liked that a lot of these performers would appear in the newspaper columns with one name, usually their first and always respelled. Like Laoura or Nikki. The identity was so specific they each became a John Doe. I’m not sure who said it, Barbara Kruger or Kate Linker, . . . “you are not yourself.” That’s pretty good. You know, it’s like, what do you mean I’m not myself?\n\nDR: What accounts for the jazzed-up backgrounds in the “Entertainers”? Were you parodying the feel of those places?\n\nRP: What surrounds the entertainer—the visual jazz, the graphics, the colors—is an environment that originally surrounded the pic when I first saw the pic. I would see these pics in windows at the theaters and nightclubs and the windows would always be blacked out around the publicity picture and the colors would be fluorescent and there’d be a lot of blinking lights about. I don’t make this stuff up. I want to be faithful to the content of what the original photograph imagined.\n\nDR: I think there is a very interesting development in the isolation of kinds of identity in your work, in the function of the people actually pictured. You begin with anonymous models, normalized, in normal environments. The “Sunsets” introduced normal human activities—a day at the beach—to photographically manipulated environments. The “Cowboys” are people portraying cowboys, American exotics, actors hiding their acting in real landscapes which read as settings. They are participating in their artificialized landscape quite actively. The “Generics” picture the models associated with some product, acting out, simulating their enjoyment. The “Entertainers” then move to portraits of actual actors, whose product is clearly themselves, but they are marginal actors at the bottom end of things, what remains of the nightclub circuit, waiting to crack the big time. Then the pictures of subcult stars: rock stars and artists. Now a portrait of Phyllis Diller, an actual actress, or demi-actress, whose function is entertainment but who exists outside the central spotlight, in some way, at this point. The tense that exists when one speaks of “has been” or “never was.” All allow their images to jump, in one way or another, through the hoops of commerce.\n\nIn sum, I think you are portraying various levels of image power: in effect, levels of franchisement.\n\nRP: The kinds of identity I picture are pretty much identities that are out of character. The Phyllis Diller portrait was about being out of character. It was a portrait of her, not her as an entertainer. It was about herself. To be yourself and still be out of character was what that portrait was about. I’m interested in being yourself and being out of character at the same time. DR: It’s a kind of multiplication or layering of identity that media culture promotes. Ronald Reagan the president-actor/ actor-president is the height of that confusion. “One never knows whether to believe politicians”: and here is the concrete (if we can use the word) embodiment of that uncertainty.\n\nRP: I think presidential candidates should list their likes and dislikes. I think it would make it easier for people to cast a vote. Like the Dewar’s profile. Favorite book. Favorite movie. What kind of sex they like. If candidate A chose Rocky and Bullwinkle and candidate B chose The Jetsons I think you’d have a pretty clear choice of who to vote for.\n\nI think it’s pretty interesting that some of the people who run for the presidency are actors, astronauts, football players, and basketball players. Personally, I’d like to be a Supreme Court Justice. I’m pretty serious about that. I don’t think the appointment would be that unreasonable.\n\nDR: Jefferson was an architect and Ben Franklin an inventor, an artist.\n\nRP: Yeah. It’s not so outrageous.\n\nDR: And what do you imagine to be your own relationship to the imaging of power, of history?\n\nRP: I’d like to be remembered in a movie. I know that sounds preposterous. But having someone else play me is pretty much what I think I’m already doing."
