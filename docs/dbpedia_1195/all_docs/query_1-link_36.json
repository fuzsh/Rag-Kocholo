        "text": "Andrea Robbins-Rimberg, a Shawnee resident for 13 years, is an artist who works in a full spectrum of mediums that include painting, digital photography and sculpting.\n\nIn the art world, the Brooklyn is nationally recognized with dozens of awards, including National Sculpture Society, James A. Suydam Bronze Metal and Anna Hyatt Huntington and the Horse Head Trophy.\n\nPerpetually reinventing herself, Robbins-Rimberg even did a four-year stint as a food exhibition coordinator where she set up dining banquet displays at the Lincoln Center and The Guggenheim Museum.\n\nShe recently presented a mask collection that was featured at a seasonal exhibition at the Pocono Community Theater on Courtland Street in East Stroudsburg. The show featured a dozen local artists displaying their depiction of the perfect mask. It was part of the cinema's seventh annual Pocono Mountain Cinema Festival.\n\nWith a warm inviting personality and glowing positive disposition, Robbins-Rimberg greets all who enter her life with a never-ending smile. While at the artist's studio and her breathtaking home, she gushed about her humble beginnings.\n\n\"It began on a whim,\" said Robbins-Rimberg. \"It was over 30 years ago when my youngest daughter started school. I decided to take a course at the Brooklyn College, but didn't know where to begin. So I took my finger out and flipped through the pages of the course pamphlet and pointed. It landed on sculpture. The rest is history.\"\n\nAlthough she is distinguished her an artist, she did not always see herself that way., \"I used to say I can't dance, I can't sing and I can't draw a straight line,\" Robbins-Rimberg said. \"The funny thing is I still can't draw a straight line, but somehow it all works out.\"\n\nOnce the artist began sculpting, magic had begun. From that simple college course she grew and studied at the Chaim Gross, National Academy of Design and then studied under Bruno Lucchesi, Evangelo Frudakis and Robert B. Hale.\n\nShe explained, \"Something happened to me when I began sculpting and I was getting recognized for my work right from the start.\"\n\nRobbins-Rimberg was granted the National Academy of Design Scholarship and Merit Scholarship from the National Sculpture Society. The local artist is modest about her many achievements and was most candid about here extensive exhibition history.\n\nShe has been showcased in Lincoln Center, Javits Center, World Trade Center, Circle Gallery, Jaggendorf Bocchi Gallery in New York City and also from being featured in galleries in the Hamptons, N.Y. and in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.\n\nMore recently, Robbins-Rimberg was commissioned to create a bust of Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge for Mountain Laurel Center for Performing Arts. Referring to the bust she said, \"Governor Ridge really enjoyed it. He said I made him look younger and thinner. I was just glad he liked it!\"\n\nRobbins-Rimberg and her husband, David, are both heavily involved in with supporting the local arts. She is an active member of the Monroe County Arts Council as well as many other similar organizations.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Andrea Robbins-Rimberg or to see her work, visit www.sculptureworks.biz. The artist will also be having a one-woman show this April at Art Space in Stroudsburg."
