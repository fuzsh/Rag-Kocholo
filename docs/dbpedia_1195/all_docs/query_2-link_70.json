        "text": "Here we go again...the best of the art world (not to mention the fashion world, culinary world, luxury brands, celebrities, and partygoers) descend on Miami for Miami Art Week, which includes a week long schedule of incredible art exhibits, parties, and events that are sprinkled around the Magic City. A lot has happened here since last year’s Art Week. Miami has welcomed more new high-profile residents to its shores - including Jeff Bezos, Shakira, and Lionel Messi. The level of cuisine has grown exponentially, as Miami now has 11 Michelin-rated restaurants with more on the way. As a native Miamian, I am blown away by the level of culture and sophistication Miami has achieved. Miami’s economy is still booming, with people flocking to the city both to live and to visit - and the attraction of Miami will be on full display during Art Week.\n\n2023 Miami Art Week Event Schedule\n\nArt Week is packed with various events, exhibitions and fairs.

Under the umbrella of his industrial design studio SR_A, three different bench designs are placed throughout the dynamic landscape of MDD’s public spaces and pedestrian walkways, each a testament to Ross' profound exploration of functionality and service in communal areas. Displaying anamorphic, chalk forms made of CNC Steel with a powder coating, the sculptures are made specifically for MDD.\n\nDESIGN COMMISSION 2023 BY LARA BOHINC\n\nMiami Design District has awarded designer Lara Bohinc the 2023 Miami Design District Annual Design Commission. ‘Utopia’ spans four installations featuring irregular, bulbous forms reminiscent of growing cellular organisms. The sculptures are suggestive of living objects, mushrooming across the district. Collectively, they imagine a city where nature thrives peacefully and in harmony with our human presence. Pieces include outdoor seating, tables and oversized light sculptures, as well as a giant centerpiece egg-form, and 900 egg-shaped birdhouses dispersed throughout the trees. Bohinc’s pieces are made from cork and painted by hand in vibrant hues paying homage to Miami’s architectural color palette. Curated in collaboration with Design Miami/ Curatorial Lab, Utopia’s dynamic sculptures will also welcome visitors with a special installation at the entrance of the Design Miami/ fair.\n\nCRAIG ROBINS COLLECTION “A TRAIN OF THOUGHTS”\n\nThe Craig Robins Collection in Miami comprises over 1,300 pieces of contemporary art and innovative design, and exhibited within the Dacra headquarters in the Miami Design District. This year’s rehanging of the collection is titled “A Train of Thoughts”, focusing on two core subgroups of the collection’s holdings: figuration and conceptualism. The exhibition highlights a collecting history that has favored a taste for the abject and hyperbolic figurative image, in tandem with the self-reflexive, institutional critique of art based on ideas— a seemingly incompatible pair that yields unexpected dialogues.\n\nLocation: DACRA Headquarters, 3841 NE 2nd Ave., Miami, FL 33137\n\nDates: December 6 - 8\n\nGAGOSIAN & JEFFREY DEITCH PRESENT ‘FORMS’\n\nForms will be the eighth annual group exhibition presented jointly by Jeffrey Deitch and Gagosian during Miami Art Week and on view in the city's Design District. The dominant narrative of modern art has largely focused on stylistic shifts between binary oppositions: from figuration to abstraction and back again. Playing on this history, the works included in Forms highlight, acknowledge, and challenge the pathway between abstraction and figuration with surrogates for and references to the representational world.\n\nLocation: 35 NE 40th St., Miami, FL 33137\n\nDates: December 5 - 10\n\nTHE CHRONICLES OF MIAMI BY JR\n\nFrench artist JR debuts his newest mural ‘The Chronicles of Miami.’ Inspired by Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, the piece is part of JR’s ambitious Chronicles series that imagines how an entire city can be represented through art. To create the work, JR and his traveling studio visited ten different neighborhoods in Miami, inviting anyone who passed by to be photographed and record a story. The result is an epic, highly realistic composition that captures 1,048 people who make up this ever-changing coastal city. The voices and stories of participants are linked to their portraits through the augmented reality app “JR: murals,” offering an immersive exploration of Miami’s diverse culture and history.\n\nLocation: Jungle Plaza, 3801 NE 1st Ave., Miami, FL 33137\n\nSTARDUST PAVILION BY FLARE\n\nStardust is a 10 ft. tall structure spanning 217 square feet. Ideated by design studio Flare, the structure marks the first of a series of collectible editions of bespoke pavilions inspired by the architectural tradition of XVII Century “Follies.” Upon entering, Stardust envelopes those inside into a dance of light and reflection. A mirrored ceiling and glass walls flirt with visitors’ bodies, while a marble floor elegantly reflects the sounds of the interior atmosphere. Natural light, diffused by the surrounding landscape, softly penetrates the transparent glass walls, animating the space. Stardust, and its complementing furniture pieces (Amaranta and Ana & Chiara), also designed and created by Flare for the Design District, will go on display and be open to the public in November 2023.\n\nLocation: 95 NE 40th St., Miami, FL 33137\n\nDates: November 2023 - January 2024\n\nSWAMPSPACE GALLERY X SPINELLO PROJECTS\n\nSpinello Projects in collaboration with Swampspace Gallery in Miami’s Design District proudly presents VALLE DE LÁGRIMAS (1987), a montage of ten lurid canvases. The installation of paintings are a meditation on popular culture and a tribute to Mexican fotonovelas of the 1970’s. The monumental work was rendered by Sanchez before succumbing to AIDS in 1990. Swampspace presents this seminal work in partnership with Spinello Projects’ series of solo exhibitions and projects entitled GAY ERA.\n\nGAY ERA is a collection of five solo shows and projects, bringing together a selection of artists whose works embody the rich tapestry of queer experiences, narratives, and artistic expressions. VALLE DE LÁGRIMAS / VALLEY OF TEARS is a special curatorial satellite project by the late artist Adolfo Rene Sanchez at Swampspace in the Miami Design District which will be in conversation with six exhibitions at Spinello Projects, featuring Barnaby Whitfield (b.1970, Miami, Florida), Giorgio Celin (b.1986, Barranquilla, Colombia), Juan Arango Palacios (b.1997, Pereira, Colombia) and lastly, Esaí Alfredo’s (b.1997, Puerto Rico), debut solo booth presentation within the Positions sectors at Art Basel Miami Beach.\n\nLocation: 3940 N. Miami Ave., Miami, FL 33127\n\nDates: December 4-9; 11am-5pm\n\nERICK & ELLIOT JIMENEZ: RECLINING MERMAID\n\n‘Reclining Mermaid’ is a site-specific billboard by Elliot & Erick Jiménez, first generation Cuban-American twin photo duo. The work is a portrait of Yemaya, the deity syncretized with our Lady of Regla in Cuba, and ruler of the seas — her shimmering dress resembling the refraction of the ocean’s surface. The figure is mostly obscured with the exception of her eyes; a customary feature within Elliot & Erick’s artwork, the eyes remaining present in the image serves as posterity to the history of Cuba’s colonialism and blending of Spanish and West African traditions. Reclining Mermaid is part of “Southern Histories,” a series of large-scale works at culturally significant sites to commemorate under-recognized historical narratives connected to Miami’s roots in the American South, Latin America, and the Caribbean. This public work underscores the history of migration from the Caribbean and Latin America to Miami, and the myriad ways in which these cultures transformed the city’s urban fabric over the decades. Produced in collaboration with Spinello Projects and commissioned by Fringe Projects with support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.\n\nLocation: Corner of NE 2nd Ave. & 40 St., Miami, FL 33137\n\nRIMOWA X TYPOE\n\nRIMOWA is thrilled to announce their partnership with local Miami artist, Typoe, who created a custom chandelier-inspired art piece that is permanently displayed in their newly renovated Miami Design District store, now open to the public. The piece showcases a striking exploding sculpture frozen in time which features bright colors inspired by the Miami color palette.\n\nTo celebrate the partnership the week of December 4th, in honor of Miami Art Basel 2023, Typoe created a limited-edition “Typoe for RIMOWA” Miami sticker pack, featuring sticker designs drawn from his art piece. The stickers will be complimentary at RIMOWA Design District Store, allowing guests to reimagine Typoe’s artwork on their own personal suitcases.\n\nLocation: Rimowa Design District Store ; 115 NE 40th St. Miami, FL 33137\n\nDates: Sunday, December 3rd to Sunday, December 10th\n\nATIBA JEFFERSON SKATE PHOTOGRAPHY RETROSPECTIVE\n\nWith a career spanning over 25 years, Atiba Jefferson is one of the most significant photographers of our time. His unique style and generation-bridging presence in the world of sport, and specifically skateboarding, has made him not only a witness to moments in skate history but an active participant in the making, sharing, and advancement of the culture. Organized by Architecture, the creative studio founded by the late Virgil Abloh, this exhibition is the most comprehensive survey of Jefferson’s skate photography to date —from his most iconic images of legendary athletes to archival gems. Combined with insightful panel discussions with Atiba and some of his most frequent subjects and collaborators, this retrospective positions Atiba as both a documentarian and an artist whose beautifully composed images and singular style resonate with the skate community and the uninitiated.\n\nLocation: 50 NE 40th St, Miami, FL 33137 Dates: December 6 - 10, 12-6pm daily\n\nANDRES REISINGER “TAKE OVER MIAMI”\n\nRenowned digital artist and designer Andrés Reisinger presents “Take Over Miami,” a spectacular public art installation showcased at the Miami Design District.

Capturing the essence of the Miami Beach art scene from the early 2000s, this cultural event is a love letter to the dawn of Miami’s art scene. The gallery spaces are four of the most influential spaces that emerged in the Design District in the early 2000's, which continue to thrive and support artists today.
