I want to bring this urgent message to the world through my novels.\n\nKay Tobler Liss\n\nAbout the Book:\n\nFour generations of a family return to cherished places in nature from their youth and uncover buried secrets about themselves. From the coast of North Carolina to New York, from Savannah, Georgia to Switzerland, the special places include a meadow, a pine grove, a river, and mountain valley. Their journeys begin after a Christmas dinner and end a year later when they share their stories with each other and start to heal as a family. They finally face a pivotal event–the death of a sibling and son. The most valuable lesson they learn is that nature can not only be a source of beauty and solace but of personal transformation and expanding compassion for all life.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nKay Tobler Liss’s greatest passion is for the natural world. She began writing poetry while out in the woods where she grew up on Long Island, New York. She won a prize for her poetry at 17, and went on to study literature at Bard College and Environmental Studies at Southampton College. Kay Tobler Liss wrote for newspapers and magazines for many years, and also taught literature on the high school and college level but had always wanted to write a novel. Her first novel, “The Last Resort,” published in July 2020, combined both her passion for nature and for social justice for oppressed people. Her new novel, “Coming Home,” deals with how nature can not only save us as individuals but help us find common ground with other people and all living things.\n\nJoin professional photographer J.K. Putnam for this full-day workshop on Saturday, Oct. 5, from approximately 4:30am to 7:30pm. It is designed to maximize learning opportunities and provide guidance on creating the kind of images you want to create. From sunrise to sunset, you will alternate between traveling around Acadia National Park taking photos, and classroom time at the Wendell Gilley Museum where students will discuss a range of topics that lead to successful, self-expressive image-making. There will also be individual instruction based on your goals and your questions.\n\nThe instructor says: What do I mean when I say, self-expression? Am I talking about art? To be honest I struggle with calling myself an artist. I’m uncomfortable with that title. I’m a photographer. Photographer is a very comfortable title for me. But if I want my photography to be personal, I need to express my emotions, my thoughts, and the stories I want to tell through my imagery. I want to express to you, the viewer, how I connect with the subjects that I photograph.\n\nThe cost is $150 for Museum members and $175 for non-members. Spaces are limited. Registration is required.\n\nBonnie Chase’s passion is combining nature, science, and local plant and found materials to create forms of art, inspired by the life that grows around her. Her creativity comes from her connection with the natural world. To create her art, Chase harvests the plants she grows in her garden and ones that grow in the wild around her home. She makes everything she uses, from dye to woven baskets, all from locally grown plant matter. She has always encouraged her students to explore the natural world through a creative lens, throughout her careers in teaching, as executive director of the Cora Hartshorn Arboretum and Nature Center, as Master Naturalist, and leading natural history tours in Central and South America.\n\nThis will be an in-person event, but can also be attended online. We will send a Zoom link to those who choose the online option when reserving space. There will be an artist reception at 6pm.\n\nPeople-Nature-Art is a monthly series that brings artists, writers, carvers, and creative types of all kinds to the Gilley to explore how nature and art interact in their work, and how their art impacts their own approach to nature.\n\nThe title for Lucy Kalian's current body of work, ‘Witnesses’ (on exhibit at the Gallery at Somes Sound in Somesville) refers not only to the thoughtful observer, but also to woodlands, trees, and their remains that have a deeper history than most of us walking the land today. They’ve witnessed humans’ yearning and urgency regarding the turmoil currently present throughout the world. The woods bear witness to a changing ecosystem and changing ‘human system’. She always was compelled to draw, sketch and paint but did not become a professional artist until midlife.\n\nThis will be an in-person event, but can also be attended online.

There will be a public reception at 5:30pm, followed by Buchanan's presentation at 7pm. Both events are free, but registration is required.\n\n“At first glance, biology and printmaking seem to have little common ground, but much of my training as a scientist has served me extremely well as an artist,” she says. “Both disciplines require skill at observing the environment, at not only looking but seeing what is going on around you. I look at biology and art as two dialects in the same language, different ways to communicate what you have learned about the nature of things, about the truth of your experience.”\n\nA collagraph is a hand-made print generated off a printing plate that is a collage of various material. For her pieces, Buchanan starts with a sturdy backing board of plain masonite panel, then glues down shapes of Bristol paper on this board that delineate the major elements of her design. Then she paints over that paper with acrylic gel mediums to add texture and detail to the design, and to prevent the Bristol paper from being saturated with ink when it’s time to print.\n\nBefore becoming a full-time printmaker in 1999, she was educated and employed as a biologist. As an undergraduate at Tufts University, she majored in biology while nurturing her creative skills with as many studio art courses as she could fit into her schedule. After getting a master’s degree in wildlife biology at the University of Alaska she renewed her efforts at studio art with a focus on printmaking and now lives – and makes art – in Rockland, Maine.\n\n“My connection to the natural world, my role as a mother, and my own sense of self all find expression in my images,” she says. “I enjoy looking at landscapes and their inhabitants not only as appealing composition subjects, but also as metaphors for our human experience. Collagraph printing, with all its intricacy and subtlety, is a fascinating medium to use in the communication of these ideas.”\n\nPeople-Nature-Art is a monthly series that brings artists, writers, carvers, and creative types of all kinds to the Gilley to explore how nature and art interact in their work, and how their art impacts their own approach nature. Each session for 2023 is sponsored by our friends at Bar Harbor Bank & Trust.\n\nJoin painter Mary Brooking – the Gilley’s May 2023 People-Nature-Art speaker – for this special event at the Gilley. Using acrylics, Mary will demonstrate techniques for a creating sky-scape with birds flying. Participants will observe and paint along with Mary. All materials will be provided for this “quasi-class.” Participant numbers are limited.\n\nMary enjoys exploring the way colors, textures and compositional form interact with the human senses on a primitive level, testing the balance of reality and abstraction in the context of the Maine landscape. The viewer is invited to enter these spaces mentally and emotionally. Mary's work has been characterized as “expressionist landscape.“ Acrylic paint as a medium forces immediacy and speed in execution, which fits Mary's style and temperament. For Mary, there is no right or wrong approach, no “getting it” or “not getting it” about subject matter - there are only layers of thought, which may sometimes be beautiful. Mary received her B.A. in Fine Art from Hiram College in 1978, cum laude. A 20-year career in graphic design and illustration preceded her present incarnation as a fine artist in Maine.\n\nNorthern Cardinals are one of the most stunning songbirds that increasingly grace our Maine backyards. What secrets are hiding underneath that brilliant red? How does a cardinal learn its song? What are the keys to a successful cardinal nest? Most importantly, why are they so red? The answers to all these questions (and more) will be explored at the Wendell Gilley Museum on Saturday, Nov. 11, at 1pm with Schoodic Institute Science Research Fellow Brooke Goodman. Brooke spent four years researching cardinals in New York, examining connections between body condition and song, urbanization and feather quality, and vegetation and nesting success. Goodman will discuss her research, and delve into the unique role Mainers now play in the northern expansion of the cardinals’ range.\n\nGoodman earned her undergraduate degree in zoology and applied statistics at SUNY Oswego. While there she completed her undergraduate thesis studying song performance as a predictor of body condition and plumage color in Northern Cardinals. She currently works as a Gero Fellow in Science Research at the Schoodic Institute, using bioacoustics to monitor avian community response to restoration efforts in Acadia National Park. Brooke has also spent time in Montana studying the breeding birds of the great plains with the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute.\n\nJohn K. Putnam, a full-time nature and landscape photographer based on Mount Desert Island, will be the November People-Nature-Art presenter at the Wendell Gilley Museum on Tuesday, Nov. 14. There will be a 5:30pm reception followed by a presentation at 7pm that will be offered in-person as well as livecast online. All events are free but registration is required.\n\nFrom 2006 to 2014, Putnam worked as a photographer in New York City producing work for publishing companies and magazines as well as photographing high-end events, all while spending every vacation traveling and photographing across five continents, 20 states, and more than 30 national parks. He moved to Mount Desert Island in 2015.\n\nPeople-Nature-Art is a monthly series that brings artists, writers, carvers, and creative types of all kinds to the Gilley to explore how nature and art interact in their work, and how their art impacts their own approach to nature. Each session for 2023 is sponsored by our friends at Bar Harbor Bank & Trust.\n\nPrintmaker and mixed media artist Sara Tabbert – a past Acadia National Park artist in residence – joins us from her home studio in Fairbanks, Alaska as December’s People-Nature-Art presenter at the Wendell Gilley Museum on Tuesday, Dec. 12 in an online-only presentationat 7pm. Free but registration is required.\n\nTabbert’s large-scale public art commissions can be found throughout Alaska and her work is housed in public collections through the state and far beyond. In early 2020, the Alaska State Museum presented a solo exhibit of her recent work.\n\nShe has been awarded grants from the Rasmuson Foundation and the Alaska State Council on the Arts. In addition to residencies in the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Italy, Tabbert has been an artist-in-residence through the National Park Service in Denali, Zion, Isle Royale, the Chilkoot Trail, and Acadia National Park. She has been selected as a 2024 resident fellow in the Windgate ITE program at the Center for Art in Wood in Philadelphia.\n\n​People-Nature-Art is a monthly series that brings artists, writers, carvers, and creative types of all kinds to the Gilley to explore how nature and art interact in their work, and how their art impacts their own approach to nature. Each session for 2023 is sponsored by our friends at Bar Harbor Bank & Trust.\n\nJan. 19 & Jan. 26\n\nThis is a wonderful 2-part class for beginners or watercolor painters who need to “brush” up on their color studies and technique. The fee covers both classes and all materials. It is taught by Erika Rosso.\n\nIn the first class students will be focusing on mixing colors, layering colors and creating different values. These experiments will be created in grids and labeled so that you can refer to them for future paintings. We will discover which colors are granulated, translucent or opaque and how they interact. Students will work on the values and graded washes on the first day.\n\nOn the second workshop day, students will focus on watercolor technique—how to layer color, when to allow washes to dry in between coats, and when to add color to wet washes. We will also experiment with dry brush techniques and learn when to use more saturated color. All materials supplied. This class is suitable for ages 16 and up.\n\nRESCHEDULED to Wed., Jan. 24 -- 6pm in-person reception & 7pm in-person and online presentation\n\nThe first People-Nature-Art of 2024 features Project Puffin's \"Seabird Sue” Schubel, who paints decoys at Audubon’s Seabird Institute based in Bremen, Maine, but not decoys intended for hunting; her creations help attract birds to breeding colonies.\n\nThe arc of the year now sees her in the field during the spring and summer, working with researchers on the seven Maine seabird islands managed by Audubon. Fall and winter is time to send social attraction tools (sound systems and decoys) to other projects around the world. Over many years, Sue has been with Audubon as a seasonal island supervisor and researcher, a volunteer coordinator and instructor at the Hog Island Audubon Camp, and an outreach educator reaching thousands of kids in the mid-coast. Prior to settling down in a hand-built house in Maine, she lived the life of a travelling biologist/paleontologist/artist/carpenter and explored islands from Polynesia to Iceland.\n\nThis free in-person event will be simultaneously livecast. There will be a 6pm reception for Sue before her presentation which begins at 7pm. This is rescheduled from its original date of Jan. 16 due to a storm.\n\nJan. 19 & Jan. 26\n\nThis is a wonderful 2-part class for beginners or watercolor painters who need to “brush” up on their color studies and technique.

Although people often think it's a ‘new’ form of writing, it's been around for as long as we've been writing stories.”\n\nJakimides has placed in the World's Best Short-Short Story Contest multiple times.\n\nWinner of the Acadia Prize in Poetry, Annaliese Jakimides has more than five hundred publications in magazines, journals, anthologies, and newspapers, and broadcast online and on radio. She has multiple Pushcart Prize nominations and has been a finalist for the Maine Literary Awards in both Poetry and Nonfiction—multiple times for each one—as well as for the Stephen Dunn Poetry Prize. Her work has also been included in art venues such as ArtWord at the Portland Museum of Art. Her essay for NPR’s vaunted This I Believe program was included in the show’s anthology and CD, curated by Liane Hansen. Jakimides’ most recent publication is the essay “I Tell Henry the Plate Is Red,” in the anthology Breaking Bread (Beacon Press, 2022).\n\nA native of inner-city Boston, she moved to northern Maine and raised a family, growing almost all of their food and pumping water by hand. She currently lives in an apartment overlooking the copper dome of the Bangor Public Library. She is also a noted teacher of writing. In addition to working with urban environmental justice organizations and international arts groups, she has developed humanities programs for schools and discussed life through the lens of children’s literature in a variety of settings, including prisons, community centers, and libraries.\n\nJoin researcher Marisa Monroe at the Wendell Gilley Museum at 6 p.m. on Friday, March 22, to learn about her work mapping and predicting when and where amphibians cross roads in Acadia National Park – and how you can help in order to prevent amphibian mortality. Learn about the different species of amphibians in the Park, how their migrations might differ, get examples from around the world on how to mitigate mortality, and review existing data for Acadia.\n\nSpring migration is just around the corner, and while the spectacle of that is captivating, amphibian movements during the rest of the year are largely ignored by citizen science groups. In order to provide Acadia with a broad dataset from March through October, Monroe is looking for citizen scientists to help collect data in 2024 and 2025. Monroe would love to hear from attendees about amphibian movements they have observed throughout the area.\n\nMonroe is a student at the University of Maine, Orono, in the Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, & Conservation Biology working on her Master of Science degree. She has been working on public lands around the West since 2015. Most recently she was based out of Boulder City, Nevada, with the National Park Service working on long-term natural resource monitoring protocols throughout the Mojave and Great Basin Deserts, the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains. When not out in the field, the Oregon native spends her time birding, rock climbing, hiking, and botanizing.\n\nThis event is a reprise of her Jan. 27 presentation at the Gilley. It will take place in person and online. Free but registration required.\n\nCome hang out Saturday night at the Gilley and get creative!

We will be learning how to plan a more complex watercolor painting of two Sandhill Cranes in the snow based off of a photograph by Shixing Wen. Over the two classes, we will make a complete drawing and a color study for our painting, carefully transfer that image to watercolor paper using tracing paper, slowly lay in our lighter values in washes based on our color study, and then continue layering watercolors and begin to add details with a dry brush technique to work towards completing our painting. This class focuses on technique and planning to create a final painting. For students 16 and up.

As a naturalist and artist, Karen creates not just for her own pleasure, but to share stories. By presenting small details in watercolor she invites viewers to look at all nature has to offer more deeply, taking home new insights that they may not otherwise have noticed, and to perhaps look differently at what is right under their feet and in their own backyard.\n\nInspired by naturalists including Maine botanist and illustrator Kate Furbush, Karen spends most days hiking, observing, learning about plants, and painting. She combines natural history notes with sketches from field observations, capturing the spirit of a living entity and its sense of place. For her, merging visual and verbal is a way to gain an understanding of the plant or animal in front of her, and its place in the world around us.\n\nOn March 26 at the Gilley, she will share how drawing is a way to deepen one’s understanding of nature, and to see details often overlooked. In addition to being a Maine Master Naturalist, Karen is a Registered Maine Guide, watercolorist, and nature journal instructor.\n\nCome hang out Saturday night at the Gilley and get creative!

So she paints on.\n\nPainting large bird groups allows her to explore both formal aspects of representation in the modernist tradition, she says, and express her concerns for ecological continuity. She aims to capture the abstract patterns created by birds in a moment of flight, while keeping them in a real and distant space.\n\nMs. Sawin will be at the Wendell Gilley Museum as the People-Nature-Art presenter for July on Tuesday, July 23. There will be a artist’s reception at 6 p.m. open to the public, followed by her presentation at 7 p.m. which will happen in person and simultaneously livecast. Registration is required; when signing up, please indicate whether you will attend in person or online. A Zoom link will be sent to those who choose the online option when reserving space.\n\nThis event, like all of the 2024 People-Nature-Art events, is sponsored by our friends at Bar Harbor Bank & Trust.\n\nCyanotype, also called sun-printing, is an early photographic process that produces blue and white prints. It is usually done in bright sunlight, but can also produce beautiful images on overcast days, and can be done indoors with a specialized UV light. You’ll have a chance to try both sunlight and artificial light.\n\nIn this 2-hour workshop, we will work with 5x7 watercolor paper and will use a variety of objects, including feathers, dried ferns, evergreen branches, paper snowflakes, and chandelier prisms to make woodland-inspired scenes.\n\nSip on wine, tea or seltzer as part of this adults-only class, which is suitable for artists of all levels who are at least 21 years old. All materials and beverages provided.\n\nJennifer Booher is an artist and photographer from Bar Harbor.
