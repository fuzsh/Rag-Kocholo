        "text": "Skyway 2024: 12 Ways of Looking at a Landscape\n\nJuly 19 - November 23, 2024\n\nUSF Contemporary Art Museum\n\nSkyway 2024: 12 Ways of Looking at a Landscape is USF Contemporary Art Museums contribution to Skyway 2024: A Contemporary Collaboration, a multi-venue exhibition that profiles the best new art in the Tampa Bay region. Other institutions participating in Skyway 2024 include The John and Mable Ringling Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg, the Sarasota Art Museum, and the Tampa Museum of Art.\n\nSkyway 2024: 12 Ways of Looking at a Landscape features artworks by Elisabeth Condon, Keith Crowley, John Gurbacs, Karen Tucker Kuykendall, Caui Lofgren, Bruce Marsh, Eric Ondina, Sebastian Ore Blas, Andrés Ramírez, Bradford Robotham, Erin Titus, and Susanna Wallin. Their artworks focus on a wide-open notion of landscape, invoking both the particularities of place and the universal ideas they provoke. Their wildly varied representations give sharp-eyed evidence of a common territorythe rich artistic landscape of a cultural region that has very much come into its own.\n\nSkyway 2024: 12 Ways of Looking at a Landscape is supported in part by the USF College of The Arts; the Lee and Victor Leavengood Endowment; and the Dr. Allen W. and Janet G. Root CAM Endowment. Skyway 2024: A Contemporary Collaboration is supported by the Gobioff Foundation and the Stanton Storer Embrace the Arts Foundation.\n\nEDISON PEÑAFIEL: MARE MAGNVM (A Floridian Odyssey/Una Odisea en la Florida)\n\nAugust 24 - October 26, 2024\n\nGENERATOR | Harbor Hall Gallery, USF St. Petersburg\n\nMARE MAGNVM (A Floridian Odyssey/Una Odisea en la Florida)is a panoramic video installation featuring a stylized, monochromatic sea populated by 14 boats, each with its own unique collection of characters caught in a perpetual loop. Every 30 minutes, the films characters arrive back where they began. Despite appearing larger than life, their boats are constructed of various found objects, including wood, oil drums, and tires, pointing to real-life scenes of migration across bodies of water.\n\nThe name MARE MAGNVM comes from the Latin for Great Sea, the term the Romans used to describe the Mediterranean. The word mare has a complicated history, being associated with evil spirits and terrors in various cultures, including in Old English and Old Irish. Today, the waters of the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, along with other sites of mass migration, reflect an ongoing horror, as millions of migrants flee war, instability, and climate change. MARE MAGNVM does not refer to a single migration event, but rather expands the viewers experience to encompass the phenomenon as a whole. A panoramic artwork, MARE MAGNVM immerses viewers in the struggle of crossing borders, alerting them to a future in which rising waters will push unprecedented numbers of people away from the places they call home.\n\nEDISON PEÑAFIEL: MARE MAGNVM (A Floridian Odyssey/Una Odisea en la Florida) is supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts. GENERATOR: USFCAM and its programs are generously supported by USF College of The Arts; USF St. Petersburg; the Lee and Victor Leavengood Endowment; and the St. Petersburg Downtown Partnership. MARE MAGNVM was produced with the technical and creative support of MAD LABS and Immersiva.\n\nCAM@25:\n\nSocial Engagement\n\nJanuary 17 – March 8, 2014\n\nUSF Contemporary Art Museum\n\nThe USF Contemporary Art Museum celebrates its 25th anniversary with CAM@25: Social Engagement to highlight its history of bringing artists, and the practice of making contemporary art, to the Tampa Bay community. This selection of installations serves to mark CAM’s extensive history of exhibitions, commissions and collaborations with artists whose practices and projects embrace an ethos of responsible social meaning, purpose and motivation in the public sphere. Artists include Los Carpinteros, Pedro Reyes (Mexico), and Janaina Tschäpe (Brazil/Germany).\n\nLos Carpinteros (Havana/Madrid) have collaborated with the USF Institute for Research in Art for nearly a decade, producing two and three-dimensional works while in residence at Graphicstudio as well as the exhibition Inventing the World, organized by CAM in 2005. For Social Engagement, CAM will reveal Los Carpinteros’ newly conserved and fabricated work, Transportable City, 2000. This seminal installation from USFCAM’s collection will be sited outdoors on grounds surrounding the Museum and illuminated at night. Ten three-quarter scale canvas structures—Apartment Building, Capitol, Church, Factory, Hospital, Lighthouse, Military, Prison, University, and Warehouse—are representative of everyday buildings that compose a larger whole. In addition, Conga Irreversible, a 2013 video, will be projected inside the Museum.\n\nMap of Los Carpinteros Transportable City on the museum grounds\n\nImagine, 2012, a sculptural installation by Pedro Reyes, is a social/political statement on contemporary society and our responsibilities toward it. His projects serve as catalysts for communal and psychological transformation, encouraging group interaction and creativity, and poignant reminders of the consequences of inaction and apathy. The installation includes musical instruments created from firearms—including revolvers, shotguns and machine guns—crushed by tanks and steamrollers to render them useless. These were offered to the artist by the Mexican government following their confiscation and subsequent public destruction in the city of Ciudad Juarez. Reyes will be in residence at CAM to participate in a live performance of the instruments in conjunction with a Legislative Theatre Workshop with students from the community and from USF Theatre/Dance and Music.\n\nJanaina Tschäpe returns to CAM with a new configuration of her video installation Blood, Sea, commissioned by USFCAM in 2004 and filmed at Florida's Weeki Wachee Springs. Tschäpe is a prolific mixed media artist with an international presence whose work blends mythology—evoked by the mermaids of Blood, Sea—with other spiritual and cultural influences from her complex German-Brazillian heritage. For CAM@25, Tschäpe will also create a new mixed media installation that includes sections from templates used in the print editions she has developed while in residence at Graphicstudio.\n\nArt in the News, installed in the Genevieve Lykes Dimmitt Lobby Gallery for CAM@25, was a yearlong exhibition of artworks conceived for the context of a daily newspaper. Demonstrating CAM’s commitment to social engagement, Art in the News took the form of a full newspaper page designed by an artist in consultation with CAM staff, and distributed via The Tampa Tribune to 330,000 subscribers once per month on Sundays during 1999. Following each publication, the artist traveled to Tampa to give a public presentation about his or her work at the Tampa Museum of Art. The project featured, in order of publication, artists William Wegman, Lucy Orta, Matthew Barney, Leslie Lerner, The Art Guys, Allan McCollum, Ed Paschke, Andrea Zittel, Keith Edmier, Lorna Simpson, Mariko Mori and Mark Mothersbaugh. In 2000, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), New York, acquired Art in the News for its permanent collection.\n\nCAM@25 is supported in part by a grant from the Arts Council of Hillsborough County and the Board of Hillsborough County Commissioners, and ARTE: Tampa Bay’s Festival of the Americas.
