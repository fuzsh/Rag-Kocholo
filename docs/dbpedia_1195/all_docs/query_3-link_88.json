        "text": "The Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery was dedicated in 1994 and features, local, national, and international contemporary artists. Designed for the exhibition of all media including electronic and installation work. The Triangle Gallery is located in Building 13 on the 4th floor.\n\nCurrent Exhibition:\n\n2024 Fine Art Faculty Exhibition\n\nAugust 12–September 13, 2024\n\nMark Echtner, “The Midway,” 2023, Oil on Canvas, 40 x 30 in.\n\nSinclair Community College’s annual Fine Art Faculty Exhibition will usher in the beginning of the 2024/2025 academic year.\n\nEach fall, the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery, the Works on Paper Gallery, as well as other spaces around Building 13 display work from the faculty and adjunct faculty of Sinclair’s Art Department.\n\nThe Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery traditionally features one faculty member, and this year will exhibit works by Professor Mark Echtner. Echtner’s brightly colored paintings begin by using old paintings turned upside down or random shapes and colors that then inform his abstracted figures and the spaces they occupy. Narratives of daily social interactions and inclusive communities run through this body of work.\n\nPast Exhibitions:\n\nKeith Buswell, Shanna Fliegel, & Marcella Hackbardt\n\nJuly 1–August 3, 2024\n\nMarcella Hackbardt, “Winter Garden,” 2022, Archival Pigment Print, 28 x 40 in. (top)\n\nKeith Buswell, “Benson,” 2022, Etching, 24 x 15 in. (bottom left)\n\nShanna Fliegel, “To Radiate and Blur the Edges,” 2023, Ceramic, 13 x 13 x 1 in. (bottom right)\n\nThe Sinclair Community College Art Department is pleased to present work by Keith Buswell, Shanna Fliegel, and Marcella Hackbardt in the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery and Works on Paper Gallery.\n\nThat Which Connects Us… examines community and connection through the imagery of trees. Buswell utilizes trees found around his community of Lincoln, Nebraska, to encourage the viewer to consider how we are all connected through heritage, proximity, ideas, and desire to aid one another.\n\nOur Proximity to the Gestalt is an inquiry of how the natural environment and built world shape and influence how humans navigate change and trauma. Fliegel prints and draws on clay with vibrant colors to ask the viewer to pay attention and be curious about where they feel safe, heal, and find interconnection.\n\nHackbardt’s photographic series, My Rooms, investigates the representation, temporality, meanings, and ambiguities of spaces. The series includes both \"straight\" staged images shot on-site, as well as constructed digital composites. Both evoke the constructed nature of identities, stories, histories, and memories.\n\nWayne Bertola, Jeremy Mudd, & Ardine Nelson\n\nMay 13–June 22, 2024\n\nThe 2024 Fine Art Student Juried Exhibition is comprised of student work created for fine art classes at Sinclair Community College within the past year. The exhibition’s juror, Cynthia Hayes, will select pieces for the exhibition as well as award best in show, second, and third place.\n\nStudents may choose to list their artwork for sale either to the public and/or to be sold to Sinclair Community College as Student Purchase Awards. The Purchase Award winners are committee selected and will be added to Sinclair’s art collection. Over 130 Student Purchase Awards are located throughout Sinclair’s Dayton and Centerville campuses. This program is made possible thanks to the generosity of Burnell R. Roberts and the Mauch Endowment Fund.\n\nMichele BonDurant and Kathy A. Moore\n\nFebruary 7–March 1, 2024\n\nBonDurant’s cut, painted paper collages explore landscape with a delicate balance between the real and the imaginative. Her objective is to draw in viewers while having them consider the connections in the work. Utilizing both observation and invention, her spare, calculated style expresses contentment in the ordinary and interest in heightened drama using color, pattern, and shadow.\n\nMoore’s drawings and paintings place the viewer within her immediate visual perspective. Setting up multiple still lives in her studio, Moore paints and draws directly from life using the sight measuring method. Focusing on how planes shift as her eyes move around the still life, Moore carefully studies light and shadow, giving her works a luminous, quite, and intimate order.\n\nSteven Labadessa and Peter Scheidt\n\nJanuary 3–30, 2024\n\nSteven Labadessa’s paintings, drawings , and prints of the human figure “serve as a physically enacted ritual of praise and contemplation, aspiring towards a devout pursuit of a severe beauty.” His aesthetic of imperfection alludes to the underlying nature of matter and memory in that everything is subject to age, wear, and decay but is now suspended in the timelessness of the art.\n\nPeter Scheidt’s recent works are sculptural investigations into chair shape, form, and construction. By altering the authentic form and purpose, the object becomes disjointed and nonfunctional. The physical work and craft required to create his pieces requires meticulous attention and care, but the transformations are often humorous and playful.\n\nSalmagundi\n\nSeuil Chung, PJ Hargraves, Drew Ippoliti, & Taylor Sijan\n\nNovember 8–December 16, 2023\n\nThe Sinclair Community College Art Department is pleased to present work by four Akron ceramicists in the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery. The Akron group exhibition features artists Seuil Chung, PJ Hargraves, Drew Ippoliti, and Taylor Sijan. Their exhibition, Salmagundi, or heterogeneous mixture, features a wide variety of ceramic styles, techniques, and inspirations. The exhibition includes functional ware, stylized trees, as well as abstract sculpture.\n\nRachel Abrams and Christina Humble\n\nSeptember 21-October 25, 2023\n\nRachel Abrams’s studio practice is centered on environmental concerns and conservation. Her current body of work focusing on studies of water includes the disappearance of glaciers, restorative aquaculture, and bleaching of coral reefs amongst others. A wide variety of media is utilized, many reclaimed, including fiber, plastics, and paper.\n\nChristina Humble utilizes digital art and historic photographic processes including Cyanotype and Van Dyke Brown prints to explore the boundary between memory and reverie. Sharp geometric shapes float in space amidst soft organic foliage to describe nostalgic, unarticulated memories.\n\n2023 Fine Art Faculty Exhibition, Featuring Professor Kelly Joslin, Ph.D.\n\nAugust 14-September 12, 2023\n\nSinclair Community College’s annual Fine Art Faculty Exhibition will usher in the beginning of the 2023/2024 academic year.\n\nEach fall, the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery, the Works on Paper Gallery, as well as other spaces around Building 13 display work from the faculty and adjunct faculty of Sinclair’s Art Department.\n\nThe Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery traditionally features one faculty member, and this year will exhibit Self-Portrait: Memory & Reflection by Professor Kelly Joslin, Ph.D. Collage and mixed media explore memory and how time fades, distorts, and reawakens memories. Through self-portraiture Dr. Joslin explores the temporal aspects of her physicality and compares past self portraits with later and current ones through a combination of abstract compositions and straightforward images.\n\nDaniel George & Raluca Iancu\n\nJune 22-August 5, 2023\n\nTrigger Trash is a photographic series where George collects and documents found items on federally owned public lands in Idaho where it’s legal to recreationally shoot but unlawful to leave any debris. His work seeks to understand how these targets characterize individuals, relate an attitude of rebelliousness that aligns with a mythologized view of the American West, and represent a culture of violence inexorably linked to firearm use.\n\nIancu’s Roadside Attractions explores disaster, memory, and vulnerability through a wide variety of media. Questioning the ways our society looks at catastrophes and how we deal with the aftermath, Iancu considers technology, the media, and our separation from events as we consume tragedy through our screens or windshields.\n\nDavid Hicks\n\nMay 15-June 14, 2023\n\nAllegorical narratives are found in Hick’s figurative works. Heavily influenced by art history and the traditions of classical painting, Hicks explores multiple themes on a variety of levels, which focus on the interconnectedness of human relationships. However, Hicks ultimately leaves the final interpretation of his artwork to his viewers.\n\n2023 Sinclair Community College Graduating Fine Art Students' Portfolio Exhibition\n\nApril 17-May 6, 2023\n\nThe Sinclair Community College Art Department is pleased to present the works by the 2023 graduating class.\n\nFrom April 17 through May 6 the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery and the Works on Paper gallery will exhibit artwork by students graduating from Sinclair with an Associate of Arts degree. The graduates are in charge of both selecting works from their portfolios to exhibit as well as installing the show.\n\nExhibiting artists include Natalie Blair, Ella Catron, Megan Courtaway, Ellana Davis, Symone Dozier, Alexis Favors, Ava Forrest, Tanya Groff, Taylor Hurte, Madalyn Jones, Kayla Robinson, Elizabeth Rogers, Rachel Schlager, Emily von Stuckrad-Smolinski, Melissa Warf, Kirsten Whitaker, and Lauren Gray Wyland.\n\n2023 Fine Art Student Juried Exhibition\n\nMarch 21-April 11, 2023\n\n2020 Best In Show: Whitney Weydert, \"Morgan,\" Charcoal Drawing (Left)\n\n2021 Best in Show: Yvette Sellers, \"Lydia,\" Clay Sculpture (Top Right)\n\n2022 Best in Show: JulieAnne Moreland, \"Pareidolia,\" Graphite Drawing (Bottom Right)\n\nThe 2023 Fine Art Student Juried Exhibition is comprised of student work created for fine art classes at Sinclair Community College within the past year. The exhibition’s juror is Katherine Siegwarth, Executive Director of FotoFocus, a Cincinnati nonprofit dedicated to championing photography and lens-based art. Siegwarth will select pieces for the exhibition as well as award best of show, second, and third place.\n\nStudents may choose to list their artwork for sale either to the public and/or to be sold to Sinclair Community College as Student Purchase Awards. The Purchase Award winners are committee selected and will be added to Sinclair’s art collection. Over 130 Student Purchase Awards are located throughout Sinclair’s Dayton, Centerville, and Englewood campuses. This program is made possible thanks to the generosity of Burnell R. Roberts and the Mauch Endowment Fund.\n\nCONGRATULATIONS TO THE AWARD WINNERS\n\nBEST IN SHOW and STUDENT PURCHASE AWARD\n\nAlex Snow\n\nThe Guide, 2022\n\nCharcoal and Gesso\n\n24 h. x 18 Inches\n\nSECOND PLACE\n\nElizabeth Rogers\n\nSketchy Self Portrait, 2022\n\nChalk Pastel on Paper\n\n24 h. x 18 Inches\n\nTHIRD PLACE\n\nKatie Bowlby\n\nThe Slaying of Altair the Treacherous, 2022\n\nPaper and Foamcore\n\n11 h. x 11 x 10 Inches\n\nHONORABLE MENTION\n\nPat McWilliams\n\nChaos, 2023\n\nMonotype Print\n\n10 h. x 8 Inches\n\nHONORABLE MENTION\n\nAlex Snow\n\nHome Early, 2023\n\nOil on Canvas\n\n24 h. x 18 Inches\n\nSTUDENT PURCHASE AWARD\n\nEllana Davis\n\nPeppermint Patty, 2022\n\nWoodblock Print\n\n16 h. x 20 Inches\n\nAnnie Lee and Brian Zimerle\n\nFebruary 1-25, 2023\n\nAnnie Lee Zimerle \"Buncheongsagi 3\" (Right)\n\nBrian Zimerle \"Pellucid Puddles\" (Left)\n\nThe Sinclair Community College Art Department is pleased to present works by Annie Lee and Brian Zimerle in the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery.\n\nAnnie Lee and Brian Zimerle present their exhibition, Things That Exist. After immigrating from South Korea in her early teens, Annie was left wondering where she fit: never able to fully descend into one culture for fear of losing the other. Her works stem from the nostalgia of family, place, and societal role and asks the question of who she is as a mother, wife, and artist.\n\nBrian Zimerle looks to a past, whose history can be verified, but can be clouded by perception. The idea of ‘truth’ or more so the actual process of believing and knowing informs his work. His glazed ceramic and clay sculptures reference forms he’s encountered in museums or a shared history with others regarding place at differing times.\n\nGood Soil by Samuel Dunson\n\nJanuary 3 - 24, 2023\n\nSamuel Dunson \"Affirmative Actions\"\n\nSamuel Dunson is exhibiting his series titled Good Soil, which deals with accepting, then overcoming changes that occur throughout life. His work aims to tell stories personal to Dunson, but in a manner that is universal in its comprehension. His use of realism and stylization within the same work allows for weighty concepts to be approached in a light-hearted manner.\n\nGold Standard by Roger Boulay\n\nNovember 3 - December 10, 2022\n\nRoger Boulay \"All that Glitters\" (detail)\n\nRoger Boulay is exhibiting his series titled, Gold Standard. Boulay’s Gold Standard installation invites its viewers to consider the contradictions the color gold holds in our society, the roles gold has played in our past and present, as well as its use in the political realm to exploit, critique, or justify action.\n\nGreg Blair and Tracy Miller-Robbins\n\nSeptember 20 - October 19, 2022\n\nGreg Blair \"Disputed Boundaries\" (left)\n\nTracy Miller-Robbins \"Strange Neighbors\" (center)\n\nBrian Fencl \"Power Over the Beasts\" (right)\n\nGreg Blair and Tracy Miller-Robbins will be exhibiting in the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery through October 19. Often using wood as a foundational material, Blair incorporates additional media to combine fine craft and de-skilled methods of assembly to engage the viewer to better understand the colliding desires, histories, and identities of place.\n\nMiller-Robbins explores the lines between animation and drawing, digital and traditional methods, and abstract and figurative in her works. Utilizing digital tools to create work grounded in traditional methods, Miller-Robbins explores the human condition, universal sensation, and experiences in her subtly autobiographical work.\n\nBrian Fencl will be exhibiting a series in the Works on Papger Gallery entitled “The Modern Punchinello.” These pieces feature his “trickster transformers” who embody Fencl’s observations and explorations of human vulnerabilities. Rooted in pop surrealist philosophies, his work is informed by everyday life, dreams, and an understanding of history.\n\nThe Fine Art Faculty Exhibit Featuring Anthony Wolking\n\nAugust 15 - September 13, 2022\n\nBurnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery Installation Image\n\nEach fall, the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery, the Works on Paper Gallery, as well as other spaces around Building 13 are hosting work from the faculty and adjunct faculty of Sinclair’s Art Department.\n\nThe Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery traditionally features one faculty member, and this year will exhibit work by Anthony Wolking. Wolking has been at Sinclair since 2017 and teaches ceramics and sculpture. When asked about his exhibition he says, “This body of work exhibits the hidden away and disparate parts of my studio process. It is a reflection on the ways in which I seek connections between conscious, intentional making and the residue of making activity. I provide and hold space in consideration of my creative processes and explore framing the unintended with intentionality.”\n\nA Kentucky Native, Wolking spent his formative years viewing the bustling city of Cincinnati from his childhood home across the Ohio River. At a very early age he became aware of his need to make things to bring about a better understanding of the world. His interest in ecology and natural systems are rooted in refining local clays as part of his academic studies in ceramics. He has been a teacher for more than two decades, and his research has taken him throughout the United States, Great Britain, China, and Taiwan. He has exhibited both nationally and internationally where his work is retained by private and public collections.\n\nThere will be a virtual artist talk discussing his work over Zoom on September 8, 2022 at 12pm. Zoom Link.\n\nAdditional Exhibiting Artists: Bridgette Bogle, Mark Echtner, Sara Fleenor, Kevin Harris, Kelly Joslin, and Richard Jurus.\n\nSelected Student Purchase Awards\n\nJuly 5 - August 6, 2022\n\nMatthew Goins Untitled Torso\n\nThe Sinclair Art Department is pleased to present Student Purchase Award artwork in the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery and the Works on Paper Gallery.\n\nThanks to the generosity of Burnell R. Roberts, the Mauch Endowment Fund, as well as a small variety of other donors throughout the years, Sinclair has been able to purchase and display throughout Sinclair’s Dayton, Centerville, and Englewood campuses over 130 pieces of student artwork. Each spring any student who has taken an art class at Sinclair within the last twelve months is eligible and encouraged to submit work created for their classes to the Juried Fine Art Students’ Exhibition. During the exhibition, new works of art are selected as purchase awards. These works of art are acquired and added to the college's art collection.\n\nA twenty-six-piece selection will be on view from Tuesday, July 5, 2022 through Saturday, August 6, 2022. Both galleries are located on the 4th floor of Building 13 (located at Fifth and Perry Streets). The galleries are free and open to the public from 8am–6pm Monday–Friday.

Sacksteder, Debbie Serrer, Luke Shipp, Bryson Smith, Megan Turner, Irene Ward, Hannah Williams, and Stephen Wisebaker.\n\nThe African American Visual Artists Guild's The Artist's Life\n\nMay 23 - June 24, 2022\n\nCraig Screven Creatively Thinking\n\nThe Sinclair Art Department is thrilled to announce the reopening of the Burnell R. Roberts Triangle Gallery with the African American Visual Artists Guild’s The Artists Life Project.\n\nAfter shuttering their physical doors in early 2020 due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, Sinclair’s galleries will again exhibit physical artwork. This begins with a local arts organization, The African American Visual Artists Guild (AAVAG). AAVAG’s current traveling Exposition through Art Program named The Artist’s Life called for artists to create and share something of themselves – their development and/or journey as an artist, an important or meaningful event or person, portraits of themselves, or samples of the other artistic skills they possess. The exhibition includes AAVAG members as well as their invited guests.\n\nThe exhibition will open Monday, May 23 and run through Friday, June 24, 2022. Gallery hours are from 8am-6pm Monday-Friday and the gallery is on the 4th Floor of Building 13, located at the intersection of W 5th Street and S Perry St, Dayton. Both street and garage parking are available.\n\nArtists include Andrea Cummings, Daniel Tristan Cupp, Yvette Dalton, Dwayne Daniel, Bing Davis, Horace Dozier Sr., LaChrisa Gales, Janyce Glasper, Erin Smith Glenn, Al Harden, Kevin Harris, Morris Howard, Constance Storme Johnson, Lois Fortson Kirk, Clarice Moore, Simeon Oyeyemi, David Redmon, Craig Screven, and Debra Richardson Wood­­­­."
