        "text": "The Pet Show\n\n/\n\nOld City Hall\n\nErrol Mauler, who lived on Wynn Road, had been informed that his house cats could never be trained to do tricks like Sam, his Fox terrier. Undaunted, Errol spent hours teaching Nuisance and Fluff to jump through a hoop, roll over, leap in and out of a box, climb a ladder, and shake hands. In May 1962, the two felines joined Sam to show photographer Jack Carver just how great they were. Errol went on to teach his cat Herbie how to dial a telephone in 1975, an accomplishment that made it into “Ripley’s Believe It or Not.” This and other heart-warming images of domestic companions, all from the Whatcom Museum Photo Archives, will appear in a new exhibition, The Pet Show, opening in October on Old City Hall’s first floor.\n\nNow add YOUR pet to the show!\n\nAnimals have held an indelible place in our hearts for thousands of years. From symbols of divinity in ancient Egypt to trusted companions today, we take as many pictures of our pets as we do of our human family members and friends. (Probably more!) So let’s see ’em! Send us your favorite pet photo, and we’ll include it as part of our digital display in The Pet Show gallery in Old City Hall. Then stop by and see your photo along with our archival images that, together, highlight the pets of Whatcom County.\n\nPhoto Submission Guidelines:\n\n3 MB minimum photo preferred\n\nOne photo per family/submission\n\nPlease include Owner name(s) and Pet Name(s) (optional)\n\nPhotos will be reviewed and added to the gallery slideshow the beginning of each week and will be ready for viewing during the museum’s regular hours, Wednesday – Sunday.\n\nTerms:\n\nBy submitting a photo, you agree to its use in both the digital gallery slideshow and on the museum’s social media platforms during the run of the exhibition (October 21, 2023 – April 14, 2024).

Thirty-seven works in a variety of mediums ranging from charcoal drawings to digital illustrations, were submitted by students from grades 6-12. The museum’s Youth Advisory Council, consisting of local teens, judged each piece anonymously using a rubric to assign rankings. Congratulations to Raya Stiles of Bellingham High School, 10th grade, for Ignited; Shanti Thapa of Ferndale High School, 12th grade, for Drifting into an Unknown; and Kelsey Welch of Bellingham High School, 12th grade, for The Impenetrable Internal Oasis.

Afshari is a young Iranian woman who longed for freedom not only from the oppressive regime of Iran but also from prolonged family trauma. After arriving in the United States and experiencing the wind of freedom in her hair, she has found beauty and healing in allowing herself to open up to the expansiveness of her new home. The photographs in Let it Shine were created in her Carmel, California apartment, using a single light source—a window—to illuminate farmer’s market produce and flowers. She captures the beauty of the contrast between darkness and luminous light. This exhibit is the story of losing oneself in the dark edge of life but being given another chance to be alive in the most colorful way.\n\nAbout Mina Afshari\n\nGrowing up in Iran, Mina Afshari witnessed even the most basic human rights being denied. She had to fight for her safety against the government, as well as at home, where she experienced physical and emotional abuse. These experiences awoke her to the world at an early age. Now, she’s fighting to reclaim her innocence.\n\nWhen Afshari was five years old, and her brother was two, they were kidnapped for four months, where she witnessed him being abused. Feeling helpless, her response as a five-year-old was to fight by dumping food on the carpet or throwing clothespins off the balcony.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Afshari was faced with hardships, such as providing emotional support for her father, enduring anger from her mother, caregiving her mother through terminal cancer, experiencing deception and manipulation from extended family, and the death of her brother. From a very young age, she promised herself never to feel again and, through the years, detached and numbed out her emotions as she learned to people please to find safety.\n\nAs a teenager, Afshari was compelled to find a corner of freedom for herself, rebelling against the enforcement of Iran’s rules over women’s clothing and head coverings. She cut her hair short, wore boy clothes, and rode her bicycle at night to feel freedom and the wind in her hair. Eventually, she was arrested at gunpoint by Iran’s “morality police.” When they insisted that her family had to bring proper clothing to release her, she defied them, stating that she had no family and no other clothes. Eventually, to her surprise, they released her. She raised her hand for a cab feeling victorious as she walked out wearing the same “inappropriate” clothing she was arrested in.\n\nIt was after coming to the United States during her mother’s cancer treatment and grieving the loss of her mother that Afshari entered a gym for the first time and began her slow journey of healing. Through the years, her childhood traumas manifested in illness and hopelessness. She learned that her traumas were at the root of her illness and began to get help through meditation, exercise, and education.\n\nThe pandemic gave Afshari a new opportunity to shift her focus. During the shelter-in-place orders, she started taking photographs of produce from the local farmer’s market to promote their services on social media. She became obsessed with capturing the produce in the most flattering way, using light from a single window in her apartment and exploring the contrasts of darkness and luminous light. Picking up the camera was very healing for Afshari, who felt grounded and at peace. She says, “Experimenting with still life photos, I feel I’m reclaiming my innocence again.”\n\nAfshari, currently a university student pursuing a degree in economics, has taken on the role of a research apprentice in the realm of behavioral economics. Guided by her mentors, she employs quantitative methods to explore the intricate interplay between personal history and individual decision-making. Afshari is especially interested in investigating the lives of founders and CEOs as she can personally relate to the resilience and unrelenting resourcefulness of the individuals she studies. Her burning question is to answer what causes us to become compassionate towards each other and what transforms self-preservation into compassion.\n\nThis presentation of Afshari’s photographs is her first exhibit at a museum. Afshari’s work is a direct reflection of journeying through trauma and communicates the innocence that exists within each of us regardless of the darkness through which we’ve traveled. She believes that there is immense power within each individual, even when feeling completely helpless and hopeless. Through her work and her story, she hopes that others find their own strength to take positive, empowering actions to gain back what seemed to have been lost.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum acknowledges that we gather on the traditional territory of the Lhaq’temish – Lummi People – and the Nuxwsá7aq – Nooksack People – who have lived in the Coast Salish region from time immemorial.

Red dresses will be on display in the Lightcatcher Courtyard, representing the thousands of Native women, men, children, and non-binary people who go missing or are murdered each year.\n\nThe original “REDress Project” by artist and Métis Nation member Jaime Black began in Winnipeg in 2011 to draw attention to crime against Aboriginal women in Canada. The project has since spread to the US and calls attention to the lack of reporting, data, and justice for Native American women.\n\nThere is a lack of meaningful data collected on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Some studies have been conducted, including in Whatcom County. The information is heartbreaking and triggering.\n\nWashington State was #2 in a study conducted by Urban Indian Health Institute.\n\nSeattle was #1 in a study conducted by Urban Indian Health Institute.\n\nNative women face murder rates 10 times above the national average. (wernative.org)\n\nNationally, 86% of sexual assaults against Native women are committed by non-Native men.\n\nNative women are the only population that is most likely to experience sexual assault by people outside their racial or ethnic group.\n\nLearn more about this issue by visiting the Urban Indian Health Institute website, www.uihi.org, and the National Indian Council on Aging website, nicoa.org.\n\nWatch a video by the National Museum of the American Indian featuring artist Jaime Black (Métis), who talks more about this project: The REDress Project at the National Museum of the American Indian – YouTube\n\nChildren of the Setting Sun produced a video as a prayer to missing and murdered Indigenous women. Produced in 2019 it features the West Shore Canoe Family, with a song composed by Antone George: The Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women – YouTube\n\nIn 2016, Canada’s unions staged a powerful performance with music by A Tribe Called Red, honoring missing and murdered Indigenous women: Performance for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women – YouTube\n\nThe REDress Installation is organized jointly with Whatcom Community College Native staff and the Whatcom Museum.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum acknowledges that we gather on the traditional territory of the Lhaq’temish – Lummi People – and the Nuxwsá7aq – Nooksack People – who have lived in the Coast Salish region from time immemorial.

The artists traveled back and forth between the two states and often knew one another, sharing common values about the land and drawing inspiration from the wilderness. The misty, foggy weather patterns are often represented in these works.\n\nThe paintings in Coastal Views are drawn from the Whatcom Museum’s collection, the Monterey Museum of Art, Monterey artist Warren Chang, and the private collections of Phil and Mary Serka of Bellingham, Wash.; and Paula and Terry Trotter of Carmel, Calif. Coastal Views is co-curated by Patricia Leach, Executive Director of the Whatcom Museum, and Sarah Clark-Langager, retired Director of the Western Washington University Gallery.\n\nImage credit: Armin C.

Competitors raced from the bay city at outrageous speeds aboard stripped-down automobiles and an old Iron Horse toward two competing trailheads at the foot of Mount Baker. Disembarking from their contrivances, they ran in darkness through dense forest, on snow and ice fields, over glaciers and crevasses, against savage storms and whiteout conditions to the 10,781-foot summit and back again. All for a cash prize in gold.\n\nNo one could have predicted a year earlier that the opening of the Mount Baker wilderness to tourism, development, and potential national park status would depend in part, on the outcome of a race involving loggers, laborers, coal miners and packers, a student, a timber-cruiser, a wrestler, a poultry breeder, and a bedspring maker.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum celebrates both the 110th anniversary of the last Mount Baker Marathon race (1911-1913) and the 50th anniversary of the present Ski to Sea race (1973-2023). On exhibition are numerous images spanning the marathon and Ski to Sea years, as well as film, sound recordings, and memorabilia.\n\nWatch the movie The Mountain Runners, at the Pickford Film Center on Wed., May 24, 6pm. The film tells the story of the Mount Baker Marathon, America’s first mountain endurance/adventure foot race.

In the summer of 2023, she will create a site-specific installation specific to the Museum’s Lightcatcher gallery. The immersive work employing sand, painting, and sculptural elements will explore our very human proclivity to be co-creators of the landscape as we assign value to materials, excavate and harvest, delineate, and build. The artist states, “We live in a place where various cultures have long negotiated a beautiful, fertile, and difficult landscape in hopes it will sustain us. I’m interested in how the prevalent philosophies and priorities of our time sculpt the physical environment and how this place is more porous, interconnected, and transitory than we often realize.”\n\nMurrell’s work also explores how our concept of landscape has changed through technology. The visible horizon traditionally defined our relationship to the world; now, with our expanding perspective, we feel a kinship with microscopic images and aerial views of planets. Vestiges of built environments, architecture, or even scientific illustration have been added to our visual vernacular and create a sense of place for us. Our bodies are quite literally composed of recycled matter from the stars. We are reshuffled molecules. In this context, Murrell considers herself a landscape painter.\n\nMurrell has been awarded residencies at programs such as Yaddo, Ragdale, Arteles in Finland, and Westfjords in Iceland. She has exhibited at Siena Heights University, Boise State University, Schneider Museum of Art, Carnation Contemporary, and Portland State University, among others. Her works are in the University of Oregon and the United States Library of Congress, Prints and Photographs Division collections, and she is currently a Professor of Art at Eastern Oregon University in La Grande, Oregon.\n\nThis exhibition is supported by funds from the Oregon Arts Commission. Additional funding is provided by The Ford Family Foundation and Eastern Oregon University, the Whatcom Museum Foundation, Jean Andresen, and The City of Bellingham.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum acknowledges that we gather on the traditional territory of the Lhaq’temish – Lummi People – and the Nuxwsá7aq – Nooksack People – who have lived in the Coast Salish region from time immemorial.

The goal was to feature photographs that reflect student concerns about equality, justice, and equity. Students worked with a variety of community partners to prepare for the project. A visit to the Museum introduced students to looking closely at art. The Whatcom Dispute Resolution Center taught skills for empathetic discussions. Dr. Lauren McClanahan, Director of the Bellingham Youth Media Project, shared strategies for taking impactful photographs. Through these lessons, students learned how art, identity, and social justice connect together. They then identified a justice issue that spoke to their identities and experiences. Going out into their communities, they captured images that highlight causes they are passionate about. From climate change to racial justice, these images show the challenges affecting the lives of these rising community leaders. See these student works on display in the second-floor hallway of the Lightcatcher building.\n\nSupport of Picturing Justice is provided by Shirley Prichard, Squalicum High School English teacher; Whatcom Dispute Resolution Center; Dr. Lauren McClanahan, Director of the Bellingham Youth Media Project; and Dakota Art.\n\nMore than 70 students participated in the project and below is a selection of the submissions. To see them all and read their artist statements, visit the exhibit in the Museum’s Lightcatcher building!\n\nSmudged\n\nAsian culture has been pushed down and erased in America since the first time Asian immigrants stepped foot in America. Chinatowns, home to cultural traditions from all over Asia, face the gentrification of larger companies. Local businesses, from restaurants to hospitals, are pushed out by white-owned chain restaurants and large apartment complexes. Asian culture in America is actively being invaded and torn down by people who are blind to the community formed through shared culture; to the home Asian Americans find through coming together and sharing their traditions.\n\nGrowing up, I’ve been made fun of for “gross” school lunches my mom woke up early in the morning to pack for me. My name is mispronounced persistently, and there are times I don’t even think to correct it. In my photo, I used a glass window to reflect an image of a barbie against a doll dressed in traditional clothing, representing the contrast between Asian culture and expectations for Asian Americans. The barbie is blurry—a clouded image of someone untrue to oneself, an expectation—whereas the doll behind the window stands her ground. If her identity were to be stripped away, her culture and way of life are still there, simply pushed away. The culture forced upon her, a blurry reflection, is the one unfamiliar to her. My purpose with this photograph is to encourage the audience to be more accepting of cultures they aren’t used to, even in the small actions they take when presented with unfamiliar customs.\n\nAction Statement: I can be unapologetically proud of the culturally diverse aspects of my family, from food to linguistic differences. We can respect cultural hubs such as Chinatowns as places for Asian communities to come together and celebrate their culture.\n\nA Field of Broken Glass\n\nI took this photo in Brazil while I was volunteering with Athletes in Action. Most of this photo is of the open sky framed with a beautiful sunset reflecting off the clouds. As you look closer at this image you see the apartment complex and finally the soccer field. At first people don’t see a soccer field, or at least one that is recognizable to them. This field is all that this community in Teresina Piaui has to offer for their athletes. I took this picture as the kids were taking a water break. As I looked around, some of them didn’t have shoes on and yet all I saw was smiles from the kids as this was their passion. It was enough. I reflected on the photo I had taken that night and realized that there needs to be a movement for equal access to sports and equipment globally. I had only ever played soccer on a beautiful turf field with a pair of cleats that fit me. I don’t even like soccer and yet I had such easy access. For the youth in Teresina soccer is their life and passion and are forced to play on a field filled with sand and glass. My hope is that this image draws attention to the fact that there is a need for equal access to materials and I would encourage more support for programs like Athletes in Action that are helping provide materials for everyone.\n\nAction Statement: I plan to return to Brazil this summer to help provide resources and equipment as well as lead sports camps to help grow their athletic community. You can help to support this mission by aiding programs like “Athletes in Action” and by raising awareness of the unequal access to athletics on a global scale.\n\nTrash\n\nI found this image at a time when wildfire smoke filled the air. Dissatisfied with the weather, to summon fall, I went to a local park. Here, I found the image of what appeared to me like a leaf, melted onto the top of a trash can lid. I knew that it illuminated my thoughts on the environment exactly. I photographed the lid of the trashcan, using a top-down view to not reveal the entire object and to have the focus entirely on the melted part. Growing up in the Pacific Northwest and growing up surrounded by nature, makes it more infuriating to witness extreme heat and flooding that damages my community. I hope to invite the viewer to consider first what the image is and secondly how it came to be. The lid of a trash can melted in the image of something that looks entirely natural. There is a plethora of knowledge and wisdom to be gained by studying and connecting with the natural world. The viewers of my image will hopefully consider the immediacy of damages caused by climate change, both to the natural world and the human world.\n\nAction Statement: I will vote for a politician who will value the health of the environment over the health of corporations.\n\nDresses\n\nThis image represents the slow death of a culture. My culture. The image shows two dresses hung up on a wall. Both dresses are different colors, the designs on the dress are fading but the colors are still vibrant. The dresses are traditional clothes worn every day in Pakistan. The fading design represents fading culture, but the bright colors represent the parts of culture that are being “Americanized”. Typically, second and third generations of immigrants no longer wear traditional garbs anymore. We now wear jeans and sweaters, which makes us slowly lose the culture of our homeland and connections to past generations. I think this is in part due to a fear of not fitting in, of not being “American” enough. Due to this fear, we lose a part of ourselves, our history, our legacy, trying to be the “ideal” American.\n\nAs a person of color whose grandparents immigrated to the United States, I see myself slowly losing my culture. The first thing that went was the clothes. Both my parents no longer wearing traditional Pakistani clothing. The second thing that left was the language. My parents never passing it down to me due to being shamed for not speaking English. I hope this picture helps people to understand that one’s culture is important and worth saving, even when you’re afraid and shamed for being “different”. Instead, we should be proud.\n\nAction Statement: I can encourage myself and other people to be more open-minded about wearing traditional clothing. We can normalize the representation of accurate traditional clothing in the media.\n\nSafe Protesting\n\nI took this image on November 7th at the Denver capital in Colorado as the Trump and Biden Presidential elections were happening. This was one of the first protests I’ve experienced as a young American and it scared me. I’ll be turning 18 in another year, and I want to be able to vote and protest peacefully. I fear that if we do not engage in peaceful protesting, protests will spiral out of control. We saw this happen at the Capital on January 6th, 2022. During this violent protest, five people were killed, as more than two thousand rioters attacked the capital building.\n\nAs I look at this image, I wonder about the future of protesting. Will there be armed guards at every corner? Will tear gas and riot shields be the norm? It’s not fair to young voters, like me, who want to safely express our right to speech, assembly, and expression of grievances. As a society we need to change our current approach to protests. We don’t need more riot armor, pepper spray, and rubber bullets. Instead, we need calm voices that are willing to express their needs peacefully and safely. Violence cannot be the only way to promote change.\n\nAction Statement: I can lead by good example and encourage the people in my community to calmly and peacefully join in protesting for other social justice issues. You can refuse to participate in protests that are violent while talking to people that frequently join in protests and encourage them to stray away from actions of violence and hate in order to make a change.\n\nUnlocking Vulnerability\n\nI don’t take photos of my surroundings very often. But when I do, it’s because it has meaning to me. I like to see things and picture a deeper meaning to them. I photographed a picture of a small snippet of hundreds of lockets all connected to one fence. I took this photo only focusing on the lockets themselves because that’s where all the narrative is. People come from all over the world to see it. This picture was captured in Paris, France. I took this photo because it made me wonder about all the personal stories connected to each and everyone of those lockets. Most of them have an initial plus another. Who are these people that have a locket? Are they lovers? Parent and child? Friends? Each locket connects to a story of two individuals. Each person who is putting a locket on, is sharing a piece of themselves and their person. It’s vulnerable. Instead of locking away their love and compassion inside, they’re putting it on a locket, and into it. Each locket represents love shared between two. Its brave and unprotected in theory. But the love is protected by the strong metal locket that will never break open. I hope seeing this photo made you think about how brave it is to share yourself with others, and why it’s the strongest thing you really could do.\n\nAction Statement: I can continue to advocate and show that being vulnerable is a strong emotion and makes you brave. We can encourage others to show their vulnerable side by normalizing vulnerability.\n\nFalse Sense of Serenity\n\nI took this picture with the idea of expressing the high expectations that every high schooler faces. Whether feeling pressure from coaches, teachers, parents, or peers, the universal truth is that society puts an overwhelming level of stress upon students. This year, I’ve taken on several difficult classes and joined many intensive extracurricular activities. This photo uses light and contrast in order to convey all the pressure students are under. I first started to understand the overwhelming expectations at the beginning of sophomore year, when I took AP US History, which, while being an extremely rewarding class, was difficult to succeed in as the workload was intense. This endeavor taught me how to be a successful and organized student, but for some, it soured them against school and caused them to give up. While students are constantly working, we are also still in the process of growing and learning and figuring out who we are. For some, these burdens cause overloads of stress, which can spark anxiety and other mental health issues. Mental health issues can lead to decreased focus, leading to lowered grades and decreased capacity for the normalized burdens. Adults often don’t understand this and keep pushing their children when that may be the worst thing that they can do. Many of my peers have suffered from this stress, and it can be very scary to go through this when one’s adults do not understand. It takes an incredible amount of creativity and stamina in order to succeed in the way that the adults in our lives want us to. I’ve had to come up with creative ways to complete the required amount of homework while still learning and doing my extracurriculars. I’ve mentally planned out essays while figuring out physics problems, practiced songs for choir while doing even more physics problems. While this photo may seem serene, the blaring light of the computer overshadows the real chaos on the desk. My current life is represented in this photo: Spanish and physics homework, pointe shoes on top of sheets and sheets of music. In spite of all of this, the photo seems serene. But if you look closely, under the surface, there is a storm of pressure. I hope that this photo helps to illuminate the incredible expectations for high schoolers, but to also provide understanding for the adults in our lives to have sympathy and compassion for us.\n\nAction Statement: I can do this by changing my mindset about how I deal with my workload, from feeling stressed about all the things I need to do, to feeling grateful for having these opportunities. We can do this by changing the fundamental way society views college admissions by increasing societal understanding of the pressure that students face.\n\nTighter\n\nI would always freak out when people asked me my dress or pant size. Negative self-talk would make its way to my head, eating me alive. Why did I think this way? When you look at your favorite TV shows or magazines, how thin are the women in them? I sadly couldn’t stop myself from comparing myself to them. And then, as I grew older, I realized that I wasn’t the only one comparing bodies, sadly lots of people do.\n\nOrchids are beautiful. When one looks at orchids, no matter how colorful, big, small, tall, or short, if they have a pattern on their petals or not, they are always loved. Why can’t it be like that with women’s bodies? If you are a size too big you are called fat, a size too small you are seen as sick, if you are too tall you are a giraffe, and if you are too short you look like a child. These measurements get tighter and tighter until at one point the flowers can’t breathe, and they fall. Why do we want a world with the same flowers, when we could have a world with a breath-taking variety?\n\nAction Statement: I can change the way I view myself by using affirmative language and appreciating more my body. We can break these standards by having more variety and inclusivity in social media, our communities, and our personal lives.\n\nA Choice\n\nLike many people my age, I have been consumed by social media. Social media has many issues, but I chose to represent one in my picture. With the spread of social media, so many options are shown to users. Whether it’s the opportunity to travel the world, or to pick up hundreds of new hobbies, the options become overwhelming to the point where sometimes it’s easier to just do nothing. By doing nothing, we start to get upset and frustrated that we can’t be productive, which causes us to shut down even more. This is known as the “Paradox of Choice”, where a person has so many options that the choice becomes stressful and hinders their decision-making. In my work, I overlayed two images. One of me lying in bed and the other of me sitting up in bed. This photo represents the way I feel when I am overwhelmed. Often, I have found myself in bed instead of finding something to do. I hope to let others who understand this feeling know that it’s okay to be overwhelmed easily, especially during a time where social media is controlling our lives.\n\nShedding Light\n\nI want to comment on the ignorance and lack of empathy our society shows towards homeless people. I believe we should engage in justice-oriented acts for people struggling in situations like this. I captured this picture to remind everybody, including myself, that even in the beautiful parts of where we live, there are deep inequities that we need to solve. The longer we continue to avoid finding a solution for this concern, the more we risk it becoming a norm in our society.\n\nMy image is of a place near Civic Stadium. Nearly every day I drive to the Stadium—a place that holds community track meets, graduation celebrations, and lively concerts—yet…still, I freeze for a second as I glance at these homes that are overshadowed by Civic’s presence. As a community, we have enjoyed the space of Civic so much, without realizing the homeless that also take refuge in this space. My hope is that by examining this image, and how it juxtaposes the two spaces, our community will give this pressing inequity the attention it deserves. Actions need to be taken, because everyone deserves a home.\n\nAction Statement: I can help this happen by engaging in homeless outreach programs, instead of pretending I don’t notice them. You can do this by calling attention to the homeless population and treating them like people, so that we all understand we need to find solutions around mental health & affordable housing.\n\nhttps://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lucy-Tervo_False-Sense-of-Serenity-scaled.jpeg 1536 2048 Christina Claassen https://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Website-Logo-300x101.png Christina Claassen2022-11-08 06:17:132023-06-15 16:52:54Picturing Justice: Youth Photographs for Social Action\n\nKatazome Today: Migrations of a Japanese Art\n\n/\n\nLightcatcher Building\n\nKatazome Today presents contemporary visions of a unique and historically significant Japanese textile-dyeing process. Traditionally used for kimono dyeing, katazome involves the application of a rice-paste resist using special stencil papers with complex designs. Both the techniques of katazome, and those of the intricately hand carved stencil papers (katagami), have been passed down through generations of artisans over several centuries.\n\nAlthough there is less demand for katazome products in Japan today, many artisans still practice it in its traditional form. The technique is increasingly gaining attention globally as contemporary artists explore katazome in new ways and see it as a form of artistic expression.\n\nIn this exhibition seven national and international artists share fresh perspectives on katazome through their current interpretations. They present a range of pictorial imagery, and non-traditional expressions such as large-scale installations and free-form painting techniques, relating katazome to themes of personal identity, shifting environments, and the globalization impacting the cultural landscapes of their home countries. The works preserve an endangered traditional technique while envisioning endless possibilities for dynamic cultural exchange.\n\nArtists featured include Akemi Cohn (Illinois), Melinda Heal (Australia), Fumiyo Imafuku (Japan), Cheryl Lawrence (Washington), John Marshall (California), Yuken Teruya (Germany), and Mika Toba (Japan). Katazome Today is co-curated by Seiko A. Purdue, Professor in Fibers/Fabrics at Western Washington University and Amy Chaloupka, Curator of Art at the Whatcom Museum. A 48-page exhibition catalog highlights the artists’ work in depth and is available for purchase at the Museum Store. A print and digital version of our gallery guide is also available for more information.\n\nTop image credit: Cheryl Lawrence; Snowstorm (diptych details), 2011.

Having grown up in Montana, she is familiar with land that stretches out in all directions under a big sky and where pine covered mountains skirt brutally desolate badlands.\n\nThe Montana landscape is omnipresent in her densely populated, story-filled paintings. Each mountain, stream, prairie, and butte is as much a character in the work as the human figures that teem within.\n\nNow a resident in Washington, where the impenetrable terrain emits a different kind of claustrophobic loneliness, the ferns, moss, mushrooms, and trees of this place make their way into her work. A multitude of encounters and experiences unfold through the varied painted scenes, leaving Heimer, as she puts it, “both bigger and smaller, more lost and more found.”\n\nLearn more about Heimer’s work from Nino Mier Gallery in Los Angeles, CA, or visit her website, www.andreajoyceheimer.com.\n\nhttps://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/echo.jpg 1006 1400 Christina Claassen https://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Website-Logo-300x101.png Christina Claassen2022-07-19 15:11:252023-01-09 09:41:50Andrea Joyce Heimer: Holy Mountain\n\nNew to the Collection: Carl Chew\n\n/\n\nLightcatcher Building\n\nIn conjunction with Un/Natural Selections: Wildlife in Contemporary Art, five new additions to the Whatcom Museum Collection by Seattle artist Carl Chew will be on display in the Lightcatcher building first floor hallway. Carl Chew has long studied the world through an absurdist lens. Known primarily for his “mail art” and collage, in 2019 the artist decided to apply his wild imagination to our regional landscape. The resulting imagery feels immediately familiar, and upon further inspection, also highly produced. The symmetry and cathedral-like compositions begin to become clearer. These works beg the question, how do we as humans respond to nature, understand nature, and organize it for our own spiritual and aesthetic consumption?\n\nIn Chew’s artist statement he says: Every April for 37 years my wife and I have taken a birdwatching walk along Wiley Slough, where the South Fork of the Skagit River enters Puget Sound. The glimmering wetlands there, rich with wildlife diversity, are for me a mystical place. In 2019 I wondered if an artist who had devoted most of his career to imaginative curiosity and humor could create a body of work worthy of the natural setting found in the Skagit Delta. Through the use of symmetry and layering of up to 20 mixed media images in each work, I felt I was able to penetrate into a realm where crows and landscape could share their secrets. And as I began to look at and share my new creations with others, I realized that those “secrets” had different and profound meanings for each viewer. The grand scale of the delta seemed to also demand artwork on a grand scale, so I decided to make some large tapestries. I located a weaver in North Carolina with a Jacquard loom controlled by a computer which could take my digital files directly and we began working together. The current result of this endeavor is four different tapestries and eleven prints.\n\nhttps://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Skagit-Delta-Beach-Party.jpg 1038 1400 Christina Claassen https://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Website-Logo-300x101.png Christina Claassen2022-07-15 16:34:002023-02-03 09:47:56New to the Collection: Carl Chew\n\nThe Scene: A Journey Through Bellingham’s Musical Past\n\n/\n\nOld City Hall\n\nFrom string bands on steamboats in the 1890s to alternative/indie rock bands today, for more than 100 years Bellingham’s music scene has embraced genres ranging from folk to classical to rock and roll and beyond. Located between the big cities of Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, Bellingham was and continues to be the sweet spot for performers both well-known and up-and-coming, where they can share their music with appreciative listeners in a more intimate environment. This exhibit presents a timeline of the styles, musicians, and venues that helped put Bellingham on the “music map.”\n\n“Seattle — what? New York — who cares? It’s all about Bellingham. That period of a year or two, I never wanted this scene to fall apart. I wanted this to live forever, because it felt so organic and special.” —Ben Gibbard, lead vocalist and guitarist, Death Cab for Cutie, The Seattle Times article “It’s all about Bellingham: How stars Death Cab for Cutie and ODESZA got their starts locally,” May 11, 2019, by Michael Rietmulder\n\nCreating a timeline of Bellingham’s Music History:\n\nHow do you take something so personal, vibrant, experiential, emotional, exhilarating, engaging, creative, and ethereal and tack it on a wall? That’s the challenge the Museum faced when trying to tell the story of Bellingham’s music scene. Through archival material, photographs, personal papers, oral histories, and more, curators added layers to the incredible stories that make up Bellingham’s musical history. Sandwiched between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., it makes sense that singers, musicians, bands, and other performers would want to make a stop in Bellingham along their tour routes. Through the decades, our community has been able to experience a variety of performers and musical styles, sparking interest and curiosity—from classical to blues, jazz to opera, and folk to rock. We hope this exhibit offers a brief, but entertaining overview of Bellingham’s rich musical history, and legacy.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum acknowledges that we gather on the traditional territory of the Lhaq’temish – Lummi People – and the Nuxwsá7aq – Nooksack People – who have lived in the Coast Salish region from time immemorial. The Museum honors our relationship with all of our Coast Salish neighbors and our shared responsibilities to their homeland where we all reside today.\n\nhttps://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Whatcom-Museum-1995.1.12942-Music-exhibit.jpg 1064 1400 Christina Claassen https://www.whatcommuseum.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Website-Logo-300x101.png Christina Claassen2022-05-21 13:31:482022-11-21 08:31:18The Scene: A Journey Through Bellingham’s Musical Past\n\nREDress Project Honoring Indigenous Women and People\n\n/\n\nLightcatcher Building\n\nThe Whatcom Museum is hosting an art installation in partnership with Whatcom Community College to honor and remember Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and People (MMIWP). Red dresses will be on display in the Lightcatcher Courtyard, representing the thousands of Native women, men, children, and non-binary people who go missing or are murdered each year.\n\nThe original “REDress Project” by artist and Métis Nation member Jaime Black began in Winnipeg in 2011 to draw attention to crime against Aboriginal women in Canada. The project has since spread to the US and calls attention to the lack of reporting, data, and justice for Native American women.\n\nJoin Lummi Victims of Crime on May 5, 2022 at noon for the annual MMIWP Memorial Walk at the Haxton/Kwina Roundabout (Lummi, WA 98226) in honor of missing or murdered local family members. Wear red to help raise awareness and show support to those struggling with the loss of a loved one.\n\nThe Memorial Walk will honor MMIWP from Lummi Nation: Carol Greene, Diana Humphreys-Ballew, Nancy Cook, Donald Cook, Lamar James, Melina Ghost, Essie Cagey, Ike Scarborough, Jessie Celestine, Darlene Celestine, Iva Smith, Lindsey Greene, Treston Jefferson, Andre Revey Jr., Valerie Jefferson, Casey Jo Tom, Arlene Keith, Tim Bowman, Michael Jordan, Kenneth Joseph, Joseph Cagey, Roberta George, Sophia Solomon, and Charlotte Solomon.\n\nThere is a lack of meaningful data collected on missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls. Some studies have been conducted, including in Whatcom County. The information is heartbreaking and triggering.\n\nWashington State was #2 in a study conducted by Urban Indian Health Institute.\n\nSeattle was #1 in a study conducted by Urban Indian Health Institute.\n\nNative women face murder rates 10 times above the national average. (wernative.org)\n\nNationally, 86% of sexual assaults against Native women are committed by non-Native men.\n\nNative women are the only population that is most likely to experience sexual assault by people outside their racial or ethnic group.\n\nLearn more about this issue by visiting the Urban Indian Health Institute website, www.uihi.org, and the National Indian Council on Aging website, nicoa.org.\n\nWatch a video by the the National Museum of the American Indian featuring artist Jaime Black (Métis), who talks more about this project: The REDress Project at the National Museum of the American Indian – YouTube\n\nChildren of the Setting Sun produced a video as a prayer to missing and murdered Indigenous women.

But a falling out between husband Bill Graham and poster artist Wes Wilson plunged her into the psychedelic art world of San Francisco in the mid-1960s. It was MacLean who stepped in to create posters promoting the bands who would become iconic with the counterculture movement of the time. MacLean initially borrowed from the Art Nouveau style of Wilson, but soon developed her own designs, featuring elaborate plumes, curving letters, and stoic faces. While MacLean was not recognized among the “big five” Haight-Ashbury poster artists who came to be associated with the iconography of the counterculture scene – Wes Wilson, Stanley Mouse, Alton Kelley, Victor Moscoso, and Rick Griffin – she stood out as one of the only women in the field. This exhibit pulls from the Museum’s incredible collection of psychedelic music posters from 1967.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum acknowledges that we gather on the traditional territory of the Lhaq’temish – Lummi People – and the Nuxwsá7aq – Nooksack People – who have lived in the Coast Salish region from time immemorial.

In 2021, Trautman presented a series of seven photographs taken as a single exposure with multiple projected images contained within. The works drew attention to the concepts of splitting and projection and their role in the history of interactions with the colonizer and the colonized. This spring Trautman will exhibit four new large-scale photographs in the Museum’s Lightcatcher entry hall.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum acknowledges that we gather on the traditional territory of the Lhaq’temish – Lummi People – and the Nuxwsá7aq – Nooksack People – who have lived in the Coast Salish region from time immemorial.

The exhibition Many Wests: Artists Shape an American Idea examines the perspectives of 48 modern and contemporary artists who offer a broader and more inclusive view of the West, which too often has been dominated by romanticized myths and Euro-American historical accounts.\n\nThis exhibition presents an opportunity to examine previous misconceptions, question racist clichés, and draw attention to the multiple communities and histories that continue to form this iconic region of the United States. Working in various media, from painting and sculpture to photography and mixed media, the artists featured bring a nuanced and multifaceted history into view. Many Wests highlights many voices, including artists who identify as Black, Indigenous, Asian American, Latinx, and LGBTQ+, who stake a claim in the American West.\n\nCentral Themes\n\nThe exhibition is presented in both English and Spanish, and organized around three central themes, Caretakers, Memory Makers, and Boundary Breakers. “Caretakers” examines how artists can redefine what it means to take care of themselves, their communities, and their futures. Featured artists include Ka’ila Farrell-Smith (Klamath Modoc), Awa Tsireh/Alfonso Roybal (San Ildefonso Pueblo), Patrick Nagatani, and Marie Watt (Seneca).\n\n“Memory Makers” explores how artists act as transmitters of cultural memory as they bring forth neglected histories of the West through their work, and includes artists Jacob Lawrence, Roger Shimomura, Christina Fernandez, and others.\n\n“Boundary Breakers” includes artists whose representations break away from myths of the West and assert their continued presence despite centuries of omission and erasure by mainstream culture. Featured artists include Angela Ellsworth, Raphael Montañez Ortiz (Apsáalooke/Crow), and Angel Rodríguez-Díaz.\n\nRip, Write, Reflect. Community Art Experience\n\nOngoing through Exhibition in the Lightcatcher first floor hallway\n\nAuburn-based artist Marita Dingus initiated a new art piece related to the exhibition for a community art experience called, “Rip, Write, Reflect.” Using found and repurposed materials, Dingus constructed a mixed-media wall tapestry. Visitors are invited to add their thoughts through words or drawings on torn map pieces, responding to a prompt about the West. Watch this video to learn more about this project, which is generously supported by Art Bridges.\n\nMulti-Institutional Partnership\n\nMany Wests is organized jointly by the Smithsonian American Art Museum and four nationally accredited art museums located in some of the fastest growing cities and states in the western region of the United States. It is the culmination of a five-year exhibition partnership made possible by the Art Bridges Foundation. The partner museums are the Boise Art Museum in Idaho; the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art in Eugene, Oregon; the Utah Museum of Fine Arts in Salt Lake City; and the Whatcom Museum. E. Carmen Ramos, acting chief curator and curator of Latinx art at the Smithsonian American Art Museum has led the collaborative curatorial effort.\n\nMany Wests features artwork drawn from the permanent collections of all five collaborating museums and the exhibition will be presented at all five venues. The multi-city national tour began at the Boise Art Museum (July 31 to Feb. 13, 2022). It travels to the Whatcom Museum (March 19 to Aug. 21, 2022), the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art (Sept. 26 to Dec. 31, 2022), and the Utah Museum of Fine Arts (Feb. 4 to June 11, 2023). The Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC, will be the final stop on the tour, where the exhibition will be on view from July 28, 2023 to Jan. 14, 2024.

This was what the rising metropolis would look like! Yet, with the collapse of the economy in 1893, the hotel soon symbolized Fairhaven’s failed dreams, and worse, false promises. Modernization efforts eventually stripped away its whimsical charm, rendering it a no-nonsense “business block.” Historical photographs follow the hotel from glorious beginning to smoldering ruin, displayed in Old City Hall along with surviving hotel treasures curated from the Museum’s collection.\n\nFairhaven Hotel: Anecdotes from the Archivist\n\nSunday, March 6, 1pm and Fridays, April 7, 14, 21, & 28, 4–5pm | Old City Hall\n\nIncluded with admission/members free\n\nJoin Photo Archivist Jeff Jewell for a discussion and tour of The Fairhaven Hotel exhibit at Old City Hall.

How will we wish to operate moving forward within our own bodies, and also in caring for and considering the bodies of others?\n\nThe exhibition Up Close & Personal examines the human body through the expressive lens of 60 artists. Some explore the many ways we communicate with one another—through facial expression, body language, self-presentation, and performance. Others boldly envision narratives and representations of the self through the use of their own bodies in their work. Artists are acutely aware that all bodies reside at the dynamic intersection of gender, class, race, sexuality, age, and ability. These compelling portrayals of the figure are situated at these crossroads of identity and point toward countless possibilities for human connection and understanding.\n\nUp Close & Personal is generously presented from the renowned collection of Driek and Michael Zirinsky. The dynamic selection of work, expressing a range of processes and ideas, allows visitors to get up close and personal with the mindset of the artists as represented in the selections of these lifelong collectors of art.\n\nThis exhibition is supported in part by Heritage Bank, the Whatcom Museum Foundation, and the City of Bellingham. Media sponsorship provided by Cascade Public Media KCTS 9.\n\nTo complement the exhibition, the Museum will host a companion exhibit at Old City Hall, Artists x Artists, that explores intimate portraits of artists by artists.

In an homage to its origins in Chinese folklore, Rodriguez has reimagined the classic zodiac animals as analogous creatures of Mexican origin, bridging cultures and creating new narratives.\n\nEl Zodíaco Familiar—the fifth iteration of Rodriguez’s Mexican Zodiac series—invites 13 Mexican and ChicanX/Chicane artists of various artistic disciplines to respond to Rodriguez’s animal sculptures with the forms, tools, and aesthetics of their own artistic practices. Each artist has imbued their collaboratively-imagined sculpture, corresponding to the zodiac animal of their birth year, with personal perspective, folk tradition, and an intimate feeling of celebration. While each sculpture is as distinct as its maker, taken together, the twelve pieces vibrate with deep resonances of the familiar.\n\nThe Participating Artists and their zodiacs:\n\nMoises Salazar–Chapulín\n\nMarilyn Montufar–Toro\n\nAlejandra Carrillo-Estrada–Jaguar\n\nSamirah Steinmeyer–Cacomixtle\n\nYosimar Reyes–Quetzalcoatl\n\nEric J.

Fifty years later, the region’s glass community has expanded significantly, defined by shared knowledge, teamwork, and an experimental spirit.\n\nDrawing from the Museum’s permanent collection, loans from artists, and working in close partnership with Museum of Glass (Tacoma, Wash.), Fluid Formations celebrates the innovation and striking range of processes and ideas that could only come from decades of generous exchange and shared passion for the material of glass. Check out the Gallery Guide to see the variation of works that were featured in this exhibition.\n\nAlso on exhibit:\n\nKids Design Glass is a longstanding program that Museum of Glass has hosted since 2002 where kids aged 12 and under can submit their creative drawings to be transformed into glass sculptures. The Whatcom Museum has several of these kid-designed glass artworks located throughout our campus, including Green Guy, designed by Duncan Noah (age 11) and made by Museum of Glass Hot Shop team members.

The pictures in this exhibition are deliberately featured with their accumulation of scratches, cracks, lost corners, mold stains, and water damage. Though marred, time ravaged negatives can still render images of historical significance.\n\nWe are bringing this exhibit back, but to Old City Hall, for another opportunity to enjoy and appreciate these unique images\n\nFeatured image: Wading in at Squalicum Beach, Bellingham Bay, c. 1910.

Edson Hall of Birds, the contemporary masterpieces in the art collection, the Photo Archives, or the treasures in the history collection. Perhaps lesser known is the incredible clothing collection that includes examples of historic garments spanning from the 1800s through the mid-20th century.\n\nHistoric clothing has the ability to transport people to a different time or place, to sense that these items were worn by real people, and to imagine oneself in their midst. All Dressed Up… highlights some of the more colorful examples of artistry as fashion in the Museum’s collection. The exhibit showcases items of clothing that would have been worn “out on the town,” such as a stunning blue striped silk dress with off-white satin banding from the 1910s and the dramatic 1928 lavender full-length chiffon gown worn by the artist Helen Loggie.\n\nAn array of vintage designer evening shoes will also be on display, as well as an assortment of antique fashion accessories. Allow yourself to be immersed in the styles and color palettes of the past century and to contemplate the significance of getting “all dressed up” for an occasion, for company, or just for oneself.\n\nCollections Curator Maria Coltharp offers a quick overview and tour of some of the garments in this exhibition.

This exhibition focuses on kimono-inspired objects that have come into the Whatcom Museum’s collection over the last fifty years.\n\nPrimarily from Bellingham community members, this collection shows their strong interest in this fashion trend. These textile creations reveal American designers’ ingenuity in adapting aspects of the kimono for Western use. They also show the savvy of Japanese designers in anticipating Western demand and creating clothing designed to suit American and European lifestyles.\n\nFrom a child’s pink crepe robe to an evening gown with “kimono” sleeves, these garments offer us a glimpse of this fashion frenzy, and the various ways in which it translated into novel patterns of wear in our very own community.\n\nThe Whatcom Museum acknowledges that we gather on the traditional territory of the Lhaq’temish – Lummi People – and the Nuxwsá7aq – Nooksack People – who have lived in the Coast Salish region from time immemorial.

From the past to our shared present, matriarchal figures have an enduring importance.\n\nAs part of the project, we invited community members to share a photo of a matriarch important to them. Submissions were accepted during March and are now displayed below. We’re excited to share these photographs with you, along with words from the photographers.\n\nDo you see your photo and would like to add more information?

Wilbur has selected the striking photographs from among the thousands of portraits she has taken in recent years, including a new special selection from local Tribes. Elders, activists, educators, culture-bearers, artists, and students have shared with Wilbur their realities as Native women to convey how ancestral and contemporary identities shape their hopes and dreams.\n\nAs Wilbur explains, “I believe the viewers will experience great insight and connection with these remarkable women, just as they have enlightened and inspired me. Native women are traditionally the stewards of the vital relationship with land, and have remained principal advocates for Mother Earth, from fracking protests to upholding vital matrilineal values. By sharing the astonishing variety of the Indigenous presence and understanding, we will build cultural bridges, abandon stereotypes, and renew and inspire our national legacy.”\n\nAbout Matika Wilbur\n\nMatika Wilbur, one of the Pacific Northwest’s leading photographers, has exhibited extensively in regional, national, and international venues such as the Seattle Art Museum, the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, The Tacoma Art Museum, the Royal British Columbia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Nantes Museum of Fine Arts in France. She studied photography at the Rocky Mountain School of Photography in Montana and received a bachelor’s degree from Brooks Institute of Photography in California. Her work led her to becoming a certified teacher at Tulalip Heritage High School, providing inspiration for the youth of her own Indigenous community. Wilbur, an Indigenous woman belonging to Swinomish and Tulalip Tribes, is unique as an artist and social documentarian in Indian Country—the insight, depth, and passion with which she explores the contemporary Native identity and experience are communicated through the impeccable artistry of each of her silver gelatin photographs. Her collection of photographs and narratives from Project 562 is soon to be published by Ten Speed Press/Random House.
