        "text": "2.1 Visual Arts for Blind People\n\nVisual arts is an umbrella term for a broad category of art, including fine arts, contemporary arts, decorative arts, and crafts [32]. These artworks heavily rely on visual perceptions to encode their meaning, and many assume that blind people do not and cannot enjoy visual arts [11]. However, blind individuals’ interests and desires to visit museums and enjoy visual arts are commonly observed and reported in literature [7, 11, 21, 48, 51]. As commented in the resource guidebook for art, creativity, and visual impairments: “Art Beyond Sight”—“Some have a lust for shape and space and form, just as others are moved deeply by music, or nature” [11], not every blind individual enjoys visual arts, yet everyone ought to be able to access it. Past scholars who promoted art education for blind people provided a set of benefits of engaging in visual arts appreciation, including access to important cultural information, aesthetic enjoyment, and also stimuli to personal development—such as critical thinking skills honed through analyzing and interpreting artworks, cooperative learning obtained from appreciating and creating art in groups, self-awareness, and self-confidence [11]. In particular, Eisner [11] proposed that experiencing visual arts could bring positive impact to blind people, by improving Braille reading skills, mobility and map-reading skills, tactile exploration skills, development of texture sensitivity, socialization skills, and improved integration into the local community. However, the needs of blind people in visual arts have been long neglected, with “policy makers and arts managers failing to understand the nature of the need” and “educators overprotecting blind students” from being overwhelmed [11]. Our paper extends efforts to make visual arts appreciation non-visually accessible, by inquiring about blind people's perceptions of the opportunities and limitations of emerging technologies for non-visual engagement with visual arts.\n\n2.2 Art Museum Accessibility for Blind People\n\nMany blind people who are interested in visual arts visit art museums and galleries, which in turn have gradually increased non-visual arts access with ongoing effort from disability activists [9, 41, 120]. Being able to physically visit art venues is important to many art patrons, as doing so provides social, cultural, and emotional influences only made possible by being present in the same space as the artwork and being a part of the interaction with other visitors [11, 51]. Recently, there has been increasing legislative effort in the US and Europe toward equal access of art (e.g., Americans with Disability Act [93], Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 27) [10, 89, 114]), and art museums are gradually becoming more accessible to blind people [9, 41, 120]. Still, accessibility standards are rarely enforced in art museums and galleries, and merely meeting these standards does not necessarily provide experiences for blind people that meet their expectations [63, 86, 120, 123].\n\nTo visit an art museum or gallery, one common approach for blind visitors is through specialized, guided tours, often with a docent or a sighted companion who provides navigation support and describes the artwork [9, 62, 92]. However, these tours often require the blind patrons to show up on a specific day or need reservation ahead of time [25, 91, 122]. Beyond guided tours, pre-recorded audio descriptions of art pieces have become common in museums and galleries [45], albeit designed primarily for sighted visitors [9]. To further support blind patrons with more direct experiences, some museums provide tactile options for blind visitors, such as tactile replicas, graphs, or braille-based brochures and tags [1, 4, 120, 124]. In reality, these art programs that provide touchable artwork and tailored descriptions are rare among art museums [25]. To support blind people navigating in the museum, prior research has explored location tracking, audio notifications, and voice descriptions to inform blind visitors about obstacles, wayfinding, and descriptions of visual art pieces [9, 61, 84, 99]. In this paper, we explore blind people's overall experiences with visual arts under different contexts and their preferences for appreciating visual arts.\n\n2.3 Technological Support of Visual Art Access for Blind People\n\nBelow, we expand on new technological innovations to support non-visual appreciation of visual arts, structured into three categories: tactile tools (Section 2.3.1), audio descriptions (Section 2.3.2), and interactive multimodal presentations (Section 2.3.3).\n\n2.3.1 Tactile Tools. Touching is one of the main methods for blind people to access visual arts, such as through tactile graphics—graphics made using raised lines and textures to convey drawings and images [24, 25, 55]. Without prior training, blind people can capture the sizes, shapes, and location of essential details through touching outlines of objects, which is often faster than decoding descriptions of such details [11, 64]. An experienced tactile graphic consumer can identify patterns of shadow and light in artworks [11], and the sense of touch can produce accurate and complete characteristics of objects with training [83]. However, tactile graphics can be less effective in expressing visual information of complex images [14]. Therefore, tactile graphics are suitable for simple graphs and diagrams with objects’ spatial relationship being important [15, 25]. Still, there have been efforts toward using tactile graphics for complex visual information, such as color [31], comics [36, 42], and also visual artwork [54]. However, producing tactile graphics that effectively present complex visual information requires time and skill from professionals, and thus is mostly unavailable, or low-quality [48, 86, 123]. Recently, there have been attempts to auto-generate tactile graphics or 3D reproductions through AI algorithms [26, 39, 88, 90, 124]. Although the quality of such products is still not always ensured, it has the potential to increase tactile access to art in scale. Other challenges of tactile graphics include inadequate educational resources for blind people to learn to consume tactile arts properly [115], the difficulty of maintaining tactile arts [86], stigma and restrictions related to touch [23, 68, 115], and copyright infringement related to reproducing visual media in tactile form [55].\n\n2.3.2 Audio Descriptions. Audio description is another common way for blind people to learn more about visual art pieces, often pre-recorded on either a personal device or a device prepared by the venue [2, 11, 34, 50, 86]. Audio descriptions are now available in many museums, but are often designed for sighted visitors, and thus still present accessibility barriers for blind visitors [2]. Audio descriptions can usually provide accurate spatial understanding and details of an artwork [25, 90]. Comparatively, “verbal imaging”—art descriptions tailored and read by curators of the art venues for blind people—are more compelling but very rarely found [11]. One way of improving understanding through audio descriptions is to provide multiple levels of descriptions, ranging from general information, to fine-grained details [2, 87]. The other way of improving understanding through audio descriptions consults general image description generation techniques [2]. To better improve the quality of auto-generated artwork description, past work has also incorporated eye gaze and discussion data from sighted viewers to create rich descriptions for image areas that people tend to pay attention to [104, 111]. Huh et al. [57] further proposed using comments online to automatically generate image descriptions of webtoons (i.e., digital comics) and allow blind readers to request information in a question-and-answer format. Moreover, there are attempts to use sound design to better present comics instead of only verbal descriptions [113]. Given these technological explorations on audio descriptions, it remains unknown how blind people adopt different audio description methods, and what their associated perceptions and challenges are when using audio descriptions for visual art access.\n\n2.3.3 Interactive Multimodal Presentations. Because audio descriptions and tactile tools are limited in delivering visual information, there have been increasing proposals to provide multimodal presentations of visual arts for blind people, mostly combining audio descriptions and tactile tools [2, 26, 59]. Such a multimodal approach also benefits art interpretation, as the non-visual medium used for presenting visual arts could often influence the message and intention expressed [25]. Multimodal approaches to experiencing visual arts also can influence the message and intent expressed in non-visually describing artworks [25]. A range of system innovations further added interactivity to these multimodal presentations to help blind people understand visual arts through exploration [4, 25, 31, 54, 74, 103, 121]. Such interactivity is argued to be important, as “The goal of my art is to cause a reaction when someone sees it, they (viewers) should think, they should react. That's what experiencing art is” [25]. For example, recent innovations allow users to perform specific touch gestures on the artwork surface, lift up an item, or press buttons to get localized descriptions or related audio elements as they go [4, 25, 30, 54, 74, 103, 121]. Last, a range of virtual, internet-based technologies allow remote visual artwork appreciation for blind people. For example, Howell and Porter [56] proposed to provide home-printed tactile presentations together with online audio guides of artworks to blind people.\n\nWhile prior research has explored various technological approaches to access visual arts, it still remains unknown how these methods are adopted by people in the blind community under different contexts, including their preferences among different access technologies and design implications towards more accessible and enjoyable art experiences. Building upon existing visual arts accessing methods, this paper bridges these gaps.\n\n4.1 In-Person Experiences\n\nThe most common way for our participants to engage with visual arts is to visit art galleries and museums in person (N=14). Participants commonly expressed interest in paintings, drawings, and photography exhibited in galleries and museums, and they primarily rely on four non-visual approaches to access these artworks: descriptions from sighted peers or docents (N=14), pre-recorded audio descriptions (N=9), tactile graphics (N=6), and interactive smart device support (N=2).\n\nAmong these approaches, participants strongly preferred descriptions from sighted peers or docents, as they could ask questions and get answers immediately from a real person, as P7 commented:\n\n“...Having a person with me allows me to ask whatever questions about different art pieces that I have. I could then receive answers immediately...”\n\nHowever, P10 and P14 commented on the learning curve for training sighted people to properly explain visual arts to a blind person, as P10 explained:\n\n“...My cousin initially took me to the art gallery to cheer me up. I appreciate that, but the initial experience was terrible, I barely got anything from her explanation...I remember she just said that this painting has two trees and a farmer between the trees. It takes her two years to provide the details that I would like to know from paintings...such as the correct color shades, visual references of different objects, and interactions between objects...”\n\nThe second most adopted approach is pre-recorded audio descriptions provided by art galleries or museums. One challenge our participants experienced with existing audio description technologies is the additional effort involved, such as the need to scan QR codes and stand exactly in front of the painting. Existing audio descriptions are also mostly designed for sighted patrons, and thus lack detailed descriptions needed for blind people to understand the visual artwork. P7 commented:\n\n“...Many audio devices I got from art galleries are designed for sighted people. For example, the descriptions do not typically include any visual references, they mentioned several attributes, like houses and trees, but without including where they are, what colors they were painted...”\n\nFor tactile graphics, our participants experienced two main challenges. First, tactile graphics are not available in many art galleries and museums. P6 talked about her limited experiences with tactile graphics in her 70 years of art experiences:\n\n“...I have over 70 years experiences of art, I can say that I only had opportunities to try tactile art at the Chicago Art Museum (the Art Institute of Chicago). They are just not common...”\n\nSecond, some participants find it particularly time-consuming to access visual arts through tactile graphics, as P12 explained:\n\n“...It usually takes 15 to 20 minutes to feel a tactile painting, sometimes, it is even longer depending on the details of the painting...”\n\nTwo participants also mentioned the use of smart device supports (e.g., visual interpretation technologies such as Be My Eyes and Aira) to identify what is in an artwork (e.g., subject matters, activities, shapes, colors). While these tools are versed at explaining visual concepts to blind people, they often lack expertise in visual arts. P15 explained:\n\n“...I found people of BeMyEyes generally have difficulties expressing artwork properly, such as color shades...”\n\nExisting visual interpretation tools are also not specifically designed to provide descriptions for artworks, and thus often miss important contextual information in them, as P7 commented:\n\n“...I tried to use some object recognition or image description apps on my phone, it mostly tells me things like there are two people, one sword, and one horse. There is almost no contextual information of the painting, such as who is holding the sword, what are the interactions between the two people...”\n\nBecause of these aforementioned access challenges with in-person art experiences, our participants mostly stick with the same gallery or museum if they found it to be relatively accessible (as mentioned by six of our participants). Repeated visits to the same venue not only help the staff get familiarized with steps to make the experience accessible, but also bring emotional value to our blind patrons. For example, P11 mentioned:\n\n“...I usually visit the same art gallery close to my place, the staff there know me pretty well and always reach out to me to ask if I need anything. I feel at home there...”\n\nP3 further commented on how visiting the same venue helps consolidate understanding of specific art pieces and reduces uneasy social tensions:\n\n“...Going to the same art gallery and enjoy(ing) old artwork can help me recall my past memory and enhance [my] understanding of specific art pieces. This makes me feel less discriminated and I could confirm my understanding with docents there...Just like you always get new feelings and inspirations every time you see Mona Lisa...”\n\nIn summary, our participants’ in-person art appreciation experiences leverage many existing non-visual approaches for presenting visual arts, as introduced in the related work (Section 2), but with peer- and docent-guided tours being the most commonly adopted. We confirmed on the overall lack of accessibility infrastructures (e.g., tactile graphics) documented in prior work [25] and uncovered a common workaround to this problem—familiarizing with and visiting the same art venue over time. We also presented a range of challenges that made their experiences less accessible or made some of these approaches less commonly adopted. One overarching problem is the quality of artwork descriptions, whether it missed descriptions of elements important to artworks or lacked intuitive explanations of visual concepts to blind people. This insight extends prior research on Remote Sighted Assistance (RSA) regarding the need for domain knowledge of specific tasks [72].\n\n4.2 Remote Experiences\n\nBeyond going to art galleries and museums, remote art tours have become increasingly available and popular during COVID-19, and three participants mentioned that they had experiences going to Zoom art tours (P7, P14, P15). They highlighted the benefit of remote tours as a convenient opportunity for blind people to understand visual arts with professional docents, especially during the pandemic. For example, P7 shared his experiences:\n\n“...I had several experiences with Zoom tours for blind people to enjoy art. I want to say that it has the benefit of accommodating over 300 people at a time, and the docents are usually more professional than normal...because there are usually limited docents that are trained on how to describe visual arts to blind people...”\n\nHowever, participants also mentioned the limitations of remote art tours as the lack of engagement and communication, and do not feel as immersive as in-person tours. P15 commented:\n\n“...there are clear differences compared with in-person experiences. You definitely feel more close to the art if you actually stand in front of it. And you cannot really do much besides listening to the docent from the remote tour...”\n\nSome participants choose to leverage a combination of remote and in-person access to engage with visual arts, so they can utilize the advantages of both. In particular, P3, P4, and P13 mentioned the benefit of searching specific visual arts pieces online to learn more details about them (e.g., history, artists’ background) after visiting an art gallery or museum, as P3 explained:\n\n“...There is often limited time at art galleries, and the audio descriptions are not often comprehensive enough. I often memorize the visual arts name and come back home and search for it online...”\n\nThe increase in remote opportunities for blind people to access visual arts brings attention to the accessibility, engagement, and interactivity of these methods. Our findings provide insights into what blind people enjoy about current remote visual arts accesses (e.g., access to more contextual information, ability to look up and learn more about the art, flexibility in the amount of time), and what challenges they face with them (e.g., less immersive than in-person experiences).\n\n5.1 Motivation for Engaging with Visual Arts\n\nOur participants have a diverse set of reasons for engaging with visual artworks, including: 1) cultural learning, 2) encouragement, 3) activism, 4) social interactions, 5) relaxation and enjoyments, and 6) nostalgic reasons.\n\nFirst, four participants mentioned that appreciating visual arts brings opportunities for cultural learning, as in communicating different individuals’ stories to society (P5, P8, P12, P15). These participants are more interested in the background stories and meaning behind visual artworks. P5 explained:\n\n“...The goal for me to enjoy art is to understand the story and cultural background of different art pieces from different periods. Paintings and pictures are very language independent that you do not need to understand the language that the artists speak to appreciate their paintings...”\n\nWe also found that seven participants consider enjoying visual arts as a way of encouragement and inspiration, especially after their vision loss. P14 mentioned:\n\n“...My friend brought me to an art gallery right after my vision loss, at that time, I was so depressed that do not even want to step out of my place. Going to the art gallery and getting descriptions from my friend, and discussing different art pieces definitely helped me relieve my stress and discomfort...”\n\nIn particular, three participants perceive visual arts for activism purposes, such as showing sighted people that blind people can also enjoy visual arts at art galleries. P15 highlighted on this:\n\n“...I really like to go to art galleries with my glasses and cane on, this identifies that I am a blind person and shows to other sighted people that blind people can also appreciate arts. This would increase the awareness of the importance of art accessibility...”\n\nMoreover, four participants consider going to art galleries as part of social activities where they could communicate and discuss visual arts with their peers (P3, P4, P11, P14). P3 commented:\n\n“...Enjoy art can help me with social interaction with other blind people, that is why it is important to understand the detail...We often visit different art galleries together as a social event...”\n\nWe also found that three participants appreciate visual arts for relaxation and enjoyment (P7, P11, P15), as P7 commented:\n\n“...Exploring art is simple to me, I feel relaxed and connected to the environment while I am in art galleries. It is very similar to watching a movie or playing a game...”\n\nFinally, three participants also engaged with visual arts to recall past memories of people, objects, and events, for nostalgic reasons. For example, P9 spends significant time with a specific piece of visual art in memory of his wife, who had passed away (Figure 1):\n\n“...This tactile art was made by an artist to help me recall my wife, who already passed away many years ago. Every time I touched it, I could feel her face and expression, and remember our past memory together...”\n\nWhile prior work has listed a range of potential benefits for blind people to non-visually engage with visual arts, we directly consulted blind art patrons’ personal perspectives about what aspects of visual arts attract them. Our findings suggest a degree of variance across individuals but point to a set of recurring motivators, many unique to blind people (e.g., activism, nostalgia, and inspiration after losing sight). These motivators serve as contexts for understanding participants’ experiences and preferences with different modes of non-visual visual arts presentations.\n\n5.2 Cognition of Perceiving Visual Arts\n\nHere, we present what makes visual arts appreciation aesthetically enjoyable to our participants. First, six participants expressed that they enjoy visual arts through imaginations based on existing visual knowledge and discussing their imaginations with sighted peers (P3, P4, P7, P10, P12, P14). P3 explained:\n\n“...I used to have vision when I was young, and I currently enjoy art by imagining from the information I know, such as people, activity, and the environment. I then think about what type of color they might use, or the facial expressions, I imagine everything that I am not told. The magic part is confirming my imagination with sighted friends or family members. And it is totally fine if I am wrong, I still like my imagination on how this artwork should be...”\n\nWe found that most participants who experience aesthetic enjoyment through imagination are also people who acquired blindness later on, whereas participants who are congenitally blind have difficulties imagining visual concepts, such as understanding visual references and dimensions. For these participants, the enjoyment instead comes from tactile feeling of the artwork and surrounding environment. P1 commented:\n\n“...I enjoy touching visual paintings to feel the texture of the painting and even the gallery or museum building to get the atmosphere of the environment. This brings more connections between me and the artwork...”\n\nFurthermore, some participants also mentioned that enjoyment brought by visual arts is different when accessed through imagination versus tactile renderings. P9 explained:\n\n“...A tactile version of a drawing or painting does not mean the same thing as the original artwork, it is a reproduction with different meanings and feelings...”\n\nIn sum, our analysis of blind participants’ perception of visual arts draws attention to their personal experience (e.g., visual memory), motivation, as well as the presentation mode of visual arts. All these factors influence how aesthetic and artistic visual arts experiences are for blind people.\n\n6.4 Enhance Objective Interpretation\n\nParticipants commonly reflected that visual descriptions provided by friends, family, and docents include subjective opinions, making it difficult for them to have individual interpretations of the artwork. This challenge especially interferes with people who consider imagination as a way to enjoy the visual art piece (as described in Section 5). Instead, they shared the preference for more objective and factual descriptions of the visual arts content, style, and subjects. P2 voiced out this preference:\n\n“...I prefer to get a perception of the artwork from my own experiences, I do not want to hear personal comments from people, just like this or that painting is so pretty and meaningful, all I need is what color they used, the contours of the lines, and what kinds of objects present in the painting...”\n\nThis preference for fact-based information also applies to services provided by smart devices and remote access methods (as described in Section 4). P3 explained:\n\n“...I used to search the detailed content for better understanding of visual arts by searching online through my iPhone, but people usually posted their own feelings and thoughts online regarding certain artwork, this would ruin my whole experiences of arts and destroy my imagination of arts. And there is no such way for me to actually filter it, so I stopped doing that...”\n\nOne workaround many participants mentioned for improving the objectivity of non-visual visual art access is tactile graphics, despite it being more time-consuming and less accessible for some people (as described in Section 4). This finding confirms the importance of tactile media availability and education (as suggested in previous work such as [37, 115]), but also emphasizes the possibility of making non-tactile approaches more objective.\n\n6.6 Describe Visual Arts Based on Individual Memory\n\nPast experience with visual arts is another consideration that our participants often mentioned. Besides the preference for familiar art venues (as described in Section 4), participants also want their art descriptions to incorporate what they have learned about visual arts in the past, including visual concepts and artwork information. For example, P7 and P12 want the system to provide explanations and links to the visual arts that they know already, as P7 explained:\n\n“...Every time I see a new painting, it would be useful for the description to refer to certain colors or artistic styles that I have experienced before. This would reduce the time and effort of the descriptions...”\n\nMoreover, how much and what details to include in the description should also adjust to blind art patrons’ memory. For example, it would be beneficial to insert a reminder for blind patrons to quickly know which art pieces they have encountered previously. P6 commented on this issue:\n\n“...I like to go to the same art gallery to recall my past memory and emphasize my understanding of my favorite paintings. I usually have to ask the surroundings about the painting's name to identify specific artwork. It would be great if I have a system that can tell me when did I interact with this painting and what information did I get last time...”\n\nTaking past memory into consideration can be particularly beneficial for blind patrons who are in the process of learning visual arts concepts and have difficulties quickly scanning artwork to assess whether they have seen them.\n\n6.7 Maintain Synchronous Feedback\n\nFrom the interviews, we identified two types of feedback deemed essential by blind patrons (N=13) in our study—(1) answers to questions they have about an artwork and (2) comments and discussions of peer patrons (whether sighted or not) about the artwork. Currently, opportunities to clarify details and ask for further details are generally lacking for most access methods (e.g., audio descriptions, and guided tours). For example, P14 explained:\n\n“...It is hard to verify the audio descriptions by us who are blind, and we cannot ask further questions for audio descriptions if we do not fully understand the content...”\n\nSimilarly, P5 experienced difficulty asking questions during guided tours with docents too:\n\n“...It can be stressful for me to ask questions to docents and sighted peers when I am in a group of people...”\n\nComparatively, listening to other patrons’ discussions of artworks is relatively more accessible at art galleries or museums. Many participants expressed their desire to learn about others’ interpretation of an artwork, after obtaining an objective understanding of the piece, as P4 commented on this:\n\n“...After sort of getting to know the artwork and the message behind it, I love to discuss and verify my thoughts with other people, this sometimes can help me add more detailed understandings of the painting...”\n\nAs our interviews point to the importance of communication during visual arts experiences, systems for supporting blind patrons should make efforts to improve and encourage social feedback.\n\n6.8 Destigmatize Art Experiences in Social Settings\n\nWhile participants highlighted the importance of social communication and feedback for blind visual arts patrons, they also noted that there is social tension when they enjoy visual arts with sighted people. P11 commented:\n\n“...I do not feel comfortable to keep asking questions during a guided tour with a group of people, it is just too stressful to me to actually enjoy arts...”\n\nEven if they do not engage in social interactions, blind patrons experience stigma with the way they access visual arts (e.g., touching). Our participants commonly expressed the importance for blind people to present in front of sighted patrons and use tactile methods to explore visual arts, to remove the stigma of touch. P6 explained:\n\n“...I like to use tactile graphics in front of other sighted folks, I can show them that blind people can also understand and appreciate visual arts through touch. This would reduce the stigma associated with touch and promote the availability of tactile graphics for visual arts...”\n\nOverall, with the eight design considerations proposed by our participants, our findings further extend prior research on non-visual access to visual information (e.g., [67, 115]), with a focus on blind patrons’ unique experiences with visual arts. With insights on what access methods blind patrons currently adopt, their motivations, challenges, as well as considerations for better non-visual visual arts experiences, we would like to examine how our findings apply broadly to other general blind patrons, including blind people with different backgrounds and vision statuses (e.g., people who are congenitally blind versus who acquired blindness in later life).\n\n7.1 Method\n\n7.1.1 Survey Recruitment. We recruited survey respondents through the NFB (i.e., National Federation of the Blind) mailing list. To participate in our survey study, the participant needed to be 1) 18 years or older, 2) legally or totally blind, 3) have experiences in visual arts appreciation, and 4) be able to communicate in English. The survey was hosted through Google Forms [46]. The survey took about 10 minutes per respondent, and survey respondents who completed the survey were entered into a draw for a $20 Amazon gift card (1 in every 30). The recruitment and study procedure was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).\n\n7.1.2 Survey Questions. In the survey, we first asked participants screening questions to check whether they meet the previously mentioned recruitment criteria. We then asked for demographic information (e.g., age, gender, details of vision level, onset age of blindness). Next, we asked participants to select up to three preferred methods to access visual arts (according to Section 4), motivations for engaging in visual arts experience, and sources of aesthetic enjoyment during such experience (according to Section 5). Finally, we asked participants to select up to three design considerations that they consider the most important for making their visual arts experiences better (according to Section 6). For clarification and ease of understanding, we added examples and explanations of our design considerations in the survey (such as “have a clear art description standard discussed and agreed with describers, such as what vocabularies to use” instead of “establish shared art vocabulary and grammar”). To potentially reduce biases, we randomized all answers for all questions. We also added an item for survey questions called “none of these options” and allowed people to enter their own answers under “other” in text if they have any.\n\n7.1.3 Data and Analysis. Two researchers manually sorted through all 423 responses and the ones that fall under the following categories: 1) incomplete survey (N=4), 2) duplicate or malicious entries (e.g., a series of entries with the same age, gender, onset of blindness within a few seconds) (N=178), 3) response failing to follow the instruction (e.g., respondents select over three answers for questions we have “Please choose up to three answers”) (N=21). Our data cleaning resulted in 220 valid entries (i.e., 52.0% of original entries).\n\nBecause the goal of this survey is to examine visual arts experiences and preferences learned from our interview with a wider population, our analysis focuses on a descriptive summary of trends across the 220 blind art patrons who answered our survey. For each of the four areas of focus: motivation , preferred access methods , sources of enjoyment , and design consideration prioritization , we first summarize the popularity of answer choices among respondents and then compare them across two demographic factors: vision level and the onset of blindness to understand how our findings vary across these factors through inferential statistical tests. Choosing these two factors was determined by our findings from the semi-structured interview (Section 3), such as participants with different blindness onset have different preferences for visual art access methods (Section 6). Due to the multiple-response nature of our questions, we treat each answer choice of a question as a binary variable (i.e., if a respondent selected this choice, the value is yes, otherwise no.) and perform chi-squared tests [95] to examine the association between the selection of this choice and the two demographic factors of interest (i.e., vision level and the onset of blindness). For testing associations with the onset of blindness, we construct a 2x2 contingency table ( Onset of Blindness (Congenital, Acquired) x Choice Selection (yes, no)), whereas for testing associations with vision level, we construct a 2x3 contingency table ( Vision Level (Totally blind, Some light perception, Legally blind) x Choice Selection (yes, no)). We use a Bonferroni correction [20] to reduce the chance of a Type I error when performing multiple tests [8].\n\n7.2 Results\n\n7.2.1 Survey Respondents Demographic Information. All 220 respondents self-reported to be at least legally blind—86 as “legally blind”, 90 as “some light perception”, and 44 as “totally blind (no light perception).” 42 of the survey respondents are congenitally blind (acquired blindness since birth). For the remaining 178 participants, the average onset of blindness was 18.96 years old (SD = 12.04). 114 respondents self-identified as male, 102 as female, and 2 preferred not to report gender. The average age of respondents is 34.6 years old (SD = 12.4). All 220 respondents stated having experience engaging with visual arts.\n\n7.2.2 Preferred Methods. In terms of different methods to access visual arts, we found visiting an art venue with tactile access (N = 144) and sighted help (N = 141) are still the most preferred access methods to visual arts by the majority of respondents (Table 3), closely followed by assistance from smart devices at the venue (N = 128). Only half of the respondents found pre-recorded audio descriptions a compelling method to access visual arts at an art venue (N = 104), although it is commonly used in practice. Remote visual arts appreciation is still only accepted by a smaller group of blind visual art patrons (N = 54 out of 220 respondents) (Appendix A, Table 3).\n\nWith further analysis of access method preferences across different onsets of blindness (as reported in Table 2), we found a significant association (α = .01 with Bonferroni correction) between the onset of blindness and the willingness to access visual arts at an art venue through tactile methods (χ2(1, N = 220) = 10.56, p < .01). We further dive into different age ranges of blindness onset and we found that our survey respondents with earlier blindness onset tend to prefer to use tactile access more than later blindness onset (Appendix C, Figure 5). And the percentage of the preference for tactile access becomes similar for people who acquire blindness after 20 years old (Appendix C, Figure 5).\n\nPreferred Methods Vision Level Onset of Blindness χ2 p χ2 p Recorded audio at art venues 3.77 0.152 0.65 0.419 Tactile access at art venues 5.84 0.054 10.56 0.001 Sighted assistance at art venues 0.07 0.968 2.68 0.101 Smart device assistance at art venues 0.71 0.702 4.26 0.039 Access visual arts online 8.5 0.014 7.37 0.007\n\nAs shown in Figure 2, the majority of congenitally blind respondents (88.1%) prefer having tactile access at art venues, whereas only 60.1% of respondents who acquired blindness later in life share this preference. We also found a significant association between the onset of blindness and willingness to access visual arts online (χ2(1, N = 220) = 7.37, p < .01). We then explore different age ranges of blindness onset and we found our respondents with earlier onset of blindness tend to access visual art online less than those who acquired blindness later (Appendix C, Figure 5). As shown in Figure 2, a much higher percentage of respondents who acquired blindness later on (28.7%) are willing to access visual art compared to those who are congenitally blind (9.5%). We found no significant association between the onset of blindness and preferences over sighted assistance, recorded audio, and smart device assistance (Table 2).\n\nFor analysis of access method preference across vision levels, although we did not find any statistically significant association, we observed interesting trends among our respondents—as shown in Figure 2, 30.2% of legally blind respondents prefer accessing visual arts online, almost double the percentage of totally blind respondents who chose this access method. As Bonferroni correction is a rather conservative approach, future research could further examine this trend, as it could potentially point to limitations in the current design of online visual art access methods that disproportionately influence totally blind art patrons.\n\nTogether, these results provide additional evidence to our interview findings that people who acquired blindness at different ages might have different preferences toward accessing methods, especially toward tactile graphics and models as well as remote visual arts activities.\n\n7.2.3 Source of Enjoyment. From our survey, the majority of survey respondents feel the most aesthetic enjoyment during visual arts appreciation when they get to learn stories behind the art pieces (N = 149) and when feeling the art piece through touch (N = 149) ((Appendix A, Table 3)). This result emphasizes the importance of prioritizing both a tactile presentation of visual details and rich stories about the art piece. Meanwhile, almost half of survey respondents also confirmed the joy from imagining the visuals (N = 99), conversing with peer art patrons (N = 93), and physically co-presenting with the artwork (N = 83) (Appendix A, Table 3)).\n\nIn analyzing blind art patrons’ source of enjoyment across vision levels and the onset of blindness through a set of chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction, we found no significant associations. Results of the full set of tests can be found in Appendix B (Table 4).\n\nA potential area for further exploration is the influence of vision conditions on enjoyment with touching. As shown in Figure 3, a much higher percentage of congenitally blind respondents (83.3%) in our survey considered touching as a primary source of enjoyment compared to those who acquired blindness (64.0%), which echos our interview findings (Section 5). Further, there was also a higher proportion of respondents with less usable vision (75.0% for totally blind respondents and 75.6% for those who only have some light perception) who consider touching as their source of enjoyment compared to those with more usable vision (55.8% for legally blind respondents).\n\n7.2.4 Motivation. Our survey results suggest that four motivations for engaging in visual arts experience that we learned from interviews also seem to be common across 220 survey respondents, including learning cultural knowledge and story (N = 143), relaxation and enjoyment (N = 116), social interaction and involvement (N = 112), as well as encouragement and inspiration (N = 109) (full results shown in Appendix A). While not as common, a quarter of respondents (N = 53) also access visual arts for nostalgic reasons , and 39 for achieving activism-related goals .\n\nOur chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction suggest no significant association between motivation to engage in visual arts appreciation and visual conditions. Results of the full set of tests can be found in Appendix B (Table 4).\n\n7.2.5 Design Considerations. All design considerations we learned from the interview received endorsement from at least one fourth of the respondents, as shown in Appendix A (Table 3). In particular, the most popular consideration is to have the option of accessing art pieces through multiple modalities at the same time (N = 97). 91 respondents further indicated that visual details should be delivered through tactile, and background information should be delivered through audio . Moreover, 77 respondents chose that having a clear standard of vocabularies for art descriptions agreed between the describer and receiver is important for improving their art appreciation experience, while the flexibility over art appreciation pace, location and time are also important to many respondents (N = 77) (Appendix A, Table 3).\n\nIn analyzing associations between the perceived importance of design considerations and vision conditions, our chi-squared tests with Bonferroni correction suggest no significant results. Results of the full set of tests can be found in Appendix B (Table 4). However, a potential future area of exploration is any social and psychological challenges brought by acquiring blindness later in life, as we observed that overall more survey respondents who acquired blindness (33.7%) treated social stigmatization as a priority among all design considerations we listed, compared to those who are congenitally blind (19.05%) (as shown in Figure 4).\n\n8.1 Summary of Design Implications for Blind Art Appreciation\n\nThrough 15 in-depth interviews and a large-scale survey, we learned about blind people's diverse interests and experiences with visual arts. The survey results confirmed a set of common practices, challenges, motivations, as well as considerations of blind visual arts patrons that we learned from the interviews (Section 7.2). While visiting art venues with tactile graphics or with sighted peers are the most popular access methods for blind patrons, we see promises in technology-based support to transform these methods, especially through better coordinated multimodal experiences and personalized design. In particular, both the interviews and survey suggest that personal factors, including vision level, the onset of blindness, motivation, comprehension goals, past experiences with visual arts, and non-visual presentation modalities all contribute to individuals’ unique needs for personalized visual arts access solutions, which should not box-in anyone with a vision impairment as one-size-fits-all. Our findings echo with existing research that identified people who acquired blindness at different stages of life as having various “blind” perceptions toward spatial and temporal information [71]. Therefore, we suggest future research on visual arts accessibility to consider co-design, participatory design, and longitudinal involvement with blind people at different stages (e.g., different vision level, different years of visual experiences), that supports learning, technology adoption, and social factors in their life [12, 29].\n\nWe also learned a detailed set of challenges and considerations with numerous aspects of non-visual visual arts appreciation, centering on access modalities, visual concept comprehension, interpretation freedom, convenience, and social tensions. These considerations call to past work on multimodality (e.g., [22, 70, 78]), non-visual presentations of visual information (e.g., [77, 112]), and social considerations of assistive technologies (e.g., [76, 80, 110]), but specifically provide guidance for visual arts presentations. In particular, these findings provide novel insights on what blind patrons want to learn about specific elements of visual arts (e.g., form, shape, or content), which of them should be presented in what modalities (e.g., haptics, audio, level of interactivity) (Section 6.1), persisting challenges with these modalities, and what types of social and interpretation goals are involved (Section 4). Overall, we advocate for future research to incorporate considerations identified in our study when designing for blind people's access to visual arts. Below, we further suggest possible research directions.\n\n8.2 Art Appreciation in Social Settings and Activism\n\nAs suggested in our findings, visual arts appreciation can be a social activity for blind people (e.g., discussing paintings in detail with their friends, attending visual arts venue tours, and activism). Future access methods should go beyond just providing information about virtual arts and take social interactions into consideration, as suggested for general accessibility support [110]. Beyond building applications and social infrastructures that connect blind patrons with peers or docents with expertise, future research could also consider opportunities and challenges for utilizing Human-Robot Interaction to mitigate the stress of people who feel anxious about social interactions (e.g., [119]).\n\nAs some of our participants prefer going to art galleries with their blind peers, another future research area is to explore dynamics and collaboration techniques [19, 85] for blind patron groups, and investigate associated design opportunities. Furthermore, we also learned that our participants perceive visual arts for activism purposes (Section 5.1). According to the prior definition, “art activism” has shown the ability of art to function as the medium for social activism [100]. Despite the legal right to activism and protection against discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act (Section 504) [94], in-person activism poses additional barriers for people with disabilities as found by Li et al. [81]. In addition to the institutional barriers against activism, people with disabilities have to navigate additional physical and environmental accessibility challenges to effectively collectivize and protest against (disability) injustice. Thus, more should be explored for blind activists in art museums and galleries [106], such as leveraging mobile AR applications to support blind activists’ interactions with the space and reduce physical barriers with other people [53]."
