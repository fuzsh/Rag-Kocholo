        "text": "All This Soft Wild Buzzing considers the relationship between artists and the natural landscape through a lens of collaboration, of listening, and of reciprocity. Nature is often viewed as a neutral space, but landscape—with its connotations of ownership and control—is fraught. The sweeping vistas of early American landscape painting and photography promoted and perpetuated Manifest Destiny, and artists replicated a prevailing desire to conquer the land. In direct contrast to this earlier narrative, the contemporary artists in this exhibition hone in on details, incorporate organic materials into their process, and allow nature to exist. Artists included: Saif Azzuz, Teresa Baker, Christopher Robin Duncan, Nicki Green, Bessma Khalaf, Dionne Lee, Young Suh, Stephanie Syjuco.\n\nAll eight of the artists in the exhibition live, or have lived, in northern California, and their work resonates with the specificity of the Bay Area terrain and the people who inhabit it. The title of the exhibition is drawn from the final line of a poem by Camille Dungy that draws parallels between the soft, protected soul of her partner and the untouched, pre-colonial coastline of California. The artists in the show engage with the effects of forest fires, the Land Back movement, the carceral system, belonging, climate change, and the resiliency of Indigenous life, among other topics. Landscape is exposed as a historical construct that is interrogated by a new generation of artists grappling with the relationship between humans and nature. In these works, the artists invite viewers to also consider site, place, and the land beneath and around them. All This Soft Wild Buzzing inaugurates the Wattis galleries on the newly expanded CCA campus.\n\nAll This Soft Wild Buzzing is curated by Jeanne Gerrity and organized by Diego Villalobos.\n\nMakeshift Memorials, Small Revolutions is an exhibition in two parts with programming examining the shifts in dilated time, ritual, memory-keeping, and community-building in artistic practices in the years 2020-2024. Makeshift Memorials, Small Revolutions traces the cyclical nature of improvised, responsive yet sustained systems of mutual aid, information sharing, and embodied knowledge and their intersectional, intimate, and enduring effects, as magnified by the COVID-19 global pandemic.\n\nThe exhibition considers artists as prognosticators and traces their evolving practices and approaches, informed by activism and the creation of mutual aid networks spurred from lived experiences such as the still ongoing HIV/AIDS epidemic and Black and Brown grief. The artists assume the role of narrators for memetic memory, muffled silences, and informal archiving against power structures sanctioning conditions of personal isolation, cultural amnesia, and planetary extinction.\n\nAmplifying the concurrent exhibitions presented in Houston and San Francisco, public programs are activations and timely engagements of the current moment, during the final months of the 2024 U.S. presidential election cycle. Makeshift Memorials, Small Revolutions is a diary of experiences, encompassing not only what happened but also the possibility of what never happened in the ongoing process of remembering and recollection, as a form of ‘protest against forgetting.’\n\nThe years 2020-2024 began with the onset of the COVID-19 global pandemic, which continues to expose systemic inequities disproportionately affecting historically marginalized communities. In the 2022 book What World Is This?: A Pandemic Phenomenology, Judith Butler advocates for intertwinement as a ‘“collective effort to find or forge the best form of ‘interdependency’ as one that most clearly embodies the ideals of radical equality.”’ The concurrent exhibitions in Houston and San Francisco and their related public programs are guided by entangled ethics in order to untangle forms of sustained solidarities inching toward liberation.\n\nThe exhibition, How to Carry Water, brings together contemporary visual artists and humanities scholars in shared observations and questions about watersheds. In this expanded conversation, the term “watershed” refers not only to ecological structures, but also to the spatial, temporal and cultural entities that catalyze collectivity and life alongside bodies of water. The exhibition considers how the lenses of history, philosophy and creative practice allow for alternative methods of witnessing the human relationship to water.\n\nCurators: Ashley Stull Meyers, Mary Jones and Thomas Hart Horning Chief Curator of Art, Science, and Technology and Kelly Bosworth, Mary Jones and Thomas Hart Horning Assistant Professor of Public History and Ethnomusicology.\n\nArtists: Indira Allegra, Saif Azuz, Michael Boonstra, Carolina Caycedo, Dan Coe, Rasheena Fountain, Sky Hopinka, Garrick Imatani, Colin Ives, Sean McFarland, Susan Murrell, Jefferson Pinder and Margo Woloweic.\n\nReshaping the Narrative: California Perspectives surveys the myriad ways artists represent and reflect our local communities. The featured artists offer unique and local perspectives on themes that resonate during this presidential election year, such as immigration, civil rights, labor activism, feminism, and cultural identity.\n\nPart of Getty’s region-wide initiative PST ART: Art and Science Collide, the Hammer presents Breath(e): Toward Climate and Social Justice, organized by guest co-curators Glenn Kaino and Mika Yoshitake. The exhibition considers environmental art practices that address the climate crisis and anthropogenic disasters and their inescapable intersection with issues of equity and social justice. Breath(e) features works by more than 20 artists, including works by Mel Chin, Ron Finley, Cannupa Hanska Luger, Garnett Puett, and Lan Tuazon, commissioned specially for this exhibition.\n\nBreath(e) was conceived during the height of the global COVID-19 pandemic and America’s racial reckoning in 2020, and as such explores pressing issues related to the ethics of climate justice, while proposing pragmatic and philosophical approaches to spur discussion and resolution. The exhibition strives to challenge and deconstruct polarized political attitudes surrounding climate justice in America and offers new perspectives around land and indigenous rights of nature.\n\nARTISTS\n\nBrandon Ballengée\n\nMel Chin\n\nTiffany Chung\n\nRon Finley\n\nLaToya Ruby Frazier\n\nCannupa Hanska Luger\n\nRyoji Ikeda\n\nikkibawiKrrr\n\nMichael Joo\n\nDanil Krivoruchko\n\nXin Liu\n\nYoshitomo Nara\n\nOtobong Nkanga\n\nRoxy Paine\n\nGarnett Puett\n\nRob Reynolds\n\nSandy Rodriguez\n\nSarah Rosalena\n\nBently Spang\n\nMika Tajima\n\nClarissa Tossin\n\nLan Tuazon\n\nYangkura\n\nJin-me Yoon\n\nZheng Mahler\n\nThe Spotlight series includes a new or never-before-exhibited artwork paired with a commissioned piece of writing, creating focused and thoughtful conversations between the visual arts and authors, critics, poets, scholars, and beyond. In this iteration, the Spotlight features Sarah Cain’s Path of Totality, 2024. A text by curator and writer Jamillah James accompanies the presentation.\n\nThis exhibition is the second in a series highlighting contemporary Bay Area artists in our collection. The installation explores how artists relate to their environments through place: place as the physical land, place as heritage, place as the imaginary, and place as belonging.\n\nSeveral artists examine climate change and its local impact. In Saif Azzuz’s Lo’op’ (It burns) (2021), he draws the color palette from maps of the 2021 droughts and fires in California. Other artists use found materials not only to address ecological issues but also to add layers of meaning, such as in Guillermo Galindo’s Ready to Go (2015), made from a broken bicycle and chair he found along the US-Mexico border. And others play with figure and ground: Clare Rojas’s Walking in Rainbow Rain (2021) is a meditation on disappearing into one’s environment. The drab cityscape is brightened by the rain’s rainbow palette, which also alludes to the history of the LGBTQ+ movement in San Francisco. The works on display, exploring themes of belonging, ecological stewardship, and social justice, are drawn from the 2022 Svane Family Foundation gift of 42 works by more than 30 local artists.\n\nFortes D’Aloia & Gabriel is pleased to collaborate with Nara Roesler for the fourth edition of the summer exhibition at Comporta, Portugal. Throughout July and August, the former rice barn and once cinema Casa da Cultura da Comporta hosts a group show curated by art historian Nancy Dantas featuring works by five contemporary artists from different parts of the globe, whose practices trace pathways through Brazil, South Africa, and the United States.\n\nThrough works by Alberto Pitta (Salvador, Brasil 1961), Efrain Almeida (Boa Viagem, Brasil, 1964), Igshaan Adams (Cape Town, South Africa, 1982), Leonardo Drew (Tallahassee, USA, 1961) and Marina Rheingantz (Araraquara, Brasil, 1983), the curator, herself a scholar working between Johannesburg, Cape Town and Almada, poses a reflection on the paths and knowledge systems that accompany the rice crop, a dietary staple in countless cultures and a common plantation in the fields surrounding Comporta. An ancestral and contemporary summoning, Stirring the Pot, conceived as cooking, disrupting, and celebrating, takes place when work is over and tools are stored away, opening a circle for dance, liberation, and communication across realms and times. While the sculptures of Igshaan Adams and Leonardo Drew embody historical contexts in South Africa and the United States in sculptural objects, the wildlife sculptures of Efrain Almeida and Alberto Pitta’s textile prints reference specific Brazilian cultures and rituals, and Marina Rheingantz’s painting translates an outdoor sensory experience in abstract materiality.\n\n“Stirring the Pot temporarily transforms the Casa da Cultura, a former rice barn and once cinema, into a staging of scenes and entwinements between the material and the ethereal, the overt and latent, inside and outside, past and present, the historically distant and poetically close”, writes the curator.\n\nDeveloped in 2021 by Fortes D’Aloia & Gabriel, the Comporta summer show originated from a desire to establish alternative models and collaborative projects. It has previously featured exhibitions in partnership with kurimanzutto (2023), Clearing and Madragoa (2022), and Galeria Luisa Strina and Sé Galeria (2021). Initially conceived as a response to the pandemic-related restrictions that disrupted the global art calendar, the exhibition has become a permanent fixture. As Comporta has gradually emerged as a cultural destination, the show has firmly established itself as an annual highlight.\n\nCaragh Thuring has been elected as a Royal Academician in the category of Painting by The Royal Academy of Arts.\n\nThuring works with painting, drawing, weaving and photography. She builds and arranges layered imagery in opposition to traditional visual and logical hierarchies. Painting the overlooked and the out of sight, Thuring is curious to what lies beneath the surface. Filtering landscape, people, places, boundaries and territories, she interweaves the technological and human: volcanoes, submarines and bricks appear viscerally or bodily whilst emphasising the clash between the natural and the manufactured.\n\nFor over 250 years, the Royal Academy of Arts has existed to champion art and artists. The academy is run by the Royal Academicians, artists and architects elected by their peers in recognition of their exceptional work. The Royal Academy is home to Britain's longest established art school, the RA Schools. Every year since 1768 they have held an annual Summer Exhibition, the largest open-submission art exhibition in the world. The Royal Academy presents their collection of art and architecture in free displays throughout their home on Piccadilly and put on world-class exhibitions of art from around the world, welcoming hundreds of thousands of people to their galleries each year.\n\nTeresita Fernández at SITE Santa Fe\n\nTeresita Fernández / Robert Smithson\n\nSITE SANTA FE, in collaboration with Teresita Fernández and Holt/Smithson Foundation, is pleased to present Teresita Fernández / Robert Smithson. This major exhibition marks the first time Robert Smithson’s work has been placed in conversation with an artist working today. Artist-led and conceptually driven, Teresita Fernández / Robert Smithson is a subjective, intergenerational conversation between two practices. The exhibition critically considers entanglements between place, site, seeing, and deep time through the artists’ mutual engagement with material intelligence, geological agency, and cartographic fictions.\n\nPresenting both iconic and rarely-seen works by Fernández and Smithson, the exhibition organizes their artistic dialogue around a shared desire to recontextualize the complexities of art addressing the land. Teresita Fernández / Robert Smithson is initiated by Fernández’s long-term engagement with challenging socially-constructed ideas about place and landscape, as well as her deep research on the art and ideas of Smithson. The exhibition is curated by Lisa Le Feuvre, Executive Director of Holt/Smithson Foundation, and Teresita Fernández, and is organized by SITE SANTA FE.\n\nTeresita Fernández / Robert Smithson is an artist-driven model of exhibition-making that pulls the past productively into the present. Both Fernández’s and Smithson’s artistic research is rooted in conceptual questions that engage matter, materiality, land, and place. Fernández’s insistence on situating site and landscape in relation to human beings opens a reexamination of Smithson’s work that considers the urgencies of the present. As a whole, Teresita Fernández / Robert Smithson operates as a platform to question how we define place, land, and landscape— as well as who has agency in such places. In doing so, the exhibition seeks to radically shift the art historical perspectives that have sidelined voices of women artists, Indigenous artists, and artists of color.\n\nFortes D’Aloia & Gabriel and HOA Present RAW!: An Intersectional Art Exhibition in Barra Funda.\n\nFortes D’Aloia & Gabriel and HOA proudly announce RAW!, a concurrent and intersectional group exhibition showcasing the works of artists from both galleries, set across two warehouses in Barra Funda.\n\nIn a shared effort to foster exchanges and explore horizontal organizational models, Fortes D’Aloia & Gabriel and HOA unite artists from different generations, blending their diverse approaches, languages, and media into a singular exhibition spanning both gallery spaces. Opening on June 22, RAW! serves as a platform for converging dialogues between emerging and established artists, expressed through a range of media from video to sculpture. The exhibition features diverse practices encompassing installation, audiovisual, and pictorial categories.\n\nThis exhibition features works by eleven contemporary artists from around the globe to explore how these individuals engage with topics such as resilience, strength, labor, women’s rights, and queer aesthetics through athletic imagery. It also queries preconceived notions of femininity through a range of conceptual approaches, be they celebratory, humorous, or critical.\n\nArtists featured in this exhibition are Bianca Argimón, Libby Black, Zoë Buckman, Monica Kim Garza, Riikka Hyvonen, Sophie Kirchner, Eddie Lanieri, Hazel Meyer, Fay Sanders, Sheena Rose, and Kawita Vatanajyankur.\n\nShe’s a Knockout was guest curated by Caitlin Swindell, Chief Curator, Vero Beach Museum of Art.\n\nDonald Moffett at The Center for Maine Contemporary Art\n\nThe Center for Maine Contemporary Art (CMCA) in Rockland, Maine, will present the exhibition DONALD MOFFETT: NATURE CULT, SEEDED from May 25 to September 8, 2024. The show, curated by former CMCA director and chief curator Suzette McAvoy, is the artist’s first exhibition in Maine, where he is a seasonal resident of North Haven Island.\n\nNATURE CULT: SEEDED is the latest iteration in the ongoing series. The exhibition is centered on the large-scale sculptural installation, Lot 030323/24 (the golden bough), an assemblage of dead tree limbs painted gold and bolted together to form an undead yet ethereal totem to life. In a recent interview with fellow North Haven resident architect Toshiko Mori in Domus magazine, Moffett speaks of his interest in “the tree, the fundamental unit of a forest and the web of ecology that builds out from the tree. When you mess with the tree, a system can fall apart.”\n\nLarry Bell at Phoenix Art Museum\n\nPhoenix Art Museum is pleased to present Larry Bell: Improvisations, a career survey of Bell’s work. The survey explores the progression of Bell’s process from the 1960s through the present day, featuring a wide range of glass cubes, sculptures, large-scale standing walls, and mixed-media collages the artist created using the cutting-edge vacuum deposition technique. The exhibition debuts a selection of Light Knot sculptures that suspend from the ceiling and appear to dance as they absorb and reflect the surrounding light. It also premieres one newly commissioned large-scale work—a cubic form representing the mercurial sun, surrounded by clouded glass evocative of the fog of Venice Beach, California. Improvisations additionally features rarely exhibited collage works from the Phoenix Art Museum Collection, including examples from Bell’s Vapor Drawings (1978-present), Mirage series (1980s-present), and Fraction series (1996-2001).\n\nCurated by Kyla McDonald, this group exhibition takes as its starting point cultural theorist Lauren Berlant’s call to rethink intimacy as part of a broader social context, where the inwardness of the intimate is “met by a corresponding publicness.” The exhibition brings together five artists whose examinations of intimacy align with Berlant’s perceptions—each demonstrating it to be full of complexity, underscored by ambivalences and vulnerabilities that give space to non-normative perspectives.\n\nIn Thuring’s work, the artist observes our external contexts: the spaces outside our personal worlds that have a significant bearing on how our lives are shaped. Her paintings explore what lies beyond, out of sight, or beneath the surface of the structures that surround and govern us, and the intimate, often unspoken, interconnections between people and their social, economic, or geographic environments.\n\nAlso featuring work by Lenz Geerk, France-Lise McGurn, Joanna Piotrowska and Cathy Wilkes.\n\nLarry Bell: Reds and Whites at NC State\n\nLarry Bell's largest site specific commission, Reds and Whites (2024), is now on view at North Carolina State University's Centennial Campus grounds. Consisting of four main elements that explode the traditional cube form and breaks it into its component parts of right-angle corners in an ever-increasing complexity of color and form, Reds and Whites is installed outside of the Snøhetta-designed Hunt Library where it is now a fixture of the NC State University campus and encompasses a total area of approximately 40 x 40 feet. The site-specific installation was unveiled in a ribbon cutting ceremony on May 1, 2024.\n\nPhotography by Matthew Millman, San Francisco.\n\nGalerie Lelong & Co., New York is pleased to share that Leonardo Drew will be in conversation with Nari Ward at the Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida, on the evening of Friday, March 1, 2024. This dynamic program celebrates the recent acquisitions of artworks by the artists into the Norton's Contemporary Collection.\n\nLeonardo Drew is a contemporary American artist based in Brooklyn, New York. He creates sculptures from natural materials and through processes of oxidation, burning, and decay, Drew transforms these objects into massive sculptures that critique social injustices and the cyclical nature of existence.\n\nNari Ward is a Jamaican-American artist based in New York City and is known for his sculptural installations composed of discarded found material collected throughout his Harlem neighborhood. Ward re-contextualizes these found objects in thought provoking sculpture that create complex conversations around social and political realities of race, migration, democracy, and community.\n\nSaif Azzuz at ICA SF\n\nFor his first institutional solo exhibition, Bay Area artist Saif Azzuz will construct a mixed-media installation of readymade sculptures, large-scale wood assemblage, found objects, and paintings. Titled \"Cost of Living\", the exhibition establishes current realities of gentrification and histories of settler colonialism as tandem forces to be examined and unsettled. The cost of living is both an indicator and a complaint, a framework and unequal reality that deals out unrelenting change.\n\nIn \"Cost of Living\", Azzuz utilizes the materials of gentrification, such as construction fencing, semi-private mesh, and barbed wire to mirror the physical reality that corporate development has on humans and nonhumans. Movement, sight, and memory are restricted as land is taken and soiled. With this installation, the artist creates a space in which viewers navigate through objects and artworks. With sightlines and physical pathways obscured, the viewer’s experience mirrors the shifting reality of the Bay Area.\n\nAzzuz roots his practice in looking to the land and its histories as a prism for understanding the dread and beauty of contemporary life, guided by the signs and teachings of Indigenous resilience, learned from both plants and people.\n\nLarry Bell \"Iceberg\" at Milwauke Art Museum\n\nMilwauke Art Museum is pleased to present \"Winter Series: Larry Bell's Iceberg\".\n\nThe Winter Series is a new annual exhibition series that brings color and joy to the coldest, dreariest months of the year. Each year between December and March, the light-filled, 90-foot-high Windhover Hall will showcase a large-scale installation by a renowned or up-and-coming artist whose work reflects a profound meditation on nature. Open to all with free admission, this series invites visitors to experience an intriguing and often colorful alternative to the winter beyond the windows and affords artists an opportunity to reflect upon nature within this one-of-a-kind space.\n\nThis unique series commences with the installation of Iceberg (2020) by Larry Bell (b. 1939), a leading artist of the California Light and Space Movement. Comprised of four zig-zagged, free-standing panels of laminated glass, each seven feet tall at its pinnacle, Iceberg sits in the prow-like space of the magnificent hall, set against the backdrop of Lake Michigan. It connects the architectural wonder that is Windhover Hall to its natural, seasonal surroundings by evoking the shape and shifting tones of floating ice forms and, incidentally, the effects of a changing climate.\n\nBell is known for his innovative sculptural experiments with light and perception, primarily using glass. He explores the medium’s ability to simultaneously reflect, absorb, and transmit light and utilizes alternative, often industrial materials—here, commercially available color film sandwiched between sheets of clear glass—to create complex spatial ambiguities. A see-through object one moment becomes mirrored the next; shadows turn into windows. Iceberg, with its many surfaces, amplifies these subtle effects and offers a polychromatic contrast to the wintery expanse beyond the soaring windows.\n\nAn exceptionally gifted educator, Hung Liu (1948-2021) was a vibrant and vital part of the artist community in the Bay Area and beyond. Just before her untimely death in 2021, Liu began conversations with MCAM to organize an exhibition showcasing the work of an amazing group of women artists that she taught and mentored during her tenure as a professor in the Mills College Art Department.\n\nLook Up to the Sky, Hung Liu's Legacy of Mentoring Women Artists is the realization of that idea and features the work of Hung Liu alongside former students Rosana Castrillo Díaz, Nicole Fein, Danielle Lawrence, Monica Lundy, Nancy Mintz, Sandra Ono, Susan Preston, Mel Prest, Rachelle Reichert, Yoshiko Shimano, Gina Tuzzi, Lien Truong, and Bambi Waterman.\n\nPioneer Works and Headlands Center for the Arts are pleased to co-present \"Climate Futurism\", an exhibition featuring new commissions by Artists Erica Deeman, Denice Frohman, and Olalekan Jeyifous presented at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nCurated by ecologist and climate policy expert Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, the exhibition represents the culmination of Headlands’s inaugural Threshold Fellowship, a two-year program which highlights the power and efficacy of artists’ methods and processes to imagine a more equitable future. Taking inspiration from Johnson’s forthcoming book, What If We Get It Right?, the Artists have created works that explore topics such as creating new traditions, transforming our food system, reconnecting with nature, strengthening our diasporas, and proceeding with justice and love.\n\n\"Climate Futurism\" is curated by Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, and is made possible by generous funding from the Joe & Clara Tsai Foundation’s Social Justice Fund. It is also supported in part by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs in Partnership with the City Council, as well as the New York State Council on the Arts with the support of the Office of the Governor and the New York State Legislature.\n\nHeadlands’ Threshold Fellowship is supported in part by Christine & Curtis Gardner, Gruber Family Foundation, and The Hayabusa Charitable Foundation.\n\nImage: Olalekan Jeyifous, PFC – Seneca SunCraft Orchards, 2022. Courtesy of the artist and Pioneer Works.\n\nIncluding works by: Saif Azzuz, Matthew Kirk, and G. Peter Jemison.\n\nNew York-based artist Jessie Henson will make her Broadway debut with \"See What the Sun Thinks\", an exhibition of new works in Broadway Gallery's Project Room.\n\nWorking with an industrial sewing machine and gold leaf on paper, Henson approaches her abstractions with as much muscle as grace. As the tightly nestled and brightly colored thread accretes across the surface in clusters, the paper buckles and contorts adding a sculptural dimension that is echoed by the reflectivity of the metallic leafing.\n\nHenson is a subtly clever colorist as well, at times situating slight tonal variances side by side or leaving considerable swaths of the paper unsewn. A group of works using primarily black thread on black paper reinforce this disciplined aspect of her work, encouraging a totalizing, topographical effect.\n\nTaken together, this body of work serves as a concise introduction to Henson’s practice and her particular inversion of painterly abstraction—one that is refracted through a prism of both craft and industrial manufacture.\n\nJack Barrett presents \"Plant a Weed\", a group exhibition that brings together new and existing works by sixteen artists, from New York City, Los Angeles, Pacifica and Mexico City. On view from June 17 to July 22, 2023, the exhibition is curated by Francesca Altamura, an independent curator and organizer based in New York, NY. The exhibition will mark the debut of new works by over sixteen participating artists.\n\nThe artists in \"Plant a Weed\" offer a counterpoint to what is understood as natural, offering an expansion of systems, of publics, and a glimpse into the lives lived and loved within the urban ecosystem. Street detritus, both natural and human-made, maps out a cosmos of the non-desirable. Paper towels, Windex, egg shells, cigarettes, mummified rats, scorpions, lollipops, hard-shell tacos, fabric, paper, plastic, leather, and other mixed debris coagulate to form a new ecology.\n\nThe scurrying of critters acts as a score for the de facto co-habitual relationship New Yorkers, human and non-human, share. While pizza rats embark on a quest for a slice and a subway seat, the Adams administration appoints a ‘Rat Czar,’ a Sisyphean display of control over the non-human taking place during a generation-defining housing and medical crisis.\n\nAmidst meticulously manicured astroturf and glistening corporate lawns, a weed resolutely disrupts the imposed order of the grid, of who belongs here, and of authority. In this whimsical interplay of urban encounters, resilience emerges, dismantling the hedgerows between the imaginary borders that demarcate the natural and human worlds.\n\nSeveral artists in the exhibition including Michael Assiff and Salome Asega have undergone extensive fieldwork to shed light on their artworks. In Assiff’s new paintings from 2023, he trucked cross country with a childhood friend, observing the infrastructure and plant life that grows alongside truck stops, highways and spaces frequented by long-haul truckers. The 3D-printed monster truck model, Asega’s RATs, literally printed in the shape of a rat, which first debuted in the 2022 iterations of Nuit Blanche and Munchmuseet’s Munch Triennale, delves into Risk Assessment Tools, or AI technological systems, that are used by city agencies to make biased decisions about bail, prison sentencing, welfare, medical benefits and housing services. Saif Azzuz excavates the colonial history of Collect Pond Park in Lower Manhattan. In We don’t want your kind here (No’-oh) from 2022, the steel fence acts as a physical symbol of relentless colonial campaigns to privatize and monetize land and natural resources once stewarded by the Lenape.\n\nBoth Antonia Kuo and Ragini Bhow are inspired by the mercurial and moody rhythms of New York City. Kuo combines the photography taken around her home and studio, with industrial processes she learned growing up in her family’s casting foundry to create two new photographs, Aftermath and Phosphor, both from 2023. The densely layered compositions are so far abstracted from their original meaning, yet portray an emotive story about the urban landscape. Bhow enters into a transcendental state to create Wood Entity from 2023. As a means of digesting the sights and sounds of the city, she articulates amoebic forms by pressing on the blank aluminum sheets bought from an industrial metal supply store. Similar to Kuo, Justin Cloud grew up in a family of farmers, mechanics, and engineers. He uses an ancient technique called “repoussé and chasing” to create Mood Graft and Knight Kitchen from 2023, an art form used around the world to ornate metal from chalices to armor. The artist uses a hammer and chisel to shape the metal into realistic depictions of flowers.\n\nAryana Minai presents View and Embodied & Embedded IV from 2022, as emblems of architectural design elements. Minai creates a liquid pulp from recycled paper, then presses objects like bricks and stones, salvaged from the street, textile woodblocks and other urban artifacts, to create fossil-like imprints of the cities which she calls home, Tehran and Los Angeles. Tamara Santibañez creates new work from 2023 that exposes and interweaves meaning assigned to industrial materials, architecture and objects used for mass socio-political and symbolic actions. The artist renders two flowers, commonly used symbols of peace and resistance, in glazed porcelain that delicately hold a chain of keys and a heart-shaped lock at the center. For Santibañez, these objects represent the ‘lock bridge,’ where couples inscribe their names on padlocks, lock it on the bridge and throw the keys into the river. These gestures of eternal love are cut short due to ongoing maintenance costs and the structural integrity of the bridge being endangered by the added weight. Rodrigo Red Sandoval’s handmade manholes, constructed in Amsterdam and clogged with urban detritus from New York City, activate the gallery floor. In Sandoval’s new molds from 2023, cigarette butts and various debris clog the mouth-like openings, truncating the possibility of waste disposal. Sandoval lays bear the entanglements of global environmental degradation, breaking down the boundaries between the here vs. there of waste offsets. Within a series of three new small-scale works from 2023, Emma Safir fabricates portals between the inside and outside worlds. She first takes iPhone images from the streets, which are obscured through digital manipulation. These abstract backgrounds are printed on silk, then further distorted through traditional methods of fiber manipulation.\n\nOn view at Jack Barrett for only two weeks before the pandemic, Molly Soda presents for the second time, two vinyl windows, which incorporate “invasive” weeds that were grown in her apartment. These sculptures act as windows into the artist’s private space, as reminders that no matter how disorganized and chaotic her life becomes, the surrounding environs will always continue to flourish. Sydney Shen revives a sculpture from 2015, Please Don’t Eat Me, that consists of a dustpan and scorpions sourced from Etsy, a reminder of the life that exists between floorboards, in the walls, in the alleyways between apartments and on online marketplaces. Christine Egaña Navin questions utility and value, especially of objects, structures and processes made by humans and organically. In Botiquín 1.22 from 2018, she encases a mummified two-toed adult female Ring Tailed Cat, 22 two-dollar bills, a Blow Pop, two dehydrated Taco Bell hard-shelled tacos, and a mummified adolescent male Brown Rat, among many other objects, in epoxy taxidermy putty.\n\nIn Hamlet from 2022, Justin Chance uses a number of techniques to create his quilts, with wet and felt needle that is arranged, collaged, and sewn together with fibers and wool that are then encased in silk organza. His title refers to human settlements that are not legal entities and have no local government or official boundaries. Chance’s work represents an idealized version of rural life, where manicured lawns are within close commuting distance of a city. Em Rooney is also inspired by nature and creates botanical forms with large-scale industrial processes and materials. In trouble every day from 2022, a blue cocoon is made from steel, indigo-dyed rice paper, rhinestones, and synthetic whale boning, among other materials. In stark contrast, Monsieur Zohore’s material of choice is paper towels, an artistic practice that has been honed in for over ten years. In a new work from 2023, he presents a relic of old New York City, a plastic takeaway bag emblazoned with the former two-dimensional I ❤ NY logo. In another new work from 2023, Zohore depicts an iconic image of Mierle Laderman Ukeles performing Touch Sanitation Performance: “Handshake and Thanking Ritual” with Sanitation Workers of the New York City Department of Sanitation from 1979–80. Over the course of 11 months, Ukeles shook the hands of all 8,500 sanitation workers, thanking them for their service. Zohore re-writes this iconic image from performance history by adding the world's most expensive handbag ($450,000), designed by former Louis Vuitton Creative Director Marc Jacobs.\n\nIn this whimsical interplay of encounters, the resilience of artists thriving in the city is evident, as they subvert the borders between the haves and the have-nots, the locals and the interlopers, the perfect specimens and the riff-raff. The weed will always prevail.\n\nLeonardo Drew (b. 1961), Number 235T, 2023, currently on view at Amon Carter Museum of American Art, Fort Worth, Texas through June 2024.\n\nSculptor Leonardo Drew is the next contemporary artist to transform the Museum’s first floor galleries with a new site-specific commission. Known for his large-scale, multi-dimensional installations, Drew employs organic materials to create topographies that are at once looming in size and stunning in their intricacies. For Number 235T, Drew will anchor sculptural pieces that he refers to as “planets” and surround them with hundreds of smaller objects as he works to identify the interconnectedness of them all.\n\nThis commission is the latest in a series initiated by the Carter in 2015 to respond to works in the Museum’s collection through the perspective of American artists working today.\n\nGagosian is pleased to announce \"To Bend the Ear of the Outer World: Conversations on contemporary abstract painting\", an exhibition of new and recent works by more than forty artists from the Americas, United Kingdom, and Germany. The exhibition has been organized by guest curator Gary Garrels, who, in collaboration with the artists, has selected a single painting by each, with most works presented here for the first time. This is Gagosian’s first exhibition to be sited across its two galleries in Mayfair, at Grosvenor Hill and Davies Street.\n\nThe exhibition in London examines the significance of abstract painting today, from Garrels’s perspective. Juxtaposing a diverse range of approaches to contemporary abstraction, the exhibition brings together works by three generations of artists, including some never before shown by Gagosian.\n\nParticipating artists include Tomma Abts, Richard Aldrich, Tauba Auerbach, Frank Bowling, Mark Bradford, Cecily Brown, Vija Celmins, Matt Connors, Tomm El-Saieh, Jadé Fadojutimi, Suzan Frecon, Katharina Grosse, Mark Grotjahn, Wade Guyton, David Hammons, Mary Heilmann, Thilo Heinzmann, Richard Hoblock, Jacqueline Humphries, Suzanne Jackson, Jennie C. Jones, Brice Marden, Helen Marden, Julie Mehretu, Oscar Murillo, Albert Oehlen, Laura Owens, Nathlie Provosty, David Reed, Gerhard Richter, Amy Sillman, Pat Steir, Ryan Sullivan, Lesley Vance, Charline von Heyl, Mary Weatherford, Stanley Whitney, Pamela Helena Wilson, Terry Winters, Christopher Wool, and John Zurier.\n\nCaragh Thuring: The Foothills of Pleasure\n\nThis exhibition of eight artists: Saif Azzuz, Chelsea Culprit, Brian DeGraw, Brittni Ann Harvey, Erin O'Keefe, Eddie Martinez, Sarah Peters and Derek Weisberg showcases work that in some way engages with the triumphs and fallacies of the modern project. As the lines in the verse above state, \"Doin' things I used to do/ They think are new,\" artists are filled with enthusiasm and excitement that belong to those who feel they are in the process of original invention, like children at play. Yet, as time goes by, we realize that this feeling of newness will be discovered and reclaimed by the next generation.\n\nExamining this framework, images and motifs from the past become replete with additional meaning, celebrating the movement and repetition in many of the works which speak to this cyclical framework and create a vibrancy and mode of activity that is in communication between the various artworks.\n\n​\n\nSarah Cain: Day after day on this beautiful stage\n\nKnown for her exuberant abstractions, Sarah Cain (b. 1979, Albany, NY) often extends her practice beyond the canvas into installation, site-specific painting, stained glass, and furniture. Her work draws from sources as disparate as Abstract Expressionism, graffiti, and pop music, and incorporates materials as diverse as sand, feathers, jewelry, crystals, and fabric. At the Henry, the artist has created an immersive architectural intervention in dialogue with the double-height architecture of the museum’s East Gallery.\n\nCain’s muscular, gestural painting embraces a strategically intuitive power that both undermines and expands our expectations of what has been historically considered “serious” abstract painting. Her color-soaked palette often mixes with a wide range of found objects that in turn complement her titles, which range in reference from the sweet to the erotic, from the mystical to the political. Cain redefines abstraction in feminist terms as an architecture for transformative, embodied, emotive experience. Her work emphatically insists on the value of feminine, queer, and other “othered” aesthetics, intentionally subverting male-dominated art historical traditions.\n\nAt the beginning of her career, Cain made dozens of site-specific paintings in abandoned buildings; by nature, these were ephemeral works. As her practice evolved, she has continued to create massive on-site works and preserved the impulse to treat painting seriously, but not preciously. For this exhibition, Cain transforms the gallery into a single monumental painting that wraps the floor and walls, created entirely on-site. Extending the full height of the walls, the work connects the two floors, creating different vantage points and experiences on each level. On the mezzanine level, viewers first encounter the artist’s suspended stained glass piece placed in the window, where it interacts with the exterior environment in constant flux depending on conditions of light and shadow. In the lower gallery, the work creates an immersive and surprisingly intimate, energizing space for the viewer. The audience becomes physically a part of the work as they enter, and can directly engage with the couch sculptures. Enhancing this direct intimacy are a suite of the artist’s $ Talismans, which transform the everyday item into a magical object of power.\n\nOften referencing lyrics from popular or particularly resonant songs in her titles, Cain has chosen Day after day on this beautiful stage, a line from the 1998 Silver Jews song “We Are Real,” for this exhibition. In it, musician/poet David Berman captures the painful yet transformative experience of creative life (or perhaps just life itself), and embraces how we retain meaning over time despite its darkness and our inevitable mortality.\n\nLiving and working in Brooklyn, New York, Leonardo Drew’s abstract works, made from an outpouring of chaotic elements, create installations that express immense tension and turbulence. The artist’s new work, Number 360 (2023), commissioned for YSP’s 18th-century Chapel, is a powerful reflection on the weight of collective experience, memory, and the cycles of life and death, decay and regeneration. This resonates within a historic building where many lives have been played out for centuries – unknown to us, yet somehow conveyed by the atmosphere of the space.\n\nDrew joins several artists in responding to the Chapel, which was built in 1740 and is a singular, contemplative place. Projects here set out to connect emotionally with a wide humanity and to be welcoming to everyone. Previous artists include Ai Weiwei, James Lee Byars, Kimsooja, Rachel Kneebone, Shirin Neshat, Yinka Shonibare, Chiharu Shiota and Bill Viola.\n\nThe basic material of Number 360 is plywood, either blackened or covered with textured coloured paint, which has been ripped apart and splintered to form the building blocks of a conical monolith that surges to over five metres in height. Unusually for Drew, Number 360 is a vertical installation, responding to the height and width of the chapel nave.\n\nLike an explosion held in time, Number 360 conveys ferocious energy as well as trauma and rupture. Drew’s fractured surfaces create their own language, embodying the laboured process of writing the artist’s experience into history. An African American artist born in Tallahassee in 1961 and raised in public housing in Bridgeport, Connecticut, Drew has often alluded to socio-political issues in his work, using such symbolically charged materials as cotton, rope, rags and rust that relate to the antebellum South, the African American experience, and America’s industrial past. He is, however, adamant in his resistance to impose explicit meaning, and chooses to title his pieces only with numbers in order, “to give the viewer enough room to find themselves in the work”.\n\nOne of the typical measures of success for artists is the ability to quit their day jobs and focus full time on making art. Yet these roles are not always an impediment to an artist’s career. This exhibition illuminates how day jobs can spur creative growth by providing artists with unexpected new materials and methods, working knowledge of a specific industry that becomes an area of artistic interest or critique, or a predictable structure that opens space for unpredictable ideas. As artist and lawyer Ragen Moss states:\n\nTypologies of thought are more interrelated than bulky categories like ‘lawyer’ or ‘artist’ allow. . . Creativity is not displaced by other manners of thinking; but rather, creativity runs alongside, with, into, and sometimes from other manners of thinking.\n\n\"Day Jobs\", the first major exhibition to examine the overlooked impact of day jobs on the visual arts, is dedicated to demystifying artistic production and upending the stubborn myth of the artist sequestered in their studio, waiting for inspiration to strike. The exhibition will make clear that much of what has determined the course of modern and contemporary art history are unexpected moments spurred by pragmatic choices rather than dramatic epiphanies. Conceived as a corrective to the field of art history, the exhibition also encourages us to more openly acknowledge the precarious and generative ways that economic and creative pursuits are intertwined.\n\nThe exhibition will feature work produced in the United States after World War II by artists who have been employed in a host of part- and full-time roles: dishwasher, furniture maker, graphic designer, hairstylist, ICU nurse, lawyer, and nanny–and in several cases, as employees of large companies such as Ford Motors, H-E-B Grocery, and IKEA. The exhibition will include approximately 75 works in a broad range of media by emerging and established artists such as Emma Amos, Genesis Belanger, Larry Bell, Mark Bradford, Lenka Clayton, Marsha Cottrell, Jeffrey Gibson, Jay Lynn Gomez, Tishan Hsu, VLM (Virginia Lee Montgomery), Ragen Moss, Howardena Pindell, Chuck Ramirez, Robert Ryman, and Fred Wilson, among many others.\n\nOrganized by Veronica Roberts, Former Curator of Modern and Contemporary Art, with Lynne Maphies, Former Curatorial Assistant, Blanton Museum of Art\n\nOne of the typical measures of success for artists is the ability to quit their day jobs and focus full time on making art.

Early next year, he will move his namesake gallery across the Golden Gate Bridge to Mill Valley in Marin County.\n\nAnthony Meier announces new location in Mill Valley, CA\n\nIn Autumn 2022, Hastings Contemporary will present the first major survey show of the work of Caragh Thuring\n\n(b. Brussels, 1972) – her first UK exhibition in six years.\n\nSpanning the last 15 years with more than 20 works, it will include paintings, drawings and monotypes. All works are on loan from the artist and public and private UK collections, in order to avoid the environmental impact of international shipping.\n\nThuring’s nuanced compositions juxtapose signs and imagery from her recurring iconography of volcanoes, bricks, flora, tartan, human silhouettes, and submarines, to explore where natural and manufactured worlds collide.\n\nThuring grew up in Scotland near to the majestic Holy Loch, the site of the renowned Cold War US nuclear submarine base and next to the construction site for the first concrete North Sea oil rigs. This clash of nature and industry has continued throughout her practice: looming submarine silhouettes, vast industrial structures and striking landscapes frequently appearing across different series. Similarly, Thuring incorporates a recurrent brick motif in her work, which for her perfectly represents the natural and the manufactured in a single object.\n\nVolcanoes and submarines lurk beneath, intermittently breaking through to the surface, obliquely referencing Thuring’s curiosity about what lies out of sight. Brick walls obstruct our view and untreated or woven canvas draw our attention to the surface of the painting itself and what might lie beyond. What is not obscured is often fragmented, disrupting the viewer’s familiarity of what they are looking at.\n\nFor more recent works, Thuring has collaborated with silk weavers in Suffolk to create bespoke cloth for use as her canvas. The fabric is woven on a loom, sewn together, and stretched onto a wood frame before being painted onto. These fabrics are digital renderings of previous paintings, photographs she has taken or found images. As she describes it: “I want to build the work into the surface, to continue the work I’ve already begun.” Both the labour and the depiction are worked into the surface and the painting becomes a continuation upon this ground.\n\nThe paintings also illustrate Thuring’s fascination with boundary lines and liminal spaces, perfectly reflected by the gallery’s own position on the foreshore – surrounded by the town’s historic beach, net huts and working structures of the fishing fleet. Massacre of the Innocents (after Breughel), 2010, almost echoes the towering architecture of local fishermen’s huts on Hastings’ beach, while the language of maritime and landscape permeate throughout.\n\nCaragh Thuring was born in Brussels in 1972 and has lived in the United Kingdom since 1973, moving first to Argyll, Scotland and later to West Sussex. Receiving a BA Hons in Fine Art from Nottingham Trent University in 1995, she moved to London the same year and currently divides her time between London and Argyll in Scotland.\n\nRecent solo exhibitions include: Caragh Thuring, Luisa Strina Gallery, São Paulo, Brazil (2019); Builder, Corbett vs. Dempsey, Chicago IL (2019); Caragh Thuring, Thomas Dane Gallery, Naples, Italy (2019); Selected group exhibitions include: Mixing it Up; Painting Today,Hayward Gallery, London, England (2021); Masterpieces in Miniature: The 2021 Model Art Gallery, Pallant House Gallery, Chichester, England (2021); Vesuvio Quotidiano Vesuvio Universale, Museo di San Martino, Naples, Italy (2019), Slow Painting, England (2018/2019); Virginia Woolf, An exhibition inspired by her writings, Tate St Ives, Cornwall, England (2018).\n\nCurated by the museum’s CEO and Director Heidi Zuckerman, 13 Women marks the museum’s 60th anniversary, paying homage to the 13 women who founded the Balboa Pavilion Gallery, the earliest iteration of OCMA, which was opened in 1962. Presented with multiple rotations over the course of almost a full year, 13 Women presents work from the 1960s to the present by artists central to the museum’s collection. Centered on the work of 13 pioneering female artists, each of whom share the visionary qualities of the museum founders, the multigenerational group exhibition celebrates OCMA’s rich history—one distinguished by innovative and groundbreaking exhibitions, thoughtful programming, and a deep commitment to artists. The 13 women included in the exhibition’s first rotation, on view October 8, are Alice Aycock, Joan Brown, Lee Bul, Lucy Bull, Sarah Cain, Vija Celmins, Mary Corse, Mary Heilmann, Barbara Kruger, Cady Noland, Catherine Opie, Hilary Pecis and Agnes Pelton. From timely and prescient works to iconic pieces, 13 Women looks back to look forward, exemplifying the museum’s commitment to sharing outward through objects and storytelling. Additional highlights include Charles Ray’s work Ink Box (1986) and Self Portrait (1990), both acquired from OCMA’s presentation of Ray’s first solo museum exhibition, alongside a new site-specific painting by Sarah Cain in the Avenue of the Arts Gallery. 13 Women is supported by Bank of America.\n\nThe Chinese word for “walk” also means “to get things done” and “to move.” By walking/doing/moving, people have woven together the complex fabric of cities, history and culture. We often talk about “entering/exiting history” or “going into/coming out of a dream state.” Walking involves reality, fantasy and dreams. We also often talk about “finding a path” or “seeking the way,” using the everyday act of walking as a metaphor for the search for a goal in life. When human beings (or civilizations) encounter a heavy blow, “walking” becomes a rite to set things in motion and an act of healing. “Crack” not only refers to the spatial experience of walking, but also signifies that people always move “between” one event and the next, implying that moving “between” events always calls for strategy. This exhibition takes “Walking the Crack” as a metaphor for the contemporary state of existence, bringing together the works and writings of artists of different generations since the 1960s, from both Taiwan and abroad, and opening a conversation among them. On the second floor of Taipei Fine Arts Museum, the corridors ambiguously signify pathways, forming two crosses. The exhibition combines artworks in a wide variety of media with a spectrum of research perspectives, attempting to integrate viewing and reading into a single experience of “Walking the Crack.”\n\nWalking creates paths, which may be shortcuts or perhaps detours. A path may start from tracking others or following in their footsteps. Sometimes people march in line. Sometimes they pace back and forth. Sometimes they walk a perilous road (for instance, we speak of risky affairs as “walking a tightrope”). These many different walking paths form lines, some running parallel to each other, others intersecting, all of them ultimately interweaving into a surface and forming a network. This is also how the exhibition connects art with daily life, artists with viewers, artworks with spaces. The viewing and reading of the exhibition are drawn together into a cycle, which implies the cycle of birth and perishing that encompasses the universe and all things.\n\nCurator: Fang-Wei Chang\n\nJanine Antoni's \"Mom and Dad\" (1994) will be included in The Double: Identity and Difference in Art Since 1900 at National Gallery of Art from 10 July to 30 October 2022.\n\nWhen two forms or images are presented together, our eyes can’t help but compare them. We “see double” and identify differences and similarities. The art of the double causes us to see ourselves seeing. The Double is the first major exhibition to consider how and why modern and contemporary artists have employed doubled formats to explore perceptual, conceptual, and psychological themes. From Matisse, Duchamp, and Gorky to Rauschenberg, Johns, Warhol, Truitt, and Hesse, this multimedia presentation features works by many of today’s leading artists, including Kerry James Marshall, Glenn Ligon, Roni Horn, and Yinka Shonibare. Through art, The Double explores enduring questions of identity and difference, especially self-identity as defined by our own unconscious, by society, and by race, gender, and sexuality.\n\nA panel of nationally recognized curators, local arts professionals and community members from the Purple Line Extension Section 2 and 3 project areas has selected artists to create site-specific, integrated artworks for the future Wilshire/Rodeo, Century City/Constellation, Westwood/UCLA and Westwood/VA Hospital stations.\n\nThe diverse range of accomplished artists includes:\n\nEddie Rodolfo Aparicio (Century City/Constellation Station)\n\nMoses X.

Brooks, Associate Curator, The Getty Research Institute; Michael Amescua, artist; Stephanie Vahn, Chair, Beverly Hills Arts and Culture Commission; and Thao Nguyen, Art and Design Agent, Creative Arts Agency.\n\nThroughout her career, New York-based artist Kate Shepherd has explored abstracted spaces in her richly colored works. For this \"Artist Talk,\" Shepherd discusses the evolution of her formal technique, including her signature use of fine lines to delineate space, her focus on paint reflectivity and texture, and her most recent works on paper. She will also discuss how she developed the exhibition \"April, May, June, etc., etc., Upended Floor (Mud, Blood),\" 2020, at Josh Pazda Hiram Butler Gallery in Houston from afar while living in New York City. Two of her works related to that exhibition are currently on view in \"Spatial Awareness: Drawings from the Permanent Collection\" at the Menil Drawing Institute.\n\nThe \"Artist Talk\" series is supported by a gift from the Cockrell Family Fund.\n\nAbout the artist: Kate Shepherd (b. 1961) was born in New York City, where she currently lives and works.

Extending onto the nearby protective sculpture enclosures and well covers, Cain’s painted elements surround and complement the canvas to create a dynamic installation that encourages movement and close-looking.\n\nJanine Antoni in “New Time: Art and Feminisms in the 21st Century” at the Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley\n\nJanine Antoni is included in “New Time: Art and Feminisms in the 21st Century” at the Berkeley Art Museum, Berkeley, CA from 25 August 2021 – 30 January 2022.\n\nThe exhibition \"Sarah Cain–Enter the Center\" will be on view at the Tang Teaching Museum at Skidmore College from 10 July to 28 November 2021.\n\nSarah Cain is an artist who explores and expands upon traditional ideas of painting. Cain works on canvases of all sizes, often modifying canvases by cutting and braiding, painting on all sides, and installing the canvas with the back of the painting facing the viewer. She also paints on other surfaces, including interior and exterior walls, floors, and dollar bills.\n\nThe creation and destruction of her paintings is part of Cain’s process that, in part, revolves around self-discovery. Cain describes herself as a feminist painter, using elements that are traditionally seen as feminine and “girly” as an act of non-conformity and antipathy to the patriarchal hierarchies of painting.\n\nArtist Talk: Lorraine O’Grady in conversation with Zoe Leonard at the Brooklyn Museum in Brooklyn, New York on Thursday, 27 May 2021 at 6 PM (EST).\n\nJoin Lorraine O’Grady, one of the most significant contemporary figures working in performance, conceptual, and feminist art, for an in-depth conversation in conjunction with a special exhibition Lorraine O’Grady: Both/And.

Thuring has since painted numerous views of volcanoes, thoughtfully exploring their symbolic, mythical and natural power.\n\n\"Teresita Fernández: Elemental\" will be on view at the Phoenix Art Museum from 1 October 2020 to 3 January 2021.\n\n\"Teresita Fernández: Elemental\" is the first major traveling exhibition and the first mid-career survey of works by contemporary artist Teresita Fernández, considered one of the most innovative artists of her generation.\n\nCo-organized with Pérez Art Museum Miami (PAMM), the retrospective showcases more than 50 large-scale sculptures, installations, and mixed-media wall works created by Fernández over two decades, offering Arizona audiences the opportunity to experience her evocative creations that reinterpret the relationships between nature, history, and identity.\n\nThe Mississippi Museum of Art presents \"Leonardo Drew: City in the Grass,\" a participatory, public art sculpture that invites viewers to engage directly with the work, the space it occupies, and one another while maintaining a social distance - on view from 26 September 2020 to 21 February 2021.\n\n\"Leonardo Drew: Making Chaos Legible\" is on view at the North Carolina Museum of Art from 9 September 2020 to 3 January 2021.\n\nUsing a variety of materials—wood, cotton, canvas, paper, steel, aluminum, sand—Drew makes dynamic sculptures that explode and expand into their spaces. These gravity-defying sculptures convey a feeling of barely contained or restrained energy and chaos. “I think of it as making chaos legible,” he says.\n\nContemporary artist Leonardo Drew creates dynamic, abstract sculptures and installations that expand into their surroundings. In this virtual lecture, Drew discusses work from his career and his intent for it to be a mirror for viewers, reflecting their individual experiences.\n\nJanine Antoni is included in “Ghosts from the Recent Past” at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin, Ireland from 1 September 2020 - 28 February 2021.\n\nJoseph Havel's exhibition \"Joss\" is on view at Asia Society Texas Center from 29 August to 8 November 2020.\n\nHavel has created a series of new works in response to the ancient bronze vessels currently featured in Asia Society Texas Center's \"Eternal Offerings: Chinese Ritual Bronzes.\" Joss paper and other paper items made in the forms of daily necessities such as food, household goods, and personal objects are burned as offerings in ancestor rituals with the understanding that the smoke carries their value to the spirit world. The ephemerality of joss paper contrasts sharply with the more durable nature of bronze. Havel constructs these sculptures by first using the paper forms of household goods and clothing to determine the compositions, then casting them in bronze.\n\nJanine Antoni is included in \"Body of Water\" at Magasin III Jaffa, Israel - ongoing Fall 2020.\n\n\"Body of Water\" consists of three video artworks from the collection of Magasin III Museum for Contemporary Art. \"Touch\" records Janine Antoni’s attempt to walk across the horizon, between sky and water, at the furthest point the human eye can perceive.\n\n\"Jockum Nordström | Bruno Knutman\" will be on view at Tegnerforbundet, Oslo from 16 August to 27 September 2020.\n\nTeresita Fernández is included in \"Catalyst: Art and Social Justice\" at Gracie Mansion, New York, closing 8 September 2021.\n\nDave Muller is included in the exhibition \"5,471 miles\" at Blum & Poe in Los Angeles and Tokyo from 21 July to 15 August 2020.\n\nThe exhibition \"Gary Simmons: Dancing in Darkness\" will be on view at Simon Lee Gallery, Hong Kong from 4 July to 29 August 2020.\n\nThese works examine the ways in which we attempt to reconstruct the past via personal and collective memory. Simmons delves into his own archive of imagery in order to retrace his personal history while at the same time demonstrating the impossibility of eradicating racial and cultural stereotypes from our shared conscience. The grey palette, paying subtle homage to Gerhard Richter, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, is an ironic wink at Simmons’ own inclusion in the art historical canon, recalling also the chalkboards used in his first erasure drawings in the 1990s.\n\nDonald Moffett's work \"Aluminum / White House Unmoored\" will be on view at Marianne Boesky Gallery, Aspen from 2 July to 13 September 2020. This work is the central work from Moffett's D.C. series, in which the artist projected handheld video of the capital's landmarks and symbols onto silver extruded oil painting—in this case, a flickering disembodied seat of ultimate power.\n\nJanine Antoni is included in \"Raid the Icebox Now: The Chorus\" at the RISD Museum as curated by Simone Leigh from 18 October 2019 to 28 June 2020.\n\nIn her \"Raid the Icebox Now\" installation, Simone Leigh places modern and contemporary works by Janine Antoni, Huma Bhabha, David Hammons, and Nancy Elizabeth Prophet in the RISD Museum’s ancient Greek, Roman, and Egyptian galleries. These objects are accompanied by Leigh’s own art: a new ceramic female portrait sculpture and a new sound work.\n\nEngaging directly with this shared global experience of pandemic-motivated social distancing, Blum & Poe Broadcasts, Dave Muller, and Three Day Weekend present an online group exhibition titled \"The Gallery is Closed.\"\n\nA number of artists and members of the community have contributed personal drawings and public signs that announce closure and reflect a multitude of absent voices and voices in waiting\n\nArtist Joseph Havel checks in with Contemporary Art Museum, Houston's Deputy Director Christina Brungardt during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTune in to their IGTV or YouTube channel to watch.\n\nJanine Antoni will be included in \"For a Dreamer of Houses\" at the Dallas Museum of Art from 15 March 2020 to 31 January 2021. The exhibition can also be viewed as a Virtual Exhibition online.\n\n\"For a Dreamer of Houses,\" an imaginative and immersive exhibition, explores the significance of the spaces we inhabit and how they represent ourselves, our values, and our desires. Discover over fifty works from the DMA’s collection in a variety of media that demonstrate the evocative power of domestic objects and structures. The featured artists use forms derived from dwellings or furnishings to investigate ideas including belonging, alienation, fantasy, gender, and the body.\n\n\"Jockum Nordstrom: Without Lantern\" will be on view at the Skissernas Museum, Sweden\n\nThe solo exhibition \"Jockum Nordstrom: Without Lantern\" will be on view at the Skissernas Museum, Sweden from 9 June to 18 October 2020.\n\nThe summer and fall exhibition presents Jockum Nordström, one of Sweden's most internationally acclaimed artists. The central work, The Anchor Hits the Sand, is a powerfully evocative and meditative shadow play with music. In addition to the shadow play the exhibition presents sculptures, collages and sketches, showing Nordström's versatility and artistic process.\n\nBrooklyn Academy of Music is pleased to announce that Teresita Fernández has been comissioned to create a work of Public Art for their campus. Fernandez, whose work often responds to the natural world, will create an interactive installation called \"Paradise Parados\" for the outdoor terrance aboce the Rudin Family Gallery at BAM Strong, a new space that connects to the BAM Harvey Theatre. They plan for the work to be on view by 2021.\n\nKate Shepherd's installation, \"April, May, June, etc., etc., Upended Floor (Mud, Blood)\" (2020), will be on view at Hiram Butler Gallery beginning May 2020.\n\nShepherd explains, \"Butler and I planned to open a show on May 2. In mid-March, we didn't even have to say it out loud –– health restrictions would make it impossible for me not only to work in my studio but also to travel to Houston. I decided to go ahead anyway and make a wall painting from afar that could be seen from the outer windows –– something kind of beautiful but spooky. It was a perfect challenge because I knew where the viewer would be.\"\n\nLA-based artist Dave Muller—whose work is rooted in his fascination with music, how it shapes our identities, and generates cross-cultural dialogue—joins us for a live Q&A to discuss his work and the original DJ mix \"Oops!... I Heard It Again\".\n\nLarry Bell is included in a \"Presentation of Gallery Artists\" at Hauser and Wirth, Hong Kong form 8 - 30 May 2020.\n\nJanine Antoni is featured in the online exhibition \"The Artist and The Self\" at James Fuentes Gallery from 1 May to 1 June 2020.\n\nThe exhibition will focus on photographic self-portraits made from 1969 to the present, utilizing a range of tools, from a medium-format camera to an iPhone.\n\nErica Deeman will direct a lighting and portraiture workshop at Medium Photo, San Diego on 25-26 April 2020.\n\nThe two-day workshop will examine the creative possibilities of studio lighting for expressive portraits.

Workshop participants should have an understanding of camera equipment and digital post-processing software. No previous lighting knowledge required.\n\n\"Zoe Leonard: The ties that bind\" is on view online at Hauser & Wirth from 11 April to 11 June 2020.\n\nNew York-based artist Zoe Leonard balances rigorous conceptualism with a distinctly personal vision in her work. By employing strategies of repetition, shifting perspectives, and a multitude of printing processes, Leonard’s practice probes the politics of representation and display. Leonard explores themes such as gender and sexuality, loss and mourning, migration, displacement, and the urban landscape.\n\nSarah Cain is included in \"RED\", an online group exhibition by Galerie Lelong & Co on view from 10 April to 8 May 2020.\n\nA primary color charged with connotations of the body, emotions, politics, and pop culture, \"RED\" brings together a display of how Galerie Lelong artists have interpreted and utilized the color in a myriad of media.\n\nZoe Leonard has been awarded a 2020 Guggenheim Fellowship.\n\nLeonard works with photography, sculpture, and site-specific installation. Leonard has exhibited widely in the U.S. and internationally since the early 1990s. A retrospective exhibition was presented by the Whitney Museum of American Art and Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles in 2018. She was awarded the Whitney Museum' Bucksbaum Prize in 2014 and received an Anonymous was a Woman Award in 2005. Leonard taught in the MFA program at Bard College where served as Co-Chair of Photography from 2011-2015.\n\nRodrigo Cass is included in the online only exhibition \"AAA - Anthology of Art and Architecture\", a collaboration between Fortes D'Aloia & Gabriel and Bergamin & Gomide and curated by Sol Camacho, that will be on view from 2 April to 31 July 2020.\n\nThrough a timeless and non-catalographic cut, \"AAA\" moves through the field of visual arts - between paintings, sculptures, videos - and architecture - with models, pieces of furniture and photographs of buildings. These are works that have architecture as their language: be it in the relationship between the construction of spaces and their representation; in the use of construction materials; or, still, in the subversion of language itself as a resource for experimentation with scale, composition and geometry.\n\nThe exhibition \"Sarah Cain: hand in hand\" will be on view at the Colby Museum of Art from 31 March 2020 to 13 December 2020.\n\nCain seeks out new territories for painting and frequently works at the scale of architecture. For the Colby Museum, she will create an on-site painting that will cover the full expanse of the lobby floor. In a space that functions as a gateway to the galleries, Cain’s hand in hand will be immersive and reorienting, evidencing change and transformation in response to experience, from the ground up.\n\nGary Simmons' solo exhibition \"Screaming into the Ether\" is on view at Metro Pictures. In light of the current circumstances facing New York, the exhibition will now be available exclusively online.\n\nGary Simmons's latest work expands the artist’s decades-long examination into the propagation of racial stereotypes through American media and its devastating effects on how people of color perceive themselves and are perceived by others. The twenty new paintings on view reconsider his signature “erasure” technique and the racist cartoon characters Simmons first appropriated in his renowned chalkboard drawings from the early 1990s.\n\nArtist Talk: Teresita Fernández will be in conversation with San Cha, moderated by author Josh Kun, at the Crossfade LAB in Phoenix, AZ from 7 to 9 pm.\n\nCrossfade LAB is an event series organized by CALA Alliance that presents thought-provoking conversations and performances with internationally known Latinx and Latin American artists.\n\nThe ninth edition of Crossfade LAB will stage a special meeting between celebrated visual artist and MacArthur fellow Teresita Fernández, and rising music and performance star San Cha. Moderated by author and Crossfade LAB co-curator Josh Kun, the evening will experiment, agitate, and shimmer, blending installations and sculptures with cumbias and telenovelas —a mix of sound and image that will take you across geographies of the Americas, from Cuba to Jalisco, the Bay Area to Miami, New York to LA.\n\nGary Simmons is included in \"Sanctuary: Recent Acquisitions to the Permanent Collection\", curated by Mar Hollingsworth, at the California African American Museum, Los Angeles from 18 March - 6 September 2020.\n\nSanctuary features recently acquired works that explore the concepts of safety and refuge as they relate to the African American experience. Whether real, staged, or imagined, the worlds depicted in these photographs and mixed-media works support complex narratives and assert the importance of claiming a place of one’s own.\n\nIn several instances, photographs are displayed alongside three-dimensional sculptural works by the same artist. For example, Gary Simmons’s photograph of an empty academic setting appears in tandem with one of his ghostly erased drawings of coniferous trees on a school chalkboard.\n\nMarsha Cottell will deliver Mary Baldwin University’s 2020 Firestone Lecture in Contemporary Art on 16 March 2020 at 7 pm.\n\nIn her work, Cottrell repurposes the functionality of an electrostatic office laser printer, computer, and screen, and inventively utilizes the tools’ capabilities to create luminous images in layers of carbon-black toner. Her seemingly alchemical process gives material form to an open-ended exploration of the tensions and interplay between nature and technology, body and machine, exterior and interior in images that evoke visionary or dreamlike states, nature, and the sublime.\n\nTeresita Fernandez will be included in the exhibition \"Bright Golden Haze\" at Oklahoma Contemporary from 13 March to 10 August 2020.\n\nThis inaugural exhibition uses the themes of light and place as a way to highlight connections across artistic media, cultures and geographic regions, from the plains of Oklahoma to global centers around the world. Titled \"Bright Golden Haze\", a reference to the first words in the iconic musical Oklahoma!, the exhibition includes artists of national and international renown alongside artists from our area to demonstrate the ways in which contemporary art can be both location-specific and universal.\n\nThe exhibition \"Kate Shepherd: Surveillance\" will be on view at Galerie Lelong, New York from 12 March - 18 April 2020.\n\nGalerie Lelong & Co. is pleased to present Surveillance, a solo exhibition of new paintings by New York-based artist Kate Shepherd.

European modernist art has been an important, yet complicated influence on black artists for more than a century. The powerful push and pull of this relationship constitutes a distinct tradition for many African American artists who have mined the narratives of art history, whether to find inspiration, mount a critique, or claim their own space.\n\nIn conjunction with his inclusion in the exhibtion \"Riffs and Relations: African American Artists and the European Modernist Tradition,\" Leonardo Drew will be in conversation with Renee Mauer, Associate Curator, at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. on 29 February 2020 at 6:30 pm.\n\nJanine Antoni will be included in \"Bodyscapes\" at the Israel Museum, Jerusalem from 21 February to 3 October 2020.\n\n\"Bodyscapes\" studies the concept of embodiment and the corpus as an organizing structure. Examining the relationship between nature and culture through the prism of the body, this exhibition brings together historical sources and artworks ranging from prehistory to contemporary art in a variety of media: works on paper, photographs, sculpture, paintings, video works, and installations.\n\nThe exhibition, \"Larry Bell: Still Standing,\" will be at Hauser & Wirth, New York from 20 February to 11 April 2020.\n\nOne of the most renowned and influential artists to emerge from the Los Angeles art scene of the 1960s, Larry Bell is known foremost for his refined surface treatment of glass and his explorations of light, reflection, and shadow. His experimentations with commercial industrial processes with high-vacuum coating systems and his interests in the optical qualities of glass led him to make work that investigates multiple ways of using light as a material.\n\nJanine Antoni will be included in \"Amuse-bouche. The Taste of Art\" at the Museum Tinguely from 19 February to 26 July 2020.\n\nWhat role does our sense of taste play in social interactions and as an artistic material? Museum Tinguely continues its series on the senses in the arts with a group show bringing together work by international artists who address our sense of taste as a possibility for aesthetic perception.\n\nRob Reynolds will be in conversation at the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles on 15 February 2020 at 1:30 pm.\n\nAs part of the new Berggruen Institute Transformations of the Human (ToftH) program, artist Rob Reynolds discusses his work as part of a TofTH project cluster on icebergs and the human with philosopher and anthropologist Tobias Rees and founder of Oceans & Ice Lab David Sutherland.\n\nKate Shepherd is included in the exhibition \"Unapologetic: All Women, All Year\" at Scottsdale Museum of Contemporary Art from 15 February 2020 to 31 January 2021.\n\n\"Unapologetic: All Women, All Year\" takes an in-depth look at works from SMoCA’s collection, highlighting diverse women artists whose work boldly and unapologetically parses topics such as identity, beauty, violence, and equality. As a result of historically being overlooked within the structure of art history, women constitute an average of less than 15% of the artists in museum collections nationally. For the year, SMoCA presents a selection of women artists from its collection to bring awareness to this lack of inclusion. This exhibition’s title conveys a sense of strength, signaling for systemic change within culture, where individuals of all gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, class, age, and ability see themselves represented within museums.\n\nIn 1992, motivated by an interest in Black authorship and self-fashioning, Simmons set up a portable photo studio with painted 'backdrop' paintings at Harlem’s Rucker Park basketball courts and the African Street Festival in Brooklyn, offering free Polaroids to those he photographed. The thirteen paintings that served as portrait backdrop were shown alongside the almost 850 instant photos at Metro Pictures in 1993.\n\nSimmons revives the project and will offer complimentary photographs to select participants during the run of Frieze Los Angeles from 14 - 16 February 2020.\n\nDave Muller is included in the exhibition \"50+50: A Creative Century from Chouinard to CalArts\", organized by Carmen Amengual and Michael Ned Holte, at REDCAT at the California Institute of the Arts from 12 February to 22 March 2020.\n\nFor this exhibitions, CalArts, in partnership with publisher Lisa Ivorian-Jones, will newly commission and sell limited artwork by a prominent group of 50 artist alumni. Representing a broad range of cross-disciplinary art-making, the 50 new editioned works will be released in curated groupings of 10 over the course of five years starting in February 2020.\n\nKate Shepherd is included in the ongoing exhibition \"The Blurred Discreteness of Colors\" at Hiram Butler Gallery.\n\nJanine Antoni is included in the exhibition \"All of Them Witches,\" organized by Dan Nadel and Laurie Simmons, at Jeffrey Deitch, Los Angeles from 8 February to 11 April 2020.\n\nThis exhibition arose from a conversation we’ve been having for years about our shared affinity for a certain kind of art to which we’re drawn, can’t quite name, but recognize when we see it. Artworks and artists that share an affinity with what we thought of as a “witchy” sensibility, which we see as using the iconography of the supernatural, occult, and witchcraft to channel ideas about power, the body, and gender.\n\nLeonardo Drew is included in \"Polyphonic: Celebrating PAMM's Fund for African American Art\" at the Perez Art Museum Miami from 7 February to 9 August 2020.\n\nIn 2017, after acquiring several now iconic works for the museum’s collection, and with new generous donations from the PAMM Ambassadors for African American Art and an additional matching grant from the Knight Foundation, Pérez Art Museum Miami created an endowed fund that today stands at almost $2 million.\n\n\"Polyphonic: Celebrating PAMM’s Fund for African American Art\" highlights a group of paintings, sculptures, and photographs that have since become quintessential for the museum. The title of the exhibition points to the idea of various, distinct artistic voices coming together in a spirit of harmony and solidarity.\n\nJim Hodges is included in the exhibition \"Psychic Wounds: On Art & Trauma\" at The Warehouse, Dallas from 6 February - 20 November 2020.\n\n\"Psychic Wounds: On Art & Trauma\" examines over 60 international artists whose memory of historical trauma has provided them with a unique power to generate works of art. Although there have been important examples of art that address wounding, scarring, and healing throughout the 20th century, the proliferation of violent imagery since World War II has led to new kinds of artworks that marshal consciousness of traumatic events and their cultural processing.\n\nGary Simmons is included in the exhibition \"Making Community: Prints from Brandywine Workshop and Archives, Brodsky Center at PAFA, and Paulson Fontaine Press\" from 1 February - 12 April 2020 at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.\n\n\"Making Community: Prints from Brandywine Workshop and Archives, Brodsky Center at PAFA, and Paulson Fontaine Press\" celebrates printmaking, a longstanding ever-expanding artistic form, especially at PAFA. This exhibition brings together an exceptional group of nearly one hundred artworks from PAFA's Permanent Collection, selected from nearly two hundred artworks in this medium that have recently been acquired by PAFA.\n\nLeonardo Drew will deliver an artist lecture on 6 February 2020 from 4:30 to 6 pm at the Manetti Shrem Museum of Art at UC Davis.\n\nDrew is known for creating reflective abstract sculptural works that play upon the dystopian tension between order and chaos, recalling post-minimalist sculpture that alludes to America’s industrial past, as well as the plight of African Americans throughout U.S. history. One could find many meanings in his work, but ultimately the cyclical nature of life and decay can be seen in his grids of transformed raw material to resemble and articulate entropy and a visual erosion of time.\n\nTam Van Tran is included in the exhibition \"Sample Platter - Contemporary Ceramic\" at the Guggenheim Gallery at Chapman University from 3 February to 15 March 2020.\n\nSample Platter shows the work of 20 artists investigating the medium of ceramics.

Over 100 feet long and 30 feet wide, the work is composed of aluminum panels covered in a mosaic pattern of colored sand, mimicking a Persian carpet.\n\nDave Muller is included in the exhibition \"New Images of Man,\" curated by Alison M. Gingeras, at Blum & Poe, Los Angeles from 1 February to 14 March 2020.\n\nThis exhibition revisits and expands upon the Museum of Modern Art’s eponymous 1959 group exhibition curated by Peter Selz that brought together artists whose work grappled with the human condition as well as emerging modes of humanist representation.\n\nPart homage, part radical revision, this two-floor presentation reconstitutes emblematic figures from the original MoMA line up of artists while simultaneously expanding outwards to include those of the same generation and period who were overlooked in the midcentury. This reprisal features forty-three artists hailing not only from the US and Western Europe, but also Cuba, Egypt, Haiti, India, Iran, Japan, Poland, Senegal, and Sudan.\n\nTony Feher is included in \"Color. Theory. & (b/w)\" at the Sarasota Art Museum, Florida from December 2019 to July 2020.\n\nThis is the first installation of an ongoing investigation into the art and science of color. The subject of color theory allows us to look at wide range of ideas, from cognitive science to philosophy to literature, while marveling at the seductiv"
