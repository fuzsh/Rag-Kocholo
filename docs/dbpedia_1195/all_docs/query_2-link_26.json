        "text": "Colorado Business Committee for the Arts (CBCA) is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that has been forging inspiring partnerships between business and the arts since 1985 through year-round advocacy, research, training and arts engagement efforts.\n\nAs a champion of artists, cultural organizations and creative industries, CBCA advances Denver and Colorado as a cultural hub and validates the arts as an integral part of our regional economy. CBCA also demonstrates that art is smart for business by providing the business community with access, exposure and visibility for their investment in the arts.\n\nIn 1984, Denver developer John Madden, Jr. brought together a distinguished, forward-thinking group of Colorado business leaders who believed in the importance and value of arts and culture. They were inspired by David Rockefeller’s national Business Committee for the Arts, which was formed in 1967 by a group of business leaders committed to demonstrating corporate social responsibility through supporting the arts. Under this model, CBCA was created in 1985 with the mission to educate, motivate and recognize business support for and participation in the arts in Colorado.\n\nCBCA was originally founded with a strong focus on the inherent benefits of nonprofit arts on the business community with services and programming primarily serving the private sector. CBCA has evolved to serve the mutually beneficial intersection of arts and business with industry-leading programs, trainings and cultural opportunities for members and the broad community. The organization’s work has also expanded to include the for-profit creative industries with programming, resources and professional development for individual artists and creative enterprises.\n\nAs an affiliate of Americans for the Arts, CBCA remains a successful membership organization of leading Colorado companies, individuals, artists and arts organizations.\n\nChristin (she/her/hers) joined Colorado Business Committee for the Arts (CBCA) as its Executive Director in February 2017. She is a past participant of CBCA’s Leadership Arts program and a recipient of CBCA’s Cultural Leadership Award in 2016.\n\nChristin is a seasoned professional with over 30 years’ experience in non-profit and for-profit leadership and management. The majority of her experience has been in the private sector having co-owned a public relations agency in Denver for over 10 years, as well as previously lead a performing arts nonprofit in the Denver metro area. She has experience working with organizations in many industry sectors spanning consumer, business-to-business and nonprofit. Her expertise includes strategic planning, communications, public relations, marketing, sales, development and fundraising.\n\nChristin served on the board of trustees for Colorado Ballet for 13 years, including serving as a past board co-chair, marketing chair, and on the executive and long-range planning committees. Today, she is an Emeritus Board Member of Colorado Ballet. She currently serves on the board of trustees for The Dance Archive at University of Denver, and was appointed in 2018 to the Private Sector Council of Americans for the Arts.\n\nA native of Michigan, Christin has been a resident of Denver since 1994, when she relocated from Chicago. She received her B.A. in Communications from Michigan State University.\n\nA “black belt ballerina,” in her spare time she continues to study ballet, which she’s done since age three, as well as train in the Korean martial arts of Taekwondo, Tang Soo Do and Hapkido, which she’s achieved the rank of 2nd Dan Black Belt over the past 12 years.\n\nMeredith Badler (she/her/hers) has been at Colorado Business Committee for the Arts (CBCA) since July 2013 and enjoys making a positive impact in Colorado through creativity and community partnerships every single day. As the Deputy Director, Meredith oversees all of CBCA’s programs and events, including the signature Leadership Arts program, annual statewide Business for the Arts Awards and biennial Economic Activity Study of Metro Denver Culture. During her tenure at CBCA, Meredith launched Colorado Attorneys for the Arts, Arts & Industry Forums, and the Advancing Creatives Intensive. Meredith also stewards CBCA’s grassroots and direct advocacy for the arts and creative industries on behalf of Colorado at the state and federal level. She is regularly asked to present on why art is smart for business, advocacy for the arts, and the value of our creative economy.\n\nPrior to CBCA, Meredith worked as a strategy consultant for the nonprofit and public sector at Corona Insights, facilitating board retreats and supporting strategic planning processes. She worked in patron services for Curious Theatre Company for several years and volunteered at Levitt Pavilion Denver.\n\nShe received a B.A. with honors in Comparative Literature and French Studies from Smith College. She was part of the Colorado Creative Industries Change Leader Institute in fall 2017. Today, Meredith serves on the Board of Directors for Art Students League of Denver and is Co-Chair of the Capacity Building Committee for the national Creative States Coalition. Meredith also serves as President of the Smith College Alumnae Club of Colorado. She has a background in theatre and still performs short and long-form improv comedy.\n\nSarah (she/her/hers) joined CBCA in August 2023. She brings years of experience working for and volunteering with nonprofit and government entities in Colorado and the Northeastern United States. Her work has included various aspects of fundraising, marketing, and administration, most recently with Anythink Libraries and previously with Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art (BMoCA). Sarah volunteered as a grant panelist for the City of Boulder's Office of Arts & Culture (2019), completed the Boulder County Leadership Fellows program (2020-21), and served on the board of Street Wise Arts (2021-23).\n\nSarah received her BA in English with minors in Dance and Journalism from University of Delaware and her MS in Arts Administration from Drexel University. When not supporting Colorado's creative industries, she can be found hiking in the Rocky Mountains, cycling with the Ride or Die Collective, and buying produce from local farmers.\n\nLindsey (she/her/hers) returned to her hometown of Denver, CO in 2019 after living and working in Austin, TX and Chicago. Lindsey comes to CBCA with an extensive background in the cultural, non-profit sector having most recently worked at Art Gym Denver as their Membership & Program Administrator, and previously at the MCA Denver, Denver Art Museum, Denver Botanic Gardens, and Colorado Ballet.\n\nLindsey received her BA in Art History from the University of Colorado at Boulder and her MA in Modern & Contemporary Art History, Theory, & Criticism and MA in Arts Administration & Policy from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nLindsey is also the Curatorial Director of Bell Projects, an art gallery that exhibits the work of local artists on a monthly rotation. As the Program and Events Coordinator at CBCA, Lindsey is excited to continue to support artists and their creative practices, and further Colorado's creative economy through the intersection of business and the arts."
