        "text": "“Our revenues are now over $5 billion annually. Without access to Tony and his teachings, Salesforce.com wouldn’t exist today.”\n\n– Marc Benioff, Founder of Salesforce.com\n\n“[Tony] distills the concepts of the best investors in the world into practical lessons that will benefit both naïve investors and skilled professionals.”\n\n– Ray Dalio, Founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund\n\nTony Robbins is the world’s most famous performance coach. He’s advised everyone from Bill Clinton to Serena Williams, and from Leonardo DiCaprio to Oprah (who calls him “superhuman”).\n\nFor years, you’ve also asked me to interview him in-depth — so here it is! I flew to Florida to spend time with Tony in his home, and what ensued was an epic two-part conversation. It covers just about everything imaginable. Special thanks to Joe Polish and Peter Diamandis for re-introducing us.\n\nEp 37: Tony Robbins on Morning Routines, Peak Performance, and Mastering Money\n\nEp 38: Tony Robbins (Part 2) on Morning Routines, Peak Performance, and Mastering Money\n\nMy visit coincided with his first new book in 20 years: Money–Master the Game.\n\nI love Tony’s work and it helped me start my first company, but when I got an early draft of the book, I thought to myself–really? Another book on money? Ugh. I prepared to be bored, especially since I think of myself as an experienced investor [pats self on back]. Instead, and very surprisingly, I was blown away. Before I knew it, I was pushing off other work, letting my dinner get cold, and staying up hours past bedtime each night, all because I couldn’t stop reading.\n\nWhy?\n\nFirst off, he saved me years of my life! Over the last 10 years, I’ve been approached by several top hedge fund managers, who’ve suggested I write The 4-Hour Investor by collaborating with them and their friends. Tony has written that book perfectly, so it saves me the trouble. I can just point people to this book. Which leads me to…\n\nReason number two, he goes DEEP with many of the investing icons I’ve always wanted to meet, including Paul Tudor Jones (who he’s coached for 10+ years), Ray Dalio, Carl Icahn, David Swensen, Kyle Bass, and many more. These are the hard-to-interview “unicorns” who consistently beat the market, despite the fact that it’s called impossible. In this book, they disclose details and examples I’ve never seen anywhere else, and I’ve read A LOT of books on investing. For me, the interviews alone were worth the entire book.\n\nIn the following interview, we dig into everything: Tony’s morning routines, his diet, how we works with the world’s highest-performing athletes and traders, common misconceptions about him, the most typical money mistakes he’s uncovered, and on and on. I even ask him to palm my entire face (Here’s the pic!).\n\nEnjoy!\n\nYou can find the transcript of Part 1 (Episode 37) here. You can find the transcript of Part 2 (Episode 38) here. Transcripts of all episodes can be found here.\n\nTons of links and goodies in show notes below…\n\nIf you can’t see the above embedded players, here are other ways to listen:\n\nListen to it on iTunes.\n\nStream by clicking Part 1 here and Part 2 here.\n\nDownload both as MP3 by right clicking (Part 1, Part 2) and choosing “save as”.\n\nThis podcast is brought to you by 99Designs, the world’s largest marketplace of graphic designers. Did you know I used 99Designs to rapid prototype the cover for The 4-Hour Body? Here are some of the impressive results.\n\nAlso, how would you like to join me and Sir Richard Branson on his private island for mentoring? It’s coming up soon, and it’s all-expenses-paid. Click here to learn more. It’s worth checking out.\n\nQUESTION(S) OF THE DAY: What is the best piece of investment advice you ever received or read? Please let me know in the comments.\n\nScroll below for all show notes, and thank you for listening!…\n\nDo you enjoy this podcast? If so, please leave a short review here.
