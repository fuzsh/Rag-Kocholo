        "text": "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is characterized by the selective expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying somatic mutations. While CHIP is typically asymptomatic, it has garnered substantial attention due to its association with the pathogenesis of multiple disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hematological malignancies. In this Review, we will discuss seminal and recent studies that have advanced our understanding of mechanisms that drive selection for mutant HSPCs in the BM niche. Next, we will address recent studies evaluating potential relationships between the clonal dynamics of CHIP and hematopoietic development across the lifespan. Next, we will examine the roles of systemic factors that can influence hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fitness, including inflammation, and exposures to cytotoxic agents in driving selection for CHIP clones. Furthermore, we will consider how — through their impact on the BM niche — lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, and psychosocial stressors, might contribute to the process of somatic evolution in the BM that culminates in CHIP. Finally, we will review the role of old age as a major driver of selection in CHIP.\n\nAortic aneurysms, particularly abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), exhibit sex differences, with higher prevalence and severity in males than females, both in humans and experimental mouse models. In fact, male sex has been considered as the most potent nonmodifiable risk factor for AAA. Currently, there are no medications approved for the treatment of aortic aneurysms, despite the high lethality of ruptured aneurysms, which account for nearly 2% of all deaths. Moreover, the underlying molecular mechanisms mediating the sexual dimorphism of aortic aneurysms remain largely unknown. In this issue of the JCI, Mu et al. revealed a mechanism by which androgens, male sex hormones, exacerbate aortic aneurysms by suppressing programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression in T cells in an aldosterone and high salt–induced aortic aneurysm mouse model.\n\nMigraines are a type of headache that occur with other neurological symptoms, but the pathophysiology remains unclear. In this issue of the JCI, Nelson-Maney and authors used constitutive and inducible knockouts of the CGRP receptor components, elegantly demonstrating an essential function of CGRP in modulating meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) in migraine. CGRP was shown to induce rearrangement of membrane-bound gap junction proteins in MLVs, resulting in a reduced CSF flux into cervical lymph nodes. The authors also provided evidence of a primary role for CGRP in modulating neuro-immune function. Finally, by showing that blocking CGRP signaling in MLVs attenuated pain behavior associated with acute migraine in rodents, the authors provided a target for pharmacological blockade of CGRP in relation to primary headache disorders.\n\nKisspeptin is an essential neuropeptide sitting at the apex of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) endocrine axis to regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and downstream reproductive hormones. Kisspeptin neurons integrate feedback from sex steroids facilitating regulation of the menstrual cycle and mediate the effects of metabolic stressors on the reproductive axis. In this issue of the JCI, Torres and colleagues describe another pathway for kisspeptin signaling in astrocytes to influence GnRH neuronal output. Astrocytes had kisspeptin receptors that activated canonical intracellular signaling pathways to constrain the magnitude of kisspeptin-induced GnRH neuronal stimulation. Additionally, the appositions between kisspeptin and GnRH neurons were dynamic during the ovarian cycle, with astrocyte kisspeptin signaling proposed as a putative modulator of this neuroplasticity. Importantly, astrocyte kisspeptin signaling also mediated susceptibility to metabolic stressors and the development of obesity-induced hypogonadism, underscoring the physiological and pathological importance of this pathway and revealing the importance of nonneuronal signaling in reproductive health.\n\nCerebral arteriovenous malformations represent the most common form of vascular malformations and can cause recurrent bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. The current issue of the JCI features an article by Zhao et al. describing a mouse model of cerebral arteriovenous malformations. Endothelial cells lacking matrix Gla protein, a BMP inhibitor, underwent epigenetic changes characteristic of an endothelial-to-mesenchymal fate transition. The authors uncovered a two-step process for this transition controlled by the epigenetic regulator histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), which controls endothelial cell differentiation, and by enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1), which suppressed mesenchymal fate. This discovery provides a promising entry point for preventive pharmacological interventions.\n\nNK cells are cytotoxic innate immune cells involved in antitumor immunity, and they provide a treatment option for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this issue of the JCI, Cubitt et al. investigated the role of CD8α, a coreceptor present on approximately 40% of human NK cells. IL-15 stimulation of CD8α– NK cells induced CD8α expression via the RUNX3 transcription factor, driving formation of a unique induced CD8α (iCD8α+) population. iCD8α+ NK cells displayed higher proliferation, metabolic activity, and antitumor cytotoxic function compared with preexisting CD8α+ and CD8α– subsets. Therefore, CD8α expression can be used to define a potential dynamic spectrum of NK cell expansion and function. Because these cells exhibit enhanced tumor control, they may be used to improve in NK cell therapies for patients with AML.\n\nGlomerular visceral epithelial cells (i.e., podocytes) are an essential component of the tripartite glomerular filtration barrier. Healthy podocytes are terminally differentiated cells with limited replicative capacity; however, inappropriate cell cycle reentry can be induced in podocytes by various injurious stimuli. In this issue of the JCI, Yamaguchi et al. report on a somatic mosaic gain-of-function mutation in the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic α subunit (p110α, encoded by PIK3CA). The study reveals that activating mutations of p110α can drive podocyte proliferation in PIK3CA-related overgrowth syndrome (PROS). They also showed that selective, small-molecule inhibitors of p110 may be useful for the treatment of proliferative glomerulonephritis.\n\nThe blood-brain barrier (BBB) acquires unique properties to regulate neuronal function during development. The formation of the BBB, which occurs in tandem with angiogenesis, is directed by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Yet the exact molecular interplay remains elusive. Our study reveals the G protein–coupled receptor GPR126 as a critical target of canonical Wnt signaling, essential for the development of the BBB’s distinctive vascular characteristics and its functional integrity. Endothelial cell–specific deletion of the Gpr126 gene in mice induced aberrant vascular morphogenesis, resulting in disrupted BBB organization. Simultaneously, heightened transcytosis in vitro compromised barrier integrity, resulting in enhanced vascular permeability. Mechanistically, GPR126 enhanced endothelial cell migration, pivotal for angiogenesis, acting through an interaction between LRP1 and β1 integrin, thereby balancing the levels of β1 integrin activation and recycling. Overall, we identified GPR126 as a specifier of an organotypic vascular structure, which sustained angiogenesis and guaranteed the acquisition of the BBB properties during development.\n\nIt is unknown which posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms are required for oncogenic competence. Here, we show that the LIN28 family of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), which facilitate posttranscriptional RNA metabolism within ribonucleoprotein networks, is essential for the initiation of diverse oncotypes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In HCC models driven by NRASG12V/Tp53, CTNNB1/YAP/Tp53, or AKT/Tp53, mice without Lin28a and Lin28b were markedly impaired in cancer initiation. We biochemically defined an oncofetal regulon of 15 factors connected to LIN28 through direct mRNA and protein interactions. Interestingly, all were RBPs and only 1 of 15 was a Let-7 target. Polysome profiling and reporter assays showed that LIN28B directly increased the translation of 8 of these 15 RBPs. As expected, overexpression of LIN28B and IGFBP1-3 was able to genetically rescue cancer initiation. Using this platform to probe components downstream of LIN28, we found that 8 target RBPs were able to restore NRASG12V/Tp53 cancer formation in Lin28a/Lin28b-deficient mice. Furthermore, these LIN28B targets promote cancer initiation through an increase in protein synthesis. LIN28B, central to an RNP regulon that increases translation of RBPs, is important for tumor initiation in the liver.\n\nThe identification of genes that confer either extension of life span or accelerate age-related decline was a step forward in understanding the mechanisms of aging and revealed that it is partially controlled by genetics and transcriptional programs. Here, we discovered that the human DNA sequence C16ORF70 encodes a protein, named MYTHO (macroautophagy and youth optimizer), which controls life span and health span. MYTHO protein is conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans and its mRNA was upregulated in aged mice and elderly people. Deletion of the orthologous myt-1 gene in C. elegans dramatically shortened life span and decreased animal survival upon exposure to oxidative stress. Mechanistically, MYTHO is required for autophagy likely because it acts as a scaffold that binds WIPI2 and BCAS3 to recruit and assemble the conjugation system at the phagophore, the nascent autophagosome. We conclude that MYTHO is a transcriptionally regulated initiator of autophagy that is central in promoting stress resistance and healthy aging.\n\nBACKGROUND The use of high-throughput technologies has enabled rapid advancement in the knowledge of host immune responses to pathogens. Our objective was to compare the repertoire, protection, and maternal factors associated with human milk antibodies to infectious pathogens in different economic and geographic locations.METHODS Using multipathogen protein microarrays, 878 milk and 94 paired serum samples collected from 695 women in 5 high and low-to-middle income countries (Bangladesh, Finland, Peru, Pakistan, and the United States) were assessed for specific IgA and IgG antibodies to 1,607 proteins from 30 enteric, respiratory, and bloodborne pathogens.RESULTS The antibody coverage across enteric and respiratory pathogens was highest in Bangladeshi and Pakistani cohorts and lowest in the U.S. and Finland. While some pathogens induced a dominant IgA response (Campylobacter, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter, Cryptosporidium, and pertussis), others elicited both IgA and IgG antibodies in milk and serum, possibly related to the invasiveness of the infection (Shigella, enteropathogenic E. coli “EPEC”, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Group B Streptococcus). Besides the differences between economic regions and decreases in concentrations over time, human milk IgA and IgG antibody concentrations were lower in mothers with high BMI and higher parity, respectively. In Bangladeshi infants, a higher specific IgA concentration in human milk was associated with delayed time to rotavirus infection, implying protective properties of antirotavirus antibodies, whereas a higher IgA antibody concentration was associated with greater incidence of Campylobacter infection.CONCLUSION This comprehensive assessment of human milk antibody profiles may be used to guide the development of passive protection strategies against infant morbidity and mortality.FUNDING Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant OPP1172222 (to KMJ); Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant OPP1066764 funded the MDIG trial (to DER); University of Rochester CTSI and Environmental Health Sciences Center funded the Rochester Lifestyle study (to RJL); and R01 AI043596 funded PROVIDE (to WAP).\n\nAndrogen has long been recognized for its pivotal role in the sexual dimorphism of cardiovascular diseases, including aortic aneurysms (AAs), a devastating vascular disease with a higher prevalence and fatality rate in men than in women. However, the mechanism by which androgen mediates AAs is largely unknown. Here, we found that male, not female, mice developed AAs when exposed to aldosterone and high salt (Aldo-salt). We revealed that androgen and androgen receptors (ARs) were crucial for this sexually dimorphic response to Aldo-salt. We identified programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), an immune checkpoint, as a key link between androgen and AAs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that administration of anti–PD-1 Ab and adoptive PD-1–deficient T cell transfer reinstated Aldo-salt–induced AAs in orchiectomized mice and that genetic deletion of PD-1 exacerbated AAs induced by a high-fat diet and angiotensin II (Ang II) in nonorchiectomized mice. Mechanistically, we discovered that the AR bound to the PD-1 promoter to suppress the expression of PD-1 in the spleen. Thus, our study unveils a mechanism by which androgen aggravates AAs by suppressing PD-1 expression in T cells. Moreover, our study suggests that some patients with cancer might benefit from screenings for AAs during immune checkpoint therapy.\n\nNeutrophil hyperactivity and neutrophil extracellular trap release (NETosis) appear to play important roles in the pathogenesis of the thromboinflammatory autoimmune disease known as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). The understanding of neutrophil metabolism has advanced tremendously in the past decade, and accumulating evidence suggests that a variety of metabolic pathways guide neutrophil activities in health and disease. Our previous work characterizing the transcriptome of APS neutrophils revealed that genes related to glycolysis, glycogenolysis, and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) were significantly upregulated. Here, we found that neutrophils from patients with APS used glycolysis more avidly than neutrophils from people in the healthy control group, especially when the neutrophils were from patients with APS with a history of microvascular disease. In vitro, inhibiting either glycolysis or the PPP tempered phorbol myristate acetate– and APS IgG–induced NETosis, but not NETosis triggered by a calcium ionophore. In mice, inhibiting either glycolysis or the PPP reduced neutrophil reactive oxygen species production and suppressed APS IgG–induced NETosis ex vivo. When APS-associated thrombosis was evaluated in mice, inhibiting either glycolysis or the PPP markedly suppressed thrombosis and circulating NET remnants. In summary, these data identify a potential role for restraining neutrophil glucose flux in the treatment of APS.\n\nOsteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type V is the second most common form of OI, distinguished by hyperplastic callus formation and calcification of the interosseous membranes, in addition to the bone fragility. It is caused by a recurrent, dominant pathogenic variant (c.-14C>T) in interferon-induced transmembrane protein 5 (IFITM5). Here, we generated a conditional Rosa26-knockin mouse model to study the mechanistic consequences of the recurrent mutation. Expression of the mutant Ifitm5 in osteo-chondroprogenitor or chondrogenic cells resulted in low bone mass and growth retardation. Mutant limbs showed impaired endochondral ossification, cartilage overgrowth, and abnormal growth plate architecture. The cartilage phenotype correlates with the pathology reported in patients with OI type V. Surprisingly, expression of mutant Ifitm5 in mature osteoblasts caused no obvious skeletal abnormalities. In contrast, earlier expression in osteo-chondroprogenitors was associated with an increase in the skeletal progenitor cell population within the periosteum. Lineage tracing showed that chondrogenic cells expressing the mutant Ifitm5 had decreased differentiation into osteoblastic cells in diaphyseal bone. Moreover, mutant IFITM5 disrupted early skeletal homeostasis in part by activating ERK signaling and downstream SOX9 protein, and inhibition of these pathways partially rescued the phenotype in mutant animals. These data identify the contribution of a signaling defect altering osteo-chondroprogenitor differentiation as a driver in the pathogenesis of OI type V.\n\nLeigh syndrome is the most common inherited mitochondrial disease in children and is often fatal within the first few years of life. In 2020, mutations in the gene encoding sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR), a mitochondrial protein, were identified as a cause of Leigh syndrome. Here, we report that mice with a mutation in the gene encoding SQOR (SqorΔN/ΔN mice), which prevented SQOR from entering mitochondria, had clinical and pathological manifestations of Leigh syndrome. SqorΔN/ΔN mice had increased blood lactate levels that were associated with markedly decreased complex IV activity and increased hydrogen sulfide (H2S) levels. Because H2S is produced by both gut microbiota and host tissue, we tested whether metronidazole (a broad-spectrum antibiotic) or a sulfur-restricted diet rescues SqorΔN/ΔN mice from developing Leigh syndrome. Daily treatment with metronidazole alleviated increased H2S levels, normalized complex IV activity and blood lactate levels, and prolonged the survival of SqorΔN/ΔN mice. Similarly, a sulfur-restricted diet normalized blood lactate levels and inhibited the development of Leigh syndrome. Taken together, these observations suggest that mitochondrial SQOR is essential to prevent systemic accumulation of H2S. Metronidazole administration and a sulfur-restricted diet may be therapeutic approaches to treatment of patients with Leigh syndrome caused by mutations in SQOR.\n\nMost children with medulloblastoma (MB) achieve remission, but some face very aggressive metastatic tumors. Their dismal outcome highlights the critical need to advance therapeutic approaches that benefit such high-risk patients. Minnelide, a clinically relevant analog of the natural product triptolide, has oncostatic activity in both preclinical and early clinical settings. Despite its efficacy and tolerable toxicity, this compound has not been evaluated in MB. Utilizing a bioinformatic data set that integrates cellular drug response data with gene expression, we predicted that Group 3 (G3) MB, which has a poor 5-year survival, would be sensitive to triptolide/Minnelide. We subsequently showed that both triptolide and Minnelide attenuate the viability of G3 MB cells ex vivo. Transcriptomic analyses identified MYC signaling, a pathologically relevant driver of G3 MB, as a downstream target of this class of drugs. We validated this MYC dependency in G3 MB cells and showed that triptolide exerts its efficacy by reducing both MYC transcription and MYC protein stability. Importantly, Minnelide acted on MYC to reduce tumor growth and leptomeningeal spread, which resulted in improved survival of G3 MB animal models. Moreover, Minnelide improved the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy, further highlighting its potential for the treatment of MYC-driven G3 MB.\n\nGNAO1 mutated in pediatric encephalopathies encodes the major neuronal G protein Gαo. Of the more than 80 pathogenic mutations, most are single amino acid substitutions spreading across the Gαo sequence. We performed extensive characterization of Gαo mutants, showing abnormal GTP uptake and hydrolysis and deficiencies in binding Gβγ and RGS19. Plasma membrane localization of Gαo was decreased for a subset of mutations that leads to epilepsy; dominant interactions with GPCRs also emerged for the more severe mutants. Pathogenic mutants massively gained interaction with Ric8A and, surprisingly, Ric8B proteins, relocalizing them from cytoplasm to Golgi. Of these 2 mandatory Gα-subunit chaperones, Ric8A is normally responsible for the Gαi/Gαo, Gαq, and Gα12/Gα13 subfamilies, and Ric8B solely responsible for Gαs/Gαolf. Ric8 mediates the disease dominance when engaging in neomorphic interactions with pathogenic Gαo through imbalance of the neuronal G protein signaling networks. As the strength of Gαo-Ric8B interactions correlates with disease severity, our study further identifies an efficient biomarker and predictor for clinical manifestations in GNAO1 encephalopathies. Our work uncovers the neomorphic molecular mechanism of mutations underlying pediatric encephalopathies and offers insights into other maladies caused by G protein malfunctioning and further genetic diseases.\n\nReproduction is safeguarded by multiple, often cooperative, regulatory networks. Kisspeptin signaling, via KISS1R, plays a fundamental role in reproductive control, primarily by regulation of hypothalamic GnRH neurons. We disclose herein a pathway for direct kisspeptin actions in astrocytes that contributes to central reproductive modulation. Protein-protein interaction and ontology analyses of hypothalamic proteomic profiles after kisspeptin stimulation revealed that glial/astrocyte markers are regulated by kisspeptin in mice. This glial-kisspeptin pathway was validated by the demonstrated expression of Kiss1r in mouse astrocytes in vivo and astrocyte cultures from humans, rats, and mice, where kisspeptin activated canonical intracellular signaling-pathways. Cellular coexpression of Kiss1r with the astrocyte markers GFAP and S100-β occurred in different brain regions, with higher percentage in Kiss1- and GnRH-enriched areas. Conditional ablation of Kiss1r in GFAP-positive cells in the G-KiR-KO mouse altered gene expression of key factors in PGE2 synthesis in astrocytes and perturbed astrocyte-GnRH neuronal appositions, as well as LH responses to kisspeptin and LH pulsatility, as surrogate marker of GnRH secretion. G-KiR-KO mice also displayed changes in reproductive responses to metabolic stress induced by high-fat diet, affecting female pubertal onset, estrous cyclicity, and LH-secretory profiles. Our data unveil a nonneuronal pathway for kisspeptin actions in astrocytes, which cooperates in fine-tuning the reproductive axis and its responses to metabolic stress.\n\nThe surface receptor CD8α is present on 20%–80% of human (but not mouse) NK cells, yet its function on NK cells remains poorly understood. CD8α expression on donor NK cells was associated with a lack of therapeutic responses in patients with leukemia in prior studies, thus, we hypothesized that CD8α may affect critical NK cell functions. Here, we discovered that CD8α– NK cells had improved control of leukemia in xenograft models compared with CD8α+ NK cells, likely due to an enhanced capacity for proliferation. Unexpectedly, we found that CD8α expression was induced on approximately 30% of previously CD8α– NK cells following IL-15 stimulation. These induced CD8α+ (iCD8α+) NK cells had the greatest proliferation, responses to IL-15 signaling, and metabolic activity compared with those that sustained existing CD8α expression (sustained CD8α+) or those that remained CD8α– (persistent CD8α–). These iCD8α+ cells originated from an IL-15Rβhi NK cell population, with CD8α expression dependent on the transcription factor RUNX3. Moreover, CD8A CRISPR/Cas9 deletion resulted in enhanced responses through the activating receptor NKp30, possibly by modulating KIR inhibitory function. Thus, CD8α status identified human NK cell capacity for IL-15–induced proliferation and metabolism in a time-dependent fashion, and its presence had a suppressive effect on NK cell–activating receptors.\n\nRecently developed antimigraine therapeutics targeting calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) signaling are effective, though their sites of activity remain elusive. Notably, the lymphatic vasculature is responsive to CGRP signaling, but whether meningeal lymphatic vessels (MLVs) contribute to migraine pathophysiology is unknown. Mice with lymphatic vasculature deficient in the CGRP receptor (CalcrliLEC mice) treated with nitroglycerin-mediated (NTG-mediated) chronic migraine exhibit reduced pain and light avoidance compared with NTG-treated littermate controls. Gene expression profiles of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) isolated from the meninges of Rpl22HA/+;Lyve1Cre RiboTag mice treated with NTG revealed increased MLV-immune interactions compared with cells from untreated mice. Interestingly, the relative abundance of mucosal vascular addressin cell adhesion molecule 1–interacting (MAdCAM1-interacting) CD4+ T cells was increased in the deep cervical lymph nodes of NTG-treated control mice but not in NTG-treated CalcrliLEC mice. Treatment of cultured hLECs with CGRP peptide in vitro induced vascular endothelial–cadherin (VE-cadherin) rearrangement and reduced functional permeability. Likewise, intra cisterna magna injection of CGRP caused rearrangement of VE-cadherin, decreased MLV uptake of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and impaired CSF drainage in control mice but not in CalcrliLEC mice. Collectively, these findings reveal a previously unrecognized role for lymphatics in chronic migraine, whereby CGRP signaling primes MLV-immune interactions and reduces CSF efflux.\n\nMost cases of human prion disease arise due to spontaneous misfolding of WT or mutant prion protein, yet recapitulating this event in animal models has proven challenging. It remains unclear whether spontaneous prion generation can occur within the mouse lifespan in the absence of protein overexpression and how disease-causing mutations affect prion strain properties. To address these issues, we generated knockin mice that express the misfolding-prone bank vole prion protein (BVPrP). While mice expressing WT BVPrP (I109 variant) remained free from neurological disease, a subset of mice expressing BVPrP with mutations (D178N or E200K) causing genetic prion disease developed progressive neurological illness. Brains from spontaneously ill knockin mice contained prion disease–specific neuropathological changes as well as atypical protease-resistant BVPrP. Moreover, brain extracts from spontaneously ill D178N- or E200K-mutant BVPrP–knockin mice exhibited prion seeding activity and transmitted disease to mice expressing WT BVPrP. Surprisingly, the properties of the D178N- and E200K-mutant prions appeared identical before and after transmission, suggesting that both mutations guide the formation of a similar atypical prion strain. These findings imply that knockin mice expressing mutant BVPrP spontaneously develop a bona fide prion disease and that mutations causing prion diseases may share a uniform initial mechanism of action.\n\nProliferative glomerulonephritis is a severe condition that often leads to kidney failure. There is a significant lack of effective treatment for these disorders. Here, following the identification of a somatic PIK3CA gain-of-function mutation in podocytes of a patient, we demonstrate using multiple genetically engineered mouse models, single-cell RNA sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics the crucial role played by this pathway for proliferative glomerulonephritis development by promoting podocyte proliferation, dedifferentiation, and inflammation. Additionally, we show that alpelisib, a PI3Kα inhibitor, improves glomerular lesions and kidney function in different mouse models of proliferative glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis by targeting podocytes. Surprisingly, we determined that pharmacological inhibition of PI3Kα affects B and T lymphocyte populations in lupus nephritis mouse models, with a decrease in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, autoantibodies, and glomerular complement deposition, which are all characteristic features of PI3Kδ inhibition, the primary PI3K isoform expressed in lymphocytes. Importantly, PI3Kα inhibition does not impact lymphocyte function under normal conditions. These findings were then confirmed in human lymphocytes isolated from patients with active lupus nephritis. In conclusion, we demonstrate the major role played by PI3Kα in proliferative glomerulonephritis and show that in this condition, alpelisib acts on both podocytes and the immune system.\n\nCerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are the most common vascular malformations worldwide and the leading cause of hemorrhagic strokes that may result in crippling neurological deficits. Here, using recently generated mouse models, we uncovered that cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) acquired mesenchymal markers and caused vascular malformations. Interestingly, we found that limiting endothelial histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) prevented cerebral ECs from undergoing mesenchymal differentiation and reduced cerebral AVMs. We found that endothelial expression of HDAC2 and enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (EZH1) was altered in cerebral AVMs. These alterations changed the abundance of H4K8ac and H3K27me in the genes regulating endothelial and mesenchymal differentiation, which caused the ECs to acquire mesenchymal characteristics and form AVMs. This investigation demonstrated that the induction of HDAC2 altered specific histone modifications, which resulted in mesenchymal characteristics in the ECs and cerebral AVMs. The results provide insight into the epigenetic impact on AVMs.\n\nAberrant activation of RAS/MAPK signaling is common in cancer, and efforts to inhibit pathway components have yielded drugs with promising clinical activities. Unfortunately, treatment-provoked adaptive resistance mechanisms inevitably develop, limiting their therapeutic potential. As a central node essential for receptor tyrosine kinase–mediated RAS activation, SHP2 has emerged as an attractive cancer target. Consequently, many SHP2 allosteric inhibitors are now in clinical testing. Here we discovered a previously unrecognized off-target effect associated with SHP2 allosteric inhibitors. We found that these inhibitors accumulate in the lysosome and block autophagic flux in an SHP2-independent manner. We showed that off-target autophagy inhibition by SHP2 allosteric inhibitors contributes to their antitumor activity. We also demonstrated that SHP2 allosteric inhibitors harboring this off-target activity not only suppress oncogenic RAS signaling but also overcome drug resistance such as MAPK rebound and protective autophagy in response to RAS/MAPK pathway blockage. Finally, we exemplified a therapeutic framework that harnesses both the on- and off-target activities of SHP2 allosteric inhibitors for improved treatment of mutant RAS–driven and drug-resistant malignancies such as pancreatic and colorectal cancers.\n\nInflammatory neuropathies, which include chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and Guillain Barré syndrome (GBS), result from autoimmune destruction of the PNS and are characterized by progressive weakness and sensory loss. CD4+ T cells play a key role in the autoimmune destruction of the PNS. Yet, key properties of pathogenic CD4+ T cells remain incompletely understood. Here, we used paired single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) and single-cell T cell receptor–sequencing (scTCR-Seq) of peripheral nerves from an inflammatory neuropathy mouse model to identify IL-21–expressing CD4+ T cells that were clonally expanded and multifunctional. These IL-21–expressing CD4+ T cells consisted of 2 transcriptionally distinct expanded cell populations, which expressed genes associated with T follicular helper (Tfh) and T peripheral helper (Tph) cell subsets. Remarkably, TCR clonotypes were shared between these 2 IL-21–expressing cell populations, suggesting a common lineage differentiation pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that IL-21 receptor–KO (IL-21R–KO) mice were protected from neuropathy development and had decreased immune infiltration into peripheral nerves. IL-21 signaling upregulated CXCR6, a chemokine receptor that promotes CD4+ T cell localization in peripheral nerves. Together, these findings point to IL-21 signaling, Tfh/Tph differentiation, and CXCR6-mediated cellular localization as potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory neuropathies.\n\nViral vectors are being used for the treatment of cancer. Yet, their efficacy varies among tumors and their use poses challenges in immunosuppressed patients, underscoring the need for alternatives. We report striking antitumoral effects by a nonlytic viral vector based on attenuated lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (r3LCMV). We show in multiple tumor models that injection of tumor-bearing mice with this vector results in improved tumor control and survival. Importantly, r3LCMV improved tumor control in immunodeficient Rag1–/– mice and MyD88–/– mice, suggesting that multiple pathways contributed to the antitumoral effects. The antitumoral effects of r3LCMV were also observed when this vector was administered several weeks before tumor challenges, suggesting the induction of trained immunity. Single-cell RNA sequencing analyses, antibody blockade experiments, and knockout models revealed a critical role for host-intrinsic IFN-I in the antitumoral efficacy of r3LCMV vectors. Collectively, these data demonstrate potent antitumoral effects by r3LCMV vectors and unveil multiple mechanisms underlying their antitumoral efficacy."
