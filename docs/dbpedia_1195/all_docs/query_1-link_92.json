        "text": "The 2024 iteration of the Art From The Heartland Biennial continues to demonstrate the power and breadth of contemporary art-practices throughout the Midwest. The work presented in this juried exhibition highlights artists that are balancing the traditions and history of the Midwest region with a wider, global contemporary practice. In this ever-intensifying, globalized, digital landscape, how does regionality inform contemporary artworks? The artists of the heartland are identified by their place, but through their individual practices, they also construct the very way we begin to define or redefine that place. This year’s exhibition was juried by Kyle Herrington, curator and mixed media artist.\n\nImage: Jessica Bowman, Souvenir\n\n“Welcome to Healing HeARTS, a testament to the power of art in fostering healing and growth. This exhibit showcases the work of more than a dozen individuals who have been impacted by gun violence. Through a transformative program facilitated by the Indy Art Center and Brooke’s Place, in partnership with the Indy Peace, participants have embarked on a ten-week journey of artistic exploration and peer support.\n\nDuring the program, participants expressed their feelings using various art techniques. With the help of instructors and grief support leaders, they found comfort and strength in creating art together. This experience became a safe space where they could share their emotions and connect with others who understood their journey.”\n\nImage: Collection of ceramic mugs made by program participants\n\nThe objects we adorn our bodies with are central to signaling identity, status, and even social belonging. Artists have always played a vital role in defining, challenging, and redefining trends in fashion- intimately influencing the very fabric of these concepts of identity. Artists featured in Garbled Guise explore various themes including gender, race, and class through wearable art. Some works explore the fantastical transformation of identity through costuming while others are honed examples of traditional craftsmanship. Viewers are invited to consider their biases and preconceptions that are often unconsciously tied to external signifiers like clothing.\n\nWhat kind of person would wear the objects displayed here? Does the object aid a specific activity or function? In turn, what does the clothing you currently wear say about you? After all, we’re all born naked, the rest is an actively constructed form of identity.\n\nImage: Patti Barker, Sea Crone\n\n“A hand on the shoulder to offer comfort, an elegant gesture reminiscent of old masterwork paintings, body language that reveals pent-up frustration or anxiety—Collective Gestures addresses the ways we communicate with each other visually, through body language. Studies show the majority of our more honest communication is non-verbal. With so much of our dialogue today being through digital means, face-to-face connections are diminishing and our more authentic feelings are being overlooked. My pieces point out various gestures or postures and their associated meanings, in the hope viewers will realize the importance of how our bodies speak for us. Although my work may have a machined look, every part, down to the screws and rivets, are made entirely by hand. Each is a one-of-a-kind piece that is carefully designed, hand fabricated and formed, soldered and/or cold connected, using traditional jewelry and metalsmithing techniques. An old proverb rightfully claims, “actions speak louder than words.” Through this exhibition, I invite the viewer to ponder the reasons and implications of our seemingly casual gestures.” -Jennifer Crupi\n\nImage: Jennifer Crupi, Tools for Contact\n\nWhat makes a community? At the Indy Art Center, we build community through art. Every year, the Art Center’s ArtReach program provides community-based art education to youth ages five to eighteen across Indianapolis. Through weekly classes at local schools, community centers, and shelters, ArtReach brings students together to explore the power of creativity and self-expression.\n\nThe Biannual ArtReach Exhibition is a celebration of the exciting creations and personal discoveries that take place during a semester of ArtReach. Last fall, students centered their work around the concept of community. Using a wide range of mediums, each project expresses a sense of community that is uniquely inspiring, colorful, and beautiful – just like the city we live in, love, and serve. Through programs like ArtReach, the Art Center is committed to building a more vibrant and inclusive community with access to arts experiences for all who wish to engage in creativity.\n\nMajor funding for the Biannual ArtReach Exhibition supported by the Katharine B. Sutphin Foundation\n\nImage: Collaborative ArtReach Work\n\nThe JoeWill Series: Inseparable is a two person exhibition of artworks by twin brothers Joe and Will Lawrance. Through diverse media, themes, and subjects this series tells the stories of two burgeoning Indianapolis-born artists whose lives tragically ended as young adults. Joe and Will Lawrance, born in 1985, were identical twin brothers that shared a deep, powerful bond to one another. The two were so interconnected and inseparable that their names morphed into the compound name, JoeWill, as a means of referring to their collective identity.\n\nHere you will find a collection of artwork that begins to illustrate the complex identities of JoeWill through photorealistic portraits and surrealist expressions of their own bodies. While the portraits are remarkable for their craft and honed technique, a portrait can also be much more than the captured physical likeness of its subject. Portraiture wields a transformative power that allows us, the viewer, to see ourselves in reinvented form. Both Joe and Will depict their likenesses with a raw honesty, never omitting blemishes and often opting for angles and lighting that, while visually striking, are not conventionally flattering. Free of any egoistic ambition, we see reflections of the very way Joe and Will saw themselves.\n\nImage: Will Lawrance, Glistening\n\nIn the 86th iteration of the Annual Student Show, the versatility and vibrancy of the Art Center’s studios is on full display. This campus offers a massive range of classes with facilities that are not easily found elsewhere in the community. Whether a student is designing comic book characters in a Summer Art Camp or is rekindling their creative spirit in their retirement through a wheel throwing class, the Art Center and its faculty offer the resources, mentorship, and inspiration to aid its students in making truly exciting discoveries.\n\nAs you walk through the galleries, you will find artworks created by students of the Art Center in the last twelve months. These students range in age from two to eighty two with artistic backgrounds ranging from beginning to professional-level artists. The themes, ambitions, and intentions of the objects displayed in this exhibition are as varied as the artists that created them. The diverse sampler of works featured in the 86th Annual Student Show is an illustration of the unique community of students that make the Art Center a place that inspires creative expression in all people.\n\nChruchman-Fehsenfeld Gallery, Sarah M.

Clowes Gallery\n\nImage: Craig McDaniel, Garden with Heater\n\nRefugees from Myanmar (Burma) and the Democratic Republic of Congo share a belief in freedom and democracy, even with different cultures and languages. The art in this exhibit explores how each of these countries have experienced significant conflict and distress that has led people to flee their homes.\n\nMany of the featured artists have sent their work from around the U.S., Thailand, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to be displayed at the Indianapolis Art Center. They would like to share their thanks to the Indianapolis public for enjoying their artworks.\n\nCommunity Gallery, Ruth Lilly Library\n\nImage: Unknown Congolese Artist, Unknown Title\n\nThe 2023 College Invitational exhibition is a disparate, wide ranging, and often unwieldy collection of artworks. With students from over 25 universities across 20 states represented, this exhibition represents a survey of art school ecosystems across the country. Art school offers makers a unique environment to explore, play, make mistakes, and receive critical feedback. This is the formative time in an artist’s career in which they discover their visual identity. Art students are often granted studio spaces by their university to make these investigations and discoveries. This dedicated space affords freedom to the students to work at large scale and in cumbersome or particular media that may not be suitable in a home-studio environment.\n\nIt’s also important to consider the landscape of higher education in America as you move through the galleries and examine the pieces made in these academic environments. The cost to attend college is higher than ever, often leaving students burdened with massive student loans. The economic reality of the job market upon graduating is often bleak. And yet, students continue to enroll, continue to pursue art degrees, and continue to make truly amazing artworks. This perseverance is a signal of hope for the future. The commitment to an arts education is a testament of resilience and strength innate to artists. Artists, and art, will persist.\n\nFrank M. Basile Exhibition Hall\n\nImage: Frankie Malafronte, Apologetics\n\n“It started years ago, in the last year of college, with two semesters of ceramics. Not having the opportunity to pursue more of what I enjoyed so much, it still had a hold on me.\n\nThen, after retirement, came the Indy Art Center. The goal in taking the first class was to see if I could center the clay. If so, I would call it a success and be happy. Six years have passed and I still can’t stop.\n\nThe IAC has been a home for me. Not only does it have a wide variety of art experiences and classes, it is alive with so many activities and events. Parents and their children, teens, veterans, and couples doing new things together. It hosts weddings, meetings, film, music, exhibits, the Broad Ripple Art Fair and so much more in the building and on the grounds.\n\nThe instructors at the IAC keep up with new trends and techniques and are passionate about their medium. They help students to learn and grow and inspire creativity. Other students are not only fun to be with but learning from others is an added bonus.\n\nAll of that has brought me into this.\n\nAnd the journey, my journey, continues.” -Connie A. Slater\n\nSarah M. Hurt Gallery\n\nArtTroop is a free 10-month program designed to empower military veterans and service members through creativity and self-expression. Throughout the program, participants build upon their existing artistic skills and learn new techniques in a variety of art media. This exhibition features the work of our current ArtTroop cohort and program alumni.\n\nStudies continually demonstrate the power of art-making in transforming the lives of veterans adjusting to life after service. Engaging in creative practices promotes emotional awareness, self-confidence, and personal agency – and when these practices take place within a shared environment, the outcomes are even greater. ArtTroop strives to create a positive and stress-free atmosphere to help students build artistic confidence, discover new passions, and develop a creative community with fellow members of the Armed Forces.\n\nWe invite you to navigate this exhibition as both viewers and artists. Explore the work of our veteran community, participate in our collaborative installations, and reflect on the significance of community in your own life.\n\nStudent Gallery\n\nImages: Great Blue Heron, Laurie Hardin\n\nArtTroop is presented by Jim and Pat LaCrosse.\n\nPermaculture is an approach to land cultivation that adopts methods naturally found in a given ecosystem to find harmony and sustainability between human settlements and nature. Permaculture, as a philosophy, is an embrace of the cycle of life and a recognition that ecological resilience is inextricably connected to the environment in its natural state.\n\nThe natural world is an unmistakable, unshakable interest for contemporary artists. The work in Permaculture taps into the deep, historical traditions of landscape and still life painting while pushing those traditions beyond their typical contexts. The pieces here range widely in media but all, ultimately, reflect the connection between the natural and man-made world.\n\nSome works in this exhibition harness materials sourced directly from the natural world. Artists tap into the intrigue, detail, and textures of these raw materials that become landscape-microcosms in and of themselves. This collection of works leaves us to consider what we leave imprinted upon our landscape and, in turn, what it imprints upon us. What does a harmonious relationship with nature look like? Can art be an effective tool in reconsidering environmental sustainability?\n\nChurchman-Fehsenfeld Gallery + Frank M. Basile Exhibition Hall\n\nImages: Dawnice Kerchaert, Luna & Marcia Couet, Iris Garden\n\nCaroline Pyle has worked as a public health professional since graduating from Boston and Yale Universities. After a near-fatal car accident devastated her life, she turned to art as a form of physical and cognitive therapy. Though she worked in the field of public health prior to the accident, she did not fully understand the intense connection between creativity andpersonal health until after the accident. “Painting was the only time I experienced a pain-free existence. I was in a blissful zone,” Pyle says. “When I painted, the vibrancy that was trapped inside of me, exploded on canvas. I realized I was still alive in my otherwise broken body…”\n\nA self-taught abstract artist, Pyle gives her emotions a clear voice, allowing pain and brokenness to be articulated through beauty. Pyle reflects, “After you’ve been shattered, your breaks make you more brilliant, much like shards of glass. The breaks experienced in life add texture, vibrancy and perspective”. Vivid color combinations are the hallmark of Pyle’s dramatic works as well as liberal use of mediums such as glass, gels and pastes. She has learned that life is not a neat package of black and white. Rather, life is filled with colorful moments that transform, alter and often forever change who we are – it’s color outside the lines.\n\nPyle’s newly discovered passion for creativity, which was first a means of personal survival, has now become a voice of hope for broader audiences. She has exhibited nationally, and her original works of art can be found in select fine art galleries and retail outlets.\n\nRuth Lilly Library\n\nStarting from nowhere and ending anywhere, this book crawls, folds and blooms. Every turn of a page takes on a new shape. Life is full of moments like this and it can be difficult sometimes to accept the unknown paths that unfold. The structure of this meandering book is an exercise in the exploration and willingness to let a path unfold. As interesting as it is to see how this book expands and collapses, we must also examine our own lives with the same excitement for the unknown.\n\nFrank M. Basile Exhibition Hall\n\nTo view this as a virtual exhibition, click here.\n\nJoeWill: BetterTogether is a two-person exhibition of artworks by twin brothers Joe and Will Lawrance. Joe and Will were deeply connected, expressed through their mutual devotion to art-making. Through diverse media, themes, and subjects BetterTogether tells the stories of two burgeoning Indianapolis-born artists whose lives tragically ended as young adults. BetterTogether traces the creative prowess of the Lawrances, the significance of art-making as a means of self-expression, and the profound impact these two artists leave behind.\n\n“The primary aim in my work is to illustrate concepts that I find enthralling. The resulting objects are layered formally and conceptually. I hope to show an equal blending of art and craft while presenting engaging ideas in intriguing ways. The works are meant to involve the viewer visually and intellectually.\n\nMy sources include mythology, politics, history, and American Folk Art. The objects I make reflect the sensibilities of a person steeped in New England practicality who (for better or worse) ended up learning about things like art history, existentialist philosophy, and post-structuralist theory.\n\nCraft is an important aspect of my work. I identify strongly with the idea of the artist as a kind of Daedalean hybrid: artist/artisan/shaman. It is my hope that my works will, in some small way, enrich viewers and make them see the world as slightly more tragic or laughable (or possibly both at the same time).” -Rob Millard-Mendez"
