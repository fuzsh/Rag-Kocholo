        "text": "Overview\n\nThe health care environment is a high stress experience for many patients and staff. In addition to their personal stressors, many patients have significant amounts of anxiety regarding the visit itself, including how they will be treated or if the provider will find a problem. Providers must manage their own personal stressors while providing empathy, caring, active listening, and clear thinking to patients and colleagues in a time-constrained encounter that also demands completion of required administrative tasks.\n\nIn addition to its relationship to overall patient and staff satisfaction, stress in the health care environment is important for how it affects decision-making and other executive functions (EFs) as well as how people will subconsciously spread their emotions to one another. An important aspect of the health care experience—the waiting room environment—can either exacerbate or attenuate that stress. In order to better appreciate this complex dynamic, a brief review of the impact of stress is provided accompanied by how the waiting room environment-with a focus on the effects of media—can alter the patient's and the provider's experience."
