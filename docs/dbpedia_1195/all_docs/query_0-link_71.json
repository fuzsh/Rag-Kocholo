        "text": "The 21st century has witnessed a resurgence of performance art, causing a corresponding change in art institutional practices, and unprecedented curatorial discussions of the institutionalization and commercialization of this art form. In recent years, there has been a steep increase in the number of artists working with performance, broadening its definition to other disciplines such as dance, theater and music, and characterized by an emphasis for action within institutions and a total inclusion of the audience. By examining closely the artistic practice of artists such as Tino Sehgal and Marina Abramovic, the thesis will underline the main elements that enable museums, biennials and galleries to collect, conserve and sell contemporary performance. Precisely, this study will explore how contemporary artists have incorporated the notion of reproducibility within their works, which supports their institutionalization. In addition, it will investigate how the shifting role of institutions from places of contemplation to sites for active physical engagement has led to fundamental structural changes, and will demonstrate how the new performance format emerging in the 21st century fully embraces its institutionalization. By focusing on museums, biennials and galleries, this study will cover the three major types of art institution, and I will analyze their developing practices and strategies in relation to performance art.\n\nThe chatter of a roomful of museum workers turned to silence the minute Tania Bruguera walked into the auditorium at the Museum of Modern Art in Rio de Janeiro. The Cuban installation and performance artist was a keynote speaker at the International Committee for Museums and Collections of Modern Art conference, 1 which this year focused on new dynamics in museums and the relationship between curator, artwork, public and governance. The crowd of art institution experts knew what Bruguera represents and her importance, and all attention was focused on her words. Bruguera, who was born in Cuba in 1968, now divides her time between New York and Havana. Her work came to prominence following her series Homenaje a Ana Mendieta, recreations of body performances and objects in tribute to her compatriot. A long-term project that lasted from 1985 to 1996, it also included lengthy research into her predecessor's legacy. Political gestures were already present at the inception of Bruguera's practice, but became even more noticeable with short-term interventions such as Tatlin's Whisper #6 at the 10th Havana Biennial, in 2009. Bruguera negotiated with the authorities the building of a podium at the exhibition with an open-microphone at which anyone who dared to climb the stairs would be given one minute of free speech in which they could say whatever they wanted. She has participated in several biennials worldwide as well as at Documenta 11 in Germany, and her artworks feature in the collections of many important art institutions. On top of that, she is internationally acclaimed for her most recent projects, including the socio-political Immigrant Movement International, which aims to raise awareness about immigrants, and Arte Útil. Last year, she received recognition from the United Nation's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights when invited to collaborate in writing a document to establish cultural rights and artistic freedom of speech. This was the background for her talk to delegates of 159 art institutions from about 50 cities from New York to Singapore. There was tension in the air. What would this woman's message to the art institutions be? Nothing surprising happened. At least, nothing as surprising as Bruguera's performance of Self-Sabotage at the 2009 Venice Biennial when, arriving to speak on \"the idea of survival\", she sat with a revolver on the table, pausing from time to time during her reading to hold the gun to her head in a game of real-life Russian roulette. In Rio, there was no shotgun, but rather discursive ammunition. She caused unease by speaking about an urgent and complicated matter: political art and art as an agent for social change. How can art history, through its institutions, address this emphasis on the socially engaged kind of artistic practice that we see nowadays? Our voice as protagonist-a meeting with Tania Bruguera https://www.studiointernational.com/index.php/our-voice-as-prota...\n\n\"This collection of interviews formulates a discussion on authorship in contemporary arts production and curation. Artur Zmijewski discusses his curation of the 7th Berlin Biennial, Forget Fear (2012), which set out to investigate the role of art and its effectiveness within contemporary politics. Zmijewski reflects on the controversy associated with the biennial, as well as deciding to including his own work in the exhibition, Berek (1999). Raqs Media Collective, discuss joint-authorship and working across disciplines as both artists and curators. With particular emphasis on their latest project, Sarai: a program initiated in 2000, as part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, India. They present a range of models for successful collaboration with participants and how authorship can be shared. Marion von Osten reflects on her practice as both an artist and as a curator, and what can be learned from both practices; defining herself as an “initiator-curator”. After working with several influential German curators, such as Kathrin Rhomberg and Beatrice von Bismarck; von Osten reflects on the process of collaboration and the question of “equal” authorship. Artist-curator Gavin Wade discusses his approach to curating and art making and how the two disciplines can intersect with one another. Wade discusses his 5 Acts of Art [4] where he proposes that art is exhibition, that art is not exhibited but that art exhibits, that exhibition is a fundamental function of being human, and the fundamental process of art. The collective Fucking Good Art discuss their collaborative approach to art making and how their practice intersects with curating and research. Their recent publication, Italian Conversations: Art in the age of Berlusconi (2011) offers a glimpse into Italy’s contemporary art scene and pays tribute to a tradition of artists publications that emerged during the 1970s. Curator, Valerie Smith discusses her approach to curating Sonsbeek 93 (1993), and how her process of engagement was influenced by other models at the time. Smith discusses her role as a producer – in constant dialogue with artists – to create an entire concept with complete authorial control. The curator Mary Jane Jacob engages in a discussion about authorship, curatorial practice and the history and future of public art. Jacob considers her role in the site-specific exhibition Culture in Action (1995) and her development of community-based projects. Both Jacob and Smith paved the way for socially engaged art work, their exhibitions in the 1990s framed the discussion of art’s renewed interest in the social during this period [5]. Kristina Lee Podesva reflects on authorships’ possible disappearance in the art-pedagogical field, by looking specifically at her colourschool (2006/7) project within her artistic and curatorial practice; in relation to historical, societal, political, economical and cultural contexts. Long-standing collaborators, Ute Meta Bauer & Yvonne P. Doderer engage in a dialogue about audience – specifically how the public sees the outcome before the curator or artist – and what it means to work as a women in the global, (often) male dominated art world. The artist and initiator of the Immigrant Movement International, Tania Bruguera, reflects on her work with immigrants and how her work is viewed in the contemporary art world. As an advocate of political work, Bruguera talks frankly about some of her early work and contribution to Cuba’s art education, by founding Arte de Conducta (2002-2009) and her responsible approach to art making. Finally, Marc James Léger’s essay, ‘Homo Academicus Curatorius: Millet Matrix’ as Intercultural Paradigm, considers the curator-as-analyst by examining the collaborative exchanges between two Montreal-based artists: Rosika Desnoyers and David Tomas. Dorothee Richter’s essay, Artists and Curators as Authors – Competitors, Collaborators, or Team workers? discusses artistic and curatorial authorship, from a historical position, in the context of Harald Szeemann’s curatorship of Documenta 5; as well as using the case studies of Fluxus and the Curating Degree Zero Archive.\""
