First as my teacher at Pratt Institute, when I went through the graduate art therapy program in 1971- 73, then later he became a colleague when we both taught at the Pratt New Hampshire Summer Institute for 10 years, where we both taught and created art together during the 1980s. He made welded metal art while I worked on stone carving. We often took breaks to critique each otherâ€™s work. Our families grew up together during those years in the White Mountains and still, to this day, stay in touch on special occasions. He was such an important and inspiring figure in my life that after graduating with my masters degree I decided to go on for psychoanalytic training at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis where Art had trained and later became involved in their training program, serving as a faculty member and supervisor for many years. He started the clinic at NPAP and helped spearhead the movement that Freud envisioned by making high quality psychoanalytic treatment available to the masses through low fee referrals. His specialization was in group processing of countertransference within a special clinical seminar that he conducted there. He also held private clinical supervision groups right up until the end of his life.\n\nHe became a dear friend during those formative years and during the many years since, our friendship continued to evolve and grow. As both artists and clinicians we shared a unique view of the world and often enjoyed long talks on the state of the world and clinical theories. He was always available as a source of wisdom and grounding during the inevitable challenges I have faced during my life, and I like to believe I was also there for him in that way as well.\n\nAbove is a digital copy of special photo I took of him hugging a tree up at the Pratt Institute summer program about 40 years ago. It is a silver gelatin print that I hand colored with photographic oil paint. I think I captures a special part of him through the mischievous sparkle in his eyes. He loved to challenge and provoke introspection and growth. As the many Pratt graduates may attest to, he would at times push you out of your comfort zone with a caring persistence that was always motivated by his desire to help people grow. I know he will be dearly missed by the many people whose lives he changed. I know I already miss him."
