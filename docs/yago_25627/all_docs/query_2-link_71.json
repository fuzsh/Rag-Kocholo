        "text": "Watch The Trailer For One Life\n\nOne Life details the incredible story of Sir Nicholas Winton who helped save 669 children from central Europe during World War Two and while the British humanitarian tragically died in 2015, much of his family appeared at the film’s London premiere.\n\nAmong the countless faces on the red carpet were Henry Warriner and his wife, the nephew of Doreen Warriner who alongside Trevor Chadwick helped Sir Nicholas compile the lists of children and travelled with them on the Kindertransport trains to the UK.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Express, Henry chuckled as he noted he’d never imagined being on a red carpet and lamented that due to the SAG-AFTRA strikes at the time he wasn’t able to meet the cast, more specifically BBC star Romola Garai who plays his aunt in the new film.\n\nHe explained: “It was my aunt Doreen Warriner who features in the beginning of the film, so I would love to know how they worked out how to play her because I knew her very well.”\n\nWhen the couple first heard about One Life’s production they were incredibly concerned about how Doreen would be portrayed, adding: “I think we’re the last two who remember her.”\n\nREAD MORE: Michael Caine to 'come out of retirement' for Netflix series months after announcement\n\nHenry revealed he had been in touch with the film company for years during filming but admitted: “We didn’t know if she was going to be Nicholas Winters’ mistress or a Nazi spy or what.\n\n“I think it’s actually very very kind and portrays her as she was.”\n\nAs for Sir Nicholas, portrayed by Sir Anthony Hopkins, his son Nick is still in awe of the impeccable casting, telling Express: “The way he captures my father’s mannerisms, it’s uncanny.\n\n“I was in tears: ‘That’s him! He’s there!’ I know that Sir Anthony did a lot of work in preparing, looking at footage of my father and how he behaved, boy has he got it to a tee! It’s just astonishing.”\n\nDon't miss...\n\nLa La Land in Concert review - worth making a song and dance about [REVIEW]\n\nThe Holiday fans share disturbing theory about Jude Law's charming Graham [INSIGHT]\n\nQueen Elizabeth's favourite Christmas film was a surprising choice for royalty [LATEST]\n\nNick, much like his father, doesn’t quite like having the spotlight on him and was rather looking forward to seeing what impact the Hollywood film will have on the big screen but admitted the project didn’t come without some qualms.\n\nHe shared: “One of the things that I struggle with a little is that Pa is recognized for saving 669 children in 1939…\n\n“He lived for 106 years and that was nine months in a part-time project after he finished work. He did so many other things and this story just touches on the fact that he also made a big difference on lots of other ways.”\n\nWhen asked about the pressure of living up to his father’s legacy, Nick casually chuckled and declared: “I’m still working out what I want to do when I grow up.”\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
