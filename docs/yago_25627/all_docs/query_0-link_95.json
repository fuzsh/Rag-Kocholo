        "text": "Jane Birkin is crouched on the studio floor, her lunch spread out around her. She looks as if she's about to conduct a seance, reading portents in the pitta bread and celery sticks. At 51, Birkin has a wild, witchy look, with hair long and straggly, and a baggy jumper that she yanks at absent-mindedly. She speaks as breathily as she sings on her recordings as a French variétés chanteuse, and the words come out in an airy monotone.\n\nAlong with the enduring traces of her 60s gamine persona, there's an unsettling touch of the Delphic oracle about Jane Birkin. It makes sense that three years ago she became a classic tragedian, acting in Annie Castledine's production of Euripides' Women of Troy at the National. \"Annie said to me, 'You are Andromache!' So!\"\n\nBirkin is in London to record a radio version of her play Oh Sorry, Were You Asleep? A two-hander for characters simply called Elle and Lui, it is, if you believe the press release, all about her long-term relationship with French singer, writer and counter- culture icon Serge Gainsbourg.\n\nBut put this to Birkin and she insists not, although she does admit that Elle is inspired by herself: \"She's an actress and she's insecure, and she has a sort of sickness, being nostalgic about the beginnings of things, of relationships - of how people used to see you off on the train, even run a bit as the train was moving out. Yes!\" she exclaims, with a little rapturous pause, \"They'd kiss you in the park, they couldn't wait even for you to take your coat off.\"\n\nSince Birkin has a habit of referring to herself as \"you\", it's never clear whether she's talking specifically about the play or the personal experiences that apparently inform it. Twisting her hands as if sculpting the air, she explains that, 10 years after writing the play, she's beginning to feel more sympathy for the male character. \"I've known the sort of relationship where perhaps I've said, 'I've looked after you for a long time and now I just want to try and do something, even if it's not important, even if it's not a grand work, I want to do something, just me,'\" A child-like pleading tone enters her voice and it's hard not to play psychoanalyst, listening to someone whose unconscious seems so near the surface.\n\nBirkin's strangeness is heightened by the cross-Channel traces in her accent. Having lived in Paris for 30 years, she drops in quaint Anglicisms (\"awfully\") and bits of Franglais (her play was \"subventioned\" rather than funded). She's extremely actressy, with stories of directors embracing her and swearing they'd never hurt her. When the Guardian photographer, possibly winding her up a touch, says he's wanted all his life to take her picture, she clasps him in her arms: \"Oh thank you!\"\n\nBirkin was never quite taken seriously until the early 80s, when her partner at the time, director Jacques Doillon, cast her austerely against her sex-doll image. Since then, she's done distinguished screen work for heavyweights like Jacques Rivette (La Belle Noiseuse) and Bertrand Tavernier (These Foolish Things). Her most recent film is theatre director Deborah Warner's The Last September. She's also tried directing, and originally made Oh Sorry as a TV film. \"I did it in an incredibly small space. I wanted to go round the bed and be so close to their bodies that it would become like a western - to make a knee or a hair or a hand or a leg as interesting as mountains and desert.\"\n\nIn Britain, Birkin is still best known for gasping through Gainsbourg's steamy hit Je t'aime moi non plus in 1969. Her diva status in France rests more on the punning ballads he wrote for her (Baby Alone in Babylone, C'est con ces conséquences). When their 13-year relationship broke up, she went on performing his songs, and still does, even after his death in 1991. \"I find it difficult morally to sing songs that weren't his,\" she says. She recently found a way round it - \"a ruse,\" - by re-recording songs he wrote for other artists, such as Catherine Deneuve.\n\n\"There was a very sweet version of something called 'La Gadoue', which means 'Mud'. That's why children of 12 now see me at train stations and say, 'Oh look, it's Mud!' \"\n\nShe feels she never did enough for Gainsbourg, whom she sees as comparable to Rimbaud or Apollinaire. \"He was a jealous man. I thought: Oohh! he's perching on the microphone going, 'Vrrr!' (she makes a bogeyman noise) - he won't be pleased. Yet he'll be pleased that you survived.\"\n\nShe tried to break away on her last record, written by other composers, but one song was still about him. \"One last cigarette, one last drink,\" she quotes. \"It's the last and then we'll stop.\" It is, she admits, \"very subtle, but you realise it's him. It could have been ghastly - people could have said, 'She's not worth anything without him'.\"\n\nYou wonder how it must have felt for subsequent partners to deal with a relationship so close and so public (Lou, Birkin's daughter with Jacques Doillon, called Gainsbourg \"Papa 2\"). \"Our wives or husbands were very intelligent to understand that I wouldn't have been able to conceive life without Serge being a friend.\"\n\nBirkin is the daughter of an actress - Noël Coward muse Judy Campbell - and she now has three daughters of her own. Lou Doillon, now 15, is starting a screen career, playing spiky-haired tearaways. Kate Barry, from Birkin's brief marriage at 18 to film composer John Barry, is the founder of a drug rehab centre. And Charlotte Gainsbourg - notoriously papa's co-star on the scabrous ditty Lemon Incest - has been an important screen presence since the 1985 film An Impudent Girl.\n\nAs a mother, Birkin feels she was never tough enough. \"Kate once said to me, the difficult thing was that at home, the walls were bendy, there were no limits.\" Birkin had a reputation for being a Chelsea-bred teenage rebel, but that was never the case, she says. \"I was very boring. I got married. I had a baby at 19, I went to France, fell in love with the main actor, Serge - very conventional. We stayed together for 13 years, then I walked out - that's conventional too.\"\n\nEven Gainsbourg - a notorious chat-show rent-a-monster - was, says Birkin, more conventional than people think. \"He jumped on people's shoes in hotels at night, but he was very much for children being polite. The first thing I did when I left was to buy a piano so that Charlotte could play, because his house was so regulated, it was like living in a museum. Later he was very proud. He said, 'Charlotte can play the piano.' I said, 'She can now she's allowed to put her wee fingers on it'.\"\n\nBirkin tells a story that illustrates her French public's curiously solicitous affection for her. \"A very nice young man followed me home the other day. I was with my very, very, very old bulldog, and she walked very, very, very slowly, and when we got to my front door, he said, 'What are you going to do now? It must be hard when you've been associated with somebody else's name so much to know quite what to do.' I said, 'Do you know, I've just recorded a record of 13 songs from 13 different people.' And he picked me up in his arms and went round a full circle and let me down and went backwards down the street saying, 'I'm so happy for you!'\n\n\"And I thought, 'Wow! People don't mind that you go on'.\"\n\nOh Sorry, Were You Asleep? is on Radio 4 on Friday September 24. The Last September is released later this year."
