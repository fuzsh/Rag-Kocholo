The difference between Biblical counseling and other counseling approaches is the Word of God, which has power to bring about a permanent change of heart, mind, and will. Biblical counseling teaches that relying on Christ is ultimately how we find and keep the strength to make change last.\n\nThe events department is responsible for organizing and coordinating events that bring the message of hope found in Jesus Christ. These events may include concerts, conferences, retreats, workshops, and more! Through these events our desire is to create impactful experiences that strengthen and encourage individuals in their faith journey."
