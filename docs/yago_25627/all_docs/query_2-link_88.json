        "text": "Based on a true story, Unsung Hero follows David Smallbone as he moves his family from Australia to the United States, in search of a brighter future after his successful music company collapses.\n\nWith nothing more than their seven children, suitcases, and their love of music, David (for KING + COUNTRY’s Joel Smallbone) and his pregnant wife Helen (Daisy Betts) set out to rebuild their lives.\n\nHelen’s faith stands against all odds and inspires her husband and children to hold onto theirs. With their own dreams on hold, David and Helen begin to realize the musical prowess in their children, who would go on to become two of the most successful acts in Inspirational Music history: five-time GRAMMY Award®-winning artists for KING + COUNTRY and Rebecca St. James.\n\nThe movie comes out in April of 2024. It is made by the studio that produced I Can Only Imagine and Jesus Revolution.\n\nWatch the Unsung Hero Trailer Below:"
