        "text": "The Royle Family is a Manchester set television series set almost entirely within a family’s sitting room and kitchen. The drama comes to them, if you were to reject it as narratively lacking, it has to be said the characters keep you company. Considering micro events in cinema one thinks of many old Hollywood films for example William Wyler’s The Heiress Carrie, The Children’s Hour and The Collector. Also films that are seen as typically French like those of Jacques Doillon which focus on love triangles, The Crying Woman ,Too Much (Little) Love, Amoureuse and Love Battles. Of course Tsai Ming-Liang took this idea of micro event even further with his films such as Vive L’amour, The River, The Hole, Goodbye Dragon Inn and I Don’t Want to Sleep Alone.\n\nIn the case of The Royle Family, shot on 16mm and made to look like a Shane Meadows film or Ray and Liz, Ricky Tomlinson’s Jim is initially made out to be a grostesque Mr. England, he’s overweight, hasn’t worked since Thatcher robbed him of his job in the 80s, he’s never been on a plane, it seems no one in the show has, except for Irish neighbour Mary (Dolores Kehoe) a direct loving reference to co-creator and actor Caroline Aherne’s mother. The show aired between 1998 and 2000, Aherne left the show in 2001, returning for five one-off Christmas Specials between 2006 and 2012. The visual look and detail of the first series is probably the most refined, camera placements in the kitchen doorway, close-ups for longer periods. Part of the show’s humour which is very much based on banal comments, even bad jokes, very English, very Manchunian. The main element of the comedy/drama is situations discussed through the watching of television, reaction shots are key. Often reaction shots are conventional filler for Hollywood films, here the reaction shot is a constant punch-line, there’s no joke as such it’s just about getting that sense of annoyance from a counterpart character.\n\nWilliam Wyler is often discussed as not having a signature visual style, Kent Jones being a contemporary champion of Wyler has argued for a re-evaluation and also dismissal of the opinions about a strictly check-listed group of auteurs (Hitchcock and Ford etc.) with distinct visuals as being the only ones worthy of such a high level of appreciation. The filmmaker James Grey has said ‘people who don’t think Wyler was a great filmmaker really don’t know what it means to make a movie.’ Looking at the films, The Heiress, The Children’s Hour and Carrie they concern issues of class, public outrage, alienation, lack of new beginnings. The stories include inheritance (The Heiress) a well-off man leaves his wife and moves in with a younger working class woman and suffers poverty (Carrie) anda child who claims her head teachers are lesbians (partly a lie) one teacher does unrequitedly love the other without her knowledge (The Children’s Hour). Andre Bazin is perhaps the best known champion of Wyler, in 1948 he wrote a long essay focusing particularly on The Little Foxes and The Best Years of Our Lives, he talks of the Wyler secret, to make cinematic something which is based on a play. He uses the example of deep focus in The Little Foxes focusing on Bette Davis’ face with Herbert Marshall dying on the stairs in the background.\n\nAnother Bette Davis film Beyond the Forest was Davis’ last for Warner Bros. dismissed by her and the director King Vidor at the time. If we are to look at Micro-plot, we find in Beyond the Forest an environment of empty dreams far more intriguing than Vidor’s later Ruby Gentry. It’s the environment of the former that gives it its strong point. Davis’ husband is doctor, like his patients short on money. Davis wants the high life in Chicago and falls in love with another man, a millionaire (David Brian). We know nothing of her husband’s (Joseph Cotten) life away from his work. Davis is contrasted with her maid (Dona Drake), little care for responsibility with a carefree attitude; although the maid does claim responsibility with Davis in ill health towards the end. As empty as the Wisconsin town that the film is set in is and the lack of interactions Davis has compared to Jennifer Jones in Ruby Gentry make the former a more layered film for the way it lays out more ambiguously character motives, though Ruby Gentry has its intrigues too. Visually the use of strong mid shots and close-ups of Davis along the empty street with the moving camera and interesting angles convey a sense of the ghost town, the ghost town of the dream factory of Hollywood. We know from Davis’ trip to Chicago that the film is telling us that cities are shit, heightened up the lack of perspective of the environment and Max Steiner’s music. As Raymond Durgnat argued in Film Comment in 1973 and again in 1988 for a book he co-authored with Scott Simmon, King Vidor, American; “It was not merely a low budget that dictated the sparse presentation of Chicago – where Rosa flees in mid film to her temporarily distracted millionaire – by the song of that title and as a series of constricted spaces (a rear auto seat, a hotel room, dark porches, very brief and confined exteriors). This cramped minimalism evokes quick, restricted meetings, suffocated feelings, Rosa’s narrow toehold in the cliff face of her dream world. The film’s free space is in the town she disdains.”\n\nWith a filmmaker like Tsai Ming-Liang the sense of space shown in Beyond the Forest’s beginning of the empty street is part of his aesthetic. East Asian Cinema from Ozu to Hou to Diaz is very comfortable with the idea of the frame being empty for long periods with actors walking in and out of it over several minutes. There is no Max Steiner score to emphasise the situations or feelings, just you and the film with Lee Keng-shang at the helm of visual experiences with little dialogue which question narrative norms. Sound emphasising upon flowing water, street noise, a feeling a place, such sounds are not presence in Beyond the Forest as Hollywood generally only used essential sounds like rain and gunshots until the 1960s. Both Beyond the Forest and I Don’t Want to Sleep Alone convey environment and atmosphere with stillness, the latter with a higher degree of contemplation.\n\nIf we look at two examples of micro worlds in cinema, take The Fountainhead shot at Warner Bros. studios, offices are used for two different characters in the opening sequence, then later a third office (clearly an inspiration for Paul Newman’s office in The Hudsucker Proxy) it is clear that each office is the same set, the background is a sort of unconscious of corporate greed, clearly fake. It is an afterthought of an outside world which goes on beyond the prisms of its characters, when we see a wide shot of Raymond Massey’s office near the end of the film is shown, the contained self assertion and self worth is deafening visually. Nearly all of the characters are in turn self made financially (Raymond Massey’s tycoon) artistically (Gary Cooper’s architect) psychologically (Patricia Neal’s columnist) intellectually (Robert Douglas’ critic) and in turn self destructive. Light is used to emphasise the darkness of corruption in The Fountainhead whereas in Beyond the Forest Joseph Cotten is overexposed by light and shadow when he delivers a baby, ever the passive character (Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, Duel in the Sun, The Third Man) Cotten is shown in body and soul as too considerate to be anyway ambitious which suits viewers well as an identification point. Perhaps the light throws Cotten in the shadows by default, as his characters in the films mentioned never get what they want.\n\nKing Vidor emphasises betrayal with rain and dirt on a newspaper in The Fountainhead. There is a sense that for the viewer that the sets can’t go unnoticed so it adds to strange feeling of theatre, the thoughts of socio-political issues are given by Robert Douglas’ critic in the film, typical Hollywood doing the work for you. The set up of oppositions in its characters is stark; Cooper as egoist, Neal as neurotic, Massey as powerful and Douglas as narcissist, happiness won’t last, it can’t. It’s simple story on the surface of Gary Cooper’s refusal to conform to the conventional expectations of architecture, think of it as an auteur fighting with the studios. It must be noted that Vidor’s films, Beyond the Forest, The Fountainhead and Ruby Gentry were all written by women screenwriters in the case of Ruby Gentry it was a co-written with a man. A question audiences might often wonder is about the psychology of gender on screen and its representation as most films are written by men, Beyond the Forest and Ruby Gentry were sourced from novels written by men. Leonore Coffee (Beyond the Forest) also wrote Vidor’s Lightning Strikes Twice with Ruth Roman and Sudden Fear with Joan Crawford. With Davis, Jones and Crawford in the women’s picture as they were known, the actors were as definitive in a character study as anything with Isabelle Huppert. A physical presence and mastery of psychosis on screen in the micro events like putting on lipstick (Beyond the Forest) or putting glass in a young woman’s coat pocket (The Piano Teacher), these moments stay fixed in the viewer’s mind.\n\nThe second example is Marnie, famously praised by Robin Wood as the best Hitchcock film. Hitchcock is making more of a world within a world approach than Vidor; the large ship, the storm, with camera moves around the office, not to mention the fade colour schemes. Such an artistic statement like Cooper’s architecture in The Fountainhead demands to be taken on its own terms regardless of expectations like Marnie. The idea of the setting as fake is a world away from Tsai Ming-Liang’s usual settings nevertheless each artist asks of the viewer to take on varying degrees of solitude. Vidor’s actors have gaunt, haunted faces (Davis, Cooper, Massey), quite the opposite in fitting with the tone of Tsai’s films his lead actor Lee has a face of sorrow and loneliness of life passing by beyond his fingertips perhaps at times Cotten can express this too. Hitchcock and Vidor want contemplation to be like a vortex of emotion through music and camera placements, whereas Tsai feels that the moment micro or not speaks for itself.\n\n___________________________\n\n© Peter Larkin\n\nBorn in Paris in 1944, Jacques Doillon was part of a movement, the Second New Wave in France along with Philippe Garrel, Maurice Pialat, Jean Eustache and Andrè Tèchinè. Doillon like Garrel has often uses minimal narrative situations based on domestic issues (relationships, drug or alcohol abuse), starring sometimes himself and members of his family. The distribution of Doillon’s films don’t often travel to many countries apart from France. Not surprisingly his films are underseen and little written about. With his double header in 1979 The Hussy and The Crying Woman there are tight bound settings; houses in provincial France (the bare essentials) with few characters, most of them eccentric loners battling arrogant counterparts (The Crying Woman). In the case of The Hussy we see Doillon’s fascination with child characters, children are given as much freedom as possible as actors. Other examples include A Bag of Marbles, La vie de famille, The 15 Year Old Girl, Le petit criminel, Le jeune Werther, Ponette, Petits Freres and Un Enfant de toi.\n\nWithin the mix of Doillon’s characters is a desire for these fantasy three-way relationships; (The Crying Woman and The Three-Way Wedding), at times theatrical in terms of acting and storytelling whereby Doillon finds the essence of the said films as a whole, through intimate investigations of the characters played by actors Doillon knows well. We trust in him to bring us that sense of cinema; faces through a reflecting window in The Crying Woman, the intimate camera placements in Le petit criminel. His young actors perhaps see him as an uncle type (or natural father in the cases of Lola and Lou Doillon) who nurtures their talent, they trust him and feel safe in this environment. Doillon trusts them to carry to the weight of a said film through with a command, body language and anxiety ridden gesture.\n\nPonette is Doillon’s most internationally acclaimed film. It concerns a four year old who lost her mother and believes she has resurrected. Michael Dwyer for The Irish Times gave no insight into the film, choosing to be more interested with the child psychologist Doillon had on the set for guidance. Dwyer’s lack of insight is a shame as this was a rare opportunity for the Irish public to hear of Jacques Doillon and his films. Giving the film a service seems to be beyond Dwyer as he wrestles with his own moral judgement over whether the film should actually have been made. The serious-minded but achingly slow-moving’ film Dwyer experienced makes sense if you’ve seen Doillon’s films; its pacing, its hazy autumn look, the lack of close-ups, Doillon’s ‘kids as kids’ approach which Kent Jones describes so well. The world as kids see it is Doillon’s major achievement. 4-year-old Victoire Thivisol’s remarkable performance won her the Volpi Cup (Best Actress) at the 1996 Venice Film Festival, that’s how astonishing she was and how it was received at the time. Joanna Di Matti (Senses of Cinema argues ‘In Ponette, the camera is tethered so intimately to the four-year-old girl that when adults enter the frame, they tend to upset the delicate emotional ecosystem Doillon has established.’ The world through Ponette’s eyes, her friends and family with their contradictory information, it’s a view of the world as it is with the sense of divine wonder at the film’s conclusion.\n\nPetits frèrès is set in the Paris projects like La haine, it concerns the simple story of a girl who wants to find her dog who has been taken by a gang of kids. The summer light, the poverty and boredom of these kids with little prospects on the outskirts of society, the boys try to impress girls with holding a gun sideways like Pacino. Tony McKibbin (2012) argues ‘Children, or more specifically often teenagers in Doillon, are observed in their specifics, in their concerns, rather than ours, ours as paying viewers demanding certain narrative actions’. Emotional strain and rupture much like Le petit criminel which concerns a young teenager who practically apologises for having to rob a pharmacy and whose situation gets more intense, it all revolves around simple things; getting to meet his sister for the first time in another town (Montpeller) and getting his name changed to his father’s. His motives are sound, but his means test the authorities and himself, much like a young Dardenne character. The idle camera watching the dramatic events; as dramatic turns to melodramatic the jazz score is relevantly silent, our three characters pushed to their limits, a close-up is always one of sorrowful desperation. Richard Anconina’s detective’s practical manner, caring nature, sunlight through his car aligning shadow on his face. The day to day pressures of being a cop particularity in Doillon’s world of the immediate irrational scenario. Gèrald Thomassin’s Marc our protagonist trapped behind glass in the car calling the shots for the first half of the film. In the second half Nathanael Hood (Mubi) notes ‘Marc always seems to be in the periphery of shots, a hazy blur in the background or a white dot on the edge of the frame.’ After they have left the car in the last third, Doillon’s focuses on Thomassin’s in close-ups as Marc tries to refine and give himself a new self-definition. Clotilde Coureau’s Nathalie is real outsider of the story disconnected from the environment of Sète where the film begins. Her actions are also the melodramatic turning point, she is most emotional as she tries to connect with her brother for the first time. All of the characters are very caring amidst such threat of violence. The final shot, a dissolving reflection through what looks like a window is white, a fading glimpse of hope.\n\nDoillon’s films often show humanity in small moments; a girl crying over having a robbed a young couple, kids staging a mock wedding (Petits frèrès). Sami Frey’s character in La vie de famille is quite overbearing, he is a womanizer who spends the weekend with his daughter who criticises him whilst trying to understand him. The scenes of them in the car with the rural landscape is given care and precision, Frey’s character depends on himself, his family on him, quite a lot to ask of a man who would probably struggle to look in a mirror. He lasts a mere few seconds when put face to face with his video camera (he is a filmmaker).\n\nLe jeune Werther, Doillon’s best film concerns a group of teenage friends dealing with a friend’s suicide. Paris has seldom looked so deserted as the teenagers walk through it pondering their lost friend. The intimate camera placements; the kids in mid-shot, ‘teachers don’t know anything’ one of them says. The kids philosophising recalls Eric Rohmer. Dan Sallitt (Mubi) argues ‘Rohmer may seem similar at first glance, but I think he’s really completely different. All that dialogue in Doillon’s film is crucial: it bears all the film’s feeling. With Rohmer, the effect is more indirect. What the characters say in a Rohmer film isn’t really the film: the film doesn’t emerge until the idea-world that the characters construct is juxtaposed with the too too solid reality of Rohmer’s spaces, of the soundtrack, of the documentary he’s always making about the world around his people.’ The alienation of life for these youngsters, who unlike those in Petits frères have potential based on their middle-class background, though pressures of life catch up with you wherever you are in the world. The question of potential of course is more a question of class in certain aspects like society’s view, assumptions are made to be broken. Within the analysisng of the cause of their friend Guillaume’s death comes obsession with a girl who Guillaume liked. She is followed, who sent you she asks ‘a ghost’ is the reply. It becomes an investigation out of Jean-Pierre Melville in precision or even Tsai ming-liang is the quiet scenes of the stalking. There’s a POV of the girl’s neck, an unusually intimate moment. Are you part of a gang she asks. As if she assumes Guillaume’s death must be related to a youth violent lifestyle. Di Mattia (Senses of Cinema) notes ‘Young Werther’s action is reduced primarily to what is happening between Ismael and his friends, rendered with such vivid intensity that it becomes, convincingly, an entire microcosm of life itself.’\n\nIn Le jeune Werther Doillon uses no background chatter as the streets are fairly empty, the birds sing, the world is open and wide like the beautiful old Parisian school these kids go to, it’s a safe place. Doillon like in all his movies gives time; the funeral, city and playground discussions and mournful thoughts by a graveside. A house party brings about a realisation in the protagonist Ismaël (Ismaël Jolè-Mènèbhi), a realisation to move on but never forget how awful but also how eye-opening it was to be a teenager. Doillon as Sallitt (Mubi) argues is in all of his characters, they exist to question the nature of how we live and think and feel amidst often erratic and sombre circumstances.\n\n___________________________\n\n© Peter Larkin"
