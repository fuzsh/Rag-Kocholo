        "text": "La Vie de Famille. Stunning. The early scenes set us up for a destructive, huis clos story of family enmity, but this section shares only a few things with what follows: a sunlit, edge-of-the-world holiday ambience, and the Sami Frey character’s difficult qualities. The young girl transforms the movie, of course: it turns into Pierrot le Fou, a story of the last romantic lovers, transposed to a father-daughter key - and of course Doillon does not hesitate to bring out the parallels to romantic love. The use of the video camera as a device that lets the characters speak their emotions with increasing directness, until fulfillment/exhaustion/sorrow is attained, is remarkable. The girl is a fantasy of complexity and articulateness, but…\n\nDoillon at this most emotionally naked and pure, echoes of Pialat’s bruised nervous energy shot through with so many lyrical, digressive grace notes; the family unit envisioned as an unwieldy assemblage of competing wills and misperceptions and open wounds, but hopefully, subtending it all, something enough remaining beneath all the gaps.

I'm going to be as honest as I can be when I say that I have no clue how Doillon does that. The chemistry between Sami Frey and young Mara Goyet is the kind of purely cinematic chemistry that we have seen with the greatest, the likes of Bogie and Bacall and Doillon indeed structures their relationship on the Hawksian approach of badinage with unsaid emotions behind every word. That is why the finale is so heartbreaking; it sums up the whole film tragically but at the same time bursts out the feelings that have…"
