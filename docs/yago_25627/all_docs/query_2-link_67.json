        "text": "By: Cori Cross, MD, FAAP\n\nHave you ever found yourself thinking, \"Did they really just say that in a PG-rated movie?\" If so, you probably won't be surprised to hear that movie, TV, and video game ratings today aren't the same as when we were kids.\n\nStudies show that government and industry movie ratings have become more lenient over time. More violent and sexually explicit content are allowed into films than there used to be. What these ratings mean and whether they can tell you what's appropriate for your child isn't always clear. Even movies with the same rating released in the same year can differ widely in the amount and type of potentially offensive content.\n\nHow to make healthy media choices for your family\n\nWe know that children are influenced by what they see and hear, especially at very young ages. Rating systems can be one tool your family uses to choose media that has positive influences—and avoid content with negative influences. Some tips:\n\nLearn the media ratings lingo\n\nRaters often use quotas for scenes that have violence, sex and swearing. Once these quotas are reached, the movie is pushed into a higher rating bracket. Although this may make sense for filmmakers, it can be difficult for parents to navigate. For instance, you may not want your child exposed to certain content, such as vulgar language. For you, even one \"f-word\" may be too many.\n\nLook for ratings and warning labels on media such as movies, TV shows, music, videos and video games. Look at the content information if it's available too. It's usually located in the same area as the rating. This will indicate details about why the raters gave the rating they did. It will also help you find age-appropriate content for your child.\n\nCompanies such as streaming services don't currently have to use parental guidance ratings at all. This means that the majority of online streaming videos are unrated. Use caution with online videos and products that don't have a rating. Be sure to find out more about them before you let your child play with, listen to or watch them.\n\nCo-view media when possible\n\nKeep in mind that while ratings can be helpful, they are only a guide. Nothing is better than you listening to and watching media with your kids. That's why the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommends co-viewing media with your children as often as you can. This gives you a chance to talk about what you're hearing or seeing.\n\nWhatever media your child is using should be age appropriate. If possible, it should also reinforce your family's values. If you can, it's good to pre-screen what your child watches. That said, with the sheer amount of media kids are exposed to, it's unrealistic that you'll be able to pre-screen or co-view everything.\n\nUse family-friendly media resources\n\nWhen co-viewing or listening isn't an option, you can refer to reputable, independent resources such as Common Sense Media (CSM). These resources rate movies, television shows, video games, music, apps, websites and books.\n\nThe CSM website and app give in-depth reviews. This allows parents a better sense of what to expect. There are even suggestions for discussions parents may want to have with their children. The ratings have a 5-dot system and detailed summaries about what parents may want to know in these categories:\n\nSex\n\nLanguage\n\nConsumerism\n\nDrinking, drugs and smoking\n\nViolence\n\nPositive role models\n\nDiverse representations\n\nPositive messages\n\nThe CSM website and app offer age recommendations with each review. DISH Network and DIRECTV have partnered with CSM and include these age recommendations on their guide listings too.\n\nFederal TV rating guidelines\n\nThe TV Parental Guidelines (see chart below) are usually included within local TV listings. Ratings aren't used for news programs. The AAP recommends keeping young children away from repetitive graphic images and sounds that may appear on news programs—especially after a major tragedy.\n\nIf you want older children to watch the news, record it ahead of time. That way, you can preview it before you sit down with them to watch it. Then, as you watch it together, you can pause and have a discussion when you need to.\n\nAll TVs 13 inches or larger made in the United States after 2000 are required by federal law to have a V-chip. This chip allows parents to block specific shows or groups of programs based on ratings, specific shows, or time slots. Visit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website for more information.\n\nIndustry movie rating guidelines\n\nThe Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has a voluntary rating system for the movie industry. These ratings give general guidelines to parents about the level of content they might find inappropriate for their children.\n\nThe MPAA's Classification & Ratings Administration (CARA) has a board of independent raters who are required to be parents themselves. They view each film for potentially offensive content, such as violence, sex, drug use and language. Then they assign ratings based on what they believe most American parents would consider the film's appropriate rating.\n\nVideo game and app rating guidelines\n\nThe Electronic Software Ratings Board (ESRB) gives ratings to video games and apps. These are like movie ratings—they serve as a guide to help you make informed choices. Nearly all video games sold in the United States and Canada have ratings.\n\nRemember\n\nOfficial government or industry ratings offer you some general guidance on which shows, movies, and other media may be appropriate for your child's age. But for most families, they don't replace sitting down with your children and watching what they're watching—or, when that's not possible, getting a heads-up from reputable, parent-friendly resources about what they'll see.\n\nMore information\n\nVirtual Violence: How Does It Affect Children?\n\nHow to Make a Family Media Use Plan\n\nVideo Games: Establish Your Family's Own Rating System\n\nWatch Together: Co-Viewing Media With Your Child\n\nRatings and Reviews for Families: Movies, TV, Books, Games, Podcasts & Apps (Common Sense Media)\n\nAbout Dr. Cross"
