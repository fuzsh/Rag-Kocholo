Too often, our relationships fall short of what we desire them to be. We don’t show up like we want to. We find it hard to come through in hard times. We are missing some magic that we once had, or once dreamed of. It’s easy to be in to-do or too distracted mode to actually engage in the relationships we most treasure. Not to mention how all of these people can let us down at times as well. But this isn’t what we were made for. Instead, we believe God made us to live in perfect community with Him and each other. We believe He has designed families to be rich in love, full of joy, and generous to those around us. We believe He has the resources and tools for us to bridge the gap - to make our intentions match the reality of our relationships. To that end, we create content and experiences to help people grow more fulfilling connections with those they love most. FamilyLife is proud to be a part of the Cru family of ministries.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.familylife.com\n\nExternal link for FamilyLife\n\nIndustry\n\nNon-profit Organization Management\n\nCompany size\n\n201-500 employees\n\nHeadquarters\n\nOrlando, Florida\n\nType\n\nNonprofit\n\nFounded\n\n1976\n\nSpecialties\n\nMarriage getaways / events, Books / articles, Radio broadcasts, Church support resources, discipleship, evangelism, family guides, family, marriage, and relationships"
