        "text": "Mark Wahlberg plays a quiet suburban dad who takes his family on a road trip to Las Vegas to protect them after his cover as a former elite government assassin is blown in the trailer for The Family Plan, which dropped on Monday ahead of a Apple TV+ bow for the action comedy on Dec. 15.\n\nWahlberg stars as Dan Morgan, a father who happily changes diapers and sells cars, until he is tracked down by former enemies and has to pack his wife, played by Michelle Monaghan, teen son and daughter and 10-month-old baby into their minivan for a surprise cross-country trip.\n\n“Nothing brings a family together like a road trip,” Dan tells his unsuspecting wife. But once on the road, he finally tells his family their lives are in danger.\n\n“You’re like James Bond in a minivan?” his upset wife questions at one point. “I love that minivan,” a defensive Dan answers. But he’s also ruthless, as his long-dormant assassin skills return so he knock off pursuing enemies.\n\n“I need to be that guy one last time – for us,” Dan insists. The Apple original film from Skydance Media also stars Zoe Colletti, Van Crosby, Saïd Taghmaoui, Maggie Q and Ciarán Hinds.\n\nThe Family Plan is directed by Simon Cellan Jones and is written by David Coggeshall. David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Don Granger produced for Skydance, alongside Wahlberg and Stephen Levinson through Municipal Pictures. John G. Scotti executive produced.\n\nThe Family Plan is also going straight to Apple’s streaming platform, with no theatrical release planned."
