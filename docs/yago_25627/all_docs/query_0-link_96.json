        "text": "Roger Ebert 1942-2013\n\nPosted by in R.I.P.\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nRoger Ebert, Sneak Previews\n\nI am so sad about this. I started watching “Sneak Previews,” in the late 70’s on my PBS station in Anchorage, AK. There is shit to do up there folks, especially if you were an arty introverted type like myself. And this was the late 70’s/Early 80’s! Meaning no cable TV, no computers, no VCR’s. Nothing but books, board games and movies if you wanted to stay inside. That show and Elsa Klensch’s CNN fashion show saved my friggin’ life. A taste of art and culture that sustained my appetite till I could make my escape.\n\nNot only could I take a peek at all the new movies (the arty ones did not make it up to Anchorage), I got to listen to a heated debate pro or con on the film’s merits or missteps. It lit a fire in me to seek out different films, foreign films, independent films. It opened me up to the dimensions of film, what characters really were, the importance of directors, the craft of great writing. This set the stage for me deciding to go to film school and abandoning a more financially stable path, much to the chagrin of my immigrant Korean parents. So yeah, my parents can blame Roger Ebert for me not being a lawyer.\n\nI followed Siskel and Ebert to their syndicated show, “At the Movies,” hanging on their every word, and starting to agree or vehemently disagree with them. I was more of an Ebert gal. Gene Siskel didn’t have the credentials I required if one is to be so full of himself. You could tell Ebert was a great writer. He was awarded a 1975 Pulitzer for criticism. You also could tell he was smarter than Gene, and that’s why Gene was such a dick. Most film criticism involved summarizing the plot, but Ebert made reviewing a movie like reviewing a book or a play or any other piece of serious art. He elevated being a film fan from something passive to something active.\n\nHe succumbed to cancer, but fought valiantly, and served as an inspiration to all of us.\n\nLACMA Stanley Kubrick show\n\nPosted by in stuff to see\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nLos Angeles County Museum of Art, Stanley Kubrick\n\nKubrick. Even the name sounds geometrical, weighty. Who isn’t in awe of the creative monolith of Mr. Stanley Kubrick?\n\nI went to the show with the little guy, so forgive the out of focus pix. I debated whether I should even put them up. Or whether I should go back alone to take better pictures… I was fooling myself. Who’s got the time, really?\n\nBut hey, an out-of-focus pic is better than nothing. I was literally pulled in every direction and only had my iphone (3GS, sigh) because dealing with the mommy bag, and real camera and a 3 year old was not happening.\n\nIt was such a well-rounded show. From his noir roots, to “Full Metal Jacket,” annotated scripts and set models, this is a show for all film fans, not just Kubrick devotees.\n\nBut wait! There’s more…\n\nhttp://www.lacma.org/kubrick-app\n\nHollywood Camera App\n\nPosted by in Contemporary/Present Day\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nHollywood Camera App, Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nJust in time for the Oscars… The Hollywood Camera App, features costumes from the Victoria and Albert Museum’s Hollywood Costume Exhibition. Sixteen looks from Maximus to Chaplin’s tramp is yours for the wearing.\n\nPlaying dress up without dressing up. Available on iTunes. Happy Oscar viewing! Personally, I’m pulling for “Life of Pi.” I feel it’s the most ambitious of all the nominees in regards to story, technical challenges, originality, and a most unlikely worldwide box office success.\n\nGolden Globes 2013\n\nPosted by in Uncategorized\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nHey folks. Haven’t posted in a while, and I’m truly sorry for that. I miss me blog somethin’ awful. Had some family stuff I had to take care of, but had to write about this supremely awesome weekend.\n\nFirst off, if you haven’t noticed, I’m a huge sports fan. Can’t watch as much (OK, none at all now) sports as before after having a baby, but I did watch some football this weekend, and IT DID NOT DISAPPOINT. Hooo, weee, that was some good football! Heartbreaking for Peyton, but Ray Lewis and his Ravens will live to play another day. How they did it? Craziness and sheer force of will for Lewis, probably. And San Francisco? Kaepernick was on FUEGO. Stud. I lived up in SF for a few years and left in 2009, and they had been SUCKING for over a decade. Happy for them.\n\nSecondly, was that the BEST Golden Globes/awards telecast ever? Tina Fey and Amy Poehler threw down. They dare you to be funnier than them. Ex-presidents! See-through dresses! Jodie Foster coming out of a very transparent closet! So good.\n\nWill post soon, promise.\n\nDiana Vreeland: “The Eye Has to Travel”\n\nPosted by in stuff to see\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nDiana Vreeland, Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel, fashion documentary, Vogue\n\nBefore there was Anna Wintour, there was D.V. Diana Vreeland ruled Vogue with an iron fist, albeit one clad in jewels and velvet. I think she’s the one who said, “More is more.” She directed Vogue that way, steering through the tumultuous 60’s and 70’s, in an explosion of art, color, revealing skin, newly realized feminine power, and diversity. Capturing the popular, cultural zeitgeist like no other since. Editors these days don’t have the vision or the balls to do what she did. She pushed for not just ethnic diversity, preferring personality over perfection. Lauren Hutton and her gap-tooth smile as one example.\n\nAnd to think, she didn’t start her magazine career till she was in her 30’s and didn’t land the Vogue gig till she was in her 60’s. Let all us late-boomers take heart.\n\nI Love Your Style\n\nPosted by in Books\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTags\n\nAmanda Brooks, I love your style, style icons\n\nA great go-to book by Amanda Brooks to help you solidify your look, or get you to try a new one. It’s full of IT girls, cool girls, chic girls, all of them AB FAB and inspirational.\n\nIt’s also a great pictorial reference book for you young-uns just learning the style icon vernacular.\n\nShe also has a blog: http://iloveyourstyle.com/\n\nCloset App\n\nPosted by in stuff to do\n\n≈ 2 Comments\n\nTags\n\ncloset app\n\nFor the supremely organized (not me)… The Closet App lets you take pictures of everything in your closet. You can then mix it up planning outfits for every day of that week or month. So when you’re in that morning fog, staring into your closet, you won’t have to waste precious morning time trying to cobble together a look. It’s also handy for planning a trip, or filling holes in your arsenal of chic.\n\nhttp://closetapp.com/#\n\nL’Avventura\n\nPosted by in 1950's, Men, Women\n\n≈ 2 Comments\n\nTags\n\nGabriele Ferzetti, L'Avventura, Lea Massari, Michelangelo Antonioni, Monica Vitti, post war Italy\n\nMichelangelo Antonioni’s, “L’Avventura,” was booed at it’s first screening at Cannes, in 1959. Such is the reaction to all things new and groundbreaking. The second screening fared much better, it was hailed as a genius work of art.\n\nAnna, her boyfriend, Sandro, and best friend Claudia, go for a lovely boat ride one summer. Anna goes missing, and the boating party tries in vain to find her. Sandro and Claudia bond over the incident and start romantically seeing each other. Anna is never found, which begs the question, what happened to her? Which Antonioni never answers. It’s an art film. No tidy endings, people. It’s more like a meditation on love, life, and the transitory nature of it.\n\nAnna fears losing Sandro, but simultaneously feels numb in her surroundings. This might reflect an Italian post-war sensibility. Intense feelings towards comforting emotions like love, but a numb psyche as a result of the recent WWII horrors, and unable to fully enjoy emotions like love.\n\nAnna, Sandro, and Claudia embark on a short cruise.\n\nAnna goes missing. Claudia, Sandro, and their friend Corrado stay on the island to continue searching for her. Claudia and Sandro develop an attraction to each other.\n\nEmpty, desolate landscapes in natural and urban settings underscore the rudderless and lonely feelings of modern life.\n\nBack with a vengeance\n\nPosted by in Uncategorized\n\n≈ Leave a comment\n\nTook more time off from the blog for the summer than planned but I’m back in movie viewing/screen-capturing/clothes-envying mode. How was your summer? Is it just me, or are you dying for a cold blustery day so you can snuggle up in a wool fisherman’s sweater and nurse a pot au chocolat? The summer was way too hot and humid for me. I tend to wilt and complain when it’s above 75 with the slightest bit of moisture.\n\nSpeaking of vengeance and movies… It’s the day after September 11th, always a somber one, and then we hear of the shocking murders in Libya. Some wack job makes a horrible “film” that is clearly made to be incendiary and offensive to Muslims, and SURPRISE, it’s inflamed the Arab world and four Americans have been killed in retaliation. The blame squarely lands of the people who committed these acts, but the filmmaker has shown a callous disregard to the possible and obvious outcome of making that film. I don’t begrudge him his first amendment rights, but come on, let’s use some common sense. The same reason you don’t yell FIRE! in a crowded theater.\n\nBut now, you can yell GUN! I didn’t have time to post about the Aurora, Colorado shootings, and then the Olympics swept into town and all media coverage followed, so the shootings receded into the background for me. I took the little guy to see, “Brave,” and had fun watching the trailers with him. Then a card came up to instruct people to be aware of the exits in case of an emergency. I held my little one a little tighter, reminded of the fact that all those people were in that theater doing the exact same thing as me. We go to the movies to take refuge from life. If it’s too hot, or cold, or rainy, or if you need a good laugh, or you want a good cry, it’s a place we all go. Up until that point it was a safe haven.\n\nI don’t have a clever quote to wrap things up. I tried but they all sounded trite. My heart goes out to the families of the victims in both Benghazi and Aurora."
