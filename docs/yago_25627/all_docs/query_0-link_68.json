        "text": "Chocolat is a 2000 British-American romantic-drama film. It is based on the novel Chocolat by Joanne Harris, and was directed by Lasse Hallström. Adapted by screenwriter Robert Nelson Jacobs, Chocolat tells the story of Vianne Rocher, played by Juliette Binoche, who arrives in the French village at the beginning of Lent with her six-year-old daughter, Anouk. She opens a small chocolaterie. Soon, she and her chocolate influence the lives of the townspeople of this fictional, repressed French village in very different and interesting ways.\n\nFilming took place between May and August 2000 in the medieval village of Flavigny-sur-Ozerain in the region of Burgundy and on the Rue De L'ancienne Poste in Beynac-et-Cazenac in Dordogne. The river scenes were filmed at Fonthill Lake at Fonthill Bishop in Wiltshire, England and interior scenes at Shepperton Studios.\n\nJuliette Binoche (born 9 March 1964) is a French actress, artist, and dancer. She has appeared in more than 60 feature films, been the recipient of numerous international awards, and performed frequently on stage internationally. She began taking acting lessons during adolescence and was cast in the films of such notable auteur directors as Jean-Luc Godard (Hail Mary, 1985), Jacques Doillon (Family Life, 1985), and André Téchiné. Her performance in her English-language debut The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988), directed by Philip Kaufman, launched her international career."
