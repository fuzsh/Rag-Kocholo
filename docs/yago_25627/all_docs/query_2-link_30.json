        "text": "Founded:\n\n1976 by Dennis and Barbara Rainey\n\nHeadquarters:\n\nOrlando, FL\n\nPurpose:\n\nTo provide practical, biblical help for life's most important family relationships\n\nScope:\n\nFamilyLife is active in 109 countries, recognizing that \"family is an international language.\" More than 2,000 volunteers give leadership to and use FamilyLife's platform of ministries. FamilyLife's resources and books have been translated into 49 languages and dialects.\n\nEvents And Resources:\n\nThrough The Art of Marriage® curriculum, Weekend to Remember® marriage getaways, Love Like You Mean It® marriage cruises, and other events and resources, FamilyLife helps transform lives and restore hope.\n\nThis year alone, FamilyLife expects to influence more than 60,000 people through Weekend to Remember events in more than 80 cities across the U.S. At the heart of FamilyLife is a volunteer network committed to impacting marriages and families in their communities.\n\nIn 2018, FamilyLife launched a major parenting training initiative called FamilyLife's Art of Parenting™. The online course and small-group, video-assisted resource helps parents make faith the core of their parenting. These resources were launched along with a full-length feature film produced by FamilyLife called Like Arrows—the compelling story of a young couple as they raise their children through the various seasons of life.\n\nFamilyLife Today®\n\nCo-hosted by Dave Wilson, Ann Wilson and Bob Lepine, FamilyLife Today can be heard in all 50 states through more than 1,200 radio outlets, reaching an estimated audience of 1.6 million weekly listeners. The daily interview-style program addresses current, relevant issues facing American families, and delivers biblical and practical counsel. FamilyLife Today is a three-time recipient of the National Religious Broadcasters (NRB) Media Award for Radio Program of the Year (1995, 2003 and 2017).\n\nFamilyLife Blended®\n\nFamilyLife has aggressively addressed the needs of stepfamilies through events, books, resources, small-group studies and the daily radio feature FamilyLife Blended®. The goal of FamilyLife Blended is to provide biblically-based resources that strengthen stepfamilies, prevent re-divorce and break the generational cycle of divorce."
