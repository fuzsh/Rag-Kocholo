Police sealed off part of an American university after noticing a sticker on a bicycle declaring "This bike is a pipe bomb" - only to be told the message was the name of a punk rock band.

A bomb squad was dispatched to Ohio University, Athens, from Columbus 65 miles away and the offending item was ripped apart with a hydraulic device while nearby streets were cordoned off. It then emerged that the sticker was a badge of support for a band from Pensacola.

The university dean, Terry Hogan, asked fans of the band to be more discreet about declaring their affiliation.
