        "text": "The TSX140 has received a complete overhaul for Version 5. Gone are the days of facing struggles of dealing with issues which are common on many other mini bikes. We have gone back to the drawing board and scratch built a New Frame, Airbox, Linkage Suspension, Hubs and Rims, and much more. This has not only allowed our bikes to become much more strong and reliable, but also gives the rider peace of mind knowing that, no detail has been left untouched.\n\nOur design team has produced a piece of engineering art, the frames are a new Quad Bar which has made them stronger than ever. Along with the frame developments we made space and rigged them with mounts to accommodate our new caged airboxes, this allows a better air filtration system while increasing airflow into the carburetor and in turn more horsepower. A first on pit bikes and minibikes alike, we have scaled down the linkage from the likes of a full size race bike, and fitted it to these smaller sized 140s. The linkage provides a much smoother ride than traditional PDS style suspension which allows for faster cornering, high and low speed adjustments, and increased rider comfort. We have redesigned our hubs and created space for a much heavier duty 20mm rear axle, coupled with stainless spokes and alloy rims, which provide our strongest wheels to date. Check out our description video and the following spec lists to see these upgrades!"
