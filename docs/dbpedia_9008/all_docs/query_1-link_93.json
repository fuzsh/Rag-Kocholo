        "text": "After a Bangladeshi immigrant detonated a homemade pipe bomb last December in a crowded subway corridor near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, he admitted his role in the attack, the government said, telling investigators, “I did it for the Islamic State.”\n\nBut on Tuesday, as testimony in the trial of the man, Akayed Ullah, began in Manhattan, his lawyer presented a different theory: She told the jury that her client had tried to blow himself up in a misguided suicide attempt. It had nothing to do with the Islamic State, she said, and he intended harm to no one but himself.\n\n“What this case is about is a young man — a deeply troubled, isolated young man — who wanted to take his own life,” the defense lawyer, Julia L. Gatto, said in her opening statement.\n\nIn contrast, a federal prosecutor, Rebekah Donaleski, said the evidence would show that Mr. Ullah not only embraced a radical and violent ideology and studied how terrorist groups like ISIS attack Americans, but he also researched how to build a bomb and use screws as shrapnel to maim and kill civilians.\n\n“The defendant chose Monday morning rush hour for one reason,” Ms. Donaleski said. “To terrorize as many people as possible.”\n\nMr. Ullah, 28, of Brooklyn, was the person most seriously injured in the Dec. 11 episode after the makeshift weapon strapped to his body malfunctioned. But the blast filled parts of the terminal with smoke, sent thousands of frightened commuters fleeing and disrupted rush hour as the police converged on Times Square and nearby streets.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
