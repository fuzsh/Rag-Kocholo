        "text": "The “Kingpin” of bike thieves in Portland, Oregon has been arrested thanks to an INSIDE EDITION investigation that tracked a stolen bike through the city.\n\nINSIDE EDITION traveled to Portland, where residents are having a major problem with bike thieves.\n\nScott Baker, from Bike Gallery, a popular bike shop in the city, said: “I personally think bike theft is an epidemic. Every day I see someone come through the door with something that’s been stolen.”\n\nRead: Watch Serena Williams Chase Down Guy She Says Swiped Her Phone\n\nThe Bike Gallery even displays police photos so that employees can recognize any suspected bike thieves who walk through the door.\n\nThe store loaned INSIDE EDITION a mountain bike worth $2,000, and security expert Jason Cecchettini from BaitBike.com then planted a radio tracking device in the bike.\n\nWe then locked up the bike in downtown Portland and waited.\n\nAfter a couple of hours, one man approached the bike with a bolt cutter but was unable to get through the lock, so wandered off.\n\nBut not too long later, another guy casually approached the bike and quickly cut off the lock before pedaling away. Little did he know, the radio tracking device was monitoring his every move.\n\nINSIDE EDITION followed him through the streets of downtown Portland and alerted the police. As we took chase, the tracking device signaled that he was beneath Interstate Highway 5. There, INSIDE EDITION found bicycle parts strewn about what looked like a chop shop.\n\nPolice also arrived on the scene.\n\n“So here's our bike,” INSIDE EDITION’s Lisa Guerrero said. “As you can see, they've already started to take it apart, just minutes after they stole it.”\n\nThe man also took our bike was gone, but we found the bike in pieces.\n\nShe went up another man, who said he had not taken it. When cops approached him, they allegedly found smart phones, new electronics and tools on him.\n\nRead: Double Trouble!

He has 70 mugshots from a variety of charges including bike theft, robbery and drugs.\n\nThe police bike task force has been trying to put him behind bars for a while. An officer told IE the arrest was a “big win” for the community.\n\nAuthorities have charged Parsons with theft in the first degree by receiving, which is a felony. He's pleaded not guilty."
