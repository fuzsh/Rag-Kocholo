        "text": "The pipe-bomb explosion Monday in the New York subway beneath Times Square, which injured three people besides the bomber, was just the latest reminder that the city has been a target of terrorist attacks for decades.\n\nWhether drawn to the iconic landmarks or densely packed citizens, plots have ranged from international conspiracies to deranged lone wolves. Weapons included airliners converted into missiles, homemade bombs, guns, a hatchet and even a sword.\n\n“The truth is, New York is an international symbol of freedom and democracy – that’s what we are – and we are proud of it,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said after a truck attack on Halloween that killed eight and injured 12. “That also makes us a target for those people who oppose those concepts, and we’ve lived with this before, we’ve felt the pain before, we feel the pain today, but we go forward together and we go forward stronger than ever.”\n\nHere is a list of New York terror attacks during the last 25 years:\n\nDEC. 11, 2017 PIPE BOMB EXPLODES IN SUBWAY AT TIMES SQUARE\n\nAkayed Ullah, 27, of Brooklyn, was allegedly inspired by the Islamic State to carry a crudely made pipe bomb into a walkway in the subway along 42nd Street between Seventh and Eighth avenues, where it detonated about 7:20 a.m., police said. Three people suffered minor injuries in the incident, and the bomber was injured and arrested.\n\nOCT. 31, 2017 TRUCK ATTACK NEAR WORLD TRADE CENTER IN MANHATTAN\n\nSayfullo Saipov, 29, a truck driver in the U.S. who immigrated from Uzbekistan in 2010 and was living in Patterson, N.J., allegedly drove a rented truck along a bike path of the former West Side Highway from Houston to Chambers street, killing at least eight people and injuring 12 before colliding with a school bus.\n\nA police officer at the scene shot Saipov in the abdomen, and he was taken into custody, police said. Saipov left a note in the truck pledging allegiance to the Islamic State, police said.\n\nMarch 20, 2017 SWORD ATTACK IN MANHATTAN AT 36th STREET AND NINTH AVENUE\n\nJames Jackson, then 28, of Baltimore, was charged with terrorism, in addition to murder, after the slaying of a black man who had been picking through a trash can. He is charged with stabbing Timothy Caughman in the chest and back with a 26-inch sword pulled from his black overcoat.\n\n\"James Jackson prowled the streets of New York for three days in search of a black person to assassinate in order to launch a campaign of terrorism against our Manhattan community and the values we celebrate,\" the district attorney, Cyrus Vance, wrote in announcing the charges, which also include a count of murder in the second degree as a hate crime.\n\nSept. 17, 2016 PRESSURE-COOKER BOMB IN MANHATTAN AT 135 W. 23rd ST.\n\nAhmad Khan Rahami, then 28, an Afghan-born U.S. citizen, was charged with bombing and use of a weapon of mass destruction after a pressure-cooker explosion in the Chelsea neighborhood injured 31 people. A second homemade bomb didn’t explode. Rahami was also charged with setting off a pipe bomb at a Marine Corps race in Seaside Park, N.J.\n\nA federal jury convicted Rahami on Oct. 16 and sentencing is scheduled Jan. 18.\n\nOct. 23, 2014 HATCHET ATTACK IN QUEENS ON JAMAICA AVENUE NEAR 160TH STREET\n\nZale Thompson, 32, was shot dead by police after attacking four officers with an 18-inch hatchet, wounding two of them. Thompson had converted to Islam two years earlier and a search of his computers found he spent time reading about beheadings and an intrusion at the White House, police said. “This was a terrorist attack,” Police Commissioner William Bratton said.\n\nMay 1, 2010 TIMES SQUARE ATTEMPTED BOMBING IN MANHATTAN AT CORNER OF 45TH STREET AND SEVENTH AVENUE.\n\nStreet vendors reported smoke coming from a Nissan Pathfinder parked at Times Square. Police officers and firefighters who responded found the vehicle filled with propane tanks, gasoline canisters and fertilizer, as well as fireworks, clocks and wiring.\n\nThe FBI traced keys found in the vehicle to Faisal Shahzad, then 30, of Bridgeport, Conn. He was arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport two days after the vehicle was found. He told investigators he was trained to make bombs in Waziristan, Pakistan. Shahzad pleaded guilty in federal court to counts including attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction and attempted terrorism transcending national boundaries, and he was sentenced to life in prison in November 2010.\n\nMarch 6, 2008, PIPE BOMB EXPLOSION IN TIMES SQUARE\n\nExplosives packed in a metal ammunition box blew up at 3:43 a.m. outside a U.S. Armed Forces recruiting office in the middle of Times Square. Nobody was injured, but police suspected the bombing might have been related to similar early-morning incidents May 5, 2005, outside the British Consulate at 845 Third Ave. between 51st and 52nd streets, and on Oct. 26, 2007, outside the Mexican Consulate at 27 E. 39th St.\n\nSept. 11, 2001 AIRLINERS CRASHING INTO WORLD TRADE CENTER\n\nNearly 3,000 people died when hijackers took control of four airliners and flew them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York, the Pentagon near Washington, D.C., and a field in Shanksville, Pa. A single Freedom Tower has been rebuilt at the New York site bounded by West, Vesey, Fulton and Washington streets. A few blocks north of the building on West Street is where the truck attack happened Tuesday.\n\nJuly 31, 1997 BROOKLYN BOMB PLOT 248 FOURTH AVENUE\n\nPolice warned of a bomb plot raided an apartment where two Palestinian immigrants, Gazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer, then 23, and Lafi Khalil, then 22, were shot and apprehended. Four pipe bombs, which authorities said were rigged as suicide devices, were found in the apartment. Mezer confessed to plotting to bomb a New York subway train and was sentenced to life in prison for federal charges including conspiracy to kill a U.S. citizen. Khalil was acquitted of conspiracy charges for the bombs, but sentenced to three years in prison for visa fraud and misuse.\n\nFeb. 23, 1997 EMPIRE STATE BUILDING SHOOTING IN MANHATTAN AT 350 FIFTH AVE.\n\nA 69-year-old Palestinian teacher, Ali Hassan Abu Kamal, shot seven people – killing one person and wounding six – on the 86th floor observation deck of the iconic building. He then fatally shot himself in the head with a .380 Beretta handgun. Witnesses told CNN he muttered something about Egypt before starting to shoot.\n\nMarch 1, 1994 SHOOTING ON THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE\n\nLebanese-born immigrant Rashid Baz, then 28, shot at a van filled with 15 Orthodox Jewish students, killing one and wounding three. His lawyers argued that he was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from the civil war in Lebanon. Baz was convicted in a New York court of second-degree murder and multiple counts of attempted murder, and sentenced in January 1995 to 141 years in prison.\n\nFeb. 26, 1993 WORLD TRADE CENTER BOMBING\n\nA 1,500-pound truck bomb made from fertilizer and hydrogen-gas cylinders exploded beneath the north tower, killing six people and injuring more than 1,000. Four conspirators, including Ramzi Yousef, who arrived from Pakistan under a British passport with an assumed name, were convicted of the bombing and each was sentenced to 240 years in prison."
