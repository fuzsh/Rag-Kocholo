Adding to our already impressive line of completely modular mufflers, a lot of riders were asking for this so here they are. Every muffler will have a small Stealth logo laser etched onto the rear of the cone/tip facing away from the bike. Other custom logo placement is available upon request.\n\nAll hand Tig welded muffler creates an awesome array of colors worthy of your trophy case. This includes the muffler and muffler clamp with every order and is a direct replacement for all model Stealth Pipes model headers. Will come with bracket welded on the backside for a perfect fit to your existing system and existing mounting bracket.\n\n2 1/4\" Inner Diameter on inlet of muffler for those of you looking to replace the mufflers on other brand systems or custom headers.\n\nPhotos with the original Pipe Bomb Muffler in it are for sizing reference only.
