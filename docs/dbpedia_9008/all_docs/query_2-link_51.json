        "text": "PS: I've seen the stickers on a bike - anybody who would think that the sticker is advertising an actual pipe bomb - is an idiot - IMHO\n\nAt least they didn't blow the dude's bike up this time.\n\nGirl I work with has one of their stickers on her bike. She wanted to know just what the hell kind of idiot would be likely to put that on a real pipe bomb. I figure probably the same people who are likely to try blowing up a freeway overpass with a Lite Brite.\n\nIn Australia, you can approach the Prime Minister with an executioner's ax while he's out walking and get a hug - but don't try it with a running chainsaw...\n\nA sticker on a bike? Come on guys!\n\nLast year, my wife's mother and grandmother were checking their luggage at the airport. The ticket agent commented that it was amazing my wife's grandmother still had a driver's license at 95 years of age. My mother-in-law commented \"Oh yeah, she's a real firecracker\". They wouldn't let grandma on the plane. Detained her for two hours - full cavity search and everything.\n\nI call BS! Full cavity search for Grammy? They're definitely sticklers but that's a bit too far. No way!\n\nStickler my eye! Someone has a granny fetish!\n\nLast year, my wife's mother and grandmother were checking their luggage at the airport.
