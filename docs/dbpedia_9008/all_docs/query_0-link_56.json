        "text": "Frame\n\nThumpstar Tri-Bar Chassis\n\nWith developments in chassis strengthening and design, Thumpstar’s new Tri-Bar Frame allows the bike to feel more solid under foot while allowing the bike to perform with greater agility and comfort than ever before. Additions to the frame allow the header pipe to be re-routed under the frame, reducing the likeliness of pipe burns to the legs, include removable footpeg mounts, which can be easily replaced and allow the kickstand to be removed for racing, and a reinforced adjustable steering stop. The new frame is also capable of housing the new Thumpstar airbox but it is not yet a stock option.\n\nWheels\n\nAK7 Wheels\n\nWe’ve redesigned and strengthened our AK7 wheels to give you the comfort of knowing buckled rims and loose spokes are a thing of the past. The cast aluminum hub has been changed to run a 6-bolt sprocket and 4-bolt disc while moving to a 20mm axle that allows for oversized wheel bearings. We’ve swapped those stretch-prone steel spokes for anti-stretch and snap-resistant stainless spokes. And lastly, the rims have been upgraded to top-of-the-line aluminum alloy.\n\nSuspension\n\nVS1 Front Forks\n\nOur new line of VS1 front forks provides a plush yet stable ride through all those bumps, ruts, and jumps. Improved outers coupled with our reliable valving lets the front end have a settled movement while allowing greater front wheel feedback, keeping the fork to be rigid while handling bigger impacts.\n\nHeader\n\nPipe Bomb 2.0 head pipe\n\nA redesigned frame came with requirements for a new exhaust header. The new Pipe Bomb 2.0 head pipe from Thumpstar allows exhaust gasses to expand, cool, and ramp back up at a higher velocity when exiting. This results in a greater bottom and low-end response while keeping the tuning in check for the top end.\n\nLinkage\n\nSwingarm and Linkage developments\n\nThe new TSX bikes have received yet another significant upgrade, which brings performance closer to that of full-size motorcycles, rear linkage. Rather than traditionally attaching the shock to the top of the swingarm, we have scaled and applied linkage shared with the likes of full-size race bikes to attach to the bottom of the swingarm. This improves handling in the rear and completely changes the riding experience of these bikes.\n\nEngine\n\n212 Engine\n\nGiving you the thump you need to get off the line and the punch that gets you out of the gate, the 212 engine is race ready and has a powerful advantage with its Pipe Bomb Exhaust System that is ready to take the lead of the pack.\n\nAirbox\n\nOne of our most exciting developments for 2020 was the design and production of our very own airboxes for the TSX and the TSB. Advances in 3D modeling and printing have allowed us to give you a system that provides much better air filtration with a dual-layer filter, while increasing airflow to the engine. The airbox prevents harmful particles from entering your engine where traditional minibike foam filters would typically fail.\n\nWaterproof Electronics\n\nAll of our new bikes come equipped with redesigned looms and electronics. We have done away with single flimsy wires and connectors and replaced them with heavy-duty multi-core wiring and sturdy connectors. Accompanied by waterproof plugs and electronics such as the Revking CDI, Rectifier, and Coil, makes this is a far superior package to any of the competition.\n\nRear Axle\n\nWe have increased our rear axle to 20mm and made it hollow, then heat treated it, which makes it a similar weight to the 15mm axle but much stronger. Finally, made it a Lockheed design so only need one 30mm spanner for removal.\n\nFootpegs\n\nOur new footpegs have been made 56mm wide, the same as aftermarket motocross 250/450 footpegs, for better grip and rider comfort. We used high-quality stainless steel material for strength and to look fresh for years to come, finished off with perfectly fitting springs."
