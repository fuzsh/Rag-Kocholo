He was sentenced to 20 hours of community service, plus fines and costs, which haven't been totaled yet, said Carrie Klein, chief assistant prosecutor for the Kalamazoo County Prosecutor's Office.\n\nHolddridge was originally arrested for making a false bomb threat, a felony, but the prosecutor's office reduced the charge to disturbing the peace, a misdemeanor.\n\nHoldridge said the sticker is a reference to\n\nand that he forgot the sticker was even on the bike. But he didn't tell police that.\n\n\"I didn't enlighten them. I was naive,\" Holdridge told the Kalamazoo Gazette in July. A 53-year-old Kalamazoo resident, Holdridge is unemployed and on disability.\n\nWhen Holdridge and his friend were staging the protest, a federal security guard noticed that Holdridge's bike had the sticker and she called police.\n\nA SWAT team showed up to investigate. Holdridge told the officers that the sign was \"was just a joke\" and that he prefers comedy to make a point. He also said that pipe bombs \"can be purchased at Wal-Mart for $99.99.\"\n\nHoldridge was arrested and spent the night in the Kalamazoo County Jail.\n\nHoldridge's attorney, John Targowski of Kalamazoo, has said the prosecutor offered a plea bargain that included dropping the charge in exchange for 40 hours of community service and psychological counseling.\n\nThe\n\nlists four incidents between 2001 and 2011 when police were called because of a bike with a sticker promoting the band, including a 2009 evacuation of a terminal at Memphis International Airport.\n\nThe Pensacola, Fla., band was formed in 1997 and broke up in 2011. They started out playing new wave music, the switched to country, but they are most associated with performing punk-folk music."
