        "text": "Akayed Ullah was taken into custody on Sunday.\n\nMotive: Ullah told investigators he carried out the attack because of recent Israeli actions in Gaza, a law enforcement source said.\n\nMore on suspect: In conversations with authorities, Ullah pledged allegiance to ISIS, according to one law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the investigation.\n\nHe is of Bangladeshi descent and lives in Brooklyn, two law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nUllah held a Taxi & Limousine Commission license from March 2012 to March 2015, after which the license was not renewed, TLC spokesman Allan Fromberg said.\n\nIt’s unclear “whether he drove for any particular base, or whether he simply got the license but didn’t drive at all,” Fromberg said.\n\nResidency: Ullah came to the United States in 2011 on an F43 family immigrant visa, said Department of Homeland Security spokesman Tyler Houlton.\n\nHe is now a lawful permanent resident.\n\nAccording to the State Department, F43 visas are granted to children of American citizens’ siblings.\n\n(New York police have named 27-year-old Brooklyn resident Akayed Ullah as the suspect who was wearing a homemade explosive device that detonated at the Port Authority bus terminal near Times Square. Courtesy of CNN and YouTube. Posted on Dec 11, 2017)\n\nWhat his neighbor says: Alan Butrico owns a Brooklyn building next to the home where he says Ullah lives with his family.\n\nHe said Ullah lives in the basement, while his sister and brother live above him.\n\n“He wasn’t friendly at all. The family was very quiet themselves. They don’t talk to nobody.”\n\n“They just stay there,” he said, adding that his tenants reported hearing “screaming and yelling” coming from Ullah’s home the last two nights.\n\nThe tenants did not call police, he said.\n\nType of device: Ullah wore an “improvised low-tech explosive device attached to his body,” which he intentionally detonated, Police Commissioner James O’Neill said.\n\nThe device, a pipe bomb, was attached to Ullah with Velcro and zip ties, said John Miller, NYPD deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism.\n\nHow bomb was made: According to a senior New York law enforcement official and a city official being briefed on the investigation, Ullah told police he made the device at his workplace.\n\nIt’s unclear where he’s employed.\n\nAdded Gov. Andrew Cuomo during a news conference, “Anyone can go on the internet and download garbage and vileness on how to put together an amateur-level explosive device, and that is the reality that we live with.”\n\n(New York City subway bomb attack details released by officials. Courtesy of CBC News and YouTube. Posted on Dec 11, 2017)\n\nBeing treated: Ullah is at Bellevue Hospital, where he is being treated for lacerations and burns to his hands and abdomen, New York City Fire Department Commissioner Daniel Nigro said.\n\nOther injuries minor: Two victims at Mount Sinai West and one at Mount Sinai Queens are being treated for headaches and ringing in the ears, Nigro said.\n\nSuspect affiliations: It’s unclear if Ullah is linked to any terror organization, but when asked if Ullah was connected to ISIS, O’Neill responded only that Ullah “did make statements, but we will not talk about that.”\n\nLocation and time: The blast detonated around 7:20 a.m. ET in an underground walkway connecting two subway lines, officials said.\n\nPolice respond to an explosion at the Port Authority bus terminal on Monday in New York.\n\nOn grainy surveillance footage, commuters are seen walking through a tunnel when a burst of smoke erupts into the hallway, quickly filling it.\n\nCommuters flinch and take cover. When the smoke clears, a man can be seen lying on the ground in the hallway.\n\n(Akayed Ullah allegedly detonated a pipe bomb underneath New York City’s Port Authority. Here’s what we know about the suspected terrorist. Courtesy of Fox News and YouTube. Posted on Dec 11, 2017)\n\n“Fortunately for us, the bomb partially detonated,” Cuomo said.\n\n“It was not a sophisticated device. It was a homemade device.”\n\n“He did detonate it, but it did not fully have the effect that he was hoping for.”\n\n“The explosive chemical did ignite. It was in a pipe, but the pipe itself did not explode. So he wound up hurting himself.”\n\nA key point of the investigation will be determining if the hallway is where Ullah intended to detonate the device, O’Neill said.\n\nMembers of the NYPD forensics team were seen on Eighth Avenue, carrying a large brown bag, which they placed into a police van.\n\nPort Authority police watch as people evacuate after the explosion.\n\nFrancisco Ramirez said he was exiting a bus when he heard two blasts, even though he was wearing headphones.\n\n“From what I saw it sounded like it came from the subway, but I’m just guessing,” he said.\n\n“It was two distinct explosions seconds from each other.”\n\n“As I was making my way toward the outside, I kept getting shoved by cops and there were cops at every entrance blocking and there was police and SWAT everywhere.”\n\n“It was scary. It was just a lot of chaos but I didn’t see any injuries.”\n\n(Mayor Bill de Blasio delivers a press conference regarding the explosion that occurred in New York City on December 11th. Courtesy of USA TODAY and YouTube. Posted on Dec 11, 2017)\n\nMarlyn Yu Sherlock was at a retail store on the main floor of the terminal when people began flooding out of the subway entrance, “screaming, running in panic,” she said.\n\n“The PA system was still blaring Christmas carols,” Sherlock said.\n\n“It took about four minutes before men in black cop uniforms started shooing people out of Port Authority.”\n\n“As I walked further away from the building, I kept asking the heavily armed cops what it was.\n\nThey said ‘suspicious package.'”\n\n“The Port Authority Bus Terminal was built in 1950 and expanded in 1979. It accommodates 220,000 passenger trips a day.\n\n(Penn Station, Grand Central and other places along New York City’s transit systems will see increased security measures in place following Monday morning’s bomb blast at under the Port Authority Bus Terminal.
