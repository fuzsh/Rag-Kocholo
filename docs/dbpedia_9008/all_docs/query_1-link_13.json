        "text": "Here at Thumpstar, we have always prided ourselves on our core lineup. The kids bikes which bring smiles to kids faces and butterflies to parents stomachs. The TSB70 for us, is nothing short to be proud of. The perfect bike for kids to learn on the TSB70 has a similar size to our recently discontinued TSK50 but boasts the strength and heavy duty performance of our TSR88PRO built for adults.\n\nFeng-Hong have long delivered an engine package which provides the traditional Thumpstar thump, with the peace of mind your bike will consistently start. The semi automatic 4 speed engine gives your child a gearbox which allows them to select gears via the standard gear lever without a clutch, this makes it much easier to ride for beginners, giving them more ability to focus on learning braking, throttle control, and when to change gear. With typical maintenance these engines go for years and years to come typically lasting far past your child's need for a bigger bike while they grow.\n\nPaired with the engine is our Pipe Bomb 2.0 exhaust header and muffler. Many parents struggle with bikes that are too loud when their child isnâ€™t racing. Therefore, with the TSB70 we have aimed and achieved optimal tuning with minimal noise.\n\nWe have found through testing and customer feedback that many bikes regardless of size get ridden by both kids and adults from time to time. That means the frame components must be up to scratch in terms of strength and handling. We have bolstered the design of the TSB70 to match that of our TSR88 which was mini bike built for adult riders, which gives us peace of mind that bent frames are a thing of the past."
