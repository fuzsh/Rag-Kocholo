        "text": "PUTNAM COUNTY, Fla. (WJXT) – Newly-released body camera video shows the moment a chemical pipe bomb exploded on a deputy in Putnam County, Florida.\n\nIt happened during a traffic stop earlier this spring.\n\nThe deputy was not seriously hurt, but the driver is facing a long list of charges.\n\nThe body camera video shows the Putnam County Sheriff’s deputy pull over 60-year-old Charles Legault.\n\nThe deputy first smelled marijuana and then asked Legault if he could search the truck for more drugs.\n\nLegault consented to the search.\n\nWithin seconds, the deputy found what he believed was drugs and paraphernalia.\n\nLegault claimed during the search that bags containing a white substance found in a cigarette pouch were for his “six heart attacks.”\n\nThe deputy, who also found a handgun in the seat, asked Legault to get out of the truck.\n\nEight minutes and 45 seconds after the traffic stop, the deputy was still searching for drugs when the chemical pipe bomb exploded.\n\n“What the f---,” the deputy said after the bomb exploded in his face.\n\nAlthough the deputy initially struggled to breathe, he managed to call for backup and place Legault into handcuffs.\n\nMoments later, it became obvious the chemicals that exploded in the deputy’s face were making it harder for him to breathe.\n\n“It’s in my f------ lungs or something,” the deputy could be heard saying in the body camera video.\n\nThe deputy’s uniform could be seen covered in a white chemical powder.\n\nThat powder was believed to be chlorine.\n\nThe deputy was later taken to an area hospital to be treated for respiratory injuries from the chemical explosion.\n\nRetired Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office director of homeland security and investigations Tom Hackney says the deputy’s injuries could have been a lot worse.\n\n“Had that been filled more or had been larger or it got in his eyes, you could talk about blindness and those kind of permanent things that could happen to him and permanent lung damage, depending on how close he is,” Hackney described. “You could see a struggle to breathe just really highlights how dangerous these traffic stops can be.”\n\nIt was windy that day. Hackney said the winds may have helped dissipate the fumes from the explosion, potentially helping the deputy.\n\n“I think everything was in this officer’s favor that it had a successful outcome as much as it did, that he wasn’t harmed worse than he was,” Hackney added.\n\nThe explosion prompted a bomb squad to be called in to make sure the truck was cleared of any other explosives before deputies could search for more drugs.\n\nThe following day, deputies raided Legault’s home to look for more explosives. Although they did not find any other bombs, they did find more illegal drugs.\n\nLegault was jailed without bond on multiple felony charges related to trafficking meth, possessing an explosive device and battery on a law enforcement officer."
