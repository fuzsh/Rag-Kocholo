Each spacious suite has a flat-screen TV. The hotel features a rooftop cafe. WiFi is free.\n\n“The hotel is in a quite nice area. It can be accessed either from Vesterport station, which is a short walk away or you can also take the 2A bus from Copenhagen Central Station, which stops opposite the hotel. Nørreport station is also a short walk away but a bit further. I loved staying at this hotel. The suite was lovely and spacious and all the room doors are overlooking the swimming pool area, which is beautiful, like a tropical rainforest, nice and warm with relaxing music and a lounge area and bar by the pool. It is great to start the day at the gym or use the swimming pool in the evening to chill after a long day out and about. I loved the fact that there is a Marshall speaker in the room to play music. There are also all sorts of toiletries in the room, from a toothbrush to a disposable razor, things that sometimes we forget. Also, everything is organic and environmentally friendly! Everyone in reception is lovely and they do everything they can to make your stay a perfect one. I found everyone very helpful and friendly.”\n\n58 hotel reviews\n\nNimb Hotel\n\nAverage review score: 9.1\n\nLocated in Copenhagen’s famous Tivoli Gardens, this stylish boutique hotel is housed in an impressive Moorish-style building.\n\n“The facade is mind bendingly beautiful.
