        "text": "â\n\nI first met Lauren in Ubud, Bali, in 2019. I had just arrived atÂ HubudÂ â a co-working space in the middle of the Balinese Jungle, with cheeky monkeys everywhere. One week earlier, I had a well-paid and secure job as a consultant, which I'd manage to throw overboard to follow my dream; start my own business while traveling the world at the same time. Things had gone pretty fast since I made the decision. I hadn't really had time to think before that morning, where reality hit. There I was, almost 12,000 kilometers away from everything I knew, and pretty far out of my comfort zone.\n\nWhen I walked intoÂ Hubud, the first person I saw was Lauren. She was friendly, she smiled, and waved me overâ¦ from that second, I knew everything was going to be alright. The following weeks we sharedâand both overcameâthe fear of getting on a motorbike for the first time and navigating the at times insane, Balinese traffic chaos.\n\nI see a lot of myself in Lauren. For better and for worse. She is openminded, spontaneous, and has a knack for doing the unexpected. And on top, she is hilarious to be around. I truly admire her courage to follow her own path and live out her dreamsâeven the ones everyone else thinks of as crazy.\n\nLauren is a jack of many trades, a hard-working businesswoman, and a spiritual yogi at the same time. She mixes the best of both worlds in a way that I personally find incredibly inspiring. I look forward to visiting her latest project, Beluna, a co-working space for dreamers and doers, she has built from scratch in Ubud, following Balinese traditions and customs for bamboo craftsmanship. During Corona, Lauren has, unlike many foreigners, stayed in Bali. She helps struggling locals in the best ways she can, while the opening of her little gem has been postponed a bit for now.\n\nI have no doubt that we'll be working together somehow in the future; only time will tell how. I could go on ... However, for now, I hope you'll get as inspired by Lauren as we are at LULUâLAND.Â\n\nâ\n\n/ LOUISEÂ BÃGESKOVÂ HOU\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nOK, LET'S START WITHÂ THEÂ EASYÂ ONES\n\nâ\n\nName:\n\nLauren Bagley\n\nâ\n\nBirth month/year:\n\n12 January 1988\n\nâ\n\nNationality:\n\nBritish\n\nâ\n\nCurrently located in:\n\nBali\n\nâ\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nFreelance Project Manager, Owner of Events company and Virtual Assistant Company, Owner and founder of Beluna Coworking, Bali\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMOSTÂ OFÂ USÂ HAVEÂ CERTAINÂ ROUTINES, LET'S GETÂ TOÂ KNOWÂ YOURS\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the first thing you do in the morning?\n\nStretch! Then have a hot lemon water\n\nâ\n\nâWhat is a typical day like for you?\n\nWake up, hot lemon water, put contact lenses in, throw on some tight yoga lycra items, head to a yoga class in Ubud (try not to think about the ten thousand things in my head and say ohm a few times), head home to shower, listen to a podcast, get dressed, journal, gratitude list then âTo Doâ List âalways a never ending list, usually transferred from the day beforeâ¦! Jump on my scooter, head to a meeting with either a builder or a potential partnership, work from a cafÃ© on my Beluna project, which is due to open soon. Drink loads of coffee, eat my first meal of the day around 1pm (I intermittent fast) usually a smoothie bowl and a matcha latte, then I head home, and continue with the Beluna task list, including many zoom meetings and lots of organising and administration. I usually work until 9pm in the evening, then try to switch off phone and laptop. Shower, put some chilled music on, and go to bed around 11pm.\n\nâ\n\nAnd now that we're at it â what are the last things you do before bedtime?\n\nSwitch all digital devices off, light some incense, read a book, do somemore stretching, have a hot shower and usually drown myself in coconut oil\n\nâ\n\nHow do you spend your weekends?\n\nYoga, walks, lunches with friends, beach time, massage, dancing and most importantly lots of eating. The cafes in Ubud are a delight to say the least! I try to switch off from work things as much as possible as my weeks are so full on.\n\nâ\n\nWhen was the last time you celebrated?\n\nToday, most days. I like to celebrate all things, especially the small wins.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWEÂ ALLÂ HAVEÂ MOREÂ ORÂ LESSÂ FLATTERINGÂ TRAITS\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is your guilty pleasure?\n\nChocolate. Always. Anything chocolate.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is your superpower?\n\nI have a white streak in my hair like storm from X Men. I can dislocate my hip on demand. I can smile when Iâm angry (super power or slightly creepy?Who knows).\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAÂ LITTLEÂ BITÂ ABOUTÂ PASSION, NOTÂ THEÂ FRUIT\n\nÂ\n\nWhat could you spend all day talking about?\n\nHealth and nutrition and magic potions that come from nature that can heal the human body. That â or the fact that loads of the Black Mirror episodes have come true. Can we talk about that?\n\nâ\n\nWhat inspires you?\n\nNature, dreams, art, colours, poetry, travel, culture, humans, kindess of strangers\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nLET'S DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO WHAT INSPIRES YOU\n\nÂ\n\nRepeat or shuffle? What have you been listening to lately, and what are you humming in the shower?\n\nMusic: Vivii, Band of Horses, The National, Ben Howard, Future Islands\n\nPodcasts: Abraham Hicks, Joe Dispenza, Louise Haye\n\nÂ\n\nPoster or collectorsâ items? If we gave you a million, what would be decorating your walls?\n\nCollectors items.\n\nâ\n\n\"I donât actually follow the news... I stopped watching/reading it a long time ago.\"\n\nâ\n\nNewspapers, journals, magazines, online platforms, digital media, podcastsâ¦ you name it â how do you keep yourself updated, and what are your news sources?\n\nI donât actually follow the news (brainwashing). I stopped watching/reading it a long time ago. I prefer to choose the content I listen to so I follow certain people of interest or inspiration on Instagram, listen to podcasts of inspirational people I would like to learn from, a mixture of business, leadership, spirituality and health.\n\nâ\n\nIf you could have lunch with one person, alive or dead, who would that be?\n\nMy grandad, my dadâs dad that I never met. I would love to meet him and hear all his stories and memories.\n\nâ\n\nBooks, movies, and/or series â what can you recommend?\n\nBooks: The Alchemist - Paulo Coelho, 5am Club â Robin Sharma, DaringGreatly â BrenÃ© Brown\n\nMovies: The Notebook (of course.), Avatar, Up, Shawshank Redemption,Shutter Island, Bridesmaids\n\nSeries: Sense 8, OA, Normal People, Utopia, Black Mirror (an insight into my mind)\n\nâ\n\nWhich three Instagram accounts should everyone follow?\n\nMark Groves â to learn about all the love things\n\nDeepak Chopra â to learn about life and keeping calm for all the life things\n\nEva Angelina â for lols.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nYOURÂ LIFEÂ SOÂ FAR: SMOOTHÂ SAILINGÂ ORÂ OBSTACLEÂ COURSE â A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PAST\n\nÂ\n\nWho was your first big love?\n\nFarran Wooler, at School. First love, first heartbreak, first boyfriend that had to carry me home because I was too drunk to walk.\n\nâ\n\nWhat's the single best realization you have ever had?\n\nThat we are completely and utterly responsible for our lives and that we create our reality, whether we choose to perceive things as good or bad, is up to us. Mind blowing. (and a lot of responsibility)\n\nâ\n\n\"Everyone thought I had lost my mind and would be back in a month or so (Laurenâs gone cray cray again).\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat's the best bad or crazy decision you have ever made? That moment that seemed so wrong but turned out so right. If you don't make bad or crazy decisions, have you then ever made a decision that changed your entire life?\n\nIf you asked my parents, they probably wouldnât know which one to pick with meâ¦\n\nHowever, I would have to say cancelling my wedding, quitting my well paid secure London job in the music industry, packing my bags and moving to Ibiza, without a plan, a place to live or a job. Everyone thought I had lost my mind and would be back in a month or so (Laurenâs gone cray cray again).\n\n(I lived there nearly five years.)\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAND A LOT MORE ABOUT THE PRESENT\n\nâ\n\nHow are you, really? It's nice to check in every once in a while.Â\n\nI am good, really good. Thanks for asking.\n\nHowever the past few months have been challenging, confronting and eyeopening. Havenât they? Who would have thought a virus named after a beer would affect us all so deeply and strangely and bring up all those vulnerable thoughts and moments that we all have that we didnât know we have, and then make it a reason for your exâs to message you and see how you are, and your friends to start sending you weird memes because they donât have a job anymore, and then you just cry for no reason.\n\nBut yes, Iâm fine. Iâm fine.\n\nâ\n\nWhen are you the happiest?Â\n\nWhen Iâm eating. Preferably surrounded by loved ones and funny ones. Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat scares you the most?\n\nLosing my loved ones\n\nâ\n\nWhat keeps you up at night these days?\n\nMy to do list usually, missing people, lucid dreams, the need to wee.\n\nÂ\n\nTell us one thing people would never know about you by just looking at you?\n\nThat I have an obsession with extremely spicy food and put chillis on everything, and can probably out eat the biggest man at the table.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat habit would improve your life?\n\nDaily meditation, to keep me more present. I do it, but still think of 10,000 things at the same time. Â\n\nâ\n\nWe all have qualities that don't really have any rhyme or reason. What is one thing you don't understand about yourself?Â\n\nWhy I am so bad at time keeping. I am terrible at it, always have been. My teacher used to make me write lines on the board at school, like Bart Simpson. But even she gave up.\n\nâ\n\nWhat works for you at the moment, and what doesnât?\n\nWorks: Morning routine, yoga, being in nature, dancing\n\nDoesnât: Too much time on the computer, not enough free time, feeling stressed and trying not to\n\nÂ\n\nWhen do you feel the most comfortable in your own skin?\n\nWhen Iâm with my family or with my best friend Sophie, because she knows all my things.\n\nâ\n\nWhat makes you feel insecure?\n\nBeing in a large group of people and having to speak in front of them\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAND OF COURSE, AÂ SNEAK PEEK INTOÂ THE FUTURE\n\nâ\n\n\"I am currently creating a dream and a vision I have had for a long time, something that will support many people to live the life of their dreams, whilst developing their personal skills, mindsets and growth and opportunities.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat's the best thing about the next thing you are during?\n\nI am currently creating a dream and a vision I have had for a long time, something that will support many people to live the life of their dreams, whilst developing their personal skills, mindsets and growth and opportunities.\n\nâ\n\n\"Plans are worthlessâ but planning is everything\"Â â Dwight D. Eisenhower. What does the future look like for you â what are your dreams and goals?\n\nLiving in Bali, traveling more, more free time to spend with my family, continuing to build my business and expanding to other locations, learning new skills\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nADVICE â EASY TO GIVE, HADER TO FOLLOW\n\nâ\n\n\"Iâm quite hard on myself which can be a good thing and a bad thing, but I donât allow myself to sit around and mope for long. I usually give myself a kick up the ass to put things into action and find a solution.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat (or who) motivates you in difficult times?Â\n\nMyself mostly. Iâm quite hard on myself which can be a good thing and a bad thing, but I donât allow myself to sit around and mope for long. I usually give myself a kick up the ass to put things into action and find a solution. Failing that, my mum usually tells me how it is when I need to hear it.\n\nâ\n\nGood advice is priceless. What is the best piece of advice youâve ever gotten?\n\nRemembering that nothing lasts forever. When I first heard this as a little girl it made me feel sad, but now Iâm older, I understand it. And I like it. It makes me embrace every single moment and love it for what it is, whether it feels good or it feels uncomfortable. It wonât last forever, so just be in it.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the kindest thing anyone ever said to you or the best compliment anyone ever gave you?Â\n\nThat I am like an onion (I know it doesnât sound very flattering). But the person was saying that they enjoy getting to know me because there are many layers of me and that they can tell that the more I trust someone the more I allow them in, and that it makes them feel special to be in my world. I liked it that someone could get that about me and see me authentically.\n\nâ\n\nHow do you heal a broken heart?\n\nYou donât. You just mend it with gold and make it even more big and beautiful than before. Like the Japanese do with pottery â âKintzsugiâ\n\nÂ\n\nâ\n\nTHE FORECAST â TRENDS AND TENDENCIES\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is going to be the next big thing? (concepts, businesses, ideas, mega trends, etc.)\n\nOnline businesses and remote teams, Artificial Intelligence, Robots.\n\nâ\n\nWe would love to find out about cool new places and things to do in your area. What are your favorite places? Where do you like to go to have fun?Â\n\nâ\n\nRadiantly Alive for yoga classes,\n\nSayuri for delectable smoothie bowls,\n\nLa Brisa, Canggu for sunset cocktails and music,\n\nAkasha, Ubud for good DJâs, dancing and cacao ceremonies,\n\nSage Restaurant for amazing plant based food,\n\nAlchemy, Ubud for the most delicious vegan desserts,\n\nTjampuhan Spa for rest and relax\n\nUbud Yoga House, for yoga overlooking the rice terraces\n\nThe Traveler, for romantic dinner\n\nSilÃªncio, for out of this world party experiences\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE ONES THAT DIDN'T FIT INTO THE OTHER CATEGORIES\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the most favorite, most useful, and most useless object you own, respectively?\n\nFavorite: My scooter â I love the freedom of jumping on it and riding through the rice fields, itâs the best way to see the beauty of Bali\n\nUseful: My computer, it keeps me in touch with my family, my clients, do my shopping, book my flights, take online programs and learn new things â endless possibilities from the box with the apple on it.\n\nUseless: A pair of heeled shoes that I brought back from the UK with me at Christmas. No need for heels in Bali. Ever. But they look lovely on my shelf, collecting all the dust.\n\nâ\n\nWhat was the last thing you searched for on your phone? Be careful: you might be required to show proof.Â\n\nâIsometric exercisesâ â because someone told me to do them and I didnât know what they were.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n\"Now, that I am on different time zones to my closest friends, we usually leave each other voice notes, then respond when the other is awake. Itâs nice to hear their voices, and they are usually hilarious.\"\n\nâ\n\nCall or text? Which is better, and why?\n\nAt the moment â text, because time is a bit limited. Itâs nice to be able to respond at a time when I have space rather than rush a phone call. In fact, I prefer voice notes. Now, that I am on different time zones to my closest friends, we usually leave each other voice notes, then respond when the other is awake. Itâs nice to hear their voices, and they are usually hilarious.\n\nIf I have more time â Calls.\n\nAm I allowed to give 3 answers?\n\nâ\n\nÂ\n\n\"It costs nothing to be polite, compassionate and kind.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat is your pet peeve?\n\nOh god. Thereâs many â rude people, loud people, slow walkers, loud eaters, invasion of personal space, the list goes on!\n\nBut my number one would be rude people. I dated someone recently who was very rude to a waiter. I donât like that, I think it says a lot about someone, and you know one day they will also speak to you like that. It costs nothing to be polite, compassionate and kind.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing in your trash can?\n\nAn empty spirulina packet?... Awkward.\n\nâ\n\nYouâve been given an elephant. You canât give it away or sell it. What would you do with it?\n\nOh I would not want to give it away or sell it. Elephants are my favourite animals because they are strong, mischievious, loyal and the baby ones throw tantrums. I would make my best efforts to get to know the elephant and learn all itâs tricks.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE BIG ONES\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\nTo find the things that make your heart sing, and do that.\n\nWhilst experiencing a rollercoaster of emotions, heart breaks, wins and losses, confusion, pain, joy, intense love, intense loss, laughs, tears, cuddles and experiences, all along the way.\n\nâ\n\nâLook, mom, I made it! â How do you define success?Â\n\nLiving a life of freedom, that fills me with joy and allows me to live an abundant life, in all ways, a life that I can share with my loved ones and share and give to others.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE FINAL TWO\n\nÂ\n\nName three people you would like to answer these questions?\n\nDaria Kalista, Founder of AF Company\n\nVasoulla Demetriou, Founder of Soulshine Retreats\n\nMatt & Laura, Founder of Ekommunity\n\nFÃ¸lg\n\nâ\n\nâHow would you describe LULUâLAND?\n\nThe land in which the ones that know, know. A community hub of all the ones who are crazy enough to believe they can, and they do.\n\nâ\n\nTHEÂ END\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâKeep some room\n\nin your heart\n\nfor the\n\nunimaginableâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWE LOVE TO CONNECT PEOPLE\n\nâ\n\nNAME Lauren Bagley\n\nEMAIL iam@belunabali.com\n\nWEBSITE belunabali.com\n\nINSTAGRAM @misslcb & @belunabali\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nCREDITS\n\nâ\n\nPUBLISHED BY LULUâLAND\n\nPHOTOS KINDLY LENT FROM LAUREN'S PRIVATE ALBUM\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nBUSINESSÂ & ENTREPRENEURSHIP\n\nâ\n\nWhat does progressive fashion that makes a positive difference look like?\n\nâ\n\nIf you ask social entrepreneur Veronica D'Souza, part of the answer is to say no to seasons and sales, limit waste and overproduction, and get as far away from the constructed fashion wheel as possible.\n\nWe need to say yes to beautifully made timeless clothing that lasts beyond this trend and that. We need to strip down and simplifyâin life and in our wardrobe. Fashion with a social conscience never goes out of style!\n\nVeronica founded the clothing brand, Carcel, back in 2016, after having visited and researched female prisons around the world. She found that poverty is the primary cause of female incarceration and decided to do something about it in her own way.\n\nWith Carcel, she aims to create sustainable change within the fashion industry while empowering some of the world's most vulnerable and marginalized women, stuck inside a broken system, with production in prisons in Peru and Thailand in places riddled with the highest crime rates due to poverty.\n\nThe ambition is to transform the time the women serve in prison into a meaningful and productive stay while creating opportunities for education, developing new skills, and fair wages, in return for their know-how. Hopefully, the experience can be a way out of poverty for the women when released.\n\nWe have had the opportunity to meet Veronica at Carcel's tiny Copenhagen headquarter, showroom, and storage combined in one. Where we talked about how she found her own path into social entrepreneurship and had the chance to ask her a couple of questions about the past, present, and future.

The first thing I think about is when I lived in Nairobi, and when I would ask someone I was working with how they were, the answer would always be plural.Â We are good. My wife is good. My children are good. My animals are good.Â The \"How are you?\" is never about one person; it's always about the community you belong to. I always thought that was nice, instead of talking about the I ...;Â I didn't really sleep well last nightÂ ... you know! I like that the individual emotions are dependent on the greater well-being of a bigger whole, and therefore in order to feel good, you need to invest in your community.Â\n\nSo, I'm going to do it the Kenyan way ... We are really goodâboth from a family perspective, which is, of course, the closest circle. I feel extremely lucky and grateful that we live here in Denmark, where it's possible and has been possible even through the shutdown, to move around and be outside. Not having to be stuck in a small apartment with the kids and not being able to go anywhere. You just really get to appreciate nature and freedom in these apocalyptic conditions. I feel extremely privileged about health, as well, when there is something like this going around. We are all healthy, and I think that is the bottom line. We are really good.\n\nAlso, our employees are healthy, which is really important to me. Obviously, it has been and still is a challenge right now because there is a lot of overpopulation in prisons. It can be detrimental if COVID gets into the prisons we work with, so far, knock on wood, everyone is healthy. We're trying to navigate the best possible way and work with the governments and the prisons to figure out how we work around itâwhen it is safe to go in and teach, or do work, and when it's notâbasically to protect them.\n\nOh, and the team here in Copenhagen is good, as well. We are all good and healthy.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n\"Today, more than ever, there is a connection between what has happened in the past and where we want to go in the future. There is no stillness about now.\"\n\nâ\n\nOn the broader range, I'm also very excited about this time. Even though it is full of chaos. A lot of things are coming to the surface that need to be dealt with, discussed, and experienced, not just COVID-19 but also race, gender equality, and capitalism; there is a lot of big conversations right now.Â\n\nActually, I have probably been waiting for those conversations my whole life. And been part of them. But they haven't been mainstream topics in society. So, I'm really grateful and happy, but it's also a very vulnerable time and a tough time for many people. It's not just waking up and feeling happy. It's a complicated and thoughtful time. It's full of emotions, and I think historical emotions. There is some kind of...Â\n\nOkay, this is me, rambling ...Â\n\nThe \"How are you?\" is for me both \"How are we as a community?\" but there is also something about the collectivity of time. Today, more than ever, there is a connection between what has happened in the past and where we want to go in the future. There is no stillness about now. We need to understand, deal, and connect with the past to figure out how we move forward. It's the progressive energy in that, which excites me. The progressive energy in the fashion industry, in production, in the conversations that are happening, but also in all the societal movements regarding equality.\n\nWell, that was the long answer to your question.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nFor people who are unfamiliar with the brand, where did the story of Carcel begin?\n\nWell, it's a brand, but it's actually so much more than that. It's a visionâmultiple visions. We have set up production spaces inside of women's prisons in Thailand and Peru. The idea was formed after a visit I had to a prison in Kenya. I started researching and learning that particular women are most often incarcerated due to poverty-related crimesâwomen who come from low levels of education and extremely marginalized groups in society. Women who have children, who are mothers and when incarcerated, can't provide for their families anymore. When released, there is a lot of stigma in society, and it's very difficult to get a job.\n\nâ\n\n\"The point with Carcel is to enter a space where nobody really goes. A place where there isn't a lot of interaction and definitely not a lot of opportunities for making a wage to provide for yourself, send money home, save up, and become included in the economy.\"\n\nâ\n\nThe point with Carcel is to enter a space where nobody really goes. A place where there isn't a lot of interaction and definitely not a lot of opportunities for making a wage to provide for yourself, send money home, save up, and become included in the economy. These are some of the most marginalized women in the world who are most often forgotten about. We want to provide opportunities here and shed light on the women's capabilities, so they can gain dignity and continue to provide for their children, which makes a big difference for them. It's about self-esteem. It's about feeling that you can be a mother, that you can give your child a birthday present, and support them in school. Many of them actually lost connection with their children before because they were ashamed that they couldn't contribute to their lives and be some kind of provider. It's also about education and learning a different skill, so they don't necessarily have to go out into the streets and continue trafficking drugs, which is what most of them did.\n\nâ\n\nThe question we asked ourselves was: How do we then create a sustainable business model that can create these jobs in a dignifying way? The way we thought about it was looking into places where there already is an incredible tradition for crafts amongst women in rural areas. Places where their craft is something we honor, where they're actually the best, and where they have the skills to be able to contribute with their know-how, so it's a real exchange.\n\nCarcel is also about looking at the materials we use because thinking about the environment is fundamental for even existing as a fashion brand. That's a key driver. We are an extremely dogmatic company in many ways; we source locally in each country of production and only use natural materials that can become earth again. For now, we use alpaca wool from Peru and handmade silk from Thailand.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat did you do before you started Carcel?\n\nOh, where do we start? Actually, I was really into music and literature and very idealistic. I wanted to be part of and participate in the world. I've always felt strongly about social justice on a global level, but I'm way too impatient for politics.Â\n\nI went to UWCAD, an international school, as I got a scholarship to study in Italy when I was 16, together with 200 people from 80 different countries. That was a major game-changer. I came from a small village in Denmark and suddenly found myself in a microcosmos of the world. I was like, wow, okay, you can make friends everywhere, and I was exposed to so many different cultures. That experience made it even more obvious that I wanted to be part of the world somehow and contribute to it.Â\n\nHowever, at the same time, I was extremely cynical about NGOs in general, and the UN, like the classic, \"do good\" field. Not to generalize that every NGO isn't good, I think there are many great NGOs, but unfortunately, there have also been a lot of inefficiencies and focusing more on the fundraising and the fundraisers than understanding how to create solutions that people really want to use. That really didn't motivate me to go into those fields.\n\nâ\n\n\"I decided to apply for business school. I thought, if I could get a better vocabulary, infiltrate capitalism from the inside, and understand why it's creating so much harm, then maybe I could find a way to work within it, change it, and somehow make it work for good.\"\n\nâ\n\nInstead, I chose to look at what I thought was the core evil of the world. The things that were really bad. For me, there were two things; capitalism and the military. This was when I was a bit younger (ha-ha). So, I decided to apply for business school. I thought, if I could get a better vocabulary, infiltrate capitalism from the inside, and understand why it's creating so much harm, then maybe I could find a way to work within it, change it, and somehow make it work for good.Â\n\nOne of the things capitalism does very well is scale. If you could make good solutions scale, you didn't have to convince people to be less selfish. You could just use the system against itself. That was my motivation to go to business school. My mom was like: \"Seriously, you do literature and music. Are you sure you really wanna study finances and budgets?\" and I was like: \"Yeah, there is this whole world of evil, and I know nothing. I want to have a better vocabulary and not just a big anarchist sign.\"\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nI think I was lucky. Right when I started, there was a new movement of social business and social entrepreneurship. It was the first year, and it was exactly what I was looking for without knowing itâhow to make sustainable business solutions where doing good and solving problems in society is ingrained in the core. I became a supernerd and studied all the cases and literature I could find.Â\n\nTogether with two friends from school, I started my first company in 2011. We tried to apply all the knowledge we had gained from case studies, particularly inspired by the bottom of the pyramid theory ... maybe now is not the time to disclose the literature list (ha-ha). But anyway, we stumbled across a study that said that menstruation was the biggest cause of school dropout for girls living in poverty. This was in 2011, and the study was from 2007. Still, nothing had really been done about it. We thought it was weird that there was this obvious fact from the UN, stating that this is the biggest issue, and then there was just not much else.\n\nMy friend was part of a group that was using a menstrual cup. At that time, it was completely unknown, the really early days. She was German, and in Germany, it was connected to some kind of a hippie movement. In Denmark, it was seen as something very gross, unnatural, and weird. We all tried the product, got superexcited, and immediately saw an opportunity to use the cups in a different context. We developed our own product, moved to Kenya, and then founded the business, Ruby Cup, together with women and girls in the slums. It was a very anthropological approach, where we lived there. Everything from the packaging to the marketing, the pricing model, and adjustment to different living situations was done together with the women!\n\nThe project was extremely meaningful, and we learned a lot from just starting a company in a different country. There are a lot of things to be said about that, but it was also a lot of fun. That's how I got into that whole field of social entrepreneurship.\n\nâ\n\n\"I had never gone to a prison before. I knew nothing, and I couldn't find very much. It always makes me curious when you can't really find anything on Google.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhile I was living in Kenya, I visited a women's prison in Nairobi because I was curious about why women were incarcerated. I had never gone to a prison before. I knew nothing, and I couldn't find very much. It always makes me curious when you can't really find anything on Google. For me, it's always about speaking with people: How is it? How do you feel? What is going on? Where are you?Â The women's answers inspired me to start Carcel. They needed employment, financial inclusion, and something to do they could feel proud of. They needed to be able to be providers for their families. We just needed to find a way to create meaningful and educational employment that would make the women feel valuable.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nCOVID-19: No one can get around the fact that there is a worldwide pandemic raging; How has it affected you, Carcel, and your employees here and in the prisons in Thailand and Peru? How have you dealt with the current situation?Â\n\nWe have changed our business radically. We saw it as an opportunity. In order to explain that, I need to explain our business model. Like I said in the beginning, Carcel is more a vision than it is a brand. The brand needs to follow the vision. The vision is a lot of different things. What connects everything is an ambition to be a driver for positive change. Both when it comes to the fashion industry and at the same time creating opportunities for responsible employment and new ways of ethical production, inside a system that is meant to deprive you of everything, which is an oxymoron in itself.\n\nâ\n\n\"Because the fashion industry is as damaging as it is, there is a need for finding new ways of existing. It's very challenging, but if we are not trying to do that, I don't think that the industry should exist at all.\"\n\nâ\n\nBecause the fashion industry is as damaging as it is, there is a need for finding new ways of existing. It's very challenging, but if we are not trying to do that, I don't think that the industry should exist at all.\n\nWe have always been against seasons. We don't have sales, and we don't have collections in order not to be part of the traditional retail wheel, where you basically sell things in stores for a few months, then it goes on sale, and then there is a new collectionâso much waste and devaluation of quality and value.\n\nAfter having worked in the industry for a few years now, I know that retailers are extremely happy if we have a sale-through rate of 60% for an order. If they buy something and sell 60%, that is like the most successful you get. They still stock a brand if it sells in between 30-40%. That's the norm worldwide. Everything else is sold on sale, thrown out, or sold on outlets.\n\nIf you just look at that ...\n\nI think there are so many meaningful conversations going on. Especially about materials and innovation when it comes to recyclingâand that's greatâbut if we don't address the consumption pattern, the way we buy and sell products, then we are actually not changing much.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWe have been working with many different stores, and until now, what we have done in order to not become part of that system is that we have bought back stock that the stores couldn't sell, and then we have sold it to other stores. Great when you want to save the world, but very bad for business (ha-ha)! We couldn't handle taking the cash flow risk, and we couldn't grow that way, without either compromising on being part of the system and allowing stores to put our products on sale or go out of business.Â\n\nWe have been thinking about that for a long time, and when Corona came, and we basically shut down the world, it was very easy to see that the sell-through rate would be terrible. It wouldn't reach anywhere near 60% because the stores were closed. We thought, now is the right time to do it, to go out of this model. Either we would be left with so much unsold stock that we would have to allow the stores to put it on sale, buy it back, or think of a new modelâanyway, the current model wasn't working that well for us. So, we kind of took it as a brave kick in the butt.Â\n\nWe love our retail partners, but let's just say we will be back at some point with a new model. For now, we are stepping out and doing everything online. This also means that we have been able to cut down prices, which I think is a big conversation when it comes to thinking in sustainable ways. If you actually pay proper wages and invest in good materials, it's also an expensive product. There is something about trying to make the prices more accessible to more people. Therefore, we removed the retail markup. Right now, we are developing a new way to be in stores where the stores won't have any stock! We're experimenting with a new way of digital retail.\n\nâ\n\n\"There is a value in being physicalâthis is not a hateful argument towards shopsâI love shops! It's just the way that it works right now that doesn't make sense.\"\n\nâ\n\nThere is a value in being physicalâthis is not a hateful argument towards shopsâI love shops! It's just the way that it works right now that doesn't make sense. There is something about redefining and cherishing the reason for being physical. How can we extend that emotion and make that even more special, and when does it make sense to be digital, so we don't continue the way it works today?\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWe have to admit that we are slightly biased when it comes to the fashion industry and sustainability. At LULUâLAND, we only want to promote brands that attempt to change the status quo of the industry. In your opinion: How are we ever going to get out of this mess we have created? What have you learned? And how can we move forward?\n\nI think I already kind of answered part of this question, like what I have learned and how it works. You sometimes have this conversation; Who is supposed to make the change? Is it the consumers? Is it the politicians? Is it the brands? Who has the responsibility? I think that is such a stupid conversation because obviously, we all have to change! The answer is manifold. There is a need for a business model that allows brands to be seasonless. That is currently not possible. We were set up to be seasonless from the beginning. However, we realized that it was impossible, or close to impossible, in the way retail is set up, and if you want to work with stores. There is a need for structural innovation that makes it possible to work in a different way.\n\nâ\n\n\"I honestly feel that if we aren't working on a better solution, we should probably shut down as an industry. In my personal opinion, I don't think there is a right to continue to exist if we don't ambitiously work in better ways. \"\n\nâ\n\nWe need new business innovation more than guilt. Obviously, if you have a way of doing it, more people would. Right now, it's a shaming game. You shouldn't continue having collections and seasons, and brands are like: \"So how are we going to survive?\". I honestly feel that if we aren't working on a better solution, we should probably shut down as an industry. In my personal opinion, I don't think there is a right to continue to exist if we don't ambitiously work in better ways.\n\nThere is a little bit of time, but not a lot. We should spend that time figuring out how we can use real creativity to create change. Creativity in fashion today is as much about the model as the expression of the garment. There probably isn't a piece of clothing that we haven't seen before somehow. Where fashion is really strong, and the reason why it makes sense to not just kill it is that it can be a powerful way to communicate movements in society, identity, and expressionâthat's when it becomes progressive. I think that what we have seen for many years is a regressive industry. It's been about clothes and not so much about what is going on in the world. It's been pretty disconnected from the fact that the planet is falling apart and that people are not getting paid. If we do not change that or start working with it, then the industry simply shouldn't exist.\n\nSomething that is really on my mind right now, particularly right now, is that there is such a huge need to deconstruct, and there is also a lot of anger that makes sense, but we also need to reconstruct. That inspires me as a creative thinking person. It's much more the construction than the deconstruction.\n\nâ\n\n\"At Carcel, we believe it's less about the \"need\" and more about creating the \"want\" to change. Talking to the \"want\" will make it possible to transition humanity to the post-consumer era, the next perception of beauty.\"\n\nâ\n\nCarcel has always been about a desire to create a movement that people want to be part of. That's also why the clothes need to be beautiful and attractive, and the brand needs to look cool. We want to create an emotional space, which is not a rational argument. We're getting told so many things from a rational point of view ... \"did you know that...\" and then we are supposed to change behavior, but we don't want to do that.Â\n\nAt Carcel, we believe it's less about the \"need\" and more about creating the \"want\" to change. Talking to the \"want\" will make it possible to transition humanity to the post-consumer era, the next perception of beauty. We need to transition to somewhere and not just say: \"everything is shit,\" \"capitalism is shit,\" \"politics is shit,\" \"the climate is shit\" that creates apathy. I think that's what we all feel. This feeling of \"I don't know what to do about it\" and \"I can't think about it too much because nothing is good; we shouldn't even be breathing; there are already too many people on the planet, my phone is made by I don't want to know who, and the Internet is using too much CO2\"âit's never-ending. What we actually need is human beings to feel agency to create change and drive that change. We can only do that through creating a \"want\" and \"desire\" to change.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat are some of the challenges you experience because of the way you do business? When we met you outside of the shop during the Corona lockdown, you mentioned that social media can be harsh and challenging at times?\n\nWhen you talk about thingsâit's like at a dinner partyâif you bring up intimate and personal stuff, people will comment on it. You need to make a choice. You can't both share everything and then get frustrated when people have opinions about it. For us, part of being progressive is also to be transparent. To allow people to make their own choices and give information about everythingâthe production cost, labor costs, the materials, the business modelâall of it.Â\n\nHowever, the most challenging with our brand is that we are operating within a system, which is a prison system. We are doing that in order to create an impact for people who basically have close to no opportunities, but it's also a complicated situation.Â\n\nIt's a really emotional conversation. Particularly in the US, where there is a horrible past and present of putting people in prison because of race and private companies exploiting prisoners as free labor. But it's not just in the States; exploitation of prisoners is taking place globally. Obviously, that is what we are trying to change by creating a different model based on fair living wages, code of conduct, and protection of prisoners' employment rights in order to create rehabilitation. But there are not a lot of great examples to lean against.\n\nWe realized this when we had a social media backlash in 2019, which came as a big surprise. Until then, we had been in the media a lot, but only with positive stories. It was a big debate about what we are doing as equal to modern slavery. People on Reddit wrote that we were white supremacists that wanted to exploit poor women of color. It was a huge challenge to communicate how complex this topic is in only a few sentences.Â\n\nStill, at the end of the day, it also motivated us to pick up the phone and call everyone we could find on this planet in order to talk about this and the different aspects of prison labor. We contacted people from the UNODC who are working with prisons, the ILO (International Labour Organization), and the American Prison Association, amongst others. There is a global framework that everyone has agreed to, and it's called The Nelson Mandela Rules, which are basic human rights for people incarcerated. It's a human right to have access to a job in prison if the job is fairly compensated and voluntary.Â\n\nHowever, there are no guidelines to ensure that a prison job is fairly compensated and voluntary. What we realized was that the reason people reacted was that this is not the norm. The norm, across the globe, is that companies are exploiting incarcerated people and that they don't have any rights. This is what people know. It's so brutal and crazy. So it makes sense to doubt our little company, to be critical towards our intentions and demand answers.\n\nâ\n\nFor us, this was a wake-up call. We needed to bring in people, and we needed someone who could check on our practices. We asked ourselves: Is there an NGO? Is there a union we can engage with? Is there someone we can look into to improve ourselves, and who can help us find out what we are doing well and where we can do better? But we couldn't find anyone specialized in ethical employment rights for prisoners. In general, there is very little research globally around the topic of work and incarceration. Because of that, we started creating a draft of the first global 'Code of Conduct for Protecting Prisoner's Working Rights' because we needed it ourselves, and we thought it might be useful for others.Â\n\nWe got advisors from different fields, from the UN, from the ILO, from the unions, and asked them to look into this. We started working with a consultant, Luke Smitham, from Kumi Consulting in London, who has in-depth experience working with extremely vulnerable supply chains like mining, places where there are child labor, and risk of exploitation, which can be the case when you're incarcerated. We asked ourselves: How can we create a codex and different steps of implementation that protect prisoners' rights?\n\nWe were invited to speak at The OECD Annual Garment & Footwear Meeting in Paris, where guides for responsible business conduct are discussed within the fashion industry. We invited all the unions we could find, governments, NGOs, not to say: \"Listen, Carcel is a great idea\" but to say ... \"Listen, there is an issue here; we have a global population, who is currently working, and no one is upholding their rights. These are some of the thoughts and things we have learned ... We then made a roll-out plan, but are delayed due to COVID-19. Our goal is to both create a case with implementation research and work to lobby for global attention to this group of people. However, this is just to say that we are also very engaged on a political level to actually be part of progress, but within a broken system.Â\n\nThat doesn't mean that we are for or against prisons. I think that's what people sometimes misunderstand. If you work with a prison, then you are pro prisons. That is not how we feel. But, what we do think is that a large group of people in prisons are being forgotten about who deserves a chance to be included as capable humans beings.\n\nâ\n\n\"I like constructive criticism, it allows us to have so many meaningful conversations, and it gives us something to work with.\"\n\nâ\n\nFor us, the most important thing is to hear what the women want and what matters to them. They say that having a job is essential for them in order to be able to contribute to their families and to have their dignity back. They are so proud to be a part of this, and it means a lot to them.Â\n\nObviously, you get in doubt when you experience a backlash like that, but I think that is a healthy thing. We should always get in doubt when we are critiqued. I like constructive criticism, it allows us to have so many meaningful conversations, and it gives us something to work with.Â\n\nCompared to Ruby Cup, this has been extremely challenging. Ruby Cup had a straightforward vision. Who doesn't want to keep girls in school? We can all agree that it is not a political topic. Labor in prisons is a political topic. Some people think that prisoners are criminals and don't deserve the right to work and shouldn't get a job. Others believe that prisons are evil and shouldn't existâif you even engage with the people there, you support prisons' existence. There are a lot of different aspects to it.Â\n\nI think communication is essential, and that's something we are working on right now. From the outside, you could get the ideaâif you don't know usâthat we are this huge, wealthy company that has set up production in prisons to exploit cheap labor. However, when you meet us and sit here, you realize that we are 2 1/2 employees and underfunded (ha-ha). We've got so much positive exposure that people sometimes think we are a much larger company. It's not that I'm not proud of the brand, but it's easy for people to think that we are super wealthy, but that's not really how it is at all! That's also why transparency is so important to us. We want to make sure that people understand that everything made on the products is reinvested into the business. No one is exploiting profit from this. ââ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat are you working on right now?\n\nRight now, we are working on a new way to be in retail that eliminates stock and wasteâthat is the core focus.Â\n\nWe are also working on creating a production facility outside of prison in Thailandâeven though we can't go there, so the women who are released can still work together with us if they would like to. We have four women from our team coming out next year. Last week, we learned that they have gotten amnesty, which is many years off their sentences. We are planning for it and also planning to do it in the right way. Corona has speeded things up in some ways, but in other ways, it has also been, \"Okay, let's wait a few months more and do it well and hopefully go there and be a part of the process.\"Â\n\nRight now, we are also in the exploration phase on how to make our own silk. We probably want to set up a weaving mill outside of prison. Also, there is a lot of natural dye in Thailand. We are thinking in the outside space in terms of different types of craftsmanship that we can use for different projects and products.\n\nOh, and one of the important outcomes of Corona, which I didn't mention before, is that when you have a humanitarian crisis and a global pandemic like this, overpopulated prisons start to release people before time. We actually just had a woman released who was supposed to stay there for 5-6 years more. As a result, we have started a small production outside of the prison in Peru, with our first employee called Vanessa. During the pandemic where everything was shut down, and we couldn't rent anything, somehow, we managed, and she managed.Â\n\nThis was ahead of time. It has always been something that we wanted to do, but we thought that most of the women had so many years left that we would wait and do things in a different order. All of a sudden, it was like: Okay, she is out. How do we get a machine? How do we get started? We feel really lucky and fortunate to have her on our team, our first employee, on the outside!\n\nââ\n\nDoes the work the women do for Carcel have anything to do with them being released ahead of time?\n\nOfficially, no. Unofficially, it's different from country to country. If you don't have a hard sentence in Peru, it diminishes your time if you work. But if you are in for a hard sentence, like drug trafficking, it doesn't affect your sentence. But your papers, good behavior, and recommendations do. In that sense, everyone in the prisons can see that it's a really positive system. The prison director in Peru wants us to employ everyone because it changes a lot. She says there are an entirely different energy and positivity among these women. Their goal is to get as many women into the Carcel project as possible because it leaves them with some kind of prospect and creates a positive culture. The same in Thailand.\n\nâ\n\nDoes it give the women hope for a better future?\n\nIt is always hard to speak on behalf of someone else, but it is also very difficult not to say that it gives them hope because they can't call you up or be here for this interview and answer themselves.\n\nâ\n\n\"Whenever there is a bleak day, a shutdown, or business challenges, I always think about our teams in prison. They are incredibly positive and extremely powerfulâthey really want this!\"\n\nâ\n\nWhenever there is a bleak day, a shutdown, or business challenges, I always think about our teams in prison. They are incredibly positive and extremely powerfulâthey really want this! I may think that life is a little bit hard and that it's challenging to be an entrepreneur sometimes, but their energy motivates me. They are so proud whenever they see their work in magazines or when someone writes an article about us. For them, it's a cultural acceptanceâeven though they are prisoners, which is such a cultural, social stigma.Â\n\nOne of our women in Thailand said that she thought she was cabbage, which translates to feeling like garbage in Thai, but now she feels that she is a valuable human being. Being incarcerated is so full of shame for these women. We can't possibly understand or relate, but we can listen and try to create ways for the women to be heard and act.\n\nWe had the princess of Thailand visit our production facility; she is the UN goodwill ambassador for female prisoners' rights. She came to visit our project. It was such an incredible experience for them to get to show her their work and give her a present that they made themselves. That is basically the highest level of acceptance they can think of; how can we make something for a princess when we are not supposed to be anything?\n\nâ\n\nHow will you look back at 2020, and what are your hopes for 2021?Â\n\nYou know, I was always sad that I wasn't born in the 60s. Back then, conversations were about somethingâat least that was how I felt growing up in the 80s and 90s. I felt that I grew up in a very shallow time. With really shallow musicâa lot of itâvery bad dance music. Of course, there was some good music, but most of it, like mainstream music, was horrible in the 90s. It was reflected in design as well; everything reflected this shallow wealth era. I think that the conversations were like that as well. People were not going into deep topics, and if you did, it was the \"political\" conversation.\n\nâ\n\n\"You know, I was always sad that I wasn't born in the 60s. Back then, conversations were about somethingâat least that was how I felt growing up in the 80s and 90s.\"\n\nâ\n\nIn the 60s, things were about something, and things changed. They were also painful and cost lives, but stuff got done; the mass movement for civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, and a lot of other things that are fundamental for how we even think today. I hope that what we are going through in 2020 and hopefully also in 2021 and 2022 is about that. So that the chaos, the pain, and the change are what's necessary in order for us not to have a planet that is heated by more than 2 degrees in the best-case scenario. We will know that within 7-10 years. That's the time frame we have. We need chaos. We need radical transformation. We need either a complete breakdown or a really fast revolution. I'm hoping for the last. But if not, then we need to break down. That is what I hope to look back on this year, but also in the years to come â that it's not just another year. My nightmare would be that we end 2020 or start 2021, and everything is back to normal like it was at the beginning of 2020. Then I would feel really sad. But I don't think that is going to happen. Hopefully, 2020 brings a lot of positive change.\n\nâ\n\n\"We need chaos. We need radical transformation. We need either a complete breakdown or a really fast revolution. I'm hoping for the last. But if not, then we need to break down.\"\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWhat does the future look like? Where do you find your inspiration for the further development of Carcel?\n\nCarcel has always been a very collaborative project. The fact that we were started with a Kickstarter campaign and everyone in Denmark who worked at Carcel worked for free for the first two years, made everyone involved, from interns to the women in the prisons, part of shaping the company. That's also pretty much how it is today. We are a few people who are getting paid nowâa little bitâbut I think the inspiration and the ideas always come from a collective. We meet new people along the way, and they become part of the journey, in everything from our design processes to strengthening our ties in Peru and Thailand.\n\nâ\n\n\"We want to build something bigger than Carcel. That's the dream. Carcel can hopefully be a catalyst for change, and that change can then be a platform for other people to engage.\"\n\nâ\n\nWe set things up in a way that'll hopefully allow our facilities to be its own function run by the women, where they can have other clients and customers. We want to build something bigger than Carcel. That's the dream. Carcel can hopefully be a catalyst for change, and that change can then be a platform for other people to engage.Â\n\nI hope that it will be a continuity of a collective and collaborations with a lot of people who can chip in and who can participate. In the world I think we should live in, it's never about ownership. We need as many people to get involved as possible to at least try to address some of the things that we have been talking about.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAnything we missed you'd like to add?Â Â\n\nNot other than, I think it's a really exciting time. It's nice to think about the fact that we are not alone. I don't think we are a hero company leading the wave. There is a massive movement going on right now, and we can all learn from each other. There's also a new generation who is not stuck up in whether it's \"do good\" or \"fashion,\" is it \"business?\" or is it an \"NGO?\" The young generation sees the world much more connected. It doesn't have to be either-or, and I think looking at the world like that makes a lot more sense. We are moving in the right direction. It's not a conversation on whether we should have sustainability anymore. I'm not concerned if we had the time. If we had 40-50 years, we would definitely get there. My concern is the timeframe that we have if we want a habitable planet for the number of people we are today. We have to do whatever we can to speed up the processâand sometimes that might be inappropriate and not wanted conversations.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nVERONICA D'SOUZA\n\nVeronica is a passionated, business-savvy, social entrepreneur by heart.

In the coming months, she will be creating content for the LULUâLAND Journal and Instagram.\n\nRoxy is an incredible writer, with her characteristic personal style; she makes people reflect and laugh. Don't be surprised if you suddenly find a Harry Potter reference in her writing on just about anything.\n\nRoxy is one of the most diehard BeyoncÃ© fans we've ever met, and she loves everything that involves performing, acting, and dancing.

Hanging out in the bathroomwith candles is definitely one thing.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMOSTÂ OFÂ USÂ HAVEÂ CERTAINÂ ROUTINES, LET'S GETÂ TOÂ KNOWÂ YOURS\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the first thing you do in the morning?\n\nLately, Iâve created the habit that the first thing I do is taking a few conscious breaths and speaking out what Iâm grateful for. Iâd lie if I said that I see the effects very obviously, but I fully believe that itâs much more about long-term joy than the usual instant gratification stuff we do. But the first more active thing I do is wash my face with cold water. Several splashes. I just wouldnât be a person without doing that.\n\nâ\n\n\"I do my best to roll out of bed and onto my yoga mat or into a meditation. But then thereâs those other days when I end up browsing through clothes instead and being late.\"\n\nâ\n\nâWhat is a typical day like for you?\n\nI do my best to roll out of bed and onto my yoga mat or into a meditation. But then thereâs those other days when I end up browsing through clothes instead and being late. Breakfast is a MUST, Iâm usually (almost) starving. A book usually keeps me company. After breaking into a dance or two, I go to work, though not the last three months when Iâve been working from home and I LOVE it (more yoga and me time, yes please!). I dedicate evenings to friends, cooking, working on acting pieces, writing, watching shows, thrift shopping, buying ice cream - you know, life essentials.\n\nâ\n\nAnd now that we're at it â what are the last things you do before bedtime?\n\nTea, though not as much during summer. Maybe yoga, shower, and more writing - recently started a gratitude journal where Iâm writing every single thing from the day that I feel grateful for - or something that I appreciate about myself. And watching my current show/reading my current book.\n\nâ\n\nHow do you spend your weekends?\n\nSleeping in is just my favourite. Not too crazy late, but late for most others Iâve heard. Breakfast in bed. Lazying around. Quality time with friends. More thrift shopping. Reading. Nature trips or city trips or trips to my candy shop.Â\n\nâ\n\n\"I fully believe that lifeâs a party.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhen was the last time you celebrated?\n\nI fully believe that lifeâs a party. I love celebrating being alive in any small ârandomâ moment, so itâs pretty tricky answering this question. But it was my bday recently and that was a 2in1 celebration because I saw some friends for the first time in a few months.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWEÂ ALLÂ HAVEÂ MOREÂ ORÂ LESSÂ FLATTERINGÂ TRAITS\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is your guilty pleasure?\n\nWhenever I get suddenly and temporarily obsessed with pop celebrities and I end up watching their interviews/videos late into the night. Shoutout to Ariana Grande, my latest binge.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is your superpower?\n\nSeeing through people. I donât need to know things about others to see them for who they really are.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAÂ LITTLEÂ BITÂ ABOUTÂ PASSION, NOTÂ THEÂ FRUIT\n\nÂ\n\nWhat could you spend all day talking about?\n\nBeyoncÃ©, self-development practices, healthy habits, food, movies, actors, books.\n\nÂ\n\nWhat inspires you?\n\nVirtually any form of art, but specifically music, films/theatre, books, paintings and ancient sculptures. I also find infinite inspiration in things that appear to be common, but arenât, like the movement of leaves or the look in a babyâs eyes.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nLET'S DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO WHAT INSPIRES YOU\n\nÂ\n\nRepeat or shuffle? What have you been listening to lately, and what are you humming in the shower?\n\nRepeat AND shuffle. Lately Iâve been digging more into grime, itâs really helped me process some powerful emotions that have been surfacing - Skepta is such a king and the genre is mad good. Neo-soul always - Erykah Badu is a daily mantra. Also some badass female rappers - Nicki, though mainly Leikeli47 right now. A song that I canât stop playing is the remix Megan Thee Stallion did with BeyoncÃ© - âSavageâ. In the mornings/evenings I mix it up with ancient Japanese meditation music or Indian classical, sometimes Ludovico Einaudi who is a master of my heart and my favorite classical musician.\n\nâ\n\nPoster or collectorsâ items? If we gave you a million, what would be decorating your walls?\n\nIâd definitely buy a few authentic Greek/Roman sculptures, or maybe I wouldnât afford more than two with that money. Iâd love to get original artwork by Ivan Alifan, Mikael Owunna, Anne Barlinckhoff just to name a few.\n\nâ\n\nNewspapers, journals, magazines, online platforms, digital media, podcastsâ¦ you name it â how do you keep yourself updated, and what are your news sources?\n\nAl-Jazeera is a newssource I admire and trust most, The Guardian is also great. A magazine Iâve started collecting is 32C, everything they do is just *goals*.\n\nâ\n\nIf you could have lunch with one person, alive or dead, who would that be?\n\nBeyoncÃ© - both a hard and easy question.Â\n\nâ\n\nBooks, movies, and/or series â what can you recommend?\n\nThe books of my young womanhood are The Neapolitan Quartet by Elena Ferrante, she is unbelievable and so are these novels, though theyâre brutally real at the same time. There are four books spread over a few decades, about an epic friendship between two women against the heavy backdrop of a very poor neighborhood in Naples, Italy. Recently I read âGirl, Woman, Otherâ by Bernadine Evaristo, just the most unique style and extremely powerful voice for both black culture, women and the LGBTQ community.\n\nSome of my favourite movies that everyone just needs to watch are Call me by your name, Parasite, Joker and Mommy.\n\nThese days Iâm obsessed with the TV-show âInsecureâ, a hilarious and very insightful comedy/drama sitcom about black women (and occasionally men), by black women, and for anyone to enjoy to the max. Other all-time favorites are Better Call Saul (a masterpiece) and The Office (US) is by far the most epic comedy material ever. Â\n\nâ\n\nWhich three Instagram accounts should everyone follow?\n\n@annebarlinckhoff - my new love in photography\n\n@youvegotnomale - super mega witty and pro-all-freedom meme genius Sebastian Tribbie\n\n@indyamoore - my favourite actress from the show POSE and such a fierce representative of the trans community.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nYOURÂ LIFEÂ SOÂ FAR: SMOOTHÂ SAILINGÂ ORÂ OBSTACLEÂ COURSE â A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PAST\n\nÂ\n\nWho was your first big love?\n\nCan I answer BeyoncÃ© here as well? Kidding (not entirely). It was my first proper boyfriend when I was living in Romania. I was 15 and crazy in love.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat's the single best realization you have ever had?\n\nThat everything significant we feel can be traced back to our childhoods, and healed the same way.\n\nâ\n\nWhat's the best bad or crazy decision you have ever made? That moment that seemed so wrong but turned out so right. If you don't make bad or crazy decisions, have you then ever made a decision that changed your entire life?\n\nOne (most) glorious summer back in university, when my best friend and I decided we needed to live in Greece. We found jobs online, weâd be working at the same bar, and even though it seemed alright, there was next to no security about it. I had to travel alone for the first time, sleeping in the airport waiting for the ferry, and moving to an island all by myself. My best friend joined only later. It was the single most defining experience, not only in terms of freedom and pure joy, but more significantly in terms of the unknown and the kindness of strangers.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAND A LOT MORE ABOUT THE PRESENT\n\nâ\n\n\"I am truly enjoying and appreciating all the heavy emotional processes Iâve had come at me lately. True change, healthy change, necessary change.\"\n\nâ\n\nHow are you, really? It's nice to check in every once in a while.Â\n\nI love this question, and love asking myself this in meditation too - so important. Itâs been a very intense time but I am truly enjoying and appreciating all the heavy emotional processes Iâve had come at me lately. True change, healthy change, necessary change.\n\nâ\n\nWhen are you the happiest?Â\n\nWhenI'm performing on stage/in front of the camera. When I take the first swim of summer. When I kiss my boyfriend. When I eat delicious foods. When Iâm inItaly. When I eat gelato. Pay me and I still wouldn't be able to choose only one.\n\nââ\n\nWhat scares you the most?\n\nThe thought of serious illness ...Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat keeps you up at night these days?\n\nThe show Iâm watching (Insecure) cuz itâs perfect and addictive. And the long summer nights of bliss.\n\nÂ\n\nTell us one thing people would never know about you by just looking at you?\n\nThat I can be as introverted as I am extroverted.\n\nâ\n\nWhat habit would improve your life?\n\nMore exercise (duh). Gotta say that I am at least trying, honestly.\n\nâ\n\nWe all have qualities that don't really have any rhyme or reason. What is one thing you don't understand about yourself?Â\n\nItâs a long time ago now that I gave up understanding the self. Itâs such a paradox, because life is synonymous with experience and so are we. So I experience it all, instead of understanding. But a thing that frustrates me sometimes, is the laziness/procrastination I notice I fall into even though I know my passions and what I need to do for them.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat works for you at the moment, and what doesnât?\n\nI have a lot more time to myself and my career paths, and thatâs so necessary right now when Iâm juggling different things. My late sleeping schedule isnât the best though so Iâm working on improving that.Â\n\nâ\n\nWhen do you feel the most comfortable in your own skin?\n\nWhen I dance my booty off and whenever I put my outfits together.\n\nâ\n\nWhat makes you feel insecure?\n\nBoth the acting and the creative industry, when thinking about them as big monsters that I canât conquer. And the eternal problem of comparing myself to others, which is still a work in progress.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAND OF COURSE, AÂ SNEAK PEEK INTOÂ THE FUTURE\n\nÂ â\n\nWhat's the best thing about the next thing you are during?\n\nThat Iâm finally taking some real action towards my next career move, and LULUâLAND itself is the catalyst for it. And my next career move means to design my own life in the creative industry. The same goes for my acting career, that I feel real badass determination for my next steps.\n\nâ\n\n\"When it comes to writing, Iâm slowly paving my way for what I imagine being a fabulous freelance career.\"\n\nâ\n\n\"Plans are worthlessâ but planning is everything\"Â â Dwight D. Eisenhower. What does the future look like for you â what are your dreams and goals?\n\nI was born to be a mother in every sense of the word, and more so than many girlfriends I have, so a family is something that I am dying for. When it comes to acting, Iâve decided that I will get an agent by the end of the year. When it comes to writing, Iâm slowly paving my way for what I imagine being a fabulous freelance career.Â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nADVICE â EASY TO GIVE, HADER TO FOLLOW\n\nâ\n\nâWhat (or who) motivates you in difficult times?Â\n\nMy boyfriend and my closest girlfriends are the best supporters. And I mean it when I say this, BeyoncÃ© too. She has helped me in some of the toughest times. Her godly power and monster work ethic can drive me forward.\n\nâ\n\nGood advice is priceless. What is the best piece of advice youâve ever gotten?\n\nJust anything that ever came out of Eckhart Tolleâs mouth. He is my forever greatest spiritual teacher. To paraphrase maybe the biggest thing, and the core of his teachings, is that our true joy and peace depends on always distinguishing between what is/what the mind says about it. Itâs also the root of all suffering, and of living a life lost in thought. Itâs the foundation of perspective and of true acceptance of even the âworstâ thing.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the kindest thing anyone ever said to you or the best compliment anyone ever gave you?Â\n\nThat I spread light to everyone around me.â\n\nâ\n\n\"I donât believe in heartbreak - there is pain, and grief, and they are natural.\"\n\nâ\n\nHow do you heal a broken heart?\n\nI donât believe in heartbreak - there is pain, and grief, and they are natural. The only way is through.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE FORECAST â TRENDS AND TENDENCIES\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is going to be the next big thing? (concepts, businesses, ideas, mega trends, etc.)\n\nCanât help thinking of fashion, and you know this new trend of wearing sport shorts over pants when working out? I predict that the next step will be wearing that outfit to go out, to restaurants or other regular walks of life. And it will develop to all kinds of combinations of shorts/long pants. Iâd literally die laughing if that ever happened.\n\nBut on a more serious note, I actually fear a future when the much-explored concept of self-love as we see it now, will develop so much that it will turn into a whole industry and my fear is that it will be so monetized that it will cease to serve its real purpose.\n\nâ\n\nWe would love to find out about cool new places and things to do in your area. What are your favorite places? Where do you like to go to have fun?Â\n\nI live in the real heart of MalmÃ¶, a neighborhood called MÃ¶llan. I live next to a park (Folketspark) where Iâm sure any kid would want to permanently move into, but this park also has perks for adults too - my absolute favourite summer bar is right in the middle of the park, and itâs called Far i Hatten. Itâs THE must-do here during summer, Iâm so in love with it forever and ever. I also adore what is by now the best falafel spot in town, and itâs right around the corner from me - Mr. Falafel (SO LUCKY).. The beach is also so much fun, especially for magical sunsets.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE ONES THAT DIDN'T FIT INTO THE OTHER CATEGORIES\n\nâ\n\n\"My favorite object is my projector. Straight-up my most valuable possession in every sense of the word.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the most favorite, most useful, and most useless object you own, respectively?\n\nMy favorite object is my projector. Straight-up my most valuable possession in every sense of the word. I really do have a mini-cinema in my living room andIâd never go back to a TV.\n\nMost useful - my electric toothbrush because hello, brushing teeth, but also because it completely changed the whole game. Itâs not the typical round one that you see everywhere (those suck), but a normal shape (from Philips). Weâre close friends by now.\n\nMost useless - Hair rollers that I bought a million years ago and still havenât touched.\n\nWhat was the last thing you searched for on your phone? Be careful: you might be required to show proof.Â\n\nHair rollers. Had to make sure it was the correct word (even though I knew it was hehehe).\n\nâ\n\nCall or text?

Don't hesitate to reach out to her if you would like to hear more about her work.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nOK, LET'S START WITHÂ THEÂ EASYÂ ONES\n\nâ\n\nName:\n\nStephanie Geddes\n\nâ\n\nBirth month/year:\n\n4 April, 1984\n\nâ\n\nNationality:\n\nAustralian\n\nâ\n\nCurrently located in:\n\nCopenhagen\n\nâ\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nIâm a freelance photographer and general all-round creative in the fields of production, producing, and problem-solving!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMOSTÂ OFÂ USÂ HAVEÂ CERTAINÂ ROUTINES, LET'S GETÂ TOÂ KNOWÂ YOURS\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the first thing you do in the morning?\n\nSince moving to Denmark, I open the blinds and pray for sunshine. Then I check my phone - definitely a habit Iâm trying to break, but I canât help it. Then itâs onto breakfast and a caffeinated beverage!\n\nâ\n\n\"As a relatively new to Copenhagen creative Iâve still very much hustling hard to get my foot in the door and meet as many new people as possible.\"\n\nâ\n\nâWhat is a typical day like for you?\n\nThere really isnât a typical day, which is a blessing and a curse. As a relatively new to Copenhagen creative, Iâve still very much hustling hard to get my foot in the door and meet as many new people as possible. My day can consist of meetings, research, a photoshoot, location scouting, or emails (and more emails).\n\nâ\n\nAnd now that we're at it â what are the last things you do before bedtime?\n\nPut my phone on silent, arrange my pillows into a weirdly specific pile and shape ideal for sleep, and then read a book until I fall asleep. Iâm not a great sleeper, so I go through a lot of books!Â\n\nâ\n\nHow do you spend your weekends?\n\nMy husband works Monday - Friday so despite being freelance myself I like to try to stick to a similar schedule, then we have our weekends together which usually start with eggs of some sort - weâre currently perfecting our homemade breakfast burritos, then bike rides, walks through Assistens Kirkegard, dinner at our local Greek restaurant, Taverna Kreta and if Iâm honest the occasional Netflix marathon.\n\nÂ\n\nWhen was the last time you celebrated?\n\nIâm actually not sure (which I admit doesnât sound great). I do try to celebrate little things, but theyâre never really about myself! The last mini-celebration dinner we had was the first time restaurants opened after COVID - it was lovely to visit our favorite local place and support it after such a long time.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWEÂ ALLÂ HAVEÂ MOREÂ ORÂ LESSÂ FLATTERINGÂ TRAITS\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is your guilty pleasure?\n\nCaffeine and wine, and since moving to Copenhagen - pick and mix candy shops. Being able to pick out a whole bag of only red and purple gummies is a dream.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is your superpower?\n\nEmpathizing with other people - and remaining calm in a crisis (I'll freak out and replay it over and over again afterward though).\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAÂ LITTLEÂ BITÂ ABOUTÂ PASSION, NOTÂ THEÂ FRUIT\n\nÂ\n\nWhat could you spend all day talking about?\n\nPhotography, art, and the current state of the world - pondering how itâs possible to course correct the path weâve found ourselves on. And if weâre being our truest selves, you can get me talking for hours about true crime (Iâm not proud, but itâs a strong side interest - Iâm not a weirdo I swear).\n\nâÂ\n\nWhat inspires you?\n\nBeautiful art in all forms, but of course, photography. Dance always inspires me, watching dance and also dancing myself. Iâm not good, but it brings me so much joy. I also love chatting with people who have drastically changed career/life paths - tell me your stories!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nLET'S DIG A LITTLE DEEPER INTO WHAT INSPIRES YOU\n\nÂ\n\nRepeat or shuffle? What have you been listening to lately, and what are you humming in the shower?\n\nRepeat repeat repeat. I will listen to a song or playlist over and over depending on what mood Iâm in, and I have multiple playlists that suit different chores or times of day (my cleaning playlist is on point). Current repeated songs include âA Paleâ by Rosalia, âRide Itâ by Regard, and all songs by the angel Chet Baker.\n\nâ\n\nPoster or collectorsâ items? If we gave you a million, what would be decorating your walls?\n\nA mix of prints, paintings, and photographs - my sister Kelly Geddes is a very talented photographer and makes beautiful handprints. There is an amazing initiative in Copenhagen called KunstSalonen that curates an art show every couple of months (in normal times), and the work is always so diverse and a great mix of affordable and aspirational pieces - I would probably stop by and take my pick! I would also buy vintage prints from the late Francesca WoodmanÂ - the most beautiful photographer and the woman who inspired me in my work from a young age.\n\nÂ\n\nNewspapers, journals, magazines, online platforms, digital media, podcastsâ¦ you name it â how do you keep yourself updated, and what are your news sources?\n\nMy New York Times subscription keeps me in the loop, as well as their âThe Dailyâ podcast - for my local news in English, I read the aptly titled âThe Local.â A lot of my personal inspiration and finding of new artwork and people comes through Instagram, I love to see what my fellow local photographers are sharing and creating - Mia Jorgensen, Josephine Al Humaidan and Petra Kleis are all amazing and talented women. Podcasts are almost always playing in my ears when I leave the house - a few favorites; This American Life, Coping in Copenhagen, Real Crime Profile, Crime Junkie, and Someone Knows Something (a theme is emerging with those last few).\n\nâÂ\n\n\"Iâm very lucky to have such a wonderful family, and despite nobody being able to frustrate me in the same way, nobody can make me laugh as hard.\"\n\nâ\n\nIf you could have lunch with one person, alive or dead, who would that be?\n\nCan I combine 3 people into 1? My parents and my sister, we all live in different countries, and so we donât see each other as often as weâd like, and may not for a while in the future depending on how travel pans out. Iâm very lucky to have such a wonderful family, and despite nobody being able to frustrate me in the same way, nobody can make me laugh as hard. Give us some wine and access to Spotify, and by the end of the night, a sing-a-long of Queen, Elton John, and George Michael will 100% be happening.\n\nÂ\n\nBooks, movies, and/or series â what can you recommend?\n\nâ\n\nBooks: âThe Lovely Bonesâ by Alice Sebold, âHouse of Leavesâ by Mark Z. Danielewski, âThe Roadâ by Cormac McCarthy and âBird Boxâ by Josh Malerman are all favorites of mine (donât let the shitty Netflix movie turn you off Bird Box - the book is great). I love anything that lets my mind take a break - despite being recommended a million âhelpâ books I just canât get past the first chapters. My brain does enough âinward reflection aka anxiety spiralsâ on itâs own.\n\nâ\n\nSeries: âKilling Eveâ and âFleaBagâ - if you havenât watched them Iâm not sure we can be friends. I could also literally watch âLaw and Order SVUâ any time, all the time.\n\nÂ\n\nWhich three Instagram accounts should everyone follow?\n\nFor ultimate visual inspiration, Iâm loving @celine and @jilsander - and as a left field third option @madmax_fluffyroad (Iâm not proud but itâs cute).\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nYOURÂ LIFEÂ SOÂ FAR: SMOOTHÂ SAILINGÂ ORÂ OBSTACLEÂ COURSE â A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PAST\n\nÂ\n\nWho was your first big love?\n\nIn order to not overshare, Iâm going with Pacey from Dawsons Creek.\n\nÂ\n\nWhat's the single best realization you have ever had?\n\nThat Iâm the only person who can make things happen for myself - itâs something that took me a shockingly long time to fully realize and something that I can slack on, but itâs the truth. Family, friends, mentors, colleagues, etc. can all help, but you are the one that has to put in the work, ask for what you need and put yourself out there. It can be frustrating and defeating, especially in a creative field like photography, but Iâm determined!\n\nâ\n\n\"When we got the opportunity to transfer to Denmark with my husband for his job my initial reaction was âhell noâ.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat's the best bad or crazy decision you have ever made? That moment that seemed so wrong but turned out so right. If you don't make bad or crazy decisions, have you then ever made a decision that changed your entire life?\n\nMoving to Denmark! Not a âcrazy or badâ decision per se, just something that was hard and exciting and completely new. When we got the opportunity to transfer to Denmark with my husband for his job, my initial reaction was âhell no.â We had just spent over a year getting my green card paperwork sorted for me to finally be able to work as a freelancer in America and it seemed like all that work was now for nothing, but after the initial reaction and shock wore off, it became an exciting new adventure and something that Chris and I would get to take on together. We would be insane not to take the chance to live together in Scandinavia! Making the move last year was a really tough few months, and coming to a new country with a new language and no network expanded my brain in new ways - it was ... an experience, but we did it! Despite it still being a little challenging to make friends, I genuinely love it here!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAND A LOT MORE ABOUT THE PRESENT\n\nâ\n\nHow are you, really? It's nice to check in every once in a while.Â\n\nOverall, Iâm good! Made it through the past couple of months, which (as they were for everyone) super tough and really uncertain. I spent a lot of time questioning my career and what it might look like moving forward. But as things begin to open up again, and the days are longer, Iâm meeting new people and starting to get my creative brain back into gear.\n\nâ\n\nWhen are you the happiest?Â\n\nWhen Iâm on set shooting and collaborating with a team - itâs the time I feel most like myself and capable, productive, and creative all at the same time. I am also my happiest walking through the park and pointing at all the flowers I like, and always when sipping on a glass of wine - wait, also when Iâm dancing!\n\nÂ\n\n\"I try not to let fear control me but sometimes itâs hard not to!\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat scares you the most?\n\nNot fulfilling my personal career goals - I try not to let fear control me, but sometimes itâs hard not to! On the non-rational and less serious front, Iâm terrified of frogs.\n\nÂ\n\nWhat keeps you up at night these days?\n\nâThinking of new photography projects and how to get my work out there and meet more people - I think about this too often, my brain is always buzzing. Should I have just chosen a more stable profession, have I failed, have I made a mistake? Should I go to nursing school (the profession I see as truly noble and a genuine way to help others), but then practically, I am very squeamish about blood so it wouldnât work. The joys of taking a chance on a creative career!\n\nâÂ\n\nTell us one thing people would never know about you by just looking at you?\n\nThat Iâm a pretty serious introvert - I love being social and can chat with almost anyone, but I need a lot of alone time to recharge.\n\nâ\n\nWhat habit would improve your life?\n\nSo many habits I logically know would improve my life, but doing them is another thing! I think the simplest one that Iâm doing a lot more of now is making sure I get outside whenever the sun is shining - it vastly improves my mood and outlook and helps my brain open up to new ideas.\n\nâ\n\nWe all have qualities that don't really have any rhyme or reason. What is one thing you don't understand about yourself?Â\n\nThe fact that I can still be fearful and reluctant to do things I know will be good for me, or that Iâll enjoy.\n\nâÂ\n\nWhat works for you at the moment, and what doesnât?\n\nActively reaching out to people works, making mood boards, writing lists, getting outside, and taking a dance class! What doesnât work for me is staying inside all day and going down an Instagram spiral. I currently do a âhealthyâ mix of both things that work for me and those that donât!\n\nÂ\n\n\"I also feel my best after showering off a long day, and doing an extended skin care routine with a glass of pink wine and an ice cube (because Iâm classy like that).\"\n\nâ\n\nWhen do you feel the most comfortable in your own skin?\n\nWhen Iâve got on some of my favorites music, and Iâm dancing - or when Iâm in a dance class (back when we had those!). I also feel my best after showering off a long day and doing an extended skincare routine with a glass of pink wine and an ice cube (because Iâm classy like that). Any time Iâm wearing a robe is a good time.\n\nâ\n\nWhat makes you feel insecure?\n\nComparing myself to other people - especially other people doing the jobs or having the career that I would like for myself. This isnât an attractive quality, but I know Iâm not alone in feeling this way. Itâs something Iâm actively working on, and Iâm trying to use these peopleâs work as inspiration rather than a reason to feel âless than.â\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nAND OF COURSE, AÂ SNEAK PEEK INTOÂ THE FUTURE\n\nÂ â\n\nWhat's the best thing about the next thing you are during?\n\nThe best thing is being able to take photos with other humans! I have a couple of shoots lined up, and some creative ideas in the works. Putting those into practice will feel amazing.\n\nâ\n\n\"Plans are worthlessâ but planning is everything\"Â â Dwight D. Eisenhower. What does the future look like for you â what are your dreams and goals?\n\nBeing a full-time photographer here in Copenhagen - I dream of having a diverse and supportive network of friends and colleagues, as well as a team of creatives that inspire me and that I get to create work with. I dream of traveling more with my husband and exploring more of our new home. I also have a goal to learn Danish - my official lessons begin at the end of June! Being able to converse just a little bit more with my new Danish neighbors will make me feel so much more at home.\n\nÂ\n\nâ\n\nADVICE â EASY TO GIVE, HADER TO FOLLOW\n\nâ\n\n\"Stepping back and taking a moment to remember the âbig pictureâ and what I want for myself and my family motivates me and helps me get back on track when I feel overwhelmed with self-doubt or rejection.\"\n\nâ\n\nWhat (or who) motivates you in difficult times?Â\n\nStepping back and taking a moment to remember the âbig pictureâ and what I want for myself and my family motivates me and helps me get back on track when I feel overwhelmed with self-doubt or rejection. I also know that I respond well to a deadline - I will get shit done if you give me one!\n\nâ\n\nGood advice is priceless. What is the best piece of advice youâve ever gotten?\n\nSo much good advice and so much of it is not new, but it works. A few personal favorites:\n\nâ\n\n1) Make a list - when things get overwhelming, write down your thoughts to get them out of your head. I'm not a great writer, so a list of bullet points and things to do helps me a lot.\n\nâ\n\n2) Take the first step - even if its a super small one\n\nâ\n\n3) The classic \"this shall pass\" - this is really helpful to always remember, nothing is 'forever.'\n\nâ\n\n4) Ask for help - one of the lessons of growing up has been learning that nobody can read your mind. If you don't ask for help or for what you want, you will rarely get it.\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the kindest thing anyone ever said to you or the best compliment anyone ever gave you?Â\n\nThat Iâm a good listener - as an anxious person, Iâve learned that sometimes people just need an ear, someone to listen to them and not offer solutions or try to solve the issue. Iâll also always die of happiness to get a compliment on my work!\n\nââ\n\nHow do you heal a broken heart?\n\nI do not have the answer to this - I donât think you can ever really heal from it. But you can move onwards and upwards, and things will get a little less painful each day, month, year.\n\nÂ\n\nâ\n\nTHE FORECAST â TRENDS AND TENDENCIES\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is going to be the next big thing? (concepts, businesses, ideas, mega trends, etc.)\n\nSustainability in all its forms and across all levels of business and development. I also think micro-businesses and utilizing your local networks, teams, and resources, etc. will become more and more important - especially now as we canât travel but hopefully also after these pandemic times have passed. Brands, especially in fashion and marketing, often forget to hunt for talent in their own networks and cities.\n\nâ\n\nWe would love to find out about cool new places and things to do in your area. What are your favorite places? Where do you like to go to have fun?Â\n\nSince weâre all staycationing right now, some places I love in Copenhagen are Assistens KirkegÃ¥rd for quiet walks, DÃ¼rÃ¼m Symfoni for the best kebabs ever, Louisiana for inspiration and Colpo Grosso for amazing pizza.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE ONES THAT DIDN'T FIT INTO THE OTHER CATEGORIES\n\nâ\n\nWhat is the most favorite, most useful, and most useless object you own, respectively?\n\nMost favorite: There are a few items that I cherish and have traveled the world with me â¦ my wedding ring, my passport, my mother's necklace, notes from family and friends that I will always keep.\n\nMost useful: It's not cool, but my computer and phone. There is no escaping the amount of screen time I require to function in the world.\n\nMost useless: There were definitely more than a few items we shipped from NYC to Copenhagen that ended up being recycled or sold as soon as we unpacked them. Moving countries does make you realize how much useless crap you accumulate - never again!Â Â\n\nâ\n\nWhat was the last thing you searched for on your phone? Be careful: you might be required to show proof.Â\n\nI googled the perfect fit for Birkenstock's - not a sexy search but a practical one. I like to research things that are super obvious or very personal (like the fit of a shoe ... you know - stuff that you should be able to figure out yourself).\n\nâ\n\nCall or text? Which is better, and why?\n\n90% of the time, Iâm all about the text - itâs quick and to the point, and it eases my social anxiety to not have to talk on the phone. But there is a time and place for a phone call, and sometimes itâs just easier to talk it out.\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is your pet peeve?\n\nBeing late to me is the height of rudeness.\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is the most interesting thing in your trash can?\n\nâIâve literally never been asked this - looking into my trash can I guess I would have to say a watermelon rind? It was delicious and makes me feel like summer is here already.\n\nâÂ\n\nYouâve been given an elephant. You canât give it away or sell it. What would you do with it?\n\nDo I also have lots of money? I would buy it acres of land to roam free in and possibly some more elephants to keep it from being lonely.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE BIG ONES\n\nÂ\n\nWhat is the meaning of life?\n\nI donât think there is a meaning to life - which is liberating! You have to find joy and fulfillment in your own way. This is easier said than done and something Iâm striving for and working towards myself.\n\nâÂ\n\nLook, mom, I made it! â How do you define success?Â\n\nI donât think Iâm there yet. I do have some particular goals Iâm working on getting to, and in my mind, they âdefine success,â but the goal post is always shifting. If I can be regularly working as a photographer, taking time to spend with family, and with a lovely network of friends, then Iâll consider myself successful!\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHE FINAL TWO\n\nÂ\n\nName three people you would like to answer these questions?\n\nPetra Kleis, Photographer (Copenhagen, DK)\n\nLaura Richards, Criminal Behavioral Analyst (UK)\n\nPhoebe Waller-Bridge, Actor/Writer/Producer (UK)\n\nâHow would you describe LULUâLAND?\n\nA collective of people, thoughts, ideas, and art all rolled into one - it is whatever you want to make of it, as long as you have passion, desire for change, and a love of creating.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n\"I Might be a photographer, but I can't take a selfie, if my life depend upon it\"\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nTHEÂ END\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nWE LOVE TO CONNECT PEOPLE\n\nâ\n\nNAME Stephanie Geddes\n\nEMAIL hello@stephaniegeddes.com\n\nWEBSITE stephaniegeddes.com\n\nINSTAGRAM @stephgeddes\n\nLINKEDIN Stephanie Geddes\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nCREDITS\n\nâ\n\nPUBLISHED BY LULUâLAND\n\nPHOTOS BY Stephanie Geddes\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nMy name is Louise. And well, I am the founder and creator of LULUâLAND. Before starting LULUâLAND, I worked with management and business development in architecture and as a consultant in strategy, business development, and innovation at a Scandinavian consultancy.\n\nI have always wanted to start a business that would allow me to work with a lot of different creative projects and travel at the same time. Eight months ago, I took the first step towards realizing my dream; I bought a one-way ticket to Bali and started working on what I, after countless hours of frustration, overthinking, and horrible alternatives, named LULUâLAND.\n\nTraveling and working in various co-working spaces, in different countries, side by side with creators and entrepreneurs from around the world, made me feel more inspired than ever. So, I spent a lot of time contemplating how I would be able to share this inspiration. Inspiration is a weird and fluffy concept â it can be anything and everything at the same time. In the end, I decided to ask my friends what questions they would ask, someone who truly inspires them. I turned their answers into 50 interview questions, which, when answered, will create a series of LULUâLAND portraits.\n\nAs the founder, I am naturally LULUâLANDâs strongest supporter and worst critic. Therefore, it only seems fitting that I'll be the very first person to answer the questions, sharing a part of me with all of you, however intimidating that feels.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nOK, LET'S START WITHÂ THEÂ EASYÂ ONES\n\nâ\n\nName:\n\nâLouise BÃ¸geskov Hou (Nicknames: âLulu, Lou, Loui, people usually only call me Louise when they are mad at me.)\n\nâ\n\nBirth month/year:\n\nâDecember 1986\n\nâ\n\nNationality:\n\nâDanish\n\nâ\n\nCurrently located in:\n\nâCopenhagen, but traveling and working remotely.\n\nâ\n\nWhat do you do for a living?\n\nI would probably call myself a creative entrepreneur"
