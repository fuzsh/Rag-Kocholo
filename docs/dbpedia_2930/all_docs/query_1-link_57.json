        "text": "Early Data Victory and other Vintage Goodness from Copenhagen\n\nWe have covered the historical aspects of Danish bicycle infrastructure before here on our blog, including the first cycle track in the world in 1892 on Esplanaden in Copenhagen. There is always space for more lessons from history.\n\nAbove is a photo from Copenhagen in 1911. The streets along The Lakes in Copenhagen were the busiest for bicycles in the entire nation around the turn of the last century. The conditions for cyclists, however, left much to be desired.\n\nThe swarms of cyclists only had a narrow edge of a riding path to use. The Danish Cyclists' Federation, founded in 1905, demanded a cycle track on the route. The city's horse riders refused to relinquish space.\n\nIn an early example of the power of data related to traffic, a traffic count was done in 1909. It turned out that 9000 cyclists were counted each day, but only 18 horse riders. That changed the conversation. A three metre wide cycle track was put into place in 1911.\n\nIt was bi-directional, as you can see on the above two photos, but we hadn't yet figured out that bi-directional was a bad idea on streets. At the time, it was good. Now we know better.\n\nI found the above photo in the City's archives a few years back. 1915 was scribbled on the back. I have been waiting for this calendar year to cycle out to the Østerbro neighbourhood to photograph the same spot. I did so last Sunday, on a quiet afternoon. Same spot as in 1915. This stretch features 20,000+ cyclists a day today.\n\nThis photo is from farther outside the city, in 1955. These cyclists in the morning rush hour are heading for the stretch in the previous photo, on the other side of the street. The need for a cycle track as obvious in 2015 as it was in 1955 and 1915.\n\nWhile I was in the neighbourhood, I took a photo at the same spot as the photo, above. On Østerbrogade, next to The Lakes. Wider cycle track back in the 1930s, but not by much.\n\nOn the left is a map from 1916 of the bicycle infrastructure in Copenhagen and Frederiksberg. On the right is a map of the same from 1935. Compare this to Helsinki, which also had a great network of cycle tracks in 1937, like so many other cities.\n\nWe know that much bicycle infrastructure was removed in the urban planning brain fart that was the 1950s and 1960s. There isn't a lot of information about how much and where. We do know that the modal share for bicycles in Copenhagen plummeted from a high of 55% in 1949 to single digits in 1969.\n\nThis is a photo from Svanemøllen, north of Copenhagen, in 1899. What is interesting about this is that the sign at right reads \"Cykelsti\" - \"Bike Lane\". From the first dedicated facility for bicycles in 1892, it didn't take long to get official signage in place.\n\nAnother cycle track shot from the 1930s on Amagerbrogade.\n\nIt was near here that the city starting putting physically separated cycle tracks back in, in the early 1980s.\n\nFinally, a photo of a bicycle school in Copenhagen in the late 1800s. Women learning the ropes of the freedom machine.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWatching Copenhagen Bike Share Die\n\nPhoto by Dennis Steinsiek from Dutch-it.eu\n\nThe news today out of Copenhagen is about the imminent failure of the city's new bike share system. Copenhageners are ignorning the bikes, few trips are being taken on them and they have become a tourist gimmick, not the commuter dream they hoped for.\n\nIt's a rare event that a bike share system fails. Only a very few systems around the world have folded. Melbourne was the poster child for failure thanks to their helmet laws, helmet promotion, lack of infrastructure and anti-cyclist laws. Now it looks like Copenhagen will step into the failure spotlight.\n\nI am in two minds.\n\nI have never been a fan of the bikes or the system and have done little to conceal that fact. I said it was doomed to failure back in 2013. I have wondered why Danish State Railways didn't just copy the decade-old OV-Fiets system from Dutch Railways instead of being seduced by useless, overcomplicated technology. You can read all about why I think the system was a massive fail from the beginning in this article.\n\nWhile it is always great to be proven right, it is also sad when a project that puts more bikes in a city is on the cusp of failure. Especially sad when my tax money was used on it.\n\nThe Copenhagen bike share system was launched a year ago. Here are some relevant numbers.\n\nThe Cost\n\nThe average cost for a bike share bike in cities like London, Paris, etc is about $800. An OV Fiets bike costs about $400.\n\nThe Copenhagen bikes cost $3000 each. $10,000 each in total for purchase and maintenance over eight years. You read that right.\n\nThe Copenhagen Go-bikes aren't even free, like in most of the 650 cities around the world with bike share programmes.\n\nIt costs 25 kroner ($5.00) per hour to ride one. You can get a subscription for 70 kroner if you want, and that knocks the price down when you use it.\n\nYou can rent a bike for the entire day at Baisikeli for 60 kroner.\n\nThe City of Copenhagen has invested 40 million kroner ($7.5 million) in the project.\n\nThe Users\n\nThe biggest mistake in Copenhagen is a complete misunderstanding of how people think and of civic pride. The successful bike share systems in Barcelona and Seville, for example, are for locals only. You can't use them if you don't live there. They are something for the locals, not the tourists. An important distinction. Locals rarely want to resemble tourists in any city. The Copenhagen GoBikes are just like the Bycykler that Copenhagen launched in 1995 - they are already labelled as a touristy thing.\n\nThe goal for the new bikes was that each bike would be used 3 times a day by local commuters.\n\nSince the launch they have been used 0.8 times a day - by tourists.\n\nThe Usage\n\n800 people signed up for a subscription in the summer of 2014.\n\nThat number has now fallen to 256.\n\nIn the first half of December 2014, only 530 trips were registered.\n\nThe Fleet\n\nThe plan is that 1860 new bikes should be on the streets in Copenhagen. There are only 426.\n\nThere should be 105 docking stations. There are only 27.\n\nOne problem is that the German supplier, MIFA (Mitteldeutsche Fahrradwerke), went into recievership last autumn. Which doesn't say much for this product.\n\nThe Lame Excuses\n\nThe damage control spin coming out of City Hall from, among others, Mayor for the Technical and Environmental Administration Morten Kabell as well as people like Nikolaj Bøgh, head of the By- og Pendlercykel Fund is much the same. It's all \"oh, but you see... we haven't even marketed the system yet!\"\n\nSeriously? A product that is well-designed, intuitive and that actually serves a practical need will market itself. Failed design won't.\n\nViral? Not.\n\nThe Copenhagen bike share system was meant - in the mind of the Danish State Railways - to be so groovy that it would spread to other Danish cities. Turns out that ain't gonna happen. The second largest city in Denmark, Aarhus, just launched new bikes recently.\n\nExit Strategy\n\nWe can't keep pumping money into a system that isn't working. Who will get us out of this mess?\n\nIf we got out now, we'd still have money to implement a Dutch style OV-Fiets system that would work from the first ride.\n\nMore on the subject:\n\n- The Bike Share System Copenhagen ALMOST Had\n\n- The E-Bike Sceptic\n\n- Bye-bye Bycyklen\n\n- The Future of City Bikes or a Waste of Money?\n\n↧\n\nTop Ten Ways to Hate on Pedestrians\n\nSo there you stand. The Gatekeeper. Tasked with defending the great bastion of Motordom and upholding a last-century codex about city planning and engineering. In your mind's eye you think you resemble THIS gatekeeper, but sorry... the fact is, you're more of the Keymaster type when you look in the mirror. But hey. Your job is important. Keeping the streets clear of irritating, squishy obstacles so that Motordom's armada can continue flowing freely. Don't worry about Ignoring the Bull. You ARE the bull and don't you forget it.\n\nWhat tools are at your disposal? What are the most effective ways to reverse 7000 years of city life and keep pedestrians out of the way, under control, under your greasy thumb, Gatekeeper? We've compiled a list for you.\n\nAdopt one or more of the following ideas in your city and declare proudly to the world that you are:\n\nA: Completely unwilling to take traffic safety seriously\n\nB: Ignorant of the existing Best Practice regarding traffic calming and lowering speed limits\n\nC: A slave to an archaeic, last century mentality\n\nD. Immune to the death and injury of millions\n\nE: Incompetent\n\n1. Pedestrian Buttons\n\nIt's important that pedestrians don't think they own the place. Nevermind the fact that for 7000 years, they actually did. With a simple installation, you can force these rogues of the urban landscape to apply for permission to cross a street. You can control them. Make them feel insignificant. Have fun with it, too. Install a speaker with a scolding, authoratative voice that speaks to them like they are children. Configure the system to rotate randomly through waiting times. On two-stage crossings, have a field day. Make them wait as long as you like in the middle, boxed in like animals.\n\n2. Jaywalking\n\nAnything else is un-American. Those Eurotrash types didn't get THIS memo and look at where THEY'RE at. Jaywalking is as American as apple pie, shooting beer cans in the desert and super-sized meals. It was a gift to America from the automobile industry, so you know it must be good.\n\nEnforce it. A 7000 year old habit in cities CAN be eradicated if you really want it bad enough. Your cops will feel empowered and get valuable training for dealing with terrorists later. Back in the day, we used Boy Scouts to chastise jaywalkers. Now we get to do it with heavily-armed law enforcement officers. Don't be shy about a little collateral damage. It's for the common good.\n\nThe day we let pedestrians walk wherever they want is the day the terrorists have won.\n\n3. Pedestrian Flags\n\n\"Because we pride ourselves in being a walkable and bikeable community, we need our citizens to feel safe on our roads and sidewalks, and pedestrian safety is of utmost importance.” Thus sayeth Mayor John Woods of Davidson, North Carolina. Print out a photo of him and others like him and make an altar in your engineering department. He understands. That's not him the photo. The lady on the left is Mayor of some other visionary town.\n\nInstall pedestrian flags at crosswalks - or Pedestrian Control Zones, as we like to call them - and force pedestrians to wave one high above their head in the hope that the fine, motoring citzens might notice. Send a clear message to them about their parasitical status in the transport hierarchy by making them feel so completely helpless and stupid all at once. Added value: It's hilarious to drive past a flag-waving pedestrian.\n\nDo NOT refer to the Eurotrash-esque Berkeley types when they conclude \"The use of the flags did not seem to have a significant effect on driver behavior.\". Pedestrianism is socialism sneaking in the back door. Refer instead to other visionary communities who share your views.\n\n4. Criminalize Walking\n\nWith simple legislation your community, too, can clamp down on humans moving unaided by fossil fuels through your paradisical motorised world. Follow the lead of this New Jersey town and ban texting while walking and reduce exponentially the irritating dents caused by human bones striking the smooth, elegant paint jobs of your citizens' cars. If only we had thought of this back when people walked around reading newspapers in cities. Damn.\n\nAt the same time, you can go all Spanish on your population's asses and ban Drunk Walking. Laugh in the face of those who suggest restricting cars or lowering speed limits in densely-populated nightlife districts and keep your police force fresh and battle-ready by enforcing this sensible law.\n\n5. Tell 'Em What to Wear\n\nThese pedestrian types obviously need a lot of help so dictating their clothing is a no-brainer. Start condescending campaigns to ridicule them for not wearing brightly-coloured clothing and reflective vests, et al. Whatever you do, don't get any smart-ass ideas about doing the same for cars. You are The GATEKEEPER, for christ's sake.\n\nDon't worry, you have \"walking experts\" on your side, pilgrim. \"Be safe - be seen. It's only your life that depends on it. Night walking means taking extra care that cars can see you. For the best safety, your entire outline should be reflective and you should carry a light or wear a flasher.\"\n\nNot to mention the Center for Disease Control. They have awesome parking facilities, by the way.\n\n6. Lull Them With Distraction\n\nOrwell, Shmorwell. Aldous Huxley understood our Brave New World. Want to control and distract people? Give them mindless entertainment distration. Distrantrainment. Enterstraction. Oh, whatever. Just control them. Big Auto will thank you. Your city engineers won't have to waste time worrying about safety and have more time to do important work.\n\nGameify it. Let these bums play Pong while they wait. Whatever keeps them out of the way of cars is a GOOD thing.\n\nMake it even simpler. These people are morons, anyway. Just have a funny - like haha funny - dancing green man on the pedestrian signal. It's seriously that easy. The good people at Smart Car get it. They get it real good.\n\n7. Instill Fear\n\nFear is your surest, sharpest weapon, Gatekeeper. Those pinko Berliners have their cutesy man in a hat, but protecting the bastion of Motordom requires vision and dedication. Get those pedestrians out of your way by scaring them.\n\nMake them run. For their lives.\n\n\"Watch out\"!, it reads in Danish. Yeah. You could trip on the sticker. That'll teach them. Sheesh, even the DANES get this.\n\n8. Ridicule\n\nIt works so well. Good old fashioned ridicule. The City of Cologne knows this. The automobile industry knew this and that is how we got to where we are today, thank goodness. Put goofy mimes or clowns out there and guide pedestrians like the sheep they are.\n\n9. Exploit Children\n\nKids are great. They are, after all, future motorists. We can plant all sorts of stuff in their head. We used them to ridicule jaywalkers back in the day, but we're not finished with them. Dress them up like clowns and throw them into the street to stop traffic.\n\n10. Fake Your Concern\n\nOkay. Fine. Once in awhile you actually have to pretend you care. Pay some people a bit of money to stand at crosswalks with flags equipped with a magical force field that will stop 2000 kg of steel and metal. Pretend you are \"helping\" and \"doing something\". It works in Sao Paulo.\n\n↧\n\nWorld's First Automated Underground Bike Parking\n\nThe very best thing about my work is the people I meet. While working on a project in Amstedam's dystopian Zuidas area earlier this month, I met Arjan. That's him on the right, with his Dad on the left. He showed me some of the bicycle-related products that their company, LoMinck, make. Then he surprised me.\n\n\"We made the world's first automated, underground bicycle parking system.\"\n\n\"What about the Japanese?\", I said, having seen the many films on YouTube about robotic underground silos for bike parking.\n\nHe just smiled. \"We were first. Ten years ago.\"\n\nI had to see it and we met the next day at the spot where the free ferries from Amsterdam Central Station arrive at Amsterdam Noord. I knew the non-descript little building where Arjan and his dad were waiting. I had no idea that it was, in effect, an important spot in bicycle history.\n\nDown into the bowels of the beast we went. Which was a short ladder trip, basically. This bike parking facility isn't a silo but rather a horizontal room underground. If you look at the photo on the left, it extends from the building to the pole on the right.\n\nWe were in a simple room with 50 bikes hanging on hooks. It all looked so simple. Like good design should look. Up top, his Dad put an OV Fiets bike into the system and we watched as the machine gripped the front wheel and it descended, placed on a hook like a drycleaned suit. Then up again it went.\n\nThis modest facility was opened by the Dutch Minister of Transport in 2005. Subscribers pay €9 per month and LoMinck takes care of the remote monitoring, maintenance, customer service, breakdown service and subscription management. The city of Amsterdam pays an annual fee for this service.\n\nIt doesn't have to be underground. It can also be implemented above ground or into buildings. The minimum required width is 3,5m, the minimum required height is 2,75m. The length is variable and determines the capacity of the system; every additional meter creates 4 additional bike positions.\n\nI asked Arjan and his Dad what they thought about the Japanese systems. Arjan translated the question for his Dad who just smiled and replied, \"Overcomplicated\".\n\nBut hey. There's more. Check this out. This is everything I believe in, in design. Simplicity and functionality. Stairs can be tricky with bikes. Most stairs in Denmark and the Netherlands have gutters to let you roll the bike up and down. How to improve the ease of use? Start with a broom.\n\nTasked by the City of Amsterdam to solve the issue of a particularly steep set of stairs that cyclists were avoiding, the Minck family went through some designs and then found a broom in the kitchen. They cut it in half. Stuck the bristles together. Presto.\n\nGoing up the stairs? How about a mini conveyor belt? Be still my designer heart.\n\nDon't even get me started on the VelowUp bike racks.\n\nSimple, functional design solutions. More of that, please.\n\nCheck out their stuff on the LoMinck website.\n\n↧\n\nThe Depressing Rise of Squiggletecture - and how to design a bicycle/ped bridge\n\nArchitectural competitions are great. A flurry of designs emerge from Photoshopland that allow you to gauge the current mood, trends and ideas. If you're lucky, there are a few ooh and ahh moments. We were sitting here at the office looking at the many entries for the open competition for the Nine Elms to Pimlico Bridge in London. A pedestrian and bicycle bridge across the storied Thames. The NEP Bridge competition, on their website, declares they are looking for:\n\n\"...exceptional, inspiring designs for a new bridge at the centre of the world’s greatest city. The successful entry will have to win the hearts of Londoners who are tremendously proud of their river and its rich architectural heritage.\n\nThere are considerable challenges and engineering feats to overcome. The design must work alongside the cutting edge architecture emerging on the south bank as well as the elegant frontages on the north. The landing points on both sides must integrate sensitively with their surroundings and provide a smooth and safe experience for the pedestrian and cyclists who use it.\n\nThis bridge is also a badly needed and valuable piece of infrastructure for London. It has a very strong transport case, will support the city’s growth and has significant funding commitments already in place. Developing an inspiring, beautiful design will allow us to take the project to the next stage and ensure this project comes off the page into reality in a much shorter timeframe.\"\n\nRavi Govindia, Leader of Wandsworth Council and co-chair of the Nine Elms Vauxhall Partnership\n\nArchitecture and design is a question of taste. What I like might not be what you like. I'm not going to bother talking about which designs appeal to me. Here at the office we started looking at the bridge from the mobility perspective and, as is our lot, from the perspective of citizen cyclists who want to get around their city. Basing our focus on the many bicycle bridges in the Netherlands and Denmark. In particular, Copenhagen has seven new bicycle bridges either just openend or on the way. Leaving the personal taste up to the individual, we looked at pure mobility.\n\nLike Ravi Govindia says, above, it's a badly needed and valuable piece of infrastructure with a strong transport case that will support the city's growth. It has to provide a smooth and safe experience for pedestrians and cyclists.\n\nIn the competition brief it says that:\n\n- \"...it must be inspiring, elegant and functional in its design and perfect in its execution.\"\n\n- \"Provide a safe and attractive link for pedestrians and cyclists crossign the river, encouraging movement between the two banks.\"\n\nI'm not really a big fan of architects dabbling in urban planning. So few have the knack for it. So, with that in mind, what is the State of the Architectural Bridge Nation?\n\nWelcome to the Weird World of Squiggletecture\n\nWhat is up with these squiggles?! It's perfectly fine to think out of the box. Not much gets accomplished if you don't. But there is a clear, and perhaps, disturbing trend which I have hereby dubbed Squiggletecture. There is an alarming number of renderings that have discarded straight lines.\n\nWhat is a bridge? Isn't it just a vital mobility link from one side of a body of water to another? Isn't that really the baseline for every decent bridge in history? Look at a map of Paris or any other city with bridges. They are straight. From one shore to the other. Providing no-nonsense A to B for the people using it. Only then do differences in design and aesthetics come into play.\n\nLook at the selection of designs, above. A2Bism had a cement block chained to its feet and it was thrown into the river. It's sleeping with the fishes.\n\nYou wonder who thinks stuff like this up. Are they all former interns at Foster + Partners? Wherever they cut their teeth on Photoshop, it is clear that these are people who do not ride bicycles in a city - or who didn't even bother trying before they started doodling a bicycle and pedestrian bridge. Let alone people who walk very much on their urban landscape. These are all designs for meandering tourists licking ice cream on a Sunday afternoon. People with nowhere to go and nowhere to be. These aren't designs for a city in constant motion and citizens moving purposely about.\n\nThe ramps. Seriously. Look at all those squiggletecture ramps. Round and round we go, slowly descending to the river bank like a flower petal on a summer breeze. Not exactly what any human in a city wants, now is it? Then look at some of those sharp turns on the bicycle ramps. Best Practice for grade and curves on bicycle infrastructure has been around for almost a century. Would it have hurt to spend a little while on Google? Or on a bicycle? Unbelievable.\n\nOne of the designs has a fancy waterfall - bringing inspiration to London from.... 1980s Edmonton, Canada. But really, the water is a visual shield to disguise the Danteesque inferno in the middle that forces cyclists to descend to several levels of mobility hell.\n\nHere's a thought. Is this pornographic obsession with ramps a subliminal product of decades of car-centric planning? Is there a little voice embedded in the minds of designers and architects that says, \"hey... if you have get up or down from an elevation, use a winding ramp. That's what they do in car parking garages and on motorways...\" Has car infrastructure dominated so thoroughly that it's hard to plan for other forms of transport?\n\nWhatever. These designs would be great for a Bridge Over the River Why. London certainly doesn't need anymore of this.\n\nIt is apparently easy to draw a (curved) line between Illustrator's improvement of their Draw a Curve function and design renderings. There are only 30,000 hits on this how-to film, but I bet 10,000 are from people responsible for the all the photos about this point.\n\nI can lament the fact that there is so little anthropology at play in architecture but assuming that anybody who walks or cycles in a city is a meanderthal shows a lack of understanding of human nature. Stop with these curves, already. It's Magpie Architecture, nothing more. Bling your badass bridge all you want, just don't force people to alter their urban trajectory because you learned a new trick in Illustrator.\n\nThere will always be exceptions to this. The new Circle Bridge in Copenhagen by Olafur Eliasson is one. It is not at a location, however, that is - or will be - a vital mobility link. It's just a modest connector bridge across a canal for cyclists and pedestrians. Any bridge that is expected to get a decent share of cyclists wouldn't be designed like this.\n\nAh, you might say. What about the Bicycle Snake/Cykelslangen in Copenhagen? Isn't that curvy and all that? It is, indeed.\n\nFirstly, it has to navigate a 90 degree turn around the corner of a building. But you don't force cyclists to do 90 degree turns, so they swept it elegantly around the corner for comfort and safetly. The bridge slopes down to the harbour bridge and, with an expected 16,000 A to B cyclists a day, the graceful curvature nudges people ever so slightly to keep their speed in check on the descent.\n\nThe designs for the NEP Bridge, above, just curve for no particular reason. With no regard for getting people where they want to go. Instead, there seems to be a distinct focus on increasing travel times by creating a mobility obstacle course.\n\nSpeaking of obstacles, it was surprising to see that designs were actually sent in that just discarded the idea of ramps altogether and rolled their dice on... stairs. Big, fancy, modern bridge across the river of a major world city and you have to navigate stairs to get there. Although some designs feature elevators to further slow you down and one chucked in escalators for bikes.\n\nOne of the designs has a small box in the corner showing the Everest slope and upselling it by declaring the intention to implement \"Place making across the bridge and its landing position\". Just look at the place they imagine making. Ooh. Sticky.\n\nIf you want to create a bicycle and pedestrian bridge in 2015, can we agree that stairs and elevators should not be your point of departure?\n\nA lot of the renderings only provide conceptual ideas and it's sometimes hard to see details. Nevertheless, it wasn't all squiggletecture, curve balls and epic climbing expeditions. There are designs that make sense. There seem to be some common denominators. One of them is that the designer/architect has probably actually tried to ride a bicycle in a city. Another is a clear separation between the two user groups.\n\nThe design at top left does so rather elegantly, with a cycle track down the middle. As does the design at bottom left. At bottom right is a design similar to what you see over the Brooklyn Bridge. Doesn't make it a good thing, but at least the designer was thinking about A2B and dividing space between cyclists and pedestrians.\n\nI was going to start commenting on which design(s) I like, but then I remembered I said I wouldn't that at the beginning of the article. So nevermind.\n\nWhat is going to work, regardless of design, is a bridge that provides an intelligent A2B without irritations or detours at either end. A bridge that understands pedestrians and their needs and expectations, absolutely, but also one that does the same for cyclists. Again, that's bascially almost every city bridge ever built prior to the dawn of automobile culture.\n\nThere is one sentence in the competition brief, mentioned above, that would benefit from being rearranged like this:\n\n\"...it must be functional in its design, perfect in its execution and also inspiring and elegant.\"\n\nIt's a modern lifeline across a river in a world city, not a coffee cup.\n\nFunctional design first or don't bother.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Copenhagenize Current - Stormwater Management and Cycle Tracks\n\nCloudburst in Copenhagen. July 4, 2011. Photo via DJ Ladze on Flickr. With permission.\n\nClimate change challenges are clearly defined in Copenhagen and in Denmark. 1000 km of dikes protect many parts of the country from the sea, but the new threat is the water from within and from above. Our fate has become being inundated with torrential rain that floods entire neighbourhoods. The existing sewer system is completely inadequate to tackle the volume of water from cloudbursts.\n\nIt is something that is a reality for us living in Copenhagen and in many Danish cities and there is a great deal of political focus on it. Just have a look at this bad boy pdf featuring Copenhagen's Climate Adaptation Plan.\n\nThere are already many ideas and intiatives on the table in Copenhagen. Much is said and written about creating \"Cloudburst Streets\", like the one, above. Creating green space that becomes \"blue\" during cloudbursts and acts as a stormwater delay. Other streets may get a green strip down one side with the same effect.\n\nFantastic. An excellent excuse to greenify many areas of the city and a perfect way to avoid complaining about removing parking spots and whatnot from last-century minds.\n\nGreenification of streets and creating reservoirs for overflow of rainwater are fantastic additions to the urban landscape. Exploiting the need for water runoff solutions to create more green space in cities is brilliant. Not every street in Copenhagen, however, has the space to accommodate wide, green reservoirs or green channels. What of the many other streets?\n\nUrban space is affected greatly by the new climate reality in Danish cities. It is, however, urban space that can help solve the problem we face.\n\nWhich is why we are developing The Copenhagenize Current.\n\nLike many ideas, it starts with personal experience. That's me, on the left, on Istedgade in the Vesterbro neighbourhood, during a cloudburst that flooded the whole 'hood. Farther down the street, there were people kayaking. Like many great ideas, it starts in the bathroom of a bar on a Saturday night. We had been discussing climate adaptation in the office at Copenhagenize Design Company. Standing there one night, I considered the existing, traditional system, attached to the wall and then noticed how space on the floor was being used for \"excess water runoff\" in case of spray or bad aim. A supplementary system that also assists during mopping and general cleaning.\n\nCouldn't that simple idea be applied to streets? Including my own, where the businesses in the cellar were flooded beyond repair in 2011? What about using existing urban space to design a stormwater runoff system.\n\nLike any good idea spawned in a nocturnal bathroom, you get your kids to help with a Lego model. We have existing space. Copenhagen's comprehensive network of cycle tracks on main streets are there and they're not going anywhere - thank goodness. Real estate that is in use and integral to city life. Bicycles, however, are lightweight vehicles that cause little wear and tear on the infrastructure. Therefore, I thought quite simply, why not create high-volume rainwater trenches underneath the cycle tracks?\n\nThat is what The Copenhagenize Current is all about. Using existing space for rainwater managment in extreme weather conditions and, while we’re at it, improving infrastruture for the city’s cyclists.\n\nIn a nutshell, The Copenhagenize Current involves digging trenches under existing cycle tracks, implementing precast, concrete containers and covering them with pre-fab, concrete slabs. It is a basic cut and cover operation. On streets without adequate space for wide medians that can be dug out and act as reservoirs for stormwater, the Copenhagenize Current can act as an incredibly efficient, high-volume system to expedite the drainage of streets and lead water away from vulnerable areas. Copenhagenize Design Co.s architect Steve Montebello has worked on the designs and calculations.\n\nWe have designed the Copenhagenize Current to lead high-volumes of water through vulnerable neighbourhoods. The Cities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg have been discussing dredging one of the Lakes - Saint Jørgen's Lake - and lead stormwater to it from surrounding areas so it can act as a temporary reservoir.\n\nThis is what it might look like, complete with redesigned lakefront. The Copenhagenize Current can be used to lead water to such a lake reservoir solution.\n\nUsing pre-fabricated concrete slabs that can bear the weight of thousands of bicycles - and still allow for crossing motor vehicles at intersectionss - allows for implementation of a number of other features. LED lights can be built into the slabs to further visibility of the cycle track. In addition, heating coils can be embedded in the surface, under the final layer of asphalt, to melt snow and ice during the winter.\n\nHaving pre-fab slabs will also provide a smoother ride for cyclists, minimise the risk of potholes and make maintenence of the cycle tracks easier. So much goodness.\n\nThe design allows for a maximum amount of drainage grates so that all water at every point can easily fill into the concrete trenches. Grates on the surface will serve to drain water coming from the sidewalk onto the Current. The Current can also work independently of the existing sewer system or together with it, depending on need.\n\nThe water flow routes in Copenhagen. Most lead towards the harbour or the sea.\n\nAdded Value\n\nApart from the obvious benefits of the Current, namely the fast removal of stormwater from streets and protecting surrounding neighbourhoods and buildings from flooding, there are points that provide an added value to our design.\n\nImproved Accessibility to Cables\n\nMost cables related to urban life are buried beneath sidewalks and, to a lesser extent, roads. We have considered the idea of creating cable trays on the wall of the concrete trenches to provide easy access to certain types of cables.\n\nInspiration for Improvement\n\nThe design serves an important purpose - stormwater protection for cities. The design can also encourage municipalities that are reluctant about widening existing bicycle infrastructure on certain streets to finally do so by implementing the Current. Gammel Kongevej, with the narrowest cycle tracks in the capital, springs to mind.\n\nCost-Benefit\n\nMaintenance costs on cycle tracks will fall due to the reduced need for repairing potholes. Better infrastructure encourages cycling, as well. The pre-fab slabs are easily replaced on an individual basis if need be.\n\nStormwater Fountain\n\nWe would love to see the Current end in a pipe that leads under Skt Jørgens Lake or in the harbour. The mouth of the pipe positioned above the surface. During a stormwater surge, the force of the water rushing to the destination will create a fountain. A spray of water - that can be designed - that will celebrate the rain - and the human solutions for tackling it.\n\nSilvacells\n\nAccommodation can be made for pipes leading off of the Current onto side streets or into parks where silva cells under trees and/or vegetation are located.\n\nWhen the climate - or rather humans - throws you a curve ball, you have to think out of the box. Especially when your box is quickly filling up with water.\n\n↧\n\nMy Stolen Bullitt\n\nHere we go again.\n\nOut into the backyard this morning with The Lulu, heading for school and then off to work. Something was missing. It was big and red and quite gone. My Bullitt cargo bike was not where it should be. Locked with the mother of all chains in our bike shed. It was stolen.\n\nThe first thought was \"Damn... my logistics this week are screwed.\" Second thought... \"I liked that bike\". You know you live in a mainstream bicycle culture when the thoughts occur in THAT order.\n\nI walked around the backyard in vain hope. Then I noticed that another Bullitt wasn't parked in its normal spot. It was gone, too. Double Bullitt thieving in the dark of the night. In a secure, locked backyard.\n\nFun having to explain to The Lulu, aged 7, about why people do such things. She's no stranger to bike theft, but still, she was as upset as me, so we had to tackle the subject on the spot.\n\nIt's just a bike, I know. But it's a bike that we use alot. For transporting stuff like just two days ago at the recycling centre. For building snowmen. For just getting around town. For all our daily needs.\n\nSomeone is going to have to break the news to Tigger this evening. THAT ain't gonna be pretty.\n\nThis has happened before. Hey, it's a bicycle culture. Back in 2011: My Bike Was Stolen! Back then the story had a fairytale ending against all the odds and thanks to social media: My Bullitt is Found!\n\nI even got my vintage Swedish bike back once, too.\n\nWhile I don't harbour hopes of repeating those fairytales, you never know. There are loads and loads of Bullitts in Copenhagen now, compared to back in 2011 but anything could happen.\n\nMy bike has some unique markings. Sure, the first thing the bike thief does is remove them, but sometimes they just stick it in another backyard in another part of town for a while. There's a pattern to this cargo bike theft.\n\nSo, here are the things that make it recognizable:\n\n- A little sticker on the front.\n\n- A Copenhagenize.eu sticker on the front panel.\n\n- A map of Copenhagen on the cargo bay.\n\n- The handlebars are unlike many Bullitts in Copenhagen. My mother taught me to sit up straight, so they are not low and straight, but high and suitable for a gentleman.\n\n- There is a GoPro base on the front of the bike and, down by the front wheel on the left, there is another GoPro solution. (not pictured)\n\n- On the back fender there are white, reflective chevron stickers, just like on The Lulu's bike.\n\nSigh.\n\nHvis du ser cyklen et eller andet sted i København, sms eller ring på 26 25 97 26.\n\n↧\n\nNew Bicycle Bridge - Cirkelbroen - Is Coming\n\nThis is exactly what you like to see on a spring morning in brilliant sunshine in Copenhagen. Yet another bicycle/pedestrian bridge being put into place on Copenhagen Harbour. The Circle Bridge - Cirkelbroen in Danish - is designed by Danish artist Olafur Eliasson and will fix a minor glitch in the mobility network in Copenhagen.\n\nThis beautiful but modest bridge will connect Christiansbro and Applebys Square. A subtle, but important link in making the entire harbourfront walkable and bikeable. On the above map you can see the new and coming bicycle bridges in this section of the harbour. Yes, pedestrians use them, too, but in Copenhagen they are referred to as bicycle bridges first and foremost.\n\nThe bridge is a gift to the City of Copenhagen from the Nordea Foundation (they're a bank) and it is 32 metres long. For a budget of 34 million kroner ($4.8 million) you get an artistic bridge designed by a famous artist. Interestingly, the entire Bicycle Snake had about the same budget.\n\nBut hey, it's a gift so who cares. The form of the bridge is rounded, with no straight line from shore to shore. Normally, the design of a bridge for bicycles involves a straight line. The artistic licence on this bridge creates an aesthetic obstacle course. At this location, it is not a problem. This is not a major bicycle route, nor will it ever be. The main focus in on the recreational use of the harbourfront and creating access. So an exception is totally permissable.\n\nOlafur talks about his creative thoughts in this YouTube video, in Danish. The masts reflect the masts of the many ships in Christianshavn Canal. The bridge is a swing bridge, to allow access from the harbour to the canal and vice versa. The many canal tour boats plying their tourist trade will just scoot underneath.\n\nThe bridge was originally meant to be finished in 2012 but the same malady struck it as struck the Innner Harbour Bridge farther east. The company who was building them went bankrupt and things rolled to a halt. The locals in this area of Christianshavn are among the whiniest and least willing to see Copenhagen change, so there was also a delay as some of them tried their case against the bridge in the courts. All water under the bridge now.\n\nToday, work is underway. The components are constructed and are being set into place. Spring is upon us. A new bridge is blossoming. Copenhagen just got a little bit cooler.\n\n↧\n\nCar Industry Strikes Back - Volvo Paints a Grim Picture\n\nThe latest piece in our ongoing Car Industry Strikes Back series writes itself. This time it's Volvo doing its best to draw your attention to the fact that motorists kill obscene amounts of people - including themselves - by placing the responsibility on cyclists and pedestrians. It's a smoke screen and this time it's sprayed on. It is Ignoring the Bull in Society's China Shop taken to the next level.\n\nVolvo Life Paint. Seriously. Life paint.\n\nBut hey... it's not for the 35,000+ people killed by or in cars in the EU alone by Volvo and their Big Auto homies (around the same in the US and 1.2 million worldwide - not to mention the tenfold more killed by pollution from cars and trucks or the hundreds and hundreds of thousands more injured...).\n\nAnd no, it's not rational ideas like helmets for motorists or making motorists responsible by forcing them to have external airbags.\n\nIt's spray on paint.\n\nNo, not for cars, even though black cars are most likely to be involved in collisions. No, it's not rational stuff like reflective paint on cars or health warning legislation on all automobiles.\n\nIt's for you on foot or on a bicycle because you are an irritation to motorists. You are a squishy bug ruining their paint job. You are a threat to their mobility dominance. You must be ridiculed with calls for reflective vests/clothing and a variety of ways to hate on pedestrians.\n\nNow you have the gift of Big Auto paint to spray on your irritating person.\n\nhttp://www.volvocarslifepaint.com/\n\nI don't think we realise how slippery a slope it is we are on as a society when morons like this produce crap like this and actually get taken seriously.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nMake Life Shine - Yes, You Volvo\n\nVolvo's new attack on pedestrians and cyclists is insulting to every traffic user. They have developed what they call \"Life Paint\" and expect pedestrians and cyclists to spray it on. The problem is that Volvo - and other automobile manufacturers - are the problem. They make products that kill 1.2 million people a year around the world. 35,000 alone in both the European Union and the USA alone. Not to mention the millions injured by cars or the many millions killed slowly by emissions. They continue to pass the buck, to set up smoke screens to make us focus elsewhere and forget the true problem. Look at every tactic the tobacco industry has used over the past 20 years and you see it mirrored in Big Auto. Volvo claims to lead the way in safety, but their Life Paint cannot hide their true colours.\n\nQuite simply, we've started a petition. Enough of this Ignoring the Bull in the China Shop.\n\nMake Life Shine.\n\nSign it at Change.org\n\nInstead of targeting the vulnerable traffic users and continuing the victim blaming, we insist that Volvo offers free Life Paint to every Volvo owner on the planet so that cars can be illuminated better in cities and rural settings. Get the spray can at the local dealer or get it shipped for free. Spray that car immediately.\n\nWe know a few things:\n\n- Black, grey and silver cars - in that order - are more likely to be involved in crashes, according to a Monash University study. Based on 20 years and 850,000 car crashes. Reflective paint on cars is a no-brainer.\n\n- Cars and motorists kill. You read the stats, above. There is a 9-11 every month in America alone and it's been there every single month for over 60 years. Volvo, of all car companies, should be tackling this head on instead of blaming the victims.\n\n- Volvo should be lobbying intensely for mandatory reflective paint in every market that they operate in. Their Life Paint should be the jewel in their safety crown. Instead, it's tear gas in the eyes of the victims.\n\n- Why stop there, Volvo? What about rational ideas like helmets for motorists or making motorists responsible by forcing them to have external airbags? These ideas exist for good reason. There is science to support them. What about health warning legislation on all automobiles? The ills caused by tobacco are virtually the same as those caused by Volvo's products.\n\nSign the petition to get Volvo to offer Life Paint on every car on the roads today.\n\nSee the ridiculous Life Paint here:\n\nhttp://www.volvocarslifepaint.com/\n\n↧\n\nChoreography of a Copenhagen Corner - Desire Line Analysis\n\nDesire Line Analysis: Choreography of a Copenhagen Corner\n\nCyclist Behaviour at a busy Copenhagen cycle intersection\n\nBy Marie Lindebo Leth - Anthropologist\n\nFor the next study in our Desire Line series we have picked a renowned Copenhagen bicycle hotspot: the Søtorvet / Dronning Louise’s Bro intersection. Over 40,000 bicycle trips are made through this intersection at a daily basis, making it one of the busiest in the world in terms of cyclist volume.\n\nSuch numbers create a special need for appropriate bicycle infrastructure in order to accommodate the bicycle users crossing this point. At Copenhagenize Design Company we have asked ourselves how we can determine the actual needs of bicycle users, and what solutions would be appropriate. This quest requires a greater understanding of the relationship between urban infrastructure and cyclist behavior, which is why we have conducted a Desire Line Analysis of this intersection.\n\nThe value of studying cyclist behavior\n\nThis study was conducted in collaboration with eight students from 4Cities, an international Urban Studies Master’s programme. Eight great and passionate students who tackled this analysis with professionalism.\n\nLorena Axinte (Romania), Jamie Furlong (United Kingdom), Elina Kränzle (Germany), William Otchere-Darko (Ghana), Lucie Rosset (Switzerland), Guillén Torres (Mexico), Mäelys Waiengnier (Belgium) and Devon Willis (Canada).\n\nIn order to identify how cyclists interact with infrastructure, and with other cyclists and road users, the students positioned a video camera and a few observers at the intersection between the hours 7:00 and 19:00 on a day in November 2014.\n\nOne particular spot in the intersection is the center of attention for this study. When cyclists approach the intersection, coming from North East along Søtorvet and want to turn right onto Dronning Louises Bro, they tend to either ‘cut’ the corner by riding onto the pedestrian zone, or run a red light when turning right. At Copenhagenize Design Co. we are interested in digging deeper into this behavioral pattern and understand the scale of, and reason behind the exhibited behavior.\n\nKnowing how and why bicycle users consistently choose particular routes and strategies can help us understand priorities and motivations of bicycle users and inform our solutions - design-wise and political - in order to better accommodate their needs while paying mind to other road users as well.\n\nWhat are Desire Lines?\n\nAt Copenhagenize Design Company, we have developed a method for determining how bicycle users actually navigate within the built environment and what routes they choose to take in various situations. This method we call Desire Line Analysis. By observing a bicycle user’s trajectory through a course of a road, we can determine the most traveled through routes - their desire lines. Desire lines are the easiest and most convenient ways of getting from point a to point b for bicycle users, and conceptually they should be distinguished from actual infrastructure with its pre-established paths. Desire lines might correspond with pre-established paths, but sometimes they don’t, and this is where they reveal flaws in the infrastructure that at the same time create opportunities for improvements.\n\nSix Desire Lines\n\nBased on our video footage we identified the cyclists’ desire lines, first by tracking their point of departure - Øster Søgade or Gothersgade - and then by observing their destination - straight ahead, or right onto Dronning Louises Bro.\n\nHowever, in this Desire Line study our main focus is on those cyclists turning right. We discovered six general desire line categories that cyclists use when turning right onto Dronning Louises Bro.\n\nThe desire lines above illustrate that cyclist typically chose one of following six trajectories or strategies when making a right turn:\n\n1. Following the official bike path - this desire line accounts for cyclists who turn right when the traffic lights are either green or red.\n\nAll other desire lines below are drawn by cyclists that “cut”, i.e. they ride from the bicycle path up onto the sidewalk, cutting the intersection in order to arrive at Dronning Louises’ Bro.\n\n2. Avoid the pedestrians - cyclists who zigzag or change their path in order to avoid pedestrians.\n\n3. Cut in the middle - cyclists who did not cut immediately, but followed the path for a few more meters than category 4 and 5, before deciding to cut\n\n4. Cut following the path - cyclists who ride onto the sidewalk and proceed by mimicking the bicycle path until they are close to the traffic light\n\n5. Cut right away - cyclists that cut the sidewalk as early as they can, without trying to follow the path.\n\n6. Cut last minute - cyclists who cut just as they arrived at the red light. (we suspect that when being confronted with a red light, people prefer riding on the sidewalk rather than waiting at for the light to change).\n\nShortcutting to keep the momentum\n\nThe question of what motivates people to cut the corner in order to arrive at the bike lane on Dronning Louises Bro is central to this study. In order to get closer to an explanation, we will first distinguish between cyclists who cut when traffic lights are red, and those who cut during a green light - where they could just as well have followed the bike path without stopping.\n\nThe first group - cyclists who cut the corner during a red light - is the largest of the two. In particular, cyclists coming from Gothersgade, arriving on Øster Søgade, then turning right, were more prone to cutting the corner when the light was red. This is probably because they most often arrive at a red light in the intersection. Traffic lights in this area are timed to provide cyclists coming a different direction - Øster Søgade via Fredens Bro - with constant green lights that follow the speed of the average cyclist - the so called ‘green wave’. This, however, means that cyclists coming from Gothersgade will have their momentum disrupted when they arrive at the Dronning Louises Bro/Øster Søgade intersection. Thus, using the wide sidewalk as a quick way to avoid waiting for the lights to change can be tempting.\n\nThe second group - cyclists who cut the corner while traffic lights were green - most often did so when there was a considerable number of cyclists in front of them, causing a queue for either turning right or continuing straight ahead. Such a situation creates an incentive to improvise a shortcut by riding across the sidewalk to get to Dronning Louises Bro.\n\nDuring the twelve hours we spent observing the intersection, only a few cyclist-pedestrian conflicts occurred. We are convinced that the considerable width of the sidewalk plays an important role here, since it leaves enough space for both pedestrians and cyclists to navigate around each other.\n\nMost played it safe\n\nWe also found that of all the cyclists travelling through the intersection (i.e. those who went straight along Øster Søgade and those who turned right onto Dronning Louises Bro), the majority acted “correctly” (i.e. they did not cut or go through a red light, but rather followed the traffic laws correctly). During midday (11:30- 13:30), 72% of cyclists acted correctly (following the traffic laws) and only 28% acted incorrectly or inappropriately (going through a red light or cutting). Similarly, during rush hour (15:30-17:30), 76% acted correctly and only 24% acting incorrectly.\n\nThis means that on average 74% followed the traffic law, meaning that they respected red lights and stayed on the bike path instead of cutting the corner. The remaining 26% performed some form of law breaking act.\n\nHowever, during the morning rush hour, an average of 50% cyclists either cut through the sidewalk or jumped the red light, when heading towards Nørrebrogade from Øster Søgade. 58% were male and 42% were female.\n\nRight-turners bent the rules more often\n\nWhile on average most cyclists acted correctly (74%), when looking at right-turning cyclists exclusively, the difference between those who followed the rules and those who didn’t, was less significant. Among cyclists who turned right onto Dronning Louises Bro, 52% acted correctly, while 48% acted incorrectly. Of those acting incorrectly, 35% went through the red light and 65% cut through the sidewalk.\n\nThis ‘improper behavior’ might be connected to a phenomenon we have observed before; the so-called ‘domino effect’ where the actions and routes taken by one cyclist is copied by other cyclists behind him or her. In this sense a specific action legitimizes or inspires other cyclists to perform similar actions. For example, we noticed that once a cyclist is cutting, others start to follow suit. Conversely, when none in the front of the line cuts, the cyclists queueing behind also tend to stay in the group.\n\nFewer cyclists run red lights during rush hour\n\nIn the early afternoon (13:30-15:30), many more cyclists acted incorrectly, an average of 68% cut or went through a red light, as opposed to a daily average of 48%. We suspect that this is because there are much fewer cyclists, cars and pedestrians on the road during this time of the day, and thus it is easier for cyclists to cut the intersection or slipping through a red light in a safer way, without getting noticed as much.\n\nOnly 16% of all the cyclists we observed went through a red light (i.e. actually going through the red light on the bicycle path, not by cutting). Although the average is quite low, as mentioned above, larger numbers of cyclists were going through the red light at certain points of the day: in the late morning (9:30-11:30) an average of 27% of cyclists coming from Gothersgade went through the red light, and in the early afternoon (13:30-15:30) an average of 41% of cyclists coming from this street went through the red light. Again, it seems like cyclists are more likely to run a red light in between rush hours. In fact, only 3% of cyclists went through the red light from Gothersgade during rush hour. This observation supports our theory that a higher volume of road users creates a lesser incentive for cyclists to go through a red light.\n\nLessons learned\n\nOur study confirms findings generated in previous desire line studies, showing how bicycle users create routes based on what is faster and most convenient, regardless of whether appropriate infrastructure is there or not. Although it sometimes means that bicycle users will follow the informal lead of other cyclists, and circumvent traffic rules in order to get to their destination, considerations regarding safety and/or public shaming do appear to inform their decision making.\n\nOnly 1:4 of the total number of bicycle users we observed actually broke the law. When they did cut the corner, they strategically picked different routes through the pedestrian zone in order not to collide with each other, and only very few conflicts between cyclists and pedestrians occurred.\n\nTo make a long story short, bicycle users are motivated to keep momentum going, and depending on the circumstances, some are ready to circumvent formal rules and collectively improvise their own in order to make their travel easier, if existing infrastructure does not accommodate their needs.\n\nCopenhagenize Fixes\n\nSo where should we go from here? Depending on the priorities of city authorities, different approaches could be used to mitigate the percieved ‘improper cyclist behavior’ in this intersection.\n\nConsidering the volume of bicycle traffic, the most obvious retrofit would be creating a cycle track in an arc across the corner to allow cyclists to turn right unimpeded by traffic lights. A similar solution is already in place on the opposite corner, leading cyclists across a sidewalk to Vendersgade from Nørrebrogade. As we understand it, one department in the City of Copenhagen would be against this - worried about protecting the architectural integrity of the location. This is rather silly, considering the fact the City had plans to rip out of the grassy knolls formed by WW2 bunkers, cut down the trees and sanitize the whole area. That idea died, fortunately, but it is clearly a sign that change can happen at this location. The basic fact at this location is that the majority of cyclists are turning right and the minority are heading parallel to The Lakes. Desire Lines are democracy in motion. People voting, as it were, with their feet and bicycle wheels.\n\nAs we found from the research, the main reason for cutting the corner or going through the red light is that cyclists coming from Gothersgade are trying to bypass the red light and simply maintaining their momentum. Especially in the busy rush hour it would be beneficial to time the traffic lights for cyclists coming from Gothersgade so that they continue in a smooth flow up Nørrebrogade. Maintaining, respecting and legitimizing the momentum that cyclists need would eliminate the need for cutting the corner.\n\nIt is with good reason that allowing right turns on red is steadily becoming law all over Europe. Making this the default at this intersection would also impact the behaviour positively. It is not the be all, end all solution at this location however.\n\nThe wide swath of sidewalk is currently a kind of “shared space” that works well at this location. Making the area shared use would require little physical change and would formalise the behaviour of the cyclists. A fun idea, but it is important to maintain a design standard and throwing a mixed use area into the well-functioning infrastructure design tradition may not be a good, permanent solution.\n\n↧\n\n7550 New Bike Parking Spots at Copenhagen Central Station\n\nFor all of Copenhagen's badass mainstream bicycle culture, there remains one thing that the City still completely sucks at. Bicycle parking at train stations. At Copenhagen Central Station there are only about 1000 bike parking spots. Danish State Railways can't even tell us how many spots they have. They're not sure.\n\nEven in Basel they have 800+. In Antwerp they have this. Don't even get me started on the Dutch. 12,500 bike parking spots are on the way in some place called Utrecht. Amsterdam has a multi-story bike parking facility, floating bicycle barges round the back and are planning 7000 more spots underwater.\n\nEven at the nation's busiest train station, Nørreport, the recent and fancy redesign failed miserably in providing parking that is adequate for the demand. Architects once again failing to respond to actual urban needs.\n\nIt is time to remedy that. Here is Copenhagenize Design Company's design for 7550 bike parking spots behind Copenhagen Central Station. Steve C. Montebello is the architect that I worked closely with.\n\nBy exploting the area over the train tracks and using Tietgens Bridge as the transport spine, we have created an iconic bicycle parking facility with ample parking spots at this important transport hub where trains, buses and - in 2019 - the Metro converge in an intermodal transport orgy.\n\nIn our work on the EU project BiTiBi.eu - Bike Train Bike - we have been focused on parking solutions at train stations. It was a natural evolution to use that experience in developing this project.\n\nThe structure is supported by columns and utilises the existing platforms below, which dictated the shape that we decided upon.\n\nThere are:\n\n- 6880 bike parking spots in double decker racks. This can be expanded with 1360 more if necessary.\n\n- 30 dedicated cargo bike parking spots featuring The Copenhagenize Bar by Cyclehoop.\n\n- 640 secure, indoor bike parking spots in the green roofed building at left (above).\n\n- A bike shop for repairs and maintenence.\n\n- Ticket machines and displays for departures and arrivals of trains and buses.\n\n- At the end of the long point, the belvedere will be the world's premiere, dedicated lookout spot design for trainspotters.\n\nHere is the view of the area as it is today.\n\nThere are four on/off ramps from Tietgens Bridge for ease-of-access.\n\nA secure bicycle parking facility will house 640 bikes.\n\nWe used 3D models of bike racks courtesy of our colleagues at the Dutch company Falco. They know a thing or two about bike racks.\n\nThere will be a space for a bike shop for repairs and maintenence located at the entrance, next to ticket machines and displays featuring departures and arrivals for trains and buses.\n\nThe parking with have signs with areas divided up alphabetically, so you can find your bike again.\n\nThere is access to the three platforms below by stairs that will, of course, have bike ramps. Duh.\n\nThis facility will right so many wrongs and will thrust Copenhagen into the 21st century regarding bicycle parking at train stations. If we are to maintain the momentum of a blossoming bicycle-friendly city, we need to up our game regarding parking.\n\n↧\n\nFelix and the Danish Cyclist Test\n\nMy son Felix on the course of today's cyclist test for 6th graders in Denmark, in Frederiksberg, Copenhagen.\n\nToday was a fun day in my son Felix' young life. Together with the other 6th grade students at La Cour Vej School, he took part in the Danish \"cyklistprøve\" - or Cyclist Test.\n\nThe test has been around since 1947. It's not mandatory but many schools choose to do it. When kids are in the 1st grade they get a week of initial cyclist \"how-to\" regarding rules of the road, etc. Then, in 6th grade, they rock the test like today. In my opinion, the test is great but it's also rather symbolic. Most of these kids have been cycling in the city since they were little. Felix has rocked the cycle tracks since he was three and a half. Parents teach them the rules and, most important, give them the practice they need. By the time they get to the 6th grade, the majority have a great deal of on-asphalt experience on their bicycles. Our school chooses to make passing the test a pre-requisite for going on outings by bike when they get older.\n\nToday's test almost didn't happen. The police are involved, as a rule, but because of the Copenhagen shootings earlier this year, they say they don't have the resources. They put a lot of resources into investigating and rounding up other potential terrorists, sure. But they have also spent a pile of money on positioning policemen armed with heavy weapons around the city. A symbolic gesture to \"make us feel safe\". An expensive, symbolic gesture that had little effect on Copenhageners. Right THERE, they could have saved some money and still helped do the cyclist test.\n\nNormally, the police are on hand for the test. They check the bikes to make sure they are legal and spend the morning with the students. Today it was different\n\nSome schools, however, took matters into their own hands. The principal of La Cour Vej School, where both my kids attend, said today that they chose to find the resources in THEIR budget to do the test anyway, because it is very important for the kids and for traffic safety that they take the test. So, at 7:40 this morning, me and five other parents showed up and were handed clipboards with the grading sheets. We each chose one of six posts to stand at and off we went. I had a sunny bench at the roundabout outside the school when the kids were on the home stretch.\n\nThere are four 6th grade classes at the school and each class took it in turn. They are sent off alone in 2-3 minute intervals on a 4.4 km ride through our neighbourhood. They each wear an orange vest with a number on both sides so that we can recognise them and mark them accordingly. Here's the route:\n\nThe route has a bit of everything. All forms of bicycle infrastructure, all levels of volume. Busy streets, quiet residential streets and lots of turns. Earlier this week the kids had a theory test and they all walked the route with their teacher.\n\nThe kids start off with 300 points and each mistake subtracts from that. Here's the list.\n\nOrientation\n\nDidn't shoulder check before a turn: -30 points\n\nDidn't shoulder check before a stop: -30\n\nDidn't shoulder check before positioning themselves in the right spot on the cycle track: -30\n\nSignalling\n\nForgot to signal a turn: -30\n\nDidn't signal a turn in good time: -30\n\nForgot to signal a stop: -30\n\nDidn't signal a stop in good time: -30\n\nGiving Way (Depending on situation)\n\nDid not give way: -30\n\nForgot to give way to others in same direction: -30\n\nForgot to give way to others in opposite direction: -30\n\nForgot to yield to pedestrians: -30\n\nPlacement\n\nWrong placement before a turn: -30\n\n(ie: On left side of cycle track but turning right. Wrong placement when turning left in a box turn)\n\nDidn't use the cycle track: -30\n\nRode on the sidewalk: -30\n\nRode in the pedestrian crossing: -30\n\nTraffic Lights/Signage\n\nRan a red light: Disqualified\n\nRode through a yellow light: -30\n\nDidn't see a traffic sign: -10\n\nOther\n\nRode too fast: -10\n\n(Silly rule and hard to gauge. Bikes have to follow the posted speed limit)\n\nRode too insecurely: -10\n\nRode with other students during test: -10\n\n(Kind of like cheating. The test is also about orientation in the city)\n\nWalked the bike: -10\n\nDidn't pass the monitoring post: -75\n\nOther mistakes: -30\n\nHere was my monitoring post:\n\nI had to watch them enter the roundabout and exit it again. Checking them for shoulder checks, giving way, signalling.\n\nSo after spending four hours on a street corner waiting for over eighty 12 and 13 year olds to pass, how did it go? I was impressed. They rocked it. The vast majority rode like a boss, with confidence despite the nervosity of performing a test and trying to get everything right. Like I said, most of these kids have been cycling in the city for years so it wasn't really a stretch for them. Merely a fun refresher course.\n\nSome were less confident on the bike, but none were perilous in their cycling. One poor kid got totally lost on the route and ended up in the Nørrebro neighbourhood. He wasn't in school on the day the kids walked the route and even though he had a map he still got a longer bike ride than he expected. Some kids bunched up a bit, even though they weren't supposed to. The 2-3 minute interval was generally good at spreading them out so they were on their own, finding their way on the urban landscape.\n\nI haven't seen the final results but when us six parents met up afterwards we had a chat. There were few dramas out there. Another day in a bicycle-friendly city. I can't see how any of the kids would fail the test, apart from the kid who got lost. I hope he gets another shot at it.\n\nNormally, when the police are involved, if a kid fails they send a letter to the parents informing them that their kid needs some more practice.\n\nRegarding my kid, Felix, I had informed him beforehand that as MY son, I would tease him until the end of time if he failed. He didn't and I knew he wouldn't.\n\nYou can, however, see how the Culture of Fear has influenced things even here in Denmark. In the emails leading up to the day it was stated that helmets had to be worn. I informed the teacher responsible that Felix doesn't wear a helmet and a longer discussion ensued. It's clear that the Danish Road Safety Council have influenced a lot of people with their wacko ideology. I was informed that the school's traffic policy requires helmets. I looked it up - it doesn't. They merely \"urge\" students to wear them. I was told he could borrow a helmet. I asked if they were washed and disinfected. They weren't.\n\nThen I was told it wasn't up to the school but that I would have to talk to the Danish Road Safety Council or the police. I responded that the Road Safety Council is just an NGO and has no power and the police merely refer to the Danish traffic law which doesn't require helmets. At the end of the day I was told I could sign a form exempting Felix from wearing a helmet. Fine. Except there is no form and Felix just did as he pleased.\n\nThis is not America, but sometimes you wonder if it is. The battle for rationality and respect for science continues.\n\nThe main takeaway for me today was seeing eighty kids riding like bosses. Owning it. Rocking the old cycling test and having fun doing it. Cheering their fellow students when they left the start area. Cheering when they got back. It was awesome. Felix is totally pre-teen at the moment but he was clearly proud to complete the test. And I'm a proud dad.\n\nNext up is The Lulu. She's in 1st grade but she already owns it. She'll be awesome, too, by the time the test comes around in five years.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nThe Best Bike Story This Week\n\nYesterday I took back ownership of my own Bullitt cargo bike, when The Lulu and I picked it up at Larry vs Harry. You might have heard it was stolen back in March. After a week or so, I resigned myself to never seeing it again. I lived in hope, because another time it was stolen, the Danish internet helped me get it back.\n\nOn Sunday evening, I got this photo sent via MMS and on Facebook. WTF. My bike parked outside Larry vs Harry. It was found at Christiania by a guy named Danni and taken from there and put outside Larry vs Harry. An amazing story. I called Danni and he was all like \"no problem...\".\n\nI got the details of the story yesterday when we picked it up from Claus. And it is amazing.\n\nI realised I know Danni. I chat with him every year at the Svajerløb - Danish Cargo Bike Championships and I chatted with him at the recent bike flea market. Ironically, about whether or not I had found my Bullitt.\n\nDanni's own Bullitt is well-known here. He extended the frame to make it extra long. This shot is from the flea market a few weeks back. He has a kid around the same age as The Lulu, too.\n\nSo it turns out Danni was out for a ride on his motorcycle and ended up at Christiania. He saw three Bullitts behind the Månefiskeren café and he recognised one of them. Mine. Still with the map of Copenhagen on the cargo bay and even the Copenhagenize Design Co. logo sticker intact.\n\nDanni rode his motorbike home to Hvidovre - a suburb of Copenhagen - and returned with his minivan. He put my Bullitt in the back and went to a bike shop to buy a lock. He then drove it to Larry vs Harry and locked it outside the shop. He let Claus from Larry vs Harry know it was there and he, in turn, notified me.\n\nHow amazing is that. 30 km and a couple of hours out of his day. Just to get the Bullitt back for The Lulu and I.\n\nI'm speechless. Grateful. Amazed.\n\nThanks Danni. The Lulu is making him a drawing and I'll figure out a suitable gift.\n\n↧\n\nLego and Bicycles - Together Forever\n\nWhen you live in a home with over 20 kg of Lego, using it comes naturally. I noticed five years ago that I didn't have a lot of Lego bicycles. I soon discovered that they are rather hard to come by, despite the fact that Lego is, of course, Danish. In America, for example, the quickest way to get a Lego bicycle is buy the ambulance set. Seriously. Selling fear of cycling in a Lego box.\n\nBut back in 2011 I wanted to do a rendition of the Copenhagen rush hour in Lego bicycles. I stripmined eBay in four countries buying bikes and mini-figures that resembled normal people. Finally, shot a series of photos like the one up top.\n\nMy inspiration also had a root at the Legoland theme park. I spotted this cyclist, above, from the age before the mini figure, which makes them awesome. From the age before rubber tires and asphalt, too, it would seem - so even more respect.\n\nLooking around the internet I discovered that there are/were sets that featured Lego bicycles, as you can see above. Then, of coursre, I discovered a nerdy website listing all Lego sets with bicycles in them. Ever.\n\nHere are some photos from the original Lego rush hour shoot back in May 2011:\n\nI tried to get all sorts of different people represented. Workers, doctors, parents, you name it.\n\nLate last year I did another shoot, featuring more bicycles and style of citizens.\n\nFinally managed to get a cargo bike built.\n\nAt Copenhagenize Design Co. we make holiday cards with mini-figures featuring ourselves in Lego. That's me in the middle.\n\nWhat else can I pull out of the archives? Cycling home with Lego containers for storing... Lego? Check. And a photo from Sandra at Classic Copenhagen featuring Godzilla-sized cyclists at the Lego flagship store in Copenhagen.\n\nLego and urbanism? You bet. A few years ago the Danish Architecture Center (DAC) had Lego on tables on the City Hall Square and Felix and I hung around for ages constructing buildings. We always show up at DAC when they do Lego events.\n\nFelix and I also addressed a bit of urban decay with a Lego-based urban infill solution across the street from our house.\n\nWhen speaking in San Francisco back in 2009 I rode in the Halloween Critical Mass and met this fabulous local with her home-made Lego accessories. Wasn't a fan of the critical mass thing, though.\n\nNo bikes here, but Felix and I made this chess set years ago and it is still used. The most Danish thing I know.\n\nLego can be used in many ways. The Danish version of the morons on the left are right here. You have your version, I'm sure.\n\nBut hey. Lego ain't going anywhere. Bicycles ain't going anywhere. I'm going to keep on combining the two.\n\n↧\n\nThe Desire Lines of Cyclists – The Global Study – is in the starting block\n\nCopenhagenize Design Co. has decided to take our unique Desire Lines Analysis Tool to the world. We are launching a new project that will span continents.\n\nThe Desire Lines of Cyclists – The Global Study – is the natural evolution of our original Desire Lines analysis of cyclist behaviour and how cyclists react to urban design called The Choreography of an Urban Intersection. The results of which were unveiled by CEO Mikael Colville-Andersen at Velo-City 2013 in Vienna. This study from Copenhagen in 2012 was based on video-recorded observations of 16,631 cyclists during a 12 hour period. We explored the anthropological details of bicycle users and how they interact with other traffic users and the existing urban design. Three categories of cyclists were identified: Conformists, Momentumists, and Recklists.\n\nChoreography of an Urban Intersection and Copenhagenize fixes\n\nThanks to this study we created a new methodology to analyse urban life: the Desire Line Analysis Tool, which is designed mostly to decode the Desire Lines of cyclists. The main purposes of the analysis is to get a thorough understanding of bicycle users and to rethink intersections to fit modern mobility needs. Like William H. Whyte before us, we want first to observe people. We employ anthropology and sociology directly to urban planning - something we feel is sorely lacking.\n\nWith increasing focus on re-establishing the bicycle as transport in cities around the world, understanding the behaviour and, indeed, the basic urban anthropology of bicycle users is of utmost importance. Rethinking the car-centric design of intersections and infrastructure is necessary if we are to redesign our cities for new century mobility patterns.\n\nDesire Lines of cyclists turned into a permanent lane in Copenhagen\n\nUntil now there has not been any concrete way of mapping cyclist behaviour. Copenhagenize Design Company’s techniques utilise Direct Human Observation in order to map cyclist behaviour - and gather a motherlode of valuable data from it.\n\nThese two last years at Copenhagenize, urban planners, anthropologists and urban designers have worked on testing, improving and realising new studies in Copenhagen. Using the city as an actual-size laboratory, we observed, analysed, mapped thousands of cyclists' behavior. You can watch our video here, and read our studies here, here, here, here, and here.\n\nAfterwards, we went to Amsterdam, a city considered as a model for many urban planners, and in collaboration with The University of Amsterdam, Copenhagenize Design Co. worked on nine intersections and 19,500 bicycle users.\n\nCyclists riding side by side in Amsterdam\n\nNow, we want to expand our proven methodology to other cities around the world and compare different approaches of bicycle urbanism focusing on the way cyclists react to urban design. This study will take us to Europe, South and North America, Asia and Africa.\n\nCycling is booming everywhere in the world and municipalities are investing in infrastructure across many cities. Nevertheless, data are lacking and a deep understanding of cyclists' behavior and expectations is required. It’s the right moment to get a thorough understanding of the current situation and avoid well known hurdles in the design of infrastructure to match cyclists expectations.\n\nWe will start this global study in the two world-wide bicycle friendly cities, Copenhagen and Amsterdam, and use them as references of the study.\n\nThen, we will study intersections in Cape Town (South Africa), Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Mexico City (Mexico).\n\nFinally, we will analyse bicycle users crossing an intersection in New York City (US), Paris (France) and Tokyo (Japan). 3 metropolis, 3 different ways to design urban infrastructure and to manage cycling policy.\n\nCyclist on a Vélib in Paris sharing the lane with buses\n\nWe will compare all these cyclists and figure out the balance between the behaviour due to varying infrastructure - or lack thereof - and the bicycle culture/habits of the inhabitants. We’ll highlight both the cultural differences and the universality of human behaviour. We truly believe that well-designed infrastructure leads to better behaviour from cyclists - whereas the lack of consideration for cyclists when municipalities design bike infrastructure leads to negative behaviour.\n\nIn each city we will team up with a local partner, and we are extremely glad to announce that we will work with the organisations Future Cape Town, ITDP Brazil and 3x3 in New York City.\n\nCopenhagenize is also keen on working in close cooperation with the local authorities and has already get the support of the municipalities of Paris and Amsterdam. Our local partners and us are searching for financial support to make the most of the project in each city.\n\nThe more data and knowledge that will be gathered on cyclists, the higher the chances are that towns will be turned into bike-friendly cities with all the right infrastructure.\n\nThe results will be presented using maps, statistics, qualitative analyses and appealing graphic representations. We will reveal how people respect or disrespect infrastructure, how they interact with pedestrians and motorists, what are their normal trajectories and Desire Lines. All bicycle-friendly cities should have a perfect knowledge of the evolution of the number of cyclists, but also a sociological big picture of them and a deep understanding of their behavior.\n\n↧\n\nBike Share by the People, For the People\n\nSaw a lovely thing in my neighbourhood today. Copenhagen's new bike share system. Parked right there under a tree. In contrast to the failed one still operating, this system is free, it doesn't have safety issues with a distracting tablet screen, it doesn't weigh as much as a hippopotamus, it doesn't have a noisy motor and it doesn't have constant tech issues at a docking station.\n\nThe sign on the side reads:\n\n\"Hi, my name is Christian Liljedahl and I've made this City Bike (bycykel) for Copenhagen and for you. Use it and park it somewhere useful so others can enjoy it when you're finished.\n\nIf it's flat or broken, send me a text on (telephone number) or donate a puncture repair at the closest bike shop. You can also make your own City Bike. Find out more on DinBycykel on Facebook.\"\n\nThis is brilliant. This made my day. In a country where 400,000 bikes are scrapped every year and The Establishment (City of Copenhagen, City of Frederiksberg, Danish Railways, Danish Cyclists Federation) all insist on lame solutions like the GoBike ($10,000 per bike), People Power is fantastic.\n\nMore of this, please.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nHacking a German \"Safety\" Campaign with Rationality\n\nNice with a bit of activism and rationality on a Saturday. Thanks to our reader Jochen, who sent us some photos from the streets of Germany in reaction to a campaign from the German Ministry of Transport, above. Next to a photo of Darth Vader the text reads: \"The saga continues, thanks to the helmet. Works in every galaxy. And on the bicycle.\"\n\nThis set cyclists and activists to task.\n\nBillboard in Bonn: \"Now I'm single... thanks, helmet.\"\n\nPhoto: Jochen Erdelmeier\n\nIn a country where only about 10% of cyclists wear plastic hats, the Ministry of Transport decided to chuck some taxpayer money into a campaign. A lazy move from politicans whose ignorance about the importance of encouraging cycling, building infrastructure and the health benefits of a cycling population has now been broadcast to the planet. They are basically using taxpayer money to advertise how ignorant they are. There's the first problem with their campaign.\n\nThe choice of Darth Vader is as strange as it is awkward - for the Germans. World War II Nazi helmets were the direct inspiration for Vader's helmet, as you can read here:\n\n\"Costume designer John Mollo took it from there, fusing elements of various real-life uniforms associated with war and evil. To design Vader’s infamous black helmet, Mollo looked to the black, shiny headgear Nazis wore during WWII.\"\n\nOne might argue that Mr Vader is not exactly an appropriate role model. One of the first things his mentor, Mr Hitler, did when assuming power was make Germany's largest cyclist organisation illegal. (they were also socialists, which was handy).\n\nThe Ministry also willfully ignores the advice of the European Council of Ministers of Transport in 2004 - which included the German Minister of Transport at the time - in a report entitled National Policies to Promote Cycling:\n\n\"[...] from the point of view of restrictiveness, even the official promotion of helmets may have negative consequences for bicycle use, and that to prevent helmets having a negative effect on the use of bicycles, the best approach is to leave the promotion of helmet wear to manufacturers and shopkeepers. The report entitled 'Head Injuries and Helmet Law for Cyclists' by Dorothy L. Robinson, Bicycle Research report No. 81 (March 1997) shows that the main effect of the introduction of the general helmet law for cyclists in Australia was a drop in bicycle use.\"\n\nEven research from the German Hannelore Kohl Stiftung was happily swept under the rug:\n\nBe sure to check www.motoringhelmet.com for more reasons why driving with a helmet is a good idea. It links to our blog articles about the subject.\n\nImagine. The Ministry of Transport in Europe's largest country completely and utterly Ignoring the Bull in Society's China Shop.\n\nBut hey. Shortly after appearing, billboards around Germany that featured the Darth Vader campaign began to feature added text. The Force is strong within the rational Jedi fighting for liveable cities...\n\nThe saga continues in Bonn. This billboard now reads: \"I have dandruff. Thank you, helmet.\"\n\nPhoto: Jochen Erdelmeier\n\nBonn: \"I am a monster. Thanks, helmet.\"\n\nPhoto: Jochen Erdelmeier\n\nAnd from Frankfurt: \"Works in every galaxy.

Crédit photo : Louis-Philippe Tessier. A French translation of this article follows the English text.\n\nIt's our great pleasure and honor to see numerous people, from all over the world, coming through the door of Copenhagenize's office, in order to meet us and have a chat about bicycle urbanism. For the Copenhagenize's team, it's always an opportunity to share our knowledge and experience. We explain the distinctives features of Copenhagen while learning the latest best practices from our visitors' cities. A few months ago, it's Clotilde, our French urban planner, who received Louis-Philippe Tessier, student in Environmental Sciences, who had just arrived from Geneva (Switzerland) to do fieldwork for his Master these.\n\nIt was the opportunity to get information on the cycling culture in Geneva and to know which best-practices Louis-Phillipe could bring back to Switzerland.\n\n(article written by Louis-Philippe and Clotilde following their discussion)\n\nThe 2015 Velo-city conference, held this year in Nantes between June 2nd and 5th, has one main objective: bringing together numerous experts on “bicycle urbanism” from across the world so as to facilitate the exchange of best practices and necessary knowledge to promote and develop urban bicycle usage. For three days, participants will also be able to let themselves be inspired and to take a breath of fresh air in a world which is often polluted by negative thoughts. But a question remains: are these transfers of knowledge even possible? Are local authorities even receptive to foreign best practices?\n\nLouis-Philippe’s Masters thesis partly sought to explore this theme. Its main goal was to study Geneva’s cycling infrastructures and policies so as to identify a certain number of elements hindering the development of bicycle usage in this city. Ultimately, the recommendations put forward in the thesis were inspired from a number of best practices taken from Copenhagen.\n\nObstacles in Geneva, solutions in Copenhagen\n\nFour obstacles were identified in Geneva:\n\n1. A negative perception of bicycles and their users\n\n2. Few measures aimed at restricting car usage\n\n3. The existence of a logic of opportunity\n\n4. The particularities of the city’s urban form\n\nBike lanes represent 20% of the whole bicycle network in Geneva (CH). Crédit photo : Louis-Philippe Tessier.\n\nPossessing numerous years of expertise in the field, Copenhagen has become a model for cities across the world wishing to promote bicycle use amongst their citizens. To each obstacles identified in Geneva, Copenhagen could provide proven solutions.\n\nConcerning the first one, the nordic city would promote its communication strategy aimed at reinforcing the positive aspects of cycling in cities, which is very well presented in its official Bicycle Strategy. As Stefan Gössling puts it, by reading this document one understands that cycling “is pleasurable for everyone.” (2013, p. 201).\n\nResponding to the second obstacle, Danish planners would suggest that it is more economically sound to replace car parking by separated bike lanes or bicycle parking spots. If one car can fit on one parking spot, there can be up to eight bicycles parked there, which represents more potential customers to nearby shops. In Geneva, a local law states that any removed car parking must be replaced in the vicinity. If one also takes into account the cost of acquiring the space needed for this new parking spot, one is left with a messy bureaucratic and political bottleneck.\n\nThe third obstacle concerns the way urban planners develop the cycling network. Rather than drafting a concrete and detailed bicycle plan for the city, they very (too) often grab the opportunities passing under their noses. This means, on the one hand, that they need to be continuously aware of developments occurring throughout the city, but it also means that the cycling network ultimately becomes like a Swiss cheese: full of wholes. What they don’t tell you is that Swiss cheese in fact does not contain any holes;it’s just a misconception. Similarly, a good bicycle network should not have any holes.One picture of Copenhagenize’s Traffic Planning Guide II reminds us of that!\n\nComing back to the initial question of this article, it helps to look now at obstacle #4. When Geneva’s bicycle strategy was being voted in 2013, one deputy, who was explaining why the modal share of bicycles in Copenhagen was so high, was interrupted by voices shouting that the city was flatter than Geneva. In other words, according to them, it is not possible to transfer Copenhagen’s model because of the specific topography of the city. On one point they are right: every city is unique, facing different kinds of challenges and obliged to implement solutions adapted to the socio-politico-economic conditions. But this is not to say that planners cannot be inspired by foreign best practices. In fact, it has often been the case. Today’s cities are good examples since most of them were deeply and similarly transformed in the 50s and 60s by the automobile. Best practices can be exported to other cities as long as they respond to specific needs by local cyclists. One such example is Trondheim’s bicycle lift, which acts as an elevator helping cyclists go up a steep hill. Another one is, more generally, San Francisco’s increasing bicycle modal share, which could be attributed to the implementation of foreign best practices at certain intersections throughout the city (SFMTA, 2013, p. 6). San Francisco being a hilly city, this shows how geographical features may not have the same importance as the social, political, and economic context when developing a cycling city.\n\nLanes shared by cyclists and buses represent 4% of the network of bicycle infrastructure in Geneva (CH).

With environmental problems becoming more apparent, and urban populations continuously growing, many cities have began to densify. In highly dense cities such as Geneva, numerous actors often declare that few things can be done to improve transport conditions. Space scarcity is often the culprit. It is true that there are only a limited amount of users which can use a specific road. But is it more a question of space, or rather a question of which transportation mode should be prioritised in cities? Can a road lane be converted into a separated bike lane? Of course! What may vary between cities is the degree of political will to retrofit the urban landscape so as to prioritise more sustainable modes of transportation, in this case the bicycle. We are far from Copenhagen’s “Cyclists first” policy. But ultimately, as Andersen et al. declare, “all things being equal, urban density increases bicycle traffic“ (Andersen et al., 2012, p. 40). Thus, our politicians should really focus on finding adapted solutions to the urban density problem, rather than feeding the idea that their cities are not adapted to the bicycle.\n\nThis debate raises another question: is there an optimal urban density to efficiently develop safe, continuous and comfortable bicycle infrastructures?It is difficult to answer such a question since we are not only talking about technical details pertaining to physical infrastructures, but we are also addressing the ways that politics is conducted in every city. The nature of the arbitration between the actors directly and indirectly involved in the mobility system of a city, is crucial to take into consideration when on seeks to import best practices from cities such as Copenhagen. Solutions are manifold and come from various places across the world; this is one of the reason why the Velo-cityconference is such an important event for urban planners. Here are some examples taken from Copenhagen, which were contrasted to challenges still existing in Geneva (in French):\n\nUltimately, transferring knowledge and best practices is important but a particular focus should be put on understanding how politics is being conducted, and what elements strongly influence the planning process. Not doing so puts us at risk of being told that the city is not flat enough!\n\nVERSION EN FRANCAIS\n\nDe Copenhague à Genève, discussion sur l'intérêt d'exporter le modèle cyclable danois\n\nDe nombreux visiteurs, venus du monde entier, passent la porte de nos bureaux à Copenhague, afin de venir discuter des infrastructures cyclables locales. Pour nous, à Copenhagenize Design Co., nous prenons toujours ces discussions comme un moment d'échanges et de partage de connaissances. Nous expliquons les particularités de Copenhague et nous apprenons les dernières nouvelles des politiques cyclables étrangères.\n\nIl y a quelques mois, c'est Clotilde, notre urbaniste française, qui recevait Louis-Philippe Tessier, étudiant en Sciences de l'Environnements, tout juste débarqué de Genève, pour venir faire du terrain dans le cadre de son mémoire.\n\nVoici donc l'occasion de faire découvrir la culture cyclable de Genève et de donner une idée des « bonnes pratiques » que Louis-Philippe a rapporté dans ses bagages.\n\nL’édition 2015 des conférences Velo-city se tiendra cette année à Nantes entre le 2 et 5 juin. L’objectif: réunir une multitude d’experts et d’adeptes du vélo afin de partager connaissances et bonnes pratiques en matière d’aménagement d’infrastructures cyclables et de promotion du vélo en milieu urbain. Outre l’occasion de côtoyer des personnes tout aussi convaincues que le vélo est un mode de transport réellement (vélo)rutionnaire, ce transfert d’informations est-il efficace et même possible ? Les autorités locales sont-elles réceptives aux pratiques “étrangères” ?\n\nLe mémoire de maîtrise de Louis-Philippe, cherche justement à effectuer une analyse du réseau cyclable genevois et une recherche de pistes d'améliorations du développement du vélo dans cette ville, en s'inspirant du modèle copenhagois.\n\nDes freins à Genève, des solutions à Copenhague\n\nA Genève, il a été identifié quatre freins principaux au développement de ce mode de transport :\n\n1. Une image négative du vélo et de ses utilisateurs\n\n2. Une faible restriction des déplacements automobiles\n\n3. L’existence d’une logique d’opportunité\n\n4. La forme urbaine particulière de la ville\n\nAvec plusieurs décennies d’expérience en la matière, Copenhague représente un modèle à suivre pour ce qui est du développement d’une ville cyclable. Pour chaque frein identifié à Genève, des pistes intéressantes venues de la capitale danoise pourraient être explorées.\n\nPar exemple, face à l'image négative du vélo comme mode de transport, Copenhague mettrait en avant sa stratégie de communication positive, notamment expliquée dans le document Bicycle Strategy, laquelle explicitant le fait que rouler à vélo est “pleasurable for everyone”, tel que déclaré par Stefan Gössling (2013, p. 201).\n\nFace au deuxième frein, les urbanistes danois diraient qu’il est plus avantageux, économiquement, de remplacer des places de stationnement soit par des pistes cyclables séparées de la chaussée, soit par des places de stationnement pour vélos. Sur un stationnement automobile, jusqu’à huit vélos peuvent être stationnés, ce qui représente davantage d’acheteurs potentiels pour les commerces de proximité. À Genève, une loi locale oblige les autorités à compenser les places de stationnement supprimées dans un rayon restreint. Ajoutez un foncier rare et dispendieux, et vous obtenez un casse-tête bureaucratique et politique.\n\nLe troisième frein concerne la pratique d’aménagement des infrastructures cyclables à Genève : on utilise les opportunités qui passent, venant souvent de projets d’aménagement de grande envergure, pour faire une (petite) place aux vélos. Loin du plan structuré de Copenhague, où des objectifs clairs d’amélioration et de création de nouveaux tronçons sont déclarés, les pratiques genevoises, similaires à ce qui semble être fait dans de nombreuses villes, s’orientent vers la création de mini-tronçons ici et là. Résultat : une constellation de différentes infrastructures sur le réseau, parfois même sur un seul chemin, tel que celui des Coudriers, au nord-ouest de Genève. Où est la cohérence !\n\nLa question initiale - la transposition des infrastructures cyclables de Copenhague à d'autres villes - prend plus de sens encore lorsqu’on considère le frein n°4. Lors de l’adoption du Plan directeur cantonal de la mobilité douce en 2013, un député du Grand Conseil expliqua la forte part modale du vélo à Copenhague et se fit interrompre par des voix criant que “Là-bas c’est plat !”. Bref, on ne peut pas faire la même chose qu'à Copenhague. Toute les villes doivent conjuguer avec une topographie particulière, qui détermine les contraintes et les opportunités d’aménagement du réseau de transport. Et là aussi, en termes d'urbanisme cyclable, des solutions existent, même si cette fois-ci, évidemment, elles sont pas à trouver du côté du Danemark. L’important est de répondre au besoin des usagers. En Norvège, dans la ville de Trondheim, on trouve le CycloCable, une sorte d’ascenseur permettant aux usagers de gravir une pente particulièrement abrupte. D'autre part, à San Francisco, autre ville au relief accidenté, on a constaté ces dernières années une forte augmentation de la part modale. Il n'y a pas de déterminisme géographique car le contexte socio-politico-économique a une grande importance dans le développement d'une ville cyclable.\n\nUrbanisme cyclable et densité\n\nPour finir, un mot sur la densité urbaine et le vélo. L’apparition des enjeux environnementaux et l’accroissement de la population de certaines villes a fait en sorte que plusieurs d’entre elles se sont mises à densifier davantage le tissu urbain existant. Certaine ville, telle que Genève, possèdent une très forte densité urbaine que plusieurs considèrent comme un frein au développement du vélo puisque, soit disant, l’espace manquerait pour aménager des infrastructures de qualité. En effet, une route ne peut accueillir qu’un certain nombre de différents modes de transport. Mais ici, la question concerne-t-elle l’espace disponible ou plutôt l’arbitrage a effectuer entre les modes de transport ? Est ce qu’une voie de circulation ou de stationnement automobiles peut devenir une piste cyclable ? Bien sûr ! Est-ce qu’un large trottoir peut être scindé pour accueillir une voie cyclable ? Tout à fait ! Ce qui peut varier de ville en ville est le niveau de volonté politique nécessaire pour atteindre cet objectif de réaménagement en faveur des vélos. On est souvent loin du “Cyclists first !“ prôné par la municipalité danoise. Pourtant “all things being equal, urban density increases bicycle traffic“ (Andersen et al., 2012, p. 40). Il faut donc, tout de même, que nos décideurs soient capables d’utiliser pleinement le potentiel résidant au coeur d’une ville comme Genève possédant une aussi forte densité.\n\nBien que Copenhague ait réussi à se hisser au rang de meilleure ville cyclable au monde, il reste que la densité urbaine de la ville est inférieure à celle de Genève, ce qui a des implications pour le développement du vélo. C’est alors que l’on peut effectuer la réflexion suivante : plus qu'une taille idéale de ville, y a-t-il une densité optimale pour aménager des infrastructures cyclables sécuritaires, continues, cohérentes et confortables ?\n\nApporter des réponses techniques venues de pays étrangers est une vraie bonne idée qui peut permettre de faire gagner de nombreuses années d'expérimentation et d'études aux villes qui osent aller chercher des solutions qui marchent au-delà de leurs frontières. Mais pour les faire accepter faut-il encore avoir le bon discours pour les expliquer, lorsque l'on revient dans son pays, afin que les habitants et les élus les acceptent et se les approprient, en y apportant leur touche locale. En effet, l'évolution de la mobilité s'inscrit dans des contextes institutionnels, politiques, économiques, sociaux et culturels propres à chaque lieu. Les solutions existent, qu’elles viennent de Copenhague ou d'autres villes représentées prochainement à Vélo-City. Voici un récapitulatif de quelques so"
