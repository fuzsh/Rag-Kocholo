        "text": "Video credits: Ultras World\n\nThe first Copenhagen Derby was played in September 1992 and ended with a 1-1 draw, just a few months after FC København was founded. In the years before FC København was founded, Brøndby IF had a rivalry with B1903, who, at the time, was the stronger of the two founding clubs (along with KB) of FC København.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was clear that a new derby and a strong rivalry was born in the Danish capital, with both clubs competing to be the dominant force in Danish football. Through more than 25 years, the derby has now developed into the biggest game in the Danish season, and the two sets of fans have developed their own fierce competition to be the dominant force of the capital. The tensions rise high in the week and days before the derby, as both players and fans prepare themselves for battle.\n\nA result of the fierce competition between the two sets of supporters is the amazing choreographies displayed in the stands during each derby which is often reported in the media, even beyond the Danish borders.\n\nBrøndby Stadium is located in the western suburbs of Copenhagen in a large area called ‘Vestegnen’ which is traditionally a working-class area, whereas FC København is played at Parken Stadium, located closer to the centre of Copenhagen, in the area of ‘Østerbro’, slightly north of the city centre. The distance between the two stadiums is 13 kilometres across the capital.\n\nThe amazing spectacular of the derby, both on and off the pitch, has attracted many football travellers and groundhoppers to the Danish capital.\n\nLow ticket prices\n\nMost football travelers will find the cost of tickets of Danish matches fairly low compared to the rest of Europe. Some clubs have got fixed ticket prices throughout the season, and some change the prices depending of the opponent and stage of the season.\n\nTicket prices in Denmark range from DKK 80-250 (€11-34 / £10-30) for most games and go a bit higher for important and decisive matches near the end of the season and the Copenhagen Derby, but don’t expect ticket prices higher than around DKK 400 (€55 / £48).\n\nDanish matches are rarely sold out and tickets can be bought online 2-4 weeks before the matches (find links to purchase tickets in the sections for each club in this guide).\n\nAC Horsens\n\nFounded: 1994\n\nCity: Horsens\n\nClosest international airport: Billund Airport BLL (55 km)\n\nStadium: Forum Horsens Stadion (Casa Arena) / capacity 10,400\n\nAverage attendance (2019/2020): 1,932\n\nTickets: achorsens.dk\n\nAbout AC Horsens\n\nAC Horsens was founded in 1994 after smaller local clubs joined forces to create a bigger and more powerful club.
