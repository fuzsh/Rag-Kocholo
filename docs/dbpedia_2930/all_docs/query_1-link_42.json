        "text": "It was the good harbour that created Kerteminde. This was the starting point for the profitable herring fishery and the lively trade with the rest of Denmark and overseas. The town got its municipal charter in 1413, and for centuries the coat of arms of the town showed a three-masted ship. The find of the old ship Ladbyskibet right outside the town proves that ships have sailed here since the Viking age, and it was exactly this Viking ship which was the inspiration for the coat of arms of the new Kerteminde municipality.\n\nNowadays Kerteminde is the quintessence of Funen idyll. Many of the small fisherman s houses and the old merchant s houses in the centre of the town have been preserved, and because of the small size of the town you can reach everything on foot. For instance the beaches of the town, the beach Lillestranden with fishing nets, small skiffs and tarred sheds and also the large marina with thousands of yachting ships.\n\nYou find the Sct. Laurentius Church in the middle of the market place in Kerteminde. The church is a three-aisled long-house linked under one enormous roof. Traditionally said to have been built in 1476.\n\nThe chuch was greatly altered in the 1600'es, when a vault was added and the furnishing was renewed. In the south chancel there is a chapel for the Iuel family, abouve which there are memory tablets for two of the parsons of the church. You find a pair of riding boots and a sword dated from the time of the Swedish Wars.\n\nOpening hours at Kerteminde Church\n\nFrom April 1st – October 31st\n\nTuesday – Saturday – 8:00 AM – 5:00 PM\n\nSunday – Closes after the service\n\nFrom November 1st – March 31st\n\nTuesday – Saturday – 8:00 AM – 4:00 PM\n\nSunday – Closes after the service\n\nThe sculpture stands at Kerteminde's Ny Kirkegård, where it was unveiled in connection with the new construction of Kirkegårds Allé in April 2014.\n\n\"The gate\" is a symbol of transition and transformation, but there are many layers of interpretation in it, Per Ahlmann told Fyens Stiftstidende. – It's probably a lot about what you yourself are already filled with – for some it's very nature, for others very physical, says Per Ahlmann, who made the sculpture after meeting cemetery manager Ulrik Christiansen and on the basis of a project, the potter had the sketches lying around.\n\nPer Ahlmann has made one other sculpture for a cemetery, and he has also made individual tombstones in ceramics. – It's quite special. I must have made about 15 ceramic gravestones, which are around the country. But it's something I'm working on developing - because the ceramics give me the opportunity to spend more time on design and the colours. And it is very special to be involved, says the artist.\n\nArtist Per Ahlmann\n\nPer Ahlmann, born 1965, can be described as a ceramic sculptor who operates in very close connection with his material. He produces works that combine the concrete with the abstract – sculptures that are simply sculpture.\n\nPer Ahlmann graduated from Denmark's Design School in 1995 and throughout his career has worked towards his characteristic expression, which unites concrete with abstract, material with concept and craftsmanship with art.\n\nAccording to Per Ahlmann, a sculpture is successful when it seems like a reproduction of something you should recognize, but is nevertheless completely abstract. The fact that the sculpture can evoke this sensation is based, among other things, on a form of obviousness which must be present in the juxtaposition and transitions between the sculpture's sub-elements. Furthermore, it is a distinctive feature of Ahlmann that it is specifically the potential of ceramics as a sculptural material that drives him.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the current estate owner couple – Vini and Rudolf Iuel – have awakened the estate from its Sleeping Beauty slumber. Together, they have made Lundsgaard a beacon both when it comes to cultural and nature experiences. So what Lundsgaard represents today is a modern take on how the estates can play an important role. Both as one of the local community's key players - and as a meeting point for ecologists, musicians, artists, researchers and creative spirits from all over the country. Often the whole world.\n\nPioneer spirit and proud traditions\n\nThe very special Lundsgaard spirit has arisen in the field of tension between Vini and Rudolf's interests and life experiences. Vini is a jazz singer, composer and creative director of the cultural center Anexet, which the couple has set up in the estate's former breeding buildings. She has previously lived in Brazil and New York. Rudolf was born and raised in Lundsgaard, descended from the naval hero Niels Iuel. In 1991, he took over responsibility for agriculture and forestry, which they changed to organic in 2008.\n\nWith its 2,000m2, the annexed cultural center consists of a large number of rooms with very different sizes and moods in addition to the concert hall. So you can always find the perfect setting for your meetings, parties or conferences. The large concert hall, the high-ceilinged gallery, the beautiful harvest festival hall, the cozy barroom, the rustic barn for more informal events and long table dinners, the two cozy cafes... or a mixture of it all. Among the recurring events is one of the country's finest chamber music festivals, summer festival, September jazz festival.\n\nThe breath of history\n\nLundgaard's history stretches all the way back to the 13th century, when a small castle complex was built in Storskoven and the 'farm by the forest', Lundsgaard, is mentioned for the first time in 1484 in the written source material. The current beautiful white Rococo main building was built by Jens Iuel in 1765.\n\nThe large stud farm facility was designed by the architect August Klein, who is also the man behind the beautiful barn and Herskabsstalden. It was built as a manager's residence for Agnes Henningsen's father. So here the writer and feminist, who later became the mother of PH, spent a large part of her childhood. It is nicely described in the 1st volume of her memoirs: Let Gang på Jorden and is also depicted in the Poet's Route for Agnes Henningsen, which will be inaugurated in May 2022 and which takes guests through Lundsgaard's forests.\n\nAround 1880, a 'constitution hill' was built in the park, where people gathered from near and far on Constitution Day. For over 100 years, it was completely overgrown, but in 2019 Vini and Rudolf woke it up from Sleeping Beauty, so that it has once again become the meeting point for the annual constitutional celebrations.\n\nIn the early 1900s, Lundsgaard Manor was a gathering place for artists and writers whom the 'theatre count' Frits Ahlefeldt-Laurvigs invited to both theater and concerts on the special 'theatre squares' he created in the middle of the woods.\n\nIn front of the main building, he set up a large stone on which he engraved: \"This corner of the world smiles at me more than any other\". That's how most people still feel when they visit Lundsgaard Gods. Because here you intuitively let the joy of life and the spirit grow.\n\nCafé\n\nLundsgaard Gods has opened its own café, Café Frits. See the opening hours at Café Frits on Lundsgaard Gods' website.\n\nGood walking routes in the area around the estate\n\nThe scenic areas around Lundsgaard Gods are ideal for walks. See more at the links below.\n\nOn the Accident Patient Association's website, you can e.g. see a map of good walking routes and a video that shows the access options for e.g. people with reduced mobility.\n\nSee the Accident Patient Association's video and map on the association's website\n\nAt the Viking Museum Ladby by Kerteminde Fjord you can step inside Denmark's oldest royal tomb. Here, a nameless king was laid to rest in his Viking ship more than 1,000 years ago. The museum contains Denmark's only ship grave from the Viking Age – an attraction of international format. The Ladby ship is atmospherically displayed as a burial chamber in a rebuilt burial mound exactly on the spot where it was found in 1935. Archaeological investigations have established that the Viking ship was pulled up on land around the year 925, where the dead king was buried in the ship with his horses, dogs, weapons and other valuable goods.\n\nExhibitions\n\nViking Museum Ladby's main attraction is the Ladby king's Viking ship grave; but is also a museum for the entire East Funen Viking Country. The exhibition \"Ladbykongens Verden\" tells about the Viking Age in a broad and general way. With the help of exhibited finds, films and artistic renderings of Viking Age East Funen, you can explore the world and daily life that the King of Ladby was a part of. In the \"Vikings' Wardrobe\", both children and adults can try dressing up in Viking clothes. Everywhere in the exhibitions you will also find many unique local metal detector finds that tell about people and gods in the Viking Age in gold, silver and bronze. The Ladby king's funeral is presented in the exhibition \"King and Warrior\". Here you can experience the illusion of being present on the day when the dead Viking king was laid to rest in his ship, ready for the voyage to the beyond. A full-size replica of the Ladby ship, recreated Vikings, dead horses and grave goods can be seen next to display cases with the original items from the grave. Furthermore, in the exhibition you can see the unique Ladby Tapestry – a seven-metre long embroidered tapestry inspired by the Bayeux Tapestry from Normandy. Here the story of the death of the King of Ladby and the discovery of his grave 1000 years later is conveyed - in colorful pictures.\n\nThe Ladby Dragon\n\nAll summer long, you can experience the reconstructed Viking ship, the Ladbydragen, lying and rocking in the fjord below the burial mound.
