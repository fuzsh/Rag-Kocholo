        "text": "Recent missions of Western Armies took place among the people, in foreign countries with very diverse cultures, while they had no clear understanding of the physical, cultural, and social environments that constitute the human domain. The United States (US) Armed Forces study “Decade of War” identifies trends during the 2001-2013 era of war on operating in this human domain, which ask for a fundamental change of doctrine, to address the root cause. Currently the Dutch Army (Royal Netherlands Army) tries to learn from the last decade of war too. Their lessons identified on the tactical level are comparable to those of the US Army. Because of the smaller scale of deployments, absence of a trends and root cause study, and lack of lessons on operational and strategic level, the Dutch Army missed some of the US lessons and the root cause. This thesis’ purpose is to help the Dutch Army to identify the trends in their lessons identified on operating in the human domain, including the root cause, and the feasibility of the US solutions, including those to address the root cause: a human domain and warfighting function “Engagement” in doctrine.\n\n: In democratic regimes, military subordination to civilian rule is a vital requirement. The civil-military relations (CMR) field of political science has been created to achieve and maintain that purpose. Yet the question of what military professionalism is still does not have a universally accepted answer. After Samuel Huntington published his highly inspirational landmark work The Soldier and the State (Huntington, 1957), CMR scholars started heated debates to create a certain and comprehensive theory of professionalism that would be eligible for all case studies, but none of these attempts has been completely successful. In his influential theory, Huntington (1957) defined military professionalism as a moral code which would prevent officers from pursuing political interests and oblige them to obey civilian rule (p. 158). That approach has been a criterion and a so-called goal for the Western militaries to reach since the Cold War. Having said that, in several cases, professionalism could not deter militaries from praetorian acts (Huntington, 1957, pp. 60–61). Hence, this paper will make a general analysis of military professionalism in the CMR literature. While doing this analysis, the paper will look for the answers to certain questions. What is the relationship between military culture and military professionalism? What are the normative and technical dimensions of military professionalism?\n\nThe world within which the military must function is becoming increasingly complex and uncertain. Society is constantly changing in ways which can often adversely affect defence interests. Social change and technological developments have a significant effect on military structures, management and leadership 1. The defence force is a part of society, but it does not operate in a civilian environment or according to civilian norms 2. A defence force requires its own stable and unique military culture to function effectively. It must foster and maintain its own culture as a \" protective blanket \" to insulate its members, enabling them to function effectively in their unique roles. It must allow its personnel to be protected from the distracting effects of change and instability in the civilian sector. The military culture also provides stability to the state 3. The major issues for the officer corps are quality versus quantity; management versus leadership; and careerism versus professionalism.\n\n\"This thesis (on the development of (post)modern soldiers) is a theoretical inquiry into the ontological and epistemological basis of skill-acquisition in an age of military transformation. As such, it deals with the comprehensive restructuring of the armed forces that has taken place in developed Western countries in the aftermath of the Cold War era, and its implications on the development of soldiering skills. Quite briefly, one can describe the transformative shift as a change from a large static invasion defense-based concept built on “civilian” conscripted volume-concerned mobilization forces with little more than basic skills, towards a smaller and more flexible expeditionary force-based defense concept dependent on ability-motivated professional military groups and units with well-developed “expert” skills. Within the academic literature, this shift is interpreted as being one of paradigmatic character which resembles the societal change of worldview from modernity (with its association to universalism, structure and objectivity) towards postmodernity (and its responsiveness to contextuality, complexity and constructivity). Therefore, from a pedagogical philosophical standpoint, this dissertation is, in essence, concerned with the development of soldiers in a transformational era from modernity towards postmodernity. Consequently, the main research question is formulated as being ‘How do we develop (post)modern soldiers?’ In driving the process three intriguingly simple yet essentially meaningful sub-questions have been put forward: 1) ‘How do we understand [military] skill?’ 2) ‘What is it to be [militarily] skilled?’ and 3) ‘How do we acquire [military] skills?’ In addressing the ontological and epistemological level of military skill-acquisition in this context, three aspects are investigated more closely; namely identity (as change in the being of a soldier), skill (as change in military conduct/soldiering) and learning (as change in how to become a soldier). The inquiry into the conception of identity implies a shift from a classic dualistic view of the human body where the mental and the physical are separated, towards a holistic view of human nature in which being a human [soldier] is expressed through an embodied presence in the world. Likewise, the investigation into the understanding of skill suggests a move from a universalist epistemology where (modern) skills are seen as being constituted of rules and maxims, towards a contextualistic understanding in which (postmodern) skill is expressed through action, judgment, valuation and assessment. And finally, the exploration of learning signals a change from scholastic instructional principles fostered in educational institutions, towards a non-scholastic learning style (observation, copying, participation etc.) situated in the everyday practice of the workplace/community of practice. When summarizing the main findings in this thesis it is implied that the implications of the military transformation, in regards to military skill-acquisition, propose a shift from a detached ontology, context-free epistemology and theoretical learning paradigm, towards an embodied ontology, situated epistemology and experiential learning paradigm. Keywords: soldiering; transformation; postmodern; identity; skill; learning; skill-acquisition \"\n\nIt is commonly accepted that the nature of military operations is one of such character that no matter how well you prepare there will still be an expectation of having to deal with the unknown and unforeseen. Accordingly, there seem to be reasons for arguing that preparations for the unpredictable should play a critical role in military education. Yet, military education as we know it seems to be characterized by a rather classic modernist view on education, which promotes an environment of learning that embraces uniformity and enhances scenario based pre-planned drills as ways of conducting military operations. In this paper I will argue an alternative perspective, one that embraces difference rather than uniformity as a means of developing military units and their soldiers. In doing so I will ground my argument in the academic discourse on postmodern education. It is my understanding that educational practices prone to postmodern thinking are embedded in narratives sensitive to constructivism, complexity and contextualism, and thus use emancipation, deconstruction, vocabulary, dialogue, diversity and aesthetics as pedagogical strategies in their creation of 'new' meaning. A discussion of these strategies in relation to the topic of 'the unpredictable' constitutes the main body of this paper."
