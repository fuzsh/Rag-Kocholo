        "text": "“My name is Francisco Wichter, Feiwel was my name in Yiddish. I was prisoner number 69.218. I am Jewish and I believe in the Ten Commandments. However, the horrors I experienced taught me that there is one more commandment: you will survive! That was my watchword and that of everyone who survived. That was the strength that kept us going and that sustains everything I’m going to tell you about.”\n\nWith these words, the only living Jew from “Schindler's List” who currently lives in Argentina, begins his autobiographical account. Survivor Feiwel Wichter also has a number tattooed on his arm. It's the lucky number - believe me. But perhaps the destiny reserved for Francisco Wichter was to always be put to the test; these providences of life that only reveal themselves in those moments of extreme pressure, long tribulations and the worst omens.\n\nA survivor of half a dozen concentration camps, Wichter is a man of solid principles. After losing his entire family in the war and saving himself through miraculous instincts, he entered number 371 on the famous “Schindler's List”, known worldwide through the Steven Spielberg film.\n\nBorn in the village of Marski, Poland, in 1926, he was the eldest son of a Jewish shoemaker. He had four sisters-Hanka, Rosa, Zlota and Sara-and a brother named Elias. When Third Reich Germany invaded Warsaw on September 1, 1939, the Wichter family fled to the countryside, hiding and resisting until 1943. During the lightning operation in the city of Warsaw, Francisco's father was arrested and Hanged by the Nazis. Days after this tragic episode, the family decided to meet with other Jews from the Belzitz region, in the center of the country.\n\nAt a family meeting of uncles, cousins ​​and friends, it was decided that Feiwel and nine other young people would go into hiding to try to survive the war. The rest, mostly young children, adults and old people, did not hide and were deported, disappearing into the gas chambers. He interpreted this family decision as a kind of eleventh commandment, the commandment to stay alive.\n\nFrancisco (Feiwel) Wichter spent months wandering the woods and forests of Europe. It was a terrible time. Guided by a sixth sense and, in order not to die in the great prison that was Poland, he decided to hand himself over to the Germans, being deported to the camps of Belzitz, Poniatov, Budzin, Mieletz, Wieliczka, until being sent to the camp of Plaszow, in Krakow. Feiwel Witchter's life would intersect with Schindler's.\n\nPlaszow was a small village on the outskirts of Krakow. In December 1941, the Nazis built a work and concentration camp there. Because it was nearby, it was part of a future evacuation plan from the Krakow ghetto. On March 13, 1943, this plan was implemented with extreme cruelty and all those Jews who did not perish in the evacuation were confined to Plaszow.\n\nWhen, in September 1944, the administrators of Plaszow were ordered to disable the camp due to advancing Russian troops (which meant sending its inhabitants to other concentration camps where they would be killed), Oskar Schindler convinced them, through bribes , which needed these specialized workers. In the same year, the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, together with the Jewish community of what was then Palestine and the Jewish community of Hungary, managed to set up a Committee in Istanbul, which, in turn, also opened another office in Budapest. According to Wichter, it was from this office in Budapest that a delegation of Jews left to make a concrete proposal to Oskar Schindler: he would receive “money, a lot of money, as well as guarantees and promises”, if he helped the Jews escape from the Germans”. This is how “Schindler’s List” was born.\n\nWho was Oskar Schindler? A German affiliated with the National Socialist Workers' Party, he was a former member of the Intelligence and spy service of the Wermacht (German army) for the territories of Poland and Czechoslovakia. An experienced career military man and businessman, he was always present at meetings promoted by the Nazi leadership. Married to Emilie Pelzl, he protected 1.200 Krakow Jews by “adopting” them as workers in his metal pan factory, located at 4 Lipowa Street, very close to the city's ghetto.\n\nOskar Schindler had taken control of a pot factory confiscated from Kraków Jews, in which Jewish prisoners from the Plaszow camp were sent by the Nazis to work without any pay.\n\nRegarding his work at the Schindler factory, Wichter comments: “Strictly speaking, among the 1.200 people who were in the factory (1.000 men and 200 women), many had nothing to do. I didn't have a job myself and I had to invent one. The factory could function perfectly with 500 workers. The 200 women never worked, they had nothing to do. We formed a group of 12 people to clean the place and carry out loading and unloading tasks. We were also given another task: taking coal to the plant. The factory had its own very well set up plant, it was a huge old Jewish factory that had heating in the winter. Then, someone would take potatoes to the kitchen, choose two very large ones and tie them to my knees under my pants. This way, without going hungry, we could share them with others.” Witcher further explains: “As Schindler had no training, three Jews took over managing the factory in his place. However, the group of workers working was constantly changing. Murders and deportations began to decimate people. Schindler didn’t like that…”\n\nWithout any prior knowledge in the industrial area, far from being advised by any Polish businessman and aware of the total lack of experience to be able to manage his factory, Schindler convinced the bloodthirsty officer Amon Goth (1908-1946), commander of Plaszow and one of the most feared members of the Schutzstaffel (SS), to keep their workers in the factory “permanently”. This request made it possible to save several Jewish lives. Goth and Schindler had developed a kind of friendship that allowed the German businessman to place the Jews who worked for him outside of Goth's lethal reach, in a separate subcamp within Plaszow.\n\nWith the rapid approach of Soviet troops in September 1944, this subcamp was closed and everyone was taken to the main camp, but Schindler bribed Goth with money and black market products so that his workers would stay alive. And, when the camp itself was closed, he spared no effort to ensure that the “Schindlerjuden” were transported to a basic war services factory in Czechoslovakia, so as not to be brutally murdered.\n\nAmon Goth became famous when he was portrayed in the film “Schindler's List” by actor Ralph Fiennes. One of the scenes shows some of his cruelties, such as his hobby of killing rural Jews by shooting a rifle from the balcony of his house. In another scene in the same location, after the camp is liberated, Goth is pushed off a chair to be hanged by Russian soldiers. In fact, he would be hanged nearby, after trial by a military war crimes court in Poland in 1946.\n\nIn 1945, with the Second World War over, still facing difficulties, but, with the help of a Zionist organization, Wichter managed to escape and reach Italy. From there he would embark with his wife towards Argentina, a promising but distant place, where he had living relatives. It is important to remember that the Argentine Consulate in Rome had denied him a visa because he was Jewish. Without any major alternatives, he decided to try to enter the country via Paraguay.\n\nWichter has lived in Argentina since 1947. He has always thanked the Schindler couple, especially Emilie, for saving his life. Emilie and Oskar lived together in Buenos Aires until 1957, the year they separated. He left Argentina for Germany, where he died in 1974. Emilie remained there, even in a precarious economic situation.\n\nThe repercussion obtained by Spielberg's film “Schindler's List”, a huge box office success released in 1993 and winner of seven Oscars, motivated Wichter to record his personal story in writing in the work Eleventh Commandment, published in Argentina by Emecé, in 1998.\n\nOn August 11, 2001, in a long interview given to the newspaper La Nación, Francisco Wichter revealed hidden details of “Schindler’s List. In it, he laments Emilie Schindler's departure to Germany, where she ended up being hospitalized after suffering a stroke. Wichter says: “There she will be alone again; here (in Argentina) at least she had me; she had more people, she had her environment, she was happy. Why take such a long trip?” And he cites the differences between Spielberg's film and the reality portrayed in his book, mentioned above. In his opinion, as it is not a documentary, the film is not obliged to be completely faithful to reality. But he states that the main objective of the film is to tell the story of “The List” and it does so in great detail.\n\nWhen released on the commercial circuit, the film caused him an enormous personal shock. Everyone who watched him cried profusely, even sobbing. Wichter confesses: 'After watching the film, one night I left the house and went to get some air, as I couldn't sleep. The film was still fresh in my memory, it was repeated and repeated, without stopping”.\n\nAlready at an advanced age, Francisco Wichter chose to write his personal story. He had two children and grandchildren in Argentina. His eldest son has already passed away. The book reveals that, until Spielberg's film was shown, he did not talk about the Jews on the List. It was a hidden, painful episode that greatly embarrassed the Jews. Nobody liked to talk or hear about the topic. The time was passing. The enormous success achieved by the work of the Jewish-American filmmaker was directly responsible for the tributes received by the Schindler couple.\n\nThe real role of Emilie Schindler (1907-2001) was much more central than what the film conveys. She worked hard to obtain food, rescued Jews abandoned in train carriages and fought bravely so that her husband's workers had what they needed to survive.\n\nWichter met Emilie at conferences and events organized around the film. Initially, she appeared alongside Enrique Sapoznick, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration and extermination camp. Shortly afterwards, an Israeli television report accused him of having collaborated with the “Angel of Death”, Dr. Joseph Mengele. The Nazi doctor was responsible for the medical experiments carried out in Auschwitz on Jewish prisoners. Sherit Hapleitá expelled Sapoznick from the association, and he died shortly afterwards.\n\nFrancisco Wichter met with Emilie Schindler several times, presenting her with gifts and money. He always contacted her by phone or visited her at her house. When Emilie suffered a stroke in November 2000, the biased and anti-Semitic Argentine media even accused the Jewish community of having forgotten her.\n\nThis was not true. The Hospital Israelita in Buenos Aires had already treated Emilie on a few occasions before the incident, free of charge. B'nai B'rith of Argentina, a central entity of the Jewish community, paid housing expenses and a cash allowance for living. The State of Israel also helped Emilie to support herself, granting her a lifetime pension and Germany, in turn, contributed US$650 a month. At the end of her life, at the age of 93, Emilie no longer spoke Spanish and communicated only in German, her mother tongue.\n\nEmilie was honored by several Jewish organizations for her efforts during World War II. In May 2, she received the decoration of the “Righteous Among the Nations”, awarded by Yad Vashem – Holocaust Museum, in Jerusalem, together with Miep Gies, the woman who hid Anne Frank and her family in Amsterdam during the war. At the end of the film “Schindler's List”, Emilie places a small stone on the grave of her husband, Oskar Schindler, along with many of the “Schindlerjuden”.\n\nEmilie Schindler died in a hospital in Berlin on October 5, 2001. She is buried in the Waldkraiburg cemetery, Germany, near Munich. On her tombstone are engraved the dates of birth and death, a cross and the following words: “Wer einen Menschen Rettet, Rettet die Ganze Welt”, that is, “Whoever saves one life, saves the whole world”, a teaching taken from the Talmud. As proof of his gratitude, Francisco Wichter dreamed of preparing a birthday party for Emilie, a few months before she turned 94. Unfortunately, her wish could not be fulfilled.\n\nBibliography:\n\nBruschtein, Luis, Surviving to tell the story. Page 12. Lunes 11 November 2002.
