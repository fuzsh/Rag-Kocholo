        "text": "Emilie Schindler, who helped her industrialist husband save hundreds of Jews from Nazi death camps in a saga memorialized by the movie ''Schindler's List,'' died on Friday night, her biographer said on Saturday. She was 93.\n\nShe died in a hospital in Strausberg, outside Berlin, where she had been since July 21, said the biographer, Erika Rosenberg.\n\nThe Schindlers, who saved at least 1,200 Jews, were celebrated in Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning film in 1993.\n\nMs. Schindler had contended, though, that the film overlooked her role in keeping the Jews alive. ''Oskar is the hero -- and what about me?'' she told German ARD television in a 1999 interview. ''I saved many Jews, too.''\n\nAccording to the Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, Yad Vashem, which gave her the ''Righteous Among the Nations'' award in 1993, Ms. Schindler prevented the Nazis from sending a trainload of 120 nearly starved Jewish prisoners to Auschwitz.\n\nOskar Schindler convinced the Nazi SS camp commander that the emaciated, frostbitten men were needed to work in his factory. Upon their arrival, Ms. Schindler nursed them back to health. None of them ever worked.\n\nMs. Schindler, who had lived in Argentina since 1949, came to Germany this year saying she wanted to spend her final days here. A retirement home in Bavaria accepted her, but she fell ill and was hospitalized at the MÃ¤rkisch-Oderland clinic.\n\nShe was born in a German-speaking village in today's Czech Republic, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She married Mr. Schindler in 1928 and moved with him to Krakow, Poland, where they ran a factory later used to harbor Jewish laborers during World War II.\n\nThe Schindlers immigrated to Argentina after the war, but Mr. Schindler returned to Germany in 1958, leaving his wife behind. Though they never saw each other again, they never divorced. Mr. Schindler died in 1974.\n\nThey had no children, and for decades, Ms. Schindler lived alone in Argentina, subsisting on a state pension until the film brought her more attention. She was awarded Argentina's highest honor granted to foreigners, the Order of May, in 1995.\n\nIn her memoir, ''Where Light and Shadow Meet,'' written with Ms. Rosenberg and published by Norton, Ms. Schindler portrayed her husband as a womanizer and as self-serving as he was generous.\n\nHer own recollections of scrounging for bread and medicine on the black market and begging for food for the Jewish laborers they kept were detailed in the book, illustrating her claims that her husband had not single-handedly saved their lives.\n\nAfter returning to Germany in July, she donated papers and other items that belonged to her husband to a history museum in Bonn.\n\nEarlier, she lost a legal battle to obtain a suitcase full of her husband's papers, including a list of the Jews who were saved, that a German couple found in 1999 and gave to the Stuttgarter Zeitung. The paper published excerpts, then donated the papers to Yad Vashem.\n\nMs. Schindler is survived by a niece in Germany."
