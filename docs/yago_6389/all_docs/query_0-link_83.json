        "text": "She died in hospital in Germany, after moving there from Argentina earlier this year.\n\nThe cause of her death was not announced, but she had been moved to a hospital near Berlin after reports that she had suffered a stroke.\n\nFilm\n\nOskar Schindler and his wife emigrated to Argentina after World War Two, but he left her in 1958 and returned to Germany, where he died in 1974.\n\nThe couple's actions in freeing hundreds of Jews was not widely known until Spielberg's film came out in 1993.\n\nIt told the true life story of how Oskar Schindler persuaded an SS concentration camp commander that the emaciated Jewish prisoners were needed to work in his factory.\n\nEmilie Schindler often spoke out that the film failed to acknowledge her part in the rescue.\n\n\"Oskar is the hero - and what about me? I saved many Jews, too,\" she told German television in a 1999 interview.\n\nNursed Jews\n\nAccording to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, which bestowed her with the Righteous among the Nations award, Emilie Schindler stopped the Nazis from transporting a trainload of 120 Jewish prisoners to Auschwitz.\n\nAfter her husband negotiated with the prisoners' captors, she nursed them back to health and none of them ever worked.\n\nEmilie Schindler was born on 22 October, 1907 in a German-speaking village in today's Czech Republic.\n\nShe married Oskar in 1928 and moved with him to Krakow, Poland, where they ran a factory, later used as a safe haven for Jewish labourers in the war.\n\nShe donated artefacts belonging to her husband to a Bonn museum, but lost a legal battle to gain ownership of the original list of Jews found in 1999.\n\nEmilie Schindler said it was her greatest and last wish to die in Germany."
