        "text": "“I saved many Jews, too – more than he [Oskar Schindler] did.”EMILIE SCHINDLER, OSKAR SCHINDLER’S WIDOW\n\nThe bitter widow of Oskar Schindler is demanding a hefty cut of the profits from Steven Spielberg’s acclaimed Holocaust movie, “Schindler’s List.”\n\nAnd Emilie Schindler says she’s willing to sue Spielberg if he refuses to cough up the money.\n\nIn an interview to be aired on German TV tonight, the 91-year-old woman argues that she did more than her famed husband to save 1,200 Jews in Nazi-occupied Poland.\n\n“I saved many Jews, too – more than he did,” Mrs. Schindler says.\n\nShe insists it was she – not Oskar – who signed the documents that brought more than a thousand Jews into her husband’s arms factory, saving them from death in the gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nWhen Spielberg turned Thomas Keneally’s novel about Oskar into a hit movie, the director didn’t seek her permission and never got her version of the story, she says.\n\nMrs. Schindler says while Spielberg sent her a check for $50,000 when the movie was made, it’s not nearly enough.\n\nNow she wants 6 percent of the box-office proceeds.\n\nThe 1993 movie, starring Liam Neeson (in the title role), Ralph Fiennes and Ben Kingsley, won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Cinematography.\n\nSpielberg could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nAfter World War II, Mrs. Schindler emigrated to Argentina with Oskar, and has lived there – now with her 20 cats and two guard dogs – since her husband abandoned her in 1957.\n\nOskar – who Emilie says fooled around with other women while they were married – died in Germany in 1974.\n\n“He didn’t behave well. But I don’t want to talk about it. He just left and I had to pay his debts,” she says on the program.\n\nSince the movie came out, Mrs. Schindler has met American, German and Argentine presidents and been received by Pope John Paul II, a Polish native who spent his youth in the area where the Schindlers had their factory.\n\nOne of the TV newsmen who interviewed Emilie, Michael Friedman, owes a great debt to the Schindlers. His own parents’ names were on the “list.”\n\n“Mr. and Mrs. Schindler are the motivation for my whole life,” Friedman said."
