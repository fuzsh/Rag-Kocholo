        "text": "Emilie Schindler, born Emilie Pelzl, on October 22nd 1907, had been the wife of Oskar Schindler from 1928 until his death. More unknown than Oskar Schindler, Emilie had massive influence upon him and his decisions regarding the Jews. After World War II had begun Oskar had left Emilie in Zwittau after moving to Krakow to seek profit from the war. Many believe Oskar was alone in helping the Jews, as things like Schindler's List, portray him as being the lone savior. However, Emilie had her own hand in assisting the effort while acting alone, proving she also had the ability to save the Jews in her own way.During the last weeks of the war, while Oskar was in Crakow, she confronted Nazis transporting 250 Jews in four wagons to a death camp. Although the situation was dire, she succeeded in persuading the Gestapo to send these Jews to the factory camp for the reason of, “continuing war industry production\""
