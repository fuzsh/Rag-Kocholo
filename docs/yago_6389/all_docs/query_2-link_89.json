        "text": "Oskar Schindler’s identity drastically changes from the beginning to the end of the movie. At first, Schindler was a greedy, selfish, and rich man, who was a member of the Nazi party and profited from the war. He also was a womanizer who constantly cheated on his wife. He only cared about making money and he only hired Jewish workers because they were cheaper. He saved his workers initially because he did not want to pay to train other workers and protected them since he believed that their welfare impacted his business. He saw Jewish people differently than other Germans, he saw them as workers, and he inadvertently developed a reputation for kindness. He did not do this at first to be a\n\nA famous quote from Oskar Schindler states, “If you saw a dog getting crushed under a car, wouldn’t you help him”? Oskar Schindler was an industrialist who was a figure of hope and optimism for the Jewish people during the horrific and appalling acts of the Germans. Many people contemplate if he was a savior or a sinner because of his involvements in the Nazi party. His works manifested the world and we think he was a savior and not a sinner. His profound works exemplify what it means to help people even in a time of despair, and hatred that embodied the world. The enormity of his works shows how one man can make an everlasting difference in our society. His profound career has had many impediments and successes along the way and he is widely\n\nIn 1943 the Krakow ghetto was closed. There was a proposal to move all the factories in the area to the Plaszow labor camp. Schindler objected and was able to get his officials to allow him to stay where he was. Then he began to start deceiving the Nazis. He was able to save more Jews because he told the Germans there was more work to do when there really was not. \"I just couldn't stand by and see people destroyed. I did... what my conscience told me I must do,\" (\"Oskar Schindler\"\n\nHe also wrote the memoir to help people see that Oscar Schindler was a hero for the Jews and that he saved so many lives, including the lives of Leon and his family. They, without a doubt, would not be here today without Schindler’s help, and the author didn’t want people to think of Schindler as a bad guy just because he was a Nazi. The tone that the author uses throughout the memoir is one of pain and suffering, but also gratefulness in spite of all of the torture. He looks back on his experience, and believes that he is lucky because he and his family survived when millions of others weren’t so lucky. This is very admirable because if most people had gone through this, they would feel nothing but self-pity. This memoir was a fantastic read, that gives readers great insight into the world of the Holocaust, and it vividly describes the pain that the Jewish people went through for years. The book gives readers a new appreciation for\n\n“Schindler hired a Jewish accountant for persuasion on recruiting. He went to poland went to the black market and made friends with the gestapo big wigs softened them up with woman and money and booze”. His new connection helped him get his new factory he ran the cheapest labor around the jewish, in December 1939 something changed poland was being torn apart he took his steps away from nazism and said “ if you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car wouldn't you help him?” schindler's jewish accountant put him in touch with a few jews that had some wealth left, invested in his factory and in return they would be able to work there. Schindler was making money but everyone in his factory was fed and no one was beaten.\n\nOskar Schindler faced many conflicts in his life. The main conflict he faced was overcoming the Nazis and saving over one thousand Jewish People. Schindler, with out a job at the time, joined the Nazi Party and followed on the heels of the SS when the Germans invaded Poland. This is when Schindler took over two previously Jewish owned companies that dealt with the manufacture and sales of enamel kitchenware products and opened up his own enamel shop right outside of Krakow near the Jewish ghetto. There, he employed mostly Jewish workers, which saved them from being deported to labor camps. Though twice the Gestapo arrested him, he got released because of his many connections and with many bribes. Most\n\nWatching Schindler's list I decided to focus on Oskar Schindler. Throughout the movie Schindler personal emotions change on the war. In the beginning we see that it was a good thing for business that nothing else mattered as long as he made money. When Jews would come up he wouldn't care about them because he knew he could manipulate them and earn more money since they needed him. Schindler didn't really care for the Jews and what would happen to them. We see that Schindler only concern is that his business profits in the war. His concern for going to parties were to make connection that would better his money earning business. Money was his only concern which is why he went out seeking a jew. Since having a jew made it so they could be payed less than a normal person and they would be to scared to not do work. If he got a Jew it would earn him more money than hiring a German accountant. After getting an accountant he goes and seek workers for his factory. The workers are Jews since they don't need to be payed to be working. We later learn that his wife influences him with making business and wanting to succeed. He came from a place where he had nothing and is just beginning to make it. Hes making so much money he doesn't know what to do and he thanks the war for that. With his business doing so well he starts to care about his workers. He cares about them because he needs them to continue making the money.He starts really caring about his accountant Stern he makes sure he\n\nAnyone who influences anyone else by saving or helping save his or her lives can be a hero. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. changed the lives of millions of people by bringing justice to minorities. Mahatma Gandhi, one of the greatest heroes, led a nonviolent revolution to free his country. Even a parent can be a hero to his or her child by leading them in the right direction. All teachers are heroes when they make it their job to teach a child anything that will help them in life. You don’t have to go to great lengths by risking your life to make a difference in someone else’s life."
