        "text": "Emilie Schindler, who helped her industrialist husband save hundreds of Jews from Nazi death camps in a saga memorialized by the movie Schindler's List, has died, her biographer said Saturday. She was 93.\n\nSchindler's widow died Friday night at a hospital in Strausberg outside Berlin where she had been brought for an undisclosed illness on July 21, writer Erika Rosenberg said.\n\nThe cause of death was not announced, but news reports when Emilie Schindler was hospitalized said she had suffered a stroke.\n\nThe Schindlers' campaign to save at least 1,200 Jews from the Holocaust went largely unnoticed until Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning film came out in 1993.\n\nYet Emilie Schindler often complained that Schindler's List overlooked her role. \"Oskar is the hero _ and what about me? I saved many Jews, too,\" she said in a 1999 interview.\n\nAccording to Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, which bestowed her with the \"Righteous among the Nations\" award in 1993, Emilie Schindler prevented the Nazis from sending a trainload of 120 Jewish prisoners to Auschwitz.\n\nOskar Schindler convinced the Nazi SS camp commander that the emaciated, frostbitten men were needed to work in his factory. Upon their arrival, Emilie nursed them back to health.\n\nMrs. Schindler, who had lived in Argentina since 1949, came to Germany this year saying she wanted to spend her final days here.\n\nShe was born Oct. 22, 1907, in a German-speaking village in what is now the Czech Republic. She married Oskar in 1928 and moved with him to Poland, where they ran a factory later used to harbor Jewish laborers during the war.\n\nThe Schindlers emigrated to Argentina after the war but Oskar returned to Germany in 1958. Though they never saw each other again before Oskar's death in 1974, they never divorced.\n\nIn her memoir, Where Light and Shadow Meet, written with Rosenberg, Emilie Schindler portrayed her husband as a womanizer and as self-serving as he was generous.\n\nHer recollections of scrounging for bread and medicine on the black market for the Jewish laborers were detailed in the book, illustrating her claims that her husband hadn't single-handedly saved their lives."
