        "text": "Emilie Schindler, who helped her husband to save more than 1,000 Jews from the gas chambers, has died in Germany, two months after fulfilling her wish to return home after spending over half a century in self-imposed exile.\n\nThe widow of the industrialist Oskar Schindler, who was a few days short of her 94th birthday, had been ill since July after suffering a stroke during a tour of Germany, where she was to settle soon in a retirement home in Bavaria. She died on Friday night at a hospital in Strausberg, outside Berlin, her friend and biographer, Erika Rosenberg, said yesterday.\n\nThe Schindlers went down in history for saving 1,300 Jews from the Holocaust. But their story might have remained largely forgotten had it not been for the book Schindler's Ark, by the Australian writer Thomas Keneally, which was transferred to the screen in 1993 in Steven Spielberg's award-winning Schindler's List.\n\nEmilie, who was born in 1907 in a German-speaking village in what is now the Czech Republic, married Oskar in 1928 and they moved to Krakow in Poland. There they ran the munitions factory which was later central to their efforts to hide Jewish workers. Oskar later compiled the famous list and paid Nazi commanders thousands of pounds to secure a workforce for his factory.\n\nIn 1949 the couple moved to Argentina, where Emilie remained until her return to Germany in July. Oskar abandoned his wife and left for Germany in 1957, leaving Emilie living alone in the Argentine countryside. The dozens of stray cats given the run of her dilapidated farm house were her only real companions.\n\nFor the next half century she survived on donations from Jewish organisations and pensions from both the Argentine and German governments. The Argentinians, who knew of her wartime role, nicknamed the eccentric old German woman 'Mother Courage'. Oskar died in 1974, before his wartime role became publicly known.\n\nIn recent years Emilie became increasingly bitter, feeling that she had been given insufficient credit for her role in helping to save the Jews. 'Oskar is the hero - and what about me? I saved many Jews, too,' she told German television in a 1999 interview.\n\nThis autumn the publication of Rosenberg's biography of her friend, I, Emilie Schindler, will reveal the full extent of the bitterness she felt in her final years, which she spent, according to Rosenberg, forgotten and apparently living in poverty, while her swashbuckling husband was feted - albeit posthumously - around the world. 'Emilie has suffered her whole life from being the woman in the shadow of a great man, when in fact their roles in saving the Jews could be split 50-50,' Rosenberg told The Observer. 'But she was cut out of the film and the book in a very humiliating and offensive way.'\n\nBoth Keneally and Spielberg staunchly dismissed claims that they had failed to give her money after the successes of their book and film. Keneally told The Observer that he had paid Emilie a sum agreed with her lawyer, and Spielberg is said to have given her a large payment after the completion of Schindler's List.\n\nIn 1993 she was awarded the 'Righteous among the Nations Award' by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial."
