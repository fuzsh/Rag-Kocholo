        "text": "Like her husband, Emilie Schindler was born to a German family in what would become Czechoslovakia. And, like her husband, she was fully committed to undermining the Holocaust by protecting Jewish prisoners.\n\nThough Oskar Schindler began his secret work before his wife arrived in Poland, Emilie quickly became an important partner after she joined him there.\n\nShe actively participated in the care of her husband's workers. She reportedly sold her jewels to buy medicine and supplies on the black market to establish a clandestine medical office for the workers.\n\nEmilie Schindler also played a key role in securing a location for a new factory that was created solely to protect her husband's workers. On the advice of some of his Jewish workers and confidantes, Oskar decided to create an armaments factory in Brünnlitz, Czechoslovakia, so that they could transport workers there, rather than to death camps.\n\nAs The Guardian reported at the time of Emilie's death in 2001:\n\nEmilie always insisted, however, that it was she – and not her husband – who signed the documents that saved the workers. She went to the mayor of Brünnlitz, her former swimming teacher, and obtained the permit that was to save their lives. In the event, the workers at Brünnlitz never worked, and the Schindlers spent much of their time trying to feed them.\n\nWhen asked why she had willingly risked so much to help so many, Emilie Schindler, who moved to Argentina after the war, replied:\n\nFor the sake of humanity, I say only: humanidad. I'll do it for anybody if it were in my power to help a human being. At those times it was in my power to help a person… I shall help for the sake of charity. Humanidad is my principle. I can't stand injustice. That's how I was raised… I learned it at my parent's [sic] home. Injustice, I cannot stand!\n\nSchindler not only put up with her husband's frequent infidelities, she also watched as his reputation eclipsed hers. When Thomas Keneally wrote Schindler's Ark, and then Steven Spielberg adapted it into Schindler's List, Emilie Schindler's role was reduced to an insignificant background player.\n\nSchindler's List features some of humanity's deepest atrocities – but also some of its simplest moments of hope. In one scene, two prisoners marry in a concentration camp. The scene, it turns out, was inspired by an actual wedding.\n\nKrákow-born Joseph Bau and his family were imprisoned at the Plaszów labor camp in Poland. Camp officers took full advantage of Bau's artistic skill by putting him to work as a map artist and scribe.\n\nMeanwhile, Rebecca Tannenbaum labored as a manicurist in the same camp – and always at gunpoint. The hands she attended to belonged to Amon Göth, who threatened to shoot her if she pricked his fingers.\n\nThe pair met at the camp and soon fell in love.\n\nBau and Tannenbaum arranged a secret wedding under the noses of camp guards. As Bau later recalled in his memoir, the wedding was quite different than the one depicted in the film:\n\nI traded four loaves of bread for a silver spoon, and for four more, the jeweler in the watchmakers' shop fashioned two rings from it. That evening, we performed a mini-wedding by the side of my mother's bunk. There was no rabbi, no guests or music, no mayonnaise salad. I just pronounced the traditional “Harei At…,” and Mother gave us her blessing.\n\nAfter saving the life of the mother of Mietek Pemper, one of Oskar Schindler's confidantes, Rebecca had a chance to be added to the list of people from the camp who would be saved – but there was only room for one name. Unwilling to leave behind her husband, she insisted that Pemper add Joseph's name in her place. Joseph went to Schindler's factory; Rebecca went to Auschwitz.\n\nMiraculously, both survived the war. After their reunion, Joseph and Rebecca Bau moved to Israel, where Joseph earned the moniker “Israel's Walt Disney.”\n\nWhen asked decades later why she gave up her place on Schindler's list for her husband, she said, “Because my husband was more important to me than I was, and I wasn't afraid.”\n\nIn early 1943, 24-year-old Leo Rosner was sent to the Plaszów concentration camp in Poland. Leo and his brother Henry had unique skills: They were professional musicians. Leo was an accordionist, while Henry was a violinist.\n\nCamp commandant Amon Göth soon took advantage of the men's talent. He required the Rosner brothers to play music at his camp parties. As Rosner later shared in an interview with the Imperial War Museum:\n\n[…] we've been called to camp Commandant – Mr. Göth – we had to put on dinner suit[s] and play at the door entrance, slowly we've been moving closer and closer until we were mingling among the German officers and others. They enjoy very much our music. One said the music is beautiful, even in such barbaric time[s]. And we'd been trembling all the time, knowing that anything may happen at any time. Finally at the end of the party, [Göth] said, you Jewish warmongers, out! That was a thank you. At one occasion he put the gun to my head and to my brother's head, and I had to drink a little vodka. I was still playing after this. I've never been drunk in my life except that time […].\n\nRosner's musical performances ultimately led to his salvation. Among the guests at one of Göth's parties was Oskar Schindler. Leo and Henry's performance apparently moved Schindler enough to include them on his list of Jewish prisoners.\n\nBoth Leo and Henry survived the Holocaust, continued to play music, and eventually moved to Australia.\n\nMietek Pemper had been living in the Kraków ghetto – the only part of the city where Jewish people were permitted to live – when all its residents were sent to concentration camps. Pemper ended up at the Plaszów camp. Due to his skills – he was a trained stenographer who understood German and Polish – Kemper was given a special assignment: He became the secretary to Amon Göth, the camp's commandant.\n\nKemper's position gave him a front-row seat to Göth's cruelty – and it also gave him an introduction to Oskar Schindler and access to mountains of documents. Kemper passed along information to Schindler and even helped convince him to use his position to protect Jewish prisoners at Plaszów.\n\nWhy did Pemper assume a significant risk by working with Schindler? “I wanted to preserve human life without having to resort to violence,\" he explained in his memoir.\n\nIn Schindler's List, most of Pemper's story is combined with Itzhak Stern's, who is presented as a composite character.\n\nBefore the war, Leopold “Poldek” Pfefferberg had been a teacher. But when Hitler invaded Poland in September 1939, Pfefferberg put his teaching duties to the side and fought with the Polish Army.\n\nPfefferberg and his family were soon confined to the Kraków ghetto. As Pfefferberg remembered, he met Schindler there:\n\nI met Oscar [sic] Schindler the first time when I was hiding from the Gestapo who [were] looking after me when I escaped from the Prisoner of War transport, and I was thinking that he's a Gestapo officer looking for me [….] He entered [my mother's] [apartment], my mother was very scared, she ask[ed] him what he wish[ed], and he said, “Don’t worry, I'm not here to arrest anybody, I am here to make business with you […]”\n\nSchindler hired Pfefferberg's mother to decorate his apartment. Schindler also ensured that the family had his protection by working in his factory.\n\nPfefferberg became a spokesperson for Schindler's story after 1945. In fact, author Thomas Keneally – whose historical novel Schindler's Ark was the basis of Spielberg's film – first heard about Oskar Schindler through Pfefferberg.\n\nAfter the war, Pfefferberg moved to Los Angeles, where he ran a store. Keneally happened upon the store, bought a bag, and mentioned he was a writer. Pfefferbrg replied he had “a story for you, I swear.” He proceeded to tell Keneally about how Oskar Schindler saved his life.\n\nYears later, Keneally credited Pfefferberg's role in bringing Schindler's story to the world. “Poldek was the spark plug, and I was just one piston in the machine. I see myself as a mere catalyst. I was not the great heroic instigator.”\n\nIn Schindler's List, Itzhak Stern – played by Ben Kingsley – is Schindler's right-hand man who helps run his factory and sees to it that the Jewish workers – of which Stern was one – have as much protection as possible.\n\nThe film doesn't totally align with the real Itzhak Stern. Born in 1901, Stern was well connected in Kraków before becoming an accountant to a German businessman. Like many of his friends and neighbors from Kraków, Stern was eventually deported to the Plaszów labor camp, where he worked in the office and had access to important information.\n\nStern first met Oskar Schindler in 1939 and later acknowledged, “there was something special about Schindler.” The two developed mutual admiration and respect for one another. Mietek Pemper described the relationship between Schindler and Stern as deeper than a partnership:\n\n[…] I would put it like this: while Schindler had other contacts for his professional activities, people such as bankers, his relationship to Stern – at least his relationship at that time – was on a quite different plane; it dealt with the saving of lives and the transfer of the factory from Kraków to Sudetenland – from where Schindler came. These were the different matters… and the relationship was characterized by the very great faith that Schindler had for Stern, and for Stern, on the other hand, the consideration was to do everything to save lives.\n\nBut the Stern that the film depicts is not the real Stern. Though Stern was crucial in helping Schindler save workers, he did not work at one of Schindler's factories until 1944, after a concentration camp specifically for Schindler's armaments factory had been created.\n\nWhy the disconnect between the real and imagined Stern? The Itzhak Stern of the film is actually a composite character. According to Schindler biographer David Crowe:\n\nSpielberg, or more appropriately his final scriptwriter, Steven Zaillian, intended Stern to be Schindler's subconscious, a composite figure encompassing three people: Abraham Bankier [who ran Schindler's factory in Kraków], Mietek Pemper, and Stern.\n\nNonetheless, the real Stern played a role in keeping open the line of communication between the prisoners of Plaszów and Schindler."
