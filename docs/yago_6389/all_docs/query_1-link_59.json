        "text": "Schindler's list is also Emilie's, though she never knew who created it—might have been Goldman, she said—three hundred workers from the factory Oskar 'bought' from Jews, seven hundred fifty from Plaschow, a few others. Emilie Schindler, the tiny woman who married\n\nOskar and stayed despite the betrayals, who saw her childhood friend, Rita, a Jew, murdered on the street by Nazis. Emilie, who never forgot and fought to save all on their list. Keeping them alive is also Emilie's story. Alone, going to the Nazi general—her old swimming teacher—\n\npleading for a permit to move the factory from Cracow to safer Brunnlitz, moving everyone, searching for food, selling jewels to buy on the black market, desperate to feed thirteen hundred [End Page 54] Jews and keep the factory looking busy, but making nothing. Rescuing Jews again\n\nand again, again Emilie's story—the female workers sent to Auschwitz despite all the bribes, finally getting them released, returned, fragile and emaciated, hand-feeding them her semolina porridge until they gained strength. And the last rescue of 250 Jews is also her story, mid-winter,\n\ntwenty below, packed in railroad cars, coming from slave labor in Goleschau. A soldier pounding her door in the middle of the night, telling her, 'Take the Jews or we shoot them'. Using a soldering iron to force open the frozen bolts. Pulling out the dead, their eyes glowing like coals, the rest barely alive.\n\nCarrying them into the factory-turned-hospital, spoon-feeding them until they remembered how to eat. And finally, twenty years after Oskar, Emilie's name added to the plaque in the Garden of the Righteous, after those she saved besieged Yad Vashem on her behalf. Who else would have saved them, they asked. Only Emilie."
