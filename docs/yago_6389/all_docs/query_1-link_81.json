        "text": "In Schindler’s List, Thomas Keneally writes, “Duty, as so many of their superiors would claim in court, was the SS genius.” As a leading paramilitary arm of the Nazi Party, the SS was brilliant at enforcing compliance in their ranks by appealing to a sense of duty, even when this meant committing atrocities. All of the antagonists in the book, which takes place in Poland during the Holocaust, are on some level motivated by a sense of duty. The Nazi Party is arranged according to a strict hierarchy, and even impulsive men like Commandant Amon Goeth restrain themselves when duty requires it. Duty overrides other moral questions, too, at one point turning the SS officer Albert Hujar into a reluctant executioner (since refusing to kill people would be to disobey a direct order, which he won’t do). But even righteous characters wrestle with questions of duty. Emilie Schindler, for example, considers it her duty as a Catholic wife to be faithful to Oskar, even though he has a much laxer interpretation of Catholic marital duty. This may be what ultimately leads to her save the lives of several prisoners as a nurse at Brinnlitz (a camp Oskar establishes near his home in Moravia to rescue the Jewish prisoners who worked for him in Cracow). Schindler’s List thus explores how duty motivated a wide variety of historical figures during this time, showing that duty can serve as an excuse for monstrous acts, but also that it can motivate positive change.\n\nDuty, in Schindler’s List, is frequently the motivation behind atrocities, and characters manipulate the language of duty to make violent actions seem reasonable. The Einsatzgruppen, known even within the SS for their brutal execution methods, were specifically organized around the concept of duty. A loose translation of their name is “special-duty groups.” In German, the name also recalls the language of medieval knights. The brutal extermination campaigns that the Einsatzgruppen carried out were therefore reframed as “Special Chivalrous Duty” in order to make them more palatable. Julian Scherner, the SS police chief in Cracow, provides another interesting example of duty in action. Keneally writes that Scherner “had reached that happy point in his career at which duty and financial opportunity coincided,” meaning that his orders from above to take wealth away from Jewish people—including money, land, jewelry, and other personal property—also personally benefit Scherner himself. Duty becomes a way for Scherner to justify his actions, both externally and to himself. Schindler himself notes the role that duty played in motivating German soldiers during a famous speech on his factory floor in Brinnlitz near the end of the war. He argues that “the little man who has done his duty everywhere” is not ultimately responsible for the worst war crimes of Nazi Germany. Others take up similar arguments to Schindler, suggesting that it was duty, more than malice, that led to the worst actions of the Holocaust. Keneally seems to treat Schindler’s statement with skepticism (particularly since a garrison of SS members is in the audience when Schindler gives the speech), but the book does acknowledge that duty leads to complicated moral situations.\n\nNot all duty in Schindler’s List is negative, however—the morally ambiguous nature of duty means that it can also motivate positive change. One of the most dutiful people in the book is Oskar’s wife, Emilie Schindler. Despite her husband’s long absences and many affairs, she remains committed to him because she believes this is her duty as a wife. Perhaps even more so, she remains committed to her Catholic faith. In Brinnlitz, she hangs a picture in her apartment of Jesus with an open, flaming heart—Keneally writes of how this symbolizes her own “ideological commitment” to opening her heart to Jewish victims of the war, which she does as a nurse while working at Brinnlitz. Oskar Schindler himself refers to duty during his famous speech at the end of the war. He says that he and his former Jewish prisoners have a duty to remain humane, rather than going out to plunder or seek vengeance. Schindler’s concept of duty is different from the Nazis’ concept, because it isn’t based on any sort of military hierarchy. Instead, he appeals to a basic human moral duty that transcends government and religion. This shared sense of duty helps all the residents of Brinnlitz unite around a positive goal, and ultimately, it helps them make it through the perilous final days of the occupation.\n\nKeneally, then, shows in Schindler’s List how duty is not a virtue on its own but how it can be made to serve virtuous causes. By doing so, he seems to argue that duty should not be allowed to act as an excuse for committing atrocities. Not all duties are equal, and Keneally places a higher value on the sort of altruistic duties favored by Schindler and his allies."
