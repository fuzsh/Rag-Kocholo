        "text": "LIKE millions of other people, Helen Rosenzweig saw the movie \"Schindler's List.\" Unlike other people she also saw in it herself, her family and friends that she will never see again.\n\n\"Five and a half years of my life are shown in this movie,\" said Mrs. Rosenzweig.\n\nShe often travels from her home in Colts Neck to tell the story of her association with Oskar Schindler, the German industrialist and Nazi Party member who saved the lives of more than 1,100 Jews in the Holocaust and sheltered many in a bogus munitions factory.\n\nMrs. Rosenzweig was 16 when her family was taken from Cracow's Jewish ghetto and sent to Plaszow, a labor camp in the city's outskirts. She met Schindler through his association with the camp commandant, Amon Goeth, who chose her as a personal servant.\n\nThe woman who portrayed the servant in the movie \"Schindler's List\" is actually a composite of Mrs. Rosenzweig and Helen Hirsch, another maid, who now lives in Israel.\n\n\"Since we were two Helens, Goeth decided to call her Lena and me Suzanna,\" Mrs. Rosenzweig said. \"Lena and I had a room in the basement, next to the kitchen, in the villa where Goeth lived. We were not allowed to visit the barracks where the other Jews stayed. Days we worked together and we alternated working nights.\"\n\nMrs. Rosenzweig risked her life regularly to visit her mother and sisters in the barracks. Her father had been taken from the ghetto before them and sent to a crematorium. Her mother was ill, but had to continue working. Without proper rest and care, she died in Plaszow. Mrs. Rosenzweig's sisters made it out with her.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
