        "text": "There are three ways to go when deciding on the birthday cake. The first is, of course, to make it yourself. If you’re not a cake decorator, like most of us, then you can opt to make or buy a plain cake, round or sheet, and place little film reels, film cameras, tickets, or other such movie themed pieces to decorate. And, guess where you can find those?\n\nEtsy, of course! You can actually buy fondant cake toppers from Etsy, which is pretty cool. They look awesome. Amazon also has some movie-themed items, but it seems they specialize more in the realm of the cupcake. Cupcakes are also totally acceptable in lieu of a birthday cake, and they’re really easy to make yourself! If you’d prefer not to, however, there’s always the grocery store. Then you can put the movie-themed toppers on and have custom cupcakes for the party.\n\nI remember my own birthday parties often had a cake from the bakery at the supermarket that had the general vibe of my theme, then my mom would put little plastic toys on top to complete the look. The clearest memory I have of that is my Winnie the Pooh themed birthday cake. You could easily do the same for your child’s cake!"
