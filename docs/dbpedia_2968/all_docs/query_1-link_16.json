        "text": "Formed in Melbourne, Australia in the late 1970s The Birthday Party were one of the most influential acts of their time. From humble beginnings they grew to command a level of respect around the world which remains undiminished to this day. Fuelled by the incendiary relationship between vocalist Nick Cave and guitarist Rowland S. Howard, they were frequently described as the most dangerous band in the world. Told in the group’s own words, MUTINY IN HEAVEN brings The Birthday Party’s story to the screen for the first time in a twisted tale of ascent, realisation and implosion whilst dealing with issues of addiction, fame and the unique relationship between creative vision and self-destruction. Directed by Ian White."
