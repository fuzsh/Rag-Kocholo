        "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow do I book my party?\n\nPlease use our rental booking tool. Rentals cannot be set up or paid for over the phone, through social media, or in person at the theatre. If you are planning a surprise party, please let us know in your booking notes, and please do not provide a phone number or email address the guest being surprised may answer.\n\nWhy isn’t the date I want on your rental booking tool?\n\nIf it’s not on the rental booking tool, unfortunately we can’t accommodate your request. Another renter may have booked your chosen date and time, or we may be hosting a public event at that time. We book five months out, so if your date is more than five months in the future, you’ll need to return later to book. We don’t accept bookings for parties less than 14 days away.\n\nI’m still planning my party. Can you hold a date and time for me?\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot hold dates. If it’s on the calendar, it’s available. If it’s not on the calendar, it’s not available.\n\nWhat can I screen during my party?\n\nYou can bring either a regular Blu-Ray or DVD. Please test your disc before your party. We can’t be responsible for a disc that doesn’t work.\n\nOur projector cannot play:\n\nFilm files saved on a flash/USB drive\n\n4K Ultra HD Blu-Ray discs\n\nAnything that must be streamed from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, etc.\n\nPlease consider timing constraints. Because all birthday parties are two and a half hours long, we recommend you keep the movie’s running time to about an hour and a half. That will give you time after the movie to enjoy food or dessert and load out on time.\n\nHow much time do I have to set up and clean up after?\n\nYou will have a 15-minute window at the beginning and end of your party to load in and out of the theatre. Because we book parties back-to-back, we are unable to give more time for load-in and load-out.\n\nFor a party that starts at 10:00 AM, you can load in starting at 9:45 AM, and you must be completely cleared out by 12:30 PM.\n\nFor a party that starts at 1:00 PM, you can load in starting at 12:45 PM, and you must be completely cleared out by 3:30 PM.\n\nFor a party that starts at 4:00 PM, you can load in starting at 3:45 PM, and you must be completely cleared out by 6:30 PM.\n\nHow many people can attend my party?\n\nWe can accommodate a maximum of 30 children. If your party exceeds this limit, we reserve the right to charge your credit card a $100 cleaning fee. There is no limit to the number of adults. We encourage a ratio of one adult for every five children to help redirect inappropriate or disruptive behavior, such as running around the theatre or climbing on the stage. That behavior will not be tolerated.\n\nWill your staff help during my party?\n\nYes, employees will provide popcorn, start and stop the movie, and help you keep things running smoothly.\n\nHow many tables and chairs do you have?\n\nWe can seat up to 30 children in the area of the theatre where food can be served. We have several 8-foot folding tables and can provide one extra table for presents if needed. We do not provide tablecloths, but you are welcome to bring your own.\n\nCan I come see the space before I book my birthday party?\n\nWe are typically closed during the day. The best way to see the space is to drop in 15 minutes before any upcoming event.\n\nHow can I decorate the theatre?\n\nAll decorating must be done in the 15 minutes prior to your party’s starting time. Candles are allowed on the birthday boy/girl's cake. Because we must clean quickly between parties, NO confetti, glitter, piñatas, or helium/floating balloons.\n\nCan I bring my own food?\n\nYes, you can bring your own food, cake, or drinks. Some people have pizza delivered to the theatre (Newtown Pizza and Meglio Pizzeria are close). We suggest having the pizza arrive right after the movie ends, so be sure to check the running time of your film. Alcoholic beverages are not allowed during children’s birthday parties.\n\nWhat’s your cancellation and refund policy?\n\nOur rental calendar fills up weeks and even months in advance, so if you need to cancel or reschedule your birthday party, please contact us right away.\n\nIf you cancel more than 14 days before your party, for any reason, we will refund half the cost of the party. If you want to reschedule, you must book your second party at full price.\n\nIf you cancel less than 14 days before your party, for any reason, we will not refund any portion of your rental fee. If you want to reschedule, you must book your second party at full price.\n\nIf your party cannot be held due to serious inclement weather (e.g., a blizzard or hurricane), we will work with you to reschedule your party at no extra charge. However, we can’t guarantee that we can reschedule your party close to its original date.\n\nI’m a member of the Newtown Theatre. Do I get a discount on renting the Newtown Theatre?\n\nYes, all Newtown Theatre members receive a 10% discount when booking the Newtown Theatre for a birthday party. If you are a member, please contact us before you book so we can provide a discount code. Please note that this offer does not apply to members of the Newtown Arts Company."
