        "text": "Last updated: March 27, 2024\n\nI’ve hosted hundreds of parties with a variety of start times. There’s one thing I know for sure: you must include both a start and an end time.\n\nIn this article, I’ll tell you why a 2-hour party length is the best for most situations. And I’ll discuss what the best time to start your party is.\n\nBest Party Start Times\n\nMost parties should start at 7:00 p.m. I’ll tell you why.\n\nAn event that starts at 7:00 p.m. gives you guests enough time to finish their workday. They can either come straight to your party after work, or they can eat dinner before arriving.\n\nThe 7:00 p.m. start time also allows people to handle some family responsibilities in the evening.\n\nBut this isn’t set in stone! You can adjust the start time to better suit your local customs.\n\nHere are some common party start times that I’ve seen:\n\nHappy hour: 5:00 p.m.\n\nThis is best for a happy hour which takes place at or near your office.\n\nHappy hour: 6:00 p.m.\n\nBest for an off-campus or non-work-related function. It gives people time to drive to the bar or restaurant or home.\n\nCocktail party: 7:00 p.m.\n\nBirthday party: 7:00 p.m. on a weeknight\n\nBirthday party: 8:00 p.m. on a weekend\n\nFor example, when I lived in New York City, all of my friends worked late. It was common for a happy hour to start at 8:00 p.m.\n\nWhen to End a Party\n\nEnd your party two hours after the scheduled start time.\n\nFor a networking event or happy hour that starts at 7:00 p.m., you should end your party at 9:00 p.m.\n\nSee this article for tips about how to end you party!\n\nKeeping your party length to only two hours has a lot of benefits. More people will arrive on time. More people will RSVP yes, because it is less of a commitment. And your guests get to go home early, which is especially helpful if you host your event on a weekday.\n\nOther Party Times\n\nWhile 7:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. works best for me, I know a few hosts who throw parties from 8:00 to 10:00 or even 6:30 to 8:30.\n\nAfter your first party, you can experiment to find the time block that works best for you and your community.\n\nIf you want to have a bit of fun with the start and end time, you can pick a random minute around 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.\n\nHow to End a Party\n\nYou might worry about what to do at the end of your party.\n\nIf your guests want to hang out and continue socializing after your party is over, congratulations! That means you’ve done a great job creating connections.\n\nBut that chatter and reluctance to leave doesn’t mean you need to continue hosting.\n\nRecommend a nearby bar or restaurant that guests can go to, then finish the party at the time you stated in the invitation.\n\nRead this article for more information: How to End Your Party.\n\nConclusion\n\nTime plays a crucial role in determining the success of your events. Make sure to set strict start and end times so that your party maintains its structure.\n\nIt is OK if your party goes a little late. But picking a good start time, and always including an end time, will help your event be a big success.\n\nRead my how-to guide, The 2-Hour Cocktail Party, to learn more about how to end your party gracefully and on a high note."
