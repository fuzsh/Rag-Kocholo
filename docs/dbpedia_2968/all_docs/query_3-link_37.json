        "text": "Although the Notorious B.I.G. wasn’t necessarily referring to office culture when he penned the immortal lines “Birthdays was the worst days,” he very well could have been.\n\nThink about it – the grocery store sheet cake, the lifeless rendition of “Happy Birthday to You,” the elastic party hat string slicing into your windpipe like piano wire – few things in life are as depressing as a poorly executed office birthday party.\n\nGet Your Free Guide to Celebrating Employee Birthdays\n\nOn top of that, birthdays can be a lot of pressure. These days it seems like every individual team member feels entitled to a personalized celebration. As an office manager, culture leader, or HR pro, you may feel obligated to deliver.\n\nBut as your company grows, this becomes harder and harder. Beyond twenty or so employees, it really isn’t feasible.\n\nFor these reasons, it might be tempting to throw your hands up and say “forget it,” letting birthday celebrations fall by the wayside. But it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nWhen it comes to office birthdays, a little goes a long way. Office birthdays can be both a breeze and an opportunity to add value to your company. There are even automated employee birthday programs that make it easier to manage the logistics involved so that no one at your company ever feels forgotten – We recommend checking out Bonusly which offers automated welcome, anniversary, and birthday bonuses.\n\nWhether you are looking for some birthday surprise ideas for the boss or some coworker birthday ideas that everyone will enjoy – you’ll be sure to find here!\n\nBefore we dive into our best office birthday celebration ideas, let’s quickly explore why all this birthday stuff matters in the first place.\n\nOffice birthday celebrations are simply a chance to show you’ve been paying attention. A personalized birthday wish or gift that speaks to your employees hobby or passion demonstrates that you’ve taken the time to get to know them on a personal level. This goes a long way towards creating an emotional bond between company and team.\n\nAnd really, it doesn’t take a lot to make your teammates feel special, cared for, and appreciated. SnackNation Vibe Manager extraordinaire Liza Goldberg elaborates:\n\n“From my experience, what I’ve found is that really all team members want for their birthday is just to see that their company remembers their birthday and cares enough to acknowledge them on it. Even the smallest things planned for them will go a long way. That’s why we’ve set up a birthday milestone program to celebrate their special day and unbox some appreciation.”\n\nHere are our easy-as-pie (or cake) tips to make office birthdays a part of a winning company culture.\n\nList Of Office Birthday Ideas For Work\n\n1 Let Them Pick What They Want\n\nIf you’re stuck, let employees pick their own birthday gift by awarding them redeemable points. Programs like Bonusly make it incredibly easy to distribute points, and employees have the freedom to browse through thousands of rewards and pick something they actually want. You can even configure the program to automatically distribute points on an employee’s birthday to ensure you never miss a milestone.\n\nPro-tip: Letting employees choose their own gift is an awesome option because it ensures the recipient is getting something they actually want — but it also has the potential to feel impersonal. To make sure the gesture is meaningful, be sure to include a personal note detailing all the things you appreciate about the employee.\n\n❤️ Why this is a fun work birthday idea: Let’s face it… You don’t actually know what your employee wants for their birthday? That’s okay! Letting your employee pick what they want gives them the freedom to select something they will actually use. There’s truly something for everyone with options ranging from wishlist items, charitable donations, exclusive company rewards, gifts the whole family can enjoy, and more!\n\n🏅 Here are some of SnackNation’s top picks:\n\n📝 Let them choose something off of their wishlist\n\n🎗 Let them donate to a charitable cause (with employer matching)\n\n🦄 Exclusive company branded swag and unique items\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Pay for their next family outing, like movie tickets and restaurant gift cards\n\nLooking for more ideas? For additional ways to celebrate your colleague’s special day, request a FREE copy of Bonusly’s guide to Celebrating Employee Birthdays in the Workplace! This downloadable is chock full of easy-to-follow games and activities that are perfect for the entire office!\n\n2 Shippable Experiences\n\nShippable experiences are experiences that can be sent to your remote workers and friends all over the world! Instead of the giftee needing to go to a winery or a chocolatier, they can enjoy the experiences right from the comfort of their homes.\n\n❤️ Why this is a fun work birthday idea: Shippable experiences make fantastic virtual birthday party ideas because they enable your team to get on a Zoom call and celebrate as if they’re in Paris or wherever the theme of the experience happens to take them virtually! In terms of connectivity and rapport, few work birthday gifts do a better job of rallying the team than shippable experiences.\n\n🏅 Here are some of SnackNation’s top picks:\n\n🎁 The Birthday Box\n\n🍫 Chocolate Bar Making Kit\n\n🍇 A Little Taste of Napa\n\n🌱 Terrarium Workshop\n\n🇫🇷 Parisian Picnic Box\n\n3 Office Birthday Game Show\n\nOffice birthday game shows gamify your employees’ or coworkers’ birthdays. Now, everyone can be involved, compete, laugh, and enjoy this special day.\n\n❤️ Why this is a fun work birthday idea: An office birthday party game show emphasizes having fun, which is what a birthday celebration at office is all about. Take it as an opportunity to incorporate team building activities as well!\n\n🏅 Here are some of SnackNation’s top picks:\n\n🖲 Original Game Show\n\n💯 Game Show Extravaganza\n\n🧠 Jeoparty\n\n🔍 Team Hunt\n\n❓ Coworker Feud\n\n4 Happy Hour\n\nHappy hour and birthdays go together like peas and rice — or olives and martinis. Adding libations and spirits to a birthday will only boost the cheer in the air.\n\n❤️ Why this is a fun work birthday idea: Work can be pretty serious business, but work birthdays don’t have to be. Turn the birthday into a cocktail hour or a social mixer with amazing drinks and equally awesome vibes!\n\n🏅 Here are SnackNation’s top picks:\n\n🎉 Happy Hour Box\n\n🍸 Mixology Class\n\n🍷 Wine Tasting\n\n🍺 Beer Tasting\n\n🌴 Tequila Night\n\n5 Social Recognition\n\nSocial recognition is a must-include for birthdays.

To make it a little more authentic, consider throwing the office party outside in the sunshine.\n\nTips For Hosting A Successful Office Birthday\n\n1) Pick a day and time when most coworkers can attend\n\nAttendance is an important part of your office birthday party. At the end of the day, memories are only as good as the people we share them with.\n\n2) Be inclusive and don’t leave anyone out\n\nThe more, the merrier when it comes to office dynamics. Everyone deserves a chance to take a break from work.\n\n3) Send a calendar invite so people don’t forget\n\nWithout a calendar invite, it’s pretty easy to let things slip. This ensures people can clear their schedules, save the date, and stay motivated to show up.\n\n4) Don’t fret if some people can’t attend\n\nWhile it’s great if every team member can be there, the reality is that many won’t be able to make it.\n\n5) Choose a fun activity for the group\n\nBirthdays are meant to be fun, so be sure to choose a fun office activity that excites and engages your coworkers or employees. Choose a game or experience that can include everyone to maximize participation and support a positive work environment.\n\n6) Remember you’re still in a professional setting\n\nWhile The Wolf of Wall Street is a great movie, don’t try to copy the Belfort way of running a company. People should have fun at your office birthday party while still realizing that it still is at work and not an excuse to run wild.\n\n7) Add personalization whenever possible\n\nThe more personalized and customized the office party and office party favors are, the better. Ideally, the birthday man, woman, or whatever they identify as, is able to tell the party is really designed just for them.\n\nBirthdays & Your Culture Of Recognition\n\nA more traditional approach to workplace culture might question the need for birthday celebrations in the office at all. This is usually the point of view of team members who say things like, “We’re all adults here,” or “This isn’t Kindergarten” when they put up a stink about having to watch someone blow out candles.\n\nFair enough. But there’s a strong why behind celebrating birthdays, and it’s all about creating a culture of recognition that rewards employees.\n\nMultiple studies have shown a strong link between recognition and performance. A report by HR firm Bersin & Associates suggests that companies that integrate strong employee recognition practices are on average 12 times more likely than their peers to generate strong business results. This means higher profitability and better market positions.\n\nRecognition doesn’t just mean acknowledging a job well done (although that’s certainly important), but recognizing and appreciating your employees as people.\n\nToday’s employees (especially Millennial employees) expect to be able to be their true selves at work. Because of this, more and more companies are ditching the old work-life balance paradigm for the more accurate work-life integration model, which acknowledges that work and life are inseparable. Celebrating staff birthdays helps tell your employees that you get that they are living life everyday inside of your office – we recommend checking out Bonusly which offers automated welcome, anniversary, and birthday bonuses.\n\nPeople Also Ask These Questions About Office Birthday Ideas\n\nQ: How do you celebrate office birthdays virtually?\n\nA: You can celebrate office birthdays virtually by using a video conference calling platform and/or sending out shippable experiences, among other ideas.\n\nQ: What can I do for my coworker’s birthday?\n\nA: You can do a variety of things for your coworker’s birthday.
