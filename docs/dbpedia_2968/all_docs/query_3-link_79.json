        "text": "Praise for The Birthday Party\n\n\"A real-time study in crippling self-consciousness, the fragility of normalcy, and the reality of violence.\"―The New York Times\n\n“The intensity of the writing lends a feeling of fierce suspense... Mr. Mauvignier peels back those layers of reality in order to better grasp the people they finally form, a composite far more profound than the sum of its parts.”―The Wall Street Journal\n\n\"A chilling, masterful work. It dwells in that dim, haunted space between violence and mundanity, repression and revelation―that rare thing, a genre-bending novel that sacrifices neither its literary merits nor its pulpy thrills. It has bitter truths to tell.\"―Gawker\n\n\"The amount of detail and digression that Mauvignier explores in his slow, finely drawn (and smoothly translated) dissection of these lives is remarkable and goes far to sustaining interest... [in this] quasi-Proustian noir.\"―Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review\n\n\"Mauvignier’s ability to keep the shocks coming are among the qualities that make this riveting novel so nastily effective.\"―The Guardian\n\n\"Mauvignier spins a mesmerizing psychological horror set in the seemingly humdrum French hamlet of Three Lone Girls... Readers will be riveted.\"―Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Imagine a Stephen King thriller hijacked by Proust. Clammy-handed suspense, nerve-shredding tension, but related in serpentine, elegant prose, each climax held suspended—deferred gratification. What Javier Marías did for the spy story, Laurent Mauvignier does for terror.\"—The Spectator"
