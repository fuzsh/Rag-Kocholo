        "text": "In “Henry Gamble’s Birthday Party,” from the prolific independent writer and director Stephen Cone, teenagers and their parents struggle to reconcile their sheltered Christian lifestyles with the complexities of adulthood, sex and the secular world. Similar internal conflicts were the subject of Mr. Cone’s “The Wise Kids” (2012), an earnest, autobiographically inspired feature.\n\nThis time, characters gather to celebrate the birthday of Henry Gamble (Cole Doman), the 17-year-old son of a preacher (Pat Healy, at the opposite end of virtue from the prank caller he played in “Compliance”).\n\nAs Henry’s friends, mostly from church, and their families lounge and swim, gossip flows. The repressed party guests are tempted by alcohol (the adults whisper about wine, calling it “medicine”) and shirtless bodies. Henry gains some acceptance of his own sexual orientation, which is established in the opening scene, a homoerotic sleepover with a friend.\n\nMr. Cone is not a sophisticated writer, and his dialogue frequently spells out what ought to be subtext. (“You aren’t going Democrat on us, are you?” the most uptight guest asks Henry’s mother, played by Elizabeth Laidlaw, when she expresses sympathy for women led to prostitution by poverty.)\n\nThe synth-heavy soundtrack and the camera’s emphasis on nubile flesh suggest the influence of the filmmaker Gregg Araki, who emerged as a major figure in New Queer Cinema in the 1990s. (Henry receives a DVD of Mr. Araki’s 2011 film “Kaboom” as a present.) “Henry Gamble’s Birthday Party” feels sincere but not accomplished, empathetic but not deep."
