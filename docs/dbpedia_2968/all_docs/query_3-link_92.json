        "text": "Birthdays are a great time to show how much an employee means to the organization and to the team he/she is working for.\n\nInstead of using digital birthday cards, colleagues can write a few sentences about the employees and what they like most about working with that person. The HR team can combine all thoughtful notes in a card and present that as a birthday present to the employee.\n\nIt does not take much to put a smile on an employee’s face on his or her birthday; just a sentence or two on an employee’s birthday card can make all the difference!\n\nSome employees may be interested in celebrating their special day with their families or friends. Or an employee might just need a day off to relax & revive. Whatever the case, offering a personal day off on this once-a-year event is something employees will surely appreciate.\n\nIn case they do not want to take an off, consider one day off as a birthday present that they can redeem on any day of the year as per their need.\n\nIt does not take much to put a smile on an employee’s face on his or her birthday; just a sentence or two on an employee’s birthday card can make all the difference!\n\nOne can make it unexpected, so it seems like a regular team meeting. Let everyone join well in advance before the birthday boy/girl, so that when the employee (Birthday boy/girl) enters the meeting room, they will be having a huge smile on their face instantly.\n\nMake sure you switch your birthday celebration strategy now and then so they will not automatically expect a “meeting” like this on their special day.\n\nIt can be anything from cracking a joke, thanking them for personal or professional support, or simply sharing their honest best wishes. With the help of a video editor, put together all the footage you receive from your team add some special effects and show this video during the meeting so that everyone can enjoy it.\n\nGather all team members together and wish birthday boy/girl online with the help of group chat software.\n\nThis activity can also help in team bonding and give some space to talk on a personal level, which eventually makes the birthday boy/girl feel special in the spotlight given by the team.\n\nSelect some personalized gifts for an employee that will be memorable and useful at the same time.\n\nFrom Desk Stationery, Custom water bottles, or even Personalized pens. One can also DIY gifts to make it more personalized, such as:\n\nGoodie bag with snacks or exclusive gourmet ingredients for foodies\n\nMini collection of potted plants\n\nfor flower lovers\n\nHandmade candles\n\nEating together is a simple way to build stronger team bonds, and being able to celebrate your employee at the same time is the cherry on top.\n\nMake sure you know about their favorite cuisine or snacks. Have them order in the office or you can also plan to go out with the team as per their availability.\n\nA gift card or voucher makes sure that an employee can have exactly what they want, it can be tailored to an employee’s Wishlist or interest.\n\nA week before their birthday, ask them to make a few choices from a gift card list, such as gift cards from Starbucks, Groupon, nearby, Myntra, etc. the employee will appreciate the gesture. Just make sure it is something they are interested in first before you buy a gift card for them. An easy way to do that is by talking to your employees directly."
