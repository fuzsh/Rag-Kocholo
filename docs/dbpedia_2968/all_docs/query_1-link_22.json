Mutiny in Heaven: The Birthday Party is screening in 45 cities from September to October and will become available via video-on-demand later this year. Watch an excerpt from the film, a partially animated clip titled “A Monstrous Beast Live,” below (via Rolling Stone).\n\nThe new documentary is directed by Ian White and features first-hand accounts on the band’s history from Cave, Mick Harvey, Rowland S. Howard and Phill Calvert. The film was executive produced by Wim Wenders alongside band member and the film’s music supervisor Harvey.\n\nRead Pitchfork’s Sunday Review of the Birthday Party’s Junkyard."
