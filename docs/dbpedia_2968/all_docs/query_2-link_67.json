So that’ll be coming out in the new year.\n\n“We gotta pick our spots where we want to put records in there. So the whole thing is, we were in The Black Vatican, we made another album so that’ll be coming out in the new year and then the Black Label Armada will start rolling in the new year.”\n\nGrimmest Hits is now available for pre-order.\n\nSee the cover art and tracklist below.\n\nThe Classic Rock Annual: 12 Months of the very best High Voltage Rock'N'Roll\n\nGo inside Metallica's epic world tour in the new issue of Metal Hammer\n\nRead Classic Rock, Metal Hammer & Prog for free with TeamRock+\n\nFamily of Tom Petty confirm his death\n\nBlack Label Society Grimmest Hits tracklist\n\nTrampled Down Below\n\nSeasons Of The Falter\n\nThe Betrayal\n\nAll That Once Shined\n\nThe Only Words\n\nRoom Of Nightmares\n\nA Love Unreal\n\nDisbelief\n\nThe Day That Heaven Had Gone Away\n\nIllusions Of Peace\n\nBury Your Sorrow\n\nNothing Left To Say"
