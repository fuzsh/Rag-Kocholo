        "text": "This week I was working with a local mom’s group, teaching them the ropes of basic birthday party planning, and one of the items that was up for discussion was the question of ‘how long should the party last?’ There is not one perfect answer to this of course, but I provided a brief guideline based on personal experience.\n\nGenerally speaking, the younger the child the shorter the party, and I personally don’t feel that every friend from school needs to be invited to a birthday celebration. I realize I may be in the minority with this viewpoint.\n\nHere’s a quick look at the timing and guest count I suggested to these moms, based on the age of the birthday child…\n\nBirthday Planning: How Long Should the Party Last?\n\nAge: 1-2 years\n\nTime of Day: After a nap\n\nDuration: 1 hour\n\nNumber of Guests: Depends on the type of party. Parents are obviously invited and usually at this age it’s a family-focused celebration so use your best judgement for how many guests you think you can manage.\n\nAge: 3-4\n\nTime of Day: Mid-morning or late-afternoon\n\nDuration: 1 ½ hours\n\nNumber of Guests: 4-6. Parties become more friend-focused at this age and I’ve always liked the idea of inviting the same number of kids as the age your child is turning.\n\nAge: 5-6\n\nTime of Day: Afternoon\n\nDuration: 1 ½-2 hours\n\nNumber of Guests: 6-8\n\nAge: 7-8\n\nTime of Day: Early or late afternoon; early evening\n\nDuration: 2 hours maximum\n\nNumber of Guests: 7-10\n\nAge: 9-10\n\nTime of Day: Late afternoon or early evening\n\nDuration: 2-3 hours\n\nNumber of Guests: 10-12\n\nWhat do you think? Do you agree with me? Do you approach parties differently? What is your favourite time of day to host a birthday party?"
