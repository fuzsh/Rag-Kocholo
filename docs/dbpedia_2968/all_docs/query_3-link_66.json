        "text": "How does the booking process work?\n\nIf you’re interested in booking a birthday party at the Greenway Carousel, please send us an email at [email protected] with your preferred date and time and any add-ons you’d like. From there, we’ll schedule a time to have a phone call with you to discuss the details of the party and answer any questions. We’ll then send you a link to pay a $100 non-refundable deposit, which will officially reserve your date and time. Afterwards, we’ll send you an agreement reviewing all the details of the party for you to sign and finalize your reservation. You can view an example agreement for a Carousel birthday party here. On the day of your party, you’ll pay the remainder of your fee at the ticket booth.\n\nWhat time of the day can we have a birthday party?\n\nBirthday parties are booked for 1.5 hours, with the option for extended time, and can be scheduled during any of the following time slots: 11:00am-12:30pm, 1:30pm- 3:00pm, or 4:00pm-5:30pm. Please check our website calendar for up to date information regarding Carousel operating hours. You may arrive 30 minutes prior to the start of your scheduled party time to begin setting up.\n\nIs outside entertainment allowed?\n\nOutside entertainment such as clowns and face paint artists are allowed with written approval from the Conservancy. No music or amplified sound is allowed at the Carousel.\n\nWhat happens in the case of inclement weather?\n\nThe Greenway Carousel typically operates in light rain. If inclement weather is expected on the day of your party, we would be happy to work with you to reschedule to another date. We ask that you notify the Conservancy no less than 48 hours prior to the start of the party if they’d like to reschedule. If you’d like to reschedule, your security deposit would apply to the rescheduled date.\n\nCan we exclusively reserve the Carousel for our party?\n\nBecause the Carousel is a public attraction, we are unable to exclusively reserve it for your private party. However, your birthday party will take place in a private, roped-off area. Guests with wristbands will have unlimited access to the Carousel for the duration of your party.\n\nHow many guests can we invite to a party at the Carousel?\n\nThe base party package includes 12 unlimited ride wristbands and seating for 16 people. You are welcome to increase the size of your party space by purchasing extra tables and chairs or purchasing additional unlimited ride wristbands for guests.\n\nIs the Carousel ADA accessible?\n\nYes! In partnership with the Institute for Human Centered Design, we’re proud to have created the most ADA-compliant carousel in the region. Going well beyond wheelchair accessibility, the unique and important features make it possible for people with physical, sensory and cognitive disabilities to join in on the fun.\n\nWhat type of decorations can we bring to the park?\n\nGuests often choose to decorate the tables with colorful tablecloths and use banners, signs, streamers, or pictures to decorate the stanchions. We ask that guests refrain from attaching party decorations to park infrastructure like trees or railings. Additionally, we ask that guests refrain from bringing any helium balloons to the park, as per our Park Use Guidelines.\n\nCan we bring food and drink to the park?"
