        "text": "We offer our Super, Mega, and Ultimate FUN party packages in stores 7 days per week. Our Early Access Mega & Ultimate FUN packages are available Sat., 8 – 10am and Sun., 9 – 11am. We also have a party at home offering. Click here for Details. (3/27/2023)\n\nOn Saturday from 8-10am, and Sunday, 9-11am, you can host an Early Access party before Chuck E. Cheese opens to the public! Our Early Access package ensures you are one of a limited number of parties in the showroom with more space and greater access to the games your kids love!\n\nWe have three different packages to fit every budget! Please note, package prices are not guaranteed and will vary based on location, date and time selected. Package prices are subject to change daily and are only guaranteed after your party has been booked.\n\nWe require a non-refundable $50 deposit to secure your reservation. The deposit will be applied toward your party total on the day of the party. Your reservation may be cancelled and/or rescheduled at any time. If you need to cancel your reservation, the non-refundable deposit can be used toward a new reservation within one (1) year of the reserved date of the party that was cancelled. The billing descriptor you will see on your credit/bank statement will be portrayed as “CHUCK E CHEESE DEPOSIT.”\n\nAt Chuck E. Cheese we welcome everyone at any age! Age limits for a party package? Never! Also, you can always include adults as paid guests, or buy extra Play Passes, if they want to join in on the games.\n\nOnce a birthday deposit is made, it is non-refundable. However, if you need to cancel your reservation, the deposit can be used toward a new reservation within one (1) year of the reserved date of the party that was cancelled.\n\nThe only payment we accept prior to the date of the reserved party is the deposit. If you wish to pay with Chuck E. Cheese gift cards, please review the terms and conditions on the card. Neither gift cards purchased at Sam’s, nor bonus cards, can be used as a form of payment for birthday parties or group events.\n\nOnce you book your party online, the restaurant will be notified to issue your free play points on the day of the party. They may be used at any time during the party or on a future visit.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience this might cause, but the party times are set schedules and cannot be altered. The time(s) and options(s) provided represent all remaining availability on the day you selected. The good news is that you are more than welcome to arrive earlier on the day of your party and let the children play before your event starts. However, your table and server will only be prepared for you at the scheduled time of your reservation. If you need a later time, you can also check the availability of a different location or date.\n\nUpon booking a birthday party, you are allowed up to 2 no-shows if the per child party minimum is met. Child minimums vary per location and are noted on the reservation site prior to booking. Changes to the reservation must be made prior to the day of the reserved party to avoid penalty. Any additional children not in attendance are subject to the per-child cost for any changes made on the day of your party. We cannot guarantee that you can add additional guests prior to the party. We suggest you hold for the maximum number of guests you will be inviting. You can always lower your number up to 24 hours prior to the party.\n\nYou can make changes to your reservation easily on our website! All you need is your confirmation number and reservation date OR email address. Please note that date and time changes are subject to availability. And don’t forget: Cancel any other previous reservations to avoid extra charges.\n\nMore Birthday Stars, double the fun! Our parties can accommodate more than one birthday child in the same birthday party for an additional fee. You will be charged the regular party package price plus $9.99 for the additional birthday child. Just add the additional Birthday Star during the online booking process.\n\nWe sell delicious birthday cakes that kids love, and that’s one less thing for you to bring to the party. We offer chocolate and vanilla cakes in two sizes. The 8” round cake serves approximately 12 guests, and the ¼ sheet-size cake serves approximately 18-20 guests. We have an option to customize the cakes with our Edible Image® selection. You can see our full cake selection when you book a party online.\n\nChuck E. Cheese knows birthdays! We believe every child should feel like a STAR on their special day. Your birthday experience will include games, pizza and unlimited soft drinks for every guest. You will enjoy a 2-hour reserved table and complete party setup with zero clean up. We take care of it all!\n\nOur Birthday Ticket Blaster is an exclusive experience for each Birthday Star. Upon entering a huge wind tunnel filled with ticket vouchers, the excitement begins. The birthday child has 30 seconds to grab as many vouchers as possible, including the Magic Ticket worth 500 bonus E-tickets. Your Birthday Star will be delighted to use their E-Ticket vouchers for extra goodies and large prizes. It’s an exciting experience for the birthday child as family and friends watch and cheer!\n\nThe fun never stops at Chuck E. Cheese! We offer unlimited time at your reserved table if you host your party from Monday-Thursday. However, Friday-Sunday all party table reservations are two hours. Feel free to stay and play games after your event, but reserved seating will not be available and public seating is not guaranteed.\n\nFrom delicious and fun food to the best in entertainment, we strive to bring you everything you need to make your party a success. Unfortunately, there are some items that are not permitted including outside food (other than cake or ice cream), piñatas, cups, or outside entertainment."
