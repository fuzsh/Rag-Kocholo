        "text": "BIRTHDAY PARTIES AT MOVIE MAKERS!\n\nMusic Video Birthday Party – $800\n\nThe birthday child picks a favorite song, in which they and their friends become the stars of their own music video!\n\nThe party begins with a warm-up of acting games. We then talk about how operation on a film set works, and how to use the cameras. After learning a bit about filmmaking, the kids listen carefully to their song, and write down ideas for their music video. They brainstorm stories, scenes, characters and costumes. The kids then take a break to eat and open presents (The kids are sent to another studio where the parents have set up food/cake, etc. Melissa and her assistant will be setting up for the music video and getting out costumes.)\n\nOnce they’ve finished, the filming begins. Stepping into make-up and costume, the kids becomes singers, superstars, and characters of their own design. After the party is over, the footage is edited (usually takes about a week) into a music video cut especially for their song- with awesome camera angles and sweet special effects. The finished DVDs can make great party favors for the kids, and are fun to look back on years later. One DVD for the birthday child is included. It is an additional $5/DVD.\n\nNarrative Birthday Party – $800\n\nThe kids write, act, and direct their own short film.\n\nAfter warming up with a round of acting games, the kids learn how direction on a film set operates (“Quiet on the set”, “Camera”, “Rolling”, “Action!”), and how to operate the cameras. After a cinematography workshop, the kids brainstorm ideas for their script, coming up with a basic story filled with their own, unique characters. The kids discuss what characters they would like to be, and what costumes and make-up they’ll need. Once the planning is complete, the kids take a break to eat and open presents. (The kids are sent to another studio where the parents have set up food/cake, etc. Melissa and her assistant will be finishing the script, getting out costumes, etc.)\n\nWhen the kids come back, they find the studio transformed into an array of sets- containing anything from a doctor’s office to a classroom to a fantastic museum- whatever their script requires. The kids choose from racks of costumes to determine what best fits their character. Once everyone is in costume and make-up, the filming begins!\n\nFor each scene, the kids are given a basic understanding of what is to take place, and then improv the scene themselves. They cooperate with one another and respond to each other’s energy. Every scene is given several takes and is shot from multiple angles. Not every kid is in every scene- but when the kids are not acting, they’re behind the camera, filming the action or directing their friends.\n\nAfter the party is over, the footage is carefully edited (usually takes a week) into a short film with sound effects, music, titles, and special effects. The final product is burned onto a DVD, making it easy to share with family and friends. One DVD for the birthday child is included. It is an additional $5/DVD."
