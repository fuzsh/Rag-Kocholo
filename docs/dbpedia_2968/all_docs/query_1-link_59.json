To discover what options are available at a B&B Theatres location near you, fill out the information below and get ready to bring the magic of Hollywood to your special day! üéÅüéâ\n\nDue to the nature of the film booking process, it can sometimes be a challenge to book parties in advance. Our film buyers work with studios on a weekly basis to determine which films will play on which screen at which locations and at what times. This process is finalized each Monday and undertaken independently of our event department. We are often anxiously awaiting showtimes just the same as our moviegoing patrons! Due to these challenges, this web form does not offer reservations for specific movie showtimes. Those tickets would need to be purchased through www.bbtheatres.com or in person at the box office.\n\nAll parties are booked through email and this web portal rather than phone call. This ensures that nothing is subject to change or misrepresentation based on recollection.\n\nThank you and Happy Birthday!"
