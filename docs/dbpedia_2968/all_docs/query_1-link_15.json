        "text": "Country: Australia\n\nLanguage: English\n\nAbout the film:\n\nWorld Premiere, 2023 Melbourne International Film Festival\n\nHailed as “a one band war”, The Birthday Party with Nick Cave was one of the definitive post-punk groups and goth rock pioneers, creative and destructive in equal measure. Their incendiary live performances were the stuff of violent, anarchic legend.\n\nFeaturing a wealth of rare and unseen archives, original artwork, unreleased tracks, studio footage, animation, and shocking behind-the-scenes stories from the group’s members, Mutiny in Heaven is a story of epic struggle, artistic genius and total chaos that tracks the band’s arc from breakthrough to break-up.\n\nAbout the filmmaker:\n\nIan White is an international director who has helmed theatrical features and broadcast content in over 15 countries, receiving a number of awards along the way. His feature film Before The Fall (2015) screened at Cannes 2016 and was Cambodia’s official entry at the 89th Academy Awards. Regularly commissioned by The United Nations to produce documentary films, his most powerful work has been mentioned in UN Security Council meetings.\n\nAs a former music industry art director, he worked with a diverse range of acts from Kylie Minogue to The Butthole Surfers. Having witnessed The Birthday Party perform live in its heyday, he had no hesitation when the band approached him to direct the feature film Mutiny in Heaven: The Birthday Party (2023).\n\nSee our upcoming films\n\nMAJOR SUPPORT\n\nOhio Arts Council\n\nGreater Columbus Arts Council\n\nThe Columbus Foundation\n\nCampus Partners\n\nNational Endowment for the Arts"
