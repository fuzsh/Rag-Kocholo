        "text": "Anyone who wants to jump and have access to all park attractions. Members do not participate for free at birthday parties and must be included in the jumper total if they plan to participate. If someone wants to observe the fun or join you in the party room, they don’t need to be a paid jumper. The minimum number of jumpers for a party is 10.\n\nAll your guests will need to arrive 30 minutes prior to your party start time (make sure to include this on your invites!). This allows time for the entire group to get through check-in, verify waivers and store any personal items.\n\nFirst you will be greeted by your party host! Waivers will be verified; you will receive wrist bands and grip socks and items that will go to the party room will be placed on a cart specifically for your group. After everyone is checked in you will be asked to pay the remaining balance. Anything added during the party and tips can be paid at the completion of the party.\n\nYour party host will ensure your room is set up with plates, cups, napkins and utensils. They will assist with the cake and decoration set-up, food and beverages during the time in the party room and clean-up.\n\nWhen you check-in, we will store your items, so you don’t have to worry about them! Around 15 minutes before the jump time ends, we will help you set up any additional decorations. Please no pinatas, confetti, and glitter!\n\nYou may bring themed items. Let your Event Coordinator know what items you will be bringing and what items you would like us to provide.\n\nWith the EPIC and MEGA VIP party packages, 1 large pizza and 1 pitcher (or 2L bottle) of soda is provided for every 5 jumpers. The BASIC party package does not include pizza or drinks.\n\nWith the EPIC and MEGA VIP party packages, you can bring additional food and/or beverages for no extra charge. If you purchased the BASIC party package you can bring food and beverages for a $50 fee. Adult beverages are prohibited.\n\nAll jumpers AND observers need a signed waiver. Electronic waivers are active for 1 year. If under age 18, the waiver must be signed by a parent or legal guardian. Waivers can be completed online before your party at https://defy.com/waiver/\n\nYes. It is ideal to do it online ahead of time at https://defy.com/waiver/ but it can be done at the park. If under age 18, the waiver must be signed by a parent or legal guardian.\n\nYes. If your party is on a weekday, you can add 30 minutes of jump time for $5 per jumper or 60 minutes of jump time for $9 per jumper to any of our party packages. This must be arranged through your Event Coordinator prior to your party.\n\nYes. You can find these on the party page of the website. On row 6 listing what is included, you will see “Invites – CLICK HERE”, which will take you to an editable e-vite.\n\nWe always want to acknowledge guests celebrating their birthday, so please tell your Event Coordinator the names and ages of all those celebrating a birthday at DEFY.\n\nThere is a 72-hour grace period after the time of booking where the $75 deposit may be refunded. After this 72-hour period, the deposit is non-refundable. Parties may be rescheduled at any time before or after the 72-hour window, but the deposit will not be refunded for parties cancelled after the window has passed. Events booked within 72 hours of the date of their event will not receive a refund."
