Darcey Peterson, SHRM-CP, PHR, an HR manager with Martin Foot and Ankle in York, Pa., started the conversation by asking others how she could best recognize birthdays at her 80-employee organization.\n\nOne helpful idea for small and midsize companies, she said in an interview with SHRM Online, was to partner with a local restaurant that provides birthday celebrants with a 15 percent discount off their next meal.\n\n“Cost is a big factor for a small to medium-sized company, but showing appreciation for the staff is important, too,” she said.\n\nThe ‘Don’ts’"
