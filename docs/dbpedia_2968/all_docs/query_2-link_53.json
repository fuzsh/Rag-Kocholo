        "text": "Five Tips for Hosting Your Child’s Birthday Party\n\nOnce your child is old enough to socialize with other kids there is one thing that you can expect to pop up like clockwork. I’m talking about birthday parties. As a parent it’s inevitable that you will have to take the role of a party planner for almost a decade. Here are tips to help you plan your child’s birthday party without losing your mind.\n\nStart with the guest list. This dictates everything such as location, activities, favors, food, etc.\n\nIncorporate an activity. This is a great way to involve all of your party guests and to keep the kids entertained. In most cases the activity can also serve as a party favor.\n\nDon’t do it alone. Hire a babysitter or enlist a friend’s help before and during the day of the party. There will be a lot of tasks that pop up that someone else could easily do such as pick up the cake, blow up balloons, post a sign at the end of the street, decorate, etc. The less things that you have on your plate the less stressed you’ll be leading up to and during the day of the party.\n\nDon’t aim for perfection. There is pressure on parents to impress guests with homemade food and Pinterest-worthy decorations. Most parents are not expert party planners so don’t set your expectations too high. Take inspiration from Pinterest (and this story!) and incorporate what you feel comfortable with doing.\n\nInvolve your child throughout the party planning process. Not only will it create some quality time with the both of you but it will also teach your child lifelong skills.\n\nPure Fluff Co./Cotton Candy Cart\n\nElizabeth Heard Barrettes\n\nSerendipity Cakes\n\nUberzoot Hair Salon, Stylist Alana\n\nKelli Boyd Photography\n\nKids’ attire Swing Set Clothing\n\nVanity, Savannah Vintage Rentals\n\nThis post was originally published in Golden Isles Magazine.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
