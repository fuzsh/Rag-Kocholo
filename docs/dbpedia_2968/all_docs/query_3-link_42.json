Even if you don’t have any experience with party planning, you can still throw a memorable get together.\n\nAt the end of the day, parties are all about bringing people together and having fun. Keeping this in mind throughout the process and using it as a compass as you make your major party planning decisions is a foolproof way to throw one of the best parties of all time.\n\nYour party planning checklist\n\nWhether it’s for a graduation or sales goal celebration, parties require the same event planning skills required to host any other type of group gathering. Depending on the size or complexity of your party, you may want to brush up on best practices or party planning articles to prepare yourself.\n\nNext, you’ll want to draft your plan of attack. Luckily for you, we’ve already done most of the heavy lifting! Following a party planning list like the one below, you’ll be able to plan a party step by step without missing a single item, activity, or deadline.\n\nAnd since birthday parties are in such high demand for the DIY party planning crowd, we thought it’d be worth mentioning how to shop for them.\n\nWhat items are needed for a birthday party?\n\nTake this list with you to any local party supply shop near you and you’ll pretty much have everything you need to host and decorate your celebration.\n\nA birthday cake. Egyptians invented cake so we have them to thank for this centuries-old tradition. Whether you buy it or make one yourself, make sure you have candles and a lighter handy as well.\n\nEntertainment rentals. Magicians, bouncy castles, and karaoke machines are popular.\n\nParty favors. In Rachel Ray’s party by the numbers article, party experts mention that you are welcome to choose affordable favors like candy bars or bubbles.\n\nFood and beverage party supplies. Everything from serving platters to cups.\n\nInvitations. Feel free to make your guest list long. On average, only 60% of attendees will respond Yes to cocktail party invitations.\n\nSignage. Direct guests towards your private venue and clearly mark parking areas.\n\nBalloons. A classic birthday party decor item, just make sure you dispose of them properly – lawmakers in several states are currently trying to make balloon releases illegal.\n\nTables and chairs. Use furniture you already own or rent some. If you’re renting furniture for an outdoor party that takes place in the evening, consider adding heaters to your order.\n\nTablecloths, centerpieces, streamers, etc. Etsy has over 67,000 birthday centerpiece options to choose from if you want the handmade look or customization of DIY without the actual doing it yourself part.\n\nWhether you’re making an 80th birthday party planning checklist or a casual office get together, keep the following template handy as you begin the process of creating a fun-filled event for your loved ones or colleagues.\n\nThe ultimate party planning checklist template\n\nNo matter what kind of party you’re planning, remember to complete all of these checklist items:\n\nParty planning tips 2-3 months before:\n\nDepending on your party planning experience, what time of year it is, and how large or complex you think the party will be, you’ll want to begin preparation as soon as possible!\n\nChoose a theme.

The popularity and demand for professional chefs is expected to grow another 10% by 2026.\n\nPurchase or make your decor. You can also always borrow decor from other people’s parties and style it in a way that puts your own personal touch on their products. Or take inspiration from these summer event decor ideas.\n\nPlan activities. You can choose anything from dancing to board games to trivia competitions. And (surprise, surprise) Pinterest has a lot of interesting party activity ideas to inspire you.\n\nEnlist party helpers or hire event staff.

Cakes, cupcakes, or pies should be ordered now. Some bakeries will require more or less notice depending on your preferences and their schedule so be sure to triple check their ordering instructions ahead of time.\n\nFollow up on RSVPs. Then use event planning software to share your final guest list to your caterers, party helpers, or anyone else involved in the planning process.\n\nCreate and begin sharing your party hashtag. Check out these event hashtag trends while you’re at it.\n\nParty planning checklist 1 day before:\n\nIt’s almost time, keep going!\n\nGo grocery shopping. Or hire a TaskRabbit or grocery delivery service to do it for you.\n\nPick up your bakery order. You’ll probably be in a hurry when you do but try to remember to take a peek inside the boxes before you drive away to make sure everything is there and looks how you pictured it would.\n\nPrepare tip envelopes for party entertainers and staff.

The same applies to your fast food options like sandwiches or pizza. Again, double check the companies ordering rules beforehand.\n\nPrep your event space.

Or hire take down staff to help you disassemble your rentals and decor.\n\nWhat about my party planning checklist at a venue?\n\nWe’ve already mentioned some of the specifics of dealing with rental spaces in the party checklist above, but here are some more things to add to your list if you’re working with a commercial event venue:\n\nConfirm what time your party crew will be allowed to enter the venue for set up. Note where deliveries can be made as well.\n\nAsk if there is a hard out time as part of your rental or if you’ll have the option to come and pick up left items the next day.\n\nGet the contact information for the venue manager in case of emergencies (like being locked out or other issues).\n\nSort out the parking situation. Where is it? Is it free? If not, who will valet and collect money?\n\nIf you need audio or visual equipment for slideshows or presentations, does the venue offer those tools?\n\nIf the venue works with a list of preferred vendors, make sure you review their selection before finding your own (if that’s even an option).\n\nConsider using a party planning app or party planning website to organize everything.\n\nTakeaways for planning your event\n\nThis guide has covered the ins and outs of just about every celebratory event you’ll need to arrange.\n\nBefore you go, make sure you check out these other great party planning tips with resources like free event planning tools, and how to plan an event stress-free.\n\nLooking for more tips about party planning checklists?\n\nWhat do I need to plan a party?\n\nThe basic ingredients for a party are a location and guests.

For a small personal celebration, you may only need some drinks, snacks, and ice. However for a large, themed gala you will need decorations, photo backdrops, catering, staff, and likely a coat check."
