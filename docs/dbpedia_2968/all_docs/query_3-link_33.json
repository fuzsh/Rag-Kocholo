        "text": "Many people are eager to celebrate their birthdays. And if someoneâs birthday falls on a weekday, theyâll be spending a precious chunk of that day at work.\n\nSo the question isnât, âShould companies celebrate their employeesâ birthdays?â Rather, companies should be asking how they should celebrate employeesâ birthdays. Being thoughtful about birthday celebrationsâeven if itâs making the decision to not throw a party for those colleagues who would rather not acknowledge their birthdaysâcan make a difference in how an employee thinks about their workplace.\n\nThatâs because birthdays are one of lifeâs epiphany moments, along with other major milestones like work anniversaries and class reunions. You might be surprised to learn that birthdays are actually one of the three days that employees are most likely to quit their jobs. With retention on our minds, employers shouldnât take birthday celebrations too lightly. These events are opportunities to better engage and appreciate employees.\n\nShare these ideas with your team with a PDF! Download our resource How to Celebrate Employee Birthdays in the Workplace!\n\nJump straight to our list of birthday celebration ideas\n\nWhy are birthdays epiphany moments?\n\nEpiphany moments are dates or events that cause people to reexamine their life choices. What makes birthdays a natural time to reflect on our lives and career? For many people, adding another year to their life prompts internal reflection. Itâs a day when people often take a step back and evaluate the progress of their livesâthe good and the bad.\n\nReaching a life milestone\n\nMany people have a rough idea of the roadmap of their lives, like being a certain age when they get married, or be promoted to a leadership role, or buying their first home. Thatâs what makes birthdays a great time to reflect on the previous year of their life. Did they reach their goals? What was the highest high and lowest low of the previous year? In this way, birthdays are a time to contemplate current circumstances.\n\nCatching up with friends and family\n\nPeople love to celebrate with others, so birthdays are typically a time for loved ones to gather and celebrate! Playing catch-up can prompt a number of questions about job status, relationships, and healthâyou know how families get! ð\n\nEmployees could consider whether they were venting the same work grievances last year. Did it improve or is it still the same? Since birthdays are such a milestone, these questions seem heavierâand their answers more meaningful.\n\nComparison with others\n\nThere always seems to be a teenage wunderkind in the media, or a new youngest billionaire ever. As we get older, itâs natural to feel anxious about our accomplishments, especially in comparison to others in the same peer group.\n\n3 benefits of recognizing employee birthdays\n\nHow can you apply knowledge of how birthdays can be an epiphany moment to the workplace? The simple act of recognizing an employeeâs birthday is first and foremost a nice thing to do but also contributes to the employee experience in a number of ways.\n\n1. Reduce turnover\n\nAccording to a study published in the Harvard Business Review,job search activities jump 12% just before birthdays. Giving an employee special attention on their birthday makes them feel valued and recognized, and employees who feel appreciated are less likely to quit their jobs.\n\n2. Enhance employee engagement\n\nShowing appreciation on an employeeâs birthday makes the individual feel rewarded and increases their emotional commitment to the company and its goals. This increase in employee engagement results in improved work motivation and dedication, positively impacting your companyâs bottom line. Research shows that engaged companies see 23% higher profitability and 18% higher sales.Â\n\n3. Increase happiness and productivity\n\nReceiving a little bit of extra attention on your birthday from your employer and co-workers makes you feel cared for and part of a team. This promotes happiness and reduces stress and burnout. According to research, happy employees are 12% to 20% more productive than their unhappy counterparts.\n\nShare these ideas with your team with a PDF!

The secret? Automation, combined with the right level of customization. A successful employee birthday program has the following characteristics:\n\nPersonal\n\nWriting HAGS is fun in middle school, but now, you should really put more thought into a personal message than just âHB.\" Include appreciation for recent work theyâve done, a funny anecdote, or the impact their presence has made on your life to make the birthday-person feel extra special.\n\nConsistent\n\nWhen celebrating birthdays in the workplace, it is important to ensure that no employee gets left out. It may be worth adding employee birthdays to a central calendar during the onboarding process instead of simply leaving the dates in your HRIS. Also, be sure to include remote workers in birthday celebrations, too. Key people, such as managers and team members, should receive notifications of upcoming birthdays.Employee reward platforms are great tools for automating birthday reminders and notifications, offloading HR managers from this responsibility.\n\nConsiderate\n\nFor religious reasons, not all people celebrate birthdays. Also, some people may just not like their birthday publicly celebrated. When onboarding or getting to know your team members, it wouldnât be a bad idea to ask how they like to celebrate their next trip around the sun. If they hate calling attention to themselves, a low-key birthday email might be a better idea than a decorated, scheduled event. If they have a specific birthday tradition, it may be thoughtful to bring that tradition to the workplace.\n\nTailored\n\nAt Bonusly, we champion the idea of âvoice and choice.â For a meaningful experience, employees should have the ability to choose their own rewards. When providing gift cards or organizing birthday lunches, be thoughtful about your employees likes and interestsâor even ask them for exactly what they want! This way, you can be sure that theyâll enjoy their special day. Employee reward systems let theemployee redeem their rewards at a store of their choice.\n\nDiscreet\n\nNot everyone likes their age to be public knowledge and sharing someoneâs age without their permission could lead to workplace lawsuits. Be sure not to publicize the employeeâs birth year or age when celebrating their birthday. So (although tempting) stay away from cards with â40 today!â on them and steer clear from age jokes or references.\n\nEight ways to celebrate employee birthdays\n\nHere are eight ways in which you can make employees feel special on their birthdays:\n\n1. Decorate their workspace\n\nBreak out the balloons. ððð\n\nA simple but surefire way to make an employee feel celebrated is by decorating their workspace. Streamers and confetti are always fun, but againâmake sure the employee is alright with the attention and potential clean up! Itâs also a great idea to take the personâs interests in mind. If someone really loves dogs, plastering their desks with pictures of puppies in birthday hats sounds like an excellent idea.\n\nAre you a fully remote or hybrid team? Then come to your next team meeting with a celebratory Zoom background to make the birthday-person feel celebrated.Â\n\n2. Give employee rewards\n\nIf your organization uses an employee reward system, you can automatically share rewards on their birthday and invite co-workers to do the same.\n\n3. Organize a team happy hour or birthday lunch\n\nSchedule some time for fun on someoneâs birthday! Eating together is a simple way to build stronger team bonds, and being able to celebrate someone at the same time is the *literal* birthday candle on top.\n\nIf you're fully remote or hybrid, see if you can send them a gift certificate or credit towards a local lunch of their choice.Â ð\n\n4. Write a note\n\nNothing beats receiving a personal note on your birthday. This can be a fun greeting card, but can also be an email or kudos in anemployee recognition program. Remember: make it personal and meaningful!\n\n5. Share company swag\n\nBirthdays are great times to give out company swag, such as T-shirts, hoodies, caps, and mugs.Â\n\nShare these ideas with your team with a PDF! Download our resource How to Celebrate Employee Birthdays in the Workplace!\n\n6. Give gift cards\n\nGift cards are always a good idea, especially if theyâre tailored to an employeeâs wishlist or interests. A week before their birthday, ask them to make a few choices from a gift card list from retail stores, local restaurants, bookstores, or movie theaters. Thenâthis is importantâmake sure to tell them, âTreat yourself.â\n\n7. Donate to charity\n\nAllow the employee to select the nonprofit organization of their choice, and donate to it in their name for a meaningful and rewarding gift. Bonusly customers can donate to countless organizations directly through our platform.\n\n8. Give them the day off\n\nMany companies with flexible schedules offer to give employees time off on their birthdays. As much as we love our coworkers, allowing someone to spend their special day doing what they want is a big boon to creating a great employee experience.\n\nThe takeaway\n\nAny of these celebration ideas are guaranteed to make the employee feel good on their birthday. Of course, companies shouldnât limit employee appreciation to just birthdays. To be truly successful, companies should continually recognize their employees throughout the year. Employee recognition and rewards programs like BonuslyÂ are a great solution and even include automated birthday awards.\n\nItâs always fun to make someoneâs birthday a special day! Youâll make employees feel especially valued and also reduce turnover, enhance employee engagement, and increase productivity. ð¤©\n\nShare these ideas with your team with a PDF!
