Package prices are subject to change daily and are only guaranteed after your party has been booked.\n\nWe require a non-refundable $50 deposit to secure your reservation. The deposit will be applied toward your party total on the day of the party. Your reservation may be cancelled and/or rescheduled at any time. If you need to cancel your reservation, the non-refundable deposit can be used toward a new reservation within one (1) year of the reserved date of the party that was cancelled. The billing descriptor you will see on your credit/bank statement will be portrayed as “CHUCK E CHEESE DEPOSIT.”\n\nUpon booking a birthday party, you are allowed up to 2 no-shows if the per child party minimum’s met. Child minimums vary per location and are noted on the reservation site prior to booking. Changes to the reservation must be made prior to the day of the reserved party to avoid penalty. Any additional children not in attendance are subject to the per-child cost for any changes made on the day of your party. We cannot guarantee that you can add additional guests prior to the party. We suggest you hold for the maximum number of guests you will be inviting. You can always lower your number up to 24 hours prior to the party.\n\nYou can make changes to your reservation easily on our website! All you need is your confirmation number and reservation date OR email address. Please note that date and time changes are subject to availability. And don’t forget: Cancel any other previous reservations to avoid extra charges."
