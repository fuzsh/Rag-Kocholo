There's a scene he wants to do with a kid's birthday party (at least I think that's what it is, a party of some sort) with some kids having fun in the background.\n\nNo acting or speaking parts, so basically they just show up and be kids. There might be some minor directing.\n\nDetails:\n\nAge: 10 or under. (Sorry Tyler, you can't be in the scene. )\n\nDress: Any cowboy (or cowgirl!) style outfit. (Cap pistols optional. )\n\nDate: Friday, October 2nd\n\nLocation: Tentatively my grandparents, just behind Talent (5 minutes or less outside of town).\n\nFood will be provided (hotdogs, hamburgers, etc). I asked, and yes, there will be cake.\n\nJoined\n\nNov 26, 2005\n\nThreads\n\n95\n\nMessages\n\n2,361\n\nLocation\n\nOregon\n\nSep 9, 2009\n\n#2\n\nI've got two under 10 boys that would be all over that. What time would it be? We don't get off work til 5ish but could be present by 5:30...\n\nJoined\n\nOct 3, 2006\n\nThreads\n\n130\n\nMessages\n\n8,112\n\nLocation\n\nMedford, OR\n\nSep 9, 2009\n\nThread starter\n\n#3\n\nNot sure at this point. I could probably pick some kids up if needed. I'll ask my bro what time he has planned, but I doubt he's thought that far out....."
