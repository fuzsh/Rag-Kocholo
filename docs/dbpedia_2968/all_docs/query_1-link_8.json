        "text": "Poverty, malnutrition, drug addiction, and a searing resentment towards their new home—these are the sordid conditions that animated the Birthday Party when they arrived in London from Australia in 1980. Their music followed suit. The band eschewed the UK post-punk conventions they so deeply loathed, ditching choppy guitar stabs and poppy hooks in favor of engulfing blasts of controlled feedback courtesy of guitarist Rowland S. Howard. (My Bloody Valentine’s Kevin Shields once praised this distortion as “explosive and silky, like channeled electricity.”) Tracy Pew’s basslines were raw—purring and pranging in equal measure. And frontman Nick Cave appeared capable of expunging his entire gut through his throat via frenzied ululation.\n\nA band conjuring a confrontational sound in order to rail against its new country, its audience, and itself is the central theme of director Ian White’s new documentary Mutiny in Heaven, which is screening across the U.S. and Australia this fall. The timing of the film feels neat. Not only is it 40 years since the band’s demise, but never has Cave in particular felt more detached from the Birthday Party. Seeing someone who is antagonistic to audiences, feral, and constantly teetering toward oblivion is so far removed from the rock legend’s current polished image rooted in conservative and Christian values. Watching him scurry around a flaming garbage dump in a loincloth with “hell” written on his chest in the video for “Nick the Stripper,” from the band’s 1981 debut album Prayers on Fire, feels like getting reacquainted with the old devil that once lived inside him.\n\nAlthough, those hoping to hear Cave delve into his misspent youth and reflect on a band whose music he steadfastly refuses to perform may be disappointed. While he’s signed off on the project, most of the band-member interviews used throughout Mutiny in Heaven are archival. Still, there are plenty of interesting insights. In a 1996 BBC interview, Cave speaks eloquently, evocatively, and humorously about his early group: “The Birthday Party was all heavy bludgeoning rhythms and revved-up, whacked-out guitars. All I had to do was walk on stage and let the curse of God roar through me. Floods, fire, and frogs leapt out my throat. God was talking not just to me but through me. And his breath stank.”\n\nSo Mutiny in Heaven is not a documentary about Cave. Nor should it be. Every member of the Birthday Party was distinct and vital, and the film refreshingly sidesteps the well-trodden and misleading path of presenting Cave as the singular genius and driving creative force. As guitarist, and later drummer, Mick Harvey rightly points out: “The band was greater than the sum of its parts. A beast unto itself.”\n\nThe doc traces the group’s journey from late-’70s Australia as the Boys Next Door, a solid if unremarkable teenage punk band that changed their name and grew more experimental with the addition of the vampiric, chain-smoking Howard. Extensive footage of these early years is scarce, so Reinhard Kleist, author of the 2017 graphic novel Nick Cave: Mercy On Me, is tapped to plug the gap with original animation. His visceral drawings mirror the mayhem and depravity of the band’s existence (see: veins bursting out the arms of a zombified Cave as he shoots heroin). While animation can often feel twee in music documentaries, here it works as a blunt aesthetic choice that fits the music’s metallic junkyard screech. There is a brutality to the Birthday Party that is capable of penetrating your bones, and the pleasingly thunderous sound mix seems intent on landing as many of those body blows as possible.\n\nThere’s no audio or interview footage of bassist Pew, who died in 1986, but in many ways he shouts the loudest—be it his deadly playing, his character (“a very smart but very naughty boy,” says Harvey), or his performances. Mustachioed in leather trousers and a frilly shirt, he gyrates so furiously in one Dutch TV gig that he looks like a cowboy-hatted pneumatic drill burrowing himself into the stage floor.\n\nThe film captures dichotomies that were central to the band and their endless internal and external conflicts. While there was a seething fury, reckless abandon, and dark humor present in their work, there was also sincerity, earnestness, and focused artistic ambition. “This is not entertainment,” says Howard at one point, with Cave adding: “The Birthday Party was a conceptual statement but we were making music that was misunderstood… we are the only aggressive, direct, primitive group that also has some inkling of intelligence about it as well.”\n\nGaining a reputation for live shows that were forceful enough to loosen fillings in your teeth, they pulled in a bloodthirsty crowd that, according to the band, was increasingly missing the point. “The Birthday Party did attract the most cynical, self-loathing nihilists you could imagine,” Cave writes in the 2022 book Faith, Hope and Carnage. “The sort of people I have never really had time for, even back in the day when I was one myself.” Frustrations with the audience, intra-band arguments, major burn-out, and serious drug habits all pointed to the end. Within three years of landing in loathful London, they imploded.\n\nWhile it is punchy and engaging, Mutiny in Heaven can sometimes feel a little too conventional for such an unorthodox outfit. However, this does allow the band’s fury to be the central focus, as you’re thrown into a world that is as sonically pulverizing as it is head-spinning and chaotic. As the credits roll, you almost feel battered and bruised, hit with a heavy comedown."
