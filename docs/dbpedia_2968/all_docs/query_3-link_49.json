Your hosted party includes all day admission for you and all of your guests. We ask that you do not come to your party Ramada more than 15 minutes before the start of your party.

You are welcome to bring a cooler with soda, water, etc. (No alcoholic beverages or glass bottles allowed). Phoenix Zoo does not have ice for sale. The Zoo does not have storage areas for coolers or other items before or after your party. With your ticket and a hand stamp you can leave the park to place items in your car and gain reentry to go walk around and enjoy the Zoo.\n\nEach pizza has eight slices. Four to six pizzas for a basic party should be plenty. We are NOT able to provide pizza for the parties starting at 10 a.m. or earlier. When you order pizza through the Zoo in advance, it is delivered to your party location with plates and napkins for pizza service. If you decide to bring in your own pizza or outside food, you are responsible for getting it to and from your party site and providing plates for your guests. Day-of orders cannot be accommodated."
