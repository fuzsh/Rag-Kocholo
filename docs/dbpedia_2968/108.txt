Plan your birthday party today!

Parties are our specialty at Cinema & Drafthouse! For 20 years, we have provided a fun and stress-free location to hold your party!

All children receive lunch, popcorn, and a drink in a souvenir cup. We have multiple food packages from which to choose, ranging in price from $9.50 to $11.50 per child for children ages 10 and under (pricing is slightly higher for children older than 10). Pricing does not include sales tax or gratuity. There is a 15 child minimum for all parties.

All packages include a drink and popcorn.

Personal Pizzas

Hot Dog and fries

Grilled Cheese and fries

Chicken Fingers and fries

For more information or to check availability, please contact us. Please include your child’s age, the date for which you are interested, and a phone number at which to contact you.

Room Rental

The room rental fee for birthday parties is $150.00. This covers private usage of the theater for your entire party, as well as any use of the screen. This is a flat fee and is not dependent upon how many guests you have in attendance.

Movie Selections

All parties are welcome to view a movie that is currently showing. However, Cinema & Drafthouse does not guarantee specific movies for parties. Because we schedule the movies on a weekly basis, you will be contacted the week before your party and will be informed what films will be playing that weekend. You may select one of those current titles, or, if none are suitable, select an older movie that is available on DVD.

Scheduling

Most children’s parties are held on Saturday or Sunday from 12 until 2:30pm. During this time, you and your guests will have the entire theater and our staff to yourselves; at Cinema & Drafthouse, your child will never have to “share” his/her special day with someone else! Weekdays and extended weekend times may be available. Our Room Rental Fee covers both your usage of the theater and a movie of your choice.
