One of many ironies surrounding Peter La Farge is that he could legitimately claim to be both Indian and cowboy. On his 1964 Folkways album of cowboy songs, La Farge delivers Western chestnuts like The Strawberry Roan with evident affection and recites a piece of original 'beat' cowboy verse, The Rodeo Hand. The 13 1962 Folkways recordings which flesh out this 29-track collection show La Farge's topical eye scanning discrimination (Alaska, 49th State), drug use (Marijuana Blues), and the passing of a mentor in Cisco Houston.
