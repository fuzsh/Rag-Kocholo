        "text": "Toto, we aren’t in Kansas anymore.\n\nStarting in the mid-1970s, Cash begun to get caught up in an unending cycle of either repeating the past or half-heartedly embracing contemporary country trends. By the early 1980s, the hits dried up, and by 1990, the major Nashville labels moved on from this country icon. However, on 1993’s American Recordings, Johnny Cash demonstrated he had something to offer beyond the pendulum-swinging attempts at Nashville relevance.\n\nThanks to Rick Rubin, they released a Grammy award-winning album that reminded not just Nashville, but the world, of just who Johnny Cash was: a living legend whose voice could speak truth to our very souls.\n\nTo get there, Rubin essentially repeated what Sam Phillips did way back in the mid-1950s when a failure of a door-to-door vacuum salesman walked into Sun Studios with his barely competent two-man band, The Tennessee Two. He treated the recordings like an experiment, and through iterative recording and adjustments, slowly whittled away at the songs until only the core stood there naked for the listener to embrace.\n\nThat’s what gave us American Recordings, an album of nothing more than Johnny and his acoustic guitar singing songs that matter. The template for their relationship was in many ways cast in the year-long recording sessions. Cash was given free reign to explore whatever songs he liked.. Lost classics from his own catalogue… old numbers ingrained in his memory from his childhood in dustbowl Oklahoma… gospel tunes. But, of course, mixed into these numbers, Rubin would throw songs at Cash which resulted not only in Leonard Cohen and Loudon Wainwright III covers, but also a Tom Waits number, and most strikingly a song Rubin grabbed from punk and metal legend Glenn Danzig. While the idea may sound ridiculous, the songs all worked, and the album was a masterpiece.\n\nWhen they returned to the studio a couple of years later, Rubin drew on this winning formula, but changed the recording approach. This time, he wanted a band behind Cash. Having built a successful partnership with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, he started bringing those guys – initially Benmont Tench for his keyboard skills and Petty to play bass, until the album morphed into the full band acting as Cash’s support. To ease Cash into this new mode, Cash’s ex-son-in-law and trusted collaborator through the 1980s, Marty Stuart, was brought into the mix as well.\n\nAs it turns out, it was this heady mix of musical wizards who were the perfect group to again transform Cash’s image as a fading country icon. The above-quoted song, Soundgarden’s howling Rusty Cage, is the perfect example of this. Sure, Petty and the boys were able to play anything, but as Marty Stuart tells it, this was not an easy song for Cash to grab onto. Importantly, the original song is built on Kim Thayil’s odd-time-signature guitar riffs, and Chris Cornell’s wailing vocals, both things that would in reality never work for Cash.\n\nAfter a day of struggling, apparently the song finally came together when Marty sat down with Cash in the evening and just started playing the simple acoustic riff that opens the song. Cash started working his own interpretation of the melody on top of that. The next day, Petty and co. were ready to go and finish off the new arrangement. The end result is just like those old Cash records for Sun Records. Not in that it’s a boom-chicka-boom number (it’s not, and we don’t really get those on the American albums). It’s like the old stuff because it’s uniquely Cash. Not really country. Not really rock and roll. Not really blues or rockabilly or anything else. Just a singular, earthy backing track that creates the foundation for that Voice to sing a song about the human condition that can seep into our bones.\n\nAs with American Recording’s Thirteen, these oddball song choices don’t exist simply for novelty’s sake, though. When Cash sings them, he owns them. I credit Rubin with creating a space where that could happen once again for Cash.\n\nThe darkness of Rusty Cage, however, shouldn’t fool the listener into thinking that this is a dark album. It actually stands in contrast to its predecessor in that it covers a lot of ground. With top notch players behind him, they can really take these songs in any direction. Part of the fun of having Petty and the Heartbreakers backing Cash, too, is that they don’t come from a country tradition. That gives the album a broader sonic palette that reminds us that Cash’s roots don’t lie in Nashville, but in Memphis. As such, his roots are in a melting pot of roots music and that breadth is really allowed to shine here.\n\nThere’s definitely modern material here, in fact even more than on American Recordings. Rowboat was written for Cash (apparently in a matter of minutes) by uber-hipster Beck. It’s call of, “she don’t want to be my friend no more,” sounds like it was written by Cash in 1955, not by a postmodern, LA, alt-rock hitmaker, and it’s a great way to open the album.\n\nBut Cash digs into some really old material here that shows you why the man from Dyess, Arkansas’ original sound was so much more than country. The One Rose (That’s Left in My Heart) was a 1930 Jimmie Rodgers number, co-written by Hawaiian guitarist Lani McIntire and the slack-key guitar here taps into those roots. Ballad Memories are Made of This was a 1955 hit for Dean Martin. The Kneeling Drunkard’s Plea is vintage Carter Family, and thanks to duet partner Petty’s nasal drawl, puts you write in the narrator’s worn-down spirit, despite the jaunty arrangement. Cash returns the favour to Petty by brilliantly covering his 80s minor hit, Southern Accent. Sea of Heartbreak is another upbeat number, that gives us that happy-sad ying yang, enticing the listener to sing along happy to this forlorn 1961 Don Gibson hit.\n\nThen there are the Cash numbers. Two are drawn from the Sun era. Country Boy is given some rock and roll edge here thanks to the Heartbreakers, as does Mean Eyed Cat. Although, on the latter, you get some whining signature Marty Stuart b-bender guitar to close it out, which threads together 50s, 80s, and postmodern Cash into one unified narrative. And then there’s the new number, Meet Me In Heaven, an acoustic gospel number that returns to one of Cash’s favourite themes, the promise of seeing loved ones in heaven after death. It reminds of other gospel songs he’s sung like Cross Over Jordan, and stands tall along his classic Sun material.\n\nI’d argue, though, the heart of the album lies in two songs that at the time would have been virtually unknown… Spiritual and Unchained. The first was written by little-known LA alt-rocker Josh Haden, son of legendary jazz bassist Charlie Haden, and brother to the Haden triplet sisters, two of whom had their own alt-rock band that dog at the time. His own band Spain was a minor part of the slowcore genre, known for quiet drones and minimal lyrics. Not surprisingly, this is a spare tune, as if a modern rock update of vintage Cash. With its desperate cry to God, it fits Cash like a glove, ringing out like a depression-era gospel number:\n\nJesus\n\nI don’t wanna die alone\n\nJesus oh Jesus\n\nI don’t wanna die alone\n\nWith this song, though, Rubin wrings a vocal performance out of Cash unlike any other. As the song slowly builds in intensity, the aging Cash reaches into his upper register and it takes the song into the stratosphere. Absolutely phenomenal.\n\nUnchained dives deeper into despair. Written by a little known songwriter, Jude Johnstone, this one’s like an ancient psalm:\n\nHave I seen an angel?\n\nOh, have I seen a ghost?\n\nWhere’s that rock of ages\n\nWhen I need it most?\n\nOh, I am weak\n\nOh, I know I am vain\n\nTake this weight from me\n\nLet my spirit be unchained\n\nWe’ve heard this spirit on Cash’s darker gospel numbers, like When He Reached Down His Hand for Me. This is the rebel Cash who sang Folsom Prison Blues and Sunday Morning Coming Down and the religious Cash all rolled into one, and it’s a majestic piece of art.\n\nIf you were worried about the album being too serious, though, there are still lots of fun tunes to refresh the palatte. Roy Clark’s 1970 hit I Never Picked Cotton reads like an alternate universe life story for Cash, as it tells of an outlaw who moved from poverty in Oklahoma to a life of crime – rather than Cash’s musical migration – in Memphis. And then closer I’ve Been Everywhere, once a hit for Hank Snow, is read perfectly here by Johnny. It’s rapid fire delivery makes for an energetic closer. It’s fantastic.\n\nIn sum, this is a great album. Perhaps a song or two too long, as was common in the late CD era, but solid from top to bottom.\n\nUnearthed II: Trouble In Mind:\n\nAs with American Recordings, the Unearthed box set included a full disc of outtakes from these sessions entitled, Trouble in Mind. Where the American outtakes felt like an extension of the album, these songs are less successful. While all are certainly enjoyable, they feel like a window into that Rubin experimentation. They almost work, but not quite, and you can see why other songs made it onto the album.\n\nThere a pair of Neil Young covers. Pocahontas is probably the best song here. And while Cash sounds great singing Heart of Gold, there’s something about the arrangement that is almost too minimal. I think I miss Neil’s harmonica too much! What these reveal is Rubin worked hard to get the balance right between allowing the Heartbreakers to add rock-driven arrangements to these songs, while maintaining the minimalism that is behind all of Cash’s best music.\n\nThe rest of the songs are all vintage numbers that allowed Johnny to find the songs that would work best for him. There’s two cracks at Dolly Parton’s I’m a Drifter, one with piano, one with guitar (and a guest spot by Red Hot Chili Peppers’ bassist Flea, but don’t expect a funk workout!).\n\nThere’s old Sun stuff… Roy Orbison’s Down the Line and a stilted pass at Carl Perkins’ Everybody’s Trying to Be My Baby. Carl himself shows up Chuck Berry’s Brown Eyed Handsome Man, and brings some much needed energy to the proceedings.\n\nThe Carter Family shows up, too, for a revisit of Peter LaFarge’s As Long as the Grass Shall Grow, a centerpiece of Cash’s great and controversial mid-60s concept album Bitter Tears.\n\nAs might be expected there’s lots of classic American material covered here, too. From 1920s Vaudeville blues in Trouble in Mind, to Hank Snow’s I’m Moving On, and Jimmie Rodgers’ classic number “T” for Texas. Cash absolutely nails the signature yodel on that last one. There’s another duet with Tom Petty in Merle Haggard’s The Running Kind. And, last, a return to Steve Earle’s gunslinger ballad, The Devil’s RIght Hand, which Cash had just recorded with the Highwaymen to greater effect than the solo acoustic version here.\n\nThe album rounds out with three bonus tracks. There’s an updated version of American Recordings’ Leonard Cohen cover Bird on a Wire, here with orchestral background. It’s touching to see Bill Walker return to leading Cash’s orchestra as he did for so many years, beginning with the Johnny Cash Show in 1969. There’s an early version of Drive On in which the “my children love but they don’t understand” lyric is softened to “…and they understand”. The darker option was the right choice. And then there’s another American Recordings update, this time to Like a Solider revisited as a duet with Willie Nelson. It’s the best thing here and a foreshadowing of their subsequent VH1 Storytellers duet.\n\nSo, lots of great stuff here. However, there’s nothing with the depth of Spiritual, or the edge of Unchained. And what is here feels like alternate, but lesser, versions of what made it onto the album (e.g., I’m Moving On vs. I’ve Been Everywhere). Ultimately the right choices were made for the album.\n\nAmerican II: Unchained: 4.5/5\n\nTrouble In Mind: 4/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nGive Me Back My Job/Two Old Army Pals – Johnny helped out his old friend Carl Perkins with another stab at revitalizing his career with his 1996 album Go Cat Go. Unlike Cash, Carl wasn’t pushing any boundaries, but these are fun numbers nonetheless. Pals is a duet, but Give Me Back My Job is an all-star affair with Johnny, Bono, Willie Nelson, and Tom Petty.\n\nHit Medley: Ring of Fire-I Walk the Line-Folsom Prison Blues/I Will Rock and Roll With You – duets with German country singer Tom Astor on his 1996 self-titled release.\n\nSteel Guitar Rag – from Robby Turner’s 1996 album Man of Steel. A fun showcase for some fine steel playing – an instrument not common on Cash’s own material – with a hilarious intro. Interestingly, Johnny recorded this himself in his 1986-1987 Mercury sessions, but that version remains in the vault.\n\nEye of the Prophet – Johnny narrated an audio book by Kahlil Gibran.\n\n1966’s Happiness is You found Cash beginning divorce proceedings with his wife, and singing of happiness he had found in someone else. With his divorce nearly finalized, Johnny went very public in 1967 with the double-entendre album title Carryin’ On, an album full of duets with his new love, June Carter. Credited to both of them, this 11-song album is a mixed-bag of performances, some absolutely breathtaking, others truly embarrassing. The true spirit of the album is these two lovers having a lot of fun together.\n\nIncluded in the album is their 1965 hit, Bob Dylan’s It Ain’t Me Babe, originally released on Orange Blossom Special. That song’s big arrangement, with harmonica and mariachi trumpets, differs greatly from the sonics found on the rest of this album. What it does do, however, is lay the groundwork for the type of duet the two would master over the course of their decades-long careers. For the most part, this album is a stripped-back version of Cash and Carter’s travelling show. The Tennessee Three are brought to the fore, the Statler Brothers are (thankfully!) left behind, and friends Carl Perkins, Bob Johnson, and Norman Blake add tasteful solo instruments to mix up the sound here and there.\n\nThe album’s two sides mirror each other, both opening with a fiery single, and closing with a Ray Charles cover. The singles are both amazing. Side One’s Long Legged Guitar Pickin’ Man, written by Cash’s bass player Marshall Grant, features some hot lead guitar, and June’s greatest on-record growls. The lyrics – John: “You big mouthed woman,” June: “You long legged guitar pickin’ man” – highlight the fiery relationship that had grown between the two. Side Two’s opener, Jackson, is even better. Not much can be said except that this is perhaps the greatest cheatin’ song ever, crackling from start to finish.\n\nSadly, the same can’t be said for the closers. While June’s sense of humour is enjoyable on the Charles sides, Johnny’s delivery is stiff and awkward. I’m sure they had great fun singing along to these tunes on the tour bus, and Cash’s embrace of R&B is admirable for a 60’s country star, these should have been left on the cutting room floor. Plus, hearing a Ray-esque Wurlitzer electric piano on a Cash track is just wrong.\n\nElsewhere, the album includes five songs written individually or collaboratively by Cash and Carter. The sound throughout is well produced, featuring clean arrangements which highlight the Tennessee Three’s sound well. Side one’s original tunes are both hokey. Shantytown is a soft love song of two lovers on differing sides of the tracks, yet it is the rich person who is ultimately drawn away from home. Interestingly, it is never clear whether Johnny or June is the rich one! The Carter Family provide backing vocals, and Luther provides gentle lead guitar. Fast Boat to Sydney was written by June along with her sister Anita and mother Helen. Cheesy kangaroo references aside, it again highlights the dynamic of Johnny and June’s relationship: “I’m a cheat and a liar/And you’re a lovin’ ball of fire.”\n\nSide two’s original tunes fair better. Oh, What a Good Thing We Had is a laid back love song that pushes the Tennessee Three sound further than ever before. WS Holland’s tom-tom based drum motif is unlike anything in country music, and we’re treated to the hottest guitar solo on a Cash record to date thanks to none other than Carl “Blue Suede Shoes” Perkins. You’ll Be All Right is a brief but pretty piano ballad. Last, Cash’s No, No, No is another poor boy/rich girl love song, this time featuring 12-string acoustic guitar flourishes.\n\nThe remaining cover on the album is Richard and Mimi Fariña’s Pack Up Your Sorrows, which stands out thanks to thick harmonies and rolling dobro licks. Given Richard’s recent death, one can’t help wonder if this was a tribute to another Greenwich Village songwriting idol of Cash’s, alongside Peter LaFarge and Dylan. Although a country idol, Cash always sat outside the Nashville establishment. By 1967 he had moved a long way from Now There Was a Song!, his album of country standards. Instead, he developed his own sound, and drew songs from a wide variety of influences. While sometimes that didn’t transfer into a workable result, as with his Ray Charles covers, his broad tastes would ultimately serve him well.\n\nIn a monstrous catalogue, Carryin’ On is not Cash’s finest record, but it’s an enjoyable one. If one can let go of any pretensions and enjoy the silly songs for what they are – a young man having fun with his new love and his old musician friends – it’s an entertaining, if short, album. Moreover, beyond the classic single Jackson, there’s some fine country playin’ on here, and a lot of great interplay between Johnny and June.\n\n4/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nOutside Lookin’ In/Spanish Harlem – The final 45rpm by the Tennessee Three, this one highlights their evolving sound, but just reveal the wizard behind the curtain. When I first heard this, alongside the great lead guitar on Carryin’ On, I was amazed and how far Luther Perkins’ guitar talents had evolved. The live version of Outside Lookin’ In on Live from Madison Square Garden reveals Carl Perkins (no relation) to be the lead player. Regardless, it’s a pleasant little instrumental. Spanish Harlem brings in piano and nylon-string guitar for a Latin feel unlike anything else they had attempted to date. Available on Bear Records compilations.\n\nThe Wind Changes – An upbeat single released in 1967. Where Carryin’ On had some restraint, this single unfortunately brings back the big choruses of the Statler Brothers. Elsewhere, the Tennessee Three offer up another fine performance, plus it’s not often you hear a 12-string guitar solo on a Cash recording! Available on the Legacy Edition of Carryin’ On.\n\nRed Velvet – A mandocello-led ballad with Cash singing from his lower register another rich girl/poor boy love song. Cash’s first attempt at an Ian Tyson song, it’s not quite Four Strong Winds (as on American V). Available on Singles, Plus.\n\nRosanna’s Going Wild – Strings and mariachi trumpets, along with a thinner audio quality, make this single sound like a lesser Ring of Fire, only four years too late. Forgettable. Available on Singles, Plus.\n\nRoll Call – A big-production civil war song released as the b-side to Rosanna’s Going Wild. A touching tale of counting bodies after battle, and a suitable companion to On the Line, but largely insignificant in Cash’s canon. Available on Singles, Plus.\n\nOn the Line – An unreleased civil war narrative, employing mandocello for that real Western feel. Available on Bootleg Vol. II. I\n\nTremble for You – An unreleased acoustic love song. It’s nice to hear Cash sing so simply (as he would do throughout his career), but he also sounds like the drugs are taking their toll on him. Finally released on the Love compilation.\n\nThis album is better than I remembered. My first Johnny Cash album was Giant Hits which included the ridiculous single Happy to Be With You. The cheesy mid-60s Farfisa organ – ubiquitous on British invasion hits of the day – branded itself on my brain. When I finally got a copy of this full album, opening track Happiness is You included that same organ, and I never really gave it a chance.\n\nHearing the album again with fresh ears, though, has given me new appreciation. As it turns out, those are the only two songs with that forsaken organ. Elsewhere, the album is classic boom-chicka-boom Cash. 1966 was the year that Cash’s wife Vivian finally filed for divorce after putting up with years of his cheating and drug abuse. Although Cash was still in his deepest depths of addiction, he was publicly dating June Carter, and it’s hard not to read this album apart from his personal saga. I’m sure Vivian wasn’t too happy to see his face beaming on the cover a record entitled, Happiness is You!\n\nThe themes of the album, then, are relatively unified: they are all songs of breaking up, moving on, and starting anew. The title track, which was co-written by Johnny and June communicates the message loud and clear:\n\nI tried to doubt you\n\nAnd live without you\n\nTried to deny\n\nThat I love you like I do\n\nBut I realize now\n\nAnd I’ll admit it\n\nYou’ll always be a part of me\n\n‘Cause Happiness Is You\n\nOn the beautiful breakup ballad Ancient History, Cash intones,\n\n“Just walk on out the door, it’s all over\n\nforgiving you is just a waste of time\n\nI don’t think I’ll live to regret it\n\nYou’re ancient history to his old heart of mine.”\n\nFrom time to time he laments lost love, be it on the Wanda Jackson hit (written by June’s sister Helen) Is this My Destiny?, Peter LaFarge’s tale of a mountain woman who just can’t settle down in the city with her man (She Came From the Mountains), or in the chilling lyric, “are you laughing in my face?” on A Wound Time Can’t Erase. In all of these songs, though, Cash comes off as lacking sincerity, and the listener can’t help but wonder if he’s putting himself in Vivian’s shoes, rather than expressing his own feelings.\n\nHearing him sing Gordon Lightfoot’s tale of a bitter, wandering , inconstant lover in “That’s What You Get”, instead feels far more real. We can really imagine Cash speaking such mean words to Vivian as he wanders off with June. (Although it wouldn’t take him another 40 years to actually best Lightfoot’s own recording, with the release of If You Could Read My Mind on American V). Likewise, in No One Will Ever Know – a flawless ballad marred only by a very dated piano solo straight out of a lounge act – it’s easy to believe Cash when he says, “I was glad the day you set me free.”\n\nHe seems natural, too, on the happier songs, singing joyfully in “Happy to Be With You,” and reveling in George Jones’ song of infatuation, “You Comb her Hair.” It’s simply too bad that Happy is presented in such a strange fashion, rendered as an awkward 60s pop tune sung (and drummed!) stiffly. You Comb Her Hair, a straight-up country ballad, plays far better to Cash’s strengths.\n\nIn time, the wounds would largely heal, and June would prove to be the love of Cash’s life, but at this time the scars were still fresh and filled with a heady mix of pain, relief, bitterness, and joy. This album is thus a fulcrum in Cash’s story. When he revisits his Sun hit, I Guess Things Happen That Way, he doesn’t tread any new musical ground, but you can’t help but see it in a new light when he asks, “Help me be a man/ and have the strength to stand alone.” The album closer, Wabash Cannonball, may seem a bit out of place, but this train song fits just perfectly alongside these love songs. Singing a Carter Family classic, complete with dobro, shows how much Cash felt at home in the Carter clan. His days in Memphis long behind, Cash was looking firmly to the future.\n\nDespite a somewhat dated sound, there is much to appreciate in this collection of tunes. Apart from moments of flawed instrumentation, there are lots of fine Tennessee Three performances and gorgeous acoustic guitar picking from Norman Blake and Bob Johnson. Most importantly, it stands at a critical point in Cash’s life both personally and professionally.\n\n4/5\n\nOther Songs from the Era:\n\nYou Beat All I Ever Saw – A novelty song featuring mariachi trumpets, this reflects the newfound optimism Cash found in June. Available on Singles, Plus.\n\nPut the Sugar to Bed – A hilarious b-side to You Beat All I Ever Saw, noted for it’s wild, fuzzed out steel guitar. This forgotten track is as fun as Cash ever got. Also available on Singles, Plus.\n\nWith 1965’s Sings the Ballads of the True West, we come to the end of Johnny’s run of top-notch studio recordings for Columbia. Sonically it is a fitting end. Where Blood, Sweat and Tears, Ring of Fire, I Walk the Line, Bitter Tears, and Orange Blossom Special all feature the magic combination of the Tennessee Three’s sound augmented by the Carter Family (and the Statler Brothers), the bookends – 1962’s The Sound of Johnny Cash and, now, Ballads – feature a more acoustic, folksy sound which highlights these narratives of life in the West.\n\nAs with his other concept, Cash obviously poured his heart and soul into producing this double album, whose goal was to give an accurate depiction of life in the west. As with Ride This Train, he opens with an aboriginal perspective of the settling of the wild west in Hiawatha’s vision:\n\nThe man with bearded faces, the men with skin so fair\n\nWith their barking sticks of thunder drove the remnants of our people\n\nFarther westward, westward, westward then wild, wild and wilder\n\nGrew the west that once was ours\n\nFrom there, Cash paints a picture of the West as one of trials, sadness, and death. These are themes he had already explored in the Rebel – Johnny Yuma EP and songs like Hank and Joe and Me. Here, though, he gives them unprecedented coverage. Apart from the boom-chicka-boom sound on 25 Minutes to Go, there is little on this album that could be called country music; instead, Cash gives us Western tunes through and through.\n\nWith 20 songs in all, as well as six inter-song dialogues, there is a lot for the listener to wade through. Many of the songs are enjoyable on their own, but the album is best enjoyed like Cash’s other concept records, listened to attentively from start to finish.\n\nThe songs cover a wide variety of topics: the dangers settlers faced (Road to Kaintuck, Sweet Betsy from Pike), cowboy life (I Ride an Old Paint, Stampede), the violent life of outlaws (Hardin Wouldn’t Run, Sam Hall, 25 Minutes), the comforting role of religion (Letter from Home), political assassinations (Mr. Garfield), and the Civil War (1959’s Ballad of Boot Hill – originally released on the Johnny Yuma EP – and Johnny Reb).\n\nThe music at time veers into schmaltz, be it the syrupy strings on the Shifting Whispering Sands, or the bombastic harmonies of the Statler Brothers (never my favourite in Cash’s music), although both would have been fitting in a Western movie soundtrack of the day. Even still, what remains is beautiful – a largely acoustic soundtrack that creates a great deal of space for Cash to growl out these stories in his deepest baritone.\n\nLooking at the album as a whole, two features in particular stand out. First, is the incredible contribution of Bob Johnson, here playing 12-string guitar, mandocello, flute and banjo, each of which provide that real Western air to the album. Second, is the dark humour only Cash could make work. The majority of these tales end in death – take for example the narrator of Blizzard who freezes to death steps from safety because he waits loyally beside his friend who could walk no further – and yet Cash makes you truly want to inhabit these places. As he draws you into his world, you begin to side with the brutal criminal in Sam Hall, laugh at the gallows in Shel Silverstein’s 25 Minutes To Go, and cheer for the wife who kicks out her husband, even after he helped her fight through the desert on their settlers’ journey in Sweet Betsy.\n\nIn the closing Reflection, Cash states his intention was to help the audience, “Ponder on the things that happened as we gazed so very briefly… seeing now the West as it really was.” In many ways, then, he succeeds. The Shifting, Whispering Sands (a simplified remix of an unreleased 1962 recording which originally featured Lorne Green) evokes the beauty of the deserted ranch Cash often retreated to in this era. Equally, Mean as Hell is a witty narrative about the making of the west by the Devil, who put hell in everything :\n\nHe began by putting thorns all over the trees\n\nHe mixed up the sand with millions of fleas\n\nHe scattered tarantulas along the road\n\nPut thorns on cactus and horns on toad\n\nAs with Cash himself, the West was a complex, contradictory beast. Violent, religious, free, and yet oppressive. Johnny would revisit many of these songs throughout his career, likely because in the West he saw the fullness of America, both its hope and its terror.\n\nLooking at the photo on the cover, you can see the toll drug abuse was taking on him, and by the next year his releases would sound worn out and exhausted. Thankfully, he had the energy to invest his all into this labour of love.\n\n4.5/5\n\nNote: The Legacy CD release of this album was designed to be released as 26 tracks with the narratives separated out from the musical numbers. An error was made when it went to press, resulting in a 20-track release. This has been corrected in the 2012 mono version included with the Complete Columbia Collection.\n\nOther songs from the era:\n\nMean as Hell! – With an expensive double album on their hands, Columbia re-cut the album as a 12-song single release. With many of the narratives removed, it loses Cash’s larger vision, although as an album it works surprisingly well.\n\nRodeo Hand – An outtake from the sessions (and another Peter LaFarge tune which would have complemented Stampede), this is a boom-chicka-boom tune that is about exactly what the title suggests. Sam Hall was a better choice for a mid-album lift. Available on the Legacy Edition of Ballads.\n\nStampede (Instrumental) – The album take is dominated by vocals. This minute-long version highlights the fabulous musicians backing Cash up with a banjo-led romp. Available on the Legacy Edition of Ballads.\n\nCattle Call/Bill’s Theme – In 1965 the Tennessee Three released another instrumental 45. Cattle Call is an upbeat tune driven by W.S. Holland’s shuffling drums. A sax fills out the melody (Boots Randolph again), but also begins to take it into lounge-act territory. Bill’s Theme is similar, although Luther’s lead sticks out better, complete with uncharacteristic harmonics. These were recorded in the Ballads… sessions as were some of the early material that would wind up on Everybody Loves a Nut. Available on Bear Records compilations.\n\nThe Sons of Katie Elder – Cash sang this theme to the famous John Wayne film. It wasn’t included in the movie, but is on the soundtrack. Big and bombastic, as you’d expect a John Wayne theme to be. Available on Singles, Plus.\n\nA Certain Kinda Hurtin’ – the b-side to Katie Elder, this is a mid-paced tearjerker featuring barroom piano and (unusual for Cash) whistling. A typical 60’s country-pop tune, with a fine vocal. Available on Singles, Plus.\n\nThunderball – Yes, Cash actually recorded a theme song to a James Bond movie. We’re lucky it was ditched. Musically, it sounds close to Katie Elder. Available on Bootleg Vol. II.\n\nOne Too Many Mornings – Sometime in ’65 Cash took a stab at this unreleased Dylan song. It’s a great acoustic reading, likely left unreleased because it didn’t fit any of his albums at the time. That fact that Dylan was sharing unreleased songs with him, though, shows how close they must have been.\n\nKleine Rosemarie/Besser So Jenny-Joe – Cash’s first 1965 single recorded for Germany features two songs he never recorded in English. Both are upbeat love songs featuring the boom-chicka-boom sound, augmented with German-sounding accordion and anonymous choral vocals. Neither are particularly well recorded and both are forgettable. Available on Bear Records compilations.\n\nIn Virginia/Wer Kennt Der Weg – The second German single from 1965 continues the pattern of the first. In Virginia is an ode to home that, again, Cash doesn’t seem to have recorded in English. The sound is akin to Rosemarie and Jenny-Joe. The b-side, is a German vocal slapped on top of Columbia’s existing backing track for I Walk the Line. The backing vocals are particularly bad. Available on Bear Records compilations."
