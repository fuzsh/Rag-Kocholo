This week, as last week, we have Peter La Farge, folk singer from out of the West, part Indian, part cowboy. Why don't we lead off the show with a selection of Peter La Farge's music?\n\nHere's a humorous song from the Cowboy group of music. Peter, what would you say about Lavender Cowboy?\n\nPETER LaFARGE (GUEST): The thing that always amused me about Lavender Cowboy, it's relatively recent, probably originated in oh, the late '20s, maybe the early '30s when the image of the American cowboy was a very pure gentleman on a white horse galloping across the screen in all directions, and the cowboys got so tickled with this, they made this song up about themselves.\n\nALAN WASSER: All right, Lavender Cowboy as done by Peter La Farge.\n\n[Song Performance: \" Lavender Cowboy \", Peter LaFarge]\n\nLyrics:\n\nHe was only a Lavender Cowboy\n\nAnd the hairs on his chest they were two\n\nBut he longed to be somebody's hero\n\nAnd to fight as them he-men do.\n\nNow hair oils and the many hair tonics and bear grease\n\nHe rubbed in each morning and night\n\nBut though he gazed into the mirror\n\nNo new hairs came in sight.\n\nWell, he fought for his Red Nelly's honor\n\nHe framed out the hold-up's nest\n\nAnd he died with his six-guns a-smoking\n\nBut with only...hairs on his chest.\n\n(end of music)\n\nALAN WASSER: Lavender Cowboy sung by Peter La Farge. Peter, that's a humorous song and there's quite a bit of humor in cowboy songs.\n\nOh, what about Walking John? That's a humorous song, isn't it?\n\nPETER LaFARGE: Well as a matter of fact this song is quite humorous. It's a very technical song.\n\nIt's a classic collected by my father when he took a trip by horseback packing across from New Mexico into Arizona, and I cut it for the Library Congress. It's about a rope horse, which is an animal who is taught to jockey a cowboy into position behind a running steer a cow or a doggie.\n\nA calf is a doggie. And so he can make his throw. There's many technical terms in it to bug you. A horse's head means a horse is bucking.\n\nA horse with the spittle between his feet has his head between his legs, and he's bucking. Cholla is a cactus which supposedly has night vision and can jump 20 feet, and I believe it.\n\nALAN WASSER: A cactus?\n\nPETER La FARGE: Yes, oh, it's terrible. And, let's see, well there's a \"terrapin shell\". That's a saddle. \"Twine\", that's a rope. This is the song kind of talks with you.\n\nALAN WASSER: Well, now you've got a complete list of what the words in the song Walkin' John mean, let's hear Walkin' John.\n\n[Song Performance: \" Walkin' John \", Peter LaFarge]\n\nLyrics:\n\nNow, Walkin' Johnny was a big rope horse\n\nCome from over Barango Way\n\nWhen you laid your twine on a raging steer\n\nOld Johnny was there to stay\n\nAs long as your terrapin shell stayed on\n\nAnd your twine was tight and strong\n\nYou could dial it well or hard and fast\n\nIt was all the same to John\n\nWhen a lop-eared doggie wouldn't curl his tail\n\nHe sat him many nights out to wait\n\nOld Johnny forgetting that scenery\n\nWould hit an amazing gait\n\nHe buzzed through that murderous Cholla spikes\n\nNot losing one inch of his stride\n\nAnd maybe you wished you was home in bed\n\nBut brother, he made you ride\n\nNow Johnny he was well and he was stout and strong\n\nSure-footed and Spanish broken\n\nBut I'm telling this knock-kneed universe\n\nOld Johnny did enjoy his joke\n\nWell, soon as the morning sun come up\n\nHe would bog his head right down\n\nTill your chaps stuck out like angel's wings\n\nAnd you hat was a floating crown\n\nWell, that was your breakfast regular\n\nWhether you fell or stuck\n\nI'm a-telling the world, Old Johnny was there\n\nEducating the world to buck\n\nWell, we gave him the name of Walkin' John\n\nOne stirring round-up time\n\nAnd them was the days when beef was beef\n\nAnd Old Johnny was in his prime\n\nNow Pete he was walking and Tex was sore\n\nAnd Willie couldn't even talk\n\nWhen somebody said, \"Call him Walkin' John.\n\nHe's made all the cowboys walk.\"\n\nBut, hell, he was sold to a livery\n\nWhat was willing for to take the chance\n\nOn Old Johnny becoming a gentleman\n\nNot scared of them English pants.\n\nAnd maybe 'twas the sight of them toy balloons\n\nWhat is torn up on tourist legs\n\nBut from that time on, Old Walking John\n\nHe walked like he walked on eggs\n\nTill a tourist guy, bogged down in a newborn pair of chaps\n\nAnd the rest of his ignorance plumbed the skies\n\nby the rest of his rig, perhaps\n\nCame a-floundering down to the livery\n\nand demanded for to see the boss\n\nBut the boss, he savvied his number right,\n\nand he give him a gentle horse\n\nNow, Walking Johnny had never pitched,\n\nFrom a year, come the first of June\n\nBut I'm telling the company assembled here\n\nOld Johnny recollected soon\n\nWell, somebody wanged that breakfast gong\n\nThough we'd all done had our meat\n\nAnd Johnny he started to bust in two\n\nWith his spittle between his feet\n\nOh, well the dude took off like a sailing bat\n\nAnd went floating across the sky\n\nHe may not have been built for to aviate\n\nBut brother, he sure did fly\n\nWell, we pulled him out of a Cholla bush\n\nAnd a few of his clothes stayed on\n\nWe filled up his pokes and we wired his folks\n\nIt was all the same to John\n\n(end of music)\n\nALAN WASSER: Peter La Farge doing Walkin' John. Peter, that song about a horse that bucked reminds me of another one that, oh, I learned when I was a kid I always...\n\nAnother traditional cowboy song about another horse that bucked, called Strawberry Roan. You do that song?\n\nPETER La FARGE: Oh, you bet Alan. I've been doing that song for years. I used to be what we call in that part of the country, a \"bronc tiger\", which means a young man who hasn't got any sense and per dollar a ride, will take all the bad horses out.\n\nOh, that's the greatest song for bucking horse people that was ever made. Old Strawberry Roan.\n\n[Song Performance: \" Old Strawberry Roan\", Peter LaFarge]\n\nLyrics:\n\nI was hanging round town, just spending my time\n\nOut of a job and not making a dime\n\nWhen a fella steps up and he says, \"I suppose\n\nthat you're a bronc rider, by the looks of your clothes.\"\n\nWell, I said, \"Yes, I am, and a good one, I claim.\"\n\nI said, \"Have you got any bad ones to tame?\"\n\nHe said, \"I've got one, and a bad one to buck\n\nand of throwing good riders, he's had lots of luck.\"\n\nWell, he gets all excited and I asks what he pays\n\nIf I rides this old broomtail a couple of days\n\nHe offers me ten and I says, \"I'm your man,\n\ncause the horse don't exist Old Pete couldn't fan.\"\n\nWell, I jumped in his buckboard\n\nAnd rode to his ranch\n\nIn his horse corral, there standing alone\n\nWas this so-called vile strawberry roan.\n\nWell, his legs were all spired and he had pigeon toes\n\nLittle pig eyes and a big Roman nose\n\nLittle pig ears with a split at the tip\n\nAnd a big 44 brand across his left hip\n\nI throw down my saddle, I pulled down my rig\n\nI climb up aboard him and give him a dig\n\nHe went up in the east, he came down in the west\n\nAnd to stay in his middle, I was doing my best.\n\nWell, he made one big leap and we went up on high\n\nAnd he set there some mission the length of the sky\n\nHe made one more burst and I fell down to earth\n\nAnd sat there a-cussing the day of his birth\n\nWell, there've been some ponies that Pete couldnÂ’t ride\n\nThere's quite a few left, and they haven't all died\n\nBut I bet all my money ain't no man alive\n\nCan ride Old Strawberry, when he makes that high dive\n\nStay off of that Strawberry Roan\n\nStay off of that Strawberry Roan\n\nI'll bet all my money ain't no man alive\n\nCan ride Old Strawberry when he makes that high dive\n\nStay off of that Strawberry Roan.\n\n(end of music)\n\nALAN WASSER: The Strawberry Roan sung by Peter La Farge, and he is quite qualified to sing about that song. I'm just looking at the cover of the album that song's on, \"Peter La Farge sings the Songs of the Cowboys\" on Folkways Records.\n\nAnd on the cover is a picture of Peter high up in the air on top of a horse called War Paint which is bucking at the Denver National Stock Show. So he's really qualified to sing about bucking horses.\n\nHe's also qualified to sing about Indian songs and we're gonna hear some of those in just a moment, but first this message.\n\n( short pause )\n\nAll right, this is Alan Wasser again, back at Folk Music Worldwide. We're talking to Peter La Farge, singer of cowboy songs and Indian songs. Before we go back to talking to Peter again, I want to take this moment and urge you to send in letters, postcards just mention us in a letter anything to let us know you've heard the show.\n\nWe really crave letters here, we need them badly. We don't get anywhere near enough, not that there is any such thing. We want know that you're listening.\n\nIf you just mention the fact you heard the show you can get a QSL Card, acknowledging the fact that you've heard it, just mention the fact that you heard Folk Music Worldwide with Peter La Farge on it.\n\nWell, speaking to Peter La Farge. Let's go back to Peter. Peter, what is the IndianÂ’s song's main complaints, main themes today?\n\nPETER LaFARGE: Well. We feel that the termination of the tribes which literally means the ending of the tribes, an attempt which didn't work out very well which was a mistake and is admitted as such by the government of the United States, was...well, I would kind of look at it humorously as a matter of fact.\n\nThere's a good deal of humor in Indians. Well, there's a song I do called the \"Hey Mr. President\", we made up. I've seen Indians danced to this, young men, and it's profound and it's not vicious, it's just the idea of, \"What would happen if we started charging the government of the United States rent for all the treaties broken and all the treaties bent.\"\n\nALAN WASSER: All right. \"Hey, Mr. President\", as done by Peter La Farge.\n\n[Song Performance: \"Hey Mr. President\", Peter LaFarge]\n\nLyrics:\n\nHey, Mr. President, we're gonna charge you rent\n\nFor every treaty broken, for every treaty bent\n\nWe're making reservations that are gonna be just for Whites\n\nWe'll be honest about the White man's rights\n\nHey, Mr. President, we're gonna charge you rent\n\nFor every treaty broken, and every treaty bent\n\nWe're gonna be the tourists, we'll come to see you dance\n\nYou let us know, the reason why you plans\n\nHey, Mr. President, we're gonna charge you rent\n\nFor every treaty broken, and every treaty bent\n\nWe're not unpatriotic, we'd just like to see\n\nLike to see your culture, how intriguing it will be\n\nWell now, hey, Mr. President, we're gonna charge you rent\n\nFor every treaty broken, and every treaty bent\n\nYou get out your medicine men, you get out your squaws\n\nWe'll give you justice, under Indian laws\n\nWell now, hey, Mr. President, we're gonna charge you rent\n\nFor every treaty broken, and every treaty bent\n\nI said now, hey, Mr. President, we're gonna charge you rent\n\nFor every treaty broken, and every treaty bent.\n\n(end of music)\n\nALAN WASSER: That song by Peter La Farge, \"Hey, Mr. President\" is a humorous one but I know one of the songs that Peter does is not humorous. It's another Indian song.\n\nWe had quite a discussion about it before we went on air today. Maybe, we can recreate some of that discussion for our listeners. I think it would be interesting.\n\nThe song by the way, is called \"Coyote\". Peter, first I want you tell us something about what it's about.\n\nPETER LaFARGE: \"Coyote\" is, it's a protest song in a way or it's a song that is drawing attention to something which offends American Indians.\n\nALAN WASSER: Well, specifically what?\n\nPETER LaFARGE: Well, specifically the use of insecticides, the use of poisons to upset the balance of nature. And we include naturally in this, fallout, radiation.\n\nNow, did you know, by the way, that we've got Eskimos up in Alaska that are gonna have to be moved because they're radioactive.\n\nALAN WASSER: Yes, well of course this is going to be a lot better now with the test ban.\n\nPETER LaFARGE: Yes, and we're for that, and I'm very happy that happened.\n\nALAN WASSER: Well now, all Americans, I imagine all people of the world are concerned about this sort of thing and anxious that it be straightened out, but why particularly are the Indians concerned, any more so than the rest of America?\n\nPETER LaFARGE: Because I believe this, I think this. We, religiously, we believe in a unity of man and his surroundings.\n\nThat a man must be responsible for the sun rising, that he is responsible for the summer turning to winter and the winter to summer, that the earth is alive and man is alive, that a man's responsibility for man, other men is just as important as the responsibility to the sun and the winds and the rain. This is a unity.\n\nYou can't upset this balance without making everyone sick. Whether you make them sick spiritually, impure spiritually, or you do it by dropping, by making them poisoned, by killing off the coyotes whom we in my language call \"little brother\".\n\nYou can't do it, that's all. It upsets things and it makes the God sick.\n\nALAN WASSER: Well, with that as an introduction, let's hear Peter La Farge doing \"Coyote\".\n\n[Song Performance: \"Coyote\", Peter LaFarge]\n\nLyrics:\n\nCoyote, coyote, what have they done?\n\nLittle brother, where, oh where, do you run?\n\nThey strychnine the mountains, they strychnine the plains\n\nMy little brother, the coyote, won't come back again\n\nWhen you hear him singing, the few that are left\n\nHis warning you of his death\n\nDon't poison the mesas, don't poison the skies\n\nOr you won't be back, little brother, goodbye\n\nThere'll be no one to listen and no one to sing\n\nAnd never, and never, will there be Spring\n\nCoyote, coyote, what have they done?\n\nLittle brother, where, oh where, do you run?\n\n(end of music)\n\n(Spoken part of recording: )\n\nYou poison the Coyotes and then you have too many rabbits and too many prairie dogs. So you poison the rabbits and the prairie dogs and then you have too many weeds and you have too many bushes growing.\n\nAnd you have too many rattlesnakes so you poison those. Then you have to go out and you dig those up. And you dig those up and you start erosion. And then you wonder where did the Coyote go, where we are we all going?\n\nWell, now for the first time, American Indians believe that this new generation the younger people not only in this country but across the world are not a generation, that they cannot be compared to any other generation.\n\nBecause we believe they're beginning the beginning of an era, that they are making their own rules. And we believe that the unity that very simple unity of man to man is now going to become a fact. We're very happy about this.\n\n(end of recording)\n\nALAN WASSER: Well. That was Peter La Farge and I know a lot of our listeners are going to want to know where they can get a hold of some of his records.\n\nTwo of them I'd recommend, the one that song was on is \"As long as the grass shall grow\", Peter La Farge sings of the Indians on Folkways Records. And I mentioned the \"Peter Lafarge sings of the Cowboys\" earlier.\n\nPeter, you have any other records coming out in the near future?\n\nPETER LaFARGE: Yes. I made a children's album called \"A Day on The Ranch\" which I think is going to be a lot of fun for children, because they can play games to it. I have them getting on horses and you have to ride a horse from place to place, task to task.\n\nAnd it's good for children to have things like that. It's based on the sort of...what kind of games Indian children play.\n\nALAN WASSER: Are you doing any tours outside of the United States in the near future? Any chance of any of our listeners seeing you in person?\n\nPETER LaFARGE: I have no idea whether I'll be able to leave this country. I would like to, but my work is at the moment with my people, the American Indians and I think we feel we have a great responsibility right now in this new era to... a responsibility of morality to our country. So I don't think I'll be able to leave.\n\nALAN WASSER: Well. We're just out of time, I want to thank you very much for coming in. I've enjoyed your music a great deal and thank you very much.\n\nPETER La FARGE: Thank you very much, Alan Wasser, and what is our engineer's name?\n\nALAN WASSER: Joe Garafalo.\n\nPETER LaFARGE: Well. Thank you Joe, you put up a lot of trouble here, very much.\n\nALAN WASSER: And thanks to our listeners too.\n\nMEL BERNAM (ANNOUNCER): This has been \"Folk Music Worldwide.\" Devoted to the best in folk music throughout the world, spotlighting top performers and authorities in the field.\n\nIf you have any suggestions, requests, or comments, why not write in to \"Folk Music Worldwide, Radio New York, WRUL, New York City, 19 U.S.A.\" This has been a Music Worldwide presentation of Radio New York Worldwide.\n\nGo to the first Peter LaFarge interview\n\nGo to the Master List of Shows (Home Page)"
