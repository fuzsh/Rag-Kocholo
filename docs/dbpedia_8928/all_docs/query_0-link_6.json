        "text": "Essential Question\n\nWhat was the Red Power movement, and what role did Folk and Country music play within it?\n\nOverview\n\nIn this lesson, students are introduced to the activist music of Buffy Sainte-Marie, Peter La Farge, and Johnny Cash, as well as the Native American Red Power movement of the 1960s and 1970s. By analyzing clips from RUMBLE: The Indians Who Rocked The World and examining historical documents, students will gain a deeper understanding of the history of Native American social movements, their tactics, the Federal Government’s response to the movement, and the ways music might have contributed to their goals. Students also draw connections between the poetry of John Trudell and Ishmael Hope and the motivations and ideas behind the Red Power Movement.\n\nWhen 21-year old college graduate Buffy Sainte-Marie arrived to Greenwich Village in 1962, the neighborhood was already a hotbed of socially-aware folk music. Village regulars like Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and Phil Ochs were at the forefront of a national movement that mixed political activism with music, reviving protest songs of the past and penning new ones for the present. Sainte-Marie’s songwriting quickly caught the attention of Peter La Farge, a fellow folk musician and Greenwich Village mainstay. The son of anthropologist and Native American advocate Oliver La Farge, Peter shared with Sainte-Marie a passion for bringing to light the historic tragedies and the contemporary injustices Native Americans experienced. La Farge supported Sainte-Marie, writing praises for her in Folk publications and inviting her to musical events he organized.\n\nThat same year, La Farge and Sainte-Marie’s musical advocacy gained a perhaps unlikely ally: country music superstar Johnny Cash. Following his 1962 debut performance at Carnegie Hall, Cash and friend Ed McCurdy decided to spend the remainder of the evening at Greenwich Village’s Gaslight Cafe. There, Cash first saw La Farge perform. The two became friends, and Cash embraced the Native American issues La Farge and Sainte-Marie advocated in their music. When it came time to record a new album, Cash created Bitter Tears: Ballads of the American Indian, an album comprised largely of songs written by La Farge about the plight of Native Americans. Aided by Cash’s national celebrity, the message of Sainte-Marie, and particularly La Farge, was spread beyond the confines of Greenwich Village and the countercultural movement.\n\nSainte-Marie, La Farge, and Cash were part of a growing “Red Power” movement that advocated for Native American causes. In 1961, for instance, a collection of Native American college students and young people in Chicago established The National Indian Youth Council, with the goal to foster solidarity across tribes and fight for land and resource rights. In 1968, a group of disenfranchised urban Native Americans in Minnesota founded the American Indian Movement (AIM) to protest ongoing relocation and termination programs that were affecting reservations. Based in San Francisco, the United Native Americans (U.N.A) began advocating for better schools and hospitals in reservations that same year. Collectively, these groups staged a wide range of protests, including the occupation of Mt. Rushmore, Alcatraz Island, Wounded Knee, and the Bureau of Indian Affairs office in Washington, D.C.\n\nThese Native American organizations, like so many other activist groups of the era, were viewed with distrust and even stymied by many in the government. The FBI’s notorious Counterintelligence Program was tasked with disrupting “subversive” organizations such as AIM and U.N.A., a project it enacted through espionage, character assassination, infiltration, harassment, psychological warfare, and, at times, direct violence. Many Native leaders and individuals were harassed and even arrested on questionable charges, and their organizations struggled. Sainte-Marie, La Farge, and Cash were viewed as “subversive” as well, and the FBI pressured DJs and others in the music industry to attempt to suppress their pro-Native music.\n\nView More\n\nObjectives\n\nImages\n\nActivities\n\nMotivational Activity:\n\nShow students Image 1, “Martin Luther King, Jr.”, but do not announce his name. Then ask students to raise their hand if they know who is pictured. Choose a student to identify the image and explain to the class why the person pictured is historically important.\n\nRepeat this process for Image 2, “Rosa Parks,” and Image 3, “César Chávez” Each time, ask students why the people featured are important, providing context clues if necessary.\n\nShow students Image 4, “Dennis Banks,” and ask them if they know the person in the photo. If no students can identify him, ask students:\n\nBased upon clues from this picture, what might this person’s background be?\n\nHow might this person fit in with the other figures discussed earlier?\n\nTell students the man featured is Dennis Banks, a Chippewa activist and a leading figure in the Red Power movement. Ask students:\n\nWhat kinds of issues might have Banks fought for? How might his issues differ from those of the other figures? (Encourage students to think about things unique to Native American communities: that they occupy their own lands, make treaties and agreements with the United States government, etc.)\n\nWhy might Dennis Banks not be as well known as Martin Luther King Jr., César Chávez, or Rosa Parks?\n\nProcedure:\n\nExplain to students that they will be examining the Native American protest movement in the 1960s and 1970s, and considering the role music played within it. Play Clip 1, “Peter La Farge and Buffy Sainte-Marie.” Ask students:\n\nWhat does Antonino D’Ambrosio argue is the function of Folk music? How is that function different from mainstream popular music?\n\nWhat do you think Peter La Farge might have been doing that caused John Trudell to refer to him as, “the man”?\n\nTrudell remembers La Farge “addressing the reality we were going through and how we felt about it.” How might such actions have a positive effect for Native American communities? (Encourage students to think through how La Farge might be educating non-Native people about Native American history and issues, and how he might instill confidence and pride in Native people.)\n\nPlay Clip 2, “Blacklisted.” Ask students:\n\nWhy might Columbia Records executives not have wanted Johnny Cash to release Bitter Tears? What about the album do you think they were against?\n\nAccording to Adam Beach, what was the result of the banning of Bitter Tears?\n\nWhy does Buffy Sainte-Marie suggest her music was banned from radio?\n\nWhy would the government want to keep Buffy Sainte-Marie “silenced,” as Trudell mentions? What power do you think the music of Sainte-Marie, Cash, and La Farge might have?\n\nTell students that musicians such as Peter La Farge, Buffy Sainte Marie, and Johnny Cash could be considered part of the Red Power Movement, which fought for Indigenous rights and justice throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Pass out to students Handout 1 – Diablo Canyon, John Trudell. Individually, in groups, or as class, read the poem. Then ask students:\n\nWhat experience is Trudell recounting in the poem?\n\nWhat was Trudell’s response to being arrested?\n\nWhat might Trudell mean when he writes, “I was the Vietcong, I was Crazy Horse”?\n\nWhy did Trudell express pity for those who arrested him?\n\nWhere does Trudell find his strength during the ordeal described in the poem?\n\nWho might Trudell be addressing in the final stanza of the poem?\n\nWhat connections might you draw between John Trudell’s activism and the activism of Sainte-Marie, Cash, and La Farge?\n\nExplain to students that they will be receiving sets of historical documents to further investigate Native American movements during the 1960s and 1970s. Break students into small groups. Distribute Handout 2 – Questions for Document Sets to each group, as well as Document Sets 1, 2, and 3. After student groups have looked through all the documents and answered the questions in the handout, discuss group answers as a class.\n\nPass out Handout 3 – Canoe Launching into the Gaslit Sea, Ishmael Hope. Individually, in groups, or as class, read the poem. Then ask students:\n\nWhat might Hope be attempting to do in this poem?\n\nWhat kinds of activities is Hope suggesting? What might be the intended purpose of these activities?\n\nHow would you describe the tone or feeling of the poem?\n\nIn what ways might this poem connect to the views of actions of the Red Power Movement?\n\nCould this poem in itself be considered a kind of activism? Why or why not?\n\nSummary Activity:\n\nAsk students:\n\nWhat kinds of issues were Native American social movements addressing in the 1960s and 1970s?\n\nWhat were some of the tactics they used to bring issues of social injustice to light?\n\nWhat kinds of threats did the Federal Government see in these movements? How did they respond?\n\nWhat role might have music, especially folk music, played in Native American social movements?\n\nIn what ways were the Native American protest movement similar to that of the Civil Rights Movement? movement of Martin Luther King, Jr.? In what ways were they different?\n\nIn what ways might the ideals of the Red Power Movement be present today?\n\nExtension Activity:\n\nDo some web research on the Idle No More movement (http://www.idlenomore.ca/) and the Standing Rock group (http://standwithstandingrock.net/). Write a short essay on the ways these new social movements compare and contrast with the Native American Red Power movements of the 1960s and 1970s. Are these contemporary groups advocating for the same issues that groups like AIM did in the past? Are their protest techniques similar or different?\n\nWriting Prompt: Today, does Folk Music remain the primary genre that addresses social justice issues? Or have other popular genres come to fulfill the political role Folk Music maintained decades ago? If so, which genres?\n\nHandouts\n\nDocument Set 1: Native American Protests and Occupations Document Set 2: Song Lyrics Document Set 3: Government Response Handout 1 – Diablo Canyon, John Trudell (Santee Dakota) Handout 2 – Questions for Document Sets Handout 3 – Canoe Launching into the Gaslit Sea, Ishmael Hope\n\nStandards\n\nNew Jersey State Standards\n\nNew Jersey State Learning Standards for English Language Arts\n\nReading\n\nNJSLSA.R1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly and to make logical inferences and relevant connections from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nNJSLSA.R6: Assess how point of view or purpose shapes the content and style of a text.\n\nNJSLSA.R8: Delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, including the validity of the reasoning as well as the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nNJSLSA.R9: Analyze how two or more texts address similar themes or topics in order to build knowledge or to compare the approaches the authors take.\n\nWriting\n\nNJSLSA.W1: Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts, using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence.\n\nNJSLSA.W7: Conduct short as well as more sustained research projects, utilizing an inquiry-based research process, based on focused questions, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation.\n\nNJSLSA.W9: Draw evidence from literary or informational texts to support analysis, reflection, and research.\n\nNew York State Standards\n\nNew York State Next Generation English Language Arts Learning Standards\n\nReading Anchor Standards\n\nKey Ideas and Details\n\nStandard 1: Read closely to determine what the text says explicitly/implicitly and make logical inferences from it; cite specific textual evidence when writing or speaking to support conclusions drawn from the text.\n\nCraft and Structure\n\nStandard 4: Interpret words and phrases as they are used in a text, including determining technical, connotative, and figurative meanings, and analyze how specific word choices shape meaning or tone.\n\nIntegration of Knowledge and Ideas Standard\n\nStandard 8: Delineate and evaluate the argument and specific claims in a text, including the validity of the reasoning as well as the relevance and sufficiency of the evidence.\n\nWriting Anchor Standards\n\nText Types and Purposes\n\nStandard 1: Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts, using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence.\n\nSpeaking and Listening\n\nComprehension and Collaboration\n\nStandard 2: Integrate and evaluate information presented in diverse media and formats (including visual, quantitative, and oral).\n\nStandard 3: Evaluate a speakers point of view, reasoning, and use of evidence and rhetoric.\n\nPresentation of Knowledge and Ideas\n\nStandard 4: Present information, findings, and supporting evidence so that listeners can follow the line of reasoning.
