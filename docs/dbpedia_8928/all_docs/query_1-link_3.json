        "text": "La Farge (1931-65) was a New York City-based singer-songwriter with close relationships with Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan.\n\nLa Farge claimed at times to be descended from the Nargaset Indian tribe, although this is not proven. His father was a well-known anthropologist Oliver La Farge. He shared a love and respect with his father for the histories and cultures of Native Americans, with which his father was deeply involved in study. A large proportion of La Farge's songs are about Native Americans. Regardless of his ancestry his songs helped to shed a light on the brutal treatment of Native Americans.\n\nbiography: https://web.archive.org/web/20070701122200/http://music.yahoo.com/ar-254822-bio--Peter-LaFarge\n\ndiscography: https://www.wirz.de/music/lafarge.htm"
