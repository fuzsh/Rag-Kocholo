        "text": "People are still confused that Hamas is the Palestinians' freedom warriors. I also wish that the people of Gaza will be freed from the TERROR ORGANISATION that captivates them as human shields. The people in Gaza, rightly so, are too afraid to speak up against those building tunnels under their homes or shooting rockets on the roofs of their children's schools (also controlling the education system to teach young minds hate and antisemitism) or hiding weapons in their hospitals. Unfortunately, when Europe sends human support to Gaza, nothing reaches the right hands but the monsters that want to kill, rape, abuse and kidnap. If you'd read about Hamas-ISIS-Hizballa-Jihad's \"agenda,\" you'd realize, even if you are entirely hateful and brainwashed to think that Israel is all Palestinian and Arab nations' problems and that without this small country, the world is a better place, if you'd only do the objective observation - you'd understand that none of those so-called \"warriors\" will ever stop once Israel is gone. And once Israel is gone, you'll have no one to blame for what will happen next. Don't stand with Israel. Act with Israel. Separate Palestinians from the terrorist who also are ruining their lives. You'd also be doing Palestinian justice. Because they are not animals. They are humans who suffer from being controlled by terror organizations. We should have no 'buts' when it comes to slaughter, burning babies, and genocide. Be human to humans. No excuses can justify 7/10, as you wouldn't do it to 9/11, and many other attacks around the world.\n\nThe entire world must condemn taking hostages and attacking civilians. Is this a military or a criminal act by Hamas? As a criminal justice scholar, I wonder if blurred lines between military action and what should be a response by law enforcement will become the new norm. The Oklahoma City bombing was carried out by two anti-government extremists and white supremacists, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. When the Oklahoma bombing occurred, there was no discussion of a military response against anti-government extremists and white supremacist groups. Anti-government extremists (or terrorists, as per federal law definition, Title 18 USC 2332b(g)(5)(A)) and white supremacists stormed the nation's headquarters on January 6th, and they have boldly threatened the lives of politicians, law enforcement, prosecutors, judges, and top leaders of the U.S. military ever since. In 2022, a white supremacist shot and killed 10 Black people at a Buffalo, New York grocery store. Between 2017 and 2019, white supremacists killed 57 in terrorist-related events inspired by racial hate. Yet, there has never been a call for war or military action against anti-government extremists and white supremacists. However, this was not so during Hurricane Katrina. The military was called on Black people in 2005 and used against Muslims in the war on terror. Neither Black people nor Muslims killed by the military belonged to a branch of armed forces organized by a sovereign state. This is important because military personnel are eligible for certain benefits and protections, such as prisoner of war status. This war rhetoric and military response to Hamas bears similarity to the rhetoric in the war on drugs and the war on terror. Not questioning the war rhetoric and military action of either U.S. or Israel for criminal matters provides cover for the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, or, at best, human rights abuse. War appears to be reserved only for a certain racial, ethnic, and religious category of people. If Biden supports this response, I must ask is Israel following the United States, or is the U.S. following Israel?\n\nWARNING: SATIRE (ADULTS ONLY, KIDS STAY HOME) Republicrats, aristocrats, autocrats, human remains of the world: It's safe to say, past generations never could have envisioned the chaotic political state of the contemporary. There's not a politician alive today that knows how to rock, because if there was there would be no time to waste. We invite our readers to contemplate rock, heavy rock, noise to lift us up, drown the crap, head banging sounds, vocals from heaven and hell, some beasts say, \"you gotta fight for your right to party.\" Yeah, business hacks, political idiots, citizen stiffs wondering what to do; get off your couches and chairs, come with us to the world stage to rock like never before. To Gehenna [hell] with right and left extremism, attacks on women's rights, terrorism, violence, hatred, criminal bullets, bombs, uncontrolled guns, quiet anger, state sponsored murders and walls to divide people. Disclaimer: Not responsible for after party residuals. Essential listening, do not skip: https://lnkd.in/gSA7DWFM #business\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/g6Sprx7z Editorial Work In Progress. Trump Is Evil. And we see that Trump’s Rhetoric Often Fuels Addictions to Unhealthy Amounts of Adrenaline & Toxic Testosterone. With Trump Addicts Requiring Ever Increasing Amounts of adrenaline & testosterone Generated by Trump’s Violent & Absurd rhetoric & Actions. Pause Recall. A lesson of the Sixties, for example, is that a Popular Civil Rights & Vietnam War Protest Song, “If I had A Hammer,” link below, was that Love Can Be A Compassionate Answer to Violence & Hate. Putting flowers (stems) into Gun Barrels Helped Show the Alternative Choices of War or Peace. That Anger (violence) Generates Evil (as with Trump). Just Listen to MAGA Rallies Cheer Trump’s Praise Of & Calls for violence & Hatred. Compare. That Trump’s Infrequent & Insincere Calls for & Praise of Non-violence, Love & Truth Often Silence most & Simultaneously Enrage others at Trump Rallies. Contrast, Look to Love-Ins & Dr King’s Use of Sit-Ins, Boycotts, Marches, & Actions like Recruiting Volunteers, Registering Voters, The Poor People Campaigns, Feeding the Hungry, Serving the Poor, & Working to End Discrimination as Examples of Ways to Weaken Oppressors (like Trump). Hope. Following Dr King’s Words Into Actions, Loving Trump & his Followers may be a Way to Break Trump’s, George Wallace-like, David Duke-like Evil Powers. It may be that Fighting Trump Powers Trump. & that Loving Trump Can Weaken Trump. Try it. Act. So, all our love to you, Donald & family & friends. Hope you are Enjoying a Blessed Easter & Praying God Helps Take the Pain Out of Your Legal & Financial Burdens. Peace be with you. Love & serve our Lord in holiness. Repent of your sins. & be born again in Jesus. Love you! Bob Meek, Born Again. Digital Creator. News Bridge Media. Democrat, Gay. Christian. Feminist. Addict in Recovery.
