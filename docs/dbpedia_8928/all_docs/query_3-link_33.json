On his 1964 Folkways album of cowboy songs, La Farge delivers Western chestnuts like The Strawberry Roan with evident affection and recites a piece of original 'beat' cowboy verse, The Rodeo Hand. The 13 1962 Folkways recordings which flesh out this 29-track collection show La Farge's topical eye scanning discrimination (Alaska, 49th State), drug use (Marijuana Blues), and the passing of a mentor in Cisco Houston.",
