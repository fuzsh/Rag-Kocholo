        "text": "Tales The Tombstone Tell Columns from the Republican Observer Written by S. W. Fogo Page 21\n\nTales The Tombstones Tell - Republican Observer - December 22, 1955\n\nYankee Marker on Confederate Ground\n\nA recent news item out of Prairie du Chien aroused our curiosity somewhat. The item said in part: \"There are few men, maybe only one; who can say that they got a Confederate memorial placed in Yankee territory and a Yankee marker in Confederate ground.\n\n\"That one man is Col. W. F. Reichardt, now of New York City and formerly city engineer at Prairie du Chien and at Watertown.\n\n\"He was responsible for getting a memorial to Jefferson Davis, the Confederacy's president, put in a military cemetery at Prairie du Chien, where Davis was stationed in pre-Civil War days. His memorial was dedicated in 1953 and the top officials of the Daughters of the Confederacy were all on hand.\n\n\"Reichardt is now promoting erection of a marker at the Battlefield park at Prairie Grove, Ark., where a Capt. Weber of Watertown, his wife's great uncle, was killed in the Civil War.\n\nDaughters of the Confederacy, who own the park, have approved the marker. \"This shows to me a united nation,\" the colonel wrote.\"\n\nIn the item it named the battlefield of Prairie Grove, Ark. Somewhere in a cemetery in Richland county we had noticed a stone which told of a soldier boy being killed at the battle of Prairie Grove. When a stone reads that death took place on a southern battlefield it also means that the soldier boy is also buried there for back in Civil War days the dead had to be buried as soon as possible. Many a Richland county \"boy in blue\" sleeps in a grave far from home.\n\nA search of the records revealed to the writer that among the regiments taking part in the Prairie Grove battle was the 20th Regiment Wisconsin Volunteers, and Co. B, made of Richland county men, was in the thick of the fray. Sixty of Co. B are named as having enlisted from this county. Byron W. Telfair, Richland Center, was captain of the company.\n\nThose from this county killed in the battle were: Samuel F. Curtis, West Lima. He enlisted July 1, 1862; was a Sergeant, and as his record reads, \"Killed in action, December 7, 1862 at Prairie Grove, Ark.\" Another boy to give up his life in the battle was Morris E. Sexton, Richland Center, who enlisted June 14, 1862, and was killed on December 7, 1862. He was a First Sergeant, made Brevet Captain on December 7, and was killed the same day. William A. Yakeley, West Lima, who enlisted July 10, '62, was another Richland county youth to give his all to the cause: he died in the battle.\n\nThere were also Henry Fazel of Sylvan, who was wounded at the battle and died December 24th at Fayetteville, Ark., as the result of the wounds. Samuel Marsh, Richland Center, passed away on December 11th at Fayetteville from wounds; Nathaniel S. Standish of Eagle, was another Richland county boy who was wounded and he died December 17, at Fayetteville.\n\nFive from county received serious wounds in the fray; they were Charles M. Atwood, Sextonville; Joseph H. Davalt of Rockbridge; Samuel R. Ewing, Mill Creek; John Holdren, Sylvan; Perry C. Poole, Loyd.\n\nThere were a large number \"Boys in Blue\" from Grant county, members of \"C\" who met death in the battle, a few from Iowa county and a few from Crawford. When the stone for the \"Yankees\" is placed at the Prairie Grove battlefield it will be in honor and in grateful memory of some Richland county solders of the Civil War.\n\nPage 22\n\nInformation concerning Richland county soldiers killed and wounded in the battle is taken from the official records compiled by Wisconsin officials by authority of the legislature.\n\nMorris Sexton, who gave up his life at Prairie Grove, was a son of E. M. Sexton, founder of the village of Sextonville, and the death of the son was a sad blow to the father. A tombstone for Morris is in the Sextonville cemetery.\n\nOthers In The South\n\nMany, many brave soldier boys from Richland county are buried in the south; killed in battle, died of wounds or disease was their fate. One of these is W. H. Bennett after whom the Richland Center Post of the G.A.R. was named. Mr. Bennett first enlisted in 1861 in Co. H, 5th Wisconsin Infantry as a private, being promoted to Second Lieutenant and transferred to Co. B 25th Wisconsin Infantry for gallantry in action at the battle of Williamsburg, Va.\n\nGoing to the 25th regiment he became Captain of Co. B, of which William H. Joslin, Richland Center, and W. S. C. Barron, town of Westford, were also captains. Bennett gave his address as Viola. Capt. Bennett was wounded and taken prisoner at Decatur, Ga., on July 22,1864. His leg was amputated and he died in prison at Macon, Georgia, on August 10, 1864, as the result of the wounds. He was buried in the south, but a marker in his memory is in the cemetery at Rockton, a few miles north of La Farge, in Vernon county. The marker is on the Bennett lot where are buried Mr. and Mrs. Van S. Bennett, parents of W. H. Bennett. Van S. Bennett was at one time superintendent of schools for Richland county and he also was a Civil War veteran, a captain of Co. C, 12th regiment along with Hartwell Turner, both of Viola. Van Bennett moved from Viola to Rockton in 1866.\n\nAlong with W.H. Bennett many men of Co. B, 25th regiment died in the south and are with one or two exceptions, buried there. Thirty-five members of Co. B from Richland county died in the far south. One of these we note, was Ethan A. Clark of Bloom, who died July 31, 1863, on steamer \"Glascow\", of disease. Others of Co. B died at Madison and three or four managed to reach Richland county before death came.\n\nThe Sad Story of a War Bride\n\nCloser to home is the sad story of a war bride which was first published in the Republican 0bserver in 1938. It follows:\n\nAdeline Bobb, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Peter Bobb of Orion, when 18 years of age, married John Mathews, also of Orion. The war of the north and south broke out and the husband answered President Lincoln's call for volunteers. He went to the front, was wounded in battle and taken to Baltimore for medical aid. Word was sent to the wife and quickly as she could she started for Baltimore. Across the river upon the ice she walked, boarded the first train out of Muscoda and hastened to the bedside of her young husband. He fought for life, with the wish to be again on Indian Creek with his wife and babe. Fate was against him and he answered the final call. With a sad heart, the wife, who had reached his bedside too late, started west with the body. She finally reached Muscoda and the body of her husband, followed by the faithful wife, conveyed across the river to the little hamlet of Orion and to the village cemetery where the body was laid to rest, close to the hills and river he loved. This little cemetery, across the road from the Orion church, is the oldest one in Richland county. Tombstones in this cemetery date back to 1844.\n\nS. F.\n\nPage 23\n\nTales The Tombstones Tell - Republican Observer - January 26, 1956\n\nA Visit to Four Cemeteries\n\nPine River, Bovee, Ash Creek and Mayfield are the names of four cemeteries along county trunk O in the towns of Richland and Orion all within a distance of four miles. In these four burying grounds rest many of the early settlers of the neighborhood.\n\nIn the Pine River cemetery many of the stones bear the name of Miller for it was in that area that many of the Miller families lived and died. Other familiar names appear upon the markers; Jones, Klingler, Keys, Starkey, Davis, Brimmer, Ross, Howard and others.\n\nA church once stood in the cemetery grounds, but it was torn down years ago. This was a Disciple church, organized about 1855 and meetings were held in school houses until the church building, a wooden structure 3Ox45 feet, was erected and surrounding it was the cemetery. Land for this was donated by Hiram Welton and as fate would have it he was the first person to be burned there. He died in 1873 and had been a resident of Richland county since 1852, coming direct from Indiana; though his birthplace was Ohio.\n\nBurials are not frequent in the little cemetery these days but descendants of the pioneers of the area find rest therein.\n\nWhile in this cemetery this summer, Frank Poynter and Frank Spry were with me. Mr. Poynter pointed out the grave of his grandmother and Mr. Spry came upon the grave of an uncle, Hiram Spry, who he thought was buried at Bloom City or Woodstock.\n\nThe Bovee Cemetery\n\nDown the highway less than two miles, back off the road a bit, is the Bovee cemetery in the town of Orion. The road passed directly in front of it years ago but as the highway was straightened the cemetery was left in quiet peace. Now a lane leads to it. There has been no burial there for quite some years.\n\nIn it are some of the early settlers, the Bovees, Jones, Bergers. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Berger are buried there. They were long time residents of Ash Creek. Also in the burying ground are Durfee and Elisha Bovee. The cemetery in which they are buried takes their name. Durfee Bovee was one of the first settlers of the town of Richland. He first came here in 1848 from Indiana and took up land in section 34 but did not remain. He came again in 1849 and settled on his claim. Mr. Bovee was born February 27, 1812, and died October 16, 1887. He was born in New York state, going to Indiana in 1836 and in 1837 was married to Anna Duncan. Their children were Elisha, Mary, Samuel and David, one child died in infancy.\n\nElisha Bovee was but nine years old when his parents came to Richland county. Here he attended school and when 18 years of age he commenced preaching. He was married to Victoria Potter and she assisted him in his church work.\n\nAlso in the quiet confines of this little country cemetery is buried one, whom the writer of this article knew over the years. She was a friend for many years and we were there at the last rites for this beloved friend, Mrs. Della Gher. Peace and rest be hers.\n\nOn one of the stones in the cemetery we noted this verse:\n\n\"A loving man, a friend most dear,\n\nA faithful partner lieth here.\n\nWeep not for me, nor sorrow take,\n\nBut love my children for my sake.\"\n\nPage 24\n\nMrs. John Jones may be the oldest person to be buried in the Bovee cemetery. Upon her marker it says-\n\nElizabeth. wife of John Jones,\n\nborn Sept. 30, 1794,\n\nDied Sept. 13, 1887\n\nThe Ash Creek Cemetery\n\nUpon the side hill adjoining the Ash Creek church is the cemetery. Pioneers and the sons and daughters of the pioneers are buried here. There are the Flammes, Sigrists, Jones, Neefes and Hanolds. The cemetery is not large; it is well kept and in it sleep many of the honored citizens of the locality. One of these is Jules Neefe, a veteran of the Civil War; member of the 6th Wisconsin Battery. Mr. Neefe used to entertain the writer of this article with stirring tales of soldier life. Jules lived for many years on the banks of the Wisconsin river near Riverview and there he died.\n\nMayfield Cemetery\n\nDown the highway a mile or so you take a right turn on a county road to another country cemetery. This one takes its name from the Mayfield family, early settlers. David Mayfield and wife located in Orion township June 20, 1845, and Green Mayfield, a brother, in 1846, though he may have come with his brother in 1845. He served in the Black Hawk War, enlisting when 14 years of age. He also served in the Civil War. His son, Elijah, is buried in the cemetery, and the last burial there up-to-date was a grandson, Asa.\n\nOn a stone in the cemetery is engraved: \"We will meet you and oh what shouting there will be.\"\n\nGeorge Drake, who for years ran a feed store in the city, is buried there. Mr. Drake, we noticed would have been 100 years old in 1955.\n\nOn a marker not far from the Mayfield lot was this bit of verse:\n\n\"Although he sleeps, his memory doth live,\n\nAnd cheering comfort to his mourners give.\n\nHe followed virtue as his truest guide,\n\nLived as a Christian, and as a Christian died.\"\n\nSome of the stones in the Mayfield cemetery are engraved in German. These are for members of the Pauls family.\n\nLike some of the other county cemeteries burials are less numerous than they were years ago and there will come a time when these little burial plots will be no longer used but around them will still linger memories of the long, long ago.\n\nS. F.\n\nPage 25\n\nTales The Tombstones Tell - Republican Observer - February 9, 1956\n\nThe First Cemetery In Forest\n\nOut on the brow of a hill in the town of Forest is located the old Bender Cemetery overlooking what is now known as Bender Hollow. The cemetery is at the head of the hollow not far from the Hopewell cemetery and church.\n\nIn the Bender cemetery, some now call it the old Hopewell cemetery, is buried Mrs. Daniel Bender, one of the very first settlers of the town of Forest and her passing marked the first death of a white person in that township. It took place in May, 1854, and so thinly settled was that area that only ten persons were present at the burial which was May 24, 1854. She was 45 years of age. It is stated that \"near\" neighbors residing some four miles distant, went to Readstown, secured a rough box to use as a coffin and the body was laid to rest with members of the family and the near neighbors standing around the open grave.\n\nMrs. Bender was the wife of Daniel Bender, who with his brother William and the two families, came to Richland county in April 1854. Daniel and William, natives of Pennsylvania, moved to Indiana in 1842.\n\n\"Westward Ho!\" was in their blood and their hearts longed for the wilds of Wisconsin. By ox teams, trains and boats they traveled toward the setting sun, landing at Muscoda they took the ferry boat to Richmond, rented a house for the two families until a rough log cabin could be built in what is now the town of Forest. It was the first house erected in the township, had no floor, and a quilt was used as a door. Into this cabin the families moved and there in the new home Mrs. Margaret Bender sickened and it was there May 24th she breathed her last and was gathered to a home on high.\n\nA monument for her stands today in the little country cemetery. Around her sleep many of the pioneers of the area. Names upon the tombstones are of the early settlers. Familiar names in that locality such as Reeve, Ambrose, Kanable, Shaffer, Taylor, Matthes, Van Fleet, Austin, Fall, Gochenaur and many, many of them bear the name of Bender. Margaret Bender was the third wife of Daniel and in 1855 he was again married, his wife being Mary Fall. They resided in the old log house until 1959 when a new home was erected and on New Years day, 1860, the family moved into the house, which still stands and is worth a visit.\n\nIt was built big and strong, and bids fair to weather a hundred or more years. In this fine home Daniel Bender and family lived for many years. Mr. Bender answered the final summons on October 21, 1890, and his body was taken to the hilltop cemetery and buried beside his wife, Margaret, who passed on 36 years previous. A week later, October 28, 1890, his wife Mary, closed her eyes and she too was laid to rest upon the Bender lot; her name appearing upon the stone along with Margaret and Daniel.\n\nThe stones in the cemetery are for the most part old fashioned ones, slabs of marble, weather beaten to some extent, but stand as silent memorials to those who have gone on before. Granite stones are few in the burying ground, a dozen or less. One of these granite markers is for Betty Bender, daughter of Daniel, who was born on the old farm in 1868.; another is for her brother William. One stone marks the grave of John Smelcer, one time resident of Richland Center. He died, according to the stone, in 1940. In Richland Center there are many monuments for Mr. Smelcer. They are not of marble or granite, but monuments nevertheless. A large number of these towering toward the sky, can be found in Krouskop park - they are the trees which line the driveways and dot the picnic areas. John Smelcer planted back in the days when the park was being laid out for future generations to enjoy. John did a good\n\nBack to \"Tales the Tombstones Tell\""
