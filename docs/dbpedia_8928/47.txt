La Farge (1931-65) was a New York City-based singer-songwriter with close relationships with Johnny Cash and Bob Dylan.

La Farge claimed at times to be descended from the Nargaset Indian tribe, although this is not proven. His father was a well-known anthropologist Oliver La Farge. He shared a love and respect with his father for the histories and cultures of Native Americans, with which his father was deeply involved in study. A large proportion of La Farge's songs are about Native Americans. Regardless of his ancestry his songs helped to shed a light on the brutal treatment of Native Americans.
