        "meta_description": "Folk Songs For Old Times&#39; Sake by Nicholas Edward Williams, released 02 November 2021\n\n1. Shake Sugaree\n2. East Virginia Blues\n3. Wish I Was a Mole\n4. Green Rocky Road\n5. Thinking Tonight of My Blue Eyes\n6. Railroad Bill\n7. Cotton Mill Girls\n8. Goin&#39; Down This Road Feelin&#39; Bad\n9. Saint James Infirmary\n10. Midnight Special\n11. Barbry Allen\n12. Mississippi River Blues\n13. Peggy-O\n14. Pay Day\n\nNearly five years ago, I had my first in depth experience diving into music history with my late mentor Joan Crane. This new record &quot;Folk Songs For Old Times&#39; Sake&quot; is a culmination of what she taught me, and harbors mostly traditional material revisited and rearranged that Joan inspired in me. Some of the songs are by pioneers such as Elizabeth Cotten, The Carter Family, Mississippi John Hurt and Jimmie Rodgers, with the mindset of preserving their legacy and exposing their history to my generation and its successors. After starting the music history podcast &quot;American Songcatcher&quot;, my desire for preservation has become a mission, and inside the liner notes of the limited edition vinyl gatefold resides a summary of the song or artists history behind the 14 tracks. This installment is the first of many to come honoring the legacy of American roots music.",

Everything I got is done and pawned Pawn my watch, pawn my chain Pawn everything that was in my name Pawn my chair, pawn my bed Ain't got nowhere to lay my head Pawn my tobacco, pawn my pipe Pawned everything that was in my sight Pawn my farm Pawn my plough Pawned everything, even my cow\n\n2.\n\nEast Virginia Blues 02:59\n\nI was born in East Virginia North Carolina I did go There I spied a fair young maiden And her name I did not know And her hair was dark and curly And her cheeks were rosy red Upon her breast she wore white lilies Where I longed to lay my head Molly dear, go ask your mother If you my bride might ever be If she says no, come back and tell me And I'll run away with thee No I'll not go ask my mother Cause she lies on her bed of rest In her hand she holds that dagger She’ll kill the man I love best I don't want your greenback dollar I don't want your watch and chain All I want is you my darling Say you'll take me back again I'd rather be in some dark holler Where the sun refuse to shine Than for you to be another man's darlin' And to know you'll never be mine\n\n3.\n\nWish I was a mole in the ground Wish I was a mole in the ground If I's a mole in the ground I could root that mountain down Well I wish I was a mole in the ground Emmy wants a nine dollar shawl Emmy wants a nine dollar shawl When I come up on the hill With my 10 bill saying baby where you been so long? Baby, where’d you stay last night? Honey, where’d you stay last night? Been round the bend with some rough and rowdy men, I’m never goin back again Don't like them railroad man I don't like them railroad man Cause a railroad man, they could kill you when they can They’d drink up your blood like wine Wish I was a lizard in the spring Wish I was a lizard in the spring If I’s a lizard in the spring I could hear my lover sing Emmy let your hair fall down Emmy let your hair fall down Let your hair fall down, down to the ground Emmy, let your hair fall down\n\n4.\n\nGreen Rocky Road 03:26\n\nWhen I go by Baltimore There ain’t no carpet on my floor Grab your coat, wont you follow me I know a man in Galilee Hollerin’ Green green rocky road Promenade in green Tell me who ya love Tell me who ya love See that crow up in the sky He don't walk no, he just fly He don't walk no, he don't run He keep flappin’ to the sun Little Miss Jane you run into the wall Don't you stumble, Don't you fall Don't you think no don't you shout When I sing come runnin’ out Ooka-tooka soda cracker Does your mama chew tobacco? If your mama chews tobacco Ooka-tooka, Ooka-tooka soda cracker\n\n5.\n\nWould be better for us had we never In this wide and wicked world never met For the pleasures we've both have seen together I am sure, love, I'll never forget Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes Who is sailing far over the sea Oh, I'm thinking tonight of my blue eyes And I wonder if she ever thinks of me And you told me once, dear, that you loved me You swore that we never would part But a link in the chain has been broken Leaves me with a sad and aching heart When that cold, cold grave shall enclose me Will you come, dear, and shed just one tear And say to the strangers around you A poor heart you have broken lies there\n\n6.\n\nRailroad Bill 02:24\n\nRailroad Bill, mighty bad man Shot the lantern from a brakeman's hand Oh honey, it's ride, ride, ride Railroad Bill, went out west Shot all the buttons off a brakeman's vest Well, it's ride, ride ride Left Jacksonville, bout half past one Got to Chattanoogy at the settin' of the sun Well, it's ride, ride ride Baby, darlin’ you needn't fret I ain't a fool, Lord, at least not yet Oh well it's ride, ride, ride If the river was brandy, and I was a duck I'd sink to the bottom and I'd never come up Oh well it’s ride, ride, ride Railroad Bill he took my wife Didn’t take much, she didn’t say goodbye Now I'm gonna ride, ride ride\n\n7.\n\nCotton Mill Girls 02:13\n\nI worked in the cotton mill all my life, I ain't got nothin' but a Barlow knife. And it’s hard time cotton mill girls, Hard time everywhere. (Chorus) And it's hard times cotton mill girls, Hard times cotton mill girls, Hard times cotton mill girls, Hard times everywhere. Nineteen-fifteen I heard it said Go to cotton country and get ahead But it's hard times, cotton mill girls, Hard times everywhere. Gilmer to Barlow's a long long way Down Ellijay to Cartecay. It's hard times, cotton mill girls, Hard times everywhere. Us kids worked twelve hours a day For fourteen cents of measly pay Hard times, cotton mill girls, Hard times everywhere. When I die, don't bury me at all, Just hang my body on the spinning room wall, Pickle my bones in alcohol, It's hard times cotton mill girls.\n\n8.\n\nGoin' down this road now feelin' bad, baby Goin' down this road feelin' so low and bad I ain't gonna be treated this-a way I'm tired of eatin' your cornbread and beans, baby I'm tired of eatin' your cornbread and beans, right now I ain't gonna be treated this-a way These two dollar shoes is killin' my feet, baby Two dollar shoes is killin' my feet, right now I ain't gonna be treated this-a way Takes ten dollar shoes to fit my feet, baby Ten dollar shoes to fit my feet, right now I ain't gonna be treated this-a way I'm goin' where the chilly wind don't blow, baby I'm goin' where the chilly wind don't blow, no more I ain't gonna be treated this-a way I'm goin' where the weather suits my clothes, baby I'm goin' where the weather suits my clothes, tomorrow I ain't gonna be treated this-a way, no more I ain't gonna be treated this-a way\n\n9.\n\nSaint James Infirmary 02:26\n\nI went down to St. James Infirmary To see if my baby was there, She was stretched out on a long white table, So sweet, so cold, so fair. Let her go, let her go God bless her Wherever she may be She done looked this whole wide world over She'll never find another man like me When I die, you can bury me in Frisco You can buy me a $20 hat Put a $20 dollar gold piece in my pocket Let the fellas know I died standing up Let her go, let her go God bless her Wherever she may be She done looked this whole wide world over Never find another man like me\n\n10.\n\nMidnight Special 03:11\n\nYonder comes Miss Rosie, how in the world do you know I know about her apron and the dress she wore Umbrella on her shoulder, a piece of paper in her hand She’s gonna see the warden to turn loose her man Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me Let the Midnight Special shine it’s ever loving light on me Let the Midnight Special shine a light on me Let the Midnight Special shine it’s ever-lovin' light on me Well, you wake up in the mornin', and the big bell rings Go marching to the table, you get the same damn thing Knife and fork are on the table, ain’t no pork up in that pan Better not complain, boy, you’ll have trouble with the man If you ever go to Boston, boys you better walk right You better not stagger, you better not fight Or the sheriff will arrest you, and take you downtown You can bet your bottom dollar, you're jailhouse bound Well now jumpin ‘ little Juy She was a mighty fine gal She brought it jumpin To the whole world round She brought it in the morning Turnin round my mind She got me thinking About my great long time\n\n11.\n\nBarbry Allen 03:10\n\nTwas in the merry month of May When flowers were a-bloomin', Sweet William on his deathbed lay For love of Barbry Allen. So he sent his servant to Scarlett town, To the place where she was dwellin', Saying, \"You must come to my master, dear If your name be Barbry Allen.\" So slowly slowly she got up, And slowly came beside him, And all she said when she got there, \"Young man, I think you're dyin'.\" So he turned his face unto the wall And death was coming for him \"Goodbye, goodbye to my friends and all Be good to Barbry Allen\" And when he died and laid the in grave She heard those death bells callin And every stroke to her did say Why oh why Barbry Allen. Oh mother, mother dig my grave Make it long and narrow, Sweet William died of love for me And I will die of sorrow. He was buried in the old churchyard And soon she was laid beside him, Above Sweet William there grew a rose And out of hers a briar. They grew and grew in the old churchyard Till they could grow no higher Then they formed a true lover's knot The rose around the briar.\n\n12.\n\nMississippi River Blues 03:00\n\nOh the Mississippi river, water so deep and wide My thoughts of you keep rising just like an evening tide I'm just like a seagull that's left the sea Oh, your muddy waters, they keep on calling me I'm gonna pack my grip and head that way You'll see me hanging 'round again some day 'Cause I know that's the only way to lose The Mississippi River blues I've often ridden on your bosom from Memphis down to New Orleans Dreaming over muddy waters flowing through familiar scenes And when I hear the whistle of an old steamboat Down that Mississippi River again I'm going to float I'm gonna pack my grip and head that way You'll see me hanging 'round again some day 'Cause I know that's the only way to lose The Mississippi River blues\n\n13.\n\nPeggy-O 04:02\n\nAs we rode out to Fennario As we rode out to Fennario Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove And he called her by name pretty Peggy-O Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O Will you marry me, pretty Peggy-O Will you marry me, I’ll set your cities free Free all the ladies in the area-O I would marry you, sweet William-O I would marry you, sweet William-O I would marry you, but your guineas are too few And I fear my mama would be angry-O What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O What would your mama think, pretty Peggy-O What would your mama think if she heard my guineas clink And saw me marching at the head of my soldiers-O If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O If ever I return, pretty Peggy-O If ever I return, your city I will burn Destroy all the ladies in the are-O Come steppin down those stairs pretty Peggy-O Come steppin down those stairs pretty Peggy-O Come steppin down those stairs combin’ back your yellow hair Bid a last farewell to your William-O Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O Sweet William he is dead pretty Peggy-O Sweet William he is dead and he died for a maid Now he’s buried in that old country-O As we rode out to Fennario As we rode out to Fennario Our captain fell in love with a lady like a dove And he called her by her name pretty Peggy-O\n\n14.\n\nPay Day 02:43"
