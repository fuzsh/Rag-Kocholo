        "text": "I’ve been lucky to present some of my friends who are quite talented songwriters, and Wednesday’s guest, Alex Radus, is no different. I’ve been an Alex fan-boy for several years now. His new album, recorded at Godfrey’s, is called Tributaries, and that was a good point to start from.\n\nI took it as river-like tributaries that have shaped our music but he also mentioned that tribute is part of that equation. Spot on.\n\nI started out with a Mississippi John Hurt as one of my early influences, especially with his two-finger picking. I did CC Rider, although rather sloppily. Alex picked up on that did some fine fingerpicking with one of his tunes. As we moved through the night, the mix of styles and songs was quite entertaining.\n\nI ended up doing Barnyard Dance on my arch-top Martin, my Fountain Hill tune I Can Be… and Take Me To The River. We talked about how our instruments often shape what we play or write songs.\n\nAgain, a small audience that included my daughter Rosalie, so that’s pretty good. The conversation was stimulating and Alex’s songs were wonderful. He was a delight to have on stage with me.\n\nI was looking forward to getting back to my Dave’s Night Out series, especially since last month’s session was cancelled for Covid protocols. Rolly Brown is a world-class guitarist, excellent songwriter and we have developed a friendship over the last decades here in Eastern PA. I had tagged this session: Music Helps, Making Music in the Pandemic. Rolly had developed a wonderful series of live broadcasts online during the pandemic, and now hosts three shows a week, featuring three songs and an instrumental. We had a good chance to disect his philosophy on starting it out, and how it has blossomed into a nice community for his music.\n\nI talked about my route through the last two years with the individual videos/songs that I did over 500 days in a row, and continue now by posting songs from my copious You Tube library. We had a good chance to get it all out and found, as always, a highly intellectual, informative and humour format.\n\nRolly backed me up on several songs (Simple Gifts, Rodeo Rider, Branching Out, Shoo That Fly, while showcasing several of his original songs and instrumentals. He is a brilliant player and storyteller. We’ve both upped our game during the pandemic.\n\nOf course, there was under 10 people in the audience, several of whom came up to see Rolly. I find it disappointing to not have an audience for my work, especially in my home town.\n\nI did introduce my new Martin SC-13E, and play a full song on it for the first time (Branching Out). As we sat on stage before the show, Rolly noticed that I hadn’t taking the plastic off the pick guard yet, so we decided to throw that into the show. It was pretty funny and raised some attention on FB. Made in Mexico, it has koa wood back and sides, a nice spruce top and an unique shape to facilitate playing up past the 12th fret. It played really well, and I could feel it teaching me things that all new guitars do. This is going to be a good guitar.\n\nIt was a good night spent with a fine guitarist and friend, and I can’t think of a better was to spend my night out.\n\nI was looking forward to chatting with Christine tonight. She’s become quite a fixture on the LBGTQ circuit and is a regular performer now at Godfrey’s. It took a while to find a date since she no longer lives in the Philly area, but this worked out well.\n\nChristine has worked her way through playing guitar with a kids’ music group (Cat’s Pajamas) a long time ago, playing small folk clubs like Godfrey’s and now is recognized as strong women’s songwriter. She’s got chops on the guitar to match her lyrics and also has become a confident performer. I knew this would work. I just had to figure how to get my music in sync with hers.\n\nI started off with Branching Out (John Gorka) and mentioned that there was an artifact on the walls in the song. It was, of course, the Louisville Slugger bat that Christine Lavin gave John years ago. After the show, one woman said that this song took her in from the get go. A good choice for a new audience. We took off from there as we played songs, talked about her early days watching performers like The Story and Jonatha Brooks here on this stage, saying “that’s what I want to do.”\n\nIt was a good crowd, for a change, and she had lots of fans in the audience. This also afforded me a chance to play my songs in front of a fairly new audience for me. I played Rosie is a Friend of Mine, Giant, Lessons from Pete, and tried out some new ones: May You Never and What About the Bond, both landed well. Christine plays loud (too loud for my tastes) but that’s part of her aggressive sound.\n\nIt was nice to share our philosophies about love, in a global sense, getting people to sing along, songwriting, “taking it to the bridge”, open tunings and more. As usual, it was good session and folks really enjoyed the evening, as did Christine.\n\nMy Martin roared.\n\nBack from two RockRoots gigs this afternoon, I had a chance to reboot for a Godfrey’s gig, a Dave’s Night Out. Tonight was Michael Johnson and Quentin Fisher from our emerging bluegrass stars Serene Green. I dreamed this up a long time ago so I was looking forward to this evening. Que and Micheal have been doing a duo for months, years, as friends and band mates. I asked them to work on Old Time Bluegrass Duos as a theme. They did great!!!\n\nI’ve been working with a “sit-down” format, playing and conversing in chairs on stage. Michael emailed me that they were going to be standing, and working with a central mike, as they do with the full band. I negotiated a combination of the two and it worked very nicely. I trust my folk production instincts. As it turned out, it proved to be a very nice move.\n\nI started out with Truck Driving Man, an old Steppin’ Out! tune that I pulled out of my ass for this one. But, it was a good way to have Q and M add some chops. Established the improvisation to the evening.\n\nThese guys are the real deal and they both work really hard on their songs, harmonies and mando/guitar work, with tremendous respect for the tradition. They have my complete respect for what they do. We had great conversations about the role of the instruments, the harmonies, the history of brother duos (Monroe, Delmore, Stanley, Traums, and more). Lots and lots of acoustic porn, actually.\n\nQuentin has really accepted his role as lead communicator for the band, with humor, factual knowledge and a welcoming stage presence. Frankly, I told him I see a lot of me (with my Sheiks/Skiffle Band/Steppin’ Out! duties) in his stage craft. Q’s the real deal.\n\nI pulled out the Delmore Brother’s Deep River Blues. It was good break to the countryish sound, with more of a blues tone. It was appreciated and surprised some of the folks who haven’t heard me play.\n\nAfter some more sit and chat, I asked the boys to take the single mike set up to the side. , to demonstrate how they usually play. Bang. They played some flawless duo tunes and the audience got to see it done to perfection.\n\nAs we settled down again, I pulled out Golden Bird, a old/new tune for me, and one I had run through earlier at the sound check. Again, it was great. I asked to join their band and they asked to join mine. That’s pretty cool. We should do it.\n\nWe wrapped up after about two hours, and Q said we could have gone on. I agree. I was pleased to introduce both Quentin and Michael to the concept of a small stage conversation and they both came up big.\n\nIt was a very long day on stage(s) but quite a good way to roll.\n\nI am in awe of George Hrab’s intellect and songwriting abilities; I was looking forward to having him on stage with me on Thursday. I wasn’t quite sure how to balance my portion of the show, but things turned out nicely. We had done this two years ago, so we were comfortable with the format.\n\nI started out with Michael Cooney’s Figure It Out and it was a really good way to broach the philosophic endeavors of the evening. Short, sweet and slightly inane. And we were off.\n\nThere was a decent audience tonight, with some new folks in the house. George played some great tunes early on (Florida Man and I Hate Christmas) that set the stage for some interesting conversation. I asked about musical “bridges” and there was some great chat about that. We talked about playing for kids, songwriting in general and, as usual, the intellectual heat was good and entertaining.\n\nInterestingly enough, I found my niches to comment, played some tunes that fit in the topics (Smokin’ Babies, Barrelhouse, Lessons from Pete, Santa Assassin…). And George and I have a palpable mutual respect that made for a balanced show. Lou did great on sound and we were really comfortable on stage.\n\nAs usual, the format continues be entertaining and electric, and something that I’m glad that my guests appreciate. Quite the unique evening that always surprise and delight me.\n\nI lined up this session with my friend Bill Schachter and his weekly trio of friends (self-titled Notorious B.I.D) who play music among themselves. Bill’s having a tough time with some serious health problems but I’ve heard from Carole, his wife, that these sessions have been instrumental in keeping his spirits up during his treatments. It’s that idea that spurred me to do this DNO on “Kitchen Folk Music”, about the social aspect of playing at home with friends, and not for public consumption.\n\nBill along with Ben Wright and Frank Pappalardo gather weekly. I wanted to explore how they decide what to play, work on harmonies, etc. and this was a great opportunity for them to discuss the dynamics of their get-togethers. We had some really nice discussion with each other and with the audience members, as well.\n\nI had a kitchen session a few weeks ago up in CT and had brought this up with those friends. We talked about trust, friendship and a relatively politically free atmosphere. I brought up some of my thoughts from that session. We talked about being in the moment, listening first and playing second, etc.\n\nBill presented a poem from last New Year’s Eve with Bill and his daughter Rachel:\n\n“Dammit, Dave, you gave us a stage, A place to come and play.\n\nDammit, Dave, you gave us a stage, What more can I say?”\n\nThere was a nice, supportive audience, especially with some of Bill and Carole’s family in town for Thanksgiving. In fact, I had the chance to play Bob Franke’s Thanksgiving Eve song and it really hit home.\n\nThanksgiving Eve – Bob Franke\n\nIt’s so easy to dream of the days gone by, D C G\n\nIt’s a hard thing to think of the times to come. D A D\n\nBut the grace to accept ev’ry moment as a gift, D C G\n\nIs a gift that is given to some. D A D\n\nChorus:\n\nWhat can you do with your days but work & hope, A G D A\n\nLet your dreams bind your work to your play. G A\n\nWhat can you do with each moment of your life, D C G\n\nBut love til you’ve loved it away, D G A\n\nLove til you’ve loved it away. D G A D\n\nThere are sorrows enough for the whole world’s end,\n\nThere are no guarantees but the grave.\n\nAnd the life that I live & the time I have spent,\n\nAre a treasure too precious to save.\n\nIt was a very good evening, and people were thankful for it.\n\nThis was a good one. The topic tonight was Country Blues Guitar and my guest was my good friend Craig Thatcher. I’ve admired Craig’s electric guitar work for decades but he has become a wonderful acoustic player and supporter of Godfrey’s over the last few decades, as well. He now tours the world for Martin Guitar and I can’t think of a better ambassador than him for this legendary company.\n\nI asked my friend Mance Robinson to do a short set in the middle and he knocked it out of the park with a Lightning Hopkins and a Skip James tune. It was a tough set for him in front of a crowd of folks unfamiliar with him but his playing and his patter were spot on. I am proud of the man and the player he’s become. People tuned in.\n\nI started out with a Mississippi John Hurt tune, See See Rider which Craig immediately picked up on. We talked about the blues as a common language and that we didn’t have to rehearse for this. We passed back and forth Robert Johnson, Mance Lipscomb, Blind Willie McTell, Willie Dixon, Rev. Robert Wilkins, Jorma Kaukonen, Woody Mann, and a whole panoply of influences, cultural effects, British rock bands and more. It was an incredibly rich evening of intelligent music and talk. It was a deep dive.\n\nI got to play Charlie James, Delia, Spoonful, Prodigal Son, Fishin’ Blues during the set. All pretty cool songs. I sang them well (so I’m told) and Craig had some great leads on all of them. Again, he knows how to find the spaces.\n\nI particularly felt good with preparing material for the show: a wide spectrum of styles, picking techniques, tunings and accompanying stories and lore. Craig said that we could go on for hours. I agreed.\n\nIt is an incredible pleasure to share the stage with Craig. His instincts, his chops and his stage presence are at an incredible professional level. He listens first and plays second. We both had our antennae up tonight and the audience sensed it. I was able to raise my game thanks to his presence. It was a college-level seminar tonight. All for a $10 ticket.\n\nIt was an almost full house, but with too many no-shows, especially when we announced a sell-out earlier. Drat. The magic of Craig filled the house but I can only hope that folks will come back for future DNO’s. The atmosphere remains electric, regardless of the guests and the size of the crowd.\n\nI realized afterward that I am a “product” driven artist. I had something to prepare for (I could have done more) and developed material that was well-played, interesting and professional. I could count on my fearless banter to fill in the spaces and it worked. But I need a deadline inspiration to put me to work: my Troubadour album, the Steppin’ Out! shows and other public appearances. It’s the kitchen work that suffers when I should be playing for myself and my art. I need to kick myself in the ass to just pick up the guitar and play. I need more gigs to challenge me.\n\nI got to drag out some of my old instruments (which sounded great tonight) along with a new borrowed Tri-Cone, and I enjoyed playing some of my favorite Martin friends.\n\nI am proud of tonight’s show in this particular venue with my friends on stage. The totality of this situations didn’t strike me until now. Intelligent music in front of an intelligent audience in an intelligent venue. There ya go.\n\nI invited two fine folks for my first Dave’s Night Out of the fall season for an Old School Country evening at Godfrey’s. Per usual, it was sparsely attended, but that doesn’t affect the quality of music, information or communication that goes on. One woman said that it’s like being in one’s living room, and, technically, that’s true.\n\nJack Murray is a close friend and Brian Molnar is a new one, but I was sure that we could cross our country roots quite well. And we did. Jack knows what I’m trying to do with this format and Brian picked up quickly about the chat/music/audience interaction concept and really came through.\n\nI started off with Wildwood Flower on guitar with Jack chiming in. A good place to begin. Brian did a nice Appalachian Cuckoo’s Nest and we were off. Over the course of the night we shared Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams, Willie and Merle, Delmore Brothers, Lefty Frizzell, Dylan’s Nashville Skyline days, cowboy songs and our individual takes on contemporary takes on great country tunes. Bonnie Wren moved up to sing on I’ll Be Your Baby Tonight.\n\nAnd, as usual, the conversation was crisp, informative and humorous (that’s why I’m here….), and the music was well played, the essence of what this event should be.\n\nI picked out Back in the Saddle Again, I’ll Be Your Baby Tonight, Rodeo Rider, and a solid version of Mother, the Queen of My Heart and noodled on mandolin on some of the others’ tunes. I learned a bunch of country minutiae about spurned wives, arcane business dealings and a general appreciation for the breadth and width of all that is Country Music. (It was hard to play Mother, Queen…. with my friend Dave’s recent passing of his mom while he was right in front of me…. but that’s what country music’s for…). I made a few errors on a few songs (I really should prepare more for these…) but that’s the lure of these extemporaneous evenings.\n\nThere were obvious mentions of the Ken Burns series going on, as we speak, and, perhaps that, and the early GD season, made for a small audience. But, over all, I’m glad that the PBS series is a cultural presence, is wonderfully produced, and may spark some interest in the Americana music we’ve all been performing for decades. In a way, it is a cultural vindication of what folk music is all about. That’s powerful stuff.\n\nI got to share all of this stuff with a few friends and fellow musicians in my house: Godfrey Daniels.\n\nIt is always a pleasure to spend time with Pete Kennedy, talking about the biz of performance, folk music and guitar. Tonight was no different. Pete, besides being a great guitarist, is a highly intelligent and creative person who also happens to be a good listener. I enjoy his respect for what I do as much as I respect his talents so I was able to share some of what I do as a Teaching Artist.\n\nThere were few folks in the house tonight, per usual, but the two hours passed by quickly, leaving all in the room slightly intoxicated with the proceedings. Pete is able to clearly expound on guitar technique, songwriting, touring, performance and philosophy. Definitely my kind of person.\n\nTonight was interesting in that I now have the possibility of taking these DNO shows to a new level on the internet. Ron Olesko, folk radio programmer, is now putting together an internet radio station and wants to include a Dave’s Night Out weekly show. This would fit the bill perfectly. Ron is looking for material that is not just spinning records but something deeper. Both Pete and I were aware of playing to this potential audience as well as to the few folks in the house.\n\nPete played behind some of my tunes: Branching Out, Pinto Pony, I’m Part of the Union and Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, and was able to describe his thoughts on how to back up the song. Listen first, add in small licks, face the singer (address the performer’s presence), play lead when needed, be aware of the dynamics of the song and support the song. All very obvious techniques that, unfortunately, few are aware of.\n\nPete also stepped up with several great musical moments, including his Rhapsody in Blue on Uke and a spontaneous Greatest Guitar Licks medley that was astounding. He is a brilliant player.\n\nIt is remarkable that Pete makes this trip out of the NY for a measly $100 on a Wednesday night to share this stage with me. He knows what this is all about. I have the greatest respect for folk like him who respect Godfrey Daniels and myself as a fellow musician. Transcendental. And it is a shame that the Lehigh Valley doesn’t come out to support this series. Perhaps folk radio will change this.\n\nI signed up to be tour manager for Erik Frandsen. Erik was one of the early NYC performers to play Godfrey’s in ’76, amazing us all with his deft guitar work, expansive repertoire and quick wit. It had been a long time since he’s played here and the Dave’s Night Out format was a good way to have him back. He is a very intense man.\n\nSince he’s a NYC boy (without a car….), I said I would pick him up and take him back. He took me for my word and that made for a long day. I headed out at 12:30 to pick him up around 2:30 so we could beat the afternoon traffic back to the Valley. My GPS took me into the Bronx by mistake but I figured it out and made it to The Village by 2:45. Not too bad.\n\nWe had a good ride back as I asked him about living in the City, acting for a living, playing small gigs in cafes, etc. Erik took me across the street for a meal. He had a burger, onion rings, a beer and a double Jameson. We headed back for a quick sound check and the 7 pm show.\n\nIt was nice to see some old fans in the house, including Dick Boak, Rolly Brown, Anne Mintz and others who knew Erik from way back when. I told Erik that I would kick it off and then let him play two songs to my one. Rolly came up and did a song as well. Erik’s still a great performer, incredible guitarist and superb songwriter. After one of his fine jazzy tunes, I remarked that his songs are cinematic, essentially a movie boiled down to 4 minutes. Erik commands the stage (and the conversation) and I remarked to Rolly that I was lucky to finish the evening unscathed. He can be acerbic to a fault, but tonight was a friendly one. Driving back, he mentioned several times what a great gig it was for him. I didn’t make any money, paid for gas and tolls but no matter. It was all worth it. I serve the master gladly.\n\nI had to hustle him into the car for the ride back to the Village (thankfully, it’s a fairly straight shot in and out of the Holland Tunnel) and it was smooth sailing. I dropped him off on Bleeker Street and I made it back a little after midnight. I was exhausted.\n\nThis was an interesting and refreshing DNO, featuring three of my poet friends (yes, female) on stage at Godfrey’s for my monthly artistic chat. Ah, yes, poets! Ann Michael, Cleveland Wall and Danielle Notaro are wonderful poets; they know how to write and present their works on stage. That’s not always the case.\n\nEarly on, I understood that I should not assume the focus tonight but stumbled upon the idea of my adding some instrumentals to the mix, and that turned out to be a really good thing. I set up stage left and emceed and played from there, and the three ladies took stage center. We proceeded with a round robin that proved entertaining, fairly fast-paced, and made the evening go quickly.\n\nCleveland, who is an active member of our TALV sessions, was great. She does her poems from memory and she is able to add subtle movement and eye-contact. Danielle is a more aggressive poet and performer who has recently linked her work with some musicians. Ann is a good friend in my small family circle but has a boat-load of thoughtful and introspective poems that I follow with her on her FB.\n\nThere was a small crowd, as usual, but pretty hip. Anne prepared a “Poet Quiz” that I used. These folks knew their Ozymandias’s. We talked about extending poetry into other means of cross-pollination: music, movies, video, etc. Each woman shared thoughts about how they write. We talked about songwriters being poets, and on from there.\n\nAs far as my part, I was comfortable in guiding the evening along. I picked out Fountain Hill Nightmare Rag (theme song from Live from GD radio show), Foxglove (in heavy rotation in my kitchen), and, on the mandolin, my Star of the County Down/Heel and Toe Polka medley. I also snuck in Si Bheag, Si Mhor. on the guitar. I found out later from David, her husband, that it is one of her favorites. I am particularly glad that I could add my ‘finger-voice’ to the show, without it being my masculine voice.\n\nAs usual, my friends and the audience thanked me for presenting poetry here at Godfrey’s. Thinking back though, I was probably running out of musical ideas for guests at the time. But that’s between you and me.\n\nI was really looking forward to this one: Jeff, Kris and I had one rehearsal ten days ago when Kris and I met up with Jeff for the first time. I knew Jeff was steeped in Cockburn material and we really hit it off, familiar with most of this collective material. Synch.\n\nTonight, we got together for a sound check/review before the gig and got our feet on the ground. We started off with Wonder Where the Lions Are, and in spite of some arrangement fluffs, it was a good start with – one of Bruce’s more familiar tunes and a great sing-along, too. We then passed around the lead for the next two hours and actually had enough material to fill it.\n\nThe conversation was sparse tonight; most folks had a passing knowledge of the Bruce while some were quite into him (like the dudes on the stage). We were comfortable in backing each other up and Kris did a yeoman’s job on bass, really nailing the chord changes and went a long way into establishing the songs. I particularly enjoyed being able to improvise on mandolin for their tunes. I did well leading my repertoire, in spite of some small kerfuffles, it was great to play these tunes in an ensemble, something new for me.\n\nI was able to share my deep appreciation of Cockburn’s genius: his amazing guitar chops, his musical diversity, global humanitarian philosophy, deep spiritual connections and (importantly to me) relatively non-dogmatic Christianity. I really respect that. His spirituality couples with his musical/poetic creativity I find magnificent. He is the best.\n\nI brought out:\n\nWonder Where the Lions Are (E) – trading verses with Jeff\n\nMamma Just Wants to Barrelhouse (E) – always a pleasure to play\n\nFoxglove instrumental (C tuning) – almost pulled it off, Kris surprised me with his bass accompaniment. Good though, for next time.\n\nThe Blues Got the World by the Balls (G) – a nice, funky finger-pick blues\n\nCry of a Tiny Babe and Mary Had a Baby, two of my favorite Christmas tunes.\n\nWhat About the Bond (Bm) – my current favorite, a reggae-esque tune, nailed it.\n\nTokyo (E) – 80’s rocker that is quite different in my current repertoire. nailed it.\n\nIf I had a Rocket Launcher (E) – still a great historical and, yet contemporary song – good presentation but I missed the ending, again. Still…..\n\nKris also brought out some nice tunes on 12-string guitar, bari mandolin (that was a hoot), solid bass and was the glue for the evening. My friend.\n\nLove Loves You Too – (D)\n\nWhole Night Sky – (C)\n\nWaiting For a Miracle – (C)\n\nSouthland of the Heart – (Bb) (baritone mandolin)\n\nJeff has a great repertoire that I haven’t covered but covet. He was struggling with tuning his old Martin, and was somewhat new to this “listening” audience, but he settled in with some great tunes. He had Coldest Night of the Year in reserve to follow up the dark Rocket Launcher with a point-on love song on a very cold November evening.\n\nWondering Where the Lions Are (E)\n\nPeggy’s Kitchen Wall (D)\n\nLast Night of the World\n\nAll the Ways I Want You (G)\n\nPacing the Cage (E)\n\nSee How I Miss You (C)\n\nRocket Launcher (E)\n\nColdest Night of the Year (D)\n\nThe audience hung in there for a long evening. If this were a weekend gig, it would be a good two-set night. Folks seemed to like it and we played well, shared the stage as friends and got our Cockburn on. We agreed that we should do this again. It’s just great music. A rare treat for us all.\n\nAs always, these gatherings are wonderfully inspiring, informative and fun – and under-attended. Tonight’s topic was Sing and Swing so I invited two marvelous swingsters Rolly Brown and Wendi Bourne. Wendi has sung on all of my albums but she also is a great stride guitarist as well, working with Girls from Mars and other tight vocal groups. Rolly is a master guitarist and teacher and they’ve both played together for years.\n\nI started out with The Barnyard Dance, one of several swing-ish tunes I do and then let Wendi and Rolly loose on their real swing tunes, Wendi laying down the rhythm chops, Rolly playing leads and then Wendi chiming in with some great scat singing. Along the way, we talked about some of the great influences that have shaped swing music in our repertoires, the various variations of blues, lounge, jazz, Texas Swing, and more. Django, Bob Wills, Joe Pass, Ella Fitzgerald, and more. We covered a lot of bases during the evening, chatted with the audience and played some fine music. I had the best seat in the house, between these two friends.\n\nDuring the course of the evening, I pulled out Dan Hicks’ Crazy Cause He Is, one I hadn’t planned on but pulled off, spur of the moment. I did Cab Calloway’s Hey Now and Leon Redbone’s Walking Stick as well. They fit in nicely with Rolly and Wendi’s standards, though not up to the brilliance of their playing. But, it’s how the evening rolls.\n\nI am barely in the same league with both Wendi and Rolly as far as swing expertise but that’s neither here or there when it comes to our friendships and mutual respect. I come away with a really good feeling with the high quality of the evening’s entertainment, and I know that Wendi and Rolly and the small audience did, too.\n\nTonight was a good night at Godfrey’s. Sam Steffen returned from Philly for a song swap with myself and a good crowd of friends and admirers. Sam is a special songwriter who writes epic topical songs that have biblical storytelling hooks (lots of Samson referrals tonight) that still are linked to his personal experiences. Most of his songs have a dozen or more verses, his language is rich and his wordplay extraordinary. Since he moved to Philly over a year ago with his fiance Jamil, he’s been working with the homeless, trying to facilitate postal addresses for them (if you don’t have a home, you don’t have property and you don’t have an address – making you a non-person officially). So, he’s walking the walk.\n\nSam did two songs for every on of mine, but I tried to do some hard-hitting songs like Ten Men and Rocket Launcher as well as some positive tunes like We Are Welcomed, I Can See Clearly Now and Step by Step. A bunch of these were new to most of the audience. Some friends came up afterward and thanked us for Sam’s amazing tunes and my aggressive guitar work, a good combination. Did I say I love my Martin 000-15M?\n\nAs always, these Dave’s Night Out sessions are remarkably intellectually challenging and fulfilling. I’m proud that I’ve developed this unique series. Next month: Sing and Swing with Wendi Bourne and Rolly Brown.\n\nTonight was another special evening with my friends Anne Hills and Jay Ansill. They are working on a special folk music program about Robert Graves and his connection with English and Scottish ballads. It was a workshop for Jay and Anne as they prepare for a concert in Majorca at the Graves’ family home next month. They’ve already done a more classical concert of Grave’s poetry and a string ensemble but are preparing a different presentation for this trip.\n\nIt was good for Anne and Jay to play these songs in front of people and it was an opportunity for me to present the idea of folk ballads in this series. I did have to guide them occasionally into the DNO format, encourage questions and play a few of my songs in the process.\n\nThankfully, Anne and Jay are pros. They were able to present their material, talk about Graves and this special project. The audience was primarily Anne fans so that was fine. The chat was quite fun, spontaneous and informative. I asked some related questions (unaccompanied ballads, song derivations, etc.) and we tumbled on. Anne and Jay have done some heavy lifting in developing this Robert Graves show. It will be quite the event, and an international feather in their caps. I love the fact that my friends can travel the world and play in some incredible venues.\n\nI got to play Tom Lehrer’s Irish Ballad for some levity and The Ballad of Ned Kelly, a more recent tune I’ve been working on, in order to maintain some presence in the process. It worked out fine.\n\nI’m not sure that the DNO audiences realize how consistently amazing these nights are. Jay, Anne and I really enjoyed tonight’s gathering.\n\nPer usual, these nights are exceptional evenings of good music and talk. Tonight featured two fine New Jersey songwriters who have been in the Godfrey’s orbit for many years. Bill Hall, of course, has been in attendance at our open mike for years, and is a regular over the last 5 years. Gregg Cagno was a frequent visitor in the eighties but is a rare show nowadays. It was a delight to pair them together tonight.\n\nGregg was a founding member of Camp Hoboken, a songwriting group in the 80’s and remains an accomplished songwriter. He pulled out some gems tonight, including some nice reflections on middle age (Living in the Middle Ages) and a great take on writing pop love songs (The Part That Repeats). Clever, clever, clever.\n\nBill’s repertoire is more familiar but he’s written some wonderful songs as well. He did his classic Rosie is a Friend of Mind, Going Out Tonight and The Gypsy and the Lady. I got some nice takes on these songs and look forward to sharing them on the radio.\n\nI pulled out Smoking Babies as well as We Are Welcomed and Step By Step for practice for Saturday’s No Place for Hate benefit at Godfrey’s.\n\nWe had some good chat about playing for non-listening audiences (I take it as a challenge) and good ole Jersey songwriting.\n\nThere were (again) a handful of folks in the audience but several came up after the show and thanked me for providing this concept for our Godfrey’s audience. True dat!\n\nIt was great to share the stage with Mary Faith again, celebrating 45 years of performing together. She has the gift of gab, so my task was to find places to play the music. It was a good night all around. No problem.\n\nMary was already a traveled folk performer when I met her in the mid-70’s: she was already traveling to France and Canada, writing songs, playing lap dulcimer. She was a legend in the local Bethlehem scene. Mary and the Sheiks hooked up before the Godfrey’s era, backing each other up, sharing the stage at festivals near by. She then invited me to go with her and her mom up to the Winnipeg Folk Festival for an experience that gave me a world-view of the folk music scene – in many ways.\n\nTonight we shared a few hammered dulcimer tunes, some of her original songs while I came up with Stan Rogers’ Giant and Lessons from Pete that she joined in on concertina as well. I accompanied some of her songs on mandolin. Mary still has got it, and I was challenged throughout the evening.\n\nThere was a small crowd, as usual, but many had come out to see Mary, since she rarely plays out. In fact, I had asked her to do one of these DNOs several years ago and she declined, saying she wasn’t up to playing on stage. She’s turned it around.\n\nWe had great chat about traditional music, the dulcimer, Winnipeg and her various world travels, Stan Rogers, Steve Goodman and Richard Farina.\n\nIt was a good night with my old friend Mary Faith.\n\nThese are always fascinating evenings and this one was particularly interesting. Two relatively new women exploring the singer-songwriter field but with different life experiences. Jordyn Kenzie is a Charter Arts School student but has been writing songs and poetry since she was twelve, but has gathered herself quite remarkably in on-stage poise, as well as vocal and songwriting chops. Rachel has a decade more experience and is beginning to perform in some East Coast folk venues and has a history here at Godfrey’s.\n\nBetween the songs, I guided the conversation to “owning your stage presence”, working in the studio, vocal lessons, singing in Old French, etc. and both stepped up with intelligent comments and reflections. This only happens during these DNO sessions.\n\nAt the end, I commented that it would be wonderful to hear these two women on this stage twenty years from now. I’m sure they will be crafty performers.\n\nAnother moment at the end: I asked each to comment on what they liked about each other’s music. Jordyn said, “That voice!” She loved Rachel’s quirky persona and her strong songs. Rachel loved Jordyn’s fluid voice and confident presentation and songs. It was a particularly wonderful moment.\n\nAs usual, a sparse turnout for an engaging evening. I even got to play a few tunes myself.\n\nGeorge Hrab is quite the artist and media maven, and he was someone I wanted to get to know better, and this was the perfect way to do it. I am familiar with his reputation as a quirky songwriter and as the drummer for the Philly Funk Authority, a superb 11 piece band, but had never seen him in action. He did sit in with Dina and myself at Musikfest once. That was it.\n\nI primed myself with his web site, checked out his weekly webcast, and counted on his outgoing personality and our mutual respect tomake this work. This was going to be good.\n\nI usually start with a tune and did Pay Bo Diddley, and though he didn’t take a lead on his acoustic, we did trade some nice atmospheric licks, and created some spontaneous fireflies. I knew we were on the same wavelength.\n\nGeorge brought out his delightfully esoteric tunes like When I Was Your Age, The Misconception Song, I Don’t Believe in Christmas and Everything Alive Will Die Someday. But we really got into discussions on skepticism, the creative process and other heady topics. There was lots of room for both of us, and I’m glad I can provide a comfortable space for the the artist and the audience, too. The conversations were really good and it is a rare opportunity for dialogue the artist and the crowd.\n\nThere was a crowd! As satisfying as these evenings are, I am somewhat disappointed in the turnout for them. George brought in a good number of folks who were bright and receptive to this format. I think the audience came away enlightened and entertained. I certain was, and so was George.\n\nAlways a treat, and especially with curious George.\n\nI’ve been recuperating from some eyelid surgery (basal cell) during some intentional downtime in my schedule. I was hoping to wear a pirate’s patch for Halloween, but it seems I’m spooky enough without it.\n\nI did do a Dave’s Night Out with Sam Steffen last night and a RockRoots this afternoon, so I’m back on the boards though pretty exhausted from the effort.\n\nSam Steffen joined me in a night of topical songs which he is quite adept at, with songs about unemployment, black lives matter and other rye commentary on modern life. He has come a long way with his compositions, both lengthy and deep. It was a good crowd for one of these evenings and Sam stepped up. I added a few tunes to the mix including Study War No More, Ten Men, If I Had a Rocket Launcher and Put the Frack Back, one I had written several years ago for a protest in Allentown. It was good to unpack it and sing it again.\n\nThe RockRoots gang headed to Far Hills, NJ, thankfully not an epic trek, for an afternoon assembly at a Day School (read posh private school). 250 K – 8th graders and their teachers were all great. We played well and the school loved the show. Again, this show is routinely successful, the band plays well, I remember the lines and folk dig it all. I made it back through relatively smooth Friday traffic.\n\nI set up sound at Godfrey’s for the Celtic band and got the show going before heading upstair to write this blog. A busy 24 hours and I’m glad I have some down time before Sunday’s next gig at Brookside C.C."
