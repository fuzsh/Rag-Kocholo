        "text": "Paste has been in existence since July 2002, but it’s taken 22 years for us to sit down and make a “Greatest Albums of All Time” list. Every reputable outlet has done this at some point or another; each magazine piecing together a vastly different collection of picks. Doing a list like this is a fool’s errand for the most part, as picking any number of records and labeling them “the best” is subjective and likely wrong—but, if the internet has taught us anything, it’s that we all love to tap in, disagree and hold discourse. It’s the lifeblood of criticism and art forms with canons that are diverse and extensive, and the history of popular music spans decades: from Depression-era radio through the Moondog Coronation Ball birthing rock ‘n’ roll in Cleveland in 1952 through the British Invasion through the alt-rock explosion of the 1990s to now, as Taylor Swift and Beyoncé are monolithic in a global ecosystem of sights and sounds. The criteria for what constitutes a “great album,” to us, falls someplace in-between influence and timelessness. That’s how you get a list featuring the Talking Heads, Death, Mariah Carey and Lana Del Rey.\n\nFor this list, we called on our entire writing cohort—including editors, staff writers, interns and freelancers far and wide—to send in their individual Top 20 lists. We then took those lists, along with editorial oversight, and compiled what we believe is a selection of music that represents what Paste believes is the best to have ever been recorded. Our picks are subjective, and we aren’t going to sit back and consider this list some end-all, be-all document. Truthfully, we had a lot of fun putting this whole thing together and considering what music has been so definitive to us as a publication over the last 22 years. Now, we can’t wait to hear what you all think. (See the end of our list for a mix of our favorite songs from the 300 greatest albums of all time.)\n\nContributors: Matt Mitchell, Olivia Abercrombie, Josh Jackson, Garrett Martin, Robert Ham, Grant Sharples, Niko Stratis, Sam Rosenberg, Devon Chodzin, Hayden Merrick, Elizabeth Braaten, Elise Soutar, Matty Pywell, Tom Williams, Matt Melis, Ellen Johnson, Victoria Wasylak, Sean Fennell, Annie Nickoloff, Andy Steiner, Eric R.

Modest Mouse: The Lonesome Crowded West (1997)\n\nIt’s been over 25 years since the release of Modest Mouse’s iconic second album, and few indie-rock records in the decades since have managed to blend the chaotic showmanship, enduring hooks and lasting vision present in the 78-minute opus. As vast, gnarly and, at times, as downright ugly as its namesake, this is a record where an Orange Julius is made as holy as God’s shoeshine and a Saturday night with Cowboy Dan doing the cockroach is the height of culture. Frontman Isaac Brock and his bandmates have made many good to great records, but it is The Lonesome Crowded West that captures their vision of a warped American Dream most succinctly. —Sean Fennell\n\n299. Rihanna: Anti (2016)\n\nBy the time Rihanna released her eighth album, she’d never really captured a complete, well-rounded project. Rated R, Loud and Unapologetic were all good, but caught themselves illuminated by the successes of hit singles rather than a full-bodied cohesion. But Anti changed all of that in 2016. Songs like “Work,” “Love on the Brain” and “Needed Me” remain bombastic fusions of hip-hop, soul, dancehall and psychedelia, and deeper cuts like “Desperado,” “Consideration” and “Higher” are massive earworms toned by lo-fi beats and cross-tempo vocalizations and arrangements. As a whole, Anti didn’t make itself out to be a radio-friendly smash hit; Rihanna leaned into her superstardom by exploring sonic eclecticism and penning tracks that reached into the pockets of desire, alcohol and relationships, both through betrayal and empowering love. It’s the kind of career-triumph that few artists of the last 25 years have had. —Matt Mitchell\n\n298. Queen: Jazz (1978)\n\nThe two songs I first remember sticking with me from my mom’s Queen Greatest Hits CD were the absurd, catchy lyricism of the sonic siblings “Fat Bottomed Girls” and “Bicycle Race”—there was nothing funnier to my six-year-old self than a guy fervently proclaiming he wants to ride his bicycle. Jazz continues the ridiculous lyrics with “Don’t Stop Me Now,” which is just Freddie Mercury going on and on about being a “sex machine.” However, it is often interpreted as a song about perseverance—which fits right into the hilarity Jazz achieves. The record is also iconic for being tagged as a “fascist” record by Rolling Stone upon its release. Jazz showcases an exorbitantly confident Queen, who are playful and campy in a way that encapsulates an entire career of pushing boundaries and prioritizing their unique sense of humor. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n297. Terry Riley: A Rainbow in Curved Air (1969)\n\nTerry Riley is often lumped in with 20th Century minimalists, like Philip Glass and Steve Reich. But where those artists aimed to reinvigorate classical techniques, Riley’s work is more heady and colorful. His 1969 record, A Rainbow In Curved Air, isn’t just an ambient masterpiece; it’s a tour de force in psychedelia. After spending years working to recontextualize orchestral instrumentation, A Rainbow In Curved Air found Riley playing into bohemian tropes of the era. Across two compositions that both hover around the 20-minute mark, fluttering synthesizer and harpsichord melodies are permeated by fleeting tambourine and hand drum rhythms, as well as innovative tape effects. The original cover art featured a poem by Riley, imagining America toppled by utopianism—reinforcing A Rainbow In Curved Air’s place as one of the most upward-gazing records ever. —Ted Davis\n\n296. The Raincoats: The Raincoats (1979)\n\nA favorite of anyone with a Kat Stratford obsession, the Raincoats were a driving force in the female-led punk movement, and their self-titled debut cemented them as icons of feminist punk. In 1979, they released The Raincoats, an experimental DIY rock record with Ana da Silva and Gina Birch’s vocal sass dueling with a playful intensity. Their debut became a cornerstone for many “riot grrrl” bands for its unapologetically messy production, off-kilter rhythms and vulnerable yet snarky lyricism. Palmolive’s frenzied drumming style paired with da Silva’s jerky guitar are a match made in DIY heaven, notably for how their chaos intertwines with the melodic bass grooves of Birch. It’s a seamless combination of musicality and havoc. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n295. Bad Brains: Bad Brains (1981)\n\nRecording the Bad Brains in the early ‘80s must have been like trying to photograph the moment a tornado touches down. By the time the punk pioneers committed this self-titled record to tape, they’d already inspired a generation of DC bands and decamped to New York City, ready to strum stormy circles around their counterparts, the Ramones. The Yellow Tape, as it’s also known, isn’t their cleanest work of this era—they had a Ric Ocasek-produced LP on the way a year later—but it may be the most impactful document of the Bad Brains’ early efforts to push punk and reggae fusion past the limits of shrieking speed and spirituality. It remains undisputed hardcore canon, but in another few years, they were already “Sailin’ On” to more ambitious genre blends. —Taylor Ruckle\n\n294. Deulgukhwa: 들국화 (1985)\n\nDeulgukhwa’s debut studio album is a masterful entry into South Korea’s rock pantheon, dropped right into the middle of the country’s pop music renaissance in the mid 1980s. March is the only album Deulgukhwa made that features their OG lineup (Jeon In-kwon, Choi Seong-won, Jo Deok-hwan, Heo Seong-wook), and it sounds like a perfect amalgam of the chart-topping arena music of its era and the jaw-dropping hooks of modern K-pop. “That’s My World” blisters along with a head-splitting guitar solo from Deok-hwan enveloped by Seong-won’s synthesizers. In-kwon establishes himself as one of the greatest Korean frontmen of all time, belting stadium-sized vocals with a backdrop of anthemic technicolor from Deok-hwan and drummer Joo Chan-kwon. The sublime, sugar-sweet euphoria of “Bless You” pairs nicely with the acoustic, piano-pillowed balladry of “Just Love,” and “Until the Morning Rises” is the kind of crooner bravado replicated later in the decade by English-language great George Michael on something like “One More Try.” March sounds as epic as anything American and English pop rock was producing at the same time, perhaps even more so. —Matt Mitchell\n\n293. Ice Cube: AmeriKKKa’s Most Wanted (1990)\n\nAfter walking away from N.W.A., the L.A. group that instantly put him in the upper echelon of lyricists and rappers, Ice Cube spent some time in New York, holed up in the studio space of production team the Bomb Squad. He went through their voluminous record collection looking for inspiration and what would become the sound of his first solo album. What they landed on was an album that carried the same density as the Squad’s other famous collaborators Public Enemy but was much more funky. The feel of the beats loosened Cube’s tongue considerably. He remained true to the storytelling vibe he established on Straight Outta Compton with his clear-eyed perspective on life in South Central L.A. but developed a leaner pugnaciousness that helped fuel the war on words with his former partners and cut down to size the fools that dared to question his skills and strength. —Robert Ham\n\n292. David Bowie: Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps) (1980)\n\nFew artists held court over rock ‘n’ roll quite like David Bowie did between 1971 and 1980. Starting his reign with Hunky Dory, the Thin White Duke dropped a run of 11 albums that, when it was all said and done, stand alone in the canon of popular music. You could go Heroes or Station to Station here, sure, but there’s something particularly perfect about Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), the perfect merger of glam rock and disco. “Ashes to Ashes” calls back to Major Tom, while “Fashion” blurs the line between trends in music and clothes. Bowie here is at the forefront of his clubbiest self, and the title-track is a perfect mirage of metallic, sleazy, post-punk debauchery. Time and time again, when I return to Scary Monsters, it is to check in with “Teenage Wildlife,” the track that has long flown under the radar of Bowie’s career but might just be the most anthemic piece of his chameleonic, influential puzzle—the same old thing in brand new drag. —Matt Mitchell\n\n291. Camarón: La leyenda del tiempo (1979)\n\nCamarón de la Isla is one of the greatest flamenco singers of all time, and his 10th album—La leyenda del tiempo—is his best and most polarizing work. The record saw Camarón making a departure from the traditional flamenco styles that had become definitive of Spain’s music scene, and the work alienated the genre’s purists and wound up culminating into a commercial failure (despite its critical acclaim). Now, we can look back at La leyenda del tiempo as the key example of flamenco’s sea change—as the genre was never the same before or after, all thanks to songs like the rumba of “Volando Voy” and the otherworldly-good title-track that catalyzes the album’s forward-momentum. Camarón’s voice here is one-of-a-kind, and the dual flamenco guitars from Tomatito and Raimundo Amador are some of the best guitar work on an album ever. —Matt Mitchell\n\n290. The Fall: The Wonderful and Frightening World Of… (1984)\n\nAddictively repetitive melodies, the banging of not one, but two drummers, Mark E. Smith’s signature vocal snarl and a world of garagey post-punk experimentation go into one freaky, fun The Fall album. This, the band’s seventh of an impressive 31-studio album roster, showcases some real bits of discordant wonderful-and-frightening tunes, like “Disney’s Dream Debased,” “Elves,” “C.R.E.E.P.” and “Oh! Brother”—a slew of punky, political touchpoints which still feel relevant four decades later. The Wonderful and Frightening World Of The Fall captures the influential post-punk band in a solid, shining moment of scuzzy excellence. —Annie Nickoloff\n\n289. Britney Spears: …Baby One More Time (1999)\n\nWe all know it. The pigtails. The mini skirt. The complete schoolgirl fantasy. However, when a 16-year-old future pop phenomenon grabbed that narrative and made it her own, the mainstream musical landscape was altered forever. A star straight from the crib, Spears spent her entire childhood crafting a persona fit for a pop princess performing in the Mickey Mouse Club, appearing in Broadway shows and even on Star Search. It was practically written in the stars that she was destined to become a megastar, and she proved it on …Baby One More Time. With her distinctive mellowed-out sexy vocals and unstoppable presence, the album’s lead single, “…Baby One More Time,” blasted her to international success. While it’s impossible to compare the caliber of the other tracks to such a mega-hit, the dial-up pop ballad “Sometimes” and the bubblegum pop fantasy “(You Drive Me) Crazy” proved that Spears’s vocal ability was one to be reckoned with. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n288. The Who: Tommy (1969)\n\nTo borrow slightly from Tommy’s “Overture,” Captain Walker never came home, and he’ll never know that his (fictional) absence helped spawn one of rock’s most epic narratives. To follow The Who Sell Out, the British band devoted 24 tracks and 74 minutes to unraveling the fraught life of one pinball wizard, Tommy Walker. Bursts of acoustic suspense and hard rock rapture on songs like “Sparks” and “I’m Free” demonstrate the band’s approach to sound-driven storytelling, as they hone the vibrations that their “deaf, dumb and blind” titular character largely relies on to understand the world. “When you listen to the music you can actually become aware of the boy, and aware of what he is all about, because we are creating him as we play,” guitarist Pete Townshend reflected, an approach that has resulted in Tommy doubling as the quintessential rock opera, and to many fans, the quintessential record from The Who. —Victoria Wasylak\n\n287. Bonnie ‘Prince’ Billy: I See a Darkness (1999)\n\nLove and loss. Hope and fear. Dreams and dread. Death, death and more death. These are the themes that ripple through I See A Darkness, Will Oldham’s sixth full-length album but first as Bonnie “Prince” Billy, a name he has used ever since. Perhaps it is no coincidence, then, that this is where the Kentuckian’s eccentric vision comes into sharp focus: Appalachian-inspired country-folk, existential musings, vivid storytelling, strange phrasing and a pervasive sense of unease. These are timeless songs that keep you on your toes. —Ben Salmon\n\n286. The KLF: Chill Out (1990)\n\nWhile largely a thing of the past, every great party used to have a chill-out room—a space for overwhelmed ravers to decompress as night trudged into morning. UK duo The KLF spent most of their career putting out blocky acid house bangers. But their third album, 1990’s Chill Out, is an uncharacteristically atmospheric detour. Intended as a balm for clubbers on the come down, the record uses clattering samples, stabby synths and lonesome slide guitar swells to portray a journey through the American Gulf Coast states. On top of being an interesting relic from a formatively hedonistic moment in underground culture, the interconnected tracks are downright stunning. The whole thing captures the energy of watching the sunrise over a muddy field, dissociated from the constraints of societal convention. —Ted Davis\n\n285. Lil’ Kim: Hard Core (1996)\n\nLil’ Kim’s finest fashion moment was not when Diana Ross jiggled her purple-pasty-clad breast at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, nor was it the photoshoot where she snapped into an iconic squat wearing little more than a leopard print bikini. Instead, it’s one of the first lyrics on her album Hard Core, demanding one orgasm per carat in her diamond rings. “That’s how many times I wanna come / 21 / And another one, and another one,” she begins to boast on “Big Momma Thang,” the Jay-Z collab from her raunchy solo debut. Lil’ Kim’s ravenous libido and no-nonsense attitude penetrate every aspect of Hard Core—as she assumes the role of self-appointed rap royalty, her first decree being to refocus the public’s perception of women’s sexuality. When she flipped the Notorious B.I.G.’s objectifying tune “Just Playing (Dreams)” on its head with “Dreams,” her own equally-sexed-up take, Hard Core asserted that it’s not just on par with the hip-hop greats—it is one of the greats, and remains so to this day. —Victoria Wasylak\n\n284. Talk Talk: Laughing Stock (1991)\n\nIf you know anything about Talk Talk as a casual fan, it might be the confounding trajectory of their five albums—from the slow progression from the New Romantic-aligned synth-pop of their 1982 debut The Party’s Over to the complex, pastoral post-rock of final two albums Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock. With the latter, lead singer and songwriter Mark Hollis arguably crafted his masterpiece, recording his atmospheric, jazz-tinged hymns entirely in the dark and ruminating on sin, divine wrath and redemption. Even in its dramatic existentialism or perhaps less accessible structure, Laughing Stock prevails as one of the most important albums of all time because of the way it expresses that which is singularly human—both in the fear of the unknown and the beauty which sustains us in the meantime. —Elise Soutar\n\n283. Bob Marley and the Wailers: Burnin’ (1973)\n\nFor listeners who may only know Bob Marley’s musis through the ubiquitous Legend compilation, a true misconception would be that his music is colored by a sunny, positive, outlook on the world. The truth is, Marley, much like Curtis Mayfield or Fela Kuti, wrote as much about his anger towards the injustices being committed against his people in Jamaica and the oppressed around the globe as he did about the redemptive powers of love. On their sixth album Burnin’—the last true album as the Wailers since founding members Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer would leave the group shortly after its release—Marley and the group offer their fiercest calls to action up until that point. The most recognizable tunes here are the immortal anti-authority anthems “Get Up, Stand Up” and “I Shot The Sheriff.” But perhaps the album’s hidden thesis statement is it’s closing track, the seething “Burnin’ and Lootin’.” The song takes the positive outlook of his peer Jimmy Cliff’s “Many Rivers To Cross” and calls out how futile the kumbaya approach towards militarized police aggression truly is. “How many rivers do we have to cross before we can talk to the boss,” he asks with an inflection so palpably frustrated you can envision his tightly clenched fist in the vocal booth. Evil and oppressive forces only listen to strong action. Marley knows this and that’s why his call for not only “burnin’ and lootin’” but burning “all illusion” of a society that works for all remains as powerful as ever today. —Pat King\n\n282. Brian Eno: Another Green World (1975)\n\nBrian Eno’s third solo album is the bridge between his rock beginnings and his ambient trailblazing. On Another Green World, Eno builds warm textures through organ and piano, synthesizers and noise generators, early drum machines, Robert Fripp’s extraterrestrial guitar leads, and even a couple of drum performances by Phil Collins. It’s definitely more minimal than his first two LPs, but it’s far from Music from Airports; there’s still singing on five of its 14 songs, most notably on the beautiful (and oft-covered) pop song “St. Elmo’s Fire” and the swaying trot of “I’ll Come Running,” and instrumentals like “The Big Ship” and “Sombre Reptiles” explore rhythms, melodies, and emotions in structures not too far removed from more conventional pop music. It’s clearly a transitional work that combines the best of Eno’s early era with some of the techniques and ambitions that would come to define him; the songs with vocals are more abstract and experimental than what he accomplished on Here Come the Warm Jets and Taking Tiger Mountain, and you can hear the seeds of Eno’s later work throughout. All in all it’s a foundational classic from a weird era when the mainstream rock world and major labels still had a bit of room for groundbreaking experimentalists. —Garrett Martin\n\n281. Shin Joong Hyun & Yup Juns: 신중현과 엽전들 (1974)\n\nThe self-titled debut album from Shin Joong Hyun & Yup Juns is one of the greatest documents of psych- and blues-rock to ever exist, running circles around what many of their American contemporaries had done the decade prior. The three-piece, led by guitarist and vocalist Shin Jung-hyeon, drummer Kim Ho-Sik and bassist Lee Nam-yi, only lasted three years—destroyed over time by South Korea’s government, who arrested Shin Jung-hyeon for marijuana use in 1972 and committed him to a mental institution for treatment. After years of censorship, the Ministry of Culture and Public Information banned 54 artists from releasing albums and playing in public in 1976, including Shin—leading to the Yup Juns’ disbandment. The Yup Juns’ song “The Beauty” was banned under Park Chung-hee’s dictatorship, but tracks like “Think” and “Anticipation” are such perfect old-school rhythm and blues gems that merge elements of swamp and roots. The Yup Juns remain one of the greatest South Korean groups to ever exist, and they were instrumental in helping integrate a harder, grittier rock ‘n’ roll into the tastes of their generation in Seoul. —Matt Mitchell\n\n280. Townes Van Zandt: The Late Great Townes Van Zandt (1972)\n\nTownes Van Zandt isn’t exactly what you would call an “album artist.” A perpetual vagabond and often at the end of his rope, Van Zandt’s albums are often messy and haphazard. And yet, when you are able to cobble together an album featuring two of the greatest country-folk songs of all time, you make a great case for yourself on a list like this. “Pancho and Lefty” and “If I Needed You” are wonderful encapsulations of Townes as a songwriter and a storyteller, one for whom existential loneliness is often the lingua franca. The latter may be about a girl, the former about life on the road, but both are about leaving and what gets left behind—universal notions Van Zandt always spun into utter masterpieces. —Sean Fennell\n\n279. Robyn: Body Talk (2010)\n\nNo pop singer/songwriter in the last 20 years has made as much monumental dance music as Robyn has. The Swedish singer is as close to a one-in-a-million star as anyone else on this list, but her album, Body Talk is one of the best synth-pop projects ever. Though you might consider it to be a compilation album, it’s still a studio work that combines all of the tracks from her two-part Body Talk series—and both entries deserve some spotlight. Spearheaded by the monster single “Dancing On My Own,” it’s here, in 2010, where Robyn found her own immortality. Pulling influence from Prince’s Dirty Mind, the Knife’s Silent Shout and Kate Bush’s The Kick Inside, she made a dance record that is still, 13 years later, a club fixture. “Fembot,” “Dancehall Queen” and “Hang with Me” are each perfect on their own accord and help propel Body Talk into the echelons of electronic music forever. —Matt Mitchell\n\n278. Hiroshi Yoshimura: Music For Nine Post Cards (1982)\n\nOn his 1982 debut, Music For Nine Post Cards, Hiroshi Yoshimura burst into the world with a daylit, dreamy formula. The Japanese producer self-recorded the album using a Fender Rhodes, sonically aiming to evoke seasonal changes in a small town. But until a 2017 reissue via the label Empire of Signs, Yoshimura remained unjustly overlooked on an international scale. The posthumous re-release transformed him into a giant on streaming platforms, acting as a mesmerizing gateway for listeners just starting to dabble with wordless music. Music For Nine Post Cards is not just the quintessential Japanese ambient album, it’s the most earnest and pure New Age record of all time. —Ted Davis\n\n277. Pulp: Different Class (1995)\n\nIf 1994’s His N’ Hers was Pulp’s first foray into the mainstream consciousness, then Different Class was the album that made sure that Jarvis Cocker and his band would remain pop culture figures for years to come. The band’s most successful single, “Common People,” was an anthem that continued the band’s dedication towards exploring ‘90s Britain from a working-class perspective, with its narrative of class divide and poverty tourism still ringing true to this day. Different Class exemplified all the best aspects of Cockers’ lens into the homes of everyday people as he explored horniness, fractured relationships and dreams of stardom. Pulp were proudly flying the flag for those who saw themselves as outsiders. —Matty Pywell\n\n276. Vampire Weekend: Modern Vampires of the City (2013)\n\nVampire Weekend emerged in the late 2000s as one of indie rock’s coolest and most distinctive bands. With two critically acclaimed records under their belt by the time 2013 hit, the hype for the intellectual millennial outfit’s third record was so immense that someone had infamously fabricated a cover for it and titled it Lemon Sounds. Luckily, 2013’s Modern Vampires of the City, their actual third album, would effectively defy the preppy-twee mold that people began boxing Vampire Weekend into. Where their charming 2008 self-titled debut and their giddy 2010 follow-up Contra were home runs, Modern Vampires of the City felt like a grand slam, somehow both playful and precise in its experimentation with pitch-shifting (“Diane Young,” “Ya Hey”), hyper-speed vocals (“Worship You”) and dense wordplay (“Step”). Producer Ariel Rechtstaid and former band member Rostam Batmanglij were especially integral to shaping the album’s haunted quality, giving a chilly yet vibrant life to frontman Ezra Koenig’s poetic musings about faith and mortality. —Sam Rosenberg\n\n275. Kraftwerk: The Man-Machine (1978)\n\nGerman quartet Kraftwerk have about five albums that could’ve fit into this slot, but we’ve opted to move forward with The Man-Machine—the band’s 1978 masterpiece that is, at its core, the godfather of synth-pop as we know it. It’s here where Kraftwerk took their mechanical style of old and re-tuned it into a club-worthy aesthetic. The album is a beautiful example of early-era electro-pop architecture, and it laid the groundwork for what bands like Depeche Mode, OMD and Pet Shop Boys would aim to do in the decade that followed. Centerpiece “The Model” feels as brand-new now as it did 45 years ago, while songs like “Neon Lights,” “Metropolis” and “The Robots” all signal early installments of the cybernetic dance-pop that would flood the charts at the turn of 1981. Like always, Kraftwerk were ahead of the curve. Although, you could argue that—on The Man-Machine—they invented the curve altogether. —Matt Mitchell\n\n274. Songs: Ohia: The Magnolia Electric Co. (2003)\n\nAfter releasing a series of excellent, oft-bleak lo-fi indie-rock albums in the late ‘90s and early 2000s, Jason Molina expanded his ambitions with 2003’s The Magnolia Electric Co.—a rocking Americana epic that paired intimate musings with an expansive soundscape. Over two decades later, the LP remains Molina’s most incisive, offering a devastatingly unfiltered look into a beautiful tortured soul. “Everything you hated me for / Honey there was so much more / I just didn’t get busted,” he opined on the devastating “Just Be Simple” 10 years before his demons would eventually catch up to him. But on Magnolia Electric Co., Molina was more than just a tragic figure; he was a brave troubadour unafraid to shy away from all the beauty and tragedy of life. On the bittersweet closer “Hold On Magnolia,” he stared down the abyss and held on to the “last light” he saw. In doing so, he created torch songs for the bruised and battered among us. —Tom Williams\n\n273. Neil Young: After the Gold Rush (1970)\n\nAlong with Bob Dylan’s Blood on the Tracks, After the Gold Rush is one of the greatest break-up records ever made regardless of intention. Even though it has nothing to do with the album, which was inspired by a Dean Stockwell-Herb Berman screenplay, I liked to imagine that it was written to capture the feeling too often ignored by movies and music. Songs like “Only Love Can Break Your Heart” and “When You Dance I Can Really Love” charted, while songs like “Tell Me Why,” “I Believe in You” and “Don’t Let It Bring You Down” became fixtures in Neil Young’s sets for years after After the Gold Rush’s release. The 11 songs embrace the truth of loss that comes after the magic, after the bum-rush of serotonin and possibilities, after you realize the holes inside haven’t been plugged, that the overflow of emotion you poured in ran right out. —Jeff Gonick\n\n272. Blondie: Parallel Lines (1978)\n\nAs a fellow blond, Debbie Harry has always been an idol of mine, and her badass personality just adds to the adoration. After bursting onto the New York music scene with their punk-centric, self-titled debut—followed up by the rowdy Plastic Letters—fans got a taste of what silkier new wave hooks would come on their third album, Parallel Lines. “Heart Of Glass” is an enduring Blondie classic for its funky guitar grooves and Harry’s biting lyricism of a toxic romance—the theme song for many a scorned lover. Though “Heart Of Glass” and the taunting roar of “One Way Or Another” are the most recognizable tracks, the rest of Parallel Lines boasts Blondie’s unmistakable flavor of intoxicating post-punk. The doo-wop-inspired “Pretty Baby” is infectiously catchy, and the CBGB icons brought groovy psychedelia to the front of the line with “Fade Away And Radiate” (with a guest appearance from Robert Fripp of King Crimson on a wailing guitar solo). Blondie’s Parallel Lines solidified the band as pioneers of a beloved musical movement.. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n271. Wire: Chairs Missing (1978)\n\nThe art school punk provocateurs in Wire put out three albums during their initial phase, and all three are classics that sound very different from each other. Chairs Missing, their second LP, is the best of the bunch, and one of the most important albums ever recorded. It’s hard to imagine “post-punk” even existing as a genre tag without this record; although a couple of songs recall the minimal, straight-forward punk of 1977’s Pink Flag, the rest of the album adds synthesizers, guitar effects, a disco beat on “Another the Letter,” and various other flourishes and experiments that clearly marked this as something new and different at the time. It foreshadowed so much of the punk-derived music that followed that you can draw a straight line from Chairs Missing to a handful of different indie-rock subgenres. —Garrett Martin\n\n270. Mississippi John Hurt: Today! (1966)\n\nWhile pickers like Muddy Waters, Robert Johnson and John Lee Hooker have endured as the most recognizable faces in the history of blues music, none of them made an album quite as soul-stirring as Mississippi John Hurt’s 1966 classic, Today! Recorded in 1964, Hurt compiled 12 songs—five of them traditional, the rest original compositions, including “I’m Satisfied” and “Coffee Blues”—completely rewrote his own success. Today! came after Vanguard Records “rediscovered” him, and his voice hadn’t missed a beat. There’s a soft-spoken warmth rippling from end to end, as Hurt doesn’t ever quite growl with the same gravelly haze employed by his contemporaries. There was no need, though, as the gentleness of Today! works beautifully with the mellow, heavy-hearted tunes of Hurt’s greatest effort. As far as folk revival albums are concerned, the one made by a bluesman might be the very best of them all. —Matt Mitchell\n\n269. Fiona Apple: When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He’ll Win the Whole Thing ‘Fore He Enters the Ring There’s No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won’t Matter, Cuz You’ll Know That You’re Right (1999)\n\nAfter SPIN wrote a bad cover story about Fiona Apple, she wrote a poem that wound up being the entire title of her second studio album, When the Pawn… The Washington Post declared it Apple’s version of Chumbawamba’s “Tubthumping,” but the art-rock starlet’s sophomore LP gave out far greater tongue-lashings than “I get knocked down, but I get up again.” Apple didn’t just get up, she grew taller than those who criticized her after Tidal came out three years earlier. Jon Brion’s production is the game-changer here, and the music was not just melodically more complex—her voice had been worn down into a soulful vessel for misery, the arrangements limping around her like they came from the rib of a wounded orchestra. This was the moment Fiona Apple became bigger than Alanis, bigger than Tori, bigger than Jewell, bigger than Garbage and bigger than Liz Phair. —Matt Mitchell\n\n268. Tom Petty: Wildflowers (1994)\n\nUnconfined, Tom Petty brought a whole lot of heart into the songs of Wildflowers. The album, Petty’s second solo record following two decades of recording with the Heartbreakers (though many of them are featured on it), stands as a glimmering standout of folk-rock brilliance in his discography—one he referred to as his pet project, a career highlight. The title track’s declaration, “you belong somewhere you feel free,” is a motto for the record’s creation, crafted with longtime bandmates and producer Rick Rubin during a period of pure musical clarity. —Annie Nickoloff\n\n267. Dolly Parton: Coat of Many Colors (1971)\n\nThe narrative that Dolly Parton lays out on “Coat of Many Colors,” the title track of her eighth solo album, is among the most endearing she has ever penned. “My coat of many colors that my mama made for me / Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly,” Parton sings in the refrain, her distinct voice soaring with glee and gratitude. Like Dolly’s mother, the country lodestar possesses a gift for crafting something memorable with unassuming materials. Nowhere in her immense catalog is that more evident than on Coat of Many Colors, as Parton fashions her simple yet affecting vocals and acoustic guitar for a grander purpose: to tell stories that stay with us for decades. —Grant Sharples\n\n266. Mahmoud Ahmed: Éthiopiques, Vol. 7: Ere Mèla Mèla (1975)\n\nThe Éthiopiques series has gifted the world some of the greatest Ethiopian music to ever exist, including work from Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou, Mulatu Astatke and Tlahoun Gessesse. But it’s the series’ seventh volume that towers over the rest. Made in 1975 by singer Mahmoud Ahmed, the album blends touches of psych-soul with jazz and lounge singing to make one of the greatest East African fusion projects of all time. The organ-heavy R&B band behind Ahmed get their kicks on a truly global range of influences, evoking everything from James Brown-rambunctiousness to Spanish flamenco. It’s an epic album, galvanized by the silk-woven “Tezeta” and the booming groove of “Belomi Benna.” —Matt Mitchell\n\n265. Thin Lizzy: Jailbreak (1976)\n\nBy the time Thin Lizzy put out their sixth album in 1976, the Irish rockers had found their groove completely. Jailbreak wasn’t just a commercial breakthrough in the United States for Phil Lynott and his band; it was a colossal achievement of hard-nosed rock ‘n’ roll. The songs are surprisingly baroque, given just how disgusting those guitars from Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson sound, but Lynott’s whiskey-soaked refrains inspired by the blues and glam-rock, Thin Lizzy soared beyond expectations, turning in three of the greatest rock tracks of the era: “The Boys Are Back in Town,” “Jailbreak” and “Cowboy Song.” While “The Boys Are Back in Town” has become TouchTunes royalty, “Cowboy Song” remains one of the most epic songs of the 1970s (that final guitar solo will split your head clean down the middle if you’re not careful). Jailbreak is strange, cosmic and pilled with grit. —Matt Mitchell\n\n264. Stars of the Lid: The Tired Sounds of Stars of the Lid (2001)\n\nOn their sixth album as Stars of the Lid, The Tired Sounds of, Brian McBride and Adam Wiltzie don’t just come across groggy: They seem to dwell in some sleep-induced otherworld, doused in heavenly light. While it might sound like the Texas duo were working around traditional synthesizer pads in the studio, the 19-track record was actually built on groundbreaking tones generated from processed string and woodwind instruments, peppered with occasional samples pulled from arthouse films. Extended drone pieces can sometimes have a tendency to become pleasant, yet ignorable background noise. But The Tired Sounds of proves that this isn’t always the case, with a capacity to be as entrancing as it is cloudy. —Ted Davis\n\n263. Alvvays: Blue Rev (2022)\n\nAlvvays are masters of quality over quantity—they know what they have to say, and they waste no time getting to the point. The most recent release on this list, Blue Rev is a joyride of masterfully written jangle-pop tunes that were recorded in one sitting, with producer Shawn Everett filling in the gaps and fleshing out the texture of the record’s all-killer-no-filler 14 tracks. The group became Grammy underdogs with the standout single “Belinda Says,” which contains one of the best key changes of the last decade. The musical chemistry between every member of Alvvays soars through each track’s story, many of which are inspired by frontwoman Molly Rankin’s favorite books, lyrics and Go-Go’s member. Blue Rev is an album about identity and sense of self. Alvvays, who’ve never dropped an EP or a standalone single, act without flaw. —Leah Weinstein\n\n262. Silver Jews: American Water (1998)\n\nIn the almost five years since his passing, David Berman has come to be known as something of a tragic figure—a reputation born out of both his suicide and his final album, Purple Mountains, which he released four weeks prior to his death. But Berman was far more multifaceted and harder to box in, something captured on his magnum opus with Silver Jews: American Water. Here, he found connection in isolation (“Honk If You’re Lonely”) and poetic insight into life’s banalities, like the color of the road (“Random Rules”). On closer “The Wild Kindness,” he found hope. “I’m gonna shine out in the wild kindness,” he declared triumphantly, a fitting mission statement from a painfully empathetic, ingenious songwriter whose music offered a lifeline to other wandering souls. —Tom Williams\n\n261. The Meters: Rejuvenation (1974)\n\nFew American bands have deserved more flowers than the Meters, who came out of New Orleans and completely transformed funk music forever. They were a backing group for folks like Lee Dorsey and Dr. John over the years, and their work is, by far, a mark of origination. When Mick Jagger saw them play at the release party for Wings’ Venus and Mars, he asked them to open for the Rolling Stones from 1975-76. Few funk bands have ever done it like the Meters, and their 1974 album Rejuvenation is a marquee entry into the genre’s history. Part-funk and part-swamp rock, Rejuvenation lives up to its title, as songs like “Just Kissed My Baby” and “Hey Pocky A-Way” celebrate the co-lead vocalist triumphs of bandleaders Ziggy Modeliste and Art Neville while ushering the choral flourishes of female backing vocalists into the fray. The Meters have continuously been one of the most influential bands ever, and that much is true for Rejuvenation—as the Red Hot Chili Peppers covered “Africa,” Public Enemy sampled “Just Kissed My Baby” on their album Yo! Bum Rush the Show and the Grateful Dead often performed “Hey Pocky A-Way” in the late-1980s. Incorporating country, R&B, gospel and Mardi Gras rhythm into their sound, Rejuvenation is the Meters at a zenith. —Matt Mitchell\n\n260. PJ Harvey: Stories from the City, Stories from the Sea (2000)\n\nStories does defiance in a way she hadn’t yet explored, and feels confident in a way that floats above the rest of the world, rather than fighting back. What else in her discography captures the head-on swagger of something like “Big Exit” or “This is Love”? What else sounds like the gentle glide of Thom Yorke’s voice underpinning Polly’s in “Beautiful Feeling,” or the heavy, warm piano march that carries “Horses In My Dreams”? Even the gentle collapse and defeat of “We Float” feels like light flooding your senses in the best possible way. Though it’s unlikely that Polly will ever make anything this purposefully polished again, it’s a little blip of calm in the eye of the larger storm, a moment of shimmering assurance among a back catalog that largely aims to make the listener uncomfortable. Few albums by anyone have captured that precise feeling, making Stories something truly special. —Elise Soutar\n\n259. The Byrds: Sweetheart of the Rodeo (1968)\n\nConsidered the definitive moment when hippie rock met country, Sweetheart of the Rodeo marked Chris Hillman’s buddy Gram Parsons joining the band that defined folk-rock with “Turn! Turn! Turn!” and Dylan’s “Mr. Tambourine Man.” Suddenly aligned with a hardcore right-wing genre, stereotypes were shattered—not with Clarence White’s electric guitar, but pools of Jay Dee Maness and Lloyd Green’s plangent steel. Songs from bluegrass stalwarts The Louvin Brothers (“The Christian Life”), hard folkie Woody Guthrie (“Pretty Boy Floyd”) and emerging superstar Merle Haggard (“Life in Prison”) sat comfortably beside Dylan (“You Ain’t Goin’ Nowhere”) and Tom Hardin (“You’ve Got A Reputation”) as simpatico companions, making the synthesis seamless. Parsons’ enduring “Hickory Wind,” a wistful song of time spent growing up, embodies what’s to come, stands out along with his “100 Years From Now.” Considered a failure when it was released, the visionary adaptation of country & western with California rock and pop paved the way for the Eagles, Linda Ronstadt, Poco and Emmylou Harris. —Holly Gleason\n\n258. Janet Jackson: Control (1987)\n\nWhat’s unique about Control is that it’s only a drop in the bucket of how incredible of a pop star Janet Jackson was and still is. It kicked off a run of five classic albums in a row, released between 1986 and 2001. Few musicians have ever had such a consequential 15-year run, and it can all be traced back to the very first words uttered on “Control”: “This is a story about control. My control—control of what I say, control of what I do. And this time, I’m gonna do it my way.” Janet makes her mission known from the jump; Control was not going to be a conventional pop record about chasing lovers and dancing. And she stayed true to her word, as Control is an autobiographical powerhouse triumphant in ways that most albums of its era aren’t. Janet’s recent marriage to James DeBarge had been annulled, she quit doing business with her family (especially her father, Joseph) and took on John McClain as her manager. To say it’s a brilliant mark of empowerment would be an understatement; to try and get to the root of just how game-changing Control was for Black women (especially Black women in music) would take more than just one greatest albums list blurb. —Matt Mitchell\n\n257. OutKast: Aquemini (1998)\n\n“The South got something to say,” André 3000 famously declared at the 1995 Source Awards. As one-half of the Atlanta hip-hop duo Outkast, André was accepting the Best New Rap Group award, a victory met with boos from the audience more invested in the East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry. It’s a historic moment, a prophecy that foreshadowed Atlanta’s prominent configuration in rap. Although 1996’s ATLiens would follow that now-famous speech, 1998’s Aquemini would be the hard, undeniable proof that the South did, in fact, have something to say. On their third album, 3 Stacks and Big Boi complement each other like yin and yang, making effortless work of their syllable-laden bars like nimble Olympic gymnasts. Grounded by production trio Organized Noize’s globe-shattering beats, the Dungeon Family rose from the late Rico Wade’s basement to the stratosphere. “Even though we got two albums, this one feel like the beginning,” Big Boi presciently raps on “Y’All Scared.” He was dead-on. —Grant Sharples\n\n256. Marty Robbins: Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs (1959)\n\nNot only did Marty Robbins’ fifth LP make him a star, Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs became one of the most influential albums of post-World War II American music by defining a romantic vision of the Old West that has resonated ever since. Anchored by the Grammy-winning crossover hit “El Paso,” the album drew on the influence of Hollywood cowboys like Gene Autry on songs that are lean, taut and unfailingly catchy. Even decades later, tracks from the album continue to appear in pop culture as a kind of musical shorthand for the themes they address: “Big Iron” appeared in the 2010 video game Fallout: New Vegas, while “El Paso” played early in the final episode of Breaking Bad. Robbins was essentially the last of the real cowboy singers, and Gunfighter Ballads & Trail Songs was his crowning achievement. —Eric R. Danton\n\n255. Cyndi Lauper: She’s So Unusual (1983)\n\nThere’s no denying that everything about Cyndi Lauper’s debut, She’s So Unusual, was peak ‘80s—from bubbly pop melodies to the crazy neon outfit she wore on the cover. Through a barrage of covers, the influential queer icon delivered two of her biggest hits: “Girls Just Want To Have Fun” and “Time After Time.” The latter pop ballad is Lauper’s greatest musical triumph, with its simple synth composition and fitting clock-like percussion. Potentially one of the most universally well-known choruses of all time, it’s impossible to restrain from screaming out, “If you’re lost you can look and you will find me / Time after time / If you fall, I will catch you, I’ll be waiting / Time after time.” The soft beauty of “Time After Time” is perfectly paralleled with the feminist anthem “Girls Just Want To Have Fun,” which celebrates the notion that women don’t need men to have fun; they just need each other. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n254. Nico: The Marble Index (1968)\n\nChrista Päffgen always wanted to be an artist, badgering the male musicians in her life for information about any blues, jazz and classical music she could get her hands on long before her fateful meeting with Andy Warhol and the Velvet Underground. Yet, it took two other fateful meetings—one with Jim Morrison, who encouraged her to write lyrics, and the other with her beloved harmonium—for Nico to finally transform herself into the artist she was meant to be. Following her personal disappointment with her debut Chelsea Girl, Nico dyed her famous blond hair red and took to the studio with the Velvets’ John Cale to abandon pop and rock conventions entirely, working more in the tradition of the European avant-garde to craft the funereal discordance of The Marble Index. Amorphous, experimental and yet to be successfully replicated, the record might have registered as a cult oddity upon release, but now stands as a foundational text for all alternative music that similarly embraced the darkness in the decades that followed. —Elise Soutar\n\n253. George Jones: I Am What I Am (1980)\n\nI Am What I Am found the Possum in a dark place. By 1980, George Jones hadn’t charted in years, was buckling under the weight of addiction and debt, and was constantly fighting with himself in the form of arguing personas he called “the Duck” and “the Old Man.” In the midst of this, he recorded a song that at the time he called a “morbid son of a bitch” and later called the three minutes that saved his four-decade career: “He Stopped Loving Her Today.” Many troubled artists have fallen on country music’s altar, but few could expose the morbid core of it as perfectly as George Jones—a feat that’s clear not only in the tremendous success of I Am What I Am’s breakout single, but also in the literal bloodletting on “If Drinking Don’t Kill Me (Her Memory Will)” and the all-too-real “I’ve Aged Twenty Years in Five.” —Annie Parnell\n\n252. Lorde: Melodrama (2017)\n\nFollowing the acclaim of 2013’s Pure Heroine, a 19-year-old Lorde had something to prove. She holed up for 18 months with Jack Antonoff in his Brooklyn apartment, creating what is still lauded as a magnum opus for the both of them. Melodrama is a triumph in pop that simply cannot be replicated, finding its strength in its vast world of emotional resonance. The lyrical gravitas of instrumentally minimal tracks like “Liability” and “Writer In The Dark” only emphasize the bombast brought on by their respective predecessors in “Hard Feelings / Loveless” and “Supercut.” Lorde’s already prodigious storytelling chops are enhanced from the heightened emotional intensity of young adulthood. Whether through larger-than-life synths or vocals that feel like Lorde is pouring her heart out right in front of you, Melodrama refuses to release its grip until you vividly remember what it’s like to be 19 and on fire. —Leah Weinstein\n\n251. Popol Vuh: Hosianna Mantra (1972)\n\nThe third album from the German band Popol Vuh, Hosianna Mantra is a decadent blend of space rock, chamber pop, krautrock, New Age and ambient. At 37 minutes in length, bandleader Florian Fricke stepped away from the electronica that had defined previous albums In den Gärten Pharaos and Affenstunde and embraced a cutting-edge hodgepodge of acoustic instruments like the oboe and tambura. Between Conny Veit’s guitar playing and Djong Yun’s vocals, Hosianna Mantra sounds like it comes from a different constellation entirely. Songs like the title track, “Maria (Ave Maria)” and “Ah!” are ethereal and mind-bending, taking on a somber guise that converges head-on with lush, patient arrangements that are so gentle they could fracture at any moment. Hosianna Mantra is one of the greatest German music albums ever made, and Popol Vuh turned in a bold, timeless, holistic masterpiece in 1972. —Matt Mitchell\n\n250. Burial: Untrue (2007)\n\nWilliam Bevan (aka Burial) quietly changed the course of contemporary electronic music before anyone even knew his name. The shadowy artist anonymously came up adjacent to the mid 2000s UK dubstep boom, putting out spindly, crackling dance tracks on Kode9’s Hyperdub label. His 2007 sophomore LP, Untrue, is beautiful, albeit wholeheartedly glum. Crafted using the unconventional software Soundforge, lopsided jungle and 2-step grooves are outlined by gritty effects and chopped-up pop vocal samples. It paints an overcast portrayal of meandering city life and clubbing, resulting in the most poignant party record ever. —Ted Davis\n\n249. Joni Mitchell: Hejira (1976)\n\n​​In 1976, after spending years in the limelight, singing and playing hippie-friendly anthems like “Big Yellow Taxi” and “The Circle Game” for people who came of age in the ‘60s, Joni Mitchell needed time off to reflect and reassess. Her solution was to drive across America by herself, and the time away gave birth to the songs on Hejira, a word that loosely translates as “traveler” in Arabic. Songs like “Amelia,” “Coyote” and especially “Song for Sharon” expressed a new depth and maturity in her lyrics that perfectly fused with the challenging new music she was composing. Supported by a stellar who’s who of modern jazz musicians including Jaco Pastorious, Tom Scott and Larry Carlton, Mitchell’s guitar-playing that had previously comprised of little more than folk strumming attained a mastery of expressing, phrasing and tone that has lost none of its power or innovation with the passage of time. Rhythmically complex, daring and beautiful, Hejira’s travelogues of despair and illumination have inspired many to consider it the finest album in her discography. —Doug Heselgrave\n\n248. Steely Dan: Aja (1977)\n\nAja is one of the most impressive feats of musical excellence this world has seen—a spectacular display of jazz-rock, which perfectly utilized the services of over 40 acclaimed musicians and was gorgeously produced by Gary Katz. That Aja never hits a wrong note across its 40 minute run time alone would be enough to ensure its classic status, but Walter Becker and Donald Fagen did us one better: Rather than surrender to the ambience of their enviable full band, the duo penned moving vignettes of love, aspiration and dejection. On Aja’s apex, “Deacon Blues,” Fagen sings: “They got a name for the winners in the world / I want a name when I lose.” Hitting rock bottom never sounded so good. —Tom Williams\n\n247. The Shangri-Las: Leader of the Pack (1965)\n\nEven with the plaudits heaved onto The Shangri-Las in the wake of their lead singer Mary Weiss’ passing in early 2024, music history as we know it will probably always downplay the four Queens girls’ legacy—though it’d be difficult to tell the full story of popular music without them. Aside from their prescient visual and thematic sensibility, the impact of which can be clearly felt on the first wave of punk, Side A of their first full-length album, Leader of the Pack, contains of some of the strangest songs to ever be heard in regular rotation on pop radio, dishing out tales of teen melodrama with enough grit and nuance that listeners were compelled to take the young female voices seriously. Everyone from the Ramones to Amy Winehouse to Lana Del Rey to Garbage owes Mary, Betty, Marge and Mary Ann beyond measure for their bombast and tenderness alike. —Elise Soutar\n\n246. LCD Soundsystem: Sound of Silver (2007)\n\nReleased in the era of Myspace and indie-sleaze, LCD Soundsystem achieves greatness in the nine anthems that make up Sound of Silver. But the sophomore album never confines itself to one theme; there’s something enduring about these droney indie-dance-punk grooves, these forward-looking sounds paired with James Murphy’s best lyrics, which are forever preoccupied with aging and the past—and memories, kept alive. “And it keeps coming,” Murphy repeats and repeats on “Someone Great,” before reminding us all of one inevitability: “till the day it stops.” —Annie Nickoloff\n\n245. Eric B. & Rakim: Paid in Full (1987)\n\nThe legend goes that DJ / turntablist Eric B. put out a call to find “New York’s top MC” to complement his wizardly work on the decks. Boy, did he get what he asked for. Rakim was the antithesis to the shouty spirit of most New York rappers. His flow was smooth and laid back as if he recorded the entire album while seated in a cozy throne. It would be off putting if Rakim didn’t have the kind of cutting lyricism that commanded respect and sliced down his enemies—perceived or legit—with deceptive ease. Let’s not forget what Eric B. brought to this party. His choices of samples and breakbeats were judicious and thoughtful, minimalist and clean in contrast to the hard-edged assault of what producers like Rick Rubin and the Bomb Squad were up to at the time. The duo didn’t break new ground so much as suggest an alternate path through the hip-hop landscape. One that would allow them to collect their dead presidents by a show of subtle strength instead of brute force. —Robert Ham\n\n244. Four Tet: There Is Love in You (2010)\n\nThere’s something profound about music that assumes form through live feedback, where natural movement can embed itself in the fabric of a piece. This was the foundation of Four Tet’s There Is Love in You, which grew out of experiments in London’s seminal nightclub Plastic People. The result is a constantly evolving sea of grooves, packed to the brim with shimmering, fragmented vocal samples that spin around the stereo field. The album shines in its simplicity, finding strength in subtlety and reaching hypnotic highs through pristine layering. It both rewards close listening and plays wonderfully as background music to accompany life’s hustle and bustle, and, as such, is an essential 2010s electronic record. —David Feigelson\n\n243. Alice Coltrane: Turiya Sings (1982)\n\nAlice Coltrane’s cosmic, spiritual harping is one of most transportive sounds in all of jazz. 1981’s Turiya Sings is an inadvertent New Age milestone, recorded in a whirlwind one-day session. The album is an impassioned tribute to Hinduism, and was originally only available as a cassette sold at Coltrane’s Vedantic Center ashram in the Los Angeles mountains. It’s also an early landmark in soundscaping, Coltrane’s Sanskrit singing gracefully placed atop a bed of heavenly synthesizers and strings. Coltrane’s output was typically sticky and surrealistic, as if melded from delicate tendrils of incense smoke. But Turiya Sings is comparably upward-gazing and spine-tingling, like the brittle blue tint of the Malibu sky. —Ted Davis\n\n242. The Promise Ring: Nothing Feels Good (1997)\n\nFormed in Milwaukee in 1995, the Promise Ring are heralded as one of the most crucial emo bands to ever do it—that is, until they shifted to making poppier stuff in 1999. But right in the middle of those bookends, the four-piece released Nothing Feels Good, an LP carved into emo’s Mount Rushmore with a gilded chisel. The songs are brash, catchy and thunderous—the kind of heavy record you’d expect a bunch of pop lovers to make, and it’s a bright, strange collection of rock music that sounds as indebted to the punk explosion from 20 years prior as it does the wave of radio-friendly alt-rock that would swallow the counterculture around the turn of the new millennium. Songs like “Is This Thing On?,” “Why Did Ever We Meet” and “Raspberry Rush” are guitar tracks that endure as syrupy as they do colossaly noisy. Without Nothing Feels Good, we don’t get Jimmy Eat World and the Get Up Kids. —Matt Mitchell\n\n241. Sex Pistols: Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols (1977)\n\nIt would’ve been more shocking if the Pistols stuck around long enough to make a second LP. Every marketing gimmick has a shelf-life and the Pistols’ was particularly short. Bollocks is a musical Ouroboros, as its reputation has cycled from “dangerous salvation of rock ‘n’ roll” to “embarrassing cartoon” multiple times over since 1977. If you can ignore big sweeping statements and the misplaced notions of grandeur forced upon it you might be able to appreciate its relatively frills-free take on caustic rock ‘n’ roll recidivism. And hey, at least two people responsible were in on the joke, which is probably two more than The Police. —Garrett Martin\n\n240. Lady Gaga: The Fame Monster (2009)\n\nThe monstrous follow-up to Lady Gaga’s decade-defining EDM revival 2008’s The Fame was initially planned to be a deluxe-edition of the pop superstar’s debut—but with the star-power and sheer weight of the eight impeccable tracks, Gaga opted for it to stand on its own. The Fame Monster dropped just over a year after her smash-hit introduction with a feature from Beyoncé and a slew of new chart-toppers in “Bad Romance” and “Alejandro”—admittedly a go-to karaoke song of mine—and an early showcase of her vocal talent in “Speechless.” The Fame Monster explored the darker side of fame that Gaga gushed about a year earlier, and the album delivered one of the most iconic collaborations of the 2000s with “Telephone.” Along with her captivating performances and outlandish yet iconic fashion choices, Lady Gaga became a creative visionary in a pop scene dominated by commercialization. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n239. The Mountain Goats: The Sunset Tree (2005)\n\nMaybe the prettiest thing about The Sunset Tree is how it is now both an album and a beacon of inspiration. The record unfortunately succumbed to the Tumblr era sometime in the late-aughts, falling into the clutches of an entire generation pasting those quintessential lyrics from “This Year” over night sky stock photos. But eons beyond that, The Sunset Tree holds up better than so many other albums have—because from top to bottom, it’s a ritualistic yet damning portrait of hope, love and domestic violence. Titled after a scene in Samuel Butler’s The Way of All Flesh, where a character beats his son for having a speech impediment, The Sunset Tree continues to inspire universes of new fans, caught up in abusive environments, just looking for a reason to hold on a while longer. “Love, Love, Love” and “Hast Thou Considered the Tetrapod” take John Darnielle’s childhood abuse in different directions, pivoting between ruminations on powerlessness, escape and revenge. But it’s the closing track, “Pale Green Things,” that’s the album’s triumph—where Darnielle learns of his abusive step-father’s passing and reminisces on when they spent a good day together at the race track, ending the record in a place where we relearn how love and family are still complicated, even in death. The Sunset Tree is a reflection on whether we can forgive those who hurt us in the name of love, and it still reminds us that we are not responsible for the violence inflicted on us by the people we live with. May we all find our own sunset trees to run to. —Matt Mitchell\n\n238. Elton John: Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nGoodbye Yellow Brick Road is perhaps the best example of the magic that was the Elton John-Bernie Taupin songwriting partnership. It produced some of John’s best-known tracks, including the rollicking “Saturday Night’s Alright For Fighting,” the Marilyn Monroe tribute “Candle in the Wind,” the titular ballad and the karaoke staple “Bennie and the Jets.” John seamlessly shifts from brash to mournful over the course of its 17 tracks, and the result is not unlike when Dorothy steps into the Technicolor land of Oz for the first time. —Bonnie Stiernberg\n\n237. Danny Brown: Atrocity Exhibition (2016)\n\nComing off of the cultish excitement of records like XXX and Old, Detroit rapper Danny Brown maintained his impressive streak with his masterful 2016 album, Atrocity Exhibition. Even though he was now signed to the electronic label Warp Records and capable of securing big-name features like Kendrick Lamar, Danny hadn’t lost the eccentric idiosyncrasies that made his music so appealing in the first place. His nasal delivery and queasy, off-kilter instrumentals are a match made in hip-hop heaven. Featuring cuts like the rap Avengers anthem “Really Doe,” the brassy four-on-the-floor banger “Ain’t It Funny” and the sample-heavy fever dream “Lost,” Atrocity Exhibition firmly cemented Danny as one of the greatest rappers doing it. —Grant Sharples\n\n236. Joy Division: Unknown Pleasures (1979)\n\nOne of the most recognizable album covers post-Dark Side of the Moon, Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures continues to find audiences—in some way or another—in 2023. The work of Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris was just a stepping stone for what direction post-punk and new wave could take. The results are sometimes menacing, as Curtis’ deadpan delivery on songs like “Disorder” and “Shadowplay” are haunting and stirring. Other cuts, like “She’s Lost Control” and “Wilderness” exude gothic tones and hues, as Joy Division primed themselves to become one of England’s greatest bands. It’s hard to know what might have come of the band had Curtis lived beyond 1980, but I’d like to think that Joy Division was on a crash-course for the heights and reverence that The Smiths would get four years later. Of course, New Order would arise from the ashes of Unknown Pleasures and Closer, but the groundwork laid by Curtis and his bandmates in 1979 can still be felt 44 years later. It’s a perfect album that continues to influence groups like Fontaines D.C., shame and Yard Act. —Matt Mitchell\n\n235. Aretha Franklin: Amazing Grace (1972)\n\nRecorded at the New Temple Baptist Church in Los Angeles in early 1972, Aretha Franklin joined Reverend James Cleveland and the Southern California Community Choir for an 85-minute performance of some of the most beautiful gospel music you’ve ever heard. Not only is Amazing Grace the best-selling live gospel album of all time, it’s one of the single greatest performances ever captured on tape. But it’s not simply a gospel record; Aretha plays around with traditional styles and bends them to her liking. It’s a document of liberating abandon, a bird’s-eye-view into the call-and-response transcendence of a church party performing in unison. The work is powerful, and Aretha’s voice is captured in its greatest form here—as her renditions of “How I Got Over,” “You’ll Never Walk Alone” and the 10-minute “Amazing Grace” are stunning, operatic and downright soul-stirring. —Matt Mitchell\n\n234. D’Angelo and the Vanguard: Black Messiah (2014)\n\n14 years dissolved. One key-stroke, and the mythic follow-up to D’Angelo’s Voodoo could be yours. Luxurious, raw, crashed-up, silky, a funky collage of sounds and grooves, Black Messiah takes listeners even deeper into the dozen songs with repeated listening. More heartening than the hodgepodge of elements and seeming precision of their interweaving is the social consciousness rising. Yes, D’Angelo, that glorious objet d’amour, has not eschewed his romantic bent, but with the exhortative-sample, wah-wah guitar-slither collapsing into writhing moans on “1000 Deaths,” the drum-rolling phased vocal delight “Til It’s Done (Tutu)” and the elegantly moody “The Charade” with its wailing chorus “all we wanted was a chance to talk / ‘Stead we only got outlined in chalk…,” his desire to expand higher societal awareness dominates. Also declaring in the liners the all-analog recording of real hands on real instruments, Black Messiah churns the “old school” in ways that bristle with vitality, yet are as fresh and urgent as anything on radio. 14 years is a long time. Devotees were aware of the personal issues which have plagued the artist and delayed the album; each passing year suggested a lessening of what might be hoped for. To his credit, D’Angelo didn’t attempt to “supersede” what he’d built, but rather develop the nitty gritty gospel/soul/jazz/hip-hop bindings of his nu-funk excavations. —Holly Gleason\n\n233. Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young: Déjà Vu (1970)\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash had something really great going on across their eponymous debut album in 1969—but when the trio brought Canadian folk hero and former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young into the fold in 1969, they made their best work. Déjà Vu is one of the greatest folk-rock records ever made. Lead single “Woodstock,” written by Joni Mitchell, reflected the titular music festival (where CSNY played one of their earliest four-piece gigs together), while “Teach Your Children” is a country-rock staple that paints a deft portrait of CSNY’s harmonizing. Any record with those two tracks on it would be a slam-dunk, but Déjà Vu also features David Crosby’s roaring hippie lament “Almost Cut My Hair,” Neil Young’s lost innocence standout “Helpless” and Graham Nash’s “Our House,” a generational ode to the ordinary bliss of his then-relationship with Mitchell (“Life used to be so hard, now everything is easy ‘cause of you”). For good measure, “Carry On” is Stephen Stills’ psych-folk album opener that solidified CSNY as a no-nonsense ripper (Stills’ guitar solo lurking in the background is subdued yet fierce, bubbling over into the band’s three-part harmony). CSNY wouldn’t make another record together until 1988, and Déjà Vu remains a career-high for all four men wrapped up in its brilliance. —Matt Mitchell\n\n232. Portishead: Dummy (1994)\n\nAs one of the progenitors of trip-hop, a uniquely British mix of electronic, hip-hop and dub, the Bristol trio Portishead made a potent statement with their debut album, 1994’s Dummy. It’s diaphanous but tangible all the same; Beth Gibbons, Adrian Utley and Geoff Barrow demonstrate that there’s a power, and even a biting edge, in serenity. Across its 11 songs, like the hypnotically groovy “Sour Times” and the rhythmic yet atmospheric “It Could Be Sweet,” Portishead remains relatively quiet without ever sounding staid, proving that stillness can be its own device for profundity. —Grant Sharples\n\n231. Ornette Coleman: The Shape of Jazz to Come (1959)\n\nHow incredible 1959 was for jazz music—as Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, the Dave Brubeck Quartet, Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, Sun Ra Arkestra and Cannonball Adderley all dropped some of the best records of their lives. Add saxophonist Ornette Coleman into the mix, and it’s hard to see how any other year for any other genre was better. But Coleman’s third album, The Shape of Jazz to Come, continued to display just how multi-dimensional the Texan was. The record reinvented the idea of what a free jazz record could be, enduring as a crowning achievement in the genre altogether. Coleman found much praise from critics and contemporaries, with Mingus even saying the work was “like organized disorganization or playing wrong right. It gets to you emotionally like a drummer.” Davis was reportedly not thrilled by Coleman’s work, but he and his backing trio—Don Cherry, Charlie Haden and Billy Higgins—turned the jazz world upside down on The Shape of Jazz to Come. “Lonely Woman” is the greatest opening track on a jazz record ever, and “Chronology” might just be the greatest closer. —Matt Mitchell\n\n230. Carly Rae Jepsen: Emotion (2015)\n\nOn Emotion, Carly Rae Jepsen transformed from a future one-hit-wonder to a pop phenom. Opener “Run Away With Me” is the rare breed of pop perfection that inspires people to make a 12 minute musical analysis about it. Skeptics would diminish Emotion as yet another white girl pop album about crushes and fantasies, but the way in which Jepsen delivers these songs is what makes it so timeless. Carly’s vocal performances and the stacked cast of producers (Shellback, Ariel Rechtshaid, Rostam and Blood Orange, just to name a few) are full of personality and refuse to shy away from their masterclass of ‘80s pop pastiche. Jepsen’s desire on this record is constant and unrelenting in the way young love and infatuation are supposed to be. —Leah Weinstein\n\n229. Beck: Odelay (1996)\n\nBeck would not be consigned to the unwelcome fate of a one-hit wonder. He may have disagreed at the time, but he was not a loser. He had plenty more to offer, as evidenced by the album he recorded and released after “Loser” catapulted him into the upper echelons of alt-rock radio rotation. 1996’s Odelay, Beck’s fifth studio album, is easily one of the greatest achievements throughout his now-decades-long career. On Odelay, he flaunts his eclecticism: the gnarly, distorted screams on opener “Devils Haircut,” the hip-hop-inspired sample-delica on “Where It’s At,” the twangy slide-guitar blues of “Lord Only Knows.” It’s a record that laid the foundation for a broad, extensive discography. —Grant Sharples\n\n228. The Avalanches: Since I Left You (2000)\n\nSince I Left You set a precedent upon its release 24 years ago. The debut outing from Australian electronica outfit the Avalanches, the record is a daring, 18-track foray into the wondrous universe of sampling and a Phil Spector-style, bassless production scope. There are varying estimates of how many samples exactly emerged from the thousands of hours Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann spent concocting Since I Left You—some say over 3,500, while others argue it’s closer to 1,000. The band had roots in punk scenes, and you can hear that foundational rebellion throughout Since I Left You—notably in how Robbie Chater and Darren Seltmann (Bobbydazzler) cut up every piece of source material under the sun and fashioned it into this ambitious, relentless and buoyant masterpiece. Standout tracks like “Frontier Psychiatrist,” “Electricity” and “Radio” boast some of the album’s rowdiest energy, while entries like “Summer Crane” and “Tonight” are much more subdued and sublime and whimsical—showcasing jazz elements as often as they are bits of pop and soul. But, the cornerstone of Since I Left You is its title track, a slice of plunderphonics that endures as, quite possibly, one of the greatest songs of the last 25 years. The Avalanches wouldn’t make another record together for 16 (!) years, but not even their near-two-decade hiatus could ever even come close to puncturing the legacy built on the shoulders of Since I Left You. Perfect records are like that—unshakable and effortlessly singular. —Matt Mitchell\n\n227. Germs: (GI) (1979)\n\nThe American counter to the Sex Pistols, Germs busted onto the scene in 1979 with their only album, (GI), and set the Western punk world ablaze. Many have thought of it as the first-ever hardcore punk album, and it was produced by a longtime friend of the band: Joan Jett. In an alternate universe, (GI) was actually produced by Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere & the Raiders—but, instead, Jett was able to get Germs’ raucous, gnarly live presence (which included a usually-intoxicated Darby Crash barely even singing into the microphone) into the studio. (GI) cost Slash Records $6,000 but immediately made an impact, even if Germs called it quits a year later. The band spawned the career of a young guitarist named Pat Smear, who would go on to play in Nirvana and the Foo Fighters, and changed the trajectory of punk rock in the States forever. Songs like “Communist Eyes,” “Lexicon Devil” and closer “Shut Down (Annihilation Mix)” are among the greatest punk tracks ever written, with the latter being infamous for its nine-minute runtime and improvised breakdowns. California punk rock was never the same after (GI), and its bruised, sadistic and violent shake-ups have made Germs immortal. Even as attention swirled around the band following the release of (GI) in 1979, Germs barely survived another year and came to an abrupt close with the death by suicide of Crash in late December of 1980—a piece of news that was quickly plowed over the shooting death of John Lennon a day later. —Matt Mitchell\n\n226. Solange: A Seat at the Table (2016)\n\nSolange sounds reborn on her third album, 2016’s A Seat at the Table. It opens with “Rise,” a fitting introduction to a record that Solange spent approximately eight years making. Her filigreed vocals, backed by rich harmonies, remain front and center. “Fall in your ways, so you can wake up and rise,” she sings, hanging on to that last word and stretching it out. A Seat at the Table is a record about easing the toil through self-realization, and, here, Solange achieves that goal on her own terms. —Grant Sharples\n\n225. Curtis Mayfield: Super Fly (1972)\n\nCurtis Mayfield pulled off a rare trifecta with his third solo album: Super Fly was a touchstone of its era, it was highly political and, perhaps as a result of the first two, it was the rare soundtrack album that made more money than the film it accompanied. With an irresistible, highly assured mix of funk and soul, Mayfield offered a searing portrait of the inner-city poverty and desperation that the movie’s conflicted drug-dealing protagonist, Youngblood Priest, is making worse even as maneuvers to escape it. With wah-wah guitar, sharp brass and gooey string arrangements, the nine songs on Super Fly (including the Top 10 singles “Freddie’s Dead” and the title track) helped define the sound of ’70s funk, while Mayfield delivered a timeless message. —Eric R. Danton\n\n224. U2: The Joshua Tree (1987)\n\nU2’s legacy seemed unassailable before their 13th album, the underwhelming Songs of Innocence, showed up unwanted on everyone’s iPhone. It was an unexpected and unintentional heel turn for a band with humble post-punk roots that once sat on top of the world. For many, that peak came with 1991’s Achtung Baby, but for me, it’ll always be their fifth album, The Joshua Tree. Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, building on their work on The Unforgettable Fire, turned every Edge guitar lick into an atmospheric dream designed to fill every corner of the arenas the band suddenly found itself in, and a perfect foundation for Bono’s earnest, hopeful lyrics. Bombast never sounded so good. The album is front-loaded with hits—the one-two-three punch of “Where the Streets Have No Name,” “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For” and “With or Without You”—but the quietly building ballads “Running to Stand Still” and “Red Hill Town” equally capture the magic of those four friends from Dublin. —Josh Jackson\n\n223. Bruce Springsteen: Nebraska (1982)\n\nWhen you think of Bruce Springsteen, you typically think of grand ambitions, big stages and larger-than-life, arena-packing choruses. On Nebraska, Springsteen’s 1982 album recorded with a Tascam Portastudio and a couple mics in a modest Colts Neck, New Jersey house, the Boss discarded the histrionics entirely for sparse, heart-wrenching lamentations like “Mansion on the Hill” and “State Trooper.” This suite of acoustic tunes was originally a demo collection, but, famously, he thought the songs sounded best this way. At his peak, even 10 of Springsteen’s demos are gifts to be treasured, rife with vulnerability, sincerity and, above all, humanity. —Grant Sharples\n\n222. The Cure: Pornography (1982)\n\nDisintegration seems to get the lion’s share of the love among the Cure’s discography, but the poignant echoes of “Lovesong” and “Lullaby” would not exist if it were not for the indulgent gloom of Pornography. After wading through the fertile mire of early goth music on Seventeen Seconds and Faith, Pornography presents the Cure’s freefall into the genre’s mushrooming abyss, immediately heralded by the opening doom spiral “One Hundred Years.” Pornography finds the Cure not just surrendering to misery, but committing to their muse through offerings of Stygian soundscapes, foglike synthlines and lyricism polluted with existential dread. While never particularly lascivious, Pornography made the Cure’s woe unprecedentedly explicit, crafting an inky sketch of an entire generation—as frontman Robert Smith wails—“waiting for the death blow.” —Victoria Wasylak\n\n221. The Supremes: Where Did Our Love Go (1964)\n\nThe Supremes are Motown royalty, and Where Did Our Love Go is their crowning achievement. In a world where singles reign supreme, the second studio album from the legendary girl group is a triumph of romantic bliss from start to finish. Diana Ross plunges us into her rich, soulful soprano over classic doo-wop tunes. This historic album was the first ever to have three #1 singles come from one work: “Where Did Our Love Go,” “Baby Love” and “Come See About Me.” Where Did Our Love Go introduced Motown to the masses and gave us the gorgeous harmonies of Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson at their best. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n220. Bob Dylan: Highway 61 Revisited (1965)\n\nIt’s hard to argue against a record that is responsible for housing one of the greatest rock ‘n’ roll songs of all time, and Highway 61 Revisited kicks off with the six-minute wonder of “Like a Rolling Stone.” But what makes Highway 61 Revisited such an important album is not just its immortal opener. Songs like “Ballad of a Thin Man,” “Queen Jane Approximately” and “Just Like Tom Thumb’s Blues” are bulletproof treasures you’d be a fool to skip during a playback. A tracklist greatly defined by its exorbitant display of organ-playing by Al Kooper and Paul Griffin, Highway 61 Revisited showcased Dylan going fully electric for the first time ever (save for a few numbers), and it christened a new age of rock ‘n’ roll—famously seeing Bob leave his protest singer image behind, exchanging social causes for absurdist, poetic musings that give blues-based rock arrangements a surreal and raucous energy. And then there’s the album’s final song, “Desolation Row,” which—I would argue—is a better encapsulation of Dylan’s greatness than “Like a Rolling Stone.” At 11 minutes and done with an extravagant use of stream-of-consciousness vignettes and biting language, it solidifies Highway 61 Revisited as a masterpiece. —Matt Mitchell\n\n219. Jeff Buckley: Grace (1994)\n\nThere is something about the plight of artists riddled with tragedy who create some of the most beautiful albums. After a decade of being a session guitarist, Jeff Buckley emerged with his only studio album in 1994 before his tragic death only three years later. Grace was the legacy of a young man gifted with a bloodline of musical talent wrestling with the pain of having an absent father—’60s folk singer Tim Buckley. Jeff found the beauty in pain on Grace with his moving cover of “Hallelujah,” which remains his most well-known track. The vocal intimacy strips you bare from the first sigh he breathes, as the opening notes ring out and the unapologetically naked production from every delicate pluck of the strings. Far from getting the flowers it deserved in Buckley’s lifetime, the tortured yet romantic album gave us the cries of anguish in “Lover, You Should’ve Come Over,” a gorgeous rendition of Nina Simone’s “Lilac Wine” and the languid beauty of “Grace.” Fighting tirelessly to stand out from his father’s shadow, Buckley found himself by intimately sharing his soul and pouring it into every note on Grace. His prowess as a musician was always the root of his guitar-centric music, but the delicacy with which he feels emotion in Grace is something that gets under your skin and won’t ever crawl out. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n218. The Band: Music from Big Pink (1968)\n\nAs the legend goes, The Band knocked out their debut album live in the studio in a matter of just two weeks. Apocryphal or not, Music From Big Pink certainly sounds as organic as that—the product of five musicians that have spent years on the road or in rehearsal spaces with one another, honing a sound that combined their varying interests in folk, R&B, jazz, country and soul. Why wouldn’t these 11 songs come out in one great big gush of inspiration as if guided by the Holy Spirit and a mess of weed and beer. Following their lead were folks like George Harrison and Eric Clapton, envious that this Canadian-American group were as authentic as it gets and trying desperately to ride their collective coattails toward a rootsier sound. But as Big Pink lays out, these boys had this sound in their bloodstream, in their bones, in their muscle memory. It all came natural and sounded as perfect and lived-in as could be. —Robert Ham\n\n217. Liz Phair: Exile in Guyville (1993)\n\nLiz Phair’s debut might just be the purest encapsulation of indie rock’s greatness that has ever been recorded. A lo-fi collection of largely four-chord tunes that was developed from 4-track demos with the help of producer Brad Wood, Exile in Guyville alternates between the anthemic (“Never Said,” “6’1””) and quietly intimate (“Gunshy,” “Explain It To Me”). A keenly insightful lyricist, Phair penned an all-timer breakup anthem (“Divorce Song”), an emboldened sex anthem that could make even Cardi B blush (“Flower”) and a downcast reflection on hookup culture, whose brutally honest final-leg lyrical twist never fails to punch the gut (“Fuck and Run”). The end result is an album far better than anyone in the toxic, macho “guyville” scene that Phair came of age in could ever dream of creating. —Tom Williams\n\n216. The Magnetic Fields: 69 Love Songs (1999)\n\nIn the eyes of Magnetic Field’s mad songwriting scientist Stephin Merritt, love can be almost anything—a chicken with its head cut off, grand pianos crashing together, a long forgotten fairytale, a trucker’s hand, jazz. And so, too, can the love song. Clocking in at almost three full hours, 69 Love Songs is a theatrical revue of sorts—a methodical exploration of the past, present and future of the love song in its most granular form. What’s incredible is how ingeniously Merritt manages to pull off this indelibly ambitious undertaking, taking us down every musical rabbit hole he can find and coming out the other side, in love and mad as a hatter. —Sean Fennell\n\n215. Led Zeppelin: IV (1971)\n\nImagine writing an eight-track album and every single on it is a massive hit. When you team up Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and John Bonham, the impossible becomes relatively achievable. IV is a staggering, genre-bending record with influences from proto-heavy metal, folk and blues that defined a decade of hard rock. IV is as dramatic—fueled mainly by Plant’s adoration for mythology—as it is a masterclass of pure rock ‘n’ roll. The cyclical, multi-layered riffs of “Black Dog,” the euphonious mandolin on “Going to California” and the somber cry of the guitar and flute on “Stairway to Heaven” have all become integrated into the classic rock ethos and endure as some of the most iconic songs of the ‘70s hard rock era—and heavy music altogether. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n214. Joanna Newsom: Ys (2006)\n\nJoanna Newsom’s Ys conjures an inexplicable magic that is as expansive as it is intimate. With only five tracks, Newsom arranges an ambitious and mythical 55-minute epic of internal struggle and wonder. Ys widens the scale set up by her 2004 album The Milk-Eyed Mender, crafting a rich and grandiose orchestral album that adeptly narrates tales of sorrow and change as if the text was pulled straight from a medieval tale. Newsom’s signature harp is showcased throughout, accompanied by a stirring blend of strings, reeds and woodwinds. Jaunty strums of banjo decorate the tracks, embellishing the album with surprising whimsical flare and texture. The complex and sweeping arrangements feel as though they were carried here from a distant and enchanting land. As fantastical as it is, Newsom asserts that each of the tracks were inspired by real events within her own life. The gravity of these potent emotions ground the whimsy of the album into a stately and striking monument of work with both depth and eccentricity. It’s widely regarded as Newsom’s best work for good reason: Ys showcases her reaching unforeseen heights with grace and mastery. —Grace Ann Natanawan\n\n213. Lil Wayne: Tha Carter III (2008)\n\nHis sixth album, Tha Carter III cemented Lil Wayne as his generation’s greatest MC—but only without delays and leaks. Still, it sold a million copies in its first week on the shelves and spawned five singles, including “Lollipop,” “A Milli” and “Got Money,” the former of which hit #1 on the Hot 100. With contributions from Jay-Z, T-Pain, Babyface, Static Major, Busta Rhymes and Fabolous, Tha Carter III was one of the first true blockbuster rap albums of the 2000s—holding court with projects like 50 Cent’s Get Rich or Die Tryin’ and Jay-Z’s American Gangster, but outpacing them both for its pop sensibilities. It’s the kind of album that elder millennials hold close and for good reason: While many of his peers have fallen out of the zeitgeist in some form or another, Lil Wayne remains just as crucial now as he was 16 years ago. Tha Carter III, despite having a producer list longer than the Bill of Rights and songs that have fallen out of sonic style and trend, is one of the greatest rap records ever made, period. —Matt Mitchell\n\n212. Grace Jones: Nightclubbing (1981)\n\nBy the time Grace Jones released her fifth album, Nightclubbing, the Jamaican club singer was nothing short of a star. Not only is it the best post-disco album, but it’s Jones’ strongest set of songs she’s ever put out. Galvanized by singles “Pull Up to the Bumper,” “I’ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango)” and “Use Me,” Nightclubbing saw Jones embracing the campy side of disco’s rubble—building on the passionate gay and cult following she’d gained through her music’s popularity in club scenes. Jones took aim at making a pop record fit with stylings of New Wave, rock, funk, reggae, R&B and post-punk, all while honing the electronic presence that her earlier work, like Fame and Muse had embodied. Nightclubbing is more of a punk record than it is a dance triumph, yet you can certainly enjoy both at the same time during a track like “Demolition Man.” Jones was the ultimate chameleon of her era, never trying to do too much with her voice and, instead, coelescing with the arrangements until every song is a character for her to embody. Ever the androgyne, Nightclubbing wears many masks and succeeds because Jones buys into the larger-than-life wardrobe of her own art. —Matt Mitchell\n\n211. Fugazi: Repeater (1990)\n\nWith Repeater, Fugazi announced themselves. Having already established a devoted local fanbase with their first two EPs and the compilation 13 Songs, they broadened their scope ahead of their full-length debut, shifting to a collectivist songwriting model that lets the whole group shine. On the anti-consumerist manifesto “Merchandise,” Joe Lally’s bassline steadily raises the stakes until Ian MacKaye erupts with that famous rallying cry: “You are not what you own.” They also render a surprise extended metaphor from the Beatles’ mid-career landmark Revolver on the album, bucking expectations with an homage and a hippie sendup at once—particularly as Guy Picciotto sneers “I’m only sleeping” into the mic on “Turnover” with pummeling drums from Brendan Canty and MacKaye on guitar surging behind him. —Annie Parnell\n\n210. The Blue Nile: Hats (1989)\n\nBefore Taylor Swift gave them a shoutout on her album The Tortured Poets Department, the Blue Nile made one of the greatest sophisti-pop records of all time: Hats. Listening to this album will change your life, I promise you that. Singles “Headlights on the Parade” and “Saturday Night” are magnificent synth-pop efforts, but the sugar-sweet melancholy of Paul Buchanan’s aching lead vocals transform the entire project. But, yes, the sheer pop triumph of “The Downtown Lights” is big enough to cement the handsomeness of Hats altogether. Few pop songs have ever risen to the Blue Nile’s level on “The Downtown Lights” or “Over the Hillside” or “From a Late Night Train” and few ever will. Hats has inspired everyone from Rickie Lee Jones to Annie Lennox to The 1975 to black midi, and the album’s enduring perfection only grows more sublime and superior with each passing year. Few records of the era can claim the same truth. —Matt Mitchell\n\n209. The Stooges: Fun House (1970)\n\nAt once cretinous and riveting, often for the same reasons, it’s hard to understate the Stooges’ influence on the punk scene that would soon follow. The band’s second album, Fun House, assembles all the elements. There are brutish guitars, pounding beats and a general air of mayhem enhanced by the sense that frontman Iggy Pop was just barely keeping himself under control. He sets the tone with a feral whoop at the start of the greasy, strutting opener “Down on the Street,” yowls over scabrous guitars on “T.V. Eye” and loses himself in the sprawling psychedelia of the title track, which comes complete with honking saxophone. Though nothing could fully capture the chaos of the Stooges onstage, Fun House came as close as possible. —Eric R. Danton\n\n208. Joni Mitchell: Court and Spark (1974)\n\nThere is a key moment in any songwriter’s career where they cross the line between “us” and “them”—meaning when they’re writing about the lives of their audience, which they too once lived while working on their earliest material, versus when they start writing about their less-relatable new lives as prominent musicians. Even the best songwriters have failed to stick the landing on this transition, but with her own turning point captured on Court and Spark, Joni Mitchell firmly cemented her legacy as a defining artist of the medium. Showing her mettle as a titan arranger and producer, it also marked the most defiant shedding of Mitchell delicate songbird image listeners had seen to date, sticking rollicking, playful gems like “Raised on Robbery” or “Free Man in Paris” alongside the razor-sharp character studies of “People’s Parties” and “Down to You.” Even in its tales of lavish travels or the music industry at large, she is able to tap into emotional truths that feel both rooted in their time and context while also transcending all of those things. —Elise Soutar\n\n207. Tom Waits: Rain Dogs (1985)\n\nIf 1983’s Swordfishtrombones saw Tom Waits stumble away from the barroom piano and wander into a junkyard, Rain Dogs sees him set up shop there and send out change-of-address cards. The album begins in the iron bowels of a ship set for Singapore and ends in drunken heartache on the streets of London town. In between, Waits takes us on a menacing, rhythmic romp through the rain-soaked haunts of the downtrodden and dispossessed. It’s a grimy, seamy, loving ode to the people and places decent society ignores, with Waits pushing his madcap kitchen sink production and near-pop songcraft to new levels of debauched sublimity. It’s his howling, Bukowskiesque masterpiece. —Matt Melis\n\n206. American Football: American Football (1999)\n\nNothing fills me with existential dread more than the opening riff of “Never Meant,” and I mean that in the best way possible. The Midwest emo suburbia hellscape is something American Football knows all too well, and their self-titled debut has that angst plastered all across it. Nothing got me through my middle school years more than a bunch of twenty-something white guys whining about their emotions because I was whining about all the same things in my mind—being stuck in my hometown but wanting something more. There is a reason we connect with the coming-of-age story. We all went through it in some capacity, which is why American Football remains a pillar of teenage dread so many years later. The soft sting of “Stay Home” captures a biting morning breath in the dead of winter; the yearning trumpet on “The Summer Ends” recreates a quiet afternoon at home with nothing to do; the cascading riff of “Never Meant” might as well be the designated sound of growing up. Perhaps the nature of emo is too self-indulgent, but honestly, the drama of teendom is worth contemplating in such an introspective way, no matter how small the problems may seem. —Olivia Abercrombie\n\n205. Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band: Trout Mask Replica (1969)\n\nDon Van Vliet’s notorious, avant-garde double LP masterwork is so impossible to ever fully grasp that its inscrutability has emerged, over time, as the main reason for why it remains such a marvel decades later. Like that old adage about trying to teach a fish to bike, trying to describe the appeal of Trout Mask Replica is like trying to deliver repair instructions after the fall of the Tower of Babel. Instruments rush by in seemingly arbitrary flurries, only to cohere into brief moments of harmonizing clarity, before disintegrating into carefully orchestrated cacophonies once again. Technically proficient pisstakes like “Pena” and “When Big Joan Sets Up” hold just as much muster in the sprawling tracklist as the unflinchingly horrifying proto-Tom Waits track “Dachau Blues,” or Van Vliet’s own acapella interstitials, or the blues-by-way-of-free-jazz “Hair Pie” instrumental jam sessions, or the relatively straightforward onslaught of “Moonlight on Vermont.” Perhaps, like a deep sea expedition, we may never completely chart Trout Mask Replica’s eccentric depths, but that’s the joy in diving back into its choppy waters time and time again. —Natalie Marlin\n\n204. Janelle Monáe: Dirty Computer (2018)\n\nTo experience Janelle Monae in all their glory, Dirty Computer is best experienced in its Black Mirror-esque, “Emotion Picture” sci-fi film form—a 48-minute romp through Monae’s Afrofuturist, dystopian world. (After all, multimedia tends to be Monae’s forte; beyond the video and album, the project also inspired them to write the short story collection The Memory Librarian.) These 14 perfectly funky pop songs are powerful, sometimes-celebratory and sometimes-biting odes to bodies and sex and race, these bits of codes and numbers that make up the computer algorithm of human identity. Dirty computers should be celebrated, Monae asserts in this masterpiece. They would know—“I am not America’s nightmare,” they sing on “Crazy, Classic, Life,” “I am America’s dream.” —Annie Nickoloff\n\n203. Leonard Cohen: Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967)\n\nLeading up to the release of Leonard Cohen’s debut album, he’d been getting noticed around New York for his poetry and prose. Many years prior, he was a guitarist in a country band called the Buckskin Boys, and the orbits of his writing and musicality were beginning to converge. He wrote a song called “Suzanne” and then Judy Collins recorded it. Folks in the industry, namely John Hammond, came to notice Cohen’s lyricism and he got a contract from Columbia within a year. Songs of Leonard Cohen sets itself apart from most other folk records of its era, namely for how pronounced and thoughtful it was from the jump. Cohen was 33 when he made it, and being that old in New York City was like being 75 in the Midwest. There’s ample wisdom and thoughtfulness across every speck of the record, on songs like “So Long, Marianne” and “Hey, That’s No Way to Say Goodbye” and “The Stranger Song.” Songs of Leonard Cohen was ahead of its time, with Nancy Priddy’s harmonies and David Lindley’s use of violin, jaw harp and flute; when I listen to it now, 56 years later, it still feels that way. —Matt Mitchell\n\n202. Built to Spill: Perfect From Now On (1997)\n\nEvery word and strum from Doug Martsch cradles a kind of cosmic magnitude, like the phenomenological metal sphere he sings of in the arresting opening moments of “Randy Described Eternity.” Built to Spill’s best albums all capture the apotheosis of their chosen modes—the airtight alt-rock of Kept It Like A Secret, the lo-fi jangle sensibilities of There’s Nothing Wrong With Love—but the way the song structures on Perfect From Now On expand and become their own galaxies is a special entity all its own, as if welding the properties of prog rock and jam bands onto the songwriting stylings of the ‘90s indie boom that Martsch emerged into. Martsch is just as likely to break into understated solos after a verse as he is a chorus, and tracks often conceal hairpin turns into crescendos or extended instrumental passages, like the numerous axis-tilting pivots of “Stop the Show” or the sudden galloping bursts of “Out of Site.” There are entire universes in each song on Perfect From Now On, beckoning you to be lost in their gravitational pull. —Natalie Marlin\n\n201. Danger Mouse: The Grey Album (2004)\n\nJay-Z loved it. Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr loved it. EMI hated it. Danger Mouse’s 2004 mash-up album, The Grey Album, collaged a cappella versions of Jay-Z’s The Black Album with samples from The Beatles 1968 self-titled album. It’s one of the greatest what-could’ve-beens in the history of rap music, and it’s one of the greatest deconstructions in the history of music altogether. The way Danger Mouse paired “99 Problems” and “Helter Skelter” is a standout, but “Dirt Off Your Shoulder / Julia” and “Justify My Thug / Rocky Raccoon” can’t be ignored. It was a revolutionary concept, putting Danger Mouse on the map before he’d get big with Gnarls Barkley a few years later. It’s the kind of record that can introduce rap fans to the Beatles and Beatles fans to Jay-Z’s rap world; “December 4th / Mother Nature’s Son” will always be one of the coldest, most emotional mashups ever. As one YouTube comment says perfectly: The Grey Album is “an album for the streets, never meant for the mainstream world. Forever beautiful.” Amen to that. —Matt Mitchell\n\n200. Massive Attack: Blue Lines (1991)\n\nIt’s hard to name a record more suave and chrome-y than Massive Attack’s Blue Lines. The 1991 debut from the schlubby Bristol, UK collective served as a framework for trip-hop, setting the American hip hop formula to a mossy electronic backdrop. “Unfinished Sympathy” and “Safe From Harm” are chillout classics, driven by undulating basslines, blissful synthesizer pads, and crisp percussion. But the album’s clear highlight is “Five Man Army,” which features spoken-word verses from The Wild Bunch sound sy"
