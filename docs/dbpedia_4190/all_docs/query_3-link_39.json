        "text": "By Ryan Demler (Dembinsky) Feb 6, 2018 • 10:16 am PST\n\nPhoto by Philip Murphy\n\nThe 1920s were a pivotal period in American cultural history. Remarkable advances arose in every segment of the arts during the economic boom period following World War I. The decade saw the beginning of the surrealist art movement, the first films to contain voice and music, the beginnings of jazz and blues, and huge technological advancements for the exposure and accessibility of the arts. Televisions, radios, and phonographs became commonplace in households, as did the automobile. Music became a much more prominent part of life for the masses, which helped garner the term the Roaring ’20s. It became the first decade with a soundtrack, and it was a soundtrack you could dance to.\n\nOn his new solo album, Arkansas, John Oates and his Good Road Band – a who’s who of Nashville virtuosos and innovators, including Sam Bush on mandolin and Russ Paul on pedal steel – set out to record a tribute album to Mississippi John Hurt, the legendary country bluesman who made massive contribution to that golden age of music and arts in the late-1920s. Mississippi John Hurt would go on to inspire countless artists including Bob Dylan, Beck, Jerry Garcia and Doc Watson. After tackling a handful of Hurt’s songs, Oates felt such a strong spirit of collaboration with his band and fondness of this period of American music that the project evolved into a collaborative portrait of this time in American history that lasted from the boom times of the Roaring ’20s through the 1929 stock market crash and into the hard times that followed in the Great Depression.\n\nAfter a storied career as one half of the highest selling duo in music history, Hall & Oates, John Oates moved to Nashville around the turn of the century, a decision that reinvigorated the dedication to his craft and he sought to improve his guitar playing across a variety of styles. Since then, he has become a musical troubadour with an encyclopedic knowledge of music history and a passion for collaboration. I caught up with Oates to discuss his love for playing with different musicians, his fondness for Mississippi John Hurt, and his pride for the great American music of the late-1920s.\n\nJAMBASE: At this stage in your life, it seems like you have really found a nice balance of exploring new and varied styles of music and you’re getting out and playing with all sorts of musicians. When you show up to a jam or a first rehearsal with some new friends where you haven’t all played together before, what do you tend to do right off the bat? Do you dive into an actual song or just throw out a key and a chord progression or something and jam?\n\nJOHN OATES: Every person in every collaboration is different. Every person brings a different approach and a different personal style to the table, but at the same time, a lot of it is very similar. I think musicians just like to play. [laughs] They like to try new things. In fact, pretty much all the musicians I’ve met are very open-minded and want to try things outside their comfort zones, even though some of them might be a little nervous. That’s where the role kind of transcends the musicianship and becomes almost a psychological element.\n\nJAMBASE: How did the coloration of this group of musicians come about? Is this a new group of friends or more established relationships?\n\nJO: On this project, I’m playing with all good friends. These are all guys I’ve known for a while who I’ve played with and recorded with in different configurations and different projects. There were no strangers involved on the record.\n\nSam Bush was one of my first friends in Nashville. He welcomed me with open arms when I first came here in the early 2000s. He’s just been great. I’ve played with his band at Telluride. I’ve sat-in with him. He’s sat-in with me. We have written together. We’ve recorded together. So, we go back and have great relationship. And It’s the same way with the rest of the guys.\n\nWhen I did the thing with Jim James at Bonnaroo in 2013 when we did the Super Jam, he had asked me to sit-in with those guys at Red Rocks and I just sat-in as a guest. I had such a good time and felt so comfortable with the My Morning Jacket band, that when it was proposed that we do something together at Bonnaroo, we already knew each other. So, it was just a matter of sitting down together and plotting out what to play and what direction we wanted to go and who our guests were going to be. Here again, that was seamless.\n\nJAMBASE: This is kind of a tangent, but did you get to know Carl Broemel, the other guitar player in My Morning Jacket? We’re all huge fans of him around here. We’ve done a bunch of stuff with him over the years.\n\nJO: Oh yeah, Carl and I go way back. He’s such a nice guy. He practically lives next door to me. He lives like a quarter of a mile away right here in Nashville.\n\nJAMBASE: Maybe talk about the guitar style on the record. This project began as a Mississippi John Hurt album and a lot of people hear that name and think of a blues guy, but it’s more country blues, Americana, almost bluegrass music. It’s kind of that fingerpicked, plucky blues-style of playing. Was that a style you were fluent in before this project or is that something you had to work at practicing to get up to speed?\n\nJO: Not to put too many labels on this thing, but I did start out planning to just play in a traditional way with just my guitar and voice. I’m still doing Mississippi John Hurt songs but in a very casual way. After doing a few tracks, I just said, “Well, sure I can do this, but what am I doing this for? Am I doing it, just to prove to other people I can do it.?” I already know I can do it. I’ve been playing these songs for 50 years. [laughs]\n\nI didn’t want to abandon the songs though. I love these songs so much, so I thought, “I wonder what would happen if I put a band together?” But I I didn’t want just a regular band. I wanted to have an eclectic group of musicians who are all come from slightly different places but could come together.\n\nSo, that’s what I did. I got a guy named Nat Smith playing cello but he’s not a cello player in a classical sense. He plays almost like a country fiddler. I have Russ Paul who is a groundbreaking pedal steel innovator who plays with Dan Auerbach among other people. Of course, Sam you know. Then in the rhythm section we have Guthrie Trapp – a fantastic electric guitar player, Steve Mackie on bass and Josh Day on drums and percussion. So, that is the band. I put them together and it was magic. The chemistry was there from the very beginning.\n\nThe first track we cut, my engineer looked at me and said, “Man, I don’t know what this is, but I love it.” It was done completely live in the studio with all analog gear with all vintage equipment and recorded to tape. This was designed to be on a vinyl record from the very beginning. There were considerations in the lengths of the songs, keeping it to 10 tracks, and timing it out right from the get-go. The main thing is that you have to keep it under a certain length per side on vinyl to ensure the things like fidelity and level are appropriately accounted for when you’re pumping out on a vinyl record. If it gets too long, the grooves in the physical product get too tight.\n\nJAMBASE: In terms of the material, I recognize a couple songs as Mississippi John Hurt, and you have a rendition of “Stack-O-Lee” (“Stagger Lee”) on there. Is the rest of the material written by you, but keeping with the stylistic flow and style of the Mississippi John Hurt music?\n\nJO: There are actually five Mississippi John Hurt songs on the record. There is “Creole Bell,” which he didn’t write, but he made it famous. Most people think he was the guy, but that song was written at the turn of the century in the early-1900s. “Stack-O-Lee” was his interpretation of a song that has been recorded by a million people. I first heard that song in 1959 by Lloyd Price, who was a singer had a rock hit with that song in 1959. So, we do our own version on that one. There is a song called “Lord Send Me,” a gospel song, that John used to like to start his shows with and then there is “Make Me a Pallet on Your Floor,” but I reworked it a little and added a refrain and named it “Pallet Soft and Low.”\n\nThe album just sounded so good and there was something going on that I wanted to keep it going, so I said, “What other songs would have been contemporary in Mississippi John Hurt’s early recording career in the late-1920s when he was recording for OKeh Records?” I read that he was a big fan of Jimmie Rodgers, so I chose “Miss the Mississippi and You”, which was a song that I played for the first time at Bristol Rhythm & Roots festival about five or six years ago. I love that song and we did a great arrangement of that.\n\nThen I started thinking about his guitar playing, which I think a lot of people mistakenly lump into this delta blues category, but he is really more hill country. His style is more reminiscent of ragtime than it is delta blues. So, I decided to do a Blind Blake song. Anybody who knows guitar will probably agree that Blind Blake is the king of the ragtime guitar.\n\nThen I started thinking back to this late-1920s period and how it was such an interesting time as it was essentially the beginning of radio and it was the beginning of the phonograph machine, so people could play albums. So, I started looking into what was the first hit record. What would be a record that would be played on the radio or played in people’s homes at that time? Emmett Miller’s version of “Anytime” is arguably one of the first hit records ever made in America. That was considered one of the earliest hit songs.\n\nThe album started to take on a wider scope and it started becoming a snapshot of this early American period of music in the late-1920s and early-1930s.\n\nJAMBASE: You wrote the title track. I assume that would be the single? I like how “Arkansas” feels almost like the crescendo if you’re thinking about it in the context of the whole album.\n\nJO: I’m a songwriter and I’m not really used to doing albums of cover versions of other people’s songs. I took a trip to Wilson, Arkansas just north of Memphis. After a show up there, I walked out into some cotton fields on the banks of the Mississippi River and moonlight was glistening and I was standing in this spot where it felt like this American music kind of came up all the way from the delta in the south through St. Louis and Chicago and it seemed to crystallize what I was doing on the record. It gave me this evocative feeling that I was standing at the epicenter of this great American musical tradition. I wrote the song on pure emotions really.\n\nOn that song, there is a blending of kind of rootsy sentiment and styles with a modern sensibility and a bit more of a pop sensibility. To me, that is who I am. I’m this blending of roots and traditional music that I grew up with as a kid and the popular music that I made through my career with Hall & Oates. In a way, that song glues the album together.\n\nJAMBASE: Is that a guitar solo or a distorted mandolin? I couldn’t figure out what instrument that was, but I really dig how that sort of towers over the music, but the singing and the rest of the band is still up in the mix too.\n\nJO: That’s a pedal steel guitar. He’s not like any other pedal steel guitar player. He uses effects and it’s almost like a rock slide guitar. Sam does play his slide electric mandolin on “Pallet Soft and Low” though. Russ Paul’s pedal steel playing is really amazing and unique.\n\nJAMBASE: In a general sense, you have a ton going on right now. There is this album with all the affiliated promotion and shows supporting it, and then you have a massive Hall & Oates tour coming up beginning on May 1st. How are you feeling? Are you a person who gets a little stressed out or more just excited during times like this when you have so many big things happening?\n\nJO: [laughs] Well, I’m trying not to be. It really is a lot of stuff going on though. First of all, this album was supposed to come out in the spring, and there wasn’t supposed to be a lot of Hall & Oates shows in 2018. I was going to work on this album and Daryl [Hall] was going to work on his TV show, but things changed when the group Train became available and it was proposed that we do this tour together.\n\nEverything changed and I had to push my album release up to February and this giant Hall & Oates tour was quite frankly too good to turn down. So, that’s what happened and why this year might seem crazy. I didn’t intend 2018 to be quite so jammed, but my goal is to do it all and have a great time doing it.\n\nJAMBASE: I was curious with Train, have you thought about what you are going to do with the collaborative part of the show?\n\nJO: We’re working on a song together that is more like a single. So, we’re still working on that one, but it’s coming along nicely. We haven’t decided what else we’re going to do together, but we’ll figure it out. We definitely want to make it collaborative. I played with them at Jazz Fest and went on their cruise, and Daryl has had them on his show. So this will be a lot of fun.\n\nJAMBASE: Alright last question. Will the mustache be ready for May 1st?\n\nJO: [laughs] The mustache is always ready. I’ve already got a mustache goatee situation going on, so I think we’re in good shape. [laughs]\n\nBy Ryan Demler (Dembinsky) Feb 16, 2010 • 3:16 pm PST\n\nAre people born with rhythm?\n\nSitting down at the kitchen table inside 88-year-old jazz legend Chico Hamilton‘s midtown Manhattan apartment, chewing the fat about jazz music and his storied career as a drummer and bandleader – a career that includes holding court for jazz royals “Duke” Ellington and “Count” Basie, playing storied musical engagements with his school kid pal Charles Mingus, receiving a living legend of jazz award from the Kennedy Center, and recording on over 60 albums – likely marks one of those stories I’ll tell my grandchildren one day. Not only did Hamilton leave a musical legacy that virtually mirrors the history of jazz since the 1940s, but in just a short visit I learned that Chico just recently suffered congestive heart failure, yet continues to play shows with guys half his age and just recently put out an incredible new album titled the Twelve Tones of Love (released last April on Joyous Shout Records).\n\nThis question of rhythm came up about midway through the chat and Chico said, “Well they all got a heart. They all feel the beat of their heart.”\n\nFrom there, he ordered me, “Put you’re your hand on your heart. Now take your other hand and keep the beat. Now sing this, ‘Do Do Do Do; Doot Doot,’” as he nodded along with the four quarter notes and two subsequent half notes. “Let me hear you sing it,” he said, chuckling as I sang through the beat. “That’s the oldest beat that I know of; that’s the bottom line of jazz. That’s The Charleston.”\n\nI think I just took a music lesson from a living jazz legend. Check that one off the bucket list.\n\nComposer\n\nChico’s new album, Twelve Tones of Love, sounds at once fresh, mellow, listenable, funky, and melodic – as fresh a jazz album as I’ve heard in ages – but Hamilton downplays all of these in a charismatic, albeit humble manner.\n\n“There’s no such thing as new music,” he says. “Somewhere, somebody played that same note. The only thing different is the rhythmic articulation. We still don’t know which came first, rhythm or movement. The freest thing that a human being can do is dance.”\n\nIn talking about his studio effort, I inquired if the title referenced the musical approach known as the twelve-tone method.\n\n“Exactly. C, C#, and all the way up,” he says. “I do it because there ain’t no bad notes. Every note means something. It’s simple; you hear the sound, you play the note.”\n\nIf only it was so easy. Hamilton has a way of describing music where you know he feels it in a way not everybody can. “You’re playing in all the keys,” he adds. “Keys don’t mean a thing. That enables you to play what’s called a moveable ‘do’ [as in do-re-mi].”\n\nProdigy\n\nIn his early days, Chico made a quick study to jazz and earned himself early recognition on the West Coast.\n\n“When I was eight-years-old, my mother took me to the Paramount to see Duke Ellington and his orchestra. Back then, the orchestra stood in a pyramid and at the top was Sonny Greer. Man, he had more drums than a drum store. People just went nuts for him. He was the first real percussionist.”\n\nAt eight years of age, Chico experienced that cathartic performance and subsequently realized he had a unique talent. “Play me anything, I can play it,” he claims. The West Coast jazz scene took to Chico like a burr on wool and before long he was playing with his idols like Lester Young, Lionel Hampton, Billie Holiday, and George Jones. “Eight years later, I was in that exact same seat, playing with Duke at 16-years-old.”\n\nBandleader\n\nHaving tackled the drums and percussion with Ray Lewis authority, Chico stepped out front into the limelight in 1955 as a bandleader and he never looked back. This is a curious feat given the fact that Hamilton came from a largely self-taught background. Presumably, learning the drums and keeping time comes more naturally, but Hamilton evolved into one of the finest bandleaders of the day – many days for that matter – which comes as a direct tertiary of his dedication to the craft, his understanding of space, and the piecing together of different skill sets. Asked what makes a great bandleader, Chico responded diplomatically, “A better word is ‘good.’ What makes a ‘good’ bandleader? To be a good bandleader, you have to be a great sideman first. You can’t run before you can crawl.”\n\nTeacher\n\nSimilarly, almost from the get-go, Hamilton established not only a reputation as a virtuoso player, but also as a launching pad for aspiring jazz musicians. In fact, the seminal jazz bible, Ted Gioia’s The History of Jazz, attributes the late legendary alto saxophonist Eric Dolphy’s earliest successes and notoriety to his association with Hamilton.\n\nWhat drives Hamilton to make the effort to look out for the careers of younger musicians on the rise, while many musicians preoccupy themselves foremost with furthering their own careers?\n\n“That’s just the way I grew up,” he says. “I got help from the pros like Lester Young and Joe Jones. Basically, I was self-taught, which is not easy. I’m still teaching myself new things. I still take lessons from time to time.”\n\nThis “what goes around comes around” attitude led Hamilton to become an original founding member of The New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in 1987. Over 20 years later, while Chico rarely leaves the confines of his New York City apartment – equipped with a drum kit and keyboard parked in front of his living room television – he still makes the effort to teach an ensemble class at the New School. To this day, most of the players in Chico’s live band are former students from the program.\n\n“What I stress when I teach is that it takes all kinds of music to make music,” he offers. “I don’t care if it’s country western or pop-rock, if it’s good, it deserves to be played and it deserves to be listened to.”\n\nFilm Contributor\n\nPerhaps a tribute to the depth of Chico’s personality, which easily maneuvers a balance of quick wit, thoughtful emotion, and quirky philosophies, Hamilton has also enjoyed a long career adding his colorful contexts to the movie industry, contributing compositions, pre-recorded numbers for soundtracks, and even his well-worn face as an actor.\n\n“There’s only been one producer/director that I actually liked and that is Roman Polanski. In the film Repulsion, we had 25 music cues and yet we only had a single discussion. For the rest, he was cool. The producers, they forget why they hired you.”\n\nIt’s funny, because you often hear how everyone in Hollywood wants a piece of the soundtrack and should have a say in the music, but Hamilton’s sentiments definitely mirror these notions.\n\n“They ultimately become the music people. First, they want the music in a certain place, but then they take it out and put it in another place; the wrong place,” Chico states emphatically. “The interesting part about writing music for film is knowing where not to put music.”\n\nPerson\n\nTo think that a jazz legend with over 70 years in the upper crust of music’s finest still gets hurt feelings may be mind boggling, but it’s also true. As a music fan, casual listener or even critic, sometimes we forget that we’re judging somebody’s life’s work, and it may well influence them.\n\n“Every time I play – whether I sound good, bad, or different – I’m doing the best I can. You can’t please people as far as the music’s concerned,” he says. “I want to make something clear: I don’t play music for people; I play music for music’s sake. That way you don’t get your feelings hurt. I realize that I have been blessed to the extent that music is God’s will and God’s will shall be done.”\n\nHamilton returned to these themes a number of times throughout the course of our short visit. While a wise musical philosopher on the outside, the fact that he’s both a deeply emotional man and musician came across as clear as highway thinking.\n\n“You know what my name is? It’s Foreststorn. Back when I was in the service, people kept looking at my name not knowing how to say it. So, people started calling me Chico. You know what Chico means?”\n\nDoesn’t it mean boy?\n\n“It means ‘little boy’,” he retorts. And there must be something to that, because 88 years later, Chico Hamilton still runs with the passion of a young boy, and frankly, it’s both inspiring and entirely contagious. We should all be so lucky to achieve such broad reach and versatility in our chosen field, and keep at it with the same unbridled furor after so many years – particularly when that field is music.\n\n“Yeah totally, I’m like the anti-feminist, you know what I mean?” she laughs. “I think the reason they were interested in us was because they had this anti-diva caricature of who I was. They didn’t know I had changed my fashion sense quite a bit in the past few years, so they were looking at the old pictures in the plaid and the boots and kind of wanted that, which is funny, because I haven’t worn that clothing for years, as I’ve slowly been getting more comfortable in my own skin and loving the front-woman role, and even enjoying fashion. All of the sudden, I showed up in this beaded dress and they were kind of shocked. They were expecting the little hippie from Vermont, which I still am, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love to wear a little spangled mini-dress. It was definitely a funny proclamation of the fact that people change and grow up. The word diva still doesn’t fit my character at all, but in that moment, I owned it, and I really enjoyed the role I got to play.”\n\nThe Origins of the Flying V\n\nIt’s not every guitar player who strolls into the music store and picks up a Gibson Flying V guitar. From the sheer look of the instrument to a famous pedigree that includes Jimi Hendrix, Billy Gibbons and Albert King, the Flying V is an intimidating instrument. It takes chutzpah to play it and even more to own it.\n\nHaving quickly become one of the newest faces to become identifiable with the ferocious axe, Grace Potter still remembers the very first time she picked up the iconic guitar.\n\n“I remember the feeling of holding it the first time,” Grace recalls. “We were in Mike’s Music in Cincinnati and I thought, ‘this thing is just too ridiculous for words.’ I didn’t want to try it, but Matt our drummer handed it to me and was like, ‘just give it a whirl.’ I’m telling you, there’s something about the feeling of the action or the way the Flying V feels in my hands, the weight distribution and everything is just perfect for my body. I put it in Open E tuning – being a little Jimmy Page wannabe – and just played it and played it, and I didn’t want to put it down.”\n\nDespite falling in love with the guitar on that first occasion, Grace and the band had to head to a gig opening up for Derek Trucks, so she left it behind on that day. But clearly her bandmates saw something about the way she coveted it, because a few months later, they gave her a big surprise.\n\n“I had to leave it behind and I was so bummed,” she remembers. “Then, a couple of months later it was my birthday, and Matt and the band pooled their money together and gave it to me. I freaked out!”\n\nCooking with Cabot\n\nTake note, corporations: There’s no better sponsorship than helping out your local bands with tour support. The good folks at Cabot Cheese have been backing Grace Potter and the Nocturnals for years, and the support has really made a difference in their ascent to prominence. Not only does the band get an endless supply of Cabot’s delicious cheddar on the road, but without them, they might not haven been able to tour so exhaustively.\n\n“Cabot has been our greatest friend and companion on the road for the past two years and they continue to support us,” Grace gushes. “If they hadn’t sponsored us for this latest tour, I don’t think we’d be able to be in a bus. Every time we head out on the road, it’s all about number crunching. Even though there are 11 of us and it’s a big crew and production, that doesn’t necessarily mean we can afford a bus. Cabot definitely made that possible for us. We are so lucky to have such a great partner. It’s fun to have food and rock n’ roll right next to each other. And who doesn’t like Cabot Cheddar?”\n\nOften, fans assume that once their favorite bands reach a certain size whereby they are traveling by bus and playing decent-sized rooms, that it’s automatically profit time, but it’s not nearly so cut and dry. In speaking with Grace, it’s clear that the tours are still run on a pretty tight budget and that she spends a lot of time making sure the finances are in check.\n\n“I see bands on tour, and they are out there with the two buses and a tractor trailer, and I don’t know how they do it,” she ponders. “Obviously, they sell more tickets than us, but it surprises me, because I know the expenses and I get like fever nightmares about maxing out the budget and coming back from a 48-date tour without any money left in the bank. I guess that’s a risk people take.”\n\nStrip Clubs, Baby!\n\nEven though she’s clearly the face of the band, Grace Potter makes a concerted effort to maintain a collaborative spirit and camaraderie amongst the band members. While she does most of the press and publicity work, they all play major roles in both the music and personality of the collective. And, they definitely know how to have a good time together on the road. Asked what kind of trouble they get up to on tour, Grace replied without flinching, “Strip clubs, baby!”\n\n“No, we love going out and enjoying the town. Usually, when we come into a city, I like to just get out and walk. It doesn’t matter how far we are from civilization, it’s great to just explore. My favorite thing to do in the summertime is to drag everybody out to the farmer’s market, get some good local produce, and come back to the bus and cook for everybody. That’s more rewarding and cheaper than going out and spending money every night. Plus, that saves us money that we can spend at the strip clubs!” she laughs.\n\nHarnessing the Sexuality\n\n“The whole sort of transformation was triggered by the fact that I’m a 26 year-old woman and when Cat joined the band, I realized that we’ve got some serious sexual power,” Grace explains. “If you hang out with us backstage, we’re all like the flirtiest, most sexually evolved creatures, and yet on-stage for some reason, we were hiding it. So, I just decided when Benny and Cat joined that it was time for a complete overhaul, and to be more unabashed about our sexuality.”\n\nAs expected, shopping has become a bigger part of the equation as Grace picks out all of her own outfits for the shows. “For me, it’s a really exciting exploration, going to the stores and finally being able to buy the dresses that I’ve always wanted, and to actually wear them and own them; do the rock star thing right and not hide it behind this veneer of being wholesome and being from Vermont, because honestly, there’s nothing wholesome about me.”\n\nHer favorite haunts for picking up show dresses include BCBG Max Azria and a London-based company called All Saints. Interestingly, a store by the name of Haut Hippie, which sells to large department stores like Bloomingdale’s and Nordstrom’s, also recently contacted the band to let them know that a portion of their clothing line was inspired by Grace Potter and the Nocturnals music.\n\nNot a Female Bass Player, A Bass Player\n\nWhen The Nocturnals put the word out that they were looking for a new bass player back in 2009, the band did not make a point of hiring a female bass player. They simply aimed to get the best bassist they could whose personality fit the group. In the end, the very first person to call, Catherine Popper, got the job.\n\n“Cat’s dynamic and what she brings is something I love to talk about, but at the same time, it’s something not to be misunderstood,” Grace elucidates. “I did not want a female bass player. It was not, ’oh, let’s get another chick in the band.’ She is not a female bass player. She is a bass player! I really loved what she did with Ryan Adams and the Cardinals, so I was excited that we were even on her radar. And then to meet her and realize that she was exactly like me, kind of this naughty crap-mouth girl that has all these exciting quirks about her personality. It felt like a really easy fit.”\n\nBalls to the Wall\n\nSo what’s in store for 2011 after such a groundbreaking year in 2010? More of the same: touring like banshees, gearing up for festival season, writing new material and eventually heading back to the studio.\n\n“In the summer, our tour will hopefully take us through all the different cities that we didn’t have a chance to touch on this tour,” Grace highlights. “We’ll probably wind up in the studio at some point doing a little Rolling Stones’ Let It Bleed action. And, I’m really devoted to sharing more music with fans, especially live music. So, that’s something we’re just starting to get a grip on. I really just excited for summer to come.”\n\nAs Grace puts it, “It’s gonna be balls to the wall.”\n\nBy Ryan Dembinsky (Ryan Demler) Mar 28, 2016 • 9:01 am PDT\n\nPhoto via Bill Walton Twitter\n\nSitting down with Bill Walton to discuss the Grateful Dead and his new book, Back From The Dead, an epiphanic generational gap between an old-school Deadhead and a 38-year old neophyte by comparison revealed itself unexpectedly. On three distinct occasions, Bill Walton busts my chops for an archetypal habit of a modern day fan. “There you go with the ranking and the rating, again,” he laughs.\n\nFirst, I tried to draw out the comparison of his Trailblazers 1977 NBA championship season as the pinnacle of his NBA career which happened concurrent to the Dead’s mighty May/June 1977 run. Both of these events occurred at the exact same point in time, yet Bill couldn’t have cared less.\n\n“I don’t think about it that way all,” he objects. “The pinnacle is today and the band is playing better today than they have ever played. Their equipment is better. They have always been out there willing to experiment on every level. What Bear [sound engineer Owsley Stanley] did and every step along the way, they were never afraid to be out in front.”\n\nHis mentality is quite the opposite of most fans today as we tear apart every detail of every show, devote entire websites to unearthing the best versions of songs, and endlessly stratify the relative value of shows and eras.\n\n“I’m the same way in everything,” he explains in reference to not just music but also to sports. “ESPN has changed the way we look at the world. Everybody wants to know what is the best? Who is the best ever? That is not me. Today is the best. I go to shows for fun. I go because that is where you find the most interesting people in the world are and where you never know what is going to happen. It’s like opening a great book when you don’t know the story, or playing a basketball game. I love it live.”\n\n“There you go again, ranking and rating,” he laughs again. This time I’m asking about who he considers his closest comrade within the Grateful Dead organization, pointing out that despite deep friendships with all the band members, most of whom have stayed with him at his San Diego home, he seemed particularly close with longtime crew member Lawrence “Ramrod” Shurtliff. Ramrod is referenced often in Back From The Dead and in our conversation as a particularly close friend, and he was the one who delivered the news of Jerry’s passing in 1995.\n\n“Once I met the band in 1974,” he says, “A lot of things changed in terms of access to the music. If I was at the show, they would just hand me the tapes right as I was walking out and if I wasn’t there, Ramrod would mail me the tapes. For the home games in Portland, the son of our radio man, Bill Schonely, knew how to run the PA system in the entire arena. I think games started at 8 o’clock in those days, much later than they start now on the West Coast. So if you’re in there at 7 o’clock, yesterday’s Grateful Dead show would be playing on the PA system through the entire Portland Coliseum. I don’t think the other guys or the coaches even knew what was going on,” he jokes. “It was a completely different world back then. If you go to an NBA game today it’s so organized. It was not like that at all. The games managed to start on time though, unlike the Grateful Dead concerts.”\n\n“Ramrod was phenomenal in that he loved sports and he loved Oregon. He was a very quiet person. He was not loquacious or boisterous. He liked to be in the back. When he did speak, it was pearls of wisdom with precise timing. When you are out there in the front and you’re racing, you need someone with that level of big picture perspective and patience. He brought that to the team. There were so many personalities in that group. All the guys like Dan Healy, Bear, Ramrod, Big Steve [Parish] and all these people at Ultrasound made this intergalactic community. Then you have [lyricists Robert] Hunter and [John Perry] Barlow telling all the stories of our lives that we can’t express ourselves. I have a house full of instruments and I have zero musical talent, so I needed these guys.”\n\nBill Walton has been seeing the Grateful Dead and its scions for 49 years. He counts his total dead shows at 849, which breaks down to a manageable 17 shows a year. The math is a little fuzzy though since the tally seems to include post-Jerry iterations, but regardless he’s clearly earned his title as Celebrity Deadhead Number One. “We went all the time, that’s all we did,” he explains. “They played every weekend and then you had the Jerry Garcia Band, Ace, and all the other bands I love like Neil Young, Crosby, Stills & Nash, the Eagles, The Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen. It was literally all the time and we still do it, and it’s not enough. If it’s Grateful Dead music or Grateful Dead players, we are there. At the end of the shows in Chicago, I just looked around and said look at how happy everyone is, look at how happy the band is, and look how much money everybody just made,” he laughs. “How could you possibly think about stopping?”\n\nThe main premise of Bill’s book is to provide a ride along view into the intense peaks and valleys of his life as he struggled both physically and emotionally with great successes cut short by never-ending injuries that derailed him at every turn. He begins the book in 2009 at his life’s nadir, lying on the ground, incapable of moving, and ready to give up due to a complete spinal failure. He considered ending his own life, but with the the help of great doctors, a solid network of emotional support, and music, he pulled through and recovered. “Don’t ever let the music stop,” he sighs. “Sadly, that’s exactly what I did, because I was so sick after my spine broke down. I’m always sick with something, or somebody. Music is one of my three medicines. The other two are athletic participation, which I couldn’t do, and then being with the guys and being on a team, which I also couldn’t do. When you have the opportunity to move and listen to music, it makes you feel better.\n\n“Plus, I’m a really good dancer, although nobody else would be able to verify that besides me,“ he jokes. “When I started to get better and I realized that I hadn’t been listening to music, I wrote a big sign and put it right on my desk that says ‘Turn the Music On.’ It reminds me any time I’m working, that the music should always be on.”\n\nMusic is far more than a form of entertainment or escapism for Bill. It’s his north star and his religion.\n\n“Everything changes in life every single day,” he says. “Where I am today is defined by four mantras. One: when you get confused listen to the music play. Two: we used to play for silver now we play for life. Three: once in awhile you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right. And four: it all rolls into one but nothing comes for free. The privilege that I have to be a part of this family that you, me and JamBase are all a part of, it means a lot to me.”\n\nThroughout both his own struggles, and later in helping others through their own struggles with back pain, he often uses the lyrics from “Mission In The Rain” as a motivator to keep trying, take that extra step to get the remote, or push a little harder to get the bike up the hill.\n\n“That song to me is about the passion and the compassion in understanding of how hard it is out there,” he explains. “One of the endless great things about the Grateful Dead is how they are able to take this sad, cruel, brutal, hard world with all this pain and isolation, and make you feel better. They are able to put a big splash of beauty on it. It’s not just the music, it’s the fans, the artwork, and the happiness of being part of the team. Whether it’s ‘Mission In The Rain,’ ‘Standing On The Moon,’ ‘Stella Blue’ or the endless other songs, I go to them for a lot of different reasons: to be educated, to be stimulated, to gather strength, to gain confidence. I go to be healed.”\n\n“You’re getting into the ranking and the rating again,” he cuts me off laughing, busted again. I wanted to hear a favorite Jerry Garcia story. “Jerry was super fun, super nice, and super smart. I was on the inside of that scene in a sense, but I’m really just a fan. So, I used to care what they played and where they played. Now I’m only interested in how they play. Athletes, artists, writers, and musicians are the ultimate entrepreneurs. We have to create something from nothing every single day. Jerry knew that and he loved to work. He was like Larry Bird and John Wooden. He loved to come and do his thing every day. He would always have his guitar and he was always practicing. At first, I would always bug him, please play this or please play that, and he would say no every time. Maybe once in awhile he would play one.\n\n“I stopped doing that eventually,” he says, “much to their joy and relief. I realized that it’s their show and they are trying to teach us something. The way that they work so hard at the preparation, it’s quite similar to a basketball team when you have a great team like the Warriors are now or the Celtics or the Blazers were in the past. You always have a plan in place, but it never quite goes according to plan. But they were always ready. A Larry Bird, a John Wooden, and a Jerry Garcia understood that as the leader that this is a privilege to be able to do this. Privilege comes with the burden of responsibility of getting it right. When they didn’t, they knew they had to do better. I respect that.”\n\nA large part of what draws Walton to the Grateful Dead is the serendipitous twists of fate and the “we are everywhere” mentality.\n\n“One of my favorite stories recently was after [Fare Thee Well] Santa Clara,” he describes. “The shows end and all we want is more. Keep playing and don’t stop. The planes and the hotels and airports are full of Deadheads and it’s going 24/7 and then at the end you’re like, it’s over. It’s always really sad when you’re in that car or on your bike and you’re leaving the tour. We were on this plane going home and it was quiet as could be and everybody is thinking ‘oh my god that was incredible and it’s over.’ So we land in San Diego and out of nowhere Southwest cranked ‘Truckin’’ on the PA. Everyone was cheering and dancing on this plane, and we were so excited to go back to Chicago for the next weekend.\n\n“I couldn’t believe at the Fare Thee Well shows how young everybody looked. All these people who had no idea about the Grateful Dead came out,” he says, pulling a bit of rank. He has other more lasting stories of fate with the band. Bill and his wife Lori offer differing accounts of how they met. She claims they met at a Dead show, while Bill claims they met somewhere else. “We met at church,” he says. “It was a very special, personal, unique church.”\n\nHe’s not the only one either. In 1986, Bill took his Celtics teammates to see a Grateful Dead show at the Boston Garden and turned both Larry Bird and Kevin McHale onto the band. Interestingly, Rick Carlisle met his wife at the show, it was their first date.\n\n“Rick calls me and says ‘Bill, I want to marry this girl, she’s fantastic,’” Walton recalls. “‘The Dead are playing tonight and I really want to take her.’ You couldn’t reach people easily back in those days, so I tell him just go to the show, knock on the back door, and ask for Ramrod. So he tells this girl, look we don’t have any tickets, and she thinks it’s never going to work, but they try. The guys open the door at the venue and look at him, straight laced, and think who is this guy asking for Ramrod? But he says, ‘I’m Rick Carlisle. I’m friends with Bill Walton.’ So they let them in and got them right up there right in front of Jerry, and they have been married ever since.\n\n“That’s just the way it works with the Grateful Dead and why I live for it,” Bill describes. “These things always happen, just like the rainbow at Fare Thee Well, ‘Truckin’’ on the airplane, or when Mount St. Helens blew up while they were playing ‘Fire on the Mountain.’”\n\nFinally, the music is a form of preparation for Walton. On the 10 year anniversary of Jerry’s passing, he found one of his longtime favorite songs at the Comes A Time tribute show at the Greek Theater in Berkeley where Trey Anastasio and Bruce Hornsby got together to play a chilling “Standing On The Moon.”\n\n“This is an overwhelming version,” Bill recalls. “There are so many songs like this, but on this one particular day everybody is crying and the colors and sounds are better than perfect. That song carried me for a long time. I got a recording of this show and this Hornsby/Trey collaboration became my music to get in the zone. I always use music to get ready. The first one of those I ever had was Tchaikovsky’s 1812 Overture, but I used this Hornsby/Trey song for the longest time and I would just replay it over it over. I’d call Hornsby afterwards and start screaming ‘We’re standing on the moon, Bruce. Let’s go! We’ve got a game!’ He’d say, ‘Bill, take a deep breath.’”\n\nBill doesn’t look at the Grateful Dead as counter-culture. He looks at it as it as his life.\n\n“They are the pilots of the spaceship, and you know when you’re in that moment that you are in the right place, you are going someplace that is better than where you are right now. The thing that always made me so proud is how happy everybody always was in the organization even though there was a lot of loss and sadness. They come out and they filled us all with strength. At the end of the show, you’re thinking if they can do that, we can do anything. The only time it gets sad is when they stop playing. We never thought they would stop playing. I always thought, ‘I’m with those guys.’”\n\nBy Ryan Dembinsky (Ryan Demler)\n\nCatching up with Marc Brownstein as he juggled a busy schedule of five flights in the span of three days, it’s clear that the lack of tDB shows this year has the band more excited to play than ever. The break has been tough on fans, but the upside of the hiatus is that the band has a sense of freedom in having the entire catalog fresh. There’s no worrying about the rotation or what’s been played lately: it’s a clean slate. And in Bisco fashion, instead of playing in the practice room, why not just go out and play shows?\n\nAs Marc put it, “Practice is great, but you play at a different level of intensity at a show. No matter how hard you try to play at a practice, you can’t replicate what happens when the adrenaline starts pumping at a show. You just can’t. Your fingers get ripped to pieces at the show, not at practice. No matter how hard you pluck, you don’t rip your fingers at practice. It’s weird. You get on that show and play for three or three and a half hours and it’s just a different kind of intensity. So, we thought, we’re heading into our biggest shows of the year; it’d be nice to have a couple shows under our belt you know?”\n\nHidden Track: So, before we get into the more topical stuff, I wanted to take a step back and ask you about back when you were first learning music and playing bass. What kind of music you were listening to and maybe even seeing live that led you to improvisation?\n\nMarc Brownstein: I started with music when I was seven, right about when John Lennon died. That was a BIG catalyst for me when he died. It was like, what is going on in the streets of New York? What is causing all of this hysteria and mayhem? So, I started getting into the Beatles really heavily. Then, by the time I get into six or seventh grade and met my first band, I played piano and played through that whole catalog of Beatles songs and started getting into more psychedelic music like the Doors and the Who and super classic rock, Pink Floyd.\n\nMy first band was a Doors cover band. We were like Depeche Mode meets the Doors. It was three keyboard players and a drummer [laughs], but we played only Doors songs. I played all the basslines and so what happened was about halfway through that year, even though the Doors didn’t really have a bass player, the idea was maybe I should just go to bass and play the lines on bass. So, that’s actually how I got into bass, by getting split onto the basslines of the Doors music. Since none of us could really play perfectly two-handed, so we split up all the parts on the keyboards. One guy would play the guitar lines on the keyboard, one guy would play the right hand on the keyboard, and I played the bass parts on the keyboard.\n\nAnd then I discovered the Grateful Dead from there. That’s how I got into improv, and of course then I discovered Phish and that’s when I decided I was sure I wanted to do this for a living. Then I discovered electronic music, which is when the Disco Biscuits started to have some relevance was when we were able to take it all the way up to where we wanted to go and then go past that to the new level.\n\nNow, the new band has stripped out the improv – not all of it, but a lot of it – and is concentrating just on the electronic side. So, it’s almost a full evolution from the beginning, which is the Beatles to the present.\n\nHT: I also wanted to ask you again on the more historic stuff, as part of the older generation of fans who got into it more at the beginning around ‘98 or ‘99, I was curious how that period of when things started getting big pretty fast compares to now in terms of your excitement for it and being wide-eyed musicians?\n\nMB: It’s exactly the same [laughs]. We were just saying that all weekend. When we got onstage at Electric Forest this weekend and there was 15,000 people watching Conspirator , you know Conspirator was built from nothing a year ago. It was from scratch. We were playing after-show Disco Biscuits parties. It’s really hard to start from scratch with a new band and so, right now, this last couple of months we’re seeing some really solid growth. From last year’s festivals to this year’s festivals; you know last year there really weren’t many people watching us.\n\nThis year it’s ridiculous. That’s what touring really hard does. People start to know these guys are playing a lot, and people start saying, “Hey, these guys are good, I saw them here, it was good.” So, it gets to the point where everyone at the festival wants to check it out and that’s what happened. It happened at Electric Forest. It happened at Wanee. It happened at at Summer Camp. It’s fun, every time we get onstage at a festival this year, there’s been 10,000 to 15,000 people. Even in Buffalo last night, we were opening for moe. You know, opening bands usually don’t really draw as people aren’t really there to see them, that’s just the way it is, but it was packed when we played. This week has just been great. We’ve really just been taking it in. I was describe right now as exactly the same as what you described back then the first time around when it started to blow up.\n\nHT: So, what led to the decision to add the Road to Camp Bisco shows?\n\nMB: We haven’t played shows in a while and Aron and I aren’t playing that weekend, so we all got together and said, “Do you guys think we should play some extra shows since we’re barely playing?” Everyone was into it and Camp Bisco is selling really, really well. It should be sold out by the time the Road to Camp starts. For us, that was just a big a catalyst. The thing is blowing up, so let’s play some more shows. We’re close to home and it’ll be set up perfectly. Ultimately, we’ll get on stage at Camp Bisco with the fire of having played six full sets right before, rather than sitting just in the practice room.\n\nHT: The Disco Biscuits have been pretty innovative in terms of letting fans help choose setlists and things like that. We were curious, if you’re looking through a thousand or however many submissions you might get, what kind of ideas stick out or what ultimately piques your interest and gets chosen?\n\nMB: Some people don’t understand about tempos or keys, so the ones that ultimately get picked are from musicians. I feel like they have to be musicians or at least have a heightened sense of time and key. They have a really strong ear and can tell that this song would go really well into this that song. That’s the type of thing we’re looking for. You know, where the keys work, where the tempos build, and the creative usage of the catalog. If something pops out, we’ll definitely grab it and use it.\n\nHT: Do you guys tend to play most of your songs in the same key. So, when you’re thinking about segues, do you have to change the key of the original song or do they tend to stay in the key they were written in?\n\nMB: In the middle of a song, we might start modulating the parts to get to a new song. For instance, to get to G, we might modulate to C and then jump up to the five or something like that. So yeah, we often think about the keys and the tempos, but that said, we’re the Disco Biscuits, we can get from anywhere to anywhere [laughs]. We could probably get from any key and tempo to any other key and tempo. It just might take a couple steps, but we’ll get there.\n\nHT: Obviously, without giving away any big surprises or anything, are there certain songs that are really clicking or things you’re especially excited about for Camp Bisco?\n\nMB: Yeah, it’s like I said to my friend when we were on New Years Run or Mexico or whatever it was, and I said, “What should we play?” He said, “At this point, just play a Disco Biscuits song. Nobody cares, we just want you to play songs. Nobody cares; just play some shows.\n\nSo that’s what it’s like right now. I get to look at the catalog and be like, “Holy crap, we haven’t played any of these songs in six months or seven months.” Everything is game. Nothing is overplayed. That’s ultimately what you have to worry about is what have you been playing too much; what have people seen a lot of; what hasn’t been played? When you don’t play shows, you don’t have to worry about that. That whole thing is out the window. It doesn’t matter, Rainbow Song, Crickets, Basis, it doesn’t matter. We could play Basis or Crickets or we could not, it doesn’t matter. Everything we play is rare right now.\n\nHT: I know a lot of people are kind of asking what the future hold for you guys right now; is this what we could expect to see from the Disco Biscuits, where you really focus on Conspirator and then get together with the Disco Biscuits for some big events and some shorter tours, or do even know at this point?\n\nMB: No, honestly I really don’t know. I have no idea. I wish I could give you some more information on that, but I just don’t know. There is no way of knowing. That’s a question that could never be answered. Life changes so rapidly. You look at what happens with other bands. They have plans to be together and tour all the time, but then someone gets sick, or someone gets arrested, or someone becomes a heroin addict, or someone goes to jail, or somebody dies. No too be super dark, but that’s life. Sometimes it’s futile to put forth the five year plan. Things change so fast. If somebody gets pregnant, somebody gets married, somebody has twins… At the age we’re at, it’s really hard to know.\n\nI can tell you that as far as Conspirator, we’re all on the same page. Everyone wants to tour. Everyone wants to play shows. When everybody is on the same page with the Biscuits, we’ll do that too. It’s bound to happen at some point. That’s why I don’t want to say, “Well, we’ll probably play ten shows a year and Conspirator will tour.” I don’t know [laughs].\n\nI’m open to it all, you know? If the Biscuits are open to a 30 show tour, then let’s go do it. It’s not happening between now and New Years though. That I can tell you for sure.\n\nHT: Just one last question, I know you have a plane to catch in a few minutes, but with respect to HeadCount, is there anything you want to say as the election season gears up.\n\nMB: As part of HeadCount, this is what we made it for. The whole point of the thing is when you come around to four year election cycle. We want to get 100,000 voters registered this year. The funding is starting to come together. You get around those four year cycles and the the funders start to come out of the woodwork a little bit.\n\nFor me, what’s really existing is with the funding, you never know during ‘09, ‘10, ‘11, it gets scary with the voter registration groups when the funding comes once every for years. How do you keep it operating? Right now, we’re starting to see a lot of people coming out to support what we’re doing, and that’s really exciting as the co-founder and co-chair. It gives a bit of justification to all the hard work we’ve put into it. We’re everywhere now. Headcount was in Michigan, in Buffalo, everywhere I go, so it’s fantastic.\n\nBy Ryan Dembinsky (Ryan Demler)\n\nOccasionally, a band puts out a debut album with so much of themselves in it, that it seems impossible to to top, or even match, when the sophomore album rolls around. You see bands come up just short all the time. In their second acts, bands – especially bands with energetic uplifting music – have a tendency to spread their wings, show off their chops and serious up. It’s the dreaded, “We’re going in a different direction” move.\n\nThink about MGMT, The Strokes, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah or the Polyphonic Spree. Bands whose debuts moved people emotionally and got the endorphins flowing, but the follow-ups deviated and ultimately perhaps fell a bit short.\n\nBut for every band that does an about face and changes directions, there’s one that doesn’t. There’s one that brings what they do best to the next level. Think about bands like Passion Pit, LCD Soundsystem or even The National. These feel-good bands knocked it out of the park on their respective sophomore efforts and never looked back.\n\nFang Island falls in that latter camp. Their sophomore full-length, called Major, took what they did on the self-titled full-length debut and took it up a level. The band weaves tight progressive guitar melodies in “major” key frameworks (part of the reason they chose the title) to create highly addictive fanfare music. Fang Island is dude rock at its best. In the era where refined Americana and introspective indie music reign supreme, Fang Island brings the welcome return of music that actually kicks ass.\n\nFang Island’s and guitar player and co-lead songwriter Jason Bartell joined me for a chat about the new record. While you read along, give the new album a listen. I’m willing to bet you’ll be out of your seat by song three.\n\nHidden Track: To kick off, I’d love to get into a little bit about how you guys write your music. I always enjoy how you weave together a lot of guitar melodies, so I was curious how those pieces come together to form the whole. Do you guys usually jam and then pick and choose from the jams or it more composed?\n\nJason Bartell: It’s a bit of both actually, especially now. Around the time we did the last record up until now, Chris and I – who is the other main songwriter; we lived in different cities. Initially, when we started the band, we all lived in Providence and there was a lot more jamming and a lot less individual composing. When we moved to different cities, we had to change the dynamic a little bit, but we always try to keep an element of jamming, even if it’s not the full band.\n\nAt this point, Chris and I have been playing together for around seven years and both learned together – or at least learned the next stage of musicianship together – so we’ve been through a lot musically and have a really solid rapport. So, we try to jam and there’s always something that comes out of that, and it’s definitely the most fun and most intuitive way to come up with riffs or songs. So, it’s always a bit of both, but we try to keep jamming in there as much as we can.\n\nHT: On that note, I was going to ask you this a little later, but you kind of alluded to it already about the full band. We noticed that it’s a three-piece now, what happened to the other two guys?\n\nJB: At the time we were touring the self-titled record, the original bassist had moved to away to Texas with his future wife. So the record was in the bag and we had been signed, so he did a little bit of touring with us before the record came out, but right before it was released was when he moved away. So the guy that toured with us and who was in a lot of the photos, that was my friend Mike who was my roommate at the time.\n\nHe’s this natural, amazing musician and he started touring with us and we were thinking that he was a member and that we’d write the next record with him in mind, but he started a business when we had some down time. It’s really cool. It’s a food truck business. He’s a chef at heart as well as a musician. That’s one of his many passions. It was cool, it was good timing. We decided we’ll just keep it tight in terms of writing.\n\nAt that time, it was a four piece and the other guitarist just sort of quit when we were on tour, before we really went into the studio for real. Without getting into it too much, there’s a lot of contextual stuff that doesn’t necessarily translate if you don’t know all of us personally, but he had joined after Chris and I and the original guys started the band, so he was an additive element originally. This doesn’t really translate to an interview well, but he wasn’t really a chief songwriter. It was hard, but it kind of made it easier in a way. This is sort of what we’d been working toward for seven years is this, almost the purest form of what this band is. It’s really down to the crucial elements. We still want to have the five-piece live sound, and we’ll have some really good friends who are going to tour with us, so it’s looking good right now.\n\nHT: It sounds like you guys have really made progress on the vocals. It that something you’ve been focusing on more?\n\nJB: I think so. We’ve always sort of been moving that way. We had two EPs that we released that haven’t gotten as much attention, but they are like our roots kind of records. From the very beginning we were mostly instrumental except for this one song had a vocal part that was just “whoas” and “oohs.” We wrote it into a part of the song where we didn’t have any music, because we didn’t have any microphones, so it was the only way we could all hear it.\n\nSo, that was how it started and that quickly became the people who came to the shows’ favorite part of the set, and our favorite part of the set. It sort of became the part we were always waiting for, because this burst of interactivity between the audience and us would come out of nowhere and it seemed to really excite people. So, we’ve always been moving this way and each record has more and more vocals.\n\nThe more we toured, the more that feeling came out. Every time someone would sing along or know a lyric, it’s the most exciting part of any show. We’re trying to move toward that a little more and it’s always been the original intention.\n\nHT: I really like the integration of the bluegrass sound on…\n\nJB: Dooney Rock [laughs]? Yeah, I know exactly which one you’re talking about.\n\nHT: Yes [laughs]! Have you been working with bluegrass and other types of music more?\n\nJB: I wouldn’t say bluegrass so much. That was Chris’s song and I don’t think he really listens to bluegrass, but I think it’s inspired more by Irish stuff as well as country. He’s a big country fan. Well, I guess bluegrass and country are similar, I don’t know the exact distinctions. Anyway, he’s more of a twang player, so that was just a riff that he came up with. Just from the reaction that song has been getting, I’d like to explore that more. I think genre aside, that’s just one more sound to infuse into the oeuvre or whatever.\n\nFang Island – Dooney Rock\n\nHT: It’s funny you say that about the reaction, because I just got the record like four days ago and I’ve listened to it about 40 times already. It’s awesome.\n\nJB: [laughs] I think that song is the core of what we do with that bluegrassy, almost silly riff and then turning it into almost like a Ride the Lighting era Metallica song. It’s not something I think many people would think to do. If there is anything on the record that is uniquely us, it’s probably that song.\n\nHT: That’s a good point you made in referencing Metallica that I wanted to ask about. I’ve definitely seen some comments on your references to your influences in other interviews and various places or via cover tunes you’ve done, but I was curious about what kind of more sophisticated, you know, crazy music, epic guitarists, stuff like thhat you grew up with?\n\nJB: I would definitely say Metallica is probably my biggest personal influence. It’s between that and stuff like Smashing Pumpkins and Weezer, more ’90s music. I think when I first started writing, I was actively referencing Metallica over almost any other thing. All of us sort of share the same background and we all grew up around the same time.\n\nSo, there is a pretty diverse ’90s background and some weird things. The ’90s were when weird pop sort of had its day. There are similar backgrounds in the ’90s with a bit of a metal background, but also in that there is complete open mindedness towards some of the weird stuff.\n\nI feel like we cover the Mariah Carey song, and this may be speaking for myself, but we’re genuinely inspired by that song just as we are by And Justice For All. [laughs] If you have an open mind, the world is kind of your oyster in terms of influences, especially nowadays.\n\nHT: When you guys toured with Coheed & Cambria, how did you find their fan base took to you guys and vice versa?\n\nJB: That was interesting time, because we segued from a Matt and Kim tour into a Coheed & Cambria tour. Musically, those are probably two of the more dissimilar bands. So, we were really curious. That was a real experiment for us. It’s hard opening for any band really, because there is always going to be a percentage of people who just out of the gate are not going to care what you’re doing. You could be U2 opening for Coheed & Cambria and some people would still be like, “When is Coheed coming on?”\n\nSo, there’s always that element, which can be exciting and fun too. Playing for new people is always fun. Chris and I definitely both went through a big Coheed & Cambria phase and there are definitely some similarities there.\n\nI think the other thing about trying to draw from as many influences as we can is that hopefully we can keep being painted with the brush of “hard to label.” To me, the best possible genre to belong to is the “indefinable” genre [laughs]. I feel like we could open for a hip hop band and then Matt & Kim and then Coheed & Cambria. All of them have elements that make sense to us, whether its energy-wise or aesthetic-wise. It was fun though. We played some great shows on that run and they were all super nice. Same with Matt & Kim.\n\nFang Island – Always Be My Baby\n\nHT: I just had one last question I wanted to ask, which is pretty general, but I’m sure you have had some good experiences with the reactions that fans give you guys. A lot of people talk about the happiness and the joy of the building anthem sound, and music lovers definitely get super pumped up. So, I was wondering if you have any cool stories of people telling you what your music means to them?\n\nJB: Yeah, that’s one of the greatest things that has come out of being in this band. It’s something we all hoped for when we were starting. We would get those comments from our really close friends, but we had very close relationships with those people. That’s how we started – just playing for our friends, but there was a lot of love there [laughs].\n\nBut then branching out and being lucky enough to play for new people on tour and via the internet and being on a label like Sergeant House who promotes hands on growth and fan base and being about the fans and not the dollar sign, all that combined has been amazing because it promotes these encounters.\n\nEvery once and a while, even if it’s just a Facebook comment or an email, you’ll get one that says “I was going through a really hard time and your music really helped me out.” There’s nothing better than that. Even if one person ever said that remotely earnestly, then that’s our job as a band. That’s why music exists – regardless if it’s optimistic or aggressive – if someone can find something in it when they are going through a hard time, that’s exactly why music exists. Were very lucky to have that even be a possibility.\n\nBy Ryan Dembinsky (Ryan Demler)\n\nWith a debut album entitled The Year of Hibernation and a follow-up entitled Wondrous Bughouse, a blind assumption regarding the artistic direction for Youth Lagoon’s Trevor Powers would probably be accurate. The title, Wondrous Bughouse, certainly suggests a sojourn to the fantastical and that’s very much what happens on the new record. Similarities exist between the two albums, but Wondrous Bughouse is more experimental, more psychedelic, more demanding, and generally weirder. If The Year of Hibernation was Pixar, Wondrous Bughouse is Tim Burton.\n\nIt’s always a question of which way musicians will lean after releasing a widely acclaimed album. The Year of Hibernation was easily palatable yet sophisticated enough to avoid being deemed catchy, but what comes next? Stick with the formula? Reverse course? Thankfully, Wondrous Bughouse pushes the envelope in all the right directions. It’s well-produced; the attention to detail allows the depth to reveal itself in layers and the overall level of accessibility is tastefully reduced. It’s a more mature project that disregards immediate gratification and asks more of its listeners.\n\nHidden Track: Relative to the Year of Hibernation, the new album has a more psychedelic feeling to it. Were there any clever aproaches that you took in the studio to get some of those more experimental ambient sounds?\n\nTrevor Powers: I wanted the music on this record to reflect a feeling of uneasiness. Taking sounds that are foreign but then applying them in ways that still make a bit of sense. A lot of time writing was really spent on exploring the sonics behind everything. Sometimes making music almost feels like some sort of science experiment, only it’s hard to ever feel content with it. There always seems to be more ways to tap into a certain idea. I don’t like recording in traditional ways. I like doing things I’m not necessarily comfortable with because I feel like it bleeds out through the music. It’s strange to look back at a completed work of music because your memory always seems a bit fuzzy about it. Like you concentrate so hard while you are creating that after something is created, you don’t even really know yourself how exactly it was achieved.\n\nHT: I read about some of the stuff you did on the last album like playing the vocals aloud in your friend’s garage and then re-recording them with the reverb of the room. Was there anything interesting like that this time around?\n\nTP: Every process varies depending on what seems appropriate. What I mean is there may be a certain direction you want to take a song, but after a while it seems like it wants to take itself a completely different way.\n\nAnd when it’s telling you that, you have to listen. On this record, there were even spots where I didn’t think I would have any lyrics, and then all of a sudden I felt like they had to be there. So I would go out behind the studio for 20 minutes and write, and then go up to the mic and just sing them. A lot is based around the subconscious. We have these minds that get so carried away with whatever is in the forefront that we forget about everything buried deep within us. And so sometimes I have to approach it in that sort of way, and then just clean things up later. Many of the sounds were made by taking a classic instrument like a guitar or piano, and then running it through equipment to see what could be done with the sonics. Taking something familiar and making it sound completely foreign. And working with Ben Allen on this record made things that much more comfortable. He is such an easy personality to explore music with. It was a very healthy process.\n\nHT: Would you say it was more fun going into the recording process this time around knowing that people were definitely going to hear this record as opposed to last time where you made the record not really knowing what might happen?\n\nTP: It has definitely been more interesting knowing that from now on at least some people would hear what I’m working on. But when writing or recording, I can’t even think about other people listening to it because that never does any good. After the process for this record was finished, I was really just hoping people would spend time with the record. There is a lot to listen to. But I feel like the more people are exposed to it, the more it starts to make sense. It’s interesting the ways that people interpret it.\n\nHT: I’ve read about some of the bands you tend to reference as influences, and it seems like you must be a pretty serious music fan. Have you always been keen on digging up lesser known music?\n\nTP: Yeah, but what is interesting to me is that even though certain artists may not have a large following, the listeners they do have are often devoted for life. Some popular artists obviously have life-timers too and especially influence mainstream art and culture. But with many artists of today, it’s like would you rather have 50 million fans who will play your songs while they are drunk at a party and who enjoy it because “it has a good beat” or 1,000 fans who not only listen to your music but study it and get lost in it? The artists that have 1,000 fans like that often seem to carry more weight on a personal level.\n\nHT: What lyrical material are you most proud of on this album?\n\nTP: That’s hard to say. The lyrics on Daisyphobia, are few, but really close to my heart.\n\nBy Ryan Dembinsky (Ryan Demler)\n\nTo start off the interview with Joey Ryan of the Milk Carton Kids, I did something that’s probably considered a bit of a no-no on a more traditional media outlet. I told him a personal story and said, “thanks,” because the Milk Carton Kids latest album The Ash & Clay has literally made my life easier. I kid you not, anytime I play the album, my toddler son drops his head on my shoulder and falls asleep. It’s usually within one song, but at the most three or four. It’s a total daily ritual, and it almost never fails.\n\nThat’s the vibe of the album; it’s totally relaxing. But that’s not to say it is a sleepy record. On the contrary, it’s a captivating record. That’s why it’s so relaxing – with the dueling vocals and acoustic guitars playing off each other in harmony.\n\nThe list of great complete albums that can serve as wind-down music is very short, and it’s especially rare to find a wind-down album that might actually have your favorite song on it. Cat Stevens and Nick Drake could do it without really trying. Roger Waters has done it. Carl Broemel just did it. Billy Breathes? Maybe a couple of Dylan albums? I’m sure there are more, but The Ash & Clay is right up there with the greats in this category.\n\nTalking on the phone from “The shadiest Tennessee gas station ever, where a guy is ashing his cigarette on the ‘No Smoking’ sign’”, Joey Ryan checked in to discuss the quiet nature of the album, where they fit in amongst the folk/bluegrass revival, and a truly touching story of the anonymous fan who gave him his Gibson J-45.\n\nHT: So, the mellowness of it all, is that by design or was it just the result of how you guys play together?\n\nJR: I think it’s something that we’re drawn to and it’s also a by-product of just the instrumentation that we’ve chosen. It’s hard to do anything else I guess with just two guitars and two voices. But you know, we’re both drawn to music that is beautiful in some ways. The way that it comes out of us is like you said, mellow, but it’s not really something we’re striving for.\n\nHT: Another thing I wanted to ask about is your bluegrass influences. I know everybody tends to file you guys in the folk camp, but it seems like you take a lot from bluegrass as well. Do you have any major influences or favorites in that world?\n\nJR: My exposure to that world is only recent in the past few years, but we have and we do take from it. There’s an aesthetic about it that we are enamored with, and we allow it to creep into our writing and playing. For me, the thing that resonates the most is the duo record that Ricky Skaggs and Tony Rice made. That one to me stretches the limits of what you can do as a duo with two instruments and two voices. That’s actually a strong musical touchstone for me personally.\n\nWe didn’t come up in that traditional bluegrass scene though. There’s a respect and a tradition, and we don’t have that history of upbringing. We’re fascinated with it, but in a sense we’d feel like outsiders there.\n\nHT: In terms of the speed of the band’s growth, does this feel like the right natural progress for you guys. Obviously it’s exciting, but is it getting intimidating or anything at this point?\n\nJR: I think it’s just right. We’re also wary of growth that comes too quickly or growth from a single source like a song on the radio, a song on a television show, or in a film. We’ve got friends who’ve experienced that and can fill up much bigger rooms than we can, but many times half of those people are there waiting for the one song they know from the television show or commercial. We’ve not had that, so it’s all just right. Even as the crowds grow, it seems like the audience is all there for the right reasons, or at least the reasons we would want them to be there for, which feels good.\n\nHT: Is there a certain demographic that you’re seeing or is it a pretty broad mix?\n\nJR: It’s incredibly broad. I would even imagine it could be kind of weird for the audience members. There was a girl who wrote to us about our show in Nashville that said by the time it started, nobody else could get in. She wrote to us, “While I was waiting in line, it looked like a bunch of old people who had heard us on NPR were coming in with tickets that bought way in advance after Prairie Home Companion.”\n\nI think it’s probably kind of weird to show up as an 18 year old and see a bunch of people who look like they would be friends with your parents. It is pretty neat to get such a broad mix of people at our shows though.\n\nHT: I wanted to ask you a bit about your guitar. I read a story that mentioned that a fan gave you the guitar you always play, so I was wondering if you would mind telling the rest of that story.\n\nJR: Yeah, that was actually a really fascinating act of altruism. A lot of fans – and we appreciate this too – want to be involved in some way and feel a part of things, which is just great, but the woman who bought me this guitar, she would come to my shows, but never say ‘hi’. She would buy the albums, but instead of buying them at the shows, she would always buy them on the internet. So, she always kept her distance.\n\nThen, one day she wrote and asked me what would be my dream guitar. I actually just thought she wanted to start some sort of a conversation, but I told that my dream guitar was the Gibson J-45. So she wrote back a couple days later with a link to an eBay auction, and said “Like this one?”\n\nIt was a beautiful guitar, so I said, “Yeah, just like that one.” But then I looked at the auction and I saw that her name was already listed as the winner of the auction. So I said, “Wow, you bought this? Congratulations, what a beautiful guitar. I’m sure you’ll enjoy it!”\n\nThen she writes back, “You’re going to have to send me your address, because I didn’t buy it for me. I bought it to send to you.”\n\nAnd that was it. I still don’t really know what to make of it. I hope that she’s still out there following along, but we’ve still never met. And it’s still my only guitar.\n\nHT: How did the Gus Van Zandt connection occur with you guys being included on the soundtrack for Promised Land?\n\nJR: He saw us play. Anything good that has ever happened to us has been because somebody saw a show. This one included. We were opening for KD Lang and the tour went through Portland. So, he was at the show, because he’s friends with KD and we talked to him after the show for like an hour, but we talked about everything besides our music and his movies. It was really nice. It was a wonderful conversation.\n\nAt the end of it, he said I’m working on a film that I think you’d be perfect for. Would you mind if I called you in a few months? So, we said “Yeah! No! We don’t mind!”\n\nSo, a few months went by after we had forgotten about it and we never really heard anything, but then one day he calls Kenneth’s cell phone. We don’t even know how he got it, but he got it. He said, “We’ve tried everything from your first two albums, but nothing seems to work. Have you got anything that is unreleased?”\n\nSo we said, “Why don’t we do you one better? We’ll come into the studio, and we’ll bring everything we’ve got, but we can also take a crack at writing something for you?”\n\nWe went for three or four hours to the studio with him watching parts of the film and figuring out what is was he was after. The beautiful part of it was that his instinct was that our collective voice, and the sound that was just coming out naturally, was really what would work best for his film.\n\nThe assignment was just “Write whatever you want, and send it in”. That’s how those three songs ended up in the film. The one song we wrote that actually makes mention of the film title, the song called Promised Land – which is on our record – was the one he didn’t want. He thought it sounded like it was written for the film.\n\nSo, people always say, “What’s it like to write songs for a film?” And I have to answer, “I still don’t know.”\n\nHT: Finally, I wanted to talk a bit about the song Heaven, which is one of my favorites on the new album. I wondered how that one came about and where you got the idea and so on.\n\nJR: What is your impression of it? I’m curious to know before I delve into it.\n\nHT: Hmmm, I don’t know. I haven’t gotten a chance to see you guys live yet, but it strikes me as the “shitkicker”, get the crowd riled up live tune. It comes near the end of the record after being at this relaxed level for quite a while, and then it kind of kicks up a bit.\n\nJR: Well, it definitely fills that role, but the “shitkickerness” is completely ironic in my opinion. The song is actually a slight against “shitkicking” kick drum stomping folk music. I like to envision to the crowd actually talking the instruction to clap their hands and stomp their feet, only to realize a few lines later that we are making fun of people who make music for that purpose.\n\nI don’t want to say too much, but our thing is so deliberately quiet and insular that it makes us feel like the perennial underdogs in a lot of ways due to the current aesthetic currently being called – mistakenly in my opinion – folk music. So, that one is a bit of a commentary about the groupings that we find ourselves being put into by people who listen to or especially write about our music.\n\nBy Ryan Dembinsky (Ryan Demler)\n\nAs a promising 16 year-old pianist attending music school on Saturdays at London’s Royal College of Music, Jon Hopkins made a decision that would ultimately change his life. He entered a concerto competition playing Ravel’s Piano Concerto in G with an orchestra. He loved the piece of music and he actually won the competition, so seemingly this would help propel his interests in classical piano. Instead, he found the experience horrifying and never played another completion.\n\nLeading up to the performance, Hopkins explained, “I started thinking, ‘Do I really have to do this?’ It was a very large concert, so when it came to the actual day, the levels of nerves, I had just never experienced anything like it. It didn’t seem necessary to feel like that ever in your life. The performance went really well, but there was a point in it where I remember an incredibly fast section in the third movement. Mind you, at this point you don’t have music; you’ve learned it all weeks before. My fingers were so used to it playing it, but I remember just looking at them and thinking, ‘How are they doing that?’ The second you do that, they could stop at any second. I managed to stop thinking that just long enough to get through it.”\n\nHe continued, “Afterwards, I was just so spaced out. I thought, ‘That’s it; I don’t think I can do that again.’ I don’t think it’s healthy, and I also don’t think it’s natural. Classical music wasn’t written to be played in this austere environment. It was the popular music of its time. It was meant to be enjoyed. This rarefied elitist thing that it is now was never the intention. Also, I’d rather just play my own music rather than reinterpreting something that was written 100 years ago.”\n\nThe rest is history. Jon Hopkins has since moved on to focus entirely on electronic music. He’s collaborated with Brian Eno and Coldplay, scored multiple films and recorded a catalog of four LPs, four EPs and a long list of collaborative recordings. His latest album Immunity came out in March and represents his first true dance record. We caught up with Jon Hopkins for a chat over a drink in Williamsburg the day after his latest performance at Irving Plaza.\n\nHidden Track: I wanted to start off with a somewhat general question. I tend to think your music as somewhat minimal in a sense in that there is a sort of patience that you have in having one loop going and very gradually building with subtle changes. How did you gain the confidence to trust that would be entertaining enough?\n\nJon Hopkins: That’s a good question. Maybe it isn’t [the music], I don’t know [laughs]? There are a lot of albums that I love that have shown me that it’s possible. Firstly, I love the effect that has on the brain. I love the fact that brazenly repeating something for eight minutes, if it’s an interesting enough thing in the first place, is an amazing chance to let the brain get used to something and really live in it. Then when it changes, it can blow people’s minds – if you’re dancing especially. It can be an amazing experience. That’s exactly what I’m trying to do. I’m not saying I necessarily do it, but that’s definitely the aim.\n\nHT: Dancing is obviously a big part of it. It seems like you are pretty savvy with different time signatures and things. How do you think about that type of thing in a dance context?\n\nJH: Yeah, I love all that stuff. I did the weird time signature thing more in the past, but his album is essentially all 4/4. What I tried to do with this record is keep the kick drums on the the fours mostly, and push and pull around that. So some of the tracks have got really big swings to them. You can get a real electronic vibe, but also with a human feel around that central pulse as the overall propulsion of the track but meanwhile always trying to keep that human element that makes it feel “unmachine-like” and less forced.\n\nI try to make things addictive to listen to which goes back to your first question, you won’t want to stop listening to it. If you make a rhythm that’s addictive enough, it will carry you through a long track.\n\nHT: It was cool what you did with the video how you kind of had the skateboarder do that same thing, which is just cruising along in really long shots in a parallel fashion to the music.\n\nJH: What was cool about that is that it’s not a complex piece of music to listen to. It’s quite complex to make, but it’s really a simple thing to hear it.\n\nSo, I just couldn’t figure out what it should be. A lot of treatments came in, and I was into a lot of them, but I couldn’t quite figure out what it should be. Then at the last minute, this treatment came in and (filmmaker) Aoife McArdle said, “You should just cut together a montage of people skateboarding,” and it even includes Back to the Future which is at the end. The song is about motion, left to right motion, so those long tracking shots and the skies of LA sunshine really clicked immediately.\n\nHT: Is it fair to say the new album is a move back to true dance music?\n\nJH: It’s not exactly a move back, because I’ve actually never fully done it before, bit it’s inspired by playing live for Insides, the last album, when I realized that I wanted to really learn what makes music work in a live environment. It’s really about that rhythmic pulse. So, I wanted to explore that more on this album. Each album has to have some step forward of in another direction, and for this record it was time to explore that dance side.\n\nHT: Does the audience react noticeably different?\n\nJH: Yes! They are much more excited [laughs]. The live set is in the early stages, but it’s going to get a lot better. It’s working at the moment, but I need to work on it to really get the most out of those songs?\n\nHT: How has your rig changed for the live setting?\n\nJH: It hasn’t really changed other than the changes that are internal within the programs. I’m still using the same setup and the KAOSS pads, but the sounds are different. It will sound different. The main thing live is that you feel confident and you feel happy up there, because the second you have to start concentrating too much on the screen or you start over-thinking about the fact that a loop is going to run out in a minute or you might drop the ball in some other way, the audience knows. They don’t know that they know, but they know. They know that the performer isn’t relaxed and that something isn’t right. That’s why I prefer to keep things simple, so I can remain happy up there.\n\nHT: I read in some other interviews that people often assume you are one of these people who is really into the latest technology, but you highlight that you really emphasize using what you know not what’s the latest and greatest new thing.\n\nJH: Exactly, I still use programs from 1999 on my PC, which is now essentially the PC I have virtually inside my Mac. I just listen for what I like to hear and try to use what I know. I think technology is actually a distraction, especially if you’re always learning now things. The latest things I’ve bought have actually been secondhand things from the 70s and 80s.\n\nHT: What is the old software that you still use on the PC?\n\nJH: Sound Forge on PC, a really old Cubase VST version, and lots of really old plugins you can’t get anymore. I also still use a Korg Trinity that I got in 1998, which is great because I know how to make any sound I want on it. That’s the thing that’s been on all my records that people would recognize as my sound.\n\nHT: I wanted to to ask you about the opening track on the new album, We Disappear. How did you get those sounds?\n\nJH: That was the hardest track to finish. The first track on a record should be the hardest to finish or the freshest, newest track. The whole track to me is an intro to the album. It would never be a single or something like that. It’s just about excitement and anticipation for what is going to come next. It’s all about energy. I wanted to make it sound like it crackling with energy and forward motion. The beats are all made organically in that one. I don’t think there is anything electronic at all there.\n\nIt’s basically hitting a table with a stick and things like that. I remember the original rhythm, I recorded it on my phone by tapping a pen on a table and that Dictaphone recording is actually still in the track. The synth sounds were made by turning the resonance on a filter up and getting a sine wave type sound and bouncing it across the keyboard. The bass is analog synth and there’s a hell of a lot of fiddling around in the rest of it.\n\nHT: In terms of your fanbase, do you find any consistent type of person? It seems like an interesting dynamic.\n\nJH: I don’t even really think of myself as having a fanbase [laughs], but I guess there are a few people out there. I really don’t know. It seems to be half and half men and women, which is great. Certain types of electronic music tend to get a lot of ‘bros’ and I really don’t want that . That’s the last thing I’d want [laughs]. The fans tend to be very serious about it, which is great. They tend to be committed to coming to the shows, which is so great.\n\nHT: Finally, I know touring is the big thing for now, but what do you have lined up for the future?\n\nJH: I’ve done two film scores over the past year, and those will be coming out soon. What I really want to do is put everything else to one side, and really develop this album and create a big audio visual part. I want to push this album as far I can push it.\n\nBy Ryan Dembinsky (Ryan Demler)\n\nLong before he cut his chops as a guitarist at the Manhattan School of Jazz or formed the seminal 1990s improvisational rock band God Street Wine, guitarist Lo Faber was a born and bred country and bluegrass music kid. In a nearly-hour-long chat discussing his solo album under the moniker Doctor Lo, Bottomland, he explained:\n\n“I grew up in Jersey and when I was a kid, it was still rural. Today, it’s all subdivisions, but back then it was all dairy farms. My mom played in a hippie bluegrass band called the Millstone Valley Boys. She played mandolin and I started on banjo at age 8 on an instrument that their bassist made for me. All I played was bluegrass stuff, gospel and folk music like Joan Baez, John Prine, Tom Paxton and early Dylan – not electric, just the folk stuff.”\n\nBottomland represents a sharp return to these folk roots with a striking set of highly personal Americana songs that conjure up virtually no God Street Wine comparisons. It’s a totally unexpected sound for anyone who knows Lo Faber solely from God Street Wine – and it’s something he expressed a sense of nervousness about with respect to how fans will receive the change, but that’s downright silly. Bottomland is a terrific album, adorned with all the trademark instrumental prowess, but it comes in a new format; played with different instruments; and complemented with dramatically improved singing.\n\n“When I was teenager,” Lo continued, “I got my first electric guitar and started listening to The Beatles, Stones and the Dead. So, I got out of playing bluegrass at some point, but I always had it in me. I went to Manhattan School of Jazz, which was great for my learning and my chops, but I could never get the country out of my playing. You do these jury performances when you go to jazz school where you play in front of the faculty and it’s nerve-wracking and awkward and artificial. One of the comments from the jury was, ‘Faber has been unable to eliminate country from his guitar playing.’ And I felt so bad about that. I was thinking, ‘Shit, I really cannot get this country inflection out.’ Now that I’m 50-years-old, I’ve finally decided to just be OK with it and embrace the country.”\n\nThe thought of one of the forefathers of the 90s jam scene in this environment is reminiscent of Miles Teller’s character from the film Whiplash, but was Faber a star student? Did he feel the same kind of pressures portrayed in the movie?\n\n“A lot of us who went to jazz school think that movie is kind of silly because they take it too far,” Lo said. “It isn’t that bloodthirsty. It can be a little bit like that, but that movie was totally over the top. It does have that aspect to it though: the athleticism and the competition. I met [GSW guitarist] Aaron [Maxwell] there though, and that completely changed my life. We were both just two out of about 20 guitar players, and they were all really good. It was intimidating. Aaron’s father was a jazz trumpet player, so he had more of a jazz background and probably felt more comfortable than I did.”\n\nThe point in Faber’s musical development when he started realizing maybe he was getting distinctly good at guitar came earlier.\n\n“When I was 13 I started taking guitar lessons with this teacher and he had about 20 students who were also fellow students at my school,” Faber said. “I knew what they were working on and I knew what I was working on, so I knew that I advanced pretty far compared to them. I also realized that whenever my teacher needed to do a showcase or have a student perform, he always chose me. So, I thought, ‘Hey, I think I’ve found something I can do well,’ which is a great feeling as a kid. I loved baseball as a kid too, but I was too little and I wasn’t ever going to be good at it, so I stuck to playing music and listening to records.”\n\nBottomland & Jitters Of A New Sound\n\nThe material that comprises Bottomland came about as Lo was writing new material during the recording of last year’s God Street Wine record. He came up with what he felt were extremely strong new tunes, yet felt like the material was not in a style to which longtime GSW fans would necessarily relate. Frankly, he thought the GSW audience would find it potentially too weird and coming out of left field. It seems crazy to hear given the new material is practically universally likable, but some of this trepidation seems to date back to an experience the band encountered after the release of Red years ago.\n\n“The audience that exists for God Street Wine today is an older audience,” Faber explained. “They want to hear God Street Wine play God Street Wine – music like what they are used to hearing. I don’t know for sure, but we had an experience in 1995 where we put out an album called Red, that was stylistically – for a lot of fans – so different that we ended up alienating a lot of them. The record before that is the album that all our fans love, $1.99 Romances, and we just wanted to try something different. We didn’t take into account people’s expectations enough. We assumed that they all love us, and they will all go along with whatever we do, but that turned out to be a conceited amateur band mistake.\n\n“It’s not a mistake to be true to yourself musically. But if you’re lucky enough to have an audience, you have to figure out a way to meet them halfway. We weren’t even very diplomatic about it. So, I learned a lesson from that, which is that you can’t always just count on people for their unconditional support. They have a lot of other things vying for their attention. You need to find something new, but something that stays true to why they liked you in the first place.”\n\nThat experience seems to have consciously or subconsciously informed the desire to take this material under the new Doctor Lo moniker. He decided early on that it was going to be a solo album and that he would be working simultaneously on a God Street Wine project. For that reason, it took place slowly at first. During this time, he was still teaching full-time and working on the two recording projects parallel to one another. The God Street project eventually took priority because they had a batch of tour dates over the summer after releasing the GSW album This Fine Town in June. Meanwhile, Faber opted to take his time on Bottomland, figuring rightly that this was his first solo album in 16 years: what’s the rush if he takes a couple more months?\n\nDiscussing the origins of the material, Faber indicated Bottomland marked a bit of a shift toward more personal experiences.\n\n“The material all comes from my adult years,” Lo said. “The oldest song is called “Perfect,” which was written in 2014 the day my son got kicked out of first grade, but most of it is more recent. Everything was recorded at my house, mostly in my bedroom. I recorded most of it in the early morning hours. I would drop my kids off by 8 a.m. and have to be at work by about 11 a.m. for teaching, so I would record every morning between about 8 and 10 in the morning.\n\n“These songs are all very close to me. These are all very personal songs about my life, my family, my marriage, middle age and my relationships. That stuff is all part of the country genre as well. These are songs about real life and that is not an easy thing to do. You walk such a fine line with these kinds of songs. Some people might find it very corny, while some people might find them very touching. You get older and you live life and you start to want to write more about what you’ve learned about life and your experiences. When you’re 22 and you write a song, what the hell do you know about life? Nothing. The goofy songs I wrote with God Street early on were not about life. They were just about weird, goofy shit that was in my head back in those days.”\n\nIn terms of a favorite song on the record, Faber has a soft spot for “33.” It’s the one about Rolling Rock beer. There are a lot of people now who hate Rolling Rock and who don’t think it is a good beer, but back in the day in the 90s when GSW started playing clubs, they would always get a case of Rolling Rock backstage. It was just the band’s beer for some reason. They don’t even really remember why. On the back of the bottle, it says, “From the glass-lined tanks of Old Latrobe, we tender this premium beer for your enjoyment as a tribute to your good taste. It comes from the mountain springs to you ‘33’.”\n\n“I would always look at that and say, ‘One day I’m going to write a song with these words as a chorus’,” Faber said. “I think of Rolling Rock as an old white man’s beer, so the song is about an old white man who is a history professor and what he learned as a history professor. It’s the day after a bunch of history professors went out after they finished grading all their history papers and got shitfaced at a bar on Rolling Rock. It’s about how I love these people who do a hard job and don’t get paid much for it. It’s about some of the experiences I had "
