        "text": "From the time I saw Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers in a package with Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead in the summer of 1986, I was hooked. Tom Petty became a constant musical companion. While in university, I wrote so many essays while listening to his albums that he should receive an Honorary Bachelor of Arts degree from Wilfrid Laurier University. One particular album that resonated with me was the live offering ‘Pack Up the Plantation: Live’. As a listener, this recording served to capture the energy of the band’s early to mid ‘80s tours. It presented a cross section of the first decade of Tom Petty’s career, and true to his style, homage was paid to the artists that inspired both him and his Heartbreakers brethren. Today’s feature is the album’s closing track ‘Stories We Could Tell’. The reflective quality of this song grabbed me from the first time I heard it, and as music so often does, it left me wanting to learn more. So, today’s version of Ted Tocks Covers will briefly tell the story behind not only this song, but it will speak to an ongoing story in my life.\n\nToday is our 30th Anniversary.\n\nBefore Heather and I got married, and long before we had children, we would head down to upstate New York to do some Christmas shopping. Part of our mission was a self-imposed challenge to find the cheapest motel. Why would we spend our hard-earned money on a place to sleep? We are simple folk. All we needed was a bed and a washroom. We found the perfect shelter in the form of Junior’s Truck Stop in Niagara Falls, New York. From about 1988 to 1990, a one-night stay did not exceed $20. Across the parking lot was a greasy spoon diner which served up a quality array of burgers, fries and onion rings. A gregarious waitress who resembled Flo from the TV sitcom ‘Alice’, provided running commentary related to the Arsenio Hall Show which was showing on the TV screen behind the counter. She was infatuated that we came ‘all the way from Canada’. We accepted her adulation with typical Canadian humility, because we didn’t think our one-hour trek was a monumental journey. We had everything we needed, and it was a straight shot to the nearby outlet mall.\n\nEvery time I hear these lyrics, I think of Junior’s Truck Stop and the hilarious side stories related to our shopping expeditions. There are many. Way too many to get into during this post but read on for some further background.\n\nTalkin’ to myself again\n\nAnd wondrin’ if this travelling is good\n\nIs there somethin’ else a-doin’\n\nWe’d be doin’ if we could\n\nBut oh, the stories we could tell\n\nAnd if it all blows up and goes to hell\n\nI can still see us sittin’ on a bed in some hotel\n\nSingin’ all the stories we could tell\n\nRemember that guitar in a museum in Tennessee\n\nThe nameplate on the glass brought back twenty melodies\n\nAnd the scratches on the face told of all the times he fell\n\nSingin’ all the stories he could tell\n\nAnd oh, the stories it could tell\n\nAnd I’ll bet you it still rings like a bell\n\nAnd I wish that we could sit back on a bed in some hotel\n\nAnd listen to the stories it could tell\n\nSo if you’re on the road a-trackin’ down your every night\n\nAnd singin’ for a livin’ neath the brightly colored lights\n\nAnd if you ever wonder why you ride the carousel\n\nYou did it for the stories you could tell\n\nAnd oh, the stories we could tell\n\nAnd before we have to say our last farewell\n\nWell, I wish that we could sit back on a bed in some hotel\n\nAnd listen to the stories we could tell\n\nYes, I wish that we could sit back on a bed in some hotel\n\nAnd listen to the stories we could tell.”\n\nJohn Sebastian\n\nLong before Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers recorded ‘Stories We Could Tell’ at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, England, the song was written by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame singer/songwriter John Sebastian. Most folksingers grew up elsewhere before migrating to the Greenwich Village, New York music scene of the early to mid ‘60s, but John Sebastian was actually born and partially raised there. It was home. His early inspirations included Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie as well as a touch of the blues with Mississippi John Hurt, Sonny Terry and Lightning Hopkins. The blues connections provided the foundation that saw Sebastian become a highly regarded harmonica player. In 1964 John Sebastian and his Canadian friend Zal Yanovsky created a short-lived band known as The Mugwumps with Yanovsky’s compatriot Denny Doherty and Cass Elliot. The two duos that comprised this act would split in order to form the Lovin’ Spoonful and the Mamas and the Papas respectively. By the time their only album was released in 1967 the Mugwumps had disbanded. The song ‘Creeque Alley’ by the ‘Mamas and the Papas is an autobiographical account of this period of their careers.\n\nHere are the lyrics that tell the story.\n\nJohn and Mitchy were gettin’ kind of itchy\n\nJust to leave the folk music behind\n\nZal and Denny workin’ for a penny\n\nTryin’ to get a fish on the line\n\nIn a coffee house Sebastian sat\n\nAnd after every number they’d pass the hat\n\nMcGuinn and McGuire just a gettin’ higher\n\nIn L.A., you know where that’s at\n\nAnd no one’s gettin’ fat except Mama Cass\n\nZally said Denny, you know there aren’t many\n\nWho can sing a song the way that you do, let’s go south\n\nDenny said Zally, golly, don’t you think that I wish\n\nI could play guitar like you\n\nZal, Denny and Sebastian sat (at the Night Owl)\n\nAnd after every number they’d pass the hat\n\nMcGuinn and McGuire still a gettin’ higher\n\nIn L.A., you know where that’s at\n\nAnd no one’s gettin’ fat except Mama Cass\n\nWhen Cass was a sophomore, planned to go to Swarthmore\n\nBut she changed her mind one day\n\nStandin’ on the turnpike, thumb out to hitchhike\n\nTake me to New York right away\n\nWhen Denny met Cass he gave her love bumps\n\nCalled John and Zal and that was the Mugwumps\n\nMcGuinn and McGuire couldn’t get no higher\n\nBut that’s what they were aimin’ at\n\nAnd no one’s gettin’ fat except Mama Cass\n\nMugwumps, high jumps, low slumps, big bumps\n\nDon’t you work as hard as you play\n\nMake up, break up, everything is shake up\n\nGuess it had to be that way\n\nSebastian and Zal formed the Spoonful\n\nMichelle, John, and Denny gettin’ very tuneful\n\nMcGuinn and McGuire just a catchin’ fire\n\nIn L.A., you know where that’s at\n\nAnd everybody’s gettin’ fat except Mama Cass\n\nDi di di dit dit dit di di di dit, whoa\n\nBroke, busted, disgusted, agents can’t be trusted\n\nAnd Mitchy wants to go to the sea\n\nCass can’t make it, she says we’ll have to fake it\n\nWe knew she’d come eventually\n\nGreasin’ on American Express cards\n\nIt’s low rent, but keeping out the heat’s hard\n\nDuffy’s good vibrations and our imaginations\n\nCan’t go on indefinitely\n\nAnd California dreamin’ is becomin’ a reality.”\n\nJohn Phillips and Michelle Phillips\n\nJohn Sebastian’s time with the Lovin’ Spoonful yielded several hits including ‘Summer in the City’. They were a prime example of the American music scene’s response to the British Invasion. Sadly, their success was relatively brief due to a series of internal issues. From this point Sebastian moved on to a solo career which included his famous impromptu set at Woodstock. The legend behind this performance has grown through the years. Briefly, John Sebastian showed up at Woodstock as a spectator, but he was asked by Woodstock emcee Chip Monck to play a short acoustic set after a thunderstorm rolled through and flooded the makeshift stage. He borrowed a guitar from Tim Hardin and took the stage. While organizers swept the water off the stage Sebastian performed five songs, including the Lovin’ Spoonful’s hit ‘Darling Be Home Soon’ and ‘Younger Generation’ which he famously dedicated to a baby that was born during the festival.\n\nHere is John Sebastian’s stage banter from all those years ago.\n\nI’d like you to hear a tune about… I guess about those discussions I was talkin’ about that I seem to have had in so many small circles of friends around living rooms, around pipes when they weren’t sellin’ no papers on the street and we weren’t walkin’ around this beautiful green place, smokin’ and, uh, not bein’ afraid. This is about… all of us. I love you people.”\n\nJohn Sebastian\n\nIt appears he was caught up in a moment and to our great fortune it was captured on tape to be shared forever. Just one of many stories that can be told.\n\nIn the late ‘60s and early part of the ‘70s, John Sebastian wrote several songs and recorded a series of four solo albums between 1970 and 1974. During this time, he was a mainstay as a session player for many renowned artists of the day including a famous harmonica part on the Doors ‘Roadhouse Blues’. Several efforts to create new bands went unfulfilled due to varying circumstances but he was on the periphery of acts such as Crosby Stills and Nash, Little Feat and The Everly Brothers just to name a few.\n\nSebastian would hit paydirt again, with an unexpected hit buoyed by the popular sitcom ‘Welcome Back Kotter’. Here is ‘Welcome Back’.\n\nIt is here that we will get off at today’s feature song ‘Stories We Could Tell’. The song’s initial release was indeed by the storied brother act, the Everly Brothers, in their 1972 release of the same name. The John Sebastian penned song became the closing track on the album which aimed to present The Everly Brothers as a relevant act again. The album was produced by former Doors producer, Paul Rothchild which speaks to Sebastian’s ever flowing connection within the music industry. Unfortunately, ‘Stories We Could Tell’ met with mixed reviews, but the recording does offer a taste of the Everly’s signature style.\n\nJohn Sebastian released his own version of the song in 1974 and it was subsequently shared as part of a greatest hits package known as ‘The Best of John Sebastian’ in 2017.\n\nOn several occasions Jimmy Buffett has been known to record cool cover versions of many great songs, and today’s feature is no exception. This is from his 1974 album ‘A1A’ on Geffen Records.\n\nBefore I conclude with my own story here is a fantastic version of ‘Stories We Could Tell’ featuring John Sebastian and his friend Arlen Roth. That’s Maria Muldaur sharing the vocals.\n\nIf you want to read an impressive resume of musical contributions and collaborations have a look at Arlen Roth’s bio page.\n\nTo come full circle, here is where ‘Stories We Could Tell’ becomes my story. Let me begin by saying as much as I love the many versions that I have shared, it all comes back to the Tom Petty cover for me. It’s as much about Tom Petty’s delivery and Bobby Valentino’s violin work as it is about the sentimentality the song portrays. Hats off to Mike Campbell for his always stellar guitar work and to Stan Lynch for his backing vocals.\n\nOn this day, 30 years ago Heather and I began our married life together. A frigid New Year’s Eve in 1991. We wanted to make our wedding an event. Not only would it signify a new beginning, but it would be a party. By the time it was all shut down in the early hours of New Year’s Day 1992, as a result of a dash of public drunkenness and a flash of partial nudity; a shout out to the two Scotts, who began to disrobe to the familiar strains of ‘Stayin’ Alive’ by the Bee Gees, it seemed our goal had been achieved.\n\nEarlier in the evening, shortly after my sister-in-law Darlene declared in the closing line of her poetic toast to Heather,\n\nWhat are you sitting around for, it’s time to party.”\n\nDarlene – Toast to the Bride\n\nThings were on their way. The dance began with ‘Love’ by John Lennon followed by ‘Songbird’ by Fleetwood Mac.\n\nDuring our wedding planning process, we met with a DJ who agreed to allow for some input from yours truly as to the setlist for the dance. Admittedly, I went a little crazy. Part of my list of instructions was to emerge from the traditional slow dance portion of the evening with ‘Stories We Could Tell’ from ‘Pack Up the Plantation: Live’. At some point Heather suggested that the DJ may also know a thing or two about music so perhaps I could just let him coordinate the evening’s set list. Up to that point I had not considered this possibility, but of course she was right. I took my chances and miracle of miracles; the DJ did deliver. It was a great night.\n\nTwo days later, we found ourselves in Bethel, New York. When we left on our honeymoon, we had no specific destination. We just drove. After crossing the border and spending the night in Buffalo we decided to head toward New York City. As we headed southeast, we realized we were in proximity to the site of Woodstock. Somewhere in our volumes of photos there is a shot of Heather next to the monument that lists the many great band’s who performed during the immortal three-day festival. The view from the hill looks down on where John Sebastian regaled the crowd of 500,000 people.\n\nMost people who get married on New Year’s Eve would head somewhere tropical. Not us. As previously mentioned, we are not extravagant people. Keep it real and spontaneous. Let it be said here that we had a ton of fun. Adventures at every turn. Memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nThirty years later we are still writing our story. It includes three sons, the first named Sebastian (1993), then Jeremy (1996) and Nathaniel (2000). They exist as chapters unto themselves. Ours is a home often filled with music. Each song represents a piece of who we are, and in some cases, they tell the story of where we were.\n\nSittin’ on a bed in some hotel\n\nSingin’ all the stories we could tell.”\n\nJohn Sebastian\n\nSometimes I long to go back there. Other times I am just happy to recall the memories and know it is just part our ongoing story.\n\nThree decades later they still ring like a bell.\n\nHappy Anniversary Heather!\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered why we ride this carousel; we do it for the stories we can tell. Just know that for every part I exist as maddening, I love you ten times more.\n\nILY!"
