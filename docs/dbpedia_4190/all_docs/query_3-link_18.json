A horse thief were I For that I must die In cold gaol I lie with my highland blues My highland blues On mountainside The cold wind does chide For home I ride and my highland blues My highland blues Highland blues, highland blues Oh highland blues hidden in a song For king I fight A man I despise His hatred and lies and my highland blues My highland, highland blues Sweet bonnie gal Wait for me shall\n\n5.\n\nKeep It To Myself 03:31\n\nYou know that I can see pretty clearly I just never care to look I'm gonna take some notes and maybe I will try to write a book Or get myself some pots and pans and then I'll teach myself to cook And I'll be gone, yes I'm gone And I'll keep it to myself Why would I want to tell anybody else I'll put it up on the top shelf and I'll keep it to myself Yeah I'll keep it to myself I'll keep it to myself Yeah I'll keep it to myself I could shout it from the roof tops maybe I could write it in the sky Or get myself a judge and a jury and I'll stand up and I'll testify Or put on my traveling' shoes and then wave everyone goodbye And I'll be gone, yes I'm gone And I'll keep it to myself Why would I etc.\n\n6.\n\nMississippi John Hurt 03:27\n\nPut on your new hat Put on your new spats We're gonna see a gent He really is a gent Lift up your hat cos Mississippi John Hurt's in town He came all the way from Avalon Left a pretty girl in Avalon He ain't gonna be here long So we really oughta get along Lift up your hat cos Mississippi John Hurt's in town Well you know he's gonna pick some With his fingers and his thumb With a voice that is cool and clear Sweetest voice that you'll ever hear Lift up your hats boys cos Mississippi John Hurt's in town Lift Up Your Hat\n\n7.\n\nI bought a boat - It had a leak I met a strongman - He was weak I bought some fried chicken - It had a beak I got lost - Playing Hide 'n' seek Was a turn up for the books Just a turn up for the books Many many hands - Or too many cooks It was a turn up for the books I bought a clock - With no face I bought a horse - That wouldn't race I got myself some shoes - I couldn't lace I got a pacemaker - That couldn't stand the pace Was a turn up…etc Take no notice of all those strange looks It's just a turn up for the books Well you drinker - You smoker You're off line - Playing online poker Well you wretch - You joker That's the fire - And you're the stoker Was a turn up…etc Lining the pockets - Of Dirty crooks Just a turn up for the books\n\n8.\n\nSwing Races 01:34\n\nInstrumental\n\n9.\n\nSee my face out on the river Striking for the distant shore With all the things I can deliver I'm gonna raid the store And go to the races more Now I know which way the wind blows Now I'm fighting in the war Tired of sitting in the window Step through the open door Go to the races more Is it me that's being distant Calling from a foreign shore Fight against so much resistance I know I've found a cure I'll go to the races more I hoped that love would find the answer Put my body to the fore Break the rules just like a chancer Breaking up every law And go to the races more And go to the races more Get down to the races more\n\n10.\n\nWonderful World 04:30\n\nDon't know much about history Don't know much biology Don't know much about the science book Don't know much about the French I took But I do know that I love you And I know that if you loved me to What a wonderful world this could be Don't know much about geometry Don't know much trigonometry Don't know much about algebra Don't know what a slide rule is for But I do know one and one is two And if this one could be with you What a wonderful world this could be Well i don't claim to be an 'A' student But that's what I'm trying to be 'cause if I was, an 'A' student baby I could win your love for me\n\n11.\n\nStone Cold 04:42\n\nAs I lay beneath the sun There's more races to be won I'm stone cold, stone cold again As I lift my body up As I lift the coffee cup It's stone cold, stone cold again Stone cold, Stone, stone cold Stone cold again As I lift the glass of wine As I wait for party time I'm stone cold, stone cold again Take me with you if you can Lead me there, just take my hand It's stone cold, stone cold again Stone cold etc.\n\n12.\n\nFrom A Buick 6 04:55\n\nI got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kid But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid She’s a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed. Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I’m lost on the river bridge I’m cracked up on the highway and on the water’s edge She comes down the thruway ready to sew me up with thread Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed. Well, she don’t make me nervous, she don’t talk too much She walks like Bo Diddley and she don’t need no crutch She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed. Well, you know I need a steam shovel mama to keep away the dead I need a dump truck mama to unload my head She brings me everything and more, and just like I said Well, if I go down dyin’, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed.\n\nYou said that you're gonna leave me, like it or not Better watch your temper now 'cause it's burning hot Take no prisoners now, take it away Could be the last thing that you say to me Something tells me that this time it's true Something tells me that this time it's true Well I can read the signs…and the lines… on your face Tell me that this time it's true You've said that you're gonna leave me, many times before I've tried to find a reason, I just find the door I'll cover you in love, take away the pain But you'd say that it's... it's all in vain and that This time it's true Something tells me that this time it's true Well I can read the signs…and the lines… on your face They tell me that this time it's true You said that you could have helped me, here and there We could have helped each other more…to be fair So now the world's in your hands like an oyster shell I guess it's time, that we wished each other well Cos this time it's true Tell me that this time it's true Well I can read the signs…and the lines…on your face Well they tell me that this time it's true Something tells me that this time it's true Tell me that this time it's true And it's down to you, down to you If you tell me that this time it's true\n\n14.\n\nArms 06:37"
