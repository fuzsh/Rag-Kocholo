        "text": "Recordings are listed in chronological order:\n\n\"The Laughing Song.\" George Washington Johnson. (c. 1896)\n\nGeorge W. Johnson was the first African American to make commercial records; he began in 1890. Born near Wheatland, Virginia, Johnson made his living as a street singer during the 1870s, busking in New York City. \"The Laughing Song\" was Johnson's most famous and long-lived number. This familiar sounding and uncomplicated tune was sung by Johnson in a down-home, gruff baritone and completed with his infectious laughter, all remarkably free of the caricature and forced dialect that marked most African American-themed material of the period. \"Laughing Song\" was tremendously successful, with versions released in the US and Europe. With its ragtime-imbued accompaniment, its stature is inestimable: here is perhaps the most popular recording of the 1890s, and probably the first \"hit\" sung by an African American. Selected for the 2013 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 87KB)\n\nListen in National Jukebox\n\nBert Williams and George Walker. Victor Releases. (1901)\n\nThis vaudeville and musical theater duo, among America's first African-American recording artists, recorded many sides for the Victor Talking Machine Company in 1901. But as effective as the comic duo were on record, George Walker disliked recording and made only one other disc. Bert Williams, however, had a very successful recording career, which included two versions of his signature song, \"Nobody,\" before his death in 1922. The Victor discs are quite rare. Two of them, \"The Fortune Telling Man \" (Victor 1083) and \"The Ghost of a Coon\" (Victor 998), are missing from any known collection. Selected for the 2003 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 52KB)\n\nListen in National Jukebox\n\nBooker T. Washington's 1895 Atlanta Exposition Speech. (1908 recreation)\n\nIn 1906, Booker T. Washington recreated his controversial 1895 Atlanta Exposition speech in which he promotes inter-racial cooperation as well as African-American self-reliance. This address drew criticism from other black leaders who interpreted it as giving in to segregation. Selected for the 2002 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 72KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.\" The Fisk Jubilee Singers. (1909)\n\nThe Fisk Jubilee Singers helped establish the black spiritual in the history of American music. They were also the first to introduce these songs to white audiences through concert tours and recordings. \"Swing Low\" is their first commercial recording. Selected for the 2002 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 202KB)\n\nListen in National Jukebox\n\n“Clarinet Marmalade.” Lieut. Jim Europe’s 369th US Inf. (Hell Fighters) Band (James Reese Europe). (1919) (single)\n\nHaving served in France during WWI, the all-Black 369th Infantry, known as “The Hellfighters,” returned to New York triumphantly on February 17, 1919. Their band, led by composer and orchestra leader James Reese Europe, also made an enormous impression, and received a hero’s welcome home. Shortly before beginning a national tour, the band began making a series of recordings for the American Pathé label. “Clarinet Marmalade” was a work composed by clarinetist Larry Shields and pianist Henry Ragas. It was recorded by Europe’s ensemble in 1919, and though their instrumentation was that of a standard military band, their delivery had a verve and abandon unheard of from such a group. “Clarinet Marmalade” was one of 24 titles released by Europe’s ensemble which helped introduce a new Black American music to a welcoming public. Selected for the 2024 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 175KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"Crazy Blues.\" Mamie Smith. (1920)\n\nWith her recording of \"Crazy Blues,\" Mamie Smith became the first black vocalist to make a commercial vaudeville blues record. The recording was a surprise hit, reputedly selling more than 250,000 copies. It revealed to record companies a previously neglected market for records--African-Americans. Subsequently, thousands of recordings were made of black jazz and blues artists, invigorating the record business and enabling the documentation and preservation of one of the richest eras of musical creativity in the United States.

Johnson (1894-1955), a native of New Brunswick, New Jersey, was one of the creators of the jazz piano style known as \"Harlem Stride,\" which fused elements of ragtime with an active left hand that provided a bass characterized by wide leaps, or \"strides.\" \"Harlem Strut,\" a multi-strain work and a Johnson original, was his first recorded selection, although he did cut piano rolls prior. This recording, along with Eubie Blake’s \"Sounds of Africa,\" lays claim to being the first recordings of Harlem Stride piano. Today, James P. Johnson is best remembered as the composer of \"The Charleston,\" and as the mentor of pianist and composer Thomas \"Fats\" Waller. Selected for the 2022 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 255KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"Down Hearted Blues.\" Bessie Smith.

(1990)\n\nWith text written by James Weldon Johnson in 1900 and set to music by his brother John Rosamond Johnson, the hymn \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" has served as the \"Black National Anthem\" since its adoption by the NAACP in 1919. As with \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" no single recording captures the hymn's essence or its overall meaning to Americans. Therefore, the registry recognizes two recordings: the 1923 version by the Manhattan Harmony Four, one of the last discs issued by the short-lived Black Swan Company—a pioneering African-American-owned record label based in Harlem—and a modernized 1990 version headed by Melba Moore. Moore sought to restore the standing of the song among young African-Americans. Among the many participants in her latter, all-star recording were Stevie Wonder, Anita Baker, Dionne Warwick and Bobby Brown. The resulting single, which benefited charity, made headlines at the time and helped to raise public awareness of the Johnsons' anthem.

(1925)\n\n“Sugar Foot Stomp” was a milestone recording that incorporated jazz into a dance band setting. Henderson was one of the most successful African American bandleaders of his time. From its inception in 1921, his band played rather polite dance music, laced with a well-intended yet ponderous style of jazz, typically found in New York during the early 1920s. This changed suddenly upon the October 1924 arrival of New Orleans cornetist Louis Armstrong into the Henderson ensemble. Based on Armstrong’s collaboration with Joe Oliver’s “Dipper Mouth Blues,” “Sugar Foot Stomp” — in a smart, forward-looking arrangement by Don Redman — becomes streamlined and timelessly hip. Its most salient feature was the 36-bar solo by Armstrong, based on Oliver’s own “Dipper Mouth Blues” solo.

With only his guitar for accompaniment, and a high wailing tenor of a voice, Jefferson recorded a series of powerfully individualistic performances on record from 1925 to 1929, the year of his death. Though he used what were already traditional frameworks for many of his songs, Jefferson personalized them with the interplay between his voice and guitar, extending vocal phrases with long intricate lines of notes, adding or omitting measures in the song as it suited him. This 1928 coupling issued by the Okeh label, and holds two of Jefferson's best performances—\"Matchbox Blues,\" later recorded by Carl Perkins, the Beatles, and many others, and the eerie, lascivious \"Black Snake Moan.\" Selected for the 2014 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 97KB)\n\nListen External\n\n\"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.\" Blind Willie Johnson.

Although most of them were classics, none were quite like \"Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground.\" To create this singular work, Johnson drew on an 18th-century hymn of English origin known as \"Gethsemane,\" which begins with the lines \"Dark was the night, cold was the ground/On which my Lord was laid.\" Instead of singing the lyrics, however, he evoked the sorrowful intensity of the hymn's subject matter by humming and moaning wordlessly in the manner of a church congregation, reinforcing and ornamenting his voice with sliding notes on his guitar. Johnson has distilled the essence of the text and the tradition into an unforgettably intense evocation of Christ on the eve of the Crucifixion as relived in the music of the churches he knew in his youth.

Minnie, herself, is characterized as both \"rough and tough\" and big-hearted, and one who hung around with types as disparate as \"Cokey Joe\" and the King of Sweden.

(1939) (single)\n\nGuitarist Charlie Christian’s tenure with the Benny Goodman Sextet remains a pivotal moment in the development of jazz and amplified guitar in the 20th Century. The jazz standard “Rose Room” served as Christian’s impromptu audition with Benny Goodman’s hugely popular band. Producer John Hammond had recommended Christian to Goodman after hearing of the guitarist’s growing local reputation. Goodman’s initial skepticism was dispelled at a live date in Beverly Hills when Hammond helped Christian sneak his bulky amplifier onstage during intermission. Goodman’s surprise was evident, but since there was a live audience, the performance continued. Christian’s guitar wowed the audience with an extended 45-minute version of “Rose Room” with numerous choruses. Goodman was convinced. Part of Goodman’s skepticism was likely based on the supporting role that guitar had played in jazz. Since acoustic guitars were too quiet to project over an ensemble, they had usually been relegated to the rhythm section.

African-American entrepreneur Joe Von Battle, whose record shop was only a few blocks from Franklin's church, recorded Franklin's sermon \"The Eagle Stirreth Her Nest\" and released it on three 78-rpm discs on his JVB label in 1953. In the sermon, Franklin draws his text from the Book of Deuteronomy and expounds on the parallels between \"God and the eagle.\" He builds to a thunderously emotional climax before his very enthusiastic and vocal congregation. Franklin's many and varied vocal devices inspired not only other preachers, but also gospel and rhythm-and-blues artists who appropriated many of his techniques. Franklin was a national figure in the African-American community from the 1950s on and a close friend and ally of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Selected for the 2010 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 159KB)\n\nListen External\n\n\"Hound Dog.\" Big Mama Thornton. (1953)\n\nThe original version of \"Hound Dog\" brought together several key figures from the world of early 1950s rhythm and blues. Bandleader Johnny Otis invited composers Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller, both still teenagers, to his house to hear Willie Mae \"Big Mama\" Thornton, a physically imposing singer with a powerful voice. She inspired them to write \"Hound Dog\" in a matter of minutes. The song was recorded Aug. 13, 1952, with Otis on drums and two members of his band providing backup: guitarist Pete Lewis and bassist Mario Delagarde. It would be six months before the disc was released, but the unique mix of styles, rhythms and rhymes made \"Hound Dog\" a major hit and an enduring classic. \"Hound Dog\" became a standard of the rock ‘n' roll era. The song went on to be recorded by many artists, including Elvis Presley.

(1953)\n\nAt the time of its release, \"Let's Go Out to the Programs\" was considered to be a novelty, but it now stands as a celebration of a golden age of African-American gospel music. In the fifties, high-energy quartets and quintets like the Dixie Hummingbirds played multi-artist shows known as \"programs,\" where several top gospel acts pushed each other to the limit. Led by the legendary Ira Tucker, the Hummingbirds recreate such a program in less than three minutes with striking but good-natured imitations of four gospel groups: the Soul Stirrers (with their young lead singer, Sam Cooke), the Blind Boys of Mississippi, the Pilgrim Travelers, and the Bells of Joy. The Dixie Hummingbirds continue to perform today, led by Ira Tucker, Jr.; younger singers carry on the legacy of the Soul Stirrers, while original members of the Bells of Joy still sing in their home of Austin, Texas.

(1953)\n\nPianist Henry Roeland Byrd (1918-1980), aka \"Professor Longhair,\" was a pivotal figure in New Orleans rhythm-and-blues although he attained little success outside the city before the 1970s. His music was a classic New Orleans fusion of blues figures, parade-band cadences, and Afro-Caribbean rhythms and melodies that he worked into dense, but light-fingered piano lines, and topped off with his merrily idiosyncratic singing, whistling and scatting. Although Byrd's 1953 recording of \"Tipitina\" had little impact outside of his hometown, it was a signature distillation of the musical ideas and personality that inspired and influenced such New Orleans pianists as Fats Domino, Huey \"Piano\" Smith, James Booker, Dr. John and Allen Toussaint.

The momentum that drives these performances comes from Blakey--his flawless timing and energy on the drums which pushes Brown and Donaldson to soar to new improvisational heights on their solos.

He played guitar locally with a small group, drawing inspiration from the polyrhythmic song and music emanating from storefront churches, a pulsing blend that he distilled into the song \"Bo Diddley,\" the A-side of his first single. Drummer Clifton James played the defining beat, and Bo's guitar and Jerome Greene's maracas added further rhythmic layers beneath the chanted couplets. Having introduced himself, he threw down the gauntlet on the B-side, \"I'm a Man,\" a throbbing slow blues that, as simple as it seems, took nearly thirty takes to get down just right.

(1956)\n\nThe child of a Jamaican mother and a Martinican father, Harry Belafonte had tried singing conventional pop songs in New York in the 1940s, but was drawn to the city's small but vibrant folk scene of the time. There, he encountered Josh White, Pete Seeger and Lead Belly and developed a folk-influenced repertoire that included West Indian songs. In the fall of 1955, he performed several Caribbean songs in a televised musical production number, including \"Day-O,\" a Jamaican folk song he adapted with his friend, writer, Bill Attaway, and Irving Burgie, another New York singer with West Indian roots. The positive audience response convinced Belafonte that a full album of such songs was viable. The album \"Calypso,\" featuring \"Day-O\" and more song contributions by Burgie, was released in May 1956, on the heels of Belafonte's second album, which had been the nation's best-selling LP in April. \"Calypso\" proved to be a far bigger hit, exceeding all expectations. The title was evocative; only a few of the songs on the album were actually in the calypso song form of Trinidad, which Belafonte acknowledged. The album was rather a masterfully presented celebration and exploration of Caribbean song. Initially, it sold mainly to the older audience that purchased albums. However, when \"Day-O\" and \"Jamaica Farewell\" were released as singles, Belafonte became popular with the teenage audience as well, a unique achievement at the time, and perhaps the reason that \"Calypso\" is still a much-beloved album.

After their short set at the Newport Jazz Festival, on July 7, 1956, Duke and his orchestra were recalled to the stage. One of the numbers they performed at that time was the 1930s composition \"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue.\" For this piece, at first, just the rhythm section played, then they were joined by the full orchestra. And, then, saxophonist Paul Gonsalves jumped in, and at the urging of the crowd and Ellington himself, wailed through 27 choruses. The performance was historic. \"Time\" magazine would later call it a turning point in Ellington’s career and the Duke himself later said, \"I was born in 1956 at the Newport Festival.\" For decades, this performance was only available to record buyers in a version sourced from a tape where Gonsalves was off-mic and could only be heard beneath the band and audience.

With only five tracks and under 40 minutes, the album may appear slight, but the quality of the music has earned it a place of honor among jazz fans for more than 60 years. Solidly anchored by a rhythm section of drummer Max Roach, bassist Doug Watkins and pianist Tommy Flanagan, Rollins is able to solo with power, grace and humor. On the calypso-based \"St. Thomas,\" inspired by a melody his mother sang to him, Rollins is at first playful, then harder-edged as the tune segues from a calypso rhythm to a standard jazz beat. \"St. Thomas\" went on to become not only one of Rollins' signature tunes but a jazz standard, with dozens of recorded versions.

Gleason observed that \"the musical and critical world [was] split neatly in two\" by Coleman's willingness to abandon bebop's harmonic structure and timing when his music required it. What Coleman never abandoned was the centrality of improvisation to jazz. In this effort he is ably assisted by Don Cherry on cornet, Charlie Haden on bass and Billy Higgins on drums – all musicians with whom he had played intermittently for several years. Cherry and Coleman achieve a close interaction on several tracks, particularly in their speedy unison playing at the beginning of \"Eventually\" and \"Congeniality.\" Haden not only accompanies the other musicians, but also stretches the melodic potential of his instrument, particularly in his solo on \"Focus on Sanity.\" For all the record's iconoclasm, it swings, and even Coleman's more outrageous timbral experimentation can be understood as rooted in the expressiveness of the blues.

Montgomery's playing is characterized by his trademark thumb-picking technique and frequent use of paired notes an octave apart in his melodic statements, often at staggering speeds. Montgomery's unique technique was a result of being self-taught which, in the words of saxophonist Ronnie Scott, allowed him to play \"impossible things on the guitar because it was never pointed out to him that they were impossible.\" In fact, his technique is probably the chief reason he was able to achieve such a full and resonant tone, which did not impede his deft, fluid melodies. On this album, he is also able to switch easily between a variety of styles including swing, up-tempo numbers, ballads and blues while also playing standards and original compositions.

(1961)\n\nOne of America’s favorite holiday songs was inspired by a hot summer day. During a sweltering July afternoon in 1945, while visiting his frequent songwriting collaborator, Robert Wells, at his Toluca Lake, California home, Mel Tormé noticed some lines Wells had written to distract himself from the heat, with wintry images like \"Jack Frost nipping at your nose.\" Sensing their potential as a song, Wells and Tormé went to work and in less than an hour created an enduring holiday standard. Although Tormé himself was an accomplished singer, he felt that a bigger name was needed to generate more record sales. He and Wells pitched the song to Nat King Cole, the leader of a long established jazz trio, who was becoming a popular vocalist. Cole recorded \"The Christmas Song\" four times: in June 1946 with just his Trio; in August of that same year with an added string section; in 1953 with a full orchestra, conducted by Nelson Riddle, and in 1961 with a full orchestra, conducted by Ralph Carmichael, the first stereo version and the one most commonly heard today. According to reports, King Cole Trio guitarist Oscar Moore created the \"Jingle Bells\" coda heard at the end of every one of Cole’s versions. \"The Christmas Song\" is said to be one of the most recorded holiday songs in history, but it’s Cole’s 1961 performance, with perhaps his most lush vocal take, that is generally regarded as definitive.

Anchored by one of the best known bass lines in history, composed by Stoller and played by Lloyd Trotman, the upright acoustic bass is doubled by an electric guitar playing an octave higher. According to Stoller, a guiro played \"... on every second beat and a triangle on every fourth.\" Meanwhile, Stan Applebaum wrote the soaring string arrangement, which included a two-part invention. And while all these elements contributed to the success of \"Stand by Me,\" it is King's incandescent vocal which made it a classic.

Nicknamed \"Long Tall Dexter,\" Gordon had been very active in the 1940s, but due to drug addiction and incarceration, he practically disappeared in the '50s. In August 1961, he was finally clean and free. \"GO\" was not merely Gordon's return to form, but a brilliant display of his hard-won maturity. His tenor sax solos are often playful, even mischievous, sprinkled with quotes from music as diverse as \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" in \"Three O'Clock in the Morning\" or \"El Jarabe Tapatio\" (\"Mexican Hat Dance\") in \"Love for Sale.\" On the other hand, Gordon is known for his sensuous ballads, such as his tender treatment of \"I Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry.\" Lester Young was one of Gordon's main influences and \"Cheese Cake\" is inspired by \"Tickle Toe,\" composed by Young and recorded by Count Basie and His Orchestra in 1940 with Young playing tenor. All six tracks were recorded on August 27, 1961 and feature Blue Note regulars pianist Sonny Clark, bassist Butch Warren, and drummer Billy Higgins, a trio which Gordon called a perfect rhythm section. Dexter Gordon is quoted as saying that \"GO\" is his favorite album.

Formed as a house band for Stax Records, Booker T. & the M.G.'s were playing around in the studio in early 1962 when they came up with two catchy instrumentals. \"Green Onions\" was originally intended as the B-side to \"Behave Yourself,\" but was quickly reissued as the A-side, then later, as the title cut to their first LP. Anchored by the rhythm section of drummer Al Jackson, Jr., and bassist Lewie Steinberg, \"Green Onions\" is propelled by Booker T. Jones' driving organ and Steve Cropper's stinging guitar.

The qualities offered on this album guaranteed it a much wider listenership than most jazz albums at the time, letting it appeal to a public that was increasingly turning its attention to a wider range of spiritual concerns.

Though surprisingly upbeat in tempo (Simone said of it, \"This is a show tune, but the show hasn't been written for it yet.\"), the message of \"Mississippi\" is brutally clear and addressed racial strife in music without the safety of abstraction and metaphor. (In introducing the song in concert, Simone often said, \"And I mean every word!\") Simone's lyrics and impassioned vocal performance lays out her outrage and though the curse word in its title immediately limited the recording's radio airplay, the meaning and musicianship of this work has ensured its fame and endurance.

(1964)\n\n\"Were it not for The Temptations, I never would have written ‘My Girl,'\" declared Smokey Robinson, who co-wrote the song and co-produced the recording with fellow Miracle Ronald White. According to Robinson, \"My Girl\" wasn't written about a specific girl, but it was written for a specific guy, David Ruffin. Robinson felt Temptations tenor Ruffin could be a star if he had the right song to show off his talent. Both he and The Temptations (Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Melvin Franklin, Paul Williams and Otis Williams) believed \"My Girl\" was that song and began working out the arrangements and rehearsing it while on the road. The recording took place in Studio A of Hitsville U.S.A., Motown's Detroit headquarters and featured the legendary group of session musicians known as the Funk Brothers. One of the most remarkable outcomes of \"My Girl\" is that James Jamerson's barely there opening bassline has become so iconic that the song is instantly recognizable from just those three notes. Guitarist Robert White quickly adds an ascending guitar riff, a pentatonic scale. From there, the sound builds, layer by layer: finger snaps, drums, Ruffin's lead vocal, other members of the Funk Brothers, vocal harmonies by the other Temptations and, finally, strings by members of the Detroit Symphony. \"My Girl\" was at the top of the charts for only one week, but it remained on jukeboxes for years, becoming a classic of the Motown era.

The front line (trumpet, clarinet, and trombone) contains all the necessary elements needed to provide the ear with a satisfying melodic, harmonic and rhythmic picture.

Delmark Records owner Bob Koester was so anxious to record an album with blues singer and harmonica player Junior Wells that he allowed Wells to choose his sidemen and songs. Because Koester believed the selected guitarist was contractually obligated to another company, guitarist Buddy Guy was billed as \"Friendly Chap\" on the original LP release. Koester also allowed Wells to stretch out a bit on songs, half of which lasted longer than three and a half minutes at a time when three minutes or less was the norm for a blues record. One bit of bad luck turned out to be a godsend. During the session, Buddy Guy's amplifier quit working, and while it was being repaired, engineer Stu Black wired him through the Leslie speaker of the studio's Hammond B-3 organ, which gave Guy's guitar a distinctive sound, easily noticeable on the title cut. Koester later remarked, \"I've always been amazed at how rarely reviewers commented on the guitar-organ tracks.\" Selected for the 2012 registry.\n\nLearn more (PDF, 55KB)\n\nListen (MP3)\n\n\"In the Midnight Hour.\" Wilson Pickett.

Pickett and Stax Records session guitarist Steve Cropper, of the house band Booker T. and the M.G.s, had never met before, but in barely an hour, the pair wrote Pickett's first hit. Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler, whose idea it was to bring Pickett to Stax, suggested a rhythm based on the teenage dance the Jerk, and an arrangement was quickly realized. \"In the Midnight Hour\" clicked with audiences across the country in the summer of 1965 and firmly established Pickett as a major artist.

(1966)\n\nAccording to the Motown Museum, \"Reach Out, I'll Be There\" was the Four Tops’ biggest hit and is considered the vocal group’s theme song. Recorded in Studio A at Hitsville USA and written and produced by the powerhouse team of Holland-Dozier-Holland, the lyrics grew out of their feeling that women \"wanted someone to be there for them, through thick or thin.\" Lamont Dozier said that he wanted to write \"a journey of emotions with sustained tension, like a bolero.\" To achieve that, he \"alternated the keys, from a minor, Russian feel in the verse to a major, gospel feel in the chorus.\" Levi Stubbs’ impassioned vocal was inspired by an unlikely source: Bob Dylan. According to Dozier, they were inspired by Dylan’s shout singing style on \"Like a Rolling Stone\" and wanted lead vocalist Stubbs to sing like that. To give his vocal added intensity, HDH put Stubbs at the top of his vocal range so he would have to strain a little. The \"galloping\" sound, heard prominently at the beginning of the song, is a series of triplet beats struck on the plastic head of a tambourine with no jingles, played by Motown producer Norman Whitfield.

Taylor sang the lyrics with gusto, backed by a crack team of players that included Buddy Guy on guitar, and the song’s rogues’ gallery of party guests that included “Automatic Slim” and “Razor Totin’ Jim” rocked jukeboxes and radios around the country.

In a shrewd marketing move, the album was released weeks before the movie, increasing the interest of both the audience and film distributors. However, while supporting the film in those ways, songwriter Curtis Mayfield was concerned that the movie glorified drug use and sought to deliberately undercut what he saw as a \"commercial\" for cocaine. Mayfield wanted to counter \"Superfly's\" portrayals of drug use with songs that showed the consequences. For example, \"Freddie's Dead\" is used in the movie only as an instrumental, but Mayfield not only wrote stinging lyrics for it, he released it as the first single from the soundtrack. Having lived in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green public housing project, Mayfield was all too familiar with the damage done by gangs and pushers. Mayfield said, \"It was important for me to counter the visuals—to go in and explain it in a way that the kids would not read it as an infomercial for drugs.\" Mayfield produced the recording sessions and did all the vocals, but some of the credit for \"Superfly's\" sound should go to Johnny Pate, who is credited as an arranger and orchestrator on the album.

The album covers a variety of topics and moods from the militancy of \"Get Up, Stand Up\" and \"I Shot the Sheriff\" to the heartfelt rage and poverty-induced despair of \"Burnin' and Lootin'.\" The final track, the traditional \"Rastaman Chant,\" sounds a more redemptive note. These themes continued in Marley's work after he left the earlier Wailers lineup and became an internationally acclaimed solo artist.

(1973)\n\n\"Head Hunters\" is a pivotal work in the career of Herbie Hancock; it was his first true fusion recording. Possessing all the sensibilities of jazz but with R&B and funk soul rhythms, \"Head Hunters\" had a mass appeal that made it the greatest-selling jazz album in history at the time of its release. The recording is notable for its use of an extremely wide range of instruments, including electric synthesizers which brought that new instrument to the forefront of jazz for the first time. Hancock's experiments caused controversy among jazz purists, many of whom at the time belittled it as \"pop.\" \"Head Hunters\" proved to be influential not only to jazz, but also to funk, soul and hip hop musicians.

(1973)\n\nCaptivating performances by singer Sarah Vaughan, who Gunther Schuller once called \"the greatest vocal artist of our century,\" are preserved in this two-LP set. The 1973 recording is an excellent example of Sarah Vaughan's range of talents: her stunning virtuosity, glorious instrument, heartfelt interpretations, and ease of performing before a live audience. It features several signature tunes, including \"Summertime\" and \"Poor Butterfly.\" \"Live in Japan\" was produced relatively late in Vaughan's career and illustrates that, unlike most singers, Vaughan's voice seemed to grow richer, stronger and more versatile as she aged.
