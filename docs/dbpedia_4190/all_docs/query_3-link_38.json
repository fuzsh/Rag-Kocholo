        "text": "Here we are again, this week celebrating saints and sinners in music (although I note that we seem to be rather short of saints). And talking of saints, we welcome Panthersan, who starts us off with a rousing wake up call this Monday morning. 😉\n\nIf you have an Earworm you’d like to share, please send an .mp3, .m4a or a link to adempster73@gmail.com, together with a few words about why you’ve chosen it. Next week’s theme will be old age, which seems pertinent right now.\n\nTake care and stay safe, everyone. Many thanks to all contributors.\n\n3 Inches of Blood – Deadly Sinners – panthersan: I’m not usually a Power Metal fan, but I love the combination of the high-pitched metal yelp and the gruffer grunt underneath. Also, metal songs that reference Metal are always a winner!\n\nGreta Van Fleet – Lover Leaver – alfiehisself: Not sure the lyrics mention a specific sin, but think it sounds sufficiently sleazy.\n\nJoe Bonamassa – Who Killed John Henry – tincanman: “The Battle of Sinners and Saints” is an earworm of mine from Joe’s 2013 album An Acoustic Evening at the Vienna Opera House. Joe is unusually warm and intimate on this, which exists in many forms but usually attributed to Mississippi John Hurt.\n\nThe Animals – The House of the Rising Sun – glassarfemptee: The early Animals were raw and powerful, especially in this traditional song of a sorrowful sinner. I love Alan Price’s organ playing as much as Burden’s vocals. A hit both sides of the pond in ’64, so it wasn’t all about Beatles then…\n\nGabby Young and Other Animals – The Devil Has Moved In – severin: The corrupting power of money and fame. Sounds quite celebratory to be honest.\n\nHozier – Take Me to Church – AliM: This song always sounds deliciously sacrilegious to me: “No Masters or Kings / When the Ritual begins / There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin / In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene / Only then I am human / Only then I am clean / Ooh oh. Amen. Amen. Amen.”\n\nLittle Axe – Another Sinful Day – shoegazer: Predates Moby’s repurposing of old Blues tunes by about 5 years.\n\nBob Dylan – What Good Am I? – severin: Possibly a shoehorn. Bob basically asks if he’s a good man and doesn’t come up with very comforting answers. At least not if he does all the things decried in the song.\n\nNeil Young – Yonder Stands the Sinner – glassarfemptee: Neil Young wasn’t singing about Donald Trump when he cut “Yonder stands the sinner” for a live album in ’73. But he sure seems prescient: “Well, you heard about the great pretender/I went to see him and he’s not the same/ Down by the club on the parking lot cinders/I was to meet him and play his game”.\n\nDavid Bowie – All Saints – alfiehisself: Saints and Sinners makes me think of the parties of years gone by, Vicars and Tarts. Obviously chosen for people with limited costume choice, just a strip of white cardboard for a vicar. I always went as a tart. Odd, meeting up in a pub pre-party, complete strangers at the bar couldn’t resist squeezing my oranges. Must have been a tartier looking tart than I’d intended. If I’d had a copy, but I don’t, I might have chosen Hugh Laurie: St James Infirmary, which is nice.\n\nAnju Brahmasmi – Endaro Mahanubhavalu – Ravi Raman: Part of the Tyagaraja “Five Gems” and perhaps the most famous of his compositions. A salute to all the saints and musicians down the ages. Anju Brahmasmi is a musician who blends rock, jazz, and carnatic into a unique style.\n\nU Srinivas – Dudukugala – Ravi Raman: Here’s another Mandolin Srinivas share. Also one of the famous “Panchratnas or Five Gems” by Tyagaraja. Sort of like a sinner’s lament. Sins listed include aimlessly wandering around, giving sermons to people who are not interested in listening or who do not have the capability to understand, self-styling oneself as a great person, and mistaking the dross for the real thing.\n\nSukumar Prasad – Intha Chalamu – Ravi Raman: One of the handful of tracks left of this genius musician who disappeared into an ashram in the late ’80s. Sukumar was a gifted percussionist (mridangam) who later turned to the electric guitar and pioneered its use in carnatic music. Here he takes the three line (“Why are you neglecting me like this?”) plea to god and turns it into a 11 minute exposition of talent.\n\nWarren Zevon – Dirty Little Religion – MaggieB: A statement about hypocrisy or just a song about sinning happily? Great either way."
