        "text": "Let's start with the basic building blocks of any good blues collection. These are the essential blues albums that will give you a good start, a solid foundation upon which to further explore the blues. And when you say the \"real deal\", I go back way before the 60s.\n\n1. Robert Johnson \"King of the Delta Blues Singers\"\n\nRobert Johnson is mentioned so often and so reflexively on every blues list that it's sort of become a cliche. But cliches usually have an underpinning of truth about them...that's how they got popular to begin with. So it is with Robert Johnson. The reason he is mentioned by everyone and his mother is that he really was that good...and he was one of the first of the old blues guys to get recorded. Of course, some contrarian will soon pop in here to say he is overrated and blah, blah, blah. Just know this...he probably was an influence on every band and musician you like. Page, Clapton, Beck, the Stones, etc., etc. This is where you start your blues journey.\n\nNow, there are several options available for Robert Johnson...the original vinyl album, the remastered and expanded CD release with bonus tracks. Or, you can go with the box set \"The Complete Recordings\", available in cd, cassette, or vinyl:\n\n2. Leadbelly \"The Definitive Leadbelly\" box set\n\nAnother perennial when discussing Legends of the Blues, Leadbelly got a big boost with the younger generation when Nirvana covered his \"In the Pines\" aka \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\" on their MTV Unplugged in New York performance. If a three disc box set is too much for you to start with, I suggest these more concise and cheaper alternatives: Smithsonian Folkways' \"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?: Leadbelly Legacy Vol. 1\" and Sony's \"Leadbelly: King of the 12-string Guitar\".\n\n3. Howlin' Wolf \"Howlin' Wolf/Moanin' in the Moonlight\" and \"Real Folk Blues/More Real Folk Blues\"\n\nHe was a huge influence on Robert Plant, so enough said. A galvanizing force. Of course, if price is no object you will splurge on Hip-O Select's \"SMOKESTACK LIGHTNING: The Complete Chess Masters 1951-1960\", a wonderful 4-disc box set.\n\n4. Bessie Smith \"The Essential Bessie Smith\"\n\nWomen get the blues, too, as Bessie righteously demonstrates on this tasty 2-disc introduction to her artistry. If this makes you hungry for more, you can further explore Sony's 5 Volume The Complete Recordings set.\n\n5. Skip James \"Vanguard Sessions: Blues from the Delta\"; Yazoo's \"The Complete Early Recordings\"; and Vanguard's \"Studio Sessions: Rare & Unreleased\"\n\nWhile Robert Johnson, Son House, Muddy Waters, Leadbelly and Howlin' Wolf get most of the attention, Skip James deserves to get his share, and is definitely one of my favourite blues singers. I find I listen to his albums more often than a lot of those other guys. Yes, I am recommending all three albums...they are all worth having, as they are each distinct in their own way. Once you listen to him, his voice will haunt your soul. His guitar playing was pretty good and unique, too.\n\n6. Charley(or Charlie) Patton \"The Definitive Charley Patton\" Catfish UK box set\n\nAnother guy who gets lost in the shuffle and forgotten sometimes...yes, you need all three discs of this superlative box set put out by the UK's Catfish label.\n\n7. Son House \"FATHER OF THE DELTA BLUES: The Complete 1965 Sessions\"\n\nForget the single disc version, go for Sony's 2-cd remaster. Son House is the real deal.\n\n8. Blind Willie McTell \"The Definitive Blind Willie McTell\"\n\nThis Sony 2-disc set is a fine introduction to this 12-string master from Georgia. Like the Allman Brothers \"Statesboro Blues\"? This is the guy who wrote the song. Bob Dylan loved him so much he named a song after him.\n\n9. John Lee Hooker \"The Ultimate Collection 1948-1990\"\n\nMoving into the later years and the electric blues, this Rhino Records set is a winner with me for simply having one of the best renditions of the classic song \"I Cover the Waterfront\" I have ever heard.\n\n10. Muddy Waters \"Folk Singer\" and \"At Newport 1960\"\n\nIf you're a Led Zeppelin fan, then you know about Muddy Waters...or at least, you should. Just about all the early stuff is essential, and these two albums are a great way to start. As a bonus, on \"Folk Singer\" Willie Dixon and a young Buddy Guy were part of his band. Of course, Muddy Waters is such a blues giant, that you really should splurge and get every volume of the Complete Chess Masters set.\n\nThere are plenty more blues artists to recommend...Mississippi John Hurt, Memphis Minnie & Kansas City Joe, Elmore James, Slim Harpo, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Buddy Guy, BB King, Sonny Boy Williamson, Bukka White, Otis Rush, Albert King, Lonnie Johnson, RL Burnside, and on and on...but I didn't want to overwhelm you with too much at once. In my humble opinion, the 10 artists I listed are the backbone of any great blues collection and will suffice on getting you started.\n\nAs for compilations of various blues artists, there are some good ones put out by Yazoo, the UK label Proper Box, and Smithsonian Folkways(who have access to the famous Alan Lomax field recordings). But there are two compilations that are ESSENTIAL, and I recommend getting them along with the albums I recommended above.\n\nThe first is Smithsonian Folkways \"Anthology of American Folk Music\", edited by Harry Smith.\n\nAbsolutely a must-have in anyone's music collection.\n\nThe second is RCA/Bluebird's \"When the Sun Goes Down: The Secret History of Rock and Roll\", an often stunning 10 (or more?) volume series that compiles some great and rare blues, gospel, country-blues, and more from the early 1900s. Each volume is a single disc and focused on an artist or theme. My favourite of the series might be Volume 6: \"Poor Man's Heaven: Blues and Tales of the Great Depression\".\n\nHere is the track listing:\n\n1. Eddie Cantor's Tips on the Stock Market - Eddie Cantor\n\n2. A Tale of the Ticker - Frank Crumit\n\n3. Brother, Can You Spare a Dime? - Leo Reisman And His Orchestra\n\n4. Remember My Forgotten Man {Gold Diggers} - George Hall\n\n5. It Must Be Swell - Alex Bartha And His Hotel Traymore Orchestra\n\n6. Raisin' the Rent - Ramona & Roy Bargy\n\n7. Sittin' on a Rubbish Can - Julia Gerity And Her Boys\n\n8. Ten Cents a Dance {Simple Simon} - High Hatters\n\n9. Poor Man's Heaven - Carson Robison & Bud Billings\n\n10. The Rich Man and the Poor Man - Bob Miller\n\n11. Hallelujah, I'm a Bum - Harry McClintock\n\n12. All In, Down and Out Blues - Uncle Dave Macon\n\n13. Taxes on the Farmer Feeds Them All - Fiddlin' John Carson\n\n14. How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live? - Blind Alfred Reed\n\n15. The Farmer Relief Song - Vernon Dalhart\n\n16. Dusty Old Dust (So Long It's Been Good to Know Yuh) - Woody Guthrie\n\n17. 35 Depression - Mississippi Sarah & Daddy Stovepipe\n\n18. California Desert Blues - Lane Hardin\n\n19. It's Hard Time - Joe Stone\n\n20. President Roosevelt Is Everybody's Friend - Rev. J.M. Gates\n\n21. CWA Blues - Joe Pullum\n\n22. Jimmy Shut His Store Doors - Cedar Creek Sheik\n\n23. Welfare Store Blues - Sonny Boy Williamson\n\n24. Poor But Ambitious - Wilmoth Houdini\n\nThe Lane Hardin song was one I had never heard...in fact, I had never heard of Lane Hardin and it seems he only recorded one single. Too bad, as it's a killer and I wish he had recorded more."
