        "text": "CD 03092: Bill Morrissey: Songs of Mississippi John Hurt. The legendary Mississippi John Hurt died in 1966, the same year Bill Morrissey, a contemporary folk singer/songwriter, first heard his music. Morrisey had a simple and laconic style that well suits Hurt's music, which combined blues, folk and country influences to produce a sweet, gentle and rhythmic sound that still draws favor from musicians in all those genres. *ac*bl*cf*tf\n\nCD 03091: Red House Painters: Songs for a Blue Guitar. Red House Painters formed in San Francisco in 1989 and were active throughout the 1990s. The group's leader, singer/songwriter Mark Kozelek, was known for \"his very personal and emotional songs of despair, pain and suffering\" (wikipedia.org). The group's music has been described as Indie rock, folk rock, or dream pop, but in general they were one of the leaders of the so-called \"slowcore\" movement in alternative rock. This CD is one of their later ones, from 1996. *ar\n\nCD 03090: Mos Def: The New Danger. Mos Def's career began in the 1990s, and he has since become a major star both as a rap artist and screen actor (multiple award nominations for each). He is one of the leaders of socially conscious rap and has been associated with a number of related political and social causes. This album achieved Gold status and reached the top 5 on Billboard. *hi*pc\n\nCD 03089: Terry Reid: Terry Reid. Terry Reid, rock singer and guitarist, has been active since the mid-1960s, when he was hanging around with people like Graham Nash, Jimmy Page, and the Rolling Stones, and opening for many of them in concert. This critically acclaimed solo album was released in 1969. Several years later Reid moved largely behind the scenes, concentrating on sessions work, mostly for well-known American performers like Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt. *eg*rk\n\nCD 03088: John Hammond: I Can Tell. This early (1967) John Hammond collection features Hammond on vocals, harmonica, and acoustic guitar, and an all-star supporting cast including Bill Wyman, Duane Allman, the significant portion of the group that would become The Band, and others. The material: well, the blues, of course, with covers of classics by the likes of Willie Dixon, Howlin Wolf, John Lee Hooker, Chuck Berry... *ag*bl\n\nCD 03087: Del McCoury: High Lonesome and Blue. This 2004 release has an apt title, perfectly descriptive of the music of one of bluegrass music's leading citizens. How prominent is he? Well, he's won 31 International Bluegrass Music Association Awards, and been their Entertainer of the Year four consecutive times. *bg\n\nCD 03086: The Fugs: The Fugs First Album. I would not blame you if you don't know The Fugs; they were never very well known. But they were certainly--uh, interesting, and had a fair amount of influence on later acts. Above all, perhaps, they are most remembered as the first act to take potty-mouth to the level it deserves; still, beneath the blisters they were also a creative and effective vehicle for satire and political criticism: note their 'Night of Napalm' and 'War Kills Babies,' bonuses on this extended collection. *ar*cm*pc\n\nCD 03085: Harry Nilsson: Nilsson Schmilsson. The late Harry Nilsson was a bit of an odd man-out in the 60s and 70s. Although a well-covered and respected songwriter, he made most of his fame as a singer of other people's material. But then his voice was extraordinary (for example, 'Without You,' included here), and he had a talent for bringing life to quirky material as well. *mr*ss\n\nCD 03084: Niyaz: Niyaz. Niyaz continues the general direction started by Vas--melodic, percussive and rhythmic Persian music, sold not only by its own inertia but by the mysterious vocals (and hammered dulcimer playing) of Azam Ali. Most of the tracks here feature Urdu and Persian poetry, including several works by Rumi. Some of the other instruments used: bass guitar (Tony Levin), frame drums, synthesizer, electric guitar, guitar viol, tabla, oud, tombak, darbuka, etc., etc. *is*na\n\nCD 03083: Kronos Quartet: Black Angels. This 1990 CD features the KQ's performance of composer George Crumb's 'Black Angels,' inspired by the Vietnam War. Also included are works by Tallis, Marta, Ives, and Shostakovich. *cl\n\nCD 03082: Indigo Girls: Indigo Girls. Folk rockers Amy Ray and Emily Saliers got together in the 80s and by the end of the decade had become a major act on the circuit. This was their first major release, and remains their most successful one. *cf*rk*ss*wm\n\nCD 03081: The Kinks: Something Else. A classic (1967) five-star release by one of the great bands in rock 'n roll history. It includes the magical 'Waterloo Sunset,' generally acknowledged as one of the finest songs in the mid-60s repertoire. *ar*rk*ss\n\nCD 03080: Lee \"Scratch\" Perry: Lord God Muzick. Reggae music from one of the leading producers in the genre. *rg\n\nCD 03079: Medieval Baebes: Mirabilis. Now here's something you don't see every day: a punk Medieval music girly band. Actually, apart from the visuals, they're pretty far from punk; this is atmospheric \"nymph\" fare that gets the most air play on New Age stations. *cl*na*tf\n\nCD 03078: John Adams: The Dharma at Big Sur / My Father Knew Charles Ives. This two-CD set (one for each work) couples of pair of 2003 compositions by Adams, one of our leading classical composers. The first work is something of a meditation for electric violin (played by Tracy Silverman); the second, a three part piece sounding just about the way you would expect Charles Ives to sound had he lived a hundred years later and had absorbed a minimalist (though not dominantly so) influence. *cl\n\nCD 03077: Edgar Meyer: Edgar Meyer. A one-man-show release by the well-known crossover (bluegrass, classical...) bass player and composer. Edgar multitracks himself on just about all of the cuts, playing, in addition to bass, piano, guitar, dobro, and mandolin. *ac*cl*jz\n\nCD 03076: John Martyn: Solid Air. This fine two-CD retrospective of works from the British folk/jazz guitarist and songwriter John Martyn includes all his best known pieces (e.g., 'May You Never,' 'Couldn't Love You More,' 'One World,' 'Solid Air,' and 'I Don't Wanna Know'). Martyn also has a very distinctive voice--a soothing yet rough vehicle that well suits his bluesy material. *ag*bl*cf*jz*ss\n\nCD 03075: Rufus Wainwright: Rufus Wainwright. The first, critically acclaimed, album by the son of Loudon Wainwright III and Kate McGarrigle. \"In addition to his baritone singing voice, he plays both piano and the guitar...some of his songs feature just Wainwright with his piano, his later work is often accompanied by rock instrumentation or a symphony orchestra... Wainwright is an avid opera fan, and the influences on his music are evident, as well as his love of Franz Schubert's Lieder... Some of Wainwright's songs have been described as 'Popera' (Pop Opera) or 'Baroque Pop'. Many of his compositions are densely packed, dizzying amalgams of strings, horns, operatic choruses, ragtime rhythms and his own distinctively warm vocal timbre\" [from wikipedia.org]. *ar*cf*ss\n\nCD 03074: Randy Newman: Good Old Boys. A reissue of the classic 1974 album by Newman, enhanced by a whole second CD of previously unissued material. Sit back, fondle a nice rum and coke, and listen to old Randy give hell to everyone who deserves it... *ss\n\nCD 03073: The Incredible String Band: First Girl I Loved. The Incredibles rank number two in the list of quirky 60s and 70s acts (who's number one?--'gotta be Captain Beefheart, I suppose...), but with them the quirkiness had less to do with wierdness or indecency or outright repulsiveness than it did with their extraordinary commitment to literate themes and gentle, near-psychedelic imagery. This 1972 live performance includes a bit of this and that, perhaps most notably an offering of Robin Williamson's well-covered song 'First Girl I Loved.' *ac*ar*ce*cf\n\nCD 03072: Laura Nyro: Eli and the Thirteenth Confession. Laura Nyro was one of the best songwriters of the late 60s, and eventually an affecting singer. This classic release includes several of her most covered compositions, including 'Sweet Blindness,' 'Eli's Coming,' and 'Stoned Soul Picnic.' *mr*ss\n\nCD 03071: Jerry Jeff Walker: Gypsy Songman: A Life in Song. A made-to-order retrospective by an elder statesman of the country-folk border zone. Everybody knows his 'Mr. Bojangles,' but Walker has been putting out a lot of material for a long time. These selections were recorded all at once, in 1999. *cf*cy*ss\n\nCD 03070: Quicksilver Messenger Service: Happy Trails. \"Though not ultimately as popular as contemporaries Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, the band was integral to the beginnings of their genre. With influences in jazz and Ravel, as well as a strong folk background, the band attempted to create a sound that was individual and innovative\" [from wikipedia.org]. It should also be noted that the band's lead guitarist, John Cipollina, was one of the best of his time. *eg*rk\n\nCD 03069: Keb' Mo': Slow Down. This Los Angeles-based singer/songwriter/guitarist has a firm foundation in the blues of Robert Johnson, but often extends his style out in the direction of soul and r & b. Active since the 1970s, his career only really took off in the 1990s and since that time he has been much in demand. Three Grammy awards have followed, including for this 1998 release (for \"contemporary blues album\"). *bl*rb\n\nCD 03068: William Orbit: Strange Cargos: The Best Of. Orbit is best known as a producer, but \"is also a composer and multi-instrumentalist who has specialised in keyboard electronica and much of his work also features accomplished guitar playing. He has also recorded several largely instrumental solo albums under the name Strange Cargo which features vocals by Beth Orton...among others. 'Water from a Vineleaf' was a chart success\" [from wikipedia.org]. *am*el*im\n\nCD 03067: My Bloody Valentine: Loveless. This album was released to great acclaim in 1991 but the band became largely inactive shortly thereafter; in 2007, however, they reunited and planned new releases and tours for 2008. They were originally formed in Ireland in 1984, but then relocated to London. \"The band's use of guitar distortion, vibrato, and digital reverb placed them as part of the shoegazing genre\" [from wikipedia.org] of alternative rock. *ar*eg\n\nCD 03064: Keith Jarrett: Radiance. Two more CDs full of splendid solo piano from jazzman Keith Jarrett, this time from concerts recorded in Osaka and Tokyo, Japan, in 2002. *jz*pf\n\nCD 03063: Leonard Cohen: The Future. A 1992 recording by the monotonic poet laureate of popular music. \"His work often explores the themes of religion, isolation, sexuality, and complex interpersonal relationships...more than a thousand renditions of his work have been recorded...Cohen was inducted into the American Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with a speech by Lou Reed on March 10, 2008 for his status among the 'highest and most influential echelon of songwriters'\" [from wikipedia.org]. *cf*ss\n\nCD 03062: Delbert McClinton: Room to Breathe. Texas native McClinton has fashioned a successful career as a singer-songwriter since the 1960s, first mostly as a sideman and then out front. McClinton is the consummate cross-over act, deftly exploring the links among country, blues, and rock styles, as in this peppy 2002 release. *bl*cy*rk*ss\n\nCD 03061: Guided by Voices: Bee Thousand. The prolific (they put out just about one album a year from 1987 to 2004, and as many ep's) Guided by Voices formed in the early 80s in Dayton, Ohio. Their work \"shows influence from post-British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk\" [from wikipedia.org]. *ar*rk\n\nCD 03060: Harry Connick Jr.: Come By Me. Harry Connick Jr. is the latest descendant of the Jack Jones-Dean Martin-Frank Sinatra lineage that extends back to the 1950s. Connick sings and plays piano, and is here backed not only by a \"big band,\" but a full orchestra as well. This 1999 release was one of the first stops on the way to sustained success. *mr\n\nCD 03059: The Decemberists: The Crane Wife. Wikipedia classifies The Decemberists' music as: Indie rock / Indie folk / Baroque pop / Art rock, so maybe you get the general picture. This is a very polished act, with just enough acoustic/electric backup to complement some very erudite lyrics intelligently delivered by vocalist Colin Meloy. *ar*cf*ss\n\nCD 03058: June Tabor with Martin Simpson: A Cut Above. This 1989 release combines the talents of one of the best finger-style guitarists in the business (Simpson) with one of the best vocal stylists in folk (Tabor). Mostly traditional material delivered with style and grace. *ag*cf*tf\n\nCD 03057: Rickie Lee Jones: Duchess of Coolsville, An Anthology. Songwriter-vocalist Jones scored instant success in the late 70s and for a few years thereafter, then largely sank out of sight, though continuing to release material from time to time. Recently, her career has been on the ascendant again. *mr*ss*wm\n\nCD 03056: Ramones: Road to Ruin. I guess whoever it was who named this album back in 1978 knew what he was talking about--three decades later, and three of the four Ramones are now dead (and the fourth \"retired\" to performing traditional Appalachian music). *ar*pc\n\nCD 03055: Richard Hell & the Voidoids: Blank Generation. Kentucky native Richard Hell (born Richard Meyers) left school in the 60s to try his hand at poetry in New York; before long he was also performing music and teamed up with Tom Verlaine to form the band Television. This album and its famous title song (now often recognized as a \"top ten\" work of the punk style) came a few years later. Since that time he has pursued a successful career in a number of artistic genres, including poetry, film acting, fiction, and music. *ar\n\nCD 03054: Bombay Dub Orchestra: Bombay Dub Orchestra. The music on this two-CD set is a bit hard to pigeonhole, but it did score a big success in 2007 on the \"New Music\" programs, where it ranked among the year's favorites. It combines ambient, house, and dubbing style electronica under an orchestral sweep, often or usually with a distinctly South Asian music nod. Actually, quite a bit of it sounds like (but isn't) film music--to something swelling with exotic, languorous, themes. *am*el*ho*im*is*na\n\nCD 03053: Laurie Anderson: Bright Red. This 1994 release is pretty typical Laurie Anderson fare: minimalist spoken word/performance art. Nobody sounds even remotely like Laurie Anderson, though, so she's got plenty of room to keep on keepin on. She's helped out here by hubby Lou Reed, Adrian Belew on guitar, Brian Eno on keyboards, and Joey Baron on drums. *ar*pc*ss\n\nCD 03052: The Yardbirds: Five Live Yardbirds. This famous album (with ten bonus tracks added!) was recorded before the group went commercial; i.e., when they were dominantly a blues band led by Keith Relf (vocals and harmonica) and Eric \"Slowhand\" Clapton. A bit rough at the edges, maybe, but surely with as much energy as anyone at that time had. *bl*eg*rk\n\nCD 03051: Beth Orton: Central Reservation. This 1999 release by English singer/songwriter Orton was the one that put her in the spotlight. Orton's musical form has sometimes been termed \"folktronica\" because of her projects with William Orbit; to my ears however her material sounds more like typical contemporary folk, with perhaps a bit more beat. Orton is known for her support of a number of political and ethical causes. *cf*pc\n\nCD 03050: Davey Graham: The Complete Guitarist. Still little known here, Graham is one of the great influences on twentieth century guitar styles, having integrated jazz, blues, classical, and international sources to produce a sound that ignited the British contemporary folk movement in the 60s. This 1977 release samples a bit from all, and is further augmented by eight bonus tracks that were recorded years later. *ag*cf\n\nCD 03048: Fairport Convention: What We Did on Our Holiday. Fairport is still around and going strong these days, but this is from their early lineup that included Sandy Denny, Ian Matthews, Richard Thompson, Simon Nicol, Martin Lamble, and Ashley Hutchings. Part traditional material, part original material, and entirely class material. *cf*rk*ss\n\nCD 03047: Van Der Graaf Generator: Pawn Hearts. Van Der Graaf Generator was a moderately successful \"progressively alternative\" rock band from the late 60s and 70s. Some of the music on this, their best known album, is really extraordinarily dramatic, even if it represents a kind of art music that now really does sound like it comes from the 60s or 70s... *ar\n\nCD 03046: BT: This Binary Universe. Trancemaster BT is one of the current day's top electronic music artists, known especially for his development of trance music, and the stutter edit technique. This highly successful two-CD album \"features a mix of many genres, including jazz, breakbeats, and classical music. Three songs feature a full 110-piece orchestra. BT has said that the album has a lullaby-like quality, inspired by his daughter, Kaia, who sat on his lap throughout most of the song writing process\" [from wikipedia.org]. *am*el*ho*im*na\n\nCD 03045: Jerry Douglas: Restless on the Farm. A 1998 release by the king of the dobro, with an all-star supporting cast including Sam Bush, Edgar Meyer, Viktor Krauss, Sonny Landreth, Steve Earle, Maura O'Connell, Tim O'Brien, Russ Barenberg, etc. *ac*ag*bg\n\nCD 03044: John Zorn: 50th Birthday Celebration Volume 3: Locus Solus. As is often the case with John Zorn projects, this program often slips right into and past the totally arcane. Nominally it is jazz, but a kind of jazz that takes improvisation almost right out of the realms of music. *jz\n\nCD 03043: Canned Heat and John Lee Hooker: Hooker 'n Heat. Canned Heat, though best known for a few fairly light singles, was at heart a potent blues band, so this collaboration with one of the most respected bluesmen of his time was a natural. *bl*rk\n\nCD 03042: Mississippi John Hurt: Last Sessions. Recorded in 1966, the year Hurt died, these were indeed the \"last sessions.\" Hurt had been a popular country blues performer back in the early part of the century, then had largely given up music until he was \"rediscovered\" in the early 60s. His popularity since, especially as an influential guitar stylist, has never flagged. *ag*bl*cy*tf\n\nCD 03041: Butch Hancock: War and Peace. Singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Hancock has worked both as a solo artist and with others since the 70s, usually in a country style strongly tinged with folk and rock accents. This 2007 release showcases his writing talents, but he also plays practically all the instruments appearing on it, besides handling the vocals. On one cut he is joined by Joe Ely and Jimmie Dale Gilmore, his partners in the long term project The Flatlanders. *cf*cy*rk*ss\n\nCD 03040: John McLaughlin: Devotion. Guitar whiz John McLaughlin here, in one of his best releases. Backed by Buddy Miles on drums, Larry Young on keyboards, and Billy Rich on bass. McLaughlin was one of the leaders of the jazz fusion movement, and this 1971 release shows why. *eg*jz\n\nCD 03039: Ralph McTell: Not Till Tomorrow. McTell is little known in this country, but in Britain he is something of an institution, and this 1972 album shows why--it includes some of the best song-for-song song writing in the contemporary folk genre, along with excellent performances from McTell on guitar, and an impressive array of sidemen. Its 'Birdman' and 'Gypsy' are two of the most stirring performances in this style of music. *ag*cf*ss\n\nCD 03038: Jeff Beck: Truth & Beck-Ola. A two-fer CD combining two well-known late 60s, post-Yardbirds, albums by one of best electric guitarists in the business. Most of the music is straight-ahead rock, with blues accents. Sidemen include Rod Stewart on vocals, Ron Wood on bass, and Nicky Hopkins on piano. *eg*rk\n\nCD 03037: Jack DeJohnette: Works. Percussionist DeJohnette is best known for his work as a sideman with the ECM stable of performers; this program of selections is taken from various releases and features him working with the likes of Lester Bowie, John Abercrombie, Terje Rypdal, Miroslav Vitous, David Murray, Arthur Blythe, Peter Warren, Eddie Gomez, and Dave Holland. *ac*jz\n\nCD 03036: Shawn Colvin: Fat City. Joni Mitchell-influenced singer-songwriter and multi-Grammy award winner Shawn Colvin first worked professionally in the late 70s, and in the 80s developed a commercially-oriented contemporary folk style that linked her with Suzanne Vega and Mary Chapin Carpenter. Fat City, nominated for two Grammys, is from 1992, before her career really took off a few years later. *cf*ss*wm\n\nCD 03035: William Orbit: Hello Waveforms. British musician/producer Orbit is known as Madonna's producer, and as the composer/performer of electronic ambient instrumental music. This CD, released in 2006, features lush electronica with occasional vocals, and made a considerable success in the electronica and New Age markets. *am*el*im*na\n\nCD 03034: Mark Isham: Film Music. This early Windham Hill CD is from the mid 1980s, and showcases some of the best of trumpeter/synthesizer player and composer Mark Isham's film scores from the period: for Mrs. Soffel, The Times of Harvey Milk, and Never Cry Wolf. *fi*im\n\nCD 03033: João Gilberto: João Gilberto. The great \"Brazilian singer and guitarist [who is] credited with having created the bossa nova beat and is known as the 'Father of Bossa Nova.'...João Gilberto, aka the 'White Album' (1973), featured hypnotic minimalist execution, limited to the singer, his guitar, and Sonny Carr on drums\" [from wikipedia.org]. *in\n\nCD 03025: Toni Braxton: Ultimate. This compilation CD features eighteen tracks from one of the most successful r & b / soul / pop female acts of recent years. Included is her superhit 'Un-Break My Heart.' Braxton has been nominated for over thirty major singing awards, and's been the winner of half of them. *mr*rb\n\nCD 03024: Nanci Griffith: Lone Star State of Mind. Nanci Griffith has been a mainstay of the country/folk crossover market since she first emerged in the 1980s. This 1987 release was her first chart success, and included her impeccable reading of 'From a Distance,' the Julie Gold song later made a major hit by Bette Midler. *cf*cy*ss\n\nCD 03023: Steel Pulse: Reggae Greats. Steel Pulse is a British roots reggae band hailing from Birmingham, where they formed in the 1970s. Led by David Hinds (vocals and guitar), who writes most of their material, they have put out a dozen albums since 1975 (including a Grammy winner in 1986). Their message is a political one, but it is of a hopeful type incorporating optimistic ideals. *pc*rg\n\nCD 03022: Easy Rider: Soundtrack. Music from, and inspired by, the iconic 1969 \"hippie motorcycle\" film starring Peter Fonda, Jack Nicholson, and Dennis Hopper. Disc one consists of the original soundtrack music (material by Steppenwolf, The Byrds, Roger McGuinn, Jimi Hendrix, etc.); disc two, additional works from the period 1967-69 (e.g. by The Band, Jefferson Airplane, The Who, Procol Harum, Joe Cocker, The Moody Blues, The Youngbloods, Blue Cheer, Eric Burdon, etc.). *fi*rk\n\nCD 03021: Charlie Haden, Jan Garbarek & Egberto Gismonti: Magico. Three top names from the world of ECM jazz team up for a set of elegant (but not emotionally lacking!) \"chamber jazz\" trios in this 1980 release: Haden on double-bass, Garbarek on sax, and Gismonti on guitar and piano. *ac*ag*jz*pf\n\nCD 03014: Spirit: Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus. Spirit was a Los Angeles band that flourished in the emerging psychedelic rock era of the late 60s and early 70s. This, their fifth album, is regarded as one of the finest of the period's art-rock efforts, \"with a tapestry of literary themes about the fragility of life and the complexity of the human experience...best illustrated by the recurring lyric 'life has just begun'\" [from wikipedia.org]. Apart from its literary aspirations it also featured novel production techniques and clever integration of the Moog synthesizer. *rk\n\nCD 03006: Andraé Crouch: Mighty Wind. \"Andrae Crouch has won numerous awards and honors over the years including eight Grammy Awards, four GMA Dove Awards, and ASCAP, Billboard and NAACP Awards. In 2004, he became the only living contemporary Gospel artist--and just the third in history--to have a star enshrined on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\" [from wikipedia.org]. This 2006 release is a 40th anniversary celebration of Crouch's upbeat (incorporating r & b and latin rhythms) style. *rb*re\n\nCD 03005: Bob Marley and the Wailers: Live! Recorded live at the Lyceum, London, on 19 July 1975, just as Marley was beginning to attain major international stardom. *rg*ss\n\nCD 03004: Nick Drake: Five Leaves Left. Poor Nick Drake: Never known during his own short life, and now among the most celebrated of folkies out there. It just goes to show that real talent cannot be kept down forever. *cf\n\nCD 02989: Scott Walker: Scott 2. Little known over here, except possibly for his work with the Walker Brothers ('The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine'), expatriate Scott Walker found major success in Britain and Europe in the mid and late 1960s both with his group, and as a solo artist. Walker had one of the best voices of the period, powerful yet mellow, sounding a bit like a combination of Jack Jones and Andy Williams--but he frequently tackled more challenging material, such as works by Jacques Brel. Although the arrangements here sound a bit dated now, this was a Number One album in Britain in 1968. *mr\n\nCD 02988: The Pogues: Rum Sodomy & the Lash. Ah yes, the conservatively dressed, smoothly harmonizing, ever respectable and respecting Vogues: Where would we... --Eh what? Oh! The Pogues, you say... Oh dear... Well, just take everything I just said and think of the exact opposite... Yes, that will do nicely... *ar*cf*pc\n\nCD 02987: The Replacements: Let It Be. \"The Replacements were an American alternative rock band formed in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1979... [They] began as a punk rock group, but began to incorporate other subgenres of rock music and became instrumental in the development of early alternative rock. Following the critically acclaimed Let It Be (1984), the band signed to Sire Records, becoming one of the first American underground rock bands to sign to a major record label\" [from wikipedia.org]. *ar\n\nCD 02986: The Psychedelic Furs: Should God Forget, A Retrospective. The Psychedelic Furs formed in the late 70s and were one of the first important punk acts in Britain. \"While the band's rise paralleled the first wave of MTV, the Furs had little in common with the pre-packaged, fashion-oriented acts who dominated the music video channel for much of the '80s. ...the Furs were progenitors of the guitar-based alternative rock that would, ironically, begin to find a mass audience at the same time the band was winding down\" [from the liner notes]. *ar\n\nCD 02985: Paul Weller: Wild Wood. English singer-songwriter and guitarist Weller began his career in the mid-70s and by the end of the decade was experiencing major success with The Jam. In the 80s he led another successful and influential group, Style Council, before starting a successful solo career. Wild Wood, his second solo work, reached #2 on the British charts, and in the years since he has piled up a long string of hit albums and singles. He has also been influential in the world of style, in the 1980s being the main figure in the Mod Revival. *eg*rk*ss\n\nCD 02984: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Director Stanley Kubrick had originally hired renowned film composer Alex North to do the music for this seminal movie, but in the end decided to use pre-existing classical works: by Richard Strauss, Gyorgy Ligeti, Aram Khachaturian, and Johann Strauss. It was a decision that greatly enhanced the effect of the film. *cl*fi\n\nCD 02983: Crowded House: Woodface. New Zealander Neil Finn (earlier a member of the superb N.Z. band Split Enz) was the guiding light behind this Australian band active circa 1985 to 1996. Finn is a leading force in New Zealand music, having even been made OBE by the Queen in 1993 for his efforts (probably not incidentally, Crowded House was reputedly Princess Di's favorite band...). This 1991 release is finely crafted rock-folk-pop in the best Beatles tradition, filled with memorable hooks but underlain with a depth that is only noticeable after repeated listenings. *rk\n\nCD 02982: King Sunny Ade and his African Beats: Aura. King Sunny Ade's infectious (Nigerian) juju music neatly fills the gap between jazz and Afro-pop. This 1984 Island Records release is one of his best, and features a cameo on harmonica by Stevie Wonder. Ade has been a very influential figure, both in terms of his music, and the recognition that he received that opened the way for later African musicians like Youssou N'Dour, Baaba Maal, and Salif Keita. *ia*jz\n\nCD 02981: Rage Against the Machine: Evil Empire. \"Evil Empire is the second album by Rage Against the Machine... released on April 15, 1996...the album's title is taken from the phrase evil empire, which was used by former U.S. President Ronald Reagan and many Western conservatives in describing the former Soviet Union. The album was positively received by many critics and received the most Grammy nods of the band's career\" [from wikipedia.org]. *ar*hi*pc*rk\n\nCD 02980: The Albion Dance Band: The Prospect Before Us. In the 1970s the Albion Dance Band was an ever-changing conglomerate of British folk musicians whose mission was related to the revival of traditional forms, though often updated with contemporary (including electric) instrumentation. Group organizer Ashley Hutchings is joined in this well known recording by Shirley Collins, John Tams, Simon Nicol, Dave Mattacks, and others. *cf*tf\n\nCD 02979: 10,000 Maniacs: Blind Man's Zoo. 10,000 Maniacs was a very popular alt-rock band for much of the 80s and early 90s, then stumbled on for a number of years after lead vocalist Natalie Merchant left them to pursue a solo career in 1993. This is their most successful release, which although missing the Top 10 went Gold. *ar*cf\n\nCD 02978: Máire Brennan: Perfect Time. Máire (pronounced, and since 2002 spelled, \"Moya\") Brennan is one of the top names in Celtic music, having been for many years the lead singer for the band Clannad. In this solo 1998 CD she explores her renewed faith in Christianity--while managing to not turn the set into \"Christian music\" per se. *ce*cf*mr*re*ss\n\nCD 02977: Joan Baez: Joan Baez. The first album (with three bonus tracks), circa 1960, by the then nineteen-year-old Baez. Consisting of traditional material like 'Silver Dagger,' 'House of the Rising Sun,' 'Girl of Constant Sorrow,' and 'Henry Martin,' the recording features nothing more than Joan's voice and guitar, but this is quite enough to hold one's attention--no wonder she was such an instant success... *tf\n\nCD 02976: Richard Thompson: Mock Tudor. Richard Thompson, ex- of Fairport Convention, is one of best triple-threat singer/songwriter/guitarists (acoustic and electric) around. Perennially a critic's favorite (and listed as number twenty on Rolling Stone's list of 100 all-time greatest guitarists), this 1999 release represents typical fare. Sidemen include Dave Mattacks on drums and Danny Thompson on bass. *ag*cf*eg*ss\n\nCD 02974: Mahavishnu Orchestra: Birds of Fire. One of the early sensational jazz-rock fusion albums by this group, led by guitarist John McLaughlin. Besides McLaughlin, the group members were Billy Cobham on drums, Jerry Goodman on violin, Jan Hammer on keyboards, and Rick Laird on bass. Jimi Hendrix meets Miles Davis and John Coltrane. *eg*jz\n\nCD 02973: Weather Report: Heavy Weather. The most successful of a string of very successful albums by the jazz fusion group led by keyboardist Joe Zawinul, and featuring Wayne Shorter on sax and Jaco Pastorius on bass. This 1977 release includes the crossover hit 'Birdland,' penned by Zawinul. *jz\n\nCD 02972: Rosanne Cash: Black Cadillac. Singer-songwriter Rosanne Cash has found success since the end of the 1970s in a crossover style that incorporates modern country, rock, blues, and whatever else suits her fancy. In this 2006 release she comes to grip with the then-recent deaths of her father and step-mother, country legends Johnny and June Carter Cash. *cy*rk*ss*wm\n\nCD 02971: Joanna Newsom: Ys. This CD was one of the big surprise success stories of 2006. Harpist and little-girl-voiced Newsom writes and sings orchestrated poetry that reminds one of some of Donovan's trippier moments, or better yet, the Incredible String Band. You will probably either hate or love this stuff... *ar*cf*na*ss\n\nCD 02970: Neil Young with Crazy Horse: Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. This early (1969) Neil Young release was his second solo album, coming just before he was asked to join Crosby, Stills and Nash. Included are three of his best known songs, 'Cinnamon Girl,' 'Down by the River,' and 'Cowgirl in the Sand,' but one would have to say that this is also one of his most \"guitar-y\" albums. *cf*eg*rk*ss\n\nCD 02969: Beastie Boys: Beastie Boys Anthology, The Sounds of Silence. This hip hop group from New York City is one of the longest-lived successful hip-hop groups. Starting out as a punk act in 1979, they turned to hip-hop for their first solo album in the mid-80s and have never looked back. \"They're well-known for their eclecticism, jocular and flippant attitude toward interviews and interviewers, obscure cultural references and kitschy lyrics, and performing in outlandish matching suits\" [from wikipedia.org]. *ar*hi*rk\n\nCD 02968: Ben Harper: Fight for Your Mind. Multi-Grammy winner Harper released this his second album in 1995 to wide international acclaim. Harper defies easy classification as his music incorporates elements of folk, blues, gospel, soul, reggae, and rock, and he often collaborates with artists themselves known for one or more of these styles. Harper has a good voice but is also an effective instrumentalist, especially on guitar. *bl*rb*rg*rk*ss\n\nCD 02967: Elana James: Elana James. Elana James is an American singer, violinist and songwriter who performs mostly in a jazz context integrating \"Hot Club of France\" styles with traditional country and old-timey music. This 2006 CD was her first as a solo act, but she also has a string of albums going back ten years with The Hot Club of Cowtown. She made news when she was invited to tour with Bob Dylan, the first woman to do so in thirty years. *ac*cf*jz\n\nCD 02966: The Moody Blues: In Search of the Lost Chord. Well, this 1968 album is definitely hippie-trippy-psychedelic-ville, but it's all in good fun (and actually does have something of a running theme, concerning self-discovery). Especially the unforgettable 'Departure' that begins the voyage... \"Timothy Leary's dead--no, he's outside, looking in...\" (from 'Legend of a Mind'). *rk\n\nCD 02965: Wilco: Being There. This two-CD release was Wilco's second, from 1996. Wilco is among the most successful of the alt-rock/alt-folk/folk rock acts, having so far garnered four Grammy nominations and two wins since they first emerged in the 90s as an extension of the equally interesting band Uncle Tupelo. *ar*cf\n\nCD 02964: Salif Keita: M'Bemba. This 2005 release is a really spectacular piece of Afro folk/pop from singer/songwriter Salif Keita. The mood ranges from an easy Calypso-like swing to much darker material, and throughout one is aware of some very potent producing/arranging talents, especially evident in the rhythm section and Keita's weaving vocals. If you don't take instantly to the first two tracks in particular, then I'm not sure I want to know you! *ia\n\nCD 02963: Chick Corea & Bela Fleck: The Enchantment. An unlikely combination, perhaps--banjo and piano--but here we have two of the best and most inventive performers on these instruments. This 2007 CD wowed just about everybody. *ac*jz\n\nCD 02962: Fleetwood Mac: Then Play On. Once upon a time, before they went mainstream, Fleetwood Mac was Britain's best blues band--in fact, after the demise of the Beatles in 1970, they were voted Britain's best band, period, for two years in a row. This album, their fourth, dates from 1969, and is generally considered their finest effort. Among the high points is the memorable two part Peter Green composition 'Oh Well,' featuring an intoxicating guitar hook. *bl*eg*rk\n\nCD 02961: Yusuf (Cat Stevens): An Other Cup. Well, one wouldn't know quite what to expect from this 2006 release. Stevens emerged in Britain in the mid 1960s as a teen idol, then had a breakdown and metamorphosed in the late 60s into a sensitive quasi-folkie singer-songwriter, and for several years thereafter was a chart-topping international attraction. Suddenly he abandoned it all, adopted Islam, and largely dropped out of sight for thirty years. So now he's back--but here continues with the same kind of approach that proved so successful for him in the early 70s: quiet or bouncy songs with simple but affecting messages. *ss\n\nCD 02960: Christopher O'Riley: Second Grace: The Music of Nick Drake. Classical pianist Christopher O'Riley continues his project of transforming pop star compositions into solo piano pieces (earlier recordings targeted Radiohead songs). One might wonder how such an approach would work in the case of an introverted folkie like Drake, but Drake's \"simple\" music has enough surprises (including jazz influences) to sustain the effort. *cl*pf\n\nCD 02959: Keith Jarrett: The Carnegie Hall Concert. This two-CD set captures another of pianist Keith Jarrett's stunning solo concerts, this one recorded in 2005 in Carnegie Hall. Need I comment that this is pretty remarkable stuff?? *jz*pf\n\nCD 02958: Blind Faith: Blind Faith. Blind Faith, consisting of Eric Clapton, Ric Grech, Stevie Winwood, and Ginger Baker, was one of the first rock supergroups. This album, released in 1969, was their only work--but it was an immediate smash success, and remains a marker set of the music for the period. Sorry, this CD has the stock cover (not the original British one that featured Baker's teenage sister, naked...). *eg*rk\n\nCD 02957: Lou Reed: Berlin. This early Lou Reed project (1973) was not the glam rock that some of his fans were expecting at the time; instead, as the liner notes describe it, it was a \"beautifully bleak\" collection, an \"unforgiving tale of drugs, death and sexual betrayal met with confusion, revulsion and anger.\" Sidemen included Michael and Randy Brecker, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Tony Levin, and Stevie Winwood. *ar*ss\n\nCD 02956: Radiohead: The Bends. Radiohead is an \"alternative rock\" band, but that tag does little justice to the leadership role they are currently playing on the music scene. This was their second CD, from 1995, when they were just beginning to grab everyone's attention. *ar\n\nCD 02955: Stefan Grossman: Best of the Transatlantic Years. Grossman has been one of the world's leading country blues guitarists since the 1960s, both as a performer and an educator/guitar instructor. This compilation is taken from three albums put out between 1970 and 1972, when Grossman was a mainstay on the British folk circuit. The 23 selections feature Grossman as soloist and in small combos with other performers. *ag*bl*cf\n\nCD 02954: Marc Anthony: Otra Nota. Salsa singer and balladeer Marc Anthony ranks among the best known American-born Latin performers. This CD, from 1993, is from his early days of success, shortly after he turned to the effervescent style he is now well known for. *in\n\nCD 02953: Janis Ian: God & the FBI. Janis Ian first crashed the folk circuit in the early 1960s, when she had barely reached her teen years. In the late 60s and 70s she came to national attention, then settled back to a lower key career, usually out of the limelight. This 2000 release shows that she still knows what she's doing. *ss*wm*pc\n\nCD 02952: Iron & Wine: Our Endless Numbered Days. Iron & Wine is the project name of singer-songwriter and native South Carolinian Sam Beam. Beam follows in the steps of Nick Drake and Elliott Smith; his music is quiet and unassuming acoustic Indie folk or folk rock, lyrically elegant and delivered in a manner not far from early Simon and Garfunkel. *cf*ss\n\nCD 02951: Tish Hinojosa: Retrospective. \"Since 1988, singer-songwriter Tish Hinojosa has been part of the vibrant Austin music scene. She has drawn numerous critical accolades for her borderless approach to music, blending Mexican folk and country music with a modern singer/songwriter sensibility and touches of pop. This is her first multi-label career retrospective covering songs from many of her acclaimed albums\" [from the liner notes]. *cf*in*ss\n\nCD 02950: The Duhks: Migrations. \"The Duhks (pronounced like 'ducks') are a 5-member Canadian folk-rock-Celtic-old time-bluegrass-contemporary-Latin-French Canadian-gospel (though usually described as folk rock or bluegrass) group...Their music draws heavily on all of the North American musical traditions, while successfully integrating Latin-music-influenced percussion\" [from Wikipedia.org]. This is their third album; earlier efforts had already won them a Juno award and a Grammy nomination. *ac*cf*tf\n\nCD 02949: Tom Waits: Swordfishtrombones. The inimitable Tom Waits, again growling his way into our hearts and minds as only he can do. *ar*ss\n\nCD 02948: Talking Heads: Stop Making Sense. A \"special new edition\" of the 1984 \"movie,\" containing \"seven previously unreleased live tracks.\" In the late 70s and early 80s Talking Heads was *the* alt-rock group--they practically invented the genre. Includes some of their best known pieces, e.g. 'Psycho Killer' and 'Take Me to the River.' *ar*fi\n\nCD 02947: Solomon Burke: Nashville. Big time soul/r & b by one of the giants of the genre. In this 2006 release he teams up a lot of Nashville folks, like Buddy Miller, Dolly Parton, Gillian Welch, Sam Bush, Patty Griffin, and Patty Loveless. Some years back Burke was elected to the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame. *rb\n\nCD 02946: Waylon Jennings: Honky Tonk Heroes. This famous album, released in 1973 on RCA Victor, helped define the movement that became known as \"outlaw country.\" All the material on the album was written or co-written by the veteran country artist Billy Joe Shaver. The cuts 'You Asked Me To' and 'We Had It All' became successful singles. *cy*ss\n\nCD 02945: Mike Oldfield: Ommadawn. This was the third of Mike Oldfield's epic instrumental albums from the 1970s, the best known of which was the sensationally successful Tubular Bells. Ommadawn itself was a top five placer on the British charts, but didn't do so well here. If you have a daughter who loves horses, or were once a girl who loved them yourself (or still do!), you must listen to the last 3:20 of the second and concluding track on this album, by far the most adorable ode to our four-legged friends ever set to disc. *cf*im\n\nCD 02944: Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers: Modern Lovers 88. Jonathan Richman is a legendary regional musician from the Boston area. He has always been something of a maverick, but a maverick with a firm foot in garage rock and \"good-time\" music. Every once in a while he surfaces to record a little gem like this one. *ar*rk\n\nCD 02943: Taj Mahal: The Essential. This two-CD set samples from the vast repertoire of one of our country's most flexible singer/composer/instrumentalists. Taj Mahal's career began in the 1960s, but he's still going strong, turning out material ranging from traditional country and electric blues to folk, original songs, and international music collaborations. A two-time Grammy winner, in 2006 he was made by act of legislature the \"Official Blues Artist\" of the State of Massachusetts (his home state). *bl*cf*ia*tf\n\nCD 02942: Lucinda Williams: Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. Three-time Grammy winner (including this album) Lucinda Williams has been out there refining her craft since the mid-1970s, but it was this 1998 album that brought her to stardom. One of America's finest songwriters, she performs in a style that combines alt-folk and alt-country, with bits and pieces of blues, rock, etc., etc. thrown in as seen effective. *ar*cf*cy*ss*wm\n\nCD 02941: Emmylou Harris: Wrecking Ball. Twelve-time Grammy winner and Country Music Hall of Fame singer Emmylou Harris gets to do pretty much as she chooses, and for this Grammy-winning Daniel Lanois-produced set she sampled from the cream of the songwriting world, including Lanois, Steve Earle, Julie Miller, Neil Young, Anna McGarrigle, Bob Dylan, Lucinda Williams, Jimi Hendrix, Gillian Welch, and Rodney Crowell. *cy*mr\n\nCD 02940: UB40: The Very Best Of, 1980-2000. UB40 is a British reggae band that formed in 1978. They have been immensely successful through the years (especially at home, where they have racked up over 25 top-twenty singles and nearly twenty top-twenty albums), with hits such as 'Red Red Wine,' 'Can't Help Falling in Love,' and 'I Got You Babe' (with Chrissie Hynde). *rg\n\nCD 02939: Gordon Lightfoot: The United Artists Collection. This is a two-CD set of the Gordon Lightfoot of \"the early years,\" before he turned pop with songs like 'Sundown.' Now an elder statesman of the folk (especially Canadian folk) scene, Lightfoot's early career in the 1960s blended a traditional sound with a contemporary edge, and banked on his fine singing, guitar-playing, and compositional abilities (e.g., 'For Lovin Me' and 'Early Morning Rain'). *cf*tf\n\nCD 02938: Asleep at the Wheel: Tribute to Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys. This 1994 tribute to the leading light of Western swing music features an amazing array of walk-ons, including Garth Brooks, Dolly Parton, Huey Lewis, Merle Haggard, Vince Gill, Lyle Lovett, Willie Nelson, Chet Atkins, etc. *cy\n\nCD 02937: Amazing Blondel: Evensong/Fantasia Lindum. Amazing Blondel was a short-lived early 70s group from England that played a strange but pleasant hybrid of contemporary folk and Renaissance music. If you enjoy either or both the Incredible String Band or Dowland pieces for lute, you might very well find them quite entertaining. *ar\n\nCD 02936: A Tribe Called Quest: The Anthology. This highly influential American hip-hop group, formed in 1988, \"is generally regarded as pioneers of alternative rap music, having helped to pave the way for socially aware hip-hop artists. All Music Guide calls them 'the most intelligent, artistic rap group during the 1990s' [from wikipedia.org]. This generous 19-track CD surveys their first ten years, during which they produced five original albums distinguished by a not-over-the-top social consciousness, humor, and jazz accents. *hi*pc*ss\n\nCD 02935: Van Morrison: Astral Weeks. \"Astral Weeks is a folk-rock and r & b album...released in November 1968 on Warner Bros. Records. Astral Weeks was critically acclaimed upon its first release. It has often been placed on the most authoritative lists of best albums of all time: in the 1995 MOJO list of 100 Best Albums it was listed as #2 and was #19 on the Rolling Stone Magazine's The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time in 2003. It became and remains a cult favourite, despite the fact that it failed to achieve significant mainstream sales success for decades\" [from wikipedia.org]. *cf*rb*rk\n\nCD 02934: Joe Jackson: Night and Day. Singer-songwriter-pianist Joe Jackson has an easy style that fits somewhere between jazz and pop: light entertainment, but with a decided touch of sophistication. This 1982 CD was his breakout work. *jz*mr*pf*ss\n\nCD 02933: Al Di Meola: Consequence of Chaos. Al Di Meola has won more Downbeat jazz guitarist of the year awards than he has wallspace to display. This highly successful 2006 release has him playing both electric and acoustic instruments in a variety of forms ranging from fusion to Spanish classical to \"modern jazz.\" Sidemen include Chick Corea, John Patitucci, and Barry Miles. *ag*eg*jz*mr\n\nCD 02932: Sex Pistols: Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols. The Sex Pistols formed in London in 1975. Their one studio album--this one--caused a revolution within rock and led to the punk movement in the U. K. 'God Save the Queen' from this release is probably the single most famous song from the genre. *ar\n\nCD 02931: Ryan Adams: Heartbreaker. Singer-songwriter Adams' solo career began with this well-received release in 2000. Within a year it was on to even greater successes with collaborations with Willie Nelson, television ads, Grammy nominations, etc. etc. Adams performs in a style touching on folk, country rock, alt-country, and rock. *cf*cy*rk*ss\n\nCD 02930: Rob Wasserman: Trios. A set of (mostly) trios with Wasserman on electric standup bass, and various notables. Quite notable, actually, including: Brian Wilson, Jerry Garcia, Willie Dixon, Elvis Costello, Neal Young, Bruce Hornsby, and Chris Whitley, among others. *ac\n\nCD 02929: Arlo Guthrie: Amigo. Arlo Guthrie may still be best known for 'Alice's Restaurant,' but he's put out a lot of other good recordings through the years. This is one of them, a topical and other issues-oriented work from 1976 that would have made his father proud. *cf*pc*ss\n\nCD 02800: Clifton Chenier: Zydeco Dynamite (anthology). A great 40 track, two-CD anthology of the leading light of zydeco music. *ca\n\nCD 02769: George Thorogood: Live. George Thorogood plays a powerful brand of small venue (re: bar) electric blues that has made him a mainstay act up and down the Middle Atlantic coast. From time to time he reels out a national-level hit (e.g. 'Bad to the Bone'), but mostly he is a regional artist--one who is especially effective live in concert. *bl*rk\n\nCD 02768: Mamadou Diabate: Heritage. Mamadou Diabate, a kora player from Mali, has made a rapid ascendence within the international folk scene, including winning the \"World Music Artist Of The Year\" from the American Folk Alliance in 2006. This is virtuoso music; the kora is a traditional Afrifcan string instrument that produces a flowing, bubbling sound resembling both a harp and a harpsichord. *ac*ia*tf\n\nCD 02767: Mamadou Diabate: Behmanka. Mamadou Diabate, a kora player from Mali, has made a rapid ascendence within the international folk scene, including winning the \"World Music Artist Of The Year\" from the American Folk Alliance in 2006. This is virtuoso music; the kora is a traditional Afrifcan string instrument that produces a flowing, bubbling sound resembling both a harp and a harpsichord. *ac*ia*tf\n\nCD 02756: The Fisk Jubilee Singers: In Bright Mansions. Hailing from Fisk University in Nashville, these are the latest incarnation of the group that traces its famous history back to the 1870s. At that time proceeds from their early tours helped save the University from financial ruin. The present recording features a program of eighteen spirituals, including readings of many of the most famous songs in that genre. 'Accompanied by an especially informative guide booklet. *re*tf\n\nCD 02736: Anouar Brahem: Le Voyage de Sahar. After a string of first-rate releases Brahem has become one of the European jazz label ECM's top attractions. Brahem, an oud player from Tunisia now living in Paris, specializes in intimate, atmospheric chamber jazz works in the mood of North Africa or the Middle East; here his sidemen are on the accordion and piano. Sometimes sombre, sometimes reflective, sometimes flashy, but always affecting. *ia*im*jz*na\n\nCD 02730: Blue Cheer: Vincebus Eruptum. Well, if you're a rock 'n roll historian you know that this is a key title in the evolution of heavy metal rock. Blue Cheer's material has sometimes been referred to as \"proto-metal psychedelia\"; one thing's for sure, their version of 'Summertime Blues' sure was a sensation when it was released in 1968. *rk\n\nCD 02729: The Dixie Hummingbirds: Thank You for One More Day. A collection of songs celebrating the 70th (!) anniversary of this enduring Gospel singing group--it was way back in 1928 that 12-year old James Davis, eventually to become the group's leader, got together with some of his pals to start singing regularly as an a capella group. One of their best known works (recorded both by themselves alone, and later with Paul Simon), 'Loves Me Like a Rock,' is included in this set. *re\n\nCD 02713: Seekers of the Truth: The Complete Piano Music of Georges I. Gurdjieff and Thomas de Hartmann Vol. 1. In this two-CD set pianist Cecil Lytle explores the piano music of the great Greek-Armenian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff and his amanuensis Thomas de Hartmann. This is very spare, spiritually emotional music. *cl*is*pf\n\nCD 02712: Anoushka Shankar: Rise. Ravi Shankar's daughter Anoushka released this Western-influenced CD of small forces-based sitar and keyboards music to excellent reviews in 2005. *cl*is*jz\n\nCD 02711: Bruce Springsteen: We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions. Ever since his album Nebraska Springsteen has shown a strong interest in folk music, and in this 2006 CD (with accompanying DVD) he sets out a program of largely traditional material, dedicated to the influence of Pete Seeger. *cf*tf\n\nCD 02709: Steve Tilston: Such & Such. Tilston is one of England's finest tunesmith-lyricist-singer-guitarists, though he is little known here. He specializes in adroitly written mini-stories accompanied by dazzling fingerpicking in a contemporary folk style. This CD was rated the number one release for 2004 as considered by the listeners to leading folk radio station WUMB in Massachusetts (the second time Tilston has achieved this honor)--an amazing accomplishment, considering the fact that the work was not even available in the U.S. at that point. *ag*cf*ss\n\nCD 02707: Harry Partch: Delusion of the Fury. Partch, who died in 1974, was one of America's most original and iconoclastic musical voices. He was influenced by folk music, American Indian and ancient Greek forms, and African and Asian music, and devised a whole family of unique instruments to play his own compositions, which were based on just intonation theory. But he also spent many of his years as a hobo and alcoholic, and this theatre piece of his--a first recording--reflects some of his general alienation with the musical establishment. *cl\n\nCD 02703: Shahram Shiva: Rumi: Lovedrunk. \"Rumi is the greatest exponent of the ecstatic intoxication of sacred love. Shahram Shiva, Rumi translator, performer and author, captures the essence of the poet's message through his passionate performances. This union of spoken verse and music melds magic with love\" [from the liner notes]. This is pretty remarkable stuff--if you like the narrated form, give this a listen! *is\n\nCD 02702: Sigur Rós: Takk. I can't help thinking that this Icelandic band's creations sound like the music of the rock supergroup Yes either (or both) played at the wrong speed, or backward. In any case, there's a lot of expansiveness to their sound, which neither quite qualifies as rock or as ambient while approaching symphonic in attitude. *ar*na*rk\n\nCD 02701: Big Brother & the Holding Company, Featuring Janis Joplin. A classic blues/rock album from 1967, featuring vocals by the legendary singer Janis Joplin. Includes one of the group's two significant top forty hits, 'Down on Me.' *rk\n\nCD 02700: Philip Glass: Orion. \"Orion is a live recording of the ninety-minute work commissioned by Arts, Dance, and Music Productions which premiered in Athens on June 3, 2004 (with The Philip Glass Ensemble) as part of the Cultural Olympiad in Greece. The recording features Eleftheria Arvanitaki vocalist, Mark Atkins on didjerido, Wu Man on pipa, Gaurav Mazumdar performing a sitar work by Ravi Shakar, Ashley MacIsaac on fiddle, Foday Musa Suso on kora, and the Brazilian ensemble Uakti...Glass's desire was to create a 'truly multi-cultural, international music work'...Those familiar with Glass's music will have an idea about what to expect--minimalist motifs repeated over and over, subtly changing both rhythmically and harmonically\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *cl*na\n\nCD 02699: Swan Silvertones: My Rock/Love Lifted Me. A special \"twofer\" collection of material by this eminent gospel group, led by the phenomenal singing of Claude Jeter. Includes hits such as 'Trouble in My Way,' 'The Day Will Surely Come,' and 'How I Got Over.' *re\n\nCD 02698: Irma Thomas: True Believer. Thomas cut this CD at about the age of fifty in 1992, at the top of her powers (though she was pretty impressive even back in the early 1960s when she first came to prominence). She is sometimes called \"The Soul Queen of New Orleans,\" and indeed her influences are fairly obviously connected to that city, including big doses of the blues, jazz, and r & b. *bl*ca*rb\n\nCD 02697: Jade Warrior: Jade Warrior. Wow--a flash from the past... The reissue of a 1971 album by this one-time cult group whose music has recently experienced something of a renaissance. Why? Because it is at one time avant-garde while often being uncommonly ethereal and beautiful, half the time sounding like Jethro Tull and the other half, like modern-day Bill Frisell or any number of dreamy New Age acts. *ar*na*rk\n\nCD 02696: Jerry Lee Lewis: Last Man Standing. Hey, haven't you always wanted to hear a CD comprised of new performances by Jimmy Page, Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr, Merle Haggard, Rod Stewart, Willie Nelson, Kid Rock, Eric Clapton, Little Richard, Kris Kristofferson, John Fogerty, Neil Young, Mick Jagger, George Jones, B. B. King, Buddy Guy, Don Henley, Keith Richards, and Robbie Robertson? If so, and if you're a Jerry Lee Lewis fan to boot, here's your chance! *pf*rk\n\nCD 02695: The Clash: London Calling. \"The Clash's 1979 release remains an audacious rock landmark, and is considered by many fans to be the greatest album of the original British punk movement...the quartet confidently stretching its musical approach to embrace elements of reggae, R & B, rockabilly and jazz, while broadening its political consciousness to explore new lyrical insights\" [from the CD back cover]. *ar*pc*rk\n\nCD 02694: Can: Monster Movie. Can was like no other group before or since. During the late 70s they were the last word in experimental avant garde rock 'n roll, leaning on improvisation, percussive sounds, electronics, and rhythmically repetitive, dreamy (but not lush) instrumental interludes. One of this album's cuts, the hypnotic 'You Doo Right,' was excerpted from a day-long long improvisational session (that is, the boys were playing along for some twenty-four hours straight!). Highly recommended! *ar*rk\n\nCD 02693: Mercan Dede: Su. This is music of the Middle East (you can almost smell the camels...), as interpreted by expatriate Mercan Dede (now a Canadian resident), a devotee of Sufi sounds and moods. 'With lots of wordless vocals, wailing flutes and violins, percussion, and electronica--and even some fairly strong jazz influences. *is*na\n\nCD 02692: Cirque du Soleil: Kà. Cirque du Soleil is a Montreal-based theatre group that specializes in acrobatics, pantomime and dance productions linked to particular subject themes (recently they gained international attention with their show fashioned around Beatle tunes), and performed to composed music (one might call these \"circus ballets\"). The music involved is kind of hard to describe, since it integrates various elements of world, theater, classical, New Age and ambient styles--but more often than not is dramatically inspired, sounding something like an updating of the Carmina Burana. *ar*na\n\nCD 02691: Cirque du Soleil: Allegria. Cirque du Soleil is a Montreal-based theatre group that specializes in acrobatics, pantomime and dance productions linked to particular subject themes (recently they gained international attention with their show fashioned around Beatle tunes), and performed to composed music (one might call these \"circus ballets\"). The music involved is kind of hard to describe, since it integrates various elements of world, theater, classical, New Age and ambient styles--but more often than not is dramatically inspired, sounding something like an updating of the Carmina Burana. *ar*na\n\nCD 02690: Kate Rusby: The Girl Who Couldn't Fly. A 2005 CD from the English singer who is probably this generation's finest interpreter of British traditional material. It's all in her voice--exquisitely sensitive and feminine. Actually, the most remarkable cut on the album is her melancholy rendition of 'You Belong to Me', an old standard from the 50s and 60s made a hit by, among others, Patti Page, Jo Stafford, and the Duprees: \"See the pyramids along the Nile...\" *cf*tf\n\nCD 02689: Ralph Towner: Time Line. \"To me, this is the best of the solo guitar sets by Towner since Solo Concert. To my ears, he hits a cool balance of improvisational fluency, attention to form and flow and the one-man-trio feel he attributes to Bill Evans. Really beautiful, with a live, spacious sound accurately capturing the resonant hall in which it was recorded\" [from an Amazon.com customer review]. *ag*cl*jz\n\nCD 02688: Vangelis: China. \"Vangelis displays through this brief set of pieces a candid array of 'clichés'; but these 'clichés' he conveys (or rather: skilfully mimics) are also exactly that for the Chinese THEMSELVES: those are some of the rutinary devices of their music, their musical commonplaces, so to speak. China could well be, in some of its best moments...quite a beautiful musical instance of what the ancient Greeks called MIMESIS, not a mere servile imitation of a given model but the delicate rendition of a much more subtle likeness...\" [from an Amazon.com customer review]. *im*na\n\nCD 02687: Todd Rundgren: Something/Anything? Todd Rundgren doesn't quite get the respect he deserves--most of what he has put out for top forty consumption admittedly is pretty lightweight, but behind the scenes he has been an important force in the development of the popular music industry. This two-CD set is of material that first saw the light of day in 1972, moreover, is entirely weightier fare. *mr*rk\n\nCD 02686: Ali Farka Touré & Toumani Diabaté: In the Heart of the Moon. Two of West Africa's most celebrated musicians collaborate here in wonderful style. The late (2006) Ali Farka Touré was an acoustic blues guitarist; Toumani Diabaté is a virtuoso on the kora, a stringed instrument that sounds like a cross between a harp and a harpsichord. The resulting instrumental synthesis gets my vote in the \"music least likely to be disliked by any discriminating listener\" competition. *ac*ag*ia\n\nCD 02685: Bill Frisell: East/West. A two-CD live set by the ever-busy Bill Frisell, one of today's great jazz guitarists. Frisell has technical chops, but mostly he excels at choice of material and an uncanny ability to integrate instrumental styles and moods: this slow, ambling fare is equally successful as background music, or for supporting more intensive musings. Includes original pieces by Frisell, but also his renditions of many familiar works such as 'Shenandoah,' 'A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,' 'I Heard It Through the Grapevine,' 'Days of Wine and Roses,' and 'Goodnight Irene.' *eg*jz\n\nCD 02684: Kate Rusby: 10. Affective and attractive Brit Kate Rusby celebrates her tenth year as a professional musician with this set, released in 2003. Rusby is one of the brightest lights on the English folk circuit at the moment, and this CD proves that she can write her own material as well as cover traditional songs. *cf*ss*tf\n\nCD 02683: Echo and the Bunnymen: Heaven Up Here. \"Digitally remastered and expanded version of the Bunnymen's Second Album. The mood...is much darker and more intense than their debut album...The songs tend to be more atmospheric and textured as well...The five bonus tracks include an extended version of 'Broke My Neck' and four previously-unreleased live tracks. The package also includes new liner notes and plenty of photos in the booklet...\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *ar*rk\n\nCD 02682: Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Jajouka. The story behind this recording is pretty remarkable, but too long to relate here. Basically, it concerns the interest Brian Jones (the late original guitarist for the Rolling Stones) took in the music connected with the pagan rites of an ancient sect in Morocco. This is, in fact, World music--and pretty elemental at that--but it is revealing to recognize Jones as an early pioneer in its promotion. With interesting liner note comments by Paul Bowles, William S. Burroughs, and others. *ia\n\nCD 02681: Fairfield Four: Standing in the Safety Zone. A 1992 issue from one of the leading acts in gospel music, Nashville's Fairfield Four. The group was one of that genre's big names back in the 1940s, but then disbanded for many years, only to reunite in 1980. *re\n\nCD 02680: David Bowie: The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars. The early (1972) glam-rock release featuring Bowie in his Ziggy Stardust days, with Mick Ronson on guitar. *ar*rk\n\nCD 02679: Faces: A Nod Is as Good as a Wink... Ah, a return to the days of Mod, and a young Rod Stewart fronting this straight ahead, blues-influenced, rock band that emerged from the ashes of the earlier, and equally successful, Small Faces. The new incarnation included, along with Stewart, Ronnie Lane and Ron Wood (later to become the lead guitarist for the Rolling Stones). *rk\n\nCD 02678: Bonnie Raitt: Bonnie Raitt. This is Bonnie Raitt's debut album, from 1971--at a time when she was best known as \"John Raitt's daughter\" (Raitt sr. was a major Broadway star), and before Mr. Raitt ended up being most known as \"Bonnie Raitt's father.\" Raitt is basically a blues singer/guitarist, but sometimes she veers into rock, pop, and r & b. *ag*bl*eg*rk\n\nCD 02677: Clifton Chenier: The Best Of. Sometimes referred to as \"the King of Zydeco,\" the late (1925-1987) Clifton Chenier needs no further build-up here. *ca\n\nCD 02676: Cheb i Sabbah: La Kahena. \"On his new CD, named for a 7th-century freedom fighter, the Algerian mixmaster DJ Cheb i Sabbah takes the music of the North Africa and Moorish Spain on a magic carpet ride that floats electronica/techno effects over Berber, Jewish, Black African, and Arab instruments and genres, with vocals by some of world music's most evocative female singers\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *el*ia\n\nCD 02675: Paul Simon: Surprise. Paul Simon may not still be crazy after all these years, but he is still one of music's biggest names, and here is his latest (2006) work. *ss\n\nCD 02674: Ennio Morricone: Once Upon a Time... The Essential Ennio Morricone Film Music Collection. A two-CD set of spaghetti-western music from films such as The Good the Bad and the Ugly and A Fistful of Dollars, plus more recent material from, among others, The Untouchables, The Mission, The Thing, and Hamlet. Morricone received a special honorary Oscar at the 2007 Academy Awards ceremony. *fl*mr\n\nCD 02673: Jon Hassell: Maarifa Street. \"In an era of world fusions and unlikely global collaborations, Jon Hassell continues reformulating the alchemy of his Fourth World music in fascinating and original ways. Maarifa Street is his first electric album in some time, and it's a deliriously seductive brew of Miles Davis-meets-dub stuttered through sampled groove fractures. Drawn from live recordings made over the last few years, the album illustrates Hassell's gift for carving soundscapes in real time, laying his breathy, harmonized trumpet lines across an interior panorama of ambient voodoo jazz\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *el*im*jz\n\nCD 02672: Frank Zappa & the Mothers of Invention: Freak Out! Very early Frank Zappa (circa 1966) at his irreverent and startlingly original best. When Frank died in 1993 Suzy Creamcheese must have cried her heart out... *ar*eg*rk*ss\n\nCD 02671: Moby: Hotel. This two-CD set from one of this generation's most flexible musical minds features an array of twenty-five pieces ranging from introspective vocal works to movie-like instrumentals to electronic ambient and New Age constructions. This is the music of a peaceful, focussed, and responsible man. Moby's music starts from a Christian perspective, but here the inspiration and message is implicit, always avoiding preaching or barking. *am*ar*el*im*ss\n\nCD 02670: Gary Numan: Hybrid. There's a lot of angst and anger expressed in this 2003 two-CD release, but Numan is a sophisticated artist and manages to filter it through enough beats and electronics to come out sounding more mysterious than p.-o.'d. Still, pretty dark and intense as a set. *ar*el*rk\n\nCD 02669: Brian Eno: Another Day on Earth. \"Another Day on Earth is an ambient song cycle that is full of yearning and a mood that Brian Eno has called 'brave and resigned.' Even in song, Eno is a master of ambience, creating detailed soundworlds and lyrics that don't so much make sense as create a feeling. It's taken him 15 years to create a new vocal album, and the songs span that time, with the welcome reprise of 'Under,' a devastatingly beautiful hymn of loss and redemption...\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *am*na*ss\n\nCD 02668: Allen Toussaint: Southern Nights. A classic concept album from 1975, with great songs and performances by one of New Orleans' top r & b performers. Toussaint's career began in the 1950s, but he's still going strong. Toussaint is best known as a pianist and songwriter; among his best known titles are 'Working in a Coal Mine' and 'Brickyard Blues.' *ca*pf*rb\n\nCD 02667: Youssou NDour: Immigrés. \"Youssou's stunning international debut was both a patriotic appeal to his Senegalese compatriots living abroad and a declaration of his intent to make his music heard around the world...Immigrés, with its rattling percussion, strong melodies and pulsating West African horns shows N'Dour at his best...The intoxicating percussion lets rip, the brass is crisp, and the clarity of both the lead guitar and Youssou's swoon-inducing vocals is astounding...\" [from the CD back cover]. *is*ss\n\nCD 02666: Velvet Underground: White Light/White Heat. This classic album from 1968 was the VU's second, with both John Cale and Lou Reed still aboard, and the performances raw and intense. *ar*rk\n\nCD 02665: Patty Griffin: 1000 Kisses. Nominated for a 2003 Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, this is Patty Griffin as a mature artist. Although a bit hard to classify, her material falls somewhere in the vicinity of contemporary folk, alt-country, folk-rock, or singer-songwriter. *cf*ss\n\nCD 02664: Harold Budd: As Long As I Can Hold My Breath / Avalon Sutra. The inimitable (and supposedly retiring from music) Harold Budd leaves us with a two-CD collection of his minimalistic New Age/jazz piano playing and small ensemble work. Most of the material can only be described visually in terms of gently falling snow. *ac*na*pf\n\nCD 02663: Bob Marley & the Wailers: Burnin' (deluxe edition). This expanded two-CD version of the original milestone album includes alternate takes of 'Get Up Stand Up' ('I Shot the Sheriff' is also in this set) and a whole CD devoted to a live performance at Leeds, England, in 1973, previously unreleased. *pc*rg*ss\n\nCD 02662: Burning Spear: Marcus Garvey. Burning Spear, aka Winston Rodney, has a fascination with the story of the life of Jamaican publisher and civil rights advocate Marcus Garvey (1887-1940). This album is dedicated to Garvey's memory, and relays Rodney's philosophy of black unity as advocated through a foundation of honesty, peace, and love. *pc*rg\n\nCD 02661: Ray Davies: Other People's Lives. The term \"songwriter's songwriter\" is often bandied about to describe songwriters whose sensitivity to lyrics and story is so great as to impress other songwriters, much less fans. Ray Davies, long the lead singer of and inspirational force behind the English band The Kinks, is one of these people; in fact, he ranks among the most prominent and prolific of them all. Strangely, this 2006 CD is Davies' first solo album, but it looks like he still has things to say. *ss\n\nCD 02660: Judy Mowatt: Black Woman. Jamaican singer Judy Mowatt started her career in the late 60s as a reggae performer (though more recently she has turned to gospel singing). Mowatt worked closely with Bob Marley for a number of years. This CD, originally from 1980, was one of her biggest successes. *pc*rg*wm\n\nCD 02659: Beck: Mellow Gold. This 1994 release by Beck was his first on a major label. Characterizing his music is a bit difficult, as he draws on a variety of contemporary styles ranging from folk to grunge. 'Always the storyteller, however. *ar*rk*ss\n\nCD 02656: James Brown: Live at the Apollo, 1962. Expanded edition. Here we are, in the early days of James Brown's career, at the Apollo Theater, that most-famous-of-all venues of African American popular music. This is truly one of greatest recorded live performances in the history of American music. A 1998 addition to the Grammy Hall of Fame. *rb\n\nCD 02649: Carla Bley: Sextet. This Carla Bley set was recorded back in the late 80s for the ECM label--which means a rather straight-ahead but abstract-sounding European kind of jazz. Carla Bley is on the organ; among the other five players is the well known bassist Steve Swallow. *jz\n\nCD 02645: Joni Mitchell: Blue. Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell was one of the 1970s' most successful performers. This 1971 album, one of her best releases, includes memorable tracks such as 'Carey,' 'A Case of You,' and 'All I Want.' *cf*ss*wm\n\nCD 02636: Alan Stivell: Zoom 70 / 95. A 2-CD survey of the man who more than anyone else was responsible for the worldwide Celtic music revival over the last third of the twentieth century. Includes 35 cuts in all, ranging from solo Celtic harp pieces to an array of string and electric band group ensembles. *ac*ce*cf*ie\n\nCD 02635: Tin Hat Trio: Memory Is An Elephant. In this 1999 CD the Trio is up to its usual tricks, which means atmospheric acoustic pieces featuring violin, accordion, and guitar-banjo-mandolin, and ranging in style from French cabaret to avant garde experimental \"New\" music recalling jazz and classical forms. *ac*im\n\nCD 02634: Ralph McTell: From Clare to Here: The Songs of Ralph McTell. Englishman McTell is one of the few contemporary folkies to mark a number one hit (with 'Streets of London'), but his catalogue at this point contains dozens of other covered songs, including the title cut. McTell is also a very fine acoustic guitarist and an affecting singer, but here the focus is on songwriting. *ag*cf*ss\n\nCD 02633: The Horse Flies: Gravity Dance. This 1991 release is one of the best by this enduring string band, who seem to be able to handle just about any kind of rootsy material in the general realm of alt-country or alt-folk. *ac*cf*cy\n\nCD 02632: Patrick Ball: The Music of Turlough O'Carolan. Ball is pretty much the leading Celtic harpist, especially among those who favor traditional approaches. In this work he takes on history's most famous composer for the instrument, the 17th/18th century blind itinerant Irish bard Turlough O'Carolan. *ac*cl*tf\n\nCD 02631: Ferron: Not a Still Life. Canadian Ferron is a \"folk singer/songwriter and poet. In addition to being one of Canada's most famous folk musicians, she is one of the most influential writers and performers of women's music, and an important influence on later musicians such as Ani DiFranco and the Indigo Girls\" [from wikipedia.org]. This is a live album from 1992. *cf*ss*wm\n\nCD 02626: Aster Aweke: Live in London. \"There's no mistaking Aster Aweke's primary influences. Listen, for example, to her early '90s albums...with their Memphis-style horn section, soulful keyboards and crackling drums, and it's immediately apparent why she's sometimes been dubbed the 'African Aretha Franklin.' Lady Soul, along with the Godfather, James Brown, and vocally versatile jazz singers such as Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan, loom largely in her roots, her deep R&B/funk groove a reminder that bridges are meant to be crossed\" [from globalrhythm.net]. Ethiopian Aweke has a strong following among American expatriates from that nation. *ia*jz*rb\n\nCD 02625: Cherish the Ladies: New Day Dawning. Cherish the Ladies is an ever-changing group of woman musicians who sing and play acoustic folk music from the world tradition--though usually with a decided Celtic emphasis. This offering indeed features British Isles music, including a rousing version of the well known Robert Burns song, 'Green Grow the Rushes Oh.' *ac*cf*ie*tf\n\nCD 02624: Roy Harper: Stormcock. Roy Harper has never become very well known in the U.S., though in Britain he has a considerable reputation as a sensitive singer-songwriter in a contemporary folk mold. This CD is one of his early efforts, from 1971, and features four long pieces of contemplative nature performed solo, on voice and guitar. *ac*cf*ss\n\nCD 02623: James Blood Ulmer: Odyssey. This is \"a very different and exciting recording from a unique and instantly recognizable guitar voice. It also poignantly captures a period of bold musical experimentation in downtown early 1980's New York City when funk, punk, jazz, and blues were seamlessly co-mingling, and young lions in three-piece suits were only beginning to xerox jazz's past\" [from the liner notes]. *ar*eg*jz\n\nCD 02622: Dougie MacLean: The Dougie MacLean Collection. This is a \"best of\" collection of the songs of Dougie MacLean, one of the leading singer/songwriters of the new Celtic/British folk scene. MacLean is known as a singer of both traditional and original materials, but here the latter are featured. *ac*cf*ss\n\nCD 02621: Big Bad Voodoo Daddy: Big Bad Voodoo Daddy. Here's a brass- and piano-centered band that is right at home with a variety of familiar upbeat styles: boogie-woogie, swing, mambo, dixieland, and big band jazz, to name a few. Includes both vocal and instrumental pieces. *ca*jz*mr\n\nCD 02620: Terje Rypdal & The Chasers: Blue. Norwegian Rypdal is one of that rare breed of electric jazz guitarists who composes works that are often cross-listed in classical music catalogues. He claims as some of his influences Jimi Hendrix, Hank Marvin (of the Shadows), Jeff Beck, Stevie Winwood, Eddie Van Halen, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, Charlie Byrd, and John McLaughlin. *eg*jz\n\nCD 02619: Christy Moore: The Christy Moore Collection 81-91. Christy Moore, onetime leader of the band Planxty, is fast becoming the leading elder statesman of the Irish contemporary folk scene. In this retrospective program of twenty traditional and contemporary songs (composed by himself, and others) the earlier firebrand of political criticism plies somewhat more reflective waters. *cf*ie*pc*ss*tf\n\nCD 02618: Koko Taylor: Queen of the Blues. The title says it all--except to indicate the wonderful sidemen here: Albert Collins, James Cotton, Son Seals, and Lonnie Brooks. *bl\n\nCD 02617: Joan Armatrading: Me Myself I. Joan Armatrading's music programs range in just about as many directions as anyone's can--blues, MOR, contemporary folk, jazz, singer/songwriter, West Indian--but ultimately are held together by her remarkable, almost masculine, voice. This is early Joan, from 1980. *bl*cf*rb*ss\n\nCD 02616: Philip Glass: Music in Twelve Parts. \"'Music in Twelve Parts,' written by Philip Glass between 1971 and 1974, is a deliberate, encyclopedic compendium of some techniques of repetition the composer had been evolving since the mid 1960s...[It is] both a massive theoretical exercise and a deeply engrossing work of art\" [from the liner notes]. Glass is one of the originators of and leading figures in the style known as \"minimalism.\" *cl\n\nCD 02615: Ani DiFranco: Not a Pretty Girl. This 1995 CD from DiFranco (put out by \"Righteous Babe\" Records...) helped land her at the top of the heap in the alt-folk category. DiFranco has a confessional style of writing that complements her short black hair and punk jewelry, clothes and attitude, and an interesting vocal (reminds me of Laurie Anderson) delivery that is well served by her percussive (reminds me of Patty Larkin) guitar play. *cf*ss*wm\n\nCD 02614: Bill Miller: The Red Road. Bill Miller brings a Native American perspective to his singing and songwriting. Some of his material verges on contemporary folk, while other tracks revert to a very traditional sound making use of flutes and Native American dances--or, even, both directions on the same piece. *ac*cf*in*ss\n\nCD 02613: Sergio & Odair Assad: Play Piazzolla. The internationally-acclaimed Assad brother team here teams up to play the music of the late Astor Piazzolla, leader of the \"new tango\" school of classical music. *ag*cl\n\nCD 02612: Luther Allison: Soul Fixin' Man. \"Magnificent, emotion-drenched electric blues...his solos are on a par with B. B. King's, his slide swoops and soars. His gritty voice choked with passion, Luther delivers a fever-and-chills performance\" [from the liner notes]. *bl*eg\n\nCD 02536: Neil Young & Crazy Horse: Rust Never Sleeps. One of folk-rocker Neil Young's most successful albums, originally released in 1979. \"My my, hey hey, rock and roll is here to stay. It's better to burn out than to fade away...\" (from 'My My, Hey Hey'). *rk*ss\n\nCD 02535: Dave Swarbrick: Smiddyburn & Flittin'. England's premier traditional/contemporary fiddler Dave Swarbrick has made a successful career as a longtime member of Fairport Convention while involving himself in solo projects or in collaboration with that other English stalwart of the folk revival, singer and guitarist Martin Carthy. This \"twofer\" collection combines works originally released in 1981, and features the backing of various members of Fairport. *ac*cf*ie*tf\n\nCD 02534: Philip Aaberg: High Plains. The first (1985) release by this well-travelled pianist (he also works in rock, blues and classical contexts, with people like Mike Marshall, Bernie Krause, Elvin Bishop, Peter Gabriel, John Hiatt and Roy Rogers). His solo piano work, as here, is light, brisk, and atmospheric, reminding one at times of George Winston or a somewhat more aesthetically involved Jim Brickman. *pf*na\n\nCD 02533: The Smiths: The Queen Is Dead. A classic rock album from 1986 from the English band led by Morrissey (vocals) and Johnny Marr (guitars). *rk\n\nCD 02532: Carrie Newcomer: My Father's Only Son. \"Indiana's Carrie Newcomer would seem to be the very model of the modern folk musician. She quickly dispels that notion, however, with the very first song . . . before Newcomer even opens her mouth, her folk-rock band shatters any possible mood of introspection with a twangy electric guitar riff and soulful organ chords . . . Newcomer sings, celebrating such pop-music prejudices as action over thought and passion over prudence. Not every song on My Father's Only Son escapes the endemic carefulness of coffeehouse folk as successfully as 'Crazy in Love,' [however,] and Newcomer sometimes gives in to whispery quaintness\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *cf*ss*wm\n\nCD 02531: The Firesign Theatre: Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand Me the Pliers. This 1970 stream-of-consciousness concept album is a comedy classic, though not of the variety featuring one-liners. Think more in terms of the radio theatre of Garrison Keillor or Riders in the Sky, but at at least two higher levels of esoterism... Google \"Georgie Tirebiter\" and see what you get. *cm\n\nCD 02530: Martin Carthy, Norma Waterson & Eliza Carthy: Waterson : Carthy. A program of traditional songs brilliantly performed by two generations of the Carthy/Waterson clan (Martin C. on guitar and vocals, Norma W. on vocals, and Eliza C. on fiddle and vocals), one of the first families of British folk. *ie*tf\n\nCD 02529: Sweet Honey in the Rock: Live at Carnegie Hall. A classic live performance by Bernice Johnson Reagon and friends featuring a splendid program of gospel-tinged folk, blues, traditional, and international vocal music. *bl*cf\n\nCD 02528: The Pogues: If I Should Fall From Grace With God. This 1988 release captured The Pogues at their \"punk-folk\" best, with leader Shane McGowan contributing his usual brilliant songwriting and lyrics and boozy, slurred vocals. Includes an appearance by the late Kirsty MacColl (who died in 2000 saving her son in a motorboat accident) on the hit song 'Fairytale of New York', and six bonus tracks. *pc*rk*ss\n\nCD 02527: Jane Siberry: When I Was a Boy. Canadian Siberry is perhaps best known for co-writing (with k. d. lang) the song 'Calling All Angels,' included here. Siberry has sometimes been described as having created a \"post-punk\" folk style emulating Joni Mitchell; I think I could buy that, though she also seems to succumb to a confessional approach from time to time. This release features contributions by Michael Brook and Brian Eno. *cf*wm\n\nCD 02526: Los Lobos: How Will the Wolf Survive? Los Lobos is basically a rock band, but in their music one can hear strong echoes of Tex-Mex, country, blues, r & b, and even traditional Spanish culture themes. This album was their first major work and it created a considerable sensation when it was released in 1984; the band has been a mainstay act ever since. *bl*rb*rk\n\nCD 02525: Herbie Hancock: Future Shock.The highly successful 1983 jazz-funk fusion recording from virtuoso keyboards player Hancock. *jz*pf*rb\n\nCD 02524: Altan: Horse With a Heart. This 1989 debut album by County Donegal act Altan, with Frankie Kennedy at the helm, is often adjudged their finest release. The program, much of it in Gaelic, consists of a compelling set of reels, jigs, airs, and songs. Phil Cunningham and Donal Lunny sit in on some of the tracks. *cf*ie*tf\n\nCD 02523: Patrick Sky: Songs That Made America Famous. This celebrated cult title from 1973 is just about all anyone remembers Patrick Sky for at this point. Laced with profanity and satirical intent, it sets new lyrics to a program of otherwise familiar tunes from the folk, blues, country, and Americana traditions with hilarious results. No one seems to be spared: Richard Nixon, the Pope, Radcliffe girls, Okies, Robert E. Lee, rednecks, rock stars, etc., etc. *cf*cm*pc\n\nCD 02522: Clarence Gatemouth Brown: Gate Swings. Brown died in September 2005 shortly after being evacuated from the path of Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana. An influential electric blues guitarist and multi-instrumentalist, over his career Brown won eight W. C. Handy Awards, a Grammy (and was nominated for five others), and the National Academy of Arts and Sciences Heroes award. *bl*eg\n\nCD 02521: The Balfa Brothers: J'ai Vu Le Loup, Le Renard et La Belette. Cajun fiddler Dewey Balfa founded this band back in the 1960s after giving a rousing performance at the Newport Folk Festival. Balfa died in 1992, but not before succeeding in his goal of bringing the music of this genre to a much wider audience. This particular Balfa Brothers album, featuring a program of traditional songs, was released in 1976. *ca\n\nCD 02520: Peter Tosh: Scrolls of the Prophet: The Best of Peter Tosh. This collection of fifteen tracks well captures the heart and soul of the late Peter Tosh's (1944-1987) music. Tosh was one of reggae's leading voices, both in the sense of his work with Bob Marley's Wailers and as a solo artist, and as a politically uncompromising musician. *pc*rg*ss\n\nCD 02519: Grateful Dead: Workingman's Dead. This early (1970) Dead album is both one of their most celebrated, and \"rootsiest,\" including 'Uncle John's Band,' 'Cumberland Blues,' 'Casey Jones,' and 'Dire Wolf.' This CD version adds seven bonus tracks to the original lineup. *cf*rk\n\nCD 02518: Joseph Spence: The Complete Folkways Recordings 1958. Joseph Spence (1910-1984) was an inconoclastic Bahamian acoustic guitarist and blues singer. Although little known outside the folk crowd, his music and playing style have been very influential, intriguing players ranging from Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder to John Renbourn and Jerry Garcia. *ag*in*tf\n\nCD 02517: The Roches: The Collected Works Of. A 2003 nineteen cut survey of the career of this very influential \"Joisey\" urban punk folk sister vocal trio. *ar*cf*wm\n\nCD 02516: The Spencer Davis Group: The Best Of. Fifteen tracks from this highly successful mid-60s British blues band, which included a very young Stevie Winwood. Features 'Gimme Some Lovin,' recently voted in an English poll as the top rock 'n roll song in music history. *bl*rk\n\nCD 02515: Rory Block: Ain't I a Woman. Singer and virtuoso acoustic blues guitarist Rory Block released this thematic album in 1992. Guest performers include Mark Knopfler, John Hall (now Congressman John Hall, but once the leader of the band Orleans), and John Sebastian. Block's career extends back to the 60s, but she only began to receive widespread recognition in the 80s; since the 90s she has been a four-time W. C. Handy award winner. *ag*bl*wm\n\nCD 02514: Patty Larkin: I'm Fine. Features some of this Boston area guitarist-singer-songwriter's best material, including the title cut, 'Justine,' and 'Caffeine.' *cf*ss\n\nCD 02513: Stan Rogers: Fogarty's Cove. The first, and some still say best, album by the late, great Canadian folkie whose career was tragically cut short by an airplane fire. Includes the title cut, plus other well known songs by Rogers such as 'Forty-five Miles,' 'Barrett's Privateers,' and 'Watching the Apples Grow.' *ac*cf*ss\n\nCD 02512: Buffalo Springfield: Retrospective: The Best of Buffalo Springfield. A survey of the best material put to wax by this short-lived mid-1960s folk-rock supergroup, including Stephen Stills, Neil Young, Jim Messina, and Richie Furay. *rk\n\nCD 02511: Steve Earle: Guitar Town. This was the first of singer-songwriter Steve Earle's releases, and it helped earn him the 1986 Country Artist of the Year award given out by Rolling Stone magazine. Earle is one of his generation's best songwriters, having so far been nominated for eleven Grammy awards. His material often incorporates a decided left-wing political slant. *cy*ss\n\nCD 02377: 777: System 7.3 Fire + Water. \"Sprawled out across two discs of original and very remixed tracks, this is a wondrous set that combines trance, ambient, space, weirdness, jazz, and of course the pulsing and gliding guitar of Mr. [Steve] Hillage. This gets stuffed into the 'dance and DJ' pigeonhole, but really, it's so much more\" [from an Amazon.com customer review]. *am*el*ho\n\nCD 02370: Eleftheria Arvanitaki: Ola Sto Fos (Everything Brought to Light). Okay, I'd not heard of her either, but on listening one discovers an MOR soprano with only fair vocal range, but who manages to sound good across a wide selection of emotional terrain. The material is excellent (though sung in Greek, lyrics are given in English), and the backup band first-rate. Strangely, and despite her black hair, she bears a pretty strong physical and facial resemblance to Carly Simon (if one can judge from several hundred photos on the Web...). *ie\n\nCD 02368: Groundhogs: The Best Of. The Groundhogs were a three-man British blues band most active in the late 60s and early 70s. For a while they did quite well, scoring three top ten albums; this success probably can be attributed mainly to the superb playing of their guitarist leader Tony \"T. S.\" McPhee, one of the best. If you're a Stevie Ray Vaughan-style blues guitar fan, take a listen (and note the occasional obvious debt to Jimi Hendrix). *bl*rk\n\nCD 02367: Trilok Gurtu: African Fantasy. Five-time winner as jazz percussonist in the annual DownBeat polls, Bombay native Gurtu has played with an impressive list of folks, including Joe Zawinul, Pat Metheny, the Labecque sisters, John McLaughlin, Oregon, L. Shankar, Jan Garbarek, Zakir Hussain, and Don Cherry. In this 2000 CD he crosses a lot of boundaries, producing a \"jazz fantasy\" uniting South Asian and African sounds. *ac*ia*is*jz\n\nCD 02366: Klaus Schulze: X. Album number ten by this key figure in the history of electronic music, and godfather to the ambient, techno, house, and trance genres. I'll bet you know at least some of this music, even if you've never heard of Klaus Schulze himself. *am*ar*el\n\nCD 02362: Bert Jansch: Bert Jansch / It Don't Bother Me. The first two albums, circa 1965, by one of the twentieth century's most influential acoustic guitar stylists. Jansch would later form the innovative jazz-folk string band Pentangle and record memorable guitar duets with his countryman John Renbourn, but it is in these two early recordings that history was really made. *ag*cf\n\nCD 02361: Gerry Milnes and Lorraine Lee Hammond: Hell Up Coal Holler. Lorraine Lee (Hammond) has long been known as a leading dulcimer player, and here she teams with Milnes for an intimate set of traditional, rural, and mountain tunes. *ac*tf\n\nCD 02355: Sam Bush: King of My World. A 2004 release from one local boy who certainly made good. *ac*bg\n\nCD 02354: Rosco Gordon: No Dark in America. Recorded in 2002 just before the 74 year old pianist died, this set does full justice to the Memphis native's unique r & b style. Gordon was especially known for his ballads, but here enlisted a bunch of younger Nashville players who brought out the bounce and shuffle of his piano playing style, without concealing any of his famous good-naturedness. The title track, the last song Gordon completed, is a defiant yet upbeat anthem concerning the 9/11 WTC attack: \"...there's no dark, it's always light in America.\" *bl*pf*rb\n\nCD 02353: J. J. Cale: The Very Best Of. Tulsa Sound singer-songwriter J. J. Cale has been at his mix of country, rockabilly and blues for over forty years, though not always in the limelight. He is probably best known for writing two of Eric Clapton's most famous songs, 'After Midnight' and 'Cocaine.' They're both here, along with eighteen other tracks. *bl*cy*rk\n\nCD 02352: Robin Holcomb: Robin Holcomb. Gee, Robin Holcomb is really a class act. In this, her first release (from 1990), the singer-songwriter is sparse and poetic, yet absolutely gripping: \"When you're blinded to the moon and its rise, How can you know the planting times? Streetlights tell lies. Deliver me.\" The mood is enhanced by the efforts of class sidemen like Wayne Horvitz, Bill Frisell, and John Caulfield. *ss*wm\n\nCD 02351: Kaki King: Everybody Loves You. This self-produced 2003 CD was the first by King, an acoustic guitar virtuoso of the Michael Hedges-Preston Reed school of play (lots of notes produced by directly tapping the strings rather than plucking them). This is a player who stands a good chance to become one of the leading stylists of her generation. *ag\n\nCD 02350: Cowboy Junkies: Black Eyed Man. Canadian band Cowboy Junkies formed in Toronto in the mid 1980s and began a career exploring some of the more unusual sideroads of alt-rock and alt-country. This 1992 release features Margo Timmins out front on the vocals, several songs by brother and producer Michael, and a couple of very good Townes Van Zandt covers. *ar*cy\n\nCD 02349: Hüsker Dü: Zen Arcade. Generally regarded as their masterpiece and as one of the most influential recordings of the entire punk rock oeuvre, this eclectic 1984 album was Hüsker Dü's third. A concept album about an adolescent who runs away from home, the work shifts through jazz, punk, acoustic, pop, and psychedelic sequences until all is revealed as a dream in a long album-ending instrumental. *rk\n\nCD 02348: The Klezmatics: Possessed. \"Klezmatics mix jazz, folk, rock and Jewish music into a unique and powerful new sound. This album is one of the more challenging of their many works, leaping from genre to genre with seeming abandon\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *is\n\nCD 02347: The Seldom Scene: Best Of. This 1986 release captures many of the great moments from this legendary bluegrass act's stellar career, including the sensational vocals by the group's founder, the late John Duffey. *bg\n\nCD 02346: The Klezmorim: Metropolis. A 1981 recording by one of the first internationally known acts in the klezmer music genre. *is\n\nCD 02345: Adrienne Young & Little Sadie: The Art of Virtue. \"The Art of Virtue is a fun, poppy country-folk album--more folk than country and more either than pop, but nevertheless accessible while remaining true to its roots... This is a string band, featuring Young on clawhammer banjo, that knows what it's doing... Fusing past and present in her pop-inflected old time music, Adrienne Young applies a worldly compassion, a poet's pen and a spirit of independence and self-reliance to her sophomore effort\" [from two Amazon.com editorial reviews]. *cf*cy\n\nCD 02344: The Roots: Things Fall Apart. The Roots' fourth album, from 1999, and acclaimed by many as a milepost recording in the hip-hop catalog. \"It opens with a film dialogue sampled, social commentary... [leading] the listener to expect something special, and The Roots more than fulfil any expectations of the listener. It's never been their style to promote bravado and posturing and they don't fall victim to this; its more about self-awareness and social observation, coupled with elements of smooth soul and ambitious jazz\" [from an Amazon.com customer review]. *hi*rb\n\nCD 02343: Mary-Chapin Carpenter: Come On Come On. Singer-songwriter Carpenter in her best known, multi-Grammy-winning, 1992 release. *cf*cy*ss\n\nCD 02342: Sly & Robbie: In Good Company. Sly & Robbie represent one of the most famous and prolific production teams in music, their specialty being reggae. This is a 2001 collection of some of their best work, including cuts by Grace Jones, Black Uhuru, Joan Armatrading, Joe Cocker, Toots Hibbert, Dennis Brown and others. *rg\n\nCD 02341: Ani Difranco: Puddle Dive. This 1993 CD continued the Difranco image that has now become familiar: folk-punk, cute, pierced, poetic, intelligent, acoustic guitar-driven, and not afraid to say what's on her mind. 'Nice to see that such a person can still become a superstar in today's world. *cf*ss*wm\n\nCD 02340: Michael Franti & Spearhead: Stay Human. \"There aren't many hip-hop artists out there today who give a damn about putting positive messages in their music, but Michael Franti is one of them. Ever since his days with seminal group Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, Franti has infused his sounds with insightful and thought-provoking lyricism, and this latest Spearhead joint is no exception... Through a make-believe community radio station, Franti tells the tale of Sister Fatima, a healer and activist who is being put to death for a crime that her community believes she didn't commit\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *hi*rb*ss\n\nCD 02339: Luka Bloom: The Acoustic Motorbike. Luka Bloom started out as Barry Moore, Christy Moore's younger brother, then changed his name and style. This, his second album under his new persona, is probably his best so far, with lots of acoustic guitar, Irish sentimentality and emotion, and straight from the heart song writing. *cf*ss\n\nCD 02338: Cabaret Voltaire: The Original Sound of Sheffield '83 / '87; Best Of. This \"best of\" collection is \"from one of the most important groups in the history of industrial & electronic music... [it] covers their most accessible period. 'Sensoria', 'I Want You', 'Don't Argue', and 'Here to Go' not only ruled the underground scene, but the mainstream dancefloors as well. Compiled with the help of Richard H Kirk, the collection features the full 12 Inch mixes, many of which are on CD for the first time, along with one track, previously unavailable on any format\" [from an Amazon.com editorial review]. *am*el*ho\n\nCD 02337: Patty Griffin: Living With Ghosts. This was Patty Griffin's breakthrough 1996 release, a collection of her older songs set to folk rock or alt folk arrangements. Sensitive and engaging, she has since moved from one success to another, including Grammy nominations and other awards. Her songs are also becoming popular through covers by well-known artists such as the Dixie Chicks, Bette Midler, Emmylou Ha"
