        "text": "Bluegrass Unlimited\n\nJOEL MABUS\n\nPEPPER'S GHOST & OTHER BANJO VISITATIONS\n\nFossil Records #2313\n\nJoel Mabus has always been sort of a musical freak of nature, one who is not easily pigeonholed or categorized. A brilliant songwriter and singer, he is also a gifted storyteller and a very adept instrumentalist on old-time banjo and bluegrass guitar. Check out his Banjo Monologues for the former and his great old song \"Doc'sology,\" a tribute to a classic Doc Watson guitar lick, for the latter.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that Pepper's Ghost & Other Banjo Visitations seems like a medley of his many and varied talents and interests. Nine of the thirteen tracks are solo banjo instrumentals. Some, such as \"Dogs On The Davenport\" and the title track, are original compositions that show how thoroughly he has synthesized the beautifully quirky stylistic elements that make clawhammer banjo music so mesmerizing. To these he's added some great obscure discoveries, such as the nineteenth century medley \"American Patrol\" and a neoclassical piece with native American influences, \"By the Waters Of Minnetonka.\" Mabus also doesn't hesitate to take on classics such as \"Billy In The Low Ground,\" although he's at his best when he takes \"Fire On The Mountain\" and puts it through his own personal musical transmogrifier (for all us Calvin & Hobbes fans).\n\nThe effortless melding of traditional and modern that Mabus achieves on the banjo is something that he carries over skillfully to his songcraft. \"Two Little Sisters\" is a haunting extension of the vintage ballad often known as \"Wind And Rain,\" and he rewrites the folk song \"Leather Wing Bat\" and makes it a charming and moving fable that takes the listener through both his subtle turns of phrase and lovely re-harmonizing. \"Panhandle Prairie\" is a spooky tale of dissolution and regret that evokes the dusty grit that pervades the ballad's setting. His sole vocal cover tune is the 1887 hymn \"When They Ring The Golden Bells.\" Never content to let a good story go untold, Mabus frames the song with the fascinating story of its creator, one that thus far has not grown tiresome on repeated listenings.\n\nIf you've somehow managed to avoid experiencing the many talents of Joel Mabus, Pepper's Ghost & Other Banjo Visitations is an excellent entry point for appreciating how he's managed to plant himself and thrive creatively at the crossroads of traditional American folk music.\n\n(Fossil Records, P.O. Box 306, Portage, MI 49081, www.joelmabus.com.)HK\n\nAMAZON Review\n\n4 stars\n\nMabus is as adept on banjo as he is on the parlor guitar.\n\nReviewed in the United States on December 15, 2013\n\nFor past Christmases singer/songwriter/musician Joel Mabus has released a Christmas-related CD of music played on the small parlor guitar. (You can find my review of many of Mabus' albums by searching under the artist's name here on Amazon.) This year Mabus changed directions and issued this secular album in October. Putting the parlor guitar aside this time for the banjo (played claw hammer style) Mabus has mixed traditional as well as self-penned songs - and even included a spoken narrative track (\"When They Ring the Golden Bells\") with solo banjo accompaniment. This is the third of Mabus' banjo CDs and, if you liked the others, I'm sure you'll like this one. As I pointed out in my review of \"The Banjo Monologues\" album, his parents performed professionally on WLS Radio in the 1930s and Mabus has that same performing spirit. He's also a prolific writer and, the 44-minute physical CD digipak contains only a short introduction by the artist - and a photo - he refers you to his website where you'll find two- or three- paragraphs of notes about each song, as well as the lyrics to the four songs with vocals.\n\nThe album is available both as a physical album and as MP3 download.\n\nWhile Mabus does not have the most melodious-sounding voice, it sound authentic in the same way the Pete Seeger and Dave Van Ronk do (or in DVRs case, did). There is no denying that, instrumentally, Mabus knows his stuff. While I found the parlor guitar albums more entertaining, I do like this new one.\n\nI hope you found this review both informative and helpful.\n\nSteve Ramm\n\n\"Anything Phonographic\"\n\nArt Thieme reviewed NO WORRIES NOW in an online post:\n\n[Art was the godfather of Midwest folk music. I miss him like hell. Lovely man, and one of the great Chicago folksingers, up there with Steve Goodman & John Prine. jm]\n\nSubject: Review: Joel Mabus' new CD is a great one!!!\n\nFrom: Art Thieme\n\nDate: 22 Sep 09 - 04:31 PM\n\nThe name of it is Joel Mabus--NO WORRIES NOW....\n\nAny of you who have heard Joel over the years know unequivocally what a purely note-perfect and thoroughly accomplished guitarist the man is. The same goes for his banjo; just superb musicality, and harmonic/chordal taste combined with melodic perfection. These are mostly Joel's own compositions here with some new and some trad melodies utilized beautifully. His writing, once again, combines deep intelligent insights with humor that makes the term comic relief profound.\n\nFor me, the highlight of this album is a song Joel wrote called, simply, \"Charlie Birger\" -- which is absolutely the best tribute to, and also the best expose of, this southern Illinois murderer and gang leader that has ever been composed. On my second LP I recorded the song Vernan Dalhart had recorded in 1928. That song was written by either Carson Robison or Blind Andrew Jenkins. (A 78-revolutions-per-minute record) But this eight minute gem hits the nail on the head. You get to know the man that Charlie Birger was from hearing this one. You are lucky if a 400 page biography does that for someone, but Mr. Mabus has done it this guy who fought it out with the Shelton Brothers Gang and the Ku Klux Klan all at the same time during the sad prohibition era. Capone was more famous because he had the big city papers to build him up. Charlie Birger died in 1928---and it has taken until now for a good song to be written about him. Mr. Mabus has done it for this guy who fought it out with the Shelton Brothers Gang.\n\nAnd all the songs here are simply wonderful. I won't say any more because I've gone on too long already. Listen yourself, and you'll know what I'm going on about!\n\nThis CD shows how modern singer/songwriting and the vividness of trad story-song clarity and imagery can, dynamically, work together\n\nbeautifully.\n\nArt Thieme\n\nBluegrass Unlimited\n\n(\"on the edge\" review) Dec. '09\n\nI'm embarrassed and grateful. I'm red-faced because, until now, I had never heard of Joel Mabus, and this is his twentieth album, but it's also with gratitude that I've finally crossed paths with his marvelous talent. It took no more than twenty seconds after hitting the CD's first track, \"Am I Right,\" that I turned to my wife and said, \"I like this guy.\" Judging by this CD alone, Mabus understands the intricate details of the \"keep-it-simple\" formula. He proves less is more throughout this 14-track disc. Backed only by Frank Youngman on upright bass, Mabus adds his acoustic guitar, mandolin, and vocals in a simple, yet powerful, arrangement of many cleverly written tunes. Except for a couple of numbers, he wrote the lyrics and music to the rest of the record. Listeners will enjoy the light verse of \"Alligator Ate Her Poodle,\" the ditty, \"Come Along Again,\" and the jump tune, \"Am I Right.\" Mabus explores the life of colorful small-town crime boss, \"Charlie Birger,\" reflects on the hymns he sang in church as a child through the instrumental, \"The Lost Shall Be Redeemed\" and dreams of days gone by in \"Halfway Home.\" He even includes the bonus track, \"Extra Poison\" to complement \"Poison In The Glass\" about the fates of some of history's intriguing characters. (Fossil Records, P.O. Box 306, Portage, MI 49081, www.joelmabus.com.) BC\n\nFolk Alley (Jim Blum) Nov '09\n\nJoel Mabus is folk legend in Michigan and very worthy of that moniker. He has been crafting songs and preserving overlooked traditional melodies for years, and he does all of this on every stringed instrument you can think of. From the amusing \"Duct Tape Blues,\" to the calming \"The Only Way Out is Through,\" Joel's observational eye has gifted the Folk Alley library with dozens of heartwarming gems over the years.\n\nThere is no let up in No Worries Now. He covers lots of subjects. He pokes at political parties in \"You Voted Red\" (and I voted blue...). Mabus offers a practical solution for those who no longer drink in \"Two Cents Plain.\" The song's title is an old term for ordering a non alcoholic drink, but his clever rhyme and reasoning might open a few eyes among those trying to quit. Perhaps the most alluring number is \"Give It Up.\" This song addresses our ambitions, which if we're not careful, can drift away from the meaningful toward the materialistic.\n\nI don't mean to paint Joel as a lecturer, because he's not. This album is very entertaining, and often comical. Very few songwriters can poke you in the ribs and stick to your ribs at the same time. Mr. Mabus has this double ability and he always has. No Worries Now is another collection defining why fans will remember his songs.\n\nVictory Review Acoustic Music Magazine\n\nNovember 2009\n\nIts hard to imagine anyone playing acoustic guitar better than Joel Mabus. This is the Compleat Guitar (as in The Compleat Angler) for those who might have previously thought they played rather well. The best methods of good guitar recording bring you inside that wooden box. On this CD, Ragtime, Blues and Folk methods are played with ease. Perhaps those are the rewards of a long career. Joel adds to the mystery with mandolin and additional leads. He barely needs but certainly benefits from the well rounded acoustic bass of Frank Youngman.\n\nThe real surprise to me isnt the guitar but the great voice with almost a Burl Ives inflection and higher register. When Joel sings coyote I see coyote. But wait, he also wrote this stuff including arrangements built on two public domain tunes. Youll get great lyrics, clever Shakespearean references like Poison in the Glass, an understatement of divergent politics in You Voted Red, a somewhat historical lesson on the legendary Illinois crime boss who ran the KKK off his turf in Charlie Birger, a wonderful restatement of an old (1860) Baptist hymn, How Can I Keep From Singing, and a wonderful instrumental as haunting as a Ken Burns theme, The Lost Shall Be Redeemed.\n\nFor the most part, this is light hearted stuff, and poems that are subtle. Alligator Ate Her Poodle deftly points out that people who move into condos erected over the previous wildlife habitat cant seem to figure out why that environment doesnt cooperate. Two Cents Plain could easily be a Depression Era tune, describing a purchaser of plain ol soda water, simply wanting to fit in at the bar when real whisky is financially out of the question. Halfway Home and Shine are very personal, tell how to revisit the home of your youth and Turn it around-love can be found, but you got to let your little light shine.\n\nFolkradio.org reports that Joel is the fourth most played performer and was the nominee for Traditional Folk Artist of the Year 2008 by the Folk Alliance International. Even in 2009 youve still got plenty of opportunity to hear this wonderful guitar and song stylist. [J.W. McClure]\n\nLansing State Journal\n\nChris Rietz, reviewer Oct. 8, 2009\n\nNot since \"Rhyme Schemes\" back in 1997 has Michigan's own folk Renaissance man Joel Mabus issued an album of all-new, all-original songs - although since then he's produced a Christmas album, a CD of traditional songs, an album of narratives and banjo tunes, an all-instrumental fingerpicking guitar album and lots more.\n\nThat spell is now over with the September release of \"No Worries Now,\" the 20th album in this unique artist's three-decades-long career, 13 songs so fresh, variegated and unpredictable it sounds as though he's just warming up.\n\nIn a folk universe thickly populated with confessional, quasi-countrified songwriters, Mabus stands apart, for three reasons: one is that he's a top-flight picker with a lifetime passport to the land of instrumental hotshots, whereas most folkie songwriters can't go there. Listen to the gorgeous, hymn-inspired guitar solo \"The Lost Shall Be Redeemed\" or the thrilling, 'grassy solos on \"Charlie Birger.\"\n\nAnother reason is Mabus's refusal to gaze at his own navel - \"I invent most of my characters,\" he insists, \"especially the ones named 'I.' \" The result is a songwriting style with more breadth, from the bewildered, comical love song \"You Voted Red\" to the nostalgic \"Halfway Home.\"\n\nA third reason is Mabus combines his depth of feeling for traditional song with a long-standing respect for Tin Pan Alley songwriters, and while he'll always be called a folk artist, many of his songs owe as much a debt to, say, Hoagy Carmichael as to Woody Guthrie.\n\n\"Alligator Ate Her Poodle\" is everything anyone needs to know about Florida, stuffed into six tight, hilarious quatrains and set to the tune of \"Clementine.\" \"Shine,\" on the other hand, is a convincing exercise in swing, with a righteously breezy feel and some sharp guitar breaks.\n\n\"Charlie Birger\" is about a historical figure from southern Illinois where Mabus grew up, reminiscent of Woody Guthrie's song about Pretty Boy Floyd. \"Poison in the Glass\" is a virtuosic turn on skullduggery throughout history, with an appropriately creepy minor-sixth tonality - which in turn engenders the album's bonus track, a funny and self-referential piece of business that tells us (as if we don't already suspect it) that Mabus always seems to have more in the tank.\n\nFolk & Acoustic Music Exchange\n\nby Mark S. Tucker\n\nhttp://www.acousticmusic.com/fame/p05778.htm\n\nUnbelievably, almost every song on this CD was written by Joel Mabus but sounds as though unearthed from the Golden Age of old blues, folk, Tin Pan Alley, and Bob Wills. Moreover, there are just two guys here, Mabus and Frank Youngman, who plays bass. Joel's been around for a while (the cover photo kinda gives that away) and I, as a critic, have run across his name more than once on others' releases but personally discovered the guy with his Flying Fish release Settin' the Woods on Fire (1980 and out of print, dammit!), which remains in my permanent collection. His website, however, lists about 20 releases, with only 2 unavailable, so it's no longer difficult, as it tended to be in The Vinyl Era, to lay hold of his stuff.\n\nMabus is esteemed not just for wry lyrics, superb playing, and catchy compositions but also his banjo technique, which the bewhiskered gent teaches and issues instructional books about. No Worries Now is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that though we're presently in the wave crest of The Next Republican Depression and things are about as bad as they could get, you've still got art and music, and that tends to ease all the stress a tetch, no? After listening to this waltzing, jitterbugging, swinging, folks-ing disc, you'll be forced to agree at least to that much.\n\nIn the press, not enough is made of Mabus' skills as a writer, but the guy sparkles in his lyrics (a sheet's included with the CD). A college course could be taught behind his poetry, and I, as a tutor, will now be suggesting some of this disc's work for analysis by my high school students. A good deal more clever than much of Shel Silverstein, whom I also convey to kids, many of his words are jam-packed with multiple levels of meaning despite the rurality and sidewalk nature of much of them. Toss rootsy music on top, and you have a very formidable result.\n\nWant music that not only makes yer toes tap and hips sway? Give a listen to any cut here and sit amused as you ponder just what he's saying. For an added bonus, the composer's liner notes are often both hilarious and ironic. How many people do you know who can allude to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Judas Iscariot, and Jean-Paul Marat and make it all eminently sensible?\n\nMichigan Songwriter Joel Mabus Retells It Like It Is\n\nWritten by Joe Torok for City Pulse\n\nWednesday, 09 January 2008\n\nIt's that time of year again for Joel Mabus. The folk singer, who used to live in Lansing but now resides in southwestern Michigan, performs what he calls \"my homecoming concert\" each year for the Ten Pound Fiddle Coffeehouse. This year's concert - \"the 15th or so,\" Mabus notes - will feature songs from his new album, \"Retold,\" as well as the usual audience requests.\n\nMabus fans should recognize the lineup on his new album, which hits stores Jan. 15 and is available now through his Web site. The songs are a collection of oft-requested original pieces he penned during the first 10 years of his production company, Fossil Records.\n\nHe says the songs on the album are dear to his heart and continue to grow and change through time. \"I hate to say 'greatest hits,' because in folk music we don't have hits,\" Mabus says.\n\nHe says the songs also closely resemble what he does when he performs, an experience he has grown to love. \"It used to be I just enjoyed making music in front of people,\" he says. \"Now I like interacting with people. I like engaging them.\"\n\nAnd that's a big part of what it means to be a folk musician, Mabus explains. While audiences of Bluegrass or traditional Irish music might hone in on a performer's technical prowess, folk audiences are generally more concerned with an artist's stage presence.\n\n\"Folk music is tied into the entertainer's personality,\" Mabus says.\n\nOn \"Retold,\" Mabus' personality shines in songs like \"Hopelessly Midwestern\" and \"Duct Tape Blues,\" both of which deliver elements of storytelling and monologue.\n\nMabus says the lyrics to the \"funny self-deprecating song\" \"Hopelessly Midwestern,\" which include the line \"Now if you're favorite stretch of highway is flat and straight/You're hopelessly Midwestern/And if you still think sushi looks a lot like bait/ You're hopelessly Midwestern,\" have been changed over the years to keep the song fresh.\n\n\"Duct Tape Blues\" was first debuted in 1988 at the Ten Pound Fiddle, Mabus says. One of his most popular tunes, Mabus has mixed feelings about the song. \"I got sick of it because it was so requested,\" he says. \"People would come to a concert to see just that song.\"\n\nThe cut on his new album is an extended version over 10 minutes long, combining many of the retellings that have been performed over the years, with lines like \"I say this world has gone to pieces/What's a poor boy s'posed to do?/I'm just holdin' things together, now/Singing the duct tape blues.\"\n\n\"It's about life, death, duct tape and all the important things,\" Mabus says.\n\nMabus became a great songwriter over the course of many years, evolving from an overeager novice to an accomplished artist. \"When I was a young person, I wrote lots of lousy songs,\" he says. \"I thought that's what musicians were supposed to do.\"\n\nHe decided to put away pencil and paper through his 20s and concentrated on learning different musical styles and techniques. A decade later, Mabus was ready to resume writing with more confidence, because he knew what a good song sounded like.\n\nIn addition to guitar, Mabus plucks the banjo and plays the fiddle. He has recorded 18 albums since 1978, including 2007's \"The Banjo Monologues.\"\n\nToday Mabus says his repertoire on stage is usually confined to either original or traditional songs, the kind of melodies copyrighted to the public domain. You won't hear any cute re-imaginings of recent chart-toppers in his sets.\n\n\"I don't cover the latest hits,\" he says. \"If you're coming to see me, you'll hear my songs or my take on very old songs.\"\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\n'Retold,' Joel Mabus\n\nLatest Joel Mabus CD, 'Retold,' should please his devoted fans\n\nChris Rietz | For the Lansing State Journal\n\n\"Retold,\" set for release on Jan. 15, is the 18th album from songwriter/multi-instrumental hotshot Joel Mabus on his own Fossil Records, launched in 1987 to produce his own recordings.\n\nIt's a program of 12 Mabus originals, featuring only Joel's voice and acoustic guitar, from the label's first decade, songs in varying degrees lost, under-represented on CD or - most importantly - songs that continue to thrive and evolve in his countless live shows.\n\n\"Retold,\" then, is not at all a rehash of old faves - the unmistakable sign of an artist in winding-down mode - but no less than first-time definitive recordings of some of the most popular songs in Mabus's two-decades-and-counting career.\n\n1988's \"Naked Truth\" LP, a live album, was the source for four of the songs, including the mythic, spooky title cut, the powerful anti-war ballad \"Touch a Name on the Wall,\" and the sharp, playful \"Swing That Thing,\" interspersed with Joel's blazing guitar breaks - and a couple of musical quotes from Duke Ellington and Bach, too.\n\nLikely his most-requested song of them all, \"Duct Tape Blues\" is here, complete with the \"badoo-badoo\" story (don't ask, just listen), a broad palette of blues licks, some rumination on modern excess and more. At a full 10 minutes and 54 seconds, Mabus may be hoping to give his fans all the \"Duct Tape\" they want, once and for all.\n\nAn even better candidate for deathlessness-by-acclaim is the dead-on hilarious \"Hopelessly Midwestern,\" a Heartlander's National Anthem if ever there were. It comes packaged with the tale of his encounter with a tie-dyed California type, an opportunity for Mabus to trot out his best folksy, Will-Rogers-meets-Garrison-Keillor oratorical style and crank it up to 10.\n\n\"I don't call it a 'best of' album,\" Mabus remarked wistfully, \"but I'm sure there will be some who call it that.\" In the notes he acknowledges the old bromide that a songwriter's works are his children, and indeed, the 12 songs on \"Retold\" have grown up tall and strong, and done well for themselves. For those seeking an introduction to this acclaimed, multi-talented artist, or longtime fans who want THE Joel album, this is it - \"best of\" or not.\n\nChris Rietz works at Elderly Instruments in Lansing .

What follows is an amazing mixture of songs, tunes and stories about the banjo and Joel Mabuss experience as teacher, banjo player and appreciator of the instrument and the music. Mabus reaches with superb taste into old time music to pick the tunes for this recording. He is such a fine interpreter of this music that some of the old hillbilly standards, which I first heard and learned during the 60s folk scare, and which over the years Id come to regard as passé, achieve new life in the hands of this man. The playing and singing are magnificent and the story telling informative and fun. If you love banjo music this is a disc for you.\n\n By Mitch Podolak\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\nCD review: 'The Banjo Monologues,' by Joel Mabus Mabus delivers yet another original album with 'Banjo Monologues'\n\nBy Chris Rietz | For the Lansing State Journal 3/29/2007\n\nThe banjo has \"flirted with showbiz now and then, but mostly it's played in kitchens and back porches. Now to me that makes the five-string a noble thing.\"\n\nSo begins \"The Banjo Monologues,\" fully the 17th album from Joel Mabus, and the 14th on his own Fossil Records label, slated for release on May 1 - perhaps his most direct and intimate project yet.\n\nMabus's banjo-playing is a unique hybrid of the old-time, percussive, \"clawhammer\" style and its modern melodic grandson, the so-called \"chromatic\" style. His easy mix of both is, while not at all showy, entirely original - a bridging of both worlds that's almost unheard of.\n\nAs a result, the tunes and songs are a surprisingly varied smorgasbord of tastes: the rustic comedy of \"Three Nights Drunk,\" 19th-century ragtime with \"Whistling Rufus,\" even an original, the darting \"Dragonfly\" (\"my wife's favorite\"). And for anyone who thinks the banjo is only for happy stuff, Joel finds the heart of darkness in the murder ballad \"Willow Garden,\" a particularly chilling example of an already gory genre.\n\nNote too that Mabus doesn't shy from what could be called standard material: \"John Henry,\" \"Roll Down the Line,\" \"Cripple Creek.\" Mabus is that rare artist who can bring old chestnuts to life not by making them exotic, but by doing the opposite: finding the pulse in the old songs, by understanding them in a way that few others do.\n\nBut the best moments, the stuff that makes his 17th album fresh, are the \"monologues,\" seven of them.\n\nHere Joel talks about the banjo, its mysteries, about an 80-year-old student he once had, but most of all about his own southern Illinois parents, their siblings and in-laws who made a living as \"hillbilly\" musicians during the Depression.\n\nAll of this is told in a slow-paced, rhythmic, folksy style that's more than just affectation or schtick; it's simply the way these tales should want to be told. Think of Garrison Keillor; or better yet, \"Alice's Restaurant,\" in which Arlo Guthrie sounds more Okie than his own father. It's connecting the music - and himself - to a rich and cherished past, and \"The Banjo Monologues\" is accordingly less about showbiz, and more like the porch or the kitchen, than any banjo album you're ever likely to hear.\n\n[Chris Rietz is the CD buyer for Elderly Instruments, and writes reviews for LSJ on a biweekly basis]\n\nEarly reviews from the Internet:\n\nAlso don't miss Joel Mabus' cd. Another great one.\n\nJoel gets it right every time.\n\nEvery cd is different and never a dull moment any of his cds.\n\nRoz Larman Folkscene Radio\n\nposting to FOLKDJ-L\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe CD is a grand tribute to the banjo and to old-time music. Modern audiences may not understand why \"hillbilly\" music was so popular in its day. Early record producers gave the style the \"hillbilly\" moniker, which unfortunately created an image that has detracted from the music. In \"The Banjo Monologues\", Joel celebrates the true beauty and significance of the music, enabling modern audiences to understand the connection the music had with its audiences. Listening to the CD from beginning to end is a unique experience. I imagine this what Mark Twain or Garrison Keillor would sound like if they played the banjo. \"The Banjo Monologues\" helps cement Joel Mabus reputation as an artist.\n\nJoel Mabus is the Joe Dimaggio of the folk music world - a virtuoso who can make the toughest plays appear effortless. His performances are memorable and he leaves the audience with the feeling that they have spent an evening with a good friend or long-lost relative. His charm, intelligence and skill are evident in his inviting style.\n\n[Portion of blog posted by RON OLESKO Wednesday, March 28, 2007 Co-host of \"Traditions\" at WFDU, Fordham University Radio]\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have an embarrasingly high stack of CDs that need to be reviewed for our radio show- so many appealing CDs that choosing which to ignore for a while and which to listen to is almost painful.\n\nBut when the new Mabus CD hit the \"In\" Box yesterday, it went straight into the CD player.\n\nIt's nearly impossible to praise Joel's contributions to folk music too highly. A master of a number of instruments who communicates the nuances of each, an artful, profound and often funny songwriter whose songs will far outlive him, a masterly performer, and overall one of the true champions of traditonal folk music.\n\nThis new CD is going to win over people who have up to this point failed to enjoy the banjo, and is going to thrill people who enjoy Joel's stories. I'm particularly glad that those stories are accompanied by tasteful banjo backup, allowing me to program it on-air more than I would if they were straight spoken pieces.\n\nI could go on, but need to get back to reviewing CDs!\n\nMel DeYoung\n\nPS I have no affiliation with Joel, just an admiration for his talent and the use to which he has devoted it.\n\nMel DeYoung, folk music programmer at WPSU, Penn State U.\n\nposting to FOLKDJ-L\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nNo doubt you have heard of \"The Vagina Monologues\". If that introduction has grabbed your attention then your attention should be grabbed by a most brilliant CD that has come down the old pike. A CD by a true virtuoso of many instruments. Happily we have something that could now also be on the stage---\"The Banjo Monologues\".\n\nJoel Mabus has come up with a most brilliant piece of work. This CD consists of 18 tracks of traditional music and some truly colorful and insightful intros to many of the tracks. Tales of family, of music, and just some great philosophical thoughts. One insight has to do with how a teacher can also be a student. One of the most moving tracks on the CD. It is about as close as you are going to get to seeing Joel Mabus in concert.\n\nIf you have ever wondered what was the precursor to Grand Ole Opry you will find out here. If you ever wondered what instrument is his favorite---and why--you will find out.

The first refers to the small- bodied steel-string guitars used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, whose intimate voice and balanced tone made them ideal for fingerstyle playing.\n\nThe other is that the album itself was recorded in a Victorian-era parlor - the one that houses Arcadia Recording in Kalamazoo . This is no re-creation, though; it's more that these tunes, with their simplicity, durability and emotional heft, presented in this unaffected way, are a perfect match for the eminently musical Mabus.\n\nAs a result, \"Parlor Guitar\" is lyrical, light on its feet, captivating and in the end thoroughly listenable, in a way that precious few fingerstyle guitar albums ever are. As listeners will quickly note, Mabus's rep as a top-flight picker is well-deserved, but his depth of understanding, his willingness to let great songs sing in their own voice, is much more rare.\n\nWith one surprise exception, the CD is all instrumental, but it is very much an album of songs. A serious songwriter himself, Mabus is drawn to the Tin Pan Alley craftsmen of a century or so ago, whose target audience was vaudeville, the Broadway stage - or the living room.\n\nDixieland-ed to death for decades, \"After You've Gone\" seems rejuvenated in Mabus's wistful treatment. A medley of four early hymns is an album highlight, while ragtime - in full roar in those days - tips in with \"Tiger Rag.\"\n\nJoel's playing is informed by a traditional singer's sensibility - meaning that he has a nose for where these familiar melodies came from and how they've come to belong to everyone. It's more than just having done his homework, although the sleeve notes are a delight to read - as much as anything, \"Parlor Guitar\" is a showcase for how that adds depth to one's grasp of the tunes, what they mean and how they should be played.\n\nSing Out!Vol 50 #1 Spring 2006 p 120\n\nJoel Mabus is an extraordinary musician. He is a fine flat-picking guitarist, clawhammer banjoist and songwriter. With Parlor Guitar he demonstrates his abilities as an arranger for finger-style solo guitar.\n\nThe title is twofold. Parlor music was in its heyday in the early 20th Century when vaudeville and Tin Pan Alley ruled popular music. More specifically, the parlor guitar is a small bodied instrument most suited for intimate performances in the home. Joel uses just such an instrument on this CD, which gives it an authentic warmth and immediacy not achievable by a modern dreadnaught or jumbo sized instrument.\n\nAs you listen to Parlor Guitar casually you are treated to a great collection of tunes, many of which are rather well known from parents' or grandparents' piano benches. Most of the selections are standards, including \"You Made Me Love You\" from James V. Monaco, \"I'm Just Wild About Harry\" by Eubie Blake and \"Avalon\" by Vincent Rose with AI Jolson and Giacomo Puccini (yes, that Puccini!). Only with closer inspection does Joel's immense talent become apparent. He has taken and rearranged tunes that were never intended for the guitar and made them each a tour de force of guitar virtuosity. A lesser player would be justly proud to have any of these arrangements in his repertoire but Joel has over 20!\n\nA good example of this level of virtuosity is Nick La Roca's \"Tiger Rag from 1917.Originally recorded by Nick and his Original New Orleans Jass Band in 1918, it has about six different parts until the listener is treated to the \"Hold That Tiger\" motif. The entire recording is like that, just amazing. Do yourself a favor (and maybe your parents as well) and enjoy the amazing guitaristics of Joel Mabus's Parlor Guitar. -TD\n\nSING OUT Vol. 48 #3 Fall 2004 p 142.\n\nJoel Mabus Golden Willow Tree Fossil 1504\n\nVery quietly and under way too many people's radar, Joel Mabus has spent the past 25 years building one of the most impressive bodies of work spanning both traditional and contemporary folk music. He's a fine singer, has a virtuoso's command of the guitar and banjo (and fiddle, which he doesn't play on this particular album), has a deep repertoire of traditional ballads, old-time music and blues, and is a superb songwriter whose compositions are well-informed by the traditions and traditional songs he's mastered.\n\nLike many of his past recordings, Golden Willow Tree seamlessly mixes traditional songs with Joel's original material. The title song, a variant of the more familiar \"Golden Vanity,\" is a long a cappella ballad that Joel performs magnificently, letting the story unfold almost cinematically as the verses go by. His version of \"Study War No More,\" which incorporates the familiar \"Down By The Riverside\" with \"Walk In Jerusalem\" seems particularly relevant at this point in contemporary history, as does his rewrite of the traditional \"Ruben\" into a contemporary allegory about politics and class struggle in the Bush era.\n\nNot all of Joel's songs deal with weighty subjects. \"Spoon River and You\" is a very pretty, summertime love song, while in \"The Bird's Alphabet,\" he cleverly finds a bird for each of the 26 letters. Other great songs include \"Ride Away Easy,\" which captures the scene of a cowboy ready to ride into the sunset and \"Noe's Dove,\" whose subtext reflects a search for inner peace and spiritual fulfillment.\n\nJoel's three instrumentals, on both guitar and banjo, are also a delight. This is a solo recording with no sidemen and no overdubs. None are at all necessary.\n\nMike Regenstreif\n\nBluegrass Unlimited [September 2004 Issue]\n\nJOEL MABUS - GOLDEN WILLOW TREE Fossil Records 1504\n\nJoel Mabus is a talented singer, guitarist, songwriter, clawhammer banjoist, and also fiddler, though he does not fiddle on this recording. He mixes traditional tunes, such as the medley \"Sally Goodin In The Alley With Sugar In The Gourd,\" \"Speed The Plow,\" the title cut, and \"Study War No More,\" with his fine original songs and tunes, \"The Last Of June,\" \"Papa Caught A Catfish,\" \"Spoon River And You,\" \"Banjo Ala Turk,\" \"The Bird's Alphabet,\" \"Noe's Dove,\" \"Ride Away Easy,\" and \"Crossing The Ohio.\" But the high point for this reviewer is Joel's banjo treatment of the traditional \"Ruben,\" for which he writes new and very apt lyrics, which turn Ruben into a ruthless corporate manipulator.\n\nThe CD opens with a clawhammer instrumental, \"The Last Of June.\" Mabus's playing is clear, crisp, and precise with a warm round tone. \"Papa Caught A Catfish\" is fingerpicked blues. The \"Sally...\" medley is more tasteful clawhammer with vocals. \"Spoon River\" is a nostalgic ballad. \"Speed The Plow\" is fingerpicked. \"Golden Willow Tree\" is sung a capella in Mabus's gravelly but wistful voice. Bird lovers and children will love \"The Bird's Alphabet,\" another a capella song with a bird and a line for each letter. \"Ride Away Easy\" is a modern cowboy song. \"Crossing The Ohio\" is an exquisite guitar tribute to Stephen Foster with appropriate melodic references.\n\nJoel Mabus is one of the most creative musicians rooted in traditional music. You never know what kind of arrangement he will use, and he continues to both surprise and delight on this recording. If you are not already a fan of his music, this CD will make you one.\n\nSAG\n\nLansing State Journal Published May 13, 2004\n\n\"Golden Willow Tree,\" Joel Mabus\n\nBy Chris Rietz For the Lansing State Journal\n\nJoel Mabus' new CD, \"Golden Willow Tree,\" has such a classic, timeless feel that one is surprised to discover all but a few tracks are originals. But this CD, perhaps more than any of his many recordings, exemplifies Mabus' grasp of traditional music as a living thing - it's always been impossible to distinguish the proverbial roots from the new fruit.\n\nIt's only the man's voice, his finger-picked guitar and clawhammer banjo, and while Mabus is a world-class instrumentalist - and his depth and mastery of style have made him a fine, effective singer - \"Tree\" has higher ambitions than to overwhelm.\n\nHis treatment of traditional songs here is revealing. Both the title track and \"Ruben\" are widely known but often obscure in meaning; Mabus instinctively finds the heart in both songs, sharply focusing each tale with the directness of the best storytellers. Nor does he shy from underscoring the old stories' relevance to today's headlines.\n\nBut the original stuff rules the album. \"Ride Away Easy\" is a poignant rewrite of \"Old Paint,\" with an original verse left intact. The gorgeous \"Noe's Dove,\" with its hymn-book phrasing and pentatonic banjo melody, could easily pass for 200 years old. Conversely, the wildly original \"Banjo Ala Turk,\" which sounds like an Egyptian version of \"Old Joe Clark,\" should suffice to confound the traditionalists while delighting everyone else.\n\nOf special note is the sound quality of this self-produced project, which is nothing less than luscious. The intimacy of Joel's voice, and the richness and subtlety of the instruments - and the hands playing them - have much to do with the deceptively low-key power of \"Golden Willow Tree.\"\n\nMabus will launch the CD locally at a benefit concert for Habitat for Humanity Lansing. It's at 8 p.m. Saturday in Lansing Community College's Dart Auditorium, 500 N. Capitol Ave., downtown.\n\nChris Rietz works at Elderly Instruments in Lansing.

His new collection of standards (Frankie and Albert, Big Rock Candy Mountain) and originals (Shake Them Hard Luck Blues, Struttin to Tootsies) hits the mark Instrumentals Red Dog Rag and The Creeper are packed with mind-blowing runs and rythms; even the vocal tracks have there share of incredible instrumental flourishes. And Mabus weathered voice is a great folk-blues instrument. Just the move from free time to a steady meter leading into East St. Louis is a thing of beauty. Named for its fingerpicking style, the exquisitely recorded Thumb Thump (Fossil 1402) is irresistible in a Mississippi John Hurt way  unless your blues have to be all low-down, all the time, you should love it.\n\nBluegrass Unlimited January 2003, pp88, 89\n\nThere is nothing like the sound of a guitar. Not only is it extremely versatile, but its the perfect instrument to accompany the human voice. Then again sometimes all you want to hear is ten elegant fingers bouncing melodically and rhythmically over six steel strings.\n\nThumb Thump is just what the doctor ordered. Joel Mabus has put together a solo album that takes listeners on a tour of mostly familiar blues and ragtime standards, plus four originals that sound as beautifully aged and timeworn as the standards, so well does he know his genres. There are no studio musicians, no harmony singers, just Mabuss rich, deep, classy, fingerpicked guitar as it lays down a syncopated, winding path for his vibrant, earthy voice, perfect for delivering the wrong-side-of-town stories that have made the blues and ragtime such solid cornerstones of American Music.\n\nFour of the thirteen tracks are Mabus originals, blending seamlessly with the likes of Frankie And Albert, My Buckets Got A Hole In It, and What Kind Of Pants Does A Gambler Wear. Instrumentals are delightful  The Creeper slinks in and tiptoes around, while Stuttin To Tootsies is a peacock-proud parade down the boulevard. Liner notes are a wealth of information about the songs, Mabus, and the river country of his youth.\n\nWarning: Listening to Thumb Thump may transcendentally transport you into a speak-easy, or maybe a dark corner of your neighborhood bar. Theres a guy and his guitar, playing for his own enjoyment in the dim light, but you get caught up in the melodies, the tough lyrics, and somehow it makes you feel a bit better. You watch as his fingers pick out intricate melodies, his thumb thumping out the rhythm. You listen to his roughened voice as it floats above the din and you smile.\n\nJK\n\nDirty Linen Feb/March 03 #104 p61\n\nMaking the most of his right thumb, as well as his other nine fingers, the always-affable singer/guitarist Joel Mabus has recorded a delightful kick-off-your-shoes-and-sit-back collection of rhythmic old-time country blues and ragtime.\n\nWith his easy going, slightly gruff voice and smooth fingerpicking, Mabus blends his recollections of the St. Louis street singers he heard as a child with a stylistic nod to old bluesmen like Mississippi John Hurt and country pickers like Doc Watson. He mixes his honest arrangements of standards like \"Frankie and Albert\" and \"East St Louis\" with some breezy original ragtime instrumentals like \"Red Dog Rag\" and \"Struttin' to Tootsie's\" along with the traditional blues spiritual \"Paul and Silas\" and the hobo's yarn \"Big Rock Candy Mountain.\"\n\nAll are played with affection and skill. The live-in-studio production adds to the friendly, informal feel. (TN)\n\nSing Out! Vol. 46 #3 Fall 2002 pp132-133\n\nClick here to go to the SINGOUT website.\n\nHow does he do it? Recording after recording, Joel Mabus manages to produce fresh and delightful material combining traditional songs and his own firm grasp of song craftsmanship. He does it with little or no musical support outside of his own mastery of guitar, fiddle, mandolin and banjo.\n\nOn Thumb Thump, Joel turns his talents to ragtime and blues and sticks with acoustic guitar and voice. The title refers to the steady rhythm and right hand guitar technique required to create these styles and Joel's obvious delight and control of these genres comes through on every track.\n\nThere are four original compositions on Thumb Thump, but the bulk of the recording draws from folk and blues traditions. Prepare yourself, however, for some well-researched and creative interpretations of songs you thought you knew. Joel's healthy philosophy of respecting and adding to the tradition is what makes Thumb Thump so unique. His versions of \"Brady,\" \"Frankie and Albert,\" \" Paul and Silas,\" and especially \"What Kind of Pants Does a Gambler Wear\" are great examples of this.\n\nNo fancy production here; just a superb musician and connoisseur of old time music sharing his joy with anyone lucky enough to listen.\n\nMatt Watroba\n\nFrom ALL MUSIC GUIDE:\n\nSix of One, the old saying goes, a half-dozen of the other. In this instance, that means six originals by multi-instrumentalist Joel Mabus and six traditional pieces. Switching between contemporary pieces and timeworn ones, like \"Old Smokey\" and \"Careless Love,\" provides a fun mix that keeps the listener listening.\n\nThere's a deeply moving version of \"Old Baggum,\" a mysterious piece filled with elliptical lyrics carried along by a string of minor-key banjo notes. Old Baggum, with his sword and pistol by his side, hunts for a wild boar that kills men and drinks their blood. Mabus controls the drama like a master storyteller, and when he follows his tale with the instrumental \"Toss the Feathers,\" he provides a breathing space that allows the story time to settle deep into the listener's consciousness. Perhaps the oddest though most enjoyable song on the album is \"Little Baby Lindberg.\" This darkly humorous piece begins with, \"Little baby Lindberg, never saw it coming,\" then chronicles a number of historical disasters: John Jacob Astor boards the Titanic, Lincoln goes to the theater, and Elvis spends his last few minutes in the bathroom. Mabus suggests, in this most creative of putdown songs, that the person he's singing to, like these historical figures, will get theirs one day.\n\nDespite such dark moments, the album ends on a happy note with the upbeat \"Back Porch of Glory\" and a jaunty version of \"Don't Let Your Deal Go Down.\" Six of One serves as a fine intro to Mabus and will be welcomed by his fans. ~ Ronnie D. Lankford, Jr., All Music Guide\n\nBluegrass Unlimited Click here to go to the \"BU\" website\n\nJune 2001\n\nBob Allen, reviewer\n\nJoel Mabus\n\nSix Of One\n\nThe latest release from Joel Mabus, a popular figure on the national folk and grass roots music circuits who has often shared the bill with musical soul mates like John Prine and Greg Brown, is a real gem. \"Six Of One\" is full of masterful songwriting, homespun wit and wisdom, fine picking, and some amazingly fresh interpretations of old standards.\n\nAbove all else, Mabus, with his warm, contemplative baritone (which often seems to convey an underlying wink and grin) and his inventive songwriting, manages to probe the recesses of the human condition using familiar, down-home images in vivid originals like \"School For Love\" and \"Virus On The Town.\"\n\nThese same musical gifts enable Mabus (who is accomplished on both guitar and banjo and is joined here by Peter Ruth on harmonica and Don Stiernberg on mandolin) to take timeworn, familiar classics like \"Old Smokey,\" \"The Cowboys' Barb'ry Allen,\" \"Balm In Gilead,\" and the shuffly-bluesy \"Careless Love\" and subtlety recast them so you feel like you're hearing them for the very first time.\n\nBy the same token, Mabus's original compositions like \"Little Baby Lindberg\" and \"Back Porch Of Glory\" so perfectly meld contemporary wit and insight with traditional song stylings that it's easy to imagine they were written 50 or 100 years ago.\n\nAll these ingredients make it amply clear why Mabus's star continues to rise on the international touring circuit.

Mabus follows each original song with a related or inspirational traditional song. Thus, he follows his \"School For Love\" with the traditional \"Careless Love.\" The former laments the contemporary state of relationships, while the latter sings of the same problem in the past.\n\nMabus' original songs all provoke thought. They're some of the darkest songs he's written, exploring the ugly underbelly of society. \"Little Baby Lindberg\" uses historical situations to illustrate that we cannot control our destinies, while \"Virus On The Town\" continues the theme, focusing on the plague of guns. Mabus follows \"Virus\" with the soothing traditional \"Balm In Gilead,\" which appropriately contains the line \"to make the wounded whole.\" He also includes \"The Cowboy's Barb'ry Allen,\" the transposition of the Child ballad to the American Wild West. Art Thieme originally turned up this gem, but Thieme's version has been out-of-pressing for many years.\n\nMore singer-songwriters should learn and perform from Mabus' perspective of mixing originals with traditional songs. Each compliments the other making for a more interesting and engaging recording. Mabus sings with a pleasing voice delightfully accompanied by Peter \"Madcat\" Ruth on harmonica and Don Stiernberg on mandolin. This simple but tasty accompaniment serves the songs well. Six Of One combines the best of both worlds, good songwriting with songs that have stood the test of time, performed with intelligence and honesty.\n\nI'd like to hear dozens more recordings like this one from other contemporary singer-songwriters.\n\n- RWarr\n\nHow Like the Holly\n\nEric Freedman, Michigan Folk Notes Nov. 99\n\nVersatile singer-songwriter Joel Mabus of Portage is back, just in time for the holidays with his first seasonal collection, the solo CD \"How Like The Holly.\" It's quintessential Mabus, sometimes passionate, sometimes quietly moving, sometimes insightful, with a bit of humor and plenty of masterful banjo and acoustic guitar playing. The CD is a mix of 12 (one for each night of Christmas) original and traditional vocals and instrumentals, some with his own arrangements or new lyrics.\n\n\"When the nights are longest and days are coldest comes the time for telling stories,\" Mabus writes. \"The time for fire against the chill, light against the dark, bread against the hunger - we huddle close and swab our fears with our finest and oldest comforts.\"\n\nThat's what we find here, comforts, stories and music against the chill. For example he wrote new words for the old English folk song \"The Friendly Beasts,\" a simple tale about the sacrifices made by animals in the manger on Christmas Eve when, by legend, animals can speak. \"Let's Do Christmas Right\" is a heart-felt defense of simple Christmas traditions coupled with characteristic Mabus satire on the less seemly aspects of the season. \"Now all the mistletoe is plastic/ Just as phony as Santa's beard/ And this lowfat eggnog substitute/ Is tasting just a little bit weird So shut off the TV - unplug the phone/ Hey leave that internet connection alone! / For once let's have a silent night/ Let's do Christmas right.\"\n\nThe title cut, \"How Like The Holly,\" centers on the symbols of winter long before there was a holiday called Christmas: \"How like the frost on the evergreen tree,/ How like the deer running wild, running free,/ How like Orion, arising so bold,/ How like the story bound to be told,/ How like the winter that promises spring,/ How like the carol we sing.\"\n\nPut this CD under the tree or in your stocking.\n\nDirty Linen\n\nDec. 99 (Susan Hartman)\n\nOn this warm and charming CD, a worthy addition to any Christmas collection, Mabus presents the listener with 12 melodies. Two were specially written for this collection: The flowing and poetic \"How Like The Holly\" is a celebration of the winter solstice, and the scathing & irreverent - or is it the height of reverence from which he writes? - \"Let's Do Christmas Right\" could easily be adopted as the theme song for the \"Alternative Christmas\" movement. His adaptations of three traditional carols (\"Children Go Where I Send Thee,\" \"The Cherry Tree Carol\" and \"The Friendly Beasts\") make these mildly familiar pieces even more fresh. Add some fine pickin' and a Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem and you've found the perfect blend of the old and the new, the relaxing and the stimulating. A delightful gift from a gifted performer.\n\nLansing State Journal\n\nBy Chris Rietz\n\n\"So shut off the TV; unplug the phone / hey - leave that internet connection alone! / For once let's have a silent night / Let's do Christmas right,\" sings Joel Mabus on his unique and beguiling holiday CD \"How Like the Holly.\"\n\nIt's something of a quiet album, more powerful for its understatement. But more importantly, Mabus brings a clear-eyed sense of tradition, of connectedness to the past that rings just the right bell for the season in a way that few other Christmas recordings do.\n\nAs a singer, he has a deeply rooted grasp of traditional style and the ability to deliver a song directly and with conviction. His world-class skills on guitar and banjo are harnessed, as always, in service to the song.\n\nAmong the album highlights are the black hymn \"Children Go Where I Send Thee,\" a ragtime guitar version of the 1857 song \"One Horse Open Sleigh\" (aka \"Jingle Bells\"), and an Appalachian-style rendering of \"The Cherry Tree Carol,\" an apocryphal tale of Mary, Joseph and the unborn Jesus.\n\nParticularly memorable is the musical setting of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Civil War-era \"Christmas Bells,\" a poem of yearning for peace in dark times that's so powerful (and eerily timely), one wonders why it's not reprised more often."
