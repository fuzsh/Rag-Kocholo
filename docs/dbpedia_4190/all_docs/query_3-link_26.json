Killing Joke are one of my favorite alternative rock bands of all time, yet I hate(strongly dislike) most bands that sound like them. Why is this? I suspect it has to do with where the Joke are coming from as opposed to where those, ahem, other bands are coming from. On their best albums(and this is one of them), Killing Joke weave together a delicate symphony of sound, always maintaing a tantalizing balance between dissonance and melodicism. Everything they touch goes into making this delicate symphony better. They can use dance beats in previously unimagined and unbelievably creative ways. The guitars can sound ragged and distorted one minute, or as clear as a church bell the next. The Joke don't owe allegiance to any one style of music, or to any one circle of fans. They are an intensely musical group, complex and intriguing, always in transition and changing. They aren't very poppy or accessible. They're one of the very best groups of their kind, in my opinion, and they have twenty years worth of music to prove it. I hate to make a qualitative statement such as \"This album is the greatest album of the 1990s\", but if ever there was an album I'd like to bestow this title on, Pandemonium would be it. Far better than anything released by those overrated Brits: Radiohead, Blur, Pulp, or even(gulp!) Oasis. Superior to the best of the neo-grunge movement, certainly. Maybe not as important - Killing Joke aren't exactly going to get on MTV and sell ten million copies as Nirvana did in 1991. But I hold that Killing Joke is the far better band, because they are dedicated solely to music - commercial concerns don't really factor into the equation. But that's just me. From what I can tell, most people don't hear anything remarkable in this recording. Me, on the other hand, I'm blown away. Okay, it has a couple of mediocre songs, but the many excellent tunes are far better than most material you'll come across in the year of 1994.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. Pandemonium\n\n2. Exorcism\n\n3. Millenium\n\n4. Communion\n\n5. Black Moon\n\n6. Labyrinth\n\n7. Jana\n\n8. Whiteout\n\n9. Pleasures of the Flesh\n\n10. Mathematics of Chaos\n\nIf I had to describe the sound Killing Joke achieve on this album, I would compare it to a picture - no, a canvas, yet untouched by hand or paint. Upon this blank canvas, the artist paints a black background - infinite, vast, depressing, profound. No matter what the artist paints over the background, the blackness is still there, still the most noticable feature of the painting. For Killing Joke, the black background is their web of noise. This may put some off at first. Noise is not all that pleasant, and noise bands are quite often talentless. But what seperates Killing Joke from the dozens of alternative, metal, and industrial bands they've influenced is how they layer instrumentation on top of their inaccessible noise. Underneath their black background, their noisy exterior, lies a whole wealth of interesting musicianship - beautiful guitar lines, amazing bass work, even strings and other instruments. The most amazing thing about the Joke is that they are not chaotic or noisy - their songs are arranged tight, compact, carefully. In a way, they are the absolute antithesis of your average, \"louder faster harder\" hardcore punk band. The Joke paint beautiful, well thought-out pictures on top of their black background, and I love to hear them!\n\nI won't discuss the band in detail as I already did that(more or less) in my first Killing Joke review a few volumes ago. But I will say that the band sounds incredible: Geordie on the guitar demonstrates his extreme adaptability, Jaz Coleman continues to amaze with his novel approach to singing(he uses his voice as if it was a musical instrument in its own right. Remarkable. He also comes up with some of the best choruses I've ever heard in alt rock), and that Arab guy is pretty good on the violin, too. Though I at first dismissed the influences of classical music on Killing Joke, I'm beginning to see that it is a valid comparison: the intelligent, layered instrumentation is certainly reminiscent of what you hear quite often in classical music. What might frighten a lot of people away is the Joke's repetition - I'm surprised it doesn't frighten me away, quite frankly. There are ten songs on this record and it is an hour long. That means the average song length is six minutes(the opening tune is EIGHT minutes long). Yet instead of boring me, these lengthy songs fascinate and intrigue me - I want to catch everything that is going on, I want to hear all the tempo changes, I want to hear every note played on every instrument, every sound effect, every beat. This is the whole Phil Spector \"wave of sound\" theory taken to the next level, dude, and it's cool by my book. What about your book?\n\nAs for the songs, it starts out absolutely incredible - the four songs that open it are among the best work Killing Joke have ever produced(brilliant). The title track is hypnotic and delightful. It pretty much sums up everything I've been trying to say about Killing Joke in the three paragraphs which precede this one. Not only is it an enthralling mixture of dissonance and melodicism, it also boasts of a great chorus and fantastic guitar playing. And track deux, \"Exorcism\", is about the best industrial song I've ever heard. The harsh background noise is strangely and relentlessly mechanical and machine-like - pulsating dance beats compliment it perfectly as Jaz Coleman tries to scream above the noise. And then? I can't describe the amazing wave of etheral guitar noise that keeps cropping up at intervals; Geordie's harsh leads are good, too. Somehow, the Joke manage to take a song that starts out sounding so inhumane, distant, and machinelike into an affirmation of life itself. I don't really care for industrial music in general, but this...really gets my goat. Maybe the goat in King's Quest I, too! Instead of formless guitar noise, the background layer of sound in \"Milennium\" is a(the?) prototypical heavy metal riff. But then that ethereal, \"Kashmir\"ish sonic wave kicks in and the song is changed utterly. It's a beautiful, sudden tempo change. Jaz's three choruses are nice, as well. It's nice to hear him not sound so psychotic and intense for a change. Then there is the Eastern, even more \"Kashmir\" sounding \"Communion\" (have you figured out Jaz Coleman is Catholic yet? He loves that religious imagery.) It sounds nothing like any of the other songs on the record with its great use of loud electric guitars and violins. Jaz Coleman as always keeps up with the instruments, contributing a truly Earth-shattering, jarring chorus that doesn't quite make me think of communion. And then a little later in the song we hear...HORNS? Synth horns...in a Killing Joke song? Whatever they are, they sound incredible. It seems that Killing Joke's \"concept\" is to show the ugliness of life being slowly and gradually defeated by \"the beautiful and the sublime.\" Inhumanity being eliminated by humanity. I'm sure Schiller and Goethe would approve. And I do, too. As for \"Black Moon\", it's a late period Emerson, Lake, and Palmer album I haven't heard. Don't mention it on a Killing Joke review page, please. Okay, \"Black Moon\" is the fifth song on this album and starts out weak but redeems itself with another great Jaz chorus. I don't have a lyrics sheet, so I have no clue what he's singing over that relaxing alt rock shuffle. Sounds like \"Stressssssss freeeeeeeee, stressss freeeeeeeee!\" but I'd be surprised if that was what it really was. But this isn't one of the better songs on this album. Not musically challenging enough to justify its length. \"Labyrinth\" also is one of the lesser songs on record - kind of boring aside from the excellent string(synth or electric violin, I'm not sure) work. It drags on too long, as well - a clunker that prevents this album from receiving its deserved perfect '10'. \"Jana\" is something of a rebound - a mellow, bass-driven tribute to the retiring Czech female tennis player Jana Novotna. I'm joking. I was always fond of Jana Novotna, however. Good player. Smart, too. I love the pulsating guitar work in the midsection of \"Jana\", also. It's really quite a good song, if surprising in its accessibility(Jaz is even singing in a hushed, pop tone). Maybe this was the song that made this album the most popular the Joke ever released - it definitely has little in common with the first four songs. \"Whiteout\" is a return to industrial rock stylings, but, strangely, it sucks. Boring guitar work, boring chorus. \"Pleasures of the Flesh\" is more whoopie granola mellowness - decent enough background noise, but surprisingly lacking in punch and experimentalism. It's much preferable to \"Whiteout\" but it just kinds of sits there and shimmers instead of reaching out and grabbing the listener. We in the bizness call this filler. Unfortunate that it has to clutter a brilliant album. If I could cut this, \"Whiteout\", and shorten \"Labyrinth\" this album would be a perfect ten. \"Mathematics of Chaos\" is a good song to end on. It features good guitar work, a questionable use of dance beats, and another excellent showcase of the \"sonic wave\" effect that I really enjoy. It's good enough to ensure that this recording receive a '9'. But I give it a 9 with an asterisk, because this is an album that could have and should have and would have been a '10' were it only edited a teeny bit more. As it is, well, it's more interesting than The Downward Spiral.\n\n9 stars(out of 10)\n\nDemocracy by Killing Joke(1996)\n\nKilling Joke have been my band of the month so far. In addition to listening to their albums prodigiously, I've been reading interviews with band members, checking out fan pages for them, all that good stuff. In some ways, Killing Joke is a more interesting band than they are a good, creative one. Not that I'm saying they're crap. Nothing of the sort. Just read the whole review, gosh darn it! But first, view the track listing for their latest album which is entitled simply Democracy:\n\n1. Savage Freedom\n\n2. Democracy\n\n3. Prozac People\n\n4. Lanterns\n\n5. Aeon\n\n6. Pilgrimage\n\n7. Intellect\n\n8. Medicine Wheel\n\n9. Absent Friends\n\n10. Another Bloody Election\n\nKilling Joke are a truly alternative band. By that I mean they really sound like they are an alternative force in music...they have their own sound! Considering how many imitators they've spawned and how many groups they've influenced, it's quite impressive that their music still sounds fresh. Basically, Killing Joke are a melting pot(or mutation, if you are a Beck fan! Hah, 90s pop culture reference that makes no sense at all!) of various disconnected musical genres: punk, metal, alternative, techno, ambient. As you might expect, those last two bug me the most. They borrow techno's repetition(which, rather than being \"hypnotic\" is generally \"annoying\") and ambient's tendency to insert \"noises that mean nothing and do even less!\" Strangely enough, though, I can't complain with many of the band's musical experiments: some of 'em sound great! It's at least a great deal more interesting to listen to than your average techno outfit that wouldn't know rock from a stone.\n\nI won't discuss Killing Joke's long history here(for that, search the web or visit Mark Prindle's page on the Joke), but I would like to mention a few of the band members that make up the current \"classic\" lineup. Jaz Coleman is the singer, and I'd go even so far as to say that he's the leader of the band, though it's not generally stated as such. He's not really much of a singer at all. He's a hoarse shouter. That's what he does. In a way, his vocals don't sound as much like a conduit for his lyrics as they do a sort of instrumental backing in their own right(listen to \"Aeon\" on this record for a good example of this.) Some claim that Jaz is a headcase, but I disagree. He may be a little weird, but that's no sin. So what if he ran to Iceland to await the apocalypse? Who cares if he recorded a weird spoken word album all about magic? It seems that these days Jaz is a highly respected classical composer. This leads me to believe that he has a great deal to do with the entire sound of Killing Joke as well. But don't be fooled: Jaz's two major musical interests are quite removed. I read on some Killing Joke fan page an excited webmaster's claim that \"Killing Joke are the closest thing rock has come to classical music.\" I don't see that at all. This music is too darned repetitive to be even that highly influenced by classical music. Killing Joke have their own sound, and I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't follow any major musical scale religiously. Well, more about Jaz now, eh? He claims these days to be a sort of Catholic mystic(shades of Kerouac) and no longer seems to have so much time for magic. He's also an environmentalist/\"new ager.\" However, unlike many of his ilk, I believe Mr. Coleman is sincere in his beliefs and worth listening to. Geordie is the Killing Joke guitarist, and he's quite good at it if I say so myself. He has to be to be able to adapt to this band's style(forget \"adapt\"...he's one of the original members of the band and had a large part in CREATING the style!). Finally, there is Youth, producer extraordinaire and bassist for the band. Apparently. Youth is known for his productions of various techno/dance bands and he has also produced well known major label artists as well(including, apparently, Paul McCartney.)\n\nAs for this album, I guess it's not Killing Joke's best, but it's full of interesting muse. \"Savage Freedom\" opens up the album with a sea of bombast, living up to its title. And Youth contributes a pleasant, repetitious bass line! Funny how you can't hear him hardly for the rest of the album's duration. \"Democracy\" is a much weaker song musically, but it at least redeems itself a bit lyrically: \"You have a choice, we are your voice. Red, blue, or yellow. We will blow away the green. Another five lane motorway(You'll never get a referendum anyway).\" I know, it's a sea of conflicting messages. The band seems to believe that representative government has been more or less a failure in the band's home country of England as well as in America. However, they think that it has proven to be a success in New Zealand's(where Jaz resides) twenty four party system of democracy. \"Prozac People\" is a good song that desperately needed to be written; doesn't bother me if it's a bit overlong. When will people realize that the like of Prozac and Ritalin are quite possibly just as bad as any illegal drugs? I oppose them for the same reason I oppose illegal drugs: they're personality changing! That's dangerous, folks. The way Prozac and Ritalin are prescribed these days we'll have a nation of uncreative zombies before too long. \"Aeon\" is a song I can't describe. It's incredible, exhilarating, hypnotic, amazing. Long, but not overlong! It's the best tune on this album by far...boy, if all electronica sounded like this, I wouldn't hate it! I wouldn't! Following the acoustic-electric prayer \"Pilgrimage\", we get probably the album's worst song: \"Intellect.\" Even though it's a crap song, it's neat how Killing Joke can sound like a hardcore band, like an industrial band, and like Metallica all at the same time. Doesn't Jaz sound like James Hetfield when he shouts \"Kiss my\"? Doesn't he? It's appropriate, since Killing Joke were a major influence on Metallica. \"Medicine Wheel\" is odd. Just odd. It opens up with what I believe to be a Native American wind instrument...a type of flute perhaps? The final two songs, \"Absent Friends\" and \"Another Bloody Election\" end Democracy with a strong note. Both tunes are more traditionally hard rockin' than we might expect given some of the other tracks on this thing.\n\nMusical variety is the key to Killing Joke's appeal, and it's no wonder that they are a favorite of the critics(underground, at least). They certainly have their shortcomings. Their songs are too repetitive, their noise experiments don't always work, their vocals are a joke(maybe even a KILLING one! Ha, ha!), and occasionally their music just sounds outright unpleasant and depressing. The fact that I can ignore these shortcomings and give this album an eight shows just how good Killing Joke are at what they do.\n\n8 stars(out of 10)\n\nThe Kinks Collection - Volume One(1996)\n\nI know it's bad form(for this review site) to review two albums from the same band on a single reviews page. However, these Kinks aren't exactly the same band as the one that did Muswell Hillbillies.\n\n1. You Really Got Me\n\n2. The World Keeps Going Round\n\n3. Everybody's Gonna Be Happy\n\n4. Till The End of the Day\n\n5. I Need You\n\n6. A Well Respected Man\n\n7. Never Met A Girl Like You Before\n\n8. Set Me Free\n\n9. I Gotta Move\n\n10. Tired of Waiting For You\n\nThere's something that most British invasion bands share. That something is called \"stupidity.\" Yeah, listen to yer early Beatles, yer early Kinks, and literally hundreds of minor bands...be overwhelmed with the stupidity and silliness of their original material. The Who weren't so outwardly stupid and silly, and the Stones preferred to be one of the best cover bands in England until they were able to come up with good material on their own.(Of course, those early Beatles records have lots of covers, too, but they're generally weaker than the original versions, even if the choice of cover is strong.) Unfortunately for me, this collection compiles and profiles the early Kinks. It's therefore mostly useless for me. It's full of dull pop songs that do nothing. Sure, Ray Davies tries to be a little \"cool\" with his singing and impress the chicks(\"I Need You\", \"Tired of Waiting For You\", \"Set Me Free\"), and Dave Davies already had that distinct guitar style that so seperated him and the Kinks from the rest of the pack. However, Ray's main melodies are generally simplistic crap, and Dave is very inconsistent, coming up with a couple good solos(\"You Really Got Me\", \"I Need You\"), but, on the other hand, often delivering insipid, out-of-place riffs that do nothing but harm these early tunes. Ray's songwriting also is nowhere near the level we expect it to be. He tries on \"The World Keeps Going Round\" and \"A WelL Respected Man\", but these are early efforts and more or less discardable.\n\nYou'd never guess, after listening to this album, that the Kinks would ultimately become one of the best rock groups ever. They had no potential! It makes me only love them more, though. What a leap they made! Don't buy this album, unless you have great tolerance for British pop and see it cheap. None of the songs really kick me in the ass, with the obvious exception of the fine early klassick, \"You Really Got Me.\" \"Tired of Waiting For You\" is good to listen to if you've been waiting all day and night for a girl who will never call, though.\n\n4 stars(out of 10)\n\nMuswell Hillbillies by the Kinks(1971)\n\nIt seems that one rewrite per review is par for the course at the moment. I don't mind this, as I'm quite aware of my limitations as a writer especially in this environment(my hurried style actually works well for fiction, believe it or no!). It's not that my original review of this album was terrible or anything, but it failed to quite bring out my feelings concerning this particular record. At the time I wrote up my original review, I had only just discovered the reissue of the album and its effect hadn't quite worn on me. I hate rating records against one another and choosing particular albums as the best of a particular artist, but I have to admit the Kinks never did record an album quite like this one. They released some great albums, sure, but none of 'em quite affect me personally like this one. This isn't to say that this is the Kinks \"best\" album either, however - musically, it's probably not. It's just this one means more to me on a personal level than any of the others.\n\nTrack listing:\n\n1. 20th Century Man\n\n2. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoid Blues\n\n3. Holiday\n\n4. Skin & Bone\n\n5. Alcohol\n\n6. Complicated Life\n\n7. Here Come the People in Grey\n\n8. Have a Cuppa Tea\n\n9. Holloway Jail\n\n10. Oklahoma U.S.A.\n\n11. Uncle Son\n\n12. Muswell Hillbilly\n\n13. Mountain Woman\n\n14. Kentucky Woman\n\nAt this point in the history of the Kinks, songwriter Ray Davies had slowly wrested creative control over the group, with brother lead guitarist Dave Davies forced to labor in the background. Dave still delivers some terrific lead guitar work on this record, but his playing is no longer a focal point for the Kinks sound...\n\nUnder construction\n\nThe Kinks, led by the brothers Ray and Dave Davies, were a British invasion singles band. Those singles kicked all sorts of arse. You know what I'm talkin' bout. \"You Really Got Me\"? \"All Day and All of the Night\"? Wow, those were pretty rough & tough rockers for the mid 60s. Unlike most other Brit invasion bands, the Kinks were a genuinely talented outfit. They went on to record some of the finest albums of all time...in my book, they're the second greatest band there ever was, and the greatest English one. Sure...it wasn't all wonderful. But what band hasn't had low points? The Rolling Stones have been having primarily low points for twenty five years! But the Kinks man...they rule. Ray Davies is a paranoid, nostalgic, sometimes terribly witty stereotypically English fellow. Dave Davies is a bisexual space alien who sure can play guitar. You can find the roots of punk and alternative rock guitar in Mr. Dave'd six string playin' pretty much from the very start of the Kinks. Ray loves opera; Dave scowls at anything that doesn't have loud distorted guitars. They made odd musical partners, but I'll be darned if the music wasn't wonderful...sometimes. Ray was a more prolific songwriter than Dave, so most of the artistic control of the band went to him. And I thank God for it. Ray's a genius. Ray's fondness for opera eventually brought about a number of Kinks rock operas in the 70s. During this time, the Kinks faded into obscurity except for their devoted fan base. There's good material to be found in pretty much all Kinks albums; granted, some have less than others. But that holds true for most British groups, really. Including those crazy Beatles. American bands were more consistent, but generally(not always) less spectacular.\n\nMuswell Hillbillies is supposed to be something of a fusion between country and rock, but Ray's got too many crazy ideas to pull it off. Some tunes are countryish, but plenty are not. Instead, we have a splendid collection of country-rock, rock, vaudeville, English folk, mini operas, and even a ballad! It's quite a record. Might even be the 'perfect' album. Don't look at me like that! Yes, it might be the perfect album: almost every song can become relavent to you personally if you are in the right sort of mood. It's the opposite of 'mood music' in a way: it can't change your mood, and every song won't compliment your mood, but boy, if you find that one song that is talking to you for today... Okay, I'm going to pretty much describe every song on record here; I hope it won't annoy you.\n\nThe album opens up with a splendid rocker entitled \"20th Century Man.\" Actually, it's one of the greatest songs of all time. What wonderful lyrics! I live in a world that I can't relate to for the most part, too. Long live Ray Davies! \"I'm a twentieth century man but I don't wanna be here.\" By the time Ray gets to \"You keep all your smart modern writers, gimme William Shakespeare\" I'm always about to go \"whoo!\" and dance around like the crazed redneck I am. And I'm not even a huge Shakespeare fan! Oh...by the way, why does he pronounce \"Van Gogh\" as \"Bam-Bam\"? The vocals are pretty hard to follow on this record, which is why you'll likely need a lyrics sheet(if you're interested....I know most of you ain't interested in this paranoid schizophrenic stuff, but I am!). The only thing that bothers me about this song is the keyboard. It's not necessary; I'd rather hear the guitars thank you very much. It ends with a fine little inobtrusive bass line....good work Johnny Dalton!\n\n\"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoid Blues\" isn't a bad song, either; I like it cuz of the crazy vocal intonations. Schizophreena, scheezophreena, scheezophrena disease! Hey, I got it. You got it! Me and you! Most people hate it, however. The horns used to bug me a bit, too, but now I find them quite enjoyable. Maybe I'm stupider than you?\n\n\"Holiday\" was the first song that really caught my ear the first time I heard this record. It never has quite managed to effect me as much as on that occasion, but it is a fine lazy piano tune straight from the early decades of this century. Back when men were men, women were women, and children were axe murdering maniacs. This tune also boasts a pretty nice what-I-believe-to-be an attempted Bob Dylan impression! Sure, I've heard better, but at least it's better than my Bob Dylan impression!\n\nI'm the only person who likes \"Skin & Bone\", as far as I know. I don't know what's wrong with you people. That riff is fantastic! The whole song is a great pop moment! Awww...baby, let's boogie!\n\n\"Alcohol\" is a spooky tuba and trumpet driven mini-opera....originally, I thought the chorus was \"demon of the phone.\" \"But he messed up his life when he beat up his wife...\" Good song concernin' the devestating effects of liquor upon humans.\n\n\"Complicated Life\" is a laidback C&W song, but not in a hickish way. The sustained guitar is quite pleasant. However, the rest of the song doesn't do a whole lot for me(other than having good lyrics). I gotta get away from the complicated life, too.\n\n\"Here Come the People in Grey\" is a kickass rock'n'roller. Listen to that riff! Most bands would use it as a intro, and then quickly lead it into something else. Not the Kinks. I'm gonna find me a one man revolution, gonna beat the people in grey...but oh no, here come the people in grey to take me away! One of the best songs on the album, though it's not complex at all.\n\n\"Have a Cuppa Tea\" is a happy little tune from the English countryside. The \"hallelujah!\" chorus is quite rousing, but I can do without the rest of the song. When I first heard the song, I thought it was \"Have a Cappacino.\" I just thought you might be interested. Actually, maybe I couldn't do without this song...dammit, I like it!\n\n\"Holloway Jail\" is a pretty great acoustic/electric guitar rock ballad. Even if the opener does sound, briefly, a lot like the Turtles \"Happy Together.\" Groovin' piano, too.\n\n\"Oklahoma U.S.A.\" is a remarkably pretty piano ballad....quite a change up.\n\n\"Muswell Hillbilly\" is another lovely song...a reflective but not at all angry protest with honestly ironic lyrics: it talks 'bout Ray's being an American country boy from England.\n\n\"Mountain Woman\" wears itself tiresome on my fragile nerves. It's not a bad song, per se, but just doesn't do a whole lot for me personally.\n\n\"Kentucky Moon\" is a drunken piano ditty. Neat intermittent moody guitar. I guess I described all but one of the songs. Not so bad. I'd give the album a '9' for sure, if it wasn't for the bonus track \"Mountain Woman.\" \"Kentucky Woman\" is also a bonus track, but I like it, I told you that. I rhymed track and that, if you didn't notice. Ain't I cool? No?\n\nMost of the Kinks' 70s releases have been recently rereleased, remixed and with bonus tracks(it is the new remixed CD version of this album that I've reviewed here). Happily, this means these fine albums will not go out of print for another few years. Eventually, I'll be reviewing the whole Kinks discography(including imports) but give me lots of time! The Kinks rule, though...they're worth spending all your money on!\n\n8 stars(out of 10)\n\nEverybody's In Showbiz by the Kinks(1972)\n\nNever trust anyone else's opinion implicitly, for there's a very good chance that they, no matter how bright they might be, are completely wrong. Unfortunately, I accepted the general consensus concerning this Kinks album for far too long. On first listen, the record did sound to me to be just like everyone said it was: a Muswell Hillbillies with better production and fewer good songs. So I brushed it aside for the time being. Recently, however, I've given this double album a few attentive listens, and what do you know? I love it! Not everything is peaches and cream, for sure, but it's a very entertaining, in-character album for the Kinks. I'm guessing that most Kinks fans lack a sense of humor and a taste for instrument interplay; if they had either of those two things, they'd like this record a lot more. For me, at least, Muswell Hillbillies was a very serious musical work, but this album is a downright COMEDY record. I mean it - most of the lyrics are humorous, and many of the song concepts are hilarious as well. The music is fine, too, still sounding somewhat countryish, but with tons of very intelligent interplay going on between the guitars, piano, and horns. I'll repeat it again: how on Earth can people not like this album more? It's great! Is everybody so obsessed with finding something \"revolutionary\" that they're too busy to be entertained? I wonder.\n\nHere's the track listing:\n\n1. Here Comes Yet Another Day\n\n2. Maximum Consumption\n\n3. Unreal Reality\n\n4. Hot Potatoes\n\n5. Sitting In My Hotel\n\n6. Motorway\n\n7. You Don't Know My Name\n\n8. Supersonic Rocket Ship\n\n9. Look A Little On The Sunnyside\n\n10. Celluloid Heroes\n\n11. Top Of The Pops\n\n12. Brainwashed\n\n13. Mr. Wonderful\n\n14. Acute Schizophrenia Paranoia Blues\n\n15. Holiday\n\n16. Muswell Hillbillies\n\n17. Alcohol\n\n18. Banana Boat Song\n\n19. Skin & Bone\n\n20. Baby Face\n\n21. Lola\n\n22. Till The End Of The Day\n\n23. She's Bought A Hat Like Princess Marina\n\nEverybody's In Showbiz is a double album, half studio and half live. The live half I could pretty much do without: it's some oldies, some novelty tunes, and a bunch of great Muswell Hillbillies songs performed in improper order and no longer sounding all that impressive. The studio half is where it's at, though! The Kinks lineup for this album included Alan Holmes and Davy Jones on saxophones and clarinet, Mike Cotton on trumpet, John Beecham on trombone and tuba, and Dave Rowberry on organ in addition to the core band of Ray and Dave Davies on piano, vocals, and guitars, John Gosling on keyboards, John Dalton on bass, and Mick Avory on the drums. Ray Davies is actually a skilled composer who is, last I heard, working on composing a classical piece full of English pastoral music, thus it's no surprise that under his direction the horns sound wonderful and fully integrated into the Kinks sound on this record. Dave Davies altered his guitar tone a bit for this album. It's less distorted and sweeter than usual. It also sounds as if he may have been experimenting with slide a teensy bit. Either way, his leads on this record out George Harrison George Harrison and his countryish licks twang with a bang. And Ray? Well, he's the same Ray he's always been, but he's feeling awful chipper and funny. Singing marvellously well and generally coming with some excellent tunage - even his ripoffs from other artists(and there are a few) on this record usually sound better than the original.\n\nThe album's studio half opens with \"Here Comes Yet Another Day\" a song I believe belongs in that long list of Kinks klassics. Opening with the soft echoes of an organ, it quickly is turned over to Dave Davies who kicks in a nice heavy riff, and John Dalton quickly follows suit. The horns compliment Dave and John perfectly. There's room for both a guitar and trumpet/sax lead.\n\n\"Maximum Consumption\" starts out slow and plodding with Ray reciting a rather lengthy list of food he's intending on consuming, but then the main melody kicks in and everything becomes much nicer. Smart, short instrument interludes here too: piano here, guitar there, saxophone voici, trumpet voila. Dave Davies in particular serves a couple ultra-sweet, delicious guitar lines that rank about as high as any he's ever performed. Did I mention it's a funny little song, too? As I see it, while Mr. Dave Davies is living the rock'n'roll lifestyle, Ray's just been sitting about in his hotel room watching episodes of Petticoat Junction. Unlike Muswell Hillbillies, where Ray was venting his frustrations with the \"unreal realities\" of existence, here on Everybody's In Showbiz he's trying to create an unreal reality of his own in his music. The humor on this record comes across as a tiny bit more rural than Ray's standard fare; if we must look for correlations between this record and Muswell Hillbillies, we may link up a few of these songs as the humorous equivalent of songs like \"Complicated Life\" on Muswell Hillbillies.\n\nAnd \"Unreal Reality\" is a real barnstormer. It starts out with this drawn-out, sub-Broadway lush horn opening in which Ray is featured really drawwwwllllling out his words. Hilarious. The actual song is really peppy, mostly led by the dancing bass of John Dalton and once again, the horns. Great escapist lyrics, too. \"All around me it's such a reality...\" Ah, me too, Ray.\n\nI don't know quite what to make of \"Hot Potatoes.\" I swear I've heard that Harrison-like guitar line before, but I can't recall where. Is this tune a cover? The song's just okay by me, real cute lyrics. Real cute song. Real cute melodies. Let's move on.\n\nOh, maybe we better not move on. The next song is \"Sitting In My Hotel.\" I was pretty shocked when I first heard the tune: it's obviously a partial ripoff of that great English composer Richard Starkey's seminal opus, \"An Octopus' Garden in G Minor.\" Smart guy that Ray is however, he really makes the song go in directions far removed from Ringo's masterwork. It's not so bad a song, for a piano ballad. Appropriately forceful and impressive sounding. Just not as good as those first three tunes.\n\nThank the Lord for allowing Ray to quickly recover his form, albeit temporarily. (Thank you Lord. {Amen}) I love \"Motorway.\" It's foot stomping country music straight outta Muswell Hills, bub, with some super rolling keyboards that sound like a certain Johann Sebastian Bach in one of his gidder moments. And what's with that John Dalton guy, anyway? Was he always this good? His bass lines throughout the record are pretty terrific. I'll have to listen for him more closer on the other records now...\n\n\"You Don't Know My Name\" is a perfectly average Dave Davies song(much like most Dave Davies songs.) The vocals are reminiscent of Rod Stewart. (That is no stunning indictment of the song, mind you - I just think it's funny.) I don't really like the clarinet imitating a flute, so the song's pretty much ruined for me.\n\nThe album's sole hit(in England. In America nobody even knew this album existed) was \"Supersonic Rocket Ship.\" It's real soft and gentle, and I like it. What's the main instrument? Banjo? Cuatro? Sanxian? Balalaika? Bouzouki? The song's concept concerns, appropriately enough, a utopian supersonic rocket ship where everybody gets along and there's no discrimination, presumably without the aid of marijuana. I love the sudden horn rendition of the main melody. Nice saxophone murmurings towards the end as well.\n\nOkay, I'm not going to pretend \"Look A Little On The Sunnyside\" is really very good, but at least it's amusing, biting, and totally sarcastic - like a \"Lola\" for a generation of people who lived during a time before the birth of Raymond Davies. Being the great populist that he is, Ray just wants to broaden his audience a bit. I suspect it is very popular in graveyards these days(ever read \"Bobok\" by Dostoyevsky?).\n\nThe album's only widely acknowledged classic among Kinks fans is the twenty minute ballad \"Celluloid Heroes.\" The tune concerns the Golden Age of Hollywood, the stars that lived and died during that period, and the metaphors which connect us to them. It's very, very good...lyrically. Musically there's absolutely nothing going on. Still, the song concept is strong enough to keep even my attention...usually. It's a fitting end to this mostly fun'n'games album, for it burns with actual emotional resonance (something the rest of the albums doesn't even try to do.)\n\nNow we have the live side. I haven't much to say about this. I'm not too interested in the live versions of Muswell Hillbillies as none of them are as good as the studio versions except possibly \"Alcohol\" but I'd even prefer that ditty's studio counterpart. In fact, they downright slaughter every other Muswell tune besides \"Alcohol.\" The band does have a good time on most of these songs at least... \"Top of the Pops\" is a good, heavy rocker that sounds quite similar to some of the material Dave Davies performs at his solo shows(he doesn't rely completely on his own material, which is a good thing!). \"Brainwashed\" sounds like the theme song of an old spy television show. It's actually pretty good, but the vocals are overbearing.\n\n\"Mr. Wonderful\" is a forty second, relaxed jazz tune Ray pulled out of a nearby cotton gin. Fun for the fans, fun for Ray, fun for me, fun for you, we must have the acute schizophrenia paranoia blues. In a nutshell: \"Babyface\" and \"Banana Boat Song\" are cute singalongs, \"Lola\" is ruined, and the last two bonus tracks are worth listening to. I too have the ability to encapsulate.\n\nFinal thoughts. Gather round, chill'un, and hear me a' talkin' to ya. This record is a vital one that should be owned and revered by every Kinks fan. Or not, I suppose - if people really find this album so dull and commonplace, that's their perogative. People sure are strange, sultry creatures, aren't they? It marks the true end of an era for the Kinks, as they would come crashing to the ground with two of their worst records, the Preservation series of rock operas. Of course, it's possible I might even enjoy those two albums more now, but I highly doubt it. You'll have to wait for my next reviews to find out...\n\n8 stars(out of 10)\n\nReader Thoughts\n\nbburks@comp.uark.edu (Brian Burks)\n\nAppropriate for the album, you give a similiarly jovial, sloppy review. Not that that's bad or anything. You think that \"Unreal Reality\" is one of the better songs? It's got the exact same melody as \"Acute Schizophrenia Paranoid Blues\", which for me was one of Muswell Hillbillies' few stinkers. And \"Sitting In My Hotel\" is actually the first good song the Kinks arrive at on this album - the first three suck! Anyway, other than that I pretty much agree with your review - not as good as the five or six previous albums, but good nonetheless. The Preservation concept albums suck, needless to say. By the way, Rod Stewart was actually good for a few years, and about as good as what the Stones were doing at the time -- but he sold out in the mid-'70s and has never made a good record since, just like the Stones.\n\nPreservation Act 1 by the Kinks(1973)\n\nThis is an album I've been trying to avoid reviewing for a long time. Why? Well, you see, the Kinks are about my second favorite band of all time(before only CCR), and this album marks the beginning of their decline. Their fall from grace was not so sudden as is often said - indeed, this record is a reasonable collection, if a little depressing because few of the songs remain at a high level of quality from beginning to finish. I do consider this album, as compared to all the other albums ever made, to be above the average.\n\nBut just why is this album so disappointing compared to say, Muswell Hillbillies or Everybody's in Showbiz, the two albums which preceeded it? It's not simply that this doesn't have as many good songs as those did, though it doesn't. The real reason I don't like this album a whole lot is because I just don't know why this record exists. By no means does it carve out its own niche like Muswell did(with the brilliant lyrics, muffled vocals, and off-kilter instrumental backup) or even like Showbiz did(with the contagious humor and superb instrument interplay). What makes this so ironic is that this is an album \"designed\" to mean something...a concept album. I use the term \"concept album\" very loosely, as everybody does, though. Like most albums of the kind, not all of the songs here relate at all to the concept(and these songs that don't relate at all are the good ones!). Now, this is fine if you've got a record like the Who Sells Out because that's an album designed to have regular songs next to the conceptual stuff(the fake ads, jingles, and what not) - the whole idea centers around this curious juxapositioning! But Preservation Act I is supposed to be telling a story. Imagine, say, you're reading a Dickens novel and in the middle of it Dickens inserts three little short stories he's written recently that have no relation at all to the plot of the novel. Wouldn't that novel become the least bit disjointed? Surely! By the way, Ray's \"Preservation Act I\" story concerns the rise of a political leader(capitalist pig Flash) who, concerned only with his own preservation and not at all with the welfare of the people, rules with iron fists and a tongue laced with nothing but the finest bull excrement in the land. You might think, \"Well, this is a reasonable concept. An interesting story. Ray's quite the smart man, perhaps he really does have something to say about politics.\" Maybe he does, but as for me I much more appreciate Ray the personal, genuine songwriter - the man who sang of the despair he feels when he looks at the hopeless reality around him that can never match his dreams. The man who wrote and sang and composed the songs for Muswell Hillbillies. I appreciate all the other sides of Ray Davies, too, but that's the record that I admire the most just for the songwriting.\n\nIf we dispose the concept for a moment and examine this album as merely an arbitrary collection of songs, I think you might be pleased with what you find...to a certain extent. I do like a lot of the songs here, and I'll discuss them in a minute, but it's important to say that this record doesn't really break any new ground for the Kinks. Though there are as usual some excellent guitar/piano parts in many of the songs, the quality of the instrumental work is largely a decline from Showbiz standards. Though horns are used in a couple of songs here, they tend to detract rather than add to the songs wherein they are featured. There isn't a whiff of jazz anywhere to be heard - instead, Ray's become seriously interested in light opera(I mean in the sense of \"serious\" Broadway musicals and the like), and it shows. Not in all the songs, mind yeh...there IS some good old rock and roll to be found, too, thank the good Lord, but I do miss the jazz/ragtime influences very much. On the other hand, Ray is singing very well - very forcefully, and with that distinctive \"rough edge\" that exudes so much personality. But I can't think of a record off hand which features Ray really singing \"badly\" - he's just a great singer! I even love his Muswell Hillbillies mumblings. Dependably, he comes up with a few great melodies even to match these tunes, though it must be said with an asterisk that a couple do resemble other melodies which shall remain nameless that Ray sang about...oh, four or five years before the release of this album.\n\nWhat about the other critics...what do they have to say? Well, this record as far as I know got pretty roundly trashed when it came out, and it didn't sell too many copies, much like all the other 70s Kinks albums after Lola. What's more important is how the various net critics think! Brian Burks wrote a good review(in fact, his Kinks reviews are the best I've found) and said many of the things I'm about to say in a more concise and excellent manner - I do really agree with him on this, especially about Ray's lyric \"wordiness\" getting in the way of a couple good melodies! George Starostin really trashed this one...I hadn't remembered he knocked it so bad! He is right in his criticisms, too, and in fact he's written the most definitively \"brutal\" review of this record you'll ever find. As for me, the Kinks are one of my favorite bands of all time, and because of that I can find something to enjoy even on their clinkers.\n\nHere's the track listing of the reissued release of this album:\n\n1. Preservation\n\n2. Morning Song\n\n3. Daylight\n\n4. Sweet Lady Genevieve\n\n5. There's A Change In The Weather\n\n6. Where Are They Now?\n\n7. One Of The Survivors\n\n8. Cricket\n\n9. Money And Corruption/I Am Your Man\n\n10. Here Comes Flash\n\n11. Sitting In The Midday Sun\n\n12. Demolition\n\n13. One Of The Survivors(single version)\n\nThe reissued version of this album opens with a song not included in the original version: \"Preservation\", a single designed to introduce the public(what public?) to Ray's storyline. It's a fairly good song, but the guitar line is rather blatantly stolen from Jimi Hendrix...not the most subtle thing the brothers Davies have ever done. I appreciate it being tacked onto this release as it nicely chronicles the story Ray's trying to tell, a story that can be lost amongst all the non-conceptual songs on this album.\n\n\"Morning Song/Daylight\" is something differently entirely. I like it very, very much - it's almost my favorite song on the record, though unfortunately the boys end up ruining it. Or maybe not - if you believe the CD, \"Morning Song\" and \"Daylight\" are two different songs! I don't believe it, though, they segue too perfectly. They are the same song. It starts out gently and extremely quietly, with Ray humming and a cello lilting in the background(brilliantly, too...it sounds like a female voice, but it's not!). The string part becomes more developed(whoever they had playing was very, very good) and begins to take center stage away from Ray's gentle humming...then we hear a slam or two on the old bass drum(which continues to provide excellent rhythmic thrust throughout the rest of the song), an infectious, but quiet acoustic guitar riff crops up and Ray starts singing with all his heart: \"Daylight over the Village Green early in the morning, Daylight over the hills and and valleys heralding the morning, Daylight over the mountains and the Village Green...\" A chill goes down from my spine to my little toe. This is one of the greatest moments in Kinks history right there - such an anthemic, such a perfect opening! And the way Ray pronounces the opening lines over the ringing guitar line is...classic. Brilliant. It touches me deep down to my Mississippi soul. It's so peaceful and so pastoral yet so rebellious and jarring - that's my sort of punk rock, folx. Unfortunately, it's only brilliant for about ten seconds...but those ten seconds! I wish they would last forever. Ah, well. I'll never forgive the Kinks for ruining this song, easily the most moving and beautiful an opus my mortal ears have ever heard. But they certainly proceed to do so in grand style: the beautiful melody which opens the song is soon replaced by a weaker one, and then the song ventures into ridiculous pastures: horrendous cutesy trumpet playing over Ray's semi-sacharine lyrics. Aghhhhh! How could they do this to me? At least there's a stirring reprise, \"I thank God I'm still around to see another dawn...\" But it could have been so much better. Sigh. It's a good example of Ray's understanding of rural values and genuineness, though - unusual for a city boy. For those ten seconds, and the blissful peace of \"Morning Song\"...beautiful.\n\nI really like \"Sweet Lady Genevieve\", too - a upbeat, unashamedly pop song with a great harmonica, excellent bass drumming, and great understated guitar playing. You have, however, heard a few songs like it before, undoubtedly. I really like the harp and guitar hook, though. And the gorgeous melody, too, I suppose.\n\n\"There's A Change In The Weather\", on the other hand, doesn't do a whole lot for me. It starts out rather reggae-ish, against the beat, then proceeds without a blush into more cutesy trumpet playing and sacharine lyrics from Ray, and THEN into a rather dull opera influenced section. When the cutesy trumpet playing returns, there are even some female backup vocals. I could do without it. The melody gets on my nerves, then stomps on 'em with childish glee.\n\n\"Where Are They Now?\" is a ballad in the grand Ray Davies tradition. A few piano chords struck lightly, a beautiful melody, meaningful lyrics. Extremely formulaic, but somehow always moving if not entirely impressive musically. Among other things, Ray's asking where the Angry Young Men now - those literary heroes from our literary past(the 50s) whose words demanded they be noticed despite their having extremely goofy names such as \"Sillitoe.\" It's worth listening to just to hear Ray sound like Tom Petty. And it is affecting, too. Makes me want to take a seat at the piano, hit a few keys at random and pretend to play a melody, then bellow in my best nasal voice,\n\n\"Where are the steady boys now?\n\n\"Where are the angry young men now?\"\n\nIt's that kind of song. I do enjoy it, but it's not genius.\n\n\"One Of The Survivors\" opens with an electric guitar riff inspired by Keith Richards' legendary \"Street Fighting Man\" acoustic slashing. To dislike this song would be to dislike rock'n'roll itself - it's rockabilly accompanied by a 50s style horn section, Chuck Berry style guitar soloing, and an alt rock mid-section riff. So I like it, but I also like Elvis, Carl Perkins, Gene Vincent, Bill Haley, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. Hey, and the lyrics are about a 50s throwback who still listens to his old records and rides his motorcycle like the cool dude he once was. It's that kind of song. I do enjoy it, but it's not genius.\n\n\"Cricket\" is my favorite of the Broadway-style musical material which dominates the latter half of the album. It's tough for me to really enjoy those rather superflous horns and plodding tuba line knowing how superbly these same instruments were used on the last two Kinks records, but the melody is okay enough, and the lyrics are slightly amusing and quite off-beat. \"It(cricket) has honor, it has courage, and it's British.\"\n\n\"Money And Corruption/I Am Your Man\" is rather bland. The vocal only opening section sounds like a rather mediocre Christmas song, though the protestant lyrics are good. It doesn't get much better till the second section(\"I Am Your Man\"), which features a tinkly piano, gentle bass guitar playing, and Ray calmly reciting Flash's lies very sincerely. If you are listening to this album like an opera which is telling you a story with words as well as music, you should enjoy this section very much as it exists primarily to serve as a vehicle for Ray's story. But if you're listening to this for the songs, as I suspect most of us are, this will probably bore you. It's not good opera as I understand it(I like Mozart and Wagner, not Broadway), but I spose it tolerable enough if you like this sort of music...whatever exactly it is. I find it rather disposable myself.\n\n\"Here Comes Flash\"'s major contribution to the world of music is the neat surf/spy theme guitar line that sounds like something that might've been on the Cure's first album. I actually enjoy it, though it's all a bit silly - it's energetic, and the vocal sections(periodically featuring a male chorus and a female soloist) are rather good.\n\n\"Sitting In The Midday Sun\" is more blandness - clearly harking back to several songs in the Kinks past, it never ceases to bore me. Decent lyrics, but it's not like Ray hasn't written enough songs about the sun as it is, and this is coming from someone who very much enjoys sitting in the midday sun himself. The melody is rather tiresome, and the lounge musical backup doesn't really work for me.\n\n\"Demolition\" also leaves me underwhelmed at first. I don't enjoy the melody, the lyrics, or the instrumentation, though I don't hate 'em either. The dramatic \"Demolition\" chorus with the quivering female vox sounds like an outtake from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The gentle \"na na na na na\" chorus is more to my liking, and the horns end it well.\n\nThe reissued version of the album ends on a positive note: the single version of \"One of the Survivors\", which features better vocals, horns(especially), and guitars than the album version.\n\nI do recommend this album, but only get it after you've picked up six or seven better Kinks albums. And beware: I don't think the opera really succeeds due to the unrelated songs which fragment the storyline.\n\n6 stars(out of 10)\n\nLed Zeppelin III by, unbelievably, Led Zeppelin(1970)\n\nLed Zeppelin are the sort of band that tends to evoke a strong reaction from an audience. Their fans number in the millions, and the band's spawned more imitators than probably any other band this century aside from the Beatles. Zepheads will be quick to tell you of Robert Plant's amazing \"operatic\" vocal deliveries and Jimmy Page's legendary nimble-fingered virtuoso guitar playing. But Zep detractors will be equally quick to inform you of Page's rather infamous habit of stealing from other people's songs. A few of them will even tell you that Robert Plant is a horrendous, annoying, and one-dimensional singer. Who's right? Well, both are, sort of. At one time in my life, I hated Led Zeppelin with all my might. They were anathema. I had good reason to loath them so, because, you see, back in the days when I actually listened to radio, I was a pretty avid classic rock radio listener. Like any other avid classic rock radio listener, I was subjected to a whole lotta Zeppelin. And a whole lot of BORING, CRAPPY Zeppelin, too. Why is that some of the band's most boring songs became hits? It wasn't until much later when I actually gave a couple actual albums a full listen that I realized that this was a band capable of producing some pretty good rock'n'roll songs. But, still, there's plenty that annoys me about this band to this day. Robert Plant especially. His womanly wails and ear splitting shrieks are just more than I can bear. And what's with his little fake orgasm impressions, anyway? I guess somebody had to influence Donna Summer, but did it have to be one of the best selling rock bands of all time? As for Jimmy Page, well, I guess he was just another drug addicted musician. Sometimes he sounds amazing, other times he just sounds dull and lazy. Oh, and the other two members of Led Zeppelin were John \"Boy\" Bonham on the percussionoms and John Paul Jones, revolutionary hero, on the keyboards and the bass. They're both pretty good. Actually, JP is my favorite member of the band. He gets more attention now than he used to, but don't ever think he's \"just another bassist.\" He was integral to that Zep sound! Now, view the track list and rest in peace:\n\n1. Immigrant Song\n\n2. Friends\n\n3. Celebration Day\n\n4. Since I've Been Loving You\n\n5. Out on the Tiles\n\n6. Gallows Pole\n\n7. Tangerine\n\n8. That's the Way\n\n9. Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\n\n10. Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\n\nAs a forewarning for you, I'll say that I don't have all the Led Zeppelin albums(but you can't expect me to, can you? I'm just not that big of a fan.) No Presence, In Through the Out Door, Song Remains the Same, or Coda for me yet. However, I have heard a lot of what is on those(aside from Song Remains the Same - only heard clips from that live recording), so I can say with a reasonable amount of confidence that Led Zeppelin III is my favorite Led Zeppelin album. For me, it's the total package: some pure, great hard rock(which Zeppelin are famed for producing) mixed with some progressive, experimentary multi-instrumented material that is surprisingly good.\n\nIII opens with a bang. \"Immigrant Song\" is a killer riff rocker though it features some pretty abysmal vocals from Robert Plant(this is the song where he keeps yapping \"Ahhhhh....ahhhhh...ahhhhh!\" for no apparent reason whatsoever.) Fortunately, the heavy guitars do what heavy guitars should do unless John Fogerty's singing: drain out the vocals. \"Friends\" is a personal favorite tune of mine. It may not really be Middle Eastern \"tinged\" as every critic proclaims it to be, but it definitely sounds pretty foreign, especially coming from Led Zeppelin. Real cool, perfectly arranged(courtesy of John Paul Jones, I believe) string work. Does anyone know what the main instrument is? Is it really a guitar? If so, Jimmy's using a pretty awesome alternate tuning for the song. \"Celebration Day\" and \"Out on the Tiles\" return the band to hard rockin' territory. Both are pretty good songs with interesting electric six string work from Page. On the downside, they're both maybe a little bit too long(have you noticed that nearly every Led Zeppelin rock song starts out really hard and fast only to totally have the energy suddenly sucked out of it so Plant can do his thing for a couple minutes?). Speaking of long songs, \"Since I've Been Loving You\" clocks in at seven minutes and twenty four seconds. Musically, it's kind of generic - I've heard hundreds of these \"lounge blues\" type ditties that normally sensible musicians like to play when they want to slow things down \"for the ladies\", though I bet if you asked the ladies they'd rather here something grittier too. Pretty guitar work, but ALL of these sort of songs have pretty guitar work. Ever the conscientous plagiarist, Jimmy Page at least distracts us with a heavy riff here and there. John Paul Jones(I guess...) is back playing the organ as well, for the all important \"atmospheric\" effect. On the upside, Robert Plant's vocal delivery in this song inspired Axl Rose's entire style! Woo hoo! Now that we've got the rock'a'roll and generic ballad out of the way, it's time to go experimental(like on \"Friends\"). \"Gallows Pole\" is one of the best songs on the record. Great guitar and banjo(!) playing. This may sound corny, but I honestly love it when the banjo kicks in and goes off on a solo. It's beautiful! That's music! In this regard, I do think of Led Zeppelin as revolutionaries: they saw that all instruments could be used in different ways to fit a particular song(ie a banjo is not necessarily just a country or folk musical instrument). Did you know the mandolin started out as a classical instrument? Several notable composers composed for it, in fact. But in the twentieth century it's become an almost exclusive mainstay of bluegrass and country bands. I only find the two ballads \"Tangerine\" and \"That's the Way\" passably interesting. They're both good, mind you - the ballad just ain't my favorite musical form in the world, unless we're talking Fernando Carulli. It's \"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\" that excites my attention more. Musically, it's almost pure country - John Bonham's heavy bass drumming really makes the tune. And my oh my, that Page can play some dern HEAVY country muzak! Garth Brooks ought to listen to this sometime. This is the song that I personally return to the most for return listening, even though it's not my favorite song on the album. It's a real pity that this record has to end on a ROTTEN note: \"Hats Off to (Roy) Harper\" which I see to be a rather poor and shameless imitation of Robert Johnson. Plant is even imitating Robert in the vocals???? And the production is purposefully low-fi to further complete that Johnson effect. Worst of all, the song is only credited as being \"traditional\" - not a mention for Robert anywhere. It's so blatant I can't fathom what the band wanted to prove with the song.\n\nAll in all though, this is an excellent album. Especially recommended for guitar players, as Jimmy plays electric, acoustic, steel, and slide guitar on the record very well - not to mention banjo :). I give it an eight. Now I believe I'll go dust my broom, yeaaah.\n\n8 stars(out of 10)\n\nLed Zeppelin IV by Led Zeppelin(1971)\n\nNote: Of course, this album doesn't have much of a name so I decided to just conform and call it IV like most folks do.\n\nThere's one trait that most of the consistently overrated albums of the classic rock genre share: brilliant production. The first time you put on Sgt. Pepper or The Dark Side of the Moon how can you help but be blown away by the sheer sound of it all? Those albums SOUND classic - unique, original, amazing. Unfortunately, the more one listens to said albums the more one realizes that despite the great production there simply aren't that many great songs. One of the nice things about being alive in the 90s is that we're becoming more and more acclimated to well produced bands that really suck, hence we can take a clearer look at these supposed classics. Garbage are a good example of this 90s production phenomeneon. Their songs sound anthemic, well-crafted, and classic enough at first listen, but pretty soon you realize: Hey! This is really crap! There's no real music going on! It's mainly production! Of course, you know as well as I do that Led Zeppelin didn't suck - along with the Beatles, they are the most influential rock band there is. And every album they released has a few good songs, this included. But in no way does this album deserve to be one of the best selling rock albums of all time. For my money, it's weaker than LZ's own III. Quite like DSOTM and Sgt. Pepper, this is a little record that people just don't pull out all that often - even fans of the record admit this, though they still try to claim it as pure genius. It's true that it has been widely overplayed on radio, but that doesn't matter - I'd still get sick of these songs even if they weren't overplayed.\n\nA little history, if you hah. By this time(1971), Zep were of course very, very big. The first two records were best sellers, the third was considered a misstep by critics but loved by hardcore fans, and as a live act there was basically no bigger draw in the world. III might have been the band's greatest artistic triumph, with its skillful combination of heavy and fast rock'n'roll and decidedly unique takes on folk and world music - it certainly shows the most depth in songwriting for the band, and makes their later attempts at diversity(Houses Of The Holy, anyone?) seem disappointing indeed. And yet people weren't going for III as much as they should have been. Zep's image was still as the heavy rockahs who would only occasionally wax mystical. To return to the top of the charts, clearly Zep had to return to their blues-rock/mystical balladeering specialty. And so they did. The rockers don't rock as hard or as fast or as excitingly as the ones on III, but for a world that would soon fall in love with the soothing sounds of Bad Company they were quite alright. And the ballads - well, they were very popular, too. The folk elements which made III such an interesting little record have been pushed to the background, allowed to shine on but a couple of tracks. Clearly, the public's demands had been heeded...and III would never be equalled.\n\nHere's the track listing:\n\n1. Black Dog\n\n2. Rock And Roll\n\n3. The Battle of Evermore\n\n4. Stairway to Heaven\n\n5. Misty Mountain Hop\n\n6. Four Sticks\n\n7. Going To California\n\n8. When The Levee Breaks\n\nIn order to maintain my \"integrity\" as a reviewer, I try to listen to an album three or four times over the course of a few days before writing up a review - especially if it is an important album like this one. This review might just be radically different(well, perhaps not radically, but at least more kind) if I had given a lazy single re-listen to this record before writing it up, because all of these songs have the capability to impress when taken in small doses. Unfortunately, most all of these songs have the capability to bore and to annoy when listened to often, something great music never does. I'm not talking about listening to this record every day - it becomes annoying even if it is listened to every week or every month. At least to me that is. Ah, well, never you mind. I don't hear any of the guys at the band at their best here with the notable exception of drummer John Bonham, who is absolutely amazing throughout. Jimmy Page's biggest weakness as a guitarist is his tendency to rely on repetitious riffs. This is a true shame as there are few guitarists who use the \"exotic\" guitar tunings that Page frequently uses so effectively. And while he does come up with a few drop-dead gorgeous guitar lines and rockin' riffs on this album, the mind numbing repetition gets old in a hurry. The fact that Page doesn't have a good vocalist to lean back on hurts him as well - Robert Plant is at his high-pitched, obtrusive worst on this here album. You may swoon at how his elfin wails suit the Tolkien-inspired lyrics just perfectly, but I don't go for it. Some of the lyrics are pretty good in their mystical little way, though...I mean, millions of people read Tolkien, but not very many could sit down and write something so loosely poetic and enigmatic as \"Stairway to Heaven\". And what of John Paul Jones? He's playing some keyboards pretty well, but his bass playing has been pushed off to the sideline.\n\nThe album starts with two 70s rock anthems, \"Black Dog\" and \"Rock And Roll\" but, really, it's tough to praise these considering how these two songs gave birth to the risible genre of 70s mainstream cock rock - just a heavy(but not too heavy) riff repeated over and over again and a guy singing is all. A boring solo for good effect. The riffs are good, mind you: \"Black Dog\" is actually the first Zep song I heard that I liked as a kid listening to classic rock radio, though after hearing it twenty more times during the same week the novelty of the tune wore off pretty quick. And \"Rock And Roll\" is really catchy with some phenomenal drumming from Mr. Bonham! But I can't stand Plant's vocals - he gets my vote for the most annoying vocalist of all time, surpassing even Jon Anderson. The solo on \"Rock And Roll\" is better than the solo on \"Black Dog\" but it probably should be still better than it is - ends really nicely, but it is mostly just boring wankin'.\n\nThe album goes into another, softer direction following the bombast of the opening two tracks. \"The Battle of Evermore\" is the most self-consciously English folkie of all the tunes, and it is lovely enough. The mandolins and the guitars shimmer and shine gently over the sea. Even Fairport Convention's Sandy Denny makes an appearance. But I can't say the song is one of my favorites. It comes across sounding more contrived than Zep's folk stylings on III - I definitely don't listen to this song and think to myself, \"Wow, Led Zeppelin are really in touch with their English folk roots. They're so genuine!\" I just think, oh, okay, Led Zeppelin is writing an English folk song with more mystical lyrics. Admittedly, I do tend to prefer American and Eastern folk music(perhaps even African!) over European folk music, but still... The song which catapulted Zeppelin from mere rock'n'roll demi-gods to the status classic rock gods was of course \"Stairway to Heaven\". It's one of the most played tracks in radio history - to this day it is played on a near daily basis by most classic rock radio stations in the United States of America. So that's a reason to hate the song, I suppose. I, too, have heard it more times than I would have liked to. Yet it is also unquestionably a very original and good song in my mind. It delivers two things Zeppelin rarely deliver: good lyrics and a good melody, while it lacks what usually constitutes Zeppelin's greatest strength: excellent guitar playing. The guitar playing is decent, mind ye, but minimalistic - the \"rock\" section in particular come across sounding more like a statement of intent than anything special musically. The mournful organ playing gives the song much of the atmosphere. And the lyrics are poetry. \"It is whispered that soon, if we all call the tune, the piper shall lead us to reason, and a new day will dawn, for those who stand long...And the forests will echo with laughter.\" Certainly, this is Zep's best \"mystical\" ballad, though perhaps not their greatest moment. It may, however, be Plant's greatest moment - he only sounds annoying on the \"ooh it makes me wonder\"'s.\n\nEh, well, \"Misty Mountain Hop\" is a hippie anthem bout people with flowers in their hair and such which should suddenly make you very glad that Frank Zappa recorded Freak Out all those years ago. The counter-melody is really good, the keyboard riff is a nice touch, and the drumming is phenomenal, but it's mainly worth sitting through to hear Page's fantastic mid-section guitar line. The lyrics make me cringe on this one, and Plant's vocal antics are extremely annoying. Gosh darn it, Plant, why do you have to ruin all these songs??? \"Four Sticks\" is best described as a showcase for John Bonham's drumming: he's proving to one and to all that he can do much more than bang his set hard - he's using four sticks to imitate the even beats of a conga drum. Cool! The song just isn't that good though. The grungey riff which opens the song is good enough, but clearly Page was running out of ideas. He just uses the same riff and only adds some ethereal atmosphere(dropping back into \"sitar\" tuning, I think...can we say \"overdubs\"?) here and there for the entire rest of the song! And Plant is horrible with that lilting wail of his. Just sounds like a goof, he does. Hmmph!\n\nThe album's second \"folk\" offering is \"Going to California.\" Plant is singing the sad, reflective lyrics in a lower key for once - almost in a monotone. Page's acoustic guitar playing is not only lovely but also intensely impressive. This is definitely the only folk song I've ever heard that rips off Haydn. I recommend it highly to you and yours. It doesn't sound that much like Pearl Jam's \"Given to Fly.\" Finally, the album ends with a bloooze workout entitled \"When The Levee Breaks.\" I prefer Muddy Waters' \"When The Eagle Flies\" myself, but there's something to be said for the heavy drums and honking harmonica(played by Plant!) of this tune. It's a big fan favorite, but probably won't impress too many people who are more than casual blues listeners. It's very cool to hear Page play electric slide, though, and he does it very well. I would probably like it better if they stripped away some of the vocals and perhaps some of the drifting harmonica playing(it's seven minutes long!).\n\n7 stars(out of 10)\n\nReader Thoughts\n\n(George Starostin)\n\nMmm... let me disagree for a moment with you on here, Bryan. See, you know I'm not the biggest Led Zep fan in the world, but I still don't like it when you call the solo in 'Rock'n'Roll' 'borin' wanking'. I mean, Page's main strength, want it or not, is in his soloing: his riffing is good, too, but his soloing technique is usually what gets all the hoots. Now I'm no technical expert in this matter, but I must say I really, really like both the solo on here and on 'Stairway To Heaven', which you somehow forgot to mention. To me, that's what Jimmy is all about: dazzling his audiences with outstanding guitar pyrotechnique. That's why I'm not a fan of Led Zep III, actually: he's a good acoustic player, but an ordinary one. He doesn't do much to elevate his acoustic playing to an outstanding technical or spiritual level. He's mainly good at hacking - and hacking he does, quite impressively at that. So I really can't understand your gripes about 'Rock'n'Roll'. And the statement that 'Stairway To Heaven' lacks excellent guitar playing is really strange. That's the best solo Jimmy ever did, period. I agree that John Paul Jones and Plant are not at their best here, though. I also agree that the record IS overrated. But come on - a 9 would be a fairer deal.\n\nAnd a counter-comment from Bryan:\n\nOoh, George, this is a really good comment - so good I'm going to have to answer you in a \"counter-comment\" so I don't get a million flames. I must admit, I temporarily forgot that \"Stairway to Heaven\" is supposed to be the holy tome of guitar soloing along with \"Freebird.\" Truth is, I've never really appreciated that kind of guitar soloing. It doesn't offend me(\"wanking\" is a much more mild term for me to use than it is for Mark Prindle...), and in fact I'd probably rather hear somebody fiddle with their guitar for a few minutes than sing a mediocre melody. But there are two main \"schools\" of guitar soloing - one school says you should fit as many notes as you possibly can per bar in order to show off your fingerspeed and virtousity, and the other says you should get the maximum use out of each note you play. In general, I side with the latter school. I would never called Jimmy Page a guitarist who \"crafts\" excellent solos because most all of them have a few superflous sections(it's like I said: \"Rock And Roll\"'s solo ends very well, but it starts out generic. A more concise guitarist wouldn't have gone through such rubbish to get to the good stuff). So I would much prefer to stick with Eric Clapton(who often managed in his prime to balance intelligent, cautious soloing with impressive stretches of virtuosity as well, making him a graduate of both schools) and John Fogerty. I also admire a few jazz guitarists such as Charlie Christian and Django Reinhardt who follow similar similar philosophies. But the true master at cranking out the most out of every note is probably bluesman B.B. King.\n\nI should've commented on the solo in \"Stairway to Heaven\", however. I agree it may be Page's best solo(which, you see, coming from me doesn't mean that much) but I believe it's primarily there for \"mood\" purposes. If you stuck it in another song, not so many people would be amazed by it - it's just that slow build-up punctuated by the organ and soft guitar playing and of course Plant's vocals that makes the crescendo(the solo) so exciting. Whereas I think you could probably paste a couple of Clapton's better solos in Cream into another song and have it still impress - it might not fit the song, but they'd still amaze you!\n\nThat said, the record would easily get an eight or a nine from me if it were not for the presence of Robert Plant. He makes most of the songs an unpleasant listening experience for me. With a better vocalist, songs like \"Black Dog\" and \"Rock And Roll\" would be improved immeasurably. I find it very difficult to praise a band with such an overbearing singer, however. I'd feel guilty giving it a nine knowing that most people who could not stand Plant's vocalisms would hate it.\n\nglassmoondt@yahoo.com(Nick Karn)\n\nWhile you'd feel guilty about giving this album a 9 knowing people who don't like Plant's vocals won't be able to stand it, I'd give it a 9 and not have any problems with it, even though Plant was the one who turned me off to the band in the first place, and still makes me cringe at times. Sure, he's not a great singer, but I can certainly get used to his often annoying vocals because he fits the songs well, and the players are what really get my attention anyway. The key here is, even though the musicians may not be at their best besides Bonham (who incidentally is my favorite Zep member), they still give absolutely captivating performances. Jimmy Page's work in \"Stairway To Heaven\" definitely IS incredible- it's earned the right to have its' solo named the greatest of all time. Bonham is of course brilliant the whole way (definitely on \"Misty Mountain Hop\", which makes up for Plant's whining there, and ESPECIALLY on \"When The Levee Breaks\"... the whole world is ending with the force on that cut), and Jones is a bit buried, I agree, but still impressive. The only track I can honestly say I don't like at all is the opening \"Black Dog\" - it just seems kind of stupid and not that memorable, and when Plant's singing in \"Four Sticks\" he sounds like a freakin' girl and it irritates me, but the instrumental sections there are phenomenal, so it's still a good song. A fabulous album, but it's not their best: Physical Graffiti would be that for me, followed closely behind by Zep 2.\n\nSymphony Number 9 in D Minor by Ludwig Van Beethoven(1822, 1824)\n\nThough their place in history is forever tarnished due to their continual warmongering, the German civilization is one of the finest the world has ever seen. Their art, above all other nation's art, comes the closest to achieving pure perfection. When I say the word perfection, please don't confuse it with the word \"greatness.\" They are two different things. Perfection is simply something without flaws(relatively speaking, of course. An imperfect creature like a human being can never truly achieve perfection in anything he makes or does.) Even if something is without flaws, however, this doesn't mean that it is endowed with unique and great qualities. For example, there's nothing really bad I can say about Faust or even Also Sprach Zarathustra. These are impressive works of art that tackle the very fundamentals of life itself. Yet I can name you any number of books I like better than ASZ...is this simply taste clouding my vision? Yes, no, maybe so. I would say that there are books and plays more powerful than those two works I mentioned, even if it would be impossible to find a book or play with fewer flaws. In fact, some of the books and plays I rank higher than those two I would freely admit have many more flaws! Greatness and perfection are two very different things, indeed.\n\nAs for this musical piece, the 125th musical work of Beethoven's career, it assuredly is as close to musical perfection as anything any musician or composer ever created. It also achieves a measure of greatness, too. Faced by perfection, I acknowledge my limitations. Here, I cannot be a critic. I have no true criticisms to make. I can, however, be a reviewer. I can tell you about this work, and I can share with you my opinions concerning it, but no more. You'll find no sweeping statements here, no fiery words or grand generalizations. Instead, you'll merely uncover one man's thoughts, so take them for what they're worth(which isn't darn much.)\n\nThis Symphony Number Nine is divided into four movements: (1) Allegro ma non troppo, un poco maestoso, (2) Molto vivace, (3) Adagio molto e cantabile, and (4)Finale - Presto. I personally divide the symphony into two smaller parts. The first section encompasses the first three movements: this is the Build-Up. The last section consists of the Finale, which I call the Climax. If I had to name one bad thing about this symphony, I would mention some small portions of this Build-Up. These sections seem to me to be positively superflous, and not even particularly good music if they were forced to stand on their own merits away from the rest of the symphony. However, this IS a symphony, and all the movements ultimately do blend together to form a harmonious and powerful whole. Besides, the first three movements for the most part are excellent - it's merely a few dull digressive interludes I could do without. Ultimately, though, it is not the quiet, intense fire of the first movement that make this one of most well-known pieces of music on the planet Earth. Nor is it the cheerful aural loveliness of the second(which is probably the best movement of the four musically). Or even the slow, melancholy third. No - let's not fool ourselves. This symphony is famous for the Climax as I call it, otherwise known as the finale. This is where the huge choir and lead vocalists(following the instrumental section, of course) begin singing the words of Schiller's famous poem \"Ode(or Hymn) To Joy\", and the bombastic orchestra backs 'em up all the way. This is how Beethoven wanted to complete his piece, and I honestly can't think of any better closer. After touching multiple moods in the first three movements, Beethoven shows us his main ideal: that humanity is good, that life is worth living, that there is joy and happiness to be found for every bit of sorrow and pain on this planet Earth. Of course, you and I know that's all bosh, but fairy tales are fun ain't they? It helps that Beethoven somehow managed to come up with the greatest melody in history for the tune, too. Not just a melody, but THE Melody! Forget all those happy Beatles albums for just one moment. This is remarkable! Of course, classical critics ultimately slag this final movement as too repititious, and too reliant on the simplistic theme, but its popularity bespeaks otherwise. I'd rather hear this than the meandering third movement or inconsistent first any day. A moment for me - a moment for Ludwig - a moment for German culture as a whole. Yee-haw! I guess it does drag on a little long...but it's worth it!\n\nThough this story has been repeated ad inifinitum, it's worth mentioning again. At the time he was composing this piece of music, Beethoven was going completely deaf. At the time this piece of music was first performed in concert, Beethoven could not even hear his masterpiece being played in front of him, at least not with his ears. It's amazing that one of the great pieces of classical music of all time could've been composed by a deaf man. Music only serves a purpose to those who have ears and can hear, doesn't it? How then can a man who has, as it were, \"lost\" his ears still retain his understanding of music? Oh, there are many things we do not understand about the world we live in, my friend. And that is that.\n\nI'm only allowing myself to criticize this work lightly with my rating. I would feel almost comfortable giving this work a 10, in its glory and its perfection, but almost comfortable isn't quite good enough for me. Structurally, this symphony is perfect. But taken in a single sitting, some parts of the work do become tedious to the listener. And I can't tolerate boredom along with my entertaiment - can you? So, I'm going to give this a grand rating of '8' - I hope my review above has shown you that is an unusually powerful '8' rated musical piece. And it is essential!\n\n8 stars(out of 10)\n\nGold and Platinum by Lynyrd Skynyrd(1979)\n\nOnce upon a time, Lynyrd Skynyrd was my very favorite band. I still enjoy their music a great deal. They merged two wonderful kinds of music: good ol' Southern honky tonk and '70s blues-based rock and roll. They combined this all with a fine(though often unnoticed) sense of humor. And Lynyrd Skynyrd are the kings of Southern rock. Their only real competition for that title is that other fine Southern jam band, the Allman Brothers. Skynyrd wins out for better vocals and because they rarely overdid their guitar jams.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. Down South Jukin'\n\n2. Saturday Night Special\n\n3. Gimme Three Steps\n\n4. What's Your Name?\n\n5. You Got That Right\n\n6. Gimme Back My Bullets\n\n7. Sweet Home Alabama\n\n8. Free Bird\n\n9. That Smell\n\n10. On The Hunt\n\n11. I Ain't The One\n\n12. Whiskey Rock-A-Roller\n\n13. Simple Man\n\n14. I Know A Little\n\n15. Tuesday's Gone\n\n16. Comin' Home\n\nMy mind keeps changing about the music of Lynyrd Skynyrd. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. I can't honestly write a Skynyrd review without mentioning the nay sayers. Yes, my friends, Lynyrd Skynyrd has been blacklisted in \"trendy\" rock circles for years, for no good reason. Now shoitenly, there are things that are not to like about Lynyrd Skynyrd, but the same goes for every band that ever existed. Now, sure, most of the nay sayers ain't Skynyrd listeners aside from what they hear on the radio, but I find the comparison between LS and many other 70s rockers(like the flagship of 70s rock, Bad Company) inaccurate. To a certain extent, you could argue that most 70s rockers had gone too far away from the original rock'n'roll credo of speed. The new standard for a rock song became (1.) find a good guitar riff or two, (2.) repeat those riffs slow and painfully over the course of 4-5 minutes. It made for some great songs, but only for a while. Eventually, you're going to realize that aside from the title track, Bad Company isn't a record you're gonna want to hear every day. LS was a slightly different variety of band, however. Now sure, they did create some bloated F.M. slow-rock(like \"Free Bird\", maybe?), but there's much more to Skynyrd. Piano boogie, creative guitar work, lazy vocals courtesy of Ronnie Van Zant that can be surprisingly effective. I'd almost put him on my list of favorite singers of all time, but that lazy Southern singin' style...so cool, but so put-offish at the same time. Ultimately, I reckon I'll always like Skynyrd, despite being poisoned against 'em by trendy alt rock critics.\n\nI originally gave this compilation an '8', then raised it to '9'. Now I'm lowering it again to '8' because I just don't listen to it all that often.\n\nHere's my original amateurish paragraph where I analyze this collection track by track: \"Down South Jukin'\" is an incredible song that never gets played on radio. It's my favorite song on this album, de facto. However, it is mispelled on the flap \"Down South Junkin'.\" Maybe somebody needs to be fired. Unfortunately, DSJ is followed by \"Saturday Night Special\", which features Skynyrd attempting to do a darker song, something which they would continue to attempt throughout their career. This ditty, though not one of my favorites musically, surely disproves the idea of Skynyrd just being a gang of rednecks. How many rednecks do you hear penning anti-handgun songs? \"Gimme Three Steps\" happens to be the greatest song ever made, but this live version doesn't quite do the studio version justice. Still pretty good, though. \"What's Your Name\" is real good honky tonkin'! Real good! \"You Got That Right\" is a beautiful followup. \"Gimme Back My Bullets\" is everything \"Saturday Night Special\" wishes it could be. \"Sweet Home Alabama\" is everything \"Gimme Back My Bullets\" wishes it could be. I mean, let's face it. If we were songs, we'd prolly pretty much suck. We would love to be \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" It IS classic rock. If there's a classic rock station in this country or the Netherlands which doesn't play this song, it's crap! After Sweet Home, we get the live version of \"Free Bird\", thank you very much. I'm not that crazy about the bird, actually. It's a sweet little song and all, but the boys have done better. Flip over your record or change your cassette and you can listen to side 2! It starts off strong with that great jammer \"That Smell\". It may be the best of the Skyn radio tunes, since some of the best guitarwork in all Skynyrdville can be found therein. Incidentally, the tune is about Ronnie Van Zant's own excesses. \"On The Hunt\" is just funky fun. \"I Ain't the One\" ain't all that impressive, but you're not a beauty, but hey you're all right! I used but twice in that sentence, and quoted Springsteen in the process. Why don't you shoot me? \"Whiskey Rock-A-Roller\" is a fine ditty but it should be much better all the same with a sort of nice mellow bass solo. \"Simple Man\", on the other hand, is one of the real hidden classics on this side. What a piece of rock and roll musicianship! Tis beauty, my friends. Never gets on the radio, neither! \"I Know A Little\" is plain ol' fun honkytonk. \"Tuesday's Gone\" sounds a bit countryish to my ears, but it's just alright, too. Tuesday's goooone with the wiiinddd. Melody, melody, that was her second name. \"Comin' Home\" is a pretty good jam! All in all, this is a fine album. This isn't a bad way to get introduced to Skynyrd; pretty good selection. By the way, in case you were wondering, Lynyrd Skynyrd does still exist today, sort of. Most of the original members of the band died in a tragic plane crash. The current band can't compare with the original, but, hey it's ok. I'll be reviewing their album \"Twenty\" before too long.\n\nThen again, maybe I won't. Honestly, I don't know why I was so dern excited to review Gold and Platinum. I made a jackass out of myself with my stupid descriptions of every song! Let this review be a lesson to you: nobody's born to write good reviews :).\n\n8 stars (out of 10)\n\nThe Immaculate Collection by Madonna(1990)\n\nWell, I tried to be a displomatic as possible in my original review of this record. However, my computer decided to freeze at an inopportune moment, causing my unsaved almost finished review to disappear into the vast virtual ether. So now I'm really mad. I'm just going to rewrite these reviews as straightforwardly as possible. No beating around the bush. Feel free to leave me hatemail. Track listing:\n\n1. Holiday\n\n2. Lucky Star\n\n3. Borderline\n\n4. Like a Virgin\n\n5. Material Girl\n\n6. Crazy For You\n\n7. Into the Groove\n\n8. Live To Tell\n\n9. Papa Don't Preach\n\n10. Open Your Heart\n\n11. La Isla Bonita\n\n12. Like A Prayer\n\n13. Express Yourself\n\n14. Cherish\n\n16. Justify My Love\n\n17. Rescue Me\n\nI hate the music of Madonna. Her records are artificial, sterile, boring, banal, repulsive, and stagnant. Her vocal style typifies the awfulness of white female pop singers. Her \"music\" doesn't even sound like music...so damned fake! Her \"people\" use keyboards, synthesizers, electronic drums, and occasionally bass to create utterly boring girly noise. Sure, occasionally this boring girly noise wasn't so horrible. In fact, the first three songs on this compilation featuring the early Madonna are just mediocre pop songs...they're almost catchy, but that almost is the killer, isn't it? I guess \"Material Girl\" is in that almost catchy level, too, but \"Beat It\" was a better song. However, the rest of these songs(and every other Madonna song I've ever heard) have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It's nice that there's a Spanish guitar on \"La Isla Bonita\", but it ends up sounding like elevator muzak.\n\nI don't quite understand why Madonna is still so loved and respected now that she's an old woman. She's still able to come out with a double platinum album(Ray of Light) on the force of the 80s oldies movement. Is she still relevent amidst the sea of boring electronica dance groups of the late 90s? Can she continue to change with the times as the sounds continue to evolve? Probably. Electronica and all its knockoffs are just as plastic, dull, soulless, banal, repetetive, and stagnant as the 80s Madonna's version of pop music. Bleck. Is this the logical progression of music over the ages? Chopin, Armstrong, John Lee Hooker, Bachman Turner Overdrive, Madonna, Radiohead, Portishead...? If I had to listen to Madonna every day, I'd probably end up loving hardcore. At least that's some exciting tuneless noise. Anything but this monotony! My brain cells are dying! They're dying! Killed off by Madonna! Oh no!\n\n1 star(out of 10)\n\nMetallica by Metallica(1991)\n\nMetal becomes mainstream? Heaven forbid. But yes, Metallica is mainstream metal, now anyway. When I think about it, the music I like(classic rock, blues, even a little jazz mixed in) seems to be as much of an alternative form of music as alt rock or metal; at least among the top 40 buyers of today. Oh yeah, to this album....track listing please? Sure:\n\n1. Enter Sandman\n\n2. Sad But True\n\n3. Holier Than Thou\n\n4. The Unforgiven\n\n5. Wherever I May Roam\n\n6. Don't Tread On Me\n\n7. Through The Never\n\n8. Nothing Else Matters\n\n9. Of Wolf And Man\n\n10. The God That Failed\n\n11. My Friend of Misery\n\n12. The Struggle Within\n\nWow. \"Enter Sandman\" is one helluva album opener. As a matter of fact, that first side is quite excellent. \"Enter Sandman\" and \"Holier Than Thou\" being the standouts in my opinion. When the time came for me to change this baby you probably know as The Black Album over, I was thinking to myself, \"Wow. This might be an 8.\" But no. Side 2 pretty much sucks. Apparently, I'm the only person who doesn't go crazy over \"Nothing Else Matters.\" So Metallica can do a decent slower song! Good for them! No, my friends, the song that saves side 2 is \"Of Wolf and Man.\" Though it starts out quite questionably sounding like filler, the guitar solo is the best on the album. On first listen, I gave this album a 6. Now it has earned its 7, but I can't see me giving it a higher rating than that. Too much filler. Here's my old ending paragraph:\n\nAt the end of the day, this album is essential 90s metal. But the genre's best(and this group's best) were pre-90s. Still, a pretty good album but it's not surprising MTV would pick this one to go crazy over, either.\n\n7 stars (out of 10)\n\nRuslan and Lyudmila by Mikhail Glinka(1842)\n\nMikhail Ivanovich Glinka is widely considered the father of Russian classical music. His dream was to create a uniquely Russian type of music by combining the folk music of the peasants, the Asiatic influences brought in by the Tatars, and the Western European classical music which enfused St. Petersburg. This is his second opera; his first, A Life for the Tsar is his most famous, but I haven't heard it yet. When I first planned to review this piece for my site several months ago, I had a very different opinion of it than I do now. I considered it a charming, romantic piece that was decidedly \"lightweight.\" Now, however, I simply think it's wonderful.. Certainly charming and romantic, but also very warm-hearted, non-pretentious, innovative, and fascinating. Listening to this piece really makes me hungry to listen to more Russian classical. I'm familiar with a fair bit of Rachmaninoff(whom I dislike very much), and of course Tchaikovsky(whose Violin Concerto in D is my favorite classical piece of all time. It is a pity that a lot of his other opuses are horribly dull.), but beyond that I know only a few names. The type of music Glinka created in Russia became known as the \"Nationalistic\" school, and its later members included the likes of Mussorgsky and Cui. I actually haven't heard either(ELP's Pictures at an Exhibition doesn't really count, does it?), but for what I've read it seems that most post-Glinka proponents of the nationalistic school failed to be as progressive and innovative as Mikhail. Instead of striving to perform the common music of a united country, they instead turned almost completely to the folk music of the peasants. Since I haven't really heard anything beyond Glinka, I can't really say - I certainly will check out these other nationalistic composers some day.\n\nI think it is one of the greatest pleasures for a listener to be able to hear music performed or composed by someone who really understands music, on a spiritual as well as an intellectual level. Glinka certainly seems to have had a deep understanding of a remarkable number of instruments. I'm really, really impressed how well the horns, strings, and woodwinds sound together. It's as if Glinka played each instrument himself, and understood all of their individual nuances. The musical progressions go by almost effortlessly...the whole opera flows on like a river. The music itself is lovely, gripping, intense, and infinitely sly. Now...have I any complaints? Well...nothing too serious, but I will say that portions of the opera are quite simplistic. It's certainly not as complex as a symphony of Bach's or Beethoven's. It is infinitely more personable and human, however. I feel quite comfortable giving it the same 8 I gave Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Obviously, the two pieces earned their 8s for different reasons, but they're both excellent music. Perhaps someday I'll award both a 10 proudly, but for now, I'll just say that they're both better than Suicidal Tendencies. Then again, maybe I just need to lower my standards and change my rating criteria. Who knows?\n\n8 stars(out of 10)\n\nGlinka Links\n\nThe Russian Neo-Romantic Trumpet Concerto (By Joseph P. Gudorf)\n\nKind of Blue by Miles Davis(1959)\n\nThis is one of the few records that has gotten mass praise from crritics and fans and actually deserves it. I won't say anything like \"this is the best album ever made\" or \"this is the best jazz album ever made.\" Maybe it is. I don't know. I've listened to a lot of albums, and I certainly have my favorites among them, but it's difficult for me to rate them numerically. All I can say is that this record is an amazing one, and there is no excuse for not owning it. Track listing:\n\n1. So What\n\n2. Freddie Freeloader\n\n3. Blue In Green\n\n4. All Blues\n\n5. Flamenco Sketches\n\n6. Flamenco Sketches(alt. take)\n\nThere isn't much I can say about this album that hasn't been said already, but I'll try just the same. This album, forgetting for a moment its musical value in itself, is a vitally important footnote in the history of modern jazz. Miles had this great idea. Simplify bop. Make every note off every instrument count, but keep it as exciting as the best hard bop. The results of that idea are truly amazing. It might not have worked, but Miles Davis had one of the best groups in jazz ever assembled working with him. Himself, one of the best trumpet players ever. Bill Evans, a pianist who can sound like both Chopin and W.C. Handey; his versatility and poetic sense helps give the album direction. On tenor saxophone, John Coltrane, one of the best jazz musicians that there ever was. He does some absolutely amazing things throughout...this might even be the best recording featuring his playing, and that's saying a lot. Paul Chambers on bass, James Cobb on drums, Cannonball Aldershot on alto saxophone. With such a grouping, you'd almost have to create good music. And they do. Boy, do they ever.\n\nThe opening to this album is one of the most famous in history. The piano sets things up, then that distinctive bass line crops up, there's a crash of drums, the horns taking over... Awesome. You know, I'm listening to this album while writing this review, and I've got to say again how blown away I am by Coltrane's playing. It's stunning. Coltrane can do that sometimes...he can make you forget that there is any such thing as jazz aside from him. Huge. On this album, he's not the searcher. He's the king.\n\nEven non-jazz fans should own this one. It's one of the best albums ever made, truly. It belongs in your collection right there with Beethoven's 9th and the Stones Exile on Mainstreet. Even up there with the Beatles Sgt. Pepper(which sucks, more or less, anyway). If you aren't impressed with what you hear here, you've probably killed too many brain cells listening to metal or hardcore to be able to listen and enjoy something outside the circle of your musical experience.\n\n10 stars(out of 10)\n\nThe Candy Man by Mississippi John Hurt(date unknown, published by Quicksilver Records)\n\nWhen I think of Mississippi John Hurt, two particular images come to mind. One is of the old, wizened man, whose years of toil are shown in the wrinkles of his dark skinned face. He plays across the country to enthusiastic crowds of folk music fans. He is often ill with various ailments; perhaps occasionally during a concert he would pine for the Mississippi he knew and loved so well, longing to feel the Mississippi mud in his hands and to bask in the warm and loving Mississippi"
