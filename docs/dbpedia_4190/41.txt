Pictured with Skip James on yesterday's Skip James post, his friend and contemporary Hurt was a blues country singer-songwriter known for his distinctively intricate fingerpicking style. John Smith Hurt's main occupation was sharecropper and farmer in his native Avalon, Mississippi, taught himself to play aged nine, and never became a full-time professional musician, despite some recordings in 1928 for Okeh Records, a label which, like others, fell into demise with the Great Depression. Still, Hurt's reputation gradually simmered on, and was regarded as another great who influenced many others, finally also swept up in the 1960s revival with several notable appearances in this twilight years. This song has been covered by many others including Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie, but as well as this number Hurt can also be heard playing as a guest on on a 1964 radio show alongside Skip James.
