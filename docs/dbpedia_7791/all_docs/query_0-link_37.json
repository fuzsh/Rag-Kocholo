        "text": "FATIH SULTAN MEHMED (Born) 1429 - (Deceased) 1481 CE\n\nMEHMED II, THE CONQUEROR (FATIH) Reigned from 1444 to 1446 until his father took over on account of war. He came again to throne in 1451. He conquered Constantinople in 1453. The oppressed Jews were relieved to see him occupy the city. He allowed Jews from today's Greek Islands and Crete to settle in Istanbul. Fatih's declaration is as follows: \"Listen sons of the Hebrew who live in my country...May all of you who desire come to Constantinople and may the rest of your people find here a shelter\". The Bavarian King Ludwig the III, under the influence of the Italian Monk Jean de Capistrano expelled the Jews out and forced them to settle on the banks of the Danube River, Capistrano helped John Hunyadi in 1456 when the Ottomans besieged Belgrade. In 1410 Jean Huss was excommunicated and burned on order of the pope Alexander the V. The pope Nicholas the V, summoned Jean de Capistrano to go to Slovakia and fight the followers of Jean Huss. Of course Capistrano did not forget the Jews and as a result, by order of the Sultan, a regiment called \"The sons of Moses\" was formed. Since Capistrano also prepared a crusade against the Ottomans, the same regiment participated in the war which ensued. The doctors Isak Pasa Galeon and Ribbi Sonsino were also appointed to that regiment. Before being killed, Ribbi Sonsino chopped away the head of Jean de Capistrano and the church declared the latter a saint. After the war Mehmed II (Fatih) invited the Ashkenazi Jews of Transylvania and Slovakia to the Ottoman Empire. The synagogues Ahrida, Karaferya, Yanbol and Cuhadji which were damaged due to a fire have been repaired on Fatih's order. According to a votive foundation document dated 1451-1481, the doctors Moses Hamon, Isak Pas a Galeon, Hekim Yakup, Ephraim Sandji and Hekim Abraham were appointed as palace doctors.\n\nSULTAN II BAYEZID (Born) 1447 - (Deceased) 1512 CE\n\nDuring the years 1490 to 1497Sultan Bayezid II accepted the exiled Jews from Italy, Spain and Portugal. In 1492 Kemal Reis and his fleet were sent to Cadiz to take the Jews in charge. During the reign of Bayezid II, the king and queen of Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, signed an edict of expulsion for the Jews. The edict was issued under the pressure of the church on the 31st of March 1492 and the Jews had to leave the country until the 2nd of August 1492. The last lot of Jews gathered in the port of Cadiz faced a dilemma: Those who left port were attacked by the pirates, those who went on land were burned at the stake by the inquisition. About a thousand people waited in anguish. At the last minute arrived a small fleet manned by the Turkish admiral Kemal Reis who took the refugees under his protection. Thus organizing a convoy of Jewish immigrants towards the Ottoman empire. Of the approximately 600,000 Spanish Jews, half were baptized, 100,000 went to Portugal, some went to the Netherlands, Italy, North Africa and the New World. But, the biggest lot reached the Ottoman Empire, numbering about 150,000 people. When the Jews who went to Portugal were exiled too in 1497, a big majority of them found refuge in the Ottoman Empire. Whereas the migration of forcibly converted Jews to Ottoman lands lasted several decades. In 1501 he accepted the Jews who fled from France. At a later period, the Jews of Spanish and Portuguese origin who went to Brazil were tracked by the inquisition who persecuted and compelled them to emigrate to New Amsterdam, today's New York. The immigrants met in the Ottoman Empire about 50,000 Romaniot, Karaite and Ashkenazi Jews. The Jews which may have entered Anatolia following the collapse of the Khazars; those who may have followed Alp Arslan after his entry to Anatolia and the communities which existed in the south-east since ancient times are not part of the estimated figures.\n\nYAVUZ SULTAN SELIM (Born) 1470 - (Deceased) 1520 CE\n\nBy conquering Egypt, he had put an end to the \"Law of no return\" issued by the Roman Senate in the year 60 AD. The expulsion process was completed in the year 120. Meaning it took 60 years from Titus to Hadrian. Jews could travel freely for 400 years until the British conquered Palestine in 1917 and restricted again the entry of Jews into Palestine. The \"Law of no return\" comprised an order of throwing overboard all Jews found on a ship sailing for the Holy Land. The reason for the law of expulsion, was that the Jews were undermining the \"Pax Romana\" as they were in constant rebellion. The Roman emperors considering themselves gods, wanted to establish their statues in the Temple and the Jews fought them. All occupiers of the land of Israel applied the law of no return. Meaning the Romans, the Byzantines, the Mameluks, the Arabs who came from the south, the crusaders, and the British in 1917. It is unfortunate to say that this caused the death of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. At that time the palace doctors were Joseph Hamon and his son Moses Hamon, Joseph Hamon was killed during the conquest of Palestine in 1516. Sultan Selim had borrowed money from a Jewish banker for his Egyptian campaign, but the banker passed away before payment was due and his minister of finance reported the death to the Sultan adding that there was no need for payment. The Sultan wrote the following phrase under the report: \"May the dead rest in peace, his orphans live in good health, his belongings prosper and curse upon the intriguer.\" Yavuz Sultan Selim who abrogated the Roman edict of no return has to be honored as the Sultan who paved the way for today's Israel.\n\nKANUNI SULTAN SULEYMAN (Born) 1495 - (Deceased) 1566 CE\n\n(SOLIMAN THE MAGNIFICENT) Built the city walls of Jerusalem and ordered the settling of thousands of Jews on the shores of Lake Kinnereth in Tiberias and the north of Jerusalem. His reign is marked as the most powerful and prosperous period of the Ottomans. During the reign of Soliman The Magnificent, Dona Gracia and Joseph Nassi, came to Turkey. Thanks to his connections and agents in Europe, Nassi was appointed as political advisor to the Sultan. The pope Paul IV, wanted to hand over the Jews of Ancona to the inquisition but the timely opposition of the Sultan saved the Jews. Moses Hamon, Avram Levi Migas, Tam Ben david Yahya and his sons Gedalya Yahya and Joseph Yahya, Yehuda de Kugers, Moiz Butaril and doctor Menashe, served as palace physicians. During the war against Iran Gedalya Yahya, and during the war for the conquest of the island of Rhodes, Dr. Menashe was killed.\n\nSULTAN MURAD IV (Born) 1612 - (Deceased) 1640 CE\n\nSultan Murad is known for prohibiting to the people what he daily did. During his reign the Jewish community with great timidity tried to get out of its shell. We see again doctors in palace service as Moiz Amaradji and Yakup Abbasoglu Musa. Some historians say that Rabbi Yehuda Kovo from Salonica came to Constantinople to pay taxes and that he was executed. The story of Rabbi Kovo is quite different: At that time, the fabric for uniforms of the army was manufactured by the weavers of Salonica who worked at home and sold to the army great quantities of fabric. The army refused the fabrics that were below standards. All of Salonica's Jews faced the danger of bankruptcy. That is how Rabbi Kovo was involved just to help the people and he was accused of delivering faulty material to the army. That caused his execution. Due to the crisis that broke, good many families from Salonica moved to Izmir which at that time had a small Jewish community.\n\nSULTAN MEHMED IV (Born) 1641 - (Deceased) 1693 CE\n\nDuring the reign of Sultan Mehmed IV, on the demand of King Charles August of Sweden a treaty is signed against Russia and Moses Beberi is appointed ambassador to Sweden, after his death in 1674 his son Yehuda is appointed ambassador. In 1648-1658 two major events occured: The first one is a revolution in Poland. A petty aristocrat by the name of Bogdan Chmielnitzki kills the land owners, the priest and the Jews. 300 communities disappear 150,000 jews are killed, money is gathered all over Europe and a slave market starts in Crimea. Jews are exported like cattle. With the acceptance of Mehmet IV, Jews are settled on the banks of the Danube in Morea, Kavala, Istanbul and Salonica. The second event happens in 1666. Rabbi Sabetay Sevi declares himself messiah and causes turmoil. The sultan calls him to the palace, his head is in danger. Doctor Abravanel (Hayati Zade) asks for his pardon. Sabetay Sevi changes his name to Mehmet Efendi, he is now a Moslem. From Warsaw to Cairo thousands follow his example.\n\nSULTAN MAHMUD I (Born) 1696 - (Deceased) 1754 CE\n\nUnder the reign of Mahmut I, the tteaty of Belgtade was signed (September 18th, 1739). This gave rights to the Ottoman Jews. Their situation was so good that Austrian Jews applied for Ottoman citizenship. Under the influence of the church, Marie Therese did her best to pressure the Jews. Finally the Jews asked the palace banker Yehuda Baruh to explain the situation to the Sultan. The Sultan gave an ultimatum saying that he was taking back his subjects to Turkey and the Austria should do likewise. The queen said that there was a misunderstanding and the case was closed. The doctors Isaac Tchelebi and hekim Joseph were appointed at the palace.\n\nSULTAN MAHMUD II (Born) 1785 - (Deceased) 1839 CE\n\nDuring the reign of Sultan Mahmud two bad situations occurred: The Greek Patriarch who was too close to a Greek organization working against Turkey was condemned to death, and the prime minister Benderli Ali Pasa personally assisted to the execution which took place at the gate of the Patriarchate. Among the onlookers three Jews were spotted and ordered by Benderli Ali Pasa to drag the body and throw it to the sea. When the news reached Athens, the rumour was that the Jews had murdered Gregorius. As a result, 5000 Jews were murdered in Morea and all the Jewish passengers of a Greek ship were thrown overboard. As for the second catastrophe, Mahmud II, having suppressed the janissaries at the same period and the disgrace of the protector of the Jewish bankers Halet Efendi, on the one hand; the fact that the bankers had given money (through pressure) to the janissaries and due to the denunciation to the Sultan by their competitor the Armenian banker Artin Kazaz, the Jewish banker Izak Adjiman, Tchelebi Bohor Carmoma and Yehezekiel Gabay were executed. During the reign of Mahmut II Doctor Uziel and Doctor Admiral Elias Pasha Cohen were of service at the palace.\n\nSULTAN ABDULAZIZ (Born) 1830 - (Deceased) 1876 CE\n\nWith his firman dated April 5th, 1870, the Sultan Abdul Aziz allocated the \"Alliance Israelite Universelle\" 2600 dunams of land east of Jaffa for the establishment of a school of agriculture and also granted permission for importing all kinds of tools and machinery free of taxes and customs. As Ben Gouriion, said: \"I doubt that the Israeli dream would have been realized if the farm school of Mikveh Israel had not existed.\" Among Jews that served during the reign of Sultan Aziz: The palace intendent Baruh Cohen, Dr. Mordohay Levi in different cities. In the army admiral Dr. Isaac Pasha Molho, Fr. Menetes Pasa Galimidi, Dr. Isaac Pasa Galimidi and admiral Elias Pasa Cohen. Upon recurrence of blood libel accusations, Sultan Aziz issued the attached firman dated July 11th, 1866 taking the Jews under his protection. Thanks to this firman the Greek Orthodox patriarchate had to issue encyclicals to all churches, forbidding such practices.\n\nSULTAN ABDULHAMID II (Born) 1842 - (Deceased) 1918 CE\n\nFollowing Ottoman territorial losses in the Balkans owing to the Turco-Russian war and the ensuing Berlin Treaty, mass immigration of Turks and Jews starts towards Turkey. The Jews prepare festivities for the 400th anniversary of their arrival from Spain. Abdulhamid is making plans for installing 200,000 Jewish immigrants from Russia in the south east, but this remains as a project. The Jews are out of their shell. In the 1887 parliament we see Jewish parliament member. Abraham Adjiman, Menahem Salah Pasa, Ziver, Davitchon Levi and David Karmona. In the 1908 parliament Vitali Faradji Alberta Fua, Emmanuel Carasso, Nisim Mazliyah, Yehezkel Sasson and at the senate Bohor Eskenazi. After the Alfred Dreyfus case, the arrival of the Hungarian born Theodor Herzl from the leading Viennese newspaper \"Neue Freie Presse\" to Istanbul takes place. He comes first in 1898 then in 1901 and a third time in 1902 and tries to obtain an audience with the Sultan Abdulhamid. It is on his third voyage that he is finally gtanted one through the head Rabbi Moshe Levy. The Sultan receives him, and through the conversation Herzl tries to obtain a Jewish homeland under the protection of the Sultan and under the same statutes as the Island of Crete.\n\nSULTAN MEHMED RESAD (Born) 1844 - (Deceased) 1918 CE\n\nSultan Mehmed Resad's reign is marked by the Balkan war in 1912, the first world war 1914-1918 and the collapse of what remained of a world empire. The only gain was the return to Turkey of the Kars and Ardahan provinces. In foreign affairs, 3 consul generals, 10 consuls, a court interpreter, 2 ministerial advisers, 1 consulate inspector and some embassy secretaries are members of the Jewish community. Government paid doctors in the provinces, and at the Dardanelles the head doctor of the Red Crescent hospital colonel Behor Kamhi, serving in different places, navy major palace dentist Sami Gunsberg, Dr. David Hayon, Colonel Menahem Bey Hodara, Colonel Rafael Bey, Dalmedico, Lt. Colonel Isaac Ojalvo, Lt. Colonel Alfandari, Major Adjubel, Major Nissim Maden, Major Yerushalmi, Avram Bey Matalon, Captain Bensussen and many others of which we can count the fallen at the front in 1914-1918: Major Isaac Adjubel, Captain Albert Cohen, Captin Izidor Shalom, Captain Zavarro, Captain Albert Menashe, Captain Pepo Akshiote, Captain Siyaves, Captain Albagli, Captain Asa, Captain David Feder and Captain Pharmacist Behor Alfandar.\n\nSULTAN MEHMED VAHDEDDIN (Born) 1861 - (Deceased) 1926 CE\n\nThe impossible task of assembling the pieces of the Empire and the remainder of the Ottoman people was the lot of Sultan Mehmed Vahdeddin. As a result the war of independence and the declaration of the republic. Among those who continued to serve: The minister of telegraph Yusuf Franko Pasa. During the armistice in parliament Mishon Ventura, Colonel Professor Samuel Abrevaya and Professor Avram Galante as translator of the foreign press news for the Ankara government. Among the doctors who joined the libetation forces Captain Hazmonay Bensusen and from page 135 of our book \"Turkish Jews\" the picture of Jewish orphans of the fallen during the war of independence is self explanatory."
