        "text": "Unit 3: Land-Based Empires\n\nC. 1450 - 1750\n\nTopic 3 Empires Expand\n\nLearning Objective\n\nExplain how and why various land-based empires developed and expanded from 1450 to 1750.\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nImperial expansion relied on the increased use of gunpowder, cannons, and armed trade to establish large empires in both hemispheres.\n\nLand empires included the Manchu in Central and East Asia; the Mughal in South and Central Asia; the Ottoman in Southern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa; and the Safavids in the Middle East.\n\nPolitical and religious disputes led to rivalries and conflict between states.\n\nState rivalries: ● Safavid3Mughal conflict ● Songhai Empire’s conflict with Morocco\n\n1. Explain how the land-based empires of the 1450-1750 time period\n\ndeveloped (what allowed them to obtain and maintain power):\n\nThe land-based empires of the 1450-1750 time period developed by them\n\nconquering lands in other countries and making palaces that reflects their\n\npower. They also made their own people to live with them so they cannot work\n\nagainst them.\n\n2. Describe the Qing Dynasty (use SPICE-T characteristics):\n\nS- possess pyramid emperor, gentry, agriculturalist, landlords, and peasants.\n\nP- They often like ocean trade, Indian ocean trade.\n\nI- Indian ocean spreads across their land and reduces the expansion of China.\n\nC- There was religious tolerance, indian ocean trade.\n\nE- They are the gunpowder empire.\n\nT-Has gunpowder weapons in the empire.\n\n3. Describe the Mughal Empire (use SPICE-T characteristics):\n\nS-They have a pyramid of different levels and also have rich, middle class and\n\npoor people.\n\nP-They are known to have religious reform.\n\nI- They conquered lands.\n\nC- Islamic religion as well as few christians.\n\nE- Fragmentation.\n\nT-They have gunpowder weapons.\n\n4. Describe the Ottoman Empire (use SPICE-T characteristics):\n\nS- There were mixed marriages peasants paying most taxes.\n\nP-They also had tax collectors, sultans, and also Janissaries.\n\nI- They conquered Constantinople.\n\nC- They were also peasant revolts.\n\nE- They are also the gunpowder empire.\n\nT- They also had gunpowder weapons.\n\n5. Describe the Safavid Empire (use SPICE-T characteristics)\n\nS- They are very religious.\n\nP-They expand empires and reorganize military.\n\nI- They engaged in costly wars.\n\nC- They also spent a lot of time in prayers.\n\nE- Known to have costly wars, bad leadership and possess gunpowder.\n\nT- They have gunpowder weapons\n\nTopic 3 Empires: Administration\n\nLearning Objective\n\nExplain how rulers used a variety of methods to legitimize and consolidate their power in land-based empires from 1450 to 1750.\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nRecruitment and use of bureaucratic elites , as well as the development of military professionals, became more common among rulers who wanted to maintain centralized control over their populations and resources\n\nBureaucratic elites or military professionals: ● Ottoman devshirme ● Salaried samurai\n\nRulers continued to use religious ideas, art, and monumental architecture to legitimize their rule.\n\nReligious ideas: ● Mexica practice of human sacrifice ● European notions of divine right ● Songhai promotion of Islam\n\nArt and monumental architecture: ● Qing imperial portraits ● Incan sun temple of Cuzco ● Mughal mausolea and mosques ● European palaces, such as Versailles\n\nRulers used tribute collection , tax farming , and innovative tax-collection systems to generate revenue in order to forward state power and expansion.\n\nTax-collection systems: ● Mughal zamindar tax\n\n6. Describe how land-based empires utilized military professionals to\n\nmaintain power:\n\nThe Ottoman Sultans employed a system known as Devshirme, which was essentially\n\na system in which they abducted enslaved individuals from the tribute nations of their\n\nempire and, once obtained, forced them to serve in the military or make them\n\nadministrators of the Empire. Muslims abducted slaves from the Christian inhabitants\n\nof Southern Europe and the Balkans, generally from the ages of 8 to 20, because they\n\nwere unable to enslave Muslims. They had advanced schooling. The enslaved youths\n\nwho made up the Janissaries were groomed to be an elite unit in the Ottoman army,\n\nand they developed a strong loyalty to the Sultan.\n\n7. Explain how land-based empires utilized religious art and ideas to\n\nmaintain power:\n\nLand-based empires included theological concepts like the doctrine of the divine\n\nright of kings, as was the case in England under King James I. James firmly believed\n\nthat the reason kings governed was because god himself had placed them in that\n\nposition. This was a wise move because if the populace and the monarch accepted\n\nthe doctrine of the Divine Rights of Kings, they would be challenging the existence of\n\nGod, which was something that no Christian wanted to undertake. These theological\n\nconcepts were shown in works of art where monarchs in thrones are given the\n\nauthority of kingship by a hand from above the sky, which is thought to be God.\n\n8. Explain how land-based empires utilized monumental architecture to\n\nmaintain power:\n\nThe Palace of Versailles was constructed by Louis the 13th as a means of hiding his\n\ntyranny. Once this palace was finished, Louis issued a proclamation mandating that\n\nthe French Nobles move there and made it exceedingly difficult for them to disagree.\n\nIn Japan, Tokugawa Ieyasu followed Louis the 13th's example and mandated that the\n\ndaimyo maintain two residences4one in their home territory and the other in Tokyo,\n\nA disagreement about who should succeed the current Islamic leader was the cause\n\nof the division. Sunnis thought Abu Bakr, the prophet's close friend, should be the new\n\nsuccessor, while Shi'a thought Ali, the prophet's son-in-law, should.\n\n14. Why did this split intensify during the 1450-1750 time period?\n\nPolitical rivalries between the Ottoman and Safavid empires intensify the split between\n\nSunni and Shi'a.\n\n15. Explain how Sikhism developed in relation to the Mughal Empire.\n\nIn India, the Mughal Empire rose to power, and the Mughals had a significant\n\ninfluence on the growth of Sikhism. Emperor Akbar tolerated the Sikhs in 1567. They\n\nwere viewed as a danger by a Mughal emperor, which led the Sikhs to militarize in\n\norder to defend their religion.\n\nLand-Based Empires of 1450-\n\nImage via Freemanpedia.\n\nUnit 3: Land-Based Empires (1450-1750) Context Practice\n\nInstructions: Write a contextual statement for each of the prompts below.
