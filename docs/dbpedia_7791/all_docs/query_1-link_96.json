        "text": "The Seljuk Han of Anatolia\n\nHistory of the Anatolian Seljuks\n\nAlthough this website is focused on the Seljuks of Anatolia, or the Seljuks of Rum (Eastern Rome) as they were known by their contemporaries, it is necessary to first trace their origins back in time and farther east in place. The Anatolian Seljuks are an offshoot tribal faction of a larger group of Turks, the Great Seljuks of Iran. The entire \"Seljuk Age\" spans three hundred years, from the 11th century through the 13th century.\n\nAs compared to the profusion of historical texts describing the Arab and Iranian spheres of the 13th century, few writings of the chroniclers of the Anatolian Seljuk era have come down to us. There are no biographical dictionaries, primary sources, panegyric poetry collections, or epics relating the exploits of the era. Numismatic evidence is scarce. Anatolia features rarely in histories and geographies produced in Iraq, Syria or Egypt. However, a rich source of information can be found in Christian texts, notably those left by the Crusaders. The paucity of prime resource material on the Seljuks has proven to be a challenge for those seeking to reconstruct the events of the era. For a list of the major historical primary sources for the Anatolian Seljuks, please consult the Historians page.\n\nINTRODUCTION: THE SELJUKS, TURKS ON THE MOVE\n\nThe Seljuk tribe was but one of the many Turkic peoples who had been migrating progressively westward from the Central Asian steppes for thousands of years. The Seljuks were a subdivision of the Kiniq clan of the Oğuz Turks, originating on the steppe north of the Aral Sea. By the middle of the 11th century, the Seljuk tribe was the first group to become a significant political entity. Under their remarkable leader, Tuğrul Bey, who led them from one victory to another between the years 1038-1063, they vanquished the Caliphate in Baghdad, and eventually, under his successors, much of western Asia. The Seljuk and Sunni Muslim mission was to restore orthodoxy to the central Islamic lands. By the early 12th century, the Seljuks were masters of most of Afghanistan, Persia and the Middle East as far west as Egypt. Further conquests followed, creating an empire that was geographically vast, diverse, and difficult to control. As a result, the Seljuk state began to break up into divisions beginning in the early 12th century. One group was the Seljuks who controlled Syria and Iran, and another were those in the eastern lands of Iran and Central Asia. This latter group became known as the \"Great Seljuks\" and their capital was located at Isfahan. Yet another subdivision came to be known as the \"Seljuks of Rum\". The term Rum comes from the Arabic word for the Roman Empire. The Seljuks called the lands of their sultanate Rum because it was established on territory traditionally known as Roman, meaning Byzantine, by Muslim armies. Later on, these Seljuks of Rum were affected by the Mongol invasions from Iran and Iraq which considerably weakened their centralized power base at Konya. They disappeared in the early 14th century when the state fragmented into independent principalities.\n\nThe Seljuks adopted Persian culture along with the Islamic faith on their way westward, although they chose the Sunni Hanefite sect instead of the Persian Shiite sect. Their culture was an amalgam of many languages and traditions. While Arabic retained its supremacy in the spheres of law, theology and science, the Persian language and customs dominated the culture of the court. Secular literature was largely based in Persian traditions. This can be seen in the practice of the Seljuk sultans of adopting the names of the epic heroes of the Persian culture (such as Giyaseddin, Kubad and Kay Khusraw) and in the literary production of the time, such as seen in Firdowsi's Shah-name (Book of Kings).\n\nTHE ISLAMIC WORLD AT THE END OF THE 10TH CENTURY\n\nThe Turks on the move westward encountered Islamic and Christian realms already established in the Middle East. The Islamic world at the end of the 10th century was dominated by the Abbasid empire, ruling from Baghdad. The Abbasid empire knew true grandeur only at its beginnings, after which it became so vast that it fell prey to division into fiefdoms ruled by local emirs. In addition to this decentralization of rule, another major disruptive element appeared at this time: the religious division of the Islamic faith into the Sunnite and Shiite sects. At the end of the 10th century, the sole Sunnite ruler was the Abbasid caliph, with Shiism triumphing everywhere else in the region. The Abbasid court even fell into the hands of the Shiite Buyid emirs in 945.\n\nAt the end of the 10th century, the Near East was thus in political chaos, with small, scattered emirates reigning independently. Syria had no central government since the end of the Umayyad Empire in the 8th century, and the Shiite Fatimids of Egypt were dealing with their own interior struggles.\n\nThe Byzantine Empire, on the other hand, was strong and centralized, with the Macedonian Dynasty in power since 867. The Byzantine Empire enjoyed commercial prosperity, an intellectual renaissance and a government led by strong emperors. Constantinople was its capital city, with important satellite centers in Venice, southern Italy and the Slavic countries. However, the Turks had already made inroads into the Byzantine Empire, which employed them as mercenary troops. For the most part, the army of the Byzantine Empire consisted of private troops hired by the state, and these mercenary troops included Turks, Scandinavians and Normans.\n\nTHE GREAT SELJUKS OF IRAN\n\nThe Turkish tribe of the Seljuks takes its name from one of its chiefs, Seljuk. This family of the Oghuz Turks from Central Asia lived in the area east of the Caspian Sea near the Aral Sea. These Turkish nomads became known in Islamic terminology as the \"Turkmens\" or \"Turkomans\". As tent (yurt) dwellers, they lived a pastoral life based on transhumance. By the end of the 10th century, the clan chieftain, Seljuk, always searching for greener pastures for their animals, settled his family on the left bank of the lower Syr-Darya River. From here they moved into Transoxiana (the region around present-day Samarkand). It was at approximately at this time that the Seljuk tribe converted from Shamanism to Sunnite Islam, although they maintained many of their shamanistic customs and beliefs. They were contenders for this area, along with other dynasties such as the Karahanids, Ghaznevids and the Samanids. This area \"beyond the Oxus\", fed by the waters of both the Syr Darya and Amu Darya Rivers, was a lush, green prize, and offered the only fertile lands in the area. The Seljuks managed to create a vast empire, stretching from the Marmara Sea to Central Asia, and from the Caucasus to India and Yemen. Its borders were so vast that it was called the Great Seljuk state. It is reported that the famous warrior Seljuk was over 100 years old when he died in 1007.\n\nAfter several defeats at the hands of the Seljuks, the Ghaznevids, another powerful Turkish dynasty located in northern India, the Khorasan and Iran, ceded the arid Khorasan region (northwestern Iran) in 1035 to the Seljuk prince Chağribey, son of Seljuk. His brother, Tuğrul Beg, is the true creator of the Seljuk power, founding the important cities of Nishapur in 1038 and Khwarezm in 1042. He entered Iran and seized Hamadan and Isfahan, and founded his capital at Isfahan in 1051. In 1055, the caliph of Baghdad, after several serious incidents and revolts, appealed to Tuğrul for help. Tuğrul entered the city, and took the city as his protectorate, and was awarded the title of Sultan by the Abassid caliph.\n\nMelik Shah, son and successor of Alp Arslan in 1072, and was one of the most powerful and brilliant rulers of the Great Seljuks. He seized Transoxiana and Kirman in 1079. During his reign, the Great Seljuk empire extended from Asia Minor to Turkestan. However, upon his death in 1092, the empire collapsed, with family members splitting up the territories, thereby weakening the centralized power. The empire included the local states run by the Syrian Seljuks, the Iraq and Khorasan Seljuks, the Kirman Seljuks and the Anatolian Seljuks. The Great Seljuks were able to maintain their power for another 100 years or so, but due to the conflicts with the Ismalian Shiites (Turkish tribes coming from Central Asia), the Crusaders, and other Turkish tribes migrating from Central Asia, the Great Seljuk Empire definitively ended with the death of Tuğrul III in 1194.\n\nDuring the reign of Sultan Melik Shah, the Great Seljuk State experienced its most successful period in the fields of military, science, politics and literature. One of the keys to the success of this empire was a strong centralized government, the result of the administrative genius of the grand vizier Nizam al-Mulk, the right-hand man of Melik Shah. He wrote his theories of government in a treatise called the Siyaset-Name, which defined the roles of the army, taxation, education, justice, finances, civil servants and the power structure. In addition, the age of Great Seljuk supremacy was one of the most glorious in all of Persian history, with an outstanding building program comprising some 50 monuments, such as the Masjid-i Jami of Isfahan. They were famous as builders of medreses (institutions of higher learning), such as the Nizamiye Medrese. Their ceramic art was prolific (Amol, Gabri, Lakabi, Kashan blue and black wares and the Rayy minai lusterwares) and they were master metalworkers. The art and architecture of the Great Seljuks is one of the most refined of the entire Islamic canon.\n\nTHE TURKS IN ANATOLIA and the NEAR EAST\n\nThe Seljuk branch of the Great Seljuks was not the only group of Turks on the scene. At the same time the Great Seljuks were gaining power, other tribes of Turks were carving out small principalities in the Near East: these included the Saltukids in Erzurum, the Danishmendids in northwest Anatolia (Tokat, Niksar and Sivas), the Mengujukids on the Upper Euphrates (Erzincan and Divriği), the Artuqids in Central Anatolia, the Kharazem Shahs of the lower Oxus, and the Zangids and the Kurdish Ayyubids in Syria. These dynasties were more or less ephemeral, never lasting more than 75 years or so; in the end absorbed by the Anatolian Seljuks or, later, by the Mongols. By far the most brilliant leader of this group of small principalities was Salah ad-Din, known to the West as Saladin of the Crusades, who founded the dynasty of the Ayyubids, at one point master of all Syria and Egypt (end 12th century).\n\nOf all the minor break-away dynasties founded by the members of the Seljuk tribes (the Syrian, Khorasan, Iraq, Kirman Seljuk states), only one managed to organize a solid and lasting state: the Anatolian Seljuks of Asia Minor, otherwise known as the Seljuks of Rum.\n\nSELJUKS OF RUM: 1077-1308\n\nThe Anatolian Seljuks were the founders of the first true Turkish state in Anatolia (today's Turkey). The Seljuks of Anatolia were responsible for one of the richest and most inventive periods in Turkish culture. They ruled over most of Turkey for almost two centuries, between the 11-13th centuries, from their capital in Konya. During that time, their refined and enlightened culture flourished throughout most of the land.\n\nAnatolia, or Asia Minor as it was known in ancient times, has been inhabited for 30,000 years. A land bridge due to its location, it possesses an abundance of natural resources, water, good soil, and a fairly suitable climate. It has always been attractive to settlers from many civilizations since the beginning of time, such as the Hittites, Urartians, Phrygians and the Greeks, and, lastly, the Turks from the East. After the Battle of Manzikert of 1071, the Anatolian Seljuks entered and occupied the central part of Anatolia. A scant 30 years, or two generations, separated the first Seljuk state of Tuğrul Bey with that of the Seljuks of Rum in 1071. It was the Seljuks who brought the Islamic faith to Turkey.\n\nThe Seljuk Turkish incursions into Anatolia prior to the Battle of Manzikert consisted of a series of adventure-seeking destructive raids, aimed at plundering for booty. These raids used the previously unseen warfare style of mounted archers. The Turks sought to seize livestock, to secure space to graze their herds, and to take captives for ransom. Acting on behalf of, or independently of the sultan, they carried out these raids and returned east to their northern Iranian bases, for they had no desire to remain in the country once their plundering was accomplished. After the Battle of Manzikert, however, the situation changed, as they could now settle there and establish a homeland for themselves. As these nomadic tribes advanced to the north and the west, they found a profitable livelihood in the region by becoming sedentary farmers and livestock breeders.\n\nAfter the Battle of Manzikert, there were two notable Turkish powers in the region: the Seljuks in the southern areas and the Danishmendid tribe (the Learned Men\") to the north in the region of Tokat. These two rival Turkish groups would interact for many years to come, alternately as adversaries and allies. These two groups operated amidst the complex political and ethnic makeup of Anatolia at that time: Latin strongholds, the Byzantines, the colonies of Venetian and Genoese merchants, the Knights of St. John in the Mediterranean, the Greeks in the west, and the Armenians and Georgians to the east. In the end, however, the Seljuks of Rum prevailed and created an Empire which laid the bases for the country now known as Turkey.\n\nThe Seljuks were more than great builders. For its short period of existence, the Seljuks of Anatolia created a kingdom based on military might, commerce, education and culture. Indeed, the cultural gateway created by the Seljuks influenced the entire Middle East and Europe. Anatolia in the 13th century produced three great leaders in the world of humanism: Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi (1207-1273), Haci Bektas Veli (1210-1271), and Yunus Emre (1238-1320). The Sufi scholar Ibn Arabi also spent much time in Seljuk Turkey. As a comparison, just half a century after these three Turkish humanists, appeared the three great humanists of the West: Dante (1265-1321), Petrarch (1304-1374) and Boccaccio (1313-1375) - inspired perhaps, one is tempted to imagine, by the cultural activity of the Seljuks.\n\nLiterature flourished during the Seljuk period. Under the Anatolian Seljuks, Konya in the 13th century was the site of one of the creation of the crowning glories of Persian classical literature: the Mesnevi by Jalal al-Din Rumi, known to the Turks as Mevlana (\"Our Master\") written in 1258-1273. Although Arabic was spoken in the Mosque, and Persian at the court, the Turkish language was used in everyday speech on the streets and in the army. Later, it made its appearance in literature, notably with the folk poetry of Yunus Emre (1240?-1321?).\n\nThe Seljuks of Rum were a cosmopolitan group, for they were in contact with the traditions of the Byzantine and Christian populations living in Anatolia at this time (Greeks, Byzantines, Latins and Armenians). The Seljuks signed trade agreements with the Genoese and the Venetians, and several sultans spent time during their youth at the Byzantine courts in Constantinople (notably Giyaseddin Keyhüsrev, together with his sons, Izzeddin Keykavüs and Alaeddin Keykubad). Political marriages with Byzantine and Arabic princesses were frequent. The Seljuks thus widened their world view by contact with the Christian West, in addition to the traditions inherited from the Arabs and the Persians.\n\nThe world of the Seljuks was suddenly overwhelmed in 1243 by the devastating invasion of the Mongols. The Anatolian Seljuks became the vassals of the Mongols, with the empire finally collapsing in 1308 into a series of local principalities that would rule for another hundred years or so, before the arrival of the Ottomans.\n\nThe leaders, or Sultans, of the Anatolian Seljuks, are listed below along with a brief description of the events of their reign. The coins of each sultan are from the collection of Bahadir Kalayci displayed in the Antalya Museum."
