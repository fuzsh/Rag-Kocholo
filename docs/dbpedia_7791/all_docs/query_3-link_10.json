        "text": "Origins of the Ottoman Empire\n\nOsman I, a leader of the Turkish tribes in Anatolia, founded the Ottoman Empire around 1299. The term “Ottoman” is derived from Osman’s name, which was “Uthman” in Arabic.\n\nThe Ottoman Turks set up a formal government and expanded their territory under the leadership of Osman I, Orhan, Murad I and Bayezid I.\n\nIn 1453, Mehmed II the Conqueror led the Ottoman Turks in seizing the ancient city of Constantinople, the Byzantine Empire’s capital. This put an end to the 1,000-year reign of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nSultan Mehmed renamed the city Istanbul and made it the new capital of the Ottoman Empire. Istanbul became a dominant international center of trade and culture.\n\nMehmed died in 1481. His oldest son, Bayezid II, became the new Sultan.\n\nRise of the Ottoman Empire\n\nBy 1517, Bayezid’s son, Selim I, brought Syria, Arabia, Palestine, and Egypt under Ottoman control.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire reached its peak between 1520 and 1566, during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent. This period was marked by great power, stability and wealth.\n\nSuleiman created a uniform system of law and welcomed different forms of arts and literature. Many Muslims considered Suleiman a religious leader as well as a political ruler.\n\nThroughout Sultan Suleiman’s rule, the empire expanded and included areas of Eastern Europe.\n\nWhat Regions Were Part of the Ottoman Empire?\n\nAt its height, the Ottoman Empire included the following regions:\n\nTurkey\n\nGreece\n\nBulgaria\n\nEgypt\n\nHungary\n\nMacedonia\n\nRomania\n\nSerbia\n\nBosnia\n\nHerzegovina\n\nCroatia\n\nHungary\n\nMesopotamia\n\nPalestine\n\nLebanon\n\nSyria\n\nSome of Arabia\n\nA considerable amount of the North African coastal strip\n\nOttoman Art and Science\n\nThe Ottomans were known for their achievements in art, science and medicine. Istanbul and other major cities throughout the empire were recognized as artistic hubs, especially during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\nSome of the most popular forms of art included calligraphy, painting, poetry, textiles and carpet weaving, ceramics and music.\n\nOttoman architecture also helped define the culture of the time. Elaborate mosques and public buildings were constructed during this period.\n\nScience was regarded as an important field of study. The Ottomans learned and practiced advanced mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, physics, geography and chemistry.\n\nAdditionally, some of the greatest advances in medicine were made by the Ottomans. They invented several surgical instruments that are still used today, such as forceps, catheters, scalpels, pincers and lancets.\n\nFratricide\n\nUnder Sultan Selim, a new policy emerged, which included fratricide, or the murder of brothers.\n\nWhen a new Sultan was crowned, his brothers would be imprisoned. When the Sultan’s first son was born, his brothers and their sons would be killed. This system ensured that the rightful heir would take the throne.\n\nBut, not every Sultan followed this harsh ritual. Over time, the practice evolved. In the later years, the brothers would only be put in prison—not killed.\n\nTopkapi\n\nA total of 36 Sultans ruled the Ottoman Empire between 1299 and 1922. For many of these years, the Ottoman Sultan would live in the elaborate Topkapi palace complex in Istanbul. It contained dozens of gardens, courtyards and residential and administrative buildings.\n\nPart of the Topkapi palace included the harem, a separate quarters reserved for wives, concubines and female slaves. These women were positioned to serve the Sultan, while the men in the harem complex were typically eunuchs.\n\nThe threat of assassination was always a concern for a Sultan. He relocated every night as a safety measure.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire and Other Religions\n\nMost scholars agree that the Ottoman Turk rulers were tolerant of other religions.\n\nThose who weren’t Muslim were categorized by the millet system, a community structure that gave minority groups a limited amount of power to control their own affairs while still under Ottoman rule. Some millets paid taxes, while others were exempt.\n\nDevshirme\n\nIn the 14th century, the devshirme system was created. This required conquered Christians to give up 20 percent of their male children to the state. The children were forced to convert to Islam and become slaves.\n\nAlthough they served as slaves, some of the converts became powerful and wealthy. Many were trained for government service or the Ottoman military. The elite military group, known as the Janissaries, was primarily made up of forced Christian converts.\n\nThe devshirme system lasted until the end of the 17th century.\n\nThe Decline of the Ottoman Empire\n\nStarting in the 1600s, the Ottoman Empire began to lose its economic and military dominance over Europe.\n\nAround this time, Europe had strengthened rapidly with the Renaissance and the dawn of the Industrial Revolution. Other factors, such as poor leadership and having to compete with trade from the Americas and India, led to the weakening of the empire.\n\nIn 1683, the Ottoman Turks were defeated at the Battle of Vienna. This loss added to their already waning status.\n\nOver the next hundred years, the empire began to lose key regions of land. After a revolt, Greece won its independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830.\n\nIn 1878, the Congress of Berlin declared the independence of Romania, Serbia and Bulgaria.\n\nDuring the Balkan Wars, which took place in 1912 and 1913, the Ottoman Empire lost nearly all its territories in Europe.\n\nWhen Did the Ottoman Empire Fall?\n\nAt the start of World War I, the Ottoman Empire was already in decline. The Ottoman army entered the war in 1914 on the side of the Central Powers (including Germany and Austria-Hungary) and was defeated in October 1918.\n\nFollowing the Armistice of Mudros, most Ottoman territories were divided between Britain, France, Greece and Russia.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire officially ended in 1922 when the title of Ottoman Sultan was eliminated. Turkey was declared a republic on October 29, 1923, when Mustafa Kemal Atatürk (1881-1938), an army officer, founded the independent Republic of Turkey. He then served as Turkey’s first president from 1923 until his death in 1938, implementing reforms that rapidly secularized and westernized the country.\n\nArmenian Genocide\n\nThe Armenian Genocide was perhaps the most controversial and damning event associated with the Ottomans.\n\nIn 1915, Turkish leaders made a plan to massacre Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire. Most scholars believe that about 1.5 million Armenians were killed.\n\nFor years, the Turkish government has denied responsibility for the genocide. In fact, it’s illegal, even today, to talk about the Armenian Genocide in Turkey.\n\nThe Ottoman Legacy\n\nAfter ruling for more than 600 years, the Ottoman Turks are often remembered for their powerful military, ethnic diversity, artistic ventures, religious tolerance and architectural marvels.\n\nThe mighty empire’s influence is still very much alive in the present-day Turkish Republic, a modern, mostly secular nation thought of by many scholars as a continuation of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nSources"
