William Shakespeare was just two years old when Suleiman died, as was Galileo Galilei.\n\nDuring his reign Suleiman the Magnificent guided the Ottoman Empire through its golden age of trade and expansion.

Suleiman the Magnificent wasn't quite like any other sultan before or after him. This book explains why.\n\nIn Suleiman the Magnificent: A Captivating Guide to the Longest-Reigning Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, you will discover topics such as\n\nThe World Before Suleiman I\n\nSuccession\n\nLover, Poet, & Patron of the Arts\n\nFather\n\nFriend\n\nCampaigner\n\nStatesman\n\nAnd much, much more!\n\nSo if you want to learn more about Suleiman the Magnificent, click \"add to cart\"!"
