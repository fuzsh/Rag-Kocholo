It primarily established in 1299 and finally ended in 1923, becoming the country of Turkey.\n\nSee the fact file below for more information on the Ottoman Empire or alternatively, you can download our 21-page Ottoman Empire worksheet pack to utilise within the classroom or home environment.\n\nKey Facts & Information\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was one in all the foremost powerful and longest-lasting dynasties in world history.\n\nThe chief leader, called the Sultan, was given absolute religious and political authority over his folks.\n\nWhile Western Europeans commonly viewed the Ottoman Empire as a threat, many historians regard them as the origin of great regional stability and security, including the significant achievements in the arts, science, religion, and culture.\n\nORIGIN OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\n\nOsman I, leader of the Turkish clans in Anatolia, established the Ottoman Empire in 1299.\n\nThe word “Ottoman” is taken from the name of Osman, which was “Uthman” in Arabic.\n\nOsman I extended his kingdom, uniting various independent nations of Anatolia under one rule. Osman instituted a formal government and granted religious tolerance over the people he surmounted.\n\nIn 1453, Mehmed II the Conqueror directed the Ottoman Empire in capturing the city of Constantinople, the capital of the Byzantine Empire. This happening put an end to the 1,000-year reign of the Byzantine Empire.\n\nSultan Mehmed made Constantinople the new capital of the Ottoman Empire and gave it a new name Istanbul. Istanbul turned into a domineering global center of trade and culture.\n\nBayezid II, the eldest son of Mehmed, became the new Sultan after he died in 1481.\n\nTHE RISE OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\n\nSelim I, the son of Bayezid, brought Syria, Arabia, Palestine, and Egypt under Ottoman control in 1517.\n\nDuring the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman Empire was able to reach its peak by 1520 and 1566. This era was identified by great power, stability and wealth.\n\nSuleiman formed a uniform system of law and embraced diverse forms of arts and literature. Numerous Muslims regarded Suleiman as a religious leader also as a political ruler.\n\nDuring Sultan Suleiman’s control, the empire expanded and covered areas of Eastern Europe.\n\nCOUNTRIES PART OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\n\nRegions added by the Ottoman Empire are: Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Macedonia, Romania, Jordan, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Some of Arabia and a considerable amount of the North African coastal strip.\n\nOTTOMAN ART AND SCIENCE\n\nThe Ottomans were recognized as artistic hubs for their successes in art, science, and medicine notably during the reign of Suleiman the Magnificent.\n\nMost of their popular forms of art involved calligraphy, painting, poetry, textiles and carpet weaving, ceramics and music.\n\nThe Ottoman architecture further helped determine the culture of the time.\n\nElaborate mosques and unrestricted buildings were built throughout this era.\n\nScience was viewed as a major field of study while advanced arithmetic, astronomy, philosophy, physics, geography, and chemistry were learned and exercised by the Ottoman.\n\nIn addition, some of the greatest advances in medicine invented were made by the Ottomans such as forceps, catheters, scalpels, pincers, and lancets that were still used today.\n\nRELIGION\n\nReligion played a fundamental role in the Ottoman Empire. Even the Ottomans themselves were Muslims, they did not require the peoples they conquered to convert.\n\nInstead, they permitted Christians and Jews to worship without persecution. This made the people they conquered evade rebelling and allowed them to rule for a long time.\n\nTHE SULTAN\n\nThe head of the Ottoman Empire was called the Sultan. The title of the Sultan was inherited by the oldest son. While the latest Sultan took power he would place all of his brothers into prison. Once he had a son of his own to obtain the sovereignty, he would have his brothers executed.\n\nThere is a total of thirty-six Sultans dominated the Turkish Empire inside 1299 and 1922.\n\nThe Ottoman Sultan would reside in the elaborate Topkapi palace complex in Istanbul. It contained thousands of gardens, courtyards, and residential and body buildings.\n\nA portion within the Topkapi palace is that the harem, a separate quarters reserved for wives, mistresses and female slaves. These ladies were positioned to serve the sultan, whereas the lads within the harem complex were generally eunuchs.\n\nThere is a continuing threat of assassination for a sultan. For safety measures, he resettled nightly.\n\nDECLINE OF THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE\n\nThe empire began to decline within the late 1600s. It ceased to expand and commenced to face economic competition from India and Europe.\n\nInternal corruption and poor leadership led to a gentle decline till the empire was abolished and also the country of Turkey was declared a republic in 1923.\n\nARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\nThe Armenian genocide was probably the foremost controversial and inculpative event associated with the Ottomans.\n\nIn 1915, Turkish leaders created a plan to massacre Armenians living within the Ottoman Empire. Most critics assume that about 1.5 million Armenians were killed.\n\nFor years, the Turkish government has denied responsibility for genocide. In fact, it’s felonious, even today, to speak regarding the Armenian genocide in Turkey.\n\nTHE OTTOMAN LEGACY\n\nAfter ruling for over 600 years, the Ottoman Turks are typically remembered for their powerful military, ethnic diversity, creative ventures, religious tolerance and architectural marvels.\n\nThe mighty empire’s influence continues to be much alive within the contemporary Turkish Republic, a modern, principally secular nation thought of by several scholars as a continuation of the ottoman empire.\n\nOttoman Empire Worksheets\n\nThis is a fantastic bundle which includes everything you need to know about the Ottoman Empire across 21 in-depth pages.
