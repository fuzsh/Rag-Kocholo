        "text": "THE OTTOMAN SULṬĀNS\n\nAND CALIPHS, 1290-1924 AD\n\nV. THE FIFTH EMPIRE, OTTOMANS,\n\nISLAMIC \"BYZANTIUM,\" 1453-1922,\n\nEra of Diocletian 1170-1639, 469 years\n\nThe Ottoman Empire is named after its eponymous founder, the Emir Osman. \"Osman\" is from Arabic , ʿUθmān (عُثْمَان), the name of the Third Caliph. We get /s/ in \"Osman\" because the /θ/ becomes /s/ in Persian, a language that, for secular purposes, had become by the 10th century as prestigious in ʾIslām as Arabic. From the /θ/ becoming a /t/, as it does in Italian or Modern Arabic, we get \"Ottoman,\" henceforth the name of the dynasty of Osman -- otherwise , Osmanlı (عُثْمَانْلِى).\n\nThe proper name of the country, as it has become, Türkiye, (تُرْكِيَا), Turkey, is from the name of the people or the language, the Turks and Turkish, respectively. That goes back well before the Ottoman Empire and applies to other Altaic speaking peoples and their languages in Central Asia; but modern Turkey, even after several Pan-Turkish or Pan-Turanian movements, has tended to absorb the Turkish identity from the other peoples to the East -- the Kazakhs now seem to think of themselves as Kazakhs, not Turks.\n\nRecently, the aspiring dictator of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has decided that \"Türkiye,\" rather than \"Turkey,\" should be used diplomatically and in public discourse for Turkey -- we already see it in commercials for Turkish tourism on American television -- perhaps because \"Turkey\" sounds like the stupid bird that Americans eat on Thanksgiving. Since we know that Erdoğan thinks that insults against him are a crime, this sounds characteristic of his thinking. Perhaps tourism would be better encouraged if Erdoğan had not made Sancta Sophia and other Byzantine churches into mosques, after Atatürk had secularized them.\n\nApart from the Turkic past, Turkish identity has otherwise come from ʾIslām, in which the Turks became a major factor when the Seljuk Turks took Baghdad in 1055, and from Anatolia, which the Seljuks invaded in 1071, establishing the Sultānate of Rūm, and where the Ottomans eventually overthrew and replaced Romania, i.e. the Mediaeval Roman or so-called \"Byzantine\" Empire. By the end of the 15th century, the Ottoman Empire was in extent much like Romania of the Macedonian Emperors had been in the mid-11th century, with, of course, now the same capital, Constantinople.\n\nMuch that seems characteristic of ʾIslām today, like the domed mosque, inspired by the great church of Sancta Sophia, and perhaps even the symbol of the Crescent, are due to Byzantine influence by way of the Ottomans. There is therefore a sense in which I would regard the history of the Ottoman Empire as a continuation, mutatis mutandis, of Roman history. Thus, Lord Kinross (John Patrick Douglas Balfour, 3rd Baron Kinross, 1904-1976), in his The Ottoman Centuries, The Rise and Fall of the Turkish Empire [Morrow Quill Paperbacks, 1977], gives Part II of the book the title \"The New Byzantium\" -- hence the \"Fifth [Roman] Empire\" and \"Islamic Byzantium\" designations in the heading above.\n\nAs an Islamic state, of course, Turkey does not really belong to the same civilization as Ancient Rome or Mediaeval Constantinople, but then that sort of mismatch continues in the story of Modern Turkey, which Atatürk tried, with considerable success, to make into a European rather than a Middle Eastern country. This achievement is now eroding; and the conflicts that attend these different influences continue.\n\nOsmanlı Oghulları ʿOsman I\n\nAmir,\n\n1290-1326 village of Söğüt, 1265; defeats Romans near Nicomedia, Ottoman\n\nconquest begins, 1302;

After vassalage to the Mongols (1243), the domain finally disintegrated (1307). Meanwhile, however, the Turkish presence in Anatolia was actually invigorated with refugees from the Mongol advance.\n\nThe new domains that resulted were the Oghullar or \"sons\" of Rūm. These included many , ghuzāh (غُزَاة; singular ghāzin, -- غَازٍ -- or ghāzī, , without the indefinite nunation), or fighters for ʾIslām (otherwise , mujāhidūn, مُجَاهِدُون), particularly frontier fighters. However, ghāzin literally means someone engaged in a , ghazwah (غَزْوَة), a \"raid,\" which could simply have meant a tribal affair, with no relation to the , Jihād (جِهَاد), or proper warfare.\n\nStrictly speaking, frontier fighters would be , murābiṭūn (مُرَابِطُون; singular , murābiṭ, مُرَابِط), those fighters at the , ribāṭ (رِبَاط), the frontier or, more specificially, frontier fortress.\n\nCuriously, this terminology tended to drift towards North Africa, where the name fixes on the dynasty of the Almoravids, the Spanish pronunciation of ʾal-Murābiṭūn, . Also, the meaning of ribāṭ itself drifted towards \"hermitage,\" something a little unusual in ʾIslām, where there is no formal monasticism -- or even toward meaning \"caravansary\" or \"hospice.\" This North African locus, and the changing meanings, may be why the Turkish fighters in the East became known just as ghuzāh, .\n\n'Osman Ghāzī, (now just Osman Gazi) found himself on the frontier of Roman Bithynia, across from his Christian military counterparts, the akritai, ἀκρίται (singular akritês, ἀκρίτης). He defeated the Roman army at Bapheus in 1302 but is best remembered for breaking through into Bithynia and capturing Prusa (1326), which became Bursa, the first capital of the Ottoman Emirate.\n\nThereafter Ottoman progress was steady and often spectacular. The most fateful moment may have been in 1354, when Turkish forces were ferried across to Europe to help in a war between Venice and Genoa. I think John Cantacuzenus was responsible for this. When Orkhān took Kallipolis, after an earthquake had thrown down its walls -- to become \"Gelibolu\" in Turkish but better known as \"Gallipoli\" in Italian -- the Ottomans achieved a fateful foothold in Europe whose importance would still echo in World War I -- and still belongs to Turkey today.\n\nWhile Ankara would be taken in the same year, this is not a city that would be of political importance until Atatürk chose it to be the capital many years later. Instead, when Adrianople was captured in 1369, the Ottomans transferred their capital there from Bursa. The Ottoman capital was now on the continent of Europe, where it would remain, with a switch to Constantinople, all the rest of the dynasty.\n\nIn short order Turkey became a European as much or more than an Asian power, a duality that persists, even when Turkey's modern holdings in Europe are a shadow of the former Empire. As the Anatolian Roman Empire was known in Arabic and Turkish as Rūm, , initial Ottoman possessions in Europe became Rumelia (Turkish Rumeli, ) -- subsequently contrasted with Anatolia as Anadolu ( , where we see some not unusual in Ottoman Turkish, that a final \"u\" is actually written as a \"y,\" with the phonetic expression determined by vowel harmony).\n\nSteady Ottoman conquest and victory suffered a stunning setback in 1402. Bāyezīd I, known as the \"Thunderbolt\" (Yıldırım), who had obtained a diploma from the Abbasid Caliph in Egypt as Sulṭān of Rūm, was defeated and captured by Tamerlane at the Battle of Ankara. He died in captivity, Tamerlane restored some of the Oghullar, and Bāyezīd's sons, whimsically named after the founders of Judaism, Christianity, and Islām, fell out among each other in a fraternal civil war (note that ʿÎsā is Arabic for Jesus, as Mūsā is for Moses). With poetic suitability, Meḥmed I, named, of course, after Muḥammad, won the Throne. He then initiated a grim Ottoman custom. New Sulṭāns henceforth, until 1603, murdered all their many brothers (of their polygamous fathers) to prevent such civil wars. This had a more durable evil effect. Ottoman heirs were raised as prisoners in the Harem, with no exposure to the outside world or real political education. Even a Sulṭān without rivals, and even a Sulṭān who no longer murdered his brothers, would have little of the knowledge or experience to be an effective ruler. It is hard to know how much this contributed to Ottoman stagnation and decline, but the effect was likely considerable.\n\nIt took a couple of generations for the Ottomans to recover from Tamerlane. When a young Meḥmed II came to the Throne, however, the Empire was ready and the new Sulṭān went straight for Constantinople. On May 29, 1453, its walls breached for the first time by modern cannonballs, Constantinople fell -- exactly 1123 years and 19 days after the City was dedicated by Constantine I on May 11, 330 AD. The last Roman Emperor, Constantine XI, died anonymously in the fighting. His body may or may not have been recovered, leading to legends that he still sleeps under the Golden Gate of modern Istanbul. Europeans now seem loath to admit, as contemporaries then were well aware, that this was the last of the Roman Empire (Romania), which had effectively guarded the flank of Christendom and preserved the heritage of Classical Civilization all through the Middle Ages. With the Ottomans already on the Danube, there was nothing left to block their advance into Central Europe.\n\nAt Meḥmed II's death, the Ottoman Empire looked much the way Romania had in the 11th Century. Selīm I \"the Grim\" did what the old Emperors had never been able to do, restore Syria and Egypt to the empire, from the Mamlūks. Selīm I had deposed his own father, who died shortly thereafter, and executed two brothers already regarded as Heirs Apparent. A nephew fled to Persia. Selīm I smashed the Safavids and massacred Shiʿites.\n\nSüleimān I then added areas that had never been permanent parts of the Roman Empire, like Iraq and Hungary. Picking up the conflict with the Safavids, Süleimān I for the first time since Alexander the Great removed Iraq from Iranian possession (the map above shows the pre-Safavid Aq Qoyunlu or White Sheep Turks). This was a historic shift in Middle Eastern geography. Iraq had long been linked to the states on the Iranian plateau, either ruling them or ruled by them. Even Trajan could not permanently detach Iraq from Irān. But now Süleimān did. And Iraq remained part of Turkey until after World War I, when the British installed a Hashemite monarchy. The conquest of Hungary was the first penetration of Islām into Francia since the conquest of Spain.\n\nThe Ottoman Empire was at its height for about 150 years. It had at that point, however, reached the limits beyond which it could not easily project its power. One reason for this was that much of the Ottoman army, like Medaeval armies, was still a matter of temporary annual levies. No modern conquests could have been made at all with such an army, but the spearhead of the Ottoman military consisted of the famous Janissaries (Turkish , Yeŋiçeri, يَڭِيچَرِى, \"new soldiers\"). This was a corps of wholly modern outfit and training, at least for the 15th and 16th centuries. However, it was also limited in size by a very Mediaeval aspect of its constitution: Its ranks were filled with slave boys taken from Christian families and converted to Islām. This was the infamous Dev&scedil;irme, دوشيرمه (\"collecting\"), the \"child levy\" or \"blood tax.\" These were drawn from all over the Empire, but there seemed to be particular emphasis on Circassians, from the Caucasus. It is hard to imagine an institution more evil: \"We will take your child away from you, alienate him from his family, his religion, and his culture, and make him an enemy of all of them.\"\n\nThe use of slave troops for an Imperial guard went back to Abbasids and was currently the practice, as it had been for centuries, of the Mamlūks in Egypt (where , mamlūk means \"possessed,\" i.e. a slave). The ultimate threat of such an elite body of troops is always that it will become a Praetorian Guard whose interest is more political and personal than it is faithful and disinterested. Thus, while Abbasid Caliphs were sometimes prisoners of their guards, the Mamlūks had actually overthrown their original employers, the Ayyūbid Sulṭāns, and replaced them.\n\nThe height of the evil influence of the Janissaries may be when they overthrew the reforming Sulṭān Selīm III in 1807. They met their end in 1826 when the vigorous Sulṭān Maḥmūd II turned the guns of his new artillery corps on the Janissary barracks and massacred them. It would prove difficult, however, for the Ottomans to find a replacement, since an effective modern military depended on an effective modern economy, which the Ottomans would really never have. In World War I Turkish soldiers would prove themselves tough and even formidable, given proper equipment, leadership, and support -- but these were often lacking. In Korea, Turkish troops had the reputation of being very tough -- and not taking prisoners.\n\nIt is noteworthy at the beginning of the 17th century that Ottoman Sulṭāns ceased to murder their brothers on accession. Henceforth the Throne passes, by Middle Eastern custom, to brothers and even to cousins before going to the next generation.\n\nFrom the 16th to the 17th centuries, conflict continued with Austria and with Christian powers in the Mediterranean, but respective holdings didn't change much. The Sulṭān Aḥmad Mosque, or the Blue Mosque, adjacent to the site of the old Hippodrome of Constantinople, is a fitting symbol of this period. However, the Venetians were on the offensive, and most of the achievements of the period were due to the energetic Köprülü vizirs.\n\nIn 1656 the Valide Sultan, (Queen Mother), Turhan, appointed Mehmed Köprülü Grand Vizir (in the genealogy, \"Köprülüzade\" employs the Persian patronymic for the family). The long delayed fall of Crete in 1669 (from Venice) then seemed like the portent of renewed conquests.\n\nThe power of the Empire was renewed. A new assault was planned, after 150 years, against Vienna in 1683. But this turned into a disaster, suddenly revealing the relative weakness that had actually overcome the Empire. At first the siege went well. The Austrians were hard pressed, and the Ottoman works, over two months, since July 14th, relentlessly approached and undermined the walls. The City could well have fallen, and would have. Charges were set to open a large breach in the walls. Defenders were prepared to fight in the streets. However, Vienna in 1683 would have something that Constantinople in 1453 did not have, which was a significant relief and rescue force.\n\nRaised by the tireless efforts of the Emperor Leopold I (1658-1705), 81,000 Polish, Austrian, and German troops (about half the size of the Ottoman army) approached the city on 12 September 1683, led by the Polish King John III Sobieski (1674-1696).\n\n\"King John III Sobieski blessing Polish attack on Turks in Vienna, 1683,\" 1871, by Juliusz Kossak (18241899)\n\nAfter a day of hard fighting, as the Turks were still trying to break into the city, the charge of Sobieski's legendary heavy cavalry, the \"Winged Hussars,\" one of the largest, most dramatic, and certainly most effective cavalry charges in military history, absolutely shattered the Ottoman army, precipitated its disorganized flight, and instantly raised the siege.\n\nWhere Süleymān I had broken off the siege and withdrawn in good order from Vienna in 1529, the retreat in 1683 was a disaster. The siege was not lifted, it was destroyed, along with the Ottoman army.\n\nThe Ottoman camp was so large that it was looted for a full week; and the victorious soldiers found coffee, from Ethiopia, for the first time in Central Europe -- it had arrived in England by sea earlier, with the first coffee house opening in 1652. The ability of the Turks to stay awake during the long siege was then attributed to this wonder drug.\n\nThe 1683 siege and battle of Vienna turned out to be the High Water Mark of the Ottoman Empire. As the failure of Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg is seen as the High Water Mark of the Confederacy, the success of King John's charge seals the limit of the Ottoman advance in Europe. The age of Ottoman decline had begun. World War I would see the last losses, and the end of the Empire itself.\n\nThe Grand Vizir, Qara \"Black\" Mustafa, now a Köprülü-in-law, who planned and led the Vienna campaign, was executed after the retreat. In the aftermath, even a de facto alliance with friendly France, the greatest power of the day, could not prevent a series of defeats, the loss of Hungary, and the temporary loss of southern Greece to Venice (when the Parthenon would be destroyed in 1687).\n\nThe threat of continuous defeat, which the beginning of the 18th century seemed to display, receded somewhat. Austria would not advance deeper into the Balkans and there was some breathing room. Nevertheless, the Ottomans were now facing the problem of catching up with the technological advances of Europe, even of relatively backward Russia, which it was in no way prepared to tackle. The problem was not any particular hostility to modern commercial culture -- merchants and markets were perfectly respectable characteristics of Middle Eastern Islāmic civilization -- but a very profound social conservativism, a satisfaction with the Mediaeval forms of life, prevented any of this from developing into modern institutions of banking, industry, and entrepreneurship.\n\nLike the Chinese, the Turks literally did not believe there was anything new to learn, much less from despised Unbelievers. The bustle and excitement of the great Bazaar of Constantinople thus never led to the explosion of energy and production that was already characteristic of the Netherlands and other places in Western Europe. Turkey would always be playing catch-up but would then never actually catch up. Institutional reforms, when they were even tried, still could never go deep enough, could never actually produce a people striving and inquisitive beyond their previous habits. Indeed, much of business was conducted by Greeks and Armenians. Peter the Great faced similar problems with another conservative society about the same time.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, as Napoleon surged back and forth across Europe, the subject Christians of the Balkans became more and more restless, and Russia began to try again and again to retrieve Constantinople for Christendom and break through the Straits. The Ottomans, although achieving some successes, were not going to be able to resist this. The Empire's status as the \"Sick Man of Europe\" was now becoming quite established. It was Realpolitik that came to the rescue of the Sulṭān: Britain did not want Russia to be too successful and so entered into a long policy of supporting the Turks against the forces, from Russia or Egypt or wherever, that might result in the collapse of Ottoman rule. Nevertheless, Britain could not allow too much oppression of subject Christians, and as the century wore on, small Christian states, from Serbia to Greece to Bulgaria, were allowed autonomy and then independence by the agreement of the Great Powers. This did not get any of them all they wanted, and it certainly limited Russian gains, but it kept the geo-political dam from bursting and kept the Sulṭān from falling off his Throne. When Turkey joined the Central Powers in World War I, however, Britain would have had good reason to regret its policy.\n\nFinally, it was the internal forces of Turkey that began to shake things up after a pattern that would become all too familiar in \"underdeveloped\" countries later: A military coup, the \"Young Turks,\" against the detested Sulṭān ʿAbdül-Hamīd II, known as \"the Damned,\" in 1908. This did not help much when the Balkan states fell on Turkey in the First Balkan War of 1912. The choice of Germany as a European ally would then be fatal for the Ottoman future.\n\nAnother ill effect was the transformation of the Mediaeval Cause of Islām into a more modern Turkish nationalism. This did not work well, and never would, with the Arabs, Armenians, and Kurds living within Turkish borders. The disaffection of the first exploded in a pro-Allied revolt in World War I. Suspicion about the second, with the Russians actively promoting Armenian disaffection (but then often doing little when substantive support was needed), led to shameful deportation and massacre about the same time.\n\nAlthough Turkish actions, even now, are justified in terms of the disloyalty, or suspected disloyalty, of the Armenians, no actions amounting to persecution, deportation, or genocide were launched against the Arabs, many of whom ended up in open revolt, adhering to the Allied cause, although, as we know, there were some executions of Arab nationalists in Damascus and Beirut: which actually helped spark the revolt in the first place.\n\nThe leadership of the Young Turks boiled down to the \"Three Pashas,\" , who came to power in the Coup of 1913. These were Meḥmed Ṭalaʿat (Talaat, Talāt), (1874-1921), Ismaʾil Enver, (1881-1922), and Aḥmed Jemāl (Djemal, Cemal), (1872-1922). These three led Turkey into World War I, engineered the Armenian genocide, were condemned in absentia by Turkish authorities after the War, and then met their deaths soon afterwards. In 1921, Talaat was assassinated in Berlin by an Armenian student, Soghomon Tehlirian (1896-1960). Both British and Russian intelligence had put out a kind of \"contract\" for the killing of Talaat, and Tehlirian may have been acting with their aid and cooperation. Although freely admitting the killing, he was found innocent of murder after a three day trial. Tehlirian is buried under an elaborate monument in Fresno, California.\n\nEnver ended up Russia, where Lenin sent him to help pro-Soviet forces in Bukhara. There he broke with the Soviets and was killed in fighting, evidently by a Soviet force led by an Armenian, Hakob Malkumyan (1885-1962). After the War, Jemāl fled to Afghanistan but then traveled to Georgia to negotiate with the Soviets, where he was assassinated by a three man Armenian team, which, as with Soghomon Tehlirian, was part of \"Operation Nemesis,\" a sort of Armenian death squad that assassinated a number of former Ottoman officials associated with the Armenian genocide. Talaat and Enver are actually buried at the \"Monument of Liberty\" in İstanbul, apparently reflecting their rehabilitation as Turkish nationalists. For some reason, Jemāl is only buried in Erzurum.\n\nOn August 21, 1915, eleven suspected Arab nationalist leaders were hung in the central square of Beirut, oddly called \"Liberty Square\" at the time, now \"Martyrs Square,\" by the Turkish military authorities. On May 6, 1916, the Turks executed twenty-one others, seven in Damascus and fourteen in Beirut. On hearing the news of the latter, Prince Fayṣal, son of the Sharīf Ḥusayn of Mecca, who was visiting near Damascus, is supposed to have thrown down his headress and exclaimed, \"Death has become sweet, Oh Arabs!\" (a literary quotation by Fayṣal that I have not been able to track down either in English or Arabic). Fayṣal returned to Mecca, and the Arab Revolt against the Turks, long in preparation by Fayṣal's father, commenced on the 5th of June.\n\nBut there have been no accusations of Turkish deportations or genocide against the Arabs. Although Woodrow Wilson and the Treaty of Sèvres impotently called for an independent Armenian state, in an area where there were few Armenians left, soon there would be almost none, after Mustafa Kemal pushed the Armenian Republic back east of the Araks (Aras) River in 1920.\n\nNationalistic conflict over the Kurds continues, with campaigns of terrorism and suppression, even today. No Power has ever called for an independent Kurdish state. Atatürk made the word \"Kurd\" and the Kurdish language illegal, and even now Kurdish names for children are prohibited as \"terrorism.\" Kurdish efforts at revolt in Turkey have failed, but a de facto Kurdish state has arisen in Iraq and Syria, and been subject to Turkish attacks, even while Americans are embedded with Kurdish forces, whom the United States has supported. This is part of the geopolitical change by which Turkey has been shifting away from NATO and the West towards Islamism and a Russian alliance.\n\nMeanwhile, after World War I, the British and French were perfectly happy to detach the Arab lands from the Empire, not for independence, to be sure, but to further British and French imperial projects. This turned out to be more trouble than it was worth, especially when the Zionist colonization of Palestine, allowed by the British, led to the creation of Israel and to a conflict, including five major wars (1948, 1956, 1967, 1973, 1982), that continues until today. The settlement of World War I has thus been aptly called \"the peace to end all peace\" -- although much the same dynamic is evident with India and Pakistan, where Muslims were as much in favor of Partition as they were against it in Palestine.\n\nAllied Occupation\n\nHigh Commissioners,\n\n1918-1923 British Admiral Somerset Gouth-Calthorpe1918-1919 Admiral John de Robeck1919-1920 Sir Horace Rumbold1920-1923 French Louis Franchet d'Esperey1918-1919 Albert Defrance1919-1920 Maurice César Joseph Pellé1921-1923 Italian Count Carlo Sforza1918-1919 Marchese Eugenio Camillo Garroni1920-1923 Greek\n\nEfthymios Kanellopoulos1918-1923 Treaty of Lausanne, 24 July 1923; Allied evacuation, 24 August-2 October 1923\n\nThe occupation of Constantinople by the Allies after World War I is a remarkable chapter in its own right. Although all Axis capitals would be occupied after World War II, Constantinople was the only one to have this happen after World War I. It happened in this case for a number of reasons. One was the accessiblity of the City to Allied navies, which made occupation rather convenient. Another was concern about the Straits, lest Russia again be cut off in the Black Sea. And another was pressure from the Greeks, and the Russians, and others, for the actual recovery of Constantinople from the Turks. Indeed, when Allied forces landed in 1918, it was the first time that the Ottomans lost control of the City since Meḥmed II rode in in 1453. There was no other European capital with such overlapping claims, although other cities, like Trieste, Strausbourg, Nice, and Danzig, were the focus of nationalistic disputes.\n\nOccupation authority was vested in a Council of \"High Commissioners,\" from Britain, France, Italy, and Greece, all of whom had territorial interests against the Ottoman Empire. The British seem to have been the senior partners in this, and most directly in military command. They were also the most biased in favor of the Greeks, who were allowed and encouraged to advance into Turkish territories. King Constantine of Greece, who had been deposed as pro-German in 1917, but who had also sometimes styled himself \"Constantine XII\" in succession to the last Roman Emperor, returned to the Throne in 1920 and actually entered Edirne -- Adrianople -- as a liberated city. Many Greeks expected Constantinople to be next, although the Allies did prohibit that.\n\nThe Greeks, and those relying on them, had their chance, and they even thought they could march into the interior of Anatolia from Smyrna. But what they met were the battle-hardened veterans of Gallipoli, commanded by their very commander, the resolute Mustafa Kemal -- who destroyed the Greek Army, captured its general, and entered Smyrna -- İzmir -- on 9 September 1922. The Greek cause collapsed, and the Allies, who had no real interest in restarting a war with Turkey, realized that their position was hopeless. Also, the success of the Russian Revolution meant that Russian interests in the Straits, or in Constantinople, were no longer of concern. The British Government actually fell, ending the career of David Lloyd George.\n\nAn ethnographic map from 1861 shows us that Thrace and the litoral of the Sea of Mamara were predominantly Greek. So the Greeks were justified in occupying Thrace and Adrianople. However, Atatürk, of course, drove them out. The population of Constantinople itself, which was less than half Turkish in 1914, increased to 67% by 1927, 80% by 1950, and is now all but entirely so. Also noteworthy here is that the island of Imbros, now the only Turkish island in the Aegean Sea, was nevertheless entirely Greek. The Turkish population shown on Crete was itself deported after World War I (1923).\n\nThe Sultān, whose position had been compromised, who had not been a free agent under either the Young Turks or the Occupation, and who had already been declared only a Caliph by Kemal (on 1 November 1922), abdicated and went into exile (17 Novembeer 1922). The Treaty of Lausanne, negotiated with Kemal rather than with the Sulṭān, was signed on 24 July 1923, the Allies evacuated by 2 October, and the Turkish Army, which had already infiltrated the City, formally arrived on 6 October. Once again, Constantinople was under Turkish, but no longer Ottoman (after 469 years), control. Indeed, Constantinople, without an Emperor, was no longer \"Tsargrad,\" an Imperial Capital, for the first time in 1592 years. In 1926, the Turkish post office ceased recognizing \"Constantinople\" in addresses, although \"İstanbul\" did not formally become the name until 1930. Ankara had always been the capital for Kemal, become Atatürk -- who, athough he seemed to dislike Constantinople, actually died while living in the Dolmabahçe Palace in 1938.\n\nAs it happens, the Treaty of Lausanne, even with the Russians out of the picture, made the Straits an international waterway. Russian warships have enjoyed free transit, even at the height of the Cold War, with Turkey in NATO. This is about all that remains from the Treaty of Sèvres of restrictions on previous matters of Ottoman sovereignty. Germany should have been so lucky at Versailles.\n\nThe final genealogy of the Ottomans continues down to the living heirs of the dynasty. When Abdül-Mejīd II was deposed in 1924, he had been ruling as the Caliph, not as Ottoman Sultan; and both he and the entire family were expelled from Turkey. Male members of the family were not allowed back until 1973 (the women in 1951). I have identified Abdül-Mejīd II with the icon for a Pretender to the Throne (unspide crown), but numbered \"0\" since he had, after a fashion, occupied the Throne. After him the Heads of the House of Osman are numbered in sequence, to the current Head, Dündar Ali-Osman (#8), and after him the Heirs in order of precedence. When one of those dies, the succession will need to be renumbered. Recent heirs have some traditionally Ottoman names, but we see that others are now \"Eric,\" \"Roland,\" \"Daniel,\" etc.\n\nEveryone in the male line can use the surname \"Osmanoğlu,\" \"Son of Osman,\" although this is shown, perhaps gratiutiously, for only a few of the people in the diagram. Also, sons of actual Sultans can bear the title Şehzade, (Persian Šāhzāde, Hindi Šāhzāda, ), \"Son of the King,\" with the Persian patronymic ending. There are some modifications in these names, as above, from modern Turkish orthography. Thus, since Cem is pronounced \"Jem,\" that is how it is written here.\n\nThe upper part of the diagram has some female members of the family, but these disappear further down because, by House Law, there are no women (or non-Muslims) in the Succession, the purpose is to show the heirs in the order of Succession, and the diagram is already crowded enough. Indeed, it is a bewildering tangle. It ends up showing Ömer Hilmi, the son of Mehmed V, twice -- above (1) to show the marriage of one of his daughters, below (2) for the line of succession (the two occurrences are connected by a red line). Consequently, a larger, simplified, and untangled genealogy can be accessed in a popup. The popup diagram attempts to show the same generations on the same horizontal span, and it avoids lines crossing each other. There is only one (Shehzade) Ömer Hilmi. From this it is more easily determined that the Succession relies on date of birth, which tends to go from brother to brother to cousin in the same generation, but not always.\n\nAfter the modern history of \"ethnic cleansing\" through massacre and deportation, it is now extraordinary and even jarring to recollect the ethnic patchwork of Ottoman Turkey, which was formalized in the \"Millet,\" (Arabic millah, \"religious community; religion, creed, faith, confession, denomination\"), system of government, which afforded to the confessional communities degrees of self-government. One might walk down streets in early 20th century Istanbul and see nothing but signs in Greek and Armenian.\n\nA study of the Ottoman Empire, for example, found that \"of the 40 private bankers listed in Istanbul in 1912 not one bore a Muslim name.\" Nor was even one of the 34 stockbrokers in Istanbul a Turk. Of the capital assets of the 284 industrial firms employing five or more workers, 50 percent were owned by Greeks and another 20 percent by Armenians. In the seventeenth century Ottoman Empire, the palace medical staff consisted of 41 Jews and 21 Muslims. [Thomas Sowell, Intellectuals and Society, Basic Books, 2011, pp.117-188]\n\nThis was a world now long gone and in retrospect almost inconceivable. Equally striking is that the Christian community under the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople was the Millet-ı-Rūm, , the \"community of Rome,\" retaining the identity of Mediaeval Romania, Ῥωμανία. Although this is often now said to be the \"Greek\" community, it initially included all Orthodox Christians under the authority of the Patriarch and even into the 20th century retained its identity as Rhômaioi, \"Romans.\" Other Patriarchates might correspond to other Millets, such as the Bulgarians, Serbs, Romanians, and others. The Ottomans even sponsored the establishment of an Armenian Patriarchate in Constantinople in 1461, so as to distinguish the local Armenian community from the \"Romans.\"\n\nBut \"Rome,\" of course, was more than a Christian community. The Ottoman Sulṭān himself was the Qaisar-ı-Rūm, , the \"Caesar of Rome.\" This should remind us of George of Trebizond (1395-1472/73) telling Meḥmed II the Conqueror, \"Therefore you are the legitimate Emperor of the Romans... And he who is and remains Emperor of the Romans is also Emperor of the whole earth.\"\n\nThe great , Topkapı Palace (Sarayı, \"its palace\") occupies an area that was originally the acropolis of Byzantium. Constantine curiously left this site alone, perhaps out of persistent respect, or fear, for the old gods. I am only aware of one Mediaeval institution in the area, the Church and Monastery of St. George of Mangana. The circuit wall of the Topkapı grounds essentially encompasses all of ancient Byzantium.\n\nThe original Imperial Palace of the Emperors of Mediaeval Romania, the Great Palace, Μέγα Παλάτιον (Méga Palátion), entered by the Χαλκῆ, Chalke or Brazen Gate, from the square of the Augustaeum [or Augusteum, in Greek Αὐγουσταῖον, Augustaion or, often, Augusteion], was south of the Church of Hagia Sophia, down through the area of the present Sultan Aḥmad Mosque -- adjacent to the Hippodrome, where the Emperor's box was connected to the Palace -- all the way to the Sea of Marmara. Some excavation has uncovered floors and substructures in the Great Palace, which consisted of a number of buildings and so could even be construed as consisting of multiple palaces. One of those, with its own harbor on the Sea of Marmara, was the Βουκολέων, Bucoleon [Boukoleôn], Palace, which sometimes gives its name to the whole of the Great Palace.\n\nThe Great Palace was left in such disrepair by the Latins that the Palaeologi abandoned it for residence in the Βλαχέρναι, Blachernae Palace by the City walls. When Meḥmed II arrived, he is supposed to have wandered through the empty and ruined palace and quoted from Firdawsī:\n\nThe spider spins his web in the Palace of the Caesars,\n\nAn owl hoots in the towers of Afrasiyab [a Turanian king in the Shāh-nāma].\n\n\"Topkapı,\" , means the \"Gate of the Cannon,\" literally the \"Cannon [ , Top], its [ or , ı] Gate [ , Kapı].\" The actual gate of that name was the principle gate in the sea-wall of the Palace, flanked, indeed, by cannons; but today it no longer exists (though there still is such a gate in the Land Walls). More significant was a gate that didn't even belong to the palace but is across the street: the Bāb-ı-ʿAli, or the \"Sublime Porte,\" through which one entered the palace of the Grand Vezir ( , Wazīr in Arabic, the Prime Minister).\n\nDolmabahçe, Dolmabağçe: dolma, \"filled, landfill,\" bahçe, bağ, \"garden,\" Persian bāγ -- çe, lookks like a suffix, and ç is a suffix, but I don't see how that would work here -- the site was a garden created by landfill.\n\nThis gate and its name came to represent the entire Ottoman Government. Thus, as today people speak of the \"White House\" for American government, or \"Downing Street\" for the British -- which hearken back to the King of Egypt being called \"Pharaoh,\" , the \"Great House,\" or the Emperor of Japan the \"Mikado,\" , which simply means, in the closest parallel to Ottoman practice, the \"Honorable Gate\" -- the Ottoman government could simply be called \"the Porte.\" The name of the gate is a classic Ottoman expression using Arabic words in a Persian grammatical construction --\n\n, the Bāb, \"gate,\" -ı- (\"of,\" with Turkish vowel harmony, see below), ʿĀlī, \"lofty, exalted, sublime; excellent, outstanding, etc.\" (in Arabic this is just , ʿāl in the indefinite, and is still used in spoken Arabic just to mean \"wonderful\" or \"wow!\"). Just as the last of the Roman Emperors moved to the Blachernae Palace, the last Ottoman Sulṭāns preferred the Dolmabahçe Palace on the Bosporus, where above we see Kaiser Wilhelm II (in the gray overcoat) on his visit.\n\nToday one of the sights of Istanbul is the , Fatih Camii, the \"Conqueror's Mosque\"(Fātiḥ Jāmi-i, the \"conqueror,\" \"his mosque,\" in the Turkish grammatical construction). This contains the tomb of Meḥmed II, with a dedicated mosque, school, hospice, and (formerly) caravansaray. It stands on the site of the Church of the Holy Apostles, which contained the Heroön, τὸ Ἡρῷον, the mausoleum of Constantine I and most subsequent Emperors of Romania (space for tombs was exhausted in 1028 with the burial of Constantine VIII -- perhaps a bad omen).\n\nAlready in ruinous disrepair in 1453 (though the seat of the Patriarch of Constantinople, 1453-1455), it is not clear what the fate of all the Imperial burials was. Tombs that were above ground are certainly gone, and some anonymous sarcophagi survive at the Istanbul Archaeological Museum. The bases of some of the original walls of the Church, however, have been identified; and I wonder if burials below ground or in a crypt may actually have simply been covered over by the later construction, the way the Imperial mosaics in Sancta Sophia were simply whitewashed, preserving them for modern display [note].\n\nA great deal of Roman Constantinople actually survives underground and invisible in modern Istanbul. What the Church of the Holy Apostles probably looked like can still be seen in a probable copy, St. Mark's in Venice.\n\nThe spelling of the names of the Ottomans on this page is intended to indicate both the Turkish pronunciation and how they are spelled in Arabic. In practical terms this no longer matters, since Turkish is no longer written in the Arabic alphabet, but it is of historical interest. In fact, it may be illegal to write Turkish in the Arabic alphabet. I once heard that it was a felony to staple pages together at the upper right rather than the upper left corner. I have no confirmation of this.\n\nHere I have pretty much followed the usage of The Cambridge History of Islam [Volume 1B, The Central Islamic Lands Since 1918, Cambridge University Press, 1970, 1977, p.734]. A good example is the name of the Conqueror of Constantinople, Meḥmed II. This name is Muḥammad in Arabic but is actually pronounced Me[h]met in Turkish -- which is an Altaic language that is entirely unrelated to Arabic. Some dispute the reality of the Ural-Altaic family, or even the Altaic family, or whether Korean and Japanese are Altaic members. We don't need to worry about that.\n\nObviously, some compromises are made and the system is not perfect. In general, the consonants look Arabic and the vowels Turkish. Since Turkish (following Persian) reads the Arabic alphabet with three s's (Arabic s, ṣ, and θ) and four z's (Arabic z, ẓ, ḍ, and ð), some attempt is made to differentiate (e.g. with s for θ). Modern Turkish writes c for English j and ç for English ch, but the English equivalents are used here, since most people will be completely unfamiliar with the conventions of Turkish orthography, whose peculiarities many books do not bother to explain.\n\nThe main reason that Arabic writing did not work well for Turkish was the Turkish vowel system. Where Classical Arabic had three short and three long vowels, and Persian could match its six vowels with those, Turkish has eight vowels, as shown below left (in the official Romanization).\n\nThe most intriguing thing about Turkish vowels is the system of vowel harmony. Related Ural-Altaic languages, like Mongolian and even Hungarian, also have vowel harmony, but this seems to appear in Turkish in its most complete, logical, and elegant form. The undotted \"i\" (\"ı\"), with the dotted capital \"I\" (\"İ\"), are distinctive.\n\nThe rules are simply, (1) front vowels are followed by front vowels (e.g. i by e), back vowels by back vowels (e.g. u by a), (2) unrounded vowels are followed by unrounded vowels (e.g. i by e), and (3) rounded vowels are followed by high rounded (e.g. o by u) or low unrounded vowels (e.g. o by a) [note].\n\nThere are Turkish grammatical inflections in which the vowel is supposed to be simply either high or low, with its character otherwise determined by the preceding vowels in the word -- thus, the common third person possessive suffix, which may appear as i, ı, u, or ü, is typically written as \"y,\" ى, or \"w,\" و, with its character otherwise determined by the earlier vowels. Specific vowels were all impossible to show in the Arabic alphabet without a special notation that might have been developed but, evidently, never was. This left Turkish orthography woefully inadequate to Turkish phonology.\n\nTurkish grammar as six noun cases. Since Turkish is an \"agglutinative\" language, there are distinct suffixes for the cases (except for the nominative) and the root of the noun is not modified, as it would be in Greek or Latin. The table at right displays the suffixes, as modified by vowel harmony, and the Arabic letters that (ambiguously) wrote them. The \"rounded\" vowels are all high, because the corresponding low vowels, /o/ and /ö/, are precluded by vowel harmony.\n\nOttoman Case Suffixes CasesArabicFrontBack HighLowRoundedHighLowRounded Nominative\n\nor Absolute- Genitiveڭ-(n)iŋ--(n)üŋ-(n)ıŋ--(n)uŋ Dativeه--(y)eh---(y)ah- Accusativeو/ى-(y)i--(y)ü-(y)ı--(y)u Locativeده--deh---dah- Ablativeدن--den---dan-\n\nIn the forms given with final /h/, this is not pronounced, but I write it because the letter is used in the Arabic writing.\n\nThe table is based on The Routledge Introduction to Literary Ottoman, by Korkut Buğday [Routledge, 2009, translated by Jerold C. Frankes from German Osmanisch-Lehrbuch, Einführung in die Grundlagen der Literatursprache, Weisbaden, 1999]. The letters in parentheses are used where the noun ends in a vowel [cf. G.L. Lewis, Teach Yourself Turkish, 1953, 1975, p.29]. The Accusative case is only used for definite objects. Indefinite objects are \"Absolute\" and without suffix [cf. Lewis, p.27]. This is a version of what we see in \"Ergative\" languages, where the object of intransitive verbs is in the same case as the subject of transitive verbs.\n\nBuğday says something that strikes me as odd, that /ü/ and /u/ do not occur in the Accusative case in Ottoman, as they do in Modern, Turkish [p.16]. However, if we are required to write only /i/ and /ı/, this would often violate vowel harmony. Rounded vowels must be followed by high rounded, or low unrounded, vowels. If the Accusative suffix requires a high vowel, then often only the rounded vowels will be allowed.\n\nBuğday also seems to rule out /ü/ & /u/ in the 3rd person possessive pronoun [p.17], which is also a suffix, and is used for what Buğday calls the \"generic genitive construction\" [p.39], what Lewis calls the construction of the \"Qualifying Relationship\" [p.39], whose examples begin with Çar&scedil;amba gün-ü \"Wednesday, its-day,\" (Persian چَهَارشَنْبِه, Čahāršanbeh, \"Wednesday\"), where we see vowel harmony enforced (gün-ü, گونو, or گونى, \"its day\"). This \"Qualifying Relationship\" is common in Turkish, as we have seen above in the name of the Topkapı palace.\n\nNow, Turkish has foreign words that violate vowel harmony; but I would be astonished if the ordinary functioning of Turkish grammar, even in the Ottoman period, required such a violation. Since Turkish written in Arabic usually doesn't give us a clue about the pronunciation of the vowels, I would wonder how much evidence there actually is for what Buğday says.\n\nThere are many words in Turkish that violate vowel harmony, but by this they can be identified as foreign loan words -- for example İslām (instead of *İslem), from Arabic, and İstanbul (instead of *İstenbil), from Greek or Arabic. Arabic Turkiyā, , although retaining its Arabic spelling in Ottoman Turkish, nevertheless came to be pronounced with the proper vowel harmonic \"e\" in the final position, as Türkiye. However, the medial \"i\" violates vowel harmony. The word properly should be *Türküye -- with the high rounded \"ü\" followed by a high rounded \"ü\" -- or *Türkeye -- with the high rounded vowel followed by the low unrounded \"e.\"\n\nThe phonology of Modern Turkish has simplified somewhat from Classical Ottoman Turkish. Unlike Persian or Urdu, Turkish only needed to introduce one extra letter to write a sound that did not exist in Persian or Arabic. This was for the velar nasal, \"ng\" (\"ŋ\"), as in words like dengiz (deŋiz), , \"sea,\" or yalngız (yalŋız), , \"alone.\" However, this sound has now been lost, and the modern pronunciation of \"sea\" is just deniz and of \"alone\" yalnız.\n\nOf equal interest is the loss in Turkish of velar fricatives, such as \"gh\" (γ) and \"kh\" (χ). We often see the Arabic letters for \"gh\" and \"q\" (for which \"gh\" and \"kh\" were allophones) in Turkish words that are not of Persian or Arabic origin. Examples of this are the words for \"son,\" , oghul; \"mountain,\" , dagh; \"white,\" , aq; and \"black,\" , qara. Indeed, we can put together expressions that feature more than one obsolete sound: , the Aq Deŋiz, or \"White Sea,\" i.e. the Mediterranean; and , the Qara Dagh, or \"Black Mountain,\" i.e. Montenegro. Today, the \"q\" has become a \"k,\" while the \"gh\" has become the \"ğ,\" a \"g\" with a breve. This gives us ak and kara, oğul and dağ -- as in Ak Deniz and Kara Dağ.\n\nThis \"ğ\" is a notable letter in its own right. In other languages of the Mediterranean, like Italian and French, the letter \"g\" has been often reduced or become silent. In the names of the French physicist Louis de Broglie and the Italian-American art historian Camille Paglia, the \"g\" is silent in each name, often to the confusion of Americans. The gamma (γ) in Modern Greek is often no more than a \"y,\" as in Γιάννης, Yannis, \"John.\" The \"g\" in English is palatalized into a \"j\" before front vowels (\"George,\" \"gem\" as opposed to \"go\"). Atatürk's spelling favors us with \"ğ\" to show where a \"g\" is reduced or silent.\n\nTurkish\n\nNumbers one two three four five six seven eight nine ten\n\nAt the end of a word or before a consonant, \"ğ\" lengthens the preceding vowel, as where , dagh, becomes dağ. Between vowels, \"ğ\" becomes a glide: \"y\" between front vowels, \"w\" between back vowels. However, the first vowel may be lengthened and the second all but lost. The name of the present, dictatorial President of Turkey, Mr. Erdoğan, is usually pronounced in the news as \"Erdowan.\" Close enough.\n\nThis phenomenon of the velar fricatives being lost to the reduced \"ğ\" was already well underway in Ottoman Turkish; and we also already see it in a word like the title \"bey,\" , beğ, where the letter \"k\" was written for \"ğ.\" I have no idea how long it has been since the \"k\" was actually pronounced that way, if ever.\n\nA notable case is the name of the Seljuk Great Sulṭān Ṭughril Beg. I see this written at Wikipedia as (without the vowels), which would be read in Persian as Toghrelbek. However, the bek always seems to be read beg, which would be written more like . In Modern Turkish, we seem to get Tuğrul Beğ, where, of course, \"gh,\" \"g,\" and/or \"k\" have all become \"ğ.\" There is uncertainty about the origin of beg. Suggestions are that it comes from a Persian cognate to , bhaga, \"lord,\" in Sanskrit or even from a Chinese word that ultimately becomes the feudal rank , which was paek in Middle Chinese [A Student's Dictionary of Classical and Medieval Chinese, Paul W. Kroll, Brill, 2017, p.26].\n\nAll the lost phonology of Turkish was completely lost with the shift from the Arabic to the Latin alphabet. Unlike English, Turkish no longer contains, to the confusion of young spellers, evidence of earlier stages of the language.\n\nWe see special Turkish and Persian consonants in the name of the famous corps of \"Janissaries,\" , the Yeŋiçeri or \"new soldiers.\" Since this is unpronounceable in Arabic, the Arabic version is , Inkisharī, where the now lost Turkish nasal is replaced with \"nk\" and \"ç\" with \"sh,\" with some alteration in the vowels also.\n\nTwo terms of Turkish or at least Altaic origin, with obsolete phonology, are now more recognizable in unrelated languages than in Turkish. These are the titles , agha, and , khan. Agha is now used as \"Mr.\" in Persian. Khān is very familiar as a Turkish or Mongolian title in the Middle Ages (or as a beloved villain in Star Trek -- although he bears the characteristic Sikh surname \"Singh\"). The latter seems to be a variant, root, or derivative of khaghan, which is seen in Persian as , khāqān (the medial \"q\" is pronounced as \"gh\"). In Modern Turkish, with the loss of the velar fricatives, agha, just to mean \"master, gentleman,\" is reduced to ağa, and khan to han -- although kağan (as from qaghan) is also seen as a surname. In Modern Mongolian, agha, meaning \"elder brother,\" has been reduced to akh. The loss of intervocalic \"g\" is also something we evidently see in Mongolian, where khaan looks like a reduction of khaghan. For the purposes here, these titles simply futher illustrate the recent phonetic simplification of Turkish.\n\nBooks that we might expect to take some care using and explaining words in Ottoman Turkish that have changed since, because the account is about the Ottoman period, often do not do so. Thus, Istanbul, A Tale of Three Cities, by Bettany Hughes [Da Capo Press, 2017], and Constantinople, City of the World's Desire, 1453-1924, by Philip Mansel [John Murray, London, 1995], simply use Modern Turkish spelling and ignore the differences that existed in Ottoman Turkish. Mansel's case is worse, since he doesn't even use Turkish diacritics, leaving us with mysterious words that even Turks, unfamiliar with the history, would often not know how to pronounce. But scholarly mistreatment of language is nothing unusual.\n\nArabic Transcription Issues\n\nIn the first book I had about Turkish, Teach Yourself Books, Turkish [St. Paul's House, Warwick Lane, London, 1953, 1975], the author, G.L. Lewis, specifically ridicules Hagopian's Ottoman-Turkish Conversation- Grammar of 1907 [Julius Gross, Heidelberg] because, out of 215 pages, it devoted 161 to Arabic and Persian [p.vi]. Well, years ago, I found Hagopian's book in the UCLA Research Library (now available in a very clear reproduction by Forgotten Books, London, 2018). It is a very fine book. The section on Arabic and Persian is very much as though every English grammar book came along with Donald M. Ayers' English words from Latin and Greek elements [University of Arizona Press, 1986], which I encountered as the textbook for a popular class at the University of Texas on the Greek and Latin words in English.\n\nPersian\n\nNumbers one two three four five six seven eight nine ten\n\nAs it happens, of course, fewer and fewer American students are even taught English grammar, much less enough Greek or Latin to understand or appreciate its use of them. This is not a virtue. Nor is the nationalistic enthusiasm that seeks to purge languages of \"foreign\" words, which has happened in Turkish, German, French, Hungarian, and elsewhere. This kind of thing is simply an attempt to purge history itself -- along with a ugly attempt to sharpen ethnic identities and differences.\n\nHagopian's attention to Arabic and Persian was very much like the arrangement of the much later, modern Persian Grammar of A.K.S. Lambton [Cambridge University Press, 1953, 1967]. Part I of the book (pp.3-177) is the Persian grammar proper, while Part II (pp.181-245) is \"The Arabic Element.\" Similarly, it would be difficult to be fully educated in Japanese without considerable attention to the Chinese source of Japanese characters and the Chinese literary and religious antecedents of much of Japanese culture.\n\nG.L. Lewis applied the false paradigm derived from the recent history of European languages, which now seriously neglect the Classical roots of their own languages, literature, and civilization -- so seek to eliminate it.\n\nIn tribute to Hagopian, I provide the names of the first ten numbers in Persian at right. As it happens, combinations of Turkish and Persian names for the numbers are traditionally used in backgammon in the Middle East, with the name of the game itself occurring as \"Shesh-Besh,\" (right to left), i.e. \"Six & Five,\" in Persian and Turkish, respectively. Hagopian, among his many useful details, actually gives the names used for all the combinations of dice. These are now not generally remembered, and game is often called \"Trick-Track\" after the sound of the pieces on a wooden board [note].\n\nLater, Geoffrey Lewis appears to have thought better of his ridicule. Subsequent editions of Teach Yourself Turkish cut down on the dismissive remarks; and recently Lewis has published The Turkish Language Reform, A Catastrophic Success [Oxford, 1999, 2002]. Here we learn about the artificial coinages, supposedly \"true\" Turkish, and the confusion that has now alienated modern Turkey from its own heritage, the best of Ottoman literature. Indeed, the writings of Kemal Atatürk himself have needed more than once to be \"translated\" into New(er) Turkish. At a literary or technical level usage still sometimes shifts between an Arabic word (e.g. , maktab, \"place for writing,\" i.e. \"school\"), a \"Turkish\" neologism (okul), or French (école), just to make sure that everyone can recognize one of the words. Lewis's own Turkish Grammar [Oxford, 1967, 2000] provides information to enable people to read the Ottoman language. It probably is too late to deliberately go back, but, like German returning to Telefon from Fernsprecher, perhaps Turkish usage will drift back to more of its Persian and Arabic heritage. This need have nothing to do with Islamicization, merely with remembering the history of the language.\n\nCurious things now can get said about the Ottoman Empire, for instance in the \"Author's Note\" to Lawrence in Arabia -- War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East [Anchor Books, 2013, 2014], by Scott Anderson:\n\nIn war, language itself often becomes a weapon, and that was certainly true in the Middle Eastern theater of World War I. For example, while the Allied powers tended to use \"the Ottoman Empire\" and \"Turkey\" interchangeably, they displayed a marked preference for the latter designation as the war went on, undoubtedly to help fortify the notion that the non-Turkish populations of the Ottoman Empire were somehow[?] \"captive peoples\" in need of liberation [like Armenians?]... On a more subtle level, all the Western powers, including the Ottoman Empire's/Turkey's chief ally in the war, Germany, continued to refer to the city of \"Constantinople\" (its name under a Christian empire overthrown by the Muslim Ottomans in 1453) rather than the locally preferred \"Istanbul.\"\n\nAs many Middle East historians rightly point out, the use of these Western-preferred labels -- Turkey rather than the Ottoman Empire, Constantinople instead of Istanbul -- is indicative of a Eurocentric perspective that, in its most pernicious form, serves to validate the European (read imperialist) view of history. [p.ix]\n\nThere is something odd about \"rightly\" standing up for the identity of the Ottoman Empire as an Empire, to the point of defending its rule of conquered peoples and the change of the name of its conquered capital, and yet present it as a victim of \"imperialism.\" If the Ottoman regime was not itself \"imperialism,\" then we have the use of a novel principle that only Europeans have empires or imperial ideology (an ideology of conquest, like Islamic Jihād) -- even though we have decided that \"Empire\" is the only non-Eurocentric thing to call the Ottoman state.\n\nAmid this confusion are some historical falsehoods. There was nothing \"Western-preferred\" about the \"labels\" in question. \"Turkey\" had been used for Turkish states for many centuries, with what now seems like the bizarre inclusion of Hungary in that number, to the point that the Crown of St. Stephen says Τουρκία (Tourkía) on it. There was no other proper name to use for the Ottoman Empire. At the same time, \"Istanbul\" was not the official name of Constantinople until 1930. It may have been \"locally preferred\" only in the same sense that people in Philadelphia may say \"Philly,\" and San Franciscans used to say \"Frisco,\" for their cities. Neither of these cases have much to do with Eurocentrism, imperialism, or any sort of ideological manipulation of language. Greeks said Stamboul without the slightest sense that this should replace the full, formal name. \"Constantinople\" was named after its founder, the Emperor Constantine I, and Mr. Anderson's \"a Christian empire\" was the Byzantine Empire, or Romania, which for some reason Anderson deigns not to name (showing the Latin bias of Western/Frankish historiography): What kind of \"centrism\" is that? We might easily see it as a manifestation of the hatred of Christianity so common in American elite culture and academia -- which is what it is that excuses all the racism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism in Friedrich Nietzsche just because he despised Christianity.\n\nThus, saying that \"many Middle East historians rightly point out\" these distortions itself betrays a bias on the part of Mr. Anderson, which is for him to be taken in by a Marxist-Leninist discourse on \"imperialism\" and all the illiberal and often totalitarian principles that go with it. But then, having begun with such a harsh condemnation of \"Eurocentrism\" on these grounds, Anderson walks it back on the next page, admitting that the Turks themselves often used the names \"Turkey\" and \"Constantinople,\" and that the Young Turks didn't like using the word \"Ottoman\" at all -- they were \"de-Ottomanizing\" Turkey. So Mr. Anderson himself will use \"Turkey,\" \"Ottoman Empire,\" and \"Constantinople\" in the book. So the whole exercise was \"rightly\" all \"a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing\" [Macbeth, Act 5, Scene 5]. All of Anderson's objections are bogus, and he admits as much himself. Perhaps he counts on his \"progressive\" friends reading the first page of the book and not continuing on to the second.\n\nThe issue of proper names, like \"Turkey,\" as opposed to other descriptions, like \"Ottoman Empire,\" significantly comes up in relation to the Roman Empire.\n\nRome and Romania\n\nÖküz saraya çıkınca kral olmaz, ama saray ahır olur.\n\nWhen the ox climbs to the palace, he does not become a king,\n\nbut the palace becomes a barn.\n\nTurkish journalist Sedef Kabaş, quoting proverb. Kabaş was arrested early Saturday morning, 22 January 2022, for insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. She was taken to Istanbuls main police station. A court ruled she, as a public danger, be jailed pending trial.\n\nThus Turkey again insults human rights and sinks further into dictatorship. Yet the United States also holds January 6 protesters (while releasing violent criminals) without bail, delaying trials, while \"public defenders\" help coerce guilty pleas out of them. So we all sink into dictatorship.\n\nOn 11 March 2022, a Court found Kabaş, somehow, both innocent and guilty of insulting the President, and then released her with a suspended sentence.\n\nThe word here for \"king,\" kral, is similar to the words for \"king\" all over Eastern Europe, for instance, král in Czech.\n\nTurkish Republic, 1923;\n\nPresidents Mustafa Kemal,\n\n(1934) Atatürk1923-1938 Ismet Inönü1938-1950 France cedes\n\nAlexandretta & Antioch, 1939 Celal Bayar1950-1960 Riots in İstanbul, the \"İstanbul Pogrom,\" Christians, Armenians, Jews, attacked & killed, churches & cemeteries desecrated, businesses looted, 100,000 Greeks flee, 6 September 1955; 50,000 Greeks deported, 1958 Kemal Gürcel1961-1966 Cevdet Sunay1966-1973 Fahri Korutürk1973-1980 Kenan Evren1980-1989 Turgut Özal1989-1993 Süleyman Demirel1993-2000 Ahmet Necdet Sezer2000-2007 Abdullah Gül2007-2014 Recep Tayyip\n\nErdoğan2014-present\n\nThe job of complete social transformation and \"de-Ottomanizing\" of Turkey was finally undertaken by Muṣṭafā Kemal, who (modestly) adopted the surname Atatürk, \"Father of the Turks\" (1881-1938). Kemal had achieved fame during World War I with his epic defense of Gallipoli against the British, telling his men at one point, \"I am not asking you to fight; I am asking you to die.\"\n\nWith no concessions to Greeks, Armenians, or Kurds, Atatürk nevertheless abandoned most imperial aspirations. Giving up the Arabic alphabet and traditional costume (indeed, making their use even a capital offense), deposing the Ottomans, and otherwise trying to make Turkey a European, rather than a Middle Eastern, state, Atatürk simply hoped to make it the equal of other modern powers. To a considerable extent he succeeded, though Turkey is still haunted by the shadow of the military dictatorship that he himself represented, by the threat of militant Islām, whose mediaevalism is fully triumphant in neighboring Irān, and by the disaffection of the Kurds, whose very existence was legally denied for many years. Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly the strongest state in the region, to the chagrin of neighboring Arabs and Christians (and Kurds) alike.\n\nLong a member of NATO, Turkey was looking forward to membership in the European Community, but has little embarrassments like the common use of torture by police, the largest number of journalists in prison, and increasing inclination towards anti-Western Islamicization. Thus, despite Atatürk, we still have several respects in which Turkey is posed between East and West, Mediaeval and Modern, Islām and secularism, liberalism and oppression. The application of Turkey to the European Union was deferred, to be reconsidered in a few years, but now probably suspended indefinitely. Atatürk himself is still the focus of a curious cult of personality, with his image (as photographs, busts, etc.) appearing almost everywhere, even in elevators. Since this does not symbolize the presence of a totalitarian police state, as it would in North Korea, it instead seems to reflect a healthy and popular endorsement of Atatürk's vision of a secular Turkey. In the face of the Islāmic backlash, it is as positive a statement as it has ever been.\n\nThe term of Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer ended on 16 May 2007, but a new President was not elected until August. The most likely candidate and eventual President, Abdullah Gül, from an Islamic Party (and with a wife who wears a headscarf), drew wide protest (as shown) from everyone who wished to preserve the secular nature of the Turkish Republic. There was even a warning from the Army, which has deposed the government four times since 1960, that it may not tolerate any compromise to Atatürk's ideal of secular government. The Islamic threat would seem to justify the reluctance of the European Union to expedite the admission of Turkey, an attitude that some Turks regard as simple racism. However, the defeat of the Islamic forces in Turkey should remove some European reservations. The actual election of Gül leaves all these issues rather up in the air. There is no doubt, however, that any moves toward Islamicization could provoke even a violent response from the secular population and the Army.\n\nIn March 2008 the Chief Prosecutor of Turkey's Constitutional Court filed a motion to abolish the political party of President Gül, the AK Party, and for a time ban members, like him, from serving in political office. The basis of this is the religious basis and program of the Party. At this point there are also other, equally troubling, complaints about the behavior of the government. If the Court abolishes the party, which seems quite possible, it would forestall a coup by the Army but could also precipitate violence by supporters, who won 46.6% of the vote in 2007. This is certainly the modern dilemma in Islamic countries, where democracy itself threatens the state with the forces of religious reaction. Where in Irān religious government was at first popular, opposition candidates are now kept off the ballot and it is too late for a peaceful return to secular government. In Turkey, however, Atatürk still has more influence than any living Shāh.\n\nOn July 30, 2008, the Constitutional Court fined the AK Party but did not disband it. Six out of eleven judges favored banning the Party, but seven votes were required. There was relief in many circles that a crisis had been avoided and that a democratic election had not been overturned, but the conflict over the place of ʾIslām in Turkey will continue.\n\nThe judges may live to regret their decision. Getting into 2010, the government has been using the police, much as Hitler did after assuming power, to suppress dissent, harass opposition, and even to arrest secularists in the judiciary and military. The Islamist and fascist program of Mr. Gül, or, more like it, Mr. Erdoğan, thus began to emerge. A document was forged that was purported to be Army plans for a coup. Hopefully, the Army will need no such plan, unless, like the German military, they let their chance slip by or, worse, collaborate with the goals of the government. Western observers are hoping that the AK Party will simply lose the next election; but by then, the election may be rigged (as in 2009 in Iran), or Turkish opinion may not be aroused enough about what is going on.\n\nOn 31 May 2010, Israeli forces prevented a flottila of ships from breaching an Israeli blockade of Gaza and delivering goods to the forces of Hamas. They at first tried boarding the ships peacefully, but the crews of the ships began to beat the unarmed Israeli soldiers and throw them overboard. The Israelis then boarded in force, killing a number of those resisting. Since the ships were supposedly delivering humanitarian aid and food to Gaza, there was a great deal of international huffing and puffing and posturing about this action. However, Israel allows humanitarian aid and food into Gaza, if properly inspected; and the purpose of the flottila was clearly to break the blockade so that arms could then be run in to the forces of Hamas. The experience of the past, since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, is that Hamas begins using weapons against Israel as soon as it can get them, despite the military senselessness of such attacks. Hamas forces, hiding, as Terrorists do, among civilians, and attacking, as Terrorists do, Israeli civilians, use Israeli retaliation to claim that Israel is attacking civilians, like Terrorists! This is usually good enough for those ready to credit anti-Israeli propaganda in the first place.\n\nThe most shocking thing about the flotilla event, however, was the support of the project, not just by Iran, which was to be expected, but by Turkey. It now appears that the regime of President Abdullah Gül, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and their AK Party is not just moderately Islamic but has the goal of an Islamist transformation of Turkey, politically, culturally, and diplomatically. Slowly but steadily, Erdoğan has managed to place supporters in the courts, the police, the schools, and, apparently, even in the army. The disturbing developments noted above for early 2010 have now bloomed into a full scale attack on the secular state of Kemal Atatürk. Although Erdoğan himself pursued membership in the European Union, Turkey has now turned its diplomacy towards Iran and other radical regimes. The doubts about EU membership for Turkey, which had delayed its acceptance, now must become a certainty that Turkey is no longer interested in continuing its development as a European nation.\n\nAs we see from the quote above, Erdoğan has no more respect for democracy than any other Islamist. More distressing, however, is the possibility, not that Erdoğan will steal the next election, but that he will be continued in power with large and enthusiastic majorities. For, as it seems, Turkish public opinion, no doubt influenced by what is now a Government controlled news media (which runs grotesque anti-Semitic and anti-American \"documentaries\"), but apparently in little need of such propaganda, has drifted into the Islamist irrationality, paranoia, anti-Semitism, and anti-Americanism that is all too familiar from the rest of the Middle East.\n\nThus, unless there is enough loyalty to Atatürk left in the army, or among the demonstrators we saw as recently as 2007, it appears that Turkey is all but lost in a creeping anti-Western revolution, which is probably as popular among the urban young as it is among what could be expected to be more religiously conservative elements of the society. This poses a serious problem for the United States, since Turkey is a member of NATO and thus has access to American military technology and secrets. If these come to be passed on to Iran or Hamas, continued Turkish NATO membership will not be tolerable. The full threat that these developments in Turkey represent has not yet been fully appreciated in Washington, but the day of reckoning cannot be far away.\n\nDemocracy is like a streetcar. When you come to your stop, you get off.\n\nRecep Tayyip Erdoğan, Prime Minister (now President) of Turkey\n\nIn 2013, nation-wide protests erupted against Prime Minister Erdoğan. As previously, women in Western dress figure prominently in the protests, exemplifying their concern at the Islamicization of the regime. This has come down to one incident, where a solitary woman in a red dress, identified as Ceyda Sungur, \"the woman in red,\" was pepper-sprayed by a policeman in riot gear, as we see in the now famous Reuters image at right. The policeman obviously had nothing to fear from her. Things have indeed been getting out hand. Erdoğan has been suppressing opposition newspapers, and more journalists are in jail than anywhere else in the world (in countries where there are journalists, of course, unlike Cuba or North Korea). While Erdoğan's strength previously was his competent direction of the economy, it looks like this might not last, and his other sins may be catching up with him. However, as noted above, Erodogan may have already compromised the independence of the military and the judiciary enough that he can suppress any opposition. We shall see. The Western press is paying a bit more attention to this than to attacks on Christians in Egypt.\n\nUnfortunately, the protests didn't make much difference, and an attempted coup by the Army in 2016 came way too late and was easily suppressed. This gave Erdoğan, now the President, all the justification he needed to purge and/or arrest anyone who might be seen by him as opposition. Erdoğan is even openly voicing criticism of the secularism of Atatürk, something previously inconceivable in Turkish politics. Yet enough of the electorate now seems to be Islamized and radicalized that Erdoğan continues to be popular. Thus we may have another case seen more than once in the Islamic world of a democratic system supporting a leader whose ambition is to abolish the democracy and establish his own dictatorship. In Algeria and Egypt, the Army did not allow this process to continue. That used to be the dynamic in Turkey, but then the previous governments that were overthrown were merely corrupt and ineffective, and they were not using ʾIslām to undermine the basic ideology of the State. Things got out of hand with Erdoğan because he was not obviously corrupt, his policies were actually helping Turkey economically, his Islamic ambitions seemed muted and reasonable, and for all these reasons he enjoyed broad support. Yet he had always dropped hints, as in the epigraph, what his ambitions and intentions really were. Now it may be too late. Americans were similarly deceived by someone like Barack Obama.\n\nWer redet heute noch von der Vernichtung der Armenier?\n\nWho, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?\n\nAdolf Hitler, August 22, 1939 [Nuremberg Tribunal document L-3, or Exhibit USA-28 -- the authenticity of the document is disputed by partisans of Turkey]\n\nThe historical and international image of the Turks does not seem to be the most lovable or romantic. Most Americans probably are going to be more sympathetic to people with historic grievances against Turkey -- Greeks, Armenians, Romanians, Serbs, even Arabs. Most people may not know of all the vanished ancient peoples of Anatolia, from the Phrygians and Galatians to the Isaurians, or even the sad Fall of Constantinople; but most are likely aware of lingering outrage over the genocide of the Armenians and other Christians during World War I -- an event that Turkey still officially and stoutly denies, despite thorough historical documentation, not to mention many surviving eyewitnesses -- and more recent actions against the Kurds [note]. Not long ago it was a crime in Turkey to assert, even on the floor of the parliament, that there even were Kurds in the country -- and in 1994 four members of parliament were sentenced to 15 years in prison for giving speeches in Kurdish. Although responding in some ways to European demands for human rights improvements before being considered for admission to the European Union, since December 2001 the Turkish government has officially regarded Kurdish given names as \"terrorist propaganda\" and refused to register them for Kurdish children. With all this, one does not even need to see the very hostile, anti-Turkish movie Midnight Express [1978].\n\nIn historical perspective, however, it is not clear to what extent the ancient peoples even still existed by the time of the Turkish arrival. Greek assimilation, i.e. Hellenization, of Anatolian peoples had been progressing steadily for centuries, and Turkish settlement in comparison doesn't necessarily look all that different -- indeed, the surge in the Turkish population in the 13th and 14th centuries involved people fleeing the terror of the Mongols. They were refugees. Given the religious cause that the Ottomans thought they were vindicating, the Fall of Constantinople, far from sad, was one of the supreme moments of achievement in the history of Islām. A Western, or a modern liberal, evaluation will not give that much weight, but it is not hard to imagine that the sensation it created in Islām was not much different from that in Christendom at the capture of Jerusalem by the First Crusade, or the completion of the Reconquista in Spain. These are similarly denigrated by modern liberal opinion, but it is hard to imagine how the values at the time could have been different -- and everyone should guard against an anachronistic moral indignation (which liberal opinion tends to focus on the Crusades rather than on any Islamic Conquest, for which Islām usually seems more excused than Christianity -- an example of the selective judgment of moralistic relativism). There is also the fear now of the politically correct of being accused of \"Islamophobia\" for addressing simple truths of Islamic history and practice.\n\nThe subsequent Ottoman Empire features the goods and evils characteristic of most empires, and some peculiar to those of the Middle East -- e.g. the refuge provided for Spanish Jews in 1492 (with Spanish speaking Jews living today in Turkey), as against the slavery and forced conversion of Christian children for the Janissary corps. Evils specific to nationalism emerged later, like the aforementioned genocide of Armenians and the continuing suppression of the Kurds, an Iranian people who happen to be Orthodox Moslems like the Turks. The Turks are not uniquely at fault for this, and the solution is a kind of society (liberal and capitalistic) upon which few in the world entirely agree, even in the ethnic plurality of societies like the United States. Turkey now has an especially tough time with its own identity as it is torn between the Islamic fundamentalist revival seen elsewhere and the secularism that Kemal Atatürk made the foundation of the modern state in the 1920's. None of this may make Turkey particularly lovable, but it does make the Turks mostly like anybody else; and modern Turkey has a large population of people who seem all but indistinguishable from secular Europeans -- and reasonably disinclined to be blamed for the sins of the past. Turkey has a history that has its horrors but, indeed, also its own bit of romance and magnificence: a desire to surpass Sancta Sophia (still called Aya Sofya in Turkish, after the Greek version of the name, Ἅγια Σοφία, Hagia Sophia) produced a series of some of the most beautiful mosques in Islām, which have inspired much of subsequent Islāmic architecture (the standard domed mosque, starting with Muḥammad ʿAlī's Alabaster Mosque in Cairo) [note].\n\nA recent controversy of note has been over the Syriac Orthodox Mor Gabriel Monastery, where a government land resurvey and hostile neighboring Muslim villagers have threatened the monastery, founded in 397 AD, with the loss of half of its land. Since local Christians have been leaving the area for decades, few remain, and the monastery itself is down to three monks and twelve nuns [cf. The Wall Street Journal, March 7-8, 2009, p.A8]. The Turkish government is caught between the attraction of tourism and even Christian return, with economic benefits, and the Islamists, who would just as soon drive all non-Muslims out of the area, if not out of Turkey altogether, regardless of the consequences. As a land dispute, the matter has ended up in the Turkish courts, which have shown some reluctance to get drawn in. With observers and diplomats from the EU and international Christian and human rights organizations present, the courts are at least aware that they operate in a spotlight, with sensitive political issues on the line.\n\nNow, as of January 26, 2011, the Turkish Supreme Court, overturning some lower courts, has approved seizure of much of the land of the Monastery by the Turkish Government, despite the clear record of ownership (for centuries) and even the consistent tax remittances of the Monastery for the land. This seems of a piece with the progress of Islamist radicalism in Turkey. As in Iraq and Egypt, the goal of the movement does seem to be to drive the remaining Christians out of the Middle East. It is hard to imagine that anyone, including the Turkish Government, now takes seriously the application of Turkey for membership in the European Union. Recently, we have seen statements from Britain, France, and Germany all expressing alarm at the growth of extremism and lack of assimilation among Muslim immigrants in Europe. The apologetic for ʾIslām that labels critics as \"Islamophobes\" cannot survive the exposure of the oppression of Christians in these Islamic countries. A cooperative Western press, with its own illiberal and anti-American agenda, has helped limit knowledge even of outright massacres of Christians -- e.g. the Egyptian military, universally praised for its restraint in dealing with anti-government protestors, has opened fire, in incidents unreported by the \"Mainstream\" media, against Christian protestors -- but the ugly scale of this process cannot be concealed indefinitely.\n\nA discussion of general sources for this material is given under Francia and Islām. Some additional sources include The Penguin Historical Atlas of Russia (John Channon with Rob Hudson, 1995), and various prose histories, such as The Ottoman Centuries (Lord Kinross, Morrow Quill, 1977).\n\nThe Altaic and Uralic Languages\n\nModern Romania, Ottoman Successor States in the Balkans\n\nModern Romania Index\n\nThe Shihābī Amīrs of Lebanon, 1697-1842 AD\n\nThe House of Muḥammad ʿAlī in Egypt, 1805-1953 AD\n\nThe Sanūsī Amīrs & Kings of Libya, 1837-1969 AD\n\nRome and Romania Index\n\nIslāmic Index\n\nPhilosophy of History\n\nHome Page\n\nCopyright (c) 1996, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved\n\nThe Ottoman Sulṭāns and Caliphs, Note 1\n\nA recent correspondent indignantly claimed that the Imperial burials had already been completely destroyed by the Crusaders. Well, the Fourth Crusade was not above looting the dead, but even if they had the energy to open all the tombs, back to Constantine, it is hard to imagine that they would have been so interested in destroying the burials that there would not have been plenty left for the Greeks to subsequently reinter. The Crusaders, after all, were looking for valuables, since the tax base of their domain was pitiful and they were always short of money. Vandalism was not beyond them, but it was not their main concern.\n\nIndeed, on one account, when the Crusaders opened the sarcophagus of Justinian, they \"found that his corpse was miraculously uncorrupted after over 600 years. Consequently, they left it alone...\" [Jonathan Harris, Constantinople, Capital of Byzantium, Hambledon Continuum, London, New York, 2007, p.161]. An incorruptible body, of course, has been a mark, not just in Christianity but also in Buddhism (and The X-Files), of sainthood. Anyone knowing much about Justinian, whose personality has been compared to that of Richard Nixon, might find that surprising. But Justinian is regarded as a Saint in the Orthodox Church.\n\nAnd even if the Crusaders then did loot the bodies of all other Emperors, there were almost two hundred years under the Palaeologi to do proper burials of new Emperors, which likely would have used such empty sarcophagi as might have been left from the depredations of the Crusaders. My suspicion therefore, with the most charitable regard for Meḥmed II, is that some of the burials may still lie under the great mosque. Some future archaeology may be allowed to test this.\n\nAn interesting assertion has now come to my attention. Peter Sarris says:\n\nMoreover, Mehmed and his heirs were determined to literally build on the achievements of the rulers of Byzantium: beneath the Topkapi palace from which they ruled, they buried the sarcophagi of Byzantine rulers, including Heraclius, whose tombs had originally been placed in the Church of the Holy Apostles, while that Church was demolished and replaced by a mosque honouring Mehmed Fatiḥ [Byzantium: A Very Short History, Oxford University Press, p.126]\n\nThis is the first that I have heard of this. Sarris is a \"Reader in Late Roman, Medieval, and Byzantine History and a Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\" So his academic credentials are impressive, but he does not tell us the source of this information -- something probably due to the format of the Oxford \"Very Short Introductions\" series, of which the Sarris book is number 437. Things are not footnoted here as in full format scholarly works. The reference to Heraclius indicates some specificity in the source.\n\nHowever, this is an intriguing possibility. There are some imperial sarcophagi lying around Istanbul, but nowhere near as many as we would expect from a 1000 year history of burials, unless many others were broken up or adapted for building material. My thought was that some might still be left under the Fatih mosque, but what Sarris says opens more possibilities. Burying the Roman Emperors, or at least their sarcophagi, under Topkapi not only dramatically appropriates the Imperial tradition, it prevents attempts to recover the burials or make claims that Emperors, like Constantine XI, have risen from the dead. It also prevents the Imperial burials from becoming sites of Christian veneration or pilgrimage, which is probably why the Church of the Holy Apostles was demolished, and the Fatih mosque built, in the first place. This is altogether reasonable, but I would like to know the source that Peter Sarris has used.\n\nPeter Sarris has been kind enough to respond to my inquiry, with the answer that he has derived his information from the lectures of Byzantinist Cyril Mango. There is no contemporary reference for the Ottoman removal of Imperial burials or sarcophagi. However, Mango discusses the issue in a paper, \"Three Imperial Byzantine Sarocophagi Discovered in 1750,\" in the Dumbarton Oaks Papers [Vol. 16, 1962, pp.397-402]. It seems that three porphyry sarcophagi were discovered in 1750 buried on the grounds of the Topkapı palace, as witnessed by the French merchant Jean-Claude Flachat. There seems little doubt that the sarcophagi had been moved to the site of the palace at the time of the demolition of the Church of the Holy Apostles, although any memory of this act had been lost in the two centuries that by then had already passed.\n\nNow, in his work De Ceremoniis, the scholar Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogentus had described 60 some burials of Emperors and Imperial family members in the Church and at locations nearby. Ten of the sacrophagi described by him and in other accounts were porphyry, and eight actually survive. One of the finds of 1750 seems to have been the sarcophagus of the Emperor Manuel I Comnenus, which post-dates Constantine VII, was described by the historian Nicetas Choniates, was attested by him as laid in the monastery of the Pantocrator (which was demolished by the Ottomans like the Church), and whose form features seven domes on the lid, apparently like the Church of the Holy Apostles itself. This extraordinary artifact has since gone missing.\n\nWhat remains obscure, of course, is the fate of the actual burials, if it was only the sarcophagi that were removed to the Topkapı, not to mention the two score tombs described by Constantine that did not contain porphyry sarcophagi. There seems to be some particular interest by the Ottomans in the porphyry artifacts, which perhaps is not surprising, since the stone was regarded as commensurate in status with the Imperial office, and, having only been obtainable, ultimately, from Egypt, its probable rarity signified just that status. If the Ottomans did not perceive any symbolic or numinous force in the stone used for other sarcophagi, they may have been recycled for building material rather than buried at the Topkapı.\n\nWe might be sensible of the possibility that the correspondent might have wanted the Crusaders to despoil all the burials, and not the Ottomans, out of a notion that the Crusaders were bad and the Ottomans good. Of course, many Crusaders, especially in the Fourth Crusade, were bad; but the Ottomans were bad also. All were engaged in looting and vandalism, and the Ottomans had particular reasons to go after churches, monasteries, burials, and statuary, as they did. The satuary that existed in Constantinople, which we know from accounts, is all gone; and not all of it has ended up in Venice. The Ottomans did their part.\n\nReturn to the Fall of Constantinople\n\nReturn to Text\n\nThe Ottoman Sulṭāns and Caliphs, Note 2\n\nWhen I was taking a Linguistics class at the University of Texas, probably in 1976, we had just had a unit on rules like this in languages. On the test, we were given examples of Turkish, and the problem was to figure out the rules of vowel harmony.\n\nI knew the rules already. I had even already found Hagopian's 1907 Turkish grammar in the UCLA Research Library. I was, after all, a graduate student; and I had already taken Arabic and Persian.\n\nWas this cheating? If I raised my hand and said, \"Professor, I know the rules already,\" would this be a kind of boasting? Is this note a kind of boasting? Would he have given me a different problem? Well, if the test was testing my knowledge, I was certainly passing a test of knowledge. I didn't say anything. Nothing like that happened again in that class.\n\nSitting next to me in this same class was a Chinese girl, who I asked about the authenticity of my Chinese name, 克利.\n\nApplying the kind of phonetic rule that was being tested is something I have otherwise tried to do with the pronunciation of \"Hawai'i.\"\n\nReturn to Text\n\nThe Ottoman Sulṭāns and Caliphs, Note 3;\n\nPerso-Turkish Backgammon Dice Combinations\n\nThe following table is adapted from Hapogian's list of the names of dice combinations [op.cit., p.264]. Constructing this involved some difficulties, since Hagopian uses his own transcription equivalences for Turkish and does not, in this case, give the names in Arabic script. I have given the names in Modern Turkish phonology but with some modifications to the modern orthography (e.g. \"j\" for \"c\" -- since \"c\" is used for English \"j\" in no other language that I know of). Atatürk's orthography can easily be restored using the chart in the table at below right. Below the names in the Arabic alphabet is their original pronunciation in Persian or Turkish, identical to the images in the number tables above. The Turkish names themselves are from The Oxford Turkish Dictionary [H.C. Hony, A.D. Alderson, and Fahir Iz, Oxford, 1992, 1995]. The reference for Persian is Persian Vocabulary, by A.K.S. Lambton [Cambridge University Press, 1954, 1969, 32s 6d].\n\nThe letter is from Persian, pronounced in that language as va or o, but ultimately from Arabic wa; and it just means \"and.\" Hagopian glosses this as \"ou means 'and'.\" Although Hagopian consistenty writes the word as \"ou,\" in Modern Turkish it becomes subject to vowel harmony; and so gets vocalized, as shown in the table, with ü, i, or as the \"i\" without a dot. It does not seem to be realized anywhere as an actual u. There are some other phonetic changes in vowels and some consonants.\n\nA couple other difficulties concern sebayüdü (3-2) and dubara (2-2). These have elements that are not numbers. Hagopian gives the former as \"sé-ba-dū\" and the latter as \"dū-baré\" (he does not use umlauts for the appropriate vowels). In the first instance, Modern Turkish has introduced an extra syllable, yü, while what we see in Hagopian is liable to be the Persian word , which just means \"with.\" So we're saying, \"3 with 2.\" But what the yü would be just defeats me.\n\nThe second word, dubara is worse. The bara or \"baré\" element seems likely to be Persian , but it has lost a syllable and semantically seems unsuitable -- the word means \"for.\" I can't say what is going on here.\n\nThen there is a case that is not puzzling in the same ways. Hepyek (1-1) clearly uses the Turkish word hep, meaning \"all\"; but my writing of it as is a guess. I cannot find the word written in Arabic in Hagopian, whose English-Turkish vocabulary does not give the Arabic writings and who is lacking a Turkish-English vocabulary.\n\nThe final issue may be whether these words should all be written as one word. I have written them as separate words largely for convenience, just using the Persian and Turkish names of the numbers directly from the separate treatments; but we also have the evident practice in Hagopian that where he writes \"ou,\" he actually leaves a space between the words. This is where the Arabic script versions of the names would again have settled the problem.\n\nPerso-Turkish Backgammon Dice Combinations 654321 1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\nNote that, while there are three cases here that add up to \"7,\" for purposes of probability, the complete table should be filled out, so that the combinations 3-4, 2-5, and 1-6 would also occur, giving six chances out of 36 of rolling a \"7.\" Thus, one is in the best position at the beginning of a dice game (\"Craps\"), where the best chance exists of rolling \"7,\" a winner, and the lowest of rolling \"2\" or \"12,\" which are losers. Afterwards, \"7\" is the loser. Curious phenomena of probability carry over into quantum mechanics.\n\nReturn to Text\n\nThe Ottoman Sulṭāns and Caliphs, Note 4\n\nNot all who deny the existence of the Armenian genocide are Turkish, as I have heard from recent correspondents. Anyone sincerely sceptical or confused about the matter should consult Death by Government [Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, New Jersey, 1995, pp.209-239], by R.J. Rummel, one of the greatest living experts on mass murder. Rummel estimates the number of Armenians murdered in the main organized genocide program (there were others), from 1915-1918, as 1,404,000 persons.\n\nSome of the eyewitness testimony to this included reports by the American Ambassador to Turkey, Henry Morgenthau, Sr. (whose son, Henry Morgenthau, Jr., would be Franklin Roosevelt's Secretary of the Treasury), and by other American consular officials, at a time when the United States was still neutral in World War I. Morgenthau's account was published in 1919 as Ambassador Morgenthau's Story. I believe there is an accusation that Morgenthau's book was ghost-written by Armenians. Even if that were true, it still does not mean that the accounts were not correct (Armenians in exile would tend to be living evidence of what the Turks did), and much of the evidence associated with Morgenthau consists of diplomatic records that are contemporaneous with the"
