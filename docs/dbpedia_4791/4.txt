Symantec and Nexland have signed a letter of intent under which Symantec would purchase Nexland for $21.7 million in cash, Nexland announced Thursday in a press release.

Nexland, based in Miami, manufactures IP (Internet Protocol) networking appliances that are licensed by Symantec for its Symantec Firewall/VPN (virtual private network) Appliance products. In addition to its Firewall/VPN products, Symantec develops several software products designed to enhance both individual and corporate computer security.

Several hurdles remain before the deal is completed, including approvals from both companiesâ€™ boards of directors, and a due diligence investigation by Symantec, Nexland said. Symantec is based in Cupertino, Calif.
