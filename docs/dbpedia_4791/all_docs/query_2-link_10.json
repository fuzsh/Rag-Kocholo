        "text": "The Veritas acquisition caused some problems, but close partners say the security giant is back on its game.\n\nBy all accounts, Symantec Corp.'s acquisition of Veritas four years ago was a mess. Even Chief Operating Officer Enrique Salem acknowledges that the software giant learned valuable lessons -- of the hard-knocks variety -- from the deal.\n\nBut the company is growing increasingly confident that it has put the hard times behind it and built a solid blueprint from the Veritas experience for integrating subsequent and future acquisitions much more smoothly.\n\nWhile some speed bumps still exist, including a senior-level channel shake-up and lingering doubts about the company and its products in the channel, Symantec and some of its tightest partners see reason for optimism.\n\nWith its portfolio of dozens of Microsoft-related products and solutions across security, storage and systems-management categories, Symantec presents clear opportunities for Microsoft partners. Now that Symantec is making an effort to shake off some of the real and image-related problems of the last few years, the question is whether it's time for Microsoft partners to take another look at representing Symantec.\n\nDealmaker's Lessons\n\nThere's no question Symantec had a hard time swallowing the Veritas acquisition. At the October Symantec PartnerEngage\n\nconference in Washington, D.C., Salem said the company learned several things, the most important of which was that it should have acted faster. It was understandable for Symantec to tread gingerly at the time. Symantec and Veritas were practically equals in the deal, which was valued at about $13.5 billion when it was announced in December 2004 and which closed in July 2005. Salem acknowledges that one of the two corporate cultures should have been named the alpha dog earlier in the process, duplicate positions and departments should have been cut faster, and cross-pollinating research and development should have ramped up earlier.\n\nAmazingly, the company is still making some adjustments. At the beginning of this year, Symantec went from having two major divisions based on the historical product areas of security (Symantec) and storage (Veritas) to a much more integrated approach with overlapping R&D. Part of that was driven by last year's acquisition of Altiris -- as well as a handful of other systems-management tool vendors -- that no longer allows for such a straightforward split of the business anymore. Dozens of products are now spread across broad categories and sold as solutions. Part of the point of the recent partner conference was to introduce partners to the concept of representing more products.\n\nRandy Cochran, Symantec vice president of channel sales in North America, says the word to partners over the last few years had been, \"'I don't need a lot of shareshift.' The message [to partners] was, 'Stay in your lane.'\"\n\nNow Symantec wants partners in as many lanes as possible. \"We're integrating our partners,\" Salem says. \"We want them in the same program.\" Bill Robbins, senior vice president for Symantec's Americas Geography, told partners that Symantec customers currently have an average of 2.8 products installed. \"There's tremendous opportunity for us to go in there and upsell,\" he said. The Symantec portfolio now consists of more than 100 products as the company continues to acquire other companies, and the message is clear: More acquisitions and products are on the way.\n\n\"Our current plan is to spend about $1 billion per year on three to six acquisitions per year,\" COO Salem says (see \"An Acquisitive Streak\").\n\nA Bumpy Road\n\nDealing with acquisitions isn't Symantec's only challenge when it comes to partner perceptions. About six months into his tenure as COO, Salem made some comments to analysts over the summer that caused a serious flap in the channel. Salem told the investors that Symantec would give its 700 to 900 largest accounts the option of working through the channel or dealing directly with Symantec's salespeople."
