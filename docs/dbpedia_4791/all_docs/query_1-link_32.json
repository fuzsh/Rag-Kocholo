        "text": "The simplest way is you can put two static default routes on the router to get out. If they both have the same weight, they should load balance. If one goes down, the other takes all the traffic. Or if you prefer one over the other, you can give that one a lower weight. But you may have problems with traffic getting back in. Not sure if the traffic will come back in the same ISP it went out. That all depends on how your nework is set up (i.e., Firewall, NAT, public vs. private desktop IPs, etc) You can also use BGP which is a little more complicated.\n\nNone of these methods would provide true load-sharing and resilience – for incoming services you are tied to one ISP (the ISP which “owns” the IP address for the service). For outgoing, the return traffic would not load-share (even with BGP).\n\nThe only way of doing this is to use an extra layer of intelligence – including, for instance, maintaining authority for your domain names yourself and performing “clever” name resolution based upon availability, load-sharing etc. Look here for such a product:\n\nhttp://www.radware.com/content/products/lp/default.asp"
