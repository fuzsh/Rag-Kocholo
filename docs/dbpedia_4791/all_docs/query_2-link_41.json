It is part which supports the Norton Download Insight Feature. File Insight provides insight of the files that you download and install in your computer. The reputation details that Norton provides help you decide the trust level and safety of a file. Norton displays the details of these files in the File Insight window.[1]\n\nThe File Insight window provides the following information:\n\nThe file type and the file name\n\nThe date on which file was installed\n\nThe date on whuch file was last used\n\nThe lineage details of the file\n\nThe actions that the file performs on your system\n\nThe level at which the file uses the resources of your computer\n\nThe performance impact that it does\n\nThe Stability of the file for the specific operating system\n\nThe version of the file\n\nWho developed the file?\n\nUsage\n\nThe File Insight window also lets you find the location of the file on your computer. In addition, you can copy the data that is available window in the Clipboard and save the data for future use.\n\nYou can use the Learn More link in the File Insight window to obtain more information on the Norton product tutorials section of the Symantec website.\n\nIssues With Norton File Insight\n\nFor a number of years Norton File Insight appears to only recognize the safety verification measures from premium software companies. Norton File Insight often erroneously flags a downloaded file as having no Digital Signature and no version number and therefore a potential threat.[2] [3] Larger, more-established software companies appear to be able to avoid these problems.\n\nFurthermore, whitelisting a file (i.e. having Symantec investigate software and classify it as safe) is ineffective because developers will have to constantly reapply for white-listing status each time they publish revisions of their software. This is particularly a problem for small software developers with small production teams who constantly publish revisions and updates rather than have an extensive internal development cycle before releasing updates.\n\nThese problems hinder an industry of small business software developers from having equal market access since they lack the resources to comply with Norton File Insight's demanding and unclear requirements to avoid being flagged as a potential threat to users.\n\nOther New features of Norton 2010\n\nSONAR 2\n\nNorton Download Insight\n\nReferences"
