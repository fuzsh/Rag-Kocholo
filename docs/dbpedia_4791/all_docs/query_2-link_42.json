        "text": "&#149; Symantec, Cupertino, Calif., unveiled a new version of its global enterprise early warning system, DeepSight Threat Management System. The system, which Symantec acquired from SecurityFocus last year, now integrates data from firewalls and features new reporting and customization capabilities. The system collects and correlates data from firewalls and intrusion-detection systems from 19,000 companies worldwide and notifies customers if there is a pattern that indicates an attack.\n\n&#149; Seattle-based WatchGuard Technologies posted a fourth-quarter loss of $11.7 million on revenue of $22.1 million, compared with a loss of $10.2 million on revenue of $12.4 million the same quarter a year ago.\n\n&#149; Saflink, Bellevue, Wash., announced the availability of SAFremote Authenticator, a biometrics authentication product designed to enable biometrics sign-on for secure remote access to Citrix MetaFrame and NFuse environments.\n\n&#149; Miami-based Nexland, a maker of Internet security appliances, said it signed a letter of intent to be acquired by Symantec for $21.7 million in cash. Cupertino-based Symantec currently licenses Nexland's technology for use in its firewall/VPN appliances, Nexland said.\n\n&#149; Joan Lyman, formerly Joan Wilbanks, who co-founded Atlanta-based SecureWorks, said she is stepping down as chairman to head a security patch management startup called nmotion.\n\n&#149; Crossbeam Systems, Concord, Mass., hired Mark Bennett as vice president of channel sales. Bennett most recently was vice president of commercial sales at TippingPoint, a provider of intrusion-prevention technology, and previously worked at Intrusion."
