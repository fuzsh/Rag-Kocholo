        "text": "This paper looks at over one hundred marriages between the upper echelons of English society and those born abroad; the so-called aliens during the thirteenth century. Part One sets out who these alien husbands and wives were and the impetus for the various waves of marriages. It considers both alien brides and grooms. It also looks at the areas from whence came the alien marriage partners. . Where it is possible, an assessment of who promoted the marriages over the century has been made. Part Two looks at the mechanisms by which these alien marriages were achieved. It considers the context of alien marriages before and after Magna Carta which brought, in theory, more protection to potential spouses. Resistance to proposed marriage partners is set out as well as a consideration of the problems associated with the re-marriage of widows. This Part also searches for evidence as to the success or failure of alien marriages particularly in relation to where the partners chose to be buried, their gifts of piety in favour of their partners and displays of shared allegiance on their armorial seals and documents. Finally it consider sthe impact of these alien marriages on English political, social and cultural life.\n\nRevised and and expanded version of a paper given at annual conference of the Haskins Society, 2007: Eleanor presided over a large and elaborate household, befitting a queen who was also duchess of Aquitaine, and she had revenues to support a great household with an income equivalent to of an earl’s or baron’s. It is possible to identify some members of her household at various times, and the differences between her household in England and in Poitou are significant. Her household in England included only a few Poitevins, and Henry saw that it included some of his own men. Eleanor constructed a household at Poitiers from 1168 that included clerks capable of giving expression to her authority through her charters."
