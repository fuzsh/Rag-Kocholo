        "text": "King John I of England was also called John Lackland.\n\nThe life of John I was one filled with low expectations and even lower performance. It’s these low expectations that led to his most famous byname “John Lackland.” In French, this name was “Jean sans Terre,” but in any language the nickname was an insult referring to John I’s status as an unlikely heir to the English throne who was never supposed to rule over the land (and therefore lack land).\n\nJohn I’s older brother was Richard I of England, aka Richard the Lionheart.\n\nWhen former King Richard the Lionheart died in 1199, despite previously trying to take the throne by force, John I was recognized as Richard I’s successor and crowned king of England.\n\nIsabella of Gloucester, John I’s first wife, was his cousin.\n\nSure, people may joke that it is commonplace for the royal family to be inbred, but even back during the times of King John I, it was an issue when his father, King Henry II, betrothed him to Isabella of Gloucester, with whom he shared a great-grandfather, King Henry I. In fact, the Archbishop of Canterbury banned the two from marrying but was overruled when Henry II went to the pope, who allowed John I and Isabella of Gloucester to marry, but only if they agreed to never consummate the marriage.\n\nA family of backstabbers tinged the history of King John I.\n\nNot only did several of John’s brothers attempt to overthrow their own father, Henry II, but the fighting did not stop once Henry II was no longer on the throne. In fact, John I’s family continued to fight against each other for all of his life.\n\nJohn I was very short and not very good-looking.\n\nHistorians have found that the king barely reached the diminutive height of 5 feet, 5 inches and had a barrel-chested, broad-shouldered figure, which put his appearance far from the common beauty standards.\n\nKing John I of England had very expensive tastes.\n\nFrom books to jewels and from backgammon to gambling, the life of John I was filled with every expensive whim the king could possibly want. Some historians even say that King John I of England’s love of these expensive things bordered on obsession.\n\nKing John of England had crazy mood swings.\n\nAlthough often characterized as “genial, witty, generous and hospitable,” John I was known to be incredibly violent and angry, sometimes even resulting in self-harm by chewing his own fingers as an outlet for the fury. It is this angry behavior that turned many people against the king during his reign.\n\nHenry II, the kingly father of John I, made him Lord of Ireland.\n\nJohn I’s family continued to fight throughout his whole life, and as a way to get back at his rebellious brothers, Henry II wanted to give John I power and land. One of his ways of doing this was by giving John I control over Ireland in 1177, although John I would not prove to be a very good lord when he made fun of the local leaders.\n\nHenry II would continue to place John I in the middle of his fights with his other sons, namely Henry the Young King, whose nickname is quite possibly the antithesis to John Lackland’s and represented his future as King of England. Henry the Young King eventually decided that he had had enough of his father playing games by passing around control of lands, and so he, his brothers and their mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, rose up against Henry II.\n\nMeanwhile, John I grew up and eventually realized that the easiest way to get himself on the throne wasn’t to join in on rebellion but instead to suck up to and stick by the king. And so, the son who he had once called “Lackland” quickly became the favorite of the King of England. Henry II began to lay all his eggs in the basket that was John I, giving him more money and more power. However, this favoritism wasn’t to last, as, eventually, John I too rebelled against his father and supported Richard I in dethroning Henry II.\n\nAfter Henry II’s death, most likely due to a stress-induced ulcer, John I was allowed to rise in power alongside the new King Richard I of England. When Richard I took the throne, John I was made Duke of Normandy, and then in 1199 when Richard I died, John I finally took the throne and was crowned king of England in Westminster Abbey at the age of 33.\n\nKing John of England is one of many famous kings of England. Like many historical figures, he is known in today’s society through popular culture, especially that of the stories of Robin Hood. In Robin Hood, King John I is one of the titular hero’s biggest antagonists. More impressive, although certainly less known, is his part in the William Shakespeare play The Life and Death of King John (c. 1596-97), which chronicles the life of the controversial king, especially the exploits of his backstabbing family.\n\nHowever, none of these pieces of pop culture do justice to what history has found to be John I’s most important contribution: the signing of the Magna Carta. The Magna Carta, which literally means the “great charter,” lays out the many liberties that the dawn of the Renaissance made so popular during this time period. These liberties include the beginnings of representative government, and that no free man could be arrested without the lawful judgment of his peers or due process of the law, a principle commonly called the “rule of law.”"
