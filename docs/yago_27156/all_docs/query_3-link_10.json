        "text": "Fine of the Month: May 2006\n\n(Louise Wilkinson)\n\n1. The Dower of Isabella of AngoulÃªme\n\nThis month it is a great pleasure to welcome Dr. Louise Wilkinson's first contribution to the Fine of the Month series. Now lecturing at Christ Church University, Canterbury, Louise both inspired and devised the Henry III Fine Rolls Project and has been an active member of the project management team. In this article she brings the controversial career of Henry III's mother, Isabella of AngoulÃªme, into sharper focus, examining the struggles between the queen mother and the minority government in the 1220s over her dower settlement.\n\nâ1Isabella of AngoulÃªme (d. 1246), the wife of King John and mother of King Henry III, was a highly controversial political figure during the early thirteenth century. 1 She was the queen consort whose marriage helped to spark the disastrous conflict with King Philip Augustus of France which resulted in the loss of Normandy in 1204. 2 She was also the queen dowager who left behind four of her five fatherless children in England in 1217 when she returned to her native homeland of AngoulÃªme, and who later married Hugh X de Lusignan, her daughterâs betrothed. When considered alongside the close and patent rolls, the small series of entries in which she features in the fine rolls for Henry IIIâs reign provide a useful insight into Isabellaâs remarkable widowhood and her fraught relationship with her sonâs government.\n\nâ2In order to comprehend the events of Isabellaâs widowhood, it is necessary to say a few words about her marriage to John by way of background. Married in August 1200 to one of Englandâs most unpopular monarchs, Isabellaâs reputation during her lifetime suffered at the hands of chroniclers concerned to portray her as a fitting partner for John. The St Albans writer, Roger of Wendover, went so far as to blame the inadequate defence of Normandy on Johnâs reluctance to leave Isabellaâs side, âso that it was said that he was infatuated by sorcery or witchcraftâ. 3 Whether or not Wendoverâs account of Johnâs pleasure in Isabellaâs company can be trusted 4 , it is clear from government records that Isabella enjoyed little personal political influence over the affairs of her husbandâs territories during his reign. John denied his wife access to resources which might have allowed her freedom to dispense patronage and play an active part in court politics. 5 Admittedly, extensive French properties were settled on Isabella as dower in 1200, followed by a further assignment comprising English and Norman properties after the death of her mother-in-law, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in 1204 6 , but Isabella did not enjoy possession of her dower or queenâs gold during her first marriage. 7\n\nâ3Although Eleanor died just four years after Johnâs second marriage, Isabella might well have been impressed as a young bride by her mother-in-lawâs formidable reputation. 8 Certain striking parallels can be drawn between Isabellaâs and Eleanorâs experiences as queen consorts. Both women were the heiresses of strategically important lands in the south of France, lands which recommended them as marriage partners for members of the Angevin dynasty. 9 Just as Isabella played a minimal role in English government under John, Eleanorâs involvement in the affairs of Henry IIâs dominions was heavily circumscribed after her relationship with her husband deteriorated in the late 1160s and early 1170s. 10 Both women, however, fulfilled their primary function as queen consorts, and safeguarded the succession to their husbandsâ thrones by bearing sons. After sixteen years in captivity at the hands of her estranged husband, the reign of Eleanorâs son Richard (1189-99), witnessed her greatest period of political activity. 11 With the example of her mother-in-law before her, might not Isabella have harboured similar ambitions after the death of John and the accession of her son, the nine-year-old Henry III, in the midst of civil war?\n\nâ4A clear indication that Isabella harboured such ambitions exists in the form of a letter close, issued on 1 November 1216, just four days after Henry IIIâs coronation at Gloucester, which instructed the sheriff of Devon âthat immediately and without delayâ he should hand over to âLady Isabella the queen, our motherâ the city of Exeter and various other properties in Devon which had been assigned to her in dower. 12 The short space of time between Johnâs death, her sonâs coronation and the assignment of Isabellaâs dower strongly suggests that the queen mother was moving not only to secure possession of her property but also to establish a position of influence within her sonâs fledgling regime. Yet the order of 1 November 1216 was silent on the matter of Isabellaâs continental dower, much of which had been lost with Anjou and Normandy during her husbandâs reign. In the following spring, Isabella was awarded seisin of the stannaries of Devon, apparently in partial recompense. 13 The matter of her dower and her possession of the stannaries were considered to be sufficiently weighty by the government to be listed in the fine rolls as an item for discussion at the kingâs council held at Oxford during the spring of 1218. 14 Yet Isabella, apparently frustrated at her exclusion from the deliberations of Henry IIIâs minority government, had already departed from England during the previous year to administer her inheritance in AngoulÃªme. 15\n\nâ5After her departure from England, Isabella did not display the same level of attachment to her sonâs regime as her mother-in-law had shown towards Richard and John in her widowhood. 16 Just three years after she left, Isabella entered into a new marriage with a powerful Poitevin lord, Hugh X de Lusignan, count of La Marche, who was already betrothed to Isabellaâs daughter and Henry IIIâs sister, Joan. 17 Isabella explained her extraordinary behaviour in a letter to her son in May 1220, in which she asked that her new husband might be assigned outstanding properties from her dower. She justified her actions with a convenient story that Hughâs âfriendsâ had expressed concern for Joanâs youth and urged him to seek another wife âin Franciaâ who was mature enough to bear him an heir. In order to avoid the possibility of an alternative marriage alliance which threatened Angevin interests, Isabella, presenting herself as a sacrificial offering (âGod knows, [she told her son], that we did this rather for your benefit than our ownâ), married Hugh herself. 18 More ominously, though, Isabella also urged Henry to be mindful of her new husbandâs power in Poitou 19 , now augmented by the acquisition of AngoulÃªme and the promise of Isabellaâs other wealth. 20\n\nâ6Isabellaâs marriage to Hugh, her new husbandâs territorial dominance in Poitou and her refusal to drop her claims to her dower, caused serious headaches for the minority government during the early 1220s. The couple continued to push their claims to the Poitevin territory of Saintes which had been promised with Niort to Isabella by John in dower in 1200 21 , but which had later been re-assigned to Joan as part of her Lusignan marriage settlement. 22 When the minority government insisted upon the return of Joanâs marriage portion, and Isabella and Hugh refused to co-operate, the English government applied pressure with the most effective weapon in its armoury â the confiscation of Isabellaâs English dower lands. 23 On 29 September 1221, two entries on the fine rolls recorded that the king had notified the men of Rockingham (Northamptonshire), Berkhamsted (Hertfordshire), Ilchester (Somerset), Exeter (Devon), ?Kenton (Devon), and Wilton (Wiltshire), all places held by Isabella in dower, along with the abbot of Malmesbury (Wiltshire), the keepers of Queenshithe in London and the earl of Essex, that he had âcommitted to Richard de Ripariis [Redvers] the custody of all the land that H. count de la Marche and I., his wife, the kngâs mother, had in England in the name of dower of I., the kingâs motherâ. 24 i Recognising the very real danger that this might push the kingâs mother and Hugh into the arms of the Capetians, Henryâs ministers later reneged and restored her dower to the queen mother and her new husband in 1222. 25 Isabellaâs officials were apparently administering her English dower lands on her behalf in the summer of 1223 when an entry on the fine rolls recorded that the king had ordered that certain demands made of the queenâs men by the sheriff of Northamptonshire should be placed in respite âuntil the king commands otherwiseâ. 26 Yet tensions continued to simmer between Hugh and Isabella, and her sonâs government, and came to a head once more during the summer of 1224 when Isabella and her husband abandoned their allegiance to Henry III and accepted an offer from the French king, Louis VIII, to compensate them for losses to Isabellaâs dower caused by their defection. 27 Once again, the split between Isabella and her sonâs government can be traced in the fine rolls. On 16 June 1224, the king committed to Thomas of Cirencester all the lands held by Isabella and Hugh âin England in the name of dower of the queenâ. 28 Although several olive branches were offered to Isabella and her new husband by the English government during the mid to late 1220s, and Henry nurtured hopes of a reunion 29 , Isabella remained, for the time being at least, an absentee and politically embarrassing mother to her eldest son. In August 1227, all Isabellaâs English dower was committed to Richard, earl of Cornwall, Henry IIIâs younger brother and Isabellaâs younger son by John. 30\n\n1.1.
