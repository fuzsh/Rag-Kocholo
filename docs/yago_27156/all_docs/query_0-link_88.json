        "text": "The chapter explores Isabella of Angoulême's relationship with King John, her role as a mother during the years of their marriage, her exclusion from royal government during the early months of King Henry III's minority, and the reasons for her departure from England in 1217. It then assesses the measures that were put in place to raise and safeguard her children by King John."
