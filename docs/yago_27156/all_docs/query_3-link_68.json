        "text": "   Isabel of Angouleme – Isabel of Angouleme was King John’s wife. John met her when he went to France to meet with his lords there. She was supposed to marry Hugh de Lusignan, a French noble. However, John stole her and married her instead. This makes Angouleme happy, but creates tension in John’s other French territory, Aquitaine. John was tactless when handling the lords and quarreled with his barons in his French territory, including that claimed in Isabel’s name. These facts created barons who were upset with John and instead decided to back their overlord, the French king Philip Augustus. When the barons appealed to Philip, John refused to appear at Philip’s court. Thus, Philip’s court ruled that John had forfeited all his French lands. This was the beginning of John’s lost of England’s possessions in France. Although he had originally gained territory from his marriage to Isabel, this action combined with his handling of the lords will cause him to lose everything. Isabel will also be important during her son, Henry III’s reign. She will get remarried to Hugh de Lusignon’s son, and, as family is very important to Henry, he will put his stepsiblings in positions of power, angering people because they are foreign and loyal to France. Battle of Bouvines 1214 – The Battle of Bouvines in 1214 marked the end of England’s control of territory on the continent, namely in France. Up to this point, John has been losing a lot of territory in France. By the end of this, John has lost all of his territory on the continent, even though he has tried to save it by making aliances with people like the Flemish and the Germans. All of these groups are defeated in this battle. By 1223, John only controls a couple of islands and a very little territory in Aquitaine. This defeat is significant in that it marks the end of English territory on the continent and because of the other effects the defeat creates. When John bails on France, the French lords operate under the idea “the overlord of my lord is my overlord,” supporting Philip Augustus, the king of France. It also causes the English lords and populace to become angry because the nation is losing places that can be taxed and also losing prestige and power. This loss at Bouvines also made the Magna Carta inevitable, because of the humiliation of the defeat. “A vassal of the Papacy” – John did not get along very well with the Papacy. The issues that they faced dealt once again with the Investiture Controversy. The major issue begins with the question of who should be named the Archbishop of Canterbury. Stephen Langton is elected to the position by the monks and supported by Pope Innocent, but John does not like him. John sees Stephen as an outsider and doesn’t believe that he’s manageable, so John won’t let him in the country. The Pope is not happy with this so he places England under 7 years of interdict. John is not very concerned with this, especially because during this time he is able to collect the church’s taxes, but it angers the people. John is finally forced to come to an agreement with the Pope because Philip Augustus, the king of France, is about to attack England and the church threatens to give their spiritual support to Philip. The terms of this agreement end the interdict, but require that Langton be allowed to be Archbishop and that John go on a crusade and collect Peter’s Pence as a tax to fund the crusade. The most significant term, however, is that John swears fealty to the papacy. This is already a part of the religious hierarchy, however, in this instance, it is about temporal power. This creates an issue because the king is supposed to be the top authority and the barons are worried that John will become a puppet to the Pope. How can a king be a vassal to someone else? Although John does not really follow through on this, from    time-to-time, the Pope will call on England as Rome’s vassal. It will also prove something that further pushes the barons towards writing the Magna Carta. The “Poetevins” and “Savoiards” – The Poetevins and Savoiards were two branches of Henry III’s family. The Poetevins were the Lusignans, Henry’s mother and stepsiblings. The Savoiards were his wife’s family. These two families would play a major role in Henry III’s reign because family was very important to him. He spent a lot of time with his family and puts them in positions of power. This would have consequences for him and the people’s opinions of him. For one, it will anger the people of England because, not only does he show them a lot of favoritism, but also these other family’s are foreign and, especially the Poetevins, loyal to France. Furthermore, both the families will fight over which one will have more power at court and more influence over the king. Eventually, these families, especially the Lusignians will let their greed get out-ofcontrol. As part of the Provisions of Oxford, Henry will agree that the Lusignans should be removed, which demonstrates the hatred that many of the lords feel towards these families and Henry’s treatment of them. Bond – As the administration began to get more and more complex, the process of government got more expensive. This created funding problems for the Crown. Henry III faced these issues during his reign. One way in which he tries to gain money was through bonds. At this point in England, the Jewish communities in England served as the bankers as the Church condemned charging interest on loans. The Jews, however, had no qualms about doing this and gave loans with very high interest rates. Oftentimes, people would default on their debt. When this was the case, the Jews would sell the bonds and the wealthy people would buy them in order to collect from the others. People at the court such as the queen’s family used these in order to have power over the other lords whose debts they owned. This caused people to blame the Jews for this corruption. However, Henry III participated in this practice, both taking out loans and buying them up. Eventually, the Jews began to leave England because they had become financially ruined from these practices. parliament/Parliament – The idea of parliament is something that evolved over time in England, really beginning during the mid-13th century. Originally parliament did not have very much power and it did not meet regularly. Henry III calls a parliament at Oxford in 1258 when the country is in a bad place and undergoing the Barons’ Rebellion. At this parliament, the barons try to place some provisions on the king so that he does not get to out of control, in the form of the Provisions of Oxford. However, the barons fight a lot, allowing Henry to regain power and repeal the Provisions of Oxford with the support of the Pope. When Henry is under the control of Simon de Montfort, Montfort called parliaments in the king’s name and attempted to broaden his base of support by including the middle class. Although Montfort was killed in battle, and Henry III was restored to full authority, the idea that there should be constant cooperation between the king and the barons had taken root in England and in the mind of Henry’s son who would become Edward I. It is under Edward that Parliament will become official. Edward calls Parliament whenever he needs money and they have the power of the purse, granting representation for taxation. Eventually Parliament becomes two houses, the House of Lords and House of Commons. Throughout the next few centuries Parliament will become a very powerful force in English government and evolve into what it is today.      Uplands vs. Lowlands – The question of upland vs. lowland territory played a large role in the English takeover of its surrounding territories, namely Wales. It influenced where the fighting took place, as it is much easier to fight in the Lowlands than to fight in the Uplands. The English wanted the Lowlands because they were easier to farm, pastoralize, etc. Thus, those were the areas that the English settled in, and where their influence was the greatest. There were also differences in culture between the people who lived in the Uplands and the people who lived in the Lowlands. Which type of territory people came from influenced the English perspective of them. Laudabilatur – The Pope issued The Laudabilatur in 1155. It gave Henry II and the English support and permission to invade Ireland because the Irish church was not following Gregorian reform. The English used this to justify their invasion and takeover of Ireland, making it very important. Now, historians believe the document was likely a fake written by someone in Henry’s court to give them justification to attack the Irish. Nevertheless, it helped to begin the major invasions of Ireland that would lead to plundering, conquering, and the imposition of the feudal system in Ireland. The two regions, however, remained divided by custom and by the English belief that the Irish were inferior and savage. Royal Favorite – A royal favorite is an individual who is favored by the monarch so much so that they may break laws or reward this person to the detriment of the nation. This gives the person who is the favorite a lot of wealth and oftentimes a lot of power over the king and government. While he is not the only one who had royal favorites, one of the times that royal favorites become a major problem during the reign of Edward II. One of his favorites was Piers Gaveston. Gaveston held so much power that to see the king, one had to go through him. Edward spent so much money on Gaveston that he needed more money and wanted to tax the people to get it. This angers the people and Parliament forces him into an agreement that includes, among other things, the exile of Gaveston. However, Edward brings Gaveston back and the barons murder him. Edwards next favorite Hugh Despenser also causes some issues. They do illegal things like manipulate trials to gain wealth. This also causes the anger of the barons and the people, and there is a rebellion. Eventually because of these practices, Parliament removes Edward II and places Edward III on the throne. These examples demonstrate how significant royal favorites can be in both manipulating the king and government and angering the people. This will not be the last time that royal favorites cause monarchs issues. Sodomy – Sodomy is a biblical term that was very important in defining homosexuality in the Middle Ages. This is the charge that would be used if a homosexuality case was brought to court. The key to this charge and definition is penetration. There would be a specific penance that would have to be paid for this act. Sodomy is relevant because there is the question of Edward II’s sexuality. It is possible that Edward was a homosexual and had relations with Piers and Hugh, but charges were never brought against him for it. Lesbian-like – Judith Bennett came up with the term lesbian-like. It is used to describe a relationship where there are elements of a lesbian relationship, but we do not necessarily know if there was one or not. The term lesbian-like can be used to describe some relationships of King Edward II. His relationships with his favorites Piers Gaveston and Hugh Despenser have some of the qualities of homosexual relationships,     but historians do not know if they truly engaged in homosexual activities. Lesbian-like is important for historians, because it is often as far as they can go in talking about a homosexual relationship of a historical figure. There is often not enough evidence to say for sure whether or not there really was a relationship. Valois (family) – Charles IV of France was of the Capetian line. The Capetians had ruled France since the 800s. However, upon Charles’ death, there was a succession crisis in France. He had no children or brothers, so his closest relative was Edward III of England, his sister Isabella’s son. But, the French nobles did not want Edward to inherit since England was one of France’s enemies. Thus, they use a very old law called Salian Law from the time of Charlemagne. This law states that women cannot inherit the throne. They use this to prove that Isabella’s son should not inherit the throne. Edward was excluded from the succession and instead, the Valois family inherits. Philip VI or the house of Valois was a cousin of the previous king. Upon his inheritance of the French throne in 1328, there is a new ruling family and a new family name, Valois. Philip is the one who would go on to attack Gascony, England’s only remaining territory in Aquitaine. Philip would also push the Scots to invade England. Under the Valois family, the rivalry between the French and the English would continue. Salian Law – Salian Law came from the Salian Franks. It was a very old law from before the time of Charlemagne that had not been used in centuries. The law states that women cannot inherit. The French used this law in the succession crisis after the death of Charles IV. Charles has children or brothers, so his closest heir was Edward III of England, his sister’s son. This angered the French nobles because France and England were enemies. Thus, the French use this Salian Law to prove that Edward should not be able to inherit through his mother’s line. Edward III was excluded from the succession and the throne went Philip VI Valois, a cousin of the previous king. This succession marked a new ruling family and family name as the Valois family took over for the Capetians who had ruled France since the 800s. Under the Valois family, the rivalry between the French and the English would continue. Philip will attack Gascony, the last of England’s holdings in Aquitaine and push the Scots to invade England as well. Battle of Crecy, August 3, 1346 – The Battle of Crecy was the first huge English victory in the Hundred Years War. It was also a pivotal battle because the English changed their fighting tactics. Instead of using cavalry as their main strike with footmen to back them up, the English fought with longbows at Crecy. The longbows were very big and very fast and they could penetrate armor. Those with longbows stood in the back and shot over their army at the enemies. This not only changed the tactics during battle, but also changed many things about war in general. Unlike cavalry, the poorer people could learn longbow even though it took a while. Furthermore, with this transition to longbows, the idea of capturing nobles and holding them for ransom begins to go away. The death rate in battle went up with this change as well. In addition to spurring a change in battle tactics, this English victory was a shock to the French because they had been previously doing very well at keeping the English out of France. Black Prince – The Black Prince was the son of Edward III. He was a very good warrior so Edward used him to help fight battles during the Hundred Years War. He won a resounding victory in the Battle of Poitiers in 1358. This battle was very symbolic for    the Nationalist Elite Idealism that would be a part of English society in 14 th century. The English were forming a national identity. Eventually, the middle class would begin to get into the ideas of chivalry and the elites would look for ways to further distinguish themselves from those below this. One way that they did this was by adding more ceremony to court; for example, the Order of the Garter was founded in order to reestablish the elites. Black Death, 1349 – In 1349, the Black Death hit England. There were three forms of it and it spread very quickly throughout the population. The plague resulted in a drastic population decline of about 40 percent and it affected all ages of people. The plague accelerated the forces that were already making demesne farming unprofitable. Wages rose and agricultural prices fell because there were fewer people to work, but also fewer people seeking to buy food. Landlords began to turn what were formerly labor services owed into money rents, ending the feudal system requirements. Effects of the plague also showed up in architecture, which, partly the fault of the plague became less grand due to the diminished supply of craftsmen and a lack of revenue. Death imagery become more common in churches and people meditated more on topics including suffering, grief, and the finality of death. Furthermore, one of the greatest impacts of the plague was the full employment that it helped produce due to the depopulation that it caused. Yeoman farmers – Yeoman farmers come about during the period surrounding the Black Death of 1349 and the change in labor and social structure that it helps to cause. Prior to this period, collective farming method was used, in which everyone worked to cultivate land for multiple people. The fields were divided into different areas to farm based on how many workers there were. There were also communal areas. After the plague, there was a shortage of workers, leading to interesting distribution between crops. Thus, at this time, a rise in individual farming can be seen. People began to farm their own land as we do today. They could either rent or purchase land. These people became known as the yeoman farmers. These farmers would eventually become very common throughout England. They represent a change in social status, in which some of the lower classes gain more power. They would continue to become more important as England continued to move away from the old feudal system. Peasants Revolt, 1381 – The Peasant’s Revolt included not only peasants, but other laborers as well. The revolt was fueled by numerous grievances, but sparked by a few events. One such event was legislation made by Parliament to cap wages at what they were pre-1349. They wanted this because wages had been rising due to a shortage of workers. This legislation angered the wage earners and helped to incite their revolt. Another even that incited rebellion was the poll tax, enacted during the minority of Richard II. This tax was not a tax on those with land, but rather a tax that fell on everyone equally. This angers the people because it was unjust and they did not like paying high taxes to support a war that was hopeless. The rebels march on London, but the march was very planned. They did not just destroy the city, but rather assassinated two of the regency council members and sat outside of the city posing a threat. They wanted to meet with the King and negotiate. Wat Tyler and John Ball were in charge of the negotiations. When they are allowed to see the King, the want rent capped, mobility, and a voice in the government. The King agrees, but the Mayor of London killed Wat Tyler. The revolt then disbands and it is almost like it didn’t    happen. The King does not make the changes that he had promised. The peasants do not accomplish much with this revolt except creating fear in the country. They failed because they had no political power and no allies among the gentry, nobility, or the wealthy. However, the government does end the poll tax to prevent further violence. The revolt also may have influence the way that Richard II would approach kingship when he got older. Poll Tax – The Poll Tax was placed in the 1370s during the minority of Richard II on England by a Parliament who was sick of paying for the war in France with the usual taxes, which fell on the propertied class. This tax was not a tax on land, but rather was a tax that fell on all people equally, no matter what their social status. This angers the English populace who do not want to pay this unjust tax, but who also don’t want to pay taxes in support of a war that was hopeless. As this tax was placed by the king’s councilors, ruling during his minority, the people saw the councilors as corrupt, not the king. Thus, the wanted to appeal to him. This poll tax is an inciting incident of the Peasant’s Revolt in which people will march on London and demand that the King should cap rent, grant them mobility, and give them a voice in the government. Although the Peasant’s Revolt was ultimately unsuccessful after it was disbanded, the government did not reinstate the poll tax after the rebels disbanded, in order to avoid further violence. The fight that ensues over this tax demonstrates the tension that was building in the lower classes that wanted the old order to reform itself. John Wycliffe and the Lollards – John Wycliffe was an educated man who followed his own religious beliefs, when were heresy in the eyes of the Roman Catholic Church. He believed that religious belief had to be taken on faith and that God’s will is inscrutable and His power infinite. He emphasized grace and help over man’s free will. After the sandal of the two Popes, when the French and the Italians both want to name a Pope, which made the Church look bad and demonstrated it’s corruption, Wycliffe moved further into heresy. His theory of dominion won him the support of the anticlerical party, led by Richard’s uncle John of Gaunt who protected him. However, Gaunt later deserted him as his ideas got more radical. Lollard was a derogatory term that his followers become known as. Overall, Wycliffe and the Lollards questioned the role of the church as the mediator between the people and God, should the Church fill this role, or should it promote people’s personal relationships with God. This group shows the deep anticlericalism that was growing in England at the time. The questions that they ask will play a large role in the Protestant Reformation that is to come. Anticlericalism – Anticlericalism was a sentiment of discontent with the church and church officials that began to grow in 14th century England. It sprouted from the idea that the Church was corrupt. This idea spread from an increase in personal devotion, but also from crises such as the Avignon Papacy that made the Church look bad and revealed the corruption that existed. At one point during this situation, there were two Popes at once. Those who were part of anticlericalism were against the Church, not against religion itself. They called for reform and questioned what the role of the Church should be. There ideas spread into pop culture at the time such as the Canterbury Tales. Anticlericalism led some people to ideas such as those of John Wycliffe and his followers, the Lollards. Overall, the questions raised during this time would play a role in the Protestant Reformation. This anticlerical sentiment would continue and lead to the years to come leading to the religious changes and religious    Richard took his inheritance. He gained supporters because the lords were worried that if he could block Henry’s inheritance, he would block others. His followers arrest Richard and force him to abdicate, which works because he has no hears. After taking the throne, Henry must decide on what he is going to base his claim on the throne. He can’t rely solely on inheritance because, although he is Edward III’s grandson, there were others who have a stronger claim to the throne and claiming inheritance would cause family problems that he doesn’t want to deal with. He cannot have Parliament make him a king, because there was no king to call Parliament, and, if Parliament makes him a king, then Parliament can take away that kingship. Thus, the claim that Henry decides to make for his family to take the throne is a joint claim of inheritance and conquest, as he defeated the previous king. This action and claim sets a precedent for removing a king from power. The ‘Hero King’ – Henry V took the throne after his father’s death. He would be the “Hero King” as he would have a very good reputation to his contemporaries and to the Elizabethans. He took personal attention to good government and was willing to govern in consensus with his magnates, restoring domestic tranquility to England. He paid back England’s debts and was good at relating to different social classes in order to gain everyone’s support. In addition to being a good governor of the realm, Henry was a good warrior, and dedicated his reign to conquering France. He captures a lot of France and due to his success, is able to march into Paris and make peace terms, including that he would marry the King’s daughter and be named the French heir, even though the French king had a son. However, despite his evident success, his death leaves England in a bad place. He leaves a baby son as heir, meaning that lords would rule for a long minority. Furthermore, he doesn’t leave his French holdings very secure, so the lords, who were not as good militarily, lost everything except Calais. Once he is dead, the dauphin reclaimed the French throne and England was pushed out of France. This is the last major blow in the Hundred Years War. Richard III – Shakespeare’s Monster? – The historical portrayal of Richard III has not been very good. It mostly comes from Shakespeare’s play in which Richard III is a perfect villain. It makes a lot of sense that Richard would be portrayed as the villain, considering that he was the Tudors enemy and the Tudors were in power at the tie that Shakespeare wrote his play. This vile portrayal comes down in the history books written at the time as well. He is portrayed of having physical features such as a hunchback that reflect his bad qualities. However, he may not have been the villain that he was made out to be. The portrayal was probably a piece of Tudor propaganda to justify the accession of the House of Tudor. He probably was responsible for the death of his nephews, but he was only king for two years. Richard wanted to change some things from previous kings. But, the lords are turning against him. In addition, his personal life was miserable as his wife and son both die. When he is killed when Henry Tudor attacks Bosworth Field and Richard is killed, it is the end to a period of British history. It signifies the transition from the medieval period to the Renaissance. Battle Bosworth Field, 1485 – Henry Tudor had inherited the Beaufort claim to the throne through his mother, and although it was an uncertain claim that came through John of Gaunt’s illegitimate children, the growing unpopularity of Richard’s rule made Henry’s chances seem less hopeless. Henry attacks England, where he met with little resistance. In fact, some of Richard’s men put themselves under his command. Henry     marched through Wales and met with Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Because Lord Stanley and his men defected to Henry’s side, Richard was defeated and was killed during the battle. This battle marks the beginning of the Tudor’s rule of England. It also marks the end of a period in British history. After Richard’s death, England moves from the medieval period to the Renaissance. Historical feudal rights – By the time Henry VII comes to the throne, the historic feudal rights are overall mostly obsolete. Some fines are, however, being collected by the king. When Henry takes the throne, he immediately wants and audit to see who owns what and to establish fees. He was attempting to reestablish the separation between social classes and to make the Crown wealthier so that he doesn’t depend on the nobles as much. However, the fact that these rights were mostly obsolete demonstrates the change that society had been going through since the 1300s. It represents the establishment of yeoman farmers and the individual farming system. It also demonstrates that England had, by this point, moved into a new era. Royal Authority – When Henry VII takes the throne, he must reassert royal authority over the nobles, especially since his claim to the throne is fairly weak. He wanted to repair the English monarchy that had fallen apart under Henry VI. He does this by consolidating his power. He also was very active in government even hearing cases himself. He establishes that the King is Supreme Judge and Inventory. He also makes sure that the King is the highest court in the land. The lords must follow it. Furthermore, he works to make himself financially independent so that he had more power and independence. Part of the reason that he is able to accomplish this is that the lords have lost lots of family members, giving him a lot of leeway to do what he wants. Overall, this is a decrease of power for the lords and a continuation of the struggle for power between them and the Crown. It also sets a precedent for the Tudor rule overall, one of power and control. His son Henry VIII, and Henry’s children, especially Elizabeth will follow this precedent in their own rules. Charles HRE/I of Spain – Charles was the ruler of the Holy Roman Empire as well as Spain during the reign of Henry VIII. He was also the nephew of Henry VIII’s first wife Catherine of Aragon. Because of this, he was adamantly opposed to Henry VIII’s desire to put aside Catherine and take a new wife. His power and his pressure on the Pope prevented the Pope from granting Henry the divorce that he wanted so badly, especially after the Emperor’s troops sacked Rome and took the Pope prisoner. Thus, Henry had to look at his other options. The best option most likely would have been to send Catherine to a convent, but if he ended his marriage to Catherine, he would end up at war with Charles. Hence, he starts down the road that will end up splitting England from the Catholic Church. This way, he will be able to officially get rid of Catherine in a way that will make his future children legitimate in his eyes, and become the head of the English Church. Henry’s “Great Matter” – Henry’s “Great Matter” was the matter of getting a son to be his heir. His first wife, Catherine of Aragon, was his wife for a very long time. However, she does not have any sons, only a daughter, Mary. Thus, when Henry takes Anne Boelyn as his mistress and she gets pregnant, Henry’s need to get a son drives his actions. This “Great Matter” will be what leads him to England’s break from Rome. Henry wanted his marriage annulled on the grounds of consanguinity, since Catherine was originally married to his brother. Henry is worried that God is punishing him for    this, because otherwise they would lose their churches. For the first time in England, religious and secular power was officially combined in one person. Dissolution of the monasteries – After Henry VIII broke the Church of England away from the Roman Catholic Church and instated himself as the Supreme Head of the Church in England, he decided to shut down all the monasteries. Henry did so for two major reasons. First, most monastic houses owed allegiance to parent institutions that were located outside of England. After the passage of the Acts of Appeal and the Act of Supremacy, this was unacceptable and illegal. Second, Henry needed money and the English Church owned about 20 percent of the wealth of England at the time and half of that was in the monasteries. He was reluctant to ask Parliament for subsidies, because he wanted other favors, but inflation had begun to cut into his royal income, but the monasteries were ripe for picking. Henry took possession of the monasteries’ wealth and lands. He sold the lands to middle class merchants and Yeoman farmers giving them much more power. He used this money support the English Church and to wage war. It did not make the Crown absolute as it could have. It did, however, further show Henry as being the Supreme Head of the Church. This dissolution will be a problem again when Mary takes the throne and wants to bring England back to Rome. Edward’s Act of Uniformity – Edward VI had a very Protestant education. His lords argue that his father started a move towards Protestantism in breaking with Rome, so Edward should finish it. Eventually Edward becomes more of a radical Protestant himself. He started pushing for these church reforms himself. During his reign, he passes Acts of Uniformity in order to get the English People to follow the state religion. He wants to make the way that people practice the same. The Act of Uniformity required clergymen to use the Book of Common Prayer to unify their practices. The second Act of Uniformity also required people to attend services. It contained punishments for non-conformity and non-churchgoing. This Act furthered the King’s control as the Supreme Head of the Church. It would not be the last time that a monarch would attempt to make everyone in the country follow the same religion. It is characteristic of the religious disagreement that was going on at the time. By Edward’s death, the new liturgy that he had enforced had reinforced Protestant beliefs and though the majority of people were not yet ardently Protestant, they were not ardently Catholic anymore either. 1552 Book of Common Prayer - Edward VI had a very Protestant education. His lords argue that his father started a move towards Protestantism in breaking with Rome, so Edward should finish it. Eventually Edward becomes more of a radical Protestant himself. He started pushing for these church reforms himself. Part of the reforms of his time came in the form of the Book of Common Prayer. Archbishop Cranmer presented the first Book of Common Prayer during Edward’s reign in 1548. It was not Catholic, but was too much like Catholic for the Protestants, and it didn’t bring people together like it was supposed to, although the Act of Uniformity of 1549 required all clergymen to use it. Because it didn’t accomplish what it was supposed to, a Second Book of Common Prayer was put forward in 1552. Martin Bucer, the German theologian, to whom Cranmer had sent the first Prayer Book, influenced it. This version was more radically Protestant than the original. It eliminated a lot of ceremony from the services, under the argument that ceremony distracts from the true   purpose of religion and services. The use of this 1552 version will be enforced by Edward’s Second Act of Uniformity. This Book of Common Prayer would move the country closer towards Protestantism and further enforce the idea that the monarch was the Supreme Head of the English Church. By Edward’s death, the English people were not yet ardently Protestant, but they were not ardently Catholic anymore either. Mary’s Act of Uniformity – When Mary I took the throne, she was an ardent Catholic and wanted to change things in England back to the way that things were 20 years before under her parents. To do this, she tries to slowly bring England back to Catholicism without the Pope, in hopes of eventually bringing England back to the Church of Rome. After she assures Parliament and the lords that the people will not have to return the lands that they had gained with the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII when rejoining Rome, Mary moves forward with turning England Catholic again. She repeals the Act of Supremacy passed by Henry VIII and petitions to Rome for the Pope to be head of the English Church again. Part of this movement back to Catholicism also includes instating both heresy laws as well as an act requiring Catholic Uniformity. This aggravates the religious tensions already present in the country at the time. Mary began charging people with heresy instead of treason and burning them at the stake which is very different from before. This gets out of control, making Mary very unpopular and causes a resurgence of literature and interest in martyrdom. Ultimately, Mary was unsuccessful, although if she had lived longer she may have completed her reforms. However, her push for Catholicism in England gave her a bad name and bloody legacy. It also aggravated the tensions between Catholics and Protestants, leaving Elizabeth, a Protestant a major issue to deal with when she takes the throne. “Elizabethan Settlement” – When Elizabeth took the throne, the first task facing her and her Council was settling the religious question, given that Mary had been attempting to bring England back to Rome. Elizabeth was guided to a religious settlement of religion question by a desire to restore unity among her subjects. Elizabeth knew that she could not choose Roman Catholicism because many of her subjects hated Rome and the legitimacy of her parents’ marriage and her claim to the throne came through the break from the Catholic Church. Therefore, she turned to Protestantism in what is known as the Elizabethan Settlement. With this settlement, she brings back Royal Supremacy, passing an Act of Supremacy and an Act of Uniformity, making Elizabeth head of the Church of England. She required the clergy to use a new Book of Common Prayer, based on the 1552 version, in every parish. This version dealt with ceremony, but not the big theological questions. They attempted to make the Book as broad as possible so many people were comfortable with it. With this settlement, Elizabeth also had to make some decisions. One of those is that religious dissent would be classified as treason and not heresy, which went over better with the people and established Elizabeth as the head of the country. She also had to decide how to deal with the Marian clergy, Catholic clergymen who had gained power under Mary. Elizabeth didn’t get along with them and worked to keep them out of power. Overall, Elizabeth’s settlement made the church function much as it did under her father. This settlement set the tone of her reign, asserting that Elizabeth reigned supreme as her father had. After her death, many of the religious disagreements would grow to become bigger issues again.    release valve to work. England was able to get rid of its extra population and the poor were able to start over in a new area. The colonies also were a release valve for religious tension, as religious dissenters could head to the colonies through means including indenture. These people would shape the future of the colonies. Body Politic – The basic idea of the Body Politic is that society is a body in which the king is the head, providing the thought and action. This was not a new idea in English society, but the Tudors had their own spin on it. The only way that the Body Politic can work is if the body is held together by obedience to lawful authority. For the Tudors, the idea of the “King in Parliament” created lawful authority. This was the idea that the King would work with Parliament, although the King would make the final decision. The idea of the Body Politic manifested in education during the Tudor period. The theory was that people must know how to obey so that they could cooperate. The Body Politic was a hierarchical societal structure, based on relation to the King in the government. It was, however, possible to change positions. It was upon this idea that the Tudors based their government and their policies, with the King as the Supreme Head. “King in Parliament” – The idea of the “King in Parliament” was believed during the Tudor period to be what created lawful authority. The idea of the “King in Parliament” was that the King was the head and the Parliament was the King’s access to information about what was going on. The King was the one who would ultimately make the decision, but he would meet with Parliament. This idea of the “King in Parliament” creating lawful authority was essential to the idea of the Body Politic, which the Tudors were using as their structure of government. The idea of the Body Politic was that society was a body of which the King was the head, providing the thought and action. This body was only held together by the lawful authority granted by the “King in Parliament.” The combination of these two ideas was what the Tudor Kings based their hierarchal society on; the structure was based on relation to the king in the government. It was also how they asserted their supreme authority. The idea of the “King in Parliament” specifically presented a united front, like the king was working with the people, whether or not that was actually true. The Stuarts who followed would not continue with this idea and their distaste for working with Parliament would contribute to their downfall. Divine Right of Kings – While the Tudors ruled England, they operated under the idea of the Body Politic in which the King was the head, operating under the lawful authority granted from working as a “King in Parliament,” where the king would make the ultimate decision, but would meet with Parliament. When James I took the throne, he did not understand the idea of Parliament and didn’t see its necessity. Instead, he operated under the idea of the Divine Right of Kings. This idea was tied to absolutism and meant that the King’s power was given to him by God, thus he had the “divine right” to rule. Under this philosophy, the king can do whatever he wants to do without having to justify it to anyone except God. Since James I operated under this idea, it not only created a shift in the way that the English government functioned, but it created some issues with Parliament, who by this point was used to having some power. The Stuarts who followed James as rulers would continue this trend and it would also ultimately impact their relationships with religious dissenters. In the end, it is the Stuarts inability to work with Parliament and listen to them that contributes to their     downfall. Anglican – Anglican is the term used for the Church of England, established after Henry VIII’s break from Rome. Anglicans had typically enjoyed a lot of power in the government as others were excluded. The idea of whether one was Anglican or a more Puritan form of Protestantism. James I was from Scotland, a country whose major religion was Presbyterianism. The major difference between the Anglican Church and the Presbyterian Church was that the Anglican Church was a hierarchical structure with the bishops in charge, while the Anglican Church didn’t have any. James didn’t like the Presbyterians as he associated them with rebellion. He declared that arguing that there shouldn’t be bishops in the church is like arguing that there shouldn’t be a king in the government. His support of the Anglican Church helped him integrate into being King of England. The Anglicans would run into a lot of issues with other dissenting Protestants. They would play a huge role in the struggles to come. Gunpowder Plot – On November 5, 1605, Guy Fawkes led a small group of radical Catholics in an attack meant to take out the King and Parliament, which would become known as the Gunpowder Plot. The day the plot was planned for was the first day of a new Parliament and the entire House of Lords and House of Commons would be there along with the King. The radicals put gunpowder in the basement of the meeting place. Wanting to save Catholic lives, the radicals warned some of the Catholic lords in Parliament not to come that day; however, some of those lords decided to tell James I about the plot, and the King was able to stop the plot. The people who were involved were horribly executed, but, even though they didn’t succeed, they attempted attack created rumors and fear that there would be another plot like this. When rumors would circulate about Catholic plots, there would be riots in the streets. This would happen about once a decade. This plot does not help the Catholic image and many things were blamed on the Catholics. Because of this plot, there would be added fear and tension between Catholics and Protestants for years to come, adding to the already tense religious disagreements. Recusants – Recusants was a word used to describe people who did not go to church. During the rule of the many of the Tudors and the Stuarts, a person must go to Anglican service a certain number of times a year to hold government office. The word typically described Catholics because dissenting Protestants would still go to services. They just believed that the Church had not been reformed enough. The existence of words like recusants demonstrates the sentiment at the time. It was a society in which the Protestants were very much against those who did not share their beliefs. This fear and hatred was only added to by events such as the Gunpowder Plot. They would play a role in how the religious tensions and debate would unfold during the reigns of the Stuart kings. Petition of Right – The Petition of Right was signed by Charles I in 1628 during the third time that Parliament was called under Charles. It was basically a long list of grievances that Parliament had built up. It put forward things that Parliament believed the King couldn’t do. One of those things was make taxes or force people to pay special loans. The King also should not be able to imprison people without cause or force people to house or feed armies, which was occurring under Charles as a payment he demanded in exchange for not forcing them to quarter soldiers. Furthermore, this document stated that the king could not use martial law against     and government reforms that he didn’t want, so he dissolved it. He then called another Parliament, which would be known as the Long Parliament in 1641. This Parliament would sit for over twelve years. This Parliament would sit through the period that England would be without a King, although there was a point when many of the members would be purged. This Parliament was responsible for a lot of changed in England. They pushed religious reforms that made serve simpler and more comfortable for Puritans and Presbyterians. They would also pass the important Triennial Act, stating that Parliament must be called at least every three years. This created a permanent place for Parliament so that the King could not go eleven years without calling it as Charles had. It was also during the Long Parliament that England saw a Radicalization of the Commons and Laud and Charles’ main finance officer executed under the definition of treason, along with Charles himself. The Parliament would divide over the issues that would come up over the power that Parliament asserted for itself. The actions of the Long Parliament would be very important for what would happen during the years that England had not monarch. Committee of Safety – In 1641, the House of Commons passed a Militia Bill that transferred the control of the militia from the Crown to a Lord General appointed by Parliament. This widened the gap between the royalists and the parliamentarians. Around this same time, the radical Puritans in London gained control of the Common Council and established a Committee of Public Safety to control the city militia. These actions demonstrate just how far Parliament was willing to go to gain power over the country. It was characteristic off the battle that was raging between the king and Parliament for power, and indicative of the New Model Army that Parliament would soon form to take down the king and control the country. Cavaliers – The Cavaliers were one of the groups in the Long Parliament during the reign of Charles I. This group contained more of the nobility, and it was on Charles’ side. The Cavaliers were uncomfortable with the power that Parliament was trying to assert. They wanted a constitutional monarchy and a return to the idea of the “King in Parliament” that was popular during the rule of the Tudors. The Cavaliers got their name from a derogatory term for Catholic sympathizers. They got their support from the North and West, as well as rural areas. Eventually, as Parliament became more and more radical, these members would leave Parliament and join Charles. The actions of the Cavaliers and their fight with the Roundheads, the other group in Parliament, would determine the course of the fighting that was coming, in which the Roundheads would be the victors, ousting Charles and creating an England without a monarch. Roundheads – The Roundheads were one of the groups in the Long Parliament during the reign of Charles I. This group contained fewer lords than the other group, the Cavaliers. They were the more radical group that wanted to completely get rid of Charles. This group got its name from a derogatory term used for Puritans. It got its support from the Southeast and from ports and cities. Eventually, the Roundheads would get the upper hand on the Cavaliers. Their actions would determine the course of England. Eventually, the New Model Army marched on London and forced eleven Presbyterian leaders out. This was the point at which the Roundhead led Parliament really wins. They capture charge and will eventually try and execute him. New Model Army – The New Model Army was put forth by the Militia Bill, so that Parliament would have an army that would match Charles’.
