        "text": "Havent had the energy to do this in a few days. I find it very cathartic after a long or hard, or both day.\n\nEleanor was the eldest of three children of William X, Duke of Aquitaine. Her mother was Aénor de Châtellerault. Aenor's mother Dangereuse de l'Isle Bouchard had children by two men. The first was her only husband, Aenor's father Aimery I, Viscount of Châtellerault. They had five children in seven years, Aenor being the third of their children.\n\nNow for the interesting: William X's father William IX was married to Philippa of Toulouse. Philippa was the heiress of William IV. She bore him two sons, eldest of whom was William X, and five daughters. But William abducted the wife of one of his retainers, and brought her home (got excommunicated for refusing to return her). She was none other then Dangereusse. Dangereusse gave him three children, a son and daughter who became an abyss and monk, and a daughter who wed. These kids were half-siblings to both Eleanor's parents.\n\nEleanor became her father's heir after her younger brother died with their mother. She had a younger sister and half-brother, who recognized by William, as not named heir. Aquitaine was the largest and richest of the French provinces at the time. Her father saw her highly educated.\n\nEleanor was duchess by age 12 or so, when her father died.She was left in the custody of the dying French king, Louis the fat. She was married off to his son the future Louis VII. It was stated though that Aquitaine would remain independent of the crown, to be inherited by her eldest son. In 1152 their marriage was annulled, though their children were declared legitimite despite that. She had born him two daughters. The girls remained in the custody of their father and Eleanor quickly remarried. So did Louis.\n\n-Marie: was married Henry I, Count of Champagne. He was the brother of her second stepmother Adele of Champagne (Louis had three wives, the middle being Constant of Castile. He had 2 children from each wife, and only one son from Adele Philip II). She had been sent to Champagne to be educated prior to her marriage. She bore her husband 2 daughters and 2 sons. Her daughter Marie was the first Latin Empress of Constantinople, married to Baldwin I.\n\n-Alix: also married a brother of her stepmother in her case Theobald V of Blois. She served as his regent for a time and regent for her son in his minority. She and Theobald had seven children, though the first three died young. Her daughter Margaret and granddaughter Mary would both eventually serve as Countess of Blois in their own right.\n\nEleanor married Henry only eight weeks after her annulment. She had been nearly kidnapped twice, once by her future son in Theobald, in attempt to gain her lands by marriage. Henry and Eleanor were married in France with no pomp. She interestingly was more closely related to Henry then Louis (her marriage to Louis was annulled as they were too closely related).\n\nEleanor was arrested for supporting her son Henry in his revolt against his father and spent years imprisoned. Though Eleanor traveled with her husband his remaining years, she remained in custody in England, so never actually freed. When her husband died in 1189, Richard's first act was to send William Marshal to England to free his mother. William found that the person who had been her custodian had already set her free.\n\nIn her last years Eleanor spent a great deal of time with her daughter in Castile. She later traveled Poitiers, her capital, to stop her grandson Arthur of Brittany (son of Geoffrey) to stop him from taking power. Arthur in turn besieged her in a castle. This time it was her son John who came to free her, this time not as easy as after Henry died. John broke the siege against his mother's castle, and captured Arthur who would later die in captivity.\n\nShe took the veil and later died at Fontrevaud abbey. She was buried there with her husband Henry and her son Richard. She outlived all but 2 of her children, John and Eleanor of Castile.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fontevraud_Abbey\n\nShe had eight children with Henry, 5 sons and 3 daughters. All but the eldest reached adulthood.\n\n-William IX Count of Poitiers- he died in infancy\n\n-Henry the young king- Henry contacted dissentary while on campaign against his father and brother Richard. He asked his father to meet him to ask forgiveness before he died but Henry feared a trap, and refused. He had been married to Margaret of France who was the daughter of Eleanor's first husband Louis by his second wife Constance. Margaret would go on to marry Bella III of Hungary following the death of Henry.\n\n-Matilda: married Henry the Lion, Duke of Saxony and Bavaria. They had 4 sons and a daughter. Their son Otto IV became Holy Roman emperor.\n\n-Richard- Richard the Lionheart. Married to Berrengaria of Navarre. They had no children. He spent most of his reign on crusade, and a prisoner who John reluctantly ransomed. He was killed in France.\n\n-Geoffrey-Geoffrey was married to Constance of Brittany. Henry had forced her father Conan to abdicate in favor of Constance when she was five, so Geoffrey became Duke of Brittany on marriage.Geoffrey often campaigned against his father, and was a close friend of Philip II of France. He died in Paris. His half sister Marie who he was close to attended the funeral. He was the father of Arthur of Brittany who besieged his grandmother.\n\n-Eleanor: one of two who survived her mother. She married Alfonso VIII of Castile. Eleanor was the only daughter of her mother who had her mother's political influence in life. She bore her husband 12 children, though 4 died young and a fifth died at 13. Her children included Blanche who married Louis VIII of France (Louis was a grandson of Eleanor of Aquitaine's first husband).\n\n-Joan: married William II of Sicily and later Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse. Raymond's great-grandfather was the brother of Eleanor's great grandfather William IX of Toulouse. Her first marriage was childless. Instead of annulling it, William named his aunt Constance his heir. Instead his bastard cousin Tancred seized the throne and Joan's dowry as well. Richard though arrived and demanded the return of his sister, and her dowry which Tancred eventually did. She married Raymond and bore him two children Raymond VII and a daughter Joan. She fled to France, where died at the same convent her mother did, after giving birth to a son Richard. She was veiled shortly before death. Richard lived only long enough to be baptized. She was buried at the abbey like her mother. Died 5 months after Richard.\n\n-John: youngest son and known as Lackland. Prince John of Robin Hood fame, he ruled in Richard's place when he was on campaign. He was the one who signed the Magna Carta. He was married twice, both wives named Isabella. His first was Isabella of Gloucester He had their marriage annulled soon after becoming king. His second marriage was to Isabella of Angouleme. Isabella was mother of his five children (she later had children with her second husband as well). Henry III, Joan of Scotland and Isabella who married Emperor Frederick II were among them. Isabella's daughter from her second marriage Margaret, married John's nephew Raymond VII of Toulouse.\n\nApril 13 1275- death of Eleanor of England, Countess of Leicester\n\nEleanor was the youngest daughter of King John and his second wife Isabella of Angouleme. At the time of her birth London was controlled by the French, her mother was in disgrace, and her father had been forced to sign the Magna Carta. She never met her father who died in 1216, when she was only a year old. After the death of her father, her brother became Henry III. Henry was only eight at the time of the death of their father.\n\nThe only lands loyal to the crown at the time of her father's death were the Midlands. In the North the barons ruled, and the south was still controlled by the French. The royalists though, including the North eventually, were rallied behind Eleanor's brother by William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. William had served the court during the reign of Henry II, Richard and John (he had in fact been sent by Richard to free his mother Eleanor from her imprisonment after the death of Henry II). He now rallied to the aid of the new young king, helping to defeat the forces of Louis the Lion, and drive the French out of London. He was later appointed to the regency counsel.\n\nBefore his death in 1219, William saw to the engagement of his son William to Princess Eleanor. At the time of their betrothal Eleanor was 4 and William was 29. He was a widower, his first wife Alice of Bethune had died some time between 1215. She was the daughter of his father's ally Baldwin of Bethune. He had no children with his wife. His mother was Isabel de Clare, 4th Countess of Pembrook. His sister Maud would be the ancestor of five of Henry VIII's consorts. He arranged the marriage of his sister Isabel to Eleanor's brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall.\n\nThe couple were married April 23, 1224 when Eleanor was only 9, and her husband was 34 at temple church in London. Her husband died April 6, 1231, 17 days before their 7th anniversary. Eleanor was widowed at 16, and the marriage was childless. Her husband's title passed to the first of his younger brothers. Though William Marshall senior had five sons, the male line of his family died out. All five sons became Earl of Pembroke, and none had a son to follow them. The estates were later split between his four daughters, or their heirs.\n\nEleanor had brought 10 manors and 200 pounds per year to her marriage. By right she should have been allowed to retain 1/3 of the estate when her husband died. Unfortunately her husband's brother Richard seized the entire estate, selling much of her dowry to pay William's debts. Eleanor would spend years trying to reclaim what had been taken by him.\n\nEleanor took a vow of chastity before the Archbishop of Canterbury. This became a bit of a sticky issue seven years later.\n\nEleanor fell in love with Simon de Montford, 6th Earl of Leicester. Simon was said to have been drawn to her beauty and elegance as well as her position. Unlike her much older first husband, Simon was only 7 years her senior. Simon's father was a French nobleman and crusader, and his mother Alix de Montmorency. Simon was the middle of his father's three sons. His father had lost his English title, after King John lost Normandy. The estate had been placed in the hands of a distant cousin Ranulf, Earl of Chester. Simon's older brother Amaury in failing to claim Leicester for himself, passed his rites to his brother Simon instead. Simon came to England with little knowledge of the country but he impressed Henry III with his French. He eventually convinced the childless Ranulf to make him Earl of Leicester (took 7 years).\n\nSimon and Eleanor were married in secret at the king's chapel at Westminster in 1238. Eleanor was 23 and Simon was 30. It was controversial since she had taken a vow of chastity. Her brother claimed he had only approved the marriage as Simon had seduced his sister. Due to her vow, Simon took a pilgrimage to Rome to gain the pope's blessing of their union.\n\nSimon was killed during the Second Baron's war. Simon had seized control and become the de facto ruler of England, but later many barons switched sides and became royalists. Simon and his son were killed after being defeated at the battle of Evesham in 1265. Eleanor fled to France where she joined the convent at Montargis Abbey. The abbey had been founded by her husband's sister Amicia. Eleanor died there ten years after her husband and was buried there. She was well treated even in exile by her brother, who allowed her to retain her income, and some of her husband's lands. And when she died her will was not contested.\n\nHer and her husband had seven children:\n\n-Henry: died with his father at the Battle of Evesham at 27. He was killed in front of his father before his father later died.\n\n-Simon: was slow to join his dad and brother at the Battle, and arrived after it ended, to find his father's head on a pike. He and his brother Guy later went into exile in France and Italy. They famously murdered their cousin Henry of Almain. He died the same year he killed Henry, said to have died cursed by god, a fugitive.\n\n-Amaury: was a priest. He had gone into exile with his mother and siblings to France. As a papal chaplain he accompanied his sister to Wales. They were intercepted by the English and imprisoned. Unlike his sister who was treated gently, and eventually married at the king's expense, Amaury was held in horrid conditions. He was eventually freed thanks to the aid of both the Pope and his brother in law. He returned to France after released (he spent 7 years in prison). He died eventually in Italy, after giving up his clerical career shortly before.\n\n-Guy: was imprisoned during the battle which saw the death of his father and Henry. He later escaped with the aid of Simon, and was involved in the murder of their cousin Henry. In 1287 he was captured by the Sicilian army and died in prison. Unlike his older brothers, Guy did marry. Guy married Margherita Aldobrandesca, the Lady of Sovana and had two daughters. His daughter Anastasia married Romano Orsini, a Roman senator. The marriage was arranged by Cardinal Napoleon Orsini who had been guardian of her Margherita. Anastasia as her mother's eldest child inherited her vast estate. Through Anastasia, Guy was the ancestor of Elizabeth Woodville (wife of Edward IV). Anastasia's great-great granddaughter Margaret of Baux was the grandmother of Jacquetta of Luxembourg.\n\n-Joanna: died in infancy\n\n-Richard: died in 1281. Seems to have not married.\n\n-Eleanor: was married by proxy to Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. She and her brother Amaury though were captured on their way to Wales. She was a prisoner at Windsor for three years, though unlike her brother, she was treated well. She died giving birth to her only child in 1282, months before her husband died. Gwenllian of Wales was confined in a priory where she died 54 years later.\n\nEleanor's only descendants would come from the daughters of Guy."
