        "text": "I'm reading Carr's The Red Prince at the moment and had this passing thought. In 1348, Joan, the second daughter of Edward III of England, was due to be married to Pedro I of Castile. Indeed, she was on her way to Castile when she caught the Black Death and died in Bordeaux.\n\nBut let's say she doesn't. Perhaps, ITTL, she doesn't break her journey at plague-infested Bordeaux, but sails straight to Castile.\n\nWhat changes if Pedro and Joan are married in the summer of 1348? Does having a wife from a younger age temper Pedro? Does it save his throne, long-term? And do the English push France harder in 1350 if the Castilians are with them, not against? Do they succeed in forcing the French to at least accept them holding Aquitaine in full sovereignty, free of any feudal dues?\n\nI haven't really given this a great deal of thought, but I'd love to hear other's ideas.\n\nShe'd still end up deposed when Henry Trastamara tries to seize the throne. Is she fertile? If she is, a son could possibly help\n\nWell, if her mother is anything to go by, she will be, yes.\n\nAnd then after Pedro is overthrown, said so escapes to England and later attempts to retake the throne.\n\nA son would probably have more luck than John and Constance, just because of his gender...\n\nOoh, any thoughts to share?\n\nWell England not getting super involved in Castile would be good so it would be nice if Joan gives Pedro a son who neatly succeeds his father. Also, no involvement in Castile probably means that the Black Prince doesn't get dysentery and so lives a little longer, though with a POD in 1348 I think him dying his OTL death would be a little bit of a stretch anyways.\n\nAlso, the Trastamaras were French allies so the French have one less friend out there, meaning their performance in this stage of the HYW probably suffers.\n\nThese were the children I gave them in my family trees for a TL with this POD:\n\nPedro I of Castile m. 1348 Joan of England\n\n1) Constanza of Castile (b. 1351, d. ?) m. John I, King of Aragon (b. 1350)\n\n2) Beatriz of Castile (b. 1352, d. ?) m. Nuño Díaz de Haro, Lord of Lara and Biscay (b. 1348)\n\n3) Alfonso XII, King of Castile (b. 1354, d. ?) m. Eleanor of Aragon (b. 1358)\n\n4) Isabel of Castile (b. 1356, d. ?) m. Ottone Paleologus, Marquess of Montferrat (b. 1358, d. ?)\n\n5) Fernando of Castile (b. 1358, d. 1359)\n\n6) Maria of Castile (b. 1361, d. ?) m. Charles III, King of Navarre\n\nI like yours better than mine, although I wonder whether Joan and Edward would try and secure a match between one of Joan's kids and Angouleme/Richard of Bordeaux...\n\nI feel like it would be harder for Enrique to get as much support for his grab at the throne if Pedro had a male heir. Even if he still manages to kill Pedro and take the crown, Joan will probably get her big brother Edward down from Aquitaine to defend her son's rights.\n\nI suspect that at least some of the aristocracy may be inclined to depose Pedro in favor of elevating Pedro and Joan's son to the throne. Hell, Enrique may support such a move so long as he's regent.\n\nI am not sure who the Church would be already amenable to first cousins matches at this point\n\nYeah, this marriage seems unlikely for a whole lot of reasons. First cousin marriages were pretty common in Iberia, but much rarer in England. Plus the Black Prince may have learned a lesson the controversy surrounding his own marriage to a first cousin, once removed. And what diplomatic benefit would Edward III or the Black Prince get from this arrangement that isn't already available to this from Joan's marriage?\n\nBoth Aragon and Navarre have princesses available if England wants to double down on Iberian relations in ATL.\n\nI suspect that at least some of the aristocracy may be inclined to depose Pedro in favor of elevating Pedro and Joan's son to the throne.

Maybe one of Joan's daughters can marry John of Portugal instead of Phillippa of Lancaster?\n\nAnd would Joan accept Enrique as Regent, even if she goes along with her husband's deposition? This is Isabella, She-Wolf of France's granddaughter we're talking about, after all. Would she not want to be Regent herself?\n\nA son would probably have more luck than John and Constance, just because of his gender...\n\nWell, any child Pedro had with Joan would probably do much better than his OTL issue, since even setting aside the fact Pedro had only daughters, said children were also probably illegitimate (I mean, sure, Pedro claimed they were legitimate, but everybody knew that he was already married when this supposed 'marriage' to Maria de Padilla was contracted). Enrique's OTL 'claim' looks better when it's clear that the successor to Pedro will be a bastard no matter who gets it.\n\nAn unquestionably legitimate child of Pedro would be a little harder to get rid of than his OTL kids.\n\nI am not sure who the Church would be already amenable to first cousins matches at this point\n\nI mean, Pedro himself was a product of double first cousins, so I'm not sure how much that holds true. I know Popes have tried to annul earlier consanguineous marriages in Iberia (didn't Maria of Molina have to work to get a dispensation saying her children were legitimate because the Pope deemed the marriage illegitimate?), but I don't know if anybody (be they Pope or no) put up a fuss about Alfonso XI's marriage to Maria of Portugal (besides Alfonso himself, of course), or doubted Pedro's legitimacy because of it.\n\nWhether this has any bearing on the proposed matches, I have no idea, but it's just something to think about."
