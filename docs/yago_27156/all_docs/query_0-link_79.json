        "text": "This paper looks at over one hundred marriages between the upper echelons of English society and those born abroad; the so-called aliens during the thirteenth century. Part One sets out who these alien husbands and wives were and the impetus for the various waves of marriages. It considers both alien brides and grooms. It also looks at the areas from whence came the alien marriage partners. . Where it is possible, an assessment of who promoted the marriages over the century has been made. Part Two looks at the mechanisms by which these alien marriages were achieved. It considers the context of alien marriages before and after Magna Carta which brought, in theory, more protection to potential spouses. Resistance to proposed marriage partners is set out as well as a consideration of the problems associated with the re-marriage of widows. This Part also searches for evidence as to the success or failure of alien marriages particularly in relation to where the partners chose to be buried, their gifts of piety in favour of their partners and displays of shared allegiance on their armorial seals and documents. Finally it consider sthe impact of these alien marriages on English political, social and cultural life.\n\nThis article’s main aim is to summarise the crucial period of the reign of King John of England during so-called first barons’ war of 1215–1217 and through the examination of contemporary sources show possible attitudes to the invasion of Prince Louis of France in 1216, when he was invited by English barons to become their new king, which eventually turned to the usurpation when King John died and his son Henry became the King of England with support of those who had been adherents of Louis before. In June 1215, English barons persuaded King John to agree with terms of Magna Carta, limiting royal power in various branches of law. When Magna Carta was proclaimed null and unlawful by Pope Innocent III allowing John not to be bound by its terms, it meant open war with English rebels. They negotiated an invasion of Prince Louis, the eldest son of Philip II, the King of France, and they promised him a crown of England. In October 1216, King John suddenly died in the middle of war and he was succeeded by his son Henry. Henry III was in relatively short time accepted by most of rebellious barons leaving Louis in very precarious situation and it eventually led to Louis’ defeat in 1217. The treaty of Lambeth (September 1217) ended this war with Plantagenets still on English throne\n\nLusignan is a well-known name in crusades history for it is associated with the fall of Jerusalem and the loss of a major part of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the presence of the Lusignans in the history of the crusades cannot be reduced to the part played by Guy and by the dynasty born of his brother Aimery who succeeded him on the throne of Cyprus. To understand why Guy became king of Jerusalem, it is important to recognize the roots of his family's engagement in the crusades two, and perhaps four, generations before him. We can see their participation in expeditions to Spain, in the First and Second Crusades and an involvement in the county of Tripoli where the family was linked to the comital house and could stake a claim to the inheritance. These elements help to shed new light on the baronial struggle at Baldwin IV's court and on the conflict between Guy and Count Raymond of Tripoli. Besides, during the few months Guy was king, he made use of his family to strengthen his position therein. After the Battle of Hattin, the Lusignans tried to recover from this disaster, in part through the writings of Peter of Blois, but mainly through the heroic actions of a further member of the family, the newly arrived Geoffrey. This article will also showcase the involvement of other Lusignan generations of France and England during the crusades and set out why they deserve to be called \"a crusader lineage.\""
