        "text": "When blessed with a baby, you want their name to have a stylish sound and contemporary elements while being rooted in heritage. Bengali baby names carry a profound cultural heritage and rich linguistic significance. These names from the land of Bengal reflect the region's history, diverse traditions, and vibrant customs. Bengali names are perfect examples of ones that blend the traditional and the modern. Bengalis believe that the name of a child depends on their character. Hence, they select names inspired by gods and goddesses, influential figures, human values, and nature. Some parents also choose names that reflect their hopes and aspirations for their children. In the vibrant Bengali culture, it is customary for individuals to have two names: an official name recorded on their birth certificates and a cherished ‘daak naam’ or ‘calling name,’ deeply ingrained in their identity. This daak naam is used by relatives or family members to address them. In West Bengal, particularly among Hindus, it is common to have both a first and last name and a daak naam or nickname, which is not formalized in official documents. Similarly, in Bangladesh, Bengali nicknames are prevalent within families and social circles, while Muslim official names are used for legal documentation and formal introductions (1). The surnames of Bengalis reflect their sub-clan groupings, caste identities, and family background. Naamkaran, or the naming ceremony, is an essential tradition in every Indian community, and even Bengalis conduct it with utmost sincerity. It is mainly observed on the 21st day of the baby’s birth, with a grand celebration. With a blend of Hindu, Muslim, and other influences, Bengali names evoke a sense of timelessness and beauty. From the land of Rabindranath Tagore, we have brought you an extensive list of beautiful Bengali baby names with meanings.
