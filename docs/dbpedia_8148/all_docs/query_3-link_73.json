        "text": "If you watch my instagram stories, you know I LOVE heading to the local farmers market every Saturday morning. I love walking around and meeting all the small shop owners + farmers with each and every purchase.\n\nI find it super important to shop local. WHY?\n\nImprove local economy\n\nSupporting another entrepreneurs hard work\n\nSupporting your community (money also stays within your community)\n\nBetter customer service + personalized service\n\nShopping local helps environment; less food miles reduces fossil fuels + emissions\n\nSo typically when I head to the market I stock up on veggies for the week, some Griggstown eggs + turkey burgers and I satisfy those pregnancy cravings with Mishti Chocolate, an organic + local small shop. They have the most delicious lavender chocolate bars – you must try them!\n\nCheck out my interview below with the owner of Mishti Chocolate, Puneet Girdhar.\n\nSo what does MISHTI stand for?\n\nPuneet: Mishti is our elder daughter’s name. It means sweet in one of the Indian languages.\n\nSo sweet! Why did you decide to create Mishti chocolate?\n\nPuneet: Mishti was created after our Mishti was born. Mishti our elder daughter was born with a lot of allergies and dairy was one of the biggest of all. I wanted to share my passion and taste for chocolate with her and create something that is not just good to taste but also has fine quality ingredients.\n\nI love that! Every child deserves to eat chocolate haha. What do you currently sell?\n\nPuneet: So far we sell 14 different types of chocolate bars (ranging from vegan milk to 100% dark chocolate) and hot chocolate mix.\n\nFlavors include moon light, coffee, toffee, dark night, dark moon, cocktail, lavender, mango, pineapple, ginger + more!"
