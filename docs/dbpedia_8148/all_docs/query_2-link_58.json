        "text": "This soft-as-a-cloud ball of chhana (cottage cheese) dripping with sugar syrup is the stuff of sweet dreams for both Bengal and Odisha. In Kolkata, the rosogolla has a legion of fans and everyone lays claim to their local favourites. In 2017, the “Banglar rasogolla” even received its own GI tag. Said to have been invented in the late 1800s, the rosogolla has been at the centre of several debates over the years. Should it be spongy or soft? How much sugar syrup is too much? Was the sweet invented in Kolkata or Odisha? The last question even led to a major argument between West Bengal and Odisha, ending with the rosogolla from both states receiving their separate GI tags.\n\nIrrespective of who made it first, the sweet holds a special place in the hearts of Kolkata locals. We spoke to the city's top food experts to find out which sweet shops make the best rosogolla in town.\n\nBest rosogolla in Kolkata\n\nNani Lal Ghosh, Hatibagan\n\n“Despite being a Bengali, I surprisingly don't have much of a sweet tooth. But being born and bred in Kolkata, I do hold a soft spot for certain Bengali sweets in my heart. One of my fondest memories is of Nani Lal Ghosh (45, Durgacharan Mitra Street, Hari Ghosh St, Manicktala, Darjipara, Shobhabazar; call 3325547374), a sweet shop in north Kolkata. As a child, I used to live in that neighbourhood and would often stroll over to the sweet shop to have rosogollas. To me the best rosogolla in Kolkata is made by my father but the sweet shop is special to me because of all the memories I associate with it.” Toonika Guha, content professional and writer\n\nKotal's Satyanarayan, Tollygunge\n\n“The nolen gurer bacchabjog at Kotal’s Satyanarayan (19A, Chandi Ghosh Rd, Kudghat, Ashok Nagar, Tollygunge; call 8902483331) is fantastic. They are just the right balance between spongy and chewy. They also have a kheer filling in the centre, which is called kheerer guti. It’s like a little surprise rosogolla inside. The three-generation old shop is very famous in Tollygunge and Moore Avenue and the bacchabogs are priced at just Rs15.” Malini Banerjee, food and travel writer\n\nSuresh Mistanna Bhandar, Dhakuria\n\n“This is the shop whose sweets I grew up eating, so I admit that I like it for the nostalgia more than anything else. They are known more for their mishti doi and rasmalai, so much so that even Prajesh Nandy of Nakur has heard of them and generously recommends them despite being in the hall of fame of mishtis in Bengal. Suresh Mistanna Bhandar (Shop 7, Sarat Ghosh Garden Road, Dhakuria; call 9836876365) sweets tend to be on the sweeter side of the spectrum but most don’t complain. If you happen to head towards Babu Bagan lane via Dhakuria station, you are bound to be stuck in the lane just in front of Suresh because someone got off the car and went on a mishti spree. They are so busy that they still haven’t bothered with being on Swiggy or Zomato.” Malini Banerjee, food and travel writer\n\nKC Das, Esplanade\n\n“KC Das is the one place you cannot escape mentioning when you’re talking about Kolkata and rosogolla,” says food writer Poorna Banerjee. Nobin Chandra Das of the Das family is believed to have invented the sweet in Kolkata. Today, KC Das is run by his great-grandson Dhiman Das. “The problem with the rosogolla initially was that they would taste good but they could not be squeezed. The texture was such that your fingers would just break through the rosogolla. Nobin Chandra Das added elements that would make the rosogolla more spongy so that when people are having it, they have the option of squeezing some of the sugar water out,” Banerjee explains. “In Kolkata, customisations and individual tastes matter. So, everybody will want to squeeze the rosogolla to a certain point, to retain the perfect amount of chachni in the rosogolla.”\n\nChittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar, Shyambazar Street\n\nThe 115-year-old Chittaranjan Mistanna Bhandar is among the shops in the city that are certified to sell Kolkata’s GI-tagged rosogolla. “The good thing about the rosogolla at Chittaranjan is that the taste hasn’t changed at all over so many years,” says food writer and photographer Anindya Basu. “It’s more than a 100-year-old mishtir dokan and anyone who has had the rosogolla even fifty years back would get the same taste. It’s perfectly spongy but not crumbly. They get the texture just right— it’s soft, spongy and not overly sweet.”\n\nGokul Sweets, Lord Sinha Road\n\nWhile many Kolkata locals can’t stand the sight of flavoured rosogolla, Saloni Jhunjhunwala, owner of The Salt House, recommends the kesar pista rosogolla at Gokul Sweets. “Gokul is a favourite with the Marwari community in Kolkata,” she explains. “The rosogolla is flavoured with kesar and stuffed with chopped pistachio. It’s different from the usual ones, but sometimes a change is needed.”"
