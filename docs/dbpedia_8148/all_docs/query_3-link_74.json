        "text": "Mishti. Five months old. Born with clubbed\n\nfoot (foot twisted out of shape). Born to Puja\n\nand Manoj Thakur of Metiabruz (earning\n\nRs.1200 a week). ‘Ab to zindagi bhai aise hi\n\njeena hoga’ was their resigned\n\nacknowledgement. Until they encountered\n\nTeam GRIRR. An NGO focused on\n\nrehabilitating children in need of\n\nphysiotherapy. GRIRR assured the parents that\n\nthe problem was indeed correctable. GRIRR\n\nadvised and oversaw Mishti being put in a\n\nplaster cast followed by relevant\n\nphysiotherapy and CTEV cast. Soon Mishti will\n\nbe absolutely normal. Her mother blessed the\n\nGRIRR team: ‘Bhogoban tomader bhaalo\n\nrakhbe’. The remarkable thing was that the\n\ndifference between hopelessness and\n\noptimism was a treatment cost of only Rs 5000. A lot can be done with little – if we care. If you\n\nshould seek to find prospective cases of this kind, call Nazim at 98315 17499"
