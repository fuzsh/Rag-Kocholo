        "text": "Dining out is often about celebrating the little big things in life, isnâ€™t it?\n\nThere was a time when many of our celebrations like â€˜signed-up-for-the-marathonâ€™-day, â€˜just-broke-up-with-the-jerkâ€™-day and â€˜finally-put-in-my-papersâ€™-day would take place at Howrah, a small, old-timer housed in the open verandah of the legendary Hotel New Bengal near Fort. Cheap (used to be Rs.150 for an unfinishable Non-Veg Thali a few years ago), accessible (we could slip out of Times of India and still make it back for the dreaded post-lunch presentationâ€¦ yawn!) and truly authentic, with a College Street canteen feel. Given that there were hardly any other Bengali restaurants in the city, the only other option was to emotionally blackmail Mom into coming to Mumbai and have her cook you all your favourite dishes ðŸ˜‰\n\nThings have changed quite a bit in the last decade or so. People today dine out more for a taste adventure, new food, or exciting dining experience. Unlike then, the options for Bengali food are now a-plenty. Andâ€¦ Mom doesnâ€™t need to be blackmailed ðŸ™‚\n\nThe non-stop nagging by Mumbai friends (you know who you are, peeps!) to cook them Shorshe Pabda, Ilish Paturi, Luchi and Begoon Bhaja must have reached a sizeable crescendo for food entrepreneurs. Anjan Chatterjee of Oh! Calcutta spread out far n wide from the one outpost in Tardeo, and Soumitra Ghosh launched his chain of Bengali street food called Hangla which goes beyond the realm of the â€˜Calcutta Rollâ€™. Several other noteworthy places joined the bandwagon, like the generous and hearty Bhojohori Manna, the far-away Peetuk which possibly serves the cityâ€™s best Calcutta-style Biryani, the refurbished Bong Bong with its mouth-watering curries, the next-on-my-list Boda and Ithi, and the latest glittering arrival, 25 Parganas, at Hotel Sahara Star.\n\nAs one of Indiaâ€™s top entrepreneurs and head of the mutli-faceted Sahara Group, Subroto Roy must have heard the collective rumblings of Bong and non-Bong stomachs too. On a grueling business trip to New York, one taste of ace Chef Prasenjitâ€™s specially prepared Bengali food convinced him about the need for an exclusive Bengali restaurant in Mumbai.\n\nThe idea was to showcase the best of Bengali cuisine, in a trendy yet traditional, classy yet homely ambiance, to appease the ever-growing population of Bong-food lovers of the city, and whet the appetites of those who have never tasted Bong food before (poor souls, I say!) So, â€™25 Parganasâ€™ was born, an imaginary 25th district of West Bengal, but a very real food destination for seriously good, authentic Bengali dishes.\n\nChef Prasenjit at the helm has spent 14 long years in New York, and for those who know their epics, this â€˜vanvaasâ€™ was no cakewalk either! But as all great and inspiring food stories go, he proved his mettle there returning victorious to the fold to rediscover his roots through what he knows bestâ€¦ food! And his menu at 25 Parganas reflects that rediscovery as you journey through Bengal, savouring the delicate yet distinctive spice profiles that it has to offer!\n\nLike a good, food-loving Bong (is there any other kind???) I started where it matters â€“ with the â€˜Bhajaâ€™ or the â€˜Friedâ€™ starters.\n\nThe â€˜Beet Boraâ€™, the Chefâ€™s light n crisp take on the quintessential sweet-spicy â€˜Vezitebil Chopâ€™ that is available literally everywhere in Kolkata, is a must try with â€˜Kasundiâ€™, as is the pan-fried â€˜Posto Narkel Boraâ€™ (Poppy seed and Coconut Patties), which in its delicious avatar here is the vegetarianâ€™s answer to the Shami Kabab prayer! My fingers kept inching back to it, despite the aromatic and inventive Steamed Seafood and Steamed Mustard Chicken Dumplingsâ€¦\n\nThe main course arrived with a flourish of loaded plates. My personal â€˜Litmus Testâ€™ Kosha Mangsho (Dry Mutton Curry) was good, but a bit toned down, probably to suit the non-Bong palate, confirmed by a vigorously nodding, happy Teddy opposite me.\n\nThe traditional Shorshe Ilish (Mustard Hilsa) was sublime, with the right hit of mustard and green chilly, and Teddyâ€™s ultimate favourite Daab Chingri (Prawns Cooked inside a Tender Coconut) was deliciously divine! There were platefuls of Jhuri Aloo Bhaja (Crisp Fried Finely Sliced Potato) and Begoon Bhaja (Deep Fried Brinjal Roundels) to complement the traditional Cholar Dal and aromatic â€˜Gobindo Bhogâ€™ Rice. As I poked a plump Radha Bollobhi (Puri stuffed with Moong), the Chef placed a tasting bowl in front of usâ€¦ the painstaking delicacy called Mochar Ghonto (Minced Banana Flower), which has been many a new Bengali brideâ€™s undoing â€“ legend has it that a test of true cooking skills of a new, blushing bride would be how fine (Mihi) she could chop the Banana Flower with a â€˜Botiâ€™, a unique and frankly scary kitchen cutter that pre-dates the knife by hundreds of years!\n\nSteering firmly clear of memories of my own not-very-happening tryst with the said Boti, I jumped straight into the desserts â€“ a freshly-made Nolen Gur Icecream with a drizzle of liquid jaggery thatâ€™s just pure ecstasy, followed by some creamy Chhanar Payesh (Cottage Cheese Dumplings in thick, sweet flavoured milk), and the very essence of a Bong â€“ a pot of Mishti Doi!\n\nAs a last bow, the Chef walked in with two shot glasses of a suspicious, green liquid. And until we picked it up gingerly and quaffed it down, we had no idea that it was liquid Paan! What a stylish, clever and uncommon way of serving the countryâ€™s most common digestive!\n\nThat last experience with the Paan shots is what pretty much sums up 25 Parganas. The pricing maybe at par with 5â€“star hotels, but the food is surprisingly non-5 star, rising above the ordinary and deliciously fulfilling. Itâ€™s like going back to a renovated and refurbished home â€“ the walls may have changed colours, the furniture may have been spruced up and the kitchen may look swanky with an induction and chimney hood. But the food that comes out of it is still what Mom cooks, and the house still has that same unmistakable and familiar aroma of homeâ€¦\n\nMaha Ashtami evening was a glittering affair. Crowds everywhere, in their best new clothes and dazzling jewellery, were out in very large numbers, praying to the Goddess at the pandals, thronging the food stalls, and lapping up all the entertainment programs lined up specially for this night.\n\nMusic director Pritam, riding the wave of his recent super-hit film Barfi!, which had some really fresh and hummable melodies, rocked the stage at Juhu, which Rani Mukherjee, herself having created quite a stir with her last week release of Aiyya, has been passionately promoting. The Shakti Samanta Puja had Miss Jojo, the pop queen of Kolkata, live on stage. A celebrated singer for her husky, attitude-laden renditions of peppy numbers, her song selections were clearly not well thought out. Celine Dionâ€™s â€˜My heart will go onâ€™ is definitely a misfit in the Durga Puja ethos!\n\nYesterday was Nabami, the day the Goddess is worshiped as Aparajita (the undefeated) after vanquishing the demons. A sultry day brought a sudden burst of unexpected rains in the evening, and pandal-hoppers scurried for the inadequate covers of the Puja canopies. Soaked they may be to the skin, but the spirits did not dampen. So when the grand diva with the booming voice, Usha Uthup, hit the stage in (surprisingly rainless!) Bandra, people flocked in from all parts of the city to listen to her belt out numbers like Kolaveri D, Hai Ye Maya from Don 2 and Senorita from Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. And when she switched to high gear with Apadi Podu, most of the 2000 plus adoring crowd were on their feet, a common sight at her concerts everywhere!\n\nThe day was peppered with several interesting â€˜addaâ€™ sessions (the favourite Bengali pastime of chatting, debating and discussing endlessly about everything under the sky!). One was back-stage with Usha (didi) where she was happy to reveal the secret behind her beautifully embroidered Mojarisâ€¦ she was wearing Reebok running shoes that she had herself styled into traditional footwear to match her gorgeous Saris! Well, considering I still wear a Dupatta exclusively designed by her (part of a limited-edition music merchandise collection at Planet M, the music store), I am not surprised at her many talents ðŸ™‚\n\nAnother chat was with the trio of ace pandal-hoppers Sumanto, Alison and Deepika over platefuls of Hot Mutton Curry and Rice, several delicious parcels of Bhetki Paturi and some really creamy Mishti Doi.\n\nIt was great bumping into the â€˜twinâ€™ brothers Supratik and Sumonto (I canâ€™t help it if you guys look so alike, can I?), full of new ideas and enthusiasm to make their Puja bigger and better.\n\nAnd then there was the Rochelle and Ferrero Rocher adda session at Kalyan (Fine Chopped) and Kainazâ€™s place with Kurush, Rhea, Bonny and Jeet joining in a zesty discussion on the freaky similarities between the Parsi and Bengali communities, and the quirkiness of devotional songs, sometimes completely lost in translation! (song â€˜Mere sapne mein aai Mahamaiâ€™)\n\nToday is Vijaya Dashami â€“ the last day of the Puja, when the Goddess leaves for her heavenly abode via a symbolic water immersion. Plans are on for a last afternoon Bhog at one of the pandals and a quick round up of the Puja this year. Might just throw in a few more fun facts and tidbits for yâ€™all to nibble on ðŸ˜‰ Stay tuned!"
