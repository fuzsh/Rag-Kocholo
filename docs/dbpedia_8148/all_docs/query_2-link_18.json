        "text": "The Calcutta High Court has recently observed that public rallies and meetings are as inextricable from Bengal's culture as delicacies such as mishti doi (sweet curd), aloo posto, and luchi (Indian bread).\n\nA division bench of Chief Justice TS Sivagnanam and Justice Hiranmay Bhattacharya while allowing a rally by government employees voicing concerns regarding their dearness allowance (DA) payments orally nor:\n\n\"Undoubtedly Mishti doi (sweet curd), luchi (bread), and aloo posto are an inextricable part of Bengal's culture, and so it appears public rallies, meetings, etc are all part of Bengal's culture. It is the opinion of one of us (CJ) that every Bengali is a born orator. A state filled with culture and heritage.\"\n\nThe Bench was hearing an appeal by the State against a single bench order which had allowed the rally to go ahead. It was held that since the rally was supposed to be held today (14th March) morning, people would have already assembled and that the police were very well equipped to deal with such occasions.\n\nThe court also directed the respondent counsel to take responsibility that the rally would be peaceful and that no hate speech or sloganeering would take place to cause unrest.\n\nAccordingly, the Court upheld the single bench's order and conditions imposed."
