        "text": "Mishti dahi is no less than an emotion for the people of Kolkata and Jadab Chandra Das happens to be one of those places that every local swears by. Located on the busy College Street, Jadab Chandra has been a favourite amongst some of Bengal's most celebrated individuals including Satyajit Ray and Aparna Sen. A friendly tip, keep your eyes wide open because this hole in the wall place is quite difficult to spot!\n\nPayesh\n\nSearching for a truly royal dessert? Look no further because the streets of Kolkata will have you covered! A unique combination of small gulab jamuns served with sweet rice, sita bhog is very typical of Kolkata. Legend has it that the sweet dish was especially loved by Lord Rama's wife, Sita. Head over to Sen Mahasay, take a bite of the sita bhog and feel like a royalty yourself! It doesn't get any better than this!\n\nPatishapta\n\nIf you're someone who prefers a dose of subtlety in your dessert, patishapta might just be your thing. These mini pancakes have long been a popular dessert in Kolkata and are stuffed with a range of fillings such as jaggery, coconut and dry fruits amongst others. A lot of sweet shops in the city have now started experimenting with fruits variants but there's none that comes close to Pithe Bilashi's baked patishapta. Believe me when I say this, this is the stuff dreams are made of.\n\nWhat are the best dessert spots in your city?
