        "text": "Once upon a time, there was a fairytale and it never existed. Exactly how opposite the lives of two people are - Realistic and Flawed. Those were the synonyms that journeyed along with Ronobir Chatterjee and Mishti Acharya since birth.. Enough of my \"Never-ending\" talks about \"The End\" Fairytales..\n\nTime Period : 1960s\n\nPlace : Calcutta.\n\nMishti Acharya got down at the Calcutta railway station and looked around at her surroundings. Nothing had changed ever since she left the city a long time ago. Only the population and pollution had multiplied. But she was happy to be back there. She was born in Calcutta and did her primary schooling in the city but later had to move to Bombay due to her father's job. She saw a number of taxis lined up with expectant drivers waiting to take charge of the exiting passengers. She dragged her suitcase along the road and winced at the disastrous noise it made as it creaked along the path. She shook her head in refusal at a taxi driver's request for a ride and moved along to the tram point. She absolutely loved trams. They always gave her a sense of adventure. She got into it and set forward to her grandparents place. Her request to stay in the Ladies hostel of the college was outright rejected by her parents. Apparently, her parents thought it wasn't safe for girls to stay alone and that they would be prone to various unwanted things like BOYS.. Sighing to herself, Mishti looked out of the window and scrunched her eyes as the direct rays of the sun hit her. Maybe it was Calcutta's way of telling her that this was how her medical journey was going to be - bright and tiring. She was welcomed with a smothering of kisses from her grandmother who had at once taken it upon herself to criticize as to how thin she'd gotten. Mishti raised at eyebrows at her eccentric grandmother. Her mother had all along told her during the summer that she needed to get off her bed and spend time outside so that she wouldn't accumulate any fat but who would want to go out and get heat boils all over their face !! Mishti's grandfather however was a calm person who had enveloped her in a familial hug. Mishti allowed herself the luxury of a few peaceful moments. She missed these very arms. During her childhood, she always used to run to her grandfather when she broke a window or something so that her parents wouldn't dare scold her. Her grandfather had the final word and she very well knew how to wrap him around her little finger. So for Mishti everything was allowed. But having been part of the army, her grandfather very well knew how to put people in place. She was always very guarded to not cross the boundary he set.\n\nMishti Acharya looked around her room. It still held the familiar smell of old books and plants but the environment had changed to suit the needs of now grown up her. Her books were still there, now perched upon a shelf her grandparents had built in her room. Her plants were very well looked after by the gardener that came everyday. She ran her finger through the budding rose that was growing and felt the soft petal.. She was quite like the flower - she had thorns of her own that guarded her thoughts very well but she was the petal too, soft to the ones that knew her well and the ones she allowed beyond the wall of thorns. She thought back to her parents in Bombay who were struggling with her younger sister. A soft smile spread across her face. Pari was the gundi of the family who had a mind of her won. She seldom listened to anyone and did what came to her mind and what her heart desired. Her parents worried that she would join some kind of a cult soon. That thought made Mishti laugh. Oh how misunderstood her parents were.. Pari was the sweetest person if you understood her. Mishti did and for Pari, Mishti was her hero.\n\nShe pulled out the pamphlet from her bag and looked at it.. \"Calcutta Medical College\" was written in bold letters with a mixture of different colors. She looked at it with a proud smile on her face. She had managed to clear her scholarship examination and the entrance examination into the prestigious college and was very much excited about it. She had her future plan set - MBBS, MS and her Residency program. She was looking forward for her first year at college. She even managed to catch her childhood friend who had enrolled into the same college, for a different course. She had someone to help her around and for advice. She walked towards the timber wood wardrobe that had been there since she was born. She picked out few dresses of her choice and sprawled them around on her bed. With a thoughtful finger under her chin, she eliminated each dress one after the other until she landed on a red color salwar. It was neither too plain nor too exquisite. She didn't know the customs nor the norms of the college so she eliminated the western choices that she picked out. Once she got into the grind, she would take them out. The red salwar was modest. It was perfect hand-stitched material with woven red material designs all over the top. The bottom was a plain red that reached to her ankles and stuck to her legs. She had a plain white dupatta to go along with it. Satisfied with her choice, she hung the dress to the back of her door and escaped to the bathroom to get ready for the night. Her grandfather's rules were to be followed and she did. Teeth brushed, face cleansed and dress changed.. She plopped on the bed in a very unladylike manner and snorted to herself. There was no reason to but she still did. Her thoughts went back to Bombay. She felt a bit homesick. Calcutta was very different in comparison to Bombay. Bombay was always bright with flashes of the cameras around and there was never a moment of quiet. The home to all the rising stars of cinema, she'd been spectator to various cars zooming in and around the roads and she was even lucky to catch a fleeting glimpse of Madhubala, The Anarkali of India. Calcutta was different. It was quiet. You could hear the ripple sound the river water made when you walked by it. And the people loved their traditions. You would find the women walking, decked up in their korial saree and out about on their way to the famous Kali Temple, the men getting into rickshaws and setting out to work and small kids either playing or getting ready for school. Her thoughts were disturbed by the ring of the phone. It was her sister. Pari was blabbering to Mishti about how she should have tied her up to the bedpost in Bombay so she wouldn't leave for Calcutta, how it was boring in the house being the only cool youngster and how interesting the new Marvel Spiderman comic was. Mishti laughed at her sister's craziness and wondered how was she even away from her. She twirled the wire around her fingers as she listened and by the time she was done, the poor wire was tangled with no freedom for normalcy. She jumped to her room, feeling much better."
