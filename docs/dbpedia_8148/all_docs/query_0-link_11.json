Being born &amp; brought up in Kolkata, West Bengal this is very close to my heart and I love having it especially after a Bengali meal. This Mishti doi cheesecake is the perfect fusion of the two places in the world",

        "text": "Transfer it to a spring form pan. Spread it out on the base and edges of the pan. I like to use the base of a small measuring cup or bowl to press down the base. I use the edges of the cup to press the crust along the walls of the pan.\n\nIn an instant pot, place the trivet that came along with the IP. Pour in about 1.5-2 cups of water. (The water level should be lower than the top the trivet so that’s it does not touch the cheesecake pan)\n\nJaggery- ideally use powder.If it’s cold use finely grated jaggery- I grated in a zested as melted jaggery will just clump together due to the cold. If warmer use melted jaggery- I melted whole jaggery with 1/2 tbsp of water in the microwave for 30-50 seconds, stirring it in 15 seconds intervals.\n\nIf you are just making the crust as a base and not all around, then you would need about to make a1/2-2/3rd of the crust recipe (depending on the thickness you like)\n\nIf you make it in individual ramekins then you need to reduce the cooking time by 5-6 minutes, and likewise if you are making a larger cheesecake then you need to increase the time by 5-6 minutes.\n\nIf you want to bake it an oven instead of using an instant pot- Preheat oven to 300F. Make sure to wrap the bottom of the cake pan with foil so that water doesn’t go inside the cake pan. Place the pan on a baking tray. Keep the baking tray on the middle rack in the oven and pour 1-1.5 cup of hot water in the baking tray. Bake for 35 min to 50 mins or until most of the cake is set except just jiggly in the middle. It can take almost an hour depending on how hot your oven gets but be sure to check it before so that it doesn’t overbake. It will continue to cook and set while it cools. Take it out and cool at room temp for an hour. Chill in the fridge for 5-6 hours."
