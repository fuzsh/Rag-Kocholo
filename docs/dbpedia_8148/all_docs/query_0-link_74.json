        "text": "Quite true to my Bengali genes I have got a sweet tooth.Give me any thing sweet be it Bengal’s own roshogolla,ledikini, kheer kodombo , mishti doi or anything sweet which is not so Bengali like a fudge cake,cookie dough ice cream,chocolate brownie or a caramel flan – I am ready to dig in .Since the past 4 years of my stay in England I have had enough chance to try different forms of western dessert while the frequent trips back to India (Kolkata to be specific) were just not sufficient enough to sooth my Bengali mishti craving.True to the saying ”necessity is the mother of invention” one day I finally gave in to my Bengali sweet craving and decided to try my hand at making a Bengali sweet at home.While surfing through videos on YouTube I came across this video and the idea of making a fusion chocolate shondesh dawned upon me!\n\nThis fusion sweet is very dear to my heart, perfectly unites the best possible combination of chocolate from the west and mishti from the east,quite like us those who live miles away from the home land, soaking in the foreign culture yet cant give away their traditional root.\n\nRecipe for Chocolate Shondesh\n\nIngredients\n\nFor the making of Shondesh\n\nFull fat milk : 3 litre\n\nKhoya/Milk Solids : 1/2 cup (optional)\n\nSugar : 1 to 1 and 1/2 cup\n\nLemon juice : 4 lemon\n\nCocoa Powder : 4 heaped tablespoon\n\nFor garnishing the Shondesh\n\nChocolate bar- 150 gm\n\nDouble Cream- 100 ml\n\nSugar : 1/4 cup\n\nChoice of nuts : Pistachio/Cashew\n\nMethod of making Shondesh\n\n1)Boil the milk in a heavy bottomed pan at medium heat stirring occasionally .When the milk starts boiling add the lemon juice and increase the flame little bit to enhance coagulation.As soon as the milk starts to curdle and whey is separated from the curd turn of the heat,otherwise the chenna(paneer)will become stiff.Drain the whey from the milk fat by using a strainer lined with a cheesecloth or muslin cloth for about 10 minutes."
