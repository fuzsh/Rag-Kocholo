        "text": "Bardhaman, a bustling town in the eponymous district is a few hours’ drive from Kolkata with its share of tourist attractions and historic sites: think: centuries-old temples, the beautiful red-brick Christ Church built in 1816, tombs and mausoleums of Mughal aristocrats and beautiful gardens built by the region’s erstwhile royalty. But these sights apart, what draws people here even today are its fabled sweets—the mihidana and sitabhog.\n\nWhat is Sitabhog?\n\nAt first glance, Sitabhog reminds you of a pulao of fluffy grains of fragrant long-grained rice studded with tiny meatballs. Only it’s an intricate sweetmeat, where the delicate, grains are made of a mix of fresh chhana and powdered atop chal or parboiled rice, kneaded into a soft dough. The dough is rubbed against a specially designed sieve, into a kadhai of ghee (heated to a precise degree) in short strands that are fried to feather-light, off-white crisps.\n\nRetaining the whiteness of the dough is crucial and therein lay the artistry and technical mastery of the karigars of this culinary heirloom. The deep-fried strands are soaked in sugar syrup flavoured with spices like bay leaves, cardamom and nutmeg, strained out and allowed to rest. Caramel-hued balls of deep-fried dough of flour, milk solids dunked in syrup called nikuti are added to the mix. The end result is a delightful confection that resembles a delicate rice and meatball pilaf.\n\nWhat makes Sitabhog particularly special is how it marries two of Bengal’s most cherished food items—chhana (an ingredient that fuelled the imagination and inventive spirit of the 19th-century Bengali confectioner) and Bengal’s age-old folk rice cultivars.\n\nThe story of Sitabhog\n\nIf popular lore is to be believed, mihidana (syrupy, saffron-hued beads made from a batter of gram flour and three varieties of rice) and sitabhog are fraternal twins created at the same time by one master confectioner. As the story goes, these were invented when Lord Curzon visited Bardhaman in 1904 to confer the title of Maharaja Adhiraja on Bijay Chand Mehtab, the ruler of the Bardhaman estate.\n\nBijay Chand arranged for a grand reception and an imposing gateway was built by Italian masons in 1903 and christened Curzon Gate in the viceroy’s honour. Fireworks lit up the skies above the waters of the sprawling Krishnasagar lake and a grand feast was arranged. No expenses were spared to make this a special event and Maharaja Bahadur summoned a prominent local confectioner Bhairab Chandra Nag to create something exceptional to impress the Viceroy.\n\nWhile Nag was experimenting with boondi, he chanced upon a way to create finer grains. Further experiments with saffron, rice flour and chhana yielded a whole new kind of mishti. And when the different components were assembled together, they resembled a savoury pilaf. This sweet illusion crafted by Nag was a grand success and sent Lord Curzon into a veritable rhapsody.\n\nAnd so one sweetmaker’s mastery and ingenuity led to the birth of two of Bengal’s most iconic sweets. Ever since the town of Bardhaman has been synonymous with Mihidana and Sitabhog.\n\nThe many origins of Sitabhog\n\nWhile this is the most popular story about this sweet’s origin, there are other references that point to an even older lineage. There is a mention of mihidana and sitabhog in renowned Bengali novelist Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay’s novel, Krishnakanter Will, written almost 25 years prior to Curzon’s visit to Bardhaman. Chattopadhyay writes, “Chheleguli mihidana sitabhog loyiya bhnata khyalayite aarombho korilo,” (“The boys started playing with mihidana and sitabhog”) while describing the titular character Krishnakanta’s funeral feast.\n\nIt seems then that Sitabhog and Mihidana, existed, at least in some form, before Bhairab Chandra Nag presented his renditions to the viceroy. Perhaps he refined the existing delicacies and added his own flair to the luxuriant sweetmeats. Whatever be the case, his name remains twinned with the dishes.\n\nFood historian KT Achaya also had a theory on these sweets. He drew parallels between the ancient kshiraprakara, “rice flour shaped in ingenious ways and coated with sugar” and Bengal’s sitabhog. There are various theories associated with its name too. Some opine Sitabhog, as the name suggests, was a favourite of Sita from The Ramayana. The theory seems far-fetched and even at odds with the accepted story about the dish’s origins. Considering the trend among contemporary sweet makers to name new inventions after famous patrons and dignitaries, it would make more sense if the sweet bore the name of Curzon or a colloquial distortion, instead of Ram’s consort.\n\nHistorian and linguist Sukumar Sen mentions that the Sitabhog derives its name from a Bengali synonym for white—shith, while others claim the sweet gets its name from Sita shal, a variety of fragrant, parboiled rice it was originally made of. However, according to farmer-scientist and ecologist Dr Debal Deb, the Sitabhog was originally prepared from its eponymous folk rice variety which is now extinct. The sweet as we know it today is made with modern cultivars of rice, “even as it bears the name of a lost rice whose original flavour is long forgotten,” he writes. Today, kamini bhog, a cherished variety of fragrant rice, or gobindobhog, the delightfully aromatic rice native to Bardhaman district, is used to make ‘authentic’ Sitabhog.\n\nSitabhog gets a GI Tag\n\nBardhaman’s Sitabhog received a GI tag in 2017, along with the mihidana. The India Post, in association with APEDA, even released a specially designed envelope promoting these heirloom sweets of Bengal. Last year, the duo made its first official trip abroad when Bahrain-based Aljazira Group imported a batch for their supermarket chain.\n\nThe sitabhog is ubiquitous in Bardhaman, hawked at the railway station and sold out of sweetshops, big and small. However, not every shop lives up to its legendary status. There are two varieties—the ordinary/regular one made in cheaper vegetable oil and the special variety which is cooked in pure ghee. Needless to say, one should try the latter.\n\nGanesh Sweets, a name that has often popped up in conversations around Bardhaman’s mihidana and sitabhog, remains a place where one can try authentic versions of this sweet. We also recommend Alpona Sweets, a two-minute drive from the Curzon gate with its melt-in-the-mouth Sitabhog crammed with golden-fried cashew nuts and raisins, fragrant with ghee and just a hint of nutmeg. For those who can't make the journey to Bardhaman, the legendary sweetmakers of North Kolkata also do a pretty nifty version of the Sitabhog.\n\nWhere to buy Sitabhog in Bardhaman and Kolkata\n\nGanesh Mishtanna Bhandar: BB Ghosh Road, Burdwan, West Bengal 713101 (multiple outlets)\n\nAlpona Sweets: 6VP8+38J, Grand Trunk Rd, Burdwan,\n\nGirish Chandra Dey & Namur Chandra Nandy: 56 Ramdulal Sarkar Street, Kolkata 700006\n\nBhim Chandra Nag: 8 Vivekananda Road, Kolkata 700007"
