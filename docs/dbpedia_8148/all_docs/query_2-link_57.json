        "text": "JERSEY CITY — One Monday afternoon in December, Nur-E Gulshan Rahman was perched on a hot-pink step stool, her body hunched over a boti, a steel cutting instrument she bought back in her native Bangladesh. Her face was inexplicably free of sweat as she sliced bulky calabazas into small diamonds.\n\nA large knife might suffice for other cooks when it came to that task. But not for Ms. Gulshan, who prefers the boti, its blade shaped like a viper’s fang.\n\n“Too hard,” she said when asked why she doesn’t use a chef’s knife. “We are not used to cutting pumpkin with the knife in Bangladesh.”"
