        "text": "FSNM 3rd World Mithai & Namkeen Convention Expo, Hyderabad, January 2020\n\nSri Dhiman Das, Director of K. C. Das Private Ltd was invited to 3rd World Mithai & Namkeen Convention Expoheld by Federation of Sweets & Namkeen Manufacturers of India at Hyderabad In January, 2020. He was extremely honored to be felicitated by FSNM. It was such a lovely experience for him meeting all categories of sweets and snacks manufacturers starting from those innominate producers from villages in Bihar and Rajasthan upto the giants like Haldiram’s and Bikanerwala. But most astonishingly or rather most unfortunately what pained him most that there was no representation from Bengal – the so called sweetest part of India other than himself. He felt extremely disheartened and embarrassed as because although Bengali sweets has international fame as well as recognition from every corner of the globe with numerous talented entrepreneurs from almost every district of Bengal, there was no participation whatsoever in such a huge gathering of the sweet fraternity from all over the country. Upon returning back home he enquired over the matter and then I tried to convince few senior executive committee members of the then existing Sweetmeat Association of Bengal to join hands with FSNM but sadly I failed.\n\nIndia announces Complete Lockdown to counter Covid 19\n\nDuring the end of March, 2020 Government of India announced complete lockdown across the country. Huge quantities of sweets were wasted as Bengali sweets have a very short shelf-life. Within a week or so news started pouring in that excess milk had to be thrown into drains and even in sea because sweet shops stopped using them. Many local sweetshop owners who earned their living out of their daily sales were grappling under skyrocketing debts. He received calls from various sweetshop owners to somehow approach and convey our Hon’ble Chief Minister to consider opening of sweet shops at least for few hours. He approached eminent painter Shri Shuvaprasanna regarding the matter. Shuvaprasanna always had a weakness for the Bengali sweet shops not because he loved to eat sweets but more because he respected the industry as it forms a part of the rich cultural heritage and tradition of Bengal. Also industry’s very own Shuva-da shared a very good rapport with our present Chief Minister. It was only because of his insistence that Respected Ms. Banerjee announced that very afternoon that sweetshops would be opened for 4 hours daily. And after a fortnight, again on Shuvada's intervention the timing was furthermore relaxed. It was dire circumstance for the industry and it was warning bell for them to get united.\n\nFSNM Effect\n\nIn the meantime, Firoz Naqvi – Founder Director & Treasurer of FSNM started frequently keeping contact with Dhiman Das regarding various legal issues related to the sweet industry and wanted our support. Everybody was feeling the heat and need for a strong united presence of sweet entrepreneurs was the need of the day. One fine morning in July 2020, when Mr. Das was discussing the situation with one of the fellow entrepreneurs, Sri Arup Kumar Das, From M/s Satish Moira he conveyed his desire of forming an Association of sweets and savories consisting of next generation, young and energetic entrepreneurs. He immediately jumped up to the idea and instantly connected with another fellow entrepreneur, Sri Amitava De of the M/s Felu Modak fame of Rishra and thus started the formation process of a new association\n\nMishti Udyog is Born\n\nOn 25th of July 2020, young energetic entrepreneurs under the able leadership of Dhiman Das joined hands and thus was born Mishti Udyog – Sweets & Savouries Entrepreneurs Association of Bengal. The strong enthusiasm of Arup and Amitava have ultimately fulfilled the dream of an effective Association with fresh blood and full of energy. Amidst the severe pandemic 11 likeminded entrepreneurs came together to plant a seedling which is a full grown matured tree today watered by numerous active members. The Executive Committee was formed with Dhiman Das as president leading form the front and others as co warriors with a cause to take Bengal’s heritage industry beyond the borders of the State and the Country. It was first time in the history of Bengali sweets that cut throat competitors have not only gathered under one roof under a single able leadership but also strengthened each other by holding hand for only single cause – Development of our very own sweetmeat industry and taking it to heights. Executive Committee vowed to make Bengal Sweet Capital of the country and they believe very soon the city of Kolkata which is popularly called City of Joy would be termed as City of Sweets. Members swayed in and FSNM recognition was about to happen any moment. Finally it came and today Mishti Udyog stands as the West Bengal State body for FSNM.\n\nTaking the charge\n\nRight from inception Mishti Udyog started making it’s presence felt through its smart and educated moves. Be it a food safety issue, or fire license renewal or best before dates Mishti Udyog made a mark in every fields. Different districts started connecting and the family went on becoming bigger and bigger with every passing day. A highly enriched Advisory Committee was formed to help guide the Association in every possible aspects. Mishti Udyog started arranging webinars on preservatives, food colours, packaging etc to enrich the knowledge of members. A digital “Vendor Bank” was formed for quick access of members. For the first time even district members were having access to updated packaging concepts, Preservatives and a lot more. So business was bound to turn around.\n\nBengal Sweets & Savouries Business Summit 2021"
