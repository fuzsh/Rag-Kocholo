Family law revolves around marriage, cohabitation, and the parent-child relationship.\n\nWhat does a family law attorney do? Family law attorneys in California frequently deal with divorce cases, child custody cases or child support calculations, paternity actions and adoption.\n\nIn high income or high net worth cases the divorce attorney will deal with more complicated issues of the equitable division of property and retirement assets.\n\nMany of the best family law attorneys in California charge for an initial consultation, have an hourly rate for attorney fees, and require a retainer to begin representation."
