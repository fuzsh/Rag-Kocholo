        "text": "Changing Venues, Changing Sounds\n\nInternationally recognized as a chronicler of improvisation and free-jazz artists including Barry Guy, William Parker and Carlo Actis Dato, O’Connor’s archive also comprises images of jazz greats Art Blakey, Milt Jackson and Betty Carter, plus blues artists including Etta James and Eddie ‘Cleanhead’ Vinson and Soul Brother #1, James Brown. See the alphabetical list above.\n\nO’Connor has made both documentary and interpretive photographs in venues ranging from the plush St. Lawrence Centre in Toronto to New Orleans’ rustic Preservation Hall; from 13th-century chapels to art galleries to open-air stages, and in homes and basement venues lit with incandescent and LED bulbs, and sometimes only candles. Her work has captured the attention of critics, musicians, collectors, and lovers of jazz and improvised music in Canada, Europe and the U.S. Her first international exhibition took place in Austria in 2020, and she has staged several shows in Toronto since 1990.\n\nPublications\n\nCopyright (c) Susan O’Connor\n\nTo deter inappropriate reproduction and use, the photos on this site and in GalleryO are reproduced in relatively low resolution with minimal cropping and alterations. Some colour digital images have been converted to black and white for more effective online display.
