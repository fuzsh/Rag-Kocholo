Chicagoans have a placename for e­ very part of the city. We lived in West Rogers Park. At the time, I perceived banks and bankers through my parents’ eyes. They had a mortgage with a savings and loan association (S&L) located near Devon and California, a half mile from our ­house. The S&L’s se­nior officer sat in a room just ­beyond the doorway, where he greeted customers. I had a passbook saving’s account at that S&L. No minimum balance was required for my child’s account, which came with a desk bank for me to deposit coins at home. Perhaps ­because S&Ls w ­ ere not permitted to offer checking accounts, my ­father and ­uncle maintained a business checking account at a bank on Clark Street near their shop. My parents’ financial arrangements had a neighborhood quality, now that I think about it. They did not have contact with the First National Bank of Chicago or with one of the other major banks in the city’s famous Loop. Illinois law, I discovered years l­ater, prohibited branch banking, even among the city and state’s largest and most influential firms. My ­mother handled my f­ ather’s bookkeeping as well as the ­house­hold bud­ get. For her to deposit cash at the First National would have required a fatiguing trip on public transit. And surely, my parents and ­uncle asked each other, would executives at a “downtown” bank approve loans to unincorporated partners in a drapery and slipcover shop who had a history of falling ­behind on payments during the off-­season? Other parts of our ­house­hold finances ­were both local and personal. “Shelly,” an insurance agent and my parents’ friend, came to our ­house to collect premiums—­a nd to recommend additions to existing policies. My ­mother paid Shelly in cash. He sometimes settled for less than the amount due, returning the following week to pick up the balance. The “off-­season” permeated most aspects of our financial and domestic lives. Yet, my parents owned a home and paid the mortgage.\n\nx Preface\n\nIn 1967, when Marsha Lynn Shapiro and I married, we inherited t­ hose financial arrangements. We opened a checking account at a bank in Columbus, Ohio, across the street from The Ohio State University, where we ­were gradu­ate students. The account was in my name. In 1974, members of Congress and President Gerald R. Ford passed the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the terms of which prohibited bankers from including race, age, gender, and marital status in making determinations about account owner­ship and loans. In other re­spects, the organ­ization of financial ser­vices remained as before. Marsha Lynn and I purchased renters and auto insurance at Allstate. They stationed agents in Sears, Roebuck’s doorway at the mall. We had heard about Merrill Lynch’s nationwide presence and its efforts to sell shares of stock to the m ­ iddle class. We lacked the surplus funds and an ideological orientation ­toward investments. As a result, u ­ ntil the mid-1970s, our experience with financial institutions consisted of a checking account, two insurance policies, our Sears charge card, and a short-­term loan with a finance com­pany at the end of our block. Nor did I have reason to doubt that bank executives remained among the nation’s most prestigious citizens, especially in rural Amer­i­ca, where they ranked only a notch below the town doctor. During the next ten years, I observed impor­tant changes taking place in still-­distant financial realms. Federal law and regulators had capped interest rates that banks and S&Ls paid depositors. ­Those depositors in turn, I read in the daily newspaper, ­were moving savings and checking balances to money market and mutual funds, which paid higher rates of interest. In the early 1980s, a colleague told me about a money market fund paying some 18 ­percent, which presented a stark comparison with the more modest interest rate paid at our local bank and at our credit ­union located on campus. I also noticed that brokerage firms like Merrill Lynch “made a market” in the stocks they sold to retail customers. At the time, I was uncertain what that meant. In the 1980s, the organ­ization of financial ser­v ices like banking and insurance remained divided, much as when I was a teenager. Insurance companies including Allstate and State Farm sold insurance, and S&Ls, like the one near my parents’ h ­ ouse, wrote most home mortgages. Banks such as New York’s mighty Chase Manhattan and Citibank made business loans and offered checking accounts, as did thousands of small banks in towns throughout the United States. Money market and other mutual funds, more recent to the scene, operated as in­de­pen­dent actors, with no vis­i­ble connections to banks or insurance firms. Equally normal, we thought, our bank in Upper\n\nPrefacexi\n\nMichigan could not open a branch in Illinois or Wisconsin. To cash a check on visits to f­ amily in Chicago required multiple forms of identification. African American travelers could not bank on that privilege. We w ­ ere not alert to the tumultuous changes that had begun to roil the business of banking. Credit cards and the automated teller machines (ATMs) offered remarkable con­ve­nience. Starting in the late 1970s, bankers touted the ATM as evidence of their customer orientation and technology’s unstoppable march t­ oward nationwide customer ser­vice. The introduction of ATMs and credit cards like Visa, I learned years l­ ater, had only a l­ ittle to do with technology and nearly every­t hing to do with politics. In 2003, Marsha Lynn and I secured a brief look at the changes in bank practices. Now, we resided in South Florida. We had a mortgage as well as checking and savings accounts at one of the largest banks in the United States. We sought to refinance our mortgage in order to pay our ­daughters’ college bills. Bank officials not only approved our application, but also cheerfully offered a home equity line of credit and a new credit card. A bank officer brought in coffee and soft drinks while we completed the paperwork. Refreshments for teachers! We met in a conference room on an upper floor of a handsome downtown office building. The main banking room and phalanx of tellers, where customers cashed checks and made deposits, ­were located on the first floor. Customers like us transacted more business outside, at the ATM. The executive who greeted customers at my parents’ S&L had dis­appeared generations earlier. I could not discern each aspect of what was new about our transaction that after­noon. We had only to send our payments each month. In subsequent years, we had no reason to visit a bank branch office. Five years went by ­until I began to connect changes at our bank to my understanding of main themes in financial history and in American po­liti­cal development. This study of bank politics began serendipitously. In 2008, I had the good fortune to serve as president of the Business History Conference. I needed a presidential address for June 2009. Then, in mid-­September 2008, Lehman ­Brothers Holdings filed for bankruptcy. Massive financial and job losses followed. I would study how that financial calamity took place. Early on in my study, I noticed that bankers and their publicists did a poor job explaining their past. They talked about how computers made interstate banking inevitable and how their dedication to customer ser­vice had virtually dictated legislative outcomes such as the lifting of restrictions on\n\nxii Preface\n\ninterstate branch banking. As I studied bankers, lawmakers, regulators, and presidents, I began to identify a far more sophisticated and nuanced story of social and po­liti­cal institutions that extended back to the 1960s. Historians seek to answer large questions by looking for contexts and by pushing back in time. We also believe that p ­ eople ­matter and that we need to allow ­t hose ­people to take the lead in our stories. I poked around the web and our university library. I began to read in the lit­er­a­ture aimed at bankers, investors, and insurance agents. American Banker, for years delivered each day to most banks in the United States, emerged as a must read for understanding the ideas bankers relied on to lure depositors, evaluate loan applicants, and prepare strongly worded messages for their congressional representatives. Politics resided at the core of American banking, I learned. My immersion in archives and in trade journals like American Banker suggested a large and previously unearthed series of stories about bankers’ po­liti­cal be­hav­ior. During the period 1961 to 1999, I learned, every­one with a stake in the money business, such as S&L executives, insurance agents, and bankers, relied on courts, Congress, and regulators to advance their interests. Bankers and S&L executives, to identify only two sets of actors, had business organ­izations, income, an honored place in the business community, and long-­established ways of life to protect and advance. Each president between John F. Kennedy and Bill Clinton also played an impor­tant part in fostering changes in the money business. To conclude my study in 1999 with congressional passage of impor­tant bank legislation would have created what historians describe as a natu­ral periodization. That legislation overturned the remaining bank practices I had noticed growing up. I deci­ded, however, to study developments leading up to 2008, when the financial crisis started. And next, I wanted to understand the pro­cess by which lawmakers, regulators, bankers, and Trea­sury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner reached conclusions about how to prevent a similar catastrophe in the f­ uture. In 2010, Geithner and congressional leaders secured passage of the Dodd-­Frank Act. By the time I completed that portion of my book, I detected the presence of yet another story that I wanted to tell. In this final phase, I studied leading figures in bank politics during the years between 2010 and early 2017. One of my key actors, Rep. Thomas Jeb Hensarling, sought to unravel the Dodd-­Frank Act in theme and detail. Beginning in January 2017, President Donald J. Trump’s aides worked with Hensarling to bring about new bank legislation and changed regulations that w ­ ere supposed to accelerate the pace of economic growth.\n\nPrefacexiii\n\nBetween 1961 and the first months of 2017, I had learned, ­every president wanted bankers to help speed the economy’s pace. And yet, for presidents, bankers, or anyone e­ lse to foster their favored legislation required a steely outlook, long-­term patience, and a willingness to engage in a grinding politics without end. That politics started with lofty symbols like freedom and prosperity but always included negative and even hostile views of opponents who, it was said, had set out to destroy the American economy.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nPolitics and the Markets They Made\n\nCon­temporary Americans reside inside the myth of the marketplace. We imagine that the market governs the cost of merchandise at the mall, the wages awarded factory workers and executives, and the price we pay for our ­houses, home appliances, and automobiles. Meanwhile, we are able to attribute the prosperity many Americans enjoy to their hard work and their keen adaptation to the market’s stern dictates. And, fi­nally, we believe that corporate executives compete each day to identify new business and outdo competitors. By this reckoning, the entire world is a marketplace, or it ­ought to be. No won­der talk about how markets operate pervades nearly e­ very aspect of American life. To simplify my discussion of this market mythmaking, I call it market talk. No one should doubt the central place of the markets in American life. But market talk has often encouraged us to misunderstand how t­ hose markets w ­ ere created and how they operated. The president of the United States was and remains a key actor in the organ­ization of markets. And presidents had good reason to attend to their market-­making responsibilities. Especially ­after 1945, Americans held presidents responsible to produce economic prosperity. Banks ­were and remain key actors in fashioning that prosperity. And at the same time, t­ hose banks, the largest and smallest, operated inside a complex set of rules about how and even where to conduct business. For all the market talk in which Americans engaged, the truth of the ­matter was that federal and state officials chartered banks, and ­t hose charters laid out rules about bank loans and about more complicated ­matters like the amount of capital that bankers needed to keep on hand. In other words, bankers in ­every de­cade operated in markets that government officials had created. Politics was pres­ent in banking from the outset. If presidents wanted bankers to help foster growth, then they would have to find a way to change bank rules.\n\n2 Introduction\n\nBetween 1961 and 2008, presidents helped put in place legislation and regulations that permitted bankers to create massive banks like Citigroup and Bank of Amer­i­ca. ­Those large banks and their well-­paid chief executives such as Charles O. Prince and Kenneth D. Lewis ­were deeply implicated in the G ­ reat Recession that began late in 2007. To appreciate the continued presence of politics and presidents in creating markets, and even market downturns, we must go back six de­cades to the earliest days of the John F. Kennedy administration and to James J. Saxon, an obscure yet influential figure in his administration. Kennedy charged Saxon to change bank rules. Saxon and his new bank rules created a number of enemies along the way. Nearly ­every federal official disliked Saxon. Between 1961 and 1966, Saxon served as comptroller of the currency, the government’s chief bank regulator. Members of Congress and small-­town bankers wrote to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson about Saxon’s rules. Saxon’s multiple critics described ­t hose rules as unfair, illegal, and certain to destroy small-­town banking. Impor­tant congressional figures like Rep. Wright Patman (D-­TX) demanded that Johnson fire Saxon on the spot. Basically, Comptroller Saxon challenged established law and pre­ce­dent to permit bankers to merge firms, open branches, sell insurance, and underwrite revenue bonds. Saxon’s ultimate goal was to create large, multipurpose banking firms that conducted business across the United States and that, in turn, would presumably hasten the nation’s economic growth. But Saxon’s quest to remodel banking ran headfirst into federal law and into accustomed practice among a large number of bankers. Three de­cades earlier, members of Congress had approved the Banking Act of 1933. Bankers and journalists named that legislation the Glass-­Steagall Act, ­a fter its principal authors’ names. The Glass-­Steagall Act, as ­every financial economist, regulator, and congressional leader had long known, forbade even the largest commercial banks such as David Rocke­fel­ler’s Chase Manhattan from underwriting stock issues or offering additional financial products such as home and business insurance. Saxon’s ideas and his personality created enemies in and out of government. To start, no one to that point had demonstrated that larger banks providing a greater range of ser­vices would foster the national economic growth that Kennedy wanted to bring about. Quite the reverse, many Americans still associated big banks with the Depression’s start; and ­were that perception not enough to harden dislike for Saxon’s proposals, small-­town bankers feared that a larger bank located in Chicago or New York would open a\n\nIntroduction3\n\nbranch and take away business they had ser­v iced for de­cades. By this reasoning, moreover, bankers like Chase Manhattan’s Rocke­fel­ler would replace Main Street bankers among their town’s most influential leaders. In plain fact, moreover, Saxon was not an easy person with whom to work, and critics seized on his high-­handed methods as another reason for Kennedy and Johnson to replace him. Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, it turned out, ­were Saxon’s only supporters among federal officials. Kennedy and Johnson endured the tumult that followed Saxon’s innovative decisions on the hunch that larger banks making more loans would bring about that much desired growth. And in turn, Kennedy and Johnson brought legitimacy and po­liti­cal heft to the idea that more big banks making larger loans would prove key actors in the economy’s development. Economic growth was among the most impor­tant ideas in postwar American po­liti­cal life. And yet, Saxon’s policies, if fully implemented, posed a threat to the prestige, authority, and profits of e­ very insurance agent, securities dealer, and small banker in the United States. Courts provided t­ hose ner­vous actors with much needed protection. Securities dealers including Merrill Lynch won a lawsuit that kept bankers out of their business. Insurance agents also triumphed in courts. In a nation ostensibly committed to entrepreneurship at the hands of freewheeling executives, insurance agents and securities dealers preferred to manage their firms within l­egal realms that kept regulators like Saxon at a distance. Still more, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the president’s ­brother, filed antitrust actions to block several of the largest bank mergers and won many of ­t hose suits. As I learned the contours of this story, I began to develop several themes. First, I recognized that bankers had a turf and ways of conducting business to protect. Next, I learned that not even the president of the United States possessed the authority to usher larger banks into existence. Nevertheless, each president starting with Kennedy and Johnson in the 1960s and extending to Bill Clinton during the 1990s made the creation of large, multipurpose banks a central policy goal. The creation of big banks linked to faster economic growth was a presidential proj­ect that extended from the 1960s to June 2017, when I completed work on this book. Starting in the 1970s, advocates described this new type of bank, with its proposed insurance and securities products, as similar to chain supermarkets like A&P that had been replacing stand-­a lone butchers and in­de­pen­dent grocers for de­cades. Th ­ ese supermarket banks w ­ ere actually an old idea, having appeared in Germany\n\n4 Introduction\n\nduring the nineteenth c­ entury and among a few American banks during the 1920s. In the 1960s, many in the United States described the supermarket bank idea as new and shocking.1 Comptroller Saxon did not initiate ­these changes in banking single-­ handedly. Starting in the late 1960s, several bankers joined this fledgling supermarket bank campaign. I focus on four of them. Between 1967 and 1984, Walter B. Wriston headed the gigantic Citicorp. Wriston was the nation’s best-­ known banker. He gave speeches to business groups about the unfair regulations that kept his com­pany penned into parts of New York State and out of the insurance and securities businesses. Wriston followed Saxon in announcing that federal rules put commercial banks like his Citicorp at a disadvantage compared to less regulated money market mutual funds or even Sears, Roebuck, with its successful credit card and insurance sales. W ­ ere this unfair situation to continue into the ­future, Wriston lamented, commercial banks would have to go out of business. Wriston brought each of ­these complaints to the heads of the Federal Reserve; and he hobnobbed with Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Ronald W. Reagan, who no doubt also had an opportunity to hear his laments—­with which they concurred in theme and detail. Donald T. Regan is the second banker I chose to study. Regan headed Merrill Lynch between 1971 and 1980. Merrill Lynch was not a commercial bank, like Wriston’s Citicorp. As a consequence, Regan was able to underwrite stock issues, sell shares of stock to middle-­income Americans, and offer money market and other mutual funds in branch offices located across the United States and overseas. In 1980, President Reagan asked Regan to serve as trea­sury secretary. Regan promptly got about the business of trying to secure congressional legislation to permit bankers to remodel their firms to look like his Merrill Lynch. Regan secured only modest changes in banking rules during four years in office. Hugh L. McColl, Jr., is the third banker I write about in detail. In 1959, McColl completed his Marine Corps ser­v ice and secured a trainee position at Charlotte’s modest American Commercial Bank. Throughout his ­career, McColl made frequent reference to his beloved Marines. He rewarded successful employees at his renamed NationsBank with crystal grenades for desk display. McColl also spoke in profanities. News of his cursing preceded him into merger negotiations, where he sometimes lost coveted deals. Starting in 1992, however, McColl emerged as “the president’s banker,” an honorific that journalists conferred on bankers who ­were close to President Bill Clinton or to any president. In 1998, McColl merged his NationsBank with\n\nIntroduction5\n\nCalifornia’s BankAmerica, to create Bank of Amer­i­ca located in Charlotte. The new behemoth featured 4,800 branch offices spread across twenty-­seven states and thirty-­eight countries. McColl recognized, as if by instinct, that the route to a supermarket bank ran through a wide swath of government agencies and top officials. Sanford I. Weill, another dealmaker, rounds out my study of bankers’ quests to preside over the assembly of supermarket banks. In 1985, Weill left American Express. The next year, he purchased a small com­pany in Baltimore that made loans to lower-­income Americans. Through a series of acquisitions, Weill took control of the Travelers Group, an insurance g­ iant that also sold mutual funds and other financial products to middle-­income Americans. Weill had s­ haped a supermarket financial firm that looked much like Donald Regan’s Merrill Lynch. And identical to Merrill Lynch, Weill’s firms reported to state insurance regulators and to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rather than to the Federal Reserve or the comptroller. In 1998, Weill merged his Travelers Group with Citicorp. The new firm, renamed Citigroup, spanned the globe and offered both regular savings accounts and exotic financial instruments like asset-­backed securities. By the late 1990s, Citigroup and Bank of Amer­i­ca, with their multiple branches and product offerings, fulfilled President Kennedy and Comptroller Saxon’s hesitant first steps t­ oward creation of supermarket banks. McColl and Weill w ­ ere successful entrepreneurs. On the surface, they undertook large financial and po­liti­cal risks to assem­ble t­ hose megabanks. Along the way, they brought lawsuits and lobbied regulators and members of Congress. They enjoyed audiences with presidents starting with Nixon and extending to Clinton. As a ­matter of fact, Clinton invited McColl to talk about bank policy in the ­family’s upstairs apartment at the White House. The once cursing, ex-­marine had traveled a considerable social and po­liti­cal distance. And yet as I determine, McColl and other top bankers, acting alone and in concert, had not brought the supermarket bank to fruition. I or­ga­ nized Wriston, Regan, McColl, and Weill in successive chapters to underscore this singularly impor­tant point. To achieve success, ­these power­ful bankers had to connect their corporate goals—to bestride the financial universe—to each president’s l­egal obligation and po­liti­cal goal to accelerate economic growth. Post–­World War II presidents served as the nation’s chief economic officers. They w ­ ere responsible to make the economy work without inflation and at full employment. It was a tall order, and Congress had not handed them\n\n6 Introduction\n\ndirect management tools.2 In consequence, presidents as dif­fer­ent in working style as John Kennedy, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and Donald J. Trump appointed bank regulators who would make decisions judged favorable to bank growth and the widespread economic advance each hoped would follow. As one example, Clinton appointed Eugene A. Ludwig comptroller of the currency. In symbolic fashion, Ludwig hung a painting of Saxon, Kennedy’s innovative comptroller, b ­ ehind his desk. Ludwig, acting on the basis of ­favorable litigation, permitted bankers to put their securities firms outside the bank and outside the comptroller’s review. Th ­ ose securities dealers, now deeply invested in the pro­cess of converting mortgages and credit card debt into asset-­backed securities, could begin to operate in the same agile fashion as investment bankers at Merrill Lynch and Lehman ­Brothers. In turn, trea­ sury secretaries Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers insisted on putting Ludwig’s ­ legal innovations in the Gramm-­ Leach-­ Bliley Financial Ser­v ices Modernization Act of 1999. That legislation, which key actors including securities dealers, insurance agents, and large and small bankers had argued about since the early 1960s, legalized supermarket banks across the nation at long last. Bankers like Wriston, McColl, and Weill played an impor­ tant part in setting the stage for changed bank legislation and for promoting it tirelessly with regulators and lawmakers. Most fundamentally, Gramm-­Leach-­Bliley represented the culmination of a nearly forty-­year-­long presidential campaign to bring supermarket banks into existence. Bank politics, as I noted, had a never-­ending, grinding, and exhausting quality. In 1999, that grinding politics reached a temporary conclusion. Clinton, Weill, Senator Phil Gramm (R-­TX), and o ­ thers had coalesced around the time-­honored idea of economic growth for nearly e­ very American. Bank legislation for the new ­century was never that ­simple. We should not think about Gramm-­Leach-­Bliley as bank deregulation and the abolition of rules. Instead, the bill’s authors put a remodeled bank regime in place, one with new and old rules, but rules t­here ­were. Federal Reserve officials continued to monitor bank headquarters, known to financial personnel as the holding com­pany. As before, the comptroller’s seasoned examiners still checked on bank capital levels and looked at each bank’s books to learn ­whether bad loans ­were piling up. Regulation did not end ­there, ­either. Banks like Weill’s Citigroup that sold stocks and bonds and traded more complex, asset-­backed securities also reported the results of t­ hose operations to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. To be sure, regulators remained scattered, un­co­or­di­nated, and lacking the tools to understand\n\nIntroduction7\n\nhow the financial system’s multiple parts fit together. In contrast, ­t hose supermarket banks like Citigroup and Bank of Amer­i­ca operated as one unit. Yet, for all the tools at their disposal and for all the se­nior executives who reported to them, top bank executives like McColl and Weill had not grasped their firms’ many operations in detail. Similar to regulators at the Federal Reserve and comptroller’s office, bankers such as McColl and Weill never probed how their firms’ strengths, weaknesses, and ties to other banks might affect the financial system as a ­whole. Despite ­t hose awkward features, the new bank system proved successful, at least for a few years. Banking innovations like the ATM and fancy new products like adjustable rate mortgages maintained the idea that bankers served financial markets automatically; and, it seemed, ­t hose bankers fostered prosperity in the form of millions of new mortgages for low-­income Americans. The market, one might believe, had replaced government bureaucrats in building a more inclusive prosperity. That prosperity, moreover, rested in the hands of bank executives with de­cades of experience in building ­t hose nationwide banks. Starting around 2000, a new generation of bank chiefs took over from McColl and ­others who had built and promoted supermarket banking. In making that changeover, ­t hose new bank leaders also maintained continuity with earlier personnel and their ideas. Each of the heads of the largest four banks had direct connections back to Wriston, McColl, or Weill.3 Bank of Amer­i­ca’s Kenneth D. Lewis had worked with successful mentors like ­McColl to merge banks, open branches, and develop the business of cross-­ selling financial products. The idea under­lying cross-­selling was that a bank customer with a mortgage could be persuaded to open a checking account during one visit and take out a credit card and a home equity line of credit in the course of subsequent visits. Like their pre­de­ces­sors, Lewis and o ­ thers who led large banks also assembled mortgages into securities marketed around the world. And again like their mentors, Lewis took short-­term loans to finance ­t hose deals, at leverage ratios of $29 in borrowed money to $1 in his own capital and higher. Bank of Amer­i­ca and Citigroup securities dealers emerged as investment bankers, with the same loose set of regulations about excessive debt. The system worked well, and the high ratio of borrowed money to invested capital magnified the banks’ profitably, as long as homeowners continued to pay their mortgages. Starting around 2006 and continuing for the next several years, large numbers of lower-­income Americans could no longer afford to pay their\n\n8 Introduction\n\nmortgages. ­Those who failed to pay ­were frequently young, black, or brown. Most had sought to improve their lots and join their fellow citizens in the prospect of rising property values and the joy of a home of their own with improved schools for their c­ hildren—­a privilege denied their forebears.4 Lower-­income Americans of any color had not caused the financial crisis. The total of outstanding subprime mortgages, even if each had gone into default, was not large enough to cause the financial havoc that started in ­mid-2007. Speaking directly, the bankruptcy of Lehman B ­ rothers Holdings in ­September 2008, and the ensuing financial chaos, had their origins among ­those short-­term $29-­to-­$1-­and-­higher overnight loans bankers made to one another. Bankers called t­ hose overnight loans by another name, repurchase agreements. By what­ever name, however, banking systems ultimately rested first on a careful evaluation of the quality of collateral to back multimillion-­dollar transactions and next on a fragile trust among bankers and securities traders who worked around the globe and had never met.5 And as it turned out, not even the most experienced and probing bankers and regulators could understand and evaluate the vast networks of loans, mortgage-­backed securities, and still other complex financial products that characterized standard and extremely lucrative practice at Lehman or Bank of Amer­i­ca. (A mortgage-­backed security is a type of asset-­backed security.) This system, de­cades in the making, was largely invisible even to the best-­ trained regulators and most experienced bankers. Market talk—­comments without end by business and po­liti­cal leaders to the effect that man­ag­ers ­were only following the market’s benign and always sovereign dictates—­had a beguiling effect on every­one’s ability to discern the large financial changes that ­were years in the making. Starting in the 1970s, market talk pervaded e­ very aspect of the American experience. Business executives, lawmakers, and publicists rendered nearly e­ very ­human activity, including marriage choices, food shopping, or vacation destinations, as evidence of the market’s invisible workings. Talk about markets was more congenial than talk about income re­distribution, ­after all. The bank supermarket ideal rested on more than talk. During several ­de­cades, bankers perfected methods for selling mortgages and credit card balances and having them appear a ­little while ­later as salable mortgage and other types of asset-­backed securities. In taking on t­hese im­mense transformations, bank executives removed debt from their books, thus re-\n\nIntroduction9\n\nducing risk and at the same time making more fresh money available to loan. ­Here was a key part of the economic growth machine that trea­sury secretaries and comptrollers such as Regan and Ludwig and bankers like McColl had sought for so long. Trea­sury Secretary Rubin described Ludwig’s regulatory innovations and the Gramm-­Leach-­Bliley Act as part of a financial architecture. The failure of that architecture to work as promised was a sad fact imposed on the millions whose homes dis­appeared to foreclosure o ­ rders. Leh­man’s bankruptcy and the ensuing job and home losses forced most commentators to abandon market talk. Starting in 2009, lawmakers led by President Barack H. Obama refocused attention on efforts to tighten bank regulations. As yet another irony, government assumed a temporary prominence exactly at the moment that Americans lost confidence in financial ­experts and the po­liti­cal leaders who followed their advice. I deci­ded to follow this story through two additional turns in bank politics. In the first, I sought to understand the origins of the Dodd-­Frank Act of 2010. Trea­sury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other authors of that legislation created complex rules for bankers dealing with ­matters like capital requirements. As part of that complexity, Dodd-­Frank’s authors added an idea first proposed by former Federal Reserve chair Paul A. Volcker. The Volcker Rule, as it was labeled, limited the ability of bankers to use bank funds to trade securities. Safety for bank funds and avoidance of another financial calamity served as the overriding symbols in securing the Volcker Rule’s approval. Government, it appeared, was back in the ­saddle. Dispossessed homeowners ­were left to hope for an uptick in ­t hose much discussed markets. In the second turn, I focus on Rep. Thomas Jeb Hensarling’s efforts starting in 2010 to eliminate the Volcker Rule and the Dodd-­Frank Act. I had never studied or written about a lawmaker like Hensarling. I found much to admire. Hensarling appeared charming, determined, and inexhaustible. He was, by my judgment, a superior phrasemaker. Hensarling’s legislative priorities reminded me in part of ­those small bankers and their champion, Wright Patman. During the 1960s, he and his mostly small city banker allies fought the fight against Comptroller Saxon’s efforts to mobilize big bankers to the prospect of developing large and threatening branch networks. Hensarling, in the language of con­temporary American politics, was a conservative. He detested large government, high taxes, and regulations that limited business o ­ wners’ freedom of action. Hensarling aligned with President Donald J. Trump. W ­ ere the rules for supermarket and smaller bankers\n\n10 Introduction\n\nchanged, each contended, the economy would boom once again. Trump, however, lacked Hensarling’s ability to focus on impor­tant symbols like freedom and then marshal members of the U.S. Senate and House t­ oward a legislative outcome. My study of bank politics is a study of the politics of economic growth. During a period of more than fifty years, my key actors, including Saxon, Clinton, Weill, Geithner, and the ­others, sought a formula to hook supermarket banks to that much sought-­after and talked-­about growth. In 2017, bankers, lawmakers, and many o ­ thers w ­ ere still looking and still talking as if that one right growth formula resided just around the next policy corner. ­Every few years, po­liti­cal realignments presented opportunities to bankers and lawmakers to shift legislative and regulatory attention a few degrees ­toward favored parts of the financial ser­v ices field. To do so, Hensarling, Trump, and newly resurgent small bankers had to mobilize co­a li­tions and link their proposals to time-­honored symbols like economic growth and personal freedom. ­W hether in 1961, with Kennedy and Saxon, or in 2017, with Trump and Hensarling, bank politics had a grinding quality.6 Among participants in this exhausting business, including Clinton, Weill, and Hensarling, the creation of networks among lawmakers, regulators, and bankers that would support a reframing of financial markets represented their highest form of po­liti­cal expression. No one who had paid attention to banking since 1961 could have doubted that the federal government made markets.7 And surely, no one could have doubted that success in bank politics required perseverance and luck. The biggest winners, including Walter Wriston, Sandy Weill, Bill Clinton, and Barack Obama, possessed the patience and skill to assem­ble large networks and appropriate venerated symbols like freedom and safety. Wriston, Weill, and Clinton, to take note only of t­ hose three among many supermarket bank enthusiasts, ­were willing to negotiate, litigate, and lobby across de­cades ­toward outcomes that ­were never certain and that w ­ ere in turn likely to be promptly challenged and maybe overturned by leaders of other networks of bankers, lawmakers, and regulators. In1961, James J. Saxon helped launch the movement t­ oward supermarket banks. Saxon launched that effort before Americans had heard of deregulation.8\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation: John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and James Saxon\n\nOn September 6, 1960, presidential candidate John F. Kennedy “pledge[d] . . . ​ an administration that ­w ill get this Nation moving again.” During his one thousand days in office, Kennedy’s growth prescriptions included tax reductions, accelerated spending for the military and space exploration, and reor­ga­ni­za­tion of federal agencies as diverse as the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. As yet another economy-­expanding idea, Kennedy wanted regulators to make it easier for commercial bankers to write more loans. In the early 1960s, however, few in Congress ­were prepared to risk ­careers to advocate for looser bank regulations. Just as much, most bankers expressed no interest in changing the rules that guided taking deposits and writing loans. Bank executives ­were often “plodding and unimaginative, with a pronounced tendency to be hereditary,” a business historian l­ater determined.1 Kennedy, in other words, had few allies in his quest to change bank rules and speed economic growth. Kennedy launched his quest to modify bank rules by appointing James J. Saxon to the post of comptroller of the currency. Although most Americans had never heard of the comptroller’s office, Saxon and his small staff actually served as the federal government’s principal bank regulator. The comptroller’s rules governed ­every banker operating with a federal charter; and the comptroller deci­ded who received t­ hose charters. Appointing Saxon to the comptroller’s post was only a modest first step in the long road to changing the way bankers operated. Nothing about ­Kennedy’s initiatives and the subsequent changes in bank regulations took place easily, and they certainly w ­ ere never automatic in nature. Beginning in the late 1960s, a few bank officers, led by the gigantic First National City\n\n14\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nBank’s Walter B. Wriston, joined with Saxon’s successors in the comptroller’s office and with sitting presidents to press their case for fewer restrictions in the way government permitted them to conduct business. Still other bankers opposed t­ hose changes. Bankers, it turns out, w ­ ere rarely united on policy questions. But, most impor­tant, ­every president of the United States ­a fter Kennedy—­f rom Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1960s to Donald J. Trump in 2017—­looked for legislative and administrative devices to foster bank growth and the economic development judged certain to follow. Words and ideas surely mattered in the quest to change bankers’ ways. In line with the favored words Americans used to talk about the economy, presidents and bankers like Wriston always cited abstractions such as a ­free market to describe the changes they wanted to bring about. But, in fact, the rules government officials and bankers put in place between 1961 and 2017 actually fixed the rules for ­t hose markets. Government made bankers’ markets; and persuading lawmakers and regulators to make t­hose bankers’ markets still larger, faster, and then safer, it turns out, was a presidential proj­ect that endured across more than six de­cades. In order to understand the seeming paradox of bankers’ and lawmakers’ re­sis­tance to changes in the rules of the commercial banking that Saxon first brought into being, we first must understand the way that bankers conducted business at the start of the 1960s.\n\nConservative Bankers, Protective Lawmakers, and James J. Saxon American bankers during the Kennedy era fashioned themselves both as the paragons of a cap­i­tal­ist economy and as sober evaluators of loan applications. Their loans allowed business o ­ wners and executives to purchase inventories, invest in new equipment, and meet payrolls. And in turn, bankers’ loans to businesses served as an impor­tant ­factor in the prosperity that millions of Americans enjoyed daily in the form of suburban homes, new automobiles, home appliances, and maybe even tickets on jet airplanes for holidays in ­Miami, Hawaii, and Eu­rope. By this way of thinking, bankers served as the bedrock for a dynamic capitalism. During the1960s, only a few like Saxon dared to question the business decisions of sensible and respected bankers. But the plain truth was that commercial bankers operated in a rule-­ bound environment created during the Depression era. In 1933, as noted\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation15\n\nearlier, members of Congress and President Franklin D. Roo­se­velt approved the Glass-­Steagall Act. Bankers w ­ ere to stick to the business of taking deposits and making loans, and they ­were to stay out of riskier areas like underwriting stock issues. The Glass-­Steagall Act also required large banks that offered both checking and securities ser­v ices to break in two. The ­great J. P. Morgan & Co., for example, emerged as Morgan Stanley & Co., an investment bank prohibited from offering checking accounts, and as J. P. Morgan & Co., a commercial bank barred from underwriting securities issues.2 State lawmakers piled on more rules. Illinois law prohibited executives at Chicago’s mighty First National Bank from opening branches in fast-­ expanding suburbs. Although sixteen states, including North Carolina and California, permitted in-­state branching, legislatures and regulators in eigh­ teen states, including Texas and Illinois, prohibited branch offices. First ­National Bank executives or executives at any bank operating ­under a federal charter also needed federal regulators’ approval to merge with a bank located in that state or even up the street. In the early 1960s, some 13,500 commercial banks operated in the United States, but officers of no more than 100 competed for large corporate deposits in other states. Small banks, with limited capital, offered ser­v ices in their towns and neighborhoods. Additional rules fixed bank practice in considerable detail. Federal officials determined the interest rate bankers paid savers, which eliminated price competition among them. In short, law, regulation, and custom largely fixed bankers’ way of conducting business. Th ­ ose laws and customs in turn applied with equal force in the decisions of officers at the smallest, farm-­belt banks as well as among executives at the nation’s largest banks, such as San Francisco’s Bank of Amer­i­ca and New York’s First National City Bank. (In 1976, Walter Wriston changed his firm’s name to Citibank.) Most bankers in turn endorsed ­t hose tight restrictions in theme and detail. Heads of the largest banks, including David Rocke­fel­ler at the storied Chase Manhattan Bank, participated willingly in a regulatory system that guided them ­toward steady growth, predictable profits, and security for capital. In 1960, the sixty-­story Chase Manhattan headquarters opened across the street from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, putting in concrete and spatial terms the mostly cooperative relationships between Chase’s officers and power­f ul Federal Reserve officials. Again, w ­ hether among most bankers or public officials, to think about a substantial reworking of ­t hese time-­honored rules about interest rates and nationwide branch banking was to think the unthinkable.\n\n16\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nCongress was not the place to amend ­t hese rules. Congressional leaders had regularly pledged their support to the maintenance of ­t hese many regulations. Starting in 1929, as a critical example, Rep. Wright Patman (D-­TX) kept a wary eye open for any effort to modify the rules that threatened his small-­town bankers, local businessmen, and their farm customers. In 1933, Patman was among the members who approved the Glass-­Steagall Act, forcing commercial and investment bankers to break their firms in two and stop ­doing business with each other. In 1956, members of Congress, including Patman, tightened bank rules again. To reinforce the protection that state bound­aries offered bankers, members of Congress determined that a banker seeking business in another state would have to be invited in by the legislature, which would surely not prove an easy undertaking. “We have boarded up the big hole in the barn door,” one of the congressional supporters announced.3 The Glass-­Steagall Act of 1933 and the 1956 legislation set the framework within which bankers operated when Kennedy took office. And yet, as one of the curious idioms of American life, bankers along with most Americans included banking as another example of their much-­extolled system of f­ ree enterprise. Kennedy inherited this rule-­bound system. The new president, who had promised to speed up a sluggish economy, was not about to invest limited resources to launch a frontal assault on self-­satisfied bankers, state lawmakers, and avid congressional watchdogs like Patman. Since World War II, the president was the economic commander in chief, but members of Congress had never created devices to enable the president to take a direct role in economic development. And besides, no one could say for certain—at least based on hard evidence—­t hat loosening restrictions on bankers to merge and open branches would speed the economy’s growth. During the late 1920s, the last time it was attempted, the nation fell into depression and millions lost their homes and savings. Three de­cades l­ater, President Kennedy was willing to try out the idea of fewer restrictions once again. But he mostly had to go it alone. He chose to proceed slowly and carefully in the face of wide and deep opposition. Kennedy selected a path of indirection to speed up banking and the larger economy. He would bring about changes in banking by making a key appointment. In November 1961, Kennedy invoked the mighty authority of the presidential office to appoint James J. Saxon as the nation’s comptroller of the currency. Saxon was forty-­seven years old. He had earned an undergraduate degree at St. John’s College in Toledo, where he grew up. L ­ ater, Saxon\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation17\n\ngraduated from Georgetown University’s law school. Saxon also took gradu­ ate level courses in economics and finance at Catholic University. By 1966, according to a New York Times writer, the “pugnacious” Saxon had “shaken the financial world” during his term as comptroller.4 At quick glance, the comptroller’s office was an unlikely place from which to launch a challenge to bank rules and bankers’ habits built up since Glass-­ Steagall’s passage nearly three de­cades earlier. In 1863, members of a Civil War Congress had created the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to oversee the new system of national banks. The comptroller’s office operated as a largely in­de­pen­dent agency within the Department of the Trea­sury. A ­century l­ater, the comptroller remained among the federal government’s chief bank regulators, alongside the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In several areas, the comptroller was the first among equals. The comptroller approved e­ very national bank charter. L ­ ater, the comptroller’s examiners inspected ­t hose banks’ books for compliance with federal law and the comptroller’s rules. The understaffed comptroller’s office was obscure, potentially power­f ul, and susceptible to a strong administrator’s shaping directions. In Kennedy’s savvy hands, Saxon’s appointment as comptroller offered a lonely outpost in his plan to speed up banking without having to work with Congress or seek to overcome standpat bankers and intransigent lawmakers like Congressman Patman. To be sure, the Senate had to consent to Saxon’s appointment, which was for the standard five-­year term. But the comptroller’s office was financially in­de­pen­dent. To pay employees and maintain the office, the comptroller levied semiannual assessments on member banks. ­Those same member banks also paid examination fees to the comptroller. Saxon was financially in­de­pen­dent of Congress. Meddlesome congressmen, such as Wright Patman, lacked a direct path to control Saxon or another comptroller who headed off in new directions. Like any federal regulator, moreover, federal law and court holdings largely awarded deference to the administrator’s determinations. In other words, the comptroller’s office contained the potential for ­legal innovations. Up to Saxon’s appointment, however, his pre­ de­ces­sors had chosen not to expand their bound­aries, much like the bankers they regulated. Saxon, once installed in office, was supposed to foster changes in bank rules that sped economic growth. Presidential authority and Saxon’s administrative discretion would substitute for bankers’ inaction and congressional obstruction. Kennedy no doubt hoped that Saxon would somehow prevail in the fearsome politics sure to follow his appointment.\n\n18\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nSeveral years ­later, according to a Time magazine reporter, Saxon remembered simply that Kennedy had urged him to “start stirring ­t hings up.”5 On September 21, 1961, Kennedy submitted Saxon’s name and background materials to the Senate for confirmation. Saxon’s c­areer, which started in the Depression, had followed a series of upward steps. Beginning in 1937, Saxon worked in the U.S. Trea­sury Department, where by 1952, he served as assistant to the secretary. Between 1952 and 1956, Saxon was assistant general counsel to the American Bankers Association (ABA), with headquarters located in Washington, D.C. The ABA was a trade association that represented bankers before Congress and regulatory agencies. Saxon’s assignments included tax and other legislative issues. Starting in 1956, Saxon took up the post of counsel to the First National Bank of Chicago, the city’s largest bank. Up to 1961, Kennedy had not known Saxon. But Saxon enjoyed the support of C. Douglas Dillon, Kennedy’s secretary of the trea­sury, and his undersecretary, Robert V. Roosa.6 In 1961, as Saxon headed for his office in the Trea­sury Department building across from the White House, he had accumulated more than two de­cades’ experience in the complementary realms of litigation, lobbying, bank operations, and federal and state bank politics.\n\nSaxon Goes to Work James Saxon had exchanged a well-­paid, prestigious, and influential post at Chicago’s First National Bank for the limited authority and visibility that inhered in a lowly and largely unknown federal office. In late 1961, about 1,200 employees worked in the comptroller’s office, including 1,000 bank examiners in the field and some 196 employees located in Trea­sury Department offices. With such a small staff, including only five deputies, any comptroller’s ability to learn about bank conditions, assess merger and branch applications, revise bank rules, and enforce administrative ­orders was necessarily limited. The former comptroller had approved several large mergers and, with the ensuing tumult, had to leave the office early.7 Saxon, nevertheless, made merger applications his first order of business. Saxon held his first merger hearing on December 4, several days a­ fter taking office. That hearing spotlighted Saxon’s determination to reor­ga­nize the banking landscape in major ways. The case before him was w ­ hether First National City Bank of New York (where Walter Wriston won promotion to\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation19\n\npresident in 1967) and the National Bank of Westchester, White Plains, New York, deserved the comptroller’s approval to merge operations. Again, e­ very merger between banks holding national charters required the comptroller’s approval in advance. First National City was New York’s second largest bank, ­behind Rocke­fel­ler’s Chase Manhattan, and the nation’s third largest. But in 1961, officials at the Federal Reserve as well as Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy opposed the merger. Th ­ ose officials used words such as “undue concentration” and mono­poly. Saxon, seeking to demonstrate his office’s in­ de­pen­dence in public, sent objections to the merging banks’ attorneys for reply at the hearing. Saxon was supposed to take account of views supplied by the attorney general, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, but authority to approve the merger in the first instance rested squarely and exclusively in Saxon’s hands.8 Legally speaking, however, the attorney general could file a lawsuit to block this merger or any other. Saxon’s responsibilities existed as part of a regulatory regime that allowed top officials to operate at cross-­purposes. Saxon denied the merger request. Antitrust ideals such as ­t hose put forward by the attorney general and Federal Reserve leaders, he contended, had played no part in his decision. The National Bank of Westchester already operated twenty-­six branches. Larger banks brought improved banking ser­ vices and lower costs, Saxon explained to members of the Federal Reserve Board on January 22, 1962. Yet Saxon wanted that growth to take place gradually rather than instantly through merger. The arrival of First National City and other large New York banks in the suburbs, Saxon warned, would unbalance the region’s bank system. Precipitous was Saxon’s word to describe ­t hese merger plans. In a moment, Saxon advertised the comptroller’s office as the arbiter of the size, pace, and geography of bank mergers. Saxon, only recently installed in office, denied a merger sought by executives at the nation’s second largest bank. Saxon had also disagreed in public with leaders of the power­f ul Federal Reserve Board of Governors and with the attorney general, the president’s ­brother.9 In brief, Saxon used the hearing and his decision against the merger to start on a course ­toward making his office the centerpiece of an American bank regulatory system that would emphasize economic growth spread around the United States. Saxon, by any mea­sure, favored bank growth and expansion. Between 1950 and 1961, former comptrollers had approved 468 mergers, consolidations, and purchases among national banks. During 1962–1963 alone, Saxon approved 201 mergers, the opening of 1,490 branch offices, and 295 new bank\n\n20\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\ncharters, including 68 in fast-­growing states such as Florida, Colorado, and Texas. The award of new bank charters and branching rights undercut state regulations that had restricted branch banking. As well, the former comptroller, with fewer merger applications, required five months to make a decision. Saxon reduced the wait time to nine weeks.10 New branches and mergers fit with Saxon’s conviction that American business firms ­were “under-­banked.” Since 1959, Chicago bankers had in fact used ­t hose very words in their effort to persuade the Illinois General Assembly to approve branch banking. Branch offices, if permitted to come into being, ­were supposed to draw deposit funds to the bank’s headquarters and provide improved access to bank ser­vices for residents located in small towns and burgeoning suburbs. In February 1962, moreover, a Wall Street Journal writer used words such as “vexation” and “outrage” to characterize Saxon’s views of Attorney General Kennedy’s efforts to block several mergers. For public purposes, however, Saxon described their relationship as “fine.”11 In short order, Saxon had accelerated the pace of bank consolidation and branch growth; and he made journalists part of his public relations efforts, an adaptation no doubt cultivated during his years as counsel to the American Bankers Association. Several of the mergers Saxon approved created the largest banks in their day. In September 1963, Saxon allowed a combination between San Francisco’s Crocker-­Anglo National Bank and the Citizens National Bank, with headquarters in Los Angeles. Officers of the new firm, the Crocker-­Citizens ­National Bank, managed 202 branch offices and held assets totaling $3.2 billion. The merged operation, once the deal closed, would emerge as California’s fourth largest bank and the nation’s eleventh largest.12 By 1963, the arguments that Saxon and growth-­minded bankers put forward in ­favor of t­hese mergers assumed a codified form that consisted of ­idioms about the advantages of size. Saxon characterized business practices at one of the smaller merger candidates as “quaint.” In contrast, officers at the merged banks would enjoy access to more capital, leading, so the argument ran, to improved ser­v ice to the area’s businesses. In an equally familiar refrain, Crocker president Emmet G. Solomon denied that size limited competition. Quite the opposite, Solomon asserted, as the combined firm would offer tough competition to the larger banks, especially Bank of Amer­i­ca, and help meet the demand for credit among California’s growing businesses. Similarly, Saxon justified another large merger on grounds that the combined bank would be in a position to approve loans up to $6 million to any\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation21\n\none customer, nearly twice as much as before the combination. In his annual report for 1964, Saxon described national banks that ­were now equipped with the ability to stimulate economic growth.13 Americans admired economic growth. Growth, in fact, was one of ­t hose ideas, like markets, that commanded universal allegiance, at least when presented in the abstract. Yet, Saxon’s aggressive rule changes and especially his quick merger approvals had already angered Attorney General Kennedy’s antitrust attorneys. As well, the appearance of large banks like Crocker-­ Citizens, if the trend continued, threatened the livelihoods of smaller bankers, who lacked the capital, personnel, experience, and networks to deal with large corporate customers and mom-and-pop clothing store ­owners all at once. Th ­ ose smaller bankers had already spoken more than once to their representatives in Congress about Saxon’s high-­handed ways. No one disliked Saxon’s actions more than Rep. Wright Patman (D-­TX).\n\nSaxon and Representative Patman In November 1928, Wright Patman won election to Congress. He was thirty-­ five years old. Patman represented a district in East Texas that included small businesses and small towns. Farming was a major activity, but more farmers ­were tenants than ­owners. Few had telephones and fewer had indoor ­running ­water. Like many in such areas during the 1920s and ­later, residents left East Texas in search of steadier incomes and a more comfortable way of life.14 Patman looked to the federal government to foster economic development, especially for the small producers and shop o ­ wners who populated his district and districts like his throughout the United States. Journalists characterized Patman as a populist. During the 1930s, Patman focused his energy on halting the rapid growth of chain stores. They harmed locally owned retailers, he contended. Patman characterized chain stores with terms such as “absentee owner­ship” that produced “absentee responsibility.” If small businesses ­were destroyed, Patman told members of an outdoor audience on March 4, 1936, “the country ­w ill be destroyed.” Patman was only one of many federal and state lawmakers with an interest in blocking chain store growth. Already, between 1931 and 1937, legislators in twenty-­six states had approved bills against chain stores. In June 1936, President Franklin D. Roo­ se­velt signed the Robinson-­Patman Act, which prohibited manufacturers\n\n22\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nand w ­ holesalers from selling their products to chain stores at lower prices than smaller retailers paid.15 Patman’s strug­gle against chain stores served as a run-up to his next major antitrust charge, this time against Saxon’s program of approving bank branches and mergers. In 1963, at age seventy, Patman achieved his lifetime ambition, that of elevation to the chair of the House Banking and Currency Committee. At last, he held a major post at a key congressional crossroads. Patman could initiate legislation, and he could stop it in its tracks. As part of his interest in bank size, Patman maintained a steady focus on bank regulators, ­whether Comptroller Saxon or the larger and more vis­i­ble Federal Reserve Board. If Patman ­were to meet actress Elizabeth Taylor on an uninhabited island, power­ful Texas congressman Samuel T. “Sam” Rayburn said of Patman, he would ask ­whether she knew how the Federal Reserve worked.16 The chairmanship also brought reporters to Patman’s office and to his hearings, where they prepared catchy leads and amusing anecdotes as he sounded off on events, ­people, policies, and regulatory agencies such as the Federal Reserve and the comptroller’s office. As part of that habit of sounding off, Patman also displayed a crankiness that included personal attacks. Starting in 1963, Chairman Patman merged his dislike for big banks with his dislike for James Saxon. In 1963, C. Herschel Schooley joined Patman in a mutual distaste for Saxon and his branch and merger policies. Schooley led the In­de­pen­dent Community Bankers Association (ICBA), a trade group that represented smaller bankers before state and federal governments. From his Washington, D.C., office located on Fifteenth Street, a few blocks from the White House, Schooley served as the in­de­pen­dent bankers’ po­liti­cal strategist and chief lobbyist. Schooley, with years of experience and solid connections among presidential staff and key members of Congress, such as Patman, enjoyed sufficient visibility to write directly to President Kennedy (and ­later to President Lyndon B. Johnson) about the harm Saxon had imposed on his small bank members. Schooley and his top officials ­were also impor­tant enough in national politics to expect a presidential audience to voice their concerns about Saxon’s “divisive in­de­pen­dence.”17 In the meantime, Patman held hearings that provided the national audience Schooley sought. The hearings opened April 30 and ran for several days. Patman had not assembled a large group of witnesses to testify during the course of three days only to gain an understanding of Saxon’s actions. Early in April, Patman had announced his settled conviction “that Comptroller Saxon has been\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation23\n\ntrampling on the rights of state banks and state banking authorities.” The hearings carried a weighty-­sounding title, that of “Conflict of Federal and State Banking Laws.” By common consent, however, lawmakers and bankers thought of t­ hose hearings with a simpler and more ominous title: “the Saxon hearings.”18 Patman’s hearings, however titled, created an opportunity for the officers and supervisors of smaller state banks to restate their case against Saxon’s branching and merger policies. Patman invited S. E. Babington as the first witness. During 1963, Babington served a term as the ICBA’s president. His full-­time job was president of the Brookhaven Bank and Trust Com­pany of Brookhaven, Mississippi. As part of his self-­introduction, Babington reported that Brookhaven’s population stood at eleven thousand and that he had served as a member of the American Bankers Association Agricultural Commission. In one swoop, Babington reminded committee members of his southern roots, his small-­town place of business, and his ser­v ice to the farm community. Babington also linked the ICBA’s 6,200 members located in forty states to the “retention of f­ ree enterprise in banking.” Prior to the start of his formal testimony, Babington had spotlighted respected symbols in American life that any small-­town representative ignored at his po­liti­cal peril. Ultimately, Babington’s argument boiled down to the ­simple but power­f ul notion that Saxon’s rapid approval of mergers and branches had brought about “unhealthy competition” between state and federally chartered banks.19 Subsequent witnesses made equally reverential points about the virtues of a complex system of federal and state banking authorities, known to insiders as the dual banking system. Most basically, the dual banking system included both t­ hose banks chartered and regulated by the comptroller and other, smaller banks that the fifty state bank authorities chartered and regulated. (Several large banks operated ­under state charters.) Schooley’s witnesses had not traveled to Washington, D.C., to provide a civics lesson. Instead, history and law proved favorite topics at the Saxon hearings, as Schooley’s well-­prepared witnesses cited bank legislation and judicial decisions dating to the nineteenth ­century to highlight the supremacy of state bank rules in the face of overweening federal regulators like Saxon. As one example, ICBA attorney Horace R. Hansen determined that Comptroller Saxon’s “zeal” for large banks ran contrary to congressional policy. Left unchecked, Hansen charged, Saxon intended to remodel the American\n\n24\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nbanking system along Eu­ro­pean lines, where a few large banks sponsored “hundreds or thousands of branches.” ­Were Saxon permitted to create such an outrageous situation in the United States, who could doubt that bankers in distant cities would pass negative judgment on loan applications submitted by businessmen in Brookhaven and in ­every other small town. New York and Chicago bankers, ICBA members agreed, could not possibly understand the intricacies of the planting and harvesting seasons. As one example, Georgia leaf tobacco dealers launched marketing programs in July; but V ­ irginia leaf tobacco dealers started their marketing efforts in September.20 As small-­ town bankers well knew, farmers and businesspeople located in the nation’s vast agricultural regions, with their diverse crops and climates, operated ­according to a dif­fer­ent timetable than Chicago ­wholesalers or Detroit manufacturers. H ­ ere, by any reasonable standard, w ­ ere reasons enough to delegitimize Saxon’s merger and branching policies and accelerate his dismissal from the comptroller’s office by firing or impeachment. Schooley’s witnesses such as Babington and Hansen ­were not small-­town rubes; and, they w ­ ere not engaged in a rearguard action against their approaching demise at the hands of large banks in a national economy. Neither had Schooley and Babington awakened recently to the fact that all or most ICBA members provided only a limited range of financial ser­v ices to residents located in their town or in a nearby town. Schooley and Babington had to ask, what if Saxon managed to unhinge David Rocke­fel­ler and his Chase Manhattan executives to open branches and purchase banks nationwide? Schooley’s goal, make no m ­ istake, was to protect his members’ limited fortunes, their esteemed place in small-­town affairs, and their ability to make loan determinations for businessmen who ­were loyal customers, longtime friends, and influential figures in town, city, county, and state politics. When the ICBA attorney Hansen told Patman and his committee members that “commercial credit” offered by local banks served as the “lifeblood of our economy,” in truth he described ICBA members’ desire to retain their coveted space in the po­liti­cal economy of banking, a space that Saxon’s rapid approval of large mergers and branch banking perhaps threatened.21 Schooley and Babington, for all their efforts to sanctify f­ ree enterprise, could never have doubted that politics and public policy had produced the lifeblood that had brought them to their favored positions; and still more politics, they had to realize, was the only device capable of maintaining them in t­ hose positions. In the simplest terms, Patman and Schooley had to move Saxon away from their path. Saxon’s decisions and his sometimes-­aggressive disposition\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation25\n\nencouraged the appearance of staunch and vocal enemies in other quarters of the federal government.\n\nSaxon and the Federal Reserve’s William McChesney Martin William McChesney Martin also wanted Saxon fired. Martin was chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Disagreements between an energized comptroller such as Saxon and Fed chair Martin ­were prob­ably inevitable. In ­t hese many clashes, however, Martin still held most of the cards. Saxon was “about as well known as an assistant postmaster general,” a journalist reported in July 1963. By contrast, in 1938, Martin, at age thirty-­one, was elected president of the New York Stock Exchange, prompting journalists to describe him as Wall Street’s “boy won­der.” Starting in 1951, as the Fed chair, Martin, like his pre­de­ces­sors, enjoyed private meetings with presidents and with influential members of Congress. Journalists reported Martin’s e­ very public observation. In 1965, Prince­ton University conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Martin, citing his “imperturbable wisdom” in guiding the Federal Reserve. During his first ten years as Fed chair, Martin disagreed frequently with Wright Patman, and he disagreed with Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. Martin’s position as an insider and confidant also fostered his ability to stand apart from presidents and legislators on economic policy issues, a position he characterized as the Fed’s po­liti­cal “in­de­pen­dence.” In 1965, Martin was in the stronger position to describe Saxon as “a psychopathetic-­case.”22 The Martin-­Saxon quarrel began with their joint ser­v ice on a presidential committee. On March 28, 1962, Kennedy appointed Saxon, Martin, and other top federal officials to his newly formed Committee on Financial Institutions. Kennedy asked Walter W. Heller, head of his Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), to chair the committee. Kennedy’s appointment letter made a customary reference to “our ­free enterprise system.” In par­tic­u­lar, however, Kennedy urged committee members to consider w ­ hether to develop legislation aimed at fostering development of bank branch offices. With a title like the Committee on Financial Institutions, moreover, Kennedy had rolled commercial banks, savings and loans, securities dealers, and even insurance firms into one. By that standard, Saxon’s program of mergers and branching was in line with the president’s wishes. But the Fed’s Martin opposed Kennedy, and by extension Saxon, on ­those mea­sures. In the course of committee meetings\n\n26\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nthat continued to April 1963, Heller found “a bitterness [between Saxon and Martin] that has to be seen to be believed.”23 The Martin and Saxon dispute, and their growing mutual distaste, spilled from Kennedy’s Committee on Financial Institutions into arguments about additional areas of federal bank regulation. For example, Martin wanted the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to regulate bank stock. In June 1963, however, Saxon urged members of a Senate subcommittee to assign that authority to one of the bank regulatory agencies, an approach that gave his comptroller’s office a shot at taking on this new and impor­tant area. As early as March 1963, moreover, Saxon had sent a memorandum to officers of ­every national bank to advise against submitting to the SEC’s regulation of bank stock.24 Comptroller Saxon dared to challenge Chairman Martin’s authority and prestige. The Saxon-­Martin argument widened into the arcane area of revenue bonds. In June 1963, Saxon awarded permission to national bank officers to underwrite state and local revenue bonds, as, for instance, the bonds issued by a turnpike authority. In 1933, authors of the Glass-­Steagall Act had prohibited bank officers from entering this lucrative and risky field, with only a small exception for what ­were known as state “full faith and credit” bonds. State toll road bonds, however, did not rest on the state’s faith and credit but on a stream of coins that motorists dropped in the toll box. An unexpected decline in the number of toll road users would lower revenues and leave the toll authority without sufficient funds to pay bondholders. As President Kennedy had hoped, Saxon’s administrative action expanded bankers’ authority to make loans. Saxon, often intemperate in his public language, asserted that investment bankers’ control of revenue bonds constituted a “full-­fledged mono­poly.”25 Saxon, by authorizing commercial bankers to enter the revenue bond business, had also cleverly sidestepped Patman as well as the ICBA’s Schooley and their nonstop drumbeat against the growth of large banks. And with equal deftness, Saxon had secured a head start on Martin’s objections to bank underwriting of revenue bonds that was certain to follow. Martin exercised the final word about revenue bonds. In September 1963, officers at Rocke­fel­ler’s mighty Chase Manhattan Bank determined to underwrite a revenue bond issue. They would ­handle Washington State building bonds valued at $35,750,000. Yet, the Chase Manhattan held a New York State charter, and thus resided outside Saxon’s reach and also outside his office’s protection. B ­ ecause Chase Manhattan was a member of the Federal Reserve System, Martin was in a position to rule against Chase officers who had ap-\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation27\n\nproved the deal, and indirectly against Saxon. In September 1963, Martin determined that the bond sale could not proceed, even though Chase officials had purchased the bonds and their resale to investors was already ­under way. “This was an irresponsible act,” Saxon announced, employing language that infrequently penetrated the doors of Chairman Martin’s guarded and august office at Federal Reserve headquarters in Washington, D.C.26\n\nSaxon and President Lyndon Johnson On November 22, 1963, an assassin shot and killed President Kennedy in ­Dallas, Texas. A l­ittle more than two hours l­ater, Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson took the presidential oath of office. Now Saxon had to rely on a new president for crucial support, starting with the ability to remain in office and continue the bank-­expansion program started ­under Kennedy. But Saxon fared poorly in winning support among Johnson’s closest officials. On February 28, 1964, Walter Heller, still the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, described Saxon to Johnson as “dead wrong in riding roughshod” over M ­ artin’s Federal Reserve. Heller urged Johnson to meet with Saxon. At that proposed meeting, Johnson would tell Saxon to “work in harness” or leave. Heller and Johnson, however, could not simply fire Saxon. Federal law required the president to explain the comptroller’s termination to the Senate, which Johnson did not want to do.27 Besides, several top bankers holding national charters had warmed to Saxon’s program of easing restrictions on expansion. Johnson determined not to fire Saxon, allowing his spat with Martin to grow nastier. In March 1964, Saxon told members of the Senate Banking Committee that the Federal Reserve’s regulation of the interest rates that banks paid savers amounted to price fixing. Again, presidential appointees did not speak in that fashion about the Federal Reserve. Perhaps in response, a member of Martin’s Board of Governors asked in public about abolishing the comptroller’s office.28 ­These disputes embarrassed Johnson’s new administration, his top aides contended. Johnson, however, was willing to endure Saxon’s inflammatory comments and the complaints lodged by opponents such as Heller, Martin, and Patman. To put it simply, Saxon ran the only office in the federal government in which top officials urged bankers to merge, branch, and enter new lines of business. Johnson would deflect angry critics like Patman and Martin, ­because Saxon offered something more valuable. Johnson needed Saxon as\n\n28\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nmuch as Kennedy had needed him—to foster economic growth through larger banks, especially when it came to pushing two Texas bank mergers. Johnson, in office only a few weeks, asked John T. Jones, a well-­connected Houston newspaper editor, to secure background information on the pending merger between Houston’s National Bank of Commerce and the Texas ­National Bank of Houston, to create the Texas National Bank of Commerce. “New York banks have done more business in Houston,” Jones reported to Johnson aide Jack J. Valenti on or around December 27, than “any city outside New York.” Jones, likely anticipating Attorney General Kennedy’s objection, added that each merger deserved consideration “on its merits,” as opposed to the view of antitrust attorneys that size alone was sufficient reason to bring a lawsuit in an attempt to block it. “This is what . . . ​[the president] wanted,” Valenti told Jones, and “I’ll go over it with him when he gets in.”29 Early on, Johnson intended to push for creation of Texas banks that would rival New York and Chicago banks in their size and reach. Protecting that merger against Kennedy’s antitrust attorneys remained high on Johnson’s agenda. Five days ­later, on January 2, 1964, Johnson telephoned George R. Brown, a key figure in Houston politics, a longtime Johnson friend and supporter, and among the ­owners of one of the merging banks. (The conversation was secretly recorded.) Johnson and Brown had traded ­favors for de­cades, and now Johnson sought to reassure Brown that the merger would go through. Johnson told Brown about his planned course of action. He would direct Pierre Salinger, President Kennedy’s press secretary and still a member of the Johnson administration, to meet with Saxon. In turn, “­we’ll override the ­whole God-­dammed outfit [Justice Department] and t­ hey’ll do it to hold their own jobs.” ­Whether Salinger and Saxon met remains unclear, but they had no need to do so. On January 13, Saxon approved the merger, a decision Johnson likely knew was forthcoming. That same day, however, Johnson was able to tell Brown in another recorded conversation, “we fi­nally got that order out . . . ​ on your bank t­ hing.” In this case Johnson’s forceful rhe­toric and multiple calls served mostly to impress upon Brown that the president still served as his benefactor. Johnson’s fanciful talk also assumed Brown remained unaware of Saxon’s expedited merger approval pro­cess. In truth, no one needed to persuade James Saxon to approve mergers and new branches that portended increased bank ser­v ices and larger loans to local business executives. Johnson, to maintain his image as a lawmaker willing to push bureaucrats aside to help loyal constituents and promote bank growth, needed Saxon in the comptroller’s office.30 Johnson still needed him t­ here nearly three years l­ater.\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation29\n\nIn September 1966, Saxon approved another Houston-­area bank merger. This new bank, more an acquisition than an assembly of equals, yoked the small Southern National Bank to the much larger First City National Bank of Houston. George Brown, always an impor­tant actor in Houston’s politics and finance, sat on First City’s board. On October 19, Justice Department officials filed a lawsuit to stop this merger, too. Their ­legal reasoning, as always, cited reduced competition and increased concentration. Saxon’s office sent press releases with phrases such as “particularly unreasonable” and contending that w ­ ere “dismayed.” The combined bank “would be a fine t­hing for Houston,” First City’s president asserted.31 Unlike George Brown’s earlier bank merger, Johnson could not pretend to intervene. Nor could the president of the United States disagree in the press with Justice Department attorneys about a high-­visibility topic such as antitrust issues, where arguments ­were always strongly felt. Johnson avoided ­public comment, preferring to make his wishes know through a (recorded) telephone call to a top Justice Department official. On November 23, 1966, Johnson spoke by telephone with Ramsey Clark, the deputy U.S. attorney general. “­There’s no damn reason,” Johnson asserted, “why we got to go from Houston to Dallas to borrow our money.” ­Later in the conversation, Johnson added, “I think w ­ e’re entitled to somebody who’s big enough to meet our demands.” Johnson described the author of antitrust ideas to Clark as “some theorist” who feared “somebody might get some size.” “Well,” Johnson urged, “size sometimes may be justified.” Two years earlier, Saxon had defended the merger of National City and Texas National on grounds that the area’s largest borrowers traveled to banks in New York and Chicago for loans. Banks in Houston should h ­ andle ­those loans, Johnson told Clark in their telephone conversation, virtually repeating Saxon’s argument. Despite Johnson’s bluster and the urgency of his advocacy, late in December Clark petitioned the Supreme Court to stop merger planning.32 The savvy Johnson, at the peak of his presidential authority, failed to pressure se­nior Justice Department officials to drop a lawsuit against a Texas bank merger.\n\nThe Antitrust Tradition and Saxon’s Last Days in Office Proponents of the antitrust tradition led by Attorney General Kennedy and his successors also prevailed in other impor­tant cases. In June 1963, for example, Supreme Court Justice William J. Brennan cited antitrust violations\n\n30\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\nin ruling against the merger of two large Philadelphia banks. That blockbuster ruling overshadowed Saxon’s contention that American businesses needed larger banks capable of writing bigger loans. Brennan’s ruling, a writer in the Duke Law Journal contended soon ­after, would force bankers and regulators to “take notice . . . ​when considering mergers of similar proportions.”33 Justice Department attorneys ­were also winning cases in the lower courts. The u ­ nion of New York City’s Hanover Bank and the Manufacturers Trust Com­pany v­ iolated antitrust laws, a U.S. district court judge ruled in March 1965. Since 1961, the bank, with assets of $6.9 billion, had operated as one, the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Com­pany. New Yorkers knew the combined bank by its nickname “Manny Hanny.” Return the bank to its pre-­merger status, the Justice Department’s lead antitrust attorney recommended several days ­after the judge’s favorable ruling. Manny Hanny’s size, complexity, and more than three years’ operation as a single firm mattered less to antitrust attorneys than the danger the combined firm seemingly posed to bank competition in the New York region. ­Because the two banks operated u ­ nder state rather than federal charters, in September 1961, Federal Reserve officials and state bank regulators had approved the merger.34 The merger’s authorship at the hands of Saxon or Martin was not at issue. Proponents of the antitrust tradition led by Attorney General Kennedy had prevailed. By February 1966, the high stakes and nonstop lobbying in t­ hese merger cases forced members of Congress to take a position. Leaders of the American Bankers Association, including, of course, merging bankers, supported a bill that stripped the attorney general of his authority to block mergers. Patman and his small-­town bankers perceived another effort to undermine their business and their po­liti­cal and social clout. Congress gave something to every­one but did so in a way that heightened anger and distrust. In the ­f uture, Justice Department attorneys would have to file antitrust cases within thirty days ­after Saxon (or the Federal Reserve) had approved a merger. By congressional mandate, Saxon could not authorize a merger during that thirty-­day period. Members of Congress had placed another hammer in the antitrust toolbox.35 But crafty lawmakers permitted all mergers started prior to June 17, 1963, to go forward. That exemption included the much fought over merger that led to the creation of Manufacturers Hanover. In the absence of congressional action, executives of a five-­year-­old bank, with countless business dealings as one unit, would have been required to return operations to their earlier form. A business writer asked ­whether the egg could be “unscrambled.” No won­der\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation31\n\nse­nior Manny Hanny officials had mounted an intense lobbying campaign, even enlisting former President Eisenhower to telephone President Johnson with a request to help protect their merged bank. With tempers ­running high, Johnson’s aides prevailed on congressional leaders to delay legislation, which kept Johnson from appearing too close to it. On February 21, Johnson signed an amendment to the Bank Merger Act of 1960 in private.36 Members of Congress had carved an awkward exclusion from antitrust rules. Despite that exclusion, competition emerged as the predominant standard by which Justice Department attorneys ­were required to mea­sure ­f uture merger proposals. With that act, Johnson lost his ability to ward off antitrust enforcement on behalf of George Brown’s bank merger. Th ­ ere’s “not anything I could do” to protect the merger, Johnson lamented by telephone on September 21, 1966, to Brown, “including stripping down naked.” Johnson’s and Saxon’s freewheeling days as merger advocates had run their ­legal and legislative course.37 By early 1966, Saxon could no longer quickly and reliably deliver the enlarged banks Kennedy and Johnson liked so much. Saxon had also encouraged power­ful enemies. For several years, Wright Patman, Herschel Schooley, and Federal Reserve chair Martin urged Saxon’s ouster, as had Attorney General Robert Kennedy. President Kennedy had not accepted their arguments. Johnson heard identical complaints and determined not to act on them. On February 7, 1965, Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach, still fuming about Saxon’s quick mergers and the decision by members of Congress to grand­ father several of them into place, asked Johnson to remove Saxon “effective ­today.”38 Johnson, in the past, had turned aside negative remarks about Saxon. Instead, Johnson made secret telephone calls to Justice Department officials aimed at blocking antitrust litigation. Now Congress diminished Saxon’s merger authority, leaving his many critics in a stronger position. One of Saxon’s supporters outlined a path ­toward dismissal. On April 21, 1965, First National City Bank president George S. Moore wrote to Jack Valenti, the Johnson aide who had worked on the Houston bank merger case for Johnson. Moore told Valenti what every­one recognized. Saxon had begun the pro­cess of overhauling bank rules. As part of that overhaul, Saxon’s award of new charters and his rapid approval of branches and mergers had thrown state-­chartered bankers into a more competitive environment, which they resisted. Saxon lacked a diplomatic touch in his dealings with U.S. attorneys and with bank regulators such as the Fed’s Martin. Equally, Saxon possessed a “crusader” outlook, which made him unrelenting in his determination to\n\n32\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\npush through a refashioning of the rules that governed commercial bankers. As if to punctuate Moore’s observations, in February 1965 a Los Angeles Times reporter headlined a “banking donnybrook” in which Saxon had become involved with the chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.39 Moore’s key observations came next. Saxon’s replacement, Moore advised, should extend his “progressive policies” and at the same time improve relationships with other bank regulators. Saxon judged his effort to reshape banking essentially complete, Moore added, and he was already looking for another high-­level job. Moore did not need to remind Valenti that Saxon’s eagerness to depart would allow Johnson to avoid an awkward firing. Valenti judged the letter “full of good meat,” which he “chewed on” prior to sharing key points in a memo to Johnson. The importance of Moore’s letter resided only in the fact that a top banker who had followed up on Saxon’s invitations to enter new businesses did not promote his reappointment with Johnson.40 Moore’s highest priority resided in the pursuit of bank and regulatory innovations. Saxon’s messy squabbles with Johnson’s advisers and with influential figures like Federal Reserve chair Martin and Representative Patman threatened ­t hose plans. By late April 1966, presidential aides had cleared a path for Saxon’s departure. Johnson would not reappoint Saxon, but they w ­ ere to exchange complementary letters. Saxon’s departure would go largely unnoticed, and he would be at liberty to secure a top-­level executive position at a higher salary. With his fate determined, in April 1966 Saxon used an interview with a Time writer to s­ ettle scores. Saxon was practicing golf putts on his office rug when the writer arrived. Saxon, dressed as usual in a dark suit and sporting cuff links and a three-­pointed breast pocket handkerchief, affected the image of the relaxed and disinterested golfer/executive. James Saxon was never relaxed; and he was always in control, or sought to be. He had introduced competition into banking, which disturbed “small mono­poly p ­ eople,” an unveiled reference to Schooley, Babington, and their well-­organized colleagues. “If I’d consulted with every­body, we’d still be in the doldrums,” Saxon added. With that shot, Saxon questioned Fed chairman Martin’s management of regulated banks and his oversight of the American economy. In contrast with Martin’s apparent lethargy, Saxon had approved more than six thousand regulatory changes, with many aimed at accelerating bank growth.41 Talk about the doldrums also permitted Saxon to maintain faith with President Kennedy, who had brought him to Washington to help get the economy moving. On November 15, Saxon completed the final day of\n\nDeregulation Before Deregulation33\n\nhis five-­year term. Saxon’s a­ ctual and promised rule changes, w ­ ere they ever carried out in full, portended the elimination of long-­standing bank regulations and a consequent upending of business practices at large banks like Chicago’s First National and at Babington’s small bank in Brookhaven, Mississippi. Instead, Saxon returned to anonymity, first as a se­nior officer at the largest bank in Indiana and soon a­ fter as an attorney in private practice.\n\nThe Challenges of Defending Saxon’s Regulations Johnson appointed William B. Camp to replace Saxon. Camp had worked in the comptroller’s office since 1937, where he ­rose through the ranks. In 1963, Saxon made Camp the second in command, with the title of first deputy comptroller. Camp was almost certainly loyal to Saxon, and he shared Saxon’s views regarding mergers, branches, and allowing banks to enter new lines of business. Camp was a finalist for the comptroller’s job on a presidential list that included a Federal Reserve board governor and several state bank regulators.42 Johnson knew in advance the outlook he wanted in Saxon’s replacement. In Camp, Johnson found a hardworking administrator who would carry Saxon’s merger and branching policies forward. Johnson’s administrative style included deep immersion in policy development and direct ­orders to subordinates, including in­de­pen­dent federal officers such as the comptroller. A few days before announcing Camp’s appointment, Johnson hosted him at his ranch near Austin, Texas. Although no rec­ord exists of their conversations, Johnson prob­ably stressed the importance of extending Saxon’s innovative bank policies and the equal importance of eliminating friction with members of Congress such as Patman and with bank regulators such as Fed chair Martin. Camp, in a follow-up note, described his ranch visit as “one of the highlights of my life,” suggesting the honor he found in their direct conversation and the degree to which Johnson had impressed ideas on him about how to manage the comptroller’s responsibilities.43 The Johnson treatment secured results. In September 1967, Camp told bankers gathered for their annual convention in New York City about the importance of identifying constructive devices to permit them to enter new business arenas. ­Here in unrevised form was Saxon’s call to permit ­t hose bankers to participate in financial sectors such as revenue bonds and insurance sales. Unlike Saxon, however, Camp affirmed the importance of the dual banking system of state and federal regulators and added that it was\n\n34\n\nLawmakers and Regulators\n\ntime to cease disputes. The assembled bankers cheered and applauded Camp’s speech, reported a writer for the American Banker, adding that bankers everywhere judged Camp convivial and cooperative. “I sleep better,” the president of the First National Bank of Leesburg, Florida, wrote Camp in May 1967, with you in the comptroller’s office.44 Few had cheered for Saxon and fewer would have described him in such warm terms. In Camp, Johnson found the ideal person to carry forward ideas that still lacked an or­ga­ nized constituency. In hard-­edged regulatory politics, Camp’s congenial ways brought only modest changes to bank organ­ization. Camp, to be certain, maintained ­Saxon’s emphasis on granting mergers. During 1968, he approved another eighty-­one that finished successfully. The attorney general sued to stop four mergers; and his lawsuits encouraged executives guiding two additional mergers to quit their plans. In t­ hose two cases, Camp’s attorneys repeated favored phrases about how the merged banks would foster economic growth, and the attorney general cited the mergers as likely to produce adverse competitive effects. With a ratio of eighty-­one approved mergers to six denied or abandoned, Camp, by appearances, had maintained the Saxon tradition of granting mergers and guiding them to ­legal success. As a m ­ atter of fact, the denied and abandoned mergers would have created banks that ranked among the largest in their area. For instance, Camp had approved a ­union between two modest-­sized Nevada banks intended to bring about “economic unification of the State now only united po­liti­cally.” 45 A succession of attorneys general starting with Kennedy had coalesced with Patman’s small-­town bankers. Together they mounted the po­liti­cal heights and used them to repel ­those who would permit distant and larger bankers to concentrate resources, expand loan sizes, and dominate the region’s financial business. But again, most of the mergers had gone through. Camp experienced far worse luck in defending Saxon’s decision to permit bankers to enter new lines of business. In 1963, Saxon had authorized bank executives to sell insurance. Only officials at Atlanta’s Citizens & Southern National Bank (C&S) took up the legally and po­liti­cally risky challenge.
