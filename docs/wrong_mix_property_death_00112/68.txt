Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807–82) was a celebrated American poet of the nineteenth century. Born in Portland, Maine to a well-to-do family, Longfellow began writing poetry at an early age: his first poem, “The Battle of Lovell’s Pond,” was published in the Portland Gazette when he was thirteen. After attending Bowdoin College (where he became good friends with Nathaniel Hawthorne) and studying in Europe, Longfellow taught first at Bowdoin and then later at Harvard College. He oversaw Harvard’s modern language program for eighteen years and was honored in 1884 with a bust in the Poet’s Corner of Westminster Abbey, the first time an American had been accorded that tribute.

Decoration Day

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

This poem by America’s Maine-born and favorite “Fireside Poet,” Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1805–82), was one of his last, appearing first in the Atlantic in June 1882, several weeks after his death. Like Mary B. C. Slade’s “Soldier’s Memorial Day”, it speaks of decorating the graves of fallen soldiers. But it does so less floridly, and to different effect.
