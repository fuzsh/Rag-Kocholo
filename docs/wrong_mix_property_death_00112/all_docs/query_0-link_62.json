At the time of this photo, the now iconic 'Salt-and-Pepper Bridge' was called the Cambridge Bridge but was first named the West Boston Bridge. Here you can see construction of the railway on the center reservation by the Boston Elevated Railway that would become the Cambridge-Dorchester Line (know the Red Line) opening in 1912. The bridge would again be renamed in 1927 in honor of local poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.\n\n#ThrowbackThursday #MBTA #publictransit #publictransportation #blackandwhitephotography #train #subway #trolley #Boston #CharlesRiver #construction #LongfellowBridge #CambridgeMA #CambMA\".",
