Synopsis: Longfellow was very successful in responding to the need felt by Americans of his time for a literature of their own, a retelling in verse of the stories and legends of these United States, especially New England. His three most popular narrative poems are thoroughly rooted in American soil. \"Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie\" (1847), an American idyll; \"The Song of Hiawatha\" (1855), the first genuinely native epic in American poetry; and \"The Courtship of Miles Standish\" (1858), a Puritan romance of Longfellow's own ancestors, John Alden and Priscilla Mullens. \"Paul Revere's Ride,\" the best known of the \"Tales of a Wayside Inn\"(1863), is also intensely national. Then, there is a handful of intensely personal, melancholy poems that deal in very successful ways with those themes not commonly thought of as Longfellow's: sorrow, death, frustration, the pathetic drift of humanity's existence. Chief among these are \"My Lost Youth\" (1855), \"Mezzo Cammin\" (1842), \"The Ropewalk\" (1854), \"The Jewish Cemetery at Newport\" (1852), and, most remarkable in its artistic success, \"The Cross of Snow,\" a heartfelt sonnet so personal in its expression of the poet's grief for his dead wife that it remained unpublished until after Longfellow's death. A professor of modern literature at Harvard College, Longfellow did much to educate the general reading public in the literatures of Europe by means of his many anthologies and translations, the most important of which was his masterful rendition in English of Dante's Divine Comedy (1865-67).\n\nLeatherbound.
