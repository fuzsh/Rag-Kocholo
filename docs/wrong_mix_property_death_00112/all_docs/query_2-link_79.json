        "text": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (27 February 1807 – 24 March 1882) was an American poet and one of the five members of the group known as the Fireside Poets.\n\nThe warriors that fought for their country, and bled,\n\nHave sunk to their rest; the damp earth is their bed;\n\nNo stone tells the place where their ashes repose,\n\nNor points out the spot from the graves of their foes.\n\nThey died in their glory, surrounded by fame,\n\nAnd Victory's loud trump their death did proclaim;\n\nThey are dead; but they live in each Patriot's breast,\n\nAnd their names are engraven on honor's bright crest.\n\n\"The Battle of Lovell's Pond,\" poem first published in the Portland Gazette (November 17, 1820).\n\nAnd dimly seen, a tangled mass. Of Walls and woods of light and shade. Stands beckoning up the Stelvio pass Varenna, with its white cascade. I ask myself is this a dream? Will it all vanish into air? Is there a land of such supreme. And perfect beauty anywhere! Sweet vision! Do not fade away; Linger until my heart shall take- Into itself the Summer day And all the beauty of the lake.\n\n[1], Poems of places, Cadenabbia (1872)\n\nAnd, (Lake) Como ! thou, a treasure whom the earth / Keeps to herself, confined as in a depth / Of Abyssinian privacy. I spake / Of thee, thy chestnut woods, and garden plots / Of Indian-corn tended by dark-eyed maids; / Thy lofty steeps, and pathways roofed with vines, / Winding from house to house, from town to town, / Sole link that binds them to each other ; walks, / League after league, and cloistral avenues, / Where silence dwells if music be not there: / While yet a youth undisciplined in verse, / Through fond ambition of that hour, I strove / To chant your praise ; nor can approach you now / Ungreeted by- a more melodious song, / Where tones of nature smoothed by learned art / May flow in lasting current. Like a breeze / Or sunbeam over your domain I passed / In motion without pause; but ye have left / Your beauty with me, a serene accord / Of forms and colors, passive, yet endowed / In their subinissivencss with power as sweet / And gracious, almost might I dare to say, / As virtue is, or goodness; sweet as love, / Or the remembrance of a generous deed, / Or mildest visitation of pure thought, / When God, the giver of all joy, is thanked / Religiously, in silent blessedness; / Sweet as this last herself, for such it is.\n\n[2], Poems of places, Vols. XI–XIII, Lake Como. The Prelude (1876–79)\n\nMusic is the universal language of mankind — poetry their universal pastime and delight.\n\nOutre-Mer.\n\nThere is no Death! What seems so is transition;\n\nThis life of mortal breath\n\nIs but a suburb of the life elysian,\n\nWhose portal we call Death.\n\nResignation, as reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922)\n\nI heard the trailing garments of the Night\n\nSweep through her marble halls!\n\nI saw her sable skirts all fringed with light\n\nFrom the celestial walls!\n\nHymn to the Night, st. 1 (1839).\n\nLook, then, into thine heart, and write!\n\nVoices of the Night, Prelude, st. 19 (1839).\n\nThere is a Reaper, whose name is Death,\n\nAnd, with his sickle keen,\n\nHe reaps the bearded grain at a breath,\n\nAnd the flowers that grow between.\n\nThe Reaper and the Flowers, st. 1 (1839).\n\n\"Ah! this beautiful world!\" said Flemming, with a smile. \"Indeed, I know not what to think of it. Sometimes it is all gladness and sunshine, and Heaven itself lies not far off. And then it changes suddenly; and is dark and sorrowful, and clouds shut out the sky. In the lives of the saddest of us, there are bright days like this, when we feel as if we could take the great world in our arms and kiss it. Then come the gloomy hours, when the fire will neither burn on our hearths nor in our hearts; and all without and within is dismal, cold, and dark. Believe me, every heart has its secret sorrows, which the world knows not, and oftentimes we call a man cold, when he is only sad.\"\n\nHyperion, Bk. III, Ch. IV (1839).\n\nLook not mournfully into the Past. It comes not back again. Wisely improve the Present. It is thine. Go forth to meet the shadowy Future, without fear, and with a manly heart.\n\nHyperion, Bk. IV, Ch. 8 (1839).\n\nThus, seamed with many scars\n\nBursting these prison bars,\n\nUp to its native stars\n\nMy soul ascended!\n\nThere from the flowing bowl\n\nDeep drinks the warrior's soul,\n\nSkoal! to the Northland! skoal!\n\n—Thus the tale ended.\n\nThe Skeleton in Armor, st. 20 (1841).\n\nNo one is so accursed by fate,\n\nNo one so utterly desolate,\n\nBut some heart, though unknown,\n\nResponds unto his own.\n\nEndymion, st. 8 (1842).\n\nThy fate is the common fate of all;\n\nInto each life some rain must fall,\n\nSome days must be dark and dreary.\n\n\"The Rainy Day\", Bentley's Miscellany (December 1841).\n\nI like that ancient Saxon phrase, which calls\n\nThe burial-ground God's-Acre! It is just;\n\nIt consecrates each grave within its walls,\n\nAnd breathes a benison o'er the sleeping dust.\n\nGod's-Acre, st. 1 (1842).\n\nStanding, with reluctant feet,\n\nWhere the brook and river meet,\n\nWomanhood and childhood fleet!\n\nMaidenhood, st. 3 (1842).\n\nO thou child of many prayers!\n\nLife hath quicksands; life hath snares!\n\nMaidenhood, st. 9 (1842).\n\nThe shades of night were falling fast,\n\nAs through an Alpine village passed\n\nA youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,\n\nA banner with the strange device,\n\nExcelsior!\n\nExcelsior, st. 1 (1842).\n\nStars of the summer night!\n\nFar in yon azure deeps,\n\nHide, hide your golden light!\n\nShe sleeps!\n\nMy lady sleeps!\n\nThe Spanish Student, Act I, sc. iii (serenade) (1843).\n\nShe floats upon the river of his thoughts.\n\nThe Spanish Student, Act II, sc. iii (1843).\n\nI stood on the bridge at midnight,\n\nAs the clocks were striking the hour,\n\nAnd the moon rose o'er the city,\n\nBehind the dark church-tower.\n\nThe Bridge, st. 1 (1845).\n\nNever here, forever there,\n\nWhere all parting, pain, and care,\n\nAnd death, and time shall disappear,—\n\nForever there, but never here!\n\nThe horologe of Eternity\n\nSayeth this incessantly,—\n\n\"Forever — never!\n\nNever — forever!\"\n\nThe Old Clock on the Stairs, st. 9 (1845).\n\nI shot an arrow into the air,\n\nIt fell to earth, I knew not where.\n\nThe Arrow and the Song, st. 1 (1845).\n\nAnd the song, from beginning to end,\n\nI found again in the heart of a friend.\n\nThe Arrow and the Song, st. 3.\n\nIn the valley of the Pegnitz, where,\n\nAcross broad meadow-lands,\n\nRise the blue Franconian mountains,\n\nNuremburg, the ancient, stands.\n\nQuaint old town of toil and traffic,\n\nQuaint old town of art and song,\n\nMemories haunt thy pointed gables,\n\nLike the rooks that round thee throng.\n\nNuremburg (1846).\n\nO holy trust! O endless sense of rest!\n\nLike the beloved John\n\nTo lay his head upon the Saviour's breast,\n\nAnd thus to journey on!\n\n\"Hymn, For my Brother's Ordination\", The Seaside and the Fireside (1850).\n\nThere is no flock, however watched and tended,\n\nBut one dead lamb is there!\n\nThere is no fireside, howsoe'er defended,\n\nBut has one vacant chair!\n\nResignation, st. 1 (1849).\n\nThere is no Death! What seems so is transition;\n\nThis life of mortal breath\n\nIs but a suburb of the life elysian,\n\nWhose portal we call Death.\n\nResignation, st. 5.\n\nIn the elder days of Art,\n\nBuilders wrought with greatest care\n\nEach minute and unseen part;\n\nFor the gods see everywhere.\n\nThe Builders (1849).\n\nNothing useless is, or low;\n\nEach thing in its place is best;\n\nAnd what seems but idle show\n\nStrengthens and supports the rest.\n\nThe Builders, st. 2 (1849).\n\nGod sent his Singers upon earth\n\nWith songs of sadness and of mirth,\n\nThat they might touch the hearts of men,\n\nAnd bring them back to heaven again.\n\nThe Singers, st. 1 (1849).\n\nBut the great Master said, \"I see\n\nNo best in kind, but in degree;\n\nI gave a various gift to each,\n\nTo charm, to strengthen, and to teach.\n\nThe Singers, st. 6.\n\nIf we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.\n\nDriftwood (1857).\n\nSt. Augustine! well hast thou said,\n\nThat of our vices we can frame\n\nA ladder, if we will but tread\n\nBeneath our feet each deed of shame!\n\nThe Ladder of St. Augustine, st. 1 (1858).\n\nThe heights by great men reached and kept\n\nWere not attained by sudden flight,\n\nBut they, while their companions slept,\n\nWere toiling upward in the night.\n\nThe Ladder of St. Augustine, st. 10.\n\nThe trees are white with dust, that o'er their sleep\n\nWave their broad curtains in the south-wind's breath,\n\nWhile underneath such leafy tents they keep\n\nThe long, mysterious Exodus of Death.\n\nThe Jewish Cemetery at Newport, st. 2 (1858).\n\nA boy's will is the wind's will,\n\nAnd the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts.\n\nMy Lost Youth, refrain (1858), quoting Olaus Sirma\n\nA Lady with a Lamp shall stand\n\nIn the great history of the land,\n\nA noble type of good,\n\nHeroic womanhood.\n\nSanta Filomena, st. 10 (1858).\n\nYe are better than all the ballads\n\nThat ever were sung or said;\n\nFor ye are living poems,\n\nAnd all the rest are dead.\n\nChildren, st. 9 (1858).\n\nBetween the dark and the daylight,\n\nWhen the night is beginning to lower,\n\nComes a pause in the day's occupation,\n\nThat is known as the Children's Hour.\n\nThe Children's Hour, St. 1 (1860).\n\nI hear in the chamber above me\n\nThe patter of little feet,\n\nThe sound of a door that is opened,\n\nAnd voices soft and sweet.\n\nThe Children's Hour, St. 2.\n\nTime has laid his hand\n\nUpon my heart, gently, not smiting it,\n\nBut as a harper lays his open palm\n\nUpon his harp, to deaden its vibrations.\n\nThe Golden Legend, Pt. IV, The Cloisters (1872).\n\nThe grave itself is but a covered bridge,\n\nLeading from light to light, through a brief darkness!\n\nThe Golden Legend, Pt. V, A Covered Bridge at Lucerne.\n\nI think I have proved, by profound researches,\n\nThe error of all those doctrines so vicious\n\nOf the old Areopagite Dyonisius,\n\nThat are making such terrible work in the churches,\n\nBy Michael the Stammerer sent from the East,\n\nAnd done into Latin by that Scottish beast,\n\nErigena Johannes, who dares to maintain,\n\nIn the face of the truth, the error infernal,\n\nThat the universe is and must be eternal;\n\nAt first laying down, as a fact fundamental,\n\nThat nothing with God can be accidental;\n\nThen asserting that God before the creation\n\nCould not have existed, because it is plain\n\nThat, had he existed, he would have created;\n\nWhich is begging the question that should be debated,\n\nAnd moveth me less to anger than laughter.\n\nAll nature, he holds, is a respiration\n\nOf the Spirit of God, who, in breathing hereafter\n\nWill inhale it into his bosom again,\n\nSo that nothing but God alone will remain.\n\nThe Golden Legend, Pt. VI, A travelling Scholastic affixing his Theses to the gate of the College.\n\nTurn, turn, my wheel! All things must change\n\nTo something new, to something strange;\n\nNothing that is can pause or stay;\n\nThe moon will wax, the moon will wane,\n\nThe mist and cloud will turn to rain,\n\nThe rain to mist and cloud again,\n\nTo-morrow be to-day.\n\nKéramos, st. 3 (1878).\n\nThine was the prophet's vision, thine\n\nThe exaltation, the divine\n\nInsanity of noble minds,\n\nThat never falters nor abates,\n\nBut labors and endures and waits,\n\nTill all that it foresees it finds\n\nOr what it can not find creates.\n\nKéramos, st. 9 (1878).\n\nArt is the child of Nature; yes,\n\nHer darling child, in whom we trace\n\nThe features of the mother's face,\n\nHer aspect and her attitude,\n\nAll her majestic loveliness\n\nChastened and softened and subdued\n\nInto a more attractive grace,\n\nAnd with a human sense imbued.\n\nHe is the greatest artist, then,\n\nWhether of pencil or of pen,\n\nWho follows Nature.\n\nKéramos, st. 29.\n\nWhat land is this? Yon pretty town\n\nIs Delft, with all its wares displayed:\n\nThe pride, the market-place, the crown\n\nAnd centre of the Potter's trade.\n\nKéramos, line 66; reported in Hoyt's New Cyclopedia Of Practical Quotations (1922), p. 187.\n\nThree Silences there are: the first of speech,\n\nThe second of desire, the third of thought;\n\nThis is the lore a Spanish monk, distraught\n\nWith dreams and visions, was the first to teach.\n\nThe Three Silences of Molinos (1878).\n\nThe holiest of all holidays are those\n\nKept by ourselves in silence and apart;\n\nThe secret anniversaries of the heart,\n\nWhen the full river of feeling overflows.\n\nHolidays (1878).\n\nIn the long, sleepless watches of the night,\n\nA gentle face — the face of one long dead —\n\nLooks at me from the wall, where round its head\n\nThe night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.\n\nThe Cross of Snow (1879).\n\nGreat is the art of beginning, but greater the art is of ending;\n\nMany a poem is marred by a superfluous verse.\n\nElegiac Verse, st. 14 (1879).\n\nLines\n\nIn Longfellow’s words, the beauty of Lake Como is so unbelievably paradisiac that he’s worried it can fade away at any moment. Like all kinds of happiness in this life.\n\nNo sound of wheels or hoof-beat breaks\n\nThe silence of the summer day,\n\nAs by the loveliest of all lakes\n\nI while the idle hours away.\n\nI pace the leafy colonnade\n\nWhere level branches of the plane\n\nAbove me weave a roof of shade\n\nImpervious to the sun and rain.\n\nAt times a sudden rush of air\n\nFlutters the lazy leaves o'erhead,\n\nAnd gleams of sunshine toss and flare\n\nLike torches down the path I tread.\n\nBy Somariva's garden gate\n\nI make the marble stairs my seat,\n\nAnd hear the water, as I wait,\n\nLapping the steps beneath my feet.\n\nThe undulation sinks and swells\n\nAlong the stony parapets,\n\nAnd far away the floating bells\n\nTinkle upon the- fisher's nets.\n\nSilent and slow, by tower and town\n\nThe freighted barges come and go,\n\nTheir pendent shadows gliding down\n\nBy town and tower submerged below.\n\nThe hills sweep upward from the shore\n\nWith villas scattered one by one\n\nUpon their wooded spurs, and lower\n\nBellagio blazing in the sun.\n\nAnd dimly seen, a tangled mass\n\nOf walls and woods, of light and shade,\n\nStands beckoning up the Stelvio Pass\n\nVarenna with its white cascade.\n\nI ask myself, Is this a dream?\n\nWill it all vanish into air-?\n\nIs there a land of such supreme\n\nAnd perfect beauty anywhere?\n\nSweel vision! Do not fade away;\n\nLinger until my heart shall take\n\nInto itself the summer day,\n\nAnd all the, beauty of the lake.\n\nLinger until upon my brain\n\nIs stamped an image of the scene,\n\nThen fade into the air again,\n\nAnd be as if thou hadst not been.\n\nThere was a little girl,\n\nWho had a little curl,\n\nRight in the middle of her forehead.\n\nWhen she was good,\n\nShe was very good indeed,\n\nBut when she was bad she was horrid.\n\nThere Was a Little Girl\n\nOften misquoted as \"When she was good/She was very, very good\".\n\nO Bells of San Blas in vain\n\nYe call back the Past again;\n\nThe Past is deaf to your prayer!\n\nOut of the shadows of night\n\nThe world rolls into light;\n\nIt is daybreak everywhere.\n\nThe Bells of San Blas, st. 11 (March 15, 1882).\n\nThough the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small;\n\nThough with patience he stands waiting, with exactness grinds he all.\n\nLongfellow's translation of Friedrich von Logau, \"Retribution\", Sinngedichte III, 2, 24.[3].\n\nHe that respects himself is safe from others; he wears a coat of mail that none can pierce.\n\nFrom 'Michael Angelo' (published posthumously), as included in The poetical works, Houghton Mifflin (1887), p. 316.\n\nThe star of the unconquered will.\n\nThe Light of Stars, reported in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 10th ed.

I see a gleaming light.\n\nOh say, what may it be?\"\n\nBut the father answered never a word,\n\nA frozen corpse was he.\n\nSt. 12.\n\nSuch was the wreck of the Hesperus,\n\nIn the midnight and the snow!\n\nChrist save us all from a death like this,\n\nOn the reef of Norman's Woe!\n\nSt. 22.\n\nUnder a spreading chestnut-tree\n\nThe village smithy stands;\n\nThe smith, a mighty man is he,\n\nWith large and sinewy hands;\n\nAnd the muscles of his brawny arms\n\nAre strong as iron bands.\n\nSt. 1.\n\nHis brow is wet with honest sweat,\n\nHe earns whate'er he can,\n\nAnd looks the whole world in the face,\n\nFor he owes not any man.\n\nSt. 2.\n\nEach morning sees some task begin,\n\nEach evening sees it close\n\nSomething attempted, something done,\n\nHas earned a night's repose.\n\nSt. 7.\n\nThe day is done, and the darkness\n\nFalls from the wings of Night,\n\nAs a feather is wafted downward\n\nFrom an eagle in his flight.\n\nSt. 1.\n\nA feeling of sadness and longing,\n\nThat is not akin to pain,\n\nAnd resembles sorrow only\n\nAs the mist resembles the rain.\n\nSt. 3.\n\nCome, read to me some poem,\n\nSome simple and heartfelt lay,\n\nThat shall soothe this restless feeling,\n\nAnd banish the thoughts of day.\n\nSt. 4.\n\nNot from the grand old masters,\n\nNot from the bards sublime,\n\nWhose distant footsteps echo\n\nThrough the corridors of Time.\n\nSt. 5.\n\nRead from some humbler poet,\n\nWhose songs gushed from his heart,\n\nAs showers from the clouds of summer,\n\nOr tears from the eyelids start.\n\nSt. 7.\n\nAnd the night shall be filled with music,\n\nAnd the cares, that infest the day,\n\nShall fold their tents, like the Arabs,\n\nAnd as silently steal away.\n\nSt. 11.\n\nThis is the forest primeval. The murmuring pines and the hemlocks,\n\nBearded with moss, and in garments green, indistinct in the twilight,\n\nStand like Druids of eld, with voices sad and prophetic,\n\nStand like harpers hoar, with beards that rest on their bosoms.\n\nPrelude.\n\nAlike were they free from\n\nFear, that reigns with the tyrant, and envy, the vice of republics.\n\nNeither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows;\n\nBut their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners;\n\nThere the richest was poor, and the poorest lived in abundance.\n\nPart I, section 1.\n\nWhen she had passed, it seemed like the ceasing of exquisite music.\n\nPart I, section 1.\n\nSilently one by one, in the infinite meadows of heaven,\n\nBlossomed the lovely stars, the forget-me-nots of the angels.\n\nPart I, section 3.\n\nTalk not of wasted affection, affection never was wasted;\n\nIf it enrich not the heart of another, its waters, returning\n\nBack to their springs, like the rain, shall fill them full of refreshment;\n\nThat which the fountain sends forth returns again to the fountain.\n\nPart II, section 1.\n\nSorrow and silence are strong, and patient endurance is godlike.\n\nPart II, section 1.\n\nAnd as she looked around, she saw how Death the consoler,\n\nLaying his hand upon many a heart, had healed it forever.\n\nPart II, section 5.\n\nWe judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing, while others judge us by what we have already done.\n\nChapter 1.\n\nAh, how wonderful is the advent of spring! — the great annual miracle of the blossoming of Aaron's rod, repeated on myriads and myriads of branches! — the gentle progression and growth of herbs, flowers, trees, — gentle and yet irrepressible, — which no force can stay, no violence restrain, like love, that wins its way and cannot be withstood by any human power, because itself is divine power. If spring came but once in a century, instead of once a year, or burst forth with the sound of an earthquake, and not in silence, what wonder and expectation there would be in all hearts to behold the miraculous change! But now the silent succession suggests nothing but necessity. To most men only the cessation of the miracle would be miraculous and the perpetual exercise of God's power seems less wonderful than its withdrawal would be.\n\nChapter 13.\n\nI am more afraid of deserving criticism than of receiving it. I stand in awe of my own opinion. The secret demerits of which we alone, perhaps, are conscious, are often more difficult to bear than those which have been publicly censured in us, and thus in some degree atoned for.\n\nChapter 30.\n\nGive what you have. To someone, it may be better than you dare to think.\n\nChapter 30.\n\nBuild me straight, O worthy Master!\n\nStanch and strong, a goodly vessel,\n\nThat shall laugh at all disaster,\n\nAnd with wave and whirlwind wrestle!\n\nLines 1-4.\n\nFor his heart was in his work, and the heart\n\nGiveth grace unto every Art.\n\nLine 7.\n\nAnd see! she stirs!\n\nShe starts,—she moves,—she seems to feel\n\nThe thrill of life along her keel,\n\nAnd, spurning with her foot the ground,\n\nWith one exulting, joyous bound,\n\nShe leaps into the ocean's arms!\n\nLines 349-354.\n\nSail forth into the sea of life,\n\nO gentle, loving, trusting wife,\n\nAnd safe from all adversity\n\nUpon the bosom of that sea\n\nThy comings and thy goings be!\n\nFor gentleness and love and trust\n\nPrevail o'er angry wave and gust;\n\nAnd in the wreck of noble lives\n\nSomething immortal still survives.\n\nLine 368.\n\nAnd in the wreck of noble lives\n\nSomething immortal still survives.\n\nLines 375-376.\n\nThou, too, sail on, O Ship of State!\n\nSail on, O Union, strong and great!\n\nHumanity with all its fears,\n\nWith all the hopes of future years,\n\nIs hanging breathless on thy fate!\n\nLines 378-382.\n\nOur hearts, our hopes, are all with thee,\n\nOur hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,\n\nOur faith triumphant o'er our fears,\n\nAre all with thee,—are all with thee!\n\nLines 396-399.\n\nMain article: The Song of Hiawatha\n\nThus departed Hiawatha,\n\nHiawatha the Beloved,\n\nIn the glory of the sunset,\n\nIn the purple mists of evening,\n\nTo the regions of the home-wind,\n\nOf the Northwest-Wind, Keewaydin,\n\nTo the Islands of the Blessed,\n\nTo the Kingdom of Ponemah,\n\nTo the Land of the Hereafter!\n\nPt. XXII, Hiawatha's Departure, st. 29.\n\nFirst published in the Blue and Gold edition of Drift-Wood (1857)\n\nDon Quixote thought he could have made beautiful bird-cages and toothpicks if his brain had not been so full of ideas of chivalry. Most people would succeed in small things, if they were not troubled with great ambitions.\n\nA torn jacket is soon mended; but hard words bruise the heart of a child.\n\nDoubtless criticism was originally benignant, pointing out the beauties of a work, rather than its defects. The passions of men have made it malignant, as the bad heart of Procrustes turned the bed, the symbol of repose, into an instrument of torture.\n\nWe often excuse our own want of philanthropy by giving the name of fanaticism to the more ardent zeal of others.\n\nEvery great poem is in itself limited by necessity, — but in its suggestions unlimited and infinite.\n\nIf we could read the secret history of our enemies, we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.\n\nAs turning the logs will make a dull fire burn, so change of studies a dull brain.\n\nThe Laws of Nature are just, but terrible. There is no weak mercy in them. Cause and consequence are inseparable and inevitable. The elements have no forbearance. The fire burns, the water drowns, the air consumes, the earth buries. And perhaps it would be well for our race if the punishment of crimes against the Laws of Man were as inevitable as the punishment of crimes against the Laws of Nature, — were Man as unerring in his judgments as Nature.\n\nRound about what is, lies a whole mysterious world of might be, — a psychological romance of possibilities and things that do not happen. By going out a few minutes sooner or later, by stopping to speak with a friend at a corner, by meeting this man or that, or by turning down this street instead of the other, we may let slip some great occasion of good, or avoid some impending evil, by which the whole current of our lives would have been changed. There is no possible solution to the dark enigma but the one word, \"Providence\".\n\n\"Let us build such a church, that those who come after us shall take us for madmen,\" said the old canon of Seville, when the great cathedral was planned. Perhaps through every mind passes some such thought, when it first entertains the design of a great and seemingly impossible action, the end of which it dimly foresees. This divine madness enters more or less into all our noblest undertakings.\n\nHere Longfellow is translating or paraphrasing an expression attributed to a canon of Seville, also quoted as \"we shall have a church so great and of such a kind that those who see it built will think we were mad\".\n\nI feel a kind of reverence for the first books of young authors. There is so much aspiration in them, so much audacious hope and trembling fear, so much of the heart's history, that all errors and short-comings are for a while lost sight of in the amiable self-assertion of youth.\n\nAuthors have a greater right than any copyright, though it is generally unacknowledged or disregarded. They have a right to the reader's civility. There are favorable hours for reading a book, as for writing it, and to these the author has a claim. Yet many people think that when they buy a book they buy with it the right to abuse the author.\n\nLove makes its record in deeper colors as we grow out of childhood into manhood; as the Emperors signed their names in green ink when under age, but when of age, in purple.\n\nWhen we reflect that all the aspects of Nature, all the emotions of the soul, and all the events of life, have been the subjects of poetry for hundreds and thousands of years, we can hardly wonder that there should be so many resemblances and coincidences of expression among poets, but rather that they are not more numerous and more striking.\n\nThe first pressure of sorrow crushes out from our hearts the best wine; afterwards the constant weight of it brings forth bitterness, — the taste and stain from the lees of the vat.\n\nThe tragic element in poetry is like Saturn in alchemy, — the Malevolent, the Destroyer of Nature ; but without it no true Aurum Potabile, or Elixir of Life, can be made.\n\nIf the great Captain of Plymouth is so very eager to wed me,\n\nWhy does he not come himself, and take the trouble to woo me?\n\nIf I am not worth the wooing, I surely am not worth the winning!\n\nPt. III, The Lover's Errand.\n\nBut as he warmed and glowed, in his simple and eloquent language,\n\nQuite forgetful of self, and full of the praise of his rival,\n\nArchly the maiden smiled, and, with eyes over-running with laughter,\n\nSaid, in a tremulous voice, \"Why don't you speak for yourself, John?\"\n\nPt. III, The Lover's Errand.\n\nGod had sifted three kingdoms to find the wheat for this planting.\n\nPart IV.\n\nInto a world unknown,—the corner-stone of a nation.\n\nPart V; referring to Plymouth Rock\n\nIt is the fate of a woman\n\nLong to be patient and silent, to wait like a ghost that is speechless,\n\nTill some questioning voice dissolves the spell of its silence.\n\nPart VI.\n\nHe is a little chimney and heated hot in a moment.\n\nPart VI\n\nListen, my children, and you shall hear\n\nOf the midnight ride of Paul Revere,\n\nOn the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;\n\nHardly a man is now alive\n\nWho remembers that famous day and year.\n\nPt. I, The Landlord's Tale: Paul Revere's Ride, st. 1.\n\nOne, if by land, and two, if by sea;\n\nAnd I on the opposite shore will be,\n\nReady to ride and spread the alarm\n\nThrough every Middlesex village and farm\n\nFor the country folk to be up and to arm.\n\nPt. I, The Landlord's Tale: Paul Revere's Ride, st. 2.\n\nAnd yet, through the gloom and the light,\n\nThe fate of a nation was riding that night.\n\nPt. I, The Landlord's Tale: Paul Revere's Ride, st. 8.\n\nAll things come round to him who will but wait.\n\nPt. I, The Student's Tale.\n\nA town that boasts inhabitants like me\n\nCan have no lack of good society.\n\nPt. I, The Poet's Tale: The Birds of Killingworth.\n\nHis form was ponderous, and his step was slow;\n\nThere never was so wise a man before;\n\nHe seemed the incarnate \"Well, I told you so!\"\n\nPt. I, The Poet's Tale: The Birds of Killingworth, st. 9.\n\nShips that pass in the night, and speak each other in passing,\n\nOnly a signal shown and a distant voice in the darkness;\n\nSo on the ocean of life we pass and speak one another,\n\nOnly a look and a voice, then darkness again and a silence.\n\nPt. III, The Theologian's Tale: Elizabeth, sec. IV.\n\nAnd suddenly through the drifting brume\n\nThe blare of the horns began to ring.\n\nKing Olaf's War-Horns, st. 2.\n\nStronger than steel is the sword of the Spirit;\n\nSwifter than arrows, the light of the truth;\n\nGreater than anger is love that subdueth.\n\nThe Nun of Nidaros, st. 9.\n\nLet him not boast who puts his armor on\n\nAs he who puts it off, the battle done.\n\nStudy yourselves; and most of all note well\n\nWherein kind Nature meant you to excel.\n\nNot every blossom ripens into fruit.\n\nSt. 11.\n\nAnd now, my classmates; ye remaining few\n\nThat number not the half of those we knew,\n\nYe, against whose familiar names not yet\n\nThe fatal asterisk of death is set,\n\nYe I salute!\n\nSt. 13.\n\nThe scholar and the world! The endless strife,\n\nThe discord in the harmonies of life!\n\nThe love of learning, the sequestered nooks,\n\nAnd all the sweet serenity of books;\n\nThe market-place, the eager love of gain,\n\nWhose aim is vanity, and whose end is pain!\n\nSt. 23.\n\nAh, nothing is too late\n\nTill the tired heart shall cease to palpitate.\n\nSt. 24.\n\nFor age is opportunity no less\n\nThan youth itself, though in another dress,\n\nAnd as the evening twilight fades away\n\nThe sky is filled with stars, invisible by day.\n\nSt. 25.\n\nas quoted in The Complete Poetical Works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1891) pp. 250-256.\n\nHermes:\n\nMuch must he toil who serves the Immortal Gods.\n\nChorus of the Eumenides: ...\n\nWith useless endeavour\n\nForever, forever,\n\nIs Sisyphus rolling\n\nHis stone up the mountain!\n\nPandora, waking: ...\n\nI am alone. These faces in the mirrors\n\nAre but the shadows and phantoms of myself;\n\nThey cannot help nor hinder. No one sees me,\n\nSave the all-seeing Gods...\n\nShe lifts the lid. A dense mist rises from the chest\n\nand fills the room. Pandora falls senseless on\n\nthe floor. Storm without.\n\nChorus of Dreams from the Gate of Horn: ...\n\nFever of the heart and brain,\n\nSorrow, pestilence, and pain,\n\nMoans of anguish, maniac laughter,\n\nAll the evils that hereafter\n\nShall afflict and vex mankind,\n\nAll into the air have risen\n\nFrom the chambers of their prison;\n\nOnly Hope remains behind.\n\nChorus of the Eumenides: ...\n\nNever by lapse of time\n\nThe soul defaced by crime\n\nInto its former self returns again;\n\nFor every guilty deed\n\nHolds in itself the seed\n\nOf retribution and undying pain.\n\nNever shall be the loss\n\nRestored, till Helios\n\nHath purified them with his heavenly fires;\n\nThen what was lost is won,\n\nAnd the new life begun,\n\nKindled with nobler passions and desires.\n\nPublished in The Atlantic (June 1882)\n\nSleep, comrades, sleep and rest\n\nOn this Field of the Grounded Arms,\n\nWhere foes no more molest,\n\nNor sentry’s shot alarms!\n\nYe have slept on the ground before,\n\nAnd started to your feet\n\nAt the cannon’s sudden roar,\n\nOr the drum’s redoubling beat.\n\nBut in this camp of Death\n\nNo sound your slumber breaks;\n\nHere is no fevered breath,\n\nNo wound that bleeds and aches.\n\nAll is repose and peace,\n\nUntrampled lies the sod;\n\nThe shouts of battle cease,\n\nIt is the Truce of God!\n\nRest, comrades, rest and sleep!\n\nThe thoughts of men shall be\n\nAs sentinels to keep\n\nYour rest from danger free.\n\nYour silent tents of green\n\nWe deck with fragrant flowers;\n\nYours has the suffering been,\n\nThe memory shall be ours.\n\nQuotes reported in Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 10th ed. (1919).\n\nHospitality sitting with Gladness.\n\nTranslation from Frithiof's Saga.\n\nWho ne'er his bread in sorrow ate,\n\nWho ne'er the mournful midnight hours\n\nWeeping upon his bed has sate,\n\nHe knows you not, ye Heavenly Powers.\n\nMotto, Hyperion, book i.\n\nSomething the heart must have to cherish,\n\nMust love and joy and sorrow learn;\n\nSomething with passion clasp, or perish\n\nAnd in itself to ashes burn.\n\nHyperion, book ii.\n\nWere half the power that fills the world with terror,\n\nWere half the wealth bestowed on camps and courts,\n\nGiven to redeem the human mind from error,\n\nThere were no need of arsenals and forts.\n\nThe Arsenal at Springfield.\n\nWhere'er a noble deed is wrought,\n\nWhere'er is spoken a noble thought,\n\nOur hearts in glad surprise\n\nTo higher levels rise.\n\nSanta Filomena.\n\nMoons waxed and waned, the lilacs bloomed and died,\n\nIn the broad river ebbed and flowed the tide,\n\nShips went to sea, and ships came home from sea,\n\nAnd the slow years sailed by and ceased to be.\n\nLady Wentworth.\n\nBuild on, and make thy castles high and fair,\n\nRising and reaching upward to the skies;\n\nListen to voices in the upper air,\n\nNor lose thy simple faith in mysteries.\n\nThe Castle-builder.\n\nHe speaketh not; and yet there lies\n\nA conversation in his eyes.\n\nThe Hanging of the Crane.\n\nAll are architects of Fate,\n\nWorking in these walls of Time.\n\nThe Builders.\n\nI know a maiden fair to see,\n\nTake care!\n\nShe can both false and friendly be,\n\nBeware!

Euro-American settlers were nearly all literate, and this was the period of the foundational \"American literature,\" with writers James Fenimore Cooper, Walt Whitman, Edgar Allan Poe, John Greenleaf Whittier, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, James Russell Lowell, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Herman Melville all active-each of whom remains read, revered, and studied in the twenty-first century, as national and nationalist writers, not as colonialists. Although some of the writers, like Melville and Longfellow, paid little attention to the war, most of the others either fiercely supported it or opposed it.\n\nRoxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States (2014)\n\nI wish I had known you,/Longfellow, but truly I did, as a small reader/with a book cracked wide, speaking aloud/on the old wooden stairs of my grandparents' home,/saying your words, between the daylight/and the dark, swinging them like small lanterns/which have brought me to this place/by your bed on a late day in June,/in your yellow house by the giant linden tree,/still wondering at words and the length of a mattress.\n\nNaomi Shihab Nye Voices in the Air (2018)\n\nAnother poem that appeals to all bold, courageous souls in \"The Warning,\" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, who, some critics aver, won more English hearts over to the anti-slavery cause than did the \"Quaker Poet.\n\nKatherine D.
