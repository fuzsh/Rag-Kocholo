Autobiographical fragment, undated.\n\nAlthough he left Portland behind in 1835, the memories of his early years there stayed with Longfellow for the rest of his life:\n\n\"Out of my childhood now rises in my memory the recollection of many things, rather as poetic impressions than as prosaic facts. Such are the damp mornings of early Spring, with the loud crowing of cocks, and the cooing of pigeons on roofs of barns. Very distinct in connection with these are the indefinite longings incident to childhood; feelings of wonder and loneliness, which I could not interpret, and scarcely then took cognizance of. But they have remained in my mind.\"\n\nLongfellow Papers MS Am 1340 (145) folder 4"
