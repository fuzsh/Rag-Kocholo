Blacksmith House includes the Dexter Pratt House, built in 1808. It is here that Henry Wadsworth Longfellow observed the village blacksmith at work under the Spreading Chestnut Tree. This blacksmith is the subject of Longfellow’s famous poem, The Village Blacksmith. In 1870 Mary Walker acquired the Dexter Pratt House when a local family, recognizing the discrimination she faced, bought the house and immediately turned it over to her. Mary Walker had been born into slavery, escaped her owner, made her way to Cambridge, earned wages as a caretaker and seamstress, and spent years trying, via ransom or ruse, to liberate her mother and two younger children. She reunited with her family only after the Civil War.\n\nImmediately following the Second World War, The Window Shop, a Cambridge citizens’ organization that assisted European refugees with training, counseling, and employment, purchased the Blacksmith House. It offered people fleeing from Hitler good jobs in its clothing and crafts shop, tearoom/bakery known for its Viennese pastries, and restaurant that became a gathering place for Europeans, including architect Walter Gropius. The Window Shop also hired African Americans, one of the few businesses in Cambridge to do so in the early 1940s."
