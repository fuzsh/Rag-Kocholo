        "text": "The Vassal-Craigie-Longfellow House at 105 Brattle Street is a gorgeous example of Georgian architecture. Hallmarks of this architectural style include symmetrical building structure, a central front door, a pair of large chimneys that supported fireplaces in each of the four rooms on each side and each floor. The outside of the building includes pilasters (fake pillars for a Classical look referencing ancient Greece and Rome) and a pediment. To learn more about the interior of the house, explore the floorplan to see the structure and layout, which shows some of the changes over time.\n\nThis house dates to 1759 and was built for John Vassal, a wealthy plantation owner at the time. Much of his wealth stemmed from enslaved labor from sugar plantations in the West Indies. This house was once part of a much larger estate as Cambridge was more rural then than it is now. According to records he kept at least seven enslaved individuals in his Cambridge estate. Like many who lived along this street, he was a Tory, or Loyalist to the British Crown. So many of the wealthy residents of this street were Tories that it earned the nickname Tory Row. Some time after the Battle of Lexington and Concord, Vassal and other Tories fled the region as Cambridge became a staging ground for Patriot militia.\n\nDuring the Siege of Boston, but after the Battle of Bunker Hill, the Continental Congress appointed George Washington the head of the Continental Army and asked him to take over the Siege of Boston. When he arrived on July 2, 1775 he chose this home for his headquarters. General Washington resided there from mid July 1775 – April 4, 1776. For just under a year, it was the place where the American Revolution was happening in full force, from the planning meetings to social gatherings. At this home General Washington planned the Siege of Boston, the march to Quebec, organizing the Continental Army, as well as the occupation of Dorchester Heights.\n\nIn November 1775, Martha Washington joined her husband in Cambridge, spending the winter and spring by his side. Her presence became a morale boost for the Continental Army. After the British evacuated Boston, she accompanied her husband to New York, where he predicted the British would strike next.\n\n“Celestial choir! enthron’d in realms of light,\n\nColumbia’s scenes of glorious toils I write.\n\nWhile freedom’s cause her anxious breast alarms,\n\nShe flashes dreadful in refulgent arms.\n\nSee mother earth her offspring’s fate bemoan,\n\nAnd nations gaze at scenes before unknown!\n\nSee the bright beams of heaven’s revolving light\n\nInvolved in sorrows and the veil of night!\n\nThe goddess comes, she moves divinely fair,\n\nOlive and laurel binds her golden hair:\n\nWherever shines this native of the skies,\n\nUnnumber’d charms and recent graces rise.\n\nMuse! bow propitious while my pen relates\n\nHow pour her armies through a thousand gates:\n\nAs when Eolus heaven’s fair face deforms,\n\nEnwrapp’d in tempest and a night of storms;\n\nAstonish’d ocean feels the wild uproar,\n\nThe refluent surges beat the sounding shore;\n\nOr thick as leaves in Autumn’s golden reign,\n\nSuch, and so many, moves the warrior’s train.\n\nIn bright array they seek the work of war,\n\nWhere high unfurl’d the ensign waves in air.\n\nShall I to Washington their praise recite?\n\nEnough thou know’st them in the fields of fight.\n\nThee, first in place and honours,—we demand\n\nThe grace and glory of thy martial band.\n\nFam’d for thy valour, for thy virtues more,\n\nHear every tongue thy guardian aid implore!\n\nOne century scarce perform’d its destined round,\n\nWhen Gallic powers Columbia’s fury found;\n\nAnd so may you, whoever dares disgrace\n\nThe land of freedom’s heaven-defended race!\n\nFix’d are the eyes of nations on the scales,\n\nFor in their hopes Columbia’s arm prevails.\n\nAnon Britannia droops the pensive head,\n\nWhile round increase the rising hills of dead.\n\nAh! cruel blindness to Columbia’s state!\n\nLament thy thirst of boundless power too late.\n\nProceed, great chief, with virtue on thy side,\n\nThy ev’ry action let the goddess guide.\n\nA crown, a mansion, and a throne that shine,\n\nWith gold unfading, Washington! be thine."
