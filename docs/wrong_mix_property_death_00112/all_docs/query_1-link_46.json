        "text": "Advertisements\n\nI happened to be reading something of his, and it does have a nice lyricism to it.\n\nWhat Is There to Love About Longfellow?\n\nHe was the most revered poet of his day. It’s worth trying to figure out why.\n\nHe was, in his heyday, the most famous poet in the English-speaking world. Perhaps T. S. Eliot, in his sports-arena-filling prime, would be a comparable figure. But Eliot was lionized by many people who didn’t read his poetry, whereas Longfellow’s books were devoured not only by the literati but by ordinary readers. When Longfellow was received by Queen Victoria, in 1868, she noticed the servants scuffling to get a glimpse of him. To her amazement, they all knew his poetry. No other visitor had provoked “so peculiar an interest,” she noted. “Such poets wear a crown that is imperishable.”\n\nYet Longfellow’s fame proved to be more perishable than expected.\n\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2...out-longfellow\n\nLongfellow was a poet of the highest order, imo. He and Poe had spats because Poe said his works did not have much literary merit, etc.\n\nAlthough in Cambridge on several vacations I did not get a chance to visit his home or gravesite. Longfellow to me is a master. I do not care much about poetry that is \"too poetic\", I guess is a good way to describe it.\n\nWadsworth, like Wordsworth is easy to read and I can read away with interest, plain, simple, not like many other notables.\n\nHis Poem \"Christmas Bells\" was set to music and introduced the song I heard the bells on Christmas day.\n\nThe Builders\n\nAll are architects of Fate,\n\nWorking in these walls of Time;\n\nSome with massive deeds and great,\n\nSome with ornaments of rhyme.\n\nNothing useless is, or low;\n\nEach thing in its place is best;\n\nAnd what seems but idle show\n\nStrengthens and supports the rest.\n\nFor the structure that we raise,\n\nTime is with materials filled;\n\nOur to-days and yesterdays\n\nAre the blocks with which we build.\n\nTruly shape and fashion these;\n\nLeave no yawning gaps between;\n\nThink not, because no man sees,\n\nSuch things will remain unseen.\n\nIn the elder days of Art,\n\nBuilders wrought with greatest care\n\nEach minute and unseen part;\n\nFor the Gods see everywhere.\n\nLet us do our work as well,\n\nBoth the unseen and the seen;\n\nMake the house, where Gods may dwell,\n\nBeautiful, entire, and clean.\n\nElse our lives are incomplete,\n\nStanding in these walls of Time,\n\nBroken stairways, where the feet\n\nStumble as they seek to climb.\n\nBuild to-day, then, strong and sure,\n\nWith a firm and ample base;\n\nAnd ascending and secure\n\nShall to-morrow find its place.\n\nThus alone can we attain\n\nTo those turrets, where the eye\n\nSees the world as one vast plain,\n\nAnd one boundless reach of sky."
