        "text": "London: George Rutledge & Sons, 1871. Author's Edition. Finely bound by Maclehose of Glasgow in full straight-grain morocco with ornate gilt to spine and boards. All edges brightly gilt. Inner dentelles gilt. Marbled endpapers. Measuring 220 x 160mm and featuring one hundred and seventy-eight engravings. A Near Fine copy with some gentle shelfwear to board edges and corners; foxing throughout, most noticeably to title page and near the illustrations. Contemporary ownership inscription to front endpaper, else unmarked.\n\nKnown best for his works The Song of Hiawatha, Paul Revere's Ride, and The Wreck of the Hesperus, Longfellow was a towering literary figure in his own time. Unafraid to address controversial issues of the day, his works often touched on the anti-slavery movement as well as the treatment of Indigenous peoples. Here, this popular American author's complete works are drawn together in an exceptional signed binding and illustrated luxuriously with engravings by John Gilbert and the Brothers Dalziel.
