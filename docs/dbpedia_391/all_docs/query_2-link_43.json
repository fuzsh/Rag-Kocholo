        "text": "As you probably know, leather does not come off the roll and a skin has a specific shape. For that reason we cannot promise exact sizes, such as with a coupon (approximately 45x50cm) or a quarter hide (approximately 90x100cm) or with a half hide (approximately 90x180cm). Because every skin is unique, the stated sizes indicate the total surface that you will receive. You will therefore not receive a square piece of leather with the exact length and width measurements (an example: if you order a quarter hide of 100x90 cm, it can also be 110x81 cm). Also take some cutting loss into account when selecting the right size for your project.\n\nNevertheless, the piece of leather you order has the same amount as what is described. That's why we try to make everyone happy with the same amount of beautiful leather pieces.\n\nAs you probably know, leather is a natural product, which means that the animal can always suffer from scars and insect bites.\n\nSo that's why it regularly happens that there are holes in the skin. There can be two reasons for this; during slaughter, the skin is cut off the animal and sometimes the butchers are less precise than we would like and then you call it\n\na 'butcher cut';\n\nOr it could be that it's such an ugly spot that the tannery decided to cut it out. But at all times you don't pay for the hole.\n\nThe measuring machine only measures the surface that onsists of leather.\n\nKeep in mind that if you got a piece of leather with a hole, we probably supplied that hide bigger. So that you still have\n\nsomething extra to get your patterns out.\n\nThis is often the case. We always try to give everyone the right amount. Because as you probably know, leather doesn't come off the roll and a skin has a specific shape. It is therefore possible that you did not receive a 45x50cm with a coupon, but perhaps 60x38 or 55x41. Nevertheless, the piece of leather you ordered has the same amount as what is described. This also applies to every size we offer (quarter skin / half skin / whole skin), except for the panels.\n\nWe have had a cutting knife made for this, so they are perfectly cut out at 20x30cm.\n\nDo you need exact easurements? Please let us know in advance by leaving your measurements in the comments field. Then we can take this into account in regards to the products we have in stock.\n\nFirst check whether money has been debited.\n\nHas no money been debited? Then the payment was not successful. You can then place your order again. We do not process orders without successful payment, so you don't have to worry that you will end up receiving two orders.\n\nCheck your spam box, sometimes your order confirmation arrives there.\n\nIf you still cannot find your order confirmation please contact us.\n\n1. Use our contact form to let us know about your return (include your order number).\n\n2. Prepare your product for the return journey:\n\nPack it well and firmly. Preferably use the original packaging. That way the chance of damage is as small as possible and we might be able to make someone else\n\nhappy with it. Do you no longer have the original packaging at home? No problem, if you have another sturdy box, that will do too. As long as the leather is rolled and not folded.\n\n3. Return the package to our store or send it via a delivery service.\n\nPlease read our entire return policy.\n\nOnce we have processed your return, we will refund you within 5 working days. How quickly you have the money in your account depends on your payment method.\n\nYou may get your money back in several parts. This may be because you (partially) paid\n\nthe amount using a gift card or voucher. You will then receive that amount back in the form of shop credit..\n\nIt depends. If you have changed your mind or found out that it is not the right product for your purpose, you must pay the\n\nreturn costs yourself.\n\nIf the product is damaged or if the wrong product has been delivered, the shipping costs are of course on us\n\nPreferably pack the product in the original packaging or otherwise in a sturdy box that you close properly. Always roll up\n\nleather and never fold it.\n\nBring the box to a postal point near you or you can bring it to our store."
