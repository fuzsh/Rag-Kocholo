        "text": "EXOTIC SILVER DOLLARS (CROWNS) OF THE WORLD\n\nIn numismatics, the term \"crown\" refers to the largest circulation silver coins such as the British crown (five shillings or 5/-), the U.S. silver dollar, or the nineteenth century French five Francs, German five Mark, Italian five Lira coins. Generally they are coins with diameters of around 35mm or so and they weigh 25 or so grams (around 0.7 troy oz.). Some countries lowered the silver content of their coins to as low as 0.500 fineness. This trend started in the UK in 1920 where previous silver coins were sterling (0.925 fineness). Other Commonwealth countries followed in later years.\n\nWhilst many countries issued these coins even into the 20th century, there are many from the 19th and earlier centuries from very exotic countries or colonies that do not exist today in the same form they did then. Other interesting ones are included from countries you have no doubt heard of . These coins were coins of the realm up to the mid-1960s when world inflationary economic trends and government spending forced countries to adopt fiat money. Fiat money is that which has no intrinsic value. It is solely reliant on the faith of the issuing government. History is replete with instances where strong countries debased their currency and the citizens paid the piper. This page displays a few of them for numismatists' interest.\n\nToday many countries and bare entities are issuing silver coins, mostly bullion in one ounce size. These coins are minted by various entrepreneurs that contract with the issuing authority to strike the coins. The coins never see the country or locale where they were issued for. Often they commemorate events that have absolutely no connection to the issuing authority. These are called NON CIRCULATING LEGAL TENDER and as such are not considered true coins by real numismatists. Bullion is bullion, so pay bullion prices if you want these but do not pay the sometimes heavy mark-ups applied to these so-called coins! Here is a great example, an one troy ounce silver slug supposedly from Gabon , a small country in central equatorial Africa. Gabon is a former French colony and the official language is French. Note the reverse is in ENGLISH. What does Gabon have relative to a Chinese Panda? Nothing! The seller is asking US$200 for it, the silver content is US$18. Enough said:\n\nThank you to Krause Publications for use of their Standard Catalogs of World Coins for much of the historical information included below.\n\nAFGHANISTAN\n\nThe Islamic State of Afghanistan occupies a mountainous region of Southwest Asia. Presently, about a fifth of the total population lives in exile as refugees, (mostly in Pakistan). It is bordered by Iran, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and China's Sinkiang Province. On 11 September 2001, a terrorist attack on the United States, supported by the Taliban, led to retaliatory strikes by the U.S. Military in coalition with Afghans of a Northern Alliance. The Taliban regime was deposed. During a UN-sponsored conference on Afghanistan that was held in Bonn, Germany, in early November 2001, an agreement was reached for an Interim Authority, under the leadership of Hamid Karzai, to be installed in Afghanistan on 22 December 2001 and to hold power for the following four to six months. A 'loya jirga\" (Grand Council) then established a Transitional Authority with Hamid Karzai as president to prepare for general elections and a new constitution. The national symbol on most coins of the kingdom is a stylized mosque, within which is seen the mihrab, a niche indicating the direction of Mecca, and the minbar, the pulpit, with a flight of steps leading up to it. Inscriptions in Pashtu were first used under the rebel Habibullah, but did not become standard until 1950. Until 1919, coins were dated by the lunar Islamic Hejira calendar (AH), often with the king's regnal year as a second date. The solar Hejira (SH) calendar was introduced in 1919 (1337 AH, 1298 SH). The rebel Habibullah reinstated lunar Hejira dating (AH 1347-50), but the solar calendar was used thereafter. The solar Hejira year begins on the first day of spring, about 21 March. Adding 621 to the SH year yields the AD year in which it begins.\n\nThis is a five Rupee coin minted in 1326 AH (1908 AD). This is a rather large coin weighing 45.6 grams with 0.900 fineness.\n\nALBANIA\n\nThe Republic of Albania, a Balkan republic bounded by Macedonia, Greece, Montenegro, and the Adriatic Sea. Independence from the Ottomans was re-established by revolt in 1912, and the present borders established in 1913 by a conference of European powers, which, in 1914, placed Prince William of Wied on the throne; popular discontent forced his abdication within months. In 1920, following World War I occupancy by several nations, a republic was set up. Ahmed Zogu seized the presidency in 1925, and in 1928 he proclaimed himself king with the title of Zog I. King Zog fled when Italy occupied Albania in 1939 and enthroned King Victor Emanuel of Italy. Upon the surrender of Italy to the Allies in 1943, German troops occupied the country. They withdrew in 1944, and communist partisans seized power, naming Gen. Enver Hoxha provisional president. In 1946, following a victory by the communist front in the 1945 elections, a new constitution modeled on that of the USSR was adopted. In accordance with the constitution of 28 Dec. 1976, the official name of Albania was changed from the Peoples Republic of Albania to the Peoples Socialist Republic of Albania. Albania's former communists were routed in elections, March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest, Sali Berisha was elected as the first non-communist president since World War II. Rexhep Mejdani, elected president in 1997, succeeded him.\n\nThis coin was issued by Pres. Ahmed Zogu in 1927. It was minted at the Venice Mint in Italy. The denomination is 5 Frangs Ar. The obverse has the bust and name of Amet Zogu. The reverse has the country's name in Albanian and Italian. It features a farmer with a team of oxen and a plow. The designers names are below the field. The V denotes the Venice Mint, PROVA means proof coin, and the date and denomination. The coin weighs 25 grams and is of 0.900 fineness.\n\nARGENTINA\n\nArgentina was discovered In 1516 by the Spanish navigator Juan Díaz de Solís. A permanent Spanish colony was established at Buenos Aires In 1580, but the colony developed slowly. When Napoleon conquered Spain, the Argentines set up their own government on 25 May 1810. Independence was formally declared on 9 July 1816. A strong tendency toward local autonomy, fostered by difficult transportation, resulted in a federalized union with much authority left to the states or provinces. Internal conflict through the first halt century of Argentine Independence resulted in a provisional national coinage, chiefly of crown-sized silver. Provincial Issues mainly of minor denominations supplemented this.\n\nThis is a one Peso coin minted in 1882. The obverse features Liberty, the denomination, and the fineness ( 9 decimos = 0.900). The designer's name is below the bust. The reverse has the country's name, the national arms, and the date. Weight is 25 grams of 0.900 fineness..\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\nThe Commonwealth of Australia the smallest continent in the world, is located south of Indonesia between the Indian and Pacific oceans. The first Caucasians to see Australia probably were Portuguese and Spanish navigators of the late 16th century. In 1770, Captain James Cook explored the east coast and annexed it for Great Britain. New South Wales was founded as a penal colony, following the loss of British North America, by Captain Arthur Phillip on 26 January 1788, a date now celebrated as Australia Day. Dates of creation of the six colonies that now comprise the states of the Australian Commonwealth are: New South Wales, 1823; Tasmania, 1825; Western Australia, 1838; South Australia, 1842; Victoria, 1851; Queensland, 1859. The British Parliament approved a constitution providing for the federation of the colonies in 1900. The Commonwealth of Australia came into being in 1901. Australia passed the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act on 9 October 1942, which officially established Australia's complete autonomy in external and Internal affairs, thereby formalizing a situation that had existed for years. Australia is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Elizabeth II is head of State as Queen of Australia. Australia's currency system was changed from Pounds-Shillings-Pence to a decimal system of Dollars and Cents on 14 Feb. 1966.\n\nThis is a five Shilling coin minted in 1937. It weighs 28.28 grams of 0,925 fineness.\n\nAUSTRIA\n\nThe territories later to be known as Austria were overrun in pre-Roman times by various tribes, including the Celts. Upon the fall of the Roman Empire, the country became a margraviate of Charlemagnes Empire. Přemysl Otakar II, King of Bohemia, gained possession in 1252, only to lose the territory to Rudolf of Habsburg in 1276. Thereafter, until World War I, the story of Austria was conducted by the ruling Habsburgs. During the 17th century, Austrian coinage reflected the geo-political strife of three wars. From 1618-1648, the Thirty Years War between northern Protestants and southern Catholics produced low quality, kipperwhipper strikes of 12, 24, 30, 60, 75 and 150 Kreuzer. Later, during the Austrian-Turkish War, 1660-1664, coinages used to maintain soldiers salaries also reported the steady division of Hungarian territories. Finally, between 1683 and 1699, during the second Austrian-Turkish conflict, new issues of 3, 6 and 15 kreuzers were struck, being necessary to help defray mounting expenses of the war effort. During World War I, the Austro-Hungarian Empire was one of the Central Powers with Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey. At the end of the war, the Empire was dismembered and Austria established as an independent republic. In March 1938, Austria was incorporated into Hitlers short-lived Greater German Reich. Allied forces of both East and West occupied Austria in April 1945, and subsequently divided it into 4 zones of military occupation. On 15 May 1955, the 4 powers formally recognized Austria as a sovereign independent democratic state.\n\nThis is an one Thaler piece minted in 1621.

It was raised to the rank of archbishopric in 798. In 1803 Salzburg was secularized and given to an archduke of Austria. In 1803 it was annexed to Austria but years later passed to Bavaria, returning to Austria in 1813. It became a crown land in 1849, remaining so until becoming part of the Austrian Republic in 1918.\n\nThis is a one thaler coin issued by the Archbishop of Salzburg. The term dollar is derived from the German world thaler. This coin was struck in 1625 under Archbishop Paris von Lodron. The obverse has the Madonna holding the Christ child above the coat-of-arms. The legend PARIS-D:G:ARCHI EPS-SAL:SE:APL refers to the Archbishop. The reverse has an image of St. Rudpert with the legend SANCT-RVDPER TVS-EPIS:SALISB and the date of issue 1625.

The first division of the territory occurred in 1190, when separate lines of margraves were established in Baden and in Hachberg. Immediately prior to its extinction in 1418, Hachberg was sold back to Baden, which underwent several minor divisions itself during the next century. Baden acquired most of the Countship of Sponheim from Electoral Pfalz near the end of the 15th century. In 1515, the most significant division of the patrimony took place, in which the Baden-Baden and Baden-(Pforzheim) Durlach lines were established.\n\nThis is an 1876 five mark piece minted at Karlsruhe (mintmark G).

The Bahamas were discovered by Columbus October, 1492, upon his sighting of the island of San Salvador, but Spain made no attempt to settle then. British influence began in 1626 when Charles I granted them to the lord proprietors of Carolina, with settlements in 1629 at New Providence by colonists from the northern territory. Although the Bahamas were temporarily under Spanish control in 1641 and 1703, they continued under British proprietors until 1717, when, as the result of political and economic mismanagement, the civil and military governments were surrendered to the King and the islands designated a British Crown Colony. Full international agreement on British possession of the islands resulted from the Treaty of Versailles in 1783. The Bahamas obtained complete internal self-government under the constitution of 7 Jan. 1964. Full independence was achieved on 10 July 1973. The Bahamas is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Elizabeth II is Head of State as Queen of The Bahamas.\n\nThis is a ten Dollar coin minted in 1973 to celebrate independence. The obverse has Queen Elizabeth II.

Bavaria remained a territory of the Carolingian Empire from that time until 911, when the son of the Count of Scheyern was made duke and began a new line of rulers there. A number of dukes during the next century and a halt were elected emperor, but when the male line became extinct, Empress Agnes gave Bavaria to the Counts of Nordheim in 1061. His descendant, Heinrich XII the Lion, fell out of favor with the emperor and was deposed. The duchy was then entrusted to Otto VI von Wittelsbach, Count of Scheyem and descendant of the counts who had ruled from the early 10th century. Duke Otto I, as he was known from 1180 on, was the ancestor of the dynasty which ruled in Bavaria until 1918 and, from the late 13th century, in the Rhine Palatinate as well. The first of several divisions took place in 1255 when lines In Upper and Lower Bavaria were established. The line in Lower Bavaria became extinct in 1340 and the territory reverted to Upper Bavaria. Meanwhile, the division of Upper Bavaria and the Palatinate took place and was confirmed by treaty in 1329, although the electoral vote residing with the Wittelsbachs was to be held jointly by the two branches. In 1347, Bavaria and all other holdings of the family in Brandenburg, the Tyrol and Holland were divided among six brothers. Munich had become the chief city of the duchy by this time. In 1475, Duke Stephen I, who had reunited most of the family's holdings in Bavaria, died and left three sons who promptly divided their patrimony once again. The lines of lngolstadt, Landshut and Munich were founded, but as the other lines died out, the one seated in Munich regained control of all of Bavaria. Duke Albrecht IV Instituted primogeniture in 1506 and from that time on, Bavaria remained united. When Elector Friedrich V of the Palatinate (Pfalz) was elected King of Bohemia In 1618, an event which helped precipitate the Thirty Years' War, Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria sided with the emperor against his kinsman. The electoral dignity had been given to the Pfalz branch of the Wittelsbachs by the Golden Bull of 1356, a fact which was a source of contention with the Bavarian branch of the family. With the ouster of Friedrich V, Maximilian I obtained the electoral right and control of the Palatinate in 1623, then also ruled over the Upper Palatinate (Oberpfalz) from 1628 until the conclusion of the war and the Peace of Westphalia. The Bavarian Wittelsbachs became extinct in 1777 and the line in Electoral Pfalz acquired Bavaria, thus uniting the two main territories of the dynasty under a single ruler for the first time since the early 14th century. When Napoleon abolished the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, bringing an end to the electoral system, the ruler of Bavaria was raised to the rank of king. The 19th century saw tragedy upon tragedy visit the royal family. Because of his opposition to the parliamentary reform movement, Ludwig I was forced to abdicate in 1848. His grandson, Ludwig II, inspired by his upbringing to spend his fortune building the fairytale castle of Neuschwanstein, was forcibly removed by court nobles and died under mysterious circumstances in 1886. His younger brother, Otto, was declared insane and the kingdom was ruled by his uncle, the beloved Prince Luitpold, as prince regent. Ludwig II, the last King of Bavaria, was forced to abdicate at the end of World War I.\n\nThis is an one Thaler piece minted in 1797. The obverse has Elector Karl Theodore with is titles CAR. TH. D.

The Celtic tribe called Belgae from which Belgium derived its name, was described by Caesar as the most courageous of all the tribes of Gaul. The Belgae eventually capitulated to Rome and the area remained for centuries as a part of the Roman Empire known as Belgica. The eastern part of today's Belgium lies in the Duchy of Lower Lorraine while much of the western parts eventually became the County of Flanders. After further divisions the area came under the control of the Duke of Burgundy from whence it passed under Habsburg control. Charles and Ferdinand, sons of Philip and Johanna, began the separate Spanish and Austrian lines of the Habsburg family. The Burgundian lands, along with the northern provinces that make up present day Netherlands, became the Spanish Netherlands. The northern provinces successfully rebelled and broke away from Habsburg rule in the late 16th century and early 17th century. The southern provinces along with the Duchy of Luxembourg remained under the influence of Spain until the year 1700 when Charles II, last of the Spanish Habsburg line, died without leaving an heir and the Spanish crown went to the Bourbon family of France. The Spanish Netherlands then reverted to the control of the Austrian line of Habsburgs and became the Austrian Netherlands. The Austrian Netherlands along with the Bishopric of Liege fall to the French Republic in 1794. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815 the area was reunited with the Netherlands, but in 1830 independence was gained and the constitutional monarchy of Belgium was established. A large part of the Duchy of Luxembourg was incorporated into Belgium and the first king was Leopold I of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThis is a five Francs coin minted in 1833 .

The British monarch is the head of state and is represented by a governor. Bermuda was discovered by Juan de Bermudez, a Spanish navigator, in about 1503. British influence dates from 1609 when a group of Virginia-bound British colonists under the command of Sir George Somers was shipwrecked on the islands for 10 months. The islands were settled in 1612 by 60 British colonists from the Virginia Colony and became a crown colony in 1684. The earliest coins issued for the island were the \"Hogge Money\" series of 2,3,6 and 12 pence, the name derived from the pig in the obverse design, a recognition of the quantity of such animals then found there. The next issue for Bermuda was the Birmingham coppers of 1793; all locally circulating coinage was demonetized in 1842, when the currency of the United Kingdom became standard. Internal autonomy was obtained by the constitution of 8 June 1968.\n\nThis is an one Crown (five shillings) piece minted in 1959 to celebrate the 350th anniversary of discovery. The obverse has Queen Elizabeth II. The reverse has a map of the island with a the ships Deliverance and Patience. The coin weighs 28.28 grams at 0.925 fineness.\n\nBOLIVIA\n\nBolivia is a landlocked country in west central South America. Much of present day Bolivia was first dominated by the Tiahuanaco Culture ca400 BC. It had in turn been incorporated into the Inca Empire by 1440 AD prior to the arrival of the Spanish, in 1535, who reduced the Indian population to virtual slavery. When Joseph Napoleon was placed upon the throne of occupied Spain in 1809, a fervor of revolutionary activity quickened throughout Alto Peru - culminating in the 1809 Proclamation of Liberty. Sixteen bloody years of struggle ensued before the republic, named for the famed liberator Simon Bolivar, was established on 6 August 1825. Since then Bolivia has survived more than 16 constitutions, 78 Presidents, 3 military juntas and over 160 revolutions.\n\nThe Imperial City of Potosi, founded by Villarroel in 1546, was established in the midst of what is estimated to have been the world's richest silver mines (having produced in excess of 2 billion dollars worth of silver). The first mint, early in 1574, used equipment brought over from Lima. Before that it had been used at La Plata where the operation failed. The oldest type was a cob (\"cob\" is the simplification of the Spanish phrase \"cabo de barra,\" meaning \"end of the bar.\" with the Habsburg arms on the obverse and cross with quartered castles and lions on the reverse. To the heraldic right of the shield (at the left as one faces it) is a \"V\" and, under it, the assayers initial, although in some early examples the \"P\" and assayer can appear to the right of the shield. While production at the \"Casa de Moneda\" was enormous, the quality of the coinage was at times so poor that some 50 were condemned to death by their superiors.\n\nTherefore, by royal decree of 17 Feb. 1651, the design was changed to the quartered castles and lions for the obverse and two crowned pillars of Hercules floating above the sea for the reverse. A new transitional series was introduced in 1651-1652 followed by a new standard design in 1652 and as the last cob type continued on for several years along with the milled pillars and bust pieces from 1767 through 1773. In the final years under Charles Ill the planchet is compact and dumpy, very irregular and of poor style, contrasting sharply with their counterpart denominations of the pillar and bust types. Most pre-decimal coinage of independent Bolivia carries the assayers' initials on the reverse near the rim to the left of the date, in 4 to 5 o'clock position. The mint mark or name appears in the 7 to 8 o'clock area.\n\nThis is a Spanish 8 reales cob issued from Potosi under mint assayer E (Antonio de Ergueta) in 1651. The coin is counterstamped with a crowned F in a beaded circle to revalue the coin to 7½ reales. This coin was recovered from the wreck of the Jesus Maria de la Concepcion from Chantilly Reef, Ecuador in 1654. Problems with debasement of the coinage struck at Potosi in the 1620s-1640s prompted a visit by the Royal Inspector Don Francisco de Nestares Marin, under orders by King Philip IV of Spain, at the end of 1648. Upon completion of the investigation, the order was given in October of 1650 to recall all coinage minted at Potosi since 1625 and prior to the accession of Juan Rodriguez de Rodas (assayer O with dot in middle) to the post of assayer in 1649. All half, 1, and 2 reales, as well as any 4 and 8 reales that were found to be heavily debased, were ordered to be melted, with all 4 reales devalued to 3 reales and 8 reales devalued to 6 reales. To differentiate the good new coinage from 1649 until a completely new design could be implemented in 1652, various countermarks were applied on the 4 and 8 reales to reflect their higher net values of 3¾ reales and 7½ reales respectively. Most of these countermarks bear a crown at the top, with either an initial or monogram or symbol below, all contained within a beaded circle (most common) or simple circle (single line, no beads) or beaded pentagon (rare) or no border (rarest). It is believed that each different countermark was applied in a different location within the Spanish colonies, but it is not known which countermark corresponds to which locale. The coin weighs 27 grams of 0.859 fineness (normal fineness was 0.931).\n\nThis is an 1824 eight reales coin minted at San Luis Potosi. It was the second to the last year of coinage under Spain. The obverse has Fredinand VII with the legend FERDIN . VII . DEI . GRATIA . The reverse has the Spanish arms with the legend HISPAN . ET IND . REX . PTS . 8R . P . J (the assayers' initials P J for Pedro Martin de Albizu and Juan Palomo y Sierra). It weighs 27 grams of 0.896 fineness.\n\nThis is a Bolivian post-independence eight soles coin minted at San Luis Potosi in 1829. The obverse has Gen. Simon Bolivar, for whom the country was named with the legend LIBRE POR LA CONSTITUCION. The reverse has two llamas reclining under a tree with the assayers' initials J.M for Juan Palomo y Sierra and Diego Miguel Lopez. It weighs 27 grams of 0.903 fineness.\n\nBRAZIL\n\nPope Alexander VI issued a decree in 1494 that divided the New World between Spain and Portugal generally based on 270 leagues (932 miles) west of the Azores or Cape Verde islands. Brazil was a Portuguese colony until 1822. Brazil was discovered and claimed for Portugal by Admiral Pedro Alvares Cabral in 1500. Portugal established a settlement in 1532 and proclaimed the area a royal colony in 1549. During the Napoleonic Wars, Dom Joao VI established the seat of Portuguese government in Rio de Janeiro. When he returned to Portugal, his son Dom Pedro I declared Brazil's independence on 7 Sept. 1822, and became emperor of Brazil. The Empire of Brazil was maintained until 1889 when the federal republic was established.\n\nThis Brazilian 960 reis coin was struck over a Spanish 8 reales piece originally minted in Lima Peru in 1816. Most of these pieces were struck over Spanish colonial and domestic minted coins as well as ex-colonies after their independence. This one was minted in Bahia in 1817. You will note that the reverse shows much detail from the original coin, particularly in the triangles off the orb. The silver value of the Spanish coin was 750-800 reis so the authorities made a good profit with this mintage. The obverse legend reads JOANNES DG PORT REGENS ET BRAS D. The reverse legend has SUBQ SIGN NATA STAB. It weighs 27 grams of 0.896 fineness.\n\nThis is Spanish colonial 8 reales piece that was minted in 1804 in San Luis Potosi in then Peru but in today's Bolivia. These coins were officially counterstamped in the state of Minas Gerais with dies having the arms and 960 on the obverse and the Brazilian orb on the reverse. It weighs 27 grams of 0.896 fineness.\n\nThis is a 2000 reis coin minted in 1851. The obverse has the large royal arms with the Latin legend IN HOC S. VINCES and the reverse has the denomination 2000 within a leaved wreath encircled by the legend PETRUS II.D.G.CONST.IMP.ET PERP.BRAS.DEF. It weighs 25.5 grams of 0.917 fineness.\n\nThis is a 2000 reis coin minted in 1855. The obverse has the small royal arms with the Latin legend IN HOC SIGNO VINCES and the reverse has the denomination 2000 within a leaved wreath encircled by the legend PETRUS II.D.G.CONST.IMP.ET PERP.BRAS.DEF. It weighs 25.5 grams of 0.917 fineness.\n\nThis is a 2000 reis coin minted in 1889, the last year of the Empire. The obverse has a bust of Emperor Dom Pedro II PETRUS II.D.G.CONST.IMP.ET PERP.BRAS.DEF. with the date below and the reverse has the royal arms in a leaved wreath with DECRETO DE 1870 at the top and 2000 REIS at the bottom. Weighs 25.5 grams of 0.917 fineness.\n\nBREMEN REPUBLIC\n\nEstablished at about the same time as the bishopric in 787, Bremen was under the control of the bishops and archbishops until Joining the Hanseatic League in 1276. Archbishop Albrecht II granted the mint right to the city in 1369, but this was not formalized by imperial decree until 1541. In 1646, Bremen was raised to free imperial status and continued to strike its own coins into the early 20th century. The city lost its free imperial status in 1803 and was controlled by France from 1806 until 1813. Regaining it independence in 1815, Bremen joined the North German Confederation in 1867 and the German Empire in 1871. Since 1369, there was practically continuous coinage until 1907.\n\nA bishopric was established at the present site of Bremen by St. Wilhad in 787. When the Norse destroyed Hamburg in 848, the archbishop of that city transferred his see to Bremen. Eventually, the connection between the two waned and Bremen remained an archbishopic, which obtained the mint right as early as 888. During the 11th century, this right was extended to allow mints to be established in various towns under Bremen's control. The Protestant Reformation overtook Bremen in 1522, although Catholic episcopal princes attempted to maintain Rome's influence there. At the start of the Thirty Years' War in 1618, however, Protestantism was firmly entrenched in Bremen. The last archbishop was driven from his see by the Swedes in 1644 and Bremen was joined to Verden as a secular duchy. This arrangement was confirmed by the Peace of Westphalia in 1648.\n\nBremen like most other German States retained their hereditary royal families as rulers and issued separate silver and gold coinage in denomination of 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 Marks until the end of World War I.\n\nThis is a Thaler coin minted by the independent republic of Bremen in 1650. The obverse has the imperial crowned eagle with FERDIN:III:D:G:ROM:IMP:SEM:AUGUS: (Ferdinand III by Grace of God Holy Roman Emperor). Mintage was a mere 1627. The reverse has the coat-of-arms of the city with the date 1650 and T.I. (denoting Mintmaster Thomas Isenbein) within the inner circle. The outer ring has MON: NOVA: ARG: REIPUB: BREMENISIS (new silver money of the Bremen Republic). It weighs 29 grams of 0.889 fineness\n\nBURMA\n\nBurma, a country of Southeast Asia fronting on the Bay of Bengal and the Andaman Sea. The first European to reach Burma, in about 1435, was Nicolo Di Conti, a Venetian merchant. During the beginning of the reign of Bodawpaya (1781-1819 AD) the kingdom comprised most of the same area as it does today including Arakan which was taken over in 1784-85. The British East India Company, while unsuccessful in its 1612 effort to establish posts along the Bay of Bengal, was enabled by the Anglo-Burmese Wars of 1824-86 to expand to the whole of Burma and to secure its annexation to British India.\n\nThe coins issued by kings Mindon and Thibaw between 1852 and 1885 circulated in Upper Burma. Indian coins were current in Lower Burma, which was annexed in 1852. Burmese coins are frequently known by the equivalent Indian denominations, although their values are inscribed in Burmese units. Upper Burma was annexed in 1885 and the Burmese coinage remained in circulation until 1889, when Indian coins became current throughout Burma. Coins were again issued in the old Burmese denominations after independence in 1948, but these were replaced by decimal issues in 1952. The Chula-Sakarat (CS) dating is sometimes referred to as BE-Burmese Era and began in 638 AD.\n\nLater years it became a recluse nation under dictatorships but recently has opened up.\n\nThis is a 1 Kyat piece (equal to 1 Indian Rupee). It is dated 1214 CE (Chula-Sakarat). It is not technically a crown in that it only weighs 11 grams of 0.917 fineness but it is the largest denomination of an early Burmese silver coin.\n\nCANADA\n\nJacques Cartier, a French explorer, took possession of Canada for France in 1534, and for more than a century the history of Canada was that of a French colony. Samuel de Champlain helped to establish the first permanent colony in North America, in 1604 at Port Royal, Acadia  now Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia. Four years later he founded the settlement in Quebec. The British settled along the coast to the south while the French, motivated by a grand design, pushed into the interior. Frances plan for a great American empire was to occupy the Mississippi heartland of the country, and from there to press in upon the narrow strip of English coastal settlements from the west. Inevitably, armed conflict erupted between the French and the British; consequently, Britain acquired Hudson Bay, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia from the French in 1713. British control of the rest of New France was secured in 1763, largely because of James Wolfes great victory over Montcalm near Quebec in 1759. During the American Revolution, Canada became a refuge for great numbers of American Royalists, most of whom settled in Ontario, thereby creating an English majority west of the Ottawa River. The ethnic imbalance contravened the effectiveness of the prevailing French type of government, and in 1791 the Constitutional act was passed by the British parliament, dividing Canada at the Ottawa River into two parts, each with its own government: Upper Canada, chiefly English and consisting of the southern section of what is now Ontario; and Lower Canada, chiefly French and consisting principally of the southern section of Quebec. Subsequent revolt by\n\ndissidents in both sections caused the British government to pass the Union Act, July 23, 1840, which united Lower and Upper Canada (as Canada East and Canada West) to form the Province of Canada, with one council and one assembly in which the two sections had equal numbers. The union of the two provinces did not encourage political stability; the equal strength of the French and British made the task of government all but impossible. A further change was made with the passage of the British North American Act, which took effect on 1 July 1867, and established Canada as the first federal union in the British Empire. Four provinces entered the union at first: Upper Canada as Ontario, Lower Canada as Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The Hudson Bay Companys territories were acquired in 1869 out of which were formed the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. British Columbia joined in 1871 and Prince Edward Island in 1873. Canada took over the Arctic Archipelago in 1895. In 1949\n\nNewfoundland came into the confederation. In the early years, Canadas coins were struck in England at the Royal Mint in London or at the Heaton Mint in Birmingham. Issues struck at the Royal Mint do not bear a mint mark, but those produced by Heaton carry an H. All Canadian coins have been struck since 2 January 1908, atthe Royal Canadian Mints at Ottawa and recently at Winnipeg except for some 1968 pure nickel dimes struck at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, and do not bear mint marks. Ottawas mint mark (C) does not appear on some 20th Century Newfoundland issues, however, as it does on English type\n\nsovereigns struck there from 1908 through 1918. Canada is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. Elizabeth II is Head of State as Queen of Canada.\n\nThis is a one Dollar coin minted in 1935. It celebrates the 25th anniversary of the reign.

The confederation, which included all Central America between Mexico and Panama, had a population of fewer than 1.5 million.\n\nOn 15 Sept. 1821, the leaders of the Captaincy General that governed the five provinces of Central America for Spain, declared Central America independent. The following year, Iturbide crowned himself Augustin I of Mexico and invited the Central Americans to join his empire. Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica did so. El Salvador, which desired to become a part of the United States, refused and was invaded and conquered for Mexico by Vicente Filisola, the military governor Iturbide had sent to Guatemala. But almost before El Salvador had been forced into the Mexican empire, Iturbide was ousted. Filisola then reconvened the National Constituent Assembly that had been established by the Central American declaration of independence of 1821. On 1 July 1823, the Assembly issued a second declaration of independence, from Mexico as well as Spain, and established the Central American Republic. Historically the confederation, which lasted 15 years, was an anomaly for a government: It had neither permanent capital, army nor treasury and was all but powerless to raise funds. Its written constitution, was as unsatisfactory as the first constitution of the United States, the Articles of Confederation.\n\nDivided by geography as well as religious and class animosity the citizens of the Republic had no sense of nationhood. By 1827 the entire Republic was embroiled in civil war. By 1839 every state but El Salvador had seceded from the union. Interestingly, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Honduras continued to strike coins in the confederation style - until 1850, 1851 and 1861, respectively. Costa Rica then countermarked many coins of this series for continued circulation within its boundaries.\n\nThis is an 8 reales piece minted in Guatemala in 1836. The obverse has the logo of the republic with the legend REPUBLICA DEL CENTRO DE AMERICA 1836. The reverse has a tree flanked by the denomination 8 . R. surrounded by the legend LIBRA CRESCA BEGUNDO - NG - M -10Ds20 Gs. The NG denotes the Guatemala City Mint and the M the mintmaster's name (Manuel Eusabio Sanchez). The coin weighs 27 grams of 0.903 fineness.\n\nCEYLON\n\nThe earliest known inhabitants of Ceylon. the Veddahs, were subjugated by the Sinhalese from northern India in the 6th century BC. Sinhalese rule was maintained until 1408, alter which the island was controlled by China for 30 years. The Portuguese came to Ceylon in 1505 and maintained control of the coastal area for 150 years. The Dutch supplanted them In 1658, which were in turn supplanted by the British who seized the Dutch colonies in 1796, and made them a Crown Colony in 1802. In 1815, the British conquered the independent Kingdom of Kandy in the central part of the island. Constitutional changes in 1931 and 1946 granted the Ceylonese a measure of autonomy and a parliamentary form of government. Britain granted Ceylon independence as a self-governing state within the British Commonwealth on 4 Feb. 1948. On 22 May 1972, the Ceylonese adopted a new Constitution, which declared Ceylon to be the Republic of Sri Lanka 'Resplendent Island'\n\nThis is a 5 Rupee coin minted in 1957. It celebrates the 3500th anniversary of Buddhism. The coin weighs 28 grams of 0.925 finesness.\n\nCHILE\n\nThe Republic of Chile is a ribbon-like country on the Pacific coast of southern South America. Diego de Almargo was the first Spaniard to attempt to wrest Chile from the Incas and Araucanian tribes in 1536. He failed, and was followed by Pedro de Valdivia, a favorite of Pizarro, who founded Santiago in 1541. When the Napoleonic Wars involved Spain, leaving the constituent parts of the Spanish Empire to their own devices, Chilean patriots formed a national government and proclaimed the country's independence on 18 Sept. 1810. Independence however, was not secured until 12 Feb. 1818, after a bitter struggle led by Bernardo O'Higgins and San Martin. Despite a long steady history of monetary devaluation, reflected in declining weight and fineness in its currency, Chile developed a strong democracy. This was displaced when rampant inflation characterized chaotic and subsequently repressive governments in the mid to late 20th century.\n\nThis is an emergency 1 Peso coin struck in Copiapo during the 1859 revolution, The coin is simple, an inverted Chilean coat-of-arms with the denomination I.P below.

Although his reign marks the golden age of French culture, the domestic abuses and extravagance of Louis XIV plunged France into a series of costly wars. This, along with a system of special privileges granted the nobility and other favored groups, weakened the monarchy and brought France to bankruptcy. This laid the way for the French Revolution of 1789 that shook Europe and affected the whole world.\n\nThe monarchy was abolished and the First Republic formed in 1793.The new government fell in 1799 to a coup led by Napoleon Bonaparte who, after declaring himself First Consul for life, in 1804 had himself proclaimed Emperor of France and King of Italy. Napoleon's military victories made him master of much of Europe, but his disastrous Russian campaign of 1812 initiated a series of defeats that led to his abdication in 1814 and exile to the island of Elba. The monarchy was briefly restored under Louis XVIII. Napoleon returned to France in March 1815, but his efforts to uphold his power were totally crushed at the battle of Waterloo. He was exiled to the island of St. Helena where he died in 1821. The monarchy under Louis XVIII was again restored in 1815, but the ultra reactionary regime of Charles X (1824-30) was overthrown by a liberal revolution and Louis Philippe of Orleans replaced him as monarch. The monarchy was ousted by the Revolution of 1848 and the Second Republic proclaimed. Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (nephew of Napoleon I) was elected president of the Second Republic. He was proclaimed emperor in 1852. As Napoleon III, he gave France two decades of prosperity under a stable, autocratic regime, but led it to defeat in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, after which the Third Republic was established. The Third Republic endured until 1940 and the capitulation of France to the swiftly maneuvering German forces. Marshal Philippe Petain formed a puppet government that sued for peace and ruled unoccupied France until 1942 from Vichy. Meanwhile, General Charles de Gaulle escaped to London where he formed a wartime government in exile and the Free French army. De Gaulle's provisional exile government was officially recognized by the Allies after the liberation of Pans in 1944, and De Gaulle, who had been serving as head of the provisional government, tacitly maintained that position. In October 1945, the people overwhelmingly rejected a return to the prewar government, thus paving the way for the formation of the Fourth Republic in 1947 just after the dismissal of De Gaulle, at grips with a coalition of rival parties, the Communists especially. In actual operation, the Fourth Republic was remarkably like the Third, with the National Assembly the focus of power causing a constant governmental instability. The later years of the Fourth Republic were marked by a burst of industrial expansion unmatched in modern French history. The growth rate, however, was marred by a two colonial wars, nagging inflationary trend that weakened the franc and undermined the betterment of the peoples buying power. This and the Algerian conflict led to the recall of De Gaulle to power, the adoption of a new constitution vesting strong powers in the executive, and the establishment in 1959 of the current Fifth Republic.\n\nThis is a one Ecu coin minted in 1704 at Paris (mintmark A).

Frankfurt was a commercial center from the early Middle Ages and became a favored location for imperial councils during the Carolingian period because of its central location. An imperial mint operated from early times and had a large production during the 12th to 14th centuries. Local issues were produced from at least the mid-14th century, but it was not until 1428 that the city was officially granted the right to coin its own money. In establishing the seven permanent electors of the Empire in 1356, the Golden Bull also made Frankfurt the site of those elections and increased the prestige of the city even further. Frankfurt remained a free city until 1806 and then was the capital of the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt from 1810 until 1814, only to regain its free status in 1815. The city chose the wrong side in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and thus was absorbed by victorious Prussia in the latter year.\n\nThis is an one Thaler coin minted in 1860 i Frankfurt-am-Main.

The Chinese followed southward in the second century BC, conquering the peninsula and ruling it until 938, leaving a lingering heritage of Chinese learning and culture. Indo-Chinese independence was basically maintained until the arrival of the French in the mid-19th century who established control over all of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Activities directed toward obtaining self-determination accelerated during the Japanese occupation of World War II. The dependencies were changed from colonies to territories within the French Union in 1946, and all the inhabitants were made French citizens.

Norman rule, following the conquest of 1066, stimulated the development of those institutions, which have since distinguished British life. Henry VIII (1509-47) turned Britain from continental adventuring and faced it to the sea - a decision that made Britain a world power from the reign of Elizabeth I (1558-1603).
