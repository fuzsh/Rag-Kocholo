        "text": "No. 114.\n\nMr. Davis to Mr. Evarts.\n\nNo. 655.]\n\nSir: My immediate predecessor, in his No. 221, dated May 6, 1871, transmitted to the Department a copy of the constitution which had been framed for Germany. This document was translated, and was printed in the “Foreign Relations” for 1871. Since that time several amendments have been made to it, which fact seems to make it advisable that a revised translation should be transmitted to the Department. This I now do.\n\nThe subjects on which the Imperial Parliament is authorized to legislate [Page 184] are enumerated in article 4, in sixteen divisions. I propose in this dispatch to briefly refer to the more important of the laws which have been already enacted to carry the constitutional provisions into effect, taking the subjects in their order in the instrument.\n\n1. Under the powers conferred by the first clause many important laws have been enacted. Indeed, most of the laws regulating the relations of individuals toward each other, and toward the state (so far as they do not relate to criminal offenses or to judicial proceedings), and the laws for the regulation of trade and commerce and the employment of labor, may be said to be connected with the grants of power under this clause, although most of them flow more directly from the grants under the thirteenth clause. For convenience, and in order to show the general harmony of this class of legislation, as well as its breadth, I group together here some of the measures which should more properly be stated at a later stage among the remarks concerning clause 13.\n\nA uniform age for majority has been prescribed throughout the empire. The contract of marriage must everywhere be made before a civil magistrate. Freedom of worship is guaranteed to all. The law of bills of exchange, of contracts, of bailments, of partnerships, general and special, of joint-stock companies, of bankruptcy, and of interest, has been unified and codified. A commercial code has been enacted, in which the title of merchant has been defined, and rules have been prescribed, in order to determine whom the law will and whom it will not regard as such. It also prescribes what commercial books are to be kept by a merchant, and defines the duties and powers of his various subordinates. The employment of labor is regulated by comprehensive laws. They require certain occupations to be licensed, regulate peddling, and public markets, and trade guilds; tell who is regarded as an assistant, who as an apprentice, who as a master workman, and who as a master, and what are the rights and duties of each; make provisions respecting factory laborers, provide for the examination of seamen on merchant ships, of physicians, of dentists, of veterinary surgeons, of apothecaries, and in fact seem to penetrate into most of the relations of society; even the newspapers do not enjoy immunity, but are subject to a severe press law.\n\nWhile I have been writing this dispatch the Reichstag has discussed and disposed of a variety of proposals for amending the “Gewerbe Ordnung,” the mere enumeration of which will show how wide is the admitted jurisdiction of the imperial parliament over this class of questions.\n\nI.\n\nThe conservatives propose to require each operative to have a book in which is to be inscribed the names and places of his employers from time to time, and the period of each employment, and to amend the laws relating to apprentices.\n\nII.\n\nThe Centrum (ultramontanes) propose to amend by inscribing provisions for the protection of the religious life of laborers, for preserving quiet on Sundays, for the regulation of apprenticeships, for imposing restrictions on the freedom of carrying on trade, for the prevention of the employment of children, for limiting the length of a day’s work by women, for the establishment of trade-courts of arbitration, for the further regulation of trades requiring licenses, and for the regulation of kins and bar-rooms\n\nIII.\n\nThe National Liberals propose to amend the apprentice laws, with a view to provide for continuing the relation between master and apprentice, and also to establish trade-courts of arbitration.\n\nIV.\n\nThe Fortschritt or Party of Progress propose to amend the apprentice [Page 185] laws by providing for the moral training of apprentices, and also to establish trade-courts of arbitration.\n\nV.\n\nThe Social Democrats propose extensive amendments in order to prevent the manufacture in penitentiaries of articles for sale, to establish ten hours the legal day’s work for men, and eight hours for women and youth; to prevent the employment of children; to make night and Sunday work illegal; to amend the apprentice laws, and to provide for the appointment of imperial factory inspectors, and for the formation of trade-courts of arbitration.\n\nThese various proposals have been referred by the Reichstag to a committee of twenty-one members, to report at a future session. It is certain that not all will be adopted; quite possible that none will be. The fact, however, that they are suggested from such opposite quarters shows how deeply the idea of unity and of the endowment of imperial power and functions upon the national legislature has sunk in the popular heart. No rank of life, no condition of man, whether in relation to his fellow-man or to the State, is free from the influence of such legislation.\n\nThe laws which provide for a careful inspection of emigration, and which assume to regulate and control it, are mainly founded upon the powers contained in the same clause. It has already been observed that, as in the case of our own legislation, many laws may fairly claim to be derived from more than one provision of the constitution. Thus the imperial laws relating to domicile and residence may, in one aspect, be regarded as the exercise of the powers derived from the first clause of article 4, and in another aspect as the exercise of the powers derived from the fourteenth clause. So, too, the stringent statute relating to vaccination and other sanitary laws, the despotic power conferred upon the imperial chancery for the suppression of the rinderpest and the destruction of noxious insects, the laws already referred to respecting commerce and trade; respecting physicians, surgeons, veterinary surgeons, dentists, and apothecaries, and other similar statutes, may be traced to more than one grant of authority in the constitution.\n\n2. Customs duties and imposts are collected under imperial laws. Mr. Wheaton, in the first dispatch which he wrote from Berlin, dated June 12, 1835, thus referred, to the Zollverein then in force:\n\nThe Prussian commercial confederacy includes a population of more than twenty millions of industrious, active, and intelligent people, speaking the same language, but inhabiting countries various in their climates, soil, and productions, but nearly all richly endowed with the bounties of Providence. It is impossible not to conclude that the formation of this separate union in the bosom of the German Confederation is designed to augment, and must contribute to augment, the political power and influence of Prussia. Prussian custom-house regulations must ultimately be followed by the introduction of the Prussian monetary system, Prussian post-offices and post-roads, Prussian weights and measures. It is also difficult to believe that a power so jealously alive as Austria to its general interests would suffer her ancient rival thus to aggrandize herself in Germany, and prepare the way for the absorption of its smaller states into the Prussian monarchy on some future favorable occasion, if the Austrian cabinet had not received satisfactory assurances of being allowed to assert its supremacy in Italy.\n\nThe political causes thus assigned for the course of Austria have passed into history as completely as the causes of the crusades; but the laws and institutions which I am attempting to depict are the legitimate results of influences which attracted the statesmanlike eye of Mr. Wheaton forty years ago, and remain vigorous as ever.\n\nAlthough the customs taxes are imposed under federal laws, they are collected by state officers, and the collecting state accounts to the empire for the tax. Practically Prussia is much the largest collector.\n\n[Page 186]\n\nIt will be seen hereafter that this administrative system runs through all German institutions. In all the measures which tend to make Berlin the center of authority for Germany, the legislation is centripetal, or, as a German would say, unifying, and the administration is centrifugal or sectional.\n\n3. A uniform system of weights and measures has been adopted throughout Germany, and an entirely new system of coinage, based upon the old Prussian Vereins thaler and groschen system. Ten pfennigs make a groschen, which, however, as a distinct name for a coin, has disappeared, and the coin is known in the new coinage as ten pfennigs. Ten of these pieces make a mark, of about the value of a quarter of a dollar, and ten marks make a crown. The limited paper circulation which is permitted is issued by the bank of the empire, under imperial law. The executive administration of the mints, like that of the custom, is done by state officials.\n\n4. An imperial bank has been created, which went into effect on the 1st of January, 1876. With it the Bank of Prussia disappeared. Nearly simultaneously with the law for the creation of this institution a general law (Bankgesetz) was passed for the regulation of banking, in execution of the fourth clause in article 4.\n\n5. No patent law has yet been passed.* The subject is in the hands of a commission, which is expected to make an early report.\n\n6. The protection of copy-right—Imperial laws have been enacted, not only for the protection of literary works, but also for protecting property in works of art and imagination, of photographs, of patterns, and of models.\n\n7. General navigation laws have been passed providing for the registration of vessels, and for the mode of proof of their nationality for the use of the flag, and with such other provisions as are usual and necessary in that class of laws. Provision has also been made for a general consular representation of the empire. The several states of the empire still maintain the right of a consular and diplomatic representation as between themselves. Thus, most of the German powers maintain ministers here, and several maintain consuls at the free ports. Some of them also have reserved the right of a diplomatic representation abroad, which right is of little value, since diplomacy without an army is a shadow without substance. The right of consular representation abroad is in the empire; but, by a singular contradiction, the assent of the local government here is held to be essential for the recognition of a consul in Germany.\n\n8. Communication by land and water.—An imperial railway bureau has been organized, and there has been some legislation respecting traveling by rail and the protection of passengers, and the modes of remedy or compensation in case of injury or loss of life. Imperial military railways are also in the process of construction between Berlin and the French frontier. But the great power conferred by the eighth clause to acquire the roads within the empire, and to work them for its benefit, is still in abeyance.\n\n9. The several subjects referred to in clause nine would seem to belong exclusively to imperial legislation, since, in the absence of a common legislature, they would naturally form the subject of international agreement.\n\n10. The rates of postage and of telegrams are uniform throughout the empire, except that Bavaria and Würtemberg can each within its own [Page 187] limits fix the rates of internal postage. With the exception of these two states, the office is managed and the revenue collected by the postmaster-general. This office is an exception to the general rule of local state administration under imperial law.\n\n11 and 12. Laws have been enacted for the enforcement of foreign judgments. Some provisions have also been made by regulation for the extradition of criminals. As between the different states of Germany, the matters referred to in clauses 11 and 12 are mainly regulated by internal arrangements between the respective states. With foreign states they are, in most cases, regulated by treaties.\n\n13. The thirteenth is a sweeping clause—far more sweeping than the similar provisions in the Constitution of the United States. It authorizes the Reichstag to legislate for Germany respecting (1) the whole civil law, (2) criminal law, and (3) judicial proceedings. The first power embraces much that has already been referred to in the first subdivision in this dispatch; the second authorizes the legislature to unify the classification of offenses and their punishment throughout the empire; and the third conveys a like authority with respect to judicial proceedings of every kind.\n\nWith reference to the civil law, I have already referred to the finished codifications of commercial law. Other codes are still in course of preparation. A commission has been charged with the framing of a bill, which, as to real estate, is intended at no distant day to assimilate throughout Germany the laws concerning the tenure and transmission of that species of property. It is also contemplated to enact general provisions respecting the acquisition and distribution of personal property, so that property-holders throughout the empire will come to look upon the federal authority as the guardian of their possessions. Thus, in these important matters, unity of law and of system is already established in a large degree throughout Germany, and active measures are in progress for completing that unity.\n\nThe power to establish a uniform system of criminal legislation for the empire has been exercised. The “Strafgesetz,” like several other laws, was in fact worked up by the legislature of the North German Union, and their work was adopted by the empire. The original law has, however, been much amended. My Nos. 258, 274, and 280 refer to an extensive amendment which was made to the law about a year ago.\n\nWith this brief sketch of the legislation as to other powers conferred by paragraph 13, we come to consider the laws for the administration of justice. The present system of courts includes a system of commercial courts (Handelsgericht), and there exists at Leipzig a supreme court of this class (Oberhandelsgericht) for the empire. These courts are to be absorbed in the new courts when the new system comes in force, which is not to be later than October 1, 1879. The “Reichsjustizgesetze” include four statutes, which provide a uniform system of proceedings throughout the empire. The “Strafprozessordnung” gives a uniform system of proceedings for the punishment of crimes; the “Civilprozessordnung” a uniform system of proceedings in civil matters; and the “Konkursordnung” a uniform system of bankruptcy. The “Gerichtsverfassungsgesetz” strikes at the root of the conflicting systems of jurisprudence, and establishes throughout Germany a new system, based upon the Hanoverian.\n\nThe present mode of administering law throughout Germany is, with some exceptions which I shall notice, not very different in the different states. To explain its practical operations, I will endeavor to describe the Prussian system of administering justice which the new law displaces. [Page 188] It is, in most respects, unlike our own, and unlike the English system on which ours was originally framed. It also bears little resemblance to the French reflex of Roman law, which has been the model of many modifications in our original system.\n\nWhen I speak of the Prussian system, I mean the one which prevails in most of what is known as Prussia. The modern Prussia is largely a creation by conquest, and there are parts of the kingdom in which the legal systems of the parent monarchy have never taken root. The laws and forms of Prussia proper obtain in the two Prussias, in Brandenburg, in Pomerania, in Posen, in Silesia, in the most of Westphalia, in a part of the Rhine country, and in the two Hohenzollerns. These are the laws and forms to which I refer as Prussian.\n\nThe courts in these provinces of Prussia are distinguished from our own courts, and from the courts of most other countries, in three ways:\n\n1st.\n\nThe bar is not an open bar, accessible to all who acquire the requisite learning and possess the proper moral qualities. On the contrary, it is a small and closely restricted body, much less in number than the court before which it practices. Within the Prussian territory where the system prevails, there are 3,158 judges and 1,106 lawyers.\n\n2d.\n\nThe bench is not fed from the bar. This would seem to follow from the figures which I have given. Each is a distinct career. Young men enter the one or the other at the commencement of their business lives, and are seldom transferred from one to the other. Official transfers are practically made more often from the bench to the bar than the reverse. This is because both positions are under government control, and the bar is much the more profitable of the two. As an offset to this the judge has a good social position, but the lawyer has no recognized social position among the ruling classes.\n\n3d.\n\nThe judges are paid in two ways: first, by a small and quite inadequate salary; and, second, by gratuities, which are given by the minister of justice of the day, in order to enable them to meet extraordinary expenses which they may have been obliged to incur personally, or in their families. The amount of the first is graded to the necessities of the cheapest man. The second is intended to equalize the condition of judges by enabling the man who incurs unusually heavy expenses by reason of a large family, or other meritorious cause, to meet them and to enjoy the same freedom as his colleague who does not incur such expenses. To the first sum the judge has a right in every contingency; for the second, he is dependent upon the good-will of the political minister of the day.\n\nThe course of preparation for the future judge and the future attorney in these Prussian states is identical. To fit himself for either place the candidate must attend a course of lectures as a student of law in the university, and in order to do that, he must first have graduated at a “gymnasium.” The gymnasium is a public school of the highest character maintained under general and obligatory provisions of law, and superior to many and equal to most American colleges. It takes the pupil at an age when he is fitted to enter on the classics, and it provides for him a systematic course of instruction in classics, history, and the natural sciences. If the pupil passes the rigid examination at its close, he may be fairly regarded as a Bachelor of Arts in the fittest sense of the term.\n\nThe student of law attends the university lectures for three years. He then submits himself to an examination, in order to determine whether he is qualified to act as an assistant to the courts, and if he passes the examination he receives an appointment as referendarius. [Page 189] This entitles him to commence practice, but not yet as an attorney. He can only act as an assistant to the courts, or as a clerk in an attorney’s office. He spends four years in this capacity before he is entitled to present himself for the second examination. This passed, he may be called to the bar or the bench. He then inscribes his name on the list of candidates for the career which he may elect, whether as a judge or as an attorney, and he awaits in patience an appointment to the desired place by the minister of justice. He will probably have to wait years for it; but, meanwhile, if he is to be called to the bar he will act as an assistant in the offices of other attorneys, or of the public prosecutors; or, if he is to sit upon the bench, he will serve an apprenticeship as an assistant in the courts. Until he is appointed to a vacancy at the bar he cannot appear in court. When once appointed he takes the title of Eeehtsanwalt, and becomes both barrister and attorney.\n\nIf he is made a judge he is first appointed to the lowest court, called, in cities of 50,000 inhabitants, the Stadtgericht, and elsewhere the Kreisgericht. Here he must serve at least four years, when he will be qualified to be promoted to the court of appeals, of which there are twenty-one in those portions of Prussia. The supreme court of Prussia is the highest judicial post. It consists of a president, five vice-presidents, and sixty-two judges, and has no original jurisdiction. To this post a judge can aspire when he has served four years either as a member of a court of appeals, or as a director in a Stadt or Kreisgerieht.\n\nThe system which thus obtains in the most of Prussia also prevails, with more or less modifications, in Saxony, Bavaria, and Baden. Würtemberg has an antique system of its own, unlike anything else in Germany. In some parts of the Rhine provinces the forms which were assumed at the time of their connection with France are still preserved. We are now in a position to appreciate the features of the system which the new code is to extend over Germany.\n\nAnd first, no provision is made respecting the qualifications and mode of appointment of attorneys. For the present this remains a subject of state legislation. The Reichstag could not agree upon a system. The law-reformers, headed by Professor Gneist, wished to follow the example of England and America in an open bar; but the combined influence of the several ministers of justice of the individual states, who were averse to surrender valuable patronage, and of some lawyers in the house, who did not wish to open their close body to competition (although it would be very unjust to make this imputation against them as a class), was too much for the reformers. The subject, however, is not abandoned. The Reichsjustizant is preparing a bill, which will probably be introduced at the next session of the Reichstag. It is understood to be based upon the principle of freedom of the bar,* with the exception of the Reichsgericht.\n\nThe bench, however, throughout Germany, is to be recast in the iron mold of the imperial Justizgesetz. In each state there are to be hereafter Amtsgerichte, Landesgerichte, and Oberlandesgerichte, whose grade ascends in the order thus stated, and whose functions and powers, defined and regulated by imperial law, are to be uniform in all the states. Each state in which there is more than one Oberlandesgericht, with the exception of Saxony (that is, Prussia, Bavaria, Würtemberg, and Baden), can have a supreme court. Saxony does not have this privilege, because the seat of the imperial Reichsgericht is at Leipsig. I am told that Prussia also intends to do away with its [Page 190] supreme court. An imperial supreme court (Reichsgericht) is established, which is to be superior to all these courts on all questions which are properly referable to it. It is also to act as a general appellate court for the states which have no supreme court; and for the great states which have supreme courts it is an appellate court in causes involving imperial rights or the construction of imperial laws, and for judgments in criminal proceedings. The judges of the state courts are to be appointed by state authority; those of the Reichsgericht by the Emperor, on the nomination of the Bundesrath. In passing the bill it was well considered where the power of this nomination should be placed, and it was thought wisest to reserve a power so essentially federal to the body representing the several state sovereignties.\n\nThe avenue to the bench under the new law resembles that already described. Few departures from it are essential. The attendance in the university preliminary to the first examination is fixed at three years, of which a year and a half may be spent at a non-German university. Before the second examination can be passed three more years must have been spent in actual service in the courts or in an attorney’s office. The original draught of the bill did not contain these provisions, but left each state free to determine for itself the standard of qualification for its own judges. The change was proposed in the Reichstag. It was resisted on the ground that the constitution does not empower the federal legislature to impose such conditions on the individual states, but the opposition was unsuccessful.\n\nWhen a candidate passes his first examination in one state he may complete his course and pass his second examination in another state, if he wishes, and when once qualified he may be appointed as a judge in any state without reference to local law respecting qualifications. This overrides all conflicting provisions of Prussian law to which I have alluded.\n\nAll judges are to be appointed for life, and are to be removed only for cause. They cannot be transferred from one court to another against their will. If their services are dispensed with, without removal, their pay continues. The salary is fixed, with no contingent fees, but they are to receive gratuities, as Prussian judges do. The reformers attempted, but without success, to prevent the giving gratuities. They also tried, with equal want of success, to prevent the bestowal of decorations on judges. The decoration being an ornament much prized by a German, they reasoned that it might be made a means of influence.\n\nThe life-tenure of office and other like provisions were resisted by the advocates of states-rights. The Saxon minister of justice said:\n\nThe application and execution of imperial law, when the imperial constitution does not make an exceptional provision, belong to the several states and their officials. The latter are responsible only to their own governments, even when they execute imperial laws. The relation between the sovereign state and its official is cut to the root if the duration of their connection is to be regulated by imperial legislation. If the state is to be no longer independent in regulating the personal service of its own officers, if the state official in his relation to the state is to be severed from state law, if the wishes, the expectations, and even the complaints of an official who is dissatisfied are to be directed to a power and watched by a surveillance outside the state, the consequences of such a state of things cannot be foreseen. The first step of the imperial legislature in this direction is a great infringement of the rights of the several states, which, in the opinion of the Saxon Government, they ought not to surrender.\n\n* * * * * * *\n\nI am of the opinion that if the relation between the state and its judicial officers is severed, little more than the name and the glory remain.\n\nTo this Professor Gneist (who was one of the commission by whom the bill was prepared) replied:\n\nThe house concurred with Professor Gneist by a large majority.\n\nIt would be presumptuous in me to attempt to point out to a states-man of your experience the far-reaching influence of such legislation. I permit myself only to refer again to the fact that, while the legislation is centralizing, in so far as the courts are created and the functions of its officers are defined by imperial law, those officers are to be appointed and paid by the executives of the individual states.\n\n14. The imperial army and navy.—There are many constitutional provisions on this subject. Every German, of every rank of life, is liable to perform military duty. In time of peace the army is fixed at 1 per centum of the population, as it was in 1867. The expense of the army is defrayed from the federal chest. It is under the command of the Emperor, to whom an oath of allegiance is taken.\n\nThe laws passed in accordance with the provisions of the constitution have further provided that every German, on arriving at the age of eighteen years, is deemed to be under military authority, and cannot emigrate without permission. If he has not volunteered to do military duty before the 1st of January next following the completion of his twentieth year, he must then present himself for active service, which lasts three years. Then he is three years in the reserves and five in the landwehr. His name then stands on the landsturm rolls until he is forty three years of age.\n\nThese provisions are varied by conventions prior to the constitution. The result of the conventions and of the imperial laws was stated in my No. 440, to which I beg to refer in case statements more detailed than the following are desired.\n\nThe entire army of the empire is required to be organized on the Prussian system, and to be maintained up to the Prussian standard. In order to assure this, the highest army officials have the right to test the contingents from the non-Prussian states, and to correct deviations from the Prussian standard.\n\nThe contingents from the two Mecklenburgs, Oldenburg, Hamburg, Lippe, Lübeek, Bremen, Schwarzburg Sonderhausen, Lippe-Schaum-burg, and Waldeck are incorporated in the Prussian contingent, the several sovereigns serving ordinarily as officers in the Prussian army, and reserving to themselves only the right of conferring honorary distinctions. The Thuringian duchies each raises its own contingent, which is registered and numbered in the Prussian army, but remains at home when not actually required for service. When called into imperial service it is officered by the King of Prussia, and is regarded as part of the Prussian army. The grand duchies of Baden and Hesse each maintains an army corps strictly subject to the provisions of the imperial constitution. Practically the King of Prussia, as Emperor, moves Baden officers into Prussia, and vice versa. This cannot be done with Saxony, which enjoys entire freedom in its military organization, subject only to the obligation to pay into the imperial treasury any surplus out of the proportion allowed for its contingent. Every Saxon general is obliged to send a written oath to the Emperor that he will hold his command only in conformity with the Emperor’s orders. The officers of the Würtemberg contingent swear obedience to the Emperor, but their King is not obliged to account to the Emperor for any saving there may be in maintaining his contingent. Bavaria maintains her own army, regulates its rate of expenditure, and retains her own military laws, subject [Page 192] to the obligation to adopt the Prussian system. The military oath of obedience to the Emperor is taken in time of war.\n\nUnder the system and regulation which existed during the war with France, 3.87 per centum of the Prussian group of states-—3.13 of that of Bavaria, 2.762 of that of Saxony and 2.356 of that of Würtemberg were called into active service. Since that time imperial legislation has increased the amount of the available force and the facility for mobilizing it, and has placed it under a central will in Berlin.\n\nIt seems hardly necessary to say that the small but efficient navy is a thing of imperial creation. It did not practically exist until the possession of Kiel gave a naval station to Prussia. Its expense is defrayed from the imperial budget, and it is under the Emperor, as Emperor, and not as King of Prussia. Prussia, indeed, attempted, in 1849, to have a navy, and decreed upon paper, in 1852, that a naval station should be made at Wilhelmshafen, but little was done on either the navy or the post until 1871.\n\n15. Surveillance of the medical and verterinary professions; and,\n\n16. The press, associations, &c.—I have already had occasion to refer to the laws enacted under these grants of power, and it is unnecessary to say more about them.\n\nThis dispatch would be incomplete without a reference to the executive and administrative machinery of the empire. If this machinery is crude, and to some extent undefined in its functions and purposes, and if the incumbents can scarcely yet be said to deserve the name of ministers, these facts can be fully accounted for by the anomalous position of the latter. The King of Prussia is at once King and Emperor. His Prussian ministers still hold their portfolios in Berlin, and some of them are at once Prussian and imperial officers. The Prussian minister is still, as he has ever been, the personal servant of the sovereign, responsible only to him, and having no responsibility to or for the other ministers. It is quite natural that the imperial system should partake of the nature of the parent system upon which it is formed. But though as yet no imperial ministry exists in the common acceptation of that term, there are executive officers charged with important trusts who may, in time, expand into a responsible constitutional ministry. There are the imperial chancery, with its president and its two directors, and the imperial post and telegraph office, and the imperial office of justice, and the sanitary office, and the office for the administration of the invalid funds. In view of the varied legislation above referred to, it will be seen that these offices (or departments, as we should call them) are already charged with plenty of business.\n\nThe federal legislation of Germany during the past ten years, first in the Parliament of North Germany and afterward in the Parliament of the empire, by the diligence with which it has been prosecuted, reminds one of the early legislation of the United States. But here the resemblance ceases; for the subjects with which the German legislators have dealt go far wider in extent and far deeper into the social structure than the subjects which occupied the attention of our early Congresses. I think that even the very imperfect and summary review of their work which I have made justifies me in the conviction that the learned and far-seeing statesmen who are patiently building up the structure of German unity are founding an empire which will be able to resist internal shocks and dissensions, whatever may be its fate when it has to face a military attack from without.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nJ. C. BANCROFT DAVIS.\n\n[Page 193]\n\n[Inclosure.—Translation.]\n\nCONSTITUTION OF THE GERMAN EMPIRE.\n\nWe, William, by the grace of God German Emperor, King of Prussia, &c., do hereby ordain, in the name of the German Empire, with the consent of the Bundesrath (federal council) and the Reichstag (diet), as follows:\n\n§ 1. Instead of the constitution of the Germanic Confederation, adopted by the North German Union and the Grand Duchies of Baden and Hesse (Bundesgesetzblatt for 1870, p. 627 et seq.), and instead of the treaties concluded with the kingdoms of Bavaria and Würtemberg with regard to their adoption of that constitution, said treaties bearing date November 23 and 25, 1870 (Bundesgesetzblatt of the year 1871, p. 9, et seq., and of the year 1870, p. 654, et seq.) the annexed constitution for the German Empire is adopted.\n\n§ 2.

Such territories as cannot, by reason of their situation, be suitably embraced within the said frontier, shall be excluded. It shall be lawful to introduce all articles of commerce of a state of the Union into any other state of the Union without paying any duty thereon, except so far as such articles are subject to taxation therein.\n\nArticle 34.

In Bavaria, Würtemberg, and Baden, the matter of imposing duties on domestic brandy and beer is reserved for the legislature of each country. The states of the Union shall, however, endeavor to bring about uniform legislation regarding the taxation of these articles.\n\nArticle 30. The collection and administration of duties and excises on articles of consumption (article 35) is left to each state of the Union within its own territory, so far as this has been done by each state heretofore.\n\nThe Emperor shall supervise the legality of the proceeding, by officials of the Empire, whom he shall designate as adjuncts to the customs or excise offices, and boards of directors of the several states, after hearing the committee of the Bundesrath on customs and revenues.\n\nNotices given by these officials as to defects in the execution of the laws of the Empire (article 35) shall be submitted to the Bundesrath for action.\n\nArticle 37. In taking action upon the rules and regulations for the execution of the laws of the Empire, (article 35,) the vote of the presiding officer shall decide whenever he shall pronounce for upholding the existing rule or regulation.\n\nArticle 38. The amounts accruing from customs and other revenues designated in article 35 of this constitution, so far as they are subject to legislation by the Reichstag, shall go to the treasury of the Empire. This amount is made up of the total receipts from the customs and other revenues, after deducting therefrom—\n\n1.\n\nTax compensations and reductions in conformity with existing laws or regulations.\n\n2.\n\nReimbursements for taxes duly imposed.\n\n3.\n\nThe costs for collection and administration, viz:\n\na.\n\nIn the department of customs, the costs which are required for the protection and collection of customs on the frontiers and in the frontier districts.\n\nb.\n\nIn the department of the duty on salt, the costs which are used for the pay of the officers charged with collecting and controlling these duties in the salt-mines.\n\nc.\n\nIn the department of duties on beet-sugar and tobacco, the compensation which is to be allowed, according to the resolutions of the Bundesrath, to the several state governments for the costs Of the administration of these duties.\n\nd.\n\nFifteen per cent, oft He total receipts in the departments of the other duties.\n\n[Page 198]\n\nThe territories situated outside of the common customs frontier shall contribute to the expenses of the Empire by paying an aversum (a sum of acquittance).\n\nBavaria, Würtemberg, and Baden shall not share in the revenues from duties on liquors and beer, which go into the treasury of the Empire, nor in the corresponding portion of the aforesaid aversum.\n\nArticle 39. The quarterly statements to be regularly made by the revenue officers of the several states at the end of every quarter, and the final settlements (to be made at the end of the year, and after the closing of the account-books) of the receipts from customs, which have become due in the course of the quarter, or during the fiscal year, and the revenues of the treasury of the Empire, according to article 38, shall be arranged by the boards of directors of the several states, after a previous examination in general summaries, in which every duty is to be shown separately. These summaries shall be transmitted to the committee on accounts of the Bundesrath. The latter provisionally fixes, every three months, taking as a basis these summaries, the amount due to the treasury of the Empire from the treasury of each state, and it shall inform the Bundesrath and the several states of this act; furthermore, it shall submit to the Bundesrath, annually, the final statement of these amounts, with its remarks. The Bundesrath shall act upon the fixing of these amounts.\n\nArticle 40. The terms of the customs-union (Zollverein) treaty of July 8, 1867,* remain in force, so far as they have not been altered by the provisions of this constitution, and as long as they are not altered in the manner designated in articles 7 and 78.\n\nVII.—Railways.\n\nArticle 41. Railways which are considered necessary for the defense of Germany or for purposes of general commerce may be built for the account of the Empire by a law of the Empire, even in opposition to the will of those members of the Union through whose territory the railroads run, without detracting from the rights of the sovereign of that country; or private persons may be charged with their construction and receive rights of expropriation. Every existing railway company is bound to permit new railroad lines to be connected with it at the expense of these latter. All laws granting existing railway companies the right of injunction against the building of parallel or competition lines are hereby abolished throughout the Empire, without detriment to rights already acquired. Such right of injunction can henceforth not be granted in concessions to be given hereafter.\n\nArticle 42. The governments of the several states bind themselves, in the interest of general commerce, to have the German railways managed as a uniform net-work, and for this purpose to have the lines hereafter to be built constructed and equipped according to a uniform system.\n\nArticle 43. Accordingly, as soon as possible, uniform arrangements as to management shall be made, and especially shall uniform regulations be instituted for the police of the railroads. The Empire shall take care that the administrative officers of the railway lines keep the roads always in such a condition as is required for public security, and that they be equipped with the necessary rolling-stock.\n\nArticle 44. Railway companies are bound to establish such passenger-trains of suitable velocity as may be required for ordinary travel, and for the establishment of harmonizing schedules of travel; also, to make provision for such freight-trains as may be necessary for commercial purposes, and to establish offices for the direct forwarding of passenger and freight-trains, to be transferred when necessary from one road to another at the customary remuneration.\n\nArticle 45. The Empire shall have control over the tariff of fares. The same shall endeavor to cause—\n\n1.\n\nUniform regulations to be speedily introduced on all German railway lines.\n\n2.\n\nThe tariff to be reduced and made uniform as far as possible, and particularly to cause a reduction of the tariff for the transport of coal, coke, wood, minerals, stone, salt, crude iron, manure, and similar articles for long distances, as demanded by the interests of agriculture and industry, and to introduce a one-penny tariff as soon as practicable.\n\nArticle 46. In case of distress, especially in case of an extraordinary rise in the price of provisions, it shall be the duty of the railway companies to adopt temporarily a low special tariff, to be fixed by the Emperor, on motion of the competent committee of the Bundesrath, for the forwarding of grain, flour, vegetables, and potatoes. This tariff shall, however, not be less than the lowest rate for raw produce existing on the said line.\n\nThe foregoing provisions, and those of articles 42 to 45, shall not apply to Bavaria.\n\n[Page 199]\n\nThe imperial government has, however, the power also with regard to Bavaria, to establish, by way of legislation, uniform rules for the construction and equipment of such railways as may be of importance for the defense of the country.\n\nArticle 47. The managers of all railways shall be required to obey, without hesitation, requisitions made by the authorities of the Empire for the use of their roads for the defense of Germany. Particularly shall the military and all material of war be forwarded at uniform reduced rates.\n\nVIII.—Mails and Telegrams.\n\nArticle 48. The mails and telegraphs shall be organized and managed as government institutions throughout the German Empire. The legislation of the Empire in regard to postal and telegraphic affairs provided for in article 4, does not extend to those matters whose regulation is left to the managerial arrangement, according to the principles which have controlled the North German administration of mails and telegraphs.\n\nArticle 49. The receipts from mails and telegraphs are a joint affair throughout the Empire. The expenses shall be paid from the general receipts. The surplus goes into the treasury of the Empire (Section XII).\n\nArticle 50. The Emperor has the supreme supervision of the administration of mails and telegraphs. The authorities appointed by him are in duty bound and authorized to see that uniformity be established and maintained in the organization of the administration and in the transaction of business, as also in regard to the qualifications of employés.\n\nThe Emperor shall have the power to make general administrative regulations, and also exclusively to regulate the relations which are to exist between the post and telegraph offices of Germany and those of other countries.\n\nIt shall be the duty of all officers of the post-office and telegraph department to obey imperial orders. This obligation shall be included in their oath of office.\n\nThe appointment of superior officers (such as directors, counselors, and superintendents), as they shall be required for the administration of the mails and telegraphs, in the various districts, also the appointment of officers of the posts and telegraphs (such as inspectors or comptrollers), acting for the aforesaid authorities in the several districts in the capacity of supervisors, shall be made by the Emperor for the whole territory of the German Empire, and these officers shall take the oath of office to him. The governments of the several states shall be informed in due time, by means of imperial confirmation and official publication of the aforementioned appointments so far as they may relate to their territories. Other officers required by the department of mails and telegraphs, as also all officers to be employed at the various stations, and for technical purposes, and hence officiating at the actual centers of communication, &c., shall be appointed by the respective governments of the states.\n\nWhere there is no independent administration of inland mails or telegraphs, the terms of the various treaties are to be enforced.\n\nArticle 51. In assigning the surplus of the post-office department to the treasury of the Empire for general purposes (Article 49), the following proceeding is to be observed in consideration of the difference which has heretofore existed in the clear receipts of the post-office departments of the several territories, for the purpose of securing a suitable equalization during the period of transition below-named.\n\nOf the post-office surplus which accumulated in the several mail-districts during the five years from 1861 to 1865, an average yearly surplus shall be computed, and the share which every separate mail-district has had in the surplus resulting therefrom for the whole territory of the Empire shall be fixed upon by a percentage.\n\nIn accordance with the proportion thus made, the several states shall be credited on the account of their other contributions to the expenses of the Empire with their quota accruing from the postal surplus in the Empire for a period of eight years subsequent to their entrance into the post-office department of the Empire. At the end of the said eight years this distinction shall cease, and any surplus in the post-office department shall go, without division, into the treasury of the Empire, according to the principle enunciated in article 49.\n\nOf the quota of the post-office department surplus resulting during the aforementioned period of eight years in favor of the Hanseatic towns, one-half shall every year be placed at the disposal of the Emperor, for the purpose of providing for the establishment of uniform postal arrangements in the Hanseatic towns.\n\nArticle 52. The stipulations of the foregoing articles 48 to 51 do not apply to Bavaria and Würtemberg. In their stead the following stipulation shall be valid for these two states of the Union:\n\nThe Empire alone is authorized to legislate upon the privileges of the post-office and telegraph departments, on the legal position of both institutions toward the public, [Page 200] upon the franking privilege and rates of postage, and upon the establishment of rates for telegraphic correspondence, exclusive, however, of managerial arrangements, and the fixing of tariffs for internal communication within Bavaria and Würtemberg.\n\nIn the same manner the Empire shall regulate postal and telegraphic communication with foreign countries, excepting the immediate communication of Bavaria and Würtemberg, with their neighboring states, not belonging to the Empire, in regard to which regulation, the stipulation in article 49 of the postal treaty of November 23, 1867,* remains in force.\n\nBavaria and Würtemberg shall not share in the postal and telegraphic receipts which belong to the treasury of the Empire.\n\nIX.—Marine and Navigation.\n\nArticle 53. The navy of the Empire is a united one, under the supreme command of the Emperor. The Emperor is charged with its organization and formation, and he shall appoint the officers and officials of the navy, and in his name these and the seamen are to be sworn in. The harbor of Kiel and the harbor of the Jade are imperial war harbors. The expenditure s required for the establishment and maintenance of the navy and the institutions connected therewith shall be defrayed from the treasury of the Empire.\n\nAll sea-faring men of the Empire, including machinists and hands employed in shipbuilding, are exempt from service in the army, but obliged to serve in the imperial navy.\n\nThe apportionment of men to supply the wants of the navy shall be made according to the actual s a-faring population, and the quota furnished in accordance herewith by each state shall be credited to the army account.\n\nArticle 54. The merchant-vessels of all the states of the Union shall form a united commercial marine.\n\nThe Empire shall determine the process for ascertaining the tonnage of sea-going vessels, shall regulate the issuing of tonnage-certificates and sea-letters, and shall fix the conditions to which a permit for commanding a sea-going vessel shall be subject.\n\nThe merchant-vessels of ail the states of the Union shall be admitted on an equal footing to the harbors and to all natural and artificial water-courses of the several states of the Union, and shall receive the same usage therein.\n\nThe duties which shall be collected from sea-going vessels or levied upon their freights, for the use of naval institutions in the harbors, shall not exceed the amount required for the maintenance and ordinary repair of these institutions.\n\nOn all natural water-courses duties are only to be levied for the use of special establishments which serve for facilitating commercial intercourse. These duties, as well as the duties for navigating such artificial channels which are property of the state, are not to exceed the amount required for the maintenance and ordinary repair of the institutions and establishments. These rules apply to rafting, so far as it is carried on upon navigable water-courses.\n\nThe levying of other or higher duties upon foreign vessels or their freights than those which are paid by the vessels of the several states or their freights does not belong to the various states but to the Empire.\n\nArticle 55. The flag of the war and merchant navy shall be black, white, and red.\n\nX.—Consular affairs.\n\nArticle 56. The Emperor shall have the supervision of all consular affairs of the German Empire, and he shall appoint consuls, after hearing the committee of the Bundesrath on commerce and traffic.\n\nNo new state consulates are to be established within the jurisdiction of the German consuls. German consuls shall perform the functions of state consuls for the states of the Union not represented in their district. All the now existing state consulates shall be abolished, as soon as the organization of the German consulates shall be completed, in such a manner that the representation of the separate interests of all the states of the Union shall be recognized by the Bundesrath as secured by the German consulates.\n\nXI.—Military affairs of the Empire.\n\nArticle 57. Every German is subject to military duty, and in the discharge of this duty no substitute can be accepted.\n\nArticle 58. The costs and the burden of all the military affairs of the Empire are to be borne equally by all the several states and their subjects, and no privileges to, or onerous distinctions between, the several states or classes are admissible. Where an equal distribution of the burdens cannot be effected in natura without prejudice to the public [Page 201] welfare, affairs shall be equalized by legislation in accordance with the principles of justice.\n\nArticle 59. Every German capable of bearing arms shall serve for seven years in the standing army, ordinarily from the end of his twentieth to the beginning of his twenty-eighth year: the first three years in the army of the field, the last four years in the reserve; during the next five years he shall belong to the Landwehr. In those states of the Union in which, heretofore, a longer term of service than twelve years was required by law the gradual reduction of the required time of service shall take place in such a manner as is compatible with the interests and the war footing of the army of the Empire.\n\nAs regards the emigration of men belonging to the reserve, only those provisions shall be in force which apply to the emigration of members of the Landwehr.\n\nArticle 60. The strength of the German army in time of peace shall be, until the 31st December, 1871, one per cent, of the population of 1867, and shall be furnished by the several states of the Union in proportion to their population. In future the strength of the army in time of peace shall be fixed by legislation.\n\nArticle 61. After the publication of this constitution the entire Prussian military legislation shall be introduced without delay throughout the Empire, as well the statutes themselves as the regulations, instructions, and ordinances issued for their execution, explanation, or completion; thus, in particular, the military penal code of April 3, 1845; the military penal code of procedure of April 3, 1845; the ordinance concerning the courts of honor of July 20, 1843; the regulations with respect to recruiting, time of service, matters relating to the service and subsistence, to the quartering of troops, claims for damages, mobilizing, &c., for times of peace and war. Orders for the attendance of the military upon religious services are, however, excluded. When a uniform organization of the German army shall have been established, a comprehensive military law for the Empire shall be submitted to the Reichstag and the Bundesrath for their action in accordance with the constitution.\n\nArticle 62. For the purpose of defraying the expenses of the whole German army, and the institutions connected therewith, the sum of 225 thalers shall be placed at the disposal of the Emperor until the 31st of December, 1871, for each man in the army on the peace footing, according to article 60. (See section XII.)\n\nAfter the 31st of December, 1871, the payment of these contributions of the several states to the imperial treasury must be continued. The strength of the army in time of peace, which has been temporarily fixed in article 60, shall be taken as a basis for calculating these amounts until it shall be altered by a law of the Empire. The expenditure of this sum for the whole army of the Empire and its establishments, shall be determined by a budget law.\n\nIn determining the budget of military expenditures, the lawfully-established organization of the imperial army, in accordance with this constitution, shall be taken as a basis.\n\nArticle 63. The total land-force of the Empire shall form one army, which, in war and in peace, shall be under the command of the Emperor. The regiments, &c, throughout the whole German army shall bear continuous numbers. The principal colors and the cut of the garments of the royal Prussian army shall serve as a pattern for the rest of the army. It is left to commanders of contingent forces to choose the external badges, cockades, &c.\n\nIt shall be the duty and the right of the Emperor to take care that throughout the German army all divisions be kept full and well equipped, and that unity be established and maintained in regard to organization and formation, equipment and command in the training of the men, as well as in the qualification of the officers. For this purpose the Emperor shall be authorized to satisfy himself at any time of the condition of the several contingents, and to provide remedies for existing defects.\n\nThe Emperor shall determine the strength, composition, and division of the contingents of the imperial army, and also the organization of the Landwehr, and he shall have the right to designate garrisons within the territory of the Union, as also to call any portion of the army into active service.\n\nIn order to maintain the necessary unity in the care, arming, and equipment of all troops, of the German army, all orders hereafter to be issued for the Prussian army shall be communicated in due form to the commanders of the remaining contingents, for their observance, by the committee on the army and fortifications, provided for in article 8, No. 1.\n\nArticle 64. All German troops are bound implicitly to obey the orders of the Emperor. This obligation shall be included in the military oath. The commander-in-chief of a contingent, as well as all officers commanding troops of more than one contingent, and all commanders of fortresses, shall be appointed by the Emperor. The officers appointed by the Emperor shall take the military oath to him. The appointment [Page 202] of generals, or of officers performing the duties of generals in a contingent force, shall be in each case subject to the approval of the Emperor. The Emperor has the right with regard to the transfer of officers, with or without promotion, to positions which are to be filled in the service of the Empire, be it in the Prussian army or in other contingents, to select from the officers of all the contingents of the army of the Empire.\n\nArticle 65. The right to build fortresses within the territory of the Empire shall belong to the Emperor, who, according to section XII, shall ask for the appropriation of the necessary means required for that purpose, if not already included in the regular appropriation.\n\nArticle 66. If not otherwise stipulated, the princes of the Empire and the senates shall appoint the officers of their respective contingents, subject to the restriction of article 64. They are the chiefs of all the troops belonging to their respective territories, and are entitled to the honors connected therewith. They shall have especially the right to hold inspections at any time, and receive, besides the regular reports and announcements of changes for publication, timely information of all promotions and appointments concerning their respective contingents. They shall also have the right to employ, for police purposes, not only their own troops but all other contingents of the army of the Empire which are stationed in their respective territories.\n\nArticle 67. The unexpended portion of the military appropriation shall, under no circumstances, fall to the share of a single government, but at all times to the treasury of the Empire.\n\nArticle 68. The Emperor shall have the power, if the public security of the Empire demands it, to declare martial law in any part thereof; until the publication of a law regulating the grounds, the form of announcement, and the effects of such a declaration, the provisions of the Prussian law of June 4, 1851,* shall be substituted therefor. (Laws of 1851, page 451.)\n\nAddition to section XI.\n\nThe provisions contained in this section shall go into effect in Bavaria as provided for in the treaty of alliance of November 23, 1870† (Bundesgesetzblatt, 1871, page 99, under III, section 5); in Würtemberg, as provided for in the military convention of November 21–25, 1870,‡ (Bundesgesetzblatt, 1870, page 658).\n\nXII.—Finances of the Empire.\n\nArticle 69. All receipts and expenditures of the Empire shall be estimated yearly, and included in the budget of the Empire. The latter shall be fixed by law before the beginning of the fiscal year, according to the following principles:\n\nArticle 70. In primo, the surplus of the previous year, as well as the customs duties, the common excise duties, and the revenues derived from the postal and telegraph service, shall be applied to the defrayal of all general expenditures. In so far as these expenditures are not covered by the receipts, they shall be raised, as long as no taxes of the Empire shall have been established, by assessing the several states of the Empire according to their population, the amount of the assessment to be fixed by the chancellor of the Empire in accordance with the budget agreed upon.\n\nArticle 71. The general expenditures shall be, as a rule, granted for one year; they may, however, in special cases be granted for a longer period. During the period of transition fixed in article 60, the financial estimate, properly classified, of the expenditures of the army shall be laid before the Bundesrath and the Reichstag solely for their information.\n\nArticle 72. An annual report of the expenditure of all the receipts of the Empire shall be rendered to the Bundesrath and the Reichstag, for the purpose of discharge, through the chancellor of the Empire.\n\nArticle 73. In cases of extraordinary requirements, the Empire may contract a loan or assume a guarantee by means of legislative enactment.\n\nAddition to section XII.\n\nArticles 69 and 71 apply to the expenditures for the Bavarian army only, according to the provisions of the addition to section XI of the treaty of November 23,1870; and article 72 only so far as is required to inform the Bundesrath and the Reichstag of the assignment to Bavaria of the required sum for the Bavarian army.\n\n[Page 203]\n\nXIII.—Settlement of disputes and modes of punishment.\n\nArticle 74. Every attempt against the existence, the integrity, the security, or the constitution of the German Empire; finally, any offense committed against the Bundesrath, the Reichstag, a member of the Bundesrath or of the Reichstag, a magistrate or public official of the Empire, while in the execution of his duty or with reference to his official position, by word, writing, printing, signs, or caricatures, shall be judicially investigated, and, upon conviction, punished in the several states of the Empire according to the laws therein existing, or which shall hereafter exist in the same, according to which laws a similar offense against any one of the states of the Empire, its constitution, legislature, members of its legislature, authorities or officials is to be judged.\n\nArticle 75. For those offenses, specified in article 74, against the German Empire, which, if committed against one of the states thereof, would be deemed high treason, the superior court of appeals of the three free Hanseatic towns at Lübeck shall be the competent deciding tribunal in the first and last resort. More definite provisions as to the competency and the proceedings of the superior court of appeals shall be adopted by the legislature of the Empire. Until the passage of an imperial law the existing competency of the courts in the respective states of the Empire, and the provisions relative to the proceedings of those courts, shall remain in force.\n\nArticle 76. Disputes between the different states of the Union, so far as they are not of a private nature, and, therefore, to be decided by the competent courts, shall be settled by the Bundesrath at the request of one of the parties. Disputes relating to constitutional matters in those of the states of the Union whose constitution contains no provision for the settlement of such differences shall be adjusted by the Bundesrath at the request of one of the parties, or, if this cannot be done, they shall be settled by the legislative power of the Empire.\n\nArticle 77. If in one of the states of the Union justice shall be denied, and no sufficient relief can be procured by legal measures, it shall be the duty of the Bundesrath to receive substantiated complaints concerning denial or restriction of justice, which are to be judged according to the constitution and the existing laws of the respective states of the Union, and thereupon to obtain judicial relief from the government of the Union in the matter which shall have given rise to the complaint.\n\nXIV.—General provisions.\n\nAmendments to the constitution shall be made by legislative enactment. They shall be considered as rejected when fourteen votes are cast against them in the Bundesrath. The provisions of the constitution of the Empire by which fixed rights of individual states of the Union are established in their relation to the whole, shall only be altered with the consent of that state which is immediately concerned.\n\nAppendix No. 1.\n\nArticle 80 of the constitution of the German Union, as adopted by the North German Union and the Grand Duchies of Baden and of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nXV.—Transitional provision.\n\nArticle 80.

II, § 26, of this treaty, is applicable to Bavaria Only as regards the electoral law of May 31, 1869, for the Reichstag of the North German Union. This is on account of the time that has elapsed, and the necessity of many changes of other laws and regulations connected with the subject of the legislation of the Union.\n\nAs to the rest, the declaration that the laws enacted in the North German Union have become laws of the Union for the Kingdom of Bavaria, so far as these laws refer to matters which, according to the constitution, are subject to the legislation of the German Union, is reserved for the legislature of that Union.\n\nAppendix No. 3.\n\nArt. 2, par. 6 of the treaty with Würtemberg of Nov. 25, 1870.\n\n(6) To article 80 of the constitution.\n\nThe introduction of the following-named laws of the North German Union shall take place for Würtemberg, instead of those fixed in article 80, from the following dates:\n\nI.\n\nFrom July 1, 1871: (1) The law of November 14, 1867, concerning interest fixed by agreement. (2) The law of June 12, 1869, concerning the creation of a supreme court of commerce and trade.\n\nII.\n\nFrom January 1, 1872: (1) The law of June 21, 1869, concerning the attachment of wages due for labor or service. (2) The law of June 16, 1870, concerning the issue of paper money.\n\nThe introduction of the law of April 7, 1869, concerning measures to be adopted against the cattle-plague as a law of the Union, is reserved for the legislation of the Union as regards Würtemberg. The same is in force with the limitation implied by the above provision Under No. 4, which limitation has reference to the postal and telegraph laws mentioned in article 80, under II, No. 4.\n\nThe law of July 1, 1868, concerning the closing and limitation of the public gambling establishments, shall be introduced as a law of the Union in Würtemberg on the day. when the constitution of the Union goes into force.\n\nAppendix No. 4.\n\nProtocol concerning the agreement between the North German Union, Baden, and Hesse, in respect to the establishment of a German Union, and the adoption of the constitution of the Union. Done at Versailles, November 15, 1870.\n\nAfter His Majesty the King of Prussia, in the name of the North German Union, His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Baden, and His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine had agreed to enter into negotiations concerning the establishment of a German Union, and had fully empowered for this purpose the following:\n\nHis Majesty the King of Prussia, in the name of the North German Union: the chancellor of the North German Union, president of the cabinet and minister of foreign affairs, Count Otto von Bismarck-Schönhausen; the royal Saxon minister of state for the finances and of foreign affairs, Richard, Baron von Friesen; and the president of the chancery of the Union, the minister of state, Martin Frederick Rudolph Delbruck; His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Baden: the president of the cabinet and [Page 206] minister of state for the interior, Dr. Julius Jolly; and the president of the ministry of the grand ducal house and of foreign affairs, Rudolf von Freydorf;\n\nHis Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Hesse and by Rhine: the president of the cabinet aud minister of the grand ducal house as well as of foreign affairs and of the interior, actual privy counselor, Baron Reinhard von Dalwigk zu Lichtenfels; and the envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary, privy counsellor of legation, Karl Hoffman, —\n\nThese plenipotentiaries met in Versailles; and after their respective powers had been read and recognized, agreed on the subjoined constitution of the German Union. They further agree that this constitution, together with restrictions hereinafter to be mentioned, shall go into force on the 1st January, 1871, and give mutual assurance that they shall immediately be laid before the legislative bodies of the North German Union, of Baden, and of Hesse, for their acceptance, and afterward shall be ratified during the course of the month of December. The exchange of ratifications shall take place in Berlin.\n\nIn consideration of the great difficulties interposed by the advanced period of the year and the duration of the war, together with the fact that in several states the expenditure for the military of the German Union for the year 1871 has already been fixed, it is agreed that the community of expenditure for the army shall begin with the 1st January, 1872. Up to that time, therefore, the amount of the common taxes mentioned in article 35 shall not be paid over to the treasury of the Union, but to the treasuries of Baden and Hesse, to the latter with respect to the share due to South Hesse; and the shares of these states due to the treasury of the Union shall be collected by “matriculation-dues,” (Matrikularbeiträge) the fixing of which shall be the duty of the Imperial Reichstag which is to meet next year.\n\nThe regulations of articles 49–52 of the constitution of the Union shall go into effect for Baden on the 1st January, 1872, so that time may be granted for the regulation and transfer by the state commission of the posts and telegraphs to the Union commission.\n\nFor the rest also the following declarations, made in the course of the discussion, were set down in the present protocol:\n\nIt was agreed—\n\n1.\n\nWith reference to article 18 of the constitution, that in the rights belonging to an official in the sense of the second section of this article, those rights are not included which belong to his surviving family as regards pensions or assistance.\n\n2.\n\nWith reference to articles 35 and 38 of the constitution, that the transitory duties to be raised in the future, in accordance with the Zolverein treaties, on brandy and beer, are to be viewed in the same light as those imposed on the manufacture of these beverages.\n\n3.\n\nWith reference to article 38 of the constitution, that while the present taxation of beer continues in Hesse, only that portion of the Hesse beer-tax which corresponds to the amount of the North German brewing malt-tax shall flow into the treasury of the Union.\n\n4.\n\nWith reference to Section VIII of the constitution, that the treaties by which the relations of postal and telegraphic affairs in Hesse toward the North German Union are governed are not changed by the constitution of the Union. In particular matters remain unchanged as regards payments for damage to public roads, as well as for damage to bridges and thoroughfares and other means of communication; further, with regard to compensation for the use of state and private railroads, and with regard to the right of free transmission of matter in South Hesse, as at present established, until the end of the year 1875. From January 1, 1876, the payments of tolls on turnpike-roads cease. What the status is to be as regards compensation for conveying the mails on railroads, as well as with regard to the South Hesse privileges of free transmission subsequent to January, 1, 1876, is to be the subject of later agreement. The indemnification for tolls on roads, bridges, and other ways of communication will also be paid to the grand ducal Hesse government after January 1, 1876; the latter undertakes, however, in future, to compensate those to whom compensation is due in the same manner as heretofore.\n\n5.\n\nWith reference to article 52 of the constitution, the Baden representative remarked that the financial result of the management of the posts and telegraphs of the Union, as it had heretofore turned out and as estimated by the Union budget for 1871, gave no v assurance, notwithstanding the provision of article 52, that the portion of the revenues accruing to Baden from these sources would even approximately reach the revenue which it at present derives from its own management, amounting to the average sum of 130,000 reichsthalers. They therefore considered it proper that Baden should be protected by a particular agreement from a deficit that would so sensibly affect its revenues.\n\nAlthough on the part of others this anxiety of the Baden Government could not be pronounced as well founded, it was yet agreed that if in the course of the transition period the portion ascertained to be the portion of Baden according to a per cent [Page 207] calculation of the post surpluses accruing in the Union in one year should not reach the sum of 100,000 reichs thalers, the sum wanting to this amount should he credited to Baden against its matricular dues. Such an accounting shall, however, not be held in a year during which warlike events take place in which the Union takes part.\n\n6.\n\nWith reference to article 56 of the constitution, the representatives of the North German Union, upon being questioned by the Baden representative, remarked that the President of the Union had already, after hearing the proper committee of the Bundesrath, established Union consulates, even when such establishment at a particular place was in the interest of only one of the states of the Union. In this connection, they also stated that the same course would be pursued in future.\n\n7.\n\nWith reference to article 62 of the constitution, it was agreed that the payment under this article by Baden of its contributions should begin with the first day of that month which followed the return of the Baden troops from a war to a peace footing.\n\n8.\n\nWith reference to article 78 of the constitution, it was pronounced on all sides to be a matter of course that those provisions of the constitution by which certain rights of particular states of the Union in their relations to the whole are established could only be altered with the consent of the state concerned.\n\n9.\n\nWith reference to article 80 of the constitution, the representatives were a unit in the matter of the law concerning the establishment of a supreme tribunal for commercial affairs, of July 12 of the previous year, as regards the point that a proper augmentation should be made to the number of the members of this tribunal by a supplement to the estimate for the same for 1871.\n\nIt was further generally understood that, among the laws made in the North German Union, concerning which it is reserved to the German Union to declare them to be laws of the German Union, the law of July 21 of the current year, concerning the extraordinary demand for money on the part of the military and marine management, was not one; and also that the law of May 31, of the current year, concerning the St. Gotthard Railway, would not be declared a law of the German Union, without a change being made in its provisions.\n\nThis protocol has been read, approved, and executed by the representatives named herein in a single copy, which is to be deposited in the archives of the chancery of the Union at Berlin.\n\nv.
