        "text": "The gold dinar was first struck in Spain under Emir of Córdoba in the 10th century. During the 11th century, the dinar became known as the morabit throughout Europe. In the 12th century, it was copied by the Christian rulers as the maravedí. It weighed about 3.8 grams. In Castile, the maravedí de oro soon became the accounting unit for gold, alongside the sueldo for silver and the dinero. The gold content of the maravedí kept falling, eventually becoming a silver coin under Alfonso X . By this time the word maravedí was being used for a specific coin officially, for any coin colloquially, and as a synonym for money itself, resulting in a certain confusion in interpreting 13th century references to money, values, and coinage. The gold maravedí had disappeared as a money of account by 1300.\n\nThe dobla (plural: doblas), including dobla castellana (excelente), gran dobla, dobla de la Banda, dobla cruzada, dobla alfonsi and dobla almohade, was the name of various Iberian gold coins between the 11th and 16th centuries, ranging in value from 2 to 870 maravedis, depending on the year. The name originated as the “double maravedi”, a term used by Castilians for the Muslim dinar, when the maravedí was re-valued as equivalent to the Muslim half dinar by Ferdinand III. Later,the dobla became various new coins, and at times, a dobla was the same as the newer coins enrique or castellano [but the dobla castellana became double their value in 1475]. In general, a dobla was a valuable gold coin, while the maravedi was de-valued into silver [c. 1258] or rarely copper forms. In the 16th century, the dobla was replaced by the ducado, then by the escudo [in 1537[ as the standard gold coin of Spain.\n\nAfter the discovery of America, copper maravedís, along with silver reales, were the first coins struck in Spain for the purpose of circulation in the New World colonies. These coins, minted with a special design for specific use of the Americas, were first coined in Seville in 1505 for shipment to the colonial island of Hispaniola, thus giving these coins their distinction as the first coins for the New World. By 1531 these coins were still being minted, in both Seville and Burgos. These maravedís were used as Spanish Colonial change for smaller transactions and after mints were later established in the New World, in both Mexico and Santo Domingo coins of this type were also minted there.\n\nSpanish Colonial Coinage.\n\nSpanish colonial coins circulated freely during the colonial period of the New World, both North America and South America. The same coins were minted in the Spanish colonies of Bolivia, Chile, Columbia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru, from the early 1600s to the early 1800s. They circulated as far north as Canada and as far east as Florida.\n\nMethods of manufacture – There are two major types of Spanish colonials. At the highest level there are cob coins and there are milled coins. Both come in gold and silver. The rich deposits of precious metal in the New World were hacked into chunks of specific weight and struck with heavy hammers between crude, hard-metal dies. The strike imparted a Spanish pattern, or part of a Spanish pattern, into the coin. The Spanish word cabo refers to the end of the bar. The size, shape and impression of these cobs was highly irregular. Eventually the crude manufacture of cob coins was replaced by more modern minting technology. Milled coins were made by rolling the silver and gold into sheets of uniform thickness and punching out coin blanks, or planchets, for striking in large screw presses.\n\nMint Marks – Mint marks are important because they indicate the country of origin. A few of the major mint marks for New World Spanish colonials include:\n\nAssayer Initials – In addition to mint marks, the collector should discern assayer initials. Assayers were people at the mints whose job it was to ensure proper weight and purity of the precious metal in the coin. Usually their initials appear as two or more letters prominently displayed on the coin, but sometimes a single letter appears. See the graphic at left for examples.\n\nSummary – To completely identify a Spanish colonial coin, you need:\n\nThe date, either explicitly on the coin or by Spanish ruler\n\nThe method of manufacture, cob or milled\n\nThe numeric denomination, e.g., 1 real, 2 escudos, 8 reales\n\nThe country of origin, as coded by the mint mark\n\nThe assayer initials\n\nSilver with king’s bust – Milled coins with a King’s likeness are generally newer than other types, spanning from Carol III to Ferdinand VII (1759 to 1833). 4 reales are generally more rare and command two or three times the value of 8 reales.\n\nCrowned arms between pillars – This pattern is always paired with silver busts. The example in the picture is a 4 reales (4R) from Chile (Santiago mint) with assayer initials F and J. These are sometimes called pillar dollars, but there are other Spanish colonials with pillars, so the name is misleading. The coat of arms with lions and castles is a classic symbol of Spain.\n\nGold with king’s bust – Bust gold coins date as far back as Philip V and span through Ferdinand VII (1700 to 1833). These are valuable coins. For instance, a 1764 8 escudos from Mexico with assayers MF catalogs at $11500 in well preserved condition.\n\nGold flared arms with Order chain – This is the most recent reverse for gold Spanish colonials, starting around 1770. The coat of arms is flared a the top and encircled by a chain. The chain, with a sheepskin at the bottom, is from the Order of the Golden Fleece, an order of chivalry founded in 1430. The example in the picture is an 8 escudos (8S) from Bolivia (Potosi mint) with assayer initials P and J.\n\nGold royal arms with Order chain – The earliest bust milled gold coins had a royal Spanish arms on the reverse, starting in 1732 and continuing through about 1760. The same royal arms appears on silver coins. The gold coin in the picture is from Mexico (with the oM mint mark) but the denomination is not shown explicitly. It must be determined from the size and weight of the coin.\n\nGold royal arms no chain – Some of the smaller denomination gold bust coins omit the chain around the royal arms. There is also a silver version of this no-chain pattern.\n\nHemispheres between pillars – These are the pillar dollars most often referred to. The VTRAQUE VNUM inscription appears over a Spanish crown that links Old and New Worlds together. The pillars bear a PLUS ULTRA inscription and are usually called the pillars of Hercules because they form a portal to both worlds, approached through the wavy sea beneath. The sample in the picture comes from Peru (Lima mint mark). Dates span from the 1730s to the 1770s.\n\nSilver royal arms – This pattern is paired with the Hemisphere between pillars pattern, and approximate values are explained there. These are almost always milled coins, but Guatemala used this pattern on a few cobs between 1733 and 1753. The coin in the picture is an 8 reales of Fernando VI with assayer initials MF. The other side has the mint mark (Mexico City).\n\nSilver Jerusalem cross – Silver cobs from Mexico City have a Jerusalem cross on one side. The cross can be plain or with foils around it. Castles and lions appear in the angles of the cross. Cobs date back before 1600 to the early 1700s.\n\nGold Jerusalem cross – Almost all gold cobs have a Jerusalem cross on one side. The cross has prominent foils around it or a circle of dots. Sometimes castles and lions appear in the angles of the cross, but not always. The pictured coin has a quatrefoil and fluers de lis in the angles. These are very valuable coins. Gold cobs were produced in Colombia, Mexico, and Peru.\n\nGold crowned shield – A crowned shield with the Spanish coat of arms is often paired with the Jerusalem cross on gold cobs. Most of the time, only part of the design is actually visible. The example pictured is extraordinary. Quite visible is the crown, the oM [Mexico City] mint mark, the assayer initial I or J, and a clear date of 1714. The denomination does not show on the coin, but from its size and weight it is easily identified as an 8 escudos. The initial is Jose E deLeon, who served as assayer between 1708 and 1723. Escudos with shields were produced only in Colombia and Mexico.\n\nGold pillars and waves – Instead of a crowned shield, some gold cobs use this pillars and waves design. The L – 8 – M on the top row gives the mint mark (Lima), the denomination (8 escudos), and the assayer initial. The middle row, P – V – A, is an abbreviation for PLUS ULTRA or more beyond. The bottom row, just above the waves, gives the date as 1718. This is a very valuable coin. Collectors will pay premiums for visible components such as these. Escudos with pillars and waves were produced only in Peru.\n\nLong tied to the lore of piracy, “pieces of eight” were manufactured in the Americas and transported in bulk back to Spain, making them a very tempting target for seagoing pirates. The Manila galleons transported Mexican silver to Manila in the Spanish Philippines, where it would be exchanged for Philippine and Chinese goods, since silver was the only foreign commodity China would accept. In Oriental trade, Spanish dollars were often stamped with Chinese characters known as “chop marks” which indicated that particular coin had been assayed by a well-known merchant and determined to be genuine. The specifications of the Spanish dollar became a standard for trade in the Far East, with later Western powers issuing trade dollars, and colonial currencies such as the Hong Kong dollar, to the same specifications. The first Chinese yuan coins had the same specification as a Spanish dollar, leading to a continuing equivalence in some respects between the names “yuan” and “dollar” in the Chinese language.\n\nThe 18th and 19th century Spanish dollar and Mexican peso were widely used in the early United States. In 1785, the value of the United States dollar was set by decree to approximately match the Spanish dollar. Both were based on the silver content of the coins. The first U.S. dollar coins were not issued until 1792 and the peso continued to be officially recognized and used in the US, along with other foreign coins, until 1857. In Canada, it remained legal tender, along with other foreign silver coins, until 1854 and continued to circulate beyond that date. The Mexican peso also served as the model for the Straits dollar [now the Singapore/Brunei Dollar], the Hong Kong dollar, the Japanese yen and the Chinese yuan. The term Chinese yuan refers to the round Spanish dollars, Mexican pesos and other silver coins which saw use in China during the 19th and 20th century. The Mexican peso was also briefly legal tender in 19th century Siam, when government mints were unable to accommodate a sudden influx of foreign traders, and was exchanged at a rate of three pesos to one Thai baht.\n\nMexican Coins.\n\nDuring the centuries\n\nthat Mexico was a colony of Spain, the silver real was the country’s currency. It took 8 reales to equal a single peso and 2 peso equalled one gold escudo. The first real was introduced by King Pedro I of Castile in the mid 14th century at a value of 3 maravedíes. This rate of exchange increased until 1497, when the real, now issued in billon, was fixed at a value of 34 maravedíes. The famous “piece of eight” [peso de a ocho], also known as the Spanish dollar, was issued that same year as a trade coin. It later became widespread in North America and Asia. In 1566, the gold escudo was introduced, worth 16 silver reales. The “piece of eight” was so-called because the denomination was divided into eight silver reales [8 reales = 1 piece of eight]. In addition to the “piece of eight,” which was a 28 g silver coin, other coins based on it were issued: 4 reales, 2 reales, 1 real and the little [12 mm diameter] half real.\n\nForty years after Mexico gained its independence from Spain, a decimal monetary system was introduced in 1863, 100 centavos became the new base value of the peso. Of the coins from the early days of the Republica Mexicana, escudos and reales minted in the 1820’s are in particularly high demand. Each featured a variation of an eagle with a snake in its beak on the obverse [a reference to the legend of Mexico City’s founding], with a liberty cap on the reverse.\n\nIn 1905, the gold content of the peso was reduced by almost 50 percent. The artistry of the coin did not suffer, however, especially in 1910, when a silver peso was struck featuring yet another variation of that Mexico City eagle on the obverse, with a woman riding a horse in front of a radiating sun on the other side. Other Mexican coins of note include round lead centavos issued by the state of Durango in 1914 and rectangular copper Oaxacan centavos from 1915. The first coins of the peso currency were 1 centavo pieces minted in 1863 at the direction of Emperor Maximilian, ruler of the Second Mexican Empire from 1864–1867, His portrait was on the obverse, with the legend “Maximiliano Emperador;” the reverse shows the imperial arms and the legends “Imperio Mexicano” and “1 Peso” and the date. They were struck from 1866 to 1867.\n\nThe New Mexican republic continued to strike the 8 reales piece, but also began minting Gold coins in 1870 with the obverse featured the Mexican ‘eagle’ and the legend “Republica Mexicana.” The reverse of the larger coins showed a pair of scales; those of the smaller coins, the denomination. However, from 1918 onward, the weight and fineness of all the silver coins declined, until 1977, when the last silver 100 peso coins were minted.\n\nIn 1910, a new peso coin was issued, the famous Caballito, considered one of the most beautiful of Mexican coins. The obverse had the Mexican official coat of arms [an eagle with a snake in its beak, standing on a cactus plant] and the legends “Estados Unidos Mexicanos” and “Un Peso.” The reverse showed a woman riding a horse, her hand lifted high in exhortation, and the date. These were minted in .903 silver from 1910 to 1914.\n\nIn 1947, a new issue of silver coins was struck, with the 50 centavos and 1 peso in .500 fineness and a new 5-peso coin in .900 fineness. A portrait of José María Morelos appeared on the 1 peso and this was to remain a feature of the 1-peso coin until its demise. A new portrait of Morelos appeared on the 1 peso, with Cuauhtemoc on the 50 centavos and Miguel Hidalgo on the 5 pesos. No reference was made to the silver content except on the 5 pesos.\n\nIn 1957, new 1 peso coins were issued in .100 silver. This series contained 1.6 g of silver per peso. A special 1 peso was minted in 1957 to commemorate Benito Juárez and the constitution of 1857. These were the last silver pesos. Between 1960 and 1971, a new coinage was introduced, consisting of brass, cupro-nickeland silver 25 pesos [only issued 1972]. In 1977, silver 100 pesos were issued for circulation. In 1980, smaller 5-peso coins were introduced alongside 20 pesos and 50 pesos in cupro-nickel. Between 1978 and 1982, the sizes of the coins for 20 centavos and above were reduced. Base metal 100, 200, 500, 1000 and 5000-peso coins were introduced between 1984 and 1988.\n\nNew peso\n\nThroughout most of the 20th century, the Mexican peso remained one of the more stable currencies in Latin America, since the economy did not experience periods of hyperinflation common to other countries in the region. However, after the Oil Crisis of the late 1970s, Mexico defaulted on its external debt in 1982, and as a result the country suffered a severe case of capital flight, followed by several years of inflation and devaluation, until a government economic strategy called the “Stability and Economic Growth Pact” [PECE] was adopted under President Carlos Salinas.\n\nOn January 1 1993 the Bank of Mexico introduced a new currency, the nuevo peso written “N$” . One N$1.00, was equal to 1000 of the obsolete MXP pesos. On January 1, 1996, nuevo was dropped from the name and new coins and banknotes, identical in every respect to the 1993 issue, were put into circulation. Thanks to the stability of the Mexican economy and the growth in foreign investment, the Mexican peso is now among the 15 most traded currency units in recent years.\n\nIn 2003, the Banco de Mexico began the gradual launch of a new series of bimetallic $100 coins. These 32 issues – one for each of the nation’s 31 states, plus the Federal District bear the traditional coat of arms of Mexico, the reverse show the individual coats of arms of the component states. In circulation they are extraordinarily rare, but their novelty value offsets the unease most users feel at having such a large amount of money in a single coin. Although the Bank has tried to encourage users to collect full sets of these coins, issuing special display folders for the purpose, the high cost involved has worked against them. Bullion versions of these coins are also available, with the outer ring made of gold, instead of aluminium bronze.\n\nSher Shah Suri, an Afghan, who ruled for a brief time in– mid 16th C, issued a coin of silver which was termed the Rupiya. This was the precursor of the modern rupee. It remained largely unchanged till the early 20th Century.\n\nTogether with the silver Rupiya were issued gold coins called the Mohur weighing 169 grains and copper coins called Dam. Mughal coin designs came to maturity during the reign of Akbar.\n\nInnovations like ornamentation of the background of the die with floral scrollwork were introduced. The surviving gigantic coins, are amongst the largest in the world. The Zodiacal signs, portraits and literary verses and the excellent calligraphy that came to characterise his coins took Mughal Coinage to new heights. Aurangzeb, the last of the Grand Mughals was austere in his ways and orthodox in his beliefs. He did away with the Kalima, the Islamic Article of Faith from his coins, and the format of coins was standardised to incorporate the name of the ruler, the mint and the date of issue.\n\nPre-Colonial India & Princely States\n\nThe decline of the Mughal Empire commenced soon after the death of Aurangzeb. In the anarchy that followed, regional forces tended to reassert themselves and states with ancient antecedents, many of which had been independent during Medieval times, like the states of Rajputana, re-emerged. The dilution of central authority prompted Provincial Governors to assume independence [e.g., the states of Avadh and Hyderabad]. The turbulence of the times also gave rise to military adventurers who through force carved out kingdoms for themselves, like Scindia [Gwalior], and Hyder Ali [Mysore]. When the British Crown took over the administration from the East India Company in 1858 there were over a hundred Princely States which were issuing coins nominally in the name of the Mughal Emperor. With the deportation of the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah to Rangoon, the native rulers gradually replaced the Mughal super-inscriptions on their coins with the name or portrait of the Queen of England as an expression of acceptance of British supremacy.\n\nThe Maratha Confederacy\n\nWhile the Marathas have had a long history, they came into the limelight in the 17th century led by the charismatic leader Shivaji. The Maratha Confederacy consolidated itself after Aurangzeb’s death and their military successes saw them overrun most of India by 1738 AD. Although their fortunes suffered a setback with the battle of Panipat in 1761 AD, they retained their hegemony over the Deccan till the end of the century.\n\nShivaji first issued coins in 1664 AD when he assumed the title of Raja. Coins were again issued to commemorate his coronation at Raigadh in 1674 AD. These coins are rare. Maratha Mints and coinage were consolidated around the middle of the 18th century.\n\nAwadh.\n\nThe Province of Awadh, situated in Northern India, was governed by Nawab-Wazirs on behalf of the Mughal Emperor from around 1720 AD. The monetary system consisted of the gold ashrafi, the silver rupee with five denominations and the copper fulus. The defeat of the Nawab of Awadh at the Battle of Buxar precipitated the decline of the Kingdom. Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab was forced to abdicate in 1856 by Lord Dalhousie.\n\nMysore\n\nIn 1761, Haider Ali a military adventurer deposed the Wodeyar ruler and proclaimed himself King. In the region, coins of both the Mughal and Vijayanagar standards were current. His coins of the pagoda types continued to carry the motifs and iconographic forms of the Vijayanagar period with the letter ‘He’ on the reverse. Tipu, his son, introduced various innovations and new varieties in his coinage, continuing with the pagodas, the mohurs, and introduced his own standards. An interesting feature of his coins is that they do not bear his name.\n\nTipu Sultan was slain in 1799 after which the British reinstated Krishna Raja Wodeyar as King of Mysore who continued to issue coins of the Vijayanagar and Mughal standards. The gold coins carried the Hara-Gauri motif and the King’s name on the reverse. The silver coins were in the Mughal tradition, bearing the name of the Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II on the obverse and the name of the mint on the reverse.\n\nCoins of the Sikhs\n\nGuru Nanak laid the foundations of a religious community, which gradually metamorphosed into the Sikh Empire. Constant harassment by the Mughal forces because of the failure of the Sikhs to embrace Islam, led to the emergence of Sikh militarism. With the defeat of Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1710, the Sikh league dominated the whole tract of land between Jhelum and Sutlej. Around 1777 AD, coins were issued from without the name of the Mughal Emperor and were called ‘Nanak Shahi’. These coins bore the name of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and the last Guru of the Sikhs. The most distinguished statesman amongst the chieftains was Ranjit Singh who successfully recaptured Amritsar, Ludhiana, Multan, Kashmir and Peshawar. The treaty of 1809, with the British, confirmed his right to rule the tracts he had occupied south of Sutlej. However, after his death, the Sikh Empire began to deteriorate and was finally annexed to the British Empire in 1849. Most coins struck during the reign of Ranjit Singh bear a large leaf on one side and bear Persian legends.\n\nHyderabad\n\nThe Princely State of Hyderabad was founded around 1724 when Mir Qamar-ud-Din, the Mughal Viceroy of the Deccan, assumed independence under the title of Asaf Jah and founded the dynasty of the Nizams of Hyderabad. The coins of the Nizams were issued in the name of the Mughal Emperor till 1858 when a coin legend was introduced with the name of the founder of the state, Asaf Jha. Thereafter, they were struck independently and the new coins were termed the ‘Hali Sicca’, i.e., the current coins. In 1903-04 coins were machine struck for the first time. These coins featured the Charminar on the obverse with Persian inscription Nizam-ul-mulk Bahadur Asaf Jah around it. The reverse carried the value.\n\nEarly English settlements in India had three broad grouping: those in Western India [Bombay & Surat], those in South India [Madras] and those in the Eastern Province of Bengal [Calcutta[. The coins of Bengal were developed along the Mughal pattern, those of Madras were struck along South Indian lines in design [Pagoda] as well as along Mughal designs. The English coins of Western India developed along Mughal as well as English patterns. It was only in 1717 AD that the English obtained permission from the Emperor Farrukhsiyar to coin Mughal money at the Bombay mint. English pattern coins were struck at the Bombay [now Mumbai] Mint. The gold coins were termed Carolina, the silver coins Anglina, the copper coins Cupperoon and tin coins Tinny.\n\nIn the 19th century when the strongest economies in the world were on the gold standard. The discovery of large quantities of silver in the United States and several European colonies resulted in a decline in the value of silver relative to gold, devaluing India’s standard currency. This event was known as “the fall of the rupee.” India was unaffected by the imperial order-in-council of 1825, which attempted to introduce British sterling coinage to the British colonies. British India, at that time, was controlled by the British East India Company. The silver rupee continued as the currency of India through the British Raj and beyond. In 1835, British India adopted a mono-metallic silver standard based on the rupee; this decision was influenced by a letter written by Lord Liverpool in 1805 extolling the virtues of mono-metallism.\n\nNewly designed coins with the effigy of William IV on the obverse and the value on the reverse in English and Persian, were issued in 1835 and after 1840 the portrait of Queen Victoria. The first coinage under the crown was issued in 1862 and in 1877 Queen Victoria assumed the title the Empress of India. Edward VII succeeded Queen Victoria and the coins issued bore his effigy.\n\nFollowing the Indian Mutiny in 1857, the British government took direct control of British India. Since 1851, gold sovereigns were produced en masse at the Royal Mint in Sydney. In an 1864 attempt to make the British gold sovereign the “imperial coin”, the treasuries in Bombay and Calcutta were instructed to receive gold sovereigns; however, these gold sovereigns never left the vaults. As the British government gave up hope of replacing the rupee in India with the pound sterling, it realised for the same reason it could not replace the silver dollar in the Straits Settlements with the Indian rupee as the British East India Company desired. Since the silver crisis of 1873, a number of nations adopted the gold standard; however, India remained on the silver standard until it was replaced by a basket of commodities and currencies in the late 20th century.\n\nThe Panic of 1873 was a financial crisis that triggered a depression in Europe and North America that lasted for six years, and even longer in France and Britain. In Britain, for example, it started two decades of stagnation known as the “Long Depression” that weakened the country’s economic leadership. The Panic of 1873 and the subsequent depression had several underlying causes; American post-Civil War inflation; rampant speculative investments in railroads; the demonetization of silver in Germany and the US; ripples from economic dislocation in Europe resulting from the Franco-Prussian War ; property losses in the Chicago (1871) and Boston (1872) fires, and other factors put a massive strain on bank reserves, which plummeted in New York City during September and October 1873 from US$50 million to $17 million. The first symptoms of the crisis were financial failures in the Austro-Hungarian capital, Vienna, which spread to most of Europe and North America by 1873.\n\nThe Indian Coinage Act, 1906 was passed which governed the establishment of Mints as well as the coins that would be issued and the standards that would be maintained. The 1911 accession to the throne of the King-Emperor George V led to the famous “pig rupee”. On the coin, the King appeared wearing the chain of the Order of the Indian Elephant. Through poor engraving, the elephant looked very much like a pig. The Muslim population was enraged and the image had to be quickly redesigned.\n\nAcute shortage of silver on account of World War I, led the British Government to issue paper currency of One Rupee and Two and a half Rupees.\n\nProblems caused by the gold standard\n\nAt the onset of the First World War, the cost of gold was very low and therefore the pound sterling had high value. But during the First World War, the value of the pound fell alarmingly due to rising war expenses. At the conclusion of the war, the value of the pound was only a fraction of what it used to be prior to the commencement of the war. It remained low until 1925, when the then Chancellor of the Exchequer of the UK, Winston Churchill, restored it to pre-War levels. As a result, the price of gold fell rapidly. While the rest of Europe purchased large quantities of gold from the United Kingdom, there was little increase in her gold reserves. This dealt a further blow to an already deteriorating British economy. The United Kingdom began to look to its possessions such as India to compensate for the gold that was sold.\n\nThe Indian rupee replaced the Danish Indian rupee in 1845, the French Indian rupee in 1954 and the Portuguese Indian escudo in 1961. Following the independence of British India in 1947 and the accession of the princely states to the new Union, the Indian rupee replaced all the currencies of the previously autonomous states, although the Hyderabadi rupee was not demonetised until 1959. Some of the states had issued rupees equal to those issued by the British [such as the Travancore rupee ].\n\nThe Travancore rupee was a type of currency issued by the State of Travancore, now mainly a part of Kerala. The rupee was largely a newer currency in comparison to the older currencies such as the Fanams, Chakrams and Kashu. Its creation was probably intended for the increased trading with British India and the high value transactions therein. The Travancore Rupee was the highest denomination of currency issued for general circulation, with a face value of ‘1/2 rupee’. The Travancore Rupee was issued until 1946 CE (1121 M.E. or Malayalam Era), remaining in circulation till 1949. It was replaced by the Indian rupee following Travancore’s accession into India.\n\nThe Travancore Rupee often had the names or insignia of the reigning monarch in English. The reverse features inscriptions in the native language of Malayalam as well as the royal insignia of Travancore. The inscriptions are largely a direct translation of the front of the coin. The year, when printed on the coins was based on the Malayalam calendar (and corresponding Malayalam Era – M.E.) which begins circa 825 CE. Therefore, the year of issue of the coin can be found by adding 825 to it. Example – The year of issue of a coin showing 1000, will be 1825 C.E.). Therefore, the year of issue of the coin with year 1116 will be 1940-41.\n\nIn 1862, coins known as “regal issues”, were introduced which bore the portrait of Queen Victoria and the designation “India”. The gold denominations ceased production in 1891, and no half-anna coins were issued after 1877. In 1918, the Bombay mint struck gold sovereigns and 15 rupee coins identical in size to the sovereigns as an emergency measure during the First World War. In the early 1940’s, several changes were implemented. The half anna and half pice ceased production, the qtr anna was changed to a bronze, holed coin, cupro-nickel and nickel-brass half anna coins were introduced, and the silver composition was reduced from 91.7 to 50 percent. The last of the regal issues were minted in 1946 and 1947 bearing the image of George VI, King and Emperor on the obverse and an Indian tiger on the reverse.\n\nBurma issues: Burma separated from India in 1938; however, the Reserve Bank of India acted as Banker to the Government of Burma and was responsible for currency. In May 1938 the Bank issued Burma notes which were not legal tender in India.\n\nIndo-French issues: The French Indian rupee (FIR) was introduced by France’s Bank of Indochina in French colonies of India.\n\nIndo-Portuguese issues : The Portuguese Indian Rupia was the currency of Portuguese India until 1959. The first paper money issued specifically for Portuguese India was issued by the Junta da Fazenda Pública in 1882 in denominations of 10 and 20 rupias. These were followed in 1883 by notes issued by the General Government (Governo Geral) . In 1906, the Banco Nacional Ultramarino took over the issuance of paper money, issuing tanga denominated notes, whilst the 21⁄2 rupia notes were issued until 1924 and 100 and 500 rupias notes were reintroduced in 1924.\n\nPersian Gulf issues: For many years in the early 20th century, the Indian rupee was the official currency in several areas that were controlled by the British and governed from India: areas such as East Africa, Southern Arabia and the Persian Gulf. The rupees used in the Persian Gulf had been bought by the Gulf states from the Reserve Bank of India, who held the sterling reserves by which the rupees had originally been purchased. However, Indian rupees were being smuggled from India to the states of the Persian Gulf in exchange for gold. It was estimated in 1959 that the total amount of gold in private hands in India was about $US1.75 to 2 billion – roughly two-thirds of the value of paper money in circulation. While it was legal to own and to trade in gold within India, it was illegal to import or export gold.\n\nThe Gulf Rupee, also known as the Persian Gulf Rupee (PGR), was introduced by he Indian government for circulation exclusively outside the country. After India devalued the rupee on June 1966, those countries still using it – Oman, Qatar and what is now the United Arab Emirates – replaced the Gulf Rupee with their own currencies.\n\nEmergency issues, Princely states: During the 1940s, when mints were occupied for use in the war, an acute scarcity of small coins was felt throughout India. Princely states in Western India issued “Cash Coupons” to meet the shortage.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of India was formally inaugurated on April Fools day 1935 with its Central Office at Calcutta. It continued issuing Government of India notes until its own notes were ready for issue. The bank issued the first five rupee note bearing the portrait of George VI in 1938. The first Reserve Bank issues were signed by the second Governor, Sir James Taylor. In August 1940, the one-rupee note was reintroduced as a wartime measure, as a Government note with the status of a rupee coin. During the war, the Japanese produced high-quality forgeries of the Indian currency. This necessitated a change in the watermark. The profile portrait of George VI was changed to his full frontal portrait and the security thread was introduced for the first time in India. WW2 led to experiments in coinage where the standard rupee was replaced by the “Quaternary Silver Alloy” issued from 1940. The George VI series continued till 1947 and thereafter as a frozen series till 1950 when post-independence notes were issued.\n\nThe Anna Series: This series was introduced on 15th August, 1950 and represented the first coinage of Republic India. The King’s Portrait was replaced by the Lion Capital of the Ashoka Pillar. A corn sheaf replaced the Tiger on the one Rupee coin. Indian motifs were incorporated on other coins.\n\nPaper money, in the modern sense, has its origin in the late 18th C with the note issues of private banks as well as semi-government banks. In 1835, the East India Company introduced the Company’s Rupee to bring about uniformity of coinage over British India. Later, with the establishment of three Presidency Banks, the job of issuing notes was taken over by them. Each Presidency Bank had the right to issue notes within certain limits. The Bank of Bengal notes generally circulated within Calcutta, were mainly used for effecting large transactions.\n\nThe first set of British India notes were the ‘Victoria Portrait’ Series were unifaced, carried two language panels and were printed on hand-moulded paper manufactured at the Laverstock Paper Mills. The security features incorporated the watermark [Government of India, rupees, two signatures and wavy lines], the printed signature and the registration of the notes.\n\nAs a security precaution, notes were cut in half. One set was sent by post. On confirmation of receipt, the other half was dispatched. The Victoria Portrait series was withdrawn in the wake of a spate of forgeries and replaced by the unifaced ‘Underprint Series’ which were introduced in 1867.\n\nRegular issues of this Series carrying the portrait of George V were introduced in May, 1923 on a Ten Rupee Note. The King’s Portrait Motif continued as an integral feature of all Paper Money issues of British India. The government of India continued to issue currency notes till 1935 when the Reserve Bank of India took over the functions of the Controller of Currency.\n\nThe Decimal Series\n\nIt was in September, 1955 that the Indian Coinage Act was amended for the country to adopt a metric system for coinage. The rupee remained unchanged in value and nomenclature. It, however, was now divided into 100 ‘Paisa’ instead of 16 Annas or 64 Pice. For public recognition, the new decimal Paisa was termed ‘Naya Paisa’ till 1st June, 1964 when the term ‘Naya’ was dropped.\n\n1966 Economic crisis\n\nFrom 1950, India ran continued trade deficits that increased in magnitude in the 1960s. Furthermore, the Government of India had a budget deficit problem and could not borrow money from abroad or from the private corporate sector. As a result, the government issued bonds to the RBI, which increased the money supply, leading to inflation. In 1966, foreign aid, which had hitherto been a key factor in preventing devaluation of the rupee, was finally cut off and India was told it had to liberalise its restrictions on trade before foreign aid would again materialise. Furthermore, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 led the US and other countries friendly towards Pakistan to withdraw foreign aid to India, which necessitated more devaluation. Another factor leading to devaluation was the drought of 1965/1966 which resulted in a sharp rise in prices. At the end of 1969, the Indian Rupee was trading at around 13 British pence. A decade later, by 1979, it was trading at around 6 British pence. Finally, by the end of 1989, the Indian Rupee had plunged to an all-time low of 3 British pence. This triggered a wave of irreversible liberalisation reforms away from populist measures.\n\nIn 1969, a commemorative design series in honour of the birth centenary celebrations of Mahatma Gandhi was issued depicting a seated Gandhi with the Sevagram Ashram as the backdrop. The 1980s saw a completely new set of notes issued. The motifs on these notes marked a departure form the earlier motifs. The emphasis lay on symbols of Science & Technology, Progress and a change in orientation to Indian Art forms.\n\nThe Rupee 500 note was introduced in October 1987 with the portrait of Mahatma Gandhi. The water mark continued to be the Lion Capital, Ashoka Pillar. With the advancement of reprographic techniques, it was necessary to introduce new features and a new ‘Mahatma Gandhi Series’ was introduced in 1996. A changed watermark, windowed security thread, latent image and intaglio features for the visually handicapped are amongst the new features.\n\nThe Government of India took everybody by surprise by withdrawing the Legal Tender status of ₹ 500 and ₹ 1,000 denominations of banknotes of the Mahatma Gandhi Series issued by the Reserve Bank of India till November 8, 2016. This is necessitated to tackle counterfeiting Indian banknotes, to effectively nullify black money hoarded in cash and curb funding of terrorism with fake notes. Starting from November 10, 2016, members of public, business firms, societies, trusts, etc., holding these notes can tender them at any office of the Reserve Bank or any bank branch and obtain value thereof by credit into their respective bank accounts. For their immediate cash needs, these notes of value up to ₹ 4,000 per person can be exchanged for cash over the counter of these bank branches. Public were advised to present a valid proof of identity for availing this exchange facility.\n\nOrigin of the Shilling\n\nThe shilling was originally a unit of account dating back to Anglo-Saxon times. A shilling, worth twelve pence, was the value of a sheep and larger value transactions were generally defined in terms of shillings. The value of a shilling remained more or less the same throughout the middle ages, all the way up until the Tudor period, when inflation started to eat into its purchasing power. At around this time, the forerunner of the shilling coin, the testoon, was introduced in about 1487.\n\nThe First Shilling\n\nThe first shilling was issued in the reign of Edward VI in 1549, and was one of the first British coins to bear a date, at first in Roman numerals MDXLIX. By 1551, shillings were struck which showed a value mark XII, denoting twelve pence. It is commonly but incorrectly believed that the “s” in £.s.d. stands for shilling. It stands in fact for “solidus”, a Roman coin denomination. On the milled coinage of Oliver Cromwell, and Charles II from 1662, the denomination or mark of value was omitted, and did not reappear until 1831 under George IV. The really interesting period comes during the reign of Charles I, because not only were there a wide range of styles and mints for the official coinage [The Coincraft catalogue lists 76 different varieties], but there were some unusual provisional issues made from plates and other silver items while the city of Carlisle and the towns Newark, Scarborough and Pontefract were under siege. The denomination was omitted from 1887 to 1893 on the Victoria jubilee head issues, returned on the Victoria old head issues until the last issue at decimalisation.\n\nFrom its inception, the reverse design was always a shield, except in the Commonwealth of England period, in which it changed to two shields.\n\nWith the changeover to milled coinage in 1662, the design changed to four crowned cruciform shields, although the execution of this design changed throughout its lifetime. In 1878, under George III, the crowns were moved into the angles between the shields, and after the great recoinage of 1816, changed again to a large shield within a garter. Under George IV, there were two issues, one with a large crowned and garnished shield, then a shield in garter.\n\nOn the coronation of Edward VII in 1902, a new shilling design appeared, which was a lion guardant standing left on a crown, although we have seen this described incorrectly as a rampant lion. This design continued under George V, when a modified version of the same design was introduced. From the introduction of the George VI new designs, two separate shilling designs were issued, one with an “English” reverse, and on with a “Scottish” reverse. The English design features a lion standing on a crown, at either side there are two roses, the Scottish design features a lion seated on a smaller crown, at either side are a Saint Andrew’s cross and a thistle.\n\nWhen new designs were produced for Queen Elizabeth II, the two separate designs were continued, but now the English version had three lions passant guardant within a shield, the Scottish variant had a single rampant lion within a shield, and the crowns differ in that the English version had two fleur-de-lys, while the Scottish version had two crosses.\n\nIn the traditional pounds, shillings and pence system, there were 20 shillings per pound and 12 pence per shilling, and thus there were 240 pence in a pound. Three coins denominated in multiple shillings were also in circulation at this time. They were:\n\nthe florin, two shillings\n\nthe half-crown, two shillings and sixpence or one-eighth of a pound,\n\nthe crown [five shillings], the highest denominated non-bullion UK coin in circulation at decimalisation: in practice, crowns were commemorative coins not used in everyday transactions.\n\nAt decimalisation in 1971, the shilling coin was superseded by the new five-pence piece, which initially was of identical size and weight and had the same value, and inherited the shilling’s slang name of a bob.\n\nIrish shillings\n\nBetween 1701 and the unification of the currencies in 1825, the Irish shilling was valued at 13 pence and known as the “black hog”, as opposed to the 12-pence English shillings which were known as “white hogs”. In the Irish Free State and Republic of Ireland the shilling was issued as scilling in Irish. It was worth 1/20th of an Irish pound, and was interchangeable at the same value to the British coin, which continued to be used in Northern Ireland. The coin featured the bull on the obverse side. The first minting from 1928 until 1941 contained 75% silver, more than the equivalent British coin. The original Irish shilling coin [retained after decimalisation] was finally withdrawn from circulation in 1993, as a smaller five-pence coin was introduced.\n\nAustralian shillings\n\nAustralian shillings, twenty of which made up one Australian pound, were first issued in 1910, with the Australian coat of arms on the reverse and King Edward VII on the face. The coat of arms design was retained through the reign of King George V until a new ram’s head design was introduced for the coins of King George VI. This design continued until the last year of issue in 1963.\n\nIn 1966, Australia’s currency was decimalised and the shilling was replaced by a ten cent coin of the same size and weight where 10 shillings made up one Australian dollar. The slang term for a shilling coin in Australia was “deener”. The slang term for a shilling as currency unit was “bob”, the same as in the United Kingdom.\n\nNew Zealand shilling\n\nNew Zealand shillings, twenty of which made up one New Zealand pound, were first issued in 1933 and featured the image of a Maori warrior carrying a taiaha “in a warlike attitude” on the reverse. In 1967, New Zealand’s currency was decimalised and the shilling was replaced by a ten cent coin of the same size and weight. Smaller 10-cent coins were introduced in 2006.\n\nMaltese shillings\n\nIn 1825, an imperial order-in-council introduced British currency to Malta, replacing a number of coins in circulation, including that issued in Malta by the Knights of St John. The pound was valued at 12 scudi of the local currency. This exchange rate meant that the smallest Maltese coin, the grano, was worth one third of a farthing [1 scudo = 20 tari = 240 grani]. Consequently, 1⁄3-farthing coins were issued for use in Malta until 1913 alongside the regular British coinage. Amongst the British colonies which used the sterling coinage, Malta was unique in having the 1⁄3-farthing coin. Between 1914 and 1918, wartime emergency paper money issues were made by the government. Until 1972, it was subdivided into 20 shillings, each of 12 pence with 4 farthings to the penny; from May 1972 it was divided into 100 cents, and the 1 cent into 10 mils.\n\nPre-decimal British sterling coinage continued to circulate in Malta for nearly a year after it was withdrawn in the UK due to decimalization. Then in 1972, a new, decimal Maltese currency, the lira, was introduced, in both coin and banknote form. The lira was initially equal to the pound sterling, however this parity did not survive long after the floating of sterling on 22 June 1972.\n\nCeylonese shillings\n\nThe rixdollar was the currency of British Ceylon until 1828. It was subdivided into 48 stivers. Units called the fanam and larin were also used, worth 4 and 9½ stiver, respectively. The currency derived from the rijksdaalder and stuiver, the rixdollar was replaced by the British pound at a rate of 1 rixdollar = 1/6 pence’\n\nWith the replacement of the rixdollar by the rupee in 1852, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to half a rupee. On the decimalisation of the currency in 1869, a shilling was deemed to be equivalent to 50 Ceylon cents. The term continued to be used colloquially until the late 20th century.\n\nEast African shillings\n\nThe East African shilling was in use in the British colonies and protectorates of Somaliland, Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda and Zanzibar from 1920, when it replaced the rupee, until after they countries became independent. Upon independence in 1960, the East African shilling in the former British Somaliland and the somalo in the former Italian Somaliland were replaced by the Somali shilling.\n\nIn 1966, the East African Monetary Union broke up, and the member countries replaced their currencies with the Kenyan shilling, the Ugandan shilling and the Tanzanian shilling, respectively. Though all these currencies have different values at present, there were plans to reintroduce the East African shilling as a new common currency by 2009, although this has not come about.\n\nNorthern America\n\nIn the thirteen British colonies that became the United States in 1776, British money was often in circulation. Each colony issued its own paper money, with pounds, shillings, and pence used as the standard units of account. Some coins were minted in the colonies, such as the 1652 pine-tree shilling in Massachusetts Bay Colony. After the United States adopted the dollar as its unit of currency and accepted the gold standard, one British shilling was worth 24 US cents. Due to ongoing shortages of US coins in some regions, shillings continued to circulate deep into the 19th century.\n\nSomali shilling\n\nThe Somaliland shilling is the official currency of Somaliland, a self-declared republic that is internationally recognized as an autonomous region of Somalia. The currency is not recognized as legal tender by the international community, and it currently has no official exchange rate. It is regulated by the Bank of Somaliland, the territory’s central bank. Although the authorities in Somaliland have attempted to bar usage of the Somali shilling, it is still the preferred means of exchange for many people in the region. The Somali shilling has been the currency of parts of Somalia since 1921, when the East African shilling was introduced to the former British Somaliland protectorate.\n\nOther shillings.\n\nElsewhere in the former British Empire, forms of the word shilling remain in informal use.\n\nIn Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, selen is used to mean “money”;\n\nin Malaysia, syiling (pronounced like shilling) means “coin”.\n\nin Egypt and Jordan the shillin : is equal to 1/20th (5 qirshes English: piastres) of the Egyptian pound or the Jordanian dinar.\n\nIn Belize, the term shilling is commonly used to refer to twenty-five cents.\n\nAustrian schilling\n\nThe 1st Schilling was established by the Schilling Act of 1924 at a rate of 1 Schilling to 10,000 Austro-Hungarian Kronen and issued on March 1, 1925. The Schilling was abolished in the wake of the anschluss [1938], when it was exchanged at a rate of 2 German Reichsmark to 3 Schilling. The Second Schilling was reintroduced after WW2 by the Allied Military, who issued paper money [dated 1944] in denominations of 50 Groschen up to 100 Schilling. The exchange rate to the Reichsmark was 1:1, limited to 150 Schilling per person. The Nationalbank also began issuing Schilling notes in 1945 and the first coins were issued in 1946.\n\nOther European shillings\n\nShillings were issued in the Scandinavian countries until the Scandinavian Monetary Union of 1873, and in the city of Hamburg, Germany.\n\nIn Poland szeląg was used.\n\nLow Countries\n\nIn the principalities covering present Netherlands, Belgium and Luxemburg, the cognate term schelling was used as an equivalent ‘arithmetic’ currency, a ‘solidus’ representing 12 ‘denarii’ or 1/20 ‘pound’, while actual coins were rarely physical multiples of it, but still expressed in these terms.\n\nhttps://www.taleruniverse.com\n\nTo begin with, the name “thaler” was used as an abbreviation of “Joachims thaler”, a coin type from the town of Joachimsthal in the Kingdom of Bohemia where there were silver mines and the first such coins were minted in 1518. This original Bohemian thaler carried a lion, from the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Bohemia.\n\nLautenthal, a town in the Harz Mountains of modern central Germany, was the site of a famous silver mine called “Lautenthal’s Luck.” The town was founded in 1538 when iron ore was discovered in the area. After further exploration, the town developed into a successful silver mining operation. These multiple talers, which depict Lautenthal and its mine works in careful detail, reveal the mine’s importance to the dukes of Brunswick as a source of great wealth. The young woman on the reverse, standing before a mountain valley scene, is likely an allegorical depiction of the goddess Fortuna. She plays a lute [“Laute” in German] in her role as the personification of the town of Lautenthal.\n\nThe dukes of Brunswick probably minted these large coins to serve as an emergency fund while Lautenthal’s rate of production was very high. Landowners in the duchy were required to purchase the talers according to their means. If the duke needed funding for a war or other emergency, he could ask for the coins to be returned. In exchange, the landowners would receive coins of lower silver purity.\n\nLöser: A numismatic legend\n\nThe zenith of Thaler minting occurred in the late 16th and 17th centuries with the so called “multiple Thalers”, often called Lösers in Germany. The first were minted in Brunswick, and indeed the majority were struck there. Some of these coins reached colossal size, as much as sixteen normal thalers. The original reason for minting these colossal coins, some of which exceeded 450g of silver and being over 12 cm in diameter, is uncertain. The name “löser” most likely was derived from a large gold coin minted in Hamburg called the Portugalöser, worth 10 ducats. Eventually the term was applied to numerous similar coins worth more than a single Thaler.\n\nAbout 400 years ago, Friedrich Ulrich Duke of Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel had a golden “Jakobs löser” made. Those Löser coins were minted from local metal [usually silver] found in the Harz mountains. This special one came from the St. Jakob mine in Lautenthal (Goslar county) and was not actually made as means of payment. These coins are very rare, the larger ones often costing tens of thousands of dollars, and are highly sought after by serious collectors of Thalers. Few circulated in any real sense so they often remain in well preserved condition.\n\nIn the Holy Roman Empire, the Thaler was used as the standard against which the various states’ currencies could be valued. One standard introduced by Prussia was the Reichsthaler, which contained one fourteenth of a Cologne mark of silver. In 1754, the Conventions thaler was introduced, containing one tenth of a Cologne mark of silver.\n\nIn 1837, the Prussian thaler became part of a currency union which set the value of the southern German gulden at 1.75 per thaler. By 1850, nearly all German states used this version of the Thaler, though with differing subdivisions. In 1857, the Vereinsthaler was adopted by most German states as well as in the Habsburg Empire. Vereins thalers were issued until 1871 in Germany and 1867 in Austria. Within the new German Empire, these coins circulated as 3 mark pieces until 1908 when they were withdrawn and demonetized. Some old countermarked thalers circulated as emergency coinage in Germany during the inflationary period following its defeat in World War One.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the daalder and rijks daalder circulated alongside the gulden at values of 1½ and 2½ gulden. The rijksdaalder depicted a lion; hence its Dutch name was leeuwendaler. These coins circulated in Romania and gave their name to the currencies of both Romania and Moldova, the leu. In the Netherlands, the name rijksdaalder lived on until the gulden was replaced by the euro in 2002.\n\nThe Thaler was introduced and became the most widespread currency in Scandinavia under the name daler during the early 17th century. Various daler circulated, including the Danish rigs daler, the Swedish riks daler and the Norwegian specie daler. These daler circulated in Denmark and Sweden until 1873 when they were replaced by the Danish krone and Swedish krona, the new currencies introduced by the Scandinavian Monetary Union. Norway joined the Monetary Union and introduced the Norwegian krone in 1876.\n\nAs silver flooded into the European economy from domestic and overseas sources, Thalers and Thaler-sized coins were minted all over with equivalent coins such as the crown, daalder [from which the English word “dollar” is derived], krona, and from 1497, the Spanish eight real coin was minted — a coin which would later become known in some parts of the world as the peso. Indeed, in England the word “dollar” was in use for the Thaler for 200 years before the issue of the United States dollar, and until the half crown ceased to be used following decimalisation in 1971, the term “half a dollar” could be heard for “half a crown”. In Switzerland and Germany, coins were minted to commemorate the Schützenfest [Shooting Festival]. These are commonly known as “Shooting thalers”.\n\nThe Maria Theresa Thaler is probably one of the most famous and well known coins of the world. Originally struck in Austria from 1740 to 1780, the Thaler was the currency of the Austrian Empire. It was very important for trade with the Levant [parts of Turkey, Lebanon, Syria]. Over time, the Maria Theresa Thaler became the best known and most popular silver coin in the Arabian world. After the death of Empress Maria Theresa in 1780, Joseph II permitted the Austrian mint to continue striking the coin with the 1780 dies in order to meet demand from the Middle East. The 1780 taler was the only silver coin that the Arabs trusted and would accept. Since then, the Maria Theresa Thaler has been restruck for trade purposes at Vienna, Austria with the 1780 date frozen in time. The taler became the unofficial currency in some areas of Africa and Asia, and may still be in use today as a “trade silver dollar” in some Arabian bazaars.\n\nNo currency currently in circulation is named thaler. Several, however, are acknowledging its legacy with their names: twenty three currencies named “dollar”, used in countries including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, New Zealand and United States of America, as well as tolar (slovene for thaler), used in Slovenia until the end of 2006. Between 1992 and 1995, Belarus planned to introduce Belarusian taler as a national currency. The Birr, the official currency of Ethiopia and Eritrea, takes its name from the local name for thaler, as well as the riyal of many Arabian countries.\n\nTales of a Thaler: Written by Peter Harrigan\n\nhttp://archive.aramcoworld.com/issue/200301/tales.of.a.thaler.htm\n\n“The favorite coin in use in this part of Arabia is the Maria Theresa dollar (riyal), the value of which is affected by the local demand. For the remoter parts of the interior little information is available; but it appears that the there Maria Theresa dollar is current almost everywhere.”\n\n–British Admiralty’s Handbook of Arabia 1920 (Aden and Vicinty)\n\nOn Tuesday November 5, 2002, the operator of the lever press at the Austrian Mint in Vienna struck the final coin of a two-day minting. The almost 2000 proof coins, their cameo portraits frosted in relief against a mirror-bright background, were packed individually in glassine wrappers. Most of the remaining 12,974 coins, of normal “bright uncirculated” quality, were packed 500 to a burlap bag and prepared for dispatch to banks in Austria and Germany and to overseas coin dealers. The date on the newly struck coins was the same date that had appeared on these coins for 222 years: 1780.\n\n“The mint received several orders from the USA and England that caught us with low stocks, so we had to schedule a striking,” says Kerry Tattersall, marketing and sales director of the 800-year-old official national mint of the Republic of Austria. “We are always happy on the infrequent occasions when we mint this coin. It is to us our Aufhangerschild, our shingle, the sign hanging outside our premises. This is our oldest, most traditional and most famous coin in production, and we will never stop striking it.”\n\nThat coin is the silver Maria Theresa thaler, pronounced tah-ler and known by numismatists and scholars simply as the MTT. Its design, luster and fine detail have earned it a reputation as one of the most beautiful coins in the world. Arabs have referred to it as abu nuqta [“the one with the dots”], abu tayr [“the one with birds”] and abu reesh [“the one with feathers”], all allusions to features of its intricate design.\n\nAnother name, “Levantine thaler,” points to one of the paths of its diffusion, as does the Arab misnomer, riyal fransawi [“French riyal”]. The French, less flatteringly, called it “la grosse madame.” Only riyal nimsawi [“Austrian riyal”] referred both to the coin’s true origin and to the fact that Arabs preferred the term riyal, from the Spanish silver real coin, to thaler or dollar.\n\nFirst struck in Spain in the 15th C, the real had circulated widely in the Mediterranean and the Middle East. By the beginning of the 19th C, however, the Maria Theresa thaler had supplanted it and become one of the most widely circulated coins on the globe. Passed from hand to hand by traders, it spread across the eastern Mediterranean into Arabia, along both shores of the Red Sea, around the Horn of Africa, into Ethiopia and Eritrea and down the coast of East Africa as far south as Lourenço Marques, the Portuguese port now known as Maputo in southern Mozambique, and the islands of Zanzibar and Madagascar.\n\nIt crossed the Sahara from the Maghrib and reached into Java and as far east as China. To the west, it crossed the Atlantic and was known, though not as widely used, in both North and South America. In countries that had no currency of their own, such as Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Ethiopia, the thaler survived well into the last century-as late as 1970 in Muscat and Oman. The rise, circulation and widespread appeal of the MTT at a time of shifting borders make it a remarkable early example of international money.\n\nMaria Theresa’s thaler coin had its origins in the 16th C as well, when the first Habsburg thalers were minted in an empire that then included Central Europe, the Low Countries and Spain with its American dominions. Maria Theresa entered into the Habsburg inheritance in 1740 on the death of her father, Emperor Charles VI. Then an archduchess of 23, she was beautiful, talented, intelligent and multilingual. Though she had no experience of statecraft, her father, always believing that there would be a male heir, had given her no regal responsibilities however she soon proved to be a skillful diplomat and ruler. She was crowned queen of Hungary in 1741 and queen of Bohemia two years later. In 1745 she arranged for the election of her husband, Prince Francis Stephen of Lorraine, as Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, and took the title of empress. Thereafter, Maria Theresa’s thalers carried the Latin inscription IMP MARIA THERKSIA along with some of her other regal titles, also abbreviated.\n\nMaria Theresa reigned over the Habsburg Empire from Vienna for 40 years. At the outset, hers was a daunting inheritance: The state coffers were empty, and there was skepticism about her ability. In addition to the burdens of rule, she bore 16 children, including Marie-Antoinette, who would become queen of France. She was known to attend to and sign state papers during childbirth, and she was, it turned out, energetic and tenacious. Throughout her reign, she devoted herself to agrarian, educational and economic reforms. She also picked the ablest of men to help her implement the changes.\n\nOne of them was her treasury head, Count Johann von Fries. He was shrewd enough to promote the MTT abroad. From its first striking in 1741, there were many versions, including half-thalers and smaller denominations, but it was the full thaler coin that, at the insistence of the empress, was minted to the highest standards of design and with the most stringent control of its silver content. In 1753 she signed one of the first European coinage conventions, a treaty with Bavaria, which defined the silver content of the thaler and other coins and set exchange rates. As a result, the MTT won trust and soon became a major export, helping the balance of trade and paying for Austrians’ appetite for imported coffee.\n\nEmpress Maria Theresa died in 1780, and MTTs since then have carried that date. By that year, the four Habsburg mints had struck more than 30 million thalers, more than any other coin of the time, with the possible exception of the Spanish dollar. She had literally coined a legacy, one that continued to proliferate beyond anything she herself might have imagined.\n\n“The minting records of two and a half centuries are not complete,” says the official, who searches for and acquires MTTs for the Austrian Mint’s own museum and modestly admits to being a hobby historian with a small private collection. “But I have seen estimates of totals of around 400 million pieces produced from eight Habsburg or Austrian mints and from an additional six mints in Europe and one in Bombay.”\n\nBy way of ports such as Genoa, Trieste, Livorno and Marseille, the MTTs made their way to Levantine, Egyptian and Red Sea ports along with consignments of metals, mirrors, Bohemian-glass bottles, clothing, trinkets, flint lighters, knives and razors, sealing wax and Leghorn and Florence silks. From trading centers like Suez, Jiddah, Suakin, Mokka and Massawa they diffused further still, re-exported-like many European goods-to the interior of Africa and Arabia and, by way of the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, to India, China and Southeast Asia. And Muslim pilgrims used them, an internationally recognized currency, as they traveled to and from the holy places.\n\nLike a wire closing an electrical circuit, the MTT filled a need. Europe was endlessly interested in the vast and exotic plenty that the Middle East offered: spices, aromatics, coffee, gum Arabic, indigo, mother of pearl, tortoise shells, ostrich feathers, Arabian horses and more. And in Asia and the Arab world, there was an insatiable demand for silver, no small part of it linked to the use of the coin in dowry payments and jewelry.\n\n“The richness and diversity of Arabian jewelry was overwhelming,” Clara Semple says, recalling her first encounter with the coin in the women’s market in Riyadh in 1968. “The MTT became a familiar sight as a component in the jewelry or as a pendant, sometimes heavily embossed with stones or fringed with bells and chains. In Yemeni markets I saw it used in exchange for goods and frequently employed as a standard weight,” says Semple, who, for more than three decades, has researched, photographed, recorded and collected jewelry and tribal ornaments throughout the Islamic world. During her travels she often saw silversmiths throw thalers into crucibles to melt them down to make jewelry: “The MTT was not just in itself an essential component of jewelry; it was an ingredient.”\n\nAs part of her research project on the MTT, Semple started to collect anecdotes and “thaler tales” from silversmiths and merchants, old consular reports, mint and bank records, and references to MTTs in travelers’ accounts.\n\n“From the 18th century onward, most of those passing through the thaler realms, be they traders, diplomats or explorers. allude to it. A frequent complaint, of course, was their weight and the difficulty of transporting large quantities of MTTs by camel or mule across deserts and mountains. And wherever it was used, the coin was subjected to careful scrutiny. Locals would count the number of pearls on Maria Theresa’s oval brooch, or check the feathers on the imperial eagle. These were the features to which the names ‘abu nuqta’ and ‘abu reesh’ refer. Recipients would reject coins out of hand if they did not precisely match the original 1780 strike “.\n\nThe wide acceptability and inherent bullion value of the MTT made it as valuable in war as in trade. For example, the 1867 expedition in which General Sir Robert Napier led 30,000 soldiers from India into the highlands of Ethiopia, to rescue the British consul and others taken hostage by Emperor Theodore, needed money to purchase supplies as it advanced into the interior, and the only acceptable currency at the time was the MTT. So an urgent dispatch was sent to the mint in Vienna, and they obliged by minting five million MTTs. The coins were carried on the backs of thousands of mules, horses and elephants, along with munitions and supplies.\n\nThe Maria Theresa thaler was similarly enmeshed in political intrigue, hoarded in subterranean chambers and used by European governments in the purchase and rental of such strategic Arabian Sea and Red Sea ports as Aden and Massawa. The intrepid Dutch heiress Alexine Tinne, who explored the deserts of North Africa in the 19th C, was murdered in a Tuareg raid, supposedly on account of her conspicuous quantities of MTTs. And in 1935, Mussolini demanded the dies from Austria so Italy could mint the coin for use in the Italian campaign in Abyssinia. The Italians refused to provide thalers to Britain and France, who needed them for trade, so between 1936 and 1941 the London Mint, with the full agreement of the British government, turned out more than 14 million Maria Theresa thalers of its own.\n\nAlmost as much as its high and reliable silver content, indeed, aesthetics played a role in the coin’s extraordinary success. The Maria Theresa thaler is an object of unusually intricate design and fine manufacture. Both faces and its inscribed edge seem to have projected an almost mesmeric appeal. Just four years before the death of Maria Theresa, economist Adam Smith alluded to the aesthetic value of precious metals in his classic Wealth of Nations:\n\n“The principal merit…arises from their beauty, which renders them peculiarly fit for the ornaments of dress and furniture. As well as being used as ornaments, amulets and mounted in jewelry items, thalers were also the standard for dowry payments,” .\n\nThalers were also sewn into garments as decorative elements. These adornments gave the wearer status, and some ascribed apotropaic [ supposedly having the power to avert evil influences or bad luck] value to them. “The amuletic value of the coins derived from both the effigy of the empress and the brilliant sheen, which some believed attracts the evil eye to the coin and away from the wearer,” says Semple, who adds that, although the MTT was ubiquitous, “there was always a sense of mystery about its origins and the reasons for its being there, and this aura still remains.”\n\nIntrinsic value, aesthetic appeal and the popularity of the MTT as trade or commodity money spurred its diffusion. The Maria Theresa thaler reached the Arabian Peninsula only a decade after it was first coined in Vienna, coming into the hands of coffee merchants in Aden and Mokka who supplied buyers in Austria via Trieste. Greek, Levantine, Turkish, Jewish and Armenian merchants also took thalers on their journeys to trading centers like Cairo, Alexandria, Algiers, Tunis and Tripoli, from where links maintained by Arab merchants extended south across the Sahara and into Arabia, Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. MTTs began to circulate within the Ottoman Empire both as a means of hoarding bullion and as an accepted and semiofficial currency. The Ottoman authorities did not encourage use of the MTT, but their own silver coinage, was generally regarded as inferior. The fact that soldiers and others in Ottoman service received payments in silver by weight rather than by count meant that clipped and damaged coins were still acceptable, and this, as well as shortages of supply, debased the currency. As Ottoman debt piled up, their mints decreased the silver content of the coins: both the central treasury and provincial pashas took in “good” money [coins with a high silver content] melted them down and alloyed them, then minted new coins with the same nominal value but a lower silver content. The acceptability of Turkish specie coins was thus further undermined. By the mid-19th century, the Maria Theresa thaler had become the monetary standard in the Levant, where it remained legal tender until 1960.\n\nMid-19th C merchants’ records reveal money traders in Jiddah dealing in numerous gold and silver coins: French, English and German crowns; pillar, lion, cobb and Mexican dollars; ducatoons, Venetians, Stamboles, rubles, old and new abassees, old Seville estimates, gingelees, zermabobs, zelottas, Pope’s coins and, when all else failed, plain bar silver. Along with the MTT, all were part of the cash piles of local money changers in Jiddah and other Arab ports. In the Hijaz, the traditionally unfavorable trade balance meant that MTTs were exported in large quantities to pay for imported goods. The thalers found their way back to Europe and also to places as far away as Singapore. A British consular report of 1884 describes the movement of thalers:\n\nThe great balance of trade always existing against Jiddah necessitates large remittances of specie to India, Singapore, the Persian Gulf, Egypt and Europe. The total cannot be ascertained, but every steamer takes large amounts in various coins such as Maria Theresa dollars.”\n\nReports from some 50 years earlier reveal that nearly half of the yearly value of merchandise shipped from Jiddah to Suez was made up of MTTs, among jars of perfume oils and quantities of cinnamon, nutmeg, styrax resin, frankincense, gum Arabic, tobacco, ginger, pepper, muslin and shawls.\n\nThe MTT was for this time the most popular coin in the region. It was substantial to hold [which brought it yet another nickname, riyal kabir, the “big riyal”] well-made and always in good supply. The coin’s unusual edging prevented clipping, a technique by which unscrupulous handlers trim and shave silver from coin edges. Why did it spread and become so widely accepted? The reasons are complex. It took hold when Ottoman authority in the region was in decay, coinciding with an intrusion of European powers and a rise in trade, including weapons smuggling by French, Italians and Austrians.\n\nSharp fluctuations in the price of silver in the second half of the 19th century provided windfall profits in trading thalers, in addition to opportunities to move thalers into interior regions where they fetched a premium. After the growth in exports of silver to the Arab world, there was a surge in demand for silver in India. Shipments of bullion and coins via Aden quadrupled from 1850 to 1860. Then the US Civil War halted American cotton exports to Europe, and this led to more trade with Egypt, Sudan and India, paid invariably with thalers.\n\nAt the same time, other events foreshadowed the coin’s eventual demise. Huge silver deposits were discovered in Nevada in 1859, and governments gradually offloaded silver, starting with the British adoption of the gold standard in 1821, followed by other European nations. Furthermore, the second half of the 19th C was an era in which colonial powers reinforced their interests. Part of this involved introducing their own currencies, and this often involved suppressing the MTT. Thus, with British interest in Aden the British Indian administration set the Indian rupee against the MTT, but with only limited success:\n\n“Whenever members of my grandfather’s family traveled abroad, they would send trusted servants from Mukhala to Aden by dhow with chests of thalers to exchange into paper currency, but convenience aside, the thaler was always considered superior. When silver prices were high, it became worthwhile to send the coins to India for their bullion content. When prices fell, then the coins could easily be hoarded by burying them, and there was always internal demand for jewelry and dowry payments.”\n\nIndependence in India in 1947 led to a switch to the British East African shilling in Aden and Hadhramawt. But the MTT still remained popular and accepted as currency into the 1960’s, its silver value recognized particularly in inaccessible regions. Today it is still being used for jewelry in Yemen, Oman and Saudi Arabia, often to satisfy demand from foreigners for locally crafted items. The coin also lingers in the drawers of silversmiths in markets across Arabia and elsewhere in its old territories, ready for a local or a visitor to pick up as a keepsake, a curiosity and sometimes even a collector’s item. An MTT is the perfect souvenir, it’stypically $15 or less, worth almost its weight in silver, and it can be worn as jewelry. It’s a fascinating coin to have.\n\nAdrian Tschoegl’s encounter with the MTT is that of an economic scholar. He is a specialist in international banking and finance who teaches multinational strategy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He used the Maria Theresa thaler to illuminate the general phenomenon of international money in an article for the Eastern Economic Journal (v.27 no.4).\n\n“The MTT provides a fascinating and entertaining anecdote for teachers and students of international finance, money and banking. The MTT was the very first coin I bought. I was in Vienna, and I saw it in a window with the date 1780. I had no idea that as a re-strike thaler it carried a fraudulent date [by today’s standards]. It intrigued me, and with my research into banks and my travels, I became interested in money as a physical entity, as distinct from its theoretical aspects. Whenever I reflected on money, I remembered my MTT. I started to research the coin, and the more I sleuthed and trawled, the more I found,” .\n\nMoney is an amazing invention that took centuries to develop and perfect. The MTT plays a key role in this history, and it would have been even more successful had they come out with half, quarter and double thaler denominations. Although the MTT’s displacement has consigned the coin to obscurity, its transnational concept is, if anything, on the rise in the Arabian Peninsula. For now, the MTT legacy stands out as perhaps the world’s best example of a truly international money, a coin that bore the portrait of a deceased empress of a realm that no longer existed in a denomination long superseded, yet was still universally accepted over vast areas with fluid borders.\n\nPeter Harrigan (harrigan@fastmail.fm) works with Saudi Arabian Airlines in Jiddah, where he is also contributing editor and columnist for Diwaniya, the weekly cultural supplement of the Saudi Gazette.\n\nAs in other civilizations, gold was the primary medium of exchange in the ancient Arab world. But even before regularly issued coins came into use, silver was utilized as a currency. In the Arabian Gulf, for example, a silver ingot called the Larin was introduced in the early centuries. Crafted in the form of a fishhook, with various specimens ranging in length from about one inch to an inch and a half, Larins, which took their name from the town of Lar in southern Persia, were originally circulated in the Arabian Gulf region. Eventually they spread to the eastern seaboard of India and to the Maldive Islands and became one of the chief trading currencies in the Indian Ocean region. Larins have inscriptions in both Persian and Arabic, and to meet the requirements of change, were often cut into pieces; sometimes one Larin was divided into 12 separate sections.\n\nThe East Roman or Byzantine Empire established and operated mints throughout its history [330–1453]. Aside from the main metropolitan mint in the capital, Constantinople, a number of provincial mints were also established in other urban centres, especially during the 6th century. Most provincial mints were closed or lost to invasions by the mid 7th C and Constantinople became the sole mint for gold and silver coinage until the late 11th C, when major provincial mints began to re-appear. The number of mints expanded greatly during the reign of Justinian I [527–565], when as many as fourteen mints were active during his reign, with new mints opened or taken over from the Vandals and Ostrogoths in Ravenna and in smaller provincial centres. Most of these were confined to copper coinage. Ravenna and Carthage alone produced silver coins in quantity, while gold issues were restricted to Thessalonica, and Constantinople.\n\nWith the advent of the Muslim era, in A.D. 622, silver coinage spread throughout the Middle East. Initially, Islamic coins were little more than copies of Byzantine issues, but at the close of the seventh century an ‘Umayyad caliph, ‘Abd alMalik, ordered that a purely Islamic coinage be struck: a gold “dinar” and a silver “dirham,” a term derived from the Greek “drachma,” meaning “silver coin.” These terms, “dinar” and “dirham,” are the generic names of all gold and silver coins in all Muslim countries, despite numerous varieties introduced later and despite the fact that “dinar” later came to include silver coins as well as gold. In striking the first purely Islamic coins, ‘Abd alMalik established principles in accordance with Muslim traditions: no image of any living thing appeared on the Muslim dinars and dirhams. Instead, the markings were geometric and calligraphic rather than pictorial, and frequently, as with all the Islamic decorative arts bore the intertwined geometrical patterns called arabesque, and phrases from the Koran. One dirham, for example, minted in Damascus during al Malik’s reign, is inscribed: “In the name of God this dirham was struck in Damascus in the year 79,” that is, in A.D. 698.\n\nThis historical record is particularly important during the long period when the Ottomans ruled the Muslim world. For although the Ottomans, in the early years of their rule, inscribed their coins in the traditions of the other dynasties of Muslim history, the Sultans, starting in the 15th century, began to add their own names, the place of mintage and, frequently, the date. As the Ottoman Empire endured nearly five centuries, the coins provide a fine record of the Sultans from the time the Ottomans first established an organized coinage throughout their expanding empire.\n\nWith the demise of the Seljuk Sultanate Anatolia was divided into a patchwork of independent states, the so-called Anatolian Beyliks. By 1300, a weakened Byzantine Empire had lost most of its Anatolian provinces to these Turkish principalities. One of the beyliks was led by Osman I , from which the name Ottoman is derived, around Eskişehir in western Anatolia. During his reign as Sultan, Osman I extended the frontiers of Turkish settlement toward the edge of the Byzantine Empire. In this period, a formal Ottoman government was created whose institutions would change drastically over the life of the empire.\n\nBy the beginning of the 14th C Osman’s beylik extended the frontiers of the Ottoman settlements by raiding Byzantine territories and after moving the capital of the state to Bursa in 1326 the foundation of the new dominant state was complete. In 1327 Osman’s son, Orhan bey made arrangements to mint the first Ottoman silver coin, the “akce”. Coins circulated before that time were Seljuk dirhams, Indian, Persian, Arab and Byzantine coins as well as some European currency like Venice ducats which were explained by the commercial needs and geographical location of Anatolia as trade commodities from India, China, Iran were delivered to the Anatolian ports and then were transported to Byzantine Empire and many European countries.\n\nMehmed II [known as al Fatih or the Conqueror] was only 12 years old when his father, Murad II, abdicated to pursue a life of religious contemplation [following Sufi mysticism] and appointed him sultan in 1444; and 8 years later Mehmed was only in his early 20s when he launched the successful siege of Constantinople, the Byzantine capital that the Ottomans had previously failed to conquer. In a siege that lasted over 50 days, the Ottomans broke through the city walls and met with little resistance from the inhabitants, who had vainly hoped for outside reinforcements. Mehmed made Istanbul a major entrepôt and center of learning and culture. He established new schools, hospitals, caravanserai, and soup kitchens. He saw himself as the heir to the Roman Empire and viewed his empire as the guardian of Islam, whose duty it was to protect Muslims everywhere. Islam was the source of legality of his new great empire. Under Mehmed, the empire developed a centralized administration; the janissary corps was enlarged while the many religious and ethnic minorities within the empire were treated with leniency and fairness. Mehmed also encouraged skilled artisans and intellectuals escaping Muslim Spain after it fell to the Reconquista to settle in Istanbul. He granted monopolies over the sale of basic necessities to private individuals and used these revenues to bolster the Ottoman treasury.\n\nWell educated, Mehmed spoke numerous languages and was interested in the study of military tactics, especially the exploits of Alexander the Great. Unusually for a Muslim leader who generally eschewed physical representations, he hired the famed Venetian artist Gentile Bellini to paint his portrait. Under Mehmed, the Ottomans dominated all of the Balkans to the Danube River and all of Anatolia, but he failed to defeat the Mamluks in Syria. Mehmed died preparing for a campaign to take the island of Rhodes and southern Italy. According to the historian Colin Heywood, “there is substantial circumstantial evidence that Mehmed was poisoned, possibly at the behest of his eldest son and successor, Bayezid.”\n\nUntil Mehmed II came in to power the monetary system of the Ottoman state was based on the silver standard unit at a fixed weight of silver. Only in 1453 after the conquest of Constantinople and establishment of the new capital which soon became the political, economic and cultural centre of Ottoman Empire, Mehmed minted the first Turkish golden coin – “altin”. This event signified the milestone in the monetary history, transition from silver standard to bimetallism.\n\nAccording to historical sources, 15th C was characterised by the significant decline of the weight of silver coin in the Ottoman Empire that has faced the problem of debasement of coinage which reached its apogee in the middle of the 16th C. Debasement was done by public by cutting or scraping off some of the precious metal, consequently, the value of akce gradually decreased over time, causing the inflation. Debasement and shaving off the silver coins finally was one of the reasons of the fact that in 17-18th C new coins as a standard of currency were adopted: the silver coin “kurus” [piaster that over time completely replaced akce. Meanwhile, huge sultanate court maintenance costs, series of devastating wars, which caused significant rise of military expenditures, led to the budget deficits, fiscal difficulties and economic stagnation of the Empire. Government’s efforts to stabilize the monetary system were futile and ambiguous: struggling with the coin debasement mint authorities tried to withdraw debased species from the circulation, melt them down and replace with new golden coins after enhancing their gold content.\n\nThe silver akçe continued to be used until the 17th C when the first Ottoman gold coin appeared during the reign of Sultan Mehmed in 1478. Copper was first minted in the reign of Murad I from 1359 to 1389 and was intended for use as change for the silver akçe. Mints were set up in places like Diyarbakır, Van and Baghdad with considerable care paid to the sources of gold and silver and careful oversight was undertaken to ensure that the coins were not debased. Inspectors were regularly sent to see that everything was in order and if anyone was caught, they were dismissed from their positions and sent to Istanbul where they would most likely be executed.\n\nThroughout much of the first half of the Empire, Ottoman coins competed with foreign currencies such as Venetian gold pieces, Egyptian pare and in some areas controlled by the Ottomans such as the Crimea and Wallachia, local currencies met the needs of the populace. Over time and due to numerous wars in which Empire was engaged, the Ottomans became unable to meet its financial obligations and was forced to debase its currency.\n\nThe sultan’s income\n\nThe sultan had his own privy purse and for much of the Empire’s existence, his income came from a share in the booty obtained in war, the collection of taxes in the territories north of the Danube and from places like Diyarbakir, Baghdad and Crete. The high level officials of the Empire and members of the imperial dynasty were not salaried in the way we understand things today. They would be assigned the revenue of various estates or villages and these would return to the treasury when they left their positions or died. Where the harem women were concerned, the sources of their income and even their jewelry returned to the sultan’s privy purse, as it was he who had granted these in the first place. The Janissary corps were treated separately throughout the Empire. The amount of money each was to receive would be weighed and sealed in a bag by the grand vizier before they were handed out.\n\nThe mint in Novo Brdo, a fortified mining town in the Serbian Despotate rich with gold and silver mines, began to strike akçe in 1441 when it was captured by the Ottoman forces for the first time. The Suleiman Mosque in Istanbul is said to have cost 59 million akçe when it was constructed in the 1550s. This amount equalled 700,000 ducats in Venetian gold . The kuruş was introduced in 1688. It was initially a large, silver coin, approximately equal to the French écu, or, from other sources, to the Spanish dollar. However, during the 18th Century debasement reduced the kuruş to a billon coin [an alloy of a precious metal with a majority base metal content [such as copper] used chiefly for making coins, medals, and token coins] weighing less than 3 grams.\n\nThe Ottoman sultani, or sherifi as it was also called, which had remained close to the standards of the Venetian ducat since the fifteenth century was discontinued late in the seventeenth century. In the early part of the eighteenth century, as gold made a comeback in Europe and elsewhere, Ottoman minting activity also resumed. In the place of the sultani, a number of new gold coins called tughrali, cedid Istanbul, zincirli, findik and zer-i mahbub were initiated between 1697 and 1728. All but the last of these started close to the standards of the ducat. Following the practice dating back to the fifteenth century, the government did not attach a fixed face value to these gold coins. Their exchange rates were determined by the markets. In payments to the state, gold coins were accepted at the official rates of exchange.\n\nThe 17th century had been a period of instability for the Ottoman currency culminating around the middle of the century in the closure of Ottoman mints, the cessation of the production of silver akçe and their use as a means of exchange. The decline of the akçe posed serious challenges to the Ottoman administration. Without control over the currency, its control over the economy diminished considerably. Moreover, the disintegration of the monetary system and the increasing reliance on foreign coins had serious political implications. During the second half of the 17th century the government thus made numerous attempts at establishing a new currency but these proved to be unsuccessful due to the continuation of wars and fiscal difficulties. After a long interval of inactivity, the mint in Istanbul resumed operations in 1685, producing the small akçe and the copper mangir beginning in 1689. The government then renewed its efforts to establish a new system around a large silver unit modelled after the European coins circulating in the Ottoman markets since the middle of the 16th century.\n\nThe first large silver coins were minted in 1690 after the Polish coin zolota which was imported in large quantities by Dutch merchants during the seventeenth century. Later, in 1703, an even larger coin weighing approximately 8 dirhams, and its fractions were also minted. Only after larger silver coins began to be minted in the early decades of the 18th C was the new monetary scale clearly established. The new Ottoman kuruş was then fixed at 120 akçe or 40 paras. The early kuruşlar weighed six and a quarter dirhams (20.0 grams) and contained close to 60 percent silver. The zolotas were valued at three fourths of the kuruş or at 90 akçe. Due to wars and continuing political turmoil, however, many coins were minted with sub-standard silver content until the monetary reform of 1715-16. The appearance of sub-standard coinage attracted large numbers of counterfeiters until the 1720’s.\n\nOttoman bureaucratic and military expenditure was raised by taxation, generally from the agrarian population. Although there was monetary regulation, enforcement was often relaxed and little effort was made to control the activities of merchants, moneychangers, and financiers. During the “price revolution” of the 16th century, when inflation took off, there were price increases of around 500 percent from the end of the 15th century to the close of the 17th .\n\nBetween 1854 and 1881, the Ottoman Empire went through a critical phase of the history. Beginning with the first foreign loan in 1854, this process involved sporadic attempts by western powers to impose some control. From 1863 a second and more intense phase began leading to a snowballing effect of accumulated debts, so by 1875, with external debt at 242 million Turkish pounds, over half the budgetary expenditures going toward its service, the Ottoman government, facing a number of economic crises, declared its inability to make repayments. The fall in tax revenues due to bad harvests and increased expenditure made worse by the costs of suppressing the uprisings in the Balkans hastened the slide into bankruptcy. After negotiations with the European powers, the Public Debt Administration was set up, to which certain revenues were assigned. This arrangement subjected the Ottomans to foreign financial control from which they failed to free themselves, in part because of continued borrowing. In 1914, the Ottoman debt stood at 139.1 million Turkish pounds, and the government was still dependent on European financiers.\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, silver coins were in circulation for 1 akçe, 1, 5, 10 and 20 para, 1, 2 and 2½ kuruş, together with gold coins denominated in zeri mahbub and altin. As the silver coins were debased, other denominations appeared. The final coinage issued before the currency reform consisted of billon 1, para, and silver kuruş. In 1844, the Turkish gold lira was introduced as the new standard denomination. It was divided into 100 silver kuruş and the kuruş continued to circulate until the 1970s. Kuruş eventually became obsolete due to inflation the late 1970s. A currency reform on 1 January 2005 provided its return as the 1/100th of the new lira.\n\nFirst Turkish lira\n\nIn 1922/23, a new coinage was introduced consisting of aluminium-bronze 2.5, 5 and 10 kuruş and nickel 25 kuruş continuing until 1928. These were the last Turkish coins to bear inscriptions in the Arabic script. In 1934, silver 1 lira coins were struck, followed the next year by a new coinage consisting of cupro-nickel kuruş, and silver 25 and 50 kuruş and 1 Turkish lira. Aluminium-bronze kuruş coins were issued between 1940 and 1942, the last coins to bear this denomination. Nickel-brass replaced silver in the 25 kuruş in 1944, with brass kuruş introduced between 1947 and 1949. The silver 50 kuruş and 1 Turkish lira were discontinued in 1948, with cupro-nickel 1 Turkish lira issued in 1957. Between 1958 and 1963, bronze kuruş and steel 25 kuruş, 1 and 2½ Turkish lira were introduced, followed by steel 50 kuruş and 5 Turkish lira in 1971 and 1974, respectively. Aluminium replaced bronze in 1975. These coins were issued up to 1980. In 1981, with inflation gaining pace, aluminium Turkish lira coins were introduced.\n\nSecond Turkish lira 2005–2008\n\nIn the transitional period between 2005 and 2008, the second Turkish lira was officially called “new Turkish lira” in Turkey. All coins show portraits of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. To the dismay of the European Central Bank, the sizes and compositions of the 50 new kuruş and 1 new Turkish lira coins clearly resemble those of the €1 and €2 coins respectively. It caused trouble to businesses using vending machines [particularly at airports] in the eurozone since a number of vending machines at the time accepted the 1 new Turkish lira coin as a €2 coin. Since €2 is worth roughly four times more, vending machines affected had to be upgraded at the expense of their owners.\n\nFrom 1 January 2009, the “new” was removed from the second Turkish lira, its official name in Turkey becoming just “Turkish lira” again; new coins without the word “yeni” were introduced. Also, the inner and outer alloys of the 50 kuruş and 1 Turkish lira coins were reversed.\n\nGhana\n\nThe earliest of the kingdoms of the western Sudan was Ghana [not to be confused with the modern state of the same name], arose on the upper Niger during the 4th century as a loose federation of village states, inhabited by Soninke farmers. According to unconfirmed legends, it was first ruled by a Berber dynasty, which was overthrown about A.D. 700, when Kaya Maghau led his kinsmen in an uprising, killed the last white ruler, and established a Soninke dynasty.\n\nGhana reached its peak in the 11th century with wealth derived partially from its efficient irrigation agriculture, but the gold trade was an even more significant factor. The king claimed every gold nugget coming into the country, leaving ordinary citizens the right to buy and sell only gold dust. Taxes were levied on the many goods crossing Ghana’s borders. The commercial emphasis is evident in al-Bakri’s description of the capital, Kumbi-Saleh, really two towns, one occupied by the king and his retinue and the other by foreign merchants. Even the merchants’ town had twelve mosques, two-storied stone houses, and public squares. Ghana’s decline and eclipse in the early 13th century was ended by the uprising of a petty vassal, who was later overthrown by Sundiata, founder of Mali.\n\nMali\n\nSundiata was the son of Naré Maghann Konaté and Sogolon Condé, the daughter of the “buffalo woman”, so called because of her ugliness and hunchback. He was crippled from childhood and his mother was the subject of ridicule among her co-wives. She was constantly teased and ridiculed openly for her son’s disability. It was during his reign that Mali first began to gain fame as well as economic strength, due to control of the region’s trade routes and gold fields. The social and political constitution of Mali were first codified during the reign of Sundiata, they were part of the social and political norms of Mali and many of these laws have been incorporated into the constitution of modern-day Mali.\n\n“By unifying the military force of 12 states, Sundiata becomes an emperor known as the Lion King of Mali, who controls tribes from the Niger River west to the Atlantic Ocean. Walt Disney Studios reprised the story of Sundiata in 1994 as an animated film, The Lion King, with animals substituting for the humans of Mali legend.” Ellen Snodgrass\n\nSundiata Keita was not merely a conqueror who was able to rule over a large empire with different tribes and languages, but also developed Mali’s mechanisms for agriculture, and is reported to have introduced cotton and weaving in Mali.Towards the end of his reign, “absolute security” is reported to have “prevailed throughout his dominion.”\n\nAfter defeating and killing the tyrant who had subjugated his kinsmen and murdered his brothers, Sundiata took over Ghana and gained control of the desert gold trade. Sundiata’s immediate descendants converted to Islam, which aided their further conquests, until by the fourteenth century, Malian kings ruled over more than forty million people and 400 towns in the entire Sudan-Sahel region of West Africa, which stretched from beyond the upper Niger to the Atlantic.\n\nThe kingdom was at the height of its power and prosperity during the reign of Musa Keita I [c. 1280 – c. 1337] who was the tenth sultan or emperor of the wealthy West African Mali Empire. Musa held many titles, including Emir of Melle, Lord of Wangara, Conqueror of Ghanata, and at l"
