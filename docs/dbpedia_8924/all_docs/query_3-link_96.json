        "text": "I wanted to share with you my family experiences of the race riots. My children were watching the Olympics, they are mixed heritage and were being inspired by the wonderful athletes when the news came on and they watched a little bit. They took time to process, they are all under 10. Today they asked questions as we drove in our car. They asked me if anyone was going to stop us and pull them out of the car because they are brown and beat them up. They were worried. I explained it to them in an age-appropriate way, not shying away from the complexity, not shying away from a discussion on racism. I also asked them to do what they can control and made them feel in control of the situation. Coaching them with things to say if someone is unkind. Letting them know that I would protect them and stand up for them and that I would keep them safe. If you work in education, please plan for the beginning of term for supportive pastoral care, ask experts to support your children in school - experts who have lived experience, who have a deep experience of racism and how to feel empowered. Because children are scared, plan your pastoral sessions for age-appropriate discussions which explicitly support belonging and safety. There are charities who have prepared resources, use them. If you are in a school that isn't multi-cultural and you think it doesn't apply to your setting. It does. Address the reality of racism in society. Please don't shy away from difficult conversations, because they are needed. Please help children understand what is happening in a child-friendly way and support them to move forward to move towards a better society, because it is needed now more than ever. #Education\n\nN° 230 | Austria 1 Vereinsthaler 1868 3rd German Shooting Festival https://lnkd.in/dTEswmgv X# M8, Dav. 28, N# 18980; Silver; Franz Joseph I; 3rd German Shooting Festival in Vienna; UNC with minor hairlines and multicolor toning The Austria 1 Vereinsthaler 1868 coin commemorates the 3rd German Shooting Festival held in Vienna during the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I.

Additionally, the final ranking was completely based on audience votes; who have clearly been mesmerized by Bada Lee. Therefore, Bada Lee’s popularity did have a lot to do with their win. However, this does not undermine their talent or shadow their success as SWF2 is a show which decides winners based on public choices. Winning your audiences’ hearts through street dancing is the major concept of the show and BEBE has proven their efficiency in that. Keeping that in mind, what I find even more fascinating is that if the weightage of Live Broadcast voting (limited to Korea) and the Global votes were reversed then Jam Republic would have been the winning crew. #StreetWomanFighter2 #Korean #Impression #Mnet #BEBE #BadaLee https://lnkd.in/dhh3k5e8"
