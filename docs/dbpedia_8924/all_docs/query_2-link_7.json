        "text": "German Empire may also refer to Holy Roman Empire.\n\nGerman Empire refers to the following united German nation states:\n\nSecond German Empire[]\n\nThe German Empire (German: Deutsches Reich or Deutsches Kaiserreich) also referred to as the Second German Empire or Imperial Germany, was the first united German nation state that existed from unification in 1871 until the end of the first World War in 1918.\n\nIt was founded on 1 January 1871 when the south German states, except for Austria, joined the North German Confederation and the new constitution came into force, changing the name, and establishing a more centralized government, which introduced the title of German Emperor for Wilhelm I, King of Prussia from the House of Hohenzollern. Berlin remained its capital, and Bismarck, Minister-President of Prussia became Chancellor, the head of government. As these events occurred, the Prussian-led North German Confederation and its southern German allies were still engaged in the Franco-Prussian War.\n\nPolitics[]\n\nThe second German Constitution, adopted by the parliament on 14 April 1871 and proclaimed by the Emperor on 16 April, was substantially based upon Bismarck's North German Constitution. The political system remained the same. The empire had a parliament called the Reichstag, which was elected by male citizen.\n\nLegislation also required the consent of the Bundesrat, the federal council of deputies from all 27 states.\n\nExecutive power was held by the emperor, who was assisted by the Chancellor. The emperor was given extensive powers by the constitution, he alone, for example, appointed and dismissed the chancellor (in practice letting the emperor rule the country through a puppet), he also acted as the supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and could also disband the Reichstag to call for new elections. The Reichstag had the power to pass, amend, or reject bills and to initiate legislation. However, as mentioned above, in practice the real power was vested in the emperor, who exercised it through his chancellor.\n\nSubdivisions[]\n\nThe German Empire consisted of 26 states, most of them ruled by royal families.\n\nWhich included four kingdoms, six grand duchies, five duchies (six before 1876), seven principalities, three free Hanseatic cities, and one imperial territory. Although Prussia was one of several kingdoms in the realm,\n\nit contained about two thirds of Germany's population and territory. Prussian dominance had also been established constitutionally.\n\nDemocracy[]\n\nThe second German Empire was a parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy, meaning that the empire had an elected parliament, the Reichstag. Every male citizen who was at least 25 years of age was allowed to vote in parliamentary elections, which took place every 5 years. The first ever parliamentary election in 1871, had over 15 parties taking part in the election, the party with the most votes ended up being the National Liberal Party (German: Nationalliberale Partei) with about 1,171,000 votes or 30.1%.\n\nWars[]\n\nThe first war the German Empire was ever engaged in was the Franco-Prussian War, since Germany united during the war, it automatically participated. The war resulted in a German victory and lead to the annexation of Alsace-Lorraine (German: Elsa√ü-Lothringen), which was granted the special status of \"Imperial territory\" instead of becoming a state.\n\nThe Second German Empire was most notably involved in the first World War, which it lost. This defeat then lead to the abolition of the monarchy, as the emperor was sent into exile in the Netherlands. As well as the loss of all German colonies, significant chunks of land, and the creation of the Weimar Republic, which meant the end for the government of the first united German State.\n\nWeimar Republic[]\n\nGermany"
