        "text": "well....if you like eagles you'll probably like these two. The first `eagle has two heads.\n\nThey are both from Frankfurt. The first is interesting to me in that it was issued in 1622 and bears the titles of Ferdinand II as Holy Roman Emperor around the imperial two headed eagle (reverse). If you look closely the Franfurt eagle is at the centre (obverse) and the legend reads `New money of the Republic of Frankfurt 1622' (ie Moneta Nova Reip. Francofurtensis 1622). Two eagles, one of which has two heads\n\nThe second is indeed a zwei (two ) thaler. Although I truly love the coin, and the design, at times I think the eagle on the reverse looks more like a throttled chicken than anything else."
