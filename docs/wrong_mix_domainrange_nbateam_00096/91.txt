* As much as it pains me to admit it, I agree with Ratto here. Monta Ellis, on a 12-27 team that hasn’t had an All-Star representative in eons, probably won’t be making the All-Star team.

My current first 12 for the West All-Star team: Kobe Bryant, Chris Paul, Steve Nash, Brandon Roy, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony, Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Ron Artest, Amare Stoudemire (voted in as starting center), Deron Williams and Pau Gasol. Next: Manu Ginobili, Andrew Bynum and then Ellis, as No. 15. They take 12 players.

* Don Nelson, Stephen Curry and Andris Biedrins transcripts below…

At his locker a half-hour after the game, Andris Biedrins was still steaming about his missed free throws, so he didn’t feel a whole helluva lot like celebrating yesterday afternoon.

But he acknowledged there was reason to feel good.

Biedrins had, by far, his best game of the season in the Warriors’ matinee victory over the Bulls, racking up 19 rebounds and blocking a career-high 8 shots (6 in the first half) in 39 minutes.

This was his 10th game since returning from a back/abdominal-muscle injury. The first seven were dismal, but Biedrins started to show life in the two games previous to this one.

Then today, he scored the Warriors’ second basket of the game on the low post, blocked three shots in the first quarter, and everything took off from there.

Joakim Noah? Don’t even try to shoot when Biedrins is nearby, OK?

(FYI: Biedrins was a game-best +23 in the plus/minus.)

Chicago is the fourth-worst shooting team in the league (43.8% on the season), but the Warriors held them to 36.5%, which is good vs. anybody.

And hey, Biedrins, who was 0 for 7 before today, made his first free throw of the season!

OK, he also missed 6 others, none of them looking like they had a scintilla of a chance to go in.

Biedrins said he changed his form when he was playing with the Latvian national team this summer, and he has to go back to the form that, at the very least, had him at 55.1% last season.

Right now, he’s 1 for 14–that’s 7.1%.

His worst full FT-shooting season came in 2005-06, his 2nd as a Warrior, when he shot 30.6%.

* One more thing before I get to the transcripts: Since I criticize Curry a lot for his (lack of) defense, I have to praise him for his performance against Derrick Rose today.

I thought Rose (-20 in the plus/minus) was awful. Just terrible. Shot 7 for 19, turned it over 4 times, only 4 assists.

So Curry deserves some credit for that–he played Rose’s drive, got in front of him, got help from Biedrins in the lane, and harried Rose’s attempts to pass.

In 43 minutes, Curry scored 26 points (on 9 of 18 shooting), grabbed 10 rebounds and 6 assists. Only trouble spot: 5 turnovers.

And oh: Monta Ellis took 39 shots to get 36 points. My goodness. Most shots attempted by a Warrior since Rick Barry took 39 in February 1975.

Maybe this means the Warriors are going to win the championship?

(John Salmons, Ellis’ match-up, scored 25 points on 17 FGAs. This is why Ellis is probably not making the All-Star team.)

To the transcripts…

—–DON NELSON/

-Intro: Well, the Golden State D-Leaguers got a win. How about that? And both those guys, they didn’t shoot the ball very well. They actually both can do that. But they did rebound and they guarded. I was very pleased with both of them and both of them were factors in the win.

Of course we had most of the scoring load shared with three guys. But nothing wrong with that. And everybody else chipped in and did their thing.

And finally Goose had a Biedrins game. That was good to see even though the free throw did him in again. But the other game was there—blocks and presence on the court defensively. We were pretty good defensively. Both those D-Leaguers had a hand in that.

So here we are, limited. Just about 7 and a half players, but we found a way. That’s good. As you guys know, we’ve actually been playing decently. Usually have had pretty good first halves and then the third quarter has been a problem for us. But tonight we won the third quarter and we had a big fourth quarter. So a very good game for us.

-Q: How much better are you when Biedrins is that active?

-NELSON: We’re better when we have other guys who pursue the ball as well, so he doesn’t get 19 rebounds every game. He did tonight.

But I think the other guys ganged in there and actually, look, the D-Leaguers got 17 rebounds between them. The two new guys got 17 rebounds, so they really helped in that area so they could lay a second body on him.

A lot of teams are taking a player and just running him into Goose so he doesn’t go to the offensive glass and they don’t even bother with our other guys because we’re not great rebounders. But rebounding is an important part of the game.

-Q: You played Biedrins 39 minutes. Was that the plan or was he playing so well that you just kept him out there?

-NELSON: Yeah, he’s letting me play him finally. I’ve been trying to nurse him along and he hasn’t been a dominant player until tonight. I’ve been a little careful. I’ve had to try to coach the score and make sure if he wasn’t playing well, wasn’t rebounding, wasn’t doing the things we’re used to, that we’d still have a chance to win.

Tonight he did… I wanted him in there 48 minutes if I could have.

-Q: What’s going on with his free throws?

-NELSON: I keep telling him, you know, I brought Rick Barry in here when I first arrived and I was trying to get him to change. Because he’s got… I mean, that free throw doesn’t have much chance. I know it, you know it and he probably knows it.

Rick spent an hour with him and he decided he didn’t want to do the underhand free throw. I thought that was the one chance. Because anything over his head, he’s just so fundamentally unsound… we’ve worked with him and tried to show him.

But he basically can’t change that. It’s his wrist, it’s his motion, arc… and he chooses not to change his free throw. I even talked to him about the one-hand free throw, which I shot, which I think helps some players overcome that problem.

But right before he shoots, he tips his hand this way… little bit like Shaq… so he can’t hold it in one hand. He tries to flip it. That isn’t going to work. But I thought the underhand free throw had a chance.

I keep threatening to bring Rick Barry back. That normally scares him into… at least gets him to the free-throw line shooting extra free throws.

He was a little concerned and so was I that they were going to foul him when they were in the bonus. And I wasn’t paying attention in the fourth quarter, they fouled him on purpose, they weren’t in the bonus… I subbed him immediately, well they must be in the bonus. But they weren’t.

I told him that as soon as they’re in the bonus I’ll take you out to make sure they don’t embarrass you.

-Q: Monta Ellis now has taken 70 shots in the last two games, is that what you want?

-NELSON: I thought he took some bad shots and some early shots that we wish we had over. But he’s my star player, what can I tell you? I give him his head. You know, the guy’s trying to win games. He’s trying to do the right thing and I thought he really played a good solid game tonight. It wasn’t one of his best games.

But it’s hard to get 25 shots up in an NBA game, let alone 39. He didn’t shoot a good percentage, but down the stretch… I think he made two points in the third quarter and we just played a two-man game the whole fourth quarter and they haven’t stopped it yet. So I wore that one out.

I don’t know what to tell you. I like him when he moves the ball a little bit more, knows where our shooters are. We talked to him about that. But he… excluding the jump shot, which you’re probably talking about, the early long jump shot, he goes so fast in the paint that I’m not sure that he really can see players.

A lot of the great players, they go slow through the paint where their vision is clear. It must be like a blur to him and then he focuses on the rim. He made some passes tonight. He had a number of assists and very few turnovers.

But not many Warriors, other than Wilt probably, have shot 39 times in an NBA game. You have to look that one up. I’d like to know the answer myself.

-Q: Any secret to Curry’s defensive success against Derrick Rose?

-NELSON: Oh, he’s been terrific defensively for the last month. He’s turned into quite a defender, actually. Not very good when he first arrived, but man, he’s worked hard at it. He follows our gameplan… pretty darn defensive point guard right now.

-Q: How has Curry progressed this year?

-NELSON: Well, he was always good. That’s the reason I started him. He’s really talented. Then he had to kind of learn his way to become a point guard.

Tonight I actually played Monta more at the point guard and him at the two, because they were denying Monta on his catches. It was easier if he just brought the ball up and ran the point, which left Curry as the two-guard and he makes open shots. He’s used to playing that role.

But his progress has been steady. I think he’s made the most progress on the defensive end of the floor. His numbers are really good. He’s small but he’s just tough enough that he gets a lot of steals and rebounds. He gets more rebounds than you would think.

And he’s turned into be… I don’t know if you’d call Evans a point guard or not… other than that, I don’t know any rookie points guards better than him, that I’ve seen. I know Jennings is really good. They’re both really good. But true point guard, understanding the defensive concepts… total package. He’s quite a point guard.

——STEPHEN CURRY/

-Q: How much did energy play a part in this win?

-CURRY: It was huge. That’s one of the things, the keys to the game that our coach told us before… Just to match their energy. Because they have a lot of high-energy players that make plays and they’re relentless on the boards and in transition. Even though we had eight players, that was the reason we were in the game at halftime and the reason we pulled it out in the end.

-Q: You held a team under 100 points…

-CURRY: It’s huge for us. Sticking to the gameplan and like I said, effort is all it was, really. I think we did it the last game for a half, but couldn’t finish it up in the second half. Tonight we made that big run in the third quarter, got the lead, got control and we were able to focus on defense and knew if we got stops we were going to win.

-Q: What was your focus vs. Rose?

-CURRY: Relying on Goose—Andris—to help me and hedge out really hard and make him change directions and I was going to play real low to the basket and make him shoot the jumper. I know he can hit it, but he’s much more efficient getting to the basket. Just cutting him off in the lane and making him shoot jumpshots.

-Q: Looked like you were playing the pass.

-CURRY: That, too. I’ve tried to do that the last couple games, actually. Just try to anticipate the play and as soon as I see the guard pick the ball up, try to read his eyes, get in the passing lane and make the play.

I got a big one in the fourth quarter. That’s something I’m trying to do now.

-Q: How much different is it when you know you have Biedrins back there blocking shots like that?

-CURRY: It’s huge. He’s getting blocks, rebounds for us, those extra possessions that we need to make runs. He’s allowing us to do that. Just having his presence on ball-screens, pretty much anywhere on defense, really. He’s always there to back us up and get those rebounds and we can push. That’s what we’re best at.

-Q: Could you see Biedrins’ energy level was up early?

-CURRY: Definitely. He got a post-up, with his back to the basket, he got a score and he got his confidence back and then it was just a snow-ball effect to his overall game. It was a huge performance for us.

—–BIEDRINS/

-Q: I imagine that game felt pretty good for you from the get-go, you had a couple early blocked shots, a post-up…

-BIEDRINS: I was feeling pretty well, especially in the beginning. Like you said, there were a couple good things… could put more energy into it. Blocked shots, scored some points, made me feel better.

-Q: Has it been tough for the last weeks?

-BIEDRINS: Yeah, a little bit. This probably was my best game since I’ve been back. Feels better than before.

-Q: What was different?

-BIEDRINS: I don’t know. I just physically feel better and better every game, with more energy, can stay on the court longer, I don’t get as tired.

-Q: Did you need a game like this?

-BIEDRINS: Of course. I was waiting for a game like this… a couple games ago… it feels good. Fnally, I’m getting to where I was before and where I want to be.

-Q: 39 minutes is a lot. Did you feel tired?

-BIEDRINS: Maybe at some points. But it wasn’t so bad. There were a lot of timeouts, coach took me out, put me back in.

-Q: Were you getting tired in earlier games?

-BIEDRINS: Yeah, it was. Like I said, I didn’t play five on five for a long time. It was just kind of exhausting before.

-Q: What’s going on with the free throws? Is it the same thing every time?

-BIEDRINS: I don’t know. I’ve really lost confidence on the free-throw line. I guess I changed a little bit in the summer time. I was shooting how I shot last season. Then I went back to the national team and I changed a couple things. That was the wrong thing, what I did.

I should go back to like I was shooting last year. It was a little bit different—different stance and different timing. It’s just a little hard on me right now.

-Q: Does it make it tough to attack the rim when you’re shooting free throws like this?

-BIEDRINS: Yeah, it’s really frustrating. That’s why at the end of the game I was really own on myself. Because I was so pissed off I couldn’t make those shots. But at the same time I didn’t want it to affect my game on the defensive end.

-Q: What did you think of the Hack-a-Biedrins?

-BIEDRINS: I mean, it’s hard. It’s really hard. It’s really frustrating. I remember this same thing happened three years ago, I think. And it was really frustrating.

I’ll do anything to get it back to at least how I shot it last year, close to 60%. At least I’ll be confident in myself if I go to the foul line.

-Q: Did you like it when the crowd supported you at the line?

-BIEDRINS: The crowd, yeah… Our home crowd is always going to be cheering. It’s a great feeling.

-Q: Are you back?

-BIEDRINS: I wouldn’t say 100%. But I’m right there. 90, 95.

-Q: Cartier Martin and Tolliver looked like they definitely upped the energy level for you guys…

-BIEDRINS: It was great. They really helped us out. I think they were a big part of our win tonight. Because they came out, they’ll give you 100% and they’ll do anything they can. Everything. They gave really big effort.
