        "text": "After a slow start to the NBA Summer League for Marcus Domask, his future in the basketball world is up in the air.\n\nDomask’s impressive 2023-24 campaign, highlighted of course by helping lead Illinois to the Elite 8, earned him an Exhibit-10 contract with the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThese Exhibit-10 deals are used by NBA teams looking to take a flier on undrafted free agents, giving them an opportunity to showcase their skills during training camp and Summer League. If the team likes what they see, they have the option to turn this contract into a G-League, two-way, or NBA deal.\n\nThat being said, Domask’s first couple of Summer League games left a lot to be desired and may point to him not being signed by the Bulls or any team for that matter, which I think would be a big mistake.\n\nI could understand if NBA teams and their G-League affiliates might be hesitant to hold up a roster spot for a 24-year-old rookie that isn’t a freak athlete.\n\nDomask isn’t going to be able to instantly come onto an NBA team and be able to throw down windmill dunks or guard a team’s best player.\n\nHe’s not going to get an NBA contract or a two-way deal, but I believe that Marcus Domask deserves a shot at a G-League contract somewhere.\n\nYeah, yeah, I get it. I know what all the critics are going to say.\n\nHe’s played only 17 minutes across two Summer League games and was admittedly a virtual non-factor on the offensive end, despite being known for his scoring and play-making capabilities in college.\n\nThat’s certainly true, I can’t deny that.\n\nBut, we have witnessed what Domask can do on the basketball court, he can be an extremely dynamic player. Even though he may not be NBA-bound just yet, I do think that he is capable of having a successful pro basketball career.\n\nDomask’s 6-foot-6 and 215-pound frame allows him to play several positions, something that provides a lot of value in today’s game. He does a really good job at playing at his own pace, slowing the defense down and letting the game come to him.\n\nProfessional basketball as a whole is a different beast from college, the NBA being the toughest stage of it all. Success doesn’t come easy, but those traits listed above will elevate Domask as a prospect and make him stand out.\n\nIf he gets a chance in the G-League or even goes to play overseas, these are elements of his game that would shine through and help him ball out.\n\nWith two more Summer League games left this week, Domask has time to reverse the narrative surrounding him and rise the prospect ranks. But no matter what happens in these next few days, hope is not lost on his professional career."
