        "text": "Golden State considered trading the big man during June’s draft. Instead, they opted to trust in a mental and physical rehabilitation plan designed to rediscover the automatic double-double guy of years past. “There were serious talks, because I think some in the Warriors’ front office were compelled to move him,” Duffy said. “Others wanted to stick with him, because, when you look around, what are you trading for? If he puts everything together, he’s probably a top-eight center. Are you going to get back that value?”\n\nAndris Biedrins’ agent said Saturday that conflicting reports of the Warriors’ center signing with different European teams were erroneous, but Biedrins will explore overseas options next month. “I think (Biedrins) would be open to playing overseas on a temporary or a long-term basis if the (NBA) lockout continues, but we’ve got to get him some insurance to protect his (NBA) contract,” agent Bill Duffy said. “He’s on a training regimen, and he usually takes it to another level at this time. In 20 to 30 days, he’ll be 100 percent conditioned.”\n\nAndris Biedrins’ agent said Saturday that reports on the Warriors’ center signing with different European teams were erroneous, but that Biedrins will explore overseas options next month. “I think (Biedrins) would be open to playing overseas on a temporary or a long-term basis if the (NBA) lockout continues, but we’ve got to get him some insurance to protect his (NBA) contract,” Bill Duffy said. “He’s on a training regimen, and he usually takes it to another level at this time.
