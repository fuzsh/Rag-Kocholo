        "text": "Chicago is one of the top sports cities in the country, attracting fans from all over the world to come cheer for our teams. Here’s a rundown of Chicago’s major sports teams.\n\nBaseball: Chicago Cubs\n\nCubs season: April through September\n\nFor many Chicago sports fans, April is the most exciting month of the year. That’s when baseball season kicks off, and Chicago is lucky enough to have two winning Major League Baseball (MLB) teams. No longer the lovable losers, the Chicago Cubs finally took home the World Series championship in 2016, more than 100 years after their last win in 1908.\n\nThe Chicago Cubs play at historic Wrigley Field, the second-oldest MLB ballpark in the nation, in the heart of the Wrigleyville neighborhood. And although Wrigley Field has held on to many nostalgic elements (the original scoreboard is still operated by hand), upgrades in the past few years have included the installation of huge state-of-the-art video screens and the expansion of the Budweiser Bleachers, a favorite spot for die-hard Cubs fans.\n\nThe fun actually begins before the game at Gallagher Way, an outdoor community space that hosts everything from live music to movie nights, and is home to a growing number of restaurants like the Budweiser Brickhouse Tavern (named for legendary sportscaster Jack Brickhouse).\n\nBaseball: Chicago White Sox\n\nWhite Sox season: April through September\n\nThe Chicago White Sox are the city’s South Side baseball heroes, taking home the coveted MLB World Series trophy in 2005. Home base is Guaranteed Rate Field, located just south of the Loop in the Bridgeport neighborhood. According to a 2017 J.D. Power survey, the Chicago White Sox ranked number one in offering the city’s best sports fan experience, thanks to factors like superior seating, food, and beverages (including the ChiSox Bar & Grill), and ease of game arrival/departure.\n\nTailgating is a White Sox tradition, with fans setting up grills in select parking lots and creating their own parties before the game. Another fun tradition is the fireworks that light up the sky after every White Sox home run. The summertime Crosstown Classic is one of the hottest tickets, when the White Sox play against the Cubs for hometown bragging rights.\n\nBasketball: Chicago Bulls\n\nBulls season: October through April\n\nThe Chicago Bulls keep the tradition of great basketball alive in the city at the United Center, located in the West Loop. Visit the soaring five-story atrium and snap a selfie with the statue of legendary Bulls player Michael Jordan. The atrium is a gathering place for fans before, during and after Bulls games.\n\nAt the Madhouse Team Store, a 10,000-square-foot Bulls and Blackhawks retail store on the atrium’s ground floor, you can snag souvenirs and team jerseys. A cool feature is an actual CTA train car outfitted with green screens where you can snap a photo of yourself with images of your favorite players or watch game clips and record your own play-by-play calls.\n\nBasketball: Chicago Sky\n\nSky season: May through September\n\nThe Chicago Sky joined the WNBA in 2006 and play at the Wintrust Arena, located in the South Loop. Sky Guy, the official mascot of the Chicago Sky can be seen at every home game.\n\nIn 2017, the Chicago Sky turned what many thought would be “a rebuilding year” into a record-breaking year in individual and team career-highs and milestones. General Manager and Head Coach Amber Stocks joined the Sky and her winning ways and competitive edge brought a contagiously exciting atmosphere.\n\nFootball: Chicago Bears\n\nBears season: August through December\n\nHistoric Soldier Field, located on the lakefront, is home turf for the Chicago Bears football team, a founding franchise of the NFL and winner of Super Bowl XX. Make like a local and tailgate before the game — it doesn’t matter how cold the winter weather is. You’ll find Bears fans set up with smoking grills and ice-cold drinks throughout the surface parking lots and atop the Waldron Deck.\n\nThe team hosts the free Chicago Bears Ultimate Tailgate on the Stadium Green on select game days, featuring live music, games, autograph signings by Bears players, a party bar, and food for sale.\n\nHockey: Chicago Blackhawks\n\nBlackhawks season: October through April\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks hockey team has been a local sports institution since 1926 (it’s one of the “Original Six” NHL teams), winning their sixth Stanley Cup championship in 2015. The Blackhawks also play at the United Center, where the stadium floor converts from a basketball court to an ice hockey rink.\n\nCheck out the giant Stanley Cup replica stationed in front of the Madhouse Team Store and browse through archival team photos and videos on a giant interactive touch screen. Keep an eye out for Tommy Hawk, the Blackhawks’ official mascot, who makes an appearance at all home games, showing off some mean hockey moves of his own.\n\nHockey: Chicago Wolves\n\nWolves season: October through April\n\nThe Chicago Wolves were a smash hit from the moment they took to the ice in 1994. The team started as an International Hockey League franchise and captured the Turner Cup championship in 1998 and 2000. When they shifted to the American Hockey League for the 2001-02 season, they made an immediate mark by claiming the 2002 Calder Cup. Head coach John Anderson and Kevin Cheveldayoff capped a remarkable run of four championships in 11 seasons with the 2008 Calder Cup title. As the Wolves approach the quarter-century mark as a franchise, they’ve earned more than 1,000 regular-season wins. You can catch your hockey adrenaline rush at Allstate Arena in suburban Rosemont.\n\nSoccer: Chicago Fire\n\nChicago Fire season: March through October\n\nChicago’s Major League Soccer (MLS) team exploded onto the scene in 1998, named in honor of the Great Chicago Fire. Since that time, the team won the MLS Cup Championship in its debut year, and has taken home the U.S. Open Cup an astounding four times. The Chicago Fire play at historic Solider Field along the Chicago lakefront, also home to the Chicago Bears.\n\nSoccer: Chicago Red Stars\n\nChicago Red Stars season: April through September"
