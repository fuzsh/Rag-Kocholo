        "text": "Chicago Bulls guard Zach LaVine is seemingly off the trading block after months of speculation whether he’d be shipped out in what looks to be a franchise in rebuild mode. Executive vice president Artūras Karnišovas spoke to reporters on Sunday about the vision for the future of the franchise — one that will include LaVine.\n\nHowever, Bulls management made it clear that just because LaVine or anyone else on the roster isn’t in trade conversations now doesn’t mean they are a long-term fix on the team.\n\nLaVine, coming off a season when he played only 25 games due to a foot injury that required surgery, has been in trade conversations dating back to last offseason. It is not necessarily due to a lack of production for the squad. Since joining the Bulls in 2017, LaVine has averaged 24.2 points, 4.7 rebounds, and 4.2 assists, and has made two All-Star teams.\n\nTrade conversations and general discourse around LaVine as a whole stem from the fact that although he can put up numbers as a scorer, it typically does not translate into winning for his teams. From 2017-2024, Chicago has made the postseason only one time — back in 2022. The Bulls lost that series in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks and LaVine was the third best player on that team behind current Sacramento Kings star DeMar Derozan and Nikola Vucevic.\n\nYahoo Sports' Jake Fischer noted how despite shopping LaVine on the trade market, there hasn't been much interest around the league.\n\nHis trade value across the board has gotten so low that dealing him in most scenarios would have required Chicago to attach a first-round pick in addition to LaVine, according to ESPN's Bobby Marks. Typically, trading stars would bring back draft picks in return, not sending them away with the star.\n\nAfter an offseason where the Bulls made many moves including drafting Matas Buzelis with the 11th overall pick in June and re-signing forward Patrick Williams to a five-year, $90 million deal, it seems like Chicago is opting toward building up its younger players.\n\nThe Bulls youth movement also brought guard Josh Giddey over via trade with the Thunder, sending Alex Caruso to Oklahoma City.\n\nWhile LaVine certainly isn’t “old” at 29, he still brings experience to Chicago's team. For now, LaVine will return as a veteran presence and probably a main scorer. But don’t be surprised if his name pops up in trade talks again if the team gets off to a slow start next season."
