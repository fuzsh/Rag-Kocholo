        "text": "It’s been a little over 11 years since the Golden State Warriors shocked the world by felling the mighty Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, becoming the first (and only) 8 seed to beat a 1 seed in a seven-game series.\n\nI still think about it all the time. The yellow towels waving frantically all through Oracle Arena; the playground flair from Baron Davis and Stephen Jackson; the corner threes from Jason Richardson; the childlike energy that exuded from every player, coach, and fan.\n\nIn a world of 1080p, I happily watch this video every month, like clockwork.\n\nIt’s beautiful. It’s poetry. Distressed Mark Cuban angrily muttering something as he tries to avoid a camera. Don Nelson hugging everyone like it’s a retirement party. Avery Johnson looking like a yellow jacket stung his butt and he’s trying to suppress emotion. Baron Davis egging on the crowd.\n\nIt’s perfect.\n\nThe We Believe team comes up a lot in conversation, or at least in the conversations that I have in my head (which are frequent). Primarily because the angry masses on Twitter like to tell me how I became a Warriors fan in 2015, and before that was a Miami Heat fan, and before that a Los Angeles Lakers fan.\n\nI let them think that in peace. It’s cute. But in my head I know the truth.\n\nYes, championships are the most exciting thing in sports. Yes, Steph Curry and Klay Thompson are my two favorite players ever. Yes, this dynasty is emphatically the best basketball I will root for in my life.\n\nAnd yet, 2007 was the most fun I’ve ever had as a Warriors fan.\n\nIt was magical. It was passionate. It was unexpected. And it was the ideal representation of what can happen on a basketball court when players are connecting, in sync, and playing with a singular purpose.\n\nIt feels like it was just yesterday, in part because so many of the players from the team still make their way onto the timeline, onto SportsCenter, onto random arguments about which players did what best.\n\nSo in honor of them, let’s look back on that magical team, what the players did, and, just to make us all feel old, see what they’re up to now.\n\nKelenna Azubuike\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n7.1 points and 2.3 rebounds per game, 43.0% shooting on threes.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\nJust a rookie, Azubuike played only 12 minutes against the Mavs, and three minutes in the semifinals against the Utah Jazz. He scored four points.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nAzubuike played for a few more years in the NBA, and showed great promise in his third year, when he averaged 14.4 points per game. Unfortunately, knee injuries ended his career early, and the 2011-12 season (which he funnily enough played with the Mavs) was the last professional basketball he played. He played all but three of his NBA games with the Warriors.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nWhile knee injuries kept him off the court, he’s stuck around basketball, and the Warriors in particular. Local fans are very familiar with Azubuike, who now does in-studio analysis pre and post-game for NBC Sports Bay Area. It’s put him around the team for some great moments:\n\nMatt Barnes\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n9.8 points, 4.6 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 1.0 steals per game.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\n11.1 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.4 assists, and 1.5 steals per game.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nBarnes, who made his NBA debut in 2003, had a hard time finding a role in the NBA prior to We Believe, but proved his worth in Golden State, where he also played in 2007-08 and 2008-09.\n\nHe had a journeyman career, playing for nine franchises, but made an impact everywhere he went. His final year came in 2016-17, when he re-joined the Warriors at the end of the year, and finished his career with his first title.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nSince retiring in 2017, Barnes has taken an active role in his community. He helped organize a march in Sacramento following the murder of Stephon Clark, and has also spoken up about the role that marijuana can play in recovery for athletes.\n\nAndris Biedrins\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n9.5 points, 9.3 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game on 59.9% shooting.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\n6.4 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game on 73.0% shooting.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nAs the center position evolved, Beans did not. Biedrins peaked a few years after We Believe, as a very good center, but then proceeded to fall of a cliff, and became more known for his inability to shoot free throws than anything else.\n\nHe did, however, stick around in Golden State until the 2012-13 season, where he once again made the playoffs with the Warriors. He is the only member of We Believe who stayed on the team until the next playoff run.\n\nHis last games in the NBA came in 2013-14, when he played six contests with the Jazz - the only non-Warriors games he would play.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nBiedrins has been out of professional basketball since leaving the NBA, but he recently showed up to a Latvian slam dunk contest with a pretty sleek new look.\n\nBaron Davis\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n20.1 points, 8.1 assists, 4.4 rebounds, and 2.1 steals per game.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\n25.3 points, 6.5 assists, 4.5 rebounds, 2.9 steals per game, and one soul from Andrei Kirilenko.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nThe superstar of the We Believe team, Davis lasted only one more year with the Warriors, before a clash with Don Nelson resulted in a parting between the player and the team. He bounced around from team to team until 2012, when injuries forced him out of the league.\n\nHe attempted a comeback in 2016, and played in the G-League, but never made it back to the NBA.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nStill playing! This summer Davis joined The BIG3, where he’s tearing it up for Three’s Company.\n\nMonta Ellis\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n16.5 points, 4.5 assists, 3.2 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\nAfter playing a huge role during the season, his second, Ellis’ role and performance diminished in the playoffs. He averaged 8.0 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 0.9 steals per game.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nThe We Believe team put Ellis on the map. The former second-round pick - then just 21 - won Most Improved Player that season, and would average at least 19.0 points per game for the next seven seasons. He became the face of the franchise, even as the team reverted back to their dark days. When the next face of the franchise showed up in Curry, Ellis was traded, and bounced around a few teams.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nEllis last played in the 2016-17 season, when he averaged 8.5 points and 3.2 assists per game for the Indiana Pacers. Given that he’s still just 32, it wouldn’t be surprising if he gets a contract for the upcoming season. He could certainly get a camp invite if he wants one.\n\nAdonal Foyle\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n2.2 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 1.0 blocks per game.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\nFoyle was a back of the bench player when We Believe rolled around. He played just six minutes in the playoffs, totaling two points and two rebounds.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nThe magical 2007 playoff run marked the end of Foyle’s 10 years with the franchise that drafted him. He played two more years in the NBA before retiring.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nThough retired, Foyle has remained a prominent part of the Bay Area sports scene. He has been active in the community, promoting not only the Warriors, but other local teams, and hosting an annual golf tournament for charity.\n\nHe is a very active philanthropist, and in 2014 was named the Warriors community ambassador, a role that he has embraced.\n\nAl Harrington\n\n2006-07 stats;\n\n17.0 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\nHarrington saw his minutes reduced in the playoffs, for matchup purposes. Still, he played a pivotal role, and averaged 10.2 points and 4.6 rebounds per game.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nHarrington, who came to the team in the huge trade in early 2007, played another year with the Warriors, and was traded at the start of the 2008-09 season. He retired in 2014, having played 16 NBA seasons.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nAfter a brief stint overseas, Harrington joined The BIG3 in 2017, its inaugural year. He currently plays in the league for Trilogy, where he is a co-captain, and plays against many former NBA teammates.\n\nHe has also been an advocate for marijuana and CBD for athletes, where he has invested in numerous CBD companies, and also created his own company, Harrington Wellness.\n\nStephen Jackson\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n16.8 points, 4.6 assists, 3.3 rebounds, and 1.3 steals per game.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\n19.9 points, 3.6 assists, 3.6 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game, 36.1% shooting on threes.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nIf Davis was the superstar of this team, Stack Jack was the heart and soul. Jackson was the Warriors’ Draymond Green before Draymond Green, lighting a fire in his teammates, talking smack to opponents and referees, displaying enough cockiness and bravado for the entire city, and grabbing technical fouls like they were going out of style.\n\nThat continued after We Believe, as he posted two more brilliant years before being traded early in the 2009-2010 season. After that, Jackson started to taper off, and retired in 2014, after 14 years in the NBA.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nThe basketball days live on for Jackson, who is co-captain of The BIG3’s Killer 3s. In addition to playing ball, he is a regular guest on ESPN’s The Jump, and seems to make appearances anywhere where basketball is discussed.\n\nŠarūnas Jasikevičius\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n4.3 points and 2.3 assists per game.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\nJasikevičius played only six minutes in the playoffs, and tallied one point and two assists.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nThe six minutes that the Lithuanian point guard played during the magical playoff run were his final minutes in the NBA. After leaving the league, he played professionally in Europe until 2014.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nJasikevičius currently coaches for Žalgiris, a team in the LKL, Lithuania’s top professional league. He has been the head coach since 2016, has won two LKL titles, and has twice been named the LKL Coach of the Year. His basketball card remains in my closet.\n\nPatrick O’Bryant\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n1.9 points and 1.3 rebounds per game.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\nO’Bryant, permanently in Nellie’s doghouse, did not appear in any playoff games.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nThe lottery pick, who was a rookie during We Believe, never caught on in Golden State, and the team let him go in 2008 after appearing in just 40 games over two seasons. He played two more seasons before leaving the NBA with only 90 games played. He had a stint in the G-League in 2011, and signed with the Charlotte Hornets in 2013, but never again played in the league.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nAfter playing professionally overseas, O’Bryant returned to the states to do what so many of his We Believe teammates also do: Play in The BIG3. He signed with the league before this summer’s season, though to this point he has not joined any team. He did, however, compete in this year’s The Basketball Tournament, a single-elimination, winner-take-all tournament with $2 million awarded to the winning team. O’Bryant also offers private coaching to young players.\n\nMickaël Piétrus\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n11.1 points and 4.5 rebounds per game, 38.8% shooting on threes.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\n6.0 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nWe Believe marked the best basketball of Piétrus’ career. He played one more year in Golden State (his fifth season) before bouncing around on four other teams.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nPiétrus played professionally in France in the 2015-16 season, but hasn’t played since, and hasn’t left an easy-to-find footprint anywhere along the way. Wherever he is, we can be sure that he’s stepping out of bounds in the corner before a baseline drive.\n\nJosh Powell\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n3.5 points and 2.3 rebounds per game, 52.6% shooting\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\nAppearing at the back of the bench, Powell played in just six postseason minutes, tallying one point, one rebound, and one block.\n\nPost-We Believe career:\n\nPowell came to the Warriors as part of the trade with the Indiana Pacers that netted the team Jackson and Harrington, but unlike those other two, it was his only year in Golden State. He bounced around the league, and won two titles with the Los Angeles Lakers. After not playing for two years, he returned to the NBA in the 2013-14 season, where he appeared in one game, his last in the league.\n\nHe then spent a year as an assistant coach for the Houston Rockets, before a few more years playing overseas.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nDrumroll, please . . . . in The BIG3! Powell is Jackson’s teammate on the Killer 3s. You may be sensing a theme here.\n\nJason Richardson\n\n2006-07 stats:\n\n16.0 points, 5.1 rebounds, 3.4 assists, and 1.1 steals per game, 36.5% shooting on threes.\n\nWe Believe playoff performance:\n\n19.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.0 assists, and 1.3 steals per game, 35.4% shooting on threes.\n\nPost We Believe career:\n\nThe 2006-07 season was, sadly, J-Rich’s final one in Golden State. He was mercilessly shipped off to the then-Charlotte Bobcats in exchange for the draft pick that became Brandan Wright. Whoops.\n\nHe bounced through five teams before retiring prior to the start of the 2015-16 season. Richardson had experienced numerous knee injuries, and was worried about causing irreparable damage.\n\nWhere is he now?\n\nAfter ending his playing days, Richardson returned to school to finish his degree in Sports Business. He’s also stayed active in the basketball community, as he’ll be heading to Bangkok next month to help coach the Jr. NBA Thailand All-Stars.\n\nLast year, J-Rich made an appearance at the Warriors camp, and reminded fans of how exciting of a dunker he was.\n\nFor a lot of fans, that We Believe team was the appetizer to the current dynasty’s entree. It was the first taste of the success and energy that accompanies the playoffs in a long, long time. Over the span of 22 years, those six magical games agains the Mavs represented the organization’s only playoff series win.\n\nNow, in the last four years alone, the team has won 15 playoff series. It’s emphatically a different era for the Warriors, but in some strange, sentimental way, it still feels attached.\n\nAnd for all the modern success, I miss that team."
