        "text": "Desperate to upgrade an increasingly fragile frontcourt, I’m told the Nuggets are trying to pry center Andris Biedrins from the Golden State Warriors.\n\nAt 24, Biedrins has already played six years in the NBA. He averaged a double-double two years ago, but slumped to averages of 5.0 points and 7.8 rebounds in an injury-marred campaign last season.\n\nThat and his contract — he has four years left at $9 million per — have apparently made him expendable to the Warriors. But the Nuggets are struggling to come up with a package that will get a deal done.\n\nThe difficulty in acquiring Biedrins is one more sign of the trouble the Nuggets are having this summer trying to improve an aging team with a swollen payroll under an owner determined to stem the franchise’s financial losses. The best they can offer is J.R. Smith, who doesn’t have much trade value at the moment, or Kenyon Martin, who has only one year left on his contract, but a year with a hefty $16.5 million price tag.\n\nEither deal would require an additional piece for salary cap purposes, but Martin’s large expiring contract will be tough to trade until he shows he’s healthy following another knee surgery or the trade deadline in February, whichever comes first.\n\nAnother example of their struggle to improve their roster came a week ago at the draft. Word was that somebody would draft Derrick Caracter for the Nuggets in the second round. The Nuggets would then trade for the rights to the UTEP power forward. After all, every team needs Caracter. The Lakers ended up drafting him with the 58th pick.\n\nWhen a subsequent trade was not announced, and Nuggets vice president Rex Chapman said publicly the club had been unable to move into the second round to take a big man, it left the impression the Nuggets could no longer get the simplest of deals done.\n\nThis, in turn, raised the perennial question about who’s behind the curtain in the front office. Mark Warkentien is interviewing for other jobs, which represents an unusually quick fall from grace considering his peers voted him the 2008-09 NBA executive of the year.\n\nOdd as it sounds, the organization seems to resent the public credit he’s been given for the team’s success. Strangely, Warkentien’s biographical sketch in the Nuggets’ media guide makes no mention of the 2009 award.\n\nWarkentien’s apparent expendability only adds to the impression that the man actually pulling the strings is owner E. Stanley Kroenke’s friend and confidant Bret Bearup, who has no official title with the organization and does not appear in the team’s media guide.\n\nAs if all this were not enough, the organization is now putting out word that it might have to trade Carmelo Anthony if he doesn’t sign a contract extension.\n\nThe truth is the Nuggets are running out of options to improve the cast. Aside from Anthony, only Nene has significant value on the trade market, but trading the one healthy big man on a team looking to get bigger doesn’t really help.\n\nBy putting Anthony out there into the rumor slipstream as NBA free agency gets underway, the Nuggets position themselves as a potential white knight in the event of a sign- and-trade deal for one of this summer’s premium free agents. This is a very long shot because the only top-tier free agent for whom a sign-and- trade is even plausible is power forward Chris Bosh.\n\nBosh said on his website Wednesday that he, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade have been looking forward to this free-agent market since they all signed contracts that would expire together four years ago. Recent national reports suggest Bosh will end up playing with James or Wade, possibly both if they end up in Miami.\n\nThe Nuggets can’t expect much help from improving young players because, with the exception of guards Ty Lawson and Arron Afflalo, they don’t have any. The three-headed front office of Bearup, Warkentien and Chapman has taken a pass on three of the past four NBA drafts.\n\nComing off seven consecutive playoff appearances, the Nuggets find themselves caught between a mostly veteran roster and a bloated payroll, trying to make changes through a Byzantine internal structure even many employees don’t understand.\n\nThey need to improve on the court but have few tradable commodities and no new blood through the draft once again. Seems like a really good time for a creative general manager.\n\nDave Krieger: 303-954-5297, dkrieger@denverpost.com or twitter.com/DaveKrieger"
