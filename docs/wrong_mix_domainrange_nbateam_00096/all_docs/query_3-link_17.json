        "text": "i thought after a very solid season andris would be the next great european center but he’s been really bad this year, he hasn’t even solidified himself as the starter after coming back from injury…he’s not overly athletic and not the most aggressive offensive player\n\nhis numbers are garbage this season\n\n5.3 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 1.7 bpg and hes shooting a laughable 7% from the free throw line (1-14)\n\ni think golden state could make a play for a center this offseason…they need to do SOMETHING..maybe fire nelson, or trade brandan wright but this team is very very bad and are not going to be competing anytime soon in the western conference\n\nyou cant expect a guy to produce more when im pretty sure that back is still hurting and he has missed most of the season. even if he plays all 40min. if you arent in the same shape as the other nba big men on top of being injuried you prob wont be doing much. hes actually doing pretty well considering. and with his history of play it would take a dummy to think of trading him unless they could get a better player. especially with him being only 23. im glad fans arent the gm’s making decisions, there would prob be so many dumb trades with no team really being able to jell. and go forbids that a player has a bad stretch of games..lol\n\nWow people want to judge Biedrins on only a month’s worth of play after an injury instead of looking at his whole body of work. Especially last season… he had an excellent season. I’ll say it again, he was really impressive last season.\n\nThe team is not very very bad. They have a crazy coach & have had A TON OF INJURIES. The talent is there.\n\nIt is pretty hard to compete in the WEST when you have all these players injured at one time or another: Azubuike, Turiaf, Biedrins, Brandan Wright, Morrow, Anthony Randolph, Radmanovic, Claxton, Raja Bell, CJ Watson.\n\nAzubuike only played 9 games. He is out for the season.\n\nTuriaf has played 12 games. He is currently battling an ankle injury.\n\nRadmonvic has played 28 games. He is currently battling an achilles injury.\n\nBrandan Wright hasn’t played a single game this season.\n\nMorrow now has a knee injury & has missed several games.\n\nRandolph has played 33 games & he is now out indefinitely with an ankle injury.\n\nRaja Bell has only played 1 game for the Warriors. He is out with a wrist injury.\n\nBiedrins has only played 15 games all season.\n\nNo need to jump on the Warriors & act like they have a garbage team.\n\nlol his first game back was December 28th against the Celtics…and he’s still not 100% we don’t need him to score because we would never utilize an inside presence (fire nellie)…add the fact that before Randolph and Radmonovic were injured they had improved their rebounding too, Andris’ numbers would go down a little. We drafted him for defense and rebounding, and if you look at his past couple games, he’s done exactly that. So give him a chance, and wait till they get healthy before you check em imo"
