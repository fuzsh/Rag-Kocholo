        "text": "Chris Paul can’t recall the exact moment he knew that he wanted to stay with the Los Angeles Clippers. Once he decided, though, the free-agent All-Star guard was quick to commit.\n\nHe signed a five-year deal worth nearly $108 million on Tuesday night, telling the Clippers he wanted to talk about it with the rest of the team’s free- agent signees on Wednesday.\n\nPaul didn’t want the spotlight to himself because, he said, “There’s no one person who is more important on the team.”\n\nPaul joined Matt Barnes and Ryan Hollins, who both re-signed, along with newly acquired Darren Collison, Jared Dudley and J.J. Redick, and new coach Doc Rivers at the team’s training complex.\n\nPistons add Josh Smith\n\nThe Detroit Pistons signed Josh Smith to a $54 million, four-year contract.\n\nPistons President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars calls Smith a two-way player. He says he looks forward to the forward blending his talent with the team’s young nucleus.\n\nDetroit will likely start Smith, 27, it its frontcourt with forward Greg Monroe, 23, and center Andre Drummond, who turns 20 next month. The backcourt will include Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, the No. 8 overall pick in the draft.\n\nThe 6-foot-9, 225-pound Smith led Atlanta with 17.5 points per game last season, averaging 8.4 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 1.8 blocks and 1.2 steals. Smith has played only for his hometown Hawks, who drafted him No. 17 overall out of high school in 2004.\n\nSmith is the only NBA player to average at least 15 points, seven rebounds, three assists, two blocks and a steal per game since blocks and steals became an official league statistic four decades ago.\n\nIguodala ends up a Warrior\n\nThe three-team trade that will send swingman Andre Iguodala to the Golden State Warriors, guard Randy Foye to the Denver Nuggets and three expiring contracts along with a package of draft picks to the Utah Jazz is complete.\n\nThe trade started when the Warriors reached a free-agent agreement with Iguodala on a four-year, $48 million deal last week. Golden State cleared more than $24 million by sending Richard Jefferson, Andris Biedrins and Brandon Rush to the Jazz along with four draft picks and cash.\n\nIn the end, the teams wrapped the transactions into one trade that provides additional salary cap flexibility and compensation for each of them.\n\nThe Jazz received Golden State’s first-round picks in 2014 and 2017 and second-round picks in 2016 and 2017. Utah also acquired Denver’s second-round pick in 2018.\n\nGolden State is only taking back Kevin Murphy and his non-guaranteed $788,000 deal from Utah. The Warriors will be able to roll part of the salaries of Jefferson ($11 million), Biedrins ($9 million) and Rush ($4 million) into trade exceptions, which allow teams to exceed the salary cap under the NBA’s complicated system.\n\nDenver also received Foye in a sign-and-trade with the Jazz, who got back that additional pick while they continue to purge players and build for the future.\n\nIguodala averaged 13 points, 5.4 assists and 5.3 rebounds while playing forward and guard last season for Denver.\n\nAround the league\n\nChris Andersen is returning to the NBA champion Miami Heat, and at a bargain price — he signed a $1.7 million, one-year deal. … The Los Angeles Lakers re-signed 7-foot center Robert Sacre. … The Portland Trail Blazers formally signed free-agent small forward Dorell Wright and acquired forward Thomas Robinson in a trade with Houston. Portland traded the NBA rights to Kostas Papnikolaou and Marko Todorovic, and two future second-round picks, to the Rockets in exchange for Robinson. … The Indiana Pacers re-signed David West and added free-agent guard C.J. Watson. … The Washington Wizards added free-agent guard Eric Maynor and re-signed Garrett Temple for backcourt depth. … The Chicago Bulls signed free-agent forward Mike Dunleavy to a two-year deal … Power forward Paul Millsap signed a two-year, $19 million contract with the Atlanta Hawks. … The New Orleans Pelicans agreed to contracts with center Greg Stiemsma and guard Anthony Morrow, sources said. … The Sacramento Kings acquired point guard Greivis Vasquez in a three-team trade agreement reached last week that sends Tyreke Evans to the New Orleans Pelicans. … The Minnesota Timberwolves agreed to a trade with Oklahoma City for guard Kevin Martin that also allowed them to land swingman Corey Brewer in free agency. … The Chicago Bulls waived veteran guard Richard Hamilton.\n\nFront-office moves"
