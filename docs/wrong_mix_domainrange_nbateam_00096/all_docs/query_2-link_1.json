        "text": "Inks two-way deal with Chicago\n\nSteward excelled for the Bulls during the Las Vegas Summer League. He averaged 19.3 points across five outings, including a 37-point effort against the Hawks on Friday. The undrafted point guard out of Duke has spent the past three seasons in the G League and hasn't yet made his NBA regular-season debut.\n\nGoes for 28 in SL\n\nBuzelis expanded upon his 15-point performance against the Bucks on Saturday with a 28-point outburst Sunday against Golden State. Buzelis was able to find his shot Sunday, tying for a game-high four three-pointers made after missing all four attempts in his previous outing. The 11th overall pick could see a substantial role for the Bulls this season with their uncertainty across the roster.\n\nScores 15 points in win\n\nThe No. 11 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft, Buzelis could potentially have a lot of opportunity during his rookie season with the Bulls recently moving on from DeMar DeRozan. Buzelis' playmaking ability combined with his size at 6-foot-9 makes him very intriguing, but he will have to improve his jumper after struggling in that regard with the G League Ignite last season."
