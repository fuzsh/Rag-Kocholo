        "text": "The Chicago Bulls compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member team of the league’s Eastern Conference Central Division. The majority of the 1990s were marked by the Chicago Bulls’ dynasty, when they won six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998, led by Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, coach Phil Jackson, and Michael Jordan, who is considered one of the best players in league and team history. He also ranks as the fifth most prolific scorer on the all-time scoring list of the NBA.\n\nThe Chicago Bulls more than doubled their franchise value from 2015 to 2022, and were valued at 4.1 billion U.S. dollars in 2022, making the team the fourth most valuable franchise in the league. In the 2021/22 season, the Bulls were also amongst the highest grossing teams in the NBA, with 352 million U.S. dollars in revenues.\n\nIn the 2021/22 season, the Chicago Bulls had the NBA’s highest average regular season home attendance. The team’s support by fans online was equally strong, as it was amongst the most followed NBA teams on social media, both on Facebook and on Twitter."
