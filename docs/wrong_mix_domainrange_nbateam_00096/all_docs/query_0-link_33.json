        "text": "Chicago Bulls Acquire C.J. Watson in Sign & Trade with Golden State\n\nOn July 22nd, 2010, the Golden State Warriors signed-and-traded guard C.J. Watson to the Chicago Bulls for a 2011 second round draft pick (Charles Jenkins) and a trade exception.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors picked up C.J. Watson on a 10-day contract in January of 2008. After playing in Italy, Greece and the NBA D-League, Watson impressed the Warriors enough to sign a second 10-day contract and a deal for the remainder of the year as well as the 2008-09 season after 8 games. The deal became partially guaranteed on July 25th, 2008 and became guaranteed for the league minimum after January of 2009.\n\nFor the 2007-08 season, Watson saw action in 32 games and managed 3.7 PPG, 1.0 RPG, 1.1 APG and 0.5 SPG in 11.5 MPG. The Warriors missed out on the postseason by just two games after finishing the year 48-34.\n\nIn the 2008 offseason, the Warriors went through major changes. Point guard Baron Davis defected to the Los Angeles Clippers in free agency, and reserves Matt Barnes and Mickael Pietrus signed with Phoenix and Orlando respectively. Golden State signed forward Corey Maggette away from the Clippers to a five-year, $50 million deal. The Warriors also re-signed restricted free agents Monta Ellis and Andris Biedrins to a total of $129 million over six years.\n\nThe 2008-09 season was a disaster for Golden State but an opportunity for Watson. Ellis tore the deltoid ligament in his left ankle in an offseason moped accident. He lied initially and claimed that he hurt himself playing basketball. The Warriors ownership suspended Ellis for 30 games and he lost $3 million as well.\n\nThe Warriors were 5-6 early on when they lost 22 of their next 27 games and fell to 10-28. The season would not improve as the Warriors finished with a 29-53 mark. Ellis missed 57 games that year and Watson’s playing time improved vastly. He appeared in 77 contests (18 starts) and produced 9.5 PPG, 2.5 RPG, 2.7 APG and 1.2 SPG in 24.5 MPG.\n\nIn the 2009 offseason, the Warriors drafted point guard Stephen Curry out of Davidson in the draft. Watson became a restricted free agent after the Warriors extended a qualifying offer.\n\nWatson had multiple suitors. He rejected an offer from the 76ers and nearly signed an offer sheet with the Orlando Magic. The Warriors offered Watson three years and $5.4 million. He rejected the offer and bet on himself by signing for the one-year qualifying offer just over $1 million.\n\nThe new look Warriors featured Watson as a reserve playing behind Golden State’s starting backcourt of Curry and Ellis. Golden State struggled all year during the 2009-10 season. The team had a 7-21 start and never recovered. They finished the year 26-56.\n\nWatson saw action in 65 games, and averaged 10.3 PPG, 2.8 APG, 2.6 RPG and 1.6 SPG in 27.5 MPG. He had his best stretch from February 10th-March 11th when he averaged 18.2 PPG on 54.1% from the field and 36.1% on treys, 3.5 RPG, 4.6 APG and 2.4 SPG in 36.8 MPG. During this streak, Watson lit up the Sacramento Kings for 40 points.\n\nWatson became a free agent for the second consecutive summer. The Warriors extended a qualifying offer to Watson making him a restricted free agent. Watson signed a three-year deal worth $10 million and he was subsequently traded to Chicago as part of a sign-and-trade. The third season of the contract was a team option.\n\nIn his two and a half years with Golden State, Watson appeared in 174 games (33 starts) and averaged 8.7 PPG, 2.4 APG, 2.3 RPG and 1.23 SPG in 23.2 MPG. He shot 45% from the field, 35% from downtown, and 82% from the free-throw line. Known as Quiet Storm, Watson was a success story as an undrafted find for Golden State, providing solid play in their backcourt.\n\nThe second-rounder that Chicago offered was going to be the lesser of two 2011 second round draft picks Chicago owned from Utah and Phoenix. Also involved in the deal was a traded player exception worth half of Watson’s first year salary with Chicago ($1.55 million).\n\nWatson was one of many newcomers to join Chicago after a very busy summer. The Bulls had also added Carlos Boozer, Kyle Korver and Ronnie Brewer to build around their young core of Derrick Rose, Joakim Noah and Luol Deng. Chicago also hired former Boston Celtics assistant coach Tom Thibodeau to take over the team.\n\nThe new look Bulls were a major success story. They started out just 9-8, but behind a top-ranked defense, Chicago went 53-12 the rest of the way to finish with the best overall record at 62-20. Bulls star Derrick Rose won the MVP that season.\n\nWith Rose leading the Bulls, Watson saw limited minutes (13.3 MPG) as his backup. He contributed 4.9 PPG, 1.1 RPG, 2.3 APG and 0.7 SPG in 82 games. In Watson’s lone start of the year, he had a season-high 33 points in a loss to Denver.\n\nWhen he did play, Watson was effective. Chicago had a defensive rating of 92.7 points allowed per 100 possessions versus 99.1 points allowed per 100 possessions when he was off per the NBA Stats page.\n\nChicago earned the number one seed in the East and faced the 37-45 Indiana Pacers in the first round. The young Pacers surprised Chicago by leading for much of the first game. However, Chicago went on a 16-1 run in the final 3:38 to win 104-99 and take a 1-0 series lead.\n\nThe Bulls captured Game Two 96-90 and took a commanding 3-0 lead after winning 88-84 in Indiana. After an 89-84 Pacers win, Chicago ended the series with a 116-89 blowout in Game Five. During the series, Watson averaged 3.4 PPG and 2.6 APG in 9.6 MPG.\n\nChicago advanced to a second round matchup with the fifth seed Atlanta Hawks. Hawks All-Star Joe Johnson had 34 points in a Game One 103-95 Atlanta win. Rose had 25 points and 10 assists in Game Two as the Bulls evened the series with an 86-73 victory. Rose dropped 44 points on Atlanta in a 99-82 Bulls win.\n\nAtlanta tied the series at two games apiece with a 100-88 win. Chicago took Games Five and Six by double figures each to win the series 4-2. Watson produced 3.0 PPG on 28.6% shooting in 8.4 MPG during the six-game Conference Semifinals.\n\nThe Bulls advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since the Michael Jordan days when making the Conference Finals was a common occurrence. Chicago faced the Miami Heat in a battle of the East’s top two teams.\n\nChicago drew blood first with a 103-82 rout in the first game. Heat forward LeBron James had 29 points, 10 rebounds and five assists as the Heat evened the series with an 85-75 Game Two victory.\n\nThe series shifted to Miami and the Heat took care of business with victories in Games Three and Four. In the finale, Miami trailed by 12 points with 3:53 left. James and Dwyane Wade sparked a 19-4 run to to win and eliminate Chicago 4-1. Watson managed 3.2 PPG and 1.8 APG in 7.5 MPG in the five-game set.\n\nAfter the 2011 NBA lockout occurred and ended, the Bulls entered the truncated 2011-12 season as title contenders with a similar roster intact. Outside of the addition of Rip Hamilton in free agency and the departure of Kurt Thomas, Chicago’s rotation was nearly identical.\n\nThe Bulls won 16 of their first 19 games, but despite their wins, the season would be clouded by injuries to Derrick Rose. A sore groin, turf toe, back spasms and more played a part in Rose missing 27 of 66 total games. Despite Rose being out for significant amounts of time, Chicago finished tied for the best record in the NBA at 50-16.\n\nWith Rose injured, Watson received a boost in playing time. He compiled 9.7 PPG, 2.1 RPG, 4.1 APG and 0.7 SPG in 23.7 MPG and 49 appearances (25 starts). Watson did miss a stretch of action with a dislocated left elbow.\n\nChicago battled the number eight seed Philadelphia 76ers in the first round. The Bulls had a comfortable 103-91 Game One victory, but suffered a devastating blow when Rose tore his left ACL with 1:21 left in the fourth quarter.\n\nWatson took over the starting point guard spot after Rose’s injury. In Game Two, Chicago built a nine-point lead, but Philadelphia outscored the Bulls 62-37 in the second half to even the series with a 109-92 win.\n\nGame Three saw the Bulls take a nine-point edge into the fourth quarter. They were outscored 28-14 in the final stanza and lost 79-74. Even worse, the Bulls lost center Joakim Noah for the rest of the series thanks to a badly sprained left ankle.\n\nSixers center Spencer Hawes had 22 points, eight rebounds and three blocks as Philadelphia won 89-82 and took a commanding 3-1 series lead. The Bulls’ staunch defense came to life in the fifth contest as they held the 76ers to 69 points on 25-of-78 shooting in a victory.\n\nGame Six would go right down to the wire. After an Omer Asik bucket with 25.9 seconds left, The Sixers trailed Chicago 78-75. Philadelphia forward Thaddeus Young converted on a scoop lay-in with 12.8 seconds left to make Chicago’s lead just one point. The Bulls inbounded the ball with Watson handling the ball. He drove the ball down the court, evading fouling defenders.\n\nAs he crossed halfcourt, Watson only had Spencer Hawes in front of him with Bulls center Omer Asik to his left. Instead of keeping the ball for himself, Watson passed to Asik who was fouled while unsuccessfully going up for a layup.\n\nA career 48% foul shooter at the time, Asik missed both free-throws. 76ers forward Andre Iguodala rebounded Asik’s second miss and took the ball the full length of the court and drew a foul on a layup attempt with 2.2 seconds left. Iguodala nailed both free-throws to give Philadelphia a 79-78 lead.\n\nWith no timeouts, the Bulls and Watson were forced to hoist up a prayer at the buzzer. The shot was errant and Chicago became the third number one seed to lose in the first round of the playoffs in a seven-game series.\n\nWatson was heavily scrutinized for his decision to pass since he was a career 80.7% from the foul line at that point. The 6-foot-2 guard received death threats on Twitter after the series loss. For the series, Watson struggled mightily. He managed 7.3 PPG on 24.1% from the field and 25% from beyond the arc in 27.4 MPG.\n\nThe Bulls declined the option in Watson’s deal and let him go before the guarantee date to avoid paying the luxury tax. Watson signed a one-year deal with the Brooklyn Nets for the 2012-13 season.\n\nWatson ended his Chicago tenure with 6.7 PPG, 1.5 RPG, 2.9 APG and 0.8 SPG in 131 contests (26 starts). The former University of Tennessee guard posted a shooting split of 37/39/78.\n\nThe Warriors ended up receiving a second round draft pick that was originally from the Phoenix Suns, but had been moved to Chicago in a deal involving Hakim Warrick. That selection was used on Hofstra guard Charles Jenkins at the 44th spot of the 2011 NBA draft.\n\nThe Warriors had a 5-11 record early on and they were 18-22 when they traded Monta Ellis to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Andrew Bogut and Stephen Jackson. The Warriors traded Jackson to the San Antonio Spurs for Richard Jefferson, T.J. Ford and a first round draft pick two days later.\n\nAfter the Ellis deal, the Warriors went 5-21 the rest of the season to finish 23-43. In his rookie season, Jenkins was given a considerable amount of playing time after Stephen Curry sat out 40 games with multiple ankle injuries. He averaged 5.8 PPG, 1.2 RPG, and 1.3 APG in 51 games and 28 starts with Golden State.\n\nIn the 2012 draft, the Warriors had four picks and made key additions with seventh pick Harrison Barnes, 30th pick Festus Ezeli and 35th pick Draymond Green. In free agency, they also created roster depth with the signings of Carl Landry and Jarrett Jack.\n\nJenkins played for the Warriors in 2012 Summer League. He managed 14.2 PPG on 51.2% FG shooting and 2.8 APG in five games and 27.8 MPG.\n\nThe addition of Jack as a reserve and the return of a fully healthy Curry cut Jenkins’ minutes dramatically. He had seen action in 47 contests and produced 1.7 PPG and 0.6 APG in 6.2 MPG when his Warriors tenure ended.\n\nDuring the 2013 trade deadline, the Warriors dealt Jenkins to the 76ers in a financially based move. Golden State was looking to clean up its luxury tax bill and dealt Jenkins and big man Jeremy Tyler in a separate deal.\n\nJenkins ended his Warriors tenure with 3.9 PPG, 0.9 RPG and 2.0 APG in 98 career appearances. The former Hofstra guard shot 44% from the field and 77% from the charity stripe.\n\nC.J. Watson on the trade (via Chicago Tribune):\n\n“I just want to win. That was what I was looking for in free agency, to join a winning team and a playoff team. The Bulls have a lot of great players and we can be a really good team. Even though there are a lot of new players, I think we can gel quickly and play well together. The sky is the limit, especially in the Eastern Conference.”\n\nOn what he can contribute:\n\n“I take a lot of pride in the dues I paid. I never took anything for granted. I worked hard for everything and will keep working hard. I think I have an all-around game. I play defense, push the tempo, love to fast break and have fun. And I will bring energy every night.”\n\nOn joining Chicago (via ESPN Chicago):\n\n“I’m very excited. I’m still high off the excitement. I found out right before I got on the plane [Monday], so I had the whole plane ride to think about it and know that I’m going to Chicago, so it’s a fun and exciting time for me right now.”\n\nOn Bulls coach Tom Thibodeau:\n\n“I know that he’s a defensive-minded coach. I heard he was one of the top assistants last year. It’s going to be fun to play for him. I’m not sure what style or anything that they play, but I’m just excited to get out there and play and to play with a great team and a future playoff team.”\n\nHow the news has been an exciting time:\n\n“It’s been kind of a whirlwind. Especially [Monday] since everybody found out. I got a lot of phone calls and a lot of things from friends and family. It’s been a great time and everyone’s excited for me, and I’m excited to get out there.”\n\nOn Chicago as a city:\n\n“Everyone’s told me great things about Chicago, the city. Especially since it’s the place where [Michael] Jordan played and going in there with so much tradition and history it’s going to be fun to go out there and play every night and play in front of those fans.”\n\nBulls head coach Tom Thibodeau on Watson (via ESPN Chicago):\n\n“[Watson is] a terrific young player. [He has] the ability to back up the point and also play some 2. He’s very versatile in the sense that he can get the ball up the floor very quickly, make decisions, shoot the three and he’s a solid defender, he can defend two positions.”"
