        "text": "Neither Biedrins nor Anderson was his team’s star player. While O’Neal had problems shooting free throws throughout his career, he never stopped attacking the basket or looking for the ball. “I can only talk about myself for this, I personally wouldn’t or couldn’t allow myself to lose confidence,” said Hall of Famer Reggie Miller. “The reason being is teammates can sense that, when you’re a captain or team leader you have to be above the fray.” For role players, the stakes are different. “What motivated me was fear,” said former Raptors coach Sam Mitchell, who played 13 NBA seasons. “Fear of failure. Fear of embarrassing myself. That was my biggest fear, that I would embarrass myself. And so I worked hard so I could minimize my fear of embarrassment.”\n\n“I think it is (possible to get back to where he was),” Biedrins said. “I think physically I’m there. A lot has to do with just kind of believing in yourself more than I am. I’ve had frustrating years and you kind of stop believing in yourself so much as you did before – like three years ago. That’s the main reason. But I think I can get there.”\n\nBiedrins was the only Warriors player who didn’t participate in optional workouts earlier this month, and then coach Mark Jackson publicly expressed disappointment about it. But Biedrins was alongside his teammates on Monday, the first official day of training camp. “My commitment level has always been the same as it is now – and like it was before,” said Biedrins, entering his ninth NBA season. “That doesn’t mean just because I wasn’t here I wasn’t practicing. I was practicing hard, twice a day, for the past month. I feel great. As long as I can help, come in here in great shape at the start of training camp with the other guys, that’s almost the same thing.”\n\nBiedrins has been a colossal bust since signing his six-year, $62 million contract in 2008. With two years and some $18 million left on his deal, the once promising Biedrins seems to have sealed his fate with his head coach – or at least is starting in the same hole he’s been in for the last two years. League sources say the Warriors have tried in the past to talk contract buyout, and have tried trading his contract several times over the last two years and have found little interest in either course of action. While Jackson’s disappointment with Biedrins was clear, his support of oft-injured point guard Steph Curry was equally clear, especially when asked about the role of newly acquired guard Jarrett Jack.\n\nLatvia’s state prosecutor has opened a criminal case against Golden State Warriors center Andris Biedrins for alleged income tax evasion. Aiga Senberga, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office, says Biedrins and two others are suspects. She declined to identify the other two. Senberga said Monday that if Biedrins is found guilty he could face a fine of $70,000 or a maximum five-year prison sentence. She did not say how much Biedrins allegedly owes in taxes.\n\nGolden State Warriors’ center Andris Biedrins is facing tax evasion charges in his homeland Latvia, a prosecution official in the Baltic nation said on Monday. Aiga Senberga, spokeswoman for the Latvian state prosecutor’s office, confirmed to AFP that a case had been launched against the NBA player as a result of a request received from the country’s tax authorities."
