        "text": "The idea was sound and the goal overdue when the Warriors last spring vowed, for the umpteenth consecutive season, to add size.\n\nThey would get bigger and taller and longer, through the draft or a trade or free agency — or all three.\n\nAnd management followed through, delivering on the most conspicuous and long-standing of its unmet aspirations.\n\nGeneral manager Larry Riley and his staff got help for Andris Biedrins, the 7-footer from Latvia, whose six years in the NBA have been defined by evident promise, nagging injuries, steady rebounding, bouts of self-doubt and, most consistently, little support in the paint.\n\nYet Friday, when the New York Knicks show up to face the Warriors at Oracle Arena, Biedrins will be right back in the role he knows so well. In the middle, mostly alone, as smaller teammates scamper and flit about the floor.\n\n“Hey, it’s just like the last couple of years,” Biedrins said after practice Wednesday, laughing at the turn of events.\n\nDavid Lee, the 6-9, 240-pound power forward acquired in a sign-and-trade deal with the Knicks, started the first eight games but is out while receiving treatment for an infection. He hopes to return this month.\n\nEkpe Udoh (6-10, 245), drafted with the sixth overall pick, will continue to rehabilitate after undergoing surgery in July to repair torn ligaments in his wrist. He hopes to make his pro debut early next month.\n\nLou Amundson (6-9, 225), who signed as a free agent, still is mending after October surgery on his right index finger. He also could return next month.\n\n“It will be hard,” Biedrins says of his task over the next several games, “but I think guys will step up from the bench. Guys like Brandan (Wright) and Jeff Adrien. We need them, especially now that we’re missing D-Lee. We just have to fight through. It’s a chance for other guys to step up and show what they got.”\n\nIt’s also a chance for Biedrins to show, at 24, he’s ready to be the player he seemed on the verge of becoming three years ago. That season, he led the league in field-goal percentage (62.6) and finished 11th in rebounding (9.8). But the highlight was when he averaged 16 points and 15.7 rebounds over the final seven games as the Warriors sprinted to the finish in a failed attempt for a second consecutive playoffs appearance.\n\nTo return to that level, Biedrins also has to prove he’s beyond the psychological bruises inflicted by the withering public criticisms of former coach Don Nelson.\n\nThat’s where coach Keith Smart comes in. He realized upon replacing Nelson the importance of rebuilding the self-esteem of several players, none more than Biedrins. The new coach flew to Latvia last summer and spent 10 days with the center, working on drills and letting the conversation wander. “Two practices a day, every day, in the gym” Smart recalls. “Then we would sit and talk about life, what’s happening in his life and with his family.”\n\n“I have a great relationship with him,” Biedrins says. “Probably the best relationship of anybody on the team.”\n\nSo now it’s about turning this coexistence into production. Averaging 6.1 points and 9.2 rebounds, including a 20-rebound game two weeks ago in a win over Utah, Biedrins shows signs of finding himself.\n\n“We’re still trying to make sure he doesn’t get frustrated on the floor with the one thing he’s doing wrong,” Smart says, “when he’s doing 99 things well.”\n\nBiedrins got engaged last summer, while getting into “the best shape of my life.” Healthy and grounded, he ought to be able to handle challenges both immediate and long term. With four years and $36 million remaining on his contract, he says he wants to spend his entire career with the Warriors.\n\nThose sentiments should grow stronger once the cavalry arrives."
