        "text": "Detroit Pistons vs. Chicago Bulls, Las Vegas Summer League exhibition\n\nWhen: 6:30 p.m. ET Tuesday.\n\nWhere: Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.\n\nTV: NBA TV.\n\nStreaming: ESPN+.\n\nPistons lineup: TBA.\n\nREAD MORE: Forget Bobi Klintman's shooting for a moment: Passing may be the key for Pistons\n\nGame notes: The Detroit Pistons will be back on the floor again Tuesday for their second game in two nights.\n\nThe Pistons ran away from the Houston Rockets on Monday thanks to great performances from second-round pick Bobi Klintman and undrafted guard Daniss Jenkins, winning 87-73.\n\nFans looking to catch a glimpse of fifth overall pick Ron Holland were disappointed as the athletic wing was scratched from the lineup and didn't play. Initially, NBA TV reported the rookie was dealing with a sore right thumb, which is cause for concern because he had season-ending surgery on that thumb in February. However, a team spokesman told the Free Press that Holland missed the game for rest and they chose to sit him for the first leg of the back-to-back before playing the Bulls on Tuesday.\n\nAfter playing the Bulls on Tuesday, the Pistons will have Wednesday and Thursday off before returning to the floor Friday to take on the New York Knicks at 7 p.m. on ESPN."
