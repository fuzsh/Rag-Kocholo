        "text": "Andris Biedrins, his back to the rim, lunged into the chest of Al Jefferson at a Santa Barbara gym in September. With the Utah Jazz center back on his heels, Biedrins proceeded with ruthless precision, leaving Jefferson planted as he swished the turnaround jumper.\n\n“Al was like ‘What the hell? Who is this?’ ” recalled Ross McMains, a skills development coach who worked with the NBA big men during the lockout.\n\nThe Warriors can only hope Biedrins elicits such reactions all season long. After Biedrins turned in the worst two seasons of his career and endured leaguewide derision for his loss of confidence at the free-throw line, the Warriors need their well-paid center to bounce back.\n\n“I told him I believe in him,” new coach Mark Jackson said. “He will have every opportunity to get back what he once had.”\n\nTwo years removed from his breakout season of 2008-09 (11.9 points, 11.2 rebounds per game), Biedrins regressed to 5 points and 7.4 rebounds a game last season. He struggled battling back from injuries, watched his production fall, became a free-throw punch line and could only watch and wait as the Warriors publicly hunted to replace him.\n\nBut the maturation that comes with becoming a father combined with a collaborative effort between the Warriors and BDA Sports has fueled a resurgence. The work was designed to remake the $9 million man back into what he once was — a quality starting center.\n\nAt this point, the Warriors brass only whispers about his progress, afraid to mess with it. But the buzz heading into Saturday’s exhibition opener at Oracle Arena against Sacramento can be best described by three words from point guard Stephen Curry: “Dre is back.”\n\n“I worked as hard as I’ve ever worked,” said, Biedrins, 25, entering his eighth season. “I got my life together. Had a son. There was a lockout, so I had a long offseason. Everything just came together. It was the perfect time to work on everything.”\n\nThe first step in Biedrins’ renovation was to get him healthy. The past two seasons were plagued by injury. The 2009-10 campaign was marred by abdomen issues, and last season was tarnished by two left ankle sprains.\n\nInjuries accounted for a total of 72 games missed in two years and numerous other games hampered by injury.\n\nSurgery and rehabilitation with a specialist in Vancouver, British Columbia, in the summer of 2010 cured the sports hernia. This past offseason, six weeks at the renowned Peak Performance Project in Santa Barbara took care of the ankle. He said his time at the sports science center also resulted in 15 extra pounds of muscle, four more inches on his vertical leap and better agility.\n\n“Yeah, I can say I’m 100 percent,” Biedrins said. “I did what I had to do, and I think I did it really well.”\n\nIn addition to getting on point physically, Biedrins had to get back in mental shape. His poor free-throw shooting — which plummeted from 55.1 percent in 2008-09 to 16 percent in 2009-10 — by most accounts took away his aggression. Getting his percentage up to 32.3 percent wasn’t enough to stem the ridicule.\n\n“He wasn’t happy with losing and being unsuccessful,” Warriors general manager Larry Riley said. “He was tired of losing and I think he felt like he was being blamed for it.”\n\nTo that end, the Warriors recommended Biedrins see a sports psychologist, and he agreed.\n\nBiedrins went to Toronto to meet with Dr. Dana Sinclair, who helped him block out the negative and taught him how to breathe for maximum focus.\n\n“I was willing to do anything,” Biedrins said. “It helped a lot.”\n\nBiedrins said getting his personal life in order was also a big help. The birth of his son, Emils, and his recent engagement stabilized his life and buffers him from the relentless criticism.\n\nAnother big help: his new coach.\n\nAlong with emphasizing to Biedrins that he believed in him, Jackson simplified Biedrins’ role.\n\nUnlike Don Nelson, Jackson said he doesn’t care about Biedrins’ free throws. Unlike Keith Smart, Jackson said he isn’t looking to Biedrins for inside scoring. He told Biedrins simply to play to his strengths — rebound, block shots and run the floor.\n\n“He definitely feels better about Mark Jackson,” his agent Bill Duffy said. “And he likes the culture there now.”\n\nWhat also helps are the changes the Warriors have made. New ownership, new front office management, new coaching staff — Biedrins said it all feels like a new start. He said he even feels a bit like a rookie having to prove he belongs.\n\nNow, he is motivated instead of discouraged. That’s why the Warriors’ open courtship of big men, namely Tyson Chandler and DeAndre Jordan, proved more inspiring than bothersome.\n\n“You hear those names and you say, ‘No. No. I’m better than him,’ ” Biedrins said. “Now is my chance.”\n\nThe real test doesn’t begin until Dec. 25. In his first three games, he’ll face Jordan, Joakim Noah and Chandler.\n\n“Some people believe in me, but a lot of people gave up on me,” Biedrins said. “I totally understand why they did that. But I’m still here and I can still prove them wrong, prove that I can be the guy who I was.”\n\nThe Warriors concluded their offseason signings by claiming second-year point guard Ish Smith off waivers on Friday. Smith — a speedy 6-foot, 175-pound floor general out of Wake Forest — was waived by Memphis on Wednesday. Last season, he averaged 10.3 minutes in 43 games, most of them with Houston."
