        "text": "Warriors center Andris Biedrins will miss the upcoming four-game trip because of a severe left ankle sprain.\n\nBiedrins suffered the injury in the third quarter of Wednesday’s loss to Dallas. He will not travel with the team.\n\nBiedrins — who has been the subject of rampant criticism for his play this season — was having a relatively good game before he went down: seven points, eight rebounds and a steal in 22 minutes.\n\n“I was feeling so terrible after that,” Biedrins said. “Finally, it was going for me, at least one game. I was happy with how I was playing, feeling well. We were up and playing well. All things were coming together. Now something else came up.”\n\nBiedrins said he wasn’t sure how he the injury occurred. He thinks he tripped over someone and said he knew right away it was pretty bad because of how far his ankle bent.\n\nBiedrins limped off the court and did not return. It’s the same ankle he sprained at practice Dec. 16, forcing him to miss the next nine games. He said this injury is as bad as his previous one.\n\nBiedrins is averaging 5.0 points and 7.2 rebounds in 23.7 minutes. His 53.4 field goal percentage is a career low. Across the board, Biedrins’ numbers this season are similar to those in 2009-10, when an abdominal injury limited him to 33 games.\n\nRookie Ekpe Udoh is expected to start in Biedrins’ place.\n\nCoach Keith Smart experimented with Udoh as the starting center during the seven-game trip earlier this month. Smart said he was using the change to take some pressure off Biedrins.\n\nThe experiment lasted four games. As a starter, Udoh averaged 3.5 points on 40 percent shooting with 3.0 rebounds. He did have seven blocks in those four games, but Udoh said he must play better this time around — especially on offense.\n\n“I’ve been struggling,” Udoh said. “I’ve just got to get it going. I’ve got to be aggressive. I make post moves all day, but I’ve got to finish them.”\n\nPoint guard Stephen Curry has a sore right elbow but said he’ll be fine to play at Phoenix on Friday.\n\nThe Warriors announced that rookie guard Jeremy Lin was reassigned to the Reno Bighorns of the NBA Development League. Lin has appeared in 16 games over two stints with the Bighorns this season. With the Warriors, Lin has appeared in 23 games, averaging 1.9 points, 1.1 assists and 1.1 steals in 8.7 minutes per contest."
