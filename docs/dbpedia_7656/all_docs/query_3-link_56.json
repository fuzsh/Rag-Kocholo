        "text": "Peggy “PJ” Mann was an amazingly resilient woman. A loving wife, proud mother, and devoted grandmother she modeled a lifetime of being genuine and kind to each and every person she met. Peggy held many special gifts and talents including sewing and gardening. She cherished her growing family and wanted nothing but the best for each and every one of them. The wonderful memories she leaves behind will forever be etched on the hearts of her many special friends and loved ones for generations to come.\n\nPeggy Jane arrived on January 17, 1934, on the brink of what would later be recognized as the turning point in the Great Depression in America. As President Roosevelt led the nation and unemployment began to decline, her Canadian immigrant parents, Charles Randolph and Clara Alice (Orser) Hatfield welcomed her into their loving arms at Grace Hospital in Detroit, Michigan. Growing up in Royal Oak where her parents managed a local grocery store, they instilled in her the value of a hard day’s work at an early age.\n\nPJ’s extraordinary life began in unprecedented times. At the tender age of two years old she suffered hearing loss from a mastoid operation. Despite the impact of the Great Depression, her mother never failed to purchase a new dress for her at the Kresge Department store each week during her Kindergarten year. As a young child, she lived a typical childhood of the times enjoying hopscotch, playing jacks, jumping rope, and biking around the neighborhood. With a large family of relatives, her family returned to New Brunswick, Canada many times to visit. Later her father took up real estate and her mother worked in retail for JL Hudson's department store. PJ was an active teen playing tennis and performing as a majorette in her high school marching band. Born the oldest of three daughters, PJ had the usual sibling frustrations. Once while cruising Woodward Avenue with her dear friend, Aggie, her younger sister, Marcia who was hiding in the backseat, jumped up and surprised them demanding they take her to the Totem Pole restaurant and buy her a Coke! Following in the strong work ethic of her parents, after graduation, PJ began working at the Wayne Oakland County Bank.\n\nNot to be forgotten was the meeting of Charles Mann. Spotting one another across the dance floor at the local YMCA, they hit it off right from the start. They joined in marriage in 1954 at St. Johns Episcopal Church in Royal Oak. Over the course of the next fourteen years, their lives were involved with welcoming home and raising five wonderful children: Peggy, Sandy Ann, Bonnie, Nancy and Charles. There was never a dull moment during her child-rearing years. Active in her children’s lives, she coordinated school events, transported them to piano lessons, as well as helped to renovate their Civil War aged home. Her family was her greatest treasure. Sadly, their twenty-year marriage ended tragically when Chuck was involved in an accident. Never one to complain, PJ went back to work at the National City Bank in Howell in order to provide for her family. Remarkably she drew on her inner strength managing to create many memorable moments in her children’s lives including saving up for a visit to Disney World.\n\nRetiring in 1999 she then generously spent time supporting her family with gardening, housework, as well as, babysitting for her grandchildren. She treasured decorating for her favorite holiday, Christmas. No holiday was ever complete without her famous green slime jello! Her craziest holiday, however, was Mardi Gras with her son-in-law that was not the southern home tour that she imagined. Retirement also afforded her the time to travel with her family. She joined her son’s family on a trip to the Bahamas aboard the Norwegian Majesty, toured New York City seeing Wicked on Broadway as well as July 4th fireworks in the Hamptons with her oldest daughter’s family, and also attended Cirque Du Soleil’s “O” in Las Vegas for a memorable 65th birthday with her daughters. Her favorite city, however, was Chicago, Illinois where she visited Bonnie and enjoyed visiting the Princess Diana Dress exhibit a few years ago.\n\nPJ always looked on the bright side of life and enjoyed many favorite pastimes. She enjoyed many years as a member of an area garden club where she made beautiful Christmas centerpieces. She loved watching HGTV and Downton Abbey, and Johnny Carson was a favorite from her earlier years. When it came time for relaxation, she would read a good novel or poetry. She was delighted to take anyone on a tour around Plymouth showing off all the adorable homes in the area. Not one to like cooking, PJ did, however, perfect her delicious lasagna. Her favorite dishes, however, were often a Maurice salad or a Saunders ice cream sundae. PJ leaves behind her beautiful family as a reflection of her earnest love and greatest accomplishment. There is no doubt that she will be deeply missed and lovingly remembered by all who knew her. May her loved ones seek comfort by holding her precious memories close to their hearts.\n\nPeggy Mann, age 85, passed away January 31, 2019. Beloved wife of the late Charles Griffidus Mann. Cherished mother of Peggy (Michael) Kelley, Sandy Kutey, Bonnie (Mindaugas) Macius, Nancy (Barry) Johnson, and Charles (Jennifer) Mann. Dearest grandmother of 12, great-grandmother of 10 and a half. Loving sister of Marcia (Ross) Graham and Sandy (Robert) Ramee. A visitation will be held on Saturday, February 9th at Neely-Turowski Funeral Home, 45100 Warren Road, Canton from 11 am until the time of service at 12. Memorial contributions to Angela Hospice are appreciated."
