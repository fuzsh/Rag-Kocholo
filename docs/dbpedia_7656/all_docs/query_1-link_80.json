While Manley was the bigger character and overall all-better pass rusher, Mann was a consistent leader who showed up every year and gave Pro Bowl-caliber seasons yearly.\n\nCharles Mann and Dexter Manley\n\nCharles Andre Mann played in 163 games over the span of an 11-year career in Washington that netted him 82 sacks and 784 tackles as a Redskins player. Mann was a born leader who was drafted in the third round of the 1983 draft by the Redskins. His best year was in 1985, when he registered 14.5 sacks and 85 tackles.\n\nDexter Keith Manley (A.K.A. “The Secretary of Defense”) was an outspoken guy who, unlike Mann, was a bit cocky. In his 125 games that spanned 9 seasons, Manley recorded 91 sacks; he had 18.5 in 1986, his best year. Although his career is tainted in some ways due to his battles with drugs and crime away from the football field, Manley is still held close to the hearts of Redskins fans.\n\nTogether these two men combined for 173 sacks and are number one and number two on the Redskins all-time sack leaders list. Both were selected to the 70 Greatest Redskins of all-time team and are members of the Washington Redskins Ring of Fame.\n\nSo the question is…which one was better? What’s your opinion?\n\nWhile you ponder that thought, here’s a video featuring Charles Mann & Dexter Manley"
