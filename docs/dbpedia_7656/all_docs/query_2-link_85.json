        "text": "Brian Paul Kaess ,\n\nThanks for posting on History Hub!\n\nThis is quite an interesting life! You have quite a lot of information on him, but he also appears difficult to locate in records. I see there is both a 1917 Draft Registration and a 1942 Draft Registration for him in his full name as Charles Mann Dawson. Yet he is not readily located in the US Census aside from the 1900 Census when he was 11 years old.\n\nThe 1917 draft registration states that he was a musician employed by E. Halgren and lived at 1922 Dodge, Omaha, Nebraska with an unnamed wife. He also claimed no military service. The date of birth is off a little from what you stated, but this may still be the same person. If you have not checked local records in Omaha, Douglas County, Nebraska, that may be a good step. You may find assistance from the Omaha Public Library or FamilySearch's wiki page for Douglas County, Nebraska records.\n\nIf he did serve with the Navy, there should be a record. Given his young age, might it be possible he used an alias and/or changed his date of birth? It may also be possible he worked on board ships as a musician, but not as an enlisted man? The S.S. Manchuria was only commissioned for Navy service from April 1918 to September 1919, as seen in the Wikipedia entry for for it.\n\nAnother instance of his full name being used verifies your mention that he was reunited with his family in 1915, as can easily be found in the Library of Congress' Chronicling America includes that story from the Topeka State Journal. As not all newspapers are freely available online with digital searches, it may be worth looking for other news stories in Omaha, Salt Lake City, and in Reno, as they are places you know he worked.\n\nIf there is no biography, it seems your Granduncle may well deserve one!\n\nHe seems like a puzzle that having input from others will assist you, and hopefully our community here can respond as well.\n\nWe hope this helps some towards your research, and wish you luck in carrying this further on."
