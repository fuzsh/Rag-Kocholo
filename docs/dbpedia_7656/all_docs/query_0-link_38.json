Edward, or Ted as he was commonly known, had one older brother, Henry, and two younger sisters, Nellie and Heather. His father, a wharf labourer, showed no love or affection toward his children. Ted remembers his mother being very sick and that was about all; she died when he was five. His father couldnt manage to look after the children and said he was going to take them for a drive.\n\nTed vividly recalls being all dressed up in their finest clothes and believing they were going on a picnic. His father drove them to a large forbidding stone building, the Geelong Protestant Orphanage. There were no goodbyes, just a warning to behave, and his father left. Ted never forgot those yearssix and a half years of beatings, starvation and hell. And Ted never forgave his father.\n\nAfter his father left, Ted cried for days. He gradually adjusted to living with about fifty boys and sleeping in a dormitory with twelve others. His education at the orphanage was almost non-existent, one room for eight classes and only one teacher.\n\nEach woman carer at the orphanage, dressed in a grey nurse-like uniform, carried a strap on her belt. The carers didnt hesitate to use it if they thought the boys had broken a rule or played mischief. Bruise marks on their bodies were common. Even leaving food behind on their plates warranted a beating. The monotonous diet of lumpy porridge for breakfast and boiled mutton, rice and pumpkin for lunch did nothing to whet the appetite. Kids transferred pieces of boiled pumpkin onto other plates or threw the pumpkin under the table or even hid it in their pockets rather than eat it.\n\nWhen hunger pains hit them at night-time the kids sometimes raided the kitchen pantry and ate the fresh bread reserved for the staff. They also sneaked into the dairy and pinched the sweet corn kept as fodder for the cows. Cream from the milk was kept for making butter and this was sold to raise money to run the orphanage. The skim milk ended up in the kitchen for the childrens porridge and occasionally mixed with bread to use up some of the left over scraps. One of the girls at the orphanage was put on a bread and water diet. She lost the will to live and refused to eat at all. She died a short time afterno one seemed to care about her.\n\nThere were plenty of jobs to do like scrubbing the concrete paths on hands and knees or rummaging through the boiler house for pieces of unburnt coke.\n\nTheir father visited them once a month and the children always asked, When can we come home?\n\nAfter six and a half years, and when Ted was thirteen, the children returned home when their father remarried a woman who gave them the ultimate choice: Behave or back to the orphanage.\n\nTed left school the day he was fourteen and began work at the local woollen mills at twelve shillings and sixpence a week. At sixteen he worked on a Tasmanian schooner, the MV Coomonderry, as a deck boy. The schooner transported supplies to Tasmania and brought timber back to the mainland. Despite the hard work Ted welcomed the change in life. He soon adjusted to the heavy pitching and rolling of the ship across Bass Strait and to life on board.\n\nTed worked on the Coomonderry for three years until he became an able seaman. No one could fault his work. He pumped diesel fuel to the tanks on deck, made sure the bilge pumps were in working order and kept the engine room clean. He also took his turn at the wheelhouse.\n\nOn one occasion the schooner sprang a leak in the bottom when a rivet fell out of one of the plates. Ted and the captain rigged up another pump and worked like Trojans to keep the water from swamping the engine room. They just made it to Smithton and later to dry dock in Launceston where the bilge was cleaned out and repairs completed.\n\nTed earned five pounds a month as an able seaman and the wage rose to twenty pounds after he left the Coomonderry. He joined the union and sailed on a number of ships before signing on with the MV Minnipaa gulf boat sailing out of Adelaide carrying passengers and cargo to Port Lincoln on Eyre Peninsula. He was a crewmember of that ship for ten years. He also sailed on the ketch Defender and the twin-screw ship Wombat.\n\nIn the six-monthly certificates, the captain endorsed Teds honest and hardworking character, and his exemplary standard as an able seaman. His easy-going manner, good humour and rough way of talking struck a chord with his fellow seamen. For Ted it was one of the best times of his life.\n\nTeds father was still a wharfie when he died; he left his house to his next-door neighbour. At the funeral Ted cried openly, not because of any love for his father but because of what he had done to his children.\n\nWhile working on the Minnipa he met Yvonne at a dance in the Port Adelaide Town Hall. He escorted her to the front gate of her Cheltenham home and kissed her good night. Yvonnes mother invited Ted for tea the following night and from that time love blossomed.\n\nYvonne, a shy person, was born in Adelaide on 2 December 1929. She grew up in the Cheltenham home that her parents built in 1924 and went to school in Pennington with her sister, Rhonda. She left school at fourteen and worked at the Vidale pastry factory and then as a salesperson in supermarkets at Pennington and Hindmarsh. Yvonnes father was a wharf labourer and drove delivery horses. He ended up as a greenkeeper at Alberton Oval. Her mother, Australian-born, looked after the home.\n\nYvonne met Ted when she was sixteen and they courted for five years before marrying on 25 February 1950. During their five years of courting, Ted was often away on some of the larger ships for weeks on end. At one time he worked on Australias biggest iron ore carrier, the Iron Yampi. It sailed the black and tan run from Whyalla to Newcastle carrying iron ore and, on the return trip, coal. Later, Ted joined the motor vessel Moonta that sailed the gulf trip. The vessel docked at Port Adelaide harbour each week and Yvonne and Ted were able to have at least a day together.\n\nAfter deciding to settle down in Adelaide with Yvonne, Ted found jobs as a wharfie, night patrolman, sewage worker, and machine operator at General Motors Holden. Then he became a spray-painter at Wilsons, in the suburb of Cheltenham. Yvonne and Ted raised three sons and a daughter.\n\nIt was common practice for seamen and wharf workers to steal cargo such as beer and cigarettes, and also to receive stolen goods. Ted was no exception and carried his pilfering activities over into civilian life. He received jail sentences for two serious convictions of shop breaking and larceny. His last conviction was in 1969 when Justice Mitchell sentenced him to a year and nine months. Ted had broken into a tobacconist shop at Port Adelaide by severing the bars that covered a rear window and forcing the window open.\n\nHow much Teds criminal convictions went against him when he was arrested for the murder of a woman who lived near his home and opposite his workplace, no one will ever know.\n\nTop of Page\n\nThe materials on this site are the copyright of Networked Knowledge.
