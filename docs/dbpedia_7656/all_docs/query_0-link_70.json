        "text": "Stanford Grant Ellsworth, April 24, 1933 ~ September 12, 2019\n\nA valiant warrior has returned home, and Heaven has gained another mighty angel. We thank God for the gift of this magnificent man as husband, father, grandfather, great-grandfather (pop pop), friend, and hero. He returned to the loving arms of his Heavenly Father on Thursday, September 12th, at 8:20 PM. Now that we have lost one of the kindest, most Christlike, caring, and loving men we have ever known, we have not enough words to sufficiently honor him or to fully express our love, but we will say this: if we can be half the person he was, we will count our lives a grand success! He lived a true Christian life. He set the example and led the way, and we will miss his wisdom and counsel, his strength and loyalty, his quick-witted humor, his southern charm, and the mischievous twinkle in his eye.\n\nBorn in Washington DC to German Smith Ellsworth and Adelaide Grant, Dad’s mother died from complications in childbirth. He and his twin brother, Sterling, were raised for a time by their paternal grandparents, German Edgar Ellsworth and Mary Rachel Smith, until their father remarried (Myra Mann). Dad spent his youth in the Bethesda/Chevy Chase area of Maryland while his father served in the Roosevelt administration. He spent his summers in Salt Lake City, where he contracted, fought, and defeated polio. His high school years were completed while living in San Francisco with his grandparents…German Edgar Ellsworth and Mary Rachel Smith. Following high school, he attended BYU and served in the Southern States Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. During the Korean War, Dad volunteered for service in Korea with the US Army.\n\nUpon returning stateside, Dad met the love of his life, Judith Ann Malzahn, a young nurse at LDS Hospital, as she tended to his grandfather, German Edgar Ellsworth! They were sealed for time and all eternity in the Idaho Falls LDS Temple on August 30, 1957. That’s 62 years of faithful marriage! Well done, Mom and Dad! Their life together has been a true love story filled with adventure, service, marvels, and miracles from the hand of God.\n\nDad and his new bride returned to BYU where he completed degrees in business and family counseling. He became a valued and highly sought-after business consultant, working with companies such as Boeing, Ampex, and IBM. But his passion was health care, and he received a Master’s of Hospital Administration from George Washington University in Washington, DC. He was the Administrator of Anne Arundel Hospital in Annapolis, Maryland, and Pocono Hospital in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania. He started the visionary business “Primedical,” the first privately owned foray into freestanding instant-care clinics, which later became part of IHC. After his retirement from the private sector, Dad was invited to join the LDS Foundation as Vice President of Corporate Gifts, and later worked directly under the Presiding Bishopric.\n\nDad and Mom loved the seaside and enjoyed living on the East Coast near the Chesapeake Bay and Atlantic Ocean for over 20 years. As a family we spent many summers at the beach in Nag’s Head, North Carolina; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; and all over Florida. In their later years, they often visited the turquoise waters of Cancun, Mexico -- Dad’s favorite!\n\nBut our father’s greatest delight was service to his God. He was an active, life-long member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, wherein he served as a seminary teacher, youth leader, Branch President, Bishop, High Councilor, and Stake Presidency member. His greatest joy was serving in the temple. He was honored to serve as the Assistant Recorder in the Washington DC Temple, and was also ordained as a Patriarch and sealer under the hand of Elder M. Russel Ballard. He served as the Patriarch of two stakes, and was a sealer in the Washington DC, Jordan River, and Draper Temples. Our father’s ministry truly touched the lives of thousands of Heavenly Father’s children on both sides of the veil.\n\nDad is survived by his wife, Judy, his sons, Stanford (Stacey), Scott (Laura), and Gregg, 15 Grandchildren, 13 Great-grandchildren, his brothers Sterling and John, and his sister Sharon. He was preceded in death by his daughter, Linda Elaine (Kenneth Byington), his sister Elaine (Garth Naylor), and his brothers Richard and Charles.\n\nA viewing and reception will be held at the Eastdell LDS chapel at 9855 South 2300 East in Sandy, Utah, from 7:00 to 9:00 PM on Thursday, September 19th. The funeral service will be held at the same location at 12:30 PM on Friday, September 20th. Interment to follow at the Utah Veterans Cemetery and Memorial Park, Bluffdale, Utah."
