The cause of his death was diarrhoea.\n\nGeneral Notes:\n\nI am indebted to Mr Bob Howlett who is the source of much of this data on the George Robert Hughes family. Bob's excellent Family History Website can be found on http://users.tpg.com.au/havik/genealogy/MFFFP.html\n\nBaptisms at the Parish Church Leeds of September 1800 (West Yorks)\n\nFather: James Hughes; Address: Ebeneza Street; Bap: Aug 28; Named: George.\n\nOccupation: formerly - Tailor; latterly - Commission Agent\n\nResided: Adelaide, Nairne, North Adelaide, Walkerville\n\n(image of George Robert Hughes courtesy of T Hughes)\n\nDuring an interview with a journalist in 1908 William Frederick Hughes remembers the family's arrival at Adelaide in 1840 - excerpts as follows:\n\n\"Our family came to South Australia in 1840 by the Diadem, sailed by Captain Hartland, he said. My father consulted ex Governor Hindmarsh in England and obtained from him a letter of introduction to Mrs. Hindmarsh who was still in Adelaide. He also obtained letters to Mr. E. J. Eyre from his father and sister.\"\n\n\"So with his wife and four sons, he left for Australia.\"\n\n\"We reached Port Adelaide in November, 1840.\"\n\n\"Adelaide was then in a very primitive condition.\"\n\n\"After searching for some time my father secured a couple of lean-to back rooms at a rental of 14/- a week. These we occupied until we removed to a place near the Rob Roy in Halifax-street, belonging to Jemmy Crink. Mr. Eyre was then in Western Australia, and pending his return my father joined the late Mr. John Johnstone in the service of Tailor White, whose shop was in Hindley-street, next the Royal Admiral.\"\n\n\"On the return of Mr. E. J. Eyre from the West my father entered his service and removed to a house in Rundle street that belonged to him. When Mr. Eyre went to his station at Moorundie, just below Blanchetown on the Murray, our family accompanied him. My father at the time was recognised as a member of the police service, and did duty.\"\n\n\"Two bullock teams left Adelaide on that expedition, the one belonging to Mr. Eyre, and the other being the property of the South Australian Government. We got along very well considering. The first night we camped at Gawler near the police station. At the end of the second day we reached Leak's station where Jeremiah Robin and Inspector Shaw joined the party. Our next camp was at Bagot's beyond Kapunda where my mother was visited by Mrs. Bagot and her two daughters who spoke encouragingly but expressed surprise that a woman could be found with courage enough to venture out into such wild country as the Murray then was. The end of the fourth day brought us to Black Springs, near Truro. The pound on the River Murray was reached at 10 o'clock at night of the fifth day.\"\n\n\"On the day following we reached Moorundie and had great difficulty in getting to the station over the cliffs. After we had been there a fortnight the Water Witch cutter came up the river, commanded by Lieutenant Pullen (afterwards Admiral Pullen).\"\n\n\"We remained on the station four or five months during which time we lived in tents. The first reed hut on the river was erected while we were there.\"\n\n\"A little ploughing for wheat was done on the flats but we left before it had matured. While we were at Moorundie Governor Grey, Mrs. Grey, Lieutenant Mundy, and Captain Sturt, spent about a week at the station. They went up the river as far as the Rufus and broke their journey at Moorundie on their return.\"\n\n\"News reached Moorundie before we started for the city, that the shed in which practically everything that our family possessed was stored when we went to the bush, had been totally destroyed by fire. This was a serious loss to beginners in a new country.\"\n\n\"On our return to Adelaide my father rented a house in Queen-street.\"\n\n\"Our family left Adelaide for Nairne in 1845.\"\n\nSouth Australian Gazette and Mining Journal (Adelaide) Saturday 31 March 1849\n\nPost Office Contracts - Mail contracts accepted of for the year 1849-50.\n\nName of Contractor; Route; Amount.\n\nGeorge Hughes; Mount Barker to Kanmantoo bi-weekly; £52.00.\n\nSouth Australian Register (Adelaide) Friday 14 June 1850\n\nLOCAL COURTS.\n\nColonial Secretary's Office, June 11, 1850.\n\nIn virtue of the power vested in the Lieut.-Governor by the 4th clause of Ordinance No. 5, of 1850, \"For the recovery of Small Debts, and Trial and Punishment of Minor Offences in South Australia,\" his Excellency has been pleased to make the following appointments in the several Local Courts undermentioned, viz :-\n\nCourt at Gawler Town-Clerk, Mr Henry Calton; Bailiff, Mr William Square.\n\nCourt at Kooringa - Bailiff, Mr John Saunders.\n\nCourt at Mount Barker - Bailiff, Mr George Robert Hughes.\n\nBy his Excellency's command, Chas.
