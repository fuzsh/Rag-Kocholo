        "text": "This year, Jazz Along the Charles is a celebration of the unique artistry and profound impact of women in music. By sharing their contributions to jazz and other styles, we honor their legacies and provide a stage for their work to be heard and appreciated. This event not only entertains and engages the audience, but also showcases the diverse talent of musicians in the Boston area, and fosters a deeper understanding and appreciation for the immense talent and creative genius of legendary women composers and entertainers.\n\nOur goal as co-curators was to select music that was related in some way to Boston, whether based on the title, composer, subject matter, or artist. We also thought it powerful to focus on works composed or popularized by Boston-connected women. We further wanted to be sure that the material would lend itself to the improvisational and expressive essence of jazz, such that it could be interpreted by each performing ensemble in their own way.\n\nIt was a goal to include a diverse collection of material from diverse artists and composers, addressing style, period, etc.. Another goal was to include a mix of well-known and lesser-known pieces.\n\nWe look forward to being surprised and delighted by a wide range of interpretations and treatments of this collection of music by some wonderful and incredibly creative improvisational jazz musicians! And we are super excited that the ensembles will kick off the afternoon with world premiere performances of Terri Lyne Carrington’s composition “Bay Warriors”, commissioned by Celebrity Series specifically for this event!\n\nThrough the power of music, Jazz Along the Charles aims to inspire and uplift both musicians and audiences. By highlighting the rich diversity and depth of women’s contributions to the music industry, we hope to inspire a new generation of musicians to explore, embrace, and carry forward this vital musical heritage.\n\n- Zahili & Ken\n\n1.
