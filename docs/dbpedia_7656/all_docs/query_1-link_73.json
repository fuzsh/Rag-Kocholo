        "text": "Celebrating our achievements as entrepreneurs can feel cringe. 🫠 What we’re building at Claddagh Creative is about people. They are the heart of the business + why I do what I do. Everyday I: 🍀 Get to work with clients with a PURPOSE who have true stories to tell + burning desires to do good. 🍀 Get to work with my team. I’ve truly struck gold in this department. They are talented, yes. But they are also the kindest, funniest + most amazing people. I mean, look at us (Anna Wrigley, Bethany Gilligan + I) with our gorgeous knit kits from our incredible client Kristen Lambert. Not only was it a special team moment, but it reminded me of home + family. Back in Ireland, we’d learn to knit at school + my Grandmother would handknit handbags + blankets for me. It was such a family tradition, but since moving to the U.K. I haven’t touched a stitch. Working with clients like Kristen + her business Third Piece sets my soul on fire. At uni, it was drilled into me that I’d have to work with people I don’t like. Put up with it. 👀 Ermm, nope - not true! (Most of the time…) I believe if you do good, you attract good. 🌎 ➡️ We only work with sustainable + ethical brands. ➡️ We hire team members + take on new clients with a values-first approach. We’re not here for the toxic vibes + so far, we’ve created something truly positive and amazing (If I do say so myself!) So yeah, just a little appreciation post. I’m so so proud of following my heart on this one. Go on, celebrate your latest win in the comments!\n\n👠✨ Doubt Tried to Sneak In, But My Confidence Kicked It Out in Stilettos✨👠 When I first embarked on my entrepreneurial journey with StarStruck by Sunny Leone, many questioned whether a glamorous face in the entertainment world could translate into the competitive world of cosmetics. But let me tell you, confidence is more than just a pose; it's a way of life. With Starstruck, I didn't just create a range of cosmetics; I crafted a symbol of empowerment, a palette of self-expression. Each product is a reflection of determination, creativity, and a fierce refusal to be pigeonholed. Yes, there were doubts, there were hurdles. But every time doubt tried to sneak in, my confidence, clad in metaphorical stilettos, kicked it right out. Just like in a perfect dance move, timing, rhythm, and passion played their part in this success story. For those of you starting your ventures or facing obstacles in your career path, never underestimate the power of self-belief. Own your story, stride with confidence, and watch how the world makes way for you. Join me in celebrating not just a brand but a philosophy that stands tall and sparkling, just like a pair of stilettos. Let's be Starstruck together! 💫 #cosmetics #business #enterpreneurs\n\nI did something SUPER outside of my comfort zone earlier in the month. 🔥 I agreed to be a model for a large NZ nail salon. And honestly it has been SO much fun so far! I've even been out of town for a grand opening and to film commercials! But in doing so I realised that I literally manifested the opportunity many moons ago! I remember being a kid and being obsessed with watching America's Next Top Model and thinking how much fun it looked. Then the Dolly Model Search came to town and I wished I could enter, but at that time I was far too scared of what people would think. Who is she to think she could be a model? What on earth would you want to do that for? You totally aren't pretty enough to be a model! What if people think you look silly? Plus I also assumed that at 5'3\" I was absolutely not model material!! 😅 And here we are 20 years later and 14 year old Sarah would be SO proud of everything that I've accomplished. I've been a model now, not only for multiple clothing companies as part of my blog, but now as a model for a large company. 14 year old Sarah would literally be screaming right now. 😅 This is just a reminder that we are ALWAYS manifesting. But that we will never get what we want unless we actually step out of our comfort zone and SHOW the universe that we are ready. Doing this opens up so many opportunities that you might just not realise you needed at the time. What is it you are manifesting right now? Where could you take the leap and prove that you’re ready for what is to come? #holisticbusiness #manifesting #manifestation #businessenergetics #businessenergy #womeninbusiness #fempreneur #girlsinmarketing #momsinbusiness #nzentrepreneur #nzbusiness\n\n#Mondaymotivation and #inspiration from Samantha and Stephanie, Co-Founders of the award-winning, British fashion brand, Pretty Lavish \"Our Dad inspired us to succeed.\" 🦉 Best Business Tip... \"Hire for culture rather than experience, and know your numbers.\" 🚀 Our Best Decision... \"To invest in our own designs. That was a game changer for us as a business and was when the brand took off.\" 🙌 Our Hero... \"Our mum, Elaine, who showed so much resilience to get through the period when Dad died, and to get us through it, too. She is so kind and just completely selfless.\" 10 years on, Pretty Lavish continues to grow from strength to strength. With the support of their amazing team, Samantha and Stephanie are growing their community and well on their way to establishing a global brand. 10 Questions with our founders to celebrate 10 years of Pretty Lavish 🥂 https://lnkd.in/e-HaGUsy #success #mindsetforsuccess #mindsetmatters #mindsetmonday #motivationalmonday #motivation #inspireothers #inspirational #inspirationalleaders #teamappreciation #communitymatters #awardwinning #awardwinningteam #founderstory #successstory #brandleadership #fashion #entrepreneurship #entrepreneurs #businessowners #resilience #keeplearningkeepgrowing #thrive\n\nIntroducing our small business of the month of May 🥁🥁🥁 Oddly Brewed! \"Oddly Brewed is a coastal lifestyle brand specializing in handcrafted soy candles and beach-inspired jewelry. It was founded in 2020 by me, Haley, a student, digital creator, and artist based in Monmouth County, New Jersey.\" As a business owner, what is the most challenging thing you handle? \"As a business owner, one of the most challenging things I handle is balancing the creative aspects of my work with the logistical and administrative tasks that come with running a business. On one hand, I need to focus on designing and crafting our products, which is where my passion lies. On the other hand, I also have to manage the business operations, including inventory, marketing, customer service, and finances. This constant juggling act requires effective time management and the ability to adapt quickly to changing demands. It can be overwhelming, but it’s also incredibly rewarding to see my vision come to life.\" What's the most rewarding part? \"The most rewarding part of running Oddly Brewed is seeing the joy and connection my products bring to customers. I love hearing from people who tell me how much they enjoy my candles and jewelry, and how these items have become a meaningful part of their lives. Whether it’s a candle that creates a cozy atmosphere in someone’s home or a piece of jewelry that reminds them of a favorite beach, knowing that my creations can make someone’s day a little brighter is truly fulfilling. It’s also incredibly gratifying to see the growth of my business and realize that I’m turning my passion into a career.\" #SmallBusiness #SmallBiz #NJ #Beach #SmallBizOfTheMonth #OddlyBrewed #Candle #Jewelry #CoastalLifestyle #Handcrafted #SoyCandles #BeachInspired #MonmouthCounty #DigitalCreator #Artist #BusinessOwner #CreativeEntrepreneur #SmallBusinessOwner\n\nMy friend Emma 💇♀️ Maybe it’s the algorithm or who and what I follow on LinkedIn but I have never seen a …. I am excited to say I started my own business…… One of my best friends and my hairdresser and my cousin by marriage – did just this, Emma started her own business. The process of watching her dream become a reality taught me so much this year, and I am so proud and in awe of her. After many setbacks and a few fallen through plans. Emma opened her own hair salon. And its perfect and beautiful and off to a successful start. I am pretty sure Emma did the equivalent of an MBA this year – strategy, finance, marketing, client relations and retention, and some interior décor thrown in. It’s refreshingly different and it’s a clever design that she can easily change the look and feel to update it. She is a team of one – doing everything – reception, stock counts, accounting, and creating happiness. Emma had a dream, she worked really hard at learning everyday and putting a plan together to put it into reality – it took a while but she got there. My Boss Lady friend – I look forward to learning more from you in 2024. You have taught me perseverance, to dream big and real-life learning about business should be an MBA. So, if you are ever in Ainsdale give Iridescent Hair a visit and yes, I travel there to get my hair done she is that good. #womenempowerment #womenentrepreneurs #womensmallbusiness #womeninbusiness"
