        "text": "No name is more synonymous with the Washington Football Team's glory days — and, yes there were glory days — than Joe Gibbs.\n\nThe Hall of Fame coach spoke with 106.7 The Fan on Wednesday to reminiscence about the good times. He also discussed the future — specifically the franchise's new nickname that will be revealed next Wednesday.\n\nGibbs coached the franchise for 16 seasons over two stints that included 10 playoff berths, four NFC championships and three Super Bowl wins. He did so with the team's old logo and nickname front and center as an integral part of the franchise's identity.\n\nJoe Gibbs: 'We're gonna get behind it'\n\nHost JP Finlay asked Gibbs his thoughts on the name change Wednesday and whether the announcement would be \"bittersweet.\" Here's what Gibbs had to say:\n\nWashington just wrapped its second season playing as the Washington Football Team after owner Dan Snyder begrudgingly dropped the former nickname that was long criticized as a racist slur. The franchise is slated to reveal the new permanent nickname and logo on Feb. 2.\n\nSeveral options have been bandied about, and team president Jason Wright revealed in August that the list had been cut down to three options. Those three options weren't announced. Wright only revealed that \"Wolves\" and \"Red Wolves\" had been taken off the table, citing trademark challenges.\n\nCharles Mann: 'We crucified' finalists\n\nBut another franchise stalwart got a sneak peak at the finalists along with some other VIPs. Charles Mann won three Super Bowls and earned four Pro Bowl nods terrorizing opposing quarterbacks while playing for Gibbs. He spoke with 106.7 in a separate interview discussing the name change. He's \"not happy\" with any of the three finalists.\n\nMann clarified that he is on board with the old name being retired.\n\nMann declined to take the bait when asked to reveal the three finalists."
