        "text": "Charles William Mann joined his treasured Heavenly Father on Tuesday, August 31, 2021. The family will receive visitors Saturday, September 4, 2021 from 10:00 - 11:00 AM at McMullen Funeral Home and Crematory, 3874 Gentian Blvd. Columbus, Georgia 31907. A memorial service to honor Chuck will immediately follow starting at 11:00 AM at the funeral home. Interment will be held 1:30 PM at Chipley Cemetery in Pine Mountain, Georgia.\n\nBorn on October 6th, 1959 in Greenville, Ohio to Bill and Marchia Mann, Chuck lived the majority of his life in Pine Mountain, Georgia. While he did serve in the US Army, most of his career was as a corporate safety director.\n\nChuck is survived by his beloved wife, Reba, his cherished daughters Kelley Pulley (Jason), Leslie Cox (Michael), Laurie Clack, and his much-loved son, Chris Mann. Chuck adored and lived for his grandchildren: Keileigh, Bill, Gabby, Leah, Parker, Tyler, Nathan, Denver, Carson, and Tinley. He is also survived by his brothers and sisters: Doug and Sadie Mann, Kim and Bobby Moore, Scott Mann and Jenny Hopkins, and Ginny Liston.\n\nChuck believed there were three bubbles of life: God, family, and everything else. To him, everyone was family, and his “everything else” was his classic cars. His heart was always open, and he graciously welcomed everyone he met into his heart and into his home. Chuck continually strived to make sure that his house was a “safe haven for anyone who needed it.” Over the years, he and Reba adopted many additional family members to include, but not limited to: Buffy Mann, Justin Stevens, and Amy Bowling. He was truly a father to all.\n\nHe was the reigning champ of dad jokes, inventor of the best games, creator of silly songs, and starter of non-traditional table talk (if you know, you know). No matter who you were or where you came from, it was natural to gravitate towards his carefree and fun-loving spirit. He had so many people adore him, so much, in fact, that his siblings, kids, and grandchildren always fought over who was his favorite. (However, Kelley and Kim say they know the truth.) He was always full of fun and laughter, and by far the hardest worker we’ve ever known. Chuck believed in earning your keep and working hard for what you have. He whole-heartedly instilled that mindset into his kids, grandkids, and everyone else along the way. He wanted everyone to know that the good things in life are enjoyed best when you’ve worked hard and earned them.\n\nChuck was full of immeasurable wisdom and had many people visit Shake Rag Rd for comfort, advice, and to keep idle hands busy. If you’re reading this now, please know that he would want you to honor his legacy by keeping sacred the three bubbles of life and remembering that time heals all wounds. He will be greatly missed, and his shoes will never be filled."
