        "text": "First Edition; Demy 4to; pp. 628; frontispiece map, 737 b/w. illustrations, 12 full-page colour plates, one of which is large fold out plate, 33 figures, bibliography, epilogue, index; dustjacket, fine copy. Together with loosely inserted restriction notice which states \"Where Australian Aborigines are concerned, and in areas where traditional Aboriginal religion is still significant, this book should be used only after consultation with local male religious leaders.\" First Edition of Mountford's 1940 Western Desert Expedition published in the last year of his life. There was much controversy over the contents of the book. The judge in Foster v. Mountford and Rigby Ltd., (1976) 14 A.L.R. 71. found that a number of photographs, drawings and descriptions of persons, places and ceremonies found in the book had 'deep religious and cultural significance' to the plaintiffs. A significant portion of the edition was then suppressed and withdrawn from sale. Secondhand copies have become increasingly scarce.\n\nHardcover. Condition: Very Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. First Edition. Adelaide, Rigby, 1976. Quarto, 628 pages with a frontispiece map, 33 numbered line illustrations and 737 numbered 'plates' (many from photographs) plus 12 colour plates and a very large folding colour plate (with a black and white key). Loosely inserted is the publisher's printed note requesting restricted use of the book 'in areas where traditional Aboriginal religion is still significant'. Papered boards; mild signs of use; an excellent copy with the excellent dustwrapper. A seminal study of the Pitjandjara [sic] of the Mann Ranges and the Junkandjara [sic] of the Musgrave Ranges, on the borders of South, Central and Western Australia (Mountford explains his use of these names on page 40). The following caveat is printed on the verso of the dedication page: 'Where Australian Aborigines are concerned, and in areas where traditional Aboriginal religion is still significant, this book should be used only after consultation with local male religious leaders. This restriction is important. It is imposed because the concept of what is secret, or may not be revealed to the uninitiated in Aboriginal religious belief and action, varies considerably throughout the Australian continent; and because the varying views of Aborigines in this respect must on all occasions be observed'. The title page is inscribed thus: 'Warm friendly greetings from Monty (C.P. Mountford) December 1976', with 'December 1976' written in the same hand on the front free endpaper. We recognize the hand: the author's wife Bessie Mountford (née Johnstone, 1890-1996). Bessie married Charles Mountford 'in 1933, eight years after the death of his first wife Florence (née Purnell). Bessie accompanied Mountford on the 1940 Adelaide University Anthropological Expedition to Central Australia. She also travelled to Arnhem Land during the American-Australian Scientific Expedition to Arnhem Land (AASEAL) in 1948, led by Charles Mountford, and acted as \"honorary secretary\" to the Expedition' (National Library of Australia). Charles Pearcy Mountford (1890-1976) died on 16 December 1976; although his magnum opus appeared on the market as early as September that year, he was seriously ill at the time. We have seen untold numbers of copies of this book, but only one of them has been signed by Mountford himself. This one signed by his wife may be as close as most of us will get to one."
