As a youngster he would sing along while listening to the radio and later in life joined the church choir. At 16 he joined a local band, Ricky and the Hound Dogs, singing rock & roll and South Louisiana Music, now known as Swamp Pop. Later, he joined the group, The Electradoors, from Gueydan, Louisiana. In 1965 their first single, “Keep Your Arms around Me,” was recorded and ‘Charles Mann’ was born. The single became a huge regional hit which was soon followed by several others. This Essential Collection is the first CD collection of hits by this legendary star."
