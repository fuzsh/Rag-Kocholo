        "text": "William Mann, immigrant ancestor, was born in England, probably in county Kent, about 1607, and was the youngest of eleven children. He may have been the son of Sir Charles Mann, of Hatton Braddock, county Kent, who was knighted in 1625 by Charles I. In that case he was the eldest son; but what is supposed to be the private record of Rev. Samuel Mann says that his father (William) was the youngest of eleven. He was a proprietor of Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1634. He married (first) 1643, Mary Jarred, who came from England; (second) June 11, 1657, Alice Tiel. His will dated December 10, 1661, proved April 1, 1662, unsigned, bequeathed to his wife and only son Samuel. Child: 1. Samuel, mentioned below.\n\n(II) Rev. Samuel Mann, son of William Mann, was born in Cambridge, July 6, 1647. He graduated from Harvard College in 1665, and May 13, 1667, began to teach at Dedham and taught five years there. He preached to the small society in that part of Dedham now Wrentham until March 30, 1676, when the people fled from the town on account of Indian attacks. He was again in Dedham as teacher in 1676-77-78. In the fall of 1677 the town of Rehoboth voted to invite him to become their minister for that winter, and early the following spring he was engaged to preach at Milton, but returned to Wrentham in the summer of 1680. Here he continued his ministerial labors until a church of ten persons was gathered, and April 13, 1692, he was ordained and preached his own ordination sermon. On October 26, 1699, \"in dead of night\" his dwelling house with the church records were burned. It is said that he was much afflicted with infirmities, and for twenty-five years before his death did not go out of his own town. One of the first men of the province said that \"he was not only a very good, but a very great and learned man.\" He wrote a work containing ad vice to his children who were soon to enter the married state. \"His ordinary sermons were fit for the press,\" and yet such was his humility that he thought nothing of his worth publishing. He was beloved by his people. His last sermon was from the text, \"I have seen all the works that are done under the sun, and be hold all is vanity and vexation of spirit.\" He died at Wrentham, May 22, 1719.
