        "text": "When Charles Mann entered the National Football League in 1983, his number one goal was to earn respect from his peers. Though Charles led the Big Sky Conference with 14 sacks in his senior year of college, was voted the Most Valuable Defensive Lineman in 1981 and 1982, and a Division 1-AA All American, he knew those accomplishments were only good enough to get him in the NFL.\n\nAs #71 for the Washington Redskins and then the San Francisco 49ers, Mann used his size (6'6\", 270lbs) and strength to overpower opponents. One of the most physical pass rushers in NFL history, in one season the defensive end recorded 14 sacks and 31 quarterback hurries. The 12-year veteran, who led the Super Bowl XXII Champion Redskins with 10 sacks, compiled over 90 sacks in his career, three Super Bowl rings and four consecutive Pro Bowl appearances.\n\nMann retired from the field as a professional athlete, but continues to work hard. As a professional speaker, youth advocate, sports analyst, actor and entrepreneur, Charles credits his religion with helping him keep balance in life.\n\nIn 1995, Mann co-founded the Good Samaritan Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to serving and educating youth. He devotes a great deal of his time making personal appearances and talking to youth with a motivational message to reach for their goals and walk hand in hand with Christ. He works with the 7-Eleven Store’s Read and Achieve Program, the Boarder Babies Foundation, Lever Brothers, “Why School is Cool,” and Children’s Cancer Foundation.\n\nAs a gifted communicator, Mann has been a Sports Analyst with WUSA-TV Channel 9 in Washington, D.C., a college football Analyst on Black Entertainment Television, and currently works with the NFL on CBS as a Color Analyst. He has participated in public service announcements for the National Kidney Foundation, The United Way, and the Ronald McDonald Children’s Charities. One of his most fulfilling accomplishments was serving on the President’s National Service Initiative Committee.\n\nProfessionally, Mann has been lovingly nicknamed “The Marketable Mann” because of his pleasing demeanor, sincere concern for other people and good looks. His commercial endorsements include McDonald’s, Diet Coke, and Swanson’s Hungry Man dinners.\n\nHis acting credits include playing the role of a tough guy named “Tank” on the television series “A Man Called Hawk,” and a gentle man named “Coal Man” in a wonderful story entitled “Just in Time” for TV’s Ghostwriter during the 1994/95 season and still airs today.\n\nIn addition to being an athlete, advocate, analyst and actor, Charles is an entrepreneur. As owner of the Charles Mann All Pro Grill in Washington, D.C.’s Reagan National Airport, he continues to delight in serving people while operating a successful business.\n\nMann was recently nominated for the Football Hall of Fame, and with a heart as big as his smile, continues to earn the respect of his peers."
