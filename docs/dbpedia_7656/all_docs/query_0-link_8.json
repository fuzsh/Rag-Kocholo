He was educated at St. Peter's College in that city, and having been articled to the firm of Messrs. Bagot & Labatt, was admitted as a legal practitioner in 1860. Mr. Mann, who was made Q.C. in 1875, entered the Assembly as member for the Burra in 1870. He was no less than five times Attorney-General—viz., in the last Hart Government, from July to Nov. 1871; in the Blyth Ministry which immediately followed it, from Nov. 1871 to Jan. 1872; in the third Blyth Ministry, from July 1873 to June 1875; in the second and third Boucaut Governments, from March to June 1876 and Oct. 1877 to Sept. 1878. Mr. Mann was Treasurer in the Morgan Administration, from Sept. 1878 to March 1881, when he was appointed Crown Solicitor and Public Prosecutor, both of which positions he filled till his death on July 7th, 1889."
