        "text": "Obituary:\n\n\"...Manager Mann Passes Away\n\nManager C. W. Mann of the Woods Cross cannery, who was mentioned in last week's Clipper as having had a fall while putting on a belt at the factory on Monday, Oct. 21st, passed away at the Holy Cross hospital, Saturday morning, Oct. 26th, at 10 minutes to twelve. He was in the best of health when he met with the accident, but the hurt was so serious that it was only from Monday until Saturday till the end came. It was rupture of the kidney which developed into peritonitis.\n\nThe funeral services were held in the West Bountiful meeting house, Tuesday, October 29th, at 10 a. m. The attendance was very large and the floral offerings numerous. The young ladies and other employees of the cannery furnished nearly $20 worth of flowers which were worked into various beautiful shapes such as gates ajar, harp, etc. Elders Starns Hatch, Joseph T. Mabey, Thomas Hull, Pres. Grant and Bishop Grant spoke on the character of the deceased and words of consolation to members of the family and those present. The gentleman who disposes of the cannery's goods as wholesaler, whose name we failed to learn, was also present and spoke.\n\nDeceased was born at Stratford-on-Avon, Warwickshire, England, May 4, 1839; making him sixty-two years old last May.\n\nAt the age of nine or ten, he was apprenticed to learn the bakery business which he worked at till he emigrated to Utah in 1859. He crossed the Atlantic in the ship \"William Tapscott.\" On the voyage he married Miss Lavina A. Smith, who has preceded him to the great beyond by one or two years. He and his wife crossed the plains in a handcart in Robert Nestlings' company, arriving in Salt Lake, Sept. 5th.\n\nThey lived in Farmington four years after their arrival here and in 1863 moved to Bountiful which has always been his home.\n\nHe served in the Black Hawk Indian war and helped in the Morristown trouble. Eleven years ago went to England on a mission in November but owing to poor health returned the following February. He served on the home mission here in the county a number of years.\n\nWe doubt whether he ever thought of the baker's trade when he got to this country, for he launched out in an entirely different field of usefulness, turning his attention to machinery for which vocation he was eminently fitted by nature. He started with thrashing machines and then turned his attention to well driving and finally crowned his efforts with the management of the Woods Cross cannery which position he held for four or five years. He met with great success in each of these undertakings; the last was especially conspicuous as when he took hold of the factory it was paying \"Irish dividends\" and last year it paid twenty percent and did considerable building besides.\n\nIn his death Bountiful loses one of its most useful and industrious men and his wife and fifteen children a good husband and father.\n\nSOURCE: Davis County Clipper\"; 11-1-1901.

He was baptized in 1855 by elder Wm. Cooper, and emigrated to Utah in 1859, sailing over the ocean in the ship \"William Tapscott <immagrants_and_ships.htm>.\" While on this voyage he married Livina Ann Smith and crossed the plains in Capt. Geo. Rowley's hand-cart company, which arrived in Salt lake City Sept. 4, 1859. Bro. Mann pulled a hand-cart all the way across the plains and mountains. He located in Farmington, Davis County, where he lived till 1862, when he moved to Bountiful, where he has resided ever since. He was ordained an Elder in 1861 and was later ordained to the office of a Seventy, and is at present a president of the 74th quorum. Elder Mann has always been an active and faithful churchman, having labored as a teacher and later as president of the Teacher's quorum.For many years he acted as Ward teacher, and a Sabbath school worker. In 1889-90 he served a term of fifteen months in the Utah penitentiary for obeying the higher law of marriage. In the fall of 1890 he left home on a mission to Great Britain, returning, on account of illness, in 1891, Brother Mann is an enterprising citizen and has aided much in developing this western country. He participated in the Indian wars of 1866, being stationed at Springtown, Sanpete County. He was also active in the Morrisite war. In civil pursuits he has followed market gardening successfully, and is at present managing the Woods Cross Canning and Pickling company. He married Maria Busby and Louise Webb as plural wives, and is the father of 23 children, 14 of whom are now living.</p><p><p>The City Bountiful, Utah's Second settlement from Pioneers to Present,\" by Leslie T. Foy, (published by Horizon Publishers, 1975) states that</p><p>\"Those who came later with handcarts had learned from the sad experiences of the Willey and Martin companies. They left early enough to reach Salt Lake before winter came. In 1859 Charles Mann and his wife, Lavina, struggled into Utah with the eighth Company, the George Rowley Handcart Company.\" (page 32) On page 186 it states that Charles W. Mann had a fatal accident at the Woods Cross Canning and Pickling Company."
