        "text": "AMHERST -- When science journalist and writer Charles C. Mann first moved to Amherst in 1990 he was excited by the idea of a town meeting.\n\nMann and his wife, University of Massachusetts associate architecture professor Ray Kinoshita Mann, had been living in New York -- but both grew up in small towns.\n\nMann graduated from Amherst College in 1976, but hadn't thought much about the town once he left.\n\n\"I was excited with this idea of Town Meeting,\" he said.\n\nOver the years, though, his reverence for the storied form of governance has waned.\n\n\"Massachusetts is a heavily regulated state,\" he said. That \"makes it hard for citizen legislators to their job.\"\n\nMann, the author of such books as \"1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus,\" and \"1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created,\" recently wrote about the town for the Pacific Standard blog.\n\nThe blog contacted writers and public figures in all 50 states and Washington D.C. to \"write about something that has captured the attention of their community in this time of great divisiveness and unrest.\"\n\nMann looked looked at Amherst, where voters on Tuesday will decide whether to leave the 240-member representative Town Meeting behind for a 13-member town council.\n\nIn his piece, Mann wrote that in one way Amherst is an \"odd place\" with better than usual public schools, low unemployment and crime. But, he wrote, \"in one depressing way our town is just like the rest of the nation: We're having trouble with this democracy thing.\"\n\nOne of his criticisms: Town Meeting members tend not to trust the experts, he says. Moreover, those offering their expertise \"are accused of being shills for industry and it was startling to me,\" he said.\n\nAnd he said Town Meeting often wants opposing things -- for example, preservation of open space and affordable housing. Such desires require compromise to address.\n\n\"The structure of town meeting allows people to make virtuous stands,\" he said.\n\nIn the blog post, he wrote that \"people at town meeting make choices based on gut feelings about right and wrong, regardless of whether those impulses are conflicting. I still love living here but worry that we are becoming ungovernable.\"\n\nHe has not served on Town Meeting, but describes himself as an observer of the town. His wife served on the Planning Board.\n\nSeveral times, he said, he has contacted his representatives about issues and they did not return his calls. Each of the town's 10 precincts has 24 Town Meeting representatives.\n\nIt's hard to track how those representatives vote, he said -- votes are only recorded if the meeting requests a tally.\n\nHe said it's a little maddening not to know.\n\nWith a council, people will be able to contact their representatives and know how they vote. Town meeting members often talk about transparency when the body itself is not, he said.\n\nHe was upset that Town Meeting rejected plans for a new elementary school even though educators supported it.\n\n\"A small group of people put people at risk,\" he said, referring to numerous concerns raised about the health issues at the Wildwood and Fort River Elementary schools.\n\nBut those who opposed that project wanted to preserve neighborhood schools and proposed renovating rather than replacing them -- even though school officials said that would be costlier. The town would have paid $32.8 million of the $67 million cost for the school building project.\n\nAnd now nearly 30 years after moving here, he said, \"Town Meeting was quite different from what I had imagined.\""
