        "text": "It was a series of seemingly small events that had a huge impact on the course of Moorpark resident Robert Black’s career.\n\nThe author—whose works have twice made it onto the National Science Teaching Association and the Children’s Book Council’s Best STEM Books list—didn’t originally set out to write books at all.\n\nAfter graduating from Vanderbilt University, Black landed a job as a writer for the 1979 Nickelodeon show “You Can’t Do That on Television.” The sketch comedy program was produced in Ottawa, Canada, and featured teen actors. Among them was 12-year-old Alanis Morissette, with whom Black got to work.\n\nThe show first introduced the network’s iconic green slime that is still featured in programs today.\n\n“When I mention it, people of a certain age say, ‘Oh yeah! You wrote for that?’” he said.\n\nThanks to his success writing for “You Can’t Do That,” Black moved to California to continue his TV career. That didn’t go as planned.\n\n“Hollywood and I didn’t like each other,” said Black.\n\nProducers, directors and executives in Hollywood have the freedom to rework a script to the point it’s unrecognizable from its original form.\n\nLosing creative control over his work was a deal breaker for Black.\n\nWhat really solidified that notion was attending a presentation given by a script editor in Hollywood at the time.\n\n“She said, ‘If you really care about the integrity of your work and your story, don’t go to Hollywood. Write books instead,’” he said.\n\nThat’s what Black did . . . eventually.\n\nHe paused to pursue another passion first.\n\nThe writer moved from Pasadena to Moorpark and began working as an engineer at Raypak in Oxnard, which manufactures residential and commercial boilers and water heaters. He’s since become a senior quality engineer at the company.\n\nBut the engineer refused to put the pen down.\n\nIn the 1990s, he submitted work to a British publication that was creating original “Doctor Who” stories based on the television series. Although he didn’t land the gig, the editor wrote Black a two-page letter of feedback.\n\n“(The editor) said when ‘Doctor Who’ was on the air in the ’60s, ’70s and ’80s, they had these novelizations of the stories for children. ‘Your style reminded me of those,’” he said.\n\nBlack took the notion and ran with it. Nearly 20 years ago, he submitted a historical novel to Royal Fireworks Press, based in Unionville, New York. He’s been working with the company ever since.\n\nAs an engineer and the child of two retired math teachers, the author began thinking about how he could write about math in an entertaining way.\n\n“You haven’t really seen anybody have much success putting math in a story,” Black said.\n\nRoyal Fireworks Press pitched the idea to have Black write a biography series about famous mathematicians. The idea has since landed him multiple accolades, including the Best STEM Books award for “Edward Lorenz and the Chaotic Butterflies,” published in the spring of 2022. The 127-page book tells the story of how chaos theory and “The Butterfly Effect” were discovered. It joins his previous year’s winner, “Benoit Mandelbrot: Reshaping the World,” about a Polish-born mathematician who was an expert in fractal geometry.\n\nJordan Novak, director of marketing at Royal Fireworks Press, said that even though Black has explored many different avenues, he’s a historian at heart.\n\n“I think a lot of people make the mistake of assuming he would be a math nerd,” Novak said. “And really what he does is he understands people.”\n\nIt takes a certain set of skills, Novak said, to bring a human element to the world of STEM.\n\nIt took Black five years to write the six-book series on mathematicians. He knew from the start, however, that he wanted to write about meteorologist Edward Lorenz, but was worried it would be too complex for young readers. Lorenz discovered chaos theory by studying small changes in weather patterns.\n\n“Even differences that are too small for our instruments to measure, that tiny, tiny difference is enough to throw everything off,” Black said.\n\nJust as one can’t predict the weather with 100% accuracy, one can’t predict where the trajectory of their careers will lead them. Much like Morissette advanced from a clean-cut, occasionally slimed “You Can’t Do That on Television” character to a 1990s post-grunge rock star, Black has certainly had his own wild ride.\n\n“I’ve had a lot of changes, back-and-forths and zigzags,” Black said. “It’s been an adventure.”"
