        "text": "Sonya Hartnett is an acclaimed author of young-adult fiction whose Thursday's Child won the 2002 Guardian children's fiction prize. Butterfly is billed as her first adult work, but could be just as happily read by someone of 13. While this breadth of tone is impressive, it leaves the book unsettled. Although full of insight and wit, it never quite takes shape.\n\nAdolescence is, of course, an unsettled subject. Ariella Coyle, nicknamed Plum, is growing up in the Australian suburbs in the 1980s. In this generic long hot summer, Plum's endless deliberations are played out in a slow-motion present tense. Without the internet or mobile phones, there is even more time for self-scrutiny: \"Plum's entire body is somehow too much - too tall, too thriving, too there.\" A lonely and indulged late child, Plum has two much older brothers - Justin, who works in an off licence, and Cydar, a student who breeds tropical fish in a bungalow at the bottom of the garden. Cydar is quiet and perceptive and, most of the time, stoned. He loves Plum all the more for her gracelessness and she loves Justin best because of his grace. Like her parents, her brothers are patient and kind, but Plum must find something to protest about. She decides that she will no longer attend church: \"I'm not going to visit someone who doesn't even exist.\"\n\nWhen this is greeted with benign indifference, she looks elsewhere for attention and, to her delight, is befriended by a glamorous neighbour. Maureen spends most of the time alone with her four-year-old son; she is happy to give Plum the flattery the young girl craves, and immediately sets to work on her transformation. She buffs up Plum's real name into the preposterous Aria. She also tells her to skip lunch.\n\nPlum announces her new name to her friends and also lets slip that Maureen said she could be a model. They \"laugh like squeaky toys\". This girl gang is perfectly observed, from the ruthless manipulator to the charismatic princess to the careful hangers-on. They agree to come to Plum's 14th birthday party on two conditions: that her brothers will be there and that she will let them pierce her ears. She submits to both demands.\n\nWhile clear about her role in the gang, Plum resists knowing more about what's going on at home. She has a child's sense of those around her being only what she makes them - brother, father, neighbour - and demands their attention accordingly. When a secret relationship is revealed, she simply cannot comprehend it. The darker drama being played out distracts us from Plum's own story so that the twist, when it comes, fails to have the impact it should.\n\nHartnett is good at characterisation but vague when it comes to point of view. From time to time, Plum and her brothers lapse into sophisticated commentaries on themselves. They might know what they're feeling but it seems unlikely they'd understand, let alone be able to formulate it so neatly. The narrative voice is coloured by teenage theatricality even when not inside a teenage head, as when \"silence rolls up Plum's spine like a hearse\". Cydar arrives like \"a hawk whistled down from the sky\". Plum herself pounds \"through the house like a rock down a cliffside, storming up the stairs like a centurion\". You find yourself wishing that someone would just straightforwardly do something or at least only one thing at a time.\n\nThis is frustrating because it distracts us from the intelligence of the writing and also because Hartnett is capable of some wonderful images. The day of the party arrives and catastrophe swiftly follows. Plum finds herself ostracised by her friends but, for the first time, given real power to hurt someone herself. She makes short work of it in a decisive act that brings everything this novel has to offer into focus - too briefly and too late."
