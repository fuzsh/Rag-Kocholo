        "text": "Book Synopsis\n\nA whimsical rhyming story about how everything is connected and the power of our choices. For children ages 5 years and up.\n\nButterfly bumps into Bumblebee and continues on her merry way . . . unaware that she has set off a chain reaction that turns the once-friendly farmyard into complete chaos. Bumblebee stings Squirrel, who startles Cow, who starts a stampede! What a mess! How can Farmer Farley and the animals restore the farm to the peaceful place it once was?\n\nReview Quotes\n\nComing soon\n\nAbout the Author\n\nNicole Castrovinci was born and raised in the suburbs of New Jersey just outside of New York City. A child of the 1970s, when she wasn't roaming freely about the neighborhood with friends, Nicole loved to write. She filled up a dozen diaries, wrote to pen pals from around the world, and submitted poems for publication in local newspapers. Many years later, with a masters degree in Counseling Psychology, Nicole is still happiest when she is writing - especially with a cat curled up on her lap. 'The Butterfly Effect' (2023) is Nicole's first children's book."
