        "text": "What\n\nthe Birds See by Sonya\n\nHartnett is an international award winning novel. It is a taut suspense filled coming-of-age\n\nnovel about a young Australian boy growing up in the aftermath of the\n\ndisappearance of three children in his neighborhood. (The novel was inspired by\n\nreal events.)\n\nWhat the Birds See is set in a sleepy neighborhood in Australia\n\nin the year 1977. On an unusually warm afternoon, the Metford children\n\n(Veronica aged ten years, Zoe aged seven years, and Christopher aged five years)\n\nset out for the local sweet shop for some ice cream. It was a short walk\n\nthrough a suburban neighborhood and the children’s trip was witnessed by a\n\nnumber of their neighbors. Amazingly all three of the children disappeared\n\nwithout a trace. Kidnapping and foul play were suspected. Day-by-day, the media\n\nhyped the story sparking national fear and anxiety in parents, their children,\n\nand all in charge of childcare, etc. Nine-year old, Adrian McPhee\n\nalready had enough to fear. He was abandoned by his father and mother. He is\n\nliving with his agoraphobic uncle, Rory and his grandmother who longs for the\n\npeace of retirement and a freedom from childcare only grudgingly accepts his presence\n\nin the household. Adrian is not\n\naccepted by his classmates, and he is both intrigued and repulsed by the\n\nbehavior and treatment of Sandra, nicknamed the \"horse girl\", a\n\ndisturbed classmate from St. Jonah’s orphanage which only adds to Adrian’s\n\ngreatest fear – being sent to an orphanage. Needless to say, the suspicion and\n\nwatchfulness sparked by current events is less than conducive to Adrian\n\nalready fearful and depressed state. Then into the neighborhood arrives three\n\nstrange children (Nicole aged eleven years, Joely\n\naged six years, and Giles aged two-and one half years). The children do not go\n\nto school, they seem to have no visible mother, and whenever Adrian\n\napproaches them or their house, a man who is supposedly their father, suddenly\n\nappears and hurries them inside. (Could these be the missing children?)\n\nEventually Adrian gets to speak to\n\nNicole. She is even stranger in person and her story about knowing what\n\nhappened to the missing children and where they are is more than a little\n\nsuspicious. The suspense of the novel builds to a sudden and shocking\n\nconclusion.\n\nWhat the Birds See is a truly well written, suspense\n\nfilled novel. It is genuinely spooky and its ending can not be pre-guess. It is\n\na tale of strange yet somehow very ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.\n\nWhile the \"horse girl\" pushes the envelope of believability, the rest\n\nof the characters are all believable in their own quirky way. Any adult can\n\nempathize with Gran McPhee exhausted\n\nand depressed at the thought of raising yet another generation. Uncle Rory is\n\nunderstandable in his agoraphobic grief and guilt over a tragic accident during\n\nhis reckless youth that devastated his family. Adrian is equally understandable\n\nin his fearfulness of a life filled with the unknown and already brimming with\n\nabandonment.\n\nSonya Hartnett is an award winning\n\nAustralian author of thirteen books for young people. She wrote her first novel\n\nTrouble All the Way (1984) when she was fifteen years old. She was named The Sydney Morning Herald Young Novelists of\n\nthe Year in both 2002 and 2003. Her literary awards include the CBC\n\nAward for older readers for Forest (1996), and\n\nthe Guardian\n\nChildren’s Fiction Prize for Thursday’s Child (2002).\n\nWhat\n\nthe Birds See (2004) was originally published as Of a Boy\n\n(2000). The novel was nominated for the Miles Franklin Award and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award. It was the\n\nwinner of the Age Book of the Year Award, the Commonwealth Writer’s\n\nPrize, Best Book in the South East Asia and South\n\nPacific Region. Her other works include, Wilful Blue (1994); Sleeping Dogs\n\n(1995); Black Foxes (1996), and Thursday’s Child (2002). Her latest book is Stripes of the Sidestep Wolf (UK, 2004). Hartnett lives in Melbourne.\n\nWhat the Birds See by\n\nSonya Hartnett is an award winning novel will keep readers on the\n\nedge of their seats. The book is\n\nrecommended for ages 12 years and up. It does not contain any graphic\n\ndescriptions of violence but the situation may be upsetting for some sensitive\n\nreaders. I highly recommend this book.\n\n© 2004 Su Terry\n\nSu Terry: Education:\n\nB.A. in History from Sacred Heart University, M.L.S. in Library Science from\n\nSouthern Connecticut State College, M.R.S. in Religious Studies/Pastoral\n\nCounseling from Fairfield University, a M.Div. in\n\nProfessional Ministry from New Brunswick Theological Seminary, a Certificate in\n\nSpirituality/Spiritual Direction from Sacred Heart University.
