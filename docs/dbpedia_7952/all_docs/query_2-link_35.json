        "text": "Publisher's synopsis\n\nThis beautiful picture book by award winners Roger Vaughan Carr and Ann James portrays the theory of the butterfly effect in a simple yet informative way.\n\nMalani went to the forest each day with her father and his elephant. She played at the feet of the great forest trees, where she watched a beautiful butterfly. It is just a frail pretty thing that cannot do anything grand, she thought. But Malani never knew that the butterfly’s delicate wings held strength enough to make even the mighty elephant tremble.\n\nAward\n\nShortlisted for the NSW Premier’s Award, 1997\n\nIllustrator\n\nClick here to read more about Ann James.\n\nRoger Vaughan Carr\n\nMelbourne-born Roger Vaughan Carr was a well-known children’s author who wrote school reading texts, novels for adolescents and contributed stories to the Victorian School Paper.
