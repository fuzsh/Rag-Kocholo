I was overwhelmed with joy and a sense of accomplishment, yet also with a touch of sadness.\n\nWas this the end of a journey or the beginning?\n\nI had wanted to write a novel for over twenty years.\n\nSo one day I decided to do it.\n\nPrologue\n\nI was torn between writing a pure fiction novel versus a book of lessons for my children. I considered a memoir but I am not a fan of that format. My biggest concern was boring myself to death as I wrote story after story of my life. I needed a mix of fiction in my writing.\n\nI love to read fiction.\n\nNon-fiction is a mirror of life. Fiction is a window into the soul."
