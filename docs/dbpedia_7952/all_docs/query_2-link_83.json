        "text": "Books have an uncompromising integrity.\n\nThe first annual Oxford Publishing Group Summer Conference took place on Tuesday with a stellar line-up of book industry talent. I wrote up a report for BookBrunch which you can take a look at for the detail if you’re a subscriber, but one thing that particularly struck me was a comment by author Philip Pullman, which I recognized from his acknowledgements in The Amber Spyglass but had forgotten:\n\nRead like a butterfly, write like a bee.\n\nHere’s the full version: ‘I have stolen ideas from every book I have ever read. My principle in researching for a novel is “Read like a butterfly, write like a bee”, and if this story contains any honey, it is entirely because of the quality of the nectar I found in the work of better writers.’ (He cites Milton and Blake in particular.)\n\nThis is a great principle not just for novelists but for ALL writers, and particularly for the authors I work with, who are setting out to write significant, meaningful books, books that change hearts and minds, that make the world a better place through the sharing of ideas and expertise.\n\nFor these writers the starting point is their own vision and experience, and that’s essential: nobody has any business writing a world-changing book without these. But assuming those fundamentals are in place, what can we learn from the butterfly and the bee?\n\nRead like a butterfly\n\nA caterpillar’s diet is a dull one. Born on one plant, it has no choice but to munch on that plant until it’s ready to pupate. But once its metamorphosis is complete, the world is its oyster (and some really make the most of their new-found wings; the Monarch butterfly, incredibly, migrates from Canada to Mexico). When a butterfly visits flowers it does so by necessity, not for fun. It takes nectar – the raw material offered by each flower – mixes it with nectar from many other flowers, and transmutes this synthesis into fuel for its flight. Along the way it cross-fertilises, carrying pollen between different flowers, allowing them to seed and spread.\n\nGood writers tend to read widely; great writers, like Pullman, take ideas and inspiration from each book they consume and transform them, build on them, bring together unexpected concepts, create something new. And, like Pullman, they always credit their key sources.\n\nWrite like a bee\n\nThe original version of Pullman’s adapted quote is of course Muhammad Ali’s ‘Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee’: he is therefore tacitly aligning writing with both a bee’s sting and a boxer’s punch, neither of which are comfortable experiences. In a world in which so much of our reading is driven by social sharing from a self-selected group of friends, and even our search engines are ‘optimised’ to deliver content tailored to our location and taste, books have an uncompromising integrity. They preserve the author’s message in its entirety, undiluted by comment threads or discussion.\n\nGood books challenge us, and unless we are challenged we will not change.\n\nBees sting for a reason. It’s costly. They won’t do so unless they believe the safety of the hive is at stake. If you’re thinking of writing a book, ask yourself what, exactly, is your message, and how much do you care about stinging the world into action.\n\nPullman insisted, somewhat disingenuously I think, that his novels weren’t designed to ‘make a point’ (‘If I wanted to send a message I’d have written a sermon’), and I’m quite sure that he had in mind something infinitely more subtle and literary when he wrote about butterflies and bees.* But if your book IS designed specifically to make your point, to change the world, make sure you’re not pulling your punches.\n\n*But there you are, you see – you put something out there and along someone comes and, butterfly-like, takes and adapts it for their own purposes. Sorry, Philip."
