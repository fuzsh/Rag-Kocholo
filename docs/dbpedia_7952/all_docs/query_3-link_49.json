        "text": "The eve of the London blitz, and the two Lockwood children are being evacuated, northwards and first class, with their mother, to the Lancastrian rural mansion of their Uncle Peregrine. Jeremy, 14, is stiff-necked and furious; he wants to stay and prove himself a man by doing something noble towards the war effort. Cecily, 12, dim and self-centred, is excited but weepy about parting with Daddy. En route to Heron Hall, they half-heartedly scoop up a younger, lower-class evacuee, May. \"I chose her at the town hall – just like picking a kitten from a basket,\" Cecily tells her uncle. At safe adventuring distance from the Hall stand the ancient ruins of Snow Castle. In after-dinner episodes, Peregrine relates a dark tale, connected to the castle, of a murderous duke's progress to the throne 400 years ago. Bold May and reluctant Cecily make expeditions to the castle where they encounter two insubstantial, fearful but imperious boys clad in antique \"pantomime\" costumes.\n\nSonya Hartnett has spoken of the construction of her novels as being akin to musical composition. Even in the brief synopsis above, one can hear themes from Blyton, Bawden and especially Lewis. But the instrumentation is Jane Austen's. This delicious novel is rich in irony, both linguistically and structurally. Cecily is a clumping, junior Emma Woodhouse in her misplaced, yearning possessiveness towards May. Her uncle is a saturnine version of Mr Bennet. When biscuits go missing, he tells his young guests that \"Cook believes there are rats in the larder. If not rats, mice. If not mice, weevils. If not weevils, children.\"\n\nThe two stories – Hartnett's and Peregrine's – and their characters elegantly and subtly morph into each other. His tale is recognisably from its onset that of Richard III and the disputed fate of his nephews, the princes in the Tower. I am unembarrassed to admit that it took me some time to add together Peregrine's medieval hairstyle, his limp, his loss of wife and child, his grimness under siege, his fraught relationship with his brother's wife. Both stories are about power, its uses and abuses and, most of all, its lack. \"Children are powerless,\" Jeremy bitterly observes; but it turns out they are not. It is the youngest child, May, who releases both Jeremy and the ghosts from their bondage in space and time. And it is May whom Peregrine recognises as his equal and successor.\n\nThis is not a novel packed with narrative event. (Until, that is, its last chapters, where Jeremy's narrative of his runaway experience in London usurps the storyteller's throne from his uncle.) It is, after all, about characters immobilised by either sanctuary or captivity, and an ironic meditation on the similarities between the two. But textually, linguistically, there are marvellous happenings from page one, when Cecily's heart \"bounced like a trout\". Do trout bounce? I neither know nor care. I just wish I'd written those words. Her father's breathing inside a gas mask sounds \"like paper on fire\". Like her marvellous fellow Australian Margo Lanagan, Hartnett is unconcerned with the age of her readership or its presumed level of literacy or understanding. She takes her readers into the lush jungle of language and leaves them there, entranced by its sounds.\n\nMal Peet is the author of Life: An Exploded Diagram.
