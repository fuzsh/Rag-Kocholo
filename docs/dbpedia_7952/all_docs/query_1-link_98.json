        "text": "\"I wake up in the morning and I don't want to go to school. Other kids like school, or at least don't mind it. But I never want to go to school. At school you're supposed to have lots of friends,\n\nbut I'm shy about making friends.\"\n\nThe only part of the school day she enjoys is her art class once a week. Her honesty is heartbreaking but it so so good that she talks to her mum:\n\n\"I can't run fast or make people laugh.'\n\n\"Why do you need to run fast?\" mum asked.\n\n'Other kids can,' I said.\n\n'Why do you want to make people laugh?'\n\n'Everyone likes laughing,' I said. ... Mum was making our favourite macaroni and cheese she said\n\n'Being different isn't easy until you decide it's a good thing to be.\"\n\nPublisher blurb: A young child describes her qualms about going to school and how hard she finds asking the teacher for help, how she feels shy about making friends, not being funny or a fast runner. But through her love of art, a conversation with her mother and her observations about nature she comes to see that being different might not be a bad thing after all.\n\nBlue Flower was published in 2021 but because it was entered for the CBCA Picture Book of the Year I haven't been able to talk about this book until now. Book Week and the announcement of the CBCA Award winners for 2022 happened last month. As a CBCA judge I had to wait to share these books until the judging was completed.\n\nThis book explores themes of shyness, confidence, optimism, and difference. The line “at lunch I sit where mum would see me if she drove by in the car” is such a small idea but also a powerful one that I think may resonate with some children.\n\nThere will be a lot to discuss after reading this book. The title is sure to make readers curious to know more. Blue is a rare and different colour for flowers just as the little girl is different. This book is filled with such genuine emotions. The way she shares her innermost thoughts has so much honesty and bravery.\n\nOne thing I noticed, reading this book aloud, is the perfect pacing and positioning of the page turns. It was good to see the restrained involvement of the mother. Mum offers wise advice but then leaves the little girl to think through her words and then make her own conclusions. The portrayal of a single parent family is also not given an unnecessary focus. It is just explained in a very natural and ‘matter of fact’ way. I also like the soft colour palette used by the illustrator.\n\nHere is a video where Sonya Hartnett and Gabriel Evans talk about their book. Sonya explains her personal connection with this story. Here are some teaching notes from the publisher Penguin.\n\nHere in Australia, by now, most children in Primary schools are sure to have seen this book but I know people from other places in the world read my blog so I do hope you can find Blue Flower in your local library, school or book store. If you can that means this book has travelled beyond our shores - and yes this is a book that should have an international audience.\n\nThis week I have been watching an ABC television program Old People's Home for Teenagers. There are two girls featured in this program who are so similar to the little girl in Blue Flower. I was a little like her too. This post is dedicated to Dora and Anna.\n\nHere are the judges comments about Blue Flower:\n\nA beautiful book exploring important themes of disliking school, self-love and being proud to be different. The book is filled with genuine emotion and has a strong central character revealed through convincing inner dialogue. Perfect pace and positioning of page turns make this an excellent read aloud. The illustrations offer delicate and nuanced explorations of character and setting; the colour palette is restrained, and colours are used in a symbolic way. This character and situation will resonate with many young readers and the overall message is inspiring. A thought-provoking book which will generate lots of discussions with children.\n\nSo, let’s celebrate the things that makes us different and not hide our talents and gifts under doonas and behind closed doors, let’s allow all of our differences to make life more wonderful and a little easier for those of us who struggle with it. Diane's Picture Book Favourites\n\nThe story of the Blue Flower is about finding who you are and accepting who you are. Gabriel Evans.\n\nStanding apart from the crowd can be lonely, and fill a child with self-doubt. I wanted to write a story that spoke to these children – the loners, the shy ones, the awkward, the meek –and recognise the bravery with which they face each day. Sonya Hartnett\n\nGabriel Evans’ emotionally charged illustrations that capture the complex inner life of a child learning to celebrate everything that makes her unique. The Sydney Morning Herald"
