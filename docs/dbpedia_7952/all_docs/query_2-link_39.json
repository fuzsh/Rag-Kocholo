        "text": "In case you are unaware, I recently got a job that I started at the end of July. It’s a temporary position in an academic library of a major university I’ve worked at before. My job title is “welcome ambassador,” which is exactly as it sounds. The library is open to the public, so my responsibility is to explain what the institution has to offer to tourists, the rules to visiting researchers, and, to the best of my ability, give directions in between.\n\nMy hours are 9 to 5, but the library doesn’t open until 10am. Besides the training sessions during the first three days, I’m left to my own devices for the first hour of my shift. The first hour is typically quiet. The only patrons coming in are researchers and most already know what is expected after the first visit. There are also other periods of quiet throughout the day in between the waves of tourists. Instead of picking up my phone, I’ve been reading a book.\n\nAs you can probably guess, this job isn’t exactly fit for an audiobook. I need to be alert and aware, especially since part of it is keeping an eye for security. However, because of intrusive thoughts, physically reading has been a challenge in recent years. Then again…reading in general has been a rollercoaster for me since the pandemic.\n\nUntil 2020, physically reading books was the way to read that I was used to. Then, I started reading audiobooks in 2021.\n\nFor years prior, I thought audiobooks as “not for me.” But in 2020, I struggled to concentrate on reading due to ongoing unemployment and the COVID-19 lockdown. Then, at the beginning of 2021, I impulsively picked up the audiobook for the book I was reading. The rest, as they say, is history. As such, 2021 is one of my best reading years to date.\n\nNow, when reading a physical book, I ideally would like to have the audiobook along with it. This is for the sake of concentration; the audiobook helps with reading the words and keeping out background noise while the physical copy keeps track of pages read. When listening to an audiobook without a physical copy, I play on a coloring book or word search app. When reading a physical copy (or an e-book) without an audiobook, I have an ASMR YouTube video in the background.\n\nLong story short: I need noise when I read and I need to have a distraction with an audiobook.\n\nRecently, I wondered if I’ve read more audiobooks or physical books. I actually looked back and checked…\n\n2020: entirely physical books\n\n2021: mostly audiobooks\n\n2022: mostly audiobooks\n\n2023: a tie between audiobooks and physical books, with more e-books than previous years.\n\n2024 (so far): more physical and e-books than audiobooks.\n\nReflecting on life events over the last four years, I realized outside circumstances impact my reading. For example, the stress of extended unemployment took a toll on my mental health in 2022. This led to me to lean towards mood reading, looking for anything that would make me want to just sit down and read. Then, in 2023, my mental health was challenged further by my father’s cancer diagnosis.\n\nThe events of the previous year also affected the genre of books I reached for. Mainly, picture books, either physically or as audiobooks. A lot of the audiobooks I listened to were short books, like novellas, as I looked for anything fast to read in 2021 and 2022. Still, I leaned heavily on audiobooks. So, when this job came around, I worried how hard reading strictly physically might be. But I had nothing to worry about. Reading physically has been surprisingly easier than I expected it to be.\n\nPersonally, I don’t think audiobooks are better than physical reading or vice versa. Everyone has a preference on what works best for them. All that matters is the reader is reading.\n\nIn recent posts, I mentioned I was in a reading slump in July. This should not have come as a surprise to me, considering this is the time of my annual mid-year reading slump.\n\nNormally, I take a break from reading and focus on other things. I ride the slump out until I feel like reading again. And I don’t just jump back into it, either. Occasionally, I will reread a book before getting back to my TBR. In the end, it’s annoying, but not world-ending.\n\nHowever, this time around, the slump was rough. I didn’t have much else to do. My other hobbies preoccupied me only for so long. Instead, I focused on YouTube and streaming services.\n\nSince coming out of the reading slump, I’ve started to wonder if taking a break from reading was actually a good idea. My intrusive thoughts frequently got the best of me in July. I needed other media to get myself out of my head. This got me thinking: what are signs it might be a good idea to take a reading break?\n\nYou are busy\n\nThis has happened to me often. For example, in July of 2021, I got a new temp job after months of unemployment. During that first month, I attempted to read a few books, but quickly gave up. I devoted all my mental energy to learning the new job. This might be the case for you as well. If you are a grad student, like I was, you might not have a lot of free time to read. Or if you have a lot of stressful events going on in your personal life and other activities simply provide more comfort than reading. Whatever the case, stress is a perfect reason to take a reading break.\n\nYou’re in a reading slump\n\nForcing yourself to read is not a good idea. It will only make you hate reading and, I am assuming, you don’t want that. More often than not, a slump happens because your brain is sick of reading. As such, a reading break is highly encouraged.\n\nYou prefer to do other things\n\nSurprisingly, I do have other hobbies besides reading. Over the past several months, I’ve been frequently drawn to an app called Garden Joy. For the past several months, I’ve become obsessed with building fictional gardens. I enjoy coloring or word searches even when I am not listening to an audiobook. I like watching YouTube videos and I’m currently catching up on some of my favorite streaming TV shows. And I spend a lot of my downtime Internet window shopping, browsing some of my favorite non-bookish sites, like Torrid or Etsy.\n\nYou just don’t feel like it\n\nPlain and simple. If you don’t want to read, you should not feel like you have to.\n\nWhen do you think it’s a good idea to take a break from reading?\n\nEven though I have gone through a fair number of reading slumps, I’ve been reluctant to write this sort of post. Everyone has their own way of getting out of a reading slump that works best for them. But there are a few books I personally found helpful and, hopefully, others will as well.\n\nBook Love by Debbie Tung is a collection of comic vignettes on little delights in a reader’s life. Besides being a super fast read, it will remind you why reading is so much fun in the first place.\n\nSadie by Courtney Summers is a book you can read in a day. Not because it’s short, but because it’s so intense, you won’t put it down. Sadie Hunter is one step ahead of everyone. Just when you think the plot is going in one direction, it goes in another. For the incredible podcast element, I highly recommend Sadie be read as an audiobook. The audiobook production alone will make you want to keep reading.\n\nHome Before Dark by Riley Sager is a book I read in a day. The plot blurs the line between thriller and paranormal. The chapters are also very short, each one ending on a cliffhanger that makes you instantly want to read the next one.\n\nLong Way Down by Jason Reynolds was one of my favorite books I read in graduate school. At the time, I had a part-time job and a backlog of schoolwork. But I made time to read Long Way Down. I even risked squinting in the dim light of a dark bus to finish reading it. The plot of Long Way Down will have you biting your nails as you wait to see if the protagonist follows through with his plan. And the writing is amazing.\n\nWhat books do you recommend to pull someone out of a reading slump?\n\nI’m not in a reading slump anymore…\n\nI didn’t post any WWW Wednesday last month because I was in a massive reading slump. I rode it out as best I could. It was frustrating to not be able to read anything, especially since I was still unemployed at the time. Fortunately, with time and patience, I slowly came out of the reading slump.\n\nIn other good news, I started a new temp job last week. It was the most fun first week of a new job I’ve had. Between the long commute and the free hour in the morning, I got a lot of reading done last week. So far, I really like this job. I’m already hoping for an extension, or even a straight-up full-time job offer. But I am not holding my breath, considering they made it clear early on I’m only covering someone’s medical leave.\n\nIn even better news, I’m still sticking to my book buying ban. Just don’t ask me how my bank account is looking.\n\nRecently Finished\n\nTo Drink Coffee with a Ghost by Amanda Lovelace\n\nReread\n\nThe Secret Garden: the graphic novel by Mariah Marsden\n\nLibrary book\n\nSpeak: the graphic novel by Emily Carroll and Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nReread\n\nThe Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian by Sherman Alexie\n\nReread\n\nBesides The Secret Garden graphic novel, the books I’ve read the past week are old favorites I feel differently about now. While my feelings about Speak: the graphic novel remains the same, that cannot be said about To Drink Coffee with a Ghost and The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. The former I read four years ago, two years after my mother’s passing. While I appreciate this poetry collection for what it was, I was in a different headspace back then. But the memories of that time are still fresh.\n\nAs for the latter, this was my fourth or fifth time rereading The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian. Unfortunately, I technically DNF’ed it. Not because it was bad, but because I’m past my time with it. While it breaks my heart, as it represents a big part of my life, I’ve decided to part with it. Finally, The Secret Garden: the graphic novel was a mediocre read. I would not recommend this book for someone who has not read the original work.\n\nCurrently Reading\n\nThe Girl from the Sea by Molly Knox Ostertag\n\nTBR Book\n\nThe Girl from the Sea is a graphic novel that’s been on my TBR cart all year. It’s about a teen girl who falls in love with the mermaid that saved her from drowning. Honestly, I don’t know why I kept putting it off. Molly Knox Ostertag wrote several of my favorite graphic novels, most recently The Deep Dark. Technically, I’m pre-scheduling this post, but I am confident I will like The Girl from the Sea.\n\nReading Next\n\nWhat Once Was Mine by Liz Braswell\n\nLibrary book\n\nI almost returned my latest library book haul, but I’m glad I changed my mind.\n\nMy original intention was to read the physical copy of What Once Was Mine while listening along to the audiobook. Only I’m covering a front desk of an academic library that’s open to the public. So, that would not be the best idea. As such, I might read What Once Was Mine along with The Girl from the Sea.\n\nWhile I wanted to primarily focus on my TBR books this year, I did want to finish the Disney Twisted Tales series. I kept putting it off out of “guilt.” Then, I found out there is a new book coming out in October, and it’s a reimagining of The Nightmare Before Christmas. I have until October to catch up.\n\nWhat are you currently reading?\n\nThankfully, I put this topic up on time…I started a new job last week and, when this happens, my blog sometimes suffers for it. There’s been a lag in my posting schedule lately, so I’m doing my best to avoid that.\n\nAnyway, I love series. I read a lot of them. Today’s topic is my favorite book in ten series. Here are those books:\n\nWhere the Drowned Girls Go by Seanan McGuire is the seventh novel in the Wayward Children series. Even though I didn’t give this book 5 stars, it’s my favorite so far because I connected strongly to the central character, Cora. Besides both of us being plus size, our personalities and experiences are very similar. The plot of Where the Drowned Girls Go is also one of my favorites in the series. I deeply resonated with the themes covered, specifically regarding children breaking free from adult expectations.\n\nHeartstopper, Vol. 4 by Alice Oseman is the most emotional installment in the series. Though their relationship is solid, Nick and Charlie go through serious growing pains, especially Charlie. He suffers from an eating disorder but is actively trying to deal with his mental illness. Nick is doing what he can to be there for Charlie while contending with family drama. While the overall Heartstopper series is sweet and adorable, Volume 4 carries a more serious tone throughout.\n\nThe Burning God by R.F. Kuang is the finale of The Poppy War trilogy, one of my favorite series. It’s the most intense and heartbreaking installment, wrapping up in a bittersweet yet realistic way. While I enjoyed the previous two books, The Burning God is what solidified The Poppy War as a favorite series. My only regret is not listening to the entirety on audiobook.\n\nThe One and Only Ruby by Katherine Applegate is the third book in a middle grade fantasy series with zoo animals. This one is the backstory of baby elephant Ruby, who lived in the wild until she was sent to the roadside zoo. While the other books in the series are all emotional, Ruby’s story is especially tragic. Ruby is also my favorite of the three main characters.\n\nAurora Burning by Amie Kaufman and Jay Kristoff is the second novel in the Aurora Rising trilogy. While the first book was very good and the finale was well done, so much action happened in Aurora Burning. Each of the characters also undergo varying degrees of development. Some are also dealing with grief, trauma, and complicated family dynamics or romantic relationships. Aurora Burning is a far cry from “second book slump.”\n\nReflection by Elizabeth Lim is my favorite book in the Disney Twisted Tales series so far. It’s a reimagining of the animated Mulan movie. In it, Mulan travels to the underworld to save Li Shang. In doing so, she catches the eye of powerful immortal beings who don’t want her to leave. The underworld setting was atmospheric. Mulan goes through a deep personal journey, much deeper than the film. None of the other Disney Twisted Tales have hit this hard.\n\nUnearthly by Cynthia Hand is the first novel in a young adult paranormal romance trilogy with angels and demons. This series was so much fun, if a bit melodramatic. But the first book is definitely the strongest.\n\nAn Ember in the Ashes by Sabaa Tahir is the first book in another of my all-time favorite series. I didn’t know if I would like it, but the hype on BookTube got me to borrow it from the library. In the end, An Ember in the Ashes sold me on the high fantasy genre. Plus, it proved stepping out of my comfort zone is sometimes a good idea.\n\nBloodlines by Richelle Mead is the first book in the spin-off series to the Vampire Academy series. I enjoyed it way more than I expected, one of the biggest reading surprises I’ve ever had. Unfortunately, I don’t have any plans to finish the series. I love Sydney Sage, but when Richelle Mead introduced Adrian Ivashkov’s POV, I immediately tuned out.\n\nThe Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan is the second novel in The Heroes of Olympus series. Besides being my favorite in the series, it’s my favorite book by Rick Riordan that I’ve read so far. There’s a lot of Percy Jackson, who is a force of nature in this installment, as well as his companions Hazel and Frank.\n\nWhat are your favorite books in series you’ve read?\n\nI started blogging in 2016 and, truthfully, my essentials haven’t changed. I am very much of the philosophy “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.”\n\nWhat could I not blog without? First, notebooks and pens. When I get an idea for a blog post, I write out a rough draft in a notebook. Handwriting blogs first helps put thoughts to paper. This is the part where I cross off sentences, make mistakes, and change my mind. If I don’t like the final product, I leave it in my notebooks (or cross out the whole post), then move on.\n\nThe next blogging essential are Post-it notes. These help keep track of posts inside my notebooks. Larger ones are for blog drafts, while the smaller tabs are for ideas I want to potentially revisit. Meaning, if I write out an idea, but I don’t think it’s complete or it needs more work, I will use one of those little tabs to mark the page. If I return to the tab, I will either start over or scrap it altogether.\n\nAnother blogging essential I need is, obviously, my laptop. After handwriting the blog posts, I type them out in Microsoft Word. Once finished, I wait at least a full day, then edit and post/schedule the blog. In between the draft and the final edit, I make a title graphic on Canva. Preferably, right after I finish typing the first draft.\n\nDo I have to have a posting schedule? No, I do not. I’ve tried over the years to stick to one. Periodically, I will for a bit, only for it to fall through later. I try not to force it, because blogging is a hobby. While it’s good to have a writing portfolio, blogging was never something I never wanted to revolve my life around.\n\nI do rely on a set TBR to make sure I get through all the books on my list. I have my TBR Word document of all the unread books I own (or want to own). I also write other lists of TBR books, library books, and audiobooks I want to read at the moment. That’s why I bought little notebooks from Redbubble, to write out those reading lists. It’s partially why I bought the TBR cart. This serves the same purpose as the paper list, while also having the books out where I can see them. Unfortunately, I frequently change my mind.\n\nWhat have I discovered that helps my blogging most? The biggest lesson I learned was not to force creativity. If I don’t feel like writing, I do not make myself write. If I attempt it while in that state, I produce crappy work. When I want to get back to writing blogs after a break, I war my writing juices back up by free writing in a notebook.\n\nTo be honest, despite my previous statement, there are times I am frustrated with myself when I take an extended break from blogging. If I have a full-time job, I give myself a little bit of grace. However, during the times I’m unemployed and I’m struggling with writer’s block, it hits differently. During those times, I don’t have much else to motivate me to maintain a routine. I also get frustrated when I can’t bring myself to read. When I can’t do either, my mental health struggles.\n\nThat’s why I keep blogging. I’m currently working a temp job that is supposed to last until the first week of September. In the meantime, I will be doing my best to utilize my stock of essentials and keep up blogging. Because I’m not done yet.\n\nIn case you missed my July wrap up, I mentioned I started a new temp job this week. For the next month and a half, I will be covering someone’s medical leave as a Welcome Ambassador at the research library of a college I’ve worked at previously. While I’m glad to finally have work, Imposter Syndrome hit me hard…\n\nLast month, I was in the throes of a major reading (and blogging) slump. My usual methods, like reading picture books or picking up an old favorite, weren’t working. I went to the library and borrowed a bunch of books I almost returned. Eventually, I decided to clear off most of the books originally on my TBR cart and write out a whole new reading list. Right now, I’m satisfied with my new end of the year reading plans.\n\nHowever, I have no idea what this new temp job will look like. I tend to throw all my energy into each new assignment. Even though there might be quiet times for me to read, I don’t want to make too ambitious of a TBR for August.\n\nAs such, I fully anticipate not reading through all the books on my August 2024 TBR. That being said, it’s nice to be excited about reading again.\n\nHere are the books I hope to read this month:\n\nLibrary books\n\nThe Secret Garden: the graphic novel by Mariah Marsden is an adaption of my favorite children’s book.\n\nLegends & Lattes by Travis Baldree is a cozy fantasy everyone seems to love about an ogre opening a coffeeshop.\n\nBookshops & Bonedust by Travis Baldree is the prequel to Legends and Lattes, centered around a bookstore in a seaside town.\n\nMy Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh is one of the books I chose to read from a Goodreads article of most read books in 2024. It’s called “weird girl fiction,” following a young woman agreeing to a strange sleeping experiment to escape her grief.\n\nEveryone in My Family Has Killed Someone by Benjamin Stevenson is a thriller from the same aforementioned Goodreads article. It follows a strange man from an evener stranger family of killers.\n\nConceal, Don’t Feel by Jen Calonita is a reimagining of the movie Frozen, where Elsa and Ana were seperated as children but don’t remember each other.\n\nGo the Distance by Jen Calonita is a reimagining of the movie Hercules, set after the events of the film. Rather than Hercules living on Earth with Meg as a mortal, she chooses to pursue godhood and join Mt. Olympus. But to do so, she must save her ex-boyfriend’s wife. The same ex-boyfriend whom she sold her soul for.\n\nSo This is Love by Elizabeth Lim is a reimagining of the animated Cinderella movie. Instead of Cinderella trying on the glass slipper, it’s stolen by her stepmother. Her happily ever after gone, she finally escapes her circumstances by accepting a job as a seamstress at the palace, only to get swept up in a fairy plot.\n\nFate Be Changed by Farrah Rochon is the most recent release in the Disney Twisted Tales series is a reimagining of the movie Brave. Instead of Merida turning her mother into a bear, the witch sends her back in time to when her parents were teenagers, and she must help them stop an invading force.\n\nWhat Once Was Mine by Liz Braswell is a reimagining of the movie Tangled. Instead of the Sundrop flower, Rapunzel is accidentally fed a flower from the Moondrop and is gifted with the power to kill.\n\nTBR Books\n\nThe Girl from the Sea by Molly Knox Ostertag follows a teen girl who falls in love with a mermaid.\n\nThe Magic Fish by Trung Le Nyugen follows a teen boy using art to come out to his parents.\n\nSquad by Maggie Tokuda-Hall follows a teen girl joining a group of other girls at her new school with a wolfish secret.\n\nCrumbs by Danie Stirling follows a seer struggling with her powers, but is distracted by her feelings for a co-worker at the magical bakery she works at.\n\nThe Prince and the Dressmaker by Jen Wang follows a prince who comes into his identity as a fashionista with the help of his best friend, a talented dressmaker.\n\nHey, Kiddo by Jarrett J. Krosoczka is the author’s memoir on growing up with a drug addicted mother and finding his lost father.\n\nCoven by Jennifer Dugan follows a teen witch finally embracing her fire magic when her family is hunted by a serial killer.\n\nOver My Dead Body by Sweeney Boo follows a witch investigating the disappearance of her classmate in the woods surrounding her mysterious boarding school.\n\nThe Library: A Fragile History by Andrew Pettegree is a nonfiction book on the history of libraries and librarians that I’ve been avoiding for way too long.\n\nWhat are your reading plans for August?\n\nJuly of 2024 has both good news and bad news.\n\nThe bad news? I hit my dreaded massive mid-year reading slump.\n\nThe good news? I got a job!\n\nI started yesterday (I pre-scheduled a couple posts) and, to be honest, I’m a bit apprehensive. Even though it’s at an institution I’ve worked at before, Imposter Syndrome is real. While I’m looking forward to making money and learning a new job, after such a long stretch of unemployment, I’m really starting to doubt myself. Plus, I’m still hoping to hear back from a full-time job I interviewed for earlier in this month.This new temp job started Monday (July 29th) and is expected to end September 9th. A month and a half, and I’m back at it again….\n\nHonestly, this past week has been rough on me mentally. There wasn’t any “prep” to go into this new job, only a few pieces of paperwork. But after so many months stuck at home sending out fruitless job applications…having to wait a week before working made me way too anxious. Being in a reading slump didn’t help, either.\n\nJuly of 2024 was mostly picture books, with one random reread. The ratings are all over the place, just like my emotions. Even though I didn’t really want to, I made myself take a reading break. My usual methods—picture books, rereading, reaching for books outside my comfort zone—weren’t working. Eventually, I realized the best way to get excited about reading again was to completely redo my TBR cart, changing my reading plans for the rest of the year.\n\nFinally, the good news is I read 17 books in July. The bad news is, I don’t have more than a sentence to say about them.\n\nChubby Bunny by Julie Murphy\n\n5 stars\n\nLibrary book\n\nChubby Bunny is a body positive picture book I wish I had as a kid.\n\nFranklin’s Flying Bookshop by Jen Campbell\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibrary book\n\nFranklin’s Flying Bookshop is a gorgeous picture book with a book-loving dragon.\n\nTokyo Night Parade by J.P. Takahashi\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibrary book\n\nTokyo Night Parade is a stunning picture book that deserves the awards it won.\n\nNoura’s Crescent Moon by Zainab Khan\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibrary book\n\nNoura’s Crescent Moon is a beautifully illustrated Ramadan picture book.\n\nThe Ocean Gardener by Clara Angaruzzi\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibrary book\n\nThe Ocean Gardener is a picture book that did not meet expectations.\n\nAnd Yet You Shine by Supriya Kelkar\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibrary book\n\nAnd Yet You Shine is a cleverly written picture book that incorporates a dark history.\n\nI Lived Inside a Whale by Xin Li\n\n5 stars\n\nLibrary book\n\nI Lived Inside a Whale is a picture book for those who were introverted readers as kids.\n\nSylvia’s Bookshop by Robert Burleigh\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibrary book\n\nSylvia’s Bookshop is a fun picture bookset at an infamous bookstore in 1920s France.\n\nEyes That Weave the World’s Wonders by Joanna Ho\n\n5 stars\n\nLibby audiobook\n\nEyes That Weave the World’s Wonders is an emotional picture book on interracial adoption.\n\nThe Princess Saves Herself in This One by Amanda Lovelace\n\n5 stars\n\nReread/Everand audiobook\n\nThe Princess Saves Herself in This One is a poetry collection that will always hold a special place in my heart.\n\nNo Cats in the Library by Lauren Emmons\n\n5 stars\n\nLibby e-book\n\nNo Cats in the Library is a sweet picture book about a cat who loves books.\n\nBlue by Nana Ekua Brew-Hammond\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibby e-book\n\nBlue is a look at the shocking history and societal impact of the color.\n\nStella Brings the Family by Miriam B. Schiffer\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibby e-book\n\nStella Brings the Family is a cute story on how a family without a mom is still a family.\n\nWhen Aidan Became a Brother by Kyle Lukoff\n\n5 stars\n\nLibby e-book\n\nWhen Aidan Became a Brother is a banned picture book on breaking gender barriers.\n\nGrandfather’s Journey by Allen Say\n\n5 stars\n\nLibby e-book\n\nGrandfather’s Journey is a nice, simple family story.\n\nKeepunumuk by Danielle Greendeer\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibby e-book\n\nKeepunumuk is a beautiful book on friendship and sharing the earth.\n\nStone Soup by Marcia Brown\n\nNo Rating\n\nLibby e-book\n\nStone Soup is an older picture book I’m not sure what to make of.\n\nHow well did your reading go in July?\n\nDespite my best efforts, I’ve been in a heavy reading slump the past two weeks.\n\nConsidering I’m currently unemployed, this reading slump is very inconvenient. Taking a break is not an option, so I tried my other methods. I read a handful of picture books and that didn’t work. Then, I thought about rereading an old favorite…and it still didn’t work.\n\nI thought it was genre-based, as I specifically reread a book from a genre I had not read a lot from this year. However, I still don’t feel like reading.\n\nAm I going to reread another book? I’m not sure at the moment. Still, it got me thinking: what books do I own would I like to reread?\n\nTurns out, that list was harder to narrow down than I thought.\n\nThe Game of Love and Death by Martha Brockenbrough was one of my favorite books of 2015 and it’s a book I think about regularly. I pulled this book off my shelf twice this month with the intention of rereading. But I’m nervous to reread The Game of Love and Death. I reread another favorite from the same year and it deeply disappointed me. I don’t want to know if The Game of Love and Death is not what I remembered.\n\nThe Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a young adult historical fiction set during World War II. This is another favorite book from ten years ago that I still think about often. I flew through it when I read it the first time, even though it was dark and depressing immediately. As such, The Book Thief is something I need to be specifically wanting in order to reread it.\n\nThe Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern is a book I’ve wanted to give a second chance for years. I read it way back in 2013, around the time it was hyped on BookTube. To be honest, back then I had a bad habit of not finishing books because I was often reading too many at once. I’m pretty sure I stopped reading The Night Circus before finishing it. I also think I liked it, so I don’t know why I gave up. Maybe I should consider a reread….\n\nThe Dead House by Dawn Kurtagich is a young adult horror novel told in mixed media format that I really loved in 2016. It was also one of my favorites I read that year, too. At the time, I thought the concept was super unique. The scary scenes genuinely freaked me, which isn’t easy for me. The Dead House is another old favorite I’m scared to reread. I was a different reader back then. That once intriguing concept might not hold up anymore.\n\nAnd Then There Were None by Agatha Christie is a book I seriously considered rereading this month. It’s a fast-paced classic mystery following a group of shady people being killed off one by one as they are trapped on an island during a storm. The atmosphere alone makes it the ideal book to read for spooky season. Now that I think of it, And Then There Were None might be just the book to get me out this slump…\n\nThe Fountains of Silence by Ruta Sepetys is a young adult historical fiction novel set in Barcelona, Spain at the height of Francisco Franco’s dictatorship in the 1950s. I’ve read three of Ruta Sepeteys’s books so far, though two out of the three are too beautifully painful to reread again (at least not anytime soon). The Fountains of Silence, however, was a “right book, wrong time.” I read this in 2020, when my mental health was most challenged due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. While I did think of itas a favorite that year, I don’t think I loved it as much as I could have.\n\nWhat is a book you think you want to reread?\n\nWhile I was in graduate school, I had an assignment in one of my classes called “my reading autobiography.” This was all about my history with reading, starting from babyhood and well into adulthood. If it wasn’t ten pages, I would post it here. It is arguably my favorite school assignment I have ever done.\n\nSo, thank you, Let’s Talk Bookish for allowing me the opportunity to recreate it in a blog format.\n\nI was always a reader; I don’t know exactly how I got into it or how old I was when I began to read on my own. But it’s all likely it’s rooted in my dad reading bedtime stories to my brother and me. My mom worked most nights, so my dad had to put two little kids to bed by himself. Reading to us is what got us to settle down after brushing our teeth, washing our hands and faces so bugs won’t eat them (or so my mom said), and changing into our pajamas.\n\nEven though I might have loved it immediately, I didn’t develop a consistent reading habit until second or third grade. Or what was consistent for a kid who also liked computer games and watching TV. The habit steadily grew in middle school and finally solidified in high school. But through all this…the adults around me weren’t always supportive.\n\nWhile he appreciated that I liked to read, my dad didn’t necessarily support my book-buying habits. Considering the various states of our living room over the past few years…I can’t entirely blame him. Still, he’s never actively tried to stop me, either.\n\nMy dad claims he was a reader until adulthood. He mentioned once he’d read Dune by Frank Herbert at night when I was a baby. It must have been between then and my brother being born that he stopped reading. Regardless, I buy him books every Christmas, which he says he will read when he retires. So, we have to wait and see.\n\nAs for my mom, she seemed to mostly stick to Stephan King. But I barely remember her reading anything when I was growing up. She might’ve tried occasionally, though nothing stuck for too long as far as I know. Especially since she was so sick in the later years of her life.\n\nHowever, unlike my dad, she wasn’t always the most appreciative of me being a reader. She wanted me to be a “normal kid.” She might’ve been fine with it had the most judgmental of my aunts had not been in her ear and my maternal grandmother wasn’t carrying on about all the sports and activities my cousins were into.\n\nThe only person in my family who truly supported my love of reading as a kid was my maternal aunt. She’s a librarian and she was more than happy to gift me books. But she lives in Texas while I live in Massachusetts. She didn’t get to visit more than once a year, if ever. She was also the only other avid reader in my family.\n\nSo, it goes without saying, I found my love of reading virtually on my own.\n\nTruthfully, I didn’t find any adults who supported my love of reading until seventh grade. My high school teachers loved seeing me reading during down times, especially my English teachers. English was my favorite subject in school, and the only class I was an honors student. A love of reading is one of the reasons I chose to pursue a Bachelor of Arts in English literature, with a concentration in creative writing. My professors in college definitely loved the fact that I liked to read—especially since I participated in class.\n\nWhich books started my love of reading? There are a lot of books I read as a kid that I remember reading but cannot recall the title. These are just the ones that stick out the most in my memory.\n\nThe Sweet Valley franchise by Francine Pascal made up most of my childhood reading, starting from elementary school and into eighth grade. It started with a random book I found in the school library and led to an obsession lasting for years. I read Sweet Valley Kids, Sweet Valley Twins, Sweet Valley High, and Sweet Valley University. And despite being there so many books, they were hard to find. This only fueled my obsession. It didn’t help that these were the only books I insisted on reading.\n\nThe Secret Garden by Frances Burnett Dodgson is the first classic novel I ever read. I was in roughly second grade when I read it. Someone, presumably my aunt, had gifted me a set of abridged classic novels. The Secret Garden is the only one I remember reading. But I loved it, so that’s probably why.\n\nTales of a Fourth Grade Nothing by Judy Blume is the book that turned me into a writer.\n\nThe American Girl Doll books, specifically, Samantha, Molly, Emily, Kirsten, and Kit, as well as one Girl of the Year named Kylie. I loved the dolls growing up. I wanted to know everything about these fictional girls, so I devoured the books that came with the dolls.\n\nLooking back over this post, I remember there was a time my dad said to me I wasn’t going to want to read. At the time, I didn’t believe him. But considering how my reading habits have been recently…I’m starting to worry he might be right.\n\nHopefully, I can be a reader just a little bit longer."
