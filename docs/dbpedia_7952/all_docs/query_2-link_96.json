        "text": "This promised to be the most intriguing book that had been handed to me. I am always on the look out for books about friendship, family and forbidden secrets, but those of you who enjoy the sad, mysterious and slightly haunting will not be disappointed.\n\nWhen Becky moves to Oakbridge everything turns upside down. The finding of a photo under her mum's bed leads to a dark discovery, and the beautiful butterfly garden gives her comfort, but leads her to become curious about selfish stranger Rosamay. Is she hiding something? In the heart of the sun-drenched summer, it seems that Becky is not the only one hiding a dangerous, dark secret.\n\nWhen you start reading it is unputdownable. I liked different parts of the book because you always want to know more, although the adventure was pretty predictable. The protagonists in the story are teenage girls, so I think that is Conway's audience: 10-12 year olds girls who are interested in friendship and family novels.\n\nI have never encountered the author before or read any of her books, but I like how she structured the story and merged everything together. Exciting, mesmerising and suspenseful, Butterfly Summer is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. I am planning to read one of her other books, Forbidden Friends. I would give this book a five star rating because it was a riveting read!"
