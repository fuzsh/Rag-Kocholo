        "text": "The creative project for my Master of Philosophy Creative Writing was conceived as a time-slip fantasy for 8 to 12-year-old readers with the working title Time Squad. It tells the story of an 11-year-old girl, Tiggy, who moves to Brisbane after her mother inherits the family’s overgrown ‘ancestral home’. Tiggy and her new neighbour Hamish discover the ghost of the original owner, Sir Harry Barnard, has set them a quest. In fulfilling the quest they solve a series of century-old puzzles and challenges and finally reveal the full magic of the old house. The book is designed as the first in a light-hearted optimistic holiday adventure series written for emerging readers and pursuing themes of the environment, Australian identity, what it means to be an Australian girl, our history – both personal and national – and the ghosts who speak to us from it. However, I found issues such as divorce, family conflicts and financial difficulties emerging as I wrote, pushing my optimistic adventure novel into domestic issues-based territory. At some level, I seemed to believe that writing well for contemporary children needed to involve serious life issues. This led me to ask two questions in my critical paper ‘Putting the Child back into Children’s Literature’. What qualifies as excellent children’s literature for younger readers today? And, are younger readers well served by that standard? This exegesis uses the work of developmental psychologist Jean Piaget and Gough and Tunmer (The Simple View of Reading) to create an understanding of younger readers’ systems of thought, modes of cognition, decoding skills and life experience. Applying this developmental framework to five years of winning books from the peak children’s literature awards of the Newbery Medal (USA), Carnegie Medal (UK) and Children’s Book Council of Australia Book of the Year, the analysis concludes that eight out of 15 awardwinning novels did not meet younger readers on their development curve. This was predominantly caused by a traumatic reality which set too high a listening comprehension (LC) factor for Gough and Tunmer, and in Piaget’s terms, required a higher stage of development than the concrete operational younger reader. A trend toward prizing issues-based literature has developed which may explain the initial pressure I felt as a writer to move away from my creative vision for Time Squad. Recognising that the movement toward prizing realist, trauma-based texts may not serve younger readers allowed me to justify alternate solid ground for excellence in positioning the themes, characters, settings, language and plot in Time Squad closer to my original creative vision, better meeting 8 to 12-year-olds on their development curve. An optimistic outdoor holiday adventure, functional families, simple language and a happy ending are still worthwhile for contemporary younger readers.\n\nConcentrating on the problems of black people, many writers produced remarkable novels in the literary world. Racism, colourism, child abuse, religion, poverty, terrorism etc., are the main concepts, the authors prefer to write in their literary works. Colonial conflicts, colour discriminations, economic differences, are rampant throughout the world. The traumatic experiences of minority people in many countries are being revealed to the world by many courageous writers. Tony Morrison is the one who is ready to mention the problems of the black people, gender discrimination and child abuse. In her latest novel God Help the Child, she has discussed the traumatic events of the small children, child exploitation both emotional and physical, relationship between parents and children in a realistic way. Thematically, this is a diverse novel. The sheer power, nuances and poetry make this book another masterpiece in her account. Morrison imbues this novel with her great mastery of prose wh...\n\nToni Morrison's eleventh novel, God Help the Child continues the retellings of her Story with the spotlight this time round on the child. Morrison has often captured specific moments in histories, culture and politics to locate her narratives. In God Help the Child, for the very first time, she sets the story in the present. The excavations of various themes and characters of her preceding novels are revisited to presage a new beginning, individually as well as collectively, through the recounting of the past to the promise of a child yet to be born. The retelling points forward to a future that is powerfully shaped by the ever at hand confluence of the legacy of the past and of life in the present."
