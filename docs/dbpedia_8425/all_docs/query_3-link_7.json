        "text": "...\n\nAlba Iulia Fast Facts\n\n...\n\nAlba Iulia General Information\n\nThe gentle climate and the richness of the soil made the area around Alba Iulia inhabitable since ancient times and established Alba as a leading wine growing region since 1st century AD. Northwest of Alba Iulia are the Apuseni Mountains and in the east the Transylvanian Plateau with its rolling hills and deep, wide valleys.\n\nOne of the oldest settlements in Romania, known in ancient time as Apulum, Alba Iulia served as the largest military and economic center during the Roman occupation. Temples, mosaics, thermae and statues, amphitheaters, the governor's palace \"Daciarum Trium\" – all rendered the original Dacian Apulul as the miniature copy of the mother Rome.\n\nAn Episcopal citadel and an important political, military and cultural center, Alba Iulia reached its peak between 1542-1690, serving as the capital of the independent Principality of Transylvania and the residence of the Transylvanian princes. In 1599, Mihai Viteazul (Michael the Brave) achieved here for a brief period of time the union of the three main provinces of Romania: Walachia, Transylvania, and Moldavia. The town later became an important printing centre. Nowadays the local universities continue the tradition of the old academic schools.\n\nThe peasant revolt led by Horea, Closca and Crisan, executed on February 28, 1785 on the Pitchfork Hill (Dealul Furcii) turned the town of Alba Iulia into a symbol of the fight for justice and freedom.\n\nIt was here that on December 1st 1918 the province of Transylvania announced its unification with Romania. In 1922 Prince Ferdinand was crowned King of Romania in an act which mirrored the union achieved more than four centuries earlier by Mihai Viteazul.\n\nAlba means white and comes from the time when the Slavics called the settlement Belgrade (\"White Castle\").\n\nIulia comes from the name of Romanian Prince Gelu (Iulius in Latin) who ruled over the land around Alba Iulia during the 10th century. The Habsburgs tried to impose the name Alba Carolina (Karlsburg) in honor of the emperor Charles VI. In 1918 the town became once again Alba Iulia.\n\nIn the old town visitors can stroll along the wide, tree-lined streets of the Habsburg citadel, one of the most impressive in Europe, to discover the historical, cultural and architectural places of interest of Alba Iulia: the Roman Catholic Cathedral – the oldest and most valuable monument of architecture in Transylvania, the Batthyaneum Library, the Orthodox Cathedral of the Reunification, the Babilon Building – housing the National Museum of Unification, the Union Hall, the Apor Palace, the Princely Palace, and the University of Alba Iulia.\n\n...\n\nAlba Iulia Sights and Landmarks\n\nAlba Iulia Vauban Fortress\n\nCetatea Alba Iulia\n\nThe plans of Alba Iulia fortress - inspired by Vauban military architectural systems - were drawn by Italian architect Giovanni Morando Visconti. Completed in 1735, is the largest of this kind in Southeastern Europe. The fortress is outstanding both for its architectural elements and for the beauty of its six gates, unique in European military structures. Doubtless the artists, sculptors Johann Koning, Johan Vischer and Giuseppe Tencalla, had been inspired by ancient mythology.\n\nAbout 7.2 miles of ramparts made of brick and quarry stones form a seven-point star shape with seven bastions (Eugene of Savoia, St. Stephen, The Trinity, St. Michael, St. Carol, St. Capistrano and St. Elisabeth) guarded by six monumental gates - wornderful examples of early baroque - a style that characterizes the 18th century Transylvanian architecture.\n\nAlba Iulia Princely Palace\n\nPalatul Princiar\n\nThe Princely Palace, built in the 16th century, was Prince Mihai Viteazul's residence during the first political unification of Romanians in the 1600s. Following Ottoman and Tatar invasions the palace was destroyed. During the rule of princes Gábor Bethlen and George II Rakoczi the palace was restored but not to its previous condition. From 1700 on, the building was used as military barracks.\n\nOpposite the palace the Union Hall (Sala Unirii) is the room where where the unification act between kingdom of Romania and Transylvania was signed, during the Great National Assembly meeting of December 1st 1918.\n\nThe Batthyaneum Library\n\nBiblioteca Batthyaneum\n\nIn 1780, Ignac Batthyany, bishop of Transylvania, transformed a former Unitarian church into one of the most famous libraries in Transylvania. The Batthyaneum library is known all over the world for its rare manuscripts - over 60,000 documents, including the Codex Aureus (9th century), also known as the Lorsch Gospel, containing the Gospel of Mark and Matthew, David's Psalms, Codex Burgundus (15th century), Biblia Sacra (13th century) the Pentateuch from OrÄÅtie (1850), Åerban Cantacuzino's Bible, and the New Testament from Balgrad (1648).\n\nThe first astronomical observatory in Transylvania was founded here in 1792.\n\nApor Palace\n\nPalatul Apor\n\nApor Palace is located nearby the Bathyaneum Library. Built in the second half of the 17th century, it served as the residence of Prince Apor, and at the beginning of the 18th century as that of Austrian army leader, Prince Steinville.\n\nHistoric Churches\n\nOrthodox Cathedral of the Reunification\n\nCatedrala ArhiepiscopalÄ Alba Iulia\n\nAddress: Str.

This place or worship features one of the most impressive early Renaissance interiors in Transylvania. The light coming in from the Gothic windows helps create inside an ethereal atmosphere. The tombs of Prince Iancu de Hunedoara (c.1400 – 1456) and that of Polish-born Isabella JagieÅÅo (1519 – 1559), former Queen of Hungary are located in the cathedral.\n\n...\n\nAlba Iulia Museums\n\nNational Unification Museum\n\nMuzeul National al Unirii\n\nAddress: Str.
