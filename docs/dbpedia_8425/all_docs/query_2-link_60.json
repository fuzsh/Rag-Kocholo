Originally called Tomis, legend has it that Constanta was visited by Jason and the Argonauts after finding the Golden Fleece.\n\nFounded by Greek colonists from Miletos in the 6th century BC, Tomis was conquered by the Romans in 71 BC and renamed Constantiana by Roman Emperor Constantine the Great, in honor of his sister. Constanta flourished during the 13th century, when Genoese merchants dominated the Black Sea but, the city began to decline two centuries later, when it fell under Turkish rule. During the Ottoman era its name was shortened to Constanta . Fine mansions and hotels were built at the end of the 19th century when King Carol I decided to revive Constanta as a port and seaside resort.\n\nConstanta is today one of Romania's largest cities and an important cultural and economic centre, worth exploring for its archaeological treasures and the Old Town's architecture. Its historical monuments, ancient ruins, grand Casino, museums and shops, and proximity to beach resorts make it the focal point of Black Sea coast tourism. Open-air restaurants, nightclubs and cabarets offer a wide variety of entertainment.\n\nSandy beaches of the Black Sea, old villages, wineries, ancient monuments and the Danube Delta are the best known attractions in or near Constanta.\n\nSights and Landmarks\n\nConstanta is more than just the entry point to the Black Sea coast.

Between 1677 and 1678, the residence of Pasha of Silistra was established here to better observe the troop movements of the Russians, with whom Turkey was at war.\n\nThe name of the town comes from Baba (meaning father in Arabic) and Dagh (meaning mountain). Legend has it that a few centuries ago, here lived a shepherd called Korun Baba. One day, while leading his flock, he met some Turkish monks who asked him of Sari Saltuk's tomb. The shepherd answered that he knows nothing of this tomb, but that he noticed that on the mountain's peak, his sheep avoid a place covered with stones. The monks started digging that place, and at sunset found the bones of the saint. Then the monks raised the mausoleum that can still be seen standing today. Upon the shepherd's death, the locals buried him close to the Muslim saint. Legend also has it that the very place where the shepherd rested, the earth split in two, in order to mark the tomb.\n\nThe Museum of Oriental Art in Babadag is worth paying a visit.
