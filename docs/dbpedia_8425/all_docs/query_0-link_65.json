        "text": "Solar PV Analysis of Alba Iulia\n\nList of Solar PV Installers for Alba Iulia, Romania\n\nSituated in Alba Iulia, Romania (coordinates 46.0653, 23.5917), the potential for solar power generation is substantial due to the high average daily kilowatt-hours (kWh) per kilowatt (kW) of installed solar panels across all seasons. During summer and spring, these averages are notably high at 6.55 kWh and 4.79 kWh respectively, indicating a robust solar energy yield.\n\nThe geographical positioning of Alba Iulia within the Northern Temperate Zone contributes significantly to this outcome as it typically receives extensive sunlight hours compared to other global locations. This exposure provides an optimal environment for efficient photovoltaic (PV) energy production.\n\nHowever, despite these favorable conditions, certain factors could potentially impede solar production in this area. Weather patterns can fluctuate and periods of cloudiness may decrease system output by limiting sunlight access to the panels.\n\nTo mitigate such challenges and ensure greater energy production consistency throughout the year, specific installation strategies can be employed in Alba Iulia's context. For instance, orienting fixed panel installations towards a tilt angle of 39 degrees South will optimize their exposure to incoming sunlight.\n\nIt's also worth noting that while autumn and winter have lower average daily kWh per kW values at 3.15 and 1.40 respectively; these figures still demonstrate that even during less sunny seasons there is a worthwhile level of solar power generation achievable in this location.\n\nNote: The Northern Temperate Zone extends from 35° latitude North up to 66.5° latitude.\n\nSo far, we have conducted calculations to evaluate the solar photovoltaic (PV) potential in 71 locations across Romania. This analysis provides insights into each city/location's potential for harnessing solar energy through PV installations.\n\nLink: Solar PV potential in Romania by location\n\nSolar output per kW of installed solar PV by season in Alba Iulia\n\nSeasonal solar PV output for Latitude: 46.0653, Longitude: 23.5917 (Alba Iulia, Romania), based on our analysis of 8760 hourly intervals of solar and meteorological data (one whole year) retrieved for that set of coordinates/location from NASA POWER (The Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources) API:\n\n&nbsp\n\nIdeally tilt fixed solar panels 39° South in Alba Iulia, Romania\n\nTo maximize your solar PV system's energy output in Alba Iulia, Romania (Lat/Long 46.0653, 23.5917) throughout the year, you should tilt your panels at an angle of 39° South for fixed panel installations.\n\nAs the Earth revolves around the Sun each year, the maximum angle of elevation of the Sun varies by +/- 23.45 degrees from its equinox elevation angle for a particular latitude. Finding the exact optimal angle to maximise solar PV production throughout the year can be challenging, but with careful consideration of historical solar energy and meteorological data for a certain location, it can be done precisely.\n\nWe use our own calculation, which incorporates NASA solar and meteorological data for the exact Lat/Long coordinates, to determine the ideal tilt angle of a solar panel that will yield maximum annual solar output. We calculate the optimal angle for each day of the year, taking into account its contribution to the yearly total PV potential at that specific location.\n\nAt Latitude: 46.0653, Longitude: 23.5917, the ideal angle to tilt panels is 39° South\n\nSeasonally adjusted solar panel tilt angles for Alba Iulia, Romania\n\nIf you can adjust the tilt angle of your solar PV panels, please refer to the seasonal tilt angles below for optimal solar energy production in Alba Iulia, Romania. As mentioned earlier, for fixed-panel solar PV installations, it is optimal to maintain a 39° South tilt angle throughout the year.\n\nOverall Best Summer Angle Overall Best Autumn Angle Overall Best Winter Angle Overall Best Spring Angle 29° South in Summer 50° South in Autumn 59° South in Winter 38° South in Spring\n\nAssuming you can modify the tilt angle of your solar PV panels throughout the year, you can optimize your solar generation in Alba Iulia, Romania as follows: In Summer, set the angle of your panels to 29° facing South. In Autumn, tilt panels to 50° facing South for maximum generation. During Winter, adjust your solar panels to a 59° angle towards the South for optimal energy production. Lastly, in Spring, position your panels at a 38° angle facing South to capture the most solar energy in Alba Iulia, Romania.\n\nOur recommendations take into account more than just latitude and Earth's position in its elliptical orbit around the Sun. We also incorporate historical solar and meteorological data from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) API to assign a weight to each ideal angle for each day based on its historical contribution to overall solar PV potential during a specific season.\n\nThis approach allows us to provide much more accurate recommendations than relying solely on latitude, as it considers unique weather conditions in different locations sharing the same latitude worldwide.\n\nCalculate solar panel row spacing in Alba Iulia, Romania\n\nWe've added a feature to calculate minimum solar panel row spacing by location. Enter your panel size and orientation below to get the minimum spacing in Alba Iulia, Romania.\n\nOur calculation method\n\nSolar Position:\n\nWe determine the Sun's position on the Winter solstice using the location's latitude and solar declination.\n\nShadow Projection:\n\nWe calculate the shadow length cast by panels using trigonometry, considering panel tilt and the Sun's elevation angle.\n\nMinimum Spacing:\n\nWe add the shadow length to the horizontal space occupied by tilted panels.\n\nThis approach ensures maximum space efficiency while avoiding shading during critical times, as the Winter solstice represents the worst-case scenario for shadow length.\n\nPlease enter information above to calculate panel spacing.\n\nTopography for solar PV around Alba Iulia, Romania\n\nThe topography around Alba Iulia, Romania is predominantly flat. The nearby areas that would be most suitable for large-scale solar PV are the plains and open fields located to the east of the city. These areas have plenty of space for large-scale installations and receive a good amount of sunlight throughout the year. Additionally, there are no major obstacles such as trees or hills in these locations which could block sunlight from reaching the panels.\n\nRomania solar PV Stats as a country\n\nRomania ranks 39th in the world for cumulative solar PV capacity, with 1,398 total MW's of solar PV installed. This means that 3.40% of Romania's total energy as a country comes from solar PV (that's 24th in the world). Each year Romania is generating 74 Watts from solar PV per capita (Romania ranks 43rd in the world for solar PV Watts generated per capita). [source]\n\nAre there incentives for businesses to install solar in Romania?\n\nYes, there are incentives for businesses wanting to install solar energy in Romania. The Romanian government offers a number of financial incentives and subsidies for businesses that invest in renewable energy sources such as solar power. These include grants, tax deductions, and other forms of support. Additionally, the government has set up a Renewable Energy Support Scheme (RES) which provides additional funding for projects related to renewable energy sources such as solar power.\n\nDo you have more up to date information than this on incentives towards solar PV projects in Romania?
