        "text": "As the computer science field of study became increasingly prevalent, many had their doubts that this field of study would continue. It was not until the 1950s that computer science began to be observed as a legitimate science among academics. It is thanks to the IBM brand that this became part of the main-stream culture.\n\nRomanian university qualifications highly appreciated and recognized in Europe and beyond, lowest tuition fees and living cost in Europe. The Romanians have an old and rich history, especially in the capital Bucharest with its 2 million people. International students willing to study in Romania can apply either to the Ministry of Education and Research or to the chosen Romanian university, in order to receive the Letter of Acceptance.\n\nA bachelor's degree is given to students who fulfill the necessary requirements given by the college or university they are attending. The requirements include three to seven years of focus on a subject, typically referred to as a major or concentration."
