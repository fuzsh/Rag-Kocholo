        "text": "Much can be said about Alba Iulia and yet too little to include everything that this city means. Its foundation and transformation into today's city, the historical events that took place, the exceptional cultural heritage, the patriotic stories that marked the history of our country or the national commemorative events, are some of the themes already known by Romanian and foreign tourists. However, there are still unknown or forgotten things about one of the most beautiful cities in our country.\n\nIn today's real estate blog article we present you some of the lesser known details about Alba Iulia.\n\n1. The first medical textbook was printed in Alba Iulia, at the Metropolitan Printing House in Alba Iulia, in 1551. The manual included funny but impressive medical approaches for that period. It was written by doctor Paul Kyr, a well-known doctor who treated important personalities, including: Mihnea III, Petru Rares, Alexandru Lapusneanu, etc.\n\n2. The first artificial lung in the world, also called \"Biomotor\", was invented by the white-Julian doctor Rudolf Eisenmenger (1871-1946). His invention in 1900 was patented in Italy, Austria, England, Germany, USA, Spain, France, etc. The lung had the appearance of a shield that encompassed the anterior abdomen and lower thorax, and the aeromutator was operated with the foot. The \"biomotor\" has been a real success, being implemented in many hospitals and clinics.\n\n3. \"Lupus\" is the name of the largest cannon ever built in Transylvania, more precisely in Alba Iulia. Its construction was carried out in the workshops of the Citadel and was part of the heavy armament.\n\nThe movement of the cannon in the city of Sibiu was possible with the help of 80 pairs of oxen.\n\n4. The Tatar invasion between 1241-1243 was one of the most difficult moments for the city of Alba Iulia. The moment was narrated by the Italian monk Rogerius, in a work written by him. He tells how, in his flight from the Tartars, he reached Alba Iulia, which was a city full of bones and the heads of those killed. He also reported that the walls of churches and palaces were sprinkled with the blood of the victims.\n\n5. Alba Iulia has the largest fortification in southeastern Europe, namely the White Carolina Fortress. The fortress was built in the first half of the 18th century, after the project was approved by Prince Eugene of Savoy. At that time, the Habsburgs were consolidating their dominion over Transylvania, occupying fortifications that they were remodeling or building new ones.\n\n6. The son of the Romanian writer Mihail Sadoveanu, named Paul Mihail Sadoveanu, has his eternal place in the Heroes' Cemetery in Alba Iulia. He died at the age of 24 in the battles of Turda in 1942, for the liberation of Transylvania. It was decorated post-mortem, with the order \"Crown of Romania\".\n\n7. The city of Alba Iulia also brings the first Romanian hero from the Second World War. Nicolae Uratu was a pilot and fell on duty on the first day of the war, on June 22, 1941, together with the Blaj commander Cornel Batracui and the Transylvanian Vasile Caruntu. The plane in which the three were was shot down over the city of Belgrade.\n\n8. The cell in which Horea, the leader of the Transylvanian serf revolt against feudal coercion, was held, is located in the upper part of the Third Gate of the White Carolina Fortress. It has been closed for restoration for a long time, and since 2010 it is open to visitors.\n\nA material by Mirela Ionita"
