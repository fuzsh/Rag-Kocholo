        "text": "Alba Iulia is one of the first settlements in the country that, during the Roman occupation, carried the name of “Apulum”. During that period, it was the biggest economic and military centre in the area. The Tatar invasions of 1241 destroyed the city, but it was rebuilt when the city became the capital of the Principality of Transylvania between 1542 and 1690. Later, the city becomes a tributary of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlba Iulia was the first capital of the three Romanian Provinces (Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldova), rank granted by Michael the Brave (Mihai Viteazu) who laid the foundations of an ideal for which Romanians fought over time. It is here that the Great National Assembly, which was the basis for the realisation of the unitary state, took place on December 1, 1918. This was the moment when the action started three centuries before by Michael the Brave materialised.\n\nIn 1928, a general assembly was organised in Alba where over 100,000 citizens were chanting against the government. So, the city has, over time, witnessed effervescent political, historical and social events of hardship.\n\nThe city is situated in the central-Western part of the country and is a municipality in the Alba County. The city is situated along the middle course of the Mureș river in the centre of the Transylvanian basin. The surrounding area is made up of three geographical units: the Apuseni Mountains (in the North-West), the Transylvanian Alps (in the South) and the Transylvanian Basin (in the East). The neighbouring counties are: Cluj – in the North, Mureș and Sibiu – in the East, Vâlcea – in the South and Arad and Hunedoara – in the West.\n\nThe nearest airport to Alba Iulia is located in Sibiu, 76 km away.\n\nIn case you want to travel from Bucharest to Alba Iulia by train, then you should know that the journey takes around 8 hours. From the train station in Alba Iulia you can find daily direct connections to the majority of the cities and places in the country.\n\nIf you are looking for a quicker alternative, you can opt to travel by bus or minibus. Here you can find all the information you might need: the location of the bus stations and the stops, the arrival and departure schedules and the destinations.\n\nIn case you want to go from Bucharest to Alba Iulia by car the recommended route is: (E81) Bucharest – Pitești – Râmnicu Vâlcea – Sibiu – Alba Iulia."
