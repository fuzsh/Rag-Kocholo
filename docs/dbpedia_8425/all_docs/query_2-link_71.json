        "text": "Arrival: Bucharest - Sinaia - Brașov (Total Travel Distance: 190 km)\n\nYour adventure will likely most begin in Romania’s capital: Bucharest, although you do have the option to customize the journey to start in Brașov. In Bucharest, your guide will greet you at the airport and remain with you throughout your tour.\n\nFor your first stop, your guide will lead you on a personalized tour of the Palace of Parliament. Nicolae Ceauşescu built this enormous edifice--the single largest civilian administrative building worldwide and current home of Romania’s Senate, Chamber of Deputies, Legislative Council and Constitutional Court.\n\nWe’ll continue exploring Bucharest’s Old Town before heading out of the city north to Sinaia: a mountain resort located in the historical region of Muntenia. Named after Sinaia Monastery, the picturesque town is nestled between the Danube, the Carpathians (aka Transylvanian Alps), Moldavia and the Olt River. You will visit King Carol I’s stunning Peleș Castle. This landmark dates back to 1873 and blends Neo-Renaissance and Gothic Revival architecture, with a heavily Baroque-influenced interior loaded with luxurious linens and intricately carved woodwork.\n\nYou will then journey further north into Transylvania to reach to the center of Romania: Brașov. You will arrive in Brașov that evening and are free to independently explore the bustling activity and plentiful dining options within the city’s Council Square. Encircled by beautifully preserved 18th and 19th century homes, Piata Sfatului has served as Brașov’s town market since the mid-14th century and has hosted merchants from all over the world.\n\nBrașov - Râșnov - Bran - Brașov (Total Travel Distance: 80 km)\n\nYour guide will meet you at your hotel to lead a walking tour of Brașov’s many historically significant landmarks. As a significant stop along historic trade routes between Western Europe and the Ottoman Empire, Brașov is widely regarded as the capital for the region’s Transylvanian Saxons, who were highly involved in crafts and trading.\n\nArchaeologists in Brașov have unearthed evidence of advanced civilizations dating back to 9500 BCE, the Neolithic Age; and this region holds some of Romania’s earliest artifacts. After hearing more about the rich history of Council Square--which includes public humiliation of accused witches and the late 17th-century beheading of a guild leader, you’ll see the city’s famous Biserica Neagră. Named after Saint Mary, the celebrated church became known as The Black Church as a result of smoke damage sustained in The Great Fire of 1689. The original structure was built in 94 years (between 1383 and 1477) and was the biggest church between Vienna and Constantinople.\n\nYour tour will take you down Rope Street, the narrowest passageway in Romania--and possibly all of Europe: Strada Sforii’s width varies between just 111 and 135 centimetres and continues 80 metres. You will see both Black Tower and White Tower, two of the city’s Old City Watch Towers, as well as Brașov’s only original city gate that has remained intact since the Middle Ages. Catherine’s Gate, aka Șchei Gate, sits immediately beside Poarta Ecaterinei.\n\nYou will then drive a short distance to Râșnov, a medieval village built on on the road that joins Transylvania and Wallachia. For the past several years, Râșnov has hosted a heavy metal music festival known as Rockstadt Extreme Fest at the base of the looming Castle of Râșnov. This citadel remained unconquered until its only defeat by Hungary’s Gabriel Báthory, Prince of Transylvania from 1608 to 1613.\n\nThe fortress was constructed with a simple architectural style that used stones and bricks for the walls and wooden gates and platforms. The walls reach five-meters high and one-and-a-half meters thick; however, the structure is also protected by steep cliffs abutting all but its eastern perimeter. Within Râșnov Fortress’ courtyard, archaeologists have preserved the ruins of more than 30 homes, a chapel and a school. Several scenes from the American war film Cold Mountain were filmed at this stunning historic monument and the surrounding region in 2002.\n\nYou will also visit nearby Bran Castle just a short drive away. This landmark is a favorite among visitors because of its inaccurate association with Vlad Țepeș, aka Vlad Dracula. In reality, there is no evidence that Bram Stoker, the author of Dracula, was influenced by Bran Castle, and the fortress has no proven associations with Vlad the Impaler. Despite the Bran Castle’s questionable connection with the literary legend, the castle remains a worthwhile and historic destination. In fact, the original fortress on this site dates back to the early 13th century; however, Mongols destroyed the first wooden edifice in 1242. Louis I of Hungary granted local Saxons authority to build the stone castle at their own expense and labour in 1377, and the site is now a museum housing Queen Marie of Romania’s furniture and art collection.\n\nAfter a full day of sightseeing, your guide will bring you back to Brașov to enjoy the evening however you choose.\n\nBrașov - Prejmer - Viscri - Sighișoara (Total Travel Distance: 160 km)\n\nYour guide will once again meet you at your hotel in Brașov, from which you will travel further north to Premjer. This unique community is made up of three villages--Lunca Câlnicului, Prejmer and Stupinii Prejmerului--and is most famous for the UNESCO World Heritage Site Prejmer Fortified Church. One of the oldest--and perhaps strongest Saxon Churches in all of Transylvania, Teutonic Knights began construction in 1218 and Cistercian Monks (a French Catholic order that wielded heavy influence in the area at the time) completed the project in 1225.\n\nAlso like Râșnov’s castle, Prejmer fended off numerous invasions during the Middle Ages, including Hungarians, Ottoman Turks, Mongols, Tatars, Cossacks and Moldovians; yet Hungary’s Gabriel Báthory was the only one to successfully capture Prejmer Fortified Church. Romanian officials have meticulously restored this early-Gothic landmark, which was modeled after churches in Jerusalem. This architectural style is noteworthy and unusual for this region, and historians believe Teutonic Knights brought the Greek cross back from the Holy Land.\n\nFrom Premjer, your adventure will take you further north to one of the most notoriously charming Saxon villages in Transylvania: Viscri. Viscri offers the quintessential Romanian experience--ancient medieval fortifications surrounded by cobble-stoned streets, colorfully painted homes and a breathtaking natural landscape. Perhaps this is why His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales purchased and stayed in a typical villager’s homestead many times during his visits to Transylvania.\n\nConstruction on UNESCO World Heritage Site Viscri Fortified Church began in 1100 AD, and the settlement was given its current name in 1400 in recognition of the Church’s exterior. Alba Ecclesia, Latin for “White Church,” is widely considered one of Transylvania’s most remarkable Saxon fortified churches. The edifice’s museum offers wide ranging artifacts, including embroidery, pottery, furniture and agricultural tools. Viscri’s remarkable architecture is particularly well preserved as a result of the Mihai Eminescu Trust, which has funded the renovation of more than 300 projects within the town.\n\nFrom Viscri, you will travel the short 30-minute drive to Sighișoara, arriving in plenty of time to stroll the medieval stone streets and find the perfect dining venue in this UNESCO World Heritage Site citadel town.\n\nSighișoara - Biertan - Turda - Alba Iulia (Total Travel Distance: 210 km)\n\nThe small Medieval city of Sighişoara sits on top of a hill, peaked by a citadel on the highest summit and fortified by a formidable 930-meter ring of walls, 14 defense towers and five artillery bastions. After being invited by the King of Hungary, Transylvanian Saxons built their fortress on the Tarnava River during the 12th century in order to populate and defend the region. They were so successful here that Sighişoara became one of Transylvania’s culturally rich and profitable cities. Sighişoara’s Historic Center features opulent, well-preserved merchant houses, complete with charming pastel colors, Medieval German architecture and local craftsmen peddling their artistry. The Clock Tower looms as the tallest point in this magnificent city and dates back 700 years. The engineering masterpiece was built with walls more than two meters thick to safely store residents’ ammunition, historical archives and treasury.\n\nDuring your walking tour of Sighişoara, you’ll also climb the 180-step Covered Staircase, Scara Şcolarilor or “Scholars’ Stairs,” to reach the Gothic-style Biserica din Deal, or Church on the Hill, and Saxon Cemetery. Most visitors will want to spend a good deal of time wandering the peaceful paths in this austere, sacred setting--reading well-preserved, artistically stunning headstones.\n\nOf course, no visit to Sighişoara would be complete without seeing the 1431 birthplace of Vlad Tepes, the 15th century Prince of Wallachia that inspired Bram Stoker’s fictional Count Dracula. The historic site has since converted its ground floor into Casa Vlad Dracu, a restaurant that offers the opportunity for a lunch break and visit to the second-floor rooms that once housed the young prince.\n\nFrom Sighişoara, you will drive northwest to another UNESCO World Heritage Site citadel town. Biertan is one of the regions most important Saxon villages protected by fortified churches. In fact, Biertan’s Fortified Church served as Transyvania’s Lutheran Evangelical Bishop’s seat from 1572 to 1867. Transylvanian Saxons founded the town sometime between 1224 and 1283, and it served as an economically significant commerce role until declining in significance with the rise of the nearby cities of Mediaș, Sighișoara and Sibiu. Now recognized as one of the most frequently visited villages in Transylvania, Biertan hosts an annual reunion of the Transylvanian Saxons, many of whom now live in Germany, as well as the Luna Plină (\"Full Moon\") Horror and Fantasy Film Festival.\n\nYour next stop will mark the northern peak of your adventure, where you will visit the legendary and spectacular Turda Salt Mine. Located 115 meters underground, this once industrial site that dates back to the Middle Ages was converted into a subterranean recreation area in 1992. Some of the more unique attractions here include a wellness center, Ferris wheel, echo hall, bowling alley, underground lake with row-boat rentals, mini golf course, museum and indoor elevator.\n\nYou will then travel south to see Eastern Europe’s largest Vouban-style citadel: Alba Iulia Fortress. Your guide can recommend the full range of dining options within Alba Iulia. You may choose to retire early or begin exploring this beautiful town.\n\nAlba Iulia - Hunedoara - Sibiu (Total Travel Distance: 210 km)\n\nYour guide will meet you at your hotel for a walking tour of all the historic, spiritual and architectural sites this unique city has to offer. Named after Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban, the French military engineer that built with this star-shaped style, this structure is well known for its seven-point design, dramatic bastions and beautiful gates. Alba Iulia Fortress dates back to 1711 and was constructed on the ruins of a Medieval fortress--and before that, a Roman camp.\n\nThe city’s 2,000-plus year history includes its pivotal role in Romania’s Great Union of 1918, when Transylvania united with the rest of Romania. It is also home to our country’s oldest cathedral--Catedrala Sfântul Mihail, aka St. Michael's Cathedral. Hungarian King Saint Istvan founded Catedrala Sfântul Mihail around 1009 AD, and it now serves as seat to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Transylvania. Alba Iulia is widely recognized as Romania’s spiritual capital.\n\nTraveling towards Sibiu, your next stop is Hunedoara. Situated near the Poiana Ruscă Mountains, Hunedora is home to the region’s most striking Gothic-Renaissance architecture: Hunyad Castle, aka Corvin Castle. Dating back to the mid-15th century, Hunyad is one of the largest castles in all of Europe and ranked among the Seven Wonders of Romania. The edifice was constructed on a rock above the Zlaști River on the ruins of a previous fortification.\n\nBecause of its dramatic military and civilian history and striking architecture, Hunyad Castle is a popular destination for visitors. John Hunyadi imprisoned Vlad the Impaler, Prince of Wallachia and dramatic inspiration for Bram Stoker’s Dracula, within the castle, and the site has hosted multiple video game, television and movie productions--including Most Haunted Live!, Ghost Adventures and The Nun.\n\nYou will arrive in Sibiu in the early evening, and your guide can recommend several highly rated and culturally rich dining options near your top-of-the-line accommodations in Sibiu.\n\nSibiu - Transfagarasan - Poenari - Bucharest (Total Travel Distance: 280 km)\n\nSettlers built this architecturally rich medieval city, which is defined by cultural legacy that spans more than 900 years. Sibiu (aka Hermannstadt) served as the region’s German settlers’ capital. The Transylvanian Saxons’ trade guilds amassed great wealth here, ultimately growing Sibiu into the largest, most prosperous of the nation’s seven walled citadels.\n\nSibiu’s Old Town remains strikingly German in appearance, and the area is still encircled by portions of the ancient medieval wall that once protected its citizens. Three of the city’s original 39 towers remain standing today. In Sibiu, you will also see other extraordinary landmarks, which include Great Square, a UNESCO World Heritage Site; Brukenthal Palace, a late-Baroque architectural masterpiece housing one of Romania’s most impressive museums; the hopelessly romantic Bridge of Lies, Podul Minciunilor; Haller House, a beautiful preserved Renaissance residence with Sibiu’s trademark window structure; multiple visually striking and historically significant Churches and countless other potential destinations. Sibiu offers much to see and enjoy, and your guide will customize your experience around personal preferences.\n\nIf your trip takes place during July through September, we’ll then travel through Romania’s infamous Transfăgărășan Highway. This aesthetically striking mountain road crossing though the southern section of the Romanian Carpathian, dissecting the nation’s highest peaks--Moldoveanu and Negoiu--and unifying Transylvania and Wallachia. Again, if traveling during the summer months, you will have the opportunity to visit Poenari Citadel.\n\nThis formidable 13th-century Wallachian castle once housed Vlad the Impaler, aka Vlad Țepeș or Vlad Dracula. Dating back to 1453, Țepeș later recognized the fortress’ geographic advantages and used the edifice as a primary residence. Used as a dramatic backdrop for several movies and television shows, many supernatural stories enhance the fortress’ legendary status. The castle sits on Mount Cetatea, perched on a canyon facing the west side of the Transfăgărășan and remains accessible only via its 1,480 concrete steps. Because of its isolated location and somewhat treacherous ascent, visits to Poenari Citadel are only possible during summer months.\n\nIf the Transfăgărășan Highway is not open--or if visitors prefer not to climb the 1,480 steps to reach Poenari Castle--your guide can instead take you through the scenic Olt Valley, which is nestled between the Căpăţânii, Lotru and Făgăraş mountains. Romans forged this ancient trade route, which was later used by merchants of the Middle Ages as they journeyed deep into Transylvania; and you will have an option to visit the beautiful Byzantine Orthodox Church of Saint Nicholas of Curtea de Argeș, aka “The Princely Church.” Completed in 1352, this UNESCO World Heritage Site exemplifies medieval Romanian architecture and boasts interior wall paintings from the mid-14th century.\n\nRegardless of your route, you’ll enjoy a rewarding day of sightseeing, after which your guide will drive you the approximate 2-1/2 hour distance to return to Romania’s capital to prepare for your departure."
