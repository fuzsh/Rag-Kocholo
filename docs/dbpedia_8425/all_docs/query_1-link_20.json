With more than 1200 sales outlets in 40 countries, Leonidas has over time earned a reputation that is the envy of many: that of the Belgiansâ€™ favourite brand of chocolate. On an international level as well, Leonidas is known for its highest quality chocolates and its know-how. Its Master Chocolatiers are constantly creating new recipes and new seasonal products that take their place alongside a vast range of chocolates. Leonidas works exclusively with chocolate made with 100% pure cocoa butter, without palm oil and out of sustainable cocoa. In 2023, Leonidas will be celebrating its 110th anniversary. 110 years of love for its chocolates and its consumers... and millions of blissful moments created since 1913, thanks to Leonidas chocolates."
