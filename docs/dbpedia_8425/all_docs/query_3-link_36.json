        "text": "The wine-growing area in the centre of Romania in the region of Transylvania is also called \"Land of Wines\". It has an ancient history of viticulture, because wine was already produced here in the 1st century. The old wine cellars with elongated catacombs are considered the largest in Transylvania. The vineyards are situated on the Mures River, which flows through the area. The most common grape varieties are Fetească Albă, Grasă de Cotnari, Muscat Ottonel, Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc, Traminer and Welschriesling."
