Neil Young (12 November 1945-) was a Canadian folk rock singer-songwriter. Born in Toronto, Ontario in 1945, he moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s and formed Buffalo Springfield, releasing two solo albums and three band albums before joining Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969. He became known for his guitar work, his personal lyrics, and his tenor singing voice, and he was nicknamed the "Godfather of Grunge" for his distorted electric guitar playing.

Although he was originally affiliated with the leftist counterculture movement, Young became a notable right-wing rock n' roll musician, endorsing Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan in 1980 and Ross Perot in 1992, and supporting the Iraq War following the 9/11 attacks. However, he later swung back to the left after his marriage to Daryl Hannah.
