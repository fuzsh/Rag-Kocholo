        "text": "Nick Drake (born June 19, 1948, Rangoon [now Yangon], Myanmar [Burma]—died November 25, 1974, Tanworth-in-Arden, England) was an English singer, songwriter, and guitarist known for emotive vocals, sombre lyrics, and rich melodies. Drake never achieved widespread recognition in his lifetime but inspired a cult following in the decades following his death.\n\nDrake was raised principally in the English village of Tanworth-in-Arden and played the saxophone and clarinet in school. He took up the guitar at age 16 and began writing songs two years later. In 1968 he was discovered at a London performance by Ashley Hutchings of the folk rock group Fairport Convention and shortly thereafter signed a contract with Island Records. Drake’s debut album, Five Leaves Left (1969), which was shepherded by Fairport Convention’s renowned producer, Joe Boyd, juxtaposed gentle melodies and subtle melancholy lyrics. Featuring members of Fairport Convention and again produced by Boyd, Drake’s next album, Bryter Later (1970), revealed a more lush and buoyant sound.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPop Culture Quiz\n\nAlways averse to performing live, Drake, by 1970, had given it up entirely. He sank into prolonged periods of depression and grew increasingly reclusive, recording his final album, Pink Moon (1972), entirely alone and checking himself into a psychiatric institution for several weeks shortly after its completion. After recording a few more songs, in late 1974 he died at his parents’ home from an overdose of antidepressant medication. The coroner considered him a likely suicide, though some friends and family disagreed with the assessment."
