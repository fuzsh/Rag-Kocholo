        "text": "The Winterland Ballroom opens in San Francisco, California. It's an ice-skating rink that can be converted into a general entertainment venue for opera, boxing, and other events, costing a whopping (for 1928) $1 million to build.

The song \"The Needle And The Damage Done\" is about Whitten, who dies of a drug overdose at 29.\n\nNeil Young is born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He is raised in the small, rural town of Omemee, Ontario, where the Youngtown Museum will be established in his honor.\n\nRecord producer/musician Daniel Lanois is born in Hull, Quebec.

Turner, and the band Bachman-Turner Overdrive is born.\n\nLater memorialized in the Neil Young song \"Ohio,\" the Ohio National Guard fires on protesters at Kent State University, killing four students, two of whom weren't even protesting. This shameful event in American history leads to the formation of Devo, as Mark Mothersbaugh and Jerry Casale are both on campus and horrified by the events.More\n\nNeil Young performs \"The Needle and the Damage Done\" at UCLA's Royce Hall.

A few months later a recording of the performance appears on Time Fades Away."
