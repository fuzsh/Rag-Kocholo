        "text": "Neil Young has made many friends over the years in the studio and along the road. Many of those friendships, such as David Crosby, Steven Stills, & Graham Nash are well documented. Other stories are just waiting to be told.\n\nIn terms of musical collaborations with many of the greats like Bob Dylan, Pearl Jam and Joni Mitchell, see Neil Young's influences page.\n\nNeil's friendship with his guitar technician Larry Cragg goes back many years. It is Larry who nurses Neil's guitar \"Ol Black\" back into shape after string ripping encores.\n\nJack Nitzsche is well known as the producer arranger on the masterpiece \"Broken Arrow\". Crazy Horse roadie, Willie \"Baby John\" Hinds was quoted in Shake! magazine saying: \"Crazy Horse in Jack Nitzsche's mind was an American Rolling Stones.\"\n\nSo here are a couple of articles on Neil's acquaintances (... and former friends, too).\n\nStephen Stills - Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills Nash & Young bandmate\n\nDavid Crosby - Crosby, Stills Nash & Young bandmate\n\nGraham Nash - Crosby, Stills Nash & Young bandmate\n\nFrank Sampedro - Crazy Horse Guitar Player\n\nBilly Talbot - Crazy Horse Bass Player\n\nRalph Molina - Crazy Horse Drummer\n\nDanny Whitten - Crazy Horse Guitar Player [search]\n\nDewey Martin - Buffalo Springfield's drummer\n\nJim Messina - Buffalo Springfield bandmate\n\nBruce Palmer - Buffalo Springfield bandmate\n\nBruce Berry - Roadie for Crazy Horse [search]\n\nWillie Nelson - Farm Aid Co-Founder [search]\n\nLarry Cragg - Neil Young's Guitar Technician\n\nElliot Roberts - Neil Young's Manager with Lookout Management\n\nDavid Briggs - Neil Young's Producer\n\nDennis Hopper - co-star on Human Highway film\n\nDean Stockwell- Actor, author of \"After the Goldrush\" screenplay\n\nJoel Bernstein - Neil's Archivist [search]\n\nCarrie Snodgress - Actress and mother of Zeke Young\n\nJim Jarmusch - Filmmaker, Director of \"Dead Man\" & \"Year of the Horse\"\n\nScott Young - Neil's Father, author of \"Neil and Me\"\n\nJack Nitzsche - Neil's arranger on \"Harvest\"\n\nRusty Kershaw - Stray Gator Slide Guitar, Fiddle [search]\n\nRandy Bachman - Fellow Winnipeg Rocker [search]\n\nNils Lofgren - Crazy Horse and Trans Band mate\n\nGary Burden and Neil Young\n\n- Album Designer\n\nBill Graham - Concert Promoter\n\nJimmy McDonough - Author of biography \"Shakey\"\n\nEddie Vedder - Pearl Jam singer/songwriter and inducter of Neil into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame\n\nRick James - The Mynah Birds and \"Super Freak\"\n\nDavid Geffen - Record Producer Who Sued Neil for being \"Un-Neil-like\" [search]\n\nNicolette Larson - Vocalist on \"Lotta Love\" & \"Comes A Times\"\n\nJmaes/Jim \"Sandy\" Mazzeo - Artist for Neil Young Album Covers\n\nJonathan Demme - Film Director of \"Heart of Gold\", \"Philadelphia\", & \"Complex Sessions\"\n\nLarry \"LA\" Johnson - Neil's film director\n\nTom Wilkes - Harvest Album Cover Designer\n\nTim Pope - Music video director\n\nDavid Crosby on Neil\n\nFrom UK Magazine Record Collector (September 2001), David Crosby had this to say about Neil Young:\n\n\"Playing with Neil is very intense, and very exciting. He leans forward into what's possible, all the time. He's powerful. He's got a lot of juice.'\n\nFor more on David Crosby [search].\n\nGraham Nash on Neil\n\nFrom The fab.net, an interview with Graham Nash on recording American Dream with Neil Young:\n\n\"Well, I have written a few songs, and Stephen has made a few songs, and David has come up with a song, and Neil has done a few hundred songs. He writes all the time.\"\n\nFrom the book Crosby Stills Nash......& sometimes Young by Herman Verbeke, Graham Nash comments on working with Neil:\n\n\"Anger played an important role in CSNY, but it was rather frustration which caused the cancelling of a lot of projects. When we start to see things going the wrong way, then Neil doesn't want to be any part of it. No discussions, he's gone... When we were in Miami, we were staying at the Mutiny Hotel. Neil and I would go to breakfast every morning and he'd call me or I'd call him - whoever woke up first. And one day he called me around breakfast time and said, 'Hey, are you going to breakfast? Well, I'm not, because I'm in Los Angeles.' He'd left. No explanation, no discussion, no reason. When we saw each other later on, we simply didn't mention it.\"\n\nFrom an interview with Graham Nash by Debbie Kruger (November 1999), Graham Nash comments on the chemistry with Neil:\n\nGN: \"In 1969 when CSN had finished the album, we knew that we would be going on the road. Stephen, as a great lead guitarist, needed someone to play off, to inspire him to play better. Neither David nor I were that person. We play good rhythm guitar but lead guitar is something different altogether. We decided that we would ask Neil to come along and join the band. At first I was a little reticent to have this happen. I thought that we had a complete band and a wonderful vocal blend.\n\nI spent one morning at breakfast with Neil on Bleeker Street in New York City and when we were finished I was completely sold on Neil joining. He was incredibly funny and very committed to music. He wanted to be a full member of the band with equal billing etc. This made sense to me and so we became CSNY.\n\nNeils effect on the band was immediate and very fulfilling. He adds a certain edge to the sound and, of course, he is an incredible musician. We became a better band because of the inclusion of Neil Young.\n\nQ: The harmonies on the album definitely have a different texture to past CSN and CSNY recordings. I like one of your comments in the official bio, about the edge that Neils singing brings, about how Neils not into perfect  hes into making you feel. Can you elaborate on that?\n\nGN: Neil always prefers earlier takes of songs. He believes, as we all do, that after 6 or 7 performances of any song that you begin to perform it rather than feel it. We would rather have feeling than perfection.\"\n\nAnd finally, the most legendary Graham story involves visiting Young's ranch where they were on a boat on the lake. They were listening to music being amplified through speakers in the main house (left channel) and a barn (right channel). When asked how it sounded, Neil replied \"More Barn!\". For more, see More Barn! page.\n\nFor more on Graham Nash [search].\n\nAnd speaking of Neil and friends, Mr. Young has written dozens of songs referring to friends and friendships.
