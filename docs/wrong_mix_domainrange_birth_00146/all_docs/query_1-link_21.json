        "text": "Neil Young was born in 1945 in Toronto, Canada. After spending several years on the folk circuit in Canada Young moved to California in 1966 to join Buffalo Springfield. He spent two years with that group and then formed his own band, Crazy Horse. In 1969 they released an album called Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. In the same year, Young joined Crosby Stills and Nash and in 1970 wrote their hit, Ohio, inspired by the National Guard killing of four students on the Kent State University campus during a Vietnam war protest.\n\nLater in 1970, Young's album After the Gold Rush reached #8 on the album charts. His album Harvest, released in 1972 was his greatest success, reaching #1."
