The album as well as Sunday’s performance is special for Kirk because both feature his daughter, clarinettist Virginia Macdonald. “It’s a wonderful experience working with Virginia. She is an inspiration as a musician and she brings her own voice to the music and maintains an organic, spontaneous and interactive approach to playing music,” says Kirk, who has worked with musicians such as John Taylor and Rosemary Clooney.\n\nVirginia started playing the clarinet at the age of seven and realised that she wants to pursue music professionally. “When you grow up surrounded by music, it becomes a significant part of your life, whether you choose to play it yourself or not. For me, my connection to music has always been tied in with being able to play it myself,” she says. The young musician says that Jimmy Giuffre is one of her favourite clarinettists and has influenced her music.\n\nThe Kirk MacDonald Generations Quartet (which also includes bassist Neil Swainson and drummer Morgan Childs) will perform contemporary original music, mixed with jazz standards and music from the Great American Songbook. They will play tunes such as “On Green Dolphin Street”, “I’ve Never Been in Love Before” and “Body and Soul”.\n\nThe Kirk MacDonald Generations Quartet will perform at Experimental Theatre, NCPA, Nariman Point on Mar 8, 7 pm.
