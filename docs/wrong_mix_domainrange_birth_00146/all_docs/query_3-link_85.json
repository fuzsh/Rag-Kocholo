        "text": "Young took his catalogue off Spotify in 2022 over concerns that it was spreading COVID misinformation through Joe Rogan's podcast, which was the platform's most popular podcast in 2021.\n\n\"They can have Rogan or Young. Not both,\" Young wrote at the time.\n\nBut now, Young says other music streaming services like Apple and Amazon \"have started serving the same disinformation podcast features I had opposed at Spotify.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\n\"I cannot just leave Apple and Amazon, like I did Spotify, because my music would have very little streaming outlet to music lovers at all,\" Young continued in his post. \"So I have returned to Spotify, in sincere hopes that Spotify sound quality will improve and people will be able to hear and feel all the music as we made it.\"\n\nYoung added that he hopes Spotify will introduce high-res music to its platform, suggesting they start with a high-res tier and \"build from there.\"\n\nIf you're itching to go on a binge of Neil Young's nearly 60 years of solo discography, you might not be able to do it on Spotify just yet. At the time of publication, his works haven't returned to the platform.\n\nSpotify did not immediately respond to Business Insider's question about when exactly Young's work would return.\n\n\"I hope all you millions of Spotify users enjoy my songs!\" Young wrote. \"They will now all be there for you except for the full sound we created.\""
