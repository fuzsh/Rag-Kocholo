        "text": "Formative Years\n\nBorn on October 2, 1927 to Krishnabai and Dattatreya, Kaikiniji evinced very early signs of musical talent. His father had taken him to see the film “Sant Tukaram,” which was known for its extremely popular and appealing soundtrack of abhang-s. A few days later, when Kaikiniji heard his neighbor, a harmonium player, playing the same melodies on his instrument, he immediately joined in and sang all of the songs from the film perfectly. He had only seen the film once. He became a local phenomenon, and his neighbor encouraged his father to teach him music seriously.\n\nAt just the age of seven, he experienced a pivotal turning point in his life. He heard about a very special concert that was happening at Blavatski Lodge, and stealthily made his way to the concert, where he snuck in and sat right in the front. He did not know that the music he was about to hear would form a seminal moment of his musical journey – the concert featured three Hindustānī legends: Ustad Alladiya Khan, Ustad Faiyaz Khan, and Ustad Abdul Karim Khan. At the conclusion of this grand musical feast, he had made up his mind that he must become a musician, and he must sing like none other than Ustad Faiyaz Khan.\n\nKaikiniji left his home at the age of 11 to pursue his music studies in Lucknow, a period that would be filled with tests of his determination and will power. After discovering the undesirable conditions of the general hostel, he went on a hunger strike until he was finally allowed to live with his Guruji. But once his basic living conditions were improved, he was immersed in taalim and Ratanjankarji’s immense knowledge. Despite being away from his family from such a young age, he developed a deep brotherhood with his guru bhai-s, Pandit S.C.R. Bhat and Pandit K.G. Ginde. The relationship of these three musical giants would last for their lifetimes.\n\nCareer as Performer, Guru & Composer\n\nCopyright and Source (Images): From the Kaikini Family Collection\n\nAbout the curator:\n\nPriya Purushothaman: Priya is a Hindustani vocalist, educator and writer.
