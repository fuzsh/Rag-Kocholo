        "text": "When you think of the term \"rap music,\" who do you think of? Jay-Z? Travis Scott? When you think of \"country,\" does Miranda Lambert or Garth Brooks come to mind?\n\nYet when it comes to something as broad as locations, how can you not think of Bruce Springsteen when you hear \"New Jersey?\" When you listen to Childish Gambino, his frequent shoutouts to Stone Mountain, Georgia, make you consider a place you hadn't thought about before. And when you think of pop-rapper Flo Rida, you think of Carol City, Florida, where Flo Rida was born.\n\nWe're joking on that last one, but sometimes artists don't need to be born in their hometown to represent it. The great Queen of Disco, Donna Summer, was born in Boston but isn't necessarily the first person who comes to mind when you think of Boston's rich music history. So with that in mind, let's talk about the signature musical acts from every major city, whether they be artists who represents where they came from or just happen to be hometown success stories writ large.\n\n1 of 54\n\nNew York City: Billy Joel\n\nMichael Putland/Getty Images\n\nAlways the cutting edge of everything from rock (with the Ramones) to rap (with The Notorious B.I.G.) to disco (Chic) to dance (LCD Soundsystem), only a select group of artists truly rep the City That Never Sleeps as hard as Billy Joel does. From his never-ending set of sellout shows at Madison Square Garden and Shea Stadium to his lyrics that depict rich city nightlife like in \"Scenes from an Italian Restaurant\" and \"Piano Man\" (to say nothing of his \"Oliver & Company\" soundtrack contribution \"Why Should I Worry,\" which Joel didn't even write but nonetheless cross-checks numerous NYC locales with panache), the Bronx-born piano player has New York City in his bones and is unafraid to express what The Big Apple means to him in his shows, his songs and just about everything else.\n\nRunner-up: Jay-Z. \"I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can,\" Jay-Z once boasted. We might disagree but point taken.\n\n3 of 54\n\nChicago: Buddy Guy\n\nHerb Snitzer/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nAlthough born in Louisiana, Buddy Guy has become a champion and arguably even the face of modern Chicago blues, mixing traditional structures with modern rock elements, all blending together with the help of his undeniable talent as one of the world's greatest guitarists. As the in-house guitarist for Chicago-based Chess Records, Guy played on a litany of classic albums before Chess finally gave him his own solo LP in 1967. Yet it was 1991's \"Damn Right, I've Got the Blues\" that proved to be his commercial breakthrough. Over two decades later, he'd be on stage with Mick Jagger in the Obama White House, actually getting the president to trade lines with him on \"Sweet Home Chicago.\" If that doesn't make you a Chicago legend, we don't know what else will.\n\nRunner-up: Chance the Rapper. Kanye may have once been Chicago's hometown pride, but since his turn to Trumpism, it's now Chance's love of Chicago and notable philanthropic efforts that have made him a true Windy City champion.\n\n7 of 54\n\nBoston: Aerosmith\n\nAnthony Behar/Sipa USA\n\nThe Boston Music Awards have been around since 1988, celebrating Beantown bands that break big and those that remain local, with winners ranging from 'Til Tuesday to Big D & the Kids Table. Yet the category of \"Outstanding Rock Band,\" for an astonishing stretch of time, almost always defaulted to Aerosmith. Having sold nearly 150 million albums worldwide, Aerosmith has done its city proud and has frequently come back to play Fenway or, if in a fun mood, to play with The Boston Pops. Often referred to as \"The Bad Boys from Boston,\" they have achieved a rare level of stardom that allows them to play the Super Bowl or have their own Rock 'n' Roller Coaster, and when opportunities like that come their way, they \"don't want to miss a thing.\"\n\nRunner-up: Dropkick Murphys. The Celtic-punk Quincy boys are more than just the song \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\" — but we'll be damned if we can't find a more fiery anthem for the city.\n\n9 of 54\n\nDenver: John Denver\n\nMichael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nNot many people know that \"John Denver\" is a stage name. The \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\" singer was born Henry John Deutschendorf Jr. in New Mexico and had to come up with a moniker when he realized his surname was cumbersome for an entertainer (to say nothing of the marquees). With his love of Colorado deep in his veins, \"John Denver\" was chosen, and even though he spent most of his time up in Aspen, Denver did his namesake proud, with songs like \"Rocky Mountain High\" capturing the beauty and grand expanse of Colorado in all its glory. Even with all the platinum albums and Muppets collaborations to his name, The Mile-High City knows what it has in Denver, anointing him into the Colorado Music Hall of Fame for good reason.\n\nRunner-Up: The Lumineers. They might lean into the \"Millennial Whoa\" a bit too much, but The Lumineers have proved that there's a giant place for mainstream folk-rock in a post-Mumford & Sons world, and it all came home-cooked right in Cow Town.\n\n13 of 54\n\nAthens, Georgia: R.E.M.\n\nBrian Zak/Sipa Press/rem_bz\n\nAlthough Athens, Georgia's, population is relatively small compared to some of the other cities on this list (roughly 125,00, present-day), the musical scene is one of the largest and most diverse in the country. Helping launch everyone from of Montreal to the Drive-By Truckers to Vic Chesnutt to Widespread Panic to Leo Kottke, it's of no surprise that the Athens' hometown glory remains one of the biggest rock bands of the '90s: R.E.M. The band's spry, evolving sound (along with Michael Stipe's collegiate lyrics and plaintive singing style) endeared it to critics first before launching it into outright mainstream success. A few obvious pop songs aside, the band was always wiry and weird; astute melodic craftsmen whose distinct identity and enigmatic presentation ultimately helped define the Athens scene, letting people know that rock music adhered to the rules only when it wanted to, and the rest is up for grabs.\n\nRunner-up: The B-52's. Some associate the band with quirky \"party pop,\" but the B-52's' back catalog is so much weirder and so much smarter than anyone gave them credit for. Their eponymous debut is virtually flawless and could only be born out of a scene as accepting as Athens.\n\n17 of 54\n\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma: The Flaming Lips\n\nScott Utterback/Courier Journal\n\nWhile a good amount famous artists have stemmed from Oklahoma City (ranging from J.J. Cale to Color Me Badd), few have truly brought their hometown weirdness to the masses quite like The Flaming Lips. From their infamous parking lot experiments (where several cars with several tapes — each with one part of a multipart song — were started at the same time) to Wayne's use of his backyard to film movies, The Big Friendly has always been a part of the band's blood (and sometimes even their lyrics), which is why their big hit \"Do You Realize??\" was once even in contention to be one of the official rock songs of Oklahoma. It didn't get voted in, but the band did eventually get a street named after it that turned out to be a small alley — which couldn't be more fitting for the weird and wild band of trip-rock dreamers.\n\nRunner-up: Sandi Patty. Oklahoma City's gospel great has been dropping albums since the late '70s, and her extraordinary range has made her known as \"The Voice.\"\n\n30 of 54\n\nSeattle: Pearl Jam\n\nNuccio DiNuzzo/Chicago Tribune/TNS/Sipa USA\n\nDig into history all you want, but when most people hear \"Seattle,\" they think of the grunge movement. While Nirvana was certainly one of the defining acts of the era and made the move from Aberdeen to Seattle proper, it was Pearl Jam who was born there and Pearl Jam who still exists today. Their 1991 debut album, \"Ten,\" remains one of the best-selling albums of the modern era, and while they were certainly roped in with the rest of the grunge artists of the era, their sound has changed and evolved so much in the decades that followed, continuing to nod their Emerald City roots whenever possible. They've had pop hits, weird ukulele experiments and oft-covered hard rockers in equal measure, capturing all that's weird and wild about the Seattle rock scene to boot.\n\nRunner-up: Jimi Hendrix. He was born in Seattle and only went on to become one of the most revered musicians in all of rock history. No big deal.\n\n38 of 54\n\nMoscow, Russia: Pussy Riot\n\nDaniel DeSlover/Sipa USA\n\nDespite having formed as recently as 2011, Russia — no doubt upset that this Moscow-formed band is now its most recognizable musical export — has had a difficult relationship with Pussy Riot, especially given that its anti-government message has resonated strongly in the West. When two Pussy Riot members were arrested and sentenced for \"hooliganism\" following a politically pointed artistic protest, multiple countries weighed in and demanded their release. Even since those events, Pussy Riot's reputation has preceded it, and the band continues to make music that is at times aggressive and nihilistic and at other times surprisingly nuanced. \"Make America Great Again\" — a striking pop song that predicted the outcome of the 2016 election two weeks before it happened — has millions of plays, and Pussy Riot continues to put out politically motivated songs to this day, its artistic vision never compromised. Honestly? It sounds like it's just getting warmed up.\n\nRunner-up: t.A.t.u. It may have been a Europop flash-in-the-pan, but the Moscow-originating t.A.T.u. remains one of the world's best-selling girl groups (even outselling The Spice Girls in Sweden).\n\n44 of 54\n\nBangkok, Thailand: \"Bird\" Thongchai McIntyre\n\nJ. Quinton/WireImage\n\nLike K-pop and J-pop, T-pop is a distinct musical entity in its own right, although much of the music is tailored specifically to a Thai audience. While the music may not cross language barriers in the same way K-pop does, there is still a rich musical history to be found in Thailand, and in the big book of Thai pop music, Bird Thongchai is its superstar. Big in the '90s and the early 2000s, Thongchai has moved from music to TV dramas with surprising ease, but his albums and songs remain his calling card, and while he can do dance-pop with the best of them, his earnest ballads remain his signature style. Even with new, younger acts like Yinglee and New & Jiew rising in popularity, for many in Thailand, the Bangkok-born \"Bird\" will always be the word.\n\nRunner-up: Silly Fools. Thailand has a thriving rock scene, but for the decade that they were releasing music, Silly Fools had the passion, soul, and many (many) guitar solos to push them to the top of the Bangkok pack.\n\n45 of 54\n\nHong Kong, China: Sam Hui\n\nChina Photos/Getty Images\n\nWhile China by and large plays by its own rules, the Cantopop scene has been one that has taken on many different forms over the years, and so much of it can be traced back to Sam Hui and his band, Lotus. Covering various English hits while actually singing in English, Sam Hui went on to embark on a solo career that involved him serving as the writer and producer for many. His own songs and albums were often lighthearted and working-class appealing, even if occasionally partisan (as on his controversial \"Could Not Care Less About 1997,\" wherein he tells listeners not to worry about the handoff of Hong Kong to China). Hui nonetheless was referred to as \"the God of Song\" and had a genuine border-crossing appeal. Although he bowed out before the \"Four Heavenly Kings\" era of Cantopop took over, he still appeared in films and songs from time to time and remains a Hong Kong legend.\n\nRunner-up: Beyond. Adopting a wide variety of song styles during its tenure, Hong Kong's Beyond was unafraid to evolve during its two decades of existence.\n\n50 of 54\n\nMadrid, Spain: Julio Iglesias\n\nMohammad Abu Ghosh/Xinhua\n\nWhen picking the signature artist from Madrid, it certainly doesn't hurt that Julio Iglesias is only one of the best-selling artists of all time. In Spain alone, he has moved some 23 million records, making him the country's most popular recording artist, and it's easy to see why. Mixing soft pop, traditional balladeering and even the occasional upbeat dance number, Iglesias' style touched Spaniards of all walks of life, and his legacy has only amplified with the success of his famous son Enrique. As if that wasn't enough, Julio even played as a goalkeeper for Real Madrid Castilla in the Segunda División, endearing him to Madrid and making him one of the biggest stars to ever come out of Spain.\n\nRunner-up: Alejandro Sanz. Only one artist has ever won the Latin Grammy for Album of the Year three times, and that just so happens to be Madrid's Alejandro Sanz, one of the biggest Latin pop crossover artists in history.\n\n53 of 54\n\nVienna, Austria: Gustav Mahler\n\nImagno/Getty Images\n\nPerhaps it's a bit unfair to put a classical composer such as Mahler as the signature artist on a list that's so full of various pop and rock acts, but given that his influence stretches from the late 1800s to the early 1900s, his legacy continues to grow even a century after his passing. Vienna runs through his blood, having taught, lived and conducted there at various points in his life, sometimes even in the face of anti-Semitic scorn. Although a fervent composer, many of his symphonies were liked by the public but rejected by critics and tastemakers at the time, his weird and emotional compositions viewed as a quirky side-project to his day job as a conductor. Only in the middle of the 1900s had champions like Aaron Copland and Leonard Bernstein come to revive his reputation critically, now leading him to be recognized as one of the greatest romantic composers to have ever lived.\n\nRunner-up: Fennesz. Vienna's premier ambient artist has worked in glitch, IDM and other formats to produce an electronic body of work that continues to innovate to this day.\n\n54 of 54\n\nMumbai, India: Mohammed Rafi\n\nNARINDER NANU/AFP/GettyImages\n\nWas there going to be any other choice? Mohammed Rafi didn't invent the art of playback singing, but he very much became the master of the genre, with his voice and his range allowing him to cover for a wide variety of on-screen performers, which is why he is considered the greatest singer in the history of Hindi Cinema. Although he was no stranger to controversy (like his royalty dispute with the great Lata Mangeshkar in the 1960s), Rafi made himself invaluable because he was capable of singing in a multitude of Indian regional languages, one time even recording an album entirely in English. Although he passed away in 1980, his influence remains unparalleled, often cited as one of Bombay's true treasures.\n\nRunner-up: Arijit Singh. As of this writing, Singh is in his early 30s but is already considered one of the best playback singers in the world, moving to and living in Mumbai while he sings, produces and remains one of India's most sought-after musical freelancers."
