        "text": "Nita Ambani\n\nNita Ambani is one of the most influential and motivational women in the nation. She also runs the largest philanthropic organisation in India, the Nita Ambani Reliance Foundation. Nita Ambani has always been resolved to exploit her position of riches and power for the benefit of all people, donning the hats of an ardent supporter of education, a persistent philanthropist, and a smart businesswoman. Her modest upbringing in a middle-class family, which instilled a radical sense of empathy for those less fortunate and a value system that is built on paying back to civilisation, is what makes her such a renowned persona.\n\nPersonal and Family Details\n\nName- Nita Ambani\n\nDate of Birth- 1 November 1963 (59 years as of 2022)\n\nBirth Place- Mumbai\n\nParents- Ravindrabhai Dalal and Purnima Dalal\n\nSister - Mamta Dalal\n\nSpouse- Mukesh Ambani\n\nChildren- Akash Ambani, Anant Ambani, Isha Ambani\n\nZodiac- Scorpio\n\nHobbies- Dancing, Swimming, Travelling, Reading, Watching Movies\n\nNet Worth- $40.1 Billion (as of 2018)\n\nCar Collection- Flying Spur, Bentley, Rolls Royce Phantom, Maybach 62, Mercedes Benz S Class, BMW 760li\n\nJet Collection- Falcon 900EX, Boeing Business Jet 2, Airbus 319 Corporate Jet\n\nHouse- Antilia (27 story house worth $ 1 Billion approx)\n\nEarly Life\n\nNita Ambani was born to a middle-class Gujarati family on the outskirts of Mumbai. She was the daughter of Purnima Dalal and top Birla executive Ravindra Bhai Dalal. She had a strong passion for classical dance styles as a child and hoped to pursue it as a career. Nita Ambani received her Bachelor's degree in Commerce from Narsee Monjee College of Commerce and Economics. She then followed a profession in teaching while giving several stage performances as a trained Bharatnatyam dancer.\n\nDuring one of these dance performances, it is claimed that Nita met the Ambani family when Dhirubhai Ambani noticed how lively Nita was and approached her with a marriage proposal for his son, Mukesh Ambani. Although their relationship quickly developed into one of love and friendship rather than an arranged marriage, Nita Ambani only consented to marry him if she could keep up her teaching career. Because of her humble beginnings, Nita Ambani maintained her groundedness despite getting married off to a billionaire. She avoided the spotlight for a very long period since she was focused on raising her three children, Akash, Isha, and Anant.\n\nEven though Nita Ambani had to cease teaching eventually, she found it difficult to contain her enthusiasm for very long. While Mukesh Ambani was engaged in installing pipelines in Patalganga, she urged that they construct schools in the nearby rural communities. This ultimately resulted in adding more schools in the area of Jamnagar. She became aware of the importance of education and teaching as she worked on these projects. She wanted to ensure that everyone in India had access to affordable education. She is the chairperson of the Dhirubhai Ambani Foundation School, which was founded in 2003.\n\nThe charitable division of Reliance Industries Ltd is called Reliance Foundation. She oversaw the foundation's initiatives in the fields of education, healthcare, art, and culture, as well as rural and urban change. Under her leadership, the Reliance Foundation has launched a number of projects, including the publication of a Hindi newspaper in Braille and cornea transplants, to name a few.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter being elected to the Board of East India Hotels, the company that runs the Oberoi chain of hotels, Nita Ambani made her professional debut in the world of business. She later became the first female board member of Reliance Industries Ltd because of this position, which served as a launching pad for bigger things; she initiated a lot of business ventures. The co-ownership of the IPL cricket team, Mumbai Indians, was one of her largest commercial ventures. She acknowledged in one of her interviews that she had a long-standing love of cricket and had tried to learn as much as she could about the sport. The Mumbai Indians became the dominant team in the Indian Premier League thanks to her commitment to her club. In 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019 the Mumbai Indians won the championship. She also established Football Sports Development Limited with the intention of popularizing sports in the nation. She is well known for having had a significant impact on amateur sports.\n\nCharitable Work\n\nNita Ambani eventually had to stop teaching, but she couldn't hold back her enthusiasm for very long. She requested that they build schools in the adjacent rural communities while Mukesh Ambani was involved in building pipes in Patalganga. This ultimately resulted in adding more schools. While working on these projects, she realised how much education and teaching meant to her. She wanted to ensure that everyone in India had access to affordable education.\n\nReliance Foundation is the name of the charitable arm of Nita Ambani's self-funded business, Reliance Industries Ltd. She handled the foundation's programmes for transformation in rural and urban areas, as well as in the areas of healthcare, art, and culture. Under her leadership, the Reliance Foundation has launched a number of projects, including the publication of a Hindi newspaper in Braille and cornea transplants, to name a few.\n\nPrizes and Honours\n\nWith her tireless efforts to highlight sports and equitable education in India, Nita Ambani has managed to add a good number of accolades to her cap. Being presented with the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Award 2017 by the Indian President is one of them. Additionally, she was given the Times of India's Best Corporate Supporter of Sports Award. Nita Ambani was also included in the Forbes list of the Most Successful Female Business Leaders. She was also listed among the 50 Great and Mighty on India Today. The nomination of Nita Ambani to the International Olympic Committee was a piece of wonderful news as well. Nita Ambani is at the forefront of all the strong and powerful women who have always placed a strong emphasis on giving back to society. She has seen the world firsthand-from being a schoolteacher to being the richest woman in India-and strives to make it a better place. She quickly became a source of inspiration for women all over India.\n\nProject Initiatives by Nita Ambani\n\nProject for Jamnagar Township\n\nMrs Ambani worked on the construction of a company village for the workers of Reliance's refinery in Jamnagar in 1997. The task involved creating a colony with trees and a focus on sustainability for more than 17,000 people. An approximately 100,000-tree mango orchard that is now part of the Jamnagar complex serves as a haven for numerous bird species.\n\nReliance Foundation\n\nNita Ambani started the charity organisation Reliance Foundation in India in 2010. The group has Reliance Industries as a supporter.\n\nMumbai Indians\n\nThe Mumbai Indians, an Indian Premier League (IPL) team that has won the title in 2013, 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2020, are a franchise that Ambani co-owns. She handled the Mumbai Indians' initiative to give back to society, \"Education and Sports for All\" (ESA). Over 100,000 underprivileged children have been reached by ESA's many media and digital channels, which have increased public awareness of the value of education.\n\nDhirubhai Ambani International School\n\nThe Dhirubhai Ambani International School, founded by Ambani, is one of the top schools in resources & services in India.\n\nIOC membership\n\nMrs Ambani was one of eight individuals who were selected for the membership. The Swiss-based panel recommended membership in the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on June 4, 2016. These new members were chosen during the first week of August 2016 in 129th IOC Session. Ambani became the first Indian woman to be elected to the IOC on August 4, 2016.\n\nJio World Centre\n\nOn March 4, 2022, Reliance Industries announced the debut of the Jio World Centre's first phase at Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex.\n\nSome Interesting Facts About Nita Ambani\n\nNita Ambani began learning Bharatanatyam at a young age and became a skilled dancer of this south Indian form of classical dance.\n\nShe apparently transitioned significantly from 90 kg to 50 kg and is a fitness freak. She dedicates forty minutes a day to physical activities, such as yoga, swimming, or working out.\n\nMrs Ambani is a fashion enthusiast. She adores designer handbags, watches, and shoes. We can bet that you didn't know that she owns the second-most expensive purse ever. It's a Birkin by Hermes. It was a customised handbag, the Himalayan Crocodile. The bag has unique features and is adorned with white gold and diamonds.\n\nNita Ambani got featured in Forbes' 2016 list of the Most Powerful Asian Businesswoman.\n\nIn 2016, Mrs Ambani became the first Indian woman to be selected for membership in the IOC.\n\nFor her efforts to promote young talent in sports, she was given conferred in 2017 with Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Purskar by the President of India."
