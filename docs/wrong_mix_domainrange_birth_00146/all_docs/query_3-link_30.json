        "text": "Neil Young is a Canadian singer-songwriter who has been a major figure in the music industry for over five decades. Born in 1945 in Toronto, Young has become one of his generation’s most influential and respected musicians.\n\nWith a career spanning over 50 years, Young has released many classic albums that have cemented his status as one of the most important voices in rock and folk music. The Canadian first gained attention as a member of Buffalo Springfield, who formed in 1966.\n\nAfter leaving Buffalo Springfield, Young embarked on a solo career that has seen him release over 40 studio albums, many of which have become iconic. His most celebrated albums include the seminal ‘Harvest’, ‘After the Gold Rush’ and ‘Rust Never Sleeps’.\n\nShortly after embarking on his solo career, Young joined David Crosby, Stephen Stills, and Graham Nash to form the supergroup Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. His time in the band was critical to his commercial success, and after they split in 1970, Young remained focused on being a solo artist.\n\nIn addition to his music, Young has also been a vocal and outspoken activist on a range of political and social issues. He is also a passionate supporter of a number of progressive causes, including anti-war movements and campaigns for social justice.\n\nThroughout his acclaimed career, Young has been recognised with numerous awards and honours, including inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. He has also been honoured with a Grammy Award, an Academy Award nomination, and an Order of Canada."
