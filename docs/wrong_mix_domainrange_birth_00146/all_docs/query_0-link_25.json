From being a quiet part of one of the city’s first planned neighborhoods to now standing as one of its most vibrant suburbs, Dadar has witnessed it all. Presently, this locality is poised to turn another page in its story, ready for a facelift. Before its spaces, eateries, and culture undergo a lasting change, what better way to explore this neighborhood than through its food, history, and music? \n\nJoin us for a breakfast walk through Dadar as we view it through the lenses of food, music and history.\n\nAbout Neil Khopkar: Neil is a musician and the founder of Sarkhel Resturant in Alibaug. He completed his Bachelor’s degree in Culinary Arts and Business from Le Cordon Bleu in New Zealand. He seemlessly blends his love for food with his entrepreneurial skills. He is also a senior disciple of Vidushi Neela Bhagwat, an exponent of Gwalior Gharana. Neil has adapted the Appalachian dulcimer to the Indian style and is the only person in the country to play it in this style.\n\nWith a true passion for food, music, and the vibrant city of Mumbai, Neil will take us on a sensory journey like no other.\n\n#KarwaanHeritageWalk #KarwaanHeritage #dadar #dadarmumbaikar #shivajipark #mumbai #mumbaifoodie #mumbaifood #mumbaistreetfood #mumbaidiaries #mumbaifoodies #mumbaieats #mumbaifoodlovers #mumbaiwalk #mumbaiheritage #mumbaihistory\".",
