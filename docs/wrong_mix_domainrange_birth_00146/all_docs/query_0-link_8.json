        "text": "Canadian singer-songwriter and musician (born 1959)\n\nThis article is about the Canadian singer and songwriter. For other uses, see Bryan Adams (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Ryan Adams.\n\nMusical artist\n\nBryan Guy Adams (born November 5, 1959) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, musician, record producer, and photographer. He is estimated to have sold between 75 million[2] and more than 100 million records and singles worldwide,[3][4] placing him on the list of best-selling music artists. Adams was the most played artist on Canadian radio in the 2010s[5] and has had 25 top-15 singles in Canada and a dozen or more in the US, UK, and Australia.\n\nAt age 20 his eponymous debut album was released. He rose to fame in North America with the 1983 top ten album Cuts Like a Knife, featuring its title track and the ballad \"Straight From the Heart\", his first US top ten hit, which he wrote at age 18. His 1984 Canadian and US number one album, Reckless became the first album by a Canadian to be certified diamond in Canada and made him a global star with six charting singles including \"Run to You\" and \"Summer of '69\", both top ten hits in the US and Canada, and the power ballad \"Heaven\", a US number one hit.[6] His 1987 album Into the Fire, with its US and Canadian top ten song, \"Heat of the Night\", rose to number two in Canada and the top ten in the US and several other countries.\n\nIn 1991, Adams released \"(Everything I Do) I Do It for You\", which went to number one in at least 19 countries, including for 16 straight weeks in the UK.[7] It is one of the best-selling singles of all time, having sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. The song was included on Adams' Waking Up the Neighbours (1991), a worldwide number one album that sold 16 million copies, including being certified diamond in Canada.[8] Another major hit off the album was the Canadian number one and US number two hit \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\", which also went top ten in several other countries. Beginning in 1993, Adams' hits were mostly ballads, including the worldwide number one or two hits \"Please Forgive Me\" (1993); \"All for Love\" (1993); and \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\" (1995), the latter two topping the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[9] Adams' 1993 greatest hits compilation album, So Far So Good, topped the charts in numerous countries selling 13 million copies worldwide, including being certified 6× platinum in Canada, 5× platinum in the US, and 14× platinum in Australia.\n\nIn 1996, Adams' 18 til I Die was a top five album in many countries, but only reached number 31 in the US. He did duets with Barbra Streisand (\"I Finally Found Someone\" (1996), his last US top ten hit) and Melanie C (\"When You're Gone\" (1998), an international top five hit). In the 1990s, Adams had six European Radio Airplay number one songs for 32 weeks, the fourth and third most, respectively; and three number one songs on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles for 29 weeks total, the most weeks of any artist. Since 1999, Adams released eight albums, three reaching number one in Canada, and the last three reaching the top three in the UK, Germany and elsewhere in Europe.\n\nAdams is ranked 48th on the list of all-time top artists on the Billboard Hot 100.[10] Adams has won 20 Juno Awards and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media amongst 16 Grammy nominations, and has been nominated for five Golden Globe Awards and three Academy Awards for his songwriting for films.[11] Adams has been inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Canada's Walk of Fame, the Canadian Broadcast Hall of Fame,[12][13] the Canadian Music Hall of Fame[14] and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame.[4] On May 1, 2010, Adams received the Governor General's Awards in Performing Arts – Lifetime Artistic Achievement for his 30 years of contributions to the arts.[15]\n\nBryan Guy Adams was born on November 5, 1959, in Kingston, Ontario,[16] the son of Elizabeth Jane (née Watson) and Conrad J. Adams, an English couple who emigrated to Canada from Plymouth, South West England in the 1950s.[17] One of his grandmothers and his great-grandmother was from Floriana, Malta.[18] His father, an officer from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the British Army, joined the Canadian Army and later worked as a United Nations peacekeeping observer and Canadian foreign service diplomat.[17]\n\nAdams travelled with his parents to diplomatic postings in Lisbon, where he attended St. Columban's school in Lisbon Portugal,[19] and Vienna, where he attended the American International School Vienna, in the 1960s, and a Scottish Missionary school, The Tabeetha School in Jaffa, Israel in the early 1970s.[20] Raised in Ottawa, he attended Colonel By Secondary School in the Beacon Hill neighbourhood of Ottawa.[21] In 1974, Adams, his mother, and younger brother Bruce moved to North Vancouver while his father was posted abroad. While there, he attended Argyle Secondary School and Sutherland Secondary School.[22][23]\n\nAdams bought his first electric guitar at the age of 10 in Reading, an Italian brand from Gherson, based on a Fender Stratocaster.[24] In an interview with music magazine Guitar World, Adams said:\n\n\"I bought an imitation Les Paul at a Five and Dime store in Ottawa, Canada, in 1971,\" Adams recalled. \"Before that, I had an imitation Strat which I bought in Reading, England in 1970. It felt real at the time to have a Les Paul, even though I'm a massive Ritchie Blackmore fan – still am. I was heavily into Humble Pie's Rockin' the Fillmore album at the time, and both Peter Frampton and Steve Marriott were on Les Pauls. It's rock guitar heaven, that album.\"[25]\n\nHe left school to play in a group called \"Shock\" and used the funds his parents had saved for his college education to buy an Estey grand piano to tinker with.[26] At one point he sold pet food and worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant, which paid the rent.[27] He grew an interest in bands such as CCR and Deep Purple, and attended concerts by Led Zeppelin, T. Rex, Elton John, and Tina Turner. He started working in the Vancouver music scene with bands and as a studio session singer. At the age of 15, he became the vocalist for glam rock band Sweeney Todd, replacing their original vocalist Nick Gilder.[28]\n\nWith Adams the band re-recorded \"Roxy Roller\", the Canadian hit single from their first album, which came in at No. 99 on the US charts.[29] The band then recorded their second album If Wishes Were Horses (1977) with Adams billed as \"Bryan Guy Adams\" on vocals.[30] Adams left the band at age 16.[28] In 1978, at age 18, Adams met Jim Vallance through a mutual friend in a Vancouver Long and McQuade musical instrument store.[31][32] Vallance was the former drummer and principal songwriter for Vancouver-based rock band Prism, and had recently quit that band to focus on a career as a studio musician and songwriter. They agreed to meet at Vallance's home studio a few days later. This became the beginning of a partnership which was prolific and continuous through the 1980s, together they co-wrote for Adams and a long list of recordings for other artists, including Kiss, Tina Turner, Joe Cocker, Johnny Hallyday, Bonnie Raitt, Rod Stewart, Bonnie Tyler, Loverboy, Carly Simon and Neil Diamond,[33][34] and while discontinuous, as of 2017 , is still in existence.[35][36]\n\nLater in 1978, Adams signed to A&M records for one dollar.[37] A&M remixed one of Adams' demos as a disco song \"Let Me Take You Dancing\", featuring Adams' vocals sped up to meet the 122 BPM dance tempo. The song made the Canadian RPM chart in March 1979 along with its B-side \"Don't Turn Me Away\".[38] In 1979, he made an agreement with Canadian manager Bruce Allen, who at that time also worked for Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Loverboy.[39]\n\nAdams's self-titled debut album, mostly co-written with Jim Vallance, was released in February 1980. With the exception of \"Remember\" and \"Wastin' Time\", most of the album was recorded in October and November 1979 at Manta Studios and co-produced by Adams and Vallance.[31] The album was certified gold in Canada in 1986.[40] Singles released from it included \"Give Me Your Love\", \"Remember\" and \"Hidin' from Love\", with the latter having the most success, reaching number 64 on the Canadian RPM Current Hit Radio chart; none reached the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAdams's second album, You Want It You Got It, was released in 1981 and contained the FM album-oriented rock radio hit, \"Lonely Nights\", which reached number three on the US Album Rock Tracks chart.[41] The same song was reinterpreted by Uriah Heep for the album Head First, released in 1983.[42][43] The most successful song off the album in Canada was \"Fits Ya Good\" which reached the top 30 on the RPM Top 40 Chart; it also reached number 15 on the US Album Rock Tracks chart. From January to May 1982, Adams spent months traveling on his \"You Want It You Got It Tour\"; within a few months the album had been picked up across the United States and Adams was soon on tour opening for the Kinks and Foreigner.[44]\n\nCuts Like a Knife, which was released in January 1983, was Adams's breakout album.[45] \"Straight from the Heart\" was the first single released from the album; it reached number 10 on the Billboard Hot 100,[46] number 20 on the Canadian RPM Top 40 chart, and number one on the Canadian Adult Contemporary Chart.[47] In September 1983, Bonnie Tyler released her version for the studio album Faster Than the Speed of Night.[48] The second single, \"Cuts Like a Knife\", rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, number six on the US Album Rock Tracks Chart,[49] and number 12 on the Canadian RPM Top 40 Chart. The third single, \"This Time\", was also a top 30 hit in the US and Canada. Overseas, the latter two singles were both Top 20 hits in New Zealand, but there was little success in any other countries, aside from \"Straight From the Heart\" and \"This Time\" reaching the top 50 in the UK. Three other tracks, \"Take Me Back\", \"I'm Ready\" and \"The Only One\", also received substantial airplay on North American rock radio stations, each making the US Album Rock Tracks chart. The album peaked at number eight on both the Billboard 200 album chart[50] and in Canada, achieving three times platinum status in Canada, platinum status in the United States and gold status in Australia.[40][51] In October, Adams joined Jim Vallance at the Yamaha Music Festival in Japan.[52] The Music Express national popular opinion poll voted him Canada's best male singer for 1982. In 1983, Adams travelled to America, opening for Journey and performing on over 100 dates in five months.[44] On July 30, 1983, he performed at Day on the Green at Oakland Coliseum.[53]\n\nReckless was released in late 1984, and peaked at number one on both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Album Chart, while reaching number two in Australia and number seven in the UK.[54] The album featured six singles, all of which peaked in the Top 15 of the US Billboard Hot 100, only the third album to achieve this:[55] \"Run to You\" (number six in the U.S., number 4 in Canada), \"Somebody\" (number 11 in the U.S.), \"Heaven\" (number 1 in the U.S., number 11 in Canada), written for the film A Night in Heaven, \"Summer of '69\" (number 5 in the U.S., number 11 in Canada), \"One Night Love Affair\" (number 7 in the U.S.), and \"It's Only Love\" (number 14 in the U.S.), a duet with Tina Turner.[56][55][57] The album also did well in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, although \"Summer of '69\" did not do as well at first in the UK since it was not played often on the radio; however, it achieved success later on in the UK, the Netherlands, and Belgium.[58][59][60] \"It's Only Love\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group in 1986. In 1986, the song won an MTV award for Best Stage Performance.[61][62] Reckless also earned Adams a Grammy nomination for Best Male Rock Performance.[34] In December 1984, Adams embarked on a two-year world tour to launch the album. The tour included dates with Tina Turner for her Private Dancer Tour.[63] Adams won Juno Awards for Best Male Vocalist in each year from 1983 to 1987.[64] Reckless eventually went Diamond in sales in Canada, the first album by a Canadian artist to do so, while reaching 5× and 3× Platinum in the US and UK. Reckless has sold over 12 million copies worldwide, and won the Juno Award for Album of the Year in 1985.[65]\n\nIn February 1985, Adams recorded the charity single \"Tears Are Not Enough\" as a member of The Northern Lights, an improvised supergroup that also included Anne Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, Burton Cummings, Joni Mitchell and Neil Young, and other Canadian musical artists. Adams wrote the lyrics and the album; the mission was to raise funds to help the 1983-85 famine in Ethiopia.[66] The song was issued as a single by Columbia Records in March of that year,[67] and reached number one on the Canadian Top 40 chart. It also finished number one on the year-end Canadian charts for 1985. The song's video also received extensive airplay on MuchMusic. The single went triple platinum,[68] although independently recorded by the USA for Africa project, it was included in the full-length We Are the World album. In July 1985, Adams performed the song at the Live Aid concert, at the JFK Stadium in Philadelphia, in front of over 100,000 people.[69][70] In September 1985, Adams co-wrote two tracks for Roger Daltrey's sixth solo album Under a Raging Moon: \"Let Me Down Easy\", originally written for Stevie Nicks, and \"Rebel\". The album was a tribute to The Who's drummer Keith Moon, who died in 1978.[34][71][72][73] The track \"Let Me Down Easy\" was a Top 15 Hit on Billboard's Mainstream Rock Tracks.[74] Nearly 30 years later, Adams released his own version of \"Let Me Down Easy\" on a 30-year anniversary version of Reckless.[75]\n\nIn January 1986, Adams provided the ending background vocals to the song \"Don't Forget Me (When I'm Gone)\" by Canadian rock band Glass Tiger for their debut album The Thin Red Line. It reached number one in Canada and number two in the United States.[76]\n\nHis follow-up album to Reckless was Into the Fire (1987), dealing with more serious subjects following \"Tears Are Not Enough\".[77] This album contained the hit songs \"Heat of the Night\", which went to the top ten in both Canada and the US, and \"Hearts on Fire\".[78]\n\nIn December 1987, Adams contributed the song \"Run Rudolph Run\" to the compilation album A Very Special Christmas, a charity album to benefit the Special Olympics.[79] The album received an RIAA certification of 4x platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipment of four million copies in the United States.[80] It is ranked 19th on the list of best-selling Christmas albums in the United States.[81] In 25 years, it generated $109 million in royalties for the Special Olympics.[82]\n\nIn May 1988, Tommy Mandel joined the Adams band as new keyboardist.\n\nIn the summer of 1989, Adams joined artists to provide backing vocals on a re-recording of the Deep Purple hit \"Smoke On The Water\" in aid of victims of the 1988 Armenian earthquake.[83]\n\nIn August 1989, he recorded the backup vocals for the Belinda Carlisle song \"Whatever It Takes\" from the Runaway Horses album. Also during that time, Adams contributed to Mötley Crüe's work on the album Dr. Feelgood, doing the backing vocals of \"Sticky Sweet\" and Charlie Sexton doing the backing vocals of \"Don't Look Back\" from the Charlie Sexton album.[84][85]\n\nAdams performed at \"A Night for the Environment\" to raise funds for environmental organizations.[86] In November 1989, Adams attended Tina Turner's 50th birthday party at the Reform Club in London.[87] On New Year's Eve 1990, Adams performed at the Tokyo Dome.[88]\n\nIn December 1989, Live! Live! Live!, his first live album, was released. It was recorded live at the Rock Werchter festival on July 3, 1988, in Werchter, Belgium.[89]\n\nHe returned to London and recorded the backing vocals for \"Feels Like Forever\", a song written by Adams for Eric Carmen. In 1990, he received the Order Of British Columbia.[90] Adams added vocal tracks on the melody of David Foster's \"River Of Love\" in his home studio in Vancouver. On July 21, 1990, Adams performed the Pink Floyd tracks \"Young Lust\" and \"Empty Spaces\" at Roger Waters's concert production of The Wall – Live In Berlin, to commemorate the fall of the Berlin Wall eight months earlier.[91][92]\n\nIn 1990, in a 45-minute songwriting session, Adams, Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, and Michael Kamen wrote \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\" for the Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves soundtrack. Kamen sent his score to a number of different artists before Adams, including Kate Bush who turned the score down.[93] \"Everything I Do\" was released internationally on June 12, days after the premiere of the film, with the initial shipment of 385,000 copies being the largest single shipment in the history of A&M Records. It spent a record 16 consecutive weeks at Number One on the UK Singles Chart and seven weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100.[94] The song also gave Adams his first Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Song from a Motion Picture.[95]\n\nAdams and Vallance wrote \"Nature Of The Beast\", originally intended for Tina Turner, but recorded by The Law, featuring Adams on vocals and guitar tracks, in 1991.[96] In May 1991, the music video for the song was created in Sheffield, directed by Julien Temple. In June 1991, a video was shot for the first single album \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\" 'directed by Kevin Godley at Pinewood Studios in London.\n\nOn September 24, 1991, the album Waking Up the Neighbours was released. Co-produced by Adams and Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, it topped the charts around the world, including in the UK, Canada,[97] Australia and Germany and reached number six on the Billboard 200.[98] It became Adams's second album to be certified Diamond in sales in Canada while being certified 5× platinum in the US. It went on to sell 16 million copies worldwide.[8] Waking up the Neighbors became the first album by a Canadian since Neil Young's 1972 Harvest to reach the top of the album charts in the United Kingdom. The album caused controversy in Canada due to the Canadian content system, as the album was largely recorded in England and co-produced by Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, originally from Zambia, making it not Canadian by the rules in effect at the time.[99] Following Adams' complaints, in September of that year, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) announced that the Canadian content rules would be expanded. The regulation at that time considered collaborative writing between Canadians and non-Canadians to be \"Canadian\" only where the lyricist and musical composer worked separately and at least one was Canadian. In protest, Adams briefly threatened to boycott Canada's annual Juno Awards, where his album was eventually almost completely ignored by the awards committee. In 1992, he won the Juno International Achievement Award, Canadian Entertainer of the Year (voted on by the public) and Producer of the Year Award.[100] In September 1991, the regulation was amended to recognize collaborations in which two (or more) contributors each contributed to both lyrics and music, as was the case with Adams and Lange.\n\nIn addition to \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\", the album included \"Can't Stop This Thing We Started\" (number two in the US and number one in Canada), the ballad \"Do I Have to Say the Words?\" (number 11 in the US and in the UK and number one in Canada), \"Thought I'd Died and Gone to Heaven\" (number 8 in the U.S.), and \"There Will Never Be Another Tonight\" (number 2 in Canada). The album won many awards including the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media in 1992.[101] In July 1992, Adams performed at Wembley Stadium in front of 80,000 fans, the largest audience on his tour, with Little Angels and Extreme serving as opening acts.[102][103]\n\nIn 1993, Adams collaborated with Rod Stewart and Sting for the single \"All for Love\" co-written by Adams for the soundtrack of the film The Three Musketeers.[104] The single topped the charts worldwide.[105][106]\n\nIn June 1993, Adams attended a tribute to Sam Cooke in which he played \"Bring It On Home to Me\" in a duet with Smokey Robinson.[107][108][109]\n\nIn November 1993, Adams released So Far So Good, a compilation album that was certified 6× Platinum in the US, 3× Platinum in the UK, 6× Platinum in Canada, and 11× Platinum in Australia.[110] It included a new song called \"Please Forgive Me\", which peaked at number two in the UK,[111] number 7 in the U.S.[57] and was the 10th most popular song in Australia in 1993.[112]\n\nIn 1994, Adams became the first Western artist to perform in Vietnam since James Brown played there in 1971 at the end of the Vietnam War.[113]\n\nIn October 1994, Adams sang one of his favorite songs, \"Hound Dog\", at the Elvis Presley tribute concert in Memphis.[114]\n\nIn September 1994, at the benefit concert Pavarotti & Friends, Adams sang \"Please Forgive Me\", and a version of \"All for Love\" featuring Luciano Pavarotti, Andrea Bocelli, Nancy Gustafson, and Giorgia Todrani.[115][116][117]\n\nIn 1995, Adams released \"Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?\". It was a number one in the US, Canada and Australia, as well as a top five hit in the UK and Germany.

This solo version had been on my computer for years (about 15 years), and when I heard that the creative director of Sony Music, longtime producer and friend of Aretha's Clive Davis, was making a movie about his life, I sent him this version.

Many ballads were included, although it also contained some rock songs such as \"18 til I Die\" and \"The Only Thing That Looks Good on Me Is You\".[238]> The album includes the collaboration of Adams with Gretchen Peters.

I have love for all people and my thoughts are with everyone dealing with this pandemic around the world.\"[307]\n\nAdams also works as a photographer.
