        "text": "CANADIAN FICTION Saints of Big Harbour By Lynn Coady Doubleday Canada, 413 pages, $34.95 Set in the Nova Scotia town of Big Harbour and its satellite villages, Coady's second novel, Saints of Big Harbour, is bleaker and more solemn than her previous work. Her writing has lost none of its bent charm, but the unitary vision of an exuberant, fey young woman that dominated her previous books has been replaced by an impressive variety of narrative voices. -- Beverley Daurio Unless By Carol Shields Random House Canada, 321 pages, $35.95 The meditation on goodness, anger, powerlessness and grief in Shields's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel The Stone Diaries is both continued and enlarged in her brilliant, humane and deeply satisfying new novel, Unless, in which a woman has to deal with a late flowering of rebellion in her 19-year-old daughter. It is part of Shields's genius that she so often offers up humour and compassion on the same plate. But the true gift that she gives us is that of her enormous wisdom. -- Jane Urquhart Family Matters By Rohinton Mistry McClelland & Stewart, 487 pages, $39.99 This affectionate, bittersweet story of domestic life takes as its subject the experiences of one Parsi family living in Bombay over the period of a trying year. Family gatherings in Chateau Felicity are as bitingly funny as the gatherings of the Pocket clan Dickens described in Miss Havisham's banquet hall in Great Expectations. It's humour that owes its brilliance to the darkness around it, nothing so contrived as comic relief, but rather a faithful depiction of a culture that uses laughter to \"make sense of the world.\" -- Joan Thomas Moody Food By Ray Robertson Doubleday Canada, 344 pages, $29.95 It's Yorkville in the sixties, and Mordecai Richler's anti-McCarthy expatriate London filmmakers of an earlier decade have morphed into hippie country-rockers. Robertson is as close to Sartre and Hemingway as the early Richler was, but he's even closer to F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Moody Food can be read as a great twisting of the tale of Gatsby, with amphetamines and cocaine as the tonics of choice. -- T. F. Rigelhof Rush Home Road By Lori Lansens Knopf Canada, 547 pages, $34.95 Debut novelist Lori Lansens revivifies sumptuously and judiciously a corner of black Canadiana. Here, an Ontario almost never imagined, a secret, rural black Ontario, a landscape of tobacco, corn and strawberries, and a history of struggle and beauty, is given magnificent, complex reality, as the story of Adelaide Shadd unfolds. -- George Elliott Clarke Dr. Swarthmore By Alexander Scala Porcupine's Quill, 130 pages, $18.95 It's rural Indiana in the year 1900, and Dr. Swarthmore, a clergyman, attempts to sell doomsday to his fellow Hoosiers at 50 cents per doom. A first novel from Kingston, Ont., resident Alexander Scala, Dr. Swarthmore is a coal-black diamond of a book -- deliciously satiric, studded with masterly turns of phrase and meaning, striking images and spectral revelations. -- Jim Bartley Heave By Christy Ann Conlin Doubleday Canada, 322 pages, $29.95 With the same loving attention to the East Coast of Canada as that of novelists Ann-Marie MacDonald and Lynn Coady, Christy Ann Conlin weaves a tale both tragic and uplifting of small-town Nova Scotia, where everybody knows every mistake you might make. And where those mistakes follow you to the grave. -- Michelle Berry The Peacekeeper's Teahouse By Larry Gaudet Gutter, 220 pages, $19.95 Exploding with sarcastic scenarios and miniature apocalypses, Gaudet's work challenges us to rethink the very firmaments of our existence. By writing of the mirrors that show us everything we do, creating endless prisms of reflection, he questions what it means to get a divorce, mediate peace, make a pot of tea or write a novel. -- Hal Niedzviecki The Falling Woman By Shaena Lambert Vintage Canada, 208 pages, $22.95 Of the 10 stories in this debut short-story collection from Vancouver writer Shaena Lambert, seven are outstanding and often brilliant -- in their gimlet-eyed observation, their bursts or nuances of insight, and their seamless conjoining of form and content. A true heir to Munro and Proulx. -- Jim Bartley Crow Lake By Mary Lawson Knopf, 294 pages, $34.95 In her first novel, Crow Lake, Mary Lawson assesses what gets knotted up and what comes undone in the relationships between brothers and sisters when degrees of higher education physically separate, intellectually invert and emotionally contort the bonds of childhood. A lot of readers are going to surrender themselves to the magic of Crow Lake. -- T. F. Rigelhof Dead Girls By Nancy Lee McClelland & Stewart, 286 pages, $22.95 In this debut collection of short stories, Vancouver writer Nancy Lee is explicit and unequivocal on the perilous isolation that teenagers can inhabit -- a desperately imitative, virtual world full of polarized maleness and femaleness, surging hungers and angers, whet and fed by media shocks and video games, and -- most distressing of all -- the absence of a guiding wisdom. -- Jim Bartley Mount Appetite By Bill Gaston Raincoast, 224 pages, $19.95 Impassioned, funny and fully imagined, the characters in Gaston's latest book, Mount Appetite, spring from the page as from a lush and often gritty Pandora's box. It's a volcanic 12-pack of stories set on both coasts, where demons are respected, even lauded as part and parcel of the experience of being human. -- Marnie Woodrow Night Watch By Kevin Armstrong Penguin, 177 pages, $22 Kevin Armstrong's magnificent story collection, Night Watch -- the eight stories are distributed across the Pacific, South America and the Inside Passage -- is animated by the worldly tradition of Maugham and Hemingway, and yet incises, in the modern fashion, like a flenser. The mostly male protagonists grapple with the preoccupations of young men (chiefly) and women, but also art and, still more slippery, the business of persuading oneself of one's own courage. -- Kevin Patterson Open By Lisa Moore Anansi, 216 pages, $24.95 The latest example of the East Coast eruption is Open, a dazzling collection of stories by Lisa Moore. Set mostly in St. John's, these stories describe a young universe of crushes, betrayals, shaky new marriages and those liminal moments when desire flares up or a friendship takes a pivotal turn. -- Marni Jackson Silent Cruise By Timothy Taylor Vintage Canada, 405 pages, $25 Silent Cruise serves up eight of Timothy Taylor's highly decorated short stories along with a 150-page novella. Almost every one is a marvel of conception and construction -- a clever idea even in synopsis, then shrewdly played out. These are page-turners, with dramatic turns of events and \"hidden stories\" that are revealed in surprising, trump-card endings. -- Kevin Bolger Real Life By Sharon Butala HarperFlamingo Canada, 183 pages, $28 These are gritty, sometimes grim stories, garnered from prairie writer Sharon Butala's wider experience -- only two of the 10 take place on a farm -- and they illustrate what a superb writer of fiction she is. Almost every story involves a broken romance, a desertion, a divorce, a rape, a death. It's the protagonist grappling with the aftermath of these traumatic events that provides such a compelling read. -- Maggie Siggins A Reckless Moon By Dianne Warren Raincoast, 232 pages, $19.95 Dianne Warren's third collection of short stories, A Reckless Moon, shows a gifted writer at the top of her form. The characters, settings and plots vary widely, but one aspect remains constant: the stunning use of imagination. Warren takes both ordinary language and ordinary people, and makes an extraordinary result. -- Candace Fertile The Petty Details of So-and-so's Life By Camilla Gibb Doubleday, 318 pages, $32.95 Ostensibly a growing-up tale, Gibb's novel unfolds in a far more ambitious theatre, reaching beyond the particular epiphanies of its particular characters to exhume and lay bare the crumbling foundations of the complicated social construct we designate as family. The space where children are supposed to expect love and nurturing is often a minefield of potential cruelty and disappointment. -- Aritha van Herk The Lost Garden By Helen Humphreys HarperFlamingo Canada, 184 pages, $28 The Lost Garden -- in which the life of an unloved woman tending her dying mother crosses paths with Virginia Woolf -- embraces the huge and fascinating philosophy of beauty and mourning with devotion and technical discernment. -- Karen Solie Necessary Betrayals By Guillaume Vigneault Translated by Susan Ouriou Douglas & McIntyre, 188 pages, $22.95 This beautifully wrought novel -- a second for this talented young writer -- is his English-language debut. The tale of a young Montreal photographer spinning his wheels in the north hinges on a single misjudgment. A marvel of structure. Our born writer proves to be an invisible craftsman, spinning his raw talent into narrative gold. -- Jim Bartley Private View By Jean McNeil Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 313 pages, $29.95 Private View is set in a section of east London that was completely unfashionable until the lofts, studios and galleries of avant-garde artists began to draw the attention of developers hell-bent on gentrification. Jean McNeil is a strong, clear-headed writer who brings freshness and vibrancy to a pair of characters who are weak and muddled but struggling to rise above their predictability and low spirits. -- T. F. Rigelhof The Last Crossing By Guy Vanderhaeghe McClelland & Stewart, 391 pages, $37.99 Rarely are today's hungry readers invited to such a feast of a book. Guy Vanderhaeghe's The Last Crossing is like a rijstafel of highly seasoned main dishes with innumerable saucers and side-plates of toothsome relishes. Here are brilliant writing, picaresque adventure, plot twists, history and studies of human nature. The cast is packed with sharply drawn cameos and caricatures of frontier and English types. -- Annie Proulx The Polished Hoe By Austin Clarke Thomas Allen, 462 pages, $34.95 Clarke takes us back to 1952, puts us down on the fictional West Indian island of Bimshire, and lets us eavesdrop as Miss Mary Gertrude Mathilda Paul gives her statement regarding the murder of Mr. Bellfeels. The Polished Hoe is tightly focused on the relationships among three characters and a conversation between two of them that alters not only their present lives but their perceptions of their past. -- T. F. Rigelhof Exile By Ann Ireland Dundurn, 304 pages, $34.99 \"I am the kind of man women love,\" announces exiled poet Carlos Romero Estevez, flawed hero of Ann Ireland's engaging new novel, Exile. Carlos's true history is not what we expect. He's terrified that his story won't pass muster, and he'll be subjected to another exile: social and artistic rejection. So he's driven to amend his tale. The unravelling of his Canadian experience makes for an unusual and often delightful portrait of an artist-in-exile who's a kind of literary Homer Simpson. -- Diane Baker Mason The Navigator of New York By Wayne Johnston Knopf Canada, 486 pages, $35.95 Set at the close of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, Navigator moves from near-rustic St. John's, Nfld., to the pandemonium of Manhattan and Brooklyn as Gotham becomes a city with cathedrals to commerce. Johnston employs recent history as loosely and freely as Shakespeare used it in his tragedies, and for similar moral (not moralistic) purposes. Navigator outdoes his splendid imaginary account of Joey Smallwood's Newfoundland, The Colony of Unrequited Dreams (1998), in descriptive power, depth of characterization and intricacy of plot. -- T. F. Rigelhof Stay By Aislinn Hunter Raincoast, 272 pages, $21.95 Stay revolves around Dermot Fay, an aging Irish ex-university professor, and Abbey, a young Canadian who has come to Ireland to escape the ghost of her mentally abusive father. For all the complexity in Hunter's rich book, there is also a certain quietness and simplicity to the prose, a minute attention to detail and an elegance in the natural dialogue. -- Michelle Berry Rogues' Wedding By Terry Griggs Random House Canada, 304 pages, $34.95 Terry Griggs's second novel is as exuberantly inventive, verbally juiced up and sexually outrageous as her first, The Lusty Man -- and more pointedly iconoclastic. Indeed, the persecuted hero's one constant possession in his perilous travels is a journal kept by one William Dowsing, professional iconoclast, whose business was to traverse Civil War England, destroying sacred images raised up by previous generations. -- Mary Millar INTERNATIONAL FICTION Collected Stories By Saul Bellow Viking, 442 pages, $44 The gems in this book, and they are magnificent gems, perfect, sad, beautiful, profound, are primarily from the earlier incarnation of Saul Bellow, before the concentration upon intellectual matters and the formulaic resistance to drama and incident that seems to have accompanied this pursuit of the abstract. -- Rick Moody Any Human Heart: The Intimate Journals of Logan Mountstuart By William Boyd Hamish Hamilton, 504 pages, $34 Born in 1906, Logan Mountstuart relates his education, apprenticeship, breakthrough and decline into obscurity. Along the way, his \"career\" of boozing, sex, marriages and grief is interrupted by service as a spy for the British Navy in the Second World War, entanglement in a conspiracy and many more adventures. More engaging, however, is the ever-maturing voice of Mountstuart himself. -- Andrew Pyper Versailles By Kathryn Davis Houghton Miffin, 206 pages, $33.95 In Versailles, her latest novel, Davis turns from the future to the past. Recounting the story of Marie Antoinette, from the long carriage ride that bears her, at the age of 14, from Austria to France to wed the French Dauphin, until her death at the guillotine 24 years later, this slim novel cleaves to the known facts of the French queen's life, but hardly offers a straightforward fictional biography. -- Catherine Bush Coraline By Neil Gaiman HarperCollins, 162 pages, $23.95 The latest masterpiece from the brilliantly creative mind of fantasist Neil Gaiman, Coraline is the story of a young girl who, despite being loved and well-treated by her parents, is very much alone, and wanders about the property discovering a cast of strange characters. Gaiman, a boyish, playful rogue whose work is marked by a sort of innocence, has a knack for speaking in a teen's tongue. -- Bram Eisenthal Enemy Women By Paulette Jiles William Morrow, 321 pages, $24.95 Paulette Jiles's new novel about the American civil war, Enemy Women, succumbs to none of the easy temptations or predications of most war novels. Instead, it is a step-by-step walk through one young woman's unjust incarceration, subsequent escape and long journey home. -- Aritha van Herk A Simple Habana Melody (from when the world was good) By Oscar Hijuelos Harper Collins, 342 pages, $37.95 A Simple Habana Melody is an elegant and profoundly touching moral tale that does not moralize: a reflection on the question of what it means to be good in a world gone bad. Passionate, complex, contradictory and, above all, truly \"good,\" the hero, Cuban maestro Israel Levis -- corpulent composer of infectious Cuban emblems who spent his life wishing to be taken as a serious composer, this romantic, fallible hedonist -- is utterly unforgettable. -- Camilla Gibb The Crazed By Ha Jin Pantheon, 323 pages, $36 Ha Jin's new novel -- set in 1989, the year of the Tiananmen Square student uprising -- is fierce and raw, but nuanced. His story unfolds in flashbacks -- one within another -- and the surprise is that much of the narrative consists of the dreams, nightmares and deliriums of a dying man. Written out of the depths of radical disillusionment and anguish, The Crazed is a blistering moral scrutiny of some of the effects of the Cultural Revolution. -- Keith Garebian Roscoe By William Kennedy Viking, 291 pages, $35.99 This is the story of Albany politics, circa 1945. It centres on Roscoe, son of Felix Conway, former Democrat mayor and the grand old fixer of anything political. Roscoe has inherited the mantle of responsibility, but finds it a pyramid of troubles. This is a great novel about the foul inner workings of the American political system. In the end, Roscoe the man is symbolic of the republic itself -- at once dishonest, brave, corpulent, idealistic, deceitful, caring, conniving. -- Brad Smith Mr. Potter By Jamaica Kincaid Knopf Canada, 195 pages, $29.95 Her novel, Mr. Potter, which might have worked better as a novella but which Jamaica Kincaid has written as a novel, is nothing if not beautiful, compassionate and entirely too moving to bear too much thinking about thinking about it, so awe-inspiring and gut-wrenching are its contents. -- Judith Fitzgerald Resurrection Men By Ian Rankin Orion, 440 pages, $24.95 In Resurrection Men, his 13th outing, Rebus is sent for \"retraining\" at Tulliallan Castle, the Scottish Police College, which also doubles as a sort of reform school for wayward detectives. On the surface, he is sent there for throwing a mug of tea at his boss, DCS Gill Templer, but we soon discover that there is a hidden agenda. Once again, a compelling read. -- Peter Robinson The Horned Man By James Lasdun Norton, 193 pages, $35.99 You might categorize James Lasdun's impressive novel, The Horned Man,as Raymond Chandler meets Kafka, with hints of Borges, Nabokov and Nikolai Gogol's Diary of a Madman. The Horned Man -- about a sexual hysteric who teaches gender studies and spins the web of his own destruction -- is no blockbuster (too literary), but it shares with the above-named authors a potent sense of human dislocation. -- Martin Levin All Souls Day By Cees Nooteboom Translated by Susan Massotty Harcourt, 340 pages, $40 All Souls Day,from Dutch writer Cees Nooteboom, has as much depth and gravitas as the work of the late W. G. Sebald, as well as some of the bohemian playfulness of Umberto Eco and Julio Cortazar. The tale of a middle-aged Dutch documentary filmmaker touched by tragedy is deeply rewarding. This novel of ideas is a singular work, so apart from its own era that it feels fresh, even though it echoes romantic 19th-century melancholy. -- Antanas Sileika The Lovely Bones By Alice Sebold Little, Brown, 328 pages, $29.95 In 1973, Susie Salmon is brutally raped and murdered by her next-door neighbour, George Harvey, a creepy single man who digs a hole in the ground and tempts Susie down into it. The novel starts on this last day in Susie's life and continues from there. To be able to narrate an adult book from the perspective of a 14-year-old, and do it well, is hard enough. To be able to narrate the book from a Heaven that sounds completely reasonable, completely right, borders on genius. -- Michelle Berry Everything is Illuminated By Jonathan Safran Foer Houghton Mifflin, 276 pages, $34.95 In Everything is Illuminated, we ride the humour train right up to the portals of hell and gaze into an unspeakable world that has left its survivors \"tangled in remembrance.\" It is here that comedy and tragedy collide and poignancy resides -- and here that this strange blend of fiction and memoir fortify each other into an enchanting, powerful work -- from a wise novelist not yet 25. -- Joseph Kertes The Sweetest Dream By Doris Lessing HarperCollins, 479 pages, $41.40 Nurturing and caring are the only salves that seem to soothe Lessing's convincing cast of angry intellectuals, misguided teenagers, depressed housewives and dying Africans. But The Sweetest Dream, her best book in years, kindles hope that individuals, through one little dream at a time, can change the world. -- Barbara McLean In the Forest By Edna O'Brien Houghton Mifflin, 262 pages, $34.95 In the Forest is O'Brien's 15th novel, and it's a psychological thriller, a book of terrifying clarity about madness and brutality. Loosely based on a series of real murders that took place in 1994 in County Clare, Ireland, and the psychopath who committed them, In the Forest has the flavour and intensity of a Ruth Rendell novel. -- John Doyle BIOGRAPHY John Maynard Keynes: Fighting for Britain 1937-1946 By Robert Skidelsky Macmillan, 559 pages, $64.50 In the concluding volume of his definitive Keynes trilogy, Robert Skidelsky weaves the disparate and defining themes that played out in the life and times of the scholar-statesman-economist-arts aficionado with a sureness of vision that at times borders on brilliant. In the final instalment, the historian and professor of political economy at Britain's Warwick University sets out a compelling account of the ways in which Keynes's theories formed the bedrock for the postwar economic order. -- Kevin Doyle The Years of Lyndon Johnson: Master of the Senate By Robert A. Caro Knopf, 1,167 pages, $53 Since a decade was spent on the research for the book, expectations are high. Caro fulfills them. He combines the scholarship of an academic with the storytelling talents of a great journalist. Master of the Senate, a 1,167-page high-rise, tackles Johnson's career in the sweet decade of the 1950s, and is the third in a series. No parts are spared -- not even the private ones -- in Caro's vivid and grand depiction of the larger-than-life figure from Texas. -- Lawrence Martin Shakey: Neil Young's Biography By Jimmy McDonough Random House Canada, 786 pages, $45 Strange guy, Neil Percival Young, born Nov. 12, 1945, in Toronto. And a lot of the strangeness is captured in Shakey, the long-awaited Young biography by Village Voice-Mojo contributor Jimmy McDonough. Almost 10 years in the preparation, beribboned with the results of some 300 interviews with friends, family, long-forgotten acquaintances and associates, this is the definitive take. -- James Adams Flaubert: A Life By Geoffrey Wall Faber & Faber, 416 pages, $50 Geoffrey Wall, who teaches French at the University of York in Britain, has written a first-rate biography of Flaubert that is continuously vivid and lively, but never falls into the trap of telescoping complex and subtle periods or attitudes in his subject's life into slick generalizations. -- Don Coles Churchill: A Biography By Roy Jenkins Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1,002 pages, $60 Roy Jenkins's 1,000-page biography of the man who operated at the irritating fringes of British politics for decades, oscillated from party to party, and talked big but accomplished little, all before finding his cause and his calling in what was the signature struggle of the last century, is a formidable contribution to Churchilliana. -- David M. Shribman Charles Dickens By Jane Smiley Viking, 212 pages, $28.99 Jane Smiley gives us a Dickens freed from current academic theory and from psychoanayltic readings of his painful childhood (although she can't resist completely; the material is too rich). Rather she sets out to place Dickens in his own world, in which he masterfully walked the line between art and commerce (I'd say he obliterated it) and became perhaps the first true modern celebrity. -- Martin Levin Dostoevsky: The Mantle of the Prophet, 1871-81 By Joseph Frank Princeton University Press, 784 pages, $54.50 One of the many strengths of this fifth and final volume of Joseph Frank's biographical and critical study is that, while its intention is to show Dostoevsky as a man of his time, it reminds us that as psychologist, religious thinker, analyst of modernism and radically innovative novelist, he is also one of us. -- Sam Solecki Flint and Feather: The Life and Times of E. Pauline Johnson, Tekahionwake By Charlotte Gray HarperFlamingo Canada, 438 pages, $37.95 Pauline Johnson, the youngest child of an impoverished English gentlewoman and a Mohawk chief, grew up in a gracious riverside house near the Six Nation Reserve in Ontario. As Gray observes in her compassionate, measured biography, this pastoral balance of native and white cultures did not long survive, even as Johnson sought to be its embodiment as a writer, a performer and a woman. -- Marian Botsford Fraser Lives of the Muses: Nine Women and the Artists They Inspired By Francine Prose HarperFlamingo Canada, 416 pages, $34.95 What artist in his right mind would give up the agency and expression of artistic creation for the passive dependency of the muse? None portrayed here, certainly, a point you can't help revisiting when reading this wittily entertaining mini-encyclopedia of nine artists and the women who inspired (supported, encouraged, posed for, shopped for, cooked for, nursed, mothered and loved) them. -- Kathleen Byrne MEMOIR Don't Let's Go To the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood By Alexandra Fuller Random House, 301 pages, $37.95 This is southern Africa in the 1970s, Rhodesia before it became Zimbabwe, where the bogeymen under the bed are local terrorists, where landmines and guerrilla camps are a fact of life, and where Alexandra and her sister Vanessa get shooting lessons in the garden (next to the scorpion-infested swimming pool, natch). An affecting love letter to the land in which Fuller grew up. -- Daneet Steffens Until Death Do Us Part: My Struggle to Reclaim Colombia By Ingrid Betancourt HarperCollins, 228 pages, $37.95 The daughter of Colombia's ambassador to UNESCO and a beauty contestant turned social activist, Ingrid Betancourt was raised with both luxury and privilege, and married her first husband in France. She left him to return to her country to become a senator and presidential hopeful, who was kidnapped in February, her life now in a perilous situation. In simple, and often quite lovely prose, the book is a true-life political thriller, a deeply personal tale and -- at its core -- the story of a courageous woman making difficult choices. -- Linda Richards Lake of the Prairies: A Story of Belonging By Warren Cariou Doubleday Canada, 319 pages, $32.95 Meadow Lake is a \"sleepy town, a violent town, a town with secrets, a town of simple beauty and brazen ugliness.\" It has one pool hall, one set of traffic lights. From the outset, Cariou is swarmed by the voices he grew up with: bedtime stories, tales of disaster, tall tales of lightning, big fish, fires and guns, and gossip. He has internalized so many key stories about Meadow Lake -- Clayton Matchee, clearcutting blockades -- that he has, in a sense, become the place, embodying its comic and chaotic energy. -- David Carpenter Starting Out in the Afternoon: A Mid-Life Journey into Wild Land By Jill Frayne Random House Canada, 256 pages, $32.95 In her early 40s, Jill Frayne, a family therapist living in a refurbished schoolhouse north of Toronto, found herself \"renegotiating\" her relationship with her longtime partner, Leon, and watching her 17-year-old daughter Bree grow away from her. Her instinct was to set off on a three-month camping tour of Canada, alone. The writing is transcendental, ecstatic, as crisp and clear as Lake Superior in October. -- Wayne Grady The Black Veil: A Memoir with Digressions By Rick Moody Little, Brown, 320 pages, $34.95 Trust Rick Moody to steer the burgeoning genre of the depression memoir not just onto a different road, but completely off-road, careering through the literal, literary and psychological underbrush of Maine, Connecticut, the New York City subway system, the fabric department of a Saratoga Springs Wal-Mart, murder, Nathaniel Hawthorne, semiotics, Puritan clergymen, a genealogical mystery and the shadowy linguistic thickets of the words \"veil,\" \"moody\" and \"black\" -- with nary a seratonin re-uptake inhibitor in sight. -- Zsuzsi Gartner How Linda Died By Frank Davey ECW, 341 pages, $15.95 How Linda Died is a fast-moving, transparently written, utterly absorbing story of a marriage, a family and the death of the \"aggressively self-sufficient\" person who was its centre. Telling the story of how Linda Davey lived as well as how she died, her widower has a protagonist worthy of Thackeray or Stendahl. -- Katherine Ashenburg The Voice Gallery: Travels with a Glass Throat By Keath Fraser Thomas Allen, 338 pages, $34.95 When Keath Fraser discovered he had laryngeal dystonia, a misfiring of the vocal cords, he set out around the globe in search of other sufferers. He wants to answer the question: \"What does it mean to have a voice?\" Fraser indulges another obsession on this round-the-world voice tour. He is crazy about glass houses. As a fiction writer, he has a field day with the symbolic interplay between the artifice of greenhouses and the artifice of his Botox injections. -- Bronwyn Drainie Houseboat Chronicles: Notes from a Life in Shield Country By Jake MacDonald McClelland & Stewart, 291 pages, $34.99 Winnipeg writer Jake MacDonald's captivating memoir, Houseboat Chronicles, is set in the northwestern Ontario bush. He examines the birth and lifelong passion for wilderness -- in \"shield country\" -- with a touch of Grey Owl (the self-transforming imagination), a dollop of Mark Twain (brilliant comic iconoclasm) and a merciful twist of Bart Simpson (a capability for \"keeping it real,\" as Lisa Simpson once put it). -- Charles Wilkins Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood -- A Memoir of Growing up Female in a Muslim World By Taslima Nasrin Translated by Gopa Majumdar Steerforth, 308 pages, $39.95 Meyebela: My Bengali Girlhood, written following activist Nasrin's escape to Europe, is a memoir and a political act following the writing of her incendiary novel Shame. Nasrin tells the often harrowing story of her journey from birth to adolescence. It was necessary for her to create new language to denote this passage, as none existed in her native tongue. The Bengali term for childhood is chelebela: boy-time. Meyebela, an act of radical linguistics, means girl-time. -- Christina Mairin The Snow Geese: A Story of Home By William Fiennes Random House Canada, 253 pages, $34.95 Whether it's a flock of snow geese passing over him near Austin, a man inadvertently walking through a restaurant's plate-glass door in North Dakota, or the cat-shaped lamp on the bedside table of a cabin near Gimli, Man., Fiennes's sketches are entertaining and startlingly evocative, almost hyper-real, like an Alex Colville painting. -- Moira Farr CINEMA The Conversations: Walter Murch and the Art of Editing Film By Michael Ondaatje Vintage Canada, 339 pages, $34.95 The Conversations is for readers who share with Ondaatje and Murch (Ford Coppola's film and sound editor) a taste for the arcane, an interest in the miscellaneous detail, an appreciation for nuance. There's an almost 19th-century quality to these exchanges, as two men at the respective peaks of their professions, and unashamed of their erudition, ramble across the landscape of their common interests. -- David Weaver CORRESPONDENCE The Letters of Arturo Toscanini Edited and translated by Harvey Sachs Knopf, 468 pages, $53 Harvey Sachs, Toscanini's great biographer, has unearthed thousands of hitherto unknown letters from the brilliant conductor to a number of people, and has assembled many of those letters in this large, well-designed, beautifully translated and utterly absorbing book. Toscanini reveals a lyrical side only hinted at by his tremendous interest in literature and painting -- and a sexual side the explicitness of which is relatively shocking. -- Lawrie Cherniack The Book of Letters: 150 Years of Private Canadian Correspondence Edited by Paul and Audrey Grescoe Macfarlane Walter & Ross, 333 pages, $34.99 If journalism is the first rough draft of history, letters are history on the fly, captured, often unwittingly, by unselfconscious witnesses and brought gloriously to life. The Book of Letters is a little treasure box of Canadian history . . . it is the voice of the past, ringing clear and fine across the years. -- Kathleen Byrne SCIENCE & HEALTH The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature By Steven Pinker Viking, 509 pages, $39.99 This book argues that, in common-sense assumptions and observations about human nature, the majority has got it right while the scientific establishment has got it wrong. According to Montreal-born Steven Pinker, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, mainstream scientists have allowed political, spiritual and social concerns about racism, inequality, imperfectability, determinism and nihilism to take precedence over science's tradition of freedom. -- Patrick Watson Beyond Crazy: Journeys Through Mental Illness By Julia Nunes and Scott Simmie McClelland & Stewart, 294 pages, $34.99 Beyond Crazy is another account of illnesses from schizophrenia to suicide, enlisting such well-known Canadians as Andy Barrie, Rona Maynard and Michael Wilson, who have come forth with their own psychic battles. This book deserves to have the effect on the mental-health field that Upton Sinclair's The Jungle had on the meat-packing industry. And it is compulsively readable. -- Catherine Gildiner Pain: The Fifth Vital Sign By Marni Jackson Random House Canada, 366 pages, $34.95 As the phenomenon of pain has been taken over by the medical profession, and we concentrate simply on extinguishing it, we have lost a broader sense of its possible meanings. Propelled by curiosity and a lucid and accessible intelligence, Jackson's book is a timely and necessary contribution to this important dialogue. -- Catherine Bush The Measure of All Things: The Seven-Year Odyssey and Hidden Error that Transformed the World By Ken Alder Free Press, 402 pages, $42 Metric, as we have known it here in Canada for more than the past three decades, is continental, current and pretty darn cool. Or is it? Ken Alder's truly excellent new book offers up a wonderful antidote to this ghastly and conformist view. It is a vade mecum for those who hold a contrary opinion -- a guidebook for those (among whom I count myself) who heartily detest all things metric, and who accept its dominance only with spirits glum. -- Simon Winchester HISTORY Paris 1919: Six Months that Changed the World By Margaret MacMillan Random House, 570 pages, $53 The locale is Paris, 1919; the setting, the Hall of Mirrors in the Palace of Versailles; the score, foxtrots and tangos. The victorious Allies of the Great War assemble to settle accounts with Germany. This is no movie, but history -- history as never before told. Broad in scope, magisterial in detail, Margaret MacMillan's Paris 1919 is a compelling, funny and ultimately tragic narrative. -- Chris Scott Canada: A People's History, Volume II By Don Gillmor, Achille Michaud and Pierre Turgeon McClelland & Stewart, 342 pages, $60 Like its predecessor, Volume II (the 1870s to the 1990s) is remarkably handsome, an oversize format with photographs and art aplenty, in colour and black and white. This book is more of a \"people's history\" than the first volume, getting into the text and innumerable sidebars the stories of some \"ordinary\" people, along with those of the extraordinary like Norman Bethune. -- J. L. Granatstein Promised the Moon: The Untold Story of the First Women in the Space Race By Stephanie Nolen Penguin Canada, 356 pages, $35 Nolen presents real stories of women in the 1940s, '50s and early '60s, who were disadvantaged because of their gender in trying to pursue professional careers in aviation. In the middle third, the dream to fly into space propels these women into the world of aerospace medicine. The remaining chapters explore the murky area of NASA policy and the \"lethal combination of the personalities involved\" during those prelunar landing days. -- Roberta Bondar The Popes Against the Jews: The Vatican's Role in the Rise of Modern Anti-Semitism By David I. Kertzer Knopf, 355 pages, $41.95 David Kertzer, an anthropologist and historian at Brown University, and the author of a case study of modern Catholic anti-Semitism ( The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara, 1997) challenges a popular view among Catholics that there was little linkage between centuries of Church doctrine disparaging Judaism and the racist anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust. -- Derek J. Penslar Mavericks: An Incorrigible History of Alberta By Aritha van Herk Penguin, 352 pages, $35 Most of Alberta's mavericks, as painted by novelist-turned-historian Aritha van Herk, appear on one of two canvases: those of the quiet, self-effacing characters such as the brilliant surveyor, David Thompson, or the quirky populist, Henry Wise Wood; and those of the brash self-promoters, such as HBC chief factor John Rowand, who ruled Edmonton like a Bavarian king. -- Andrew Nikiforuk What Went Wrong? Western Impact and Middle Eastern Response By Bernard Lewis Oxford University Press, 180 pages, $29.95 The humbling of Islam, the most powerful movement of the first half of the last millennium, is the subject of Bernard Lewis's masterful new study, What Went Wrong? Lewis argues persuasively that the serious damage to Islamic prospects occurred long before Napoleon marched virtually unopposed into Egypt. -- Brett Grainger The Rescue of Jerusalem: The Alliance between Hebrews and Africans in 701 B.C. By Henry T. Aubin Doubleday Canada, 421 pages, $39.99 A special circle in Paradise is reserved for writers such as Henry Aubin: those able to deal with really big ideas or occasions, and to do so convincingly in tight, readable, unpretentious language. The issue here is a terribly big one, and involves an occasion that was widely known among educated people a century or more ago, but which has slipped from our collective knowledge -- namely, why was Jerusalem not trashed by the Assyrians in 701 BC? -- Donald Harman Akenson POETRY Apocrypha of Light By Lorna Crozier McClelland & Stewart, 80 pages, $16.99 Approaching the book of Gene- sis, Lorna Crozier writes poems for the unheard voices of women, animals and even light itself: \"what [light]tongued/ sparked visible then glowed,/ warmed by its golden spittle.\" Crozier's deft, taut lines vividly evoke the anguish and rage of these voices. -- Meg Walker thirsty By Dionne Brand McClelland & Stewart, 65 pages, $16.99 Brand's voice never falters in thirsty, a long narrative poem. She tantalizes us with her vision of a geographical space, its marginal, integral citizens, who dream of a sustaining past (\"She is elsewhere, by a river, the Rio Cobre, pitching stones\") and expire in a present that is too awful to behold: Her stunning facility with the lyric is in full effect. -- Lynn Crosbie If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho Translated by Anne Carson Knopf, 397 pages, $42.95 Sappho's To a Beloved Woman, or The Ode to Anactoria, the oft-translated and imitated fragment (cf. Catullus, Ambrose Philips, W. E. Gladstone, Tennyson, Sir R. F. Burton et al.) is rendered with chimerical freshness and colloquial verve by the McGill University classicist. -- Judith Fitzgerald POLITICS & SOCIETY Con Game: The Truth About Canada's Prisons By Michael Harris McClelland & Stewart, 371 pages, $36.99 Michael Harris ventured behind the high walls and razor wire of a number of very tough and dangerous federal penitentiaries to get at the truth about Canada's prisons. What he came away with can best be described as an explosive one-man royal commission into the nation's grossly mismanaged prison system. -- Victor Malarek Power: Journeys Across an Energy Nation By Gordon Laird Viking, 347 pages, $35 Although the corporate shenanigans of Quebec Hydro, the bankrupt politics of uranium mining or the hazards of offshore drilling rarely make dinner conversation or our newspapers these days, Gordon Laird's book might change that for a day or two. The Toronto-based reporter argues that Canada is the most energy-intensive economy in the world, and the globe's second-largest belcher of greenhouse gases. An ambitious and sprawling work. -- Andrew Nikiforuk 'A Problem from Hell': America and the Age of Genocide By Samantha Power Basic Books, 610 pages, $44.95 This marvellous book explores the conception of genocide as a new, important category of human-rights crime, and the history of these mass crimes in the 20th century, focusing on U.S. passivity in the face of often irrefutable proof of their severity. While the primary focus lies with the U.S. government, author Samantha Power (executive director of the Carr Center for Human Rights Policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government) makes clear that Washington had plenty of Western company. -- David M. Malone Fights of Our Lives: Elections, Leadership and the Making of Canada By John Duffy HarperCollins, 357 pages, $55 To take our deadened past and charmingly revitalize it is no small task. But Duffy, a 38-year-old public-relations consultant, illuminates the broad canvas of our electoral history with the artistry of a Group of Seven master. Though a big \"L\" Liberal, his bias never shows in the telling of the story. Most important, he has had experience on the inside of campaigns, which perhaps explains how the volume teems with so much shrewd analysis. -- Lawrence Martin A Fury for God: The Islamist Attack on America By Malise Ruthven Granta Books, 324 pages, $34.50 In this dense and powerful book, Ruthven concludes that the Islamist leaders are victims of a peculiarly modern dilemma, a \"clash of cultures\" not so much between civilizations as within the individual. The movement's spearhead has been forged in a furnace in which uneducated religiosity combines with rage, utopianism, social anomie and technical sophistication. -- Paul William Roberts RELIGION Christ: A Crisis in the Life of God By Jack Miles Knopf, 352 pages, $39.95 As a biographer of Jesus Christ, Jack Miles is lucid, forceful, powerful, spontaneous, deeply unorthodox and literary. In his Christ, there's birth and death and much in between to engage those who like to think about what they read, and to offend those who want others to do their thinking for them. -- T. F. Rigelhof Pope John XXIII: A Penguin Life By Thomas Cahill Viking, 244 pages, $28.95 Thomas Cahill's superb biography traces Angelo Roncalli's origins and his lifelong concern for the poor, the weak and the oppressed. Whenever Roncalli was granted a chance to make a difference, Cahill shows how the courageous man who brought about the winds of change in Vatican II played every card in his hand. -- Chris Morrissey Varieties of Religion Today: Remembering William James By Charles Taylor Harvard University Press, 127 pages, $30.95 The best guide for this new world of personal religious experience is William James's The Varieties of Religious Experience, published in 1902. McGill University philosopher Charles Taylor returns to James's arguments to shed light on the contemporary spiritual scene. Varieties of Religion Today: William James Revisited is a rich, thought-provoking book, offering an incisive analysis of contemporary religious movements. -- Peter Emberley CULTURE Souvenir of Canada By Douglas Coupland Douglas & McIntyre, 144 pages, $26.95 Like vinegar cruets on every restaurant table in the land, pre-1980 stubby beer bottles, our obsession with hockey, poutine, Quebec separation, the United States and the fact that our candy bars have different ingredients than their U.S. counterparts. What results in Souvenir of Canada is vintage Coupland -- a passionate, sentimental and political slice of Canadian life. -- Carla M. Lucchetta The Mourner's Dance: What We Do When People Die By Katherine Ashenburg Macfarlane Walter & Ross, 339 pages, $34.99 We begin with Ashenburg's own experience of sudden death, when her daughter's fiancé was killed in a car accident. Hannah engaged in a kind of \"active mourning,\" creating her own rituals and flouting Western attitudes. From this point, The Mourner's Dance is a serendipitous tour of anthropology, cultural history, psychology and personal reflection. The buoyant narrative is moving, exotic, outrageous. -- Keith Nickson SPORTS Facing Ali: The Opposition Weighs In By Stephen Brunt Knopf Canada, 352 pages, $27.95 In Facing Ali, Stephen Brunt's method of revealing the human story is as rich as it is simple. By interviewing 15 prize fighters who entered the ring against Muhammad Ali, Brunt illuminates how these people were affected, and paints a composite portrait of the man at the centre of it all. -- Timothy Taylor LITERATURE & CRITICISM Genius: A Mosaic of One Hundred Exemplary Creative Minds By Harold Bloom Warner, 815 pages, $55 In this book of appreciation for \"one hundred exemplary minds,\" Bloom's aim is nothing less than a one-man crusade for the idea of timelessness. It is easy to make fun of Bloom, with his old-fashioned magical diagrams and schoolboy crushes. But he is that rare thing among readers, still more among professors: a true lover. Foibles and tics and errors included, he is just what his mentor Dr. Johnson was, too, namely a genius of appreciation. His book, so apparently heavy, is a triumph of lightness. -- Mark Kingwell When Words Deny the World: The Reshaping of Canadian Writing By Stephen Henighan Porcupine's Quill, 211 pages, $19.95 Our books were once condemned for being too Canadian. Being perpetually hammered over the head by this foreign perception, we subsequently internalized \"our inexorable transferral from a postcolonial realm to a globalized sphere\" and commenced writing what Stephen Henighan, in When Words Deny the World, labels \"Free Trade Fiction.\" Citing the success of Michael Ondaatje, Anne Michaels, Rohinton Mistry and others, Henighan details his \"flight from history\" theory in this brilliantly insurgent book of 14 essays. -- Kenneth J. Harvey Negotiating with the Dead: A Writer on Writing By Margaret Atwood Cambridge, 219 pages, $27.95 Delivered to a Cambridge University audience in 2000, Negotiating with the Dead springs from the Empson Lectures, named after English scholar William Empson. The pleasures of orality ripple through these book-bound talks on writing. Atwood tells of her relationship with words in a charming voice. She's good craic, as the Irish say. -- J. S. Porter Spar: Words in Place By Peter Sanger Gaspereau, 103 pages, $21.95 In the late '80s, a man I'd never heard of, Peter Sanger, published an essay called The Crooked Knife -- a staple of the native craftsman's kit, used for making everything from totem poles to Iroquois false faces, paddles to ladles, fish traps to Red River carts -- in The Antigonish Review. I read it then with great delight. I've just reread it with even greater pleasure, in a richer, deeper context, as one of four far-reaching, homespun meditations that constitute this book. -- Robert Bringhurst Step Across This Line: Collected Nonfiction 1992-2002 By Salman Rushdie Knopf Canada, 402 pages, $37.95 Now that, in the West, religious cant is back in fashion, and the ideals of the Enlightenment are continually under attack, we forget the vital connection between critical thought, freedom of expression -- and freedom itself. In Step Across This Line -- a collection of essays on cultural and political themes -- Rushdie reminds us that without freedom of thought and expression, there is no freedom at all. -- Gilbert Reid The Notebooks: Interviews and New Fiction by Contemporary Writers Edited by Michelle Berry and Natalee Caple Anchor Canada, 506 pages, $25.95 Writers talking to other writers, about writing -- this might sound awfully rarefied, like fishermen discussing hand-tied flies. But The Notebooks (modeled after the George Plimpton Paris Review interviews) in which 17 youngish Canadian writers, from Michael Redhill to Lynn Crosbie, explore the nature of their craft, is thoroughly entertaining, and even inspiring. -- Marni Jackson Sign after the X . . . By Marina Roy Arsenal Pulp, 220 pages, $18.95 Strictly speaking, Sign after the X . . . is not a wordbook at all; it is a letter book. And when that letter is \"X\" and an author has Marina Roy's deconstructing, reconstructing love of pancultural ways of hearing, seeing and reading both history and contemporary life, as filtered through this letter, it is a great ride. -- Gale Zoë Garnett Tom Thomson Edited by Dennis Reid Douglas & McIntyre, 386 pages, $65 Tom Thomson is one of the first major multi-authored books on this subjects, and it has a critical edge that has been missing in the mostly celebratory, decorative works that have come before. The picture that emerges from the essays is complex, contradictory, sometimes even confused -- but it's what is needed right now. -- Alison Gillmor TRAVEL The Way of a Ship: A Square-Rigger Voyage in the Last Days of Sail By Derek Lundy Knopf Canada, 445 pages, $37.95 Derek Lundy's new, and marvellous, The Way of a Ship attempts an unusual trick. After declaring itself a work of non-fiction, it co-opts the form of the novel, with narrative arc and wholly imagined characters. But the book is preoccupied with setting rather than character. The setting is the sea. -- Kevin Patterson The Art of Travel By Alain De Botton Hamish Hamilton, 261 pages, $32.95 British writer and broadcaster Alain De Botton muses about the nature of travel, its disappointments, its enthrallments, the escape it offers but doesn't always deliver. A well-organized writer (his suitcases must be marvels of economy), he structures this latest exploration under five crisp headings: Departure, Motives, Landscape, Art and Return. It is a joy and a pleasure to fly with De Botton across zones of time and thought. -- Sarah Sheard"
