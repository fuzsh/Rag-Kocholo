        "text": "Starting out his life as a sickly child with a passion for music, Neil Young has grown to become one of the most influential songwriters and musicians of all time. Coming into prominence during one of the most pivotal moments of music history, he has proven himself to be a master of genres with a deep understanding of music. Known for his work in Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse, and Crosby Stills, Nash & Young, he has gifted us with songs like \"Heart of Gold,\" \"Old Man,\" and \"Harvest Moon\". He's called the Godfather of Grunge for a reason and his music and accomplishments are recognized by generations both young and old. This is the life and times of Neil Young.\n\nA Sickly Childhood\n\nNeil Young was born on November 12, 1945, in Toronto, Canada. After living in Toronto for just four years, his family moved to the rural town of Omemee, where Neil and his brother Robert would spend their boyhood years. While Neil should have had a typical childhood, he suffered from numerous illnesses including epilepsy, Type 1 diabetes, and polio.\n\nBy 1951, he was in such bad health that he was unable to even walk. Over time, Young got over his ailments and had developed an interest in music, learning to play the ukelele and the banjo."
