        "text": "On Thursday night, magic happened in Tennesseee.\n\nSinger-songwriter Neil Young and rock band Crazy Horse came together to perform their hits over a two-hour show at FirstBank Amphitheater on their first tour together in a decade.\n\nThe 2024 \"Love Earth Tour\" features the now 78-year-old singer alongside the Los Angeles rock band yet again.\n\nCanadian singer-songwriter Young, best known for songs \"Heart of Gold,\" \"Harvest Moon\" and \"Old Man,\" released the album \"Fu##in' Up\" with Crazy Horse on April 25, featuring nine rock 'n' roll tracks. The two have released 15 studio albums together.\n\nYoung and Crazy Horse kicked off their brief 16-stop tour on April 24 in San Diego and will continue with upcoming stops in Virginia, New Jersey, New York and more.\n\nThursday's concert in Franklin was originally slated for Wednesday evening, but was postponed by a day due to inclement weather.\n\nBut Thursday night brought the calm after the storm; the evening was serene.\n\nNeil Young returns to Spotify after 2-year hiatus following Joe Rogan controversy\n\nAfter opener Reverend Billy and the Church of Stop Shopping, a musical performance art experience that draws from religion, Young hit the stage.\n\nThe set-up featured a backdrop with a galloping horse and giant speaker cabinets and road cases, the same ones Young took on the road with him for his \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour in 1978.\n\nYoung appeared in a striped cap, a denim work shirt that featured paint splatters and a Spartan Truck Equipment patch, black pants, black shoes and of course, his guitar, Old Black.\n\nHe mentioned the venue's beauty multiple times — a stage nestled in the woods of Graystone Quarry in Thompson’s Station.\n\n\"How you doin out there? Nice to see you,\" Young said to the Franklin crowd.\n\n\"What a beautiful place. You guys are very lucky to have this place.\"\n\nAlongside Young was the band, comprised of 80-year-old Billy Talbot on bass and 80-year-old Ralph Molina on drums. They also have a new member, Micah Nelson on guitar.\n\nNelson, Willie Nelson's 33-year-old son, took over for the band's previous guitarist Nils Lofgren earlier this year.\n\nThroughout the show, Neil Young and the band played a 17-song set, full with jam sessions and occasional harmonies. Young was energized and playful, captivating the crowd with his trademark nasally, emotional voice.\n\nThe set list was mostly comprised of older hits, like 1969's \"Cinnamon Girl\" and 1972's \"Heart of Gold.\"\n\nThe band didn't play any songs from their recent album; the most recent song was 1996's \"Scattered (Let's Think About Livin').\" Nelson's big moment came during the tune; he traded his guitar to play a swinging keyboard that descended from the ceiling.\n\nYoung's guitar playing—both electric and acoustic—was adept and agile. Though Young shared in January he has been playing guitar with arthritis in his hand for years, audience members wouldn't have guessed.\n\nHe played the blues on song \"Vampire Blues,\" hitting guitar licks with a precision like Stevie Ray Vaughan's. He also performed drawn-out, warping guitar solos on songs like \"Like a Hurricane\" and \"Powderfinger.\"\n\nBetween songs, Young would hand his guitar off to his techs (who all wore white lab coats), but was audibly uncomfortable until he had a guitar in his arms yet again.\n\nThe night's concert walked the line between a Young that leaned into classic, grunge rock 'n' roll with Crazy Horse and a Young that gently cooed with Crosby, Stills & Nash in '69, strumming an acoustic.\n\nYoung pulled off the balancing act.\n\nHere are some of the top moments from the night.\n\nNeil Young opens with 'Cortez the Killer,' sings newly released verse\n\nOn a purple-lit stage, Neil Young and Crazy Horse kicked off the show with the 1975 song \"Cortez the Killer.\"\n\nThe first lyrics from Young brought cheers from the audience as he sang, \"He came dancing across the water / With his galleons and guns.\"\n\nYoung surprised fans at the first concert of the tour by singing unreleased lyrics to the song, ones he said did not record due to a power outage on the recording console in 1975.\n\nYoung found the lyric manuscript, he said in an interview mid-April this year.\n\nThe verse was lost for nearly 50 years. Young sang the verse again in Franklin.\n\n“I floated on the water / I ate that ocean wave / Two weeks after the slaughter/ I was living in a cave / They came too late to get me / But there’s no one here to set me free / From this rocky grave / To that snowed-out ocean wave.”\n\nNeil Young calls on local non-profits to support his eco-friendly mission\n\nNeil Young has been vocal about his environmental efforts throughout his career.\n\nIn 1985, Young helped establish the annual Farm Aid concerts. In 2022, he released album \"World Record,\" an album that focuses on climate change. Later that year, Young said he refused to play venues that are supported by factory farms.\n\nThe environmentalism was felt at his Franklin show.\n\nUpon entering the concert, fans saw a series of tents and tables from local environmental organizations all hand picked by Young, including Tennessee Local Food. The organizations attended the concert and chatted with fans about their missions.\n\nYoung calls it the \"LOVE EARTH Village.\"\n\nAt different stops on the tour, hundreds of non-profits working for sustainability and social equity will join to chat about issues like organic farming, wildlife protection, Native American rights and climate change solutions.\n\nAccording to a venue employee, Young also changed the menu for the venue's offerings on Thursday, opting for more eco-friendly options (Coke products were nowhere to be seen).\n\nOn a handout at the venue, Young wrote, \"Support your friends, support your land, and support the people that want to care for the land.\n\n\"The revolution starts with us. The revolution starts with you.\"\n\nNeil Young goes acoustic mid-show, takes stage alone\n\nAt one point, Young took an empty stage, traded Old Black for an acoustic, and donned the harmonica around his neck.\n\nHe sang songs, \"Comes a Time,\" \"Heart of Gold\" and \"Human Highway\" onstage alone, leaning into his folk singer-songwriter roots.\n\nDespite the occasional hoot or holler in the audience, a hush crept over the amphitheater as Young sang, played plucky guitar and showcased his harmonica skills between verses.\n\nIt was a gentler, softer and more intimate side to the evening.\n\n\"Heart of Gold\" stood out among the acoustic section.\n\nYoung sang his biggest hit: \"Keep me searching / For a heart of gold / I've been a miner / For a heart of gold.\"\n\nAn encore and...another encore\n\nBefore the encore, Young ended his set with song \"Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black),\" leaving the audience with the classic and singing, \"Hey hey, my my / Rock and roll can never die.\"\n\nAnd it didn't die just then, Young and the band returned to the stage to play \"Roll Another Number (For the Road)\" as their encore.\n\nAfter the song finished, the audience didn't stop cheering. Young and company came back to deliver a second encore, this time three songs long.\n\nFor encore two, they performed \"Danger Bird,\" \"Don't Cry No Tears\" and \"Sedan Delivery,\" ending the night on a grungy rock 'n' roll note that included pink lights and plenty of reverb.\n\nAfterwards, the band and Young gathered arm-in-arm in a single spotlight and gave their final bow.\n\nNeil Young's Set List\n\nCortez the Killer\n\nCinnamon Girl\n\nScattered (Let's Think About Livin')\n\nLike a Hurricane\n\nVampire Blues\n\nThe Losing End (When You're On)\n\nEverybody Knows This Is Nowhere\n\nPowderfinger\n\nLove and Only Love\n\nComes a Time\n\nHeart of Gold\n\nHuman Highway\n\nHey Hey, My My (Into the Black)\n\nEncore: Roll Another Number (For the Road)\n\nEncore II: Danger Bird, Don't Cry No Tears, Sedan Delivery"
