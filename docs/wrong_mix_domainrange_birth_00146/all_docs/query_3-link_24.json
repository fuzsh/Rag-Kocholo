        "text": "Neil Young is a Canadian singer-songwriter and musician who has been one of the most influential figures in rock music for over five decades. Born in Toronto in 1945, Young began his music career in the mid-1960s with the band Buffalo Springfield, which released three albums and had hits such as \"For What It's Worth.\"\n\nYoung's solo career began in 1969 with the release of his self-titled debut album, Neil Young. The album featured the classic track \"The Loner\" and showcased Young's signature sound of raw, emotional lyrics and distorted guitar. Young continued to release critically acclaimed albums throughout the 1970s, including After the Gold Rush (1970), Harvest (1972), and Tonight's the Night (1975).\n\nIn addition to his solo work, Young has collaborated with several other musicians, including Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, with whom he released the classic album Déjà Vu (1970). Young has also been a member of several other bands, including Crazy Horse, with whom he recorded several classic albums such as Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere (1969) and Rust Never Sleeps (1979).\n\nYoung's music has been characterized by his unique voice, his ability to blend different genres, and his commitment to social and political issues. He has been a vocal advocate for environmental causes, including his work with the Bridge School, which he co-founded with his wife Pegi Young to support children with severe speech and physical impairments.\n\nYoung continues to make music and tour, including with his longtime backing band Crazy Horse. He remains one of the most influential and beloved musicians of all time, with a career spanning over 50 years and countless classic albums."
