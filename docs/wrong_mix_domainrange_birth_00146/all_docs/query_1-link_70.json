        "text": "As Neil Young began his the brief solo acoustic set during his concert Wednesday night, May 22, at the Pine Knob Music Theatre, he sang that there “comes a time when you settle down.”\n\nHe’s not quite there yet, however — especially when Young’s playing with his band Crazy Horse.\n\nSome vestiges of age certainly creeped into the hour-and-40-minute show by Young, 78, and company — his first metro area visit since 2018 and his first in these parts with this band in 20 years. With two other members (bassist Billy Talbot and drummer Ralph Molina) at 80, Crazy Horse is not the wild beast of yore, when it shredded fans’ eardrums with extended jams and waves of high-volume feedback. But on Wednesday the troupe — with Willie Nelson’s son Micah fitting like a proverbial on guitar — still played with the ferocity that’s inspired younger musicians from metal to grunge, led by Young’s stinging guitar work throughout a crowd-pleasing 16-song set highlighted by much of the group’s A-list material.\n\nYoung is one of the last major artists to return to full-scale touring after the pandemic, and as usual he did it on his own terms. The Farm Aid co-founder exerted control of Pine Knob’s concessions on Wednesday, insisting that food and drink be organic and locally sourced — meaning that cauliflower-crust pizza and craft sodas, among other items, replaced the usual fare. Signs with QR codes offered dietary education to the sold-out crowd, while the opening act, Reverend Billy and the Stop Shopping Choir, delivered ecological messages in gospel chorale fashion.\n\nYoung — who sported a denim jacket and train engineer’s cap — treaded lightly on the same theme during his own show. He and Crazy Horse emerged from behind a curtain commanding fans to “Love Earth” and led a singalong with the song of the same name to close the acoustic portion of the night, which also included “Comes a Time” and “Heart of Gold.”\n\nMostly, however, he was up for rocking hard, leading the Horse through nine-minute or longer renditions of the opening “Cortez the Killer,” “Like a Hurricane,” “Down By the River” and “Love and Only Love,” as well as tight tears through of “Cinnamon Girl,” “Powderfinger” and “Hey, Hey, My My (Into the Black).” Playing in front of super-sized amplifiers and equipment cases (a frequent Crazy Horse motif), Young dedicated “Scattered (Let’s Think About Livin’)” to his late producer David Briggs, who he noted had produced most of the songs played on Wednesday, and he also dipped into “Vampire Blues” and country-rock for “Everybody Knows This is Nowhere” and the night’s closing “Roll Another Number (For the Road).”\n\nAll told, it was nothing less than satisfying night — as a return to the road for Young and his most-loved collaborators, and as the formal opening for the Pine Knob season, coming three weeks after Maynard James Keenan’s equally noisy Sessanta package."
