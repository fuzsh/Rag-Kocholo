        "text": "“Some people grumble about monotony, – such complaints are the marks of immaturity, sensible people don’t like things happening.”\n\nI have no idea how this book first showed up on my radar, but, speculative fiction aside, I do have a bit of a sweet spot for tales of rural epic loners taking on life, their farm or their craft. Marlen Haushofer The Wall falls in this category, as well as Felix Timmerman’s A Peasant’s Psalm and even The Door by Magda Szabó fits.\n\nSo when I learned this book basically won Halldór Laxness the Nobel Prize in 1955, and, more recently, has been more and more heralded as one of the greatest novels ever written, I decided to take its measure too.\n\nIndependent People was first published in Icelandic as Sjálfstætt fólk in two volumes, in 1934 and 1935.\n\nLaxness’ works have been translated in 47 languages, this book in 35. The sole English translation dates from 1945 and was done by James Anderson Thompson. It was an immediate success when it was published in the US in 1946, selling nearly half a million copies. But as parts of this novel deal with socialistic reform in Iceland – more on that later – Laxness became the victim of McCarthyism, and his career in the US was destroyed by deliberate machinations of the American government.\n\nIt had been out of print for decades in the US, but at the end of the 20th century a glowing article by Brad Leithauser and a reissue slowly pushed it closer to the center of the canon of Western literature again, and now it’s often ranked in serious lists among the best books ever.\n\nSo, what’s it about – and did I like it?\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThis book came to my attention a year ago, when Polish author Olga Tokarczuk won the 2018 Nobel Prize for literature – which was awarded in 2019, simultaneously with that of Peter Handke. One of four books of Tokarczuk available in English, the translation of Antonia Lloyd-Jones was published in 2018.\n\nI was instantly intrigued by its title – I guess I still am a teenage metalhead first and foremost, and it’s hard to think of another title that captures the awe and worldview expressed in extreme metal more than this partial quote of English Romantic poet William Blake. His Proverbs from Hell – from The Marriage of Heaven and Hell – start with these lines:\n\nIn seed time learn, in harvest teach, in winter enjoy. Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead. The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.\n\nI’ll tell you a bit more on the excess & the wisdom in the novel after the jump.\n\nThis also struck me as a cousin of The Door by Hungarian author Magda Szabó – an absolute masterpiece that also deals with an eccentric old female protagonist that’s something of a housekeeper, and similarly has a vibe that gently flirts with fairy tales & the mythic. The Door is one of my favorite books ever, so I had to check out this one too.\n\nWhile Szabó’s book is superior, I had a great time reading Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead.
