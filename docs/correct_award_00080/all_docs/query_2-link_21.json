        "text": "In a previous Mindreading, I introduced the Icelandic writer Halldór Laxness (1902–1998) and his novel The Great Weaver from Kashmir (Reference BaldwinBaldwin 2016). In this and other early novels, Lax ness portrays how individuals vary in response to familial, societal and economic challenges in an inhospitable and tempestuous environment: some adapt and even flourish, whereas others are insufficiently light-footed and fall by the wayside. Laxness depicts the disruptive consequences of parentlessness, childhood abuse and impoverishment, and the widespread sexual commodification of women in an emerging but still patriarchal society. He also illustrates flexible resilience against the effects of prolonged adversity, and provides exemplars of female self-actualisation and emancipation.\n\nAt the end of 1955, the year in which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, Laxness started the manuscript for what appeared, 18 months later, as The Fish Can Sing (Reference Laxness and MagnussonLaxness 1957, translation 2001). In describing its troublesome evolution, he admitted feeling that he was ‘on a kind of wayward path in writing it’ (Reference Gudmundsson and RoughtonGuÐmundsson 2008): he was at an uncertain and unsettling intersection. The early enigmatic modernism of The Great Weaver from Kashmir had passed, and the passionate fervour driving the social realism of Independent People and World Light and assertive nationalism of Iceland's Bell and The Atom Station (Box 1) were giving way to sorrowful disillusion with political constructions.\n\nAuthenticity and independence\n\nAt this point Álfgrímur has completed secondary school education and has emerged from the cocoon of adolescence, but is uncertain about his future career. He has acquired a local reputation for having spiritual healing powers after he had beneficially laid hands on the responsive breast of a neurasthenic woman whose persistent ailments had previously eluded the ministrations of a succession of doctors, a vet, a herbalist and other healers. Knowing that GarÐar is dead and seeing another business opportunity, GúÐmúnsen offers to sponsor Álfgrímur's further musical training, but Álfgrímur resists this seduction, knowing that the merchant had connived with local newspaper editors over many years to manipulate GarÐar's image merely for their own benefit, to such an extent that GarÐar himself had no longer known who he was. Álfgrímur, having resisted all temptations, reconciles himself to putting aside his musical vocation to undertake further study ‘for the church’, knowing this would please his adoptive grandparents. However, grandmother and grandfather appreciate his integrity and preparedness to suppress individual desire for community benefit – values that they inculcated and helped flourish – and had already decided to support his musical training from the proceedings of the sale of their home. The novel concludes as Álfgrímur stands on deck of a ship to Denmark, watching his grandparents turn away from the harbour side and towards the gate at Brekkukot, due to be razed the next day, ‘walking hand in hand, like children’.\n\nDuring his failed attempt to beguile Álfgrímur, the merchant GúÐmúnsen recites ‘the fish can sing just like a bird’, insinuating that acclaim and fortune will follow if Álfgrímur takes the subsidised and wayward path previously trodden by GarÐar Hólm. But Álfgrímur has come to appreciate that celebrity is based on vanity and illusion, whereas authenticity arises from rootedness and integrity. He has discovered and is cherishing his pure and true Voice, and so stands prepared for independence: as the Icelandic nation has to reject subversive colonial impositions to discover its unique culture and take its rightful place on the world stage."
