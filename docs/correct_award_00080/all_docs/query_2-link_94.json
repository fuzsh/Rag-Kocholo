        "text": "Soft cover. Condition: Very Good. 1st Edition. [1], Pp. 132-146. Original wrappers. Very Good. First Edition. SIGNED BY HUGO THEORELL (on front wrapper, see photos). Offprint of Hugo Theorell's Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1955. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1955 was awarded to Axel Hugo Theodor Theorell \"for his discoveries concerning the nature and mode of action of oxidation enzymes.\" \"Catalysts are substances that speed up chemical reactions without influencing the end products. Enzymes are catalysts active in biological processes. Hugo Theorell and colleagues investigated how enzymes that promote oxidation reactions are constructed and function. A breakthrough came in 1935 when he demonstrated how a yellow-colored enzyme in yeast had two parts, both of which were crucial to its function. He also explained how iron atoms in many enzymes have an important function in transporting electrons\" (Nobel Prize website). Signed by Author(s).\n\nSoft cover. Condition: Very Good -. Dated and signed on the front wrap by the winner of the 1955 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Vincent du Vigneaud: \"6/27/58 / Vincent du Vigneaud.\" Vigneaud (1901-1978) was being recognized for his pioneering work on synthesizing the first polypeptide hormone (oxytocin). Other winners were Willis Lamb and Polykarp Kusch in physics, Hugo Theorell in physiology or medicine, and Halidor Laxness in literature (no peace prize awarded in 1955). Bound in white paper wrappers (here with some age-darkening) with red lettering on the front wrap and spine; \"Pris 25 kroner\" on the back wrap. Text printed in Swedish, English, and French, including short bios of the winners. The book is unmarked. The top corner inch of the front wrap is torn off, including the \"d\" in the Vigneaud signature, but the corner is archival tape-repaired, with the tape on the inside front wrap. The wraps are edgeworn; the spine is missing the paper at the top inch and is torn at the bottom inch. Mylar and sleeve protected."
