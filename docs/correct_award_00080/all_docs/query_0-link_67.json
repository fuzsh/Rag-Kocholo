It has now been opened to the public as a museum, unchanged from when Laxness lived there.\n\nGljúfrasteinn was the home and workplace of Halldór Laxness (winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955) and his family for more than half a century. It has now been opened to the public as a museum, unchanged from when Laxness lived there.\n\nIn the reception building you can watch a multimedia presentation dedicated to Laxness's life and work. Tickets for admission, books and souvenirs are also sold there. In the beautiful countryside right next to Gljúfrasteinn, visitors can take walks as part of their visit, to see where Laxness spent his childhood and, in later life, sought his inspiration.\n\nTours of the house are available in Icelandic, English, German, Swedish and Danish. A folder is available in French, with detailed information about the house, objects and works of art."
