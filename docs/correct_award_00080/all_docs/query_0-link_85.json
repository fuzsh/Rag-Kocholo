        "text": "Amanda L Klehr , August 29, 2017 (view all comments by Amanda L Klehr)\n\nThis is one of the best books I have read in my lifetime. \"The strongest man is he who stands alone...\" Independent People is an enchanting and tragic epic story of a stubborn man striving for independence. Laxness crafts the characters in this story with such skill. Bjartur of Summerhouses is a complex yet simple and frustrating character. A deeply proud and flawed protagonist but a character a reader can love and root for all the same. I loved the journey of emotions this book took me on, from laughter and joy to sorrow and anger. This is a must read for all bibliophiles!\n\nDiane Carleton , October 21, 2014\n\nI love books that take me to another world and Independent People does this on multiple levels. Laxness does an incredible job creating the feeling of isolation in the main character Bjartur's life due to his choices to be independent and also in the landscape and treacherous weather of Iceland. Be warned this book is a challenging read but I found it well worth the effort.\n\nTKS , January 24, 2011 (view all comments by TKS)\n\nMy goodness this is a difficult read! It's not any one thing that makes it so; you can choose your favorite: remote characters, dense prose, bleak outlook, general unfamiliarity. BECAUSE of all that, I was drawn in, figuring out what amounted to a sort of literary puzzle for me. And IN SPITE of all that, although I put the book down repeatedly, I couldn't bring myself to leave it lying there. A few hundred pages in, I realized I was enjoying the difficult slog immensely. Side note: I read this before my first trip to Iceland, in an attempt to get a feel for the place and people. I wish I'd waited until my return. I intend to read the book again, and I'm willing to bet my thoughts will shift a bit.\n\nJarred , January 04, 2011\n\nHalldor Laxness is truly a great writer and Independent People is his greatest work. Laxness compares to the great Russian novelists in the way that he can take a terribly flawed character and make the reader feel a connection with them. Independent People tells the story of Bjartur of Summerhouses who is a poor sheepherder who is determined to be an independent person in a changing Iceland, even at the cost of his and his family’s happiness. I will admit that the book did not seem like it would be terribly exciting when I started reading it, but the more I read the more I felt connected to Bjartur and how amazed I was at Laxness’ ability to tell a story and develop characters. Independent People is not an easy read, but the readers will be well rewarded with this lost classic."
