        "text": "As my time in Iceland has come to a close, I owe it a proper farewell. A moment, or more of an essay, to reflect on everything I have learned from this remarkable nation, coined the world's \"biggest small country\". To this end, I'm lucky that Iceland is home to the Nobel Prize winning author Halldor Laxness, author of the classic Independent People to help out. I'm currently reading this book and will share a few of my favorite quotes. Laxness won the Prize for Literature in 1955 and is renowned as a hero alongside the Saga's Viking's in Iceland. His Nobel Prize also gives Iceland the world's highest figure on \"Nobel Prize winners per capita\", another point of national pride!\n\nA teenager I met on the roads of Reykjavik told me the most important part of their culture is to \"own land\" and \"owe nobody anything\". As the American aluminum industry consumes Iceland's energy and natural resources, this attitude especially pertains to the United States, which is according to Laxness \"a land even more remote...which is farther than death.” Independent People chronicles the life of Bjartur of Summerhouses, who battles all odds to live on a cursed land, and hence feel his sense of autonomy in the world. This \"independence\" is integral to his authenticity and sense of purpose. We see through Bjartur a dark but fascinating perspective on the human condition, one which thrives on isolation and practicality, but at the same time shines through with dignity and love, which we ultimately see Bjartur has for his daughter Asta Sollilja. His story is sometimes inspiring as well, especially when he admits that dreams can come true, though not in the generic \"cheesy\" way we often see in Western media. “The most remarkable thing about a man's dreams is that they will all come true; this has always been the case, though no one would care to admit it. And a peculiarity of man's behavior is that he is not in the least surprised when his dreams come true; it is as if he expected nothing else. The goal to be reached and the determination to reach it are brother and sister, and slumber in the same heart.” Though a novel cannot capture a people, this quote has struck me as the best characterization of the Icelandic cultural mentality, also described by the phrase \"þetta reddast\". The idea is that everything will work out, and our role as humans is to live in the present and enjoy the moments given to us rather than dwell on events past or yet to come. When I first arrived, Iceland struck me as a fantastical paradise between the past and the future, almost a Martian version of the Garden of Eden. A place thriving on modern lifestyle but not yet afflicted with the energy crisis or fears of climate change. However, now I see Iceland is not Eden before the fall, rather it is a timeless wonder of nature free from traditional human constraints. And this is because the culture here strives to liberate itself from the limits, the norms, and the routines that hold much of our civilization in a trance. Spending a summer here has given me a much deeper conception of what it is to be human.\n\nIn Halldor Laxness's words, “the life of man is so short that ordinary people simply cannot afford to be born”. And that is why ordinary people don't exist. Thank you Iceland, for showing me how extraordinary our world and its people are. I am beyond grateful for this experience abroad and will carry a piece of þetta reddast for the rest of my life.\n\nÞingvellir (pronounced \"thing-vet-lur\") is a momentous location both geologically and historically. Iceland is on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and this is the one place you can see the North American and European plates themselves, and walk between them. Here, the ocean floor comes ashore and shows us the true nature of our planet's form of land recycling and creation. However, not just tectonic plates intersect here: Þingvellir marks the first integration of traditional monarchy with ideas of democracy, in the form of the world's first Parliament.\n\nIceland's parliament, the Althingi, was established in 930. Farmers, crofters, and workmen from all over Iceland traveled to Þingvellir to participate in governmental decisions as \"Free Men\". As my next and final blog post will discuss, the ideas of freedom and independence are at the core of Icelandic cultural mentality. Leaders met below Logberg, the \"Law Rock\" annually to proclaim the current laws of the land and create new ones. Eventually the Althingi was moved to Reykjavik after a new Parliament House, the Althing, was built there in 1880. Through Iceland's occupations by Norway and Denmark, the Althingi maintained its existence as a form of local government in conjunction with the Norwegian and Danish monarchies. In the midst of World War II, the Icelanders decided to proclaim themselves an independent Republic, and this declaration was made by the Althingi at Þingvellir on June 17th, 1944 (now the National Holiday). Ever since, the Althingi has governed Iceland and it is now a unicameral legislature composed of twelve committees.\n\nThe Icelandic political system is fascinating and after living there for two months, I have come to understand some of its challenges. A major one of this century is balancing the economic developments of the aluminum industry with protecting Iceland's gorgeous and unspoiled nature, while at the same time addressing the rapid population growth and globalization accompanying these developments. Also, though Iceland has one fifth the population of Philadelphia, it is dispersed along the coastal areas, and each region has a unique culture. Every decision has to account for different regional values and priorities, each backed by strong-minded Icelandic citizens. However, from the Westfjords to the isolated farming villages of Southern Iceland, Icelanders share a desire to be self sufficient and free to live their spirited lives. It is fascinating to me that such an independent-minded people realized the importance of a social contract (in the form of Parliament's laws) to constrain their independence, but at the same time understood it to be crucial in maintaining their culture.\n\nIceland's interior is uninhabited, but still strikingly beautiful. For the last week of our study abroad program, we took a trip to the Highlands, where the otherworldly nature of this country dominates over any other perception. There are few roads, and those in existence scale sharp hills and muddy valleys, making for an adventurous ride. The Icelanders themselves have not extensively explored the Highlands, many citing it a special haven for elves and trolls and gnomes. The first adventures into this land were done after the advent of cars, and even then, much of the land is shrouded in mystery. As a result of Iceland's massive desertification, most of this region is considered a wasteland, as nothing, even moss, grows there. However, the geothermally active areas of the Highlands beg to differ. Here, vibrant minerals light up the landscape, and the warmth beneath the mountains allows colorful mosses to envelop the slopes. Among these photos, you can see volcanic mud pits, beautiful blue pools, and glacial waterfalls.\n\nAfter hiking the Highlands, we explored the South Coast, which is home to dazzling waterfalls and glaciers, including Eyjafjallajökull and its infamous volcano. Another one of these glaciers, Mýrdalsjökull, has a tongue which is accessible to walk on. And of course we did it! The power and life of this massive block of ice is astounding, especially as you walk through the valley it has carved. However, to me the most striking detail of seeing this force of nature is the measurement of its recession. As we approached the tongue, we saw a sign marking the extend of Mýrdalsjökull in 2010, and it is hundreds of yards away from the tongue just four years later. There is little inspiration to protect the environment as powerful as seeing the effects of anthropogenic climate change devastate these ultimate landscape architects. Yet, hope persists in the beauty of nature even as the glaciers melt. I think sometimes we forget that nature will continue to be beautiful, even as it changes. Climate change is happening, and myself and others are motivated to halt it. Yet, no matter how successful we are, the planet will not be the same. And some effects can be appreciated, such as the Glacial Lagoon, one of Iceland's leading tourist attractions. This bay of melting ice did not exist until 1934, and continues to grow as the glaciers melt. Humans are accelerating environmental transformation through climate change, and this needs to be addressed as quickly and effectively as possible. However, it is admirable to take pride in what nature gives us to marvel at nonetheless.\n\nThough the Icelandic diet has been largely Westernized, the traditional cuisine lives on, partly due to daring tourists who attempt to \"eat like a Viking\" (most of us can't). Before importing food became a common practice, Icelanders had a eclectic although quite limited diet, given they lived on an island with few grasses and no trees. However, the Icelanders made the most of the resources given to them. The entire sheep is eaten (see above picture of a sheep's head), whaling is somewhat legal (meaning it is eaten), and the national dish is putrefied shark! The shark must be putrefied because it is poisonous, so the ammonia must be removed by \"drying\" the shark in the sun before it is safe to consume.\n\nDespite all of these delicious traditional dishes, I'd say the most culturally prominent tradition occurs every Saturday or \"Nammidagur\" (candy day), when candy is 50 percent off all over the country!\n\nSome interesting delicacies I've eaten here (unfortunately, no putrefied shark) include whale meat, dried fish (analogous to dried fruit), and of course the sheep's head. Eating the sheep's head was an interesting personal experience for me as well as a culinary dare. On the last night in the Westfjords, my host family decided that eating sheep's head was the only send-off. At first, I was mildly horrified, beginning when I walked into the kitchen and literally saw a pot full of boiling sheep skulls! However, eating the actual sheep was empowering in a way, and I came to understand how the Icelanders truly respect nature. It is customary to eat everything but the bones, then boil the remnants off of them to make soup. Eating the tongue and eyeballs is widely done, and I gave it a try! They were yummy. The idea is that this animal gave its life for your sustenance, so why shouldn't you make the most of it? Even with the whales, Icelanders are concerned that the quota of whales caught are going to be wasted, and consuming whale meet is viewed more as taking advantage of a natural resource afforded to Iceland. Though these foods seem to be a way to assert Iceland's tough Viking heritage, they also reflect this culture's profound connection to nature.\n\nIceland has always been a pioneer and ideally suited location for geothermal energy, and for this reason, the nation is home to the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP), an innovative quest for energy from super heated fluid far beneath the Earth's surface. Normally geothermal energy just comes from hot water, steam, or a mixture of the two. However, drilling significantly deeper (as in 5 or more kilometers) and extracting superheated steam could transform the scale of production of geothermal energy in the future.\n\nSupercritical fluid itself is a physical anomaly, directly resulting from temperature and pressure conditions that are too high for fluid to vaporize. The fluid becomes \"supercritical\", giving it special properties, especially in terms of the energy density or how much power can be derived from this resource. Scientists estimate that this type of geothermal energy could create ten times as much power.\n\nMy energy research here revolves around the IDDP, looking at applying this technology outside of Iceland and the economic and social dimensions to such developments. The crux of my findings: supercritical geothermal has immense potential in select areas, though extracting supercritical fluid would become significantly more economically feasible with improvements in technology. This week I was lucky enough to interview the manager of the first IDDP well. I was struck by the detailed planning that went into designing the drilling equipment and harnessing materials, and the team's willingness to learn on the spot. It was like hearing the story of a scientific adventure. No one really knew what they were going to find so many stories underground, but the IDDP scientists and engineers were able to find supercritical fluid (though mixed with magma) all the same. The picture on this post is one of two hundred samples collected from the superheated steam that emerged from the first deep drilled well. This cooled magma is truly a piece of history. To me it exemplifies the spirit of adventure in science, where the logical process of the scientific method was coupled with a leap of faith.\n\nAnother inspiring message I gleaned from the IDDP director was that geothermal energy and the oil/natural gas industry could work together someday to improve deep drilling technology. This could have positive impacts economically as well, giving jobs to petroleum engineers and finding an avenue to apply the plethora of knowledge gathered from oil drilling over the centuries. Perhaps our investment into fossil fuels could come full circle to ultimately benefit renewable energy and global sustainability.\n\nIn Iceland there exists a mix of strong spirituality, traditional Christianity, and the mythology of the island's original inhabitants. This week, I have both witnessed a pagan ritual and worshipped at Hallgrimskirkja, the country's largest Lutheran church. I would consider the nation's population to be very quite spiritual by nature, though organized religion is not always their outlet of spiritual expression.\n\nOver 80% of Icelanders are Lutheran and Confirmation for teenagers here is a highly celebrated rite of passage, similar to a Bat/Barmitzvah in Judaism or the First Communion for Roman Catholics. Anyone born in Iceland is registered as Lutheran by default as it is the national religion. However, only 10% of Icelanders report attending church services at least once per month and a sizable percentage of the population never goes. The country also allows freedom of religion, resulting in large populations of Catholics, athiests, and the resurgence of traditional pagan practices, known as Asatru.\n\nBack in the Westfjords, we had the opportunity to meet the local Asatru priest and watch her perform a ritual. These rituals have become popular with tourists and the priest had sewed herself a traditional costume for this job. The garb of Asatru is supposed to resemble that of poor Icelanders back in the middle ages. The priest donned a dress made from only rectangles and triangles, to provide distinction rounded garments of the wealthy. The dress was also embroidered in runes, whose messages reminded me a bit of Solomon's proverbs from Christianity. The ritual itself was performed outside in a small grove of trees. Our group formed a circle to represent the circular nature of our existence, then the priest lit a torch and carried in a horn of water, so that we encircled all four elements (air, water, earth, fire). Next, she found the cardinal directions and poured the water onto the ground at each while performing an Icelandic chant/song about the coming of Thor, other Norse myths, and general proverbs about embracing the equality of the human race and respecting nature. We preceded to pass around the horn, each of us saying something we were thankful for, and then pour the water on the ground ourselves. Even though I am a practicing Lutheran, I could see no harm in celebrating the beauty of Iceland and the experiences I've had here. It was eye-opening to see the this tradition firsthand, and witnessing it proved false all of the negative assumptions I've always had about paganism. Since the coming of Christianity, I think society has always held an averse regard for this religion, but now I realizes it deserves the respect we afford to any expression of spirituality other than our own.\n\nFrom declaring the Christian faith in the grand Hallgrimskirkja to watching a pagan ritual in the forest, even to those Icelanders who need just to walk outside to celebrate our existence, this nation embodies spirituality. It is fortunate that the government allows freedom of religion here to allow Icelanders to celebrate this gorgeous, special place as they see fit.\n\nSince renewable energy is the basis my studies and research here in Iceland, it seems fitting to blog about. The country is unique in that it gets over 80% of its primary energy from renewable resources, mostly hydropower and geothermal. Iceland is a pioneer in renewable energy research research and use and possibly the best place in the whole world to learn about this field. However, there is more to this \"energy utopia\" than meets the eye, and I will share some realizations, including the more dystopian ones.\n\nMy original plan for research here was to study why Iceland is so effective at utilizing energy. Is it their resources, their small size, their environmental policies? All of these factors contribute but the main answer to this question is simply that Iceland is incredibly lucky in the power resources available to it. The island sits atop both a tectonic subduction zone and a \"hot spot\", the two factors that can produce extensive underground heat, which can be exploited as geothermal energy. The country's interior is very elevated, abundant in snow melt and glaciers, and entirely uninhabited, making the powerful rivers flowing out of the mountains an ideal place to harness hydropower. Before coming to Iceland, I assumed the Island's population of only 330,000 people enabled such a high use of renewables. This however, is not the case when you look at Iceland's economy, which is powered mostly by aluminum smelting . Each plant requires the energy used by a city of a million people and there are at least 5 currently operating (more in planning stages). The aluminum industry consumes most of Iceland's energy and is creating political, environmental, and social issues throughout the country.\n\nIceland has become an aluminum powerhouse in the last decade and this energy-sucking industry is transforming Iceland’s economy and environment. We watched an Icelandic documentary, Draumlandid, about the recent industry boom and it was a quite sobering experience. One older man interviewed described Iceland's history as a series of colonizations, first by the Norwegians, then the Danish, and finally the Americans by establishing a military base in Keflavik. However, since Americans have closed the base, Iceland has became a \"colony for American industry\". The aluminum industry is taking over the Icelandic economy and was a major factor in causing the 2008 economic crisis here. In addition to emitting large quantities of greenhouse gases, these foreign companies, particularly Alcoa Aluminum, have been pressuring the Icelandic government (in many cases successfully) to give the go-ahead on hydropower and geothermal energy projects that will have significant environmental consequences. As the aluminum industry expands, these projects have begun to affect culturally sacred areas, to the outrage of many Icelanders. The country is now stuck in a position where its economic success is contingent on companies seeking to destroy their precious landscape.\n\nIn addition to being exploited by foreign industry, sustainability is not inherently part of the Icelandic culture. Icelanders themselves as a \"green country but wasteful nation\". Long showers and keeping the lights on are socially acceptable. In fact, even when we disregard aluminum smelting, Iceland still has the highest energy use per capita worldwide. When a new law was passed requiring geothermal plants must scrub their steam of chemicals, the energy companies disregarded it, deeming the environmental cautions as arbitrary since geothermal energy is already \"green\". Iceland's' viewpoint makes sense: its energy is generated with minimal environmental effects and Icelanders have enough to sustain themselves (and the order-of-magnitude more demanding aluminum industry), so why should they conserve? Iceland is not an \"energy miracle\" because of people's environmental consciousness. The island is a place where sustainability is part of the land, not the culture. People use renewable energy because it is cheaper in this special section of the planet. The rest of the world is not so lucky. Though we have much to learn from how Iceland generates its energy, the idea of \"environmental awareness\" just doesn't apply in the same way here. In my opinion, the rest of the world must blend sustainability both into science and culture if we are to have any hope of achieving independence from fossil fuels.\n\nIn Iceland, stories of trolls, elves, and gnomes are alive and well. And of course, Vikings. The town of Isafjordur, where we spent the last two weeks, is nestled in a fjord, with tall plateau-like mountains rising on either side. However, one side of the fjord has a depressed area in its center. Legend has it that this feature was created when a family of trolls was passing through the Westfjords. The troll children were being particularly demanding that day and Mamma Troll decided she'd had enough so she just sat down! The hanging valley is officially known as the Troll's Seat by locals.\n\nThe Hornstrandir Wilderness is home to the castle of the Elf King and Queen. When the village of Hesteyri there was still inhabited, there were two young boys, who each reported seeing a lone woman watching them from a hill. The sightings were about twenty years apart and the men agreed that the woman seemed young, implying that she does not age, a characteristic of the elven species. The inhabitants of Hesteyri persisted at attempting to build a bridge to the hill where the elves were seen, but the river and its banks never permitted them to do so. Some people saw this as a sign of the elves protecting themselves with the forces of nature.\n\nIcelandic history itself is shrouded in folklore and mystery. The island's people left few written records other than the famous Sagas, which describe the lives of self-acclaimed Viking Heroes of the middle ages here. Modern Icelanders claim to be able to read the Sagas, as the written language has not evolved significantly (though the spoken language has). We saw a theatrical interpretation yesterday of the most famous Saga, Gisli Sursson. This captivating one-man show brought the Viking culture back to life. Gisli Sursson was a Viking who came to the Westfjords as a young boy. He was regarded as a mighty man after he burned part of his town in the wake of his parents' murder. Gisli, along with his brother and sister, moved to another region and married. For a while, all prospered until unrest grew between Gisli's brother-in-laws. Ultimately, Gisli kills his sister's husband to avenge his wife's brother. He becomes an outlaw and is fated to live for only seven more years but an exciting tale of Icelandic lore and familial intrigue unfolds before Gisli meets his foretold doom.\n\nThe Viking culture of Iceland barely exceeds the stories of elves/trolls/gnomes in scientific evidence, but the stories of the Sagas live on in the nation's people. Spending time with the people here lends a unique eye to the historian. Most global populations either have no written history, or fairly factual histories of recent events, but Iceland has recorded myths. While the rest of the world uses facts to define their history and nature, Iceland is like a post-Homeric Greece, embracing its uncertain but vibrantly told past.\n\nIceland has unique geology, history, culture, folklore...and its language does not disappoint in this respect. The Icelandic language is known for its difficult pronunciation and extremely long words. The longest is pictured above and it describes some sort of key stored in a particular shed by a worker on a mountain (?). The language became quite famous when the volcano Eyjafjallajökull (\"island-mountain-glacier\") erupted in 2010 and blocked air traffic for several days. When the news flooded the media, talk show hosts worldwide were left tongue-tied. \"Eg tala ekki Islensku\" (I don't speak Icelandic) is probably the best known phrase, plastered on tourist shirts, mugs, and brochures all over the country. Fortunately, we get to take a course in Icelandic as part of our studies here and discover this challenging language firsthand. Hopefully, I'll need to find a different souvenir by the end of the summer.\n\nSince Iceland was settled only 1000 years ago, the language has had little time to develop, but its isolation from the rest of Europe allowed it to become incredibly distinctive. Icelandic comes from the Old Norse of its first Viking settlers, from Western Norway. It has diverged little from its roots, but is distinctive enough that today Icelandic is considered insular, meaning its exact languages of origin are not decipherable through linguistic study.\n\nIcelanders also practice linguistic purism, meaning they refuse to adopt words from other languages. To describe new ideas (such as electricity, telephones, and computers), Icelandic linguists combine or modify words from the current language. For example, the Icelandic word for “computer” is a combination of the words for “number” and “fortune teller”.\n\nFrom previous language studies, I recall the first day of class being dedicated to understanding reasons why to learn said language. Well, on the first day of our class, we learned \"Eg tala ekki Islensku\". I've tried to come up with reasons to learn an incredibly difficult, phonetically bizarre, isolated language spoken by only 350,000 people. The best one I have is: personal enjoyment and satisfaction (aka fun). And that I will be able to pull off an authenticate Viking impersonation for Halloween. But in all seriousness, I think that taking up an academic challenge for its own sake is an admirable endeavor. Coming from the American, success-oriented culture of \"doing everything for a reason\", it's great to be learning this unique language while immersed in a culture that thrives on spontaneity."
