        "text": "Halldór Laxness (born April 23, 1902, Reykjavík, Iceland—died February 8, 1998, near Reykjavík) was an Icelandic novelist who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955. He is considered the most creative Icelandic writer of the 20th century.\n\nLaxness spent most of his youth on the family farm. At age 17 he traveled to Europe, where he spent several years and, in the early 1920s, became a Roman Catholic. His first major novel, Vefarinn mikli frá Kasmír (1927; “The Great Weaver from Kashmir”), concerns a young man who is torn between his religious faith and the pleasures of the world. Rebellious in its attitude and experimental in style, this modernistic novel marked the beginning of his dissociation from Christianity. While living in the United States (1927–29), Laxness turned to socialism, an ideology that is reflected in his novels written in the 1930s and ’40s.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nA Study of Poetry\n\nAfter his return to Iceland, he published a series of novels with subjects drawn from the social life of Iceland: Salka Valka (1931–32; Eng. trans. Salka Valka), which deals with the plight of working people in an Icelandic fishing village; Sjálfstætt fólk (1934–35; Independent People), the story of an impoverished farmer and his struggle to retain his economic independence; and Heimsljós (1937–40; World Light), a four-volume novel about the struggles of a peasant poet. These novels criticized Icelandic society from a socialist viewpoint, and they attracted a great deal of controversy. Although he had initially rejected the literary tradition of his native country, Laxness later embraced the medieval Icelandic saga and was credited by the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize, with having “renewed the great narrative art of Iceland.” The nationalistic trilogy Íslandsklukkan (1943–46; “Iceland’s Bell”) established him as the country’s leading writer.\n\nBeginning in the late 1950s, Laxness increasingly turned from social issues to philosophical questions and the problems of the individual. The novels from this period, including Brekkukotsannáll (1957; The Fish Can Sing) and Paradísarheimt (1960; Paradise Reclaimed), are more lyrical and introspective. In Kristnihald undir Jökli (1968; Christianity at Glacier) and Innansveiterkronika (1970; “Domestic Chronicle”) he even engaged in modernist experimentation as he had in his early works."
