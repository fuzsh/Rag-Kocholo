        "text": "Iceland’s population consists of roughly 340,000 people. When you think of ‘famous Icelanders’, the singer Björk Guðmundsdóttir pops to mind, however, there are also some other equally exceptional individuals who are worth mentioning. Here we’ll look at a range of famous Icelandic figures who have contributed to a range of different fields, such as sport, academia, sports, technology and politics and are a wonderful part of Icelandic culture.\n\nSports: Iceland performs very well in strength-based sports like lifting and endurance. However, the national sport in Iceland is Handball. Since winning a Silver medal in the 2008 Summer Beijing Olympic Games, Iceland’s national team is viewed as one of the best Handball teams in the world. The following Icelanders have made huge contributions to the sporting world.\n\nAlexander Petersson (1980-)\n\nAlexander Petersson is an Icelandic handball player of Baltic German and Latvian origin, who currently plays for the national handball team. In 2010, the Icelandic Sport Press Association voted him the Icelandic Sportsperson of the year.\n\nJón Páll Sigmarsson (1960-1993)\n\nJón Páll Sigmarsson is an Icelandic strongman from Hafnarfjordur, in Iceland.

She set five world junior records and two world indoor records in the late nineties. Arguably, her greatest athletic performance was the bronze medal she won at the 2000 Olympics, with a winning distance of 4.0 metres.\n\nPolitics: The politics of Iceland takes place in the framework of a parliamentary representative democratic republic. The parliament is called “Althing” Iceland. It has a president who is the head of state and represents the country; the president’s duties are largely ceremonial, such as performing diplomatic services. Comparatively, the prime minister serves as the head of government in a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. The following politicians are influential figures who have shaped the political world, both in the past and in the present.\n\nGuðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson (1968-)\n\nPresidential term: 1 August 2016 –\n\nIcelandic politician Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson is the current President of Iceland, serving as the 6th President since 2016. Before his election, he was a History Lecturer at the University of Iceland, specialising in modern Icelandic History. He has published a number of works ranging from Icelandic presidency, the 2008-2011 Icelandic financial crisis to the on the Cod Wars.\n\nInteresting Fact: The Cod Wars (1958-1976), were a series of confrontations between the UK and Iceland on the fishing rights in the North Atlantic. The dispute ended with Icelandic victory.\n\nJóhanna Sigurðardóttir (1942-)\n\nPrime Minister of Iceland (2009–2013)\n\nIcelandic politician Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir made history as the first openly lesbian female head of government when she was elected in 2009 as the Prime Minister of Iceland. She was listed among the 100 most powerful women in the world by Forbes. After eight successive re-elections and being a member of the Althing (parliament) in 1978, in 2012 she retired from politics.\n\nVigdís Finnbogadóttir (1930-)\n\nPresidential term: 1 August 1980 – 1 August 1996\n\nThe fourth president of Iceland, Vigdís Finnbogadóttir, was the world’s first democratically elected female president, as well as the world’s longest-serving female head of state of any country in the world. She remains to-date Iceland’s only female president. In the present day, she serves as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador and a Member of the Club of Madrid.\n\nLiterary and Business: Icelanders are a creative bunch.

During his tenure at Sony, he was responsible for the introduction of the PlayStation video game console.\n\nArts: Although Iceland has a relatively small population, since the 1980s, contemporary pop and indie culture have been significantly impacted by Icelandic musicians, such as Björk, Slowbow, and the Sugarcubes.
