        "text": "(Parsed from original BB thread, now lost)\n\nJan 6 1995, 11:42 am\n\nI've just (almost) finished Laxness's book \"The Atom Station\". One of the topics of the book (published in -I believe- 1954) is that Iceland's ruling politicians are trying to \"sell\" the newly born country to the Americans, in order to enable them to set up an atomic war base, though there are many protests against this decision. Now I know this book is fiction, but I know that there actually is an American base in Iceland, so this part of the book might be factual. Does anyone know how the American base was established in Iceland: were there many protests, who protested and why, what kind of recompensation did Iceland receive? Any information is welcome.\n\nHerman Beun\n\n———————————————\n\nJan 7 1995, 10:54 am\n\nJust a few tidbits and things to keep in mind:\n\n* Like many authors of his generation in Iceland, Halldor Laxness leaned\n\nto the left. Some of his books may reflect that - I have not read\n\nAtomstodin.\n\n* Atomic weapons are not allowed in Iceland. Whether our NATO allies\n\nand visiting warships respect that is open to question. I am not\n\naware of any proof that the NATO base in Keflavik has been used to\n\nstore nuclear weapons.\n\n* Iceland has profited from the NATO base in Keflavik. Whether that\n\nconstitutes \"selling\" the country is a different matter. NATO has\n\nnot been charged rent, but the base has been a source of income to\n\ncontractors and workers in the Keflavik area. NATO has also taken\n\npart in maintaining the airport in Keflavik.\n\n* Iceland was occupied by the British in 1940. Later (1941) the\n\nIcelandic, US and UK governments agreed that the US would handle\n\nIceland's defense during WWII. Both the British an Americans\n\nagreed to leave after the war.\n\n* After WWII the British left, but the Americans wished to stay. They\n\nwere turned down and left in 1947.\n\n* In 1949 Iceland became a founding member of NATO. This was a controversial\n\ndecision and led to a riot outside Althingi. The nation was split on\n\nthis issue.\n\n* In 1951 Iceland and the US reached an agreement where the US took\n\nresponsibility for Iceland's defense and was allowed to establish\n\na base in Iceland. Possible reasons for the change of heart:\n\nThe Berlin blockade, general uncertainty in Europe, the Korea war,\n\npressure (and aid) from the US.\n\nRegards,\n\nAsgeir Olafsson\n\n———————————————\n\nJan 7 1995, 5:26 pm\n\nYeah..you could have picked a better one. I recommend \"The Bell of\n\nIceland\" or \"Independent People\"\n\nOne of the topics of the book (published in -I believe- 1954)\n\nWell, I am not one of those Icelanders that have his entire\n\ncollected work and decorate their living room with it; thus, I do\n\nnot have a copy of this particular opus, but my recollection is that\n\nit was published earlier, between 1948-51 is that Iceland's ruling politicians are trying to \"sell\" the newly born country to the Americans, in order to enable them to set up an atomic war base, though there are many protests against this decision.\n\nAt that time (1949) Iceland joined NATO as a founding member of that\n\norganization, and there were negotiations with NATO and the US government\n\nwith regard to defense arrangements here. The end result was a defense\n\nagreement between the US and Iceland, signed in 1951, stating that the US\n\nwould be responsible for the daily operation of NATO facilities here.\n\nMr. Laxness at that time was a socialist of sorts, and the book can\n\nbe regarded as a sort of a propaganda piece, if there was not the Taoist\n\nelement in it, plus his personal touch. Debate then and ever since with\n\nregard to defense issues were heated, and the language used rough and\n\nabusive. The socialists/Marxists/communists/leftists etc etc. were sort of\n\nunited in their opposition to NATO membership and particularly to the\n\ndefense agreement. They accused the majority of Parliament (in fact the\n\nvast majority of the Icelandic people) of such things as \"high treason\",\n\n\"selling Iceland\", \"war-mongering\", meaning that some were making money on\n\ndefense contracts, etc. Most writers and artists were leftist then and\n\nfollowed the party line, those that did not were in deep trouble. Public\n\ndebate in Iceland took a ugly turn, not only with serious, unfounded\n\naccusations, but also violence. Those shouting \"high treason\" decided to\n\nuse violence against Parliament, on March 30th 1949. That day Parliament\n\nvoted on NATO membership, but every window in that building was smashed,\n\nand the Reykjavik police was forced to use tear-gas to disperse the crowd\n\nattacking the building. Mr. Laxness, with that book and various speeches\n\nhe made and articles he wrote, was of course partly responsible for this,\n\nas well as many other artists. In my book, and according to the Icelandic\n\nconstitution, throwing rocks at the Parliament building is criminal, and\n\n\"high treason\", and making propaganda and glorifying such behavior is also\n\n\"high treason\". In whose interest was the \"Atom Station\" and similar\n\nworks written? Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union. I have great respect\n\nfor Laxness as a writer, but the fact is he as socialist wrote lies about\n\nhis trips to the Soviet Union, the Moscow trials of 1937, the NATO\n\nagreement and various other things political. Now I know this book is fiction, but I know that there actually is an American base in Iceland, so this part of the book might be factual. Does anyone know how the American base as established in Iceland: were there many protests, who protested and why, what kind of recompensation did Iceland receive? Any information is welcome. Well, the above states all the pertinent facts. Iceland was not \"sold\", that is one of his lies, \"fiction\", whatever. No \"recompensation\"\n\nwas involved, and it should be stated unequivocally that there is nothing\n\nsuspicious or questionable in the defense arrangements that we have had\n\nsince 1949. Sometimes our Nordic friends, particularly the Swedes,\n\nsuggest there is. The Americans have accepted every ridiculous\n\ncondition that various leftist governments here have demanded. It is a\n\nshining example of a sound responsible agreement between two sovereign\n\nstates, based on trust. Perhaps we should use it as a model when finally\n\nthe Norwegians come to their senses (i.e. loose once more in their own\n\ncourts) and negotiate in the fishing dispute:-)\n\nThor Eysteinsson\n\n———————————————\n\nJan 7 1995, 7:29 pm\n\nCuuuuuuuut away a bunch of hm..... notes of Mr. Eysteinsson\n\nThis is not quite right.\n\nThe book was published before this happened (1947 if my memory don't\n\nbreaks) and is more or less written under the shadow of an agreement\n\nthat was made in Althingi 1946 that USA should be allowed to set up\n\na kind of base in Iceland although the war was over.\n\nThis is the selling of the land that HKL is mentioning in his book.\n\nI don't think I'll discuss this chapter, very suspicious as it may be.\n\nValdimar Gunnarsson\n\n———————————————\n\nJan 7 1995, 9:56 pm\n\nYou have a strange view of foreigners. There are foreigners that know\n\nmore about Laxness, and appreciate his work better than the entire\n\nIcelandic nation. One of them lives in Sweden; his name is Peter Hallberg.\n\nYes, these are difficult books, but there are good translations available\n\nand they show the better side of Mr. Laxness as a writer.\n\nVery well, I will finish the job for you!!\n\n(even if my views may touch a sensitive nerve with you,\n\nthe old censorship thing is out, you know...)\n\nOn Monday, I will go to the new National Library building (brilliant thing\n\nwith all these fancy gizzmos, and the books happily stashed away from\n\nview) and really do some serious research, and settle this. The \"selling\n\nof the land\" is not merely mentioned in the book, it is one of the main\n\nthemes. It has been repeated by the leftists in this country for nearly\n\nhalf a century, it is a fundamental lie, and therefore the Atom Station\n\nis, not in the literary sense but otherwise, one of the worst books ever\n\nwritten in Icelandic. During the European Economic Area debate our\n\npresent government was accused of \"selling the land\", not only from soap\n\nboxes, or twisted letters to the editor in newspapers, or by twits on the\n\nInternet, no, from the Althingi (Parliament) pulprit itself! We can not in\n\nthis country discuss foreign policy without some git with a questionable\n\ncommunist past and who has read that darn book too often, bringing up that\n\n\"selling of the land\" thing. Our foreign minister is regularly accussed\n\npublicly of \"high treason\" or \"selling of the land\", it is absurd, and mr.\n\nLaxness is responsible for this bullshit, wheither you like it or not.\n\nNobel prize writers can be totally irresponsible people at times. I will\n\njust mention Knud Hamsun in his later years as an example. I don't think I'll discuss this chapter, very suspicious as it may be.\n\nSo, why are you citing it? What is \"suspicious\" about? Pray tell us more,\n\nwe are all hanging here in suspension.\n\nThor Eysteinsson\n\n———————————————\n\nJan 8 1995, 6:30 am\n\nLet me first state that there is no doubt that Laxness was a literary\n\ngenius. Also there is no doubt that at the time he wrote the book he was\n\na god damned commie, and the Soviet Union probably viewed him as an\n\nagent of influence in its propoganda campaign in Iceland which had as\n\nits objective the removal of Iceland as a crucial link in the defence of\n\nthe West.\n\nSerious doubts can be raised as to whether Laxness was in earnest when\n\nhe wrote this book, for it is uncertain that he truly believed that the\n\npoliticians dealing with Nato had any treasonous intentions (it is\n\nalmost certain that they didn't although they may have been unable to\n\nunderstand any hidden agenda that the US had in its dealings with\n\nIceland).\n\nI certainly wouldn't put it past him to have deliberately distorted the\n\ntruth to advance propaganda objectives. However there is in many of his\n\nworks a tendency to concentrate on the negative side of human nature, so\n\nhe may have earnestly believed in the treason of some Icelandic\n\npoliticians.\n\nIn any case the Atomic Station should be viewed as a propaganda work\n\nrather than as factual or historic.\n\nI rather liked the movie by the way, since by then the propaganda had\n\nbecome ridiculous in character, and all that remained was a nostalgic\n\nlook at the Stalinist influence period of our history. May it never resurface.\n\nArni Thoroddsen\n\n——————\n\nJan 8 1995, 1:53 pm\n\nYou are absolutely right there.\n\nSerious doubts can be raised as to whether Laxness was in earnest when\n\nhe wrote this book, for it is uncertain that he truly believed that the\n\npoliticians dealing with NATO had any treasonous intentions (it is\n\nalmost certain that they didn't although they may have been unable to\n\nunderstand any hidden agenda that the US had in its dealings with\n\nIceland).\n\nThese are interesting speculations. Maybe he just wrote that thing for the\n\n\"cause\", knowing that he was lying. Later on he admitted that he had\n\nrepeatedly lied for the cause. Did the politicians\n\nhave treasonous intentions? To attempt to answer that, it might help to\n\nlook at who these people really were. I will just give some names from\n\nmemory:\n\n-- Olafur Thors. Chairman of the Independence Party (conservative), prime\n\nminister on several occasions, including 1945-1947. It is most likely that\n\nhe is the prime minister in Laxness book. Likely that he would commit high\n\ntreason? Sell Iceland?? It is public record Washington made an initial\n\nrequest (in 1946 I think) of leasing Keflavik airport, Hvalfjordur and\n\nseveral other spots for military use for 99 years. Mr. Thors as prime\n\nminister turned it down. That was the end of that. A likely traitor? Hardly.\n\n--Dr. Bjarni Bendiktsson, professor of Law at the University of Iceland,\n\nmember of the committee that wrote the constitution, later mayor of\n\nReykjavik, subsequently the foreign minister that negotiated with NATO in\n\n1949 and with the Americans, later minister of justice and prime minister.\n\nWilling to \"sell the land\"? To commit high treason? Hardly.\n\n-- Hermann Jonasson? Stefan Johann Stefansson? Both were prime ministers\n\nat various times, and chairmen of their respective parties. To cut this\n\nshort, I doubt if anyone could mention any prominent politician likely to\n\ncommit high treason at that time, and that includes the communists. Such\n\naccusations are serious, and do not belong in public debate unless the\n\nevidence in overwhelming. Unfortunately some people still resort to it, as\n\nwe saw during the EEA debate, and every time our current foreign minister,\n\nmr. Hannibalsson, raises the pertinent question of whether we should apply\n\nfor EU membership. Is he a likely traitor, perhaps? I am sure he is by\n\nnow totally immune to such accusations, but it is a nuisance, and one\n\nreason why we rarely have rational debate on foreign policy issues.\n\nNobody, not even Mr. Hannibalsson, likes to be called a traitor on a daily\n\nbasis. Mr. Laxness, in that book, came up with a new word which has been\n\na permanent fixture in leftist propaganda, \"land-selling men\"\n\n(landsolumenn). I saw it used in at least one newspaper article during the\n\nEEA debate, in reference to the prime minister and foreign minister. Books\n\nhave influence, even bad books like the Atom Station.\n\nI certainly wouldn't put it past him to have deliberately distorted the\n\ntruth to advance propaganda objectives. However there is in many of his\n\nworks a tendency to concentrate on the negative side of human nature, so\n\nhe may have earnestly believed in the treason of some Icelandic\n\npoliticians.\n\nIt is very difficult to say, but maybe a careful reading of his book\n\n\"Skaldatimi\", were he discusses this frankly, could shed some light on it.\n\nThor Eysteinsson\n\n———————————\n\nJan 9 1995, 10:31 am\n\nHoly heck! I already knew that Iceland is not as cold as it sounds, but it is even hotter than I thought :-). Let me first thank you all for participating, and express my hope that this discussion will continue. Some remarks:\n\n- The Atom Station (Atomstodin) is at present the *only* book of Laxness available (that is: published in the English language and not sold out) in England or the US. Translations into French, German or Dutch would do too, I do not know if they (still) exist. Yes, I know, I should have bought those books in Reykjavik. I have got the address of Mal og Menning in Reykjavik, so I'll try to order the next book there (probably Iceland's Clock, as several people suggested). Valdimar, why should this book be difficult for a foreigner if it has been translated? It is true that the translation of The atom station contained some useful notes.\n\n- I took a look at the publishing date of the atom station after posting my message, found out that it was not 1954 indeed, but forgot once again what it was. It might be 1948 as someone suggested, I'll have another look tonight.\n\n- Laxness talks about 'selling the country', whereas the text suggests that it is only about a war base in the Keflavik area. Hence my question. As a matter of fact, I did not see any sign of American military presence in Iceland. But then: I left Keflavik as soon as I could for Reykjavik and the western part of the country.\n\n- As an outsider, I thought the descriptions of *both* the communists *and* the ruling nomenklatura quite funny. And if Sveinn is right, than the book is just a satire of the Icelandic society by the end of the '40-s, regardless of what Laxness might have said about communism in his other publications. Anyhow, terms like \"goddam commie\" do not give me the idea that I am dealing with a totally objective person either ;-).\n\n- I had not yet identified the organists philosophy as taoist, but Thor is probably right about that. I thought it rather queer sometimes, anyway. Somehow, the 'god' who murdered Pliers (at least he says he did) returning home, telling that story to the policemen and still remaining unpunished, made me think of the Sagas too a little. Wrong/fetched too far?\n\nRegards,\n\nHerman Beun\n\n---------------------------------\n\nJan 9 1995, 4:37 pm\n\nOne should also acknowledge that statements like this one reflect a personal\n\nopinion and not fact, even if you were a literary expert.\n\nOne of the topics of the book (published in -I believe- 1954)\n\nCuuuuuuuut away a bunch of hm..... notes of Mr. Eysteinsson\n\nVery well, I will finish the job for you!!\n\n(even if my views may touch a sensitive nerve with you,\n\nthe old censorship thing is out, you know...)\n\nIt seems to me that you're engaging in a slightly different type of\n\ncensorship with all your proclamations, that is everything you disagree\n\nwith is lies.\n\nAgain this is your opinion not fact. One has to remember what things were\n\nlike back then. Although I do not claim to be an expert on Mr. Laxness I\n\ncan imagine him and many of his contemporaries having grown up during the\n\nstruggle to gain independence from Denmark and finally getting it in 1944,\n\nthat just the presence of another nations army on Icelandic soil had to\n\nfeel like a step backwards. As for the quality of the writing I personally\n\nsee nothing wrong with it, perhaps you forgot that it was Mr. Laxness'\n\nstyle to accentuate the negative and sometimes tongue in cheek.\n\nPresent government was accused of \"selling the land\", not only from soap\n\nboxes, or twisted letters to the editor in newspapers, or by twits on the\n\nInternet, no, from the Althingi (Parliament) pulprit itself!\n\nWell now I understand where you're coming from. Everybody should know that\n\nin a democracy no one should disagree with a sitting government, and heavens\n\nforbid that there'd be opposing voices in parliament itself!! :-)\n\nThis country discuss foreign policy without some git with a questionable\n\ncommunist past and who has read that darn book too often, bringing up that\n\n\"selling of the land\" thing. Our foreign minister is regularly accused\n\npublicly of \"high treason\" or \"selling of the land\", it is absurd, and Mr.\n\nLaxness is responsible for this bullshit, whether you like it or not.\n\nNobel prize writers can be totally irresponsible people at times. I will\n\njust mention Knud Hamsun in his later years as an example.\n\nBoy, finally the proof that this post smacked of McCarthyism. Obviously\n\nanyone disagreeing with Thor has some sort of communist skeleton in their\n\ncloset, I better remember to check my closet before they come-a-searching!\n\nIf Mr. Laxness is responsible for this \"bullshit\" as you say ( I strongly\n\ndisagree ) then he is a much better writer than you are willing to give him\n\ncredit for. Or according to you many Icelandics became inspired by \"one of\n\nthe worst books written in Icelandic\". I prefer to think that these people\n\ntruly believed their opinion. And whether Iceland received payment or not\n\nwas probably irrelevant since, to paraphrase, the only difference between\n\na whore and a slut is that the whore gets paid.\n\nI don't think I'll discuss this chapter, very suspicious as it may be.\n\nSo, why are you citing it? What is \"suspicious\" about? Pray tell us more,\n\nwe are all hanging here in suspension.\n\nValdimar Gunnarsson\n\n———————————————\n\nJan 9 1995, 9:31 pm\n\nMr. Laxness, at that time and at various times in his life, was very\n\nactive in politics. He did not run for public office ever, but he\n\nwrote a lot of political propaganda, and made political speeches. He for\n\ninstance wrote regularly in the Communist/Socialist (now defunct)\n\nnewspaper Thjodviljinn on political matters. Until around the time he got\n\nthe Nobel prize, he followed the party line as a socialist, and he wrote\n\npolitical books, not only fiction, including a travel book on his trips to\n\nthe Soviet Union. He glorified Stalin repeatedly, and wrote utter lies\n\nabout the Soviet Union, and about Icelandic politics. I was refering to this.\n\nLater, in his book \"Skaldatimi\" (sorry, do not have the English name) he\n\nadmitted he had lied for the \"cause\".\n\nI have a feeling that you are mixing up the politicians\n\nintentions with the writers perception of or fantasies about what they\n\ndid.\n\nI am not mixing up anything here. He wrote the Atom\n\nStation at least partly as political propaganda. He was later reluctant to\n\ndiscuss it, and clearly embarrassed. The politicians he accused of treason\n\ndid not deserve that IMO. It introduced serious unfounded accusations of\n\nthat nature as an \"acceptable\" part of public debate.\n\nTo make an impertinent comparison; not even Vidkun Quisling\n\nlooked upon himself as a traitor.\n\nIt IS impertinent; I find it extraordinary that a Norwegian is making such\n\na comparison. First, mentioning that name in the same context as some of\n\nthe best, dedicated and honest people we have had in Icelandic politics\n\nthis century is outrageous. You say you know little about Icelandic\n\npolitics; how true but that is your only excuse. Secondly, I know, on the\n\nother hand, that in Norway you do NOT mention that name in civilized\n\ncompany, let alone in this kind of discussion.\n\nThe concept of the government selling the land to the Americans can also be found in Gabriel Garcia Marques\n\n\"100 years of solitude\". Many governments have done it, exchanged\n\nindependence for economical safety. They have not thought upon themselves\n\nas traitors. Others, with other values, call it \"selling land\".\n\nIt is a subjective, moral, evaluation of what the politicians are\n\ndoing and I think they will have to live with it.\n\nMost of the Icelandic politicians (i.e. those in favor of the North\n\nAtlantic treaty etc., which means all but the socialists) that Laxness\n\nand other socialists accused of treason are now dead, but I do not think\n\nthey had to live with such an outrageous accusation. We pride ourselves\n\nof non-violent, responsible political culture, but this was something new.\n\nLaxness knew he had influence, and abused it, so that in matters of\n\nforeign policy it is \"acceptable\" to talk about \"treason\" with impunity,\n\nand until very recently throw rocks and rotten eggs and tomatoes at A NATO\n\nmilitary vessels visiting here. The book did damage in this respect IMHO.\n\nWe can have responsible debate and criticism of the powers that be without\n\nthis sort of behavior.\n\n(Norwegian politicians have tried frenetically to sell the land twice.\n\nThe sale have been stopped.)\n\nI know this is absolutely untrue. Give us names, and solid evidence.\n\nI assume you are not referring to convicted, executed traitors as\n\n\"politicians\"?\n\nBooks have influence, even bad books like the Atom Station.\n\nViewed as literature instead of propaganda it can hardly be called\n\na \"bad\" book can it?\n\nI made it clear that \"not in the literary sense but otherwise\" (if I may\n\nquote myself) it is bad. It is basically propaganda, written by a\n\nbrilliant writer. Everything, even his worst speeches and party-line\n\narticles, some of it extraordinary stuff, have the \"Laxness touch\". Even\n\nwhen he was viciously and maliciously attacking the personalities of his\n\npolitical opponents, there is that literary touch to it, so that you can\n\nbear with it and read it. It is good \"text\", but bad writing because of\n\nthe content and the effect on readers that are true believers.\n\n——————\n\nJan 9 1995, 11:26 pm\n\nMr Hill,\n\nYour post is just plain silly. Criticism is not censorship.\n\nCriticizing acknowledged communists is not \"MaCarthyism\", if\n\nindeed the term has any meaning at all.\n\nPaul R Wickre\n\n——————\n\nThor Eysteinsson\n\nJan 9 1995, 11:49 pm\n\n- Show quoted text -\n\nI am not a literary expert, but I state my opinions on occasion, and throw\n\nin a fact or two when needed. Fact: Peter Hallberg is a foreigner\n\n(Swedish), as stated. He is regarded here and by most in the know (I\n\ncould cite references if need be) as one of THE experts on Laxness. Some\n\nof his books on Laxness are included in the Icelandic edition of Laxness\n\ncollected work as reference. These are facts, easily verifiable, and show\n\nthat my main point in this instance, that foreigners can appreciate\n\nLaxness, is..,most likely correct :-)\n\nOne of the topics of the book (published in -I believe- 1954)\n\nCuuuuuuuut away a bunch of hm..... notes of Mr. Eysteinsson\n\nVery well, I will finish the job for you!!\n\n(even if my views may touch a sensitive nerve with you,\n\nthe old censorship thing is out, you know...)\n\nIt seems to me that you're engaging in a slightly different type of\n\ncensorship with all your proclamations, that is everything you disagree\n\nwith is lies.\n\nI have not said anything of the sort. I have said that some of the things\n\nLaxness wrote are deliberate lies. To be sure I disagree with these lies.\n\nHe wrote among other things that the Finns were attacking the Soviet Union\n\nin 1939. That everything was picture perfect in the Soviet Union in the\n\n30s, that the Soviet doctors prosecuted in the Moscow trials in 1937 were\n\nin \"fact\" trying to poison the \"leader of the people\", Joseph Stalin.\n\nThat Olafur Thors was trying to sell Iceland to the Americans in 1948,\n\nthat Parliament was committing high treason, etc. At the same time, I am\n\nperfectly aware of the fact that Laxness wrote true things, and great,\n\nbeautiful, brilliant things during his career. I prefer, however, to\n\nseparate clearly and distinctly the lies from the truths in his writing.\n\nHis Nobel prize is not an excuse for everything.\n\nThe \"selling of the land\" is not merely mentioned in the book, it is one of the main\n\nthemes. It has been repeated by the leftists in this country for nearly\n\nhalf a century, it is a fundamental lie, and therefore the Atom Station\n\nis, not in the literary sense but otherwise, one of the worst books ever\n\nwritten in Icelandic. During the European Economic Area debate our\n\nAgain this is your opinion not fact.\n\n\"Selling of the land\" is in fact a major theme in the book. The prime\n\nminister is described as sitting in a smoke-filled room with Americans\n\nhaggling about the prize of the country, mainly looking for his own\n\npersonal interest and economic gain. That is a fact.\n\nTrue or false? Is it my opinion that this is a fundamental lie or a fact?\n\nWere the politicians doing that,really, and what is the evidence?\n\nAre our politicians \"selling the country\" regularly? This is absurd, and a\n\nsign of immature democracy.\n\nOne has to remember what things were like back then. Although I do not claim\n\nto be an expert on Mr. Laxness I can imagine him and many of his contemporaries having grown up during the struggle to gain independence from Denmark and finally getting it in 1944, that just the presence of another nations army on Icelandic soil had to\n\nfeel like a step backwards.\n\nThe debate was on defense. The Allied forces had left the country, and\n\nrespected our sovereignty and views to the full. Some of the politicians\n\naccused of treason had been in the forefront in 1944, and previously.\n\nAfter the war there was the cold war, and the question of adequate defense.\n\nPeople disagreed on this, without resorting to serious accusations on\n\nselling and treason, except the socialists, including Laxness. Their ties\n\nwith the Soviet Union is evident, and a paper trail to prove it. That is a\n\nfact, not a \"MaCarthyist\" opinion on my part.\n\nAs for the quality of the writing I personally\n\nsee nothing wrong with it, perhaps you forgot that it was Mr. Laxness'\n\nstyle to accentuate the negative and sometimes tongue in cheek.\n\nI like his literary style. I do not like the lies.\n\nThe present government was accused of \"selling the land\", not only from soap\n\nboxes, or twisted letters to the editor in newspapers, or by twits on the\n\nInternet, no, from the Althingi (Parliament) pulpit itself!\n\nWell now I understand where you're coming from. Everybody should know that\n\nin a democracy no one should disagree with a sitting government, and heavens\n\nforbid that there'd be opposing voices in parliament itself!! :-)\n\nExtraordinary, and this from the US! How on earth can you get to this\n\nconclusion? Criticizing a sitting government is one thing. Show us were i\n\nsuggest this should be banned. Accusing the foreign minister, or any\n\nindividual, of high treason, or selling the country, is a serious,\n\nlibelous accusation, but if you make it in the Parliament podium as MP,\n\nyou are immune from any legal action. You can go on a rampage, spreading\n\nendless lies and bullshit, and making horrendous accusations. You can even\n\ndo this and simultaneously do a filibuster to prevent a vote in\n\nParliament. We saw both in the EEA debate, and what is bothersome about it\n\nis that it is \"acceptable\". Almost every time there has been debate,\n\nsince 1949, on foreign policy in our Parliament we get this kind of\n\nspectacle. Why? We have a political culture, because of that book and past\n\npropaganda along those lines, which accepts unfounded accusations of\n\ntreason and selling as \"respectable\" arguments, and no proof is necessary.\n\nThe prime minister and foreign minister, the entire government are guilty\n\nuntil proven innocent. Would that go in the US of A?\n\nthis country discuss foreign policy without some git with a questionable\n\ncommunist past and who has read that darn book too often, bringing up that\n\n\"selling of the land\" thing. Our foreign minister is regularly accused\n\npublicly of \"high treason\" or \"selling of the land\", it is absurd, and Mr.\n\nLaxness is responsible for this bullshit, whether you like it or not.\n\nNobel prize writers can be totally irresponsible people at times. I will\n\njust mention Knud Hamsun in his later years as an example.\n\nBoy, finally the proof that this post smacked of McCarthyism. Obviously\n\nanyone disagreeing with Thor has some sort of communist skeleton in their\n\ncloset, I better remember to check my closet before they come-a-searching!\n\nI was referring to certain members of Parliament representing the socialists,\n\nand that went on a scholarship to East Germany from the East German regime, or\n\nsimilar places in the 50-60s (these are facts, not McCarthyism), and thus\n\nDO have a questionable communist past. These individuals have a penchant\n\nfor talking about treason and selling of the land every time we debate\n\nforeign policy, such as our relation with the EU or NATO, or the US of A.\n\nTo be sure they are joined by people with no communist past on occasion\n\nwhich is also a bit worrying. The end result is that we have a very\n\nstrange process of forming our relations with other countries, to say the\n\nleast.\n\n>If Mr. Laxness is responsible for this \"bullshit\" as you say ( I strongly\n\n>disagree ) then he is a much better writer than you are willing to give him\n\n>credit for.

I am sure these people, that e.g threw rocks at Parliament a\n\nfew months after the book came out, and introduced violence as means of\n\nattempting to influence foreign policy and defense, truly believed inwhat\n\nthey were doing. They had the Atom Station to \"prove\" them right. And it\n\nis OK to say the government is a bunch of traitors selling the country, no\n\nproof is needed. The Atom Station \"proves\" that is OK.\n\n> And whether Iceland received payment or not\n\n>was probably irrelevant since, to paraphrase, the only difference between\n\n>a whore and a slut is that the whore gets paid.\n\nIn 1949 Iceland joined NATO by act of Parliament. An overwhelming majority\n\n(maybe about 80% of the people) supported this by their free will. Is that\n\nthe decision of a slut, or perhaps a whore? That was the issue, and the\n\nfacilities NATO set up here, entirely determined by Icelandic Parliament.\n\nThere is no evidence of payment, no evidence of any undue pressure or\n\nduress, the Icelandic Parliament made all the relevant decisions in this.\n\nSo, where is the slut? The Icelandic politicians felt, like the\n\nNorwegians, that neutrality was a proven failure, and that their\n\nresponsibility was to secure adequate defense for Iceland. To do that\n\nwithin an organization of democratic nations was a responsible decision,\n\nbut not that of a slut or a whore.\n\nThor Eysteinsson\n\n—————————\n\nJan 10 1995, 10:46 am\n\nH.B...@WbMT.TUDelft.NL writes:\n\nI have also read Atomstöðin.

Laxness seemed to me to\n\nhave a certain admiration for the Americans, and any dislike of\n\n\"selling the country\" was an entirely internal Icelandic conflict.\n\nMy favourite line from the book involves an FFF type of thing:\n\nA political figure has received a box containing the earthly remains\n\nof a famous poet who died in Denmark, calling the action a miracle.\n\nWhen the wrong box is opened, revealing cans of Portugese anchovies\n\nprocess in the US, it is stated while that it is a miracle that such\n\nfish could actually be sold in a fish-country where the dogs go out &\n\nvomit if they even hear the word \"Salmon\", it was not exactly the\n\n\"miracle\" they had expected.\n\n(Ok, I know I'm pretty bad at recounting jokes, it's the Swedish blood\n\nin me)...\n\nKurt Swanson\n\n——————————\n\nJan 10 1995, 4:06 pm\n\nAsgeir Olafsson (olafs...@andersen.com) wrote:\n\n: In H.B...@WbMT.TUDelft.NL writes:\n\n: * Iceland has profited from the NATO base in Keflavik.

The\n\nconcepts of truth and lies does not work the same way in literature\n\nas in politics. Literature is much more complicated than politics.\n\nLiterature is almost as complicated as real life.\n\nThe quality of literature are not depending on the political views of the\n\nauthor. (Hamsun is a great example of that.) In norwegian we say\n\n\"Det var kanskje ikke sant, men det var godt juge!\"\n\nMaybe someone can translate this into English? Anyway, with the\n\nliterary traditions of Iceland you must understand it.\n\nTord Akerbaek\n\n——————\n\nJan 16 1995, 8:41 am\n\nLaxness' \"Independent People\" is also very good. Like \"Salka Valka,\" it\n\ncaptures (I'm told) crucial aspects of the Icelandic character.\n\nIndeed it does, I had the fortune to pick it up one day when I was home\n\nwith the flu. I read it in 2 days and got such a good feeling for land and\n\npeople that I have often found reinforced.\n\n\"Independent People\" is the only book by Laxness that I've ever found\n\nin used book stores in the U.S. (in English translation).\n\nWell, I got my copy in one of the great used book stores at Princeton,\n\nthat isn't too far from Rutgers, just get on that great train and\n\nhop down. There are 2 or 3 right on Nassau Street. If you've got\n\na car check out the rural book shops like in Cranberry. I wish I could remember\n\nthe name of the little bookshop I got \"Independent People\" at, it\n\nwas in a little town near Princeton. The used bookshops are so great there\n\nbecause they buy up all the libraries of the professors.\n\nI'd appreciate any pointers to sources of used copies of the\n\nout-of-print English translations.\n\nFor reading, out of print English translations of many of Laxness' books\n\ncan be found in libraries, especially at large universities.\n\nThere's a story of Laxness that was translated into English called\n\n\"Lilly\" about a little girl. It is in a collection of Icelandic\n\nstories and poems that I found in a used book shop in Austin, Texas.\n\nIn celebration of his 80th birthday, I believe (and he's still alive!)\n\nthe German publisher Steidl is publishing a whole series of his works,\n\nsome even as new translations. 5 or 6 have been published, including\n\n\"Am Gletscher\" (Kristnihald 'a jokull, Christianity in the Gletscher)\n\nwhich Laxness' daughter Gudn'y Halldorsdóttir has made a lovely film\n\nout of.\n\nDebora Weber-Wulff\n\n——————————————————"
