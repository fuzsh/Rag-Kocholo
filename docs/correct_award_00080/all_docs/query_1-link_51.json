        "text": "A strong and memorable portrayal of a man who fought heroically to write for the world, but in one of its rarest languages. Halldór Laxness won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1955. In his best works he is considered to have combined the spirit of classical literary forms such as the Icelandic sagas with qualities that are reminiscent of what was later called South American magical realism. During his life, which spanned nearly the entire century, he not only wrote sixty books, but also became an active participant in Europe’s idealistic debates and struggles.\n\nIn the 1930s, Laxness became attracted to Soviet communism. He travelled widely in the Soviet Bloc and, despite witnessing some atrocities, remained a defender of communism until the 1960s. But his political leanings never dominated his work. Laxness continually sought to divulge the world of beauty that lurks beneath the everyday, ensuring his artistry remained a sanctuary of humanism and reflection.\n\nIn this biography, Gudmundsson has been granted access to unique material by Laxness’ family. As a result, the interrelationships between Laxness’ personal life, his politics and his career are meticulously examined. What emerges is a grand description of a fascinating personality in which the manifold conflicts of the 20th century are mirrored.\n\nThe main goal of Halldór Gudmundsson in this major biography of Laxness is to tell the story of a young man who leaves his island home to travel the world, driven onward by excessive ambition and self-confidence, as well as his vision of the great validity of life and the world of beauty, and who intends to compose stories for the world. The journey is both dramatic and eventful, but the young boy’s dream is achieved, although the sacrifices are considerable.\n\nThe English edition of Halldór Gudmundsson’s biography of Halldór Laxness, translated by Philip Roughton, was republished as a paperback in September 2023.\n\n• The Icelandic Literary Prize for Non-Fiction 2004\n\n• The Icelandic Booksellers’ Prize for biography\n\nR E V I E W S\n\n“Authoritative, full to bursting with fact, incident, marvellously readable, clear and elucidating.” SALVATORE SCIBONA, NEW YORKER\n\n“A thoroughly researched biography.”\n\nRUTH MARGALIT, NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS\n\n“Gudmundsson interweaves the diverting story of Laxness’s life with critical commentary on his work in the manner of the best literary biographies. His tone is appealing, intimate and understanding but far from hagiographical and not averse to critical irony . . . he conveys a vivid sense of Laxness’s personality, in all its complexity and ambivalence. The man comes to life in the pages of the work – something that does not always happen, even in the best biographies . . . the translation of this exemplary biography in English is very welcome. It provides readers of English with a perfect introduction to the life and works of an outstanding writer, one whom everyone should read.”\n\nEILIS NI DHUBHNE, IRISH TIMES\n\n“I have read the biography with great interest and admiration. I am thoroughly convinced by Gudmundsson’s portrayal of Laxness.”\n\nJ. M COETZEE"
