The novel Vevarinn mikli frá Kasmir (1927; The Great Weaver from Kashmir), considered his first major work, reflects his spiritual turmoil as well as his wide-ranging, experimental style. Laxness later turned to communism, and his views were reflected in his works of the 1930s and ’40s. He published a series of controversial novels set in an Icelandic fishing village, including púvínvi Dur hreini and Fuglinn í fjörunni (1931–32; both tr. Salka Valka), Sjálfstætt fólk (1934–35; Independent People), and Ljós heimsins (1937–40; World Light), which blend social criticism with a rigorous prose style. Laxness later embraced the medieval Icelandic saga and was credited by the Swedish Academy with having “renewed the great narrative art of Iceland.” The trilogy Íslandsklukkan (1943–46; Iceland’s Bell) established him as the country’s leading writer; he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955. His later novels are more introspective and lyrical, and once again engage in modernist experimentation. In the 1970s and ’80s he published several volumes of memoirs. His work includes sixty books in all.\n\nJYNNE DILLING MARTIN lives in a fortress in Brooklyn and works at Random House.

A Guggenheim fellow, a fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies, and twice a fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities, she teaches in the M.F.A. programs at Columbia University and The New School and lives in New York City.\n\nTOM YORI, an “autodidact” without degree, has been publishing sporadically since 1976, following his concern (Quakerspeak) or vocation (Catholicspeak) for, vaguely, working class experience. This is his second appearance in NER. He is currently in or recovering from another major depression—knowing how to fend off destructive thoughts, unable to prevent their upwelling or feeling physically lousy."
