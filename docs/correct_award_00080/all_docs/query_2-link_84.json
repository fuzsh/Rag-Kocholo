        "text": "The Snæfellsnes peninsula , is a peninsula in the west of the Borgarfjörður (Borg Fjord) in western Iceland\n\nIt is called Iceland in miniature, since in Snæfellsnes one can find many of the Icelandic landscapes, including the Snæfellsjökull (Snæfellsnes Glacier), recognized as one of the symbols of Iceland. With an altitude of 1446 meters is one of the highest mountains of the peninsula, with the characteristic of having a glacier at the top. The volcano can be seen on clear days of Reykjavík, at a distance of approximately 120 km. This mountain is known for being the site of the novel by the French writer Jules Verne, Voyage au center de la Terre, and was also chosen for the work Under the Glacier by the Icelandic writer Halldór Laxness, awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature."
