As she grows up, keen to make her own way in the world, Bjartus's obstinacy threatens to estrange them forever.\n\nWritten by the Nobel prize-winner dubbed the 'Tolstoy of the North', this is a magnificent portrait of the eerie Icelandic landscape and one man's dogged struggle for independence.\n\n'I defy anyone to finish Halldór Laxness's Independent People without wetting the pages with tears' Jonathan Franzen, Guardian\n\n'The greatest Icelandic novel and surely one of the best books of the 20th century' Hallgrímur Helgason, Guardian",
