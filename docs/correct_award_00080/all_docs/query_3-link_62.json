        "text": "Halldór Laxness was one of Iceland’s most respected authors and was prolific in his writing, producing 62 books over 68 years. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1955.\n\nGljúfrasteinn was the home and workplace of Halldór Laxness and his family for more than half a century. In 2004 it was opened to the public as a museum, unchanged from when Laxness lived there.\n\nIn the reception building, you can watch a multimedia presentation dedicated to Laxness’s life and work. Tickets for admission, books, and souvenirs are also sold there. In the beautiful countryside around Gljúfrasteinn, visitors can take walks as part of their visit, to see where Laxness spent his childhood and later in life sought his inspiration.\n\nAudio tours of the house are available in Icelandic, English, German, Swedish, and Danish and an information folder is available in French. Gljúfrasteinn is only in about 25 minutes distance from downtown Reykjavík and is on the way to Þingvellir National Park."
