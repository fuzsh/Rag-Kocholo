        "text": "August 15, 2021\n\nWhoever doesn't live in poetry cannot survive here on earth.\n\nI was elated by this line the moment I first came across it some years ago – and now encountering it at its home, embedded in in this brilliant novel was like a finally visiting a place I have been dreaming of going to for a long time.\n\nPoetry, coffee, irreverent and at times absurd philosophical conversations touching on religion and history, a playful tribute to the Ewig Weibliche – this turned out an excellent and fun holiday reading choice.\n\nThe excellent afterword of Susan Sontag singing the praise of it is a lovely bonus - unlike her, I just wouldn't postulate that Under the Glacier is unlike every other book Laxness wrote; the light and witty tone and his toying with the import of poetry and history in Iceland reminded me a lot of Wayward Heroes – besides, both novels made me laugh out loud quite a few times.\n\nNot (yet? or not anymore?) up to forge a review for the time being, I recommend reading this review - it encapsulates this delectable novel better than I ever could, even in my wildest dreams.\n\nAugust 23, 2021\n\nYessing on the In-breath\n\nI knew Laxness could be wonderfully ironic, even creatively sarcastic. But I never imagined he could be a comic writer, and a first class one at that. The Icelandic Stanley Elkin perhaps.\n\nThe comparison is not all that far-fetched. Icelanders are like a lost tribe of Danes. Nominally Lutheran, only God knows what strange practices they get up to cut off in the hinterland of moors, lava fields and mountains. There are rumours that a sort of Nordic Voodoo reigns among the sparse population. The bishop is concerned. A one-man Inquisition (Emissary of the Bishop, EmBi for short, also known as ‘the undersigned’) is sent out to investigate and report on the state of religious health.\n\nLike Voodoo, the local cults are syncretistic and somewhat ill-defined dogmatically. Their talismans and rituals are purely pragmatic though. If you can repair a Primus stove, or shoe a horse, or fix a carburettor, or rig up a 240 volt circuit you’re a saver of souls and a high priest.\n\nThis doesn’t mean that the spiritual is unregarded amongst the natives. These are not crass materialists (although they recently have received the luxury of alternating current). The place, sitting at the base of the great Snæfellsjökull, the omphalos and fiery source of Icelandic existence, is so overwhelming that it’s impossible not to perceive some sort of higher power, or at least one’s own powerlessness . So thoughts of the supernatural tend to run toward the great volcano and its glacier with a few old (fractured) Nordic sagas thrown in to explain things coherently (or at least poetically).\n\nTo call the devotees of this non-faith in the wilderness tight-lipped would be an understatement. They may speak the same language as the bishop in Reykjavík but they don’t speak it freely. A snatch of a typical conversation with the emissary:\n\n“Embi: Are you Tumi Jónsen, clerk of the congregation?\n\nFarmer: So they say. I’m only passing on what I’ve been told.”\n\n“Embi: So you are the parish clerk?\n\nTumi Jónsen: You can put a name to anything, my boy.”\n\nSuch a population is naturally un-dogmatic in religious matters. But their religious views would hardly be noticeable even if they were fundamentalists. As one of the local myth-bearers,the parish clerk, puts it: “My ancestors, the Jónsens, believed everything in the Icelandic sagas and I go along with them sort of more or less, though I am not the man my father and my forefathers were.”\n\nPastor Jón has nailed the church shut and allowed the locals to take the pews for emergency firewood (and the pulpit, but not all of that was needed). His congregation loves him. When confronted with the accusation that he doesn’t conduct services even for Christmas, his reply is entirely matter-of-fact:\n\n“Pastor Jón: That which is beyond words remains silent at Christmas too, my friend. But the glacier is there, all right.\n\nEmbi: No revelation?\n\nPastor Jón: The lilies of the field.\n\nEmbi: Yes, the lilies of the field! Exactly! Isn’t it ideal to preach about them—at Christmas, for instance?\n\nPastor Jón: Oh no, better to be silent. That is what the glacier does. That is what the lilies of the field do.”\n\nThe natives are correct when they say that “There’s nothing much happens around here. Nothing ever happens to anyone. No one has ever seen anything.” Nothing, in any case, that could possibly interest those who think that they can capture in words what is really important to these people.\n\nRead\n\nAugust 15, 2021\n\nLast night I dreamt of making contact with a spiral nebula. Well, I never did. I just dreamt of the phrase - one that crops up a lot in the mid section of this novel.\n\nIn Sarah Moss's Names for the Sea:strangers in Iceland, she notices in Iceland that at Christmas the focus is not on the Bible nativity story but on the Yule lads - a gaggle of Troll children who come down from the hills and play tricks on people, they are followed by their mother who likes to seize small children and drop them into her sack to take home for dinner. Beowulf! Thinks Moss (you can tell she knows her Literature), my thought was more along the lines of - well that's plainly the Christian era over in Iceland. A reflection which can mean only one thing, that it is time to reread Under the Glacier (original title Christianity under the Glacier).\n\nIt is a late Laxness book dating from 1968 or so. Perhaps I am particularly crazy at the moment, but it seems to me as though the novel with it 60s interest in pre-christian and non-Christian and alternative Christian traditions, connections to spiral Nebulae, it's trio of bearded 'shepherds' ( who are possibly lab assistants or research scientists or something) from California, who are self described followers of Lord Maitreya (the future Buddha) currently manifest in the form of Godman Syngmann of Australia, remind me of the bearded researchers in Complexity has managed to become more contemporary as time has passed and I read it again. It may well be a sign of the times that a rich person having their head removed after death to be preserved in some way and possibly revitalised at some stage no longer seems a particularly crazy fantasy in the general scheme of things.\n\nI have read only four Laxness novels so far in my ridiculous and foolish life, his style and approach has been different in each one so far. This is to be expected. At various points in his life Laxness was a Catholic priest, a Communist, the boy from the backwoods or rather the Icelandic equivalent thereof since I don't think they have enough woods to have either back or front ones. A lot of his spiritual life seems to be concentrated down into this book.\n\nIt has a couple of connections with the Eyrbyggja Saga, which helpfully I have never read except in a dream, in a spiral nebula, it is set in the same area of Iceland: below the Snaefells Glacier, and the character Thorgunna, who, despite her name, was Irish (maybe) and who after her death invited various drowned and dry dead people to join her at her own funeral feast the drowned ones spent all their time round the fire, wringing out their clothes.\n\nSnaefells volcano is also the starting point of the adventure in Journey to the centre of the earth a book that is explicitly referenced, once, twice, a few times during this story, which is a kind of parallel to the Jules Verne but journeying into the intellect, or Psyche or some such place rather than to Italy.\n\nThe setting is laid out for us so that we see it both as the navel of the world, the place where things happen, where the dead can be given new life and contact made with spiral nebulae, and at the same time it is the end of the world (although parts of the area turn out to be even more end of the earthish than other parts).\n\nIn Independent People we have the ironic homage to the nineteenth century realist novel or fulfilment of it in the light of Marxism, in The Atom Station a comedy of morality as Iceland steals itself, Paradise Reclaimed - something of a combination of folk tale with nineteenth century family disaster story with added Mormonism. And what of Under the Glacier?\n\nAnyhow the Bishop of Iceland has heard that in the parish below the glacier, that the Church has been nailed shut, no child has been baptised, the dead have not been buried, a coffin - possibly containing a corpse, has been taken up on to the glacier, and the parish priest Sira Jon has never consummated his marriage. This state of affairs is so outrageous that the bishop does not go himself to check it out, he sends a student to ask questions and write a report. This student's unique qualifications are that he is a stenographer, and that he has his own tape recorder. He is the novel's narrator, so self effacing that he is never named (though he does admit to teaching some Danish, and a bit of Maths).\n\nSent as the representative of a faith-based organisation, yet he records his conversations with witnesses on a tape-recorder - much of the dialogue is presented as a transcription of these tapes - so something not faith-based, but precise, technical and mechanical. The local priest who is under investigation is much respected for his technical and mechanical skills - he's the best man to go to if you want your primus stove repaired - however the church is boarded up.\n\nHere we have something of late twentieth century life. Organised, technical and mechanical. There are primus stoves, tape recorders and buses that arrive and depart according to time-table. At the same time there is a hunger for myth and mystery, personified in the figure of Ua. Faith without organisation. The dialogues reveal a Journey to the Centre of the Earth.\n\nOr perhaps the book is a duel between Sira Jon and Godman Syngmann of Australia. Or perhaps it is a spiritual quest, the Bishop's emissary seems to follow eventually in the footsteps of Sira Jon, who might be a Christ figure.\n\nThere is also a calf which is only ever given coffee to drink. I don't know enough about Iceland to guess if this is the comedy of the absurd or the absurdity of social realism, or indeed if the line between the two is worth distinguishing. Laxness' daughter made a film version of this novel, it is slightly more cinematic than some of his other books in that it consists of a lot of dialogue (as you would expect from a narrator with a tape recorder).\n\nIt is a little bit crazy but, and maybe I could be disturbed about this, the more I read it the more sensible this book seems to become - even the spiral nebula. Then again, I thought reading this isn't the creative destruction praised by Joseph Schumpeter and described by Karl Marx what another culture said was simply the action of Shiva in the world?\n\nThis book finds its perfect ending with its hint of the Venusburg.\n\nNovember 5, 2022\n\n25-year-old theologist and teacher Umbi is sent as the Icelandic bishop's envoy (in Icelandic, umboðsmaður biskups) to investigate a small parish in the west, near the Snæfellsjökull volcano (which, btw, is where the Journey to the Center of the Earth starts): The local priest, Sira Jon, doesn't claim his earnings and doesn't hold church service. Instead, the popular man supports his parishioners with his skills as a craftsman and a farmer while living with a woman who is decidedly not his wife. Umbi gets involved in increasingly strange and bizarre scenarios...\n\nUmbi is the protagonist and narrator, and his young age and naivety show in his changing tone and hesitant wonder when confronted with the surrealist realities in the remote, godforsaken village. His voice oscillates between first and third person, between report and impressionistic descriptions aiming to capture his experiences. The characters Umbi meets are eccentric, imaginative, and, above all: Free and wise, separated from dogma. Sira Jon lives practical charity and solidarity, caring for the souls of the people he lives with in his very own, not church mandated way.\n\nThe small community is alive with sagas, fables, and philosophical as well as multi-religious musings, incorporated in figures like Prof. Godman (ha!) Syngmann and Sira Jon's wife who is an expert for prostitution and Catholicism. It takes a reader who indulges Laxness' overflowing impulse to let his imagination run free and to add more and more humorous and unexpected turns, just because he can. Still, this is a joyful ode to storytelling and often overlooked communities that have no interest to fit into the molds the big city folk have carved out for them.\n\nLaxness still does not get enough attention for the role he played in turning Iceland's modernization during the 20th century into poetry - as Sjón likes to explain, Iceland joined modern civilization in the 1930's after a period of intense poverty, and Laxness (who was born in 1902 in Danish Iceland before independence and died in 1998) has witnessed and captured it all.\n\nSeptember 28, 2022\n\nDo help yourself to more dried halibut, young man, before it resurrects.\n\nWe already know, courtesy of P G Wodehouse and his remarkable gentleman’s gentleman Jeeves, that a diet of fish is conducive of higher thought processes. But can it eventually lead to miracles of a biblical nature? This is what the Bishop of Reykjavik wants to determine.\n\nThe undersigned, known henceforth as [the] BoRe, as in book reviewer, is here to tell you the story of EmBi, as in emissary of the bishop, a young student who is dispatched summarily by his superior in the Church to investigate strange goings on in a remote parish situated next to a famous landmark, Snaeffelsjokull, that vast tureen-lid of the world as it is described at one point by the same Embi. So grab yourself pen and paper, a tape-recorder, some dry fish or some fish oil pellets and head to the Glacier.\n\nThe first thing is to have the will; the rest is technique.\n\nEmBi is tasked to deliver a report on the status of Christianity at Glacier, after the Ministry of Ecclesiastical Affairs in the capital receives numerous alarming reports about the hi-jinks of the local pastor. The Bishop insists that the young student needs no qualifications as a spy or gospel credentials for his investigations, his task being simply to report back what he sees or hears, without commentary. Apparently, Embi was chosen because he knows how to operate a tape recorder.\n\n>>><<<>>><<<\n\nThis is my first novel from Laxness, and I didn’t really know what to expect. For sure, it wasn’t laugh out loud funny scenes, biting satire and absurdist dialogues from a Scandinavian, although previous experiences with Nordic black humour from Frans Bengtsson and even from the crime novels of Sjowall and Wahloo should have given fair warning.\n\nThe author’s choice of setting here is explained by the same Bishop, as an aspirational goal to match the greatest writers of literature with a local offering. In the context of the Nobel Prize won by Laxness, even if it was for a different batch of writing, all I can deliver is applause for a task well done, a story that deserves to be included among Icelandic national treasures.\n\nDon’t you find it odd that the greatest French writers should have written books about Iceland that made them immortal? Victor Hugo wrote ‘Han d’Islande’, Pierre Loti wrote ‘Pecheurs d’Islande’, and Jules Verne crowned it with that tremendous masterpiece about Snaeffelsjokull - ‘Voyage au Centre de la Terre’?\n\nSo, Embi retraces the journey of Jules Verne's adventurers to Snaeffelsjokull, not in search of the center of the Earth, but in a spiritual quest to define Christianity in a modern context. The guy who wrote the introduction to my edition of the novel is spot on when he remarks that this book is a mashup of several genres, but with science fiction coming at the top of the list:\n\nas a species of storytelling, science fiction is a modern variant of the literature of allegorical quest. It often takes the form of a perilous or mysterious journey, recounted by a venturesome but ignorant traveler who braves obstacles to confront another reality that is charged with revelations. He – for it is always a he – stands for humanity as apprenticeship, since women are not thought to be representative of human beings in general but only of women.\n\nBoth the allegorical angle and the position of women in society are useful keys for the reader to unlock the most obscure aspects of the conversations Embi will have with the oddball people living under the sign of the Glacier. Another useful trivia, that I only discovered only after finishing the lecture, is that a young Halldor Laxness spent some years in his youth with Catholic Monks, thinking of joining their ranks. In later years, in post - Depression America, the author was very engaged with social issues and the struggle of common people. Which might explain some of the themes the current novel tackles, but not the satirical tone of the narrative – the main attraction for me. Like, for example, the way Embi is emulating a tragic Hamlet, considering whether to squash or not to squash the bluebottle flies that found their way into his dismal parsonage lodging?\n\nWere they there as substitutes for art in the house? Or decoration? Were they there instead of goldfish or canaries? Perhaps both. Pictorial art is a delusion of the eye, whereas flies are living ornaments and much more lively than flowers, what’s more, because flowers are languid in their movements and keep silent. Even goldfish are silent, but the bluebottle is the poor man’s canary, endowed with a singing voice that awakens memories in the minds of visitors.\n\nFish and flowers, bluebottles and birds in the sky will continue to weave their music between the existential problems Embi is facing now, side by side with a near constant hunger induced by a strict diet of ‘tidal waves of coffee along with the obligatory flotsam of sweetcakes’:\n\nWhat are primus stoves, exactly? What’s a primus stove?\n\nSmall wonder the young Embi is starting to see walrus ghosts and despair of ever making sense of either the people at Glacier or the position of Pastor Jon Primus regarding Church dogma. Pastor Jon has locked the doors of the local church, spends his days shoeing horses or fixing broken machinery in remote places, and avoids sermons, burials and other official ceremonies like the plague. But is he a heretic?\n\nNow, that is the question ...\n\nPastor Jon Primus: I was hoping the bishop would be coming himself. He’s a terribly agreeable chap. I always find it so enjoyable to blether with the old fellow. We don’t agree about anything. But everything depends on agreeing to disagree.\n\nPastor Jon is a very familiar figure for me. It took me several of his conversations with Embi before the reason for this became apparent: Jon is a typical Kurt Vonnegut hero, the simple man who speaks common sense to indoctrinated people and who, because of this, is considered unhinged. The similarity was so strong that the very next novel I picked up was “God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater”, which of course confirmed my first impression. Probably the science-fiction remark from the introduction played a part in this, next to the obvious satirical nature of the inquiries of Embi.\n\nMany people criticize me for giving hay-sweepings to alien free-range horses and shoeing out-parish herds. I ask – what is an out-parish herd and what is an in-parish herd?\n\nEven more oddball characters cut form the Vonnegut cloth will appear, like the horse farrier who keeps misplacing one red horse and one grey horse, the housekeeper who only serves sweet cakes, the widow with the scrubbing bush, the poet who drives a twelve ton truck, the international magnate who wants to communicate directly with distant galaxies or the three ragged shepherds/magi/gurus who come to Glacier to witness a new Miracle.\n\nPoor Embi is assaulted from all corners either by coffee canisters, conspiracy theories or radical revelations. It’s no wonder he begins to see walrus ghosts or to contemplate reality as the head-bone of a fish.\n\npoet Jodinus Alfberg: Don’t you realise, man, that before he invented the secret, submarines couldn’t come up to the surface? And parachutes couldn’t come down to earth?\n\n- - - -\n\nHelgi of Torfhvalastadir in Langavatnsdalur : As it says in the booklet, in Iceland protomory and heteromory and dysexelixis prevail. No one understands bioradiophony or astrotelekinesis.\n\n- - - -\n\nDr. Mundi Syngmann : The main point is that here at Glacier the divine oxen of immortality will be harnessed to the plough of the soul: we are in Supercommunion, and the origins of life are in our power.\n\n- - - -\n\nPrince Polo biscuits were all that the nation indulged in as a sweetener after the centuries of black pudding and whale meat.\n\n- - - -\n\nPalisander wood’s just right\n\nTo make a kitchen look a sight;\n\n‘Cause I can turn the dark to light\n\nBy painting all the black zinc-white.\n\n- - - -\n\nSaknussem II: Why do people pick flowers? Have people a quarrel with them? In our innermost selves there is something that is analogous to them. They are too good to live. We pick them and make garlands of them for ourselves because we love them.\n\nEmbi: It is certainly instructive to hear you preach, sir.\n\nSaknussemm II: Why do people shoot animals? Because people love them, love them as themselves, love them so deeply they could eat them. The flower dwells defenceless in your innermost self.\n\nWith such conversational gambits, including an extremely long and hard to avoid poem about wood, pastor Jon Primus will eventually emerge as the only sane person around, excepting of course Embi, whose job description demands he maintains a strictly neutral position of observer. The lessons pastor Jon Primus wants to convey do not come from the gospel books, but from the lilies of the field, the kittiwakes that return each spring, the snow buntings who survive the harshest blizzards as well as the horses that need shoeing, the broken primuses and the wasteful quick-freezing plants.\n\nPoo-tee-weet? :\n\nPastor Jon: It’s a pity we don’t whistle at one another, like birds. Words are misleading. I am always trying to forget words. That is why I contemplate the lilies of the field, but in particular the glacier. If one looks at the glacier for long enough, words cease to have any meaning on God’s earth.\n\nIt would be an unpardonable offence against his equanimity to call pastor Jon a simpleton, out of touch with the larger world or with the history of the church. On the contrary, he shows repeatedly in offhand remarks that he is fluent in both ecclesiastical and economic theory.\n\nThey lied so fast in the Middle Ages they hadn’t even time to hiccup. is Pastor Jon commentary on the saintliness of church leaders. Although, he is equally inspired by nature and by the mystical poetry of San Juan de la Cruz.\n\nPastor Jon: Whoever doesn’t live in poetry cannot survive here on earth.\n\nLiving in poetry is linked to his yearning for a long absent wife Ua, a magical mystery woman that I have saved for the end of my review. Until then, I have more examples of Pastor Jon’s poetry and heretical wisdom that I want to save here for easy reference.\n\nNow pastor Jon Primus laughed. Philosophy and theology have no effect on him, much less plain common sense. Impossible to convince this man by arguments. But humour he always listens to, even though it be ill humour. A typical Icelander, perhaps. Sometimes your emissary would have given a lot, however, to be able to see the world from the standpoint of pastor Jon Primus.\n\n- - - -\n\nPastor Jon: I begin to look forward to the spring during the last months of winter as soon as the first kittiwake comes flying in over the land. In summer there grows this little flower that dies. In the autumn I begin to look forward to winter, when everything falls silent except the surf, and rusted locks, useless pots, and broken knives pile up around this jack-of-all-trades. Perhaps one will be allowed to die by candlelight at Christmas while the earth sails into the darkness of the universe where God lives and all the Christmas elves.\n\n- - - -\n\nPastor Jon: Agreement is what matters. Otherwise everyone will be killed.\n\nEmbi: Agreement about what?\n\nPastor Jon: It doesn’t matter. For instance, quick-freezing plants, no matter how bad they are. When I repair a broken lock, do you then think it’s an object of value or a lock for some treasure chest? Behind the last lock I mended there was kept one dried skate and three pounds of rye-meat.\n\nThis is probably the most important lesson to hear in our increasingly polarized and intransigent society. Laxness himself considered it important enough to repeat and underline it in the novel:\n\nBut everything depends on agreeing to disagree.\n\n- - - -\n\nThe one thing that remains is what lives deepest within yourself, even though you glide from one galaxy to another. Nothing can change that. And now let’s munch our shark meat.\n\nThank you for your attention, and don’t forget folks: eat fish with all your meals for your spiritual sanity!\n\nThank you Mr. Laxness for this crazy merry-go-round the Glacier!\n\n>>><<<>>><<<\n\nThe men at Glacier, Embi and Jon Primus and Mundi and the three gurus, spend a lot of time discussing philosophy or religion or economics, but it is the women who are the keepers of the secrets of the Universe, the alpha and omega of Life. Embi is warned about this on the first day of his visit:\n\nOn the whole, there are various things at Glacier that people would find difficult to understand if understanding of the womenfolk is lacking.\n\n‘L‘eternel feminin’ as the guiding principle of philosophy is offered here as an alternative to the testosterone fuelled norms of classic science-fiction from my earlier quotation. Womanhood gains a mystical, powerful and secret identity meant to replace so many religions written by men and for men.\n\nPastor Jon: Such women are a miracle.\n\nEmbi: The alpha and omega of power-lust!\n\nPastor Jon: In the same way as the mother’s womb.\n\nEmbi: I really cannot set that down. The bishop would think I had gone mad.\n\nPastor Jon: I wish you could get to know this woman some time, young man.\n\nEmbi: What for?\n\nPastor Jon: You would understand life.\n\nEmbi is granted an audience with this elusive yet generous avatar of the Goddess, a woman of many names beside Ua, names that are supposed to reveal Her universality.\n\nEmbi: I am wondering for whom you are knitting sea-mittens.\n\nWoman: I have introduced sea-mittens to Peru.\n\nThis Ua is a worthy companion to pastor Jon, sharing some of his views on religion and spirituality, going even a step further in pointing out the limitations of the current issues [... and I would love to unleash her on some of those politicians and church leaders who believe they can control the bodies of women]:\n\nWoman: In our society the rules about love are made either by castrated men or impotent grey-beards who lived in caves and ate moss-campion roots. Sometimes also by perverted celibates who walk around in skirts, some say wearing women’s knickers underneath. Decent women would hardly have cared to have a Church Father as a table companion.\n\nYet, Embi’s tape recorder witnesses as many baffling and contradictory statements from Woman as he got from Jon Primus and the other men. The other women at Glacier beside Ua are equally disturbing for the young man and equally obscure in their revelations:\n\nMrs. Fina Jonsen: they never wash, are never seen to eat or sleep, never read a book but never stumped by anyone, however learned, never age, and they have exceedingly beautiful navels.\n\nUa has the power to make EmBi wish to remain by her side instead of returning to the Bishop with his findings. Will he or won’t he? That’s already another story! The BoRe will tell you about it if and when he will come across it.\n\nAugust 19, 2008\n\nIt's not that I hated \"Under the Glacier\" or didn't get a chuckle from it occasionally (OK, more like a wan smile). But to call it, as Susan Sontag did, “a marvelous novel about the most ambitious questions\" and \"one of the funniest books ever written,\" is a stretch. (And btw, I'm glad I was never invited to comedy night at the Sontags).\n\nWritten by Icelandic Nobel Prize winner Halldor Laxness, \"Under the Glacier\" is the story (using the term loosely) of a bishop's emissary who hunts for the truth (using the term loosely) about what has gone on with the parish pastor (ditto on the loosely) of a remote district next to a glacier. There are rumors that Pastor Jon has not held church services in years (true), is long separated from his wife but has refused to seek a divorce (maybe) and may have hauled a dead body onto the glacier without a proper burial (very maybe).\n\nThe entire mercifully short novel is written in a style I would call Scandinavian magic surrealism, where hardly any character is what he or she seems, no one is \"normal,\" and where a mysterious woman may be dead, or alive, or a bit of both.\n\nThe narrator, in keeping with his instructions to merely be the eyes and ears of the bishop and render no opinions, designates himself either \"the undersigned\" or \"embi\" (for emissary of the bishop, get it, wink wink?).\n\nMixed in is a housekeeper who makes only baked goods, a self-defensive truck driver, a man who perpetually loses horses, a wealthy expatriate who returns with three latter day hippies to oversee a resurrection, and a casket which it takes several chapters to open and then reveals its contents to be .... well, you'll have to enter the maze to find out.\n\nThe theology in this novel is profound in a way that would impress Shirley MacLaine; the humor has not a side split nor a knee slap in sight, and the bottom line is, well, let's see ... maybe not to tramp around through a bog at night without shoes on? -- that's as good a guess as any.\n\nIt does have its moments, but not enough to get me up the side of the glacier to three stars.\n\nNovember 14, 2009\n\nMy experience with this book:\n\nThis is supposed to be funny?\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nAm I getting it?\n\nThis is supposed to be funny.\n\nWhat's going on here?\n\nAm I getting it?\n\nThis is sort of funny.\n\nWhat's understanding?\n\nOn some level, I am getting it.\n\nThis book is funny, absurd funny.\n\nWhat's up with the effing fish and the yogis from Los Angeles?\n\nOk.\n\nMy reaction upon finishing the book:\n\nIt was amazing. I think I got it. It was hilarious. It's unlike anything I've ever read. Check back with me in 5 years when I read it again.\n\nAugust 11, 2022\n\nAbstruse but for the elect (those who would enjoy it) worth reading. I found it a slog. Stopped page 171. Read his Independent People. I’m on to his Salka Valka.\n\nFebruary 5, 2021\n\nPhew, I am glad this is over! I will explain what is in store for those choosing to read Under the Glacier by Halldór Laxness.\n\nOpening in the spring of 1968 in Reykjavik, the Bishop of Iceland sends out an emissary of twenty-five to investigate charges raised against Pastor Jón Primus residing at the settlement of Snaefellsjökull, by a glacier, the glacier of the title. This particular young man is chosen because he knows how to run a tape recorder. He is to go there and observe, write what he sees, pose innocuous questions and record that which people say. The Bishop has no interest in hearing either his opinions or views—just record the facts. The charges against the pastor range from allowing the church to fall into decay, to neither baptize, perform church services nor bury the dead. A coffin is said to have been left out on the glacier. He is said to be married but to have another woman living by him in his home. And yet, the parishioners, respect, love and adore him. He is handy at fixing appliances and machines and no one can shoe a horse better than him. What is going on?! Are the claims true or false? Make the tapes and report back to us! Off he goes.\n\nWhat I have said to you so far is simple. Once he arrives, nothing is simple.\n\nWhat is served up is a mix of fables, allegories and science fiction. Philosophizing and theologizing with a splash of sarcastic humor. One might call this a spoof of religious beliefs. Add to this the presence of ghosts and demons and reincarnation and interstellar bioinduction, cosmobiology, intergalactic communication, astrotelekinesis….. Are you lost? So was I. Is this pushing the phantasmagorical too far? For me, the answer is yes.\n\nMany characters have several names. The young emissary switches back and forth from first to third person narrative. The flow of words jerks. A character’s name is stated and then his words, another name and then his words—it is by this means conversations are relayed.\n\nSome of the humor is funny. The pastor’s wife is called Ua, pronounced “ooh-a”. This is what men exclaim when she passes by. The emissary goes by the name of Embi, which is an abbreviation of “emissary of the bishop”. Do you get the joke? Others call him simply Bishop. What does this say about how they see him? On the other hand, most of the humor didn’t have me laughing or I failed to understand it.\n\nThis book is weird, confusing, not worth the effort demanded to understand what is going on. Or maybe there is nothing to understand. Maybe it is meant just to be the spoof that it is. It’s bizarre and not that funny. Although it has some good lines expressing ideas on which I do agree, reading it is a pain in the butt. I do not recommend it.\n\nThe audiobook is narrated by Ken Maxon, I have no idea if he pronounces the Icelandic names correctly. They swish by in a blur. Other than the names, the words are not hard to decipher, but I cannot say I like the narration. His tone of voice is squeaky, feminine, too treble. I can give the narration performance no more than two stars—it’s OK.\n\nHalldór Laxness (1902-1998) received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1955. His most widely acclaimed novel cycles are Salka Valka, Independent People and a third beginning with World Light. Choose one of these instead.\n\nJanuary 20, 2013\n\nHere's an Icelandic writer of which I've heard nothing about, despite the fact that he won the Nobel prize for literature. I found the book by chance, the synopsis sounded interesting enough, so I began reading and... helplessly fell in love with the novel.\n\nThis is Halldór Laxness' only book translated into Romanian, but I'm anxious to read some of his other works, especially Independent People.\n\nUnder the Glacier is truly an amazing book, which made me laugh (or at least giggle), think and wonder. It is a delightful blend of fantasy and reality which immerses the reader in a mysterious, yet earthly dimension. Even now, when I think of it, the magical world of the parish by the glacier is still vivid in my mind and prolongs its fascination upon me.\n\nThe way the dialogues are presented is a little bit strange: instead of the usual lines, there are the names of the interlocutors. It was a bit distressing at first, but this annoying fact was gradually forgotten since the dialogue became absurd anyway, yet so savory and funny that I could no longer find it the least fault.\n\nThe writing is full of humor (I found myself laughing many times) and the absurd situations that emerge are extremely delicious. The blending of reality with fantasy is in the perfect dose for me - at the end I was left in a state of reverie, wondering how much of what had happened was real. Some facts are confirmed, others are left unexplained, but this doesn't diminish the magic atmosphere of this forgotten place at the end of the world, governed by the glacier and the sea birds and populated by a bunch of more or less bizarre people.\n\nIceland through the lens of photographer Ragnar Axelsson\n\nThe old man may well be the priest from the parish near the glacier (photographer: Ragnar Axelsson)\n\nMay 16, 2022\n\nI wanted to read at least one novel by Laxness before coming to Iceland. This is an extremely odd and interesting novel.\n\nRead\n\nJanuary 11, 2022\n\nI read this author's more famous Independent People eight years ago. I liked it very much despite it being a bit bleak, a saga of hard cases doing hard-edged things.\n\nThis one wasn't like that one, not stylistically anyhow. This one was funny. In fact at times it was laugh out loud funny. The set-up is that the Bishop of Iceland sends his young emissary to the Glacier to find out just what is up with the Pastor there. Has he, for instance, given up burying the dead. So what we read is the emissary's report: observations and dialogue with the locals. The young man refers to himself either as \"the undersigned\" or as \"Embi\", short for Emissary of the Bishop.\n\nI've always enjoyed subtle literary jabbings at religious pretensions and there was much jabbing here. But then, who would deny that the church is the horse-fair of the soul? Not me, certainly.\n\nHard to rate this novel though because the shenanigans continue into magic realism which I've never much taken to.\n\nAll that said, the author was never merely funny or obscure; there were lessons. Here's a bit of dialogue:\n\nEmbi: . . . first of all I want to ask: does such a woman not have responsibilities and duties?\n\nWoman: Such as?\n\nEmbi: Well, for instance, why did the pastor's wife not remain with the pastor?\n\nWoman: I think bishops would probably find most things easier to understand than that.\n\nEmbi: May I call your attention to the fact that we are Lutheran here.\n\nWoman: I am a Catholic.\n\nEmbi: Orthodox?\n\nWoman: Yes, orthodox.\n\nEmbi: Have you not been excommunicated?\n\nWoman: I entered into Christian marriage and have never been divorced. I have always had my husband whom I have loved and respected and no other man.\n\nEmbi: What about the American who had children with you?\n\nWoman: Americans are children. Children believe in guns and gunmen. One hundred forty-seven gunshots in children's television a week. In children's films there have to be child murders. Have you noticed that if you cut the Cross diagonally in two at the middle, you have two guns, one for each hand? They are adorable children.\n\nOctober 23, 2022\n\nSehr sonderbares Buch. Verschrobene, einmalige Charaktere.\n\nEin Icherzähler der immer wieder von sich in der 3. Person spricht.\n\nEine wahnsinnig intensive Atmosphäre.\n\nHier erlebe ich das erste Mal, dass mir Stil vor Plot geht- wahrscheinlich weil ich fast nix verstanden hab 😬🤪\n\nLauter Anspielungen auf Literatur, Religionen, was einen Isländer ausmacht…. und Ua, die dafür steht mehrere Leben leben zu können, Persönlichkeiten abzulegen und sich immer wieder neu zu erfinden?\n\nDass Erinnerungen wahrhaftiger sein können, als die Person der man gerade gegenübersteht?!\n\nWas will das Buch sagen?\n\nDass Poesie Rettung des Lebens bedeutet?\n\nIrgendwie scheint das Getöne der Tiere eine Rolle zu spielen und dass der Mensch nicht viel zu sagen hat?!\n\nUnd vielleicht was es bedeutet Gut zu sein? Wie man der Gesellschaft am ehesten nützt und die Antwort nicht in der Religion zu finden ist?!\n\nWenn mir jemand von Euch in 1-2 Sätzen zusammenfassen möchte um was es dem Autor ging… Ansonsten bin ich dann mal auf Recherche Tour 🤓\n\nAber völlig egal ob man rafft was Halldor hier sagen will: das ist sowas von gut geschrieben!!!\n\nJuly 22, 2007\n\nI couldn't find Independent People in my library (which I had only read half of and really wanted to finish) so I picked of this book of Laxness's instead and I am glad I did. I was expecting something slightly more magical realist so I was maybe a bit disappointed that it was not but was glad the \"crazy\" beliefs, stories, people, etc. became what they did.\n\nThe first 3/4ths of the book seem to be filled with silliness. The pastor isn't doing his job and the women don't sleep or eat. The church is boarded up and a bungalow is built right next to it, someone might have been buried in the glacier, there is nothing to consume but cakes and coffee, the people speak of bizzare happenings and have strange explanations for the things that have happened. You ALMOST believe that you're supposed to believe in these things, you're not sure, but by the last quarter of the book it doesn't matter.\n\nAs the book winds down and the plot starts turning faster you can finally see the deep and beautiful love and humanity that supports all of these previously viewed craziness and silliness. You can finally understand the characters as real, weak and fragile along with being deeply beautiful (this is mainly about the priest.)\n\nSo yes, if you read this book, enjoy the beautifully written incomprehensible and comprehensible craziness of the beginning and keep reading. It will all become meaningful in the end.\n\nJune 13, 2017\n\nA very strange book. I felt that for the first half of the book Laxness was just having a bit of fun and then needed to find some sort of ending that made a bit of sense.\n\nWhen the Embi arrives in the Snaefells Glacier his conversations were like a Monty Python skit; nonsense statements, asides that reoccur and impossible analogies abound.\n\nThere is the magnificent Pastor who with his \"parishioners\" have decided living is about doing your own thing, helping others and minding your business. There are strange characters, a resurrection of a salmon and the return of a woman who may or may not have ever existed.\n\nNot sure what the whole thing was about (maybe Laxness wanted to enter a creative writing competition).\n\nDecember 22, 2016\n\nA rollicking rambling mess of a book. A complete shambles, but somehow it works.\n\nA bishops emissary is sent to a remote part of Iceland to investigate rumours of unorthodox religious practices. What he finds is bewildering and profound, absurd yet eminently sensible, earthy and obscure.\n\nI enjoyed the book but felt that it was always just out of my grasp, that things were going over my head - just like the young emissary.\n\nMay 4, 2007\n\nglaciers and absurdity\n\nwho doesn't judge books by their covers? i was in kramerbooks, soon to be headed to iceland, when this one called to me. i reached past the reds and blues and modern arts for a lovely green book with a title that pulled at my heartstrings. even though it was \"ordinary people\" that won halldór laxness the nobel prize, i went with \"under the glacier\" because of its title and because the subject matter seemed so fascinating.\n\nhow do i describe it? there's an intro by susan sontag that labels it as: science fiction, a philosophical novel, a dream novel, a comic novel, and a visionary one. that's a fairly good start. it involves a young emissary from the bishop of iceland who is sent from reykjavik to investigate odd rumors about the pastor - and town - of snaefells glacier. in short order, this becomes an investigation of all things considering \"christianity at the glacier.\" and that investigation is hilarious. there were times, reading it, when i thought it very well might be the funniest book i have ever read.\n\nchristianity, taoism, hinduism, reincarnation, hatha yoga, nature poetry, biblical verse, mythical fish, intergalactic communication, horse abusers and imported french biscuits ... all come together in the narrative, yet there is cohesion in the absurdity. i think what i liked best about it were the ruminations on literature itself, such as the bishop's instructions to the emissary:\n\n\"no verifying! if people tell lies, that's as may be. if they've come up with some credo or other, so much the better! ... remember, any lie you are told, even if deliberately, is often a more significant fact than a truth told in all sincerity.\"\n\nthere are so many other gems that are underlined in my copy, but here is the first that truly hooked me, from a letter from the parish clerk to the bishop of iceland: \"In conclusion, it's quite true that our church is a little worse for wear, although in fact there haven't been many complaints; but God is said to be great. No need to elaborate further on that. Your Grace's loving and obedient servant ...\"\n\nfor me the high point of the book comes about halfway through, in a long discussion between old friends pastor jon primus and dr. syngmann (mundi), the angler and businessman and mystic who returns to perform biotelekinesis - life induction - in the energy field of the glacier. the chapters that outline their discussion, through the notes of the emissary, play two different but captivating philosophies against one another. the chapters also hint at regret and nostalgia, the way our lives change separately from those we were once close to. the climax, then, for me, is pastor jon's soliloquy at mundi's funeral.\n\ni'll leave the final words to pastor jon:\n\n\"It's a pity we don't whistle at one another, like birds. Words are misleading. I am always trying to forget words. That is why I contemplate the lilies of the field, but in particular the glacier. If one looks at the glacier for long enough, words cease to have any meaning on God's earth.\"\n\nMay 31, 2021\n\nI’m new to Laxness, despite having read lots of Icelandic literature. I really enjoyed this, so am looking forward to more from him.\n\nThis is an unusual story told in an unusual way. It is narrated by ‘the undersigned’, who refers to himself as the 'Emissary of the Bishop' or 'EmBi for short', and who, for the most part, writes this account in the third person (as recommended by the bishop who gives him his assignment). In the tiny glacier community the children aren't getting baptized, the dead aren't getting buried -- and the bishop can't get any answers. It’s a sort of religious comedy with a cast of odd characters that you think may struggle to work, but it most certainly does. His characters live by the Sagas, the weather, and some type of supernatural force that passed into remission with the coming of electricity but waits in the glacier to return.\n\nThough much of the subject matter is serious, Laxness experiments with styles and presentation, and the result is something quite different to anything I’ve read before; zany, eccentric and refreshing fun.\n\nHere’s one of his character descriptions..\n\nProf. Dr. Godman Syngmann..\n\nHe is a big, thickset, old man, not too fat but heavy in the shoulders and beginning to stoop; he would probably be a full six feet tall if stretched. He is splay-footed, and carries his head sunk into his neck like some seabirds, the guillemot for example, or more particularly, the penguin. There is no sign of his having knees when he walks. He has an enormous face. His eyes have the moist sheen of a snake’s. For an elderly man, his hair is waxy and vital, chestnut in colour and with a life of its own like Saint Olaf’s beard after his death; a grey toothbrush moustache. The lower lip sags in a loop to one side; in dogs this is called barring the teeth; perhaps the professor once had a protruding tusk there that was extracted, leaving a kind of sag in the lip; perhaps the professor has also clenched his teeth too hard at one time or another.\n\nRead\n\nOctober 5, 2017\n\nCovert Returns to Christianity\n\nThis novel comes with impeccable credentials: Laxness, a Nobel laureate, is one of Iceland's major twentieth-century novelists; the translator is Magnus Magnusson, \"Mastermind\" television presenter, and authority on the Icelandic sagas; and the book has a late introduction by Susan Sontag (2004). For me, it had the additional attraction that it's set at Snaeffelsjokull, an Icelandic volcano I had just visited, and one of the characters comes from Hafnarfjordur, where I was staying in Iceland.\n\nIt is a fantastical story of the parish priest \"at the glacier\" (under the volcano), and the mysterious things that happen in his parish; but it is also very much of its time and place, the late 1960s. I found it tremendously disappointing, and I barely got through it. Sontag's ecstatic introduction links the book to a whole list of sorts of novels:\n\nScience fiction\n\nTale, fable, allegory\n\nPhilosophical novel\n\nDream novel\n\nVisionary novel\n\nLiterature of fantasy\n\nWisdom lit\n\nSpoof\n\nSexual turn-on (p. vi)\n\nThat's her list, and she links \"Under the Glacier\" to all but the last one. She also says it is \"one of the funniest books ever written.\" She gives a good account of the elements of comedy in literature, including \"defect of affectivity\" (the protagonist doesn't feel much, or express it if he does), \"repetition,\" \"deficit of understanding,\" and others. That's a good characterization, but it doesn't mean the novel is funny. Here are two examples of what counts as humor to Laxness. At one point there is a possibility that a corpse will be stolen by a South American man who will take it up onto the glacier and shrink the corpse's head. Laxness mentions this wild possibility in the most offhanded possible way:\n\n\"I promise to do everything in my power to prevent the body being taken up onto the glacier, its head removed and shrunk, etc.\" (p. 155)\n\nThe \"etc.\" is supposed to be humorous here: it's part of the deadpan strategy of comedy. On the next page, the narrator considers some damaged paintings:\n\n\"I would point out that I have prevented the old paintings... from being scrubbed with caustic soda with the kind of scrubbing brush that Hafnarfj�r�ur people use for scouring the scales off haddock.\" (p 156)\n\nThe strategies of repetition, affectlessness, naivete, and so on, are exactly as Sontag says: but the effect, for me, is not at all comic: it is tedious.\n\nBut the main difficulty I had with this book, and the revision I would like to have made in its reception, is that the book is clearly about a kind of post-Christian mystical communion with nature. It's a meditation on what spirituality might look like after Christianity. The parish priest who is the subject of the narrator's investigation has boarded up his church, and spends his time shoeing horses. (An echo, risky in its obviousness, of Jesus's washing of the disciples' feet.) He can barely bring himself to read anything from the Bible. (In one passage he is called on to read a prayer, and it takes him several minutes to find one he can agree with.) He has an elusive wisdom and happiness, and he is often called \"he richest person in the world.\"\n\nAs Sontag says, in a footnote (!), the original Icelandic title can be translated as \"Christianity at the Glacier,\" not \"Under the Glacier.\" One of the models for this post-Christian spirituality is 12th century Franciscan natural revelation. There are, for example, many pages devoted to observations of birds. Birds follow the pastor around, almost in the fashion of St. Francis, and the narrator observes strange and also natural bird behavior. There are also paragraphs devoted to a calf, lambs, the fields, horses, and the weather. Laxness is careful not to include any actual miracles, but the implication throughout is that nature itself is continuously miraculous. It's a kind of low-energy visionary nature poetry, with the revelations omitted and the rhapsodies are refracted through twentieth-century natural history. As a post-theological position, or even a hint of one, it has a pervasive softness and indecision, and it is animated by an unremitting but low-energy hopefulness.\n\nIt is true, as Sontag says, that the \"deep questions\" of life are raised here with \"impudent lightness,\" and it is almost true that it is \"a satire on religion,\" and nearly a \"spoof,\" and it's clearly the case that it carefully avoids the supernatural: but it isn't accurate to mention those things only in passing, on the last page of the introduction. The novel is about naturalistic religion from the very beginning. It hides indecision about the sacred under the lightness of its allegory, and it hides a hapless sincerity under the lightness of its satire. It's not necessary to wish this were either religious or anti-religious to be disappointed by its blurred sense of what is, actually, possible.\n\nThe book may very well be unlike any other Laxness wrote (Sontag says that twice in her introduction, making me wonder how sure she was). I hope that's true.\n\nApril 28, 2008\n\nA novel ostensibly about an emissary of the Bishop of Iceland, who is sent to the remote town of 'Glacier' to investigate the rumour that Pastor Jon is not burying the dead, that the church is boarded up, and that in general Christianity is being 'tampered with'. The investigation leaves the emissary moiled in confusion and improbability as he discovers that the church being boarded up is one of the least strange things about Glacier. One of the characters is a woman named Ua who may or may not have been killed, turned into a fish, frozen under the glacier, and then later defrosted and resurrected by a group of travelling American hippies. If that doesn't sound like a fun and interesting read to you, then what does? Even if it doesn't, trust me, it is.\n\nThis is fast becoming one of my favourite Laxness books. Although the issues that concern Laxness are closer to the surface than in much of his other work, they remain intriguing and the upside is that Laxness appears to give his own philosophies a freer rein; it's more obviously a book about thought rather than things. Not in a crude, force-it-down-your-throat way though, and not to say the plot isn't charming, because it is. It is a commentary on history, art, literature, identity, mythology, science and religion. There's a lot to get out of this little volume, and the novel is highly rewarding for the reader who allows themselves to be swept up in the baffling but amusing eccentricities of the Glacier community. The novel as a whole is bewildering, but pleasantly so, leaving the reader feeling refreshed and enchanted, if more than a little uncertain about how to feel. The joy of the unfamiliar is uplifting, like walking the first footsteps into fresh fallen snow. Any preconceptions you bring to this novel are almost certain to be proven wrong, even if like me, you had already read a number of Laxness novels (this was my fifth). I know I wasn't expecting to enjoy it so much after the reviews I had read of it. It's also very different from his other novels, the one that shows the scantest disregard for the boundaries between Icelandic sagas & folklore and reality. The writing is classic Laxness, though: wry, laconic, beautiful. Embi is one of his most endearing characters, Pastor Jon his most philosophical, Jodinus Alfberg one of his most interesting, Ua definitely one of his most confusing. I hope I've done a better job of translating the wonder of Under the Glacier, but it is unlikely. Under the Glacier is a minor classic and deserves a lot more attention than, sadly, it will ever get; even less than the glorious Independent People.\n\nSidenote: Bringing a knowledge of the sagas and of Icelandic folklore will enable a reader to get a bit more out of this particular Laxness experience. It's by no means necessary, but they are a fairly important layer in the novel.\n\nJune 13, 2018\n\nI enjoyed this but it was incoherent. It reminded me a bit of The Sellout: dreamlike in parts, poking at convention, full of references. But I liked The Sellout much more because it held together and came together and this didn't for me.\n\nNovember 18, 2022\n\nDem Wind und Wetter trotzen … eine Reise durch isländische Stille und Unaufgeregtheit.\n\nAusführlicher, vielleicht begründeter unter: https://kommunikativeslesen.com/2022/...\n\nDer Stellvertreter des Bischofs, kurz Vebi, oder der Unterzeichnete genannt, reist an Stelle des Bischofs in eine kleine Gemeinde im Westen von Island zum Snæfellsgletscher, um dort seltsamen Geschehnissen auf den Grund zu gehen. Ausgelöst wurden die Sorgen des Bischofs durch einen Brief des dortigen Kirchenvorstehers Tumi Jonsen zu Brun, in welchem dieser berichtet, dass keine Gottesdienste veranstaltet werden, Begräbnisse ausfallen, insgesamt also dem Gemeindepfarrer Sira Jon Jonsson droht, seinen lutheranischen Amtspflichten nicht recht nachkommen zu können, ja, sogar Neubauten in direkter Nähe zur Kirche erlaubt worden sind, die den sakralen Charakter des Gebäudes unterminieren. Die Aufgabe des Stellvertreters werden vom Bischof klipp und klar formuliert:\n\n„So wenig wie möglich sagen und tun. Die Augen offen halten. Über das Wetter sprechen. Fragen, wie der Sommer im vorigen und im vorvorigen Jahr war. Sagen, daß der Bischof Rheuma habe. Wenn Leute Rheuma haben, fragen, wo es sie quält. Nicht versuchen, etwas in Ordnung zu bringen – das ist unsere Angelegenheit im Kirchenministerium, sobald wir wissen, was los ist. Wir bitten um einen Bericht, das ist alles. Egal, was für irrige Ansichten und Märchen die Leute vorbringen, Sie sollen sie nicht bekehren. Nichts und niemand reformieren. Ihnen gestatten zu sprechen, nicht dagegen reden.“\n\nDer Unterzeichnete hält sich strikt an diese Vorgaben und hieraus entspinnt sich ein komplexes Komplott aus vielen Meinungen, Aussagen, Handlungsfäden und Abschnitten, die kein klares, aber ein immer schärferes Bild von der Gemeinde zeichnen, in der im Grunde alle sehr zufrieden mit dem Pfarrer sind. Böses Blut gibt es gar nicht. Probleme auch nicht. Viel Verwirrung, viel Fragwürdiges, aber nichts Verächtliches. Nur von Worten, der Wahrheit, von Ordnung halten sie alle nicht viel. Geschichten bleiben immer Geschichten wie Jon Jonsson dem Unterzeichneten sagt:\n\n„Sie dürfen nicht glauben, daß ich den Vertreter des Bischofs bitte zu schweigen. Ich meine bloß, daß Wörter, Wörter, Wörter und die Schöpfung zweierlei sind; zwei nicht zu vereinbarende Dinge. Ich sehe nicht, wie die Schöpfung in Wörter verwandelt werden kann, noch weniger in Buchstaben – nicht einmal in eine Lügengeschichte. Eine Geschichte ist stets etwas anderes als das, was wirklich geschehen ist. Die Tatsachen sind von dir abgerückt, ehe du die Geschichte zu erzählen beginnst. Eine Geschichte ist nur eine Tatsache für sich.“\n\nDer Roman „Am Gletscher“ kann und will es seinem Publikum nicht leicht machen. In einer Form von Fugentechnik überlagern und synchronisieren und divergieren die verschiedenen Handlungs- und Stimmungselemente. Mittelpunkt jedoch bleibt das von Vögeln, Schafen und Pferden bevölkerte Stück Land an der Westküste Islands, dort, wo die Weite des Meeres auf den schroffen Fels prallt, Wind und Wetter über die Dächer und Menschen rollen, das Sonnenlicht sich im Schnee und Eis bricht, Regen, Morast, Holz und Gras, Fische und Kälte den Bewohnern das Leben erschweren und erleichtern zugleich. Über all dies thront der Gletscher:\n\n„Wie Unterzeichneter weiter oben im Bericht erwähnt hat, steht der Gletscher zu gewissen Tageszeiten verklärt in einer besonderen Helligkeit da, in goldenem Licht von großer Strahlungskraft, und alles außer ihm wird armselig. Es ist, als gehöre der Berg nicht mehr zur Erdkunde, sondern sei in die Ionosphäre entrückt.“\n\nDer Gletscher steht für das ewige Eis, das sein Geheimnis vor zudringlichen Blicken zu bewahren weiß. Vor diesem Naturspektakel treten zwischenmenschliche Probleme und Meinungsverschiedenheiten in den Hintergrund. Daher spricht der Stellvertreter des Bischofs von sich nur in der dritten Person, denn Personalien, Kausalitäten, Narrative gleich welcher Art lösen sich im gleißenden, vom Gletscher zurückgeworfenen Sonnenlichts gleichsam von alleine auf. Eine gewisse Ruhe umgibt alles, was rundum den Gletscher geschieht. Ähnlich wie „Im Namen der Rose“ von Umberto Eco bildet der Kriminalfall nur den äußeren Anlass eine besondere Atmosphäre zu beschreiben, in Ecos Roman die eines mittelalterlichen Klosters, in Laxness‘ Fall die des Gletschers. Der eigentliche Protagonist des Romans heißt Unaufgeregtheit. Der Pfarrer Sira Jon Jonsson strahlt sie aus und mit ihm der ganze Text. Kein Wort zu viel, kein Wort zu wenig, und mit sehr viel Humor und entriegelter Beobachtungsgabe handelt der Text im Grunde nur von der Haltung gegenüber dem Nichts.\n\nNovember 20, 2012\n\nThe other day, I was looking for something out of the ordinary to read and, on opening Susan Sontag’s collection “Reborn,” saw an essay on Haldor Laxness’ “Under the Glacier.” Not wanting to give away too much to myself, I read only the first couple of paragraphs, was intrigued enough to pick it up, and set the rest of the essay aside for later.\n\nThe novel tells the story of a nameless bishop’s emissary (he is referred to only as “Embi,” short for “emissary of the bishop”). Embi is sent to a distant part of Iceland to investigate the odd behavior of the people there. Among other things, the local pastor has given up burying the dead, the local church has been boarded up, and the views of the community have become decided less orthodox in nature. Much of the novel is simply a detailed record of Embi’s continuous confused frustrations at the behavior of the people. When Embi asks Pastor Jon about the importance of delivering sermons, he says, “Oh, no, better to be silent. That is what the glacier does. That is what the lilies of the field do.” Instead, Pastor Jon spends most of his time travelling around the village, shoeing horses and repairing old electric stoves.\n\nDuring his face-finding mission, Embi happens across the truck-driving poet Jodinus Alfberg and his boss, the New Agey and oddly con man-like Godman Syngmann (note his name). Syngmann is leading a group of Hatha Yoga practitioners and acolytes from Ojai, California through Iceland on some sort of a mission to “find themselves” (that grating exhortation of the New Age). Syngmann, in his attempts to harness the hieratic powers of the universe, wishes to reanimate the dead. At one point, Embi meets the resurrected Ua (“ooh-a,” the sound that men make upon seeing her), who was once married to Pastor Jon before she died, or was possibly turned into a fish.\n\nDespite its subject, “Under the Glacier” has the occasional humorous moment – but I didn’t find it the hilarious, profound novel that Susan Sontag claims that it is in her essay, or that several other reviews found it to be. This may speak to the time when it was published - 1968 – a momentous year for Europe, politically and culturally. It was also a chaotic time that you probably needed to live through in order to understand the immediacy of its importance. But my parents were in still learning algebra in 1968. I’m a child of the nineties – a world of mix tape cassettes, Carmen Sandiego, and giant cellphones. Revolution was the furthest thing from our minds.\n\nIs this novel a rollicking attempt to poke fun at the American, and largely clueless, embrace of the Eastern religious traditions? Or maybe it’s just discontent with institutionalized Christianity? Or maybe my problem is that I’m looking for something it should be “about.” I ought to give “Against Interpretation” another look, since I seem to be retrogressing in regards to the advice it gives.\n\nMay 4, 2013\n\nThis last novel by the Icelandic Nobel-prize-winning Halldór Laxness is more than a little difficult to classify. In a way, it is similar to the same author's Paradise Reclaimed. In both books, Icelanders are lured away from their beliefs by, in one case Mormon missionaries from Utah, and in the other, a group of New Agers and quasi-Buddhists from California and other points of the compass.\n\nUnder the Glacier was originally called Christianity at Glacier. It tells of the Bishop of Iceland sending a young emissary to investigate a strange parish in the area of Snaefellsness in the west of Iceland. Now even in the 1960s, Snaefellsness with its glaciated mountain was considered a center of New Age beliefs. Even in Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth, which begins there, it was considered to be a magical place.\n\nThe unnamed emissary of the bishop, who simply refers to himself as EmBi and then Embi, is treated to a bewildering array of characters who pretend to be poets, sages, and even, in one case, the Buddha himself. The only one who seems unbothered by the phenomena is the parish priest, who calls himself Jon Primus, and who seems to muddle through by, instead of ministering to his parish, shoeing horses and repairing machinery.\n\nLaxness was, for most of his life, on a spiritual quest of his own. From Icelandic Lutheranism, he became a convert to Catholicism and Communism, Escaping from the attentions of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in the United States. Eventually, most of his beliefs fell away from him. In Under the Glacier, we are treated to a charivari of mixed religious beliefs. The book ends with our Embi lost in a bog hearing what appears to be the laughter of Iceland's \"hidden folk,\" or elves.\n\nThis is one Icelandic novel which could have been filmed by Federico Fellini.\n\nNovember 19, 2012\n\nHalldór Laxness ha attraversato l’intero ventesimo secolo (1902-1998) ricevendo il Nobel circa a metà strada, nel 1955. Del 1968 è questo romanzo, un unicum non solo nella sua sterminata produzione (che finalmente sta avendo una diffusione anche in Italia) ma nel canone letterario tout court; tanto da meritare un saggio monografico di Susan Sontag, che Iperborea si concede il lusso di pubblicare come postfazione. La Sontag nota innanzitutto come Laxness mescoli e superi i generi letterari, in un’epoca in cui il postmoderno era ancora nella sua fase pioneristica.\n\nIl ghiacciaio del titolo è quello stesso Snæfell reso celebre da Jules Verne nel 1864 come origine del suo Voyage au centre de la terre e quindi, in senso lato, della fantascienza moderna. In un periodo cruciale tanto per l’immaginario quanto per il progresso scientifico, Laxness gioca a smontare il genere fantascientifico riportandolo alle sue origini di conte philosophique, per poi divertirsi a smentirlo e a sovvertire le aspettative.\n\n“Il Cristianesimo sotto il Ghiacciaio”, come recita il titolo originale, versa in condizioni disperate, stando alle voci che circolano: il parroco non adempie ai suoi doveri ecclesiastici, non fa manutenzione della chiesa che al contrario è stata sprangata; pare abbia perfino consentito il seppellimento di un cadavere nel ghiacciaio, in terra non consacrata. È sposato ma non ha mai consumato il matrimonio, e pare conviva con un’altra donna. Il vescovo d’Islanda incarica quindi un giovane e svogliato studente di verificare queste dicerie inaccettabili; non avendo autorità in materia, egli dovrà limitarsi a registrare quanto gli verrà raccontato dai parrocchiani con la massima fedeltà (come “quel fonografo, o come si chiama”, “lo chiamano magnetofono”) e senza interpolazioni di sorta:\n\n“Non verifichi niente! Se si dicono bugie, bugie siano. Se se ne saltano fuori con qualche superstizione, superstizioni siano! Non dimentichi che normalmente sono poche le persone che dicono più di una piccola parte di verità; nessuno dice gran parte della verità, figuriamoci poi la verità intera. Le parole sono fatti di per sé, vere o false che siano. Quando uno parla, si rivela, sia che dica il falso che il vero”.\n\nIl giovane accetta, mettendo le mani avanti: “Non mi chieda di compiere grandi imprese. Anche perché mi si dice che non si compiono grandi imprese alle tariffe dei funzionari civili”. Nel suo resoconto, che poi è il libro stesso, egli fa riferimento a se stesso in terza persona unicamente come “l’Emissario del Vescovo, EmVe per abbreviazione”. Il testo d’altro canto pullula di considerazioni personali e osservazioni metatestuali.\n\nPerché il viaggio iniziatico di Emve sotto il ghiacciaio minerà alle fondamenta il suo ruolo paradigmatico di protagonista come giovane esploratore. Le sue domande saranno sistematicamente disattese o evase; il suo ruolo ignorato, con effetti anche comici. Il parroco, Jón Jónsson detto Primus, sembra avere sviluppato un’autentica avversione verso i propri doveri pastorali, tenendosi occupato come tuttofare per la comunità. Una comunità, come nota la Sontag, che è già oltre il cristianesimo, se non è rimasta al paganesimo: convinta che il Ghiacciaio sia il centro del mondo, trova naturale che un vecchio amico e rivale del parroco, Guðmundur Sigmundsson detto Godman Syngmann detto Mundi Mundasson, giunga dalla California per riportare in vita la sua amante e figlia adottiva nonché moglie di Jón Primus, che egli aveva precedentemente tramutato in salmone per poi conservarlo nel Ghiacciaio. Syngmann si servirà di tre bioinductors (“una parola che proprio non sono riuscito a trovare in diciassette vocabolari d’inglese, ma che dovrebbe far parte del gergo quotidiano dei santoni e dei superoccultisti della California”, osserva Emve): un californiano, in indiano e un nativo brasiliano forse cannibale, che si comportano come santoni buddhisti e usano una terminologia new age. Uno di loro suona il liuto con una tecnica addirittura preconizzatrice dei tintinnabuli di Arvo Pärt.\n\nLaxness non teme di contaminare la fantascienza positivista con la propria contemporaneità, inanellando in un ironico anticlimax riferimenti più o meno espliciti all’Età dell’Acquario, alla corsa allo spazio, alla fascinazione per il buddhismo, alla psichedelia (uno dei capitoli più importanti, Intergalactic Communication, ha un titolo degno di un’outtake di The Piper at the Gates of Dawn), perfino alla guerra in Vietnam.\n\nMa è il personaggio femminile il più affascinante e perturbante del romanzo, la misteriosa ed elusiva Úa: “Sorella della Solveig del Peer Gynt di Ibsen e della Indra del Sogno di Strindberg, Úa è la donna irresistibile che si trasforma: strega, puttana, madre, iniziatrice sessuale, fonte di saggezza. Úa sostiene di avere cinquantadue anni […] ma in realtà è metamorfica e immortale” (ipsa Sontag dixit). A lei è affidato il finale aperto, inatteso e meditabondo di questo capolavoro dai molteplici livelli di lettura: filosofico, religioso, epistemiologico, narratologico…\n\nI feedbacks su Cabaret Bisanzio sono molto graditi!\n\nhttp://www.cabaretbisanzio.com/2012/1...\n\nJuly 11, 2017\n\nMy introduction to Laxness: I intended to read Independent People first, but something took me. Maybe it was Susan Sontag's wild and appreciative review (the last she wrote), maybe the sense of lightness and weight yoked to a clear plot, maybe the relative brevity, who knows.\n\nAnyway: I ended up with the bishop's representative's report, a.k.a. the tapes and notes of the undersigned, Under the Glacier. What a ride! Given what seems a simple task, namely to investigate Pastor Jón and see if a body was left on the glacier, the protagonist winds up in a muddle of metaphysics and regional politics where international businessmen, local corruption, and pragmatic men of god whirl his head and leave the report a beautiful, glorious mess. That's the plot. Its delivery is breathtakingly graceful. Short chapters develop an illusion of ease while conversations twist and turn with bon mots and word salad fiendishly intermixed. \"I've heard that heroid deeds are never performed on civil service rates\", the \"Undersigned\" commits early on in his bold stupidity (a thing, while true, may not often be said). Or here, the bishop's advice before the \"Undersigned\" sets out:\n\nNever speak ill of anyone in a report. Remember, any lie you are told, even deliberately, is often a more significant fact than a truth told in all sincerity. Don't correct them, and don't try to interpret them either. That's our responsibility. He who would hold his own against them, let him take care not to lose his own faith.\n\nTry to produce a report after that!\n\nAnd then there are the reflections of Laxness' own wit in his reflections on novel writing and philosophy. Frequently, these are the high points of surrealistic passages where you're never quite sure what's grandiloquence at the expense of a character or wisdom in difficult contexts. Then their punchlines are delivered and the whole structure is validated. Take the following critique of bird flight:\n\nNevertheless, there has perhaps never been a bird that flies as correctly as an aeroplane; yet all birds fly better than aeroplanes if they can fly at all. All birds are perhaps a little wrong, because an absolute once-and-for-all formula for a bird has never been found, just as all novels are bad because the correct formula for a novel has never been found.\n\nHopefully you know what you're in for now.\n\nOn reflection, one of the most fascinating characters is pastor Jón. Here's the passage that unlocks this pragmatic soul: \"Philosophy and theology have no effect on him, much less plain common sense. Impossible to convince this man by arguments. But humour he always listens to, even though it be ill humour. A typical Icelander, perhaps. Sometimes your emissary would have given a lot, however, to be able to see the world from the standpoint of pastor Jón Prímus.\" My candidate for the novel's \"hero\" right there.\n\nThere are other things: a headhunter, a strangely large fish, a mysterious woman, and all the rest. You may know enough now to go on.\n\nOctober 5, 2015\n\n'When I discovered that history is a fable, and a poor one at that, I started looking for a better fable, and found theology' (Pastor JP)\n\nWhat a uniquely bizarre book! It resisted my rational understanding and desire to define and categorize it. I don't know how much of it was absurd, and how much I simply failed to understand. It's one of those books with a very simple storyline but yet so rich in meaning and layers and nuances.\n\nAlthough it took a few good pages to get into it + it didn't wow me to the same degree as 'Independent People' did, I would recommend this book for its charm, peculiarity and delicious absurdity. It definitely takes a huge amount of literary talent to write something like this. Laxness is quickly becoming my fav writer."
