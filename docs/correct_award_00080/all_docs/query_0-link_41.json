        "text": "Ian McEwan was awarded the inaugural €15,000 Halldór Laxness International Literary Prize, announced at the Reykjavík International Literary Festival in April 2019. McEwan was unable to attend the festival, but visited Iceland in September to accept the award. The biennial award, named for the Icelandic Nobel Laureate in Literature, is sponsored by the Ice­landic government in partnership with Laxness’s Icelandic publisher Gljúfrasteinn and Forlagið.\n\nWhile you are here, please take a moment to support Locus with a one-time or recurring donation. We rely on reader donations to keep the magazine and site going, and would like to keep the site paywall free, but WE NEED YOUR FINANCIAL SUPPORT to continue quality coverage of the science fiction and fantasy field."
