This December, 60 years will have passed since beloved author Halldór Laxness was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature, making him the first and only Icelandic writer to receive the prestigious award. To commemorate the historic event it has been proposed to build a literary centre near the author’s former home at Gljúfrasteinn in Mosfellsdalur valley, southwest Iceland.

According to Vísir the idea was introduced as a parliamentary bill and proposes that the centre will mainly focus on the life and work of Laxness but also serve as a culture and literary centre.
