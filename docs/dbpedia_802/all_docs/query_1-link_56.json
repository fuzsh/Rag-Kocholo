        "text": "Newton’s cradle uses swinging spheres to show how the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy works. The device was named after Sir Isaac Newton and designed by French scientist Edme Mariotte. What happens when you replace these spheres with magnets?\n\nThis is one of a set of resources developed to support the teaching of the primary national curriculum. They are designed to support the delivery of key topics within science and design and technology. This resource focuses on producing a magnetic Newton’s cradle that uses magnets which repel each other instead of the usual metal spheres.\n\nActivity: How to make a magnetic Newton's cradle\n\nIn this activity learners will make a Newton’s cradle using magnets, instead of the usual spherical pieces of metal. They will test their product and observe how it behaves compared to a regular Newton’s cradle. They will learn about how magnets have a north and south pole, and why they attract or repel each other.\n\nThis is a great way for students to learn all about magnets and could be used as a one-off activity or as part of a wider unit of work focusing on magnets and magnetism. It can also be used in conjunction with other IET Education resources, developed alongside the School of Engineering at Cardiff University.\n\nDownload the free and printable resources below for detailed notes and instructions on how to make a magnetic Newton's cradle.\n\nThis activity will take approximately 65-90 minutes.\n\nTools/resources required\n\nParts:\n\nCircular magnets with holes in the middle (with N and S poles)\n\n150 mm lengths of dowel\n\n75 mm lengths dowel\n\n100 – 120 mm long pieces of string (6 per unit being built)\n\nMasking tape\n\nTools and equipment\n\nExample of a ‘regular’ Newton’s cradle.\n\nScissors\n\nHot glue guns, if appropriate"
