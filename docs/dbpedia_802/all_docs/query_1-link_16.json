        "text": "The Newton’s Cradle, named after Sir Isaac Newton, demonstrates the physics concepts conservation of momentum and conservation of energy in elastic collisions. But, to many it is also an example of Kinetic Art and seen by children, as well as adults, as a fascinating toy. In this video, we recorded our Newton’s Cradle in slow motion. The Newton’s Cradle in the video was constructed for STEAMfest 2020’s in person event on Woodlawn School’s campus, but since we can not play with it in the virtual STEAMfest realm, we offer additional information about constructing your own Newton’s Cradle.\n\nConstructing your own Newton’s Cradle\n\nMy husband, Lee Blakely, and I constructed our Newton’s Cradle from wood, two long bolts, wire, and weighted metal balls we purchased online. We used JBWeld to affix the wire to our metal balls and connected each side of our wire to the long bolts. It took several adjustments to align the balls in a straight line. If you try constructing your own Newton’s Cradle, you may find it takes some trial and error so don’t give up. We made a few models and found our success varied depending on the type of wire or string used and the weight and mass of the balls.\n\nWe found this video from K-Media that shows how to make a Newton’s Cradle from cardboard, marbles, string, and wooden dowels.\n\nAdult supervision of younger viewers is recommended for this activity.\n\nPhysics Concepts\n\nHere’s a video explaining the Physics concepts conservation of momentum and conservation of energy demonstrated by the Newton’s Cradle:\n\nKinetic Art\n\nKinetic Art is art that is either perceived as moving or depends on movement for its effect. The Newton’s Cradle is an example of Kinetic Art that depends on movement for its effect. Here’s a Kinetic Artist that also depends on movement for effect. If you listen closely, you may hear him talk about the physics concepts of conservation of momentum and energy.\n\nJournal Questions\n\nSo, do you think the Newton’s Cradle is a model for explaining conservation of energy/motion, a piece of Kinetic Art, or a fun toy to play with? Why do you feel that way?\n\nDid you build a Newton’s Cradle? If so, would you please share a picture and/or tell us about your process?\n\nLook around your house or yard and let us know what pieces of Kinetic Art you see or if you can find anything that demonstrates conservation of momentum/energy. We’d love a picture and/or explanation of what you found.\n\nEarn badges and qualify for prize drawing by registering and answering journal questions. It's fun and easy!"
