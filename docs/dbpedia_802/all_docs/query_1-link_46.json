        "text": "Newton's Cradle is a clever device that not only demonstrates a pendulum, but also shows the Law of Conservation of Momentum and Energy. Friction and damping effects are also observed. This device is often used as a toy to amuse people. Newton's Cradle was invented in the late 1600s by scientist and mathematician Isaac Newton.\n\nSome questions you may have are:\n\nWhat is Newton's Cradle?\n\nWhat does it look like?\n\nWhy does it work?\n\nThis lesson will answer those questions. There is a mini-quiz near the end of the lesson.\n\nNewton's Cradle\n\nNewton's Cradle consists of several metal balls (usually 5) suspended from a rack by wires or rods, such that they line up and are in contact when in a resting position. There are two wires attached to each ball to keep the pendulum motion in one plane.\n\nEnd balls move\n\nWhen an end ball is pulled up and let go, it swings down as a pendulum and hits the next ball. The energy and momentum from that ball is transmitted through the three balls at rest to the ball on the other end. That ball is propelled forward at the same speed as the first ball had due to the force of the first collision.\n\nIf two or more balls are pulled up and let go, the same number of balls will be propelled forward due to the collision.\n\nSlowly slows down\n\nSince it is a form of pendulum, the action will go back and forth until it slowly slows down due to losses from friction and the elasticity of the balls.\n\nSimulation\n\nThe following simulation allows you to explore Newton's Cradle on your computer similar to using the real device. (Note that you must have the Macromedia Flash player installed in your computer to use this simulation.)\n\nDrag on one ball\n\nPlace you mouse pointer on an end ball, hold down the left mouse button, and drag the ball, so it is at an angle. Then release the mouse button and let the ball swing free. You will see that only one ball on the other end of the group swings up at about the same speed as the ball you let go.\n\nNotice that the balls start to slow down and will bounce less and less until they finally stop. This is due to losses from friction and energy that is absorbed in the balls. The effect is called damping of the periodic motion.\n\nDrag multiple balls\n\nYou can drag two, three or four balls and let them go. The same number of balls you release will be moved forward upon the collision with the moving balls. This verifies the Law of the Conservation of Momentum, which states that the momentum (mass times velocity) remains the same after a collision.\n\nExplanation and equations\n\nWhen one or more balls are pulled up and let go, they swing down as a pendulum. The velocity (v) of the balls, when they hit the resting balls is determined by the height (h) from where they were let go and the acceleration of gravity (g). The velocity is approximately v = SQRT(2*h/g).\n\nThe kinetic energy of the balls is KE = m*v2/2 and the momentum is p = m*v, where m is the mass of the balls in motion.\n\nBecause the momentum and energy must be maintained in this system, the balls that move will have the same velocity and total mass as the balls that were in initial motion. Thus, if two balls are let go, two balls will be sent in motion after the collision.\n\nOf course, friction and losses due to elasticity will slowly reduce the speed of the balls.\n\nIn conclusion\n\nNewton's Cradle demonstrates laws of motion, including the Laws of Conservation of Momentum and Energy. The simulation allows you to experiment swinging different number of balls to verify the conservation of momentum."
