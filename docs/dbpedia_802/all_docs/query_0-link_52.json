        "text": "he Validity of saying Ya RasoolAllah [Salal Laho Allehi Wasllam]\n\nOctober 5, 2010 by Admin\n\nIf anyone asks you provide proof of the validity of saying Ya RasoolAllah [Salal Laho Allehi Wasllam] provide them this reference.\n\nThe Hadith narrated on the authority of Sayidnah Usman bin Hanif (Radi Allah Anho) that a blind Sahabi was taught a special Du‚Äôa by Sayidnah RasoolAllah (Salal laho Allehi Wasllam), which he was to recite after every Salah.\n\nThe Du‚Äôa is as follows :\n\n‚ÄúO Allah Almighty, I ask from You, and turn towards You through the Wasilah (Medium) of Your Nabi Muhammad (Salal Laho Allehi Wasllam), who is indeed a Prophet of Mercy. O Muhammad ( Salal Laho Allehi Wasllam), with your Wasilah (Medium) I turn towards Allah Almighty for my need so that it may be bestowed. O Allah Almighty , accept the Prophet‚Äôs intercession for me.‚Äù\n\nThe Hadith above has been narrated upon the authority of the following Scholars and Masters of Hadith\n\nImam Bukhari (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Muslim (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Ibn-e-Maja (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Tirmidi (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Bahiqi (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Ibn-e-Hazeema (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Abul-Qasim Tabrani (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Manzari (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Hakim (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nImam Nisae (Radi Allah Anho),\n\nThe Concept of Namoos-e-Risalat or Honour of Prophet Mohammad: The Quran, Hadith, Blasphemy and Pakistani Ulema\n\nNew Age Islam Staff Writer\n\n11 May 2021\n\nThe Violent Ideology Of The Protection Of The Honour Of Prophethood Is At The Root Of Sectarian Bloodshed In Pakistan\n\nMain Points:\n\n1.Quran does not prescribe any punishment for blasphemy\n\n2. Islamic scholars of Pakistan promote violence in the name of protection of Namoos-e-Risalat\n\n3. The holy Prophet pbuh pardoned many blasphemers.\n\n4. A Muslim cannot be killed for blasphemy.\n\n5. Dr Tahirul Qadri has distorted the meaning of verses to justify blasphemy killings.\n\n‚Äî‚Äì\n\nProphet Mohammad pbuh is the last prophet and was the founder of Islam. The holy Quran was revealed to him. Prophet Mohammad pbuh suffered many humiliations, abuses, physical torture and even death threats during his initial eleven years of Prophethood. He made many sacrifices for the Muslims and Islam. For this, Muslims also love him for his sacrifices, for his guidance and for the pain he went through for his Ummah.\n\nThe Quran also praises him a number of times and asks Muslims to send salam to the holy Prophet pbuh as God also sends Darood-O-Salam to him.\n\n‚ÄúVerily God and His angels send blessings on the Prophet. O believers, send darood-o-salam on him.‚Äù(Al Ahzab:56)\n\nThe Quran asks Muslims again and again to respect their prophet pbuh and obey him and accept him as an arbitrator in all matters concerning them and all disputes arising among them.\n\n‚ÄúBut no, by your Lord, they cannot become true believers until they seek your arbitration in all matters on which they disagree among themselves and then find not the least vexation in their hearts over what you have decided and accept it on willing submission.‚Äù(Al Nisa:65-66)\n\nFurther, the Quran has declared that the holy Prophet pbuh is more important than the believers‚Äô own self. No one in a believer‚Äôs life is more important than the Prophet pbuh.\n\n‚ÄúSurely the Prophet pbuh has a greater claim over themselves.‚Äù(Al Ahzab:6)\n\nThis is because God loves His prophet pbuh and showers His blessings on him. If any one speaks ill of the holy Prophet pbuh, it hurts God and angers Him.\n\n‚ÄúIndeed those who trouble Allah and His noble messenger upon them is Allah‚Äôs curse in the whole world and in the Hereafter and Allah has kept prepared a disgraceful punishment for them.‚Äù (Al Ahzab:57)\n\nHowever, in spite of all this, the Quran does not prescribe a physical punishment for insults and evil words hurled against the holy Prophet pbuh. The Quran asks Muslims to observe restraint and leave the matter to Allah as He has prepared a grievous punishment for them in the Hereafter.\n\n‚ÄúThose who cause pain to the messenger of Allah, theirs shall be a painful chastisement.‚Äù(At Taubah:61)\n\n‚ÄúAnd you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Book before you and from those who worship many idols. But if you persevere patiently and guard against evil then that will be a determining factor in all affairs.‚Äù(Al-e-Imran:186)\n\nAll the above quoted verses make it clear that though God loves prophet Mohammad pbuh dearly and wants believers to send Darood-o-Salam on him as a mark of respect and love and though He is hurt at insults and abuses thrown at him, God does not want violence or bloodshed in the name of protecting his honour. He has prepared a severe torment for those who insult the prophet pbuh in the Hereafter.\n\nSo the Quran has produced the concept of the sanctity of the personality of Prophet Mohammad pbuh or Namoos-e-Risalat. A Muslim keeps the holy Prophet pbuh in high esteem and loves him more than his dear ones and his own life and obeys his commandments in all personal or communal issues.\n\nBut the concept of Namoos-e-Risalat presented by the Quran is devoid of any violence aimed at the opponents. The Quran advises Muslims to practice restraint in face of insult or blasphemy. To the Quran, protecting the honour of the Prophet pbuh means obeying him and adhering to his teachings of tolerance, forgiveness, submission to the will of God, charity, service to humankind and making sacrifices in the path of God.\n\nBut in later years, Islamic scholars explained the concept of Namoos-e-Risalat from the point of view of Hadith according to which a number of Jews and polytheists during the Prophet‚Äôs life were killed at the order of the holy prophet pbuh or the killing of such people by Muslims was approved by the Prophet pbuh. On the other hand, there are also instances when the holy Prophet pbuh forgave the blasphemers.\n\nThough the Quran does not prescribe any punishment for blasphemy, leave aside death sentence and rather advises restraint, Islamic jurisprudents drew their conclusion in favour of death sentence for blasphemy from the execution of blasphemers during the prophet‚Äôs life.\n\nThe instances in which the prophet pbuh ordered the killing or approved the killing of blasphemers were the worst kind of habitual offenders who spoke or wrote highly abusive or insulting content. To understand the degree of hurtfulness of these abusive and blasphemous writings or speech we need to k ow the fact that in Arab in those times, the poetic genre of hijw (satirical poems) was very popular. These poems were written by people with poetic abilities in order to denigrate or insult or to do character assassination of opponents. Often, the poets mentioned the names of mothers, daughters, sisters or wives of their opponents in the poems and wrote filthy things about them. This would cause grave harm to the dignity of the targeted family or persons. This would often lead to bloodshed and fights. If one goes through the satirical poetry of one of the greatest poets of Abbasid era, Al Mutanabbi Alkindi, one can easily understand how damaging these poems were. Al Mutanabbi himself was killed by a man against whom he had written filthy satirical poetry.\n\nTherefore, some of them who were killed b Muslims for committing blaspbemy against the holy prophet pbuh were poets who continually wrote or sang damaging and abusive poetry against him and his family members. However, there are also instances when the holy Prophet pbuh forgave his blasphemers when they repented. And the number of those forgiven is greater than the number of those killed. One of those forgiven is the poet Kaab bin Zuhair who later wrote the famous Qasida Burdah in praise of the holy prophet pbuh and received a shawl from the holy prophet pbuh as a gift.\n\nThis violent concept of the protection of Namoos-e-Risalat was promoted in Pakistan due to sectarian and political reasons. A number of books on Namoos-e-Risalat were written in Urdu justifying the killing of those committing blasphemy. Some of the books are titled ‚ÄúGustakh-E-Rasool Ki Saza Sar Tan Se Juda‚Äù Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat Aur Hamari Zimmedariyan (Protection of the honour of prophet and our responsibility), Namoos-e-Risalat ke Saat Shaheed ( Seven martyrs of the Sanctity of Prophethood) etc. Two important books on the subject are ‚ÄúNamoos-E-Risalat Ki Hifazat Kijye( Protect the honour of Prophethood) by Mufti Taqi Usmani and Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat ( Protection of the honour of Prophethood) by Dr Tahirul Qadri.\n\nThe book by Tahirul Qadri deals with the subject of blasphemy from both historical and ideological points of view. The book gives an insight into how the concept of the protection of the honour of the prophet pbuh evolved over centuries and how the interpretations and personal opinions of muftis, jurisprudents and lesser known Islamic scholars together formed the current violent ideology of Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat in Pakistan.\n\nIt becomes clear from the book that Dr Tahirul Qadri who had written a voluminous fatwa against terrorism and suicide bombings himself supports death for blasphemy of any degree. To support his belief, he quotes Ibn-e-Taymiyyah:\n\n‚ÄúOf course even if the person abusing the prophet pbuh may be a Muslim he will become kafir due to his temerity and in view of the four imams and other imams deserves to be killed.‚Äù\n\nHe quotes Imam Abu Sulaiman al Khatabi:\n\nI do not know even a single Muslim who had disagreed on the permissibility of the killing of the person committing blasphemy against the prophet pbuh even if he is a Muslim.‚Äù\n\nHe quotes Imam Abu Bakr Jasas:\n\n‚ÄúThere is no disagreement anong Muslims on the issue that whoever attempts insult and pain to the holy prophet pbuh is an apostate deserving to be killed even if the person happens to be a Muslim.‚Äù\n\nHe also quotes the statement of Allama Ismail Haqqi from his book Roohul Bayan:\n\n‚ÄúLet it be known to you that there is unanimity of the Muslim community on that insult to the holy prophet pbuh or any other prophet is Kufr irrespective of whether the person commits it intentionally or unintentionally. Abusing the holy prophet pbuh intentionally or unintentionally is equal because in the event of Kufr, no one will be exempted on the basis of ignorance, nor will the claim that it was a slip of tongue be accepted when his sanity was intact.‚Äù\n\nThe statements of the Islamic jurists, scholars and muftis make it clear that even Muslims can be accused of blasphemy and killed though during the prophet‚Äôs life only a few polytheists, Jews and Munafiq were killed. A Muslim can never speak ill of or abuse the holy prophet pbuh but from the statements of the Islamic scholars quoted above even Muslims can be held guilty of blasphemy and killed. According to Allama Ismail Haqqi even if some one commits blasphemy unintentionally, he can be killed. This argument is used to frame Muslims in blasphemy charges in Pakistan.\n\nHere are some examples.\n\n1) A Muslim man walks into a police station in Pakistan. He has an altercation with the station-in-charge. During the altercation, the man abuses the officer-in-charge. The officer-in-charge registers a case of blasphemy against the man. The reason: The name of the office-in-charge was Mustafa.\n\n2) A Sunni Muslim medical representative visits a doctor belonging to the Ismaili sect of Shias. The doctor makes him wait for long. The MR is irritated and enters the doctor‚Äôs chamber without his permission and thrusting his visiting card on his table says: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have much time. So call me when you are free.‚Äù Incensed at the arrogance of the MR, the doctor throws his visiting card into the dust bin. The MR registers a case of blasphemy against the Shia doctor because the name on the visiting card contained ‚ÄúMohammad‚Äù.\n\n3. According to a latest legislation passed y the Punjab Assembly, saying ‚ÄúKhatamun Nabiyyin‚Äù(the last Prophet) with the name of Prophet Mohammad pbuh is mandatory for everyone. If someone forgets to say that he will be accused of blasphemy.\n\nMany examples can be given. A Muslim can never commit blasphemy against the holy prophet pbuh but it is the definition and interpretation of the word Ahanat (blasphemy) by the Islamic scholars that will cover even the Muslims under blasphemy.\n\nDr Tahirul Qadri goes one step further. He finds a verse that clearly orders the killing of those committing blasphemy. He quotes verse no. 61 of surah Al Ahzab to support his belief that the Quran permits the killing of those committing blasphemy against the holy prophet pbuh. The verse is as follows:\n\n‚ÄúThe accursed ones, wherever they are found and seized they are killed.‚Äù The verse uses the words ‚ÄúQuttilu Taqteela‚Äú. He says:\n\n‚ÄúAccording to Quran, who ever commits blasphemy against the prophet pbuh will be killed according to ‚ÄúQuttilu Taqteela‚Äú. The jurisprudents of the community have issued similar orders for the protection of the honour of the Prophethood in every age. The moment anyone committed blasphemy against the prophet pbuh, killing order was issued for him so that the disease of blasphemy is rooted out for good.‚Äù\n\nThe fact is that the verse in question is not about blasphemy but about the mischief mongering of the Munafiq and enemies of Muslims of the prophet‚Äôs time who would falsely accuse Muslim men and women of sins and spread rumours about them and spread mischief of every kind. The verse does not deal specifically about blasphemy against the holy prophet pbuh. The preceding verses are as follows that give a clear picture of the context;\n\n‚ÄúFor those who annoy Allah and His messenger‚ÄìAllah has cursed them in the world and in the Hereafter and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment (Azabam Muhina).(57) And those who cause pain to believing men and women undeservedly bear a calumny and a glaring sin.(58) O Prophet tell thy wives and daughters and the believing women that they should cast their outer garments over their persons; that is most convenient, that they should be known and not molested. And Allah is oft-forgiving most Merciful.(59)\n\nTruly if the hypocrites and those in whose heart is a disease and those who stir up sedition in the city, desist not , We shall certainly stir thee up against them. Then will they not be able to stay in it as thy neighbours for any length of time‚Äù(60)They shall have a curse on them: wherever they are found, they shall be seized and slain,‚Äù(61)\n\nFrom the above quoted verses it becomes clear that the mischiefs of the Munafiq against the prophet pbuh and against the believing men and women is being discussed here and not specifically blasphemy. And for blasphemy, a humiliating punishment (Azab-e-Muheen) from God in the Hereafter is mentioned. In the Quran the word Azab means wrath of God either in the world or in the Hereafter. Azab does not mean physical punishment by law of the land. But to prove that the verses quoted above are about blasphemy and God has prescribed death for blasphemy, he says that the phrase Azab-e-Muheen in verse 57 means capital punishment. Here is his argument:\n\n‚ÄúAzab-e-Muheen means very painful and humiliating punishment which has lessons for others. This is a common word. This word has been used on various occasions in the Quran in relation to various sins and crimes. Its meaning is always determined with reference to the Book and Sunnah . In other words, the word does not have a predetermined meaning so it cannot be used everywhere for the same punishment qualitatively and quantitatively. Its meaning will be determined according to the context and the gravity and degree of the crime will be kept in view.\n\nBut it can be definitely said that when this word (Azab-e-Muheen) will be used in connection with blasphemy against the Prophet pbuh, it will only mean death sentence, not any other punishment.‚Äù(Tahaffuz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat: Dr Tahirul Qadri, Page 156)\n\nSuch interpretations (rather misinterpretations) of the Quranic verses by reliable Islamic scholars of the Quran have only promoted violence in the name of the protection of the honour of the Prophet. No Muslim was killed for blasphemy during the life of the prophet. There is an incident when Hadhrat Umar wanted to kill a Kharijite because he accused the holy Prophet pbuh of not distributing the war booty among the warriors justly but the holy Prophet pbuh prohibited him from doing so to avoid disturbance and bloodshed.\n\nIn Pakistan books written by Dr Tahirul Qadri and other Islamic scholars on Namoos-e-Risalat justifying the killing of Muslims and non-Muslims by the arguments quoted above have complicated the situation. The blasphemy laws of Pakistan provide for punishments from penalty to death sentence. Most of the accused in these blasphemy cases are Muslims. Cases of blasphemy are slapped on members of minority communities on slightest provocation. Even if the courts acquit the accused, they are killed extra judicially and the killer is glorified and made into a saint.\n\nSince 1990, about 77 people have been killed in connection with blasphemy. About 80 convicts are on death row. From 1967 to 2014, over 1300 people have been accused of blasphemy and most of the accused are Muslims. Asia Bibi, a Christian woman was accused of blasphemy but the court acquitted her. Still the extremists threatened to kill her. At last she had to leave her motherland Pakistan and seek asylum in Canada.\n\nHuman Rights activists and liberal Islamic scholars have been campaigning for reforms or changes in the current blasphemy laws but radical Islamic groups are against any changes in the laws against blasphemy. In 2011, Governor of Punjab Salman Taseer was killed by his bodyguard Mumtaz Qadri because Salman Taseer demanded reforms in blasphemy laws.\n\nIn 2015, Khadim Hussain Rizvi founded Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan on the issue of blasphemy. It is against any changes in the blasphemy laws of the country.\n\nBlasphemy laws have no basis in the Quran but Islamic scholars like Dr Tahirul Qadri have distorted the meanings of the verses of the Quran to justify the killings in the name of protecting the honour of the prophet pbuh. Arguments and opinions of other Islamic scholars have also been accepted to declare even Muslims of opposing sects as kafirs and deserving death. Until these misinterpretations and personal opinions of jurists not supported by the Quran and Hadith are refuted in the light of the Quran and Hadith, bloodshed and persecution of Muslims and non-Muslims will continue and tarnish the image of Isla\n\nThe Newton‚Äôs cradle is a device that demonstrates the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy with swinging spheres.

When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir Isaac Newton and designed by French scientist Edme Mariotte. It is also known as Newton‚Äôs pendulum, Newton‚Äôs balls, Newton‚Äôs rocker or executive ball clicker (since the device makes a click each time the balls collide, which they do repeatedly in a steady rhythm)\n\nOperation[edit]\n\nNewton‚Äôs cradle in slow motion\n\nWhen one of the end balls (‚Äúthe first‚Äù) is pulled sideways, the attached string makes it follow an upward arc. When it is let go, it strikes the second ball and comes to nearly a dead stop. The ball on the opposite side acquires most of the velocity of the first ball and swings in an arc almost as high as the release height of the first ball. This shows that the last ball receives most of the energy and momentum of the first ball. The impact produces a compression wave that propagates through the intermediate balls. Any efficiently elastic material such as steel does this, as long as the kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy in the compression of the material rather than being lost as heat. There are slight movements in all the balls after the initial strike but the last ball receives most of the initial energy from the impact of the first ball. When two (or three) balls are dropped, the two (or three) balls on the opposite side swing out. Some say that this behavior demonstrates the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions. However, if the colliding balls behave as described above with the same mass possessing the same velocity before and after the collisions, then any function of mass and velocity is conserved in such an event.[3]\n\nPhysics explanation[edit]\n\nNewton‚Äôs cradle with two balls of equal weight and perfectly efficient elasticity. The left ball is pulled away and let go. Neglecting the energy losses, the left ball strikes the right ball, transferring all the velocity to the right ball. Because they are the same weight, the same velocity indicates all the momentum and energy are also transferred. The kinetic energy, as determined by the velocity, is converted to potential energy as it reaches the same height as the initial ball and the cycle repeats.\n\nAn idealized Newton‚Äôs cradle with five balls when there are no energy losses and there is always a small separation between the balls, except for when a pair is colliding\n\nNewton‚Äôs cradle three-ball swing in a five-ball system. The central ball swings without any apparent interruption.\n\nNewton‚Äôs cradle can be modeled fairly accurately with simple mathematical equations with the assumption that the balls always collide in pairs. If one ball strikes four stationary balls that are already touching, these simple equations can not explain the resulting movements in all five balls, which are not due to friction losses. For example, in a real Newton‚Äôs cradle the fourth has some movement and the first ball has a slight reverse movement. All the animations in this article show idealized action (simple solution) that only occurs if the balls are not touching initially and only collide in pairs.\n\nSimple solution[edit]\n\nThe conservation of momentum (mass √ó velocity) and kinetic energy (1/2 √ó mass √ó velocity2) can be used to find the resulting velocities for two colliding perfectly elastic objects. These two equations are used to determine the resulting velocities of the two objects. For the case of two balls constrained to a straight path by the strings in the cradle, the velocities are a single number instead of a 3D vector for 3D space, so the math requires only two equations to solve for two unknowns. When the two objects weigh the same, the solution is simple: the moving object stops relative to the stationary one and the stationary one picks up all the other‚Äôs initial velocity. This assumes perfectly elastic objects, so there is no need to account for heat and sound energy losses.\n\nSteel does not compress much, but its elasticity is very efficient, so it does not cause much waste heat. The simple effect from two same-weight efficiently elastic colliding objects constrained to a straight path is the basis of the effect seen in the cradle and gives an approximate solution to all its activities.\n\nFor a sequence of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between the two dropped balls, and the action is as follows: the first moving ball that strikes the first stationary ball (the second ball striking the third ball) transfers all its velocity to the third ball and stops. The third ball then transfers the velocity to the fourth ball and stops, and then the fourth to the fifth ball. Right behind this sequence is the second moving ball transferring its velocity to the first moving ball that just stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting the fourth ball right behind the fifth ball with the same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls. If they are simply touching when they strike the third ball, precision requires the more complete solution below.\n\nOther examples of this effect[edit]\n\nThe effect of the last ball ejecting with a velocity nearly equal to the first ball can be seen in sliding a coin on a table into a line of identical coins, as long as the striking coin and its twin targets are in a straight line. The effect can similarly be seen in billiard balls. The effect can also be seen when a sharp and strong pressure wave strikes a dense homogeneous material immersed in a less-dense medium. If the identical atoms, molecules, or larger-scale sub-volumes of the dense homogeneous material are at least partially elastically connected to each other by electrostatic forces, they can act as a sequence of colliding identical elastic balls. The surrounding atoms, molecules, or sub-volumes experiencing the pressure wave act to constrain each other similarly to how the string constrains the cradle‚Äôs balls to a straight line. For example, lithotripsy shock waves can be sent through the skin and tissue without harm to burst kidney stones. The side of the stones opposite to the incoming pressure wave bursts, not the side receiving the initial strike.\n\nWhen the simple solution applies[edit]\n\nFor the simple solution to precisely predict the action, no pair in the midst of colliding may touch the third ball, because the presence of the third ball effectively makes the struck ball appear heavier. Applying the two conservation equations to solve the final velocities of three or more balls in a single collision results in many possible solutions, so these two principles are not enough to determine resulting action.\n\nEven when there is a small initial separation, a third ball may become involved in the collision if the initial separation is not large enough. When this occurs, the complete solution method described below must be used.\n\nSmall steel balls work well because they remain efficiently elastic with little heat loss under strong strikes and do not compress much (up to about 30 Œºm in a small Newton‚Äôs cradle). The small, stiff compressions mean they occur rapidly, less than 200 microseconds, so steel balls are more likely to complete a collision before touching a nearby third ball. Softer elastic balls require a larger separation to maximize the effect from pair-wise collisions.\n\nMore complete solution[edit]\n\nA cradle that best follows the simple solution needs to have an initial separation between the balls that measures at least twice the amount that any one ball compresses, but most do not. This section describes the action when the initial separation is not enough and in subsequent collisions that involve more than two balls even when there is an initial separation. This solution simplifies to the simple solution when only two balls touch during a collision. It applies to all perfectly elastic identical balls that have no energy losses due to friction and can be approximated by materials such as steel, glass, plastic, and rubber.\n\nFor two balls colliding, only the two equations for conservation of momentum and energy are needed to solve the two unknown resulting velocities. For three or more simultaneously colliding elastic balls, the relative compressibilities of the colliding surfaces are the additional variables that determine the outcome. For example, five balls have four colliding points and scaling (dividing) three of them by the fourth gives the three extra variables needed to solve for all five post-collision velocities.\n\nNewtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and stationary action are the different ways of mathematically expressing classical mechanics. They describe the same physics but must be solved by different methods. All enforce the conservation of energy and momentum. Newton‚Äôs law has been used in research papers. It is applied to each ball and the sum of forces is made equal to zero. So there are five equations, one for each ball‚Äîand five unknowns, one for each velocity. If the balls are identical, the absolute compressibility of the surfaces becomes irrelevant, because it can be divided out of both sides of all five equations, producing zero.\n\nDetermining the velocities[4][5][6] for the case of one ball striking four initially-touching balls is found by modeling the balls as weights with non-traditional springs on their colliding surfaces. Most materials, like steel, that are efficiently elastic approximately follow Hooke‚Äôs force law for springs, {\\displaystyle F=k\\cdot x} , but because the area of contact for a sphere increases as the force increases, colliding elastic balls follow Hertz‚Äôs adjustment to Hooke‚Äôs law, {\\displaystyle F=k\\cdot x^{1.5}} . This and Newton‚Äôs law for motion ({\\displaystyle F=m\\cdot a} ) are applied to each ball, giving five simple but interdependent differential equations that are solved numerically. When the fifth ball begins accelerating, it is receiving momentum and energy from the third and fourth balls through the spring action of their compressed surfaces. For identical elastic balls of any type with initially touching balls, the action is the same for the first strike, except the time to complete a collision increases in softer materials. 40% to 50% of the kinetic energy of the initial ball from a single-ball strike is stored in the ball surfaces as potential energy for most of the collision process. Thirteen percent of the initial velocity is imparted to the fourth ball (which can be seen as a 3.3-degree movement if the fifth ball moves out 25 degrees) and there is a slight reverse velocity in the first three balls, the first ball having the largest at ‚àí7% of the initial velocity. This separates the balls, but they come back together just before as the fifth ball returns. This is due to the pendulum phenomenon of different small angle disturbances having approximately the same time to return to the center. When balls are ‚Äútouching‚Äù in subsequent collisions is complex, but still determinable by this method, especially if friction losses are included and the pendulum timing is calculated exactly instead of relying on the small angle approximation.\n\nThe differential equations with the initial separations are needed if there is less than 10 Œºm separation when using 100-gram steel balls with an initial 1 m/s strike speed.\n\nThe Hertzian differential equations predict that if two balls strike three, the fifth and fourth balls will leave with velocities of 1.14 and 0.80 times the initial velocity.[7] This is 2.03 times more kinetic energy in the fifth ball than the fourth ball, which means the fifth ball would swing twice as high in the vertical direction as the fourth ball. But in a real Newton‚Äôs cradle, the fourth ball swings out as far as the fifth ball. To explain the difference between theory and experiment, the two striking balls must have at least ‚âà 10 Œºm separation (given steel, 100 g, and 1 m/s). This shows that in the common case of steel balls, unnoticed separations can be important and must be included in the Hertzian differential equations, or the simple solution gives a more accurate result.\n\nEffect of pressure waves[edit]\n\nThe forces in the Hertzian solution above were assumed to propagate in the balls immediately, which is not the case. Sudden changes in the force between the atoms of material build up to form a pressure wave. Pressure waves (sound) in steel travel about 5 cm in 10 microseconds, which is about 10 times faster than the time between the first ball striking and the last ball being ejected. The pressure waves reflect back and forth through all five balls about ten times, although dispersing to less of a wavefront with more reflections. This is fast enough for the Hertzian solution to not require a substantial modification to adjust for the delay in force propagation through the balls. In less-rigid but still very elastic balls such as rubber, the propagation speed is slower, but the duration of collisions is longer, so the Hertzian solution still applies. The error introduced by the limited speed of the force propagation biases the Hertzian solution towards the simple solution because the collisions are not affected as much by the inertia of the balls that are further away.\n\nIdentically-shaped balls help the pressure waves converge on the contact point of the last ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backward to reflect off the opposite side of the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly 1 ball-diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last contact point because the first wave reflects off the opposite side of the last ball and it meets up at the last contact point with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the second ball. Then the reverberations reflect off the contact point between the second and third balls, but still converge at the last contact point, until the last ball is ejected‚Äîbut it is less of a wavefront with each reflection.\n\nEffect of different types of balls[edit]\n\nUsing different types of material does not change the action as long as the material is efficiently elastic. The size of the spheres does not change the results unless the increased weight exceeds the elastic limit of the material. If the solid balls are too large, energy is being lost as heat, because the elastic limit increases with the radius raised to the power 1.5, but the energy which had to be absorbed and released increases as the cube of the radius. Making the contact surfaces flatter can overcome this to an extent by distributing the compression to a larger amount of material but it can introduce an alignment problem. Steel is better than most materials because it allows the simple solution to apply more often in collisions after the first strike, its elastic range for storing energy remains good despite the higher energy caused by its weight, and the higher weight decreases the effect of air resistance.\n\nUses[edit]\n\nThe most common application is that of a desktop executive toy. Another use is as an educational physics demonstration, as an example of conservation of momentum and conservation of energy. A similar principle, the propagation of waves in solids, was used in the Constantinesco Synchronization gear system for propeller / gun synchronizers on early fighter aircraft.[further explanation needed]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nLarge Newton‚Äôs cradle at American Science and Surplus\n\nThe principle demonstrated by the device, the law of impacts between bodies, was first demonstrated by the French physicist Abb√© Mariotte in the 17th century.[1][8] His work on the topic was first presented to the French Academy of Sciences in 1671; it was published in 1673 as Trait√© de la percussion ou choc des corps (‚ÄúTreatise on percussion or shock of bodies‚Äù).[9]\n\nNewton acknowledged Mariotte‚Äôs work, along with Wren, Wallis and Huygens as the pioneers of experiments on the collisions of pendulum balls, in his Principia.\n\nChristiaan Huygens used pendulums to study collisions. His work, De Motu Corporum ex Percussione (On the Motion of Bodies by Collision) published posthumously in 1703, contains a version of Newton‚Äôs first law and discusses the collision of suspended bodies including two bodies of equal mass with the motion of the moving body being transferred to the one at rest.\n\nThere is much confusion over the origins of the modern Newton‚Äôs cradle. Marius J. Morin has been credited as being the first to name and make this popular executive toy.[citation needed] However, in early 1967, an English actor, Simon Prebble, coined the name ‚ÄúNewton‚Äôs cradle‚Äù (now used generically) for the wooden version manufactured by his company, Scientific Demonstrations Ltd.[10] After some initial resistance from retailers, they were first sold by Harrods of London, thus creating the start of an enduring market for executive toys.[citation needed] Later a very successful chrome design for the Carnaby Street store Gear was created by the sculptor and future film director Richard Loncraine.[citation needed]\n\nThe largest cradle device in the world was designed by MythBusters and consisted of five one-ton concrete and steel rebar-filled buoys suspended from a steel truss.[11] The buoys also had a steel plate inserted in between their two-halves to act as a ‚Äúcontact point‚Äù for transferring the energy; this cradle device did not function well because concrete is not elastic so most of the energy was lost to a heat buildup in the concrete. A smaller scale version constructed by them consists of five 15-centimetre (6 in) chrome steel ball bearings, each weighing 15 kilograms (33 lb), and is nearly as efficient as a desktop model.\n\nThe cradle device with the largest diameter collision balls on public display was visible for more than a year in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the retail store American Science and Surplus (see photo). Each ball was an inflatable exercise ball 66 cm (26 in) in diameter (encased in steel rings), and was supported from the ceiling using extremely strong magnets. It was dismantled in early August 2010 due to maintenance concerns.[citation needed]\n\nIn popular culture[edit]\n\nNewton‚Äôs cradle has been used more than 20 times in movies,[12] often as a trope on the desk of a lead villain such as Paul Newman‚Äòs role in The Hudsucker Proxy, Magneto in X-Men, and the Kryptonians in Superman II. It was used to represent the unyielding position of the NFL towards head injuries in Concussion.[13] It has also been used as a relaxing diversion on the desk of lead intelligent/anxious/sensitive characters such as Henry Winkler‚Äòs role in Night Shift, Dustin Hoffman‚Äòs role in Straw Dogs, and Gwyneth Paltrow‚Äòs role in Iron Man 2. It was featured more prominently as a series of clay pots in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, and as a row of 1968 Eero Aarnio bubble chairs with scantily-clad women in them in Gamer.[14] In Storks, Hunter the CEO of Cornerstore has one not with balls, but with little birds. Newton‚Äôs Cradle is an item in Nintendo‚Äôs Animal Crossing where it is referred to as ‚Äúexecutive toy‚Äù.[15] In 2017, an episode of the Omnibus podcast, featuring Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings and musician John Roderick, focused on the history of Newton‚Äôs Cradle.[16] Newton‚Äôs cradle is also featured on the desk of Deputy White House Communications Director Sam Seaborn in The West Wing.\n\nRock band Jefferson Airplane used the cradle on the 1968 album Crown of Creation as a rhythm device to create polyrhythms on an instrumental track"
