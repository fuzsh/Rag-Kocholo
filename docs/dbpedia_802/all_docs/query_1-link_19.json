Although there is considerable controversy as to the inventor of this device, not many would argue that the name Newton is appropriate for the title. The actual name “Newton’s Cradle” was coined by an English actor named Simon Prebble in 1967. Around this time, his company began to manufacture it as a mere desktop toy.\n\nVarious modifications and designs of this prototype have been devised; however, the concepts for its function are the same. Simple cradles consist of an odd number (5 in this case) of balls consisting of equal mass, shape, size, and uniformity. Smooth metal spheres with uniform density are ideal. These balls are suspended from a frame by two strings or lines of equal length. This two string method constricts the balls to move along a fixed curvilinear path. If calibrated correctly, the balls will barely touch each other at rest, and not deviate from the fixed path when utilized properly. The frame can be made out of almost anything; however, a sturdy material is desired to eliminate sway and warping due to stress.\n\nSo What does Newton's cradle actually do?"
