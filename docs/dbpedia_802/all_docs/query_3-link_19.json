        "text": "In summary, the mass of the balls does not affect the equations for kinetic energy and momentum/impulse as long as all the balls have the same mass and air resistance can be ignored. This is because both kinetic energy and momentum are proportional to the mass, so it can be cancelled or divided out of equations. The difference in impact between the metal and marble balls is due to the difference in their mass, but they both need the same amount of impulse to reach the same height.\n\nRelated to Newton's Cradle same diameter, different mass\n\n1. How does the mass of the balls affect the motion of a Newton's Cradle?\n\nThe mass of the balls in a Newton's Cradle affects the motion by determining the amount of kinetic energy transferred between the balls during a collision. Heavier balls will transfer more energy and therefore result in a more pronounced swinging motion.\n\n2. Why do the balls in a Newton's Cradle have to be the same diameter?\n\nThe balls in a Newton's Cradle must have the same diameter in order to ensure that the collisions between them are perfectly elastic. This means that no energy is lost during the collisions, resulting in a continuous motion of the balls.\n\n3. Can the Newton's Cradle still work if the balls have different masses but the same diameter?\n\nYes, the Newton's Cradle can still work if the balls have different masses but the same diameter. However, the motion may not be as smooth and continuous as when the balls have the same mass.\n\n4. How does the height of the drop affect the motion of a Newton's Cradle with balls of different masses?\n\nThe height of the drop affects the motion of a Newton's Cradle with balls of different masses by determining the amount of potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy during the collision. A higher drop height will result in a greater amount of energy being transferred, resulting in a more pronounced swinging motion.\n\n5. What is the scientific explanation for the movement of a Newton's Cradle with balls of different masses?\n\nThe movement of a Newton's Cradle with balls of different masses can be explained by the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. When one ball is lifted and released, it gains potential energy. As it falls and collides with the other balls, this potential energy is converted into kinetic energy, causing the other balls to move. The collisions between the balls also follow the law of conservation of momentum, where the total momentum of the system remains constant."
