        "meta_description": "Newton's cradle is a device designed to demonstrate conservation of energy in swinging spheres. When one of the spheres is pulled and released, it can be observed to swing. The force transmitted through the other spheres creates a hypnotic movement. And don't be surprised - this is a particularly popular gift in the Science Museum Shop. It might be a great idea to send Newton's Cradle, which brings 17th century science to life, to an aspiring scientist.",
