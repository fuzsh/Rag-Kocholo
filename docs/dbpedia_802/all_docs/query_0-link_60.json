        "text": "QUESTION:Earth rotates on its axis and makes a full 360 degree turn in ~24hrs, so ~ 460 m/sec- if this is the case then if one jumps off the ground for even a split second (kids do all the time) then why does the ground underneath not shift?\n\nANSWER: The simple answer is that the jumper has a horizontal velocity equal to that of the earth and therefore moves forward right in pace with the ground. The complicated answer is that Newton's laws are not valid in a rotating frame of reference, so you do not land exactly where you jumped from. There is a \"fictitious force\" called the Coriolis force which causes an object propelled straight up to not continue straight up and straight back down.\n\nQUESTION:If a particle accelerator machine (like the LHC) was designed to be able to discharge the fast moving particles directly into the atmosphere (after they reached high speed), would observers be able to see, hear or feel anything?\n\nANSWER: If the beam was sufficiently energetic and intense, air molecules would be ionized and would subsequently radiate light. You would probably not hear or feel anything.\n\nQUESTION:Let's say we have planet A and B. Planet A suddenly fly away from planet B at 1/2 the speed of light. Planet B also suddenly fly away from Planet A at a little bit more than 1/2 the speed of light. If we observe from Planet A, we can see Planet B because light travelled from Planet B to Planet A. However, after all the flyings, Planet A and Planet B will be 'separating' from each other at a little bit faster than the speed of light. Does it mean that after a while, observers from Planet A can no longer see Planet B? How does this workkkkk???????? :(\n\nANSWER: For clarity, let us have a third planet D relative to which your experiment happens. So the speed of A relative to D is vA=0.5c and the speed of B relative to D is vB=0.6c let's say. Your assumption is that the speed of A relative to B is 1.1c. (c is the speed of light); that is wrong. In an earlier answer I discussed this kind of problem. The speed v with which A and B each see the other going away is given by v=(vA+vB)/[1+(vAvB/c2)]=1.1c/[1+(0.5x0.6c2/c2)]=0.85c. Not intuitive, but true!\n\nQUESTION:How can a stationary radio receiver set to a particular frequency receive transmissions from a moving transmitter, say, from an aircraft? Why doesn't the movement of the aircraft cause its radio transmission to be off frequency relative to the static receiver?\n\nANSWER: As is also the case for sound waves, the Doppler effect is not noticeable if the speed of the source is very small compared to the speed of the waves. Someone walking toward you and talking does not sound like Mickey Mouse; the receiver here is your ear and it is not sensitive enough to detect the shift. The expression for the shifted frequency f of electromagnetic waves relative to the source frequency f0 is given by f=f0√[(1+β)/(1-β)] where β=v/c and v is the speed of the source and c=3x108 m/s is the speed of light; β>0 is when velocity is toward you. If β is much smaller than 1, it may be shown that the fractional change in frequency is |f-f0|/f0≈β. For example, suppose the source is an airplane with speed 300 m/s (about 700 mph) and the frequency is 90 MHz. Then |f-f0|/f0≈10-6 or the Doppler shift is |f-f0|≈90 Hz. A tuner does not have nearly the sensitivity to detect a 10-4% change in frequency.\n\nQUESTION:If a gun was fired at the escape velocity of the Earth in a direction that it would not hit anything but not straightly up but instead more like in an angle of 45 degrees would the round still go to space? And if not what would the velocity needed be for a round that is fired at 45 degrees in to the sky be in order for the round to escape Earth?\n\nANSWER: First, let's be clear that we are talking about an ideal situation where we neglect the effects of air drag (which will slow the projectile) or earth's rotation (which can add or subtract from the velocity you give the projectile). The easiest way to get the value of the escape velocity (ve) is to use energy conservation. Escape velocity is that velocity which results in the projectile being at rest at r=∞. Taking the potential energy U(r)=-GMm/r+C to be zero at r=∞ (i.e., choose C=0), energy conservation gives ï¿½mve2-GMm/R=0 where M and R are the mass and radius of the earth, respectively; so, ve=√(2MG/R). You will notice that this derivation has been done without any reference to the direction of the velocity ve, so the direction makes no difference.\n\nQUESTION:The famous \"twins paradox\" where each twin sees the other's clock running slower --- but then, when the rocket-twin returns to earth, she finds in reality that it was her clock actually running slower, I know that the answer to this riddle is that the effects of relativity are only happening when the rocket ship is travelling in a straight line at constant speed -- and not during the periods of acceleration or deceleration. But I still don't get it. What's happening during those periods of acceleration? For example, when the rocket ship first starts out, it is accelerating; What's actually happening regarding the aging of the twins during this phase?\n\nANSWER: I really do not think you understand the twin paradox very well; you should go to the FAQ page either here or here. To understand what is going on, nothing need be said about the periods of acceleration; maybe that is what you meant. When you ask about \"ï¿½what's actually happeningï¿½\", it depends on who is measuring elapsed time. On the ship, time passes normally when the ship moves with constant velocity but if you accelerate, it is like being in a gravitational field (equivalence principle) so you would observe clocks to slow down relative to when your velocity was constant. For an observer watching the ship, time runs slower compared to the observer's clock when the velocity is constant; when accelerating, there is instantaneously a normal time dilation due to the velocity at that instant.\n\nQUESTION:in a charged conductor electric field inside it is zero but in a non conducting charged object it is not so why\n\nANSWER: The most important property of a conductor is that some of the electrons in it are free to move. If you try to put an electric field inside a conductor, the electrons will move and they will keep moving until they exactly cancel out the original field. In a nonconducting material, electrons cannot move and so if you put an electric field on it the electrons may move a little but they cannot move enough to nullify the original field. This applies to electrostatics; there can be a field inside a conductor when charges are moving, for example a current-carrying wire.\n\nQUESTION:I know that we now have the ability, with accelerators like the large hadron collider, to accelerate particles very close to light-speed. My question has to do with the mass of these particles at these high speeds; Doesn't the mass approach infinity? And, if so, then wouldn't the gravity be so great as to start to \"suck in\" everything around it? Seems like it would tear the accelerator apart!\n\nANSWER: The reason is that a proton has so little mass to start with, so even if it increases by millions of times it is still very tiny. To see a representative calculation, see an earlier answer.\n\nQUESTION:I was just thinking about the structure of atoms being made of protons, neutrons and electrons. Do you know why atoms even have neutrons if the neutrons are electrically neutral? what is the point of having neutrons? Also, why do they say Pi is squared when it is so obviously round?\n\nANSWER: The neutron almost does not exist. A free neutron outside a nucleus is not stable and will decay to a proton, an electron, and a neutrino in about a half hour. However, it is imperative that there be neutrons because there is no nucleus, except 1H, which consists only of protons. A simple way to look at it is that the nuclear force which protons exert on each other is very strong but, because the protons are so close to each other inside a nucleus, the Coulomb (electrostatic) repulsion is also very strong; so you might think of the neutrons as \"buffers\" which hold the protons far enough apart that the Coulomb force does not get too big. During nucleosynthesis in a star, if a nucleus is formed which has one or two too many protons, it will decay by transforming excess protons into positrons (anti-electrons), neutrons, and neutrinos.\n\nQUESTION:As far as I know the rotational speed of world is decreasing. Regarding the Einstein's theories, does that mean the time on the surface of earth is flowing faster with this decreasing angular speed. Are we having a time loss bevause of this mechanism?\n\nANSWER: Someone standing outside watching the earth rotate will find that your clock runs slower. But, to you, your clock runs at the same rate no matter how you are moving relative to somebody else; so you will not notice any difference in the way your clocks run if your motion relative to somebody else changes, but they will observe a change of your clock rate. If the earth slows down, the day will get longer but the day is not a reliable measure of time, obviously, because if the earth stopped altogether time would not stop.\n\nQUESTION:Why is energy always conserved?\n\nANSWER: It isn't always conserved. Energy is only conserved in an isolated system. An isolated system is one on which no outside forces do work. Work is what changes energy, and if none is done, the energy remains the same.\n\nQUESTION:I am, for the most part, a biologist, but I always have found physics to be a curious subject and used to study it for a year or two. One of my questions that I hope you can answer involves quantum tunnelling. I am familiar with the basic concept of tunnelling; since quantum objects are \"smeared\" over an area, they have a small chance of spontaneously crossing a thin enough barrier. What I am curious about, though, is to what extent this can occur. I have some heard people say that two protons, left to themselves for a long enough time, can spontaneously fuse into a deuteron. I have also heard that, given a long enough time, a car could quantum-tunnel out of its garage, an electron in my fingertip one second could instantly appear at Betelguese the next, or a rock could on incredible timescales behave like a liquid as atoms tunnel out of crystalline strucutres. What I am curious is - is this actually possible? If my understanding is correct, particles can tunnel but only within a restricted area determined by its mass; an electron can go anywhere in a wide circle, a C60 fullerene may tunnel a distance about its own size, and a comparatively large structure like a virus cannot tunnel since the restricted area is less than its actual size. Could you please explain if it is theoretically possible for anything to teleport anywhere given enough time, or if my understanding is correct tunneling becomes impossible after a certain point?\n\nANSWER: I think this violates the site groundrule stipulating \"single, concise, well-focused questions\" but I will touch on a couple of aspects of tunelling. To the right are shown probability distributions\n\nï¿½the first for lowest energy, the second a much higher energyï¿½for a mass on a spring (simple harmonic oscillator, SHO). Classically, when you set the mass in motion, it oscillates between two points equidistant from the equilibrium position; those points are shown by the red lines in the figures. The faster you cause the mass to go (the higher its energy) the greater the distance between the points (we say the greater the amplitude of the oscillation) will be. These are called the turning points and if you ask what the kinetic energy is beyond the turning points, you get a negative value and since kinetic energy is positive definite all the time, this is called the forbidden region. The probability distributions for the classical cases are shown by the green lines and you note that it is most probable to find the mass near the turning points because it is moving slowest there and therefore spends most of its time there. The blue lines show the probabilities for quantum mechanical calculations. If the energy gets very high, the quantum calculation becomes, on average, much like the classical calculation. But at low energies it is very different; the lowest energy state, called the ground state, has the highest probability for the quantum system in the center which is the lowest probability for the classical case. But the most interesting thing is that the quantum calculations predict that there is a probability that the mass will be in the forbidden region and therefore it will spend part of its time there. You can never actually observe the particle there but you can prove that it was there by observing tunneling. Here is my proposed experiment. Looking at the ground state, the amplitude is x=ï¿½1; suppose we design a spring so that it behaves normally as long as x<1.5 but breaks when x=1.5. Then classically we will never see the spring break because the mass never got there. But, quantum mechanics predicts that, if you wait long enough, the spring will suddenly break and the mass will fly away. This is tunneling. Perhaps the most famous example of tunneling is the theory of alpha-particle decay of heavy elements. The graph to the left shows this tunneling, showing the energy plotted as a function of the distance of the alpha particle from the center of a nucleus in which it is bound. The gray area is called the potential barrier the outline of which is simply the potential energy of the alpha particle. To make this more intuitive, the slope of the potential energy represents the force experienced by the particle whose energy here is a little less than 10. Inside the surface of the nucleus, the slope is very large from which we can conclude that the particle is confined to move inside a radius of about 10 fm, and this would be the classical turning point. However, this is a quantum mechanical particle and its probability distribution penetrates into the forbidden zone. But, at larger distances away the force on an alpha particle is very different; because it and the nucleus are both positively charged, an alpha particle outside to the right will be repelled which is what is represented by the gradually decreasing height of the right side of the forbidden region. Because of the nonzero probabilty in the barrier, it is possible to leak out and it doesï¿½that is, alpha decay does occur. But even in this microscopic case, lifetimes are usually very long, millions of years or more.\n\nYour other questions are mostly about macroscopic things. The car is not like a single particle which might be thought of as having a wave function and there is no single force on all the pieces of the car so it becomes about impossible to even think about it. Even if the car did behave like a single particle, it would be so classical that any penetration into the forbidden region would be so small that you would have to wait many universe ages for anything to happen if the car were in its \"in the garage ground state\". Two protons are not going to fuse into a deuteron because charge would not be conserved. An electron in your finger will not appear somewhere far away; you are maybe confusing tunneling with entanglement.\n\nQUESTION:My question concerns a bathroom scale that sits on a tile floor. Does my weight on that scale fluctuate at all when the bathroom is very cold? Very cold is the 40's and 50's. I seem to weigh less when it's particularly cold overnight versus a mild overnight temp.\n\nANSWER: If your scale is mechanical, operates by springs of some sort, the spring constant (k) will depend on the temperature and the weight displayed will depend on the spring constant. The constant k gets larger as the temperature gets lower. Here is the way a spring scale works: When a weight W is placed on a spring with spring constant k, the spring compresses by an amount d, and d=W/k; the scale is calibrated such that a given displacement corresponds to a given weight. If k gets larger, d gets smaller for a given weight so the calibrated scale will read a smaller number than the actual weight. This is probably around a 1% effect, but that would be 2 lb for a 200 lb man. In this scenario, your weight doesn't change, the reading is incorrect.\n\nQUESTION:Why is the permittivity of free space not 1?\n\nANSWER: Note that this constant has units, ε0=8.8542x10-12 C2N-1m-2. The permittivity of free space essentially quantifies the strength of electrostatic forces, F=q1q2/(4πε0r2) for the force between two point charges. But, if you redefine any of the unitsï¿½length, mass, time, chargeï¿½you will change the numerical value of ε0. For example, suppose you define the unit of charge as that charge which when two 1 unit charges are separated by 1 m they exert a force of 1/(4π) N on each other; call that unit of charge 1 Baker (B). Then ε0=1.0 B2N-1m-2.\n\nQUESTION:what changes would occur within earth and to its rotation besides the partial loss of gravitational pull due to moon(because sun is also responsible for the gravitational pull of earth) when there is no moon/or when the moon suddenly vanishes?\n\nANSWER: Certainly the main thing you would notice is that the tides in the oceans would become very much smaller and with different periodicity. There are lots of other more subtle effects like the precession of the earth's axis which would be less noticable in the short term. However, as I note on the site, I do not answer detailed astronomy questions.\n\nQUESTION:My question deals with quantum entangled particles. How common are naturally occurring quantum entangled particles? How would you identify a single particle as being part of an entangled pair?\n\nANSWER: I believe the role entanglement plays in nature is pretty much up to speculation so there is really no information about how common it is. Some people think that entanglement of many more than two particles is how we will eventually understand the connections between quantum physics and classical physics. It seems to me that if you find a particle there is no way to determine whether it is entangled with another particle (or other particles) without knowing how it was initially prepared.\n\nQUESTION:I have read that when a pair of particles are entangled their spin is correlated making the particle have opposite spin. Is this also true of the charges of subatomic particles.\n\nANSWER: No. Electric charge is not a property which lends itself to entanglement because there is no way to have a mixed wavefunction part positive and part negative electric charge.\n\nQUESTION:My question pertains to the periodic table of elements. Why is tungsten represented with the letter W? I am assuming that the letter W was the first letter of the person's name who discovered the element- is this correct?\n\nANSWER: The word tungsten comes from the Swedish, tung sten=heavy stone. The symbol W comes from the word wolfram which comes from the mineral wolframite which is the ore which is the principle type of tungsten ore. The word wolframite comes from the words wolf rahm=wolf soot or wolf cream because wolframite interfered with the smelting of tin and was said to \"devour\" the tin (like a wolf)! Since both tungsten and wolfram come from the Swedish, you might wonder why it was not given the symbol T. It turns out that a mineral Sheelite was called tungsten in Sweden and so they chose to call it wolfram to avoid confusion. Credit for discovery of the element goes to two Spanish brothers, Jose and Fausto Elhuyar, who isolated it from an acid made from wolframite in 1783.\n\nQUESTION:Is time dilation possible for objects moving at high speed on the ground. Or, is altitude central to the phenomenon.\n\nANSWER: The altitude is irrelevant. All that matters is the velocity of the clock relative to you. (Actually, altitude does matter a little bit because there is also a gravitational time dilation where clocks in a gravitational field run at rates which depend on the strength of the field. But I think you are interested in normal time dilation which depends on speed. It turns out that both kinds of time dilation must be included in the software for GPS devices to get the necessary accuracy.)\n\nQUESTION:As far as I understand it, Gravity is measured in units of 'Newtons', however does such information exist with regards to relatable gravitational forces for bodies within our own solar system (i.e. Where Earth would be 1 and Mars 0.5, for example)?\n\nANSWER: Gravity is a force and may be measured in Newtons (SI system of units) or pounds (English system of units); 1 Newton=0.225 pounds. I do not really understand what your question is asking. If you need to find the force on, say, a 1 kg object at the surface of a planet, you can use the equation W=MG/R2 where W is the weight (AKA the force the planet exerts on the 1 kg), M is the mass of the planet, R is the radius of the planet, and G=6.67x10-11 N∙m2/kg is the universal constant of gravitation. W will be in Newtons (N) if M is in kilograms (kg) and R is in meters (m). For example, Wearth=6x1024x6.67x10-11/(6.4x106)2=9.8 N and WMars=6.4x1023x6.67x10-11/(3.4x106)2=3.7 N. So, if you want to quantify earth with 1 unit of gravity, Mars has 3.7/9.8=0.38 units. Be sure to note that the force of gravity depends on where you are; if you go to a distance r, greater than R, from the center of the planet, you find that the force of gravity on 1 kg is given by MG/r2.\n\nQUESTION:This is one of the most baffling physics questions so far. Suppose a cyclist is pedalling briskly, thus accelerating forward. He exerts force on the tyres, the tyres exert force on the ground, and the ground exerts a reaction force which accelerates the cyclist. Right? But now the cyclist applies brakes. Now he starts to retards. But since the tyres are still moving in the same direction, hence friction must also be acting in the same direction. Then which force is responsible for the retardation? I suppose the brakes cannot retard the 'cyclist and the cycle' system, since it is an internal force.\n\nANSWER: There is nothing \"baffling\" here. You are right, all internal forces should be ignored if you want to understand the motion of the bicycle. The only external forces on the cycle and its rider are its own weight, the normal force up from the road on the wheels, and the frictional force between the road and the wheels. (I am neglecting internal friction and air drag.) The first of these two add to zero (assuming a horizontal road) and can be ignored for our purpose. If the acceleration is forward, the friction if forward. If the acceleration is backward, the friction if backward. The direction of the friction is not determined by the motion of the wheels because the wheels are not slipping on the road (you hope) so static friction, not kinetic friction, is responsible for the acceleration. It is friction which speeds you up or slows you down.\n\nQUESTION:I have a question about particles/waves that travel at the speed of light. When a light bulb emits light, does the light come into being already travelling at the speed of light or does it accelerate up to the speed of light? Is there a period of time where the light is actually traveling slower than the speed of light? If there is a period of time where it is accelerating, where does it get the energy from?\n\nANSWER: In a vacuum, the speed of light is never slower than c=3x108 m/s. It never accelerates. When light travels through a material, say glass, it travels more slowly but instantaneously changes to c when it exits. But, its energy does not change when it \"speeds up\" because energy is determined by frequency and the frequency does not change when it enters a material.\n\nQUESTION:Consider a tug of war game. is the net work the ground on the two teams is negative, positive or zero?\n\nANSWER: Just after one team has won, all players are moving. They have a kinetic energy. Therefore positive work was done on the whole system by friction with the ground. Once everyone stops moving, the net work done on the system would have been zero.\n\nQUESTION:Why is that the heavy things do not bounce much as compared to lighter things though acc. to Newton's law of action and reaction the force exerted on floor by heavier objects is much than that of lighter objects??\n\nANSWER: First of all, the reason you state for expecting the larger mass to bounce higher is flawed. Although the larger mass will experience a larger force when it hits the floor, it is also a larger mass and therefore harder to accelerate. Newton's second law tells you that the acceleration depends both on force and mass. The only thing that determines how high something will bounce is the elastic properties of the floor and the bouncing object.\n\nQUESTION:I am wondering about some physics in an imaginary underwater habitat: A 100 m tall moon pool is placed underwater, open at bottom but else closed, and filled with air. Open entrance is placed on 200 m water depth. What would the air pressure be at the top compared to bottom?\n\nANSWER: I did not know what a moon pool is. There is a wikepedia article on moon pools. There are several kinds, but the questioner asks about one where the whole tank is submerged with the bottom open. The pressure 200 m below the surface of the water is determined approximately by a rule of thumb that each 10 m depth increases the pressure by about 1 atmosphere, so the pressure at 200 m is about 21 atmospheres. The air pressure in the moon pool would have to be 21 times atmospheric pressure to keep the water at the bottom. The pressure at the top would be about the same because there is not much pressure change over 100 m in a gas.\n\nQUESTION:Why is the probability of splitting an atom greater when sending slow neutrons rather than fast through the nucleus in fission reactors?\n\nANSWER: If a neutron and a fissile nucleus interact, there is a probability, not a certainty, that a fission will occur. A slow neutron will spend much more time interacting with the nucleus and therefore the likelihood of a fission happening is greater than for a fast neutron which spends less time interacting.\n\nQUESTION:how can a skydiver control her terminal velocity by changing shape?\n\nANSWER: The force of air drag can be approximated as F≈ï¿½Av2 where A is the area presented to the onrushing air and v is the speed of the object. (This is correct only for SI units.) The terminal velocity occurs when this force is equal to the weight, mg=ï¿½Avterminal2 , so vterminal=2√(mg/A). So if she points her body toward the ground like a diver she has small A and goes faster or if she spreads her arms and legs out in spread-eagle fashion she has large A and goes slower.\n\nQUESTION:If you where hanging a 35lb piece of pipe with one end in a hanger is the weight your lifting at the other end of the pipe 35lb?\n\nANSWER: If the pipe is of uniform thickness, you and the hanger would each hold up half the weight.\n\nQUESTION:How can a fast moving physical ship with a slow ticking clock get to Andromeda 89 thousand times faster than light, as you claim?... 28 years on the ship's slow clock but 2.5 million Earth orbits around the Sun, just for a \"reality check.\"\n\nANSWER: Where do I claim that? I do not know what you are talking about.\n\nREPLY: So sorry! I mistook your site for Dave Goldberg's site, Ask *a* Physicist, where I read his claim awhile back on his \"We Can Make It to the Edge of the Observable Universe in a Few Decades\" article/blog. I take it that you do not agree with him.\n\nANSWER: OK, I found Goldberg's site and everything he says is perfectly correct. In fact, I found a similar answer on my site which we can use for comparison. The speed which Goldberg uses is 99.9999999999999999998% of c. In my calculation I used a very fast speed but much slower than his, 99.999% of c. When I calculated the elapsed time on the ship I got about 11,000 years, he got only 28 years. My ship was going the same speed the whole time but his started from rest and was constantly accelerating, so he would have gotten a smaller time yet if his ship had been going with a constant speed the whole time; if the Goldberg space ship had been going 0.999999999999999999998c the whole way, it would get to Andromeda in about an hour, its time! Your problem, I think, is how either his or mine could be right since it takes 2.5 million years for light to travel that distance, right? But, it depends on who is measuring the time. An observer on earth will see the light take 2.5 million years to get there and the space ships arrive just a little (compared to 2.5 million years) later. But an observer on the space ships will see a greatly shortened distance to Andromeda, so he will observe both himself and light to take a much shorter time to get there, the light always just beating the space ship. You are right, nothing can travel faster than light, but everybody sees the same light speed in their own frame; there is no contradiction in saying one observer sees light taking 2.5 million years to travel between two points in space while another observer sees light as taking 10 years to travel between the same two points.\n\nQUESTION:Why transverse waves cannot travel in air and interior of liquids even though they can travel in solids where particles are strongly packed together?\n\nANSWER: A wave requires that there be restoring forces between atoms of the medium. For longitudinal waves to happen, there must be such restoring forces with atoms along the direction the wave is traveling; this can happen with solids, liquids, or gases and essentially the waves are pressure waves. For transverse waves, there must be restoring forces perpendicular to the direction of the wave velocity (often called \"shear forces\") and liquids and gases cannot support such shear.\n\nQUESTION: Trying to understand physics concepts is an interest of mine. I was hoping you could shed some light to help my understanding? The equation for Kinetic Energy: KE = 1/2 m v2. I understand the value of velocity squared in that; the kinetic energy of an object is proportional to its speed squared:double the speed, quadruple the KE. But I am having trouble with why and what the 1/2 value is telling me about what is going on in the equation as to the motion of mass and speed. It is pretty elementary stuff but if I want to know about Energy, Work, Power and Heat I need to get the basics right.\n\nANSWER: To do this on the simplest level, you need to know kinematics for uniform acceleration [x=x0+v0t+½at2 and v=v0+at where the 0 subscripts denote the position and velocity when t=0] and Newton's second law [F=ma]. Suppose that you have a constant force F that you exert on a mass m over a distance s; the work done is W=Fs and work changes the energy; that is, we say that the work done equals the energy given to m. I will assume that m begins at rest and at the origin, so x=s=½at2 and a=v/t; then F=mv/t and s=½(v/t)t2=½vt. Finally, W=Fs=(mv/t)(½vt)=½mv2. So, in the case of a constant force, the factor of ½ comes from the ½at2 part of the kinematic equation for position.\n\nEXTRA ANSWER: If you know calculus, this is much simpler. Write dW=Fdx and F=m(dv/dt) so W=0∫sFdx=0∫sm(dv/dt)dx=0∫vm(dx/dt)d\n\nv=0∫vmvdv=½mv2; and this does not require F to be constant.\n\nQUESTION:why do we need to have a new expression for calculating the kinetic energy of a body that is in rotational as well as translational motion?\n\nANSWER: Whether you do or not depends partly on how the object is moving. For example, if the object is rolling on a surface without slipping, it is instantaneously rotating about the point (or line) of contact and you can write K=½Iω2 where I is the moment of inertia about that axis; however, you could also show (using the parallel axis theorem) that K=½Mvcm2+½Icmωcm2 where vcm is the speed of the center of mass, ωcm is the angular velocity about the center of mass (which is the same as ω) and Icm is the moment of inertia through the center of mass. For an object not rolling, K=½Mvcm2+½Icmωcm2 is still the correct expression for kinetic energy at any instant but you can no longer write the kinetic energy as pure rotation as you could for the rolling object because there is no relationship between vcm and ωcm.\n\nQUESTION:In the TV-series Stargate SG-1 a Goa'Uld Ha'Tak is capable of going 50% lightspeed with sublight engines. Wouldn't these kinds of speeds already be relativistic and what happens excactly to the crew in the ship when the relativistic effects start? And what is the minimum relativistic speed in which relativistic effects become noticeable? A friend of mine said that at 8% lightspeed relativity kicks in making space travel above 8% lightspeed really challenging.\n\nANSWER: Where you need to start doing calculations relativistically depends on how accurate you want to be. The factor which determines the magnitude of relativistic effects is usually γ=√(1-β2) where β is the ratio of the speed to the speed of light. For example if β=0.1, 10% the speed of light, then γ=0.995 which would mean only about 0.5% error using nonrelativistic calculations. For β=0.5, 50% the speed of light, γ=0.\n\n867, still only about 13% error. But, there are no \"relativistic effects\" for somebody on the ship; everything appears normal on the ship. They would, however, see distances to objects toward which they are traveling shrink. I do not know what it means that \"space travel…[is] really challenging\". Of course, it is challenging to get to relativistic speeds in the first place, but I do not see any hazards \"kicking in\" at β=0.08.\n\nQUESTION:Hi! I was playing a video game called \"Mass Effect 2\" and in the game a drill instructor gives a lesson about the main gun of a Mount Everest class dreadnought that is the first dreadnought class made by largest human government in ME universe known as Systems Alliance. The main gun is a rail gun that accelerates one 20kg ferrous slug to 4025 km/s and it takes 5 seconds to charge. The slug impacts with kinetic energy of 162006250000000 joules which is 38,7 kt of tnt. The main gun is 800 meters long and built into the superstructure of 888 meter long dreadnought that has mass of at least one milloin tons. Would there be any problems of having our future warships operating in space equipped with this kind of weapon and does this design sound feasible? And in the game's lore it is stated that an impact from this weapon levels entire cityblocks. Would this projectile moving at 4025km\\s be able to level a cityblock in a metropolitan area because the Turians (a species in Mass Effect) fired these slugs to human cities on the colony of Shanxi leveling a cityblock clean of even the sturdiest skyscrapers.\n\nANSWER: Gamers and sci-fiers have asked questions like this before. That is good, to think about the physics and how it might affect the practicability of these kinds of weapons in the real world. You might also be interested in a couple of earlier answers regarding the game Halo and the movie Eraser. Your numbers are right, the kinetic energy of a 20 kg mass traveling at a speed around 4x106 m/s is about 1.6x1014 J. (The speed is just a little above 1% the speed of light, so classical calculations should be ok.) As I noted in the Eraser answer, the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki was about 1014 J, so this should answer your question about whether or not there is adequate energy to demolish a city blockï¿½easily!\n\nIt takes 5 s to charge, so let's see what the required power input would be: P=E/t=1.6x1014/5≈3x1013 W=30 TW. The average power consumption of the entire earth is 15 TW. Where are you going to get this kind of power in the middle of empty space? Maybe you can just carry hundreds of atomic bombs with you?\n\nAnd, let's talk about the launch. If the acceleration over the 800 m is uniform, it would take about 4x10-4 s resulting in an acceleration of 1010 m/s2. That means that the force necessary to give this acceleration to a 20 kg mass is 2x1011 N≈45 billion pounds. Do you think an iron slug could withstand such a force?\n\nGiven the time of acceleration, what is the power delivered to the slug? P=E/t=1.6x1014/4x10-4 s≈4x1017 W.\n\nUnlike the previous two answers, recoil for this gun should not be a serious problem. If the mass of the ship is a million metric tons, 109 kg, the recoil velocity should only be about 20x4x106/109=8 cm/s.\n\nI think you would agree that this device would be totally unworkable in the real world.\n\nADDED COMMENT: In my comment above stating that recoil would not be a problem, I have to take that back. Even though 8 cm/s is not very fast, that speed is acquired in a very short time, 4x10-4 s, so the acceleration of the ship is very large, a=0.08/4x10-4=200 m/s2 which is approximately 20g, quite a jolt!\n\nQUESTION:When two objects with mass are placed together, do they actually ever touch or is there a space between the objects on a microscopic level?\n\nANSWER: It gets tricky to define what you mean by \"touch\". When you get to a microscopic level, there is no way to actually define what the surface is, it is fuzzy rather than sharp. The surface is comprised of the outer electrons of the atoms and these are charged; hence they repel each other and since the electric repulsion gets greater as the electrons get closer, you might think of the upper object \"floating\" above the lower. It is actually something called the \"electron degeneracy pressure\", the Pauli exclusion principle which prevents electrons from occupying the same quantum state, which keep the electrons apart.\n\nQUESTION:I can not replicate a photoelectric experiment where I place a cylinder made out of zinc that leads to #10 copper wire to 2 aluminum foil leaves. I shine a flashlight on the zinc cylinder and the aluminum leaves will not split. How can I properly make this experiment work? Please note that I can bring an object charged with static electricity close to the zinc cylinder and it does make the aluminum leaves spread. I am however trying to use light instead. Do I need a different kind of light?\n\nANSWER: The photons in visible light do not have enough energy. Try ultraviolet light.\n\nQUESTION:How many particles do the particle accelerators at most accelerate when they are running experiments? One, ten, hundreds or thousands?\n\nANSWER: When I was doing experiments some years ago, typical beam currents were on the order of a few nanoamperes. Usually, these were protons which each have a charge of 1.6x10-19 C. So, suppose the beam current is 16 nA=16x10-9 C/s; then the number current is [16x10-9 C/s]/[1.6x10-19 C/proton]=1011 protons/second, about 100 billion. At the LHC in Europe, the intensity is much larger, on the order of 4x1018 protons/s which would correspond to an average current of about 0.6 A. The high number intensities are vital because the events physicists are looking for are extremely improbable. The LHC is a pulsed machine, its beam is a series of very short pulses. So, the instantaneous current during a pulse is much larger than the average current.\n\nQUESTION:Given a airplane at speed 600 knots, whose track at its closest point passes by one at 15 kilometers away (elevation angle not important,) what are the formulas that would describe the shape of the decibel readings over time? (which are something like 25 25 40 40 40 38 36 34 30 25 25, with 25 dbA being the background.)\n\nANSWER: I will call the distance of closest approach (15 km) d, the speed (600 knot=0.309 km/s) v, the distance between the plane and observer r, and choose t=0 to be the time of closest approach. Assuming that the sound from the plane is isotropic (a relatively poor assumption), the intensity of the sound is proportional to 1/r2=1/(d2+v2t2), so I(t)=C/(d2+v2t2); note that this is not dB but something like watts/m2. I is an absolute intensity (power/unit area), dB levels measure relative levels on a logarithmic scale. I will call the maximum intensity I0=C/d2 and the dB level relative to the maximum is given by LdB=10∙log10(I/I0)=10∙log10(d2/(d2+v2t2)). The graph to the right shows the plot for your numbers.\n\nQUESTION:Underpinning so many theories in physics is time. Within physics itself is there a theory about time? It seems to me that time is just something that is a fabrication that can be expressed on either side of an equation, despite that time has an \"arrow\" that only goes in one direction. There is no solid evidence to the contrary. Is this a physics problem or a philosophical one?\n\nANSWER: I have heard or read many eminent theoretical physicists who state something like \"we would understand nature much better if we understood what time is\". There is a recent book by Lee Smolin, Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe, which addresses the nature of time. It is written for a lay audience but if you are not a physicist you might find parts of it tough going.\n\nQUESTION:is work energy theorem valid in non inertial frames?\n\nANSWER: The work-energy theorem says that the change in kinetic energy of an object is equal to the work all forces do on it. Imagine that you are in an accelerating rocket ship in empty space, a noninertial frame. You have a ball in your hand and you let go of it. You observe this ball to accelerate opposite the direction in which the ship is accelerating and therefore see its kinetic energy change. But, there are no forces acting on it so no work is done. Another way you could come to this conclusion is that the work-energy theorem is a result of Newton's laws and Newton's laws are not valid in noninertial frames. You can, though, force the work-energy theorem to be valid if you introduce fictitious forces, a way to force Newton's laws to work in noninertial frames. (Centrifugal force is an example of a fictitious force.) If you invent a force on the objects of mass m in the accelerating (a) rocket ship above of Ffictitious=-ma, this force will appear to do the work equal to the change in kinetic energy.\n\nQUESTION:if a laser beam is a stream of photons concentrated in a narrow direction, how come we can see it from aside?\n\nANSWER: You can only see it if some of the photons scatter off something in their path—dust or smoke in the air, for example.\n\nQUESTION:What would happen if an extremely red hot nickle ball was placed in a vacuum?\n\nANSWER: It would cool by radiation. When it reached the point where it was absorbing the same amount of radiation energy from its surroundings as it was radiating itself, it would remain at that constant temperature.\n\nQUESTION:First, how much energy (in the most basic sense) does a car expend driving at a moderate speed for one mile. Next, how big would a spring have to be (roughly) to store the energy equivalent of what that car expended during that mile.\n\nANSWER: I can only do a rough estimate. Suppose your car has an internal combustion engine and gets 40 mpg. The energy content of 1 gallon of gasoline is about 120 MJ, so you would use about 120/40=3 MJ of energy per mile. But, a typical engine has only about 20% efficiency, so the energy supplied to the car is only about 0.2x3=0.6 MJ=600,000 J. Now, you want to store that much energy in a spring. For a spring, the energy stored is ½kx2 where x is the amount by which it is compressed (or stretched) and k is the spring constant which is determined by how stiff the spring is. (The constant k can be measured by k=F/x where F is the force you have to exert to stretch or compress it by x.) Clearly, the bigger k is the less the spring will have to be compressed to store a given amount of energy. The coil spring of a car, a pretty stiff spring, has a typical spring constant of k≈25,000 N/m, so to store 600,000 J of energy, 600,000≈½∙25,000x2 or x≈7 m! I do not see much possibility of having a spring powered car. You probably had in mind a spiral spring like a watch spring, but to store that much energy in any kind of spring is going to be impractical.\n\nFOLLOWUP QUESTIONS:Thanks for helping me with that. I will admit that I'm still a little unclear about the answer though. You are correct that I am wondering about a spring powered car but I definitely would not use a spiral spring. A compression spring would probably work best. I don't understand your final answer. I am getting lost in the spring conversion formula. What does the final answer mean in layman's terms please?\n\nANSWER: The spring would have to be compressed by 7 meters. That would mean that it would need to be at least twice that long, about 40 feet! You could use a stiffer spring (see below) to get a smaller required compression, but imagine the force you would have to exert to compress it. Keep in mind that you would have to supply the energy to the spring in the first place, a lot of energy. I know this spring is not going to work, but how much force would it take to hold it compressed by 7 m? F=kx=25,000x7=175,000 N≈40,000 lb. Another issue is that as the spring unstretches, the force it exerts gets smaller, so you would need to have some kind of governor mechanism to deliver the energy smoothly.\n\nCONTINUEDAlso, there are two things that are working in favor of the feasibility of the spring car:\n\nI know from researching that there are many other factors that affect the gas- to engine- to -transmission to -wheels to- road, etc cycle so that the total efficiency of the entire loop would be far less than 20%.\n\nANSWER: This is taken care of by the fact that I have specified the miles per gallon for the hypothetical car. The miles per gallon you get is determined by how well you have minimized the effects other than engine efficiency, mainly frictional effects. You asked for an estimate of the energy which the car would use to keep going a constant speed, and this is the best way I can think of doing that. Here is another way to estimate the energy consumed: suppose that I push on the car to keep it going a constant speed. I could probably do that with a force of about 100 lb≈445 N; one mile is about 1600 m, so the work I do is the product of the force times the distance and the work I do is the energy I use: W=445x1600≈712,000 J. (Actually, I am pretty impressed by how close this is to my other estimate of 600,000 J! It's just an accident that they are so close, but good that they are of the same order of magnitudeï¿½it increases my confidence that the energy consumed is pretty well approximated.)\n\nCONTINUED\n\nDespite my very basic and incomplete understanding of the formulas that give exact measurements for potential energy in springs and the potential energy available in compressed air it is obvious to me that if a car can run 300 miles off of a bottle of compressed air and a compressed air driven motor (these cars already exist and are in production in places like holland, india, etc) then a large spring perhaps three feet long and two feet around with a wire diameter of over half an inch could at least do the same. Getting the potential energy out of the spring in a useful way to power the car is another ball of wax altogether though.\n\nANSWER: If you want a 3 ft long spring, about 1 m, the most you could probably compress it is about a half meter. To store 600,000 J of energy, the equation would be 600,000=½kx2=½k(0.5)2=k/8, and so the spring constant would be k=4,800,000 N/m. Then the force to hold it at 0.5 m would be F=kx=2,400,000 N≈540,000 lb. If you were not faced with such enormous forces, like if you just wanted to have a toy car go a few meters, you could certainly get the energy out of the spring with a cleverly designed gear box; but the structural problems you would face with forces of hundreds of thousands of pounds would be insurmountable, I believe.\n\nQUESTION:How can time exist in space if time is a man made tool we created to monitor the revolution of our earth around our own star? Once you left this solar system time would have no concept. you wouldn't be able to monitor it would you? How can Einsteins theory of relativity be real if time doesn't exist in space. He says that (earth time) passes slower for an object travelling at the speed of light through space, but how can you monitor that on a clock (still on earth time) in space where time doesn't exist? Our sun is not the centre of our galaxy, it's not even the centre of our universe so the way we control time would not make a difference at any other point in space, An object travelling at the speed of light would still be in the same moment as us but there watch wouldn't be correct as the time it showed would be useless to there point in space.\n\nANSWER: You are totally off base here. Measurement of time has nothing whatever to do with the motion of the earth. You may think of it that way and ancient man certainly thought of it that way, but today the second is defined in terms of an atomic clock which would tick at the same rate anywhere in the universe. The official definition of the second is: \"The second is the duration of 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom.\" If I have an atomic clock and you have an identical atomic clock which you take on a high-speed trip away from and back to me, when you return we will find that your clock ticked fewer times than mine. (See the twin paradox.)\n\nQUESTION: This video states, at the end, that photons do not experience time or distance. Proof?\n\nANSWER: This kind of statement always kinda drives me nuts. A photon does not have a point of view, cannot \"experience\" anything; it is an inanimate thing. But it has even less of a point of view than a proton or any other particle with mass because it is physically impossible to carry a clock or a meter stick along with it, so how could it possibly experience time or space?\n\nQUESTION:can u explain me use of earths mass in kepler's third law\n\nANSWER: The force F between the earth and the sun is F=K/r2 where r is the separation, K=GMsunMearth, G is Newton's universal constant of gravitation, and the M are the masses. Kepler's third law states that T2=4πμa3/K where T is the period of the orbit, a=K/(2E) is the semimajor axis of the orbit, and μ=MearthMsun/(\n\nMearth+Msun) is the reduced mass of the two-body system. So, the earth's mass enters through μ, a, and K. It turns out that if Mearth<<Msun, the period is approximately independent of the mass of the earth. You might be interested in earlier answers which explore Kepler's laws in more detail.\n\nQUESTION:Is there something wrong with the theory that says, if there is enough dead matter from dying stars that comes together, gravity will take over and eventually produce a new star from this dead matter? I am aware that stars form from hydrogen, but what if 999 trillion tons of the heaviest known elements got together all in one place? Most say a star would not form because there is no hydrogen, but what then? It would appear that gravity, being indiscriminate, will continue crunching this big iron ball until critical mass is surpassed, regardless of what the result might end up being. What would that result be?\n\nANSWER: As I state on the site, I usually do not do astronomy/astrophysics/cosmology questions, so take my answer here with a grain of salt. But, sometimes the question is sufficiently interesting to me that I attempt an answer. I would say that a \"normal star\" might be defined as an object which makes energy by nuclear fusion, fusing light nuclei to heavier nuclei. However, when you reach iron on the periodic table you no longer gain energy by fusing nuclei and therefore the energy production ceases. Before the whole star becomes iron, though, other instabilities cause the star to, in one way or another, end its life, the details depending on the mass of the particular star. The most dramatic end is a supernova (of which there are several types, again depending on details), a very dramatic explosion of the whole star; the energy from such an event is what is generally thought to be responsible for creation of heavier elements beyond iron. One possible end following a supernova explosion is called a neutron star. The remnants of the star, mostly heavy elements like you refer to, will undergo gravitational collapse and, in essence, electrons will be pushed into protons such that the star is made mostly of neutrons and is extraordinarily dense (it is essentially a giant nucleus). With sufficient mass, that is what I believe would happen to your collection of heavy elements. However, your number, about 1018 kg, is way too small for the requisite mass. Neutron stars have about 1.4-3.2 solar masses and the mass of the sun is about 2x1030 kg.\n\nQUESTION:In the case of a block that's dropped some vertical distance onto a spring, it's reasonably easy to compute this value & to find the KE of the mass just before it hits the spring, hence the velocity. What doesn't ever seem to be explained is what happens to the block's acceleration (\"g\" when it hits the spring). The motion of the block continues downward, but now the net force is Fnet = kx - Weight = ma, not Fnet = mg. This means that the acceleration continues to be positive as the block compresses the spring, but @ a slower rate. This also means that the velocity continues to increase until all the block's PE is converted to spring elastic energy (Eelastic). At maximum compression the block stops & motion ceases. Since the ideal spring is massless there are no losses due to friction, heat, sound, et. al. Where does the Vmax occur? It's hard imagine for Vmax to happen @ the instant it stops? Is this process for the spring's resisting force linear?\n\nANSWER: OK, suppose the speed when it hits the spring is v0. Choosing +y to be up and y=0 at the end of the uncompressed spring, may=-mg+k(-y). (Note that when the spring is compressed its force is upward and y<0 so the force is in the +y direction; this is why I write the force of the spring as k(-y). Now, until y=-mg/k, the acceleration is negative (points down) and the mass is still speeding up; below that point, the net force is positive (points up) so the mass slows down. Therefore the greatest velocity will be at y=-mg/k. Note that this position would be the equilibrium position if you gently placed m on the spring. You could also get this answer with energy conservation; using the same coordinate system, E=½mv02=½mv2+½ky2+mgy. This can be rearranged to give v2=-(k/m)y2-2gy+v02; if you differentiate this with respect to y and set equal to zero, you find y=-mg/k for the maximum velocity position. At that position you can solve for the speed, v=√[(mg2/k)+v02].\n\nThe key here is that you need to be very careful with the coordinate system and the signs of forces and potential energies. If you do not choose +y up, the potential energy will not be mgy (it would be -mgy). If you do not choose the unstretched spring as zero potential energy for the spring, ½ky2 will not be the potential energy.\n\nQUESTION:I have a question, when you drop a solid sphere of aluminum into a bucket of water sitting on the ground. The buoyant force equals the weight of the water displaced, which is less than the weight of the sphere, so it sinks to the bottom. If you take the bucket with you on an elevator that accelerates upward, the apparent weight of the water increases and the buoyant force on the sphere increases, too. Could the acceleration of the elevator be great enough to make the sphere pop up out of the bucket of water?\n\nANSWER: The easiest way to understand this problem is to use the equivalence principle which says, briefly, that there is no way you can distinguish between being in a uniformly accelerated frame and being in a uniform gravitational field. Your case is a little more complicated since you are in an accelerated frame which is in a gravitational field. But the equivalence principle says that if you elevator has an acceleration a, all experiments you might do would have the same results as if you were not accelerating but in a field whose acceleration was g+a. But, if you were in a gravitational field with acceleration g+a, the weight of the displaced water would be Mw(g+a) and the weight of the aluminum would be Ma(g+a) where Ma and Mw are the masses of the aluminum and displaced water, respectively. In other words, the weight and buoyant force increase proportionately so that the buoyant force would always be smaller than the weight.\n\nQUESTION:A newsday article \"For safety's sake\" was about the backseat bullet. They said that in a 35 mph front-end crash, a 30 pounds child in the back is hurled forward with equivalent force of more than 2000 pounds. Can you please tell me the steps to get to that answer.\n\nANSWER: A statement like this is total nonsense. Anybody who knows anything about physics knows that you cannot associate a force with a speed. To understand why, see my FAQ page, here and here.\n\nQUESTION:If I wear earmuffs that lower the noise by 20 decibels and then put on earplugs that lower the noise by another 20 decibels will this all combine to 40db noise reduction?\n\nANSWER: The relative decibel level L is determined by the ratio of the power levels of two different levels: L=10∙log10(P1/P0). This can be written as P1=10L/10P0. In your case, I will say that P1>P2>P3 and the relative dB levels are 20 dB for P1 and P2 and 20 dB for P2 and P3. So, P1\n\n=1020/2P2=100P2 and P2=1020/2P3=100P3. If you combine these you find that P1=10,000P3=1040/10P3. So, the answer to your question is yes, 40 dB is the relative decibel level for P3 and P1.\n\nQUESTION:If two bulbs one of 60 watt and other of 100 watt are connected in series then 100 watt will glow more but I don't Know why?\n\nANSWER: If the power rating of a bulb is P, this means that P watts are consumed if a voltage of 120 volts is across it, so P=IV=I2R=V2/R=1202/R, so R=1.44x104/P. So, the resistance of each bulb is R100=144 Ω and R60=240 Ω. When in series, the same current passes through each and so the power is P=I2R. It looks to me like the 60 watt bulb will be brighter because its resistance is larger. For example, if the voltage were still 120 V, the current would be I=120/(144+240)=0.313 A. The powers would then be P100=(0.313)2x144=14.1 W for the 100 watt bulb and P60=(0.313)2x240=23.4 W for the 60 watt bulb.\n\nQUESTION:In many popular books and videos that attempt to explain Special and General Relativity I noticed that they all mentioned(so far) that there was no test to determine whether a person inside a box moving at a uniform acceleration could distinguish between the force they experience as either gravity or uniform acceleration. You probably know where I'm going with this. But one can test the difference from inside the box. If the box is sitting on the Earth there would be a \"gravity gradient\" in the box. What you weigh at the floor of the box would be different than if you weighed yourself close to ceiling. In an accelerating box absent any gravitational forces you would weigh the same anywhere inside the box. Is this a valid observation? I wonder why the lecturer or writer leaves this out? Is there something I'm missing?\n\nANSWER: It is generally understood that the equivalence principle states that uniform acceleration is indistinguishable from a uniform gravitational field. Admittedly, many authors neglect to say this explicitly since mostly we think of the gravitational field on earth as uniform even though, as you point out, that is only an excellent approximation for relatively short distances.\n\nQUESTION:the speed of light in a vacuum is 300, 000, 000 meters per second or just a little less, but what was the recording of this speed relative too ?\n\nANSWER: That is the fascinating thing about light—its speed is independent of who measures it. It is a universal constant. This seems counterintuitive, but has been verified by many experiments. To learn more about the constancy of the speed of light, see my FAQ page.\n\nQUESTION:Need to scale a physical object up in size, either double or quadruple. It's a circular acrylic plate, with multiple weights attached around it's edge, to lower the resonant frequency to a specific frequency, 32hz. The plate is 16\" in diameter, the weights around it's edge add up to 1.05 kg. It needs to be scaled to 32\" or 64\". It will scale in diameter but not thickness, which will remain 1/8\" for all diameters. If the size is doubled to 32\", along with doubling the weights around the edge to 2.1 kg, will the resonant frequency be lowered to the same frequency as the 16\" plate with 1.05 kg weights? If not, how does this scale? How far off approximately will the resonant frequency be from 32hz? Same question for scaling to 64\" with 4.2 kg weights around the edge.\n\nANSWER: Doing a precise calculation like this is impossible without more details about where the weights are placed. Even then it is extremely complicated and beyond the scope of my site to do; a circular disc calculation always involves Bessel functions, neither simple nor intuitive. However, I know that your scaling will not work the way you expect; I will show you how I reached that conclusion. To make sure you understand oscillating systems, let's start by considering a coil spring attached to a mass m; the stiffness of the spring is characterized by a quantity called the spring constant k; if it takes a force of F to stretch the spring a distance D, then k=F/D. The frequency of oscillation of this mass on this spring turns out to be f=(1/2π)√(k/m). So, you see, the mass on a spring behaves the way you want—if you double both the spring constant and the mass, the frequency is unchanged. Now, you can think of your disc like a spring: if you hang weights around the circumference it will warp down from the center. The more weight you hang, the more it will warp, just like a coil spring stretches in proportion to the force. As an approximation, since I cannot do a disc, I figured a leaf spring would be the next best thing. So, I found a calculator on the web which calculates the stiffness (spring constant) of a leaf spring. I found that if you double the length of any given leaf spring, you decrease the spring constant by a factor of 8. So, if you had a leaf spring, doubled its length, and doubled its mass, the frequency f' would be f'=f√[(k'/m')/(k/m)]=f√[((k/8)/(2m))/(k/m))]=32/4=8 Hz. For a leaf spring you have to decrease the mass 8 times to keep the frequency constant. Your disc is not a leaf spring, but it is more similar to that than to a coil spring. Now, if you think about it, it should be intuitive that you have to decrease the mass: a bigger disc will be easier to bend (smaller k) and putting more load (bigger m) on it will make the frequency (which depends on the ratio k/m) far from the original frequency. I haven't told you how scaling works for your specific system, but I hope I have pointed you in the right direction. If the weights can be fairly easily varied, trial and error (known as \"tuning\" here) might be your best bet.\n\nQUESTION:my teacher had me specifically look up the answer to this question but really not understand any other answer what these other sites are giving me. any help? \" in addition to the molecular to-and-fro vibration assoicated with temperature, some molecules can absorb large amounts of energy in the form of internal vibrations and rotations in the atoms making up the molecules. would you expect materials composed of such molecules to have a high or a low specific heat?\"\n\nANSWER:\n\nI want to keep it fairly simple, so let us consider only monatomic (single atoms like He or Ar) and diatonic molecules (two atoms, like O2 or H2). I will also talk only about CV, specific heat at constant volume. The specific heat at constant pressure, CP, is simply related to it by CP=CV+R where R is the universal gas constant. Also, this discussion is only applicable to ideal gases and many real gases are well approximated as ideal gases, at least for understanding specific heat qualitatively. Specific heat is the amount of temperature increase resulting from a certain amount of energy added to the gas. Temperature is a measure of the energy content of the gas, so adding energy to a monatomic gas increases the average kinetic energy per molecule ½mv2=½m(vx2+vy2+vz2). It is said that a point mass has three degrees of freedom (called translational), x, y, and z, three ways to accept the energy as it turns out. There is a famous theorem called equipartition of energy which says that each degree of freedom accepts 1/f of the energy added where f is the number of degrees of freedom for the molecule. Then, it may be shown that CV=3(½R); in other words each degree of freedom contributes ½R to CV. This can be generalized to higher degrees of freedom so that CV=f(½R). Now let us think about a diatomic molecule, visualize a dumbbell. A rotating dumbbell has energy, so a diatomic molecule has another way to accept energy. It can also vibrate, so there is another way it can accept energy. These are additional degrees of freedom, so the specific heat must increase. However, there is an important proviso due to quantum mechanics—to excite a rotational or vibrational state in a molecule requires some minimum energy and so, at very low temperatures, only translational degrees of freedom will be available. But as the temperature increases, first rotational and then at higher temperatures vibrational degrees of freedom can start taking the added energy. Hence the specific heat is dependent of temperature as shown to the right for a diatomic gas (note that ĈV=CV/R). Let's see if we can understand this (refer to the figure at the left above). The dumbbell can not rotate about its own axis, only about an axis perpendicular to the line connecting the two atoms, but there are two such axes as shown by the red diagram; so, there are two degrees of freedom because of rotation. As shown by the graph of the specific heat, it starts out at 3R/2 but when the temperature gets high enough the two rotational degrees of freedom begin to contribute giving 5R/2 as expected. As the temperature gets higher yet we see two more degrees of freedom apparently contributing because the specific heat increases to 7R/2; this is due to the molecule now being able to vibrate. But, this is a puzzle because there is only one degree of vibrational freedom, the molecule can only vibrate along its own axis. The reason is kind of technical: the vibrational energy has both potential and kinetic parts and each behaves like a degree of freedom. If you think this is complicated, imagine how it goes with more complex molecules!\n\nQUESTION:the question is \"why does dust fly off when a hanging carpet is beaten with a stick?\" Now some people answer it is due to inertia some say it is due to inertia and newton's third law. I think it is due to inertia and Newton's third law because when we hit the carpet the dust particles also jump in the in the direction in which we hit it. If it is inertia only then it must jump in opposite direction. So please clear the confusion.\n\nANSWER: The reason that the dust is on the rug in the first place is that there is an adhesive force between the dust and the fibers of the fabric. When you strike the rug with the stick, many of the fibers are caused to have an acceleration. If a fiber accelerates, the dust attached to it must accelerate and that acceleration can only be provided by the force adhering it to the fiber; but that force is not big enough and so the dust separates and is then subject to air currents which carry it away. In that sense, I guess that inertia would be the explanation, but I fail to see why this means it \"must jump in the opposite direction\". Further, I do not see what Newton's third law has to do with anything here. The only force on the dust is the force due to the fiber and the dust exerts an equal and opposite force on the fiber; but the fiber, being so relatively massive, is almost totally unaffected by the force from the dust.\n\nQUESTION:Hello, this is a pretty straightforward question but for some reason I can't find out this answer online. Apparently, the speed of electricity in a vacuum is the same as the speed of light. This \"source\" also says electricity goes almost at the speed of light but how fast \"exactly\" does electricity move through air? Preferably I'd like the answer in meters/second but I can convert the units myself. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity right at the top of the second part, it says: \"The speed at which energy or signals travel down a cable is actually the speed of the electromagnetic wave, not the movement of electrons. Electromagnetic wave propagation is fast and depends on the dielectric constant of the material. In a vacuum the wave travels at the speed of light and almost that fast in air. Propagation speed is affected by insulation, so that in an unshielded copper conductor ranges 95 to 97% that of the speed of light, while in a typical coaxial cable it is about 66% of the speed of light.\" I need to know I'm hoping that it moves at more than half the speed of light\n\nANSWER: The problem here is that \"electricity\" is not really a well-defined thing. The article you reference states that \"the word 'electricity' refers generally to the movement of electrons (or other charge carriers) through a conductor.\" However, air is not a conductor and the electrons are not free to move. Therefore there is no electric current in air and therefore no electricity. In a conductor, the electrons move because they experience an electric field (I find the reference to the electromagnetic wave in your reference to be actually inaccurate.) Before the \"switch is closed\" there is no electric current (electricity) because there is no electric field. When the switch is closed, the electric field has to establish itself in the conductor and this field is set up at approximately the speed of light. The speed of light is air is, for all intents and purposes the speed of light; there is, however, as I have said, no \"electricity\" in the air.\n\nNOTE ADDED: If the electric field is strong enough, the electrons will be ripped off the air molecules and a current will flow. This is what lightning is. I do not think that is what you are interested in, though.\n\nQUESTION:i have heard several times that the gravitaional attraction of the sun provides the centripetal acceleration for the planets to revolve around the sun. but why is it not that the planets are directly accekerated towards the sun linearly and they fall into the sun? why do they revolve only?\n\nANSWER: There are two ways that acceleration, in response to a force, can happen. The magnitude of the velocity vector can change or its direction can change. If an object is in a perfectly circular orbit, only its direction changes and its speed stays the same. If an object is simply dropped, only its speed changes. Any other situation will result in both direction and magnitude of velocity changing. No planet has a perfectly circular orbit, all are in slightly eliptical orbits. But, they are nearly circular and it is a pretty good approximation to say that the force changes the direction but not the speed of the velocity. Newton's mountain may help you to understand this.\n\nQUESTION:How much buoyancy does 1 cubic foot of vacuum have at sea level?\n\nANSWER: The buoyant force is the weight of the displaced air. The air has a density of 1.225 kg/m3. 1 ft3=0.0283 m3, so the mass of the displaced air is m=1.225x0.0283=0.0347 kg. The weight is then mg=0.0347x9.8=0.34 N=0.0764 lb.\n\nQUESTION:How long would it take for a 50lb solid steel sphere to sink a quarter mile through ordinary water?\n\nANSWER: I will assume that the sphere quickly reaches terminal velocity so that I can assume that it goes the whole quarter mile with that constant speed. This should be an excellent approximation. The terminal velocity may be written as vt=√[2mg/(ρACd)] where m is the mass, g =9.8 m/s2 is the acceleration due to gravity, ρ is the density of water (1000 kg/m3), A is the cross sectional area of the sphere, and Cd is the drag coefficient which is 0.47 for a sphere. There is one catch here, that this is without buoyant force and the buoyant force in water is equal to the weight of the displaced water which is not negligible here; when it comes time to put in the mass I will put in an effective mass of the mass of the steel sphere minus the mass of an equal volume of water. I will work in SI units, so 50 lb=22.7 kg and 0.25 mi=402 m. The density of steel is 7850 kg/m3 so the volume occupied by 22.7 kg is V=22.7/7850=0.0289 m3; the radius of a sphere with this volume (using V=4πR3/3) is R=0.0884 m and so the area (using A=πR2) is A=0.0245 m2. Finally, the effective mass would be m=22.7-1000x0.0289=19.8 kg. Putting all these into the equation for vt, I find vt=5.81 m/s. The time an object going this speed takes to travel 402 m is 402/5.81=69 s, 1 minute and 9 seconds.\n\nQUESTION:Suppose that the Death Star was stationary and aiming its laser at a relatively small moving space craft, like a Space Shuttle, and there was enough distance between them so the Death Star had to lead the shot. Would another space craft flying by at close to the speed of light see the laser miss while the people in the Death Star would see a hit, since the speed of light is constant, and the shot will travel faster according to the observers in the craft flying by, and will reach the intended target location before that Space Shuttle gets there?\n\nANSWER: You make a contradictory statement: \"since the speed of light is constant, and the shot will travel faster according to the observers in the craft flying by\". If the speed is constant, how can it travel faster? In fact, all observers will agree that the shuttle will be hit. Two observers cannot disagree on an event which happens in one frame; they can only disagree on things like \"where\" and \"when\" the event happened.\n\nQUESTION:Premise: an airplane can only fly so high because of aerodynamics (low air pressure/no oxygen to burn). Question: if these limitations didn't exist, could it continue to climb altitude and reach \"space\" thus without reaching or exceeding escape velocity?\n\nANSWER: Certainly. See an earlier answer.\n\nQUESTION:I just watched a documentary about the history of nuclear weapons and it said that 100 megatons is the maximum ''practical'' yield for a nuke because if it gets bigger than that, the fireball will be larger than thickness of the majority of the atmosphere and therefore most of the effect of the nuke will escape to space making bombs larger than 100 megatons redundant as an idea. Can you confirm this?\n\nANSWER: No, I cannot confirm this because it does not make sense to me. The fireball of the largest bomb ever detonated, 50 Mt, had a radius of about 2.3 km. I estimate that a bomb with twice that energy would have a radius about 3√2=1.26 times bigger, 2.9 km. Airplanes fly at an altitude of about 30,000 ft=9.1 km and there is certainly enough atmosphere there for an airplane to fly. And, even if most of the atmosphere was gone at 3 km, why would that imply that \"most of the effect…will escape to space\"? The blast also does a lot of damage beyond the fireball at ground level which would increase with the yield of the bomb, and that is where you want to do damage. It is my impression that the reasons for not developing larger bombs are tactical: the heavier the bomb, the more difficult it is to deliver it.\n\nQUESTION:In a 20 X 20 room you have a movie projector on the east side with a screen on the west wall. On the south side you have another projector with a screen on the north wall. What happens to the pictures on the screens when the two projector beams cross at a 90 degree angle. Do the pictures remain cohesive or are they distorted? What is happening in the convergence zone where the beams are crossing? In this instance is light acting as a wave or particle?\n\nANSWER: Light waves obey an equation which is linear; what that means is that when two waves pass the same place the net amplitude of light is equal the the sum of the two individual amplitudes. In your case, what this means is that the light from one projector passes right through the light from the other unaffected. Wave or particle? It depends on what you are looking for. The light, just like all electromagnetic radiation, is both waves and particles. (This does not mean a mixture.)\n\nQUESTION:A plumb bob is hung from the ceiling of a train compartment. If the train moves with an acceleration 'a' along a straight horizontal track, the string supporting the bob makes an angle with the normal to the ceiling whose tangent is 'a/g'. Suppose the train moves on an inclined straight track with uniform velocity. If the tangent of angle of the incline is 'a/g', the string again makes the same angle with the normal to the ceiling. Can a person sitting inside the compartment tell by looking at the plumb line whether the train is accelerated on a horizontal straight track or it is going on an incline with uniform velocity? If yes, how? If no, is there a method to do so?\n\nANSWER: First you should carefully read an earlier answer on the accelerated pendulum. (Actually, I see that you are the person who asked that question!) To answer your question, you can't tell by \"looking\" but you certainly can tell by measurements. For example, in the accelerated problem the tension in the string is m√(g2+a2); for the inclined track the tension is mg. Or, in the accelerated problem you feel youself being pushed back with a force (fictitious) Ma, but on the inclined track you feel yourself being pushed back with a force (real) Mgsinθ=Mg[a/√(g2+a2)].\n\nQUESTION:Is it possible, and if so how to calculate the magnitude of a 4-dimensional vector?\n\nANSWER: I assume that you are asking about 4-vectors in special relativity. This kind of question can depend on the mathematics of the multidimensional coordinate space you are working with, but in special relativity if a vector has a space-like part (Ax, Ay, Az) and a time-like part A\n\nt, then the magnitude of the vector is A=√[At2-(Ax2+Ay2+Az2)]. For example, the space-time vector has a magnitude of R=√[c2t2-(x2+y2+z2)]=√[c2t2-r2] and the energy-momentum vector has a magnitude of √[E2-(px2+py2+pz2)c2]= √[E2-p2c2]=m0c2. If you want a bunch more detail, see the Wikipedia article on 4-vectors.\n\nQUESTION:why air is a bad conductor? why lightning occurs even if the air is a good insulator?\n\nANSWER: Gases are almost always poor conductors because there are no electrons to carry the current. If the electric field in a gas gets strong enough, electrons will be pulled off the atoms allowing current to flow. In addition, the electrons which are freed will smash into other atoms in the gas causing more electrons to be knocked off atoms; this is called cascading and happens any time there is a spark in a gas (of which lightning is an extreme example).\n\nQUESTION:what would happen if someone were to HOLD the gun and shoot it. The person would not be tethered to anything and would be floating freely in space. If that person is around 160Ibs and shot a High power rifle how fast would it project the wielder in the opposite direction? I know it wouldnt be as fast as the bullet because of the mass of the person but I'm curious to what extent they would be projected into space... if thats would even happen at all.\n\nANSWER: First, read an earlier answer to a question similar to yours. The concept you want to use here is momentum conservation. Momentum is the product of mass times velocity and the total momentum of a system must be the same before and after the gun has fired. The mass of a 160 lb man plus his gun is about 75 kg, the mass of a typical bullet is about 0.015 kg, and the muzzle velocity of a high-power rifle is about 250 m/s. So, since the momentum is zero before the rifle is fired, 0=75v-250x0.015=75v-3.75 or v=0.05 m/s which is about 10 ft/min.\n\nQUESTION:We have a kitchen table that is extremely heavy and we know of no way to weigh it. If I put one leg on a scale, it reads 143.2 lbs. I'm thinking we can't simply multiply that number by four because it seems it may register some of the weight from at least part of the other three quarters.\n\nANSWER: Get a 2x4 which will span the two legs at one end and weigh it; call that weight w. Put the 2x4 under the legs at one end and the scale under that; the scale will read W1. Move the 2x4 and scale to the legs at the other end; the scale will read W2. The weight of your table is W=W1+W2-2w. If your table is symmetrical, you will find W1 to be about the same as W2.\n\nQUESTION:what dose \" 3.37500000E+15MPH\" mean ?\n\nANSWER: It means that you travel 3,375,000,000,000,000 miles in each hour. It is, however, an impossible speed since the speed of light is 6.7x108=670,000,000 mph and nothing can travel faster than the speed of light.\n\nQUESTION:I work with autoclaves, my question is what would happen if a person got trapped in an pressure vessel and the autoclave was pressured to 3 pounds (this is the normal pressure value after the door is locked)?\n\nANSWER: For the benefit of readers who do not know what an autoclave is, it is a sterilizing chamber using high-temperature steam (~1200C) at high pressures. Pressure is measured in pounds per square inch (PSI) and atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 PSI. So, I assume your 3 pounds is 3 PSI above atmospheric, called the gauge pressure. So the added pressure would be about 20% above normal. When you go under water, about 30 ft, you experience about 100% above normal, double the normal atmospheric pressure, and you know you can do that with no ill effect. So, essentially what would happen in your scenario is that you might feel a little pressure in your eardrums but not much else.\n\nQUESTION:A rigid container filled with air is placed in vacuum. If a small hole is created on one side of the container, air leaks out and the container moves in the opposite direction. How would the container move if the situation were reversed, i.e. a rigid container of vacuum placed in air with a hole on one side of the container? I can't seem to apply Newton's 3rd law and momentum conservation to solve this convincingly.\n\nANSWER: Let's just think of a cubical box with a hole in one face. Any molecule which finds the hole will enter the cube, go to the opposite face, collide with it, and rebound, thereby transferring some momentum to the box. The box is now moving in the direction in which the molecule was originally moving (I will call that the forward direction). The rebounding molecule will either go back out the hole or hit inside the cube and bounce back again. As long as the molecule stays inside the box, the net effect will be zero but eventually it will find the hole and so the net effect will be one collision moving the box in the forward direction. Now think of a huge number of molecules entering the hole. At the beginning, more will be coming in than going out so the net force on the box will be forward. Eventually, there will be the same density of molecules inside and outside the cube so the net force will become zero. Bottom line—the cube moves in the same direction as if air were being released from it. An intuitive way to see this is to note that each entering molecule carries a momentum in the forward direction, so that is the momentum available to be transferred to the cube.\n\nQUESTION:From a physicist's point of view do you ever see us using antimatter as an energy source and are there any ways to even theoretically to create antimatter in adequate quantities? Is antimatter power really just a theoretical thing that won't get any practical use in your opinion?\n\nANSWER: So, you have to ask yourself where you are going to get this antimatter. You have to make it because there is never any appreciabale amount just sitting around. You can be sure that it would cost you more energy to create it than you would get from annihilating it.\n\nQUESTION:If electrical currents are charged particles, then electricity must be composed of matter (obvious.....I think) if that were the case, then our thoughts, dreams, etc, are simply a result of charged neurons interacting within our synapses through electrical currents. So, I suppose my question is, if our are thoughts are confined to ourselves or do they hold a place within the whole concept of time and space.\n\nANSWER: Certainly, brain activity involves electric currents. Electric currents create electromagnetic fields which can be detected outside of you, so brain activity is not \"confined to ourselves.\" Neuroscience researchers routinely sense these fields with detectors outside the subjects. If you are suggesting a possible explanation for ESP, I sure would not bank on it. As far as we know, our brains are good at creating very weak fields but not at detecting very weak fields. Also, there is presently no known way of actually interpreting the thoughts which caused those fields.\n\nQUESTION:A photon is created when an electron returns to its original energy state (I think). How/when does a photon die? Does it die? Does it run out of energy?\n\nANSWER: Atomic or molecular transitions do, indeed, create photons. There are many other ways to create them—radio broadcasting antennas, for example, spew them out by the jillion. A photon carries energy, so the only way it could \"die\" or \"run out of energy\" would be to give its energy to something else. When you look up into the heavens at night, you see photons which have been traveling millions or billions of years to get here, so they evidently never die if they never interact with something else. Here are a few ways photons can lose energy:\n\nIf a photon encounters an atom like the one that made it, the photon can excite the electron up to the higher state again, thereby disappearing.\n\nIf it encounters an electron, the photon can give the electron all its energy; this is called the photoelectric effect.\n\nIf it encounters an electron, the photon can scatter from the electron thereby losing part of its energy; this is called the Compton effect.\n\nIf it has enough energy, it can interact with the electric field of an atomic nucleus and spontaneously create an electron-positron pair; this is called pair production.\n\nThe bottom line is that photons must find something to interact with or else they will live (as far as we know) forever.\n\nQUESTION:Would it be possible to have flying cars in rotating space habitats or would it be really difficult to fly them? And I want to thank you for making this incredibly awesome site for people with questions regarding physics.\n\nANSWER: Have you read Larry Niven's sci-fi book Ringworld? It is about a rotating space habitat. I recently analyzed \"free fall\" in such a world. If you want to understand the details you should read through this carefully. Interestingly, as long as the radius is very large, a projectile would move very similarly to how it would move in a gravitational field. However, there is a profound difference, namely that when in the air, there is no force on the projectile. This would make flying anything different from on earth, but I suspect the skill to do so would be pretty easily acquired.\n\nQUESTION:If the earth was to just vanish disappear without a trace what would happen to the moon?\n\nANSWER: The details depend on exactly where the moon was in its orbit, but the simple answer is that it would go into an orbit around the sun.\n\nQUESTION:why do we say that materials in our world are mostly empty space\n\nANSWER: The simplest way to think about atoms is to have little electrons in orbits around the nucleus. The nucleus is extremely small compared to the size of the atoms and electrons have a tiny mass compared to the nucleus. Therefore, like you would say that the solar system is composed mostly of empty space, you would say that the atom is composed of mostly empty space. The reality is, though, that the elctrons are really smeared out over the whole volume of the atom, they are like a cloud rather than like little planets, so the atoms are not really empty space.\n\nQUESTION:from where do elements heavier than hydrogen originiat\n\nANSWER: See an earlier answer.\n\nQUESTION:There is a demonstration where a person is put in a trashbag and the air vacuumed out. The person can't move their arms. Is this because of the pressure difference between the inside and outside of the bag, or because of the large surface area of the bag allows them to feel more pressure?\n\nANSWER: There are two things going on here. First, it is like being tied up, the bag restrains you. If you were shrink-wrapped you would also not be able to move. But, the trash bag is bigger than you so it would not be \"tied up\" by it because it would be like a loop rope which was 5 feet in diameter. However, when the air in the bag is removed, the atmospheric pressure on the outside holds the bag tightly to you and it becomes just like shrink-wrapping. Here is a you-tube video (you can find lots of others).\n\nQUESTION:I have a question about force on a lever. I am building a set of oars for a whitewater raft. The industry is full of opinions but very few physicists. We all agree that the force is greatest at the oar lock (fulcrum) but nobody has any idea how much less force is present at the neck (the narrow part just above the blade). If you will do this one...here are the values. Using a 10' oar the fulcrum is at the 32-36\" mark and the neck is at the 90\" mark. The blade occupies the remaining 30\". We taper the oars knowing they don't need to be as strong away from the fulcrum but nobody knows how much we can taper because we don't know how much less force they need to withstand. The taper results in the neck having anywhere from 65% to 80% of the wood on the shaft. I suspect 80% is overkill. Any thoughts.\n\nANSWER: A disclaimer: I am not an engineer and an engineer would probably be a better person to ask this question. When you are rowing, the water exerts a force, call it F, on the blade of the oar. I am thinking that the thing we should be thinking about is the torque which this force exerts about the lock compared to the torque it exerts on the neck. This force may be thought of as being 15\" from the neck, approximately in the middle of the blade; so the torque from the water force at the neck would be 15F. The torque at the lock would be, assuming the lock is 35 inches from the handle, about 55\"; so the torque from the water force at the lock would be 55F. So the torque on the lock would about 55/15\n\n≈3.7 times bigger than the on the neck. Now we get into some pretty complicated materials engineering, see this link. It turns out that the stress σ is inversely proportional to a quantity Z called the section modulus. For a cylindrical shape of radius R, the section modulus is Z=0.78R3. So, I surmise that an estimate of how much smaller the neck would be than the lock would be Rneck3/Rlock3≈1/3.7 or Rneck≈0.65Rlock, about 2/3 the thickness.\n\nQUESTION:If I have a ramp that is 28 feet long, fixed at the upper end (shore) and weighs 400 lbs that has a 6 foot rise, how do I calculate the weight at the lower end (dock)? I am trying to determine how much floatation I need under the water end to support the weight of the ramp at that end. That rise varies during the course of the year from zero feet to a maximum of 7 feet.\n\nANSWER: I am assuming that the ramp is a uniform plank, that is, that its center of gravity is at its geometrical center (14'). Refer to the picture on the left. Two equations must be satisfied for equilibrium, the sum of all forces must equal zero and the sum of all torques about any axis must be zero. The first condition gives us that F1+F2-400=0 and the second condition (summing torques about the center of the ramp) gives us that F1-F2=0. Solving these two equations, F1=F2=200 lb. Note that the answer, 200 lb, is independent of the rise.\n\nQUESTION:Two dice are suspended in outer space with no visible forces acting on them. Their center of masses are 10 cm apart, and they each have an identical mass of .0033 kg. How long would it take for the force of gravity between them to cause them to touch? (We will assume they are volumeless for more ease in calculation).\n\nANSWER: This seems a very difficult problem because the gravitational force between them changes as they get closer and so it is not a case of uniform acceleration. However, this is really just a special case of the Kepler problem (the paths of particles experiencing 1/r2 forces) which I have done in detail before. You can go over that in detail. For your case, K=Gm1m2=6.67x10-11x(3.3x10-3)2=7.26x10-16 N∙m2, the reduced mass is μ=m1m2/(m1+m2)=0.0033/2=1.65x10-3 kg, and the semimajor axis a=2.5 cm=2.5x10-2 m. Now, from the earlier answer, T=√(4πμa3/K)=5.98x104 s. The time you want is T/2=2.99x104 s. This is only 8.3 hours and seemed too short to me. To check if the time is reasonable, I calculated the starting acceleration and assumed that the acceleration was constant and each die had to go 5 cm; this time should be longer than the correct time because the acceleration increases as the masses get closer. The force on each die at the beginning is K/r2=7.26x10-16\n\n/0.052=3.04x10-13 N; so, the resulting initial acceleration is F/m=3.04x10-13/3.3x10-3=9.21x10-11 m/s2. So, assuming uniform acceleration, 0.05=½at2=4.61x10-11t2. Solving, t=3.3x104 s. So, the answer above is, indeed, reasonable.\n\nQUESTION:If we can talk about \"escape vel. for light ,(in case of black holes)\" that mean light is affected by gravitational fields and thus like other masses, must be \"decelerated\", while moving away from a heavy planet. Thus, can we slow down light to near zero speed? I know the ans is 'no', but WHY? if light is affected by gravity then we should be able to slow it down? Also if light is affected by gravity , then what's it's mass??\n\nANSWER: As light travels upward in a gravitational field, it loses energy. If light were a classical object like a baseball, you would say that, since its energy is ½mv2 and the mass is constant, the velocity must decrease. However, the energy of light, since it has no mass, is not ½mv2 but rather each photon has an energy hf where h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency of the light. So, as it goes higher its frequency gets smaller—the wavelength gets longer; that is why it is called gravitational red shift. In the case of a black hole, eventually the energy of the light is zero and the black hole has gained all the energy which the light had. Similarly, if light is aimed down in a gravitational field it does not speed up but rather increases frequency as it goes down, gravitational blue shift. Light does not have mass but it is affected by gravity. Newton's universal law of gravitation is not the last word; the modern theory of gravity is general relativity and if you go to my FAQ page you can learn about how gravity affects massless objects.\n\nQUESTION:My physics teacher has taught us that people who are going to travel in an aeroplane should empty ink from their pens as if ink is filled at high pressure at the ground level, it will leak out when the plane flies in the low pressure. But the plane is air-tight. How can low pressure act from outside the walls of the plane? Also, does the density of the ink changes when we carry to low-pressure region?\n\nANSWER: The inside of an airliner is pressurized, but not to sea-level atmospheric pressure. The pressure is typically about the same as the pressure at an altitude of 2100 m, approximately 80% of sea-level pressure. Ink is mostly water and water is essentially incompressible, so the density does not change.\n\nQUESTION:Is there a Doppler shift between the centre and outside of a wheel. Say for example a standard merry go round you find at a sideshow, if I stand in the middle and look at something on the outer does my image Doppler shift. The reason it is confusing to me is because your angular rotation is the same for both people but not your linear speed.\n\nANSWER: If you were asking about sound rather than light, there would be no Doppler shift because for normal waves there is no effect if there is no component toward or away between the source and the observer. For light, however, which is what you ask about, there is a Doppler shift. If your question had asked for a source and and observer moving on straight parallel paths with different speeds (sort of what you asked), then you could relatively compactly write the Doppler shift equation relative to the observer. In the figure to the right, the observer will see the source moving with a speed v and light comes at an angle θ as shown. In this case, f'=f/[γ(1+(vcosθ/c))] where γ=1/√[1-(v2/c2)] and f and f' are the frequencies at the source and observer, respectively. If θ=900, f'=f/γ; this is called the transverse relativistic Doppler effect. But, in your scenario, each will see the other to be at rest. But both are actually accelerating relative to an inertial frame, so the situation is not so simple. You can see a discussion of this scenario on Wikepedia. Suppose that the source is at a distance r1 from the center, the observer is at a distance r2, and the angular velocity is ω. Then assuming that the distance traveled by the observer in the time it takes the light to travel between the two is very small, I find that f'≈f√[(1-(r1ω/c)2)/(1-(r2ω/c)2)]. I just realized that you actually asked an easier question, namely that r2=0 and r1=R where R is the radius of the merry-go-round, so, f'=f√(1-(Rω/c)2). This is exactly the same as the transverse Doppler effect above, f'=f/γ. [Sorry that the answer is much longer than needed. Whenever I misread a question and do a lot of interesting and more general work, I am loathe to delete it! The concise answer for you is that f'=f/γ.]\n\nQUESTION:I have a question concerning a magnet suspended inside a copper tube. Does the copper tube accumulate the mass of the magnet? In other words, does the copper tube now weigh more with the magnet suspended in the middle? or is it partial weight because the magnet does fall inside, albeit slowly.\n\nANSWER: First, some terminology. Weight is the force which the earth exerts on something, so the weight of the copper tube is always the weight of the copper tube. If a magnet falls through a copper tube, it induces currents in the copper and these currents exert a force on the magnet which tends to slow it down. In fact, the force becomes strong enough that the magnet quickly reaches a terminal velocity—it falls with a constant speed. That means that the tube is exerting an upward force on the magnet equal to the weight of the magnet. But, Newton's third law says that if the tube exerts a force on the magnet, the magnet exerts an equal and opposite force on the tube. Therefore, if the tube is standing on a scale, the scale will read the weight of the tube plus the weight of the magnet, but that does not mean that the tube got heavier. It is just the same as if you put the tube on the scale and pushed down on it with a force equal the weight of the magnet; you would not say that the tube got heavier because you pushed on it. A good demonstration of this can be seen at this link.\n\nQUESTION:I was curious to know how the kinetic energy a water balloon endures when free falling affects the radius of it's splatter.\n\nANSWER: So, you are wondering what the radius of the splatter depends on and how? Of course, to do an accurate calculation would be neigh on impossible. I will just do a very rough approximation and then you can do an experiment and see if it makes any sense. At the instant that the water baloon hits the ground its kinetic energy is K=½MV2=Mgh where M is the mass of the water balloon"
