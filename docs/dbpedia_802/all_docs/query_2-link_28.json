Students can make observation and/or measurements of an object's motion to provide evidence that a pattern can be used to predict future motion.\n\n4-PS3-4\n\nStudents can use the Newton's Cradle to design, test, and refine a device that converts energy from one form to another.\n\nHS-PS2-1\n\nStudents can use the Newton's Cradle in an investigation to analyze data to support the claim that Newton's Second Law of Motion describes the mathematical relationship among the net force on a macroscopic object, its mass, and its acceleration.\n\nHS-PS2-2\n\nStudents can use the Newton's Cradle in an investigation and use mathematical representations to support the claim that the total momentum of a system of objects is conserved when there is no net force on the system.\n\nHS-PS3-4\n\nStudents can use the Newton's Cradle design, build, and refine a device that works within given constraints to convert one form of energy into another form of energy."
