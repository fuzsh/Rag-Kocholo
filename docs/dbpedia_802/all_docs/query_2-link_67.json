Newton's cradle demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy through a series of swinging metal spheres suspended in a frame. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it transmits its momentum and energy through collisions to push the last sphere upward in an arc. This effect repeats in the opposite direction. The device works through elastic collisions that transfer kinetic energy between spheres as potential energy in their compression, without losing energy to heat. It provides a simple demonstration of fundamental physics principles.",
