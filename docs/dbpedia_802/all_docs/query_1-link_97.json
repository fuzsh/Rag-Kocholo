        "text": "First produced in the late 1600’s, the cradle was named after the legendary professor sir Isaac newton. This desk fidget toy is made up of five identical spheres that use conservation energy. With motion, the balls at either end act as a striker to channel the energy through the balls and make the last ball swing. The clever design allows the swinging motion last a surprisingly long time, creating a visually satisfying desk toy to watch.\n\nWe highly recommend the newtons pendulum to anyone that enjoys satisfying toys that don’t require much effort and can help with controlling stress levels."
