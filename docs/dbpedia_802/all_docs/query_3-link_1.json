        "text": "This demo is used to show how conservation of momentum and energy works by using a series of swinging spheres. This is usually a system of five balls attached to a structure by two strings on either side. A ball on one end is lifted, and when it is released, strikes the other four balls. This collision creates a force through the other four balls and causes the ball on the other end to be pushed upward.[1][2]\n\nMany ask why the cradle doesn't send two balls at half the speed when one ball is dropped. This does not happen because it would not conserve energy ($ \\LARGE\\mathbf{V} $ versus $\\LARGE\\mathbf{V^2} $!).\n\nElastic vs Inelastic Collisions\n\nWhen considering collisions in physics, there are two types that can occur[:] elastic, and inelastic. In an elastic collision, both the momentum of the system and the kinetic energy of the system are conserved. That is:\n\n$$ m_{in}v_{in} = m_{out}v_{out} \\\\ {and} \\\\ {{1} \\over {2}} m_{in} {v_{in}}^{2} = {{1} \\over {2}} m_{out} {v_{out}}^{2}$$\n\nIn an inelastic collision, only momentum is conserved. The kinetic energy put into the system does work on something, or is converted into another form of energy that can frequently escape the system. This does not violate the law of conservation of energy as no energy is actually missing, it has just been shifted elsewhere. Usually this energy ends up being used to deform an object permanently, such as a car crumpling in a crash.\n\nNewton’s Cradle visualizes an elastic collision by allowing students to see the mass as a number of balls, and the speed as the height the balls travel.\n\nSide Note: Gravitational Potential Energy and Energy Conservation\n\nWhen the balls are lifted, they are given gravitational potential energy ($ \\LARGE{mgh} $) that is completely converted to kinetic energy ($ \\LARGE{{1} \\over {2}} mv^{2} $) at the bottom of their swing. Setting these equations equal to one another, and using some algebra, we can see that the velocity is completely dependent on the height the balls are lifted.\n\n$$ mgh_{top}+{{1} \\over {2}} m{v_{top}}^{2}= mgh_{bottom}+{{1} \\over {2}} m{{v_{bottom}}^{2}}$$\n\nSince the velocity at the top of the swing (while it is being held) is 0 and the height at the bottom of the swing is also zero, this simplifies to:\n\n$$ mgh_{top}+{{1} \\over {2}} m \\cdot 0 = mg \\cdot 0+{{1} \\over {2}} m{v_{bottom}}^{2} \\rightarrow mgh_{top}={{1} \\over {2}} m{v_{bottom}}^{2} $$\n\nSolving for velocity $ \\LARGE{v} $, we find:\n\n$$ v_{out} = \\sqrt{2gh}$$\n\nWhy the same number of balls?\n\nLet’s examine the case of dropping two balls to collide with the remaining balls. As discussed above, when the balls collide, momentum must be conserved. So we know that:\n\n$$ m_{2 balls} v_{i}=m_{? balls} v_{f} $$\n\nTrying to solve anything we get something like:\n\n$$ v_{f}= {m_{2 balls} \\over m_{? balls}} v_{i} $$\n\nThis leaves us with two unknowns, the final mass and the final velocity, so we need another equation. Since we know that this is an elastic collision, energy must be conserved so we can also use:\n\n$${{1} \\over {2}} m_{2 balls}{v_{i}}^{2}= {{1} \\over {2}} m_{f}{v_{f}}^{2}$$\n\nIf we substitute the $\\LARGE{v_{f}}$ that we found in the momentum conservation equation into the energy equation we can find $\\LARGE{m_{f}}$:\n\n$${{1} \\over {2}} m_{2 balls}{v_{i}}^{2}= {{1} \\over {2}} m_{f}({m_{2 balls} \\over m_{f}} v_{i})^2$$\n\nDividing out the parts that are the same on both sides and separating the squared part:\n\n$$ m_{2 balls} {v_{i}}^{2} = m_{? balls} {{{m_{2 balls}}^{2}} \\over {{m_{? balls}}^{2}}}{v_{i}}^{2}$$\n\nCancelling $ \\LARGE{{v_i}^2} $ on both sides and $ \\LARGE{m_{?balls}} $ on the right\n\n$$m_{2 balls}={{{m_{2 balls}}^2} \\over {m_{? balls}}}$$\n\nDividing both sides by $\\LARGE{m_{2 balls}}$:\n\n$$1={{m_{2 balls}} \\over {m_{? balls}}} \\therefore m_{2 balls}=m_{? balls}$$\n\nPutting this back into the momentum equation we see that if the mass must be the same, then the velocity must also be the same:\n\n$$ m_{2 balls} v_{i}= m_{2 balls}v_{f} \\rightarrow v_{i}=v_{f}$$\n\nThis is always what happens with the cradle. Whenever a set number of balls is dropped on one side, the same number of balls go up on the other side to approximately the same height (which was shown to be directly related to velocity)."
