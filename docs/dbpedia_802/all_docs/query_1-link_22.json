        "text": "This image could have imperfections as itâ€™s either historical or reportage.\n\nNewton's cradle, named after Sir Isaac Newton, is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy. If two balls are pulled away and is let to fall, it strikes the first two balls in the series and comes to a dead stop. The balls on the opposite side of the series instantly acquires the speed of the first balls and swings in an arc that one would expect of the first balls. The first impact produces a shock wave that propagates through the intermediate balls. A hard material such as steel is very good at doing this."
