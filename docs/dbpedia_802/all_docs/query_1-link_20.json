It was so-named in 1967 by English actor Simon Prebble, in honor of his countryman and revolutionary physicist Isaac Newton.\n\nDespite its seemingly simple design, the Newton's cradle and its swinging, clicking balls isn't just an ordinary desk toy. It is, in fact, an elegant demonstration of some of the most fundamental laws of physics and mechanics.\n\nThe toy illustrates the three main physics principles at work\n\nconservation of energy\n\nconservation of momentum\n\nfriction"
