        "text": "Introduction\n\nhttp://teachertech.rice.edu/Participants/louviere/Newton/newton5.jpg\n\nSir Isaac Newton is perhaps one of the most acclaimed and well-known scientists that has ever lived in human history. His discoveries and experiments in physics, mathematics, and a host of other sciences have opened the door to modern science. Many of his ideas are a result of observation and others - of pure genius. Laws that he discovered bear his name, and it is almost certain that his name will be remembered for generations to come. This is already proving to be true as the name \"Newton\" is a symbol for principles of science and used to name ideas and inventions that utilize important laws of nature. One such invention, known as \"Newton's Cradle\" or \"Newton's Balls,\" represents many of Newton's ground break ideas about the laws that govern the universe. Though simple, it sums up ideas that the great scientist discovered and made known to mankind. . .\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Newtons_cradle_animation_book_2.gif"
