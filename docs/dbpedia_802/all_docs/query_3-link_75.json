        "text": "Have you ever heard of Newton’s cradle? Even if you don’t recognize the name, you’ve probably seen the device, which can be seen on many office decks throughout the world: Five little silver balls are suspended in a perfectly straight line by thin threads that connect them to two parallel horizontal bars, which are joined to a base.\n\nSimply described, Newton’s cradle is a device that uses swinging spheres to demonstrate momentum and energy conservation. In this video by Slow Mo Guys, the YouTubers Gav and Dan shoot a Newton’s cradle and capture the action in ultra-slow motion.\n\nSince the ball bearings are substantially harder than the bullet, the bullet shatters on impact, sending Newton’s cradle flying as a result. If you’re curious to learn more about it, make sure you watch the video embedded above, and as always, enjoy."
