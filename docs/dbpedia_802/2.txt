Newton's cradle, also called a Newton's rocker or a ball clicker are often used as a relaxing diversion on the desk.

Newton's cradle is a device that demonstrates conservation of momentum and energy using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. It was so-named in 1967 by English actor Simon Prebble, in honor of his countryman and revolutionary physicist Isaac Newton.

Newton's Cradle is a device that not only demonstrates a pendulum, but also shows the Laws of Conservation of Momentum and Energy. When one ball on the end is lifted and released, the resulting force travels through the line and pushes the last ball upward. Because it uses Newton's Laws, it was named after Sir Isaac Newton, English physicist, mathematician and astronomer.

Each ball acts like an individual pendulum. At rest all the balls are touching. When you lift one of the end balls and let it hit the resting balls, only the ball at the other end moves, and the initial ball stops at rest.
