        "meta_description": "A very different film, \"Love's Labour's Lost\" is a musical romance based on Shakespeare’s comedy of the same name. Here, a young king and his three friends swear off women, attempting to devote themselves to the serious study of philosophy. But the entrance of a princess and her three attendants demolishes that vow, but quick. Done in the language of Shakespeare, with musical numbers from the ‘30s as interludes.",

        "text": "Nowhere near the elegant “Much Ado About Nothing,” which also starred Branagh and his then wife, Emma Thompson, but it has its charming moments. Except for some suggestive innuendos and a bawdy dance number, it is a clean movie, more about love than lust. Most of the cast members are rather, shall we say, subdued, when it comes to singing and dancing aptitude, but Nathan Lane, as a court jester, is often hysterical. And there is that language: “When, spite of cormorant devouring Time, Th’endeavour of this present breath may buy That honour which shall bate his scythe’s keen edge, And make us heirs of all eternity.”"
