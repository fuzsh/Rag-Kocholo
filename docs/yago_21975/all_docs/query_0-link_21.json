        "text": "PRINTER FRIENDLY VIEW\n\n(inverts site colors)\n\nBuy it... if you appreciate both Patrick Doyle's exuberant score for Much Ado About Nothing and the fluffy style of standard songs of the 1930's/MGM musical era.\n\nAvoid it... if the bright and energetic sound of the Busby Berkeley atmosphere is as nauseating to you as its wild camera angles over complicated choreography.\n\nEDITORIAL REVIEW\n\nFILMTRACKS TRAFFIC RANK: #968 WRITTEN 5/20/00, REVISED 7/7/08\n\nDoyle\n\nLove's Labour's Lost: (Patrick Doyle) Kenneth Branagh has never been one to shy away from a challenge. His ambitious work as writer, producer, actor, and director to bring William Shakespeare's forgotten Love's Labour's Lost to the big screen for the first time was all the evidence of Branagh's determination you'd ever need. Not only was the obscure play difficult to adapt for modern audiences, but Branagh also decided to set the narrative in the setting of a 1930's Busby Berkeley musical. While he was able to convince enough people of the idea's merits to produce the film, skeptical audiences more in tune with the director's successful, previous Shakespearian adaptations didn't warm up to Love's Labour's Lost. Unlike Much Ado About Nothing, which embodies much of the same grandiose and charming spirit, Love's Labour's Lost whips through its frenzy of musical production numbers and connecting segues so fast that it's difficult to identify with the four lead couples in the same way. Whether it was ultimately a cinematic success or not, you have to admire Branagh's zeal for both Shakespeare and classic MGM musicals. The merging of these elements are an unusual experiment that allowed Branagh's usual musical collaborator, Patrick Doyle, to romp in the same spirit. Not for fifty years had the genres of Shakespeare and the musical been combined on such a grand scale as they are in Love's Labour's Lost, and Doyle had the pleasure of working with Branagh to determine which classic songs of the 1930's to adapt into the bright tones of Doyle's own original writing. Obviously, the audience for the film and its music will largely be the same. Whether you can tolerate Doyle's extremely upbeat original music in conjunction with the lovable song numbers depends solely on your attitude towards the glamorous genre of energetic musicals that were so popular in mainstream movie houses of the 1930's and 40's. Skepticism over the merits of an endeavor to reconstruct some of the most popular musical songs of the time into a Shakespearean mold is understandable. And yet, the beauty of Doyle's end result in Love's Labour's Lost is its fantastic melding of the different famous genre songs into the Shakespearean story without too many awkward turns.\n\nAs a musical production, the orchestral underscore breaks into full-fledged song and dance for ten neatly choreographed performances with smaller instrumental ensembles. Only a few times does a sharp edge exist in the transitions between score and song, most notably before \"I Won't Dance,\" but it's likely that these are faults of the album rather than of the music as presented in the film. The classic Golden Age songs of Gershwin, Porter, Kern, and Berlin work remarkably well together on the album; their selection was wise. The classically educated ear will pick up on several adaptations of fragments of these composers' (cited) works throughout Doyle's underscore. In his original work, Doyle's greatest achievement in Love's Labour's Lost is the necessary enthusiasm that he injects into the tone of the music. The musicals of the thirties and forties are always jubilant, smiling, and overwhelming with energy (not to mention the creative camera angles that Branagh imitates during the numbers). Doyle's previous scores for Branagh's films proved that he could well enough produce a believable Shakespearean spirit, but this time he also succeeds in creating the necessary 1930's atmosphere to keep the music and film floating on air. The title overture is a remarkable fanfare of Korngold style, introducing the lush and lavish lifestyles of the era with one of the composer's more infections themes. This idea permeates the score despite the heavy presence of the songs, and the composer even reproduces a very genuine newsreel march for the \"Cinetone News\" cue that is adapted into several scenes in the film. The album, while a success, still has a few minor problems. The lengthy score cue \"Twelve Months and a Day,\" while necessary in its purpose, breaks the flighty mood considerably, with a far more somber and serious tone than the rest of the bright, fluffy album. The second flaw of the music is the fact that Branagh employed actors to play the lead parts in the musical rather than accomplished singers. In traditional musicals, the voices were always as fine-tuned as their dancing. But in Love's Labour's Lost, the actors don't always perform well, and unlike Moulin Rouge the following year, the ensemble doesn't seem as well coached. Still, their enthusiasm mostly compensates for this problem, and the album remains a unique and entertaining experience, especially if you're into those old MGM musical productions. **** @Amazon.com: CD or Download\n\nBias Check: For Patrick Doyle reviews at Filmtracks, the average editorial rating is 3.84 (in 32 reviews)\n\nand the average viewer rating is 3.45 (in 24,555 votes).

Notes from both Doyle and Branagh are included, and the text of the Branagh comment is as follows:\n\n\"Perhaps it was the challenge of walking into a meeting with film financiers to persuade them to bankroll an obscure Shakespearean comedy musical. Or perhaps it was a love affair with this neglected play. Or perhaps it was my awed admiration for the great Hollywood extravaganzas of the '30s, '40s, and '50s.\n\nWhatever the reason, Patrick and I were pretty sure that we would be setting ourselves an irresistibly exciting and demanding creative challenge by fusing Shakespeare and the musical. And so it proved.\n\nA plot that many critics have described as silly; a style that moves from high romance to farce to social satire; characters who can veer from narcissism to the grotesque - all are inside a play which, alone among Shakespeare's works, went unperformed for some two hundred years after his death. Add to that the very genre of film musical, rarely revived, replaced, we were told, by the rock video. The soundtrack is the essential element with which we attempted to overcome these difficulties.\n\nWe chose classic songs from composers whose economy, lightness of touch, and linguistic and melodic brilliance could stand beside the equally delicate poetry of the playwright. And we strived to create new arrangements that took their style from the drama (and the comedy); orchestrations that would viscerally give audiences the vicarious thrill of on-screen emotions; and finally, a narrative score that required Patrick to tackle the awesome challenge of complementing both Shakespeare and some of the major popular songwriters of the twentieth century.\""
