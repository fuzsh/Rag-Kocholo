        "text": "STANDING in front of 200 earnest female faces and a smattering of sympathetic men at a recent Harvard Hillel conference on ''superwomen,'' I realized my customary ironic autobiographical anecdotes were falling flat. This audience expected substance, a concrete point of view on ''having it all'' -- plus relevant thought on the future of feminism, not to mention Judaism. And I was offering my best stories about my mother.\n\nBut five minutes into what I feared could become a debacle, a movie musical began. My nephew Ben, a freshman, strode into the room with six young men, all in black tie. As they climbed the steps to the back row of the lecture hall, I pictured them breaking into an updated version of the Cole Porter classic ''Anything Goes!'' I was especially pleased that in my movie-musical fantasy, a Yale man was providing the melody and lyrics for a Harvard musical.\n\nThe mere thought of them elegantly tapping up the stairs amidst the young women peering at me completely lifted my spirits. Of course, my nephew and his associates were only stopping by on their way to the freshman prom, an event my own generation would have vehemently protested. But once I pictured my nephew singing and dancing, I relaxed and quite enjoyed the conference. In fact, I even worked out what I thought was a very nice little exit for the tuxedo-clad six. A woman asks towards the end of my talk, ''Where do you think men are going?'' I answer, ''To the prom!'' Then the boys break into a refrain from ''Varsity Drag'' and get the entire room up singing and dancing. All that's missing is June Allyson.\n\nAlthough most likely you wouldn't cast June Allyson as a Harvard Hillel superwoman.\n\nFor me, the great movie musicals defined romance and American exuberance. But while in recent, more ''edgy'' decades, these Technicolor feasts were dismissed as kitschy, campy or just ridiculously sentimental, a resurgence seems to be in the air. The Lars von Trier film that won the Golden Palm at Cannes is a musical, and so are the forthcoming films from Baz Luhrmann and the Coen Brothers. Jerome Robbins's choreography for ''West Side Story'' has been revived as a retro-hip Gap ad. And Kenneth Branagh, the director of ''Henry V,'' ''Much Ado About Nothing'' and ''Hamlet,'' offers a new, musicalized Shakespeare.\n\nMy musical apparition featuring my nephew and company is not far from the spirit of Mr. Branagh's version of ''Love's Labour's Lost,'' opening Friday. The three young gentlemen-scholars who take an oath with the King of Navarre to seek the purity of intellectual pursuit and renounce women are constantly breaking into Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Irving Berlin standards. When the Princess of France and her three lovely ladies-in-waiting propitiously camp out by their Academy, the King and his court can only express their excitement by singing and dancing.\n\nPERSONALLY, I believe no situation is either so tense or so romantic that it can't be just slightly heightened by a good old-fashioned movie-musical number. I have always secretly hoped that economic summit meetings erupted behind closed doors into ''Big Spender'' and that Margaret Thatcher crooned ''Begin the Beguine'' as she told the cabinet her plans for the Falklands. Wouldn't any commuter's trip to Darien be immeasurably enhanced by a chorus of eager returning spouses harmonizing ''I Married an Angel'' a cappella? Finally, the playwright Christopher Durang and I have always thought that the tragedy ''Medea'' would be much improved if she forgot about revenge and sang and danced, ''Forget your troubles, c'mon get happy,'' with the Greek chorus instead. Think Ann Miller tap dancing on a drum.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
