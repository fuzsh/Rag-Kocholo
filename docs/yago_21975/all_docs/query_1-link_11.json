        "text": "photo of KB used to illustrate a snippet about who might be the next James Bond (yeesh... is there anyone, beside Sylvester Stallone and Al Gore, who hasn't been suggested for that part? Even my Rufus Sewell was trotted out - grin.) And, in parts he did get: Kenneth as Edgar, in King Lear, Rick Lamb and wife (aren't they cute?) in High Season, and an ebullient ('My boots are waterproof!') Benedick in Much Ado.\n\nAnd finally, one more round of the 'I'm not gay but I'll let you know if I change' chorus, coupled with what has to be the definitive nixing of the Ken & Alicia rumours - in this article from the Seattle Gay News.\n\n(4 October, thanks Catherine, Douglass, Robbie, Lena, Jude, Jane, Kim)\n\nSchneider's 2nd Stage - the flyer! And a wee photo of KB with his Schneider look (in more senses than just the physical, perhaps). This might be as much as most of us get to see of this film, alas. However, we'll keep you posted if the jungle drums turn up news of any other showings.\n\nSpeaking of showings.... Love's Labour's Lost will be shown on 2 November at the Tokyo International Film Festival, at a special screening. At this point there is no word on possible cast attendance.\n\nOver on this side of the world, the DVD release of Love's Labour's Lost in the U.S. is announced for 19 December. So far they are talking about \"anamorphic widescreen and trailers\", but not the other goodies available on the UK version. Presumably they won't be ditching the other good stuff, right? Right?\n\n(30 September, thanks Catherine, Misato, Tanya)\n\nBeans, I probably won't be able to update the site for the rest of this week, due to tearing up the town (and not just any town - NYC) with pals... so KB had better not do anything too exciting (at least nothing that would be fit for us to know about ;-)). I think that the new photo links are all working (after I messed them all up yesterday): the photos from these news bits (with the exception of any dodgy ones - you have to read the news to see those :-)) have migrated into \"new pics\", and into the Gallery with 'new' flags. I leave you with the latest photo from How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog, from Entertainment Weekly.\n\nLots of nice photos from the Toronto Film Festival at this site: www.stevegranitz.com/ - click on 09-16-00.\n\nYou have to look at them through a big watermark, but it's worth it. The same photographer is in cahoots with the IMDB and you can see more photos there (us.imdb.com/PGallery?Branagh,+Kenneth)\n\n(26 September, thanks Jude)\n\nYippee! We have a \"witness\" account extolling the virtues of Schneider's 2nd Stage:\n\n\"I hope it's not too late to pass the word around, but a spectacular short film starring Ken is going to be shown at the Empire, Leicester Square in London. It's called Schneider's 2nd Stage and is a psychological thriller unlike anything he's ever done before. Trust me, I've seen it and it's great.\n\nIt will be shown on Monday 25th of September at 9.00pm. It really is a brilliant short. I was blown away by the twists and turns in the plot. I thoroughly recommend it.\"\n\n(23 September, thanks Geraint)\n\nRemember Chubby Bunny? Wail! I want my Ngoc back! I want my Ngoc back! I want my Ngoc back! I want my Ngoc back!....ahem. So do you, I know - especially since you're stuck with this poor-substitute prose. Sigh.... Where were we? Right, forget Chubby Bunny - it's Energizer Bunny all the way. So what has KB done, while we blinked? Recorded The Little Prince and Richard III, narrated a documentary on Lon Chaney (more below), filmed Schneider's 2nd Stage (more below), quaffed at Bistro 990 (more below), taken in the judo competitions at the Sydney Olympics, and got a tan. What has he got stacked up for the immediate future? Rabbit Proof Fence, in Australia, Conspiracy, the Wannsee Conference HBO series, in Europe, the Shackleton series, in Antarctica... and probably a bunch of other things still to be announced (no one's fooling me anymore - \"a holiday\", pshaw!). So here are snippets:\n\nFrom the Toronto Star:\n\n\"TOP DOGS: Kenneth Branagh and Robin Wright Penn, co-stars of the closing gala film 'How To Kill Your Neighbour's Dog', made the scene at Bistro 990 on Friday night. Penn, who is now a brunette, sat at the bar for 15 minutes unrecognized.\"\n\n...while Branagh was mobbed by hordes of unruly Torontonians (an oxymoron, giggle).\n\nFrom the Port Townsend Film Festival web site:\n\n#19 Lon Chaney: Man of a Thousand Faces\n\nUSA, 2000 84 min.\n\nNarrated by Kenneth Branagh, this documentary examines the film career and techniques of this diverse actor who brought us; Phantom Of The Opera as well as the The Hunchback of Notre Dame. The film also details his childhood with deaf parents and the circumstances that lead to his chameleon persona.\n\nFrom the Evening Standard, 21 September, by Syrie Johnson:\n\nSchneider's 2nd Stage was made by a 27-year-old called Phil Stoole, with nothing but a credit card and a contact book, and stars Kenneth Branagh. Stoole has been involved in all Branagh's movies since Othello, was his personal assistant on Love's Labour's Lost, and is regarded as his protege. \"He said to me, 'You can have me for a day's filming,' \" recalls Stoole. \" 'You have 12 days to come up with a script.'\"\n\n\"I had no time, no set and no funding. In the end it cost me only £3,000 - because I went with cap in hand to all the people I had worked with, who are the top bods in the business. I gave Branagh the script on Thursday, while he was making Walking With Dinosaurs, we had a read-through in his lunch-hour, and then filmed on Saturday.\"\n\n\"He's done shorts before,\" Stoole adds. \"I think stars appear in shorts because for a bit of effort they're giving someone an enormous break. But also, it's for the part. I wrote the most juicy part for him, like no other he's ever done.\"\n\nIf you want to know exactly how juicy that part was, the film is being screened as part of the BBC's British Short Film Festival which is currently running at the UCI cinema in Leicester Square. It's included in a programme called Dread Deeds which is running next Monday at 9 pm. Soliciting reviews and descriptions (and bootleg copies...nah, not really) now!\n\nHere's some more information on the recording of Richard III:\n\nRichard III for Naxos Audio Shakespeare to be released on CD and audio tape early next year.\n\nOther castings:\n\nBuckingham Nicholas Farrell\n\nHastings John Shrapnel\n\nClarence Michael Maloney\n\nQueen Elizabeth Celia Imrie\n\nLady Anne Stella Gonet\n\nStanley John Woodvine\n\nEdward IV Bruce Alexander\n\nQueen Margaret Geraldine McEwan\n\nDuchess of York Auriol Smith\n\nRichmond Jamie Glover\n\nI bet the lunches and breaks were fun while they were recording this! Getting back to How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog, another (SPOILER ALERT) review is out, a nice one from The Hollywood Reporter. There is also a mention in the September 29 issue of Entertainment Weekly, in a report on the Toronto festival (pp. 100-101.) A quote:\n\n\"Beyond that, Kenneth Branagh has his best non-Shakespeare role ever in 'How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog', the tale of an acidly clever British playwright going through a new kind of mid-life crisis.\"\n\nChannelling my Nockie again I'm thinking this film is 'gonna kick ass!\". When it gets distributed...\n\nThe Branagh charm worked bigtime with the nice reporter who followed up on little Suzi from Pittsburgh, and he's written another nice article.\n\nCasting back a bit, I've added the \"back of the book\" comments to the Companion to the Shakespearean Films of Kenneth Branagh page. Thoroughly exhausted by the turbo-charged life o' Ken, I end today's news. More soon no doubt. :-)\n\n(22 September, thanks Jennifer, Catherine, Jude, FilmLover, Jane)\n\nA veritable gallery of drop-dead fabuloso photos from the Toronto Film Festival, available here. And one, which didn't make it into the gallery, of Kenneth looking like he's just removed an eyeball... or maybe I've watched MS's Frankenstein one too many times. :-) You can see a video with snippets of the press conference and gala, and of the film (SPOILER ALERT #1) at the Toronto International Film Festival site. SPOILER ALERT #2: The first review for How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog is out. Here's KB's squirrel from the fundraising auction. His disclaimer aside it shows a deft hand and bears a resemblance to a little *%$%#! that keeps digging up my tulips. (Not brown or in need of saving... :-) ).\n\n(19 September, thanks Paula V.)\n\nA cute follow-up to the article on KB's co-star Suzi is here. This snippet below comes from the National Post (18 September 2000):\n\nThe beautiful table in SkyDome's VIP area consisted of Kenneth Branagh, Robin Wright Penn, and others drinking \"Silver Lining\" martinis. \"I think what makes a person beautiful is twinkly eyes,\" said Branagh. \"All a person needs to be sexy are twinkly eyes.\" (I pinched my thigh viciously, but got only watery eyes, not twinkly.)\n\nNext to him sat Donna Grobman, a super-sexy long-haired young woman wearing a low-cut green knit halter top. Her lips were shiny. What does she do? ''I'm a friend.'' Of who? ''All of these people,'' she answered, sweeping her hand across the VIP table.\n\nPenn has a perfect jawline, big eyes, and a tiny body. ''Soulful eyes,'' was her answer, strange, since although she is Branagh's co-star in How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog, they weren't sitting together when I asked each the question.\n\nI'm not sure what deep connection this journalist saw between 'soulful' and 'twinkling', but I haven't had a Silver Lining martini. :-)\n\nToday's pics: Tom Black in Public Enemy one and two.\n\n(18 September, thanks Jude)\n\nI cain't hardly keep up with it all! A whole passle of stuff (light-headedness and the fact that I'm only seeing images of KB in front of my eyes attest to that... or maybe not, since that seems to be my usual state, woe is me) is sort of up on the Compendium - 'sort of' because I can't be sure it all looks too great: I'm cross-eyed from trying to check, so if you see any f-ups, I'd appreciate it if you let me know.\n\nWhere to begin? The How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog page has been updated with articles relating to the press conference and photos from the same. Someone's looking mighty good. Here's a photo of Kenneth signing autographs in Toronto yesterday.\n\nThey wrote the script and got the financing in record time it seems (see TV Times snippet from August, cited below) because the Shackleton film is now a go, according to this article in the Sunday Telegraph. He's going to be \"fit as a butcher's dog\" - woooo hooo! But it'll all be covered up (unless global warming really speeds up and they have to lounge around in bathing suits between scenes ;-) ).\n\nFinally (for the moment), the British Wildlife Federation is having a fundraising campaign to support its oefforts to save the red squirrel. KB has contributed a drawing (I'll put up a copy after I get it shrunk to viewable size), and so have a lot of other interesting people. It's a hoot - go to www.qxl.com and do a search under \"Good Causes - General\". They only accept credit card pledges, and then only UK credit cards. Hmmmm....\n\n(17 September, thanks Corky, Susan S.)\n\nThere's nothing like saying 'not much news' to bring out the news. So it seems that Ken has figured out how to be beamed from place to place (or he's really keen to rack up frequent flyer points), since, besides his supposed appearance on September 16 at the Toronto International Film Festival, and the beginning of the filming of Rabbit-Proof Fence in Oz on September 18, he is also going to be attending the British Short Film festival:\n\nFrom Film net\n\nFILM BY NEW AUSTRALIAN WRITER/DIRECTOR TO OPEN THE BRITISH SHORT FILM FESTIVAL\n\nThe Other Days of Ruby Rae has just been given official selection into the British Short Film Festival and invited to screen at the prestigious Opening Night Gala. The film has been nominated for two of the biggest awards - Best International Short Film and Best Cinematography ( DOP Kathy Chambers).\n\nThe British Short Film Festival runs from the 21 - 28 of September and this year has some of Britain's biggest film stars in attendance and lending their support to the Festival. These include Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham-Carter and Kenneth Branagh. The awards will be announced on the 28th of September.\n\nTotally woooo hoooo news:\n\nFrom the Daily Express, 13 September 2000\n\nBranagh Gets the Hump with Radio\n\nIs there no limit to Kenneth Branagh's devotion to his art? The uncrowned prince of luvviedom is to convert himself into a physically deformed spectacle to play a behumped Shakespearian villain - for the radio. \"I'm doing a production of Richard III for the BBC,\" Branagh, 39, told me at a fundraising dinner in London's Caravaggio restaurant for the children's cancer charity, The Over the Wall Gang.\n\n\"But I'm still making sure I've got a hump on my back!\" Ken, who in any other profession might raise suspicions of being one powder-puff short of a full make-up kit, is starring alongside Celia Imrie, Nicholas Farrell and John Shrapnel in the Radio 3 production. Warming to his theme he added: \"My footsteps have to sound like I have limped into the recording studio. You must do these things properly.\"\n\nCourse, some of us (alright, all of us) were hoping those 'interested in Richard III' comments that floated about over the last months meant on the stage, but no complaints about this...\n\nOn the \"which historical character should I play next?\" front, there is an update and some news.\n\nUpdate: TV Times magazine clipping of August 19th\n\nKenneth Branagh could soon be slipping on his snow shoes. He's top of C4's wishlist to play Arctic explorer Ernest Shackleton in a four hour film about his extraordinary trip to the South Pole in 1914. Although Ken's people are adamant that no deal has been finalised, they do accept that the involvement of award winning 'Longitude' director Charles Sturridge is a big lure. It was Charles who brought 'Longitude' to C4 as part of a contract, with his production company, that also includes a film about the poet Lord Byron. 'Ken is very interested in working with Charles,' says a spokeswoman at his Shepperton Studios office. 'But there's no script, budget or even a time set for filming! Any decision will have to wait until next year.'\n\nNews: Hollywood Reporter (13 September)\n\nKenneth Branagh and Stanley Tucci have signed on to star in HBO Films' \"Conspiracy,\" expected to start shooting in Europe in the fall. The project, to be directed by Frank Pierson and written by Loring Mandel, chronicles the secret meeting in 1942 of the Third Reich at Wannsee, where Hitler and his senior advisers drew up plans for the Final Solution for the extermination of the Jews.\n\nThe project will be produced by Nick Gillott and executive produced by Pierson, Peter Zinner and Frank Doelger, a former HBO executive who now serves as a consultant to the company. Branagh, whose participation marks a departure for the actor who is usually featured on film, will play the role of Reinhard Heydrich, the second in command to Heinrich Himmler and the boss of Adolf Eichmann, who will be played by Tucci. Branagh, who is repped by his manager Judy Hofflund of Hofflund/Polone, most recently wrote, starred in, produced and directed \"Love's Labour's Lost\" for Intermedia and Miramax Films. His most recent feature acting credits include \"Wild Wild West,\" \"The Theory of Flight,\" \"Celebrity,\" \"The Gingerbread Man\" and \"Hamlet.\" He recently signed on to star in the low-budget historical drama \"Rabbit-Proof Fence,\" director Phillip Noyce's first Australian project in 12 years. Shooting is slated to begin Monday in Adelaide on \"Rabbit-Proof.\"\n\nLast but not least - the 'pic of the day', Spanish cover boy! (14 September, thanks Marina, Jude, Jenny, Isabel)\n\nNot much news - but this snippet from the Evening Standard (10 September): \"Larry Adler and Kenneth Branagh were at Caraveggio's over the weekend to support the Over The Wall Gang Camp, a charity which provides holidays for children with cancer.\" Yay!! Feast your eyes on KB doing the dude thing (you don't need that life jacket, honey, I'll save you!). And doing the director thing in Dead Again and Much Ado. And... on a Renaissance tour in 1990, wearing the Now magazine t-shirt (Toronto publication - a nod to his upcoming visit). (I want to know what that Post-it note on the mirror says...). There are still articles and pics to come, when I figure out how to put more hours into the day.\n\n(13 September, thanks Catherine, Juliane, Jude)\n\nCrapload of old 'new photos' - Part deux . It's done - all the photos from January to June 2000 are in the Gallery and listed with the 'new photos' (the actual new photos aren't there yet, ha ha - but that's life :-) They're coming!)\n\nThere should be some images and a sound bite from the Toronto film fest next weekend... in the meantime, here are 20 Bran-tastic Facts About Ken from teletext.co.uk, August 2000 (With Manchester United designated as KB's \"beloved\" team, you have to wonder about the 'fact' checkers for this article... :-) ). A photo goes with it. And here's a photo of Herr Knopp (reminding me absurdly of a young Truman Capote - note to self: ask Ngoc about medication).\n\n(10 September, thanks Ngoc, Jude)\n\nSo the \"Ohmigod, why are they taking a picture of me now?\" photo is gracing the Arts Section of the New York Times (Thursday, 7 September), with an article about the Toronto International Film Festival. Whose idea was it to make this a publicity shot? The over-thirty male demographic can be written off in terms of ticket sales immediately... but maybe it'll peak everyone else's curiosity. :-)\n\nMeanwhile, German fans can rest easy, according to this snippet from a January press release:\n\n\"CineMedia has taken full distribution rights for the German-speaking territories to six titles originally announced as part of an $87 million production and financing pact unveiled last year at Cannes between Avi Lerner's Millennium Films and German production-investment fund Cinerenta. Those pics are \"Dreaming of Julia,\" with Harvey Keitel; \"Loving Lulu,\" with Patrick Swayze and Melanie Griffith; \"Prozac Nation,\" with Andie MacDowell and Christina Ricci; \"Anasazi Moon,\" with Gary Oldman; \"How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog,\" which will be produced through Robert Redford's South Fork Films; and \"Dancing at the Blue Iguana.\"\"\n\nTo quote our inimitable (I try, but it's just a pathetic sham) Ngoc, there's a whole crapload of \"new\" photos up in the Photo Gallery. \"New\" is qualified because those of you who read this KB chronicle assiduously will have seen them, linked from here, in the early part of this year. The really old 'new photos' have been integrated into the Gallery, and the not quite so old 'new photos' are there (up to March 2000 - lots more to come!) with \"New\" flags. When my eyes start registering letters besides JPG again I'll get the rest of them up there. :-) The irony is that while we court eyestrain overdosing on gazillions of KB photos here, Kenneth probably has to go to the photo booth if he wants to buy a weekly travel card (not that I think he actually ever buys them, those quotes about \"I like to take the tube\" notwithstanding).\n\nGetting back to the 'new' new... there's a new photo from HTKYND up on the Toronto International Film Festival site: go there and click on the schedule for September 16, and the name of the film, to see it and read the blurb, or here for just the pic. There are also some other new photos (we're sticking with the visuals today, articles coming soon): 'When we were 12... er, make that 22'; a series of pics (#1, #2, #3, #4) from The Boy in the Bush, and \"The way you wear your hat...\". Stay tuned!\n\n(5 September, thanks Film Lover, Jude)\n\nOye, oye!!! Hey beans! (BTW, in case anyone doesn't go back far enough, the etymology of \"beans\" according to the KED (Ken-Friends English Dictionary - not put together with the aid of just one madman, like the OED, but a whole slew of mad people) traces this expression back to the \"2B\" list (first usage credited to the orignator, Katie Penote), whose members were \"2Bers\", subsequently referred to as \"2Beans\", and ulitmately as \"beans\" by (the famous) Ngoc. Ahem....\n\nHey beans!! It's here, it's finally here! The Companion to the Shakespearean Films of Kenneth Branagh is available for purchase - and reading! There's a slip of a lad on the cover, \"photo inédite\", as they say (you've not seen it before). Let's put this book on the bestseller list. :-)\n\n(31 August, thanks Jude)\n\nSo it's back under the burning sun in Oz for 'Kin'! (Gee, why does that Survivor music keep playing in my head?....)\n\n31/8/2000: BRANAGH IN RABBIT PROOF\n\nBrit thesp Kenneth Branagh has signed to star in Phil Noyce's Rabbit Proof Fence, shooting from mid September in the Flinders Ranges in South Australia (as reported here 27/7/2000).\n\nRabbit Proof Fence is the story of three Aboriginal girls forcibly taken from their outback families in 1931 to be trained as domestic servants. They escape and embark on an epic 2,000 km journey to get back home, with the authorities pursuing them all the way. Based on a true story and written by Christine Olsen (from a book by Doris Pilkington), the film has attracted international executive producer Jeremy Thomas (The Last Emperor, The Sheltering Sky, Naked Lunch, etc) and renowned Hong Kong-based Australian cinematographer Chris Doyle; David Elfick, with whom Noyce made his acclaimed debut, Newsfront, is co-executive producer, and John Winter is line producer.\n\nBranagh will play one of the more controversial figures in Australian history, A.O Neville. \"As Chief Protector of Aborigines in West Australia, the English born Neville devised and administered a notorious scheme for controlling the state's indigenous population\", said Noyce. \"Kenneth Branagh is one of the world's most gifted performers. I am thrilled that he has accepted the challenge to portray a man who literally killed with his misguided kindness.\"\n\nAustralian distribution will be handled by Ocean Pictures, the company recently formed by producers Jonathan Shteinman and Emile Sherman.\n\n(Thanks Jenny, Sarah)\n\nOn the 'visuals' front, a rather dubious photo (Herr Knopp at the cabaret in his off-time?) to start off with - we cover all bases here, even Ken with snake-eyes. :-) (From Cinema, German movie mag.)\n\nA photo link has been added to the Tatler article, this little caricature is also from the article; there is a drop-dead (making up for the snake-eyes) gorgeous Coriolanus pic (from the programme of the Fiennes/Roache \"oeuvre\" this past summer... they know who's good company!). A few of the previously seen HTKYND photos have been gathered on the HTKYND press page. There are scads of new pics on the way - enough to force me to fix up the Photo Gallery - very soon, very soon. Meanwhile, I leave you with this link to KB in a photo with a make-up artist, not sure when or where, but the lady's resume leads one to believe it might have been for a television show. Cute! (29 August, thanks Alexandra, Jane, Isabel, Corky)\n\nA little more catch-up: the Tatler article from 1994 is now up, as is a June article from the Boston Globe. The accompanying pic from the Globe is here. Tatler pics coming...\n\nFor a limited time only: pics from the July BB at Villa Vignamaggio are here.\n\nAnd last but not least: the covers from The Little Prince CD-ROM. (27 August, thanks Jane, Paula, Cyn, Jude)\n\nPolish up those glasses - the How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog pics are starting to arrive. There is now a HTKYND Rress Room so you can read all about it (for a while anyway, till the lawyers contact me). The latest pic (see the Canada.com article) suggests that maybe Ken was spending too much time with that dog... :-)\n\nCasting back a bit, here's an arty Ken from the cover of the King Lear audiotape. (24 August, thanks Jennifer, Film Lover, Susan)\n\nYESSSSSS!!!!!! NOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!\n\nOkay, so the YES news is that How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog is being shown at the Closing Gala of the Toronto International Film Festival! How cool is that? (The Canuck pauses to dance around a bit with a red-leaf flag... :-))\n\nThe NO news is that all the tickets have already been sold out, and not only the tickets to the Gala but also the Festival Passes, Coupon Books, and Daytime Passes. I'm not quite clear on whether this is the only showing... single advance sale tickets are still available, though maybe not for this film. (The Montrealer pauses to engage in the old Montreal vs Toronto rivalry, muttering \"typical for Toronto -they should call it The Bay-Street-and-Its-Backscratching-Buddies Film Festival\", mutter, mutter, mutter - with apologies to any Bay Streeters reading this...)\n\nSo here's the press release (check out the site, they must have a thousand PR people, there are a thousand press releases there):\n\nWORLD PREMIERE OF HOW TO KILL YOUR NEIGHBOR'S DOG TO CLOSE THE FESTIVAL\n\nToronto  HOW TO KILL YOUR NEIGHBOR'S DOG, written and directed by Michael Kalesniko, is the closing night Gala at the 25th Toronto International Film Festival. This world premiere stars Kenneth Branagh, Robin Wright-Penn, and Lynn Redgrave.\n\nHOW TO KILL YOUR NEIGHBOR'S DOG is a sophisticated and touching comedy about the cynical Peter McGowen (Kenneth Branagh), an L.A.-based playwright fallen on hard times, with a string of flops and personal tribulations contributing to his angst. His wife, Melanie (Robin Wright-Penn) is anxious to start a family, the neighbour has an aggressively noisy dog, and to top it off, his producer and cast insist that the 10-year-old character in his latest play doesn't ring true.\n\nChallenged to develop a real' child, Peter reluctantly befriends the little girl next door (Suzi Hofrichter)  which sends Melanie's maternal instincts into full gear and changes Peter's life in ways he never could have imagined.\n\nMillennium Films and Cinerenta present HOW TO KILL YOUR NEIGHBOR'S DOG, directed and written by Michael Kalesniko and produced by Michael Nozik, Nancy Ruff, and Brad Weston. The film is executive produced by Robert Redford and co-executive produced by Avi Lerner.\n\nThis Gala presentation is sponsored by National Bank Financial.\n\nGala presentations at Roy Thomson Hall are made possible through the sponsorship of Famous Players Inc., Showtime Networks Inc., and Paramount Pictures (Canada) Inc.\n\nFor more information, please contact: Megan de Jong or Gabrielle Free at 416-934-3200.\n\nNow, we only need to find out whether the illustrious cast will be in attendance.\n\nTo while away the time, and since LLL is still touring round the country - sort of - here's another interview with Kenneth. More pics and articles coming soon... (22 June, thanks Renie, Becky, Film Lover)\n\nHey 2b-eans! NEWS! We know KB is always doing 50 million things, but when it's quiet, the faintest, teensiest idea that maybe he *is* taking a break might sneak into your mind - but... you're wrong! He's been \"Entering the Universe of 'The Little Prince'\".... the link is to an article, with lots of psychological input, about the CD-ROM version of The Little Prince, narrated by the best. More good news: the mind-benders really like KB (see below), so all of us are sane after all...\n\nHere are the pertinent parts\n\n... Sure, millions of young readers in America have loved \"The Little Prince\" since it was first published in 1943 -- but they've never experienced Antoine de Saint-Exupery's classic fable quite like this.\n\nTivola Publishing, a Berlin-based producer of children's multimedia CD-ROMs, will release the English language CD-ROM adaptation of the best-selling book Aug. 28. The CD-ROM ($29.99), which was released in Germany two years ago, features a 3-D animated version of Saint-Exupery's story, based on a new translation by poet Richard Howard, with British actor-director Kenneth Branagh as narrator and Owen Evans, a 12-year-old actor from west London, providing the voice of the Little Prince. ...\n\n... That \"The Little Prince\" is now on a CD-ROM doesn't bother Kaganoff. \"I think they've certainly chosen something that has delightful illustrations that live, and the voice of Kenneth Branagh will add a tremendous amount of meaning,\" she said. (Dennis McLellan, Los Angeles Times)\n\nHere's nice news! I leave you to speculate on directors who might show their films (or themselves) here in the future...\n\nLONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Belfast's first film festival will include the last movie performance by screen legend Sir John Gielgud. The legendary actor will co-star with playwright Harold Pinter in \"Catastrophe\", one of seven short films in a film compilation of the work of Samuel Beckett. \"Cork has had a film festival for 44 years, Dublin has had one for 37, Belfast has never had a film festival\", Aidan McCloone, festival organizer, told the BBC. \"I think it's long overdue and we're here today to set that straight.\" The festival, which will run from September 22 to 29, will include Cannes Film Festival winner \"Dancer in the Dark\", starring Icelandic singer Bjork. Gielgud died in May, aged 96.\n\nOne day I'm going to be beat the Photo Gallery into shape, but until then, here's a kind of \"skipped the daily trimming\" version of Spider(beard)man. It belongs to a nice article. (18 August, thanks to Paula B., Millard, Jane)\n\nOkay, today the news is not entirely good... if you've seen the grey box on the main page you'll know what I'm talking about, if not - go read it and weep. ...However, we soldier on...(she says, wailing and gnashing her teeth) or as Ken would say \"onwards and upwards\" (hey pal, can ya lend me that bi-plane you have in your yard?).\n\nTo cheer you, here is news from UAYD. Read about how the 1999 Birthday Fundraising gift was used and participate in this year's birthday project! Further cheer, and we're talking major feel-good, Ken-is-such-a-sweetie, wish-I-were-eleven-and-and-his-co-star cheer, right here. There will be a few more UAYD pics in the next days (check the BDay and UAYD pages).\n\nLast bit of cheer: LLL is showing up here and there around the US... (not showing up enough to make us ever forgive Miramax, though, but let's not get into that). (12 August, thanks to Jude)\n\nOkay, get ready for a whole slew of news (some could qualify as \"olds\"), in no logical order, as we play catch-up (with many thanks to Jude, our closet archivist).\n\nFirst things first.... Wooooo hooooo!!!\n\nLove's Labour's Lost DVD in the UK\n\nSeptember 11th release. This disk is presented 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV's) with a DD 5.1 soundtrack. Extras include 5 deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, outtakes, 'making of' documentary and a commentary track by Kenneth Branagh.\n\nThey put the same goodies on with the DVD version in other countries, right? Right? Right? Otherwise shoot me now.\n\nTune into a wonderful interview with Ken at Broadcast.com. It's almost 8 minutes long and you'll find out why he won't go skydiving with you.\n\nThe sequel to Walking with Dinosaurs was announced by the Beeb. It's called The Ballad of Big Al and is about an allasaur whose bones were dubbed Big Al. It looks like it will be screened (in Britain) at Christmas but no word on who is narrating yet. (But we know who we want!) (1 August 2000)\n\nFrom Darkhorizons.com\n\nAlien Love Triangle is officially dead. The collection of three short films was killed after Gary Fleder's Imposter was drawn out to a feature. Now, the other completed segment, directed by Transpotting's Danny Boyle and starring Kenneth Branagh, Heather Graham and Courtney Cox will be included as an extra on the Imposter DVD. (5 July 2000)\n\nAnd the logic of this is....? Oh well, sales of the Imposter DVD will be good...\n\nIf either of these next two pans out (for this you're allowed to cross your eyes along with everything else, not to mention wishing on stars, etc.) Ken will be needing some woollies... (they say knitting is having a renaissance, BTW... though not at my house :-)).\n\nFrom the Belfast Telegraph\n\nKenneth Branagh has signed up to play Tsar Alexander I in the $35m major mini-series, Napoleon. Also in the series will be Gerard Depardieu, John Malkovich and Isabella Rossellini.\n\n\"Alexander I (of Russia)(1777-1825), emperor of Russia (1801-1825), son of Emperor Paul I. He abolished many barbarous and cruel punishments then practiced and in 1802 introduced a more orderly administration of government by the creation of eight ministries. He improved the condition of the serfs and promoted education, doubling the number of Russian universities by establishing those at Saint Petersburg, Kharkiv and Kazan. Alexander was for a time the ally of Prussia against Napoleon of France. In 1807, however, after the battles of Eylau and Friedland, Alexander allied himself with the French. He broke the alliance in 1812, and later that year Napoleon invaded Russia, only to lose his army in a disastrous retreat from Moscow. Alexander was prominent thereafter in the European coalition that led to Napoleon's fall. In 1815 Alexander instituted the Holy Alliance of Austria, Russia and Prussia. The purpose of the alliance, as it was conceived, was to achieve the realization of high Christian ideals among the nations of Europe, but it soon ceased to have any real importance. The last years of Alexander's life and reign were reactionary and despotic. He was succeeded by his brother Nicholas I.\" (16 May 2000)\n\nPA News - BRANAGH IN TALKS TO STAR AS ANTARCTIC EXPLORER\n\nby Anthony Barnes\n\nActor Kenneth Branagh is in talks to play Antarctic explorer Ernest Shackleton in a multi-million pound dramatisation of his polar expedition, it was announced today. Director Charles Sturridge is keen to land the Shakespearean star for the extraordinary tale of survival which will be made for Channel 4 and begins shooting next summer.\n\nShackleton and his crew survived for two years in the treacherous region after their boat the Endurance became trapped in ice floes and was later crushed.\n\nSturridge, who made the award-winning adaptation of bestseller Longitude, said: \"This is a film about a man, his men and an incredible journey.\n\nAgainst seemingly hopeless odds Shakleton managed to keep his 28-man crew alive for two terrifying years, at the same time as millions of men were being sacrificed in the defense of civilisation on the battlefields of France.\"\n\nSturridge has signed a three-year deal with Channel 4 to create further films and is currently writing the script for his four-hour Shackleton film, which will be shown in two parts.\n\nShackleton set off from Britain on the eve of the First World War in 1914 aiming to lead the first expedition to cross the South Pole. But by January 1915 their ship Endurance had become locked in the ice floes and 10 months later they abandoned ship when it was crushed by ice. Then Shackleton and his team dragged lifeboats across the frozen water until they reached the edge of the ocean then rowed 100 miles to Elephant Island. But after a long wait they realised there was no chance of being picked up there so Shackleton and five others made a further 650-mile journey tossed by 100ft waves. They eventually reached South Georgia and acquired a larger boat to return to rescue the rest of the crew.\n\nChannel 4 Director of Programmes, Tim Gardam said: \"I'm thrilled Charles Sturridge has come up with such a great project for us and I expect Shackleton to be one of our most ambitious dramas.\" (7 July 2000)\n\nThere was also verbal fan-mail:\n\nWENN-FIFTH-HOLLYWOOD, SHOWBIZ & PEOPLE NEWS\n\nChristian Campbell is full of admiration for British actor Kenneth Branagh - because he's so socially relevant. Neve Campbell's older brother is finding fame in America with new movie TRICK, and as well as acting, he also directs and produces - much like Branagh.\n\nHe says, \"I envy his career. He's always done things where he's had a large part in the producing or writing and they're usually very quirky, alternative types of films. They're also socially relevant - that's the kind of career I would like to have.\" (10 May 2000)\n\nReaching waaaaay back to March....\n\nThis appeared in a Greek magazine Cinema March 2000 issue: \"Strange murders happen at the studios of Chinecita, during the days Orson Welles shoots his new film. All these incredible events happen at the brand-new John Sayles script 'Fade to Black', which will become a film by Oliver -'An Ideal Husband'-Parker, with Kennegh Branagh as Orson Welles.\"\n\nThis is going to be one busy guy, or rather three guys (that we know about!) - and not one of them a plumber.\n\nOne more time....\n\nEmpire Online\n\nObi-Wan Laid to Rest\n\nEver since the concept of Episode I was first mooted, there's been speculation that Kenneth Branagh had originally been up for the part that Ewan McGregor finally nailed. But in an interview with Empire magazine this month, Branagh finally scotches the rumour.\n\nAsked whether he was ever really up for the role, Branagh insists that the story came about when an Australian artist suggested Branagh for a Star Wars trading card. 'When people were starved of information for the new film this artist suggested that I would make a good young Alec Guinness. And that was it - there was never a glimmer of interest from Lucasfilm.\n\nI endlessly explained to people that there was absolutely no truth in the rumour at all,' says Ken, 'but it happened around the time of the real intensification of the internet, and was an example to me of how a rumour like that can travel around the world in 24 hours.' (30 March 2000)\n\nLondon Times\n\nA certain weariness hangs over Kenneth Branagh these days. \"People seem to think I sit at home in my tights and codpiece watching TV,\" says Branagh. The solution? He plans to shed his Shakespearean skin by teaming up with Mike Myers, the comic behind Wayne's World and Austin Powers. \"I want to do a character-based comedy. I'd dearly like to have been a stand-up comic, but I never had the guts.\" (March 2000)\n\nThey'll probably write a skit with him watching TV in tights and codpiece - watch out what you wish for. :-). If your eyes are still focusing here are some wunderschöne photos (eins, zwei, drei) from Journal der Frau.\n\nThere are a few more bits and pieces (news from UAYD, Sarah's book!) but I would need access to illegal substances to finish it all tonight... so, stay tuned.\n\n(10 August, thanks to Jude, Alexandra)\n\nWe're baaaaack!! Sorry about the hiccup - actually it was bordering on cardiac arrest - but life is like that sometimes.... anyhow, after Richard Briers let go of that oxygen tank that KB got him for LLL, the Compendium grabbed it, breathed deeply and is about to bring you the news. In the meantime (while the scribe is at work), here are a few things to revive your passion:\n\n\"Branagh the Builder\"... No, I don't think it's a candid shot of the construction of Ken's house... he looks way too relaxed and happy for that. There are new articles from The Washington Post, Time Out New York and CBC Radio. Back to the Bard, another article, comes with a pic of Ken cheating in a limbo contest. Nothing like a guy in a tux.... at the LLL premiere and at the Tonys.\n\n(9 August, thanks to Corky, Jane, Renie)\n\nIf you're within a 200-mile radius of either New York city or Los Angeles, it behooves you to take a trip asap to the Paris Theater (in NY) or the Laemmle Royal on Santa Monica (in LA) to check out Love's Labour's Lost. Multiple times. The movie opens in the next 10 largest markets this Friday the 16th, I'll try to post the list of cities up by Wednesday. I'll also be adding (hopefully) reports from the New York premiere, DC screening, Newport Film Fest screening, and How To Kill Your Neighbor's Dog Cannes screening (crikey, and there's a nice review of HTKYND from Variety too) when I have time to do a proper update (so much Ken info, so little time). In the meantime, there are a dozen new LLL-related articles on this site, the must-reads of which include:\n\n-The Charlie Rose Show transcript: Ken, Nathan Lane, and Alicia Silverstone (*this aired last Friday, and usually repeats the next afternoon, so check your local PBS station today and try to catch it. Good stuff. Very, very funny. Thanks to Ann from the Shakespeare newsgroup for transcribing this!)\n\n-Articles from the Hollywood Reporter, Salon and The Onion. As always, complete listing of the new articles here.\n\n-Off-site links: Thanks to Tim for sending a link to his very fine interview with Ken, read the article here. And I've been alerted to a nice news site for Alicia Silverstone, called The New Alicia Gallery, which is updated daily and has lots of LLL-related Alicia links (and some Ken ones thrown in for good measure ;-). BTW, Alicia is scheduled to appear on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno this Wednesday). A new Alicia article can also be found here, with another sweet quote about Ken:\n\n\"Why wouldnt I take the opportunity to sit down with Kenneth Branagh? What better acting class am I going to go to? I thought, Ill have an hour acting class for free, that would be just amazing. Then a month later he called me and said, youre not going to get the part you auditioned for but Id love you to play the princess. I was like, Oh my goodness! I get to do it!? . . . [Ken] is so prepared, he certainly inspired me with his preparation, gleams Silverstone. Usually with a director you just try and help the director think a little bit beyond, push it. You want it to be as good as it can be. But with him its like from the moment you start working you just feel like, Oh my God, all I can do is to just keep up with the train. . . . I am ready for Kenneth Branagh to direct something and have me be in it. Id be so heartbroken if I didnt get to work with him again. I really would.\"\n\nKen (along with Alicia and Nathan Lane) did a gazillion talk shows (Conan O'Brien, Rosie O'Donnell, Charlie Rose, Regis & Kathie Lee) last week in NY to promote LLL, and I must say, Mr Branagh did very well. (Of course, the last time I saw him on a talk show was courtesy of the UK's Big Breakfast, a show on which everyone seemingly is encouraged to pop ecstasy pills before 8 in the morning. Really, I saw that show on tape at like 8pm at night and just watching the Johnny fellow exhausted me. High-energy, that guy is) Anyway, so yeah, Ken vv funny, charming, and appealing. Too bad I can't do screen captures and transcripts of the interviews...(June 12, thanks to Ann, Jeanette, Tim, Susan. And to all the critics who trashed LLL, I'd like to dedicate the Terrance and Phillip song from the South Park movie - everybody join hands and sing along! ... Heheh, just, um, kidding. I love critics. They're the coolest buns-holes ever :-)\n\nGo over to the Cranky Critic site to submit questions for Ken and Alicia Silverstone (Mr Cranky gave Love's Labour's Lost a good review, BTW. Good deal). Or just email your questions to Mr Cranky from here. Alicia will also be taking part in a live chat on Wednesday, June 7th at 8pm ET over at the Bigstar site, check out details here. . . . New pics include more Ken in Cannes - massage pic #1, #2, and #3, and posing with 3 supermodels (he does it so well) . . . Snippet from recent Entertainment Weekly re Ken and the upcoming Scottish King movie:\n\n\"Play time. My how Kenneth Branagh loves sprucing up Shakespeare. Now that he's added songs to the Bard's work in Miramax's Love's Labour's Lost, which opens June 9, he's turning his attention to a contemporary adaptation of Macbeth. 'It's a very timely story, all about ambition,' says Branagh. Still, he himself is not so ambitious this time around: While he'll adapt the screenplay and star as the murderous king, someone else will direct.\"\n\nAnd another nice Alicia quote from a BPI article:\n\n\"Kenneth's really so passionate about what he does that I felt like I was part of this magical thing that I had to keep moving and keep up with,\" she gushes. \"I can't wait to work with him again. If he doesn't hire me again, I may not be able to survive.\""
